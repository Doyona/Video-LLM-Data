F1 😅thumbs down
btw its 2011 Redbull car😂.. just how badly can a modern f1 car beat hypercars on a track
That F1 car is on hard tyre compounds....def its gonna be slow

Huracan: easy win💪🗿 F1 car: easy 2nd place💪🗿 GTR: Task failed successfully😭
I'm very disappointed with F1 performance Won't call them machine
Now they should try the old Benetton B186 F1 car vs these cars 😂
1200hp huracan, 1300hp 4.1 gtr, 750hp f1
Nothing beats a Huracan without bumper at track..🚀
So many butt heart gtr lovers , “ wHAt HoW DiD hE beAt ThE gTr ?!?!?😮” 😂😂😂
1200hp Lamborghini ❤
Please find a Audi r8 twin turbo rear bumper delete and race it against the huracan and a twin turbo gtr r35
That GTR is gorgeous. Love whatever finish the black is in that's on it, but it's so nice.
Pongan una Ferrari F1 2004. O un mclaren F1 2025.
ask mercedes to bring the Mercedes AMG PETRONAS W11 EQ Performance. That creature is gonna wreck u
I wanna see twin turbo Huracan vs Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut
What a actor he is. Common common screaming. Always choose high power car to drive
Thats nismo driver just not pressing making nissan look bad..maybe modest really🤔
F1 cars are not built for drag race they are for cornering with insane braking power plus they perform horrible in normal roads
Gtr beat this lembo dargfully
7:41 He literally did 💀☠️
Supra enter the chat 🐥
I never understood why they took the rear bumper off of tomb Lamborghini's. It looks so disgusting and I'm a car guy saying that and I love Lamborghini's.
3:30 turned down launch you said
A ver niños Gtr porque no los veo mamando con sus comentarios pendejos por aquí 😂
I don't care about who wins, i just enjoy that F1 car sound
A 2.4 v8
3:56 the mosquito coming for me after I left the window open
It's a bit unfair because the f1 is on hard tires
I wouldn’t trust a tuner car @ 220mph. Imagine the loading on the suspension. Etc
Supra vs 1200hp lamboghini
Italians makes the best petrol engines. Period.
F1 drs and ers k1 k2 💀
The Lambo jumped the start there! Plain to see...
tell the f1 car its adopted then itl go faster im verery disopointed the f1 car did't won 1race
It would have been so cool to get Max Verstappen to race you
If it would have been working  B of the individual to whom  Nj the I pad and
LOL what is wrong with the GTR?? those things own lambos.
First, the Lamborghini jumped the line almost every race!! Second, either the Lamborghini is more then 1200 hp, or the GTR is less then 1300 hp. There is no way the GTR lost like that with a hundred more ponies! Those GTR’s will whip almost anything on the street, so it supposedly having the claimed 1300, something or someone is not telling the truth!!!
çok komik bir video. güzel reklam almışlar. en kötü f1 arabası  burada bu iki aracı 6. vitesle bile geçer. aracın son hızı 300km. f1 aracı o hıza 6 saniyede ulaşır. komik olmuş. f1 aracını asfalta sadece moto gp motorları geçer o da kısa mesafede. uzunda ve virajlı pistte hiçbir asfalt aracı f1 aracını geçemezzzzz.
The gtr
Lambo with twin turbo is beast
Remember never race with a lamborghini with no bumper💀
how fast is the lambo?
Lamborghini just literally destroyed everything
Gtr is my favourite i tou the gtr lose
did i just hear 780 hundred hours powr?
I think black smoke came out cf that lambo when it was launching😅😅
Matt did 220 mph / 354 kmh across the 1 mile mark 🫣🫣🔥🔥🔥
you should bring Ferrari F1 car instead of red bull then you will see :)
Where is the Ferrari lovers 💀 i cant see them
မိုက်တယ်အစိန်းရောင်ကားတစ်ပြေးနေတယ်
Ese F1 car es una basura.
SAlam dari trenggalek indonesia
Don't race with 2 cars on the street.. Lambo without bumper and Civic with laptop...
Bring thr F1 V10
David sucks a lot
never race a lamboi without bumper
That’s only 1200hp (less than a chiron and remac) and it does 8.9sec!! That’s insane.. imagine if it got a 2000hp
hey jurgan go on rev up your car!!!!!!!
Those air filters id  maneuvre the piping away from the tires. It is picking up alot of flack as it stands..
Just remember that the F1 only got 750 vs 1200,1300 just think if the F1 had 900
The Lamborghini deserved to lose, based on its paint color.  Lamborghini should deny requests for green, orange, purple, and pink (unless it is being purchased by the wife).

Lambo beet a f1 🫤
62 million.....DAMNNNNNNNN
Just goes to show how crap and slow modeen F1 cars are...
Yea I would want to see same cars on circuit track ie the f1 cars natural habitat please
Why is there always some guy blabbering about what EVs do. We do not care. (Fyi anything with 1000whp will run a 9. It being an ev isnt special. It having 1000hp is what makes it quick) back to it though. Go back to drinking soy products or something
8.9s on Un prepped is ridiculous. On a prepped strip with radials is 7s
Any car that can at least keep up with a F1 car is fast
F1 don't have a great start 😭
Absolutely kid test.also this gtr is always in safe map? I think f1 is fast not for stupid fasts!!!
Kid you don't know  IF you modified GTR and LAMBORGHINI  My formula car seen like kide
Never race a lambo with no rear bumper, they will make you lose your dignity
from the data, the F1 know it's not their match, the engine itself .. it's just half of the lambo
This proves F1 engines are absolutely overpriced 💯
the funniest thing is the f1 car isnt ever using soft tyres, probably it had a cold start AND its not running least downforce 💀
It's insane to think that in this race the Tesla plaid would come last, such an impressive performance from any of these cars
Bro is the new flash
There's a reason these huracans are called the Italian supra... The Lambo v10 is a turners wet dreams...slapping on twin turbos and u get instand 4 figure HP...if it can beat a turned up Godzilla the u know it means business
BRO HOW A LAMBO BEAT A F1 CAR THAT IS CRAZY!
Lamborghini is very fast 😅
You never race a Lamborghini with no bumper
The red bull formula 1 car definitely not cheap to own it. The Lambo that is tuned is insanely fast than the other cars.
Why Danrue won’t do digs
F1 ashame
that lambo’s accelaration is insane
F1 is designed to go on a track in circles not designed 1/4 mile just bc it’s an f1 car doesn’t mean it’s fast race the f1 on a track in a circle bet you leave the track on your turn duh
Lamborghini should consider putting goddang turbos in stock. They make powerful engines but they keep making NA ones
But can that lambo turn corners going over 150?
Please, i beg you.. use a formula 1 car from 2004 next time. Just for fun.. the 2021 cars would probably destroy you, but you'll most likely not get one. Thx
Bugatti Chiron: May i come in?😅
F1 car with DRS DAMN
220 mph is insane.
That GtR was severely disappointing. It performed like it was stock. I've seen 1,000 hp ones running way faster than that.
I want that Lamborghini
Love that Lamborghini.  That's how Lamborghini needs to be .
Not a fair race. Mat launched before the hand go down.
Is that David coulthard 🗿
Im confused, Ford mustang code red 1300hp was 8.59sec  GTR r35 1300hp 9.3sec? Thats slow as shit
That F1 car's sound is crazy 😍🫰✨️
Two bulls have eaten the Godzilla 😂😂
When 9.2 sc wasn't fast enough 😢
Now let's have a race around a track...
They forgot civic and supra Xd
f1. aint the best on straits, where it shines is corners.
Why don't yall put them up against a more powerful F1 car and on a track
Vs gtr 1.600 hp
Formula 1 cars don't cost that much to build . They don't cost 62 million  They might cost a couple of million at most. They're not that expensive to build nothing but a frame motor and transmission there's not that much to it. It's just a Bare Bones car it's basically a damn fast go-kart frame with a plastic body.
Im shocked how that 1300hp gtr is slower than a 1200hp lambo 😅
Imagines that lambo made of full carbon fibre😮
I will definitely faint if i was in the Lamborghini
This is a dumb race. i will like to see all cars doing 140mph  curves, and breaking…
La Lamborghini est impressionnante 😳🇮🇹🫡
F1
The quickest Lamborghini i have seen in my life ❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Howcome the r35 isnt close makes no sense
Did anyone see the lambo smoking 😮
4:35  i just want to know if a native speaker can properly hear him? What did he actually say?
Please give lamborghini sian vs lamborghini avantador drag race and top speed
That is a crazy good tune on the lambo, great job to whoever did that tuning.. 8.9 sec quarter mile with 1200hp is no fucking joke..
That was the the first time I heard Matt cuss in a video
this lamboo is nuts
i want to see matt drive a f1 car
This lambo can easily beats bugatti chiron in quater mile,,, crazy power , shit man ❤️
F1
Nf
I think GTR was going more than 375kmh.
That Lambo is just, WOOOW
Harmony to ears
Ima have nightmares swatting mosquitoes 🦟 tonight
Remember never mess with a Lamborghini that doesn't have a bumper
A properly tuned GTR with "1300hp" should run the 1/4mile in the eights. So someone lied at one point in a conversation. 🤣
It needs soft tires that’s why 😂
gtr driver is  cow
You try amg Petronas they have way faster f1 cars
Why are these races soo random and unfair
f1 could have speed but f1 have 700hp so i guess it not speed lamborghini is speed
If f1 had 1000 horses it would’ve been crazy
not true Manipulated in favor of the Lamborghini nissan GTR is the faster
Your so lucky to have that
That's The Difference When You Add Turbo Charger In Your Lamborghini 🙂💖🔥 & Compare It With Nissan GTR,Supra And Other JDM Cars With A Stock Car
We demand Lamborghini Hurricane vs Bugatti Chiron
I think lamborghini is gona  win in the drag race
Nobody is beating the sound of an F1 no matter how tuned the car is
Something is wrong the GTR shouldve won easy
"I don't get what is so special about f1 cars if they lose drag races?" they can take corners at 200+ kmh 💀
Gtr driver is😢
Come to Australia and do this against V8 Supercars our best street cars harvest drag cars come to Australia
still unbeliveable that lambo has good launch, for stock case, usually gtr has better launch  that lambo's nut
that endiing lOL
imagine, when 9.2 and 9.3 on the 1/4 look slow 🤭
MAYBE:GTR FANS ARE CRYING AND THINKING WERE THISE SHORTS FAKE?😂
It’s not about the car, it’s about the driver
lamborgini best car
GTR FAN ASSEMBLE HERE
You know how crazy the race is when the slowest car does a 9.3 second run
62 million for an F1 and can't bet a lambo and the lambo cost 150000 then red bull should but a lambo and save a couple of millions lol
Who thinks that gtr is stock
the gtr hp is too small
The Lamborghini beat the F1 Car what
I would like you to race those 3 cars on the Track Race
This is Matt’s happiest video 😂
A V8 that weighs 3 digits is just insane 😮‍💨😤
Impresive for the f1 .  2.4 liter made toe to toe with double biher engines and double hp .
Just enough to know how fast that car is 3:35
Pretty sure the F1 would clap both Lambo and GT-R in a circuit track or in any kind of track with laps.
What is the 0-100KPM Stats on the lamborghini
220mph💀
The driver of the gtr doesn't belong near a car with that much power he has no idea what he's doing my 6 year old son could launch that car better 🤷🏻‍♂️
That Lambo was out of this world 😭🔥🔥
Get a new F1 car
The Lamborghini is insane 😮
Put them on a track with corners and see who wins.
Never race against a Lamborghini without a rear bumper.
The Lambo is build for straight line drag racing 100% but on track the F1 is king 👑
Give that f1 another 100 horses and it will smash them both
The Lamborghini has so much turbo
Also lembo fan
And that sounds great
Bro that Lamborghini is super Saiyan fast 1200hp
That particular lambo is on top
Lambo cost 220k inc mods. A lot of money but good value for that kind of performance😮😮
I really don't like Lambos, which break easily and have high repair costs. I will approve Lambo if he wins against H2R.
MAN THAT LAMBO IS ABSOLUTE MENTAL🥵🥵
7:38 the way they passed the cameraman hitting 220 mph is just crazy
A gtr built to the pussy is never gonna beat an f1 car around any track
🔥💪
Now do it all again on the track at Silverstone 😂. By the time the Lamborghinis and Nissans completed the circuit, Coultard would be drinking  coffee at Twynholm 😂😂😂
Tht GTR needs a launch control with front suspension lowered ,cz it kinda kicks up a bit
I lilke f1 car
Lambo is beast in drag races🔥🔥🔥
Bro, this guy is REALLY enjoying himself😅
imagine Verstappen driving here 💀💀
As soon as I saw the missing rear bumper i know lambo ws gonna smash everybody.
Formula has like 10K more RPM and lost. L to this. Wasting gas more than normal cars and being slower😂
Lambo jumped the line the first two times
f1 aint what it used to be
I never thoght that the lambo had that much accseloration
This is exactly what I wanted to see! Thank you so much! =)
That GT-R is a piece of art. The Japanese created a real monster, that still holds up to modern cards, even though it's almost 10 years old now. Unbelievable specs for a road car.  The F1 is amazing. With the insane requirements, it is just astonishing how it performs. While it's not at its brightest in drag races, it is magnificent round the lap. Its engineers deserve a raise.  Of course the Lambo is a clear winner here. That was a well-deserved victory and it really has shown the beauty of both performance and beauty. Completely understand Mat's excitement.
Please know the average F1 HP is 1000+ NOT a paltry 750 - this is why F1 in this video keeps being defeated  !!!!
GOOD MORNING BEAST MAT WATSON CAR WOW CANADA ONTARIO YOUTUBE VIDEO MISSISSAUGA TRANSIT 🇨🇦🇨🇦🍀🍀🍀🍀
Matt always jumps the start, literally every race hes off before her hands have even moved
The red bull Honda F1 horsepower rating is 1100BHP
It’s a drag race.. that f1 isn’t made for that..
10:00 $$$ ⁸⁸⁸ ❤❤❤
Bring this lambo back
Es e Lamborghini vs todo lo demás
So no rear bumper = better speed?
F1 dont drag race 😅
Twin turbo Huracan 💨 all day every day ⚡
Its not fair, the f1 is using soft pirelli tyres, next time whack on some softs.
F1 definitely not for drag, but a track, f1 absolutely stomps
That f1 car was spinning wheels and couldn’t get the traction down if not it would beat all of them
f1 literally sounds like a mosquito roaming near ears while you're trying to sleep😬
wowww
why is the f1 on Hard tires
Strange race - The Lambo had more HP or the GTR was in the wrong boostmap.
Come back to this video every so often for a little motivation 😅
3:16
Who is here after Liam Lawson joined F1
Bro cope more
it’s not skyline anymore…
Why is the back showing the engine?
Omg at 7:14 I was laughing so much and hard at mat dropping the two walkie talkies 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
“I can hear the formula car comin” 💀
You laugh too much😅
The f1 car barely beats the gtr!!!!! Haaaaaaaaaaaahaaaaaaa
C est qui le pilote de la f1
That 1600 gtr would left all of them at the starting line
Lamborghini vs Supra mk4
The fact that isnt the fastest f1 so...
@the video about 6min suddenly became like female voice🚺💬🤣
will also try F2, F3 & F w series etc❓😃
the F1のsteering wheel like gamesの🎮‼️
so crazy🚗🏎️🚙❗️❗️😆
why didnt the f1 car activatge drs?
Lamborghini launch like crazy
you can hear the F1 coming but NOOOOOOOOOOOO , you're leaving xD
the moral of the story just Dont race Lambo without rear bumper :)
Best video ever existed in this content ❤❤❤❤❤
I'm quite surprise that the F1 doesn't win acutally, as it can normally go like 360km/h on a Grandprix, do you guys have the reason on this ?
En otros vídeos de otros YouTubers el gtr a ganado . Así que bueno todo depende del  conductor
🎉🎉🎉
Quite a lineup again! Loved that GTR. Huge fan of the cars thanks to GT from the good old  PS1 and 2 days
La F1 deve aprire il DRS
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😢😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
6:15 WAKE UP FLITHY
RB7 has an automatic gearbox 😮
i really dislike it when people bring F1 cars to drag races, those cars are not playthings on the drag strip, i would like to see those cars you guys like to bring to drag strips, to see how they perform around the track, do your drag races if you want but do a circuit race as well to show what engineering was put into a f1 car... this just irritates me.
Mat get this lambo with a turbo s and a sf90 in a drag race,,, can't wait to see which car wins 😅
did any 1 s aw the blue chiron ??
Mat a lamborghini aventedor s sv and svj are loud but hurican is not loud
7:13
Thank you so much🎉🎉🎉
Gtr also has a 8.9 seconds according to other sources
7:14 go so fast
I know a red gtr in texas that would destroy that lambo with ease and give the lambo a 3 second hit.
That V8 Red Bull sounds like it should sound today
Where is 2000hp gtr kids
62.5M pounds price of formula 1 car? seems you're mistaken
How is that lambo vs the gtr tho 🤣
WTF, F1 is kidding? why is it so pricey and so slowly?
Like always, the vehicles with less power shine in the corners.
The f1 car driver doesn’t know what he’s talking out. He wouldn’t win at the mile (he didnt) and he had no wheel spin on the launch starting at 50 mph. Shit car.
Fast And those aren't even 8 second cars...
your F1 driver is total crap, no chance this is happening...
That f1 car is slow normally they do 250mph very quickly
Money on the f1
Am I buggin or he didn’t say the price of the GT
What the hell did they do in that Lamborghini. It was absolutely insane!
Holy fuck that Lambo is nuts
Formula is fastest for long run
To be fair, looking at telemetric data, the 2011 Fornula 1 cars struggled to reach 200 miles per hour. I'd love to see a comparison between these cars and the 2015 Red Bull RB11, or the Red Bull RB19. But the RB11 has a quicker acceleration by far. 0-100 kph in 1.6 seconds.
Gtr and supra lover… this happens when supercars tune like you
I wonder if Nascar is faster
dude the Lamborghini sounds great and one of my favorite cars is a Lamborghini veneno and that's my Dream car
gtr kids crying
Up to 6 G’s in the corner for that F1 car, that’s fighter jet territory
Can you make a video of Nissan Patrol vs Aston Martin DBX 707?
Lambo❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
That Lamborghini is insane!!!
Really great stuff
You’are always start before the others !
Lamborghini 1200hp⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️💯
GT-R 1300hp
Imagine Max Verstappen with his current Red Bull Honda F1 car competing here.
Get up to 130 and enter a chicane in the Lamborghini.
Why do you always get the fastest car?
redbull car sound
Old F1 car
Love the F1 engine sound!
That gtr doesnt look like its have 1300HP its just a standard GTR
when you think that lambo is fast... but then : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfNzh8ENXbA
Why don't you get some simple starting lights because you always jump the start
2019 Ferrari, soft tires, drs and ers and the f1 car would beat the lambo
F1 would win if Lamborghini wasn’t souped up
GTR need nos
Funny I don't see red bull in the comments 😂
التلاعب موجود في نزاهت السباق  مقصوده منكم ان تجعلو ال gtr يتاخر وهي تملك اقوى انطلاقه
Red bull was on hards
Lambo all day every day
The  greatest race ever 💯
I like the green on the car🚗
This channel is great
That lambo is nuts!😮
250 M 😮 yeah that's expensive. also did not expect that Lambo to be so fast. I thought for sure the f1 car was gonna win.
The fact is a sedans car competing with a super cars is amazing
Remember kids never challenge a lambo with no rear bumber.... you will be sent to gapple-bees.
Third race was the best race he jumped twice
Why does everyone say 4WD INSTEAD OF AWD
F1 takes ‘em all on a circuit by 20 seconds at least, it all about corners kids.
It's a 10 year old F1 car. Pull your necks in.  Throw them round a track, F1 would wipe the fucking floor with them.
Aa- tall lol it’s “at all”
Shit race.. on a 10 lap F1 would pass them both three times before the 5th lap.. crazy contest 😅
Waiting for the F1 to destroy in braking.
F1 has downforce disadvantage on high speeds
That lambo has insane straight line speed
He jumped everytime
Fck. Bring the H2.and let's see .what happens.!!!!
Mat why don’t you do 1600hp Nissan vs 1200hp hurican
Bra that Lambo is fast ⏩
Yep
He went 220mph
LOVE THE F1
Why are screaming and shouting like it’s a close race. Clearly the Lamborghini is way faster. Just over dramatic
When she won’t stop sucking 3:51
Interesting team Lambo🔥
F1 had a massive power/weight advantage...but since it's a long straight race, at the end of the day it just didn't have enough power to keep up.  I bet even another 75hp would have made a huge difference.
my life is a lie !
Those TT Huracans are absolute demons
lambo won the sound check lmao
220 mph within 1 mile! That's bloody insane. That Lambo F*#ked of everybody!
He should have driven the Chiron against this same F1 car in his previous video
im worried about yani
i want this lambo back in carwow drag races
not even close!
I thought f1 cars could go 0-350kmph in under 6 seconds
let's introduce some acceleration vectors in every direction, otherwise good fun.
how can be this possible fastest car chiron lose to f1 and lambo win
La f1 n'étais même pas à fond !
starts were impeccable both times. Very incredible reactions bro. Although I think you kind of predicted the 2nd start nevertheless it was a correct start in my opinion and it didn't change the outcome. The lambo was the fastest of those 3 cars.
that formula 1 car was very old, older than 2018 f1 car
before watching the video I knew both of them gotta beat f1. 1300hp is no joke. vs 750. but it was close between Nissan and f1 in drag.
What if we turbocharged the f1😅😅😅
tune that formula one car for drag race and then let's see how you laugh...lol..and there was no drs
Lamborghini e la macchina Italiana . Bravo
I call BS. That f1 car would smoke the other cars
This man sits in the only car that wins.
Minecraft YouTuber interested in car now lol
Yes Matthew, you always jumo the start, because you are an immature man who always has to win and be first, otherwise your ego will not be fed. And the fact that the others won't admit that you jump the start is probably to boost and satisfy your ego.....
I wanna see on a race track,where there are corners, with all stock part😈🌚
I really like GTR ❤
American = car wow English = Kharweaouw😂
Flashlight start > Hand drop start
Would love to see that Lambo against Rimac
was this car made before DRS?
I just don't like him being a bit rude like telling prople that its not his problem rest is nice
F1 cars cost around 16 to 20 million to build to drive. Not 62 million but that includes the cost for maintenance research and other modifications and upgrades and F1 employees who matter gets paid millions
How did the lambo win against the F1 but not the chirion in anothet vid😅
I am sure that the Formula 1 car has been set to the lowest power available, and we all know how acceleration is in a Formula 1 car.
Formula 1 RB7 was in neck in neck with the Lamborghini.
1,200hp Lamborghini is the fastest car between all of the the competitors.
This is what manufacturers should be doing... If they have a 5 or 6L NA, charge it (either super or turbo, as in the case of Lambos).... and if they have a 3-4L  charged engine make it a 5-6L (as in the case of Porsche)
a modern f1 car would smash these 2 cars
3:30 diesel?
For lamborghini nissan petrol vtc then see who wins
That F1 car sounds like an effin vacuum machine!
bro im tripping balls and watched thisssssssssssss wtffffffffffffff
Lambo insane rocket ❤
We need to see that lambo vs the Rimac nevera gonna be crazy
This guy stays jumping the line damn near every time. Whole racing career is cap stop jumping the line fight fair
“Over the mile we would have the advantage over you”   *proceeds to get absolutely dropped*
❤love in jesus name
Always gtr❤
Its funny that an F1 car is worth like 100x both other cars combined lul, its just not made for straight line races obviously. cool video mate! Would love to see an F1 car without regulations go against those cars it will go like 300 mph in no time XD
❤
I am loving the F1 fans cope.
DC pissed cause he lost 😂 he's used to it. De chessoris would've done a better job!!
Lamborghini huracan in air😂😂 fastest car in the world 🔥💥💙💙
Lambo vs Rimac next…
Wtf F1 losing to a Lamborghini and gt 😮
On a race track that F1 wins lol
Huracan is Insane absolutely not Fail Product
that F1 should put off the front and rear wing to increase the topspeed
Game is👍 a good time😂 with me that god bless❤😢but I'm sorry for your loss and your friends with me and my heart
G just got back from my house is a good time for you and your family
😂
That lambo is stupidly insane nothing can beat a proper tuned lambo period !
I wonder how a modern redbull f1 car does
Gtr was last with a time of 9.3 seconds
NO COMMENT FROM RED BULL HERE 🤡
f1 tyre temps hold it back😢
Taking an f1 car out for a drag race is like telling an elite sniper to spar in hema. It’s not at all what he is meant to do
I like how the turbos on the Lamborghini are so big they had to remove the rear bumper
hahaha I have seen many of your videos, and you jump the start fairly consistently, throughout all your videos
F1 is just and angry mosquito! Love the sound nothing like it!
@carwow please race the Lambo and the 1600hp GT-R 🙏🙏🙏
Next 2004 Bar Honda F1 top speed setup 😂
Can’t believe it’s over 3mins too see the race…
Why are they drag racing on the Hard Tires, lets see the softs
Please dont do this again f1!
British English so hard to understand mate!!!
That lambo is nuts man king of the streets for a reason
F1 not designed to be fastest start off the line. In racing, F1 only take off the line only once. The most important is maintain high speed while cornering
best car channel ever
I did end up buying a 2019 Huracan in that exact color verde mantis green if I'm correct. So just ignore my previous comment lol
Thats not a skyline 😤
Mat. Your car. Is. So.   Fast.    I. Like. Your car.    I. Subscribe to. Your. Chanle
I like how the GTR was trashed.
Monza Wings........you need monza wings for the F1!!!!
Bro the Lamborghini is so fast😂😂😂😂😂
This is a old f1 bc it has no halo
I love gtr
150000£-lamborghini 26.5mil - formula 90000£- gtr  🤣 you decide
Go lambo go 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Not a lambo fans but this one bruhh cmon😮
3:27
Brooo... Try ahh milee then you gonna see the true winner
Definitely what he said 😂😂😂
Японцы делают веши!😍😍
bro jumped both times 😅
Lambo vs motogp😊
Now after using an F1 show car not prepared for drag racing, could you use a current turbo hybrid F1 car with 1000+ horsepower of 2020, 2021 or 2022?. So to be more credible?. As an engineer, I know perfectly the potential of these racing cars and I can tell you that the 2003 Ferrari GA ran 600 meters in 8.8 seconds, 900 meters in 12.1 seconds and 1200 meters in 15.8 seconds.
The formula 1 car sounds like a fly when they are near your ears for some reason lol
F1 should have won
Still confused by this match up. Traction off the line of the 4wd cars aside, the power to weight and aero of the F1 car should have netted the win I would have thought. Mental match up though and great to watch.
wow! that lambo is sick
Redbull are smart.... see how they used hard tyre instead of soft....
Who needs a house when you can buy a Lambo which incidentally the speed limit is still 75mph about on the roads you need to drive it.
That Lambo is insane..
Idk if the lambo can keep up with the current cars tho. Especially with DRS.
The lamborghini cannot be street legal with all the gubbins hanging out the rear, but is very rapid, excellent launch control 👍
F1 cars are not made for straight line speed on  a track it would destroy them
I own every car in the world and I used my F1 bruh I made a bad brake and I crashed am it have to get repaired
They should test also in a f1 track and a rally track..than we can make who is the winner
amazing
You should do the Lambo up against the Rimac Nevera any time that would be very fun 💀
Gtr is a overrated stupid car I would never buy it .
pff the f1 car is short shifting.. what a joke, If really pushing it will smoke those other cars
Matt he doesn't know how to drive.always jumps start such a loser
Gtr holding that f1 go is insane
There's no way that a 1300hp GTR got smoked that bad against a q200hp Lamborghini
That half second delay on the walkie talkies got you the gap lol. But yea f1 far would smoke both of them on a lemans track
No way did he just beat an f1
If they had computer launch for the f1 car the f1 car would most likely win
Those were perfect launchs Mat.
Tbh I thought the f1 was gonna be the victor on all aspects
Just think about how many times Matt said “ woah “
i was thinking about getting one of those F1 cars but after watching this i change my mind 😄
مخادع GTR افضل من ان تقدمه انت لانك مقهور من الصناعة اليابانيه
2019 Ferrari sf90
That lambo is quick that’s chiron and Koenigsegg territory
Mos'car'to for the F1
That’s a 2011 f1 car 7 gears and 750 hp. Race against 2022 Red Bull f1 car with 8 gears and 1000 hp. That Lamborghini would gotten smoked by the f1.
8 M 🔜
No one talking about the GTR 😑
you should try corners with F1.
Is that tuned Lambo.
people getting mad they dont realize f1 cars arent built for the max speed. of course thats important but a track isn't all just straights. f1 is speed around corners
H2r : what about me?
I always thought the F1 cars were Awd.
You should race that Lambo against that F1 RC car
Sth wrong with that f1 car...does not really perform as f1 car should. If both were 100% performing, f1 car should win.
Decade old f1 car, not setup optimum for drag race..and you've got coulthard in the seat. Says it all.  But a Lambo against 2023 F1 over a lap, say Spa and over a race?? Lambo would get murdered.
How old is that GT-R again ..but still good enough to run with the young-ens 😂
It would funny to watch these cars get dusted by an NHRA pro stock car (FYI Pro stock cars have no turbos, super charger, or NOS).
People simping over the F1 car, why tf? Literally costs millions to make and maintain one of ‘em, it’s more impressive that a 67k car and a 400k car are keeping up
Why is is every ne surrporting the f1 car it lost face it
03:49 start raceing
The Lamborghini is amazing!
I love how the F1 car sounds just like a tie fighter 5:55
Where's the Tesla Plaid? It would just eat them all and spit them out.
The f1 is also on hards not soft
why they didn't include the 0-60 times
People might be disappointed in the f1 car but f1 cars are made for going round corners in a fast and smooth motion better than a gtr or a Lamborghini could ever be
My favourite car is killing it
Tesla Plaid: Hold my Beer xD
It's just a beginner F1 car
Now race around a track and watch the F1 shine.
You should add moto gp to the same line... Fun
Why at 7:39 does it look like the gtr is going ridiculously fast ?
F1 is dead.
Legendary acceleration😯😯😯
and now one Lap at Silverstone F1 Race Track. Who do you think will win? 😜
the gtr actually when bored out is a 4.2L v6.
SMOKED that rice burner.
Lets race around the Corners. I put my money on the F1 😁😁.
Dawg they need to do a Hennessy Venom F5 vs Lambo  The F5 will kill the shit out of the Lambo
If only coulthard got in the Lamborghini’s slipstream that would’ve made for an even spectacular race!
A 5 lap race would show the true performance of the F1 car
Stays jumping lol. Also there's a delay in walkie talkies. Shouldn't be a race between drivers. Should be a race between cars. Which car pulls. Gotta keep that in mind when racing and comparing cars.
need to aducts the arreows on f1
F1 car isn't running race spec. It's a show car... also  drag racing is the  absolute  opposite  to what f1 cars are all about.
It's a pity its not a V10 F1 car :/ but very cool
One thing I'd like to see is a ams gtr alpha omega or Godzilla type tuned to its max against this Lamborghini
Now try drag racing the Benetton B186. The most powerful F1 car ever (~1,400bhp in qualifying trim).
that roll race was trash an you guys didn't even do it over.🙄
So f1 is Nat Asp.......
Strip surface had not the same grip as a track surface.
Wow wow wow 60million ?
What happened to the lambo’s bumper, how did you put the plate on
Favorite part was him tossing both radios and still winning
Bruh took the worst f1 of all time or what ??
Is that Underground Racing tuned lambo?
That lambo is utterly insane!
drag race between the 1200hp lamborghini and rimac nevera
In what world does a Lamborghini Hurácan cost 150,000 pounds (168,000 euro's)
One angry Bull !
that gtr does not look like a 1300hp car...
I wanna see a drag race between this lambo and the Rimac Nevera
If It was a lambo on a track vs a fromula car we all know the winner Also the f1 car didnt win because there not meant for drag racing
The KTM motogp bike smoked hard the 1100hp Huracan. That lambo seems a bit faster
What's impressive is the entire drag race. What's incredible is how the GTR was almost always keeping up with the F1. What's utter madness is how the Lamborghini was still holding on to so much torque 1/2 to 1 miles downwind to still win.
it's strange.. the f¹ has the best power-to-weight ratio, so it should win.. starting from a standstill, perhaps the tires lose grip but when they start to have it, it should be able to catch up with the Lamborghini.. starting from 50 miles, it should be an assured victory, but not that's it.. i can't figure out how it's possible
these people really need to understand that we understand what f1 is about no need to go defend f1 because it lost in a drag race...
Most awesome Lambo ever. Cape Town South Africa
gtr
Add a couple of corners
Coulthard's car has no grip.. try again on warm soft and dry..
all day every day
That F1 is SLOW as hell, probably due to a "shy" or a bad setting, but no excuses: V10s from 2004/2005 were stated to make the 1/4 mile in low 8s, so draw your conclusions.. A 200 hp difference at this level and with that kind of vehicle is still not enough (NO CHANCE!) to generate the time gap we can see here 😅
9:06 The Rock
Thats just prove japanese cars are bad and only are good when they modified the f out of them
Put these three cars on a race track with tight corners and the F1 will smoke them all
Tuned lambo is always better than gtr as it can hold more power smoothly with that bigger engine displacement
That Gtr should not be that slow in acceleration those tires are not it
That lambo is nuts!!
ok wow was not expecting tht HOW IS THE LAMBO SO FAST COMPARED TO F1?!?!?!
0:26 he was talking about those nuts
Should've done it with DRS on, on the F1 car.
not good more talking
Must ve a UGR Lambo
Come to Dubai and see Nissan vtc it will hang all of these cars
and it was a 12 year old f1 car with an old engine. The more modern hybrid f1 cars would be much quicker
Do you now the car with most hp if you now comment it down👍😀😀👍
The Lamborghini is sooo Awesome 👍😎; CRAZY delicious, safe speed, with awd traction .... Very exhilarating and enjoyable video. With the honorable mention for the sound of the formula 1 car! ❤️
Never thought id see a lmabo smoke an f1 car lol
2022 Formula car:- Try me😎
Well i didn't expect that 😂
I can't change my profile picture
Craaazy
Why don't you just have a headset, and get in a group call with the both of them? 🤔
The Lambo actually short shifted from 3rd into fourth during the roll race and still won. That’s bloody insane.
Dayum
I need to work tomorrow, it's late....  Youtube: F1 Car v 1200hp Lamborghini v 1300hp GT-R????  Me: Well well well then, let's find out
How would the race have ended if the Lambo had driven against a Bugatti from another episode?
8.9 sec 400m in something that can be your daily is really incredible.
Nas car please yaney
this channel just fake drag races
GTR was gaining though I thought it would win if it was a full mile drag race or  half mile 🤔
Remember that Red Bull Ad? It ends with “RED BULL GIVE YOU WIIINGS” Witch is  “RED BULL GIVE YOU WINGS”

Damn that Renault engine
Japan number one
Lamborghini with rear bumpers: 😇 Lamborghini without bumpers: 😈😤
The lambor makes the GTR look so rookie🤭🤔
Casually “it is actually David coultard”
F1 is win bugati chiron in 1 mile but why defeat with lamboghini
Saw that lambo parked at Litchfield
Wow
Lumborgini  king
👑HURACAN 💚😈
Its an embarrassment for formula for sure🤣
Absolutely nuts
Bro jumping the start twice now
This has been manipulated man
Now bring the v12 F1
BMW M5 1000hp VS 1200hp Lamborghini VS Porsche 911 Turbo S please!
You should get a 2023 f1 to race
horse paaaaws bro …
Please race that lambo vs that 1600hp  gtr from the other race you had..
Looks like that F1 car has a high down force wing.  If that's the case of course it will get destroyed.  I think it would be a lot more competitive with a smaller rear wing.  Not sure it would make the difference though.  That Lambo is really fast.
i wish it was the new f1 car
Mats reaction while rolling race of dropping the walkies and then just flying away buy changing the gear was so fast I had to watch video in slow motion by reducing playback speed 😂🤟👍😍
F1 cars do 0-200 km/h in about 5 seconds. so it also concerns the speed on a straight road. They could put an acceleration spoiler, put acceleration settings, activate the DRS system and use super soft tires... also they could put a more skilled driver in F1 and not use RedBull's F1 car.
One of the most incredible videos on youtube, thank you Mat, thank you Carwow, thank you David,..... OMG, that Lambo is a beast¡¡¡
Matt should rent a track and race the cars around it with a quali and then a race
Bruh how can f1 beat the buggati but not the lambo
Lambo vs Torota Supra Mk4😏
F1🤮
So far this Lamborghini is the only car that was able to beat this f1 car. Wow.
Hi carwow can u get your hands on the 1000hp V6 hybrid to go against the this huracan ?
Never imagined that lambo will win against F1
Nice bud
That f1 car is nuts, I had eargasms listening to it downshift💦   Also the Godzilla could have had a better launch with more a skilled driver 🥲
God that lambo! 🤯🤯
this jdm fans doesnt take fact that lamborghini better than gtr bcs its mid engine AWD twin turbo
;v https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbs2Xy1tyJM bey
No NHRA cars?
It’s strange to see none of the cars in a car wow drag race sound like they have a soft limiter and any sort of sound limiter
F1 is king 🤴
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSS BUGATTI IS BETTER THEN F1 I LOVE BUGATTI ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
its a bit unfair for the f1 its on the slowest compound of tyres in the sport
The Lambo looks ridiculous from behind with those enormous turbos, the gtr is a heavyweight, buts still looks like a proper car
Jdm blind kids should see this
Formula 1 izləyən birisi bilir ki normal şəraitlərdə F1 maşını bundan daha qısa zamanda 300+ sürətə çıxır. Burda isə 220 ilə gedən lambonu keçə bilmir?Tras,Təkər,sazlama və daha başqa şeylər.
Would never buy a lambo but if I were to get one it would have to be a twin turbo huracan nothing else
If I were the owner of that F1 car, I'd be embarrassed by how easily it's being beaten by a production car.
Yup. As long as there are no turns the lambo wins 😂. And this was, after all, a drag race.
Curious what tires the gtr had, seemed to be struggling
From where the bees comin from oh that's f1 sound 😂
Removing als the downforce parts from the formula one car would definitely make kt win
The only proper race was the last one where the start WASN’T jumped 😂😂
Vive nissan  تحيا نيسان
try and cut a corner at 250 km/s with the lambo, excellent run tho!
the Lambo absolutely destroyed everyone!
gtr is destroyed by lambo. Le GT-R  fans 😭😭😭
So this is 1 year ago, felt like yesterday, means mans life is wasting 😂
i actually wanna see v10 of f1 so sad they banned it the sound of that engine is beautiful 😍 and the downshift is thunder ⛈️⚡
I don't follow F1, so I don't know if this video is a sad indictment of modern F1 cars. Not that long ago they were racing fighter jets, now they're losing to Lambos.
Rip GTR
on a circuit though that gtr and f1 would leave that lambo in the dust.
Why is the F1 car on Hard Tires? Super Softs, with DRS, and a good driver, clear win
This is not chance to be 1,300hp gtr I cnow how it looks like 1,300hp gtr
Who drive the nissan its not good driver
GTR had not 1300hp.
I love Lamborghini
Holy shit that lambo is fast
You should remember that the formula 1 is a RWD and the Lambo and GTR are AWD it's really easier to have grip on the floor when you have 4 driving wheels  Also the RedBull il a car from the V8 period and at the period we turn around 800HP not so good at all compared to the lambo and nismo which pass easily the 1000hp
I would like to see what this lambo can do against a Chiron, although we could see in another video that F1 beat the Chiron, that would still be cool
Race this lambo against the Remac Nevera
Exactly how I knew it would go.. Lambo!!
put softs on it, youll see real speed
F1 IN 2022 IS 8GEAR AND 1000HP PLUS
I would like to se a 992 turbo s with 1200 hp
2:43 why does it sound like an electric scooter on the outside but when your inside the Huracan sounds like a monstrous powerful machine
I wonder how the Aston Martin Valkyrie would go with a power to weight ratio 38% higher than the Lamborghini (1160 HP, 1050Kg).
Love to know to cost per wow minute of this video.
I love Nissan gtr
Why not set the race up with skyline and f1 in a position that’s in front of the lambo by the distance it won so the three cars finish in a line
Dont need 62 million to make a car fast....take note F1
Future me is my grandma still amazing
After an acceleration like that you get out of the car as flat as sole...😅🤣😂
lambo faster than f1 car? please that's impossible
Lambo is the king man
This is not a race😢
Nothing here is crazy, it's all just boring math. Force and Mass, that's all. No one is surprised
The GTR is way to high😂
That is a fictional race. No a 2 times world championship winner f1 can lose a drag race.
Hahahah wat a video mat thanx you make me very happy with this video’s
I don't understand the F1 result
Definitely jumped the start. DQ'd in F1
No way that Nissan has 1300HP 💀💀💀
They should have used a 1600hp GTR
put an F1 driver in the current F1, he will be first
Drag race a McLaren f1 VS McLaren f1 gtr VS McLaren f1 long tail
I would love to see this against the h2r
6:45 "You came last right?" Nah me personally, I wouldn't take that disrespect LMFAO
What labo was it
If the f1 has launch control it wins easy
Why David Coulthard didn't open the DRS. If he would open the drs definitely beat the Lambo
Do a Classic Hatchback Please 🙏 Involving Astra J VXR 🏆 https://youtu.be/xvN8te9wmjI
Lambo wining twice until a tuned supra show up
Was much closer when you don't jump!
The Lambo is crazy but the gtr beat the formula 1 car twice also.
1200hp my asshole lol
I thought F1 cars cost between $12-$15M? My guess is the $250k is the team cost for a season, not just the car.
Wonder if the new v6 hybrids can do better with 1060+hp
Quite a few cars(like turbo Ed Lambos and other race cars) are faster off the line than an F1 car - until the first corner…..
40 million to lose like that
Lamboo 🐏🔥
Lambo Hammer 🔨
F1 v12 1995 problem
350 kmh +😳
65 million right out the window😣
Remember kid, Never ever ever laugh at Lambo with no bumper and Civic with laptop
8:00
Zamn these cars are only crazier on drag race but in race tracks, these are Triple crazier things if they are all modified stock completely
62 million car just to lose by a huracan 120k lol
Formula 1 cars are nuts 🥺🥺
Damm
F1 2020 is way faster
https://youtu.be/T5dBLGUzyJY
mph wow 212
The symphony of F1 sound 💥
The 2011 redbull f1 car, "here comes Sebastian vettel". Memories🙂🥺
GTR driver not enough for this 💯
yes the f1 has white tires if you put them on the slicks it goes much faster
Lamborguini 💪💪💪💪🤣😁
Why dont use dragster too ?
Would love to see that lambo vs the rimac
Comparing supercar to F1 in drag race is just youtube sensational and not all professional, sad to see this kind of low level content in carwow ; F1 have huge downforce model that's not advantageous for drag race, so what the hell do you think that your video is serious ?
A newer F1 car would smash the Lambo, they now have over 1000 hp and the 2011 cars were not that powerful
Ridiculous. GTRs with such power eat Lambo for breakfast. In all drag races they lose.
I saw Buzzy's lambo at a motorway service station and my 7yo just started at it lol. Very very cool.
Tambahkan motor motogp disitu biar rame😁😁😁
💪👍
They could put ultrasoft on
Why f1 car lose?
Yessir lambo won🤌🤌
#Nummber2# Best Of Drag Race#🔥🔥🔥😱😱😱🥵🥶🥶🥶👌🤙❗️❤️
Gtr is such a big lump it needs a Japanese tuned V8 fitted for ptw ratio
British is cool
This Lamborghini is faster than I thought 😲😲👍
70k on upgrades for the lambo 😂😂😂 wtf. I’d like to see it up against the veyron and konnenseig.
OMG that Lamborghini is so fast I bet dad is the fastest car in the race who thinks
Nice channel ❤❤👍👍
The fact that the F1 car beat a Chiron by quite a bit in another video really shows how fast the se two cars are!!
No replacement for displacement
7:02 which music is in background can anyone tell lplz
0-200 less 3sec in w11 mercedes hamilton
And an AWD civic beats them all...lol @Frustrateeg 7.4 sec. 1/4 mile. 😂
Hard to believe 😂
Tesla Plaid vs This 1200hp Lambo vs Ninja bike
That Lambo VS the Nevera 🐂❌⚡
Holy shit the lambo almost did a wheelie lol
Samsung
gtr🥰
So F1 cars of that era and MotoGP bikes are pretty much the same speed over the 1/4 mile.
Put it on the track with a lot of medium and medium and high speed corner, im confident that the lambo is going to be the last, f1 in first place and gtr in second
That f1 cad sounds sooooo good
How the f1 car is losing ?  While it has beaten the hyper  car  "buggati chiron"
Now try it with the F1 car having ERS, DRS, soft tires, monza aero setup, and temperature in the tires and brakes.
F1 no DRS
The redbull with monza spec wings would have been interesting to see for the drag race's results
I thought the Formula 1 car would accelerated faster and reach top speed sooner since it weighs less then the other 2 cars involved
Bruh,give David a Soft tire
Fantastic race what happen to f1 red bull too slow i though it is unstoppable in terms of speed and power. 👎👎👎👎 sucks!
Why does Mat jump the starts by that amount....
Test the same thing with RB18
Ormai le f1 😂
How many people played need for speed as a kid and watched all the fast and furious movies only to watch this and be slow and furious lol
Sometimes it just embarrassing when he tries i m better driver jokes
F1 now can downgrade their title to Formula 10..because lose to super car with upgrade engine...
My 2 fav cars vs a F1, I like gtr more and 911 is second
Just a gentle reminder that this was an F1 car in the slowest era of F1 in about 25 years. Recently they upped the HP back up to over > 1000 and thus the modern cars are FAR faster than this RB in a straight line… not that F1 is about straight line speed anyway, but worth a mention!
The Nissan GT-R is a tank between competitors and despite all this it remains a beast ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That lamborghini is an absolute madness 😦
the rolling races should be like 50mph+ make it fair for cars with less grip
it's weird that f1 isn't first and moreover it's not one of the last generation of f1 it doesn't have the arch in front of its face
That Lamborghini looks like it’s about to go into the future😂
What's wrong with your ass keeping on jumping starts, are you visually impaired going when the lady has her arms up?
I love how the Hurracans speedometer doesn’t skip numbers like most cars do like if the car is fast then make the fucking speedometer fast too
F1 still phenomenal 1.6L V6 NA and just few cars away
Now let's race on the track
Cant wait for a milege test :p
2 jump starts in a row nice
bruh? I think f1 can go to 400 in just 10sec
3:35 *Lol that annoying Mosquito that just keeps trying to follow you.* that noise though 🙏🏽🤣🤣🤣
the F1 is optimized for the 100-200 acceleration, since they never slow down to sub 100.
Is he on the hards?
Tp itu sangat keren karena F1 memiliki hp lebih kecil dari 2 mobil itu bahkan bedanya kurang lebih 500hp, tetapi ia bisa mengimbangi kedua mobil tersebut sungguh luar biasa mobil F1
The Brabham-BMW BT52 did the quarter mile in 9 seconds.  In driving rainfall. I am experiencing a failure to be impressed.
Bro the lambo just 🚀
that lambo is nuts it looks like a frankesteincreation & i love it just love it
Can You do a jdm drag race
Matt kept cheating jumping the line twice
트윈 터보의 승리!!!!!
How about bring all this three car at touge 😂
C'on dude stop destroying the best looking Huracan with the stupid stuff hanging out on its as. look at the clean original GTR lines
You can literally hear the F1 car spinning in every gear. If you ain't hooking, you ain't booking. Wrong tires, unprepared "track" and wrong front wing setup. Also, I swear those F1 cars did 1000hp. So that means it's detuned. My question to end is, who thought drag racing an F1 car would be cool? Everyone amd their mothers know this car isn't meant for drag racing. I bet oh lambo boy wouldn't be creaming his pants on a race course comparison
I believe the mighty v10 f1  20k rev engine engine with over 900 bhp could do quarter miles in 8.5 sec!  Those would smash that lambo!
That F1 car is the slowest F1 car of last 25 years: 2.4lt with 750hp. Prior F1 cars (before 2005) were 3.0lt with about 930hp. Current 1.6lt turbo charged hybrid F1 cars above 1000hp.
Original drag race. Good idea. Thanks for sharing.
tha gtr is not 1300hp
Wtf why is the f1 car are on hard tyres
🙂👍🇵🇹
That wasn't fair if you test drag race for 1/4 miles to Jdm. If you wanna see how beast gtr you should drag it for 2,5 miles.
An f1 car does not cost 62m, the 250m is the season budget including r&d and the lot. Each car costs tops 5 million.
lambo has better acceleration because of it's extra power but in top speed the f1 car smashes it and if it was the 2019 ferrari all of them will be dead from the start
Huracan: 773 HP/ton GT-R: 707 HP/ton RB7: 1154 HP/ton  Without extra weight from the downforce...
F1s do it with brakes. But a Plaid beats them for a lot cheaper, AC, stereo. Guys, those are the new Ford flathead, anachronism, dust bin. Really, legislature popping up putting your car on an app and governing the speed vis a vis GPS. IF IT SAYS 55 you do 55. Rochester, NY. Also, Car Shield already does it. OBII portal is the interface. They're after those cars.
The F1 is a toy car?
This guy looks like Trent Bolt a New Zealand cricketer.....
That f1 car got smoked 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Put slicks on the gtr,the tires are too small for 1300 hp and go race not the drag strip
First corner tho, that F1 car is leaving everyone in the dust.
Drag racing is just stupid. F1 is not optimized to perform well in that competition. Put those three on a real race track and the F1 car will run circles around the street cars.
You should make a tunned lamborghini huracan vs rimac nevera
Where is the gtr?
Horsepower to weight
Le Hennessy venom f5 :- kids are playing
What's really scary, is both the GTR and the Huracan have seen like 2000hp more than what those ones make.
Not surprising really. The F1 cars aren't made for drag racing at all. Starting at 50-60km coming around a turn, they'll blow away both of the other cars in acceleration because they don't have to worry much about stability. Those cars are ridiculously engineered, just watch an F1 race and see those cars going around hairpins at frankly stupid speeds that would send any other car tumbling into a fiery mess. The big sloping curves and straights are where the drivers like to drop the hammer and get close to their top end, then they downshift from 8th to 2nd in less than 2 seconds, go from near/over 200mph to 40mph around a tight turn and then are back up to over 160mph in like 3 seconds. Those cars are insane.
The F1 car was without drs !
Ridiculous during Grand Prix formula 1 0-200 4,3secondes
fake....
GTR left the chat
buzz lambo is fast asf
Even though it was in moist conditions that Lambo is insane.
F1 car has amazing soeed corners
As of this week. This lambo has 2200bhp
Look like bullshit.
Mobil F1 kalah ya tidak terlalu mengecewakan. Karena dia hanya 2 literan mesinnya. Sementara GTR dan Lambo lebih dari 3. Tapi F1 bisa menang dari GTR. Itu luar biasa. Belum lagi di liat konsumsi bahan bakarnya. F1 ga sampe 1 tetes itu. Sementara Lambo dam GTR udah 1 gallon..
Woww absolutely coooll the RB car. It only 2 more L, but not too bad.
sponsord by lamborghini LOL
whos the ready set go girl? she fine.
0:17 Modified, not "tuned"
Jesus love y’all, God bless, may you find eternal life through Him.
Top fuel funny car was missing from the fun....Aloha
While raining?  How ridiculous.
DAMMMMMMMM that Lambo got the berries !!!!
@manlikericky should bring his 1900bhp GTR
F1😂😂
As if he has the technique and the mechanics to build that
65Ms down the drain
Another dumb comparison
Really surprised that the Lambo blew away the F1 car.  Very impressive.
Holy Shirtbeans, that Lambo is a proper BEAST !!
This is just becouse they are racing in a  regular road and F1 car's tyres are just spining on the air most of the time.  In the right conditions. in a real racing circuit and with soft tyres where F1 car is gonna have much more grip, i dont think these cars can beat a F1 car... Also D.Coultard is not a proper driver :D give it a try with Vettel or Max
i wanna see this vs hoonicorn
3:25 his hand 😂

Just go on track. F1 eat two other easy
great, now make them go around on a track
Lambo has awd launch control etc. you can here the f1 spinning the first few seconds. The f1 isn’t designed for a drag race. Go to the track!
This is why I think lambo should be in F1
AWD not 4WD, not the same thing

Lambo twinturbo king for drag race f1 king of corners
Only thing that matters here are 4 or 2 wheel drive, weight and F1 car has cold tires. The rest is just mumbo jumbo.
No way!! That's something you don't normally see an F1 car getting mullered like that!
F1 cars push 1,000 HP now ... Still not made for drag racing. But nothing like a 15,000 RPM redline to get the blood pumping.
F1 engine revving up to 18 grand yea ya ya :D
Lambo greatnes
I WANNA SEE ALL 3 OF YOU IN THE MARSHAL'S OFFICE!!
sad that the gtr got so mutch power but it dont really looks like
David short shifting like a lady
The Lamborghini won through brute force essentially. The F1 used clever and elegant engineering to not even be that far behind. All that in a test the F1 wasn't designed for, and using not even 3 quarters of the horse power.
3rd race he didn't jump at the start so it was a better race to see what is what.
Remove the rear spoiler of the F1 that adds a lot of downforce and it could maybe beat the lambo
I want to see the SF90 in this one.
That lambo vs the Nevera make it happen Watson
How to ruin a V10 NA
This is the type of content we used to debate on while sitting on an almost falling wall in the neighborhood during summer time as kids.
*Yawn*
maybe you could try red bull's f1 car right now. theyre the fastest. at least your up against an updated f1 car
Now lets see the Lambo corner.
Did anyone really think the F1 car would win a drag race?
Take all the wings and downforce off the Red Bull and it will smoke you.
I'm pretty surprised considering Lamborghinis are sold to rich normies based on max speed while F1 cars should be designed for good accelaration as well considering some of the tracks (Monaco...)
Now give the wheel to a racing driver and try this on a real track. You will see the real difference then of an F1. Even one as old as this. Remember hybrid era F1 cars are close to 1000bhp.
"When you're the strongest in the team but also the slowest"  **GTR Crying in the corner**
bla bla bla bla.. steering wheel...haha
Take em on a road track and there would be  no chance for anything but the f1.
Why does it look like that from the back
It says 4k but looks like 720p...
You could have at least changed the start position to be fair to all.... you were at the best view with the starter... others had to twist their neck always
why does he not have hypersofts instead of hards
some poo came out..
running the F1 on cold hard compound...
Sacrilege, but how would the plaid go up against these? I think in the wet it gives the GT-R and F1 a run for it's money.
F1 machine is not a drag machine to begin with. Good luck with that lambo going from 250 mph to 50 mph and making through a parabolica.
Now put it up against a Model S Plaid!
Maybe with actual F1 cars with DRS and Hybrid Motor results would be different. Anyway, all three cars are still impressive
Gay
That lambo wouldn't have a chance on a track with turns.
why F1 car using aero setup for drage race?
lol they took a 10 year old F1 car
It's so funny to watch all the butthurt F1 fanatics coming up tons of excuses for losing a drag race.... when EVERYONE here knows F1 car is not designed for this...
Dude, jumping the start TWICE? What are you, 12?
That lambo is not that fast. Put it in a proper drag race with a light tree start we will see Matt jump early every time only reason he wins
he jumped the  first 2 launches, that is why the third was closer...
That lambo’s nuts
F1 or the gtr should have tried with the hit
if the f1 car didnt have so much downforce, even at low aero settings, it would be gone but F1 for corners
Yeah? Now race around a circuit
a Fuckin' torpedo
With prepped soft tires(tire warmers/burnouts etc..) and in qualifying trim on a prepped track, the F1 car would easily win.
The F1 was a race configuration with a lot of downforce. It was probably the only car in that line up that could've gone through a corner at finish line speed... I'm pretty sure it would've won if you flattened the wings and removed some flaps here and there.  You were probably going ~300kph at the end. So it LITERALLY is a drag race! ;)
Now take the lambo on a circuit , just for the laugh.
Also remember, that red bull had one of the slowest straight line speed compared the other f1 cars that year.
Remember kids, horsepower isn't everything
The lambo is too speee
The Lambo sound like every OP Lambo I've ever made in a racing game
Both them cars would have flogged the lambo. Try launching at the right time
Driver of gtr is in mod eco
Ich kenn mich zwar wirklich nicht aus bei Formel 1 aber 62 Millionen Britische Pfund ? Das heißt 73 Mio Euro !? Das glaub ich nicht ..... kann das stimmen ?
Lovethe old  Skyline
This gtr was not fast cos of power to weight ratio
Who did what to that damn lambo?
Huracan sounded like McQueen and F1 obviously sound like Francesco
Poor Coulthard. He can't even win against a garage car and a Japanese hatchback. Guess supercars really moved on to beat an F1 car in a straight line
That lambo is crazy fast
Title: says drag race F1 butthurt fans: no corners, F1 with corners would have won
a wise guy once told me, never race a lamborghini without a rear bumper
Made in Italy with craziness 🇮🇹
that lambo is crazy. even the bugatti chiron which has more horses couldn't even beat the f1 car
gtr had wrong settings
apples and oranges... kinda silly
Go around a corner and the Lambo will start looking like an American car.
What do we want: We want a Lambo-Nissan-f1 drag race! When do we want it: we want it now!
I miss that F1 sound.
Nissan GTR is better. Driver stupid.
Let me guess, F1 has no advantage in drag race. Am I correct?
se salta la salida todas las veces el lambo
that lambo is a bullet
Просто на F1 запретили турбодвигатели.  Поэтому мощность моторов ограничена и поэтому такие вот машинки могут обгонять формулу 1.
This is an exhibition of how limited the performance of the F1 cars are by strict rules about pretty much everything. I get why those rules are in place but one can try  to imagine the kind of performance they would have if the amount of money, now spent on achieving the most under the rules, was spent only on performance without limits. I would not how ever want to see any person drive those monsters though. (I, when tinking about it, doesn't enjoy watching people drive today's F1 cars either but that's about boredom and not horror)
Mate 😂😂😂😂😂 that Lambo looks fucking faaaaast!!!!😳
He jumps the start everytime..
The editing and commentary is stupid. IDK what channel he's on, he's crackly. If you hear him at all, he's on the right channel.
Apart from being a tad slower on the drag races than the lambo, the F1 car also has less than half the cylinder volume, because it was designed to a strict standard.  But I really would have liked to see them complete a circuit. Would the F1 car have lapped them within two laps?
You see the power of nissan gtr no need more power booster and turbo additional it can performe 😂
i mean an F1 car is not ment for drag racing so it dosnt have a good launch but get something like a rimac nevera next time and that lamborghini would be left in the dust
Get W11 in softs with DRS 0-300 km/h in less than 10 sec
I would like to see the same drag with a 2002 to 2005 f1 car with a v10 or with a current f1 car with the current PU.  But those super car are impressive!!!!!
Amatir f1 driver
Super silly to test a formula 1 car in a drag race. It’s not designed for that at all. Race the formula 1 car against the Lamborghini on a road course and the lambo will get embarrassed.
This would be a different race with the RB on super softs...
I thought it was gonna be a game
remove the wings on the F1 car, put them on Lamborghini and then try again :)
La gtr qui perd , j y crois moyen
I mean I am not terribly surprised at the results, the Lambo has lots of torque and that is a big thing for drag racing.  Also the F1 car is probably more optimized for top end running, Now I would love to see that Lambo brought over here to the US and see how it would handle a track day down at a drag strip against those tuner cars.  Naturally I would not suggest an NHRA Top Fuel dragster as a challenger, first I doubt they would allow it for safety reasons and second I dont think any vehicle can accelerate faster than those cars.
Yeah yeah yeah, but F1 lost the race :P
If you chnage playback speed to 0.25 you can see he got an amazing reaction time the first time but did jump the second time
A Superbike is missing
I was  having dream to drive an f1 car now yes if they ask me I can drive an f1 car  .
Race the same cars around monza and see how the lambo and nissan has to take the first chicane at 30km/h while the f1 car does it at 80
everyone- talking about f1 , lambo and gt-r me - thinking about a supra in the race
when i see this videos.. its reminds me that buggati chiron is as fast as NISSAN R35 NOT Fast enough,.. i believe koenisegg can do better.. hahah
this really puts in perspective what Kyle from BoostedBoiz did with a K swapped MR2 😆
dude falied in that formel, he cant even shift for gods sake.
Oh look a Honda motor going against other force induction high power engine.   F1 my ass.  That's just a class.
🤣🤣🤣🤣 funny the way he threw the walkie talkies lol lol lol
1000000000000000000000000% fake
The guy in the lambo jumps the start EVERYTIME.
I love the way David called the GTR a Skyline. That's the honest mistake of a car enthusiast.
Try Competing against W11....
Кто им даст настоящий заряженный болид...
I did believe the F1 car would take the race, those cars are all insanely quick!! The results were closely the same every race.
So what is the point in having double HP and being faster? I don't get it!
Now do it around a track and watch the F1 destroy them.
It’s funny tho you can’t hear lamborgini’s exhaust when running alongside the RB f1 car!
cheating at the start
i think if they use the V10 formula 1 would have won
If the person who was driving the GTR knee how to drive  snd/or dlesrlt wasn't letting Lamborghini guy win would've won easy.mot accurate at all the Leonel driving the regular cars.  Just regular peoppe whondomt know how to drive the cars properly
WOW!! That Lambo just f**ked off.
The Lambo had a head start
acceleration = (pushing force - drag)/weight A 750 hp F1 car still can produce acceleration almost equal to 1200 hp Lamborghini & 1300 hp GTR, this explains how crazy aerodynamic body he has

Met I have a question. In this video: https://youtu.be/8lxDUEgGly4 you said that the 1000 hp bmw m5 is now the fastest 1/4 mile in 9.0 seconds in the history of the carwow, just like the porsche turbo s. But in this video: https://youtu.be/wekl2gAvkrU Nissan GTR set a record for passing 1/4 mile in 8.9 seconds. Why then don't you name this gtr as the fastest 1/4 mile car in carwow history?
Downforce kills the F1 car in drag races
F1 car looked like it had no grip off the line. It’s probably because the tires were cold.

Set up on GTR could have been better
Put verstappen next time in the car he will win easy 😆
They got that fast and furious editing lmfao Each one of those cars apparently has 35 gears
No need to make excuses for the f1 car, most people know what it's strengths are. However I might add that the 750hp is a limit imposed by the rules, to stop hp arms races and for track safety. There were brief periods in f1 history where they were over 1000hp before regulations reigned them in
Now do a single corner
Impressive now try that carbon free.

Why F1 car is not using DRS?

I miss this F1 sound
Why hère thé GTR cross in 9 second but a m5 competition béat him un 11second un other videos
Why has the f1 car hard tyres
This is unfair. its wet and the f1 car is on hard slicks. And is also rear wheel drive. You can hear the wheel spin and him short shifting.
f1 เกียร์ชิดเกินไป เกียร์หมดอีก
You're in a lambo with 1200 hp. If you didnt win id be more amazed.
Hes on hard btw go soft
Twin turbo huracan>Any JDM
uh you know F1 cars not made for drag racing?
F1 CAR IS FOR LAP RACE
F1 CAR IS FOR RACE
In the break test you can really see what the F1 car is made for incredible traction allowing for much faster breaking, the F1 car has a lot more air resistance than the 2 sport cars, those wings are working hard
why did you did a false start EVERY time??, look at the slomo, you set off waaaaaay before she moved her hand
"Lamborghini>f1>Bugatti>Nissan hyr"
Bi turbo 🥹
Chiron(2.5 million) got smoked by F1 and this Lambo smoked F1. In short, 70 grand worth of tuning is all you need.

I wanna see a race of that Lamborghini with the new Bugatti....
Btw that f1 car is old compared to the 2020/2021 versions
it's all lies!!!!  better at everything  GTR
I love these races, I think though that Dani Pedrosa on the red bull Moto gp bike would dish out some gapple pie against these. Maybe not on the quarter mile where he’s struggling to put power down but definitely on the roll race’s. Would love to see it.
Buzz lambo 1/4 mile 8.9 second
Gtrs and their imaginary hP numbers
super dreg
Red bull is cool for allowing their cars and bikes to have some fun for us fans. Great channel wish I got paid to drive those cars.
what happen to gtr he is slow 😥😥
If the gtr was moded it would have won
The f1 car was wearing hards
Please do a Lamborghini Urus off-road
Remember when you used the NISSAN GTR with 1600 hp and you did the quarter mile in 8.9 Seconds same has the Lamborghini in this video I think you should do a NISSAN GTR with 3300 or 3500 hp vs that Lamboghini I would love to see that 😁
nice actring ;) lol ...
Holly Macaroni!!   That Lambo makes it's own pasta dish in just 8 seconds. 😂😂👍👍  Who's ready to drive one?? 😂😂👍👍
F1 looks like it's not trying, shifting early and no big revs.
Okay so that F1 was there just for fun we all agree on that we know what’s going to happen to it but wtf is wrong with that r35 Who ever toned it just Focked it up like all the way up come on bruv and that lambo is madness it’s toned perfectly
i really wish the aero was on lowest and “rfa” the drs for that car was used🥲
Imaginate tener un auto tan rapido que haga parecer lento a un f1 😅😵‍💫😵‍💫
F1 car was not going anywhere near flat out
Lambo for life
U must add Usain Bolt to this race 9.8 sec
Just driving process
As i knew,  1. Lamborghini,  2 F1, 3 nismo, now all 3 are fast vehicles but SERIOUSLY,  a Lamborghini with 2 twin turbos,  really,  even superman might be like yeah that car is fast!!!!!
Nothing compares to the turbo Lamborghinis. If it’s made by Underground Racing, there isn’t a car around that will beat their setups.
can you please race this lambo against a plaid model s? i want to see something 🤔
ngl but all the cars rly sounded like my toy rc car at its full speed haha...
Lamborghini support by Audi :)
I think that f1 car is definitely broken and I'm no mechanic
What is the delay on the walkie talkie? Shouldn’t they have someone else count it down. This give the guy counting advantage everytime. Makes sense why everyone is always behind in launching. Always off time. Oh well tho. Don’t think the lambo hop is true either. Shouldn’t be pulling the gtr that bad from a roll Atleast.
Bro kept jumping starts
Hi
What???🤣🤣🤣🤣 F1 LOSE 😂😂😂😂😂 so sadmesss PROTOTYPE
Hi Matt. Would it be possible to give some fuel usage statistics? Do you you full tank when drag race or just small amount say 5 gallon?  As this adds weight etc .. And on a drag run how much is actually used per car run ..? In anticipation  Many thanks  Mark  From Derby
Would be good to see them in a loop or curly track, not at a straight distance
U have to race this lambo with tesla s pd
Is this the same f1 car as the video from 26 Jun 2021 Bugatti Chiron v F1 Car: DRAG RACE ?
IN THE ROLLING RACE THE LAMBO HIT 220 MP/H
I love Lamborghini even more than I did before I saw this
Really they nerfed the GTR to make all the invested money on the lambo look worth haha
What lambo with 750hp does a 1/4mile in fixing 9.2 seconds lol. He would out brake you, then out turn you, every corner he would enter faster and leave sooner than you would. It's not setup for top speed plus it's 750hp. Imagine if it had 1300hp. It wouldn't even be fair.......  His brakes aero tires all put you guys to shame.....  750hp GT-R or lambo would not do no 9.2 quarter lmao... Don't care what anyone says...... And it also sounds the best. I think I came a little bit.... Oops
That f1 car sounds so strange.
Gtr is semi sports car
Formula 1 sound 🫶🫶🫡🔥
F1 no stereo what a bore
I already know the F1 car is the fastest car
Need to feature the Rimac and the Ferrari SF90 with these!
Now try it on a track
Lambo vs Ducati MotoGp please
You should have the 1600 hp gtr race that 1100 hp huracan since they did the same quarter mile(8.9)
Honestly, I got to give it to that Nissan....pretty weighty BUT really keeping up insanely. If they had another 1 Mile to go, that GTR would likely nail them both. Damn! But that Lambo is INSANE. Nice video!
Waou monstrueux se dépare arrêter mes ses sur 1 tour de circuit que je voudrait voir sa mes sa  m'étonnerait ( bonjour suite au nouveaux DLC de polyphonie créateur de grand Turismo 7 un petit rappel et pour les fan de granturismo petite vidéo ses juste un départ arrêter pas en circuit de course sur 1 tour ? )
but kan you beat a supra
*Thats definitly what he said*
If the f1 car was in a setup from Monza it would have won
F1 vs MotoGP
I wonder what would happen if the f1 used DRS
Notice how the f1 car does not have soft tires, is not using DRS or ERS
If you’re not in the 9s, you’re nothing nowadays. Great race
Know what we need? Rimac Nevera vs this tuned Huracan
Comparison not accurate, a F1 isn't meant for drag racing. Nothing on earth is faster than a F1 in corners, these are just pure killing machines. Btw, a "nowadays" F1 would have destroyed both the lambo and gtr, 4.5 seconds for the 0-200kph seems unreal but is real.
❤️
Matt did u have autoshift in that car?
Should have done a 0-100-0 run
Put in the Rimac Nevera
WTF... F1 ...Häää.   Was heißt hier Drag Race, das muss ein F1 Wagen doch schaffen ein SerienFahrzeug im Start zu  vernichten
Either the gt-r, or Lambo driver are lying about there hp numbers.. that should have been about a dead even race
Do around Silverstone... F1 will be 25vseconds faster
Ok genius.... throw a few corners in the mix....
I  want   a      GTR NI    49   at    the   Blue house
It's crazy how a *62.5 MILLION* dollar performance engineered F1 race car barely beats a GTR and gets DESTROYED by a 220,000 pound lamborghini.
F1 makes the most noise
no drs?
do this with the tesla model s plaid. it's got a claimed time of 8.8 in the 1/4 mile
This lambo vs chiron....
I saw all the races on youtube. No sports car could outrun the Nissan GT-R in the quarter mile... This proves that the owner of the channel is a liar and a forger of the facts
2011 F1 cars were pretty slow in a straight line, repeat this with a 2016 F1 car that tops out at 370kmh not the 330kmh of the 2011 car.
That Lambo is insane
FAKE ASF!
Stop cheating mate 👎
Put that engine in a VW golf and some good fat tires, voila, you got yourself a 2 to 1 car.... its going to be running like a go-kart on steroids.
F1 is not in shape or would never lose.
That lambo is so loud but all you can hear when they are racing is the F1 car haha.
You need a 3rd party calling go because A. Radios have a slight lag when you talk through them and B. Because you know exactly when to hit the accelerator where as they would react slightly later due to human reaction time. This is a sport where tenths of a second matter immensely. Love the content, but it's not quite fair.
Pretty sure I saw James may roast that Lamborghini for it's exposed rear... And I agree. It's stupid.
The dude in gtr simple cant drive
Drag races are for fast cars. F1 races are for fast drivers.
This was completely unfair for the f1 car. It was raining and he was on hards he also had cold tires

I have question why haven't you guys tell us about the torque of the f1 car for a long time? 🤔
But for a price, I would go for gtr
220 mph 🤯
My love Lamborghini
I love this Lambo. My favourite.
That f1 old version
Can we see a lotus used in a race?
id still prefer a GT-R over a Lambo
Bullshit ! F1 have 4s to 200km and 7s to 1/4
Imagine matt put 2 turbo's on an aventador svj then this will be wayyyy faster
Did he say championship cheating?? :P
Good God that Lambo is FAST!
Lambo ❤️🔥🔥🔥
he jumped the start twice in a row
even the gtr, the last on drag was on 9s secs..that is still insanely quick
i really appreciate you
i really like your videos great work matt and your team
Just imagine the massive bragging rights to say that your car beat a Formula One car
When mat launched the lambo it looked like he was gonna poop his pants
😂😂😂😂
stop the cap
He jumped it twice! But still, that fucking beast flew!
With drs on f1 car has no match
F1 costs what ????? Hooooooiiii
Can that lambo vs a 911 turbo s
Gtr is the cheapest car but the consequences were almost the same wow
Do lap race with these cars, please.
formula 1 is hella sick!!!!!!!
Get the hoonicorn involved in this
a 550 hp difference  to make the F1 car look slow in a straight line ....... throw these same cars on the track at Nürburgring and the F1 car would lap these cars , even with professional drivers behind the wheel ....... the most powerful race cars of all time were F1 1100-1200 hp and the Can-Am monsters 1500 hp ....... and there was no techno bullshit on those cars , no turbo chargers or super chargers just brute HP and monster torque .....
F1 is glorified go carting they're meant for maneuverability at the expense of some speed. It performed well.
All the F1 bootlickers making excuses for a 60 million dollar car that gets smashed by a street car🤣
Lamborghini destroy this formula 1 Car ✌️✌️
Just a reminder that the Bugatti Chiron got gapped by the f1 car...
It's not everyday you see a Lamborghini and skyline dog walking a f1 car it really doesnt happen all that often.
They should have switched the drivers to see which car is really faster and that's it not about the driver
I never thought that a production car could compete and WIN a Formula 1 car. Excellent! I know now what is my next car.
Nul. Une.formule 1 peut monter à 400kmh.. ca dépend juste des réglages.

So F1 is slower than Lambo... They should race in Lambos in F1 GPs
Nissan GTR is like poor people's super car, it's fun and all but why would you buy it?
He definitely jumped the start TWICE 😂. Lambo was still crazy though
Try vw golf  from boba
The f1 car needs warmer tyers
I was never as excited for gtr
Would like some real race (circuit racing) on these supercars with formula 1.
F1 Engine cost more than dozens of this cars😂😂😂
Remember kids. A car designed to be extremely aerodynamic and to be fast as fuck around corners with less than 800hp just kept up with a super car with over 1k  hp and an extreme sport car with also well over 1k BOTH BUILT to be quicker in a drag style race. Now imagine red bull did some adjustments to make the F1 car a drag car rather than a lap car..it would probably smoke both of them fast ass beezys. These three cars are fast as fuck. 9.3 seconds being the slowest fucking racer proves wtf I just said cuddy holy shit this is damn near some rimac navera level competition
Wouldn't the f1 car do better with the drs open?
Top❕ Lambo Hulk 💪🏻🏁
Displacement definately helps. More torque, the f1 car had no chance in the drag race.
F1sounds like an rc car
2020 F1 car 1/4 mile probably from 8.3-8.6secs, 2016 F1 car roll race 230mph. GG.
If only the gtr was the 1600hp one from the other video
mat looked really scared at 3:38
Awd not 4wd 2 different thing great video though
I don't know how the 1300 hp Nissan lose
That lambo was going 350km/h just nuts
Wish they had the drs wing open probably would have helped
For all those who say: "the F1 is for a racetrack not for drag race, With other kind of tires The F1 would be faster, the F1 etc, etc.." OK WE KNOW!!!! But THIS TIME, THIS is the race. If you wanna see an F1 winning the race at all costs, watch the fucking Grand Prix. goddamn.
H2r Kawasaki is the best
Imagine they raced the night fury gtr
Lambo with bumper delete and twin turbo 😳
I absolutely LOVE this channel!!! It reminds me of Top Gear (but of course the British original version with Jeremy, Hamster, James May & The Stig); the American attempt sucked profusely on so many levels). Self-effacing humorous presenters with fact-loaded content and excellent imagery. WELL DONE EVERYONE!!!! I will recommend to all & sundry!
Lamborghini is queen of sports car  , who agree
3:45 the f1 gave me gooosebumps
The F1 car VS the 1200hp Lambo VS the Rimac Nevera would be mental.
How in the hell does one push 750 horsepower out of a 2.4L NA V8. My mind is thoroughly blown
Everybody is cheering for r35 lol 😂
🇩🇿❤️🇹🇳
The F1 car should be fitted with either hypersoft, super soft or soft to show it's max speed
Should have also got dodge demon hellcat. Thats 9.13s for  a quater mile.
How many gears does that f1 has lol?
Wow what was wrong with the Chiron that raced the F1 car? Everything going for it on paper but no balls to back it up. That Lambo is insane.
Wy si not runing with the DRS open ???
if that red bull had launch control and traction control like the others , wins easily
But power of the Lamborghini insane 😱😱😱😱
so true
Absolutely love the sound of the F1 Car
It's really unfair to place an F1 in a drag race vrs 2 AWD supercars with double the HP. race them without the AWD and I'd wager the F1 takes them every time even with half the HP.
Dang. So 2in turbo lambo hurracan out accelerates an f1 car
Gaddi lamborgini
I love the opportunity to be in the ra

That F1 must be nerfed🤣
let's take the mercedes 2020 and open drs and use the battery boost that's a 1050hp now not 750
F1 😍👍🙂
why f1 car is on hards?
Do a race between chiron and this Lamborghini
All it took for me to jump on this video is F1 vs! I wonder what that F1 car is worth today? Thanks for the awesome videos and the humor! :-)
All F1 fanboys wining in the comment section lol
That lamo is fast
When the last place gets a time better than 99.5% of other cars
lambo is my dream
What?   No rolling start race?   That’s what 90% of random street races are.
The F1 car sounds like a mosquito
Wait for vtec honda
F1 cars are not meant for outright speed and acceleration they are designed  to go around corners super fast and be able to stop super fast. Put all three of these cars on a race track and the F1 car would thrash the shit out of the other two.
The lambo is not factory
do it again but with a V12 lambo
Mat has never been so scared in a car hahahaha
How the hell is the Lambo so much faster in the first 1 second?  It seems all 3 cars have relatively the same acceleration afterwards but that first 1 second the Lambo always leads by like 20 meters.
For Some Reason I Don't Believe This Race I Would Think That The F1 Wouldn't Lose Like That.
That car is like  *Ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhh ahhhh æ*
F1 car sounds like an RC car.
Smarties are idle talkers who have never seen a gtr in their lives. St2 gtr is outdated. 700ls ceiling. Can be more. 840 on stock components. not safe. Enough for a couple of races, it will bend the connecting rods. Enough to punish F90. I'll say this: The best car before tuning st2 f90 100-200 5sec. (Replacing turbines for a motor cunt costs like the floor of a car, tuning the motor will cost like two new ones) The best car up to 1000ls Audi rs no need to climb into the engine. (Replacement of turbines and drove off. It is no longer safe to have a motor) The best car from 1000hp and above 1500.1800.2000.2200.hp of all time since it came out gtr p35. Until now, on anlim gtra in the grid, they fuck everyone and Porsche and Audi, and everything that moves is moved and fucked. Porsches and Lambo 1100+ hp in the grid with gtra merge immediately in the first races. Unlim open and see there some gtry. They haven't been allowed in lately. For gtro tougher rules. Frame. The car is not older than 3 years, just to prevent gtro from going there. Because it's boring. The first grid, gtry all otebli and roll among themselves who is faster. As for the Porsche. St2 922/911 rides with dignity. But this fucking bucket of st3 just doesn't hold well. Lvl performance in batches changes their blocks. Simply in batches. The box over-praised on st3 bounces. And there, tuning components is ten times more expensive than gtr components. Not only that, they don't exist. And gtr, if you buy grandmas, from a cartridge to a condom, a tyunachka. I hope I explained clearly. So that the farts do not bomb. St2 f90, pors. st3 audi St4+ only grtr.
I think the F1 would do better if it had a formation lap to warm the tyres first
F1 car would reign on a track, but that Lambo is just too powerful lol
now try all those 3 on a circuit
that's cringe af, this guy mat shitston is cringe
can you do audiq5 vrs mercies gle400
That Lambo is insane
The runway is to short for the gtr
Who else wants this tuned Rimac Nevera vs f1
There was something wrong with that Gtr because a Lambo never wins from the start to a Gtr
That Lambo is insane
Bruh 63 M for a car i had no fuckin idea 😳😳😳
There are faster gtr's  ....hmm
Lambo r the fastest😇😇😇😇
That Lambo is Kwik!
Rimac nevera runs 8. 60
2005 v10 f1 would have creamed the lambo
Gtr wins in reality, by a massive shot.
When Senna won his first world title in Formula 1, his McLaren had 1200hp with a Manual gear box. I believe Formula 1 limited the HorsePower on their cars for safety reasons. Check the video “Ayrton Senna | Top Gear Tribute”.
Still wild that Lambo has been rather anti turbo for the longest time while still producing some of the baddest rides out there. Imagine if they turbo charged the Aventador V12 from the factory, or even quad charge it like a Chiron
F1 can still brake the fastest so there's that
Imagine a brake test if the F1 car had heat in its tires and brakes 😳
What about this lambo all day every day vs Porsche 911 turbo s
Take an F1 Car from 2000,2001,2002. In this Time an F1 was more faster, 0-100=2.5 sek, 0-200=4.5-5 sek.
now engine swap biturbo charged lambo engine to the f1 car🏎🏎🏎
They should have used an F1 car with little to no drag like they used to make the record.
I wonder how the modern era f1 cars perform.
I bet that lambo has a syvecs ecu kit. traction control against that AWD is godly
I would totally shit my pants in any of these cars
Good Video
Rambo jumps twice
As this ad goes through, I will absolutely only be watching all 10 mins of this for the 10 second clip it should be. So here’s a comment and a like for your algorithm
Acceleration tune for F-1 Gearbox, not to top speed.
I have a very interesting question would the green lambo keep up with Ken block's Hoonicorn?
What a great video
62 million for an F1 car?! Yeah, F1 is definitely a money laundering operation
matt this lambo vs the 1600ho GT-R please
The F1 could win just that the wheels cause 25% drag per wheel cause it doesn’t have anything to deflect the wind and the AOA  wing is just more drag the lambo just have better aero the faster you go the more resistance
Do this Match into a real circuit
where is 2000hp nissan patrol >:-(
6.99 subs
The amount of drag created is similar if not stronger than the lift most aircraft get to take off
Nothing beats the sound of the formula 1
YESSSSSSSS!!!!!!!
gooooooooo matt
bro
the 1695hp gtr put w16 and my mom put w16 and wii buy it 1m
yes and 1200hp gtr
bro bc is he
and nap A
mat is 900m hp buy it why
"Matt Watson? From SuperMega?"
My  mazda 6   100+  hp   Goes plenty fast enough and I can carry 5 people..   Anything faster i would have speeding tickets Probably daily
Get a 2022 f1
Go on a normal race trace with the cars
My question would be if the f1 tire were warm or not
Lol. Matt jumps every start here. Not even a fair test,,  the f1 car would win every test here if tyres where warm and matt didn't cheat as normal lol..
13 year olds: nah thats staged the GTR never loses
Huracan Costed 220,000 and beats the f1 car  while the bugatti costs 2.2 Mil and got beaten by F1 car
Do it around a track next
I went to the comments to see if jdm fanboys would throw a fit ab the gtr loosing
Now do that on a real track and watch why the F1 is king. You wont be able to make the turns as fast, the downforce is insane in the F1 car.
to think there are street builds that can go toe to toe with a formula 1 car.  source: there’s someone in my area that has a gtr with forged internals and a big turbo. dude claims the setup is capable of over 1000hp. given the few races i’ve seen it looks like he runs north of at least 800hp most of the time.
GTR is my life
F1 car was on hard tyres thats why he came second
that lamborghini a re insane D: oly sh¡¡¡sh
Imagine doing 9,3 in a quarter mile and still lose
F1 on hard and without drs lol
Every single run the Lambo jumped the gun. But this must've been amazing to hear.
Take that f1 car off the Hard tyres and put it on the softs, that's the real reason it lost
Yrtt
An 8.9 1/4 on an unprepped surface is pretty nuts for a street car
It's cool using a 2011 spec F1 car, good luck getting the same results against a model that's not a decade old ;) That F1 would have done a *lot* better on soft tires too, the C1 (white stripe) is the hardest tire they have and definitely not a good choice for this bumpy quarter mile.
A lil bit more and he was flying!!
F1 cars are more like 1000 HP with electric motor active.
Okay now give DC the soft compound tyres and tell him to open the drs and let's see who comes out on top
Dat LamBo is Nasty… Two Turbos got it all the way Geeked up 🆙
if only they used a F1 car from the 2000's
Can we have a real 1200hp gtr and nit this fake one seriously ...
The driver of the GTR sucks
Best drag race.
Tuned Aventador Super Veloce Jota SVJ.
The GTR could've defeated if not for the road legal issues
For being a stock block and transmission those tt lambos just boogey 😭😭😭😍
would like to see F2002 in this drag race
No $10,000 sport bike thrown in there to show you how cheap speed can be if you are crazy enough to do it?
I'm responding to your question Ananyadeep
Me
What about the DRS for f1 car?
Twin turbo lambo vs 1600hp gtr vs rimac. The best race ever
that f1 v8 😞
Put the Plaid in there
That lambo is so so nasty!!! 🤤
Can we just appreciate Mat went over 220 MPH just for a 1 mile
If i recall, the Stradale completed in 9.1 second. Now im itching for F1 and Stradale drag race!
Am a big GTR fan but damnn that Lambo is fast af🔥
I can only imagine a modern F1 car with allegedly 1000bhp and some soft compound tires. Something else to consider is that the F1 cannot get up to proper temperatures without running some hot laps so the cars performance is in all reality even more impressive than we witnessed here! Oh yeah, that Lamborghini is effing nuts!
DRS needed for the F1 car
Gaping the F1 is insane 😂😂😂
Put them round some corners and see who wins
F1 should've used soft compound.
This is a joke.  The title should read….. how much can you de-tune an F1 car to let a road car beat it.
If you install a small into the formula 1, you can see a huge different compare to those 2 cars.
That was amazing!  Thank you so much for making this video!
1 GTR 2 F1 3 Lambo
Lambo is monster
BRUH THE LAMBO IS AN ACTUAL FRICKIN ROCKET 🚀
I would be interested to see what gear ratio was used on f1 car as well, I bet it wasn't set up purely for drag racing....
The Doppler effect from that F1 car is so beautiful. My god
Love you mat
f1 is slow😢
0:02   F1 car will win, bets are 10 vs 1.  :P 3:58  Fck i lost
the F1 is on hard compaund and cold tyres. the lambo is awesome
Dostum sen hep gaza da frene de yarım saniye önce basıyorsun hiç adil değil...
Does it use DRS?
holy moly! :-O
F1's are designed for braking, traction and speed through corners.  On a road course it would destroy both of these amazing cars
I’d really like to see the IndyCar and a supercar or Hypercar do an indie style race Formula One style race formula 1🥇 car will eat everything up🤔👍🏻
The green🥰 Lamborghini beautiful car powerful as hell👍🏻
😎Formula 1 IndyCar👍🏻🥇
U wasted my time from carwow
Ok. Sold. I'll buy the Lambo!
Why cot the f1 car use drs ?
And the F1 car was on hards. Lambo is insane
Please race a koenigsegg!
The Lambo and Datsun are one trick pony's. Remember F1 technology is the starting point.
Yes the Lambo and Datsun ( Nissan) did well but.... What about more than a quarter mile? Lap after lap after lap after....?
Three wins but three false starts
that lambo just launched like a bloody rocket
He played with the air
A well trained ear can hear the F1 is not going at max rpm, if they took out a bunch of downforce it would eventually beat those!
v8 f1 is the worst f1 engine of last 30 years but ok
OUR CHAMPIONSHIP CAR IS NOW ~Lamborghini~Hurracan~Turbo~S~
good drag mans
Seems insane to do 200 mph with literally 0 safety equipment
How many weight for Lamborghini?
So, when you don't jump the start, it's much closer but DAMN that Lambo is a Beast !!
Damn f1 cars are slow
6:15 sounds just like the beginning of stop breathing
28 300 000 000 forint egy forma 1-es autó? Az 28 milliárd 300 millió? Jól értettem?
Look how close it was when he FINALLY DIDN'T jump the start... also now let's go do a lap, even just an oval track & let's see who's quickest. Christ cannot believe I am defending a redbull 🤦‍♂️
If the f1 car was on soft tyres though
1st start: 3:27 2nd start: 4:43 3rd start: 5:37 starting from second gear 7:06 hope this helps someone
Lambo still faster,..
Funny
It's 1500 hp versus 750 hp Formula 1 cars are restricted for safety reasons.
I was surprised to see the lambo smoke the f1 car every time.
F1 cars are designed to take corners fast. not drag:)
If you tune a car to purposely be faster than an F1 it's going to do just that 🙄
First video. Nice stuff.
The F1 is not 62.5m. The 250m is counting all the expenses for the entire team, including salaries, tires, spare parts, and etc. Im pretty sure cost of the car is about 10m.
question for a friend, is that lambo street legal, and regardless if it is or not where can I purchase one.
really? Lambo leaving the Red Bull F1 car on a rolling start. obviously fake or maybe the F1 driver had 25% throttle, lols.
Insert 1 single corner and the F1 car will be heaps ahead.
I can see the point of WOW factor of beating a "F1"... but it is a drag race, isn't keeping the DRS open (at least) a less dumb idea? 5:59
Did he not say the price of the gtr?
Much closer on the run he didn't jump the start
Put in a few twisties and the F1 car would leave the Lambo for dust.
Absolutely beautiful false start
Now imagine a v10 F1 with somewere between 850 to 1000 bhp. Man i miss the early 2000's.
Green Bull > Red Bull  Nah I’m jk lol I know what F1 does… But sheesh, that 🐑 is a 🚀
Congrats Matt. You did all this testing without any PPE. Brilliant.  Oh, BTW, an F1 car can do over 100 on a 90 degree corner. Test that with an Lambo.
BRB selling everything I have for a TT lambo
people bending over backwards to support the f1. WHY it is slower is irrelevant. it just is. period.
Es evidente que el gtr esta en desventaja ya que pesa mucho mas que ambos, de poco vale tener mas 100cv mas
ok but now make a comparison in the curves if the Lamborghini can handle it 😂
I saw GTR , I clicked
even before the racing begins...HP:Weight is the answer
拐个弯你就知道什么是爷爷了
The point is, even though Lamborghini fast as hell, it can't compete in formula 1 championship, on the other side Lamborghini doesn't have downforce so Lamborghini can't go 150mph over the corner
You jumped on the first 2 runs pretty bad...  The 3rd and final drag race was a proper start, and the Lambo won. F1 cars or Indy, are not geared for a drag race.  They also don't have any traction until they're going fast enough for their aero to create down force. So having an F1 car drag race will never be fair, and instead just a gimmicky addition of content.
Definitely staged....
Even 1 turn and we see what F1 cars are about.
i think they missed the launch by a split second. the lambo shifted weight first
Imagine 2020 or 2021 f1 car
Best of the best!
The fact the F1 car was beaten like this just perfectly demonstrates how bad F1 has become.
if they allowed full ERS Deployment, DRS Deployment and Softs. It wouldn't be a challenge for any F1 Car, especially the Williams
that lambo is somthing else
That's not fast enough to f1 car
Whites?  If memory serves they are the hard compound.   Run the reds and see what happens.
6:00 😆😆
I love the fact that the gtr is the benchmark to most races. Yes it's doesn't win but man I would still choose it over the others.
We have all sinned and fallen short of Gods glory and we are deserve hell but Jesus Christ died so we don’t have to go there just repent and believe
3 races, 1 real win! first 2 you jump started so....
Id like to see this race in Monza where its mostly straights with a few corners.
nice staged video......
Matt you should do Alpha 16 GT-R
Get a newer version of an F1 request
Can you race the 1200hp Lamborghini vs the Rimac car. That would be intresting. Please make a seperate video of it. That will exactly show which car is more powerful and fast.
that 1300hp is DOG slow hahah
That role race was STUPID 😂
Daaaaaaaaaaang that lambo. Never actually seen one in any kind of a race
Not being funny none of this guys drags races are fair either he jumps the start or the the other drivers cant launch.
Now put them on an actual race track with turns and and F1 car absolutely embarrasses the other two.
Super
That lambo is nuts!
Be interesting if there was a bend at the end of the track there, and see all 3 cars turn at 150 mph.
Surprisingly the first 3 digs were exactly the same result.
Only in a world with a F1 and an insane Lambo would a 9.3 be sneered at haha what a race
first time Watson won the brake test
...power to weight ratio of a certain car in this pack is just off the grid.
lol you ok hun? subbed......
he jumped the gun the first two races - 3rd race was much closer
Bullshit.
Surprised the Red Bull car didn't fare better. Interesting. Start chucking these cars into turns or a braking contest though...
For sure the gtr on the low boost setting
Also try a drag against this ;)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQmSUHhP3ug
Drag races are fun, but both cars would be absolutely destroyed by the F1 on track ;)
What’s crazy is that F1 car is 10 years old and it’s still outrageous
someone talk about that chonky gtr keeping up
The drag race usually is belong to modified supercars  But the brake testing always F1 cars because lighter
Throw the same spec tires on that GTR and it would be a whole lot closer
haha, easy comparing 10 year old f1 car. lol...
looks scripted..f1 car's driver is paid to slow down a bit..Lol
you should race agains lewis hamilton😁😁😁😁
GTR w8  like 1 sec to start. kkkkkkk
Faking the revving in the red bull lolll
F1 car forgot his brake
It's all about Aerodynamics , not about engine power,  didn't you guessed why it's rear wing cost 750000 $ , because Aerodynamics babe
This guy has no idea what tuned means 🤦🥺
Wow that's impressive by the Lambo , but H2R (stock) blasted the Lambo over the 1/2 mile and 1 mile, that's really impressive on a stock bike
Bullshit
What is the 0-60 for the lamborghini?
I dont get it why are f1 are so much more expensive than Lambos and so on ..
Gotta love Italian engineering. ;-)
Welcome to Full movies 🍿🎥 https://youtube.com/channel/UCuw_VMqP7t8HkkqE3J_Ma8g
Crazy Cars!
Bit disappointed in my gtr
7:38 how they look outside😧😦
How can a $60 million F1 car be beaten by a $150k car?
thoguht f1 was gona smoke them
GTR and F1 was close thinking F1 would win
please do drag race between this lambo with rimac nevera
Fake
The F1 car is not made for drag races. It's not designed to go fast in a straight line
Why is it so much 62million jeez
Absolute rubbish
wow
Gtr driver mod asap.
Is THE same f1 car all THE time ..Bring a New One a better one
It's no Mclaren F1. That would be a different story. 750 hp vs 1200 hp and the Lambo was just a cunt hair faster...
Yo mat I no hate but I think u when ed a bit before things hands when ed down
For less hp and a huge amount of downforce the f1 car was keeping up so well
I felt like the f1 car was holding back
you gotta have some drone shoot
7:35 it's pretty much a jet
F1 cars are the pinnacle of Motorsports with top of the line engineering. These cars are made with respect to a specific formula, just like a recipe to you fav dish. These cars are made for speed around corners and to dominate tracks, understand that the F1 would be laps ahead of this was on a track and not a drag race
9m in 8 min 😯😯
I love lamborghinis
Wait y f1 isn’t the best?
Can you do a Nissan GT-R, 370z and skyline R34
Would dare try a Supra
Everyone in the comments is a F1 fanboy.
Not put them on a f1 track
Lmaooo 7:13 thats just scary
Remember, the f1 car is for corners not top speed and it outdated looks like a 2013 f1 car the 2021 car would do way better
Isn't that an older model of F1?
Toyota supra say: GAHAHAH woman
OK
how about let's put them on the circuit track. bwahahhahaha
Useless comparison. Why do yall just do drag race? I wanna see a full circuit battle.
That lambo is actually insane, but damn the F1 is INCREDIBLE
He jumped out to early on the 2nd run.
Ssss
Yep.  When was the last time you randomly picked the car? Your ‘I don’t know’ comments are crap.
you need 1.200 HP to beat 750 HP not even one second
Why does the title say GT R NiSMO
Not sure about this video gtr launches to 60 at 2.5 seconds , lambo cannot do this
lamborghini trondol
This is horrific
Lmao you know David is from another era when he calls the GTR a Skyline
The feeling of beating both cars must of been epic but to be able to say u raced Coulthard and beat him is legendary....that's one to tell the grandkids. great vid 👍 u have another subscriber
That lambo’s back looks like bane from batman
F1 sounds silly😖
In reality the GTR probably could have beaten everything if it had the same amount of money spent on it as the Lamborghini.
I wonder why that F1 car sounds like an FE car, and why did they used white tires instead of red ones or c5
The last time i enjoyed myself watching cars was on Top Gear with Clarkson, Hammond and May, Matt you did that all by yourself wow im damn impressed 👏. Love this channel man. Jeez this lambo smashed the F1 car and then i watched the F1 car smashing the Chiron, i want this car 😢
that's no1300 hp gtr... quit playing
5:55
Legends say the f1 is still shifting up 4:47
The lambo smoked the gtr
I'd like to watch a modern F1 car vs those 2000hp+ UGR Lambos, GTR's and Calvo Vipers.
The R35 needs an exhaust then it sounds better
If I ever see a Lamborghini huracan or any lambo without a bumper, I will never race one   10 months ago
Love the sound of the F1. As a young man I got to see a F1 race. I was hooked. The speed, the corners the need to have your shit together just to live let alone win the race. Watching a bunch of left turns and a wreck now and then is boring.
Asli, gila sih Lambo-nya‼️
That lambo is not 1200hp lol
To turn it off, use the knob; you knob!
Jump start every time
win or lose. Italian made machines remain in my heart
So funny seeing how stupid the vast majority of the population is in YouTube comment sections.
No excuse to lose to a 4000 pound piece of crap. You ease the throttle a little bit-Formula 3 loser.
That lambo is mental. Never mess with a missing bumper lambo
lie
Lambargini
We want that Lambo against the Nevera.
Matt's the only guy that yells "Come on!" when he's far ahead and has no chance of losing.  Have you guys ever considered continuing to the half mile? Might as well do both if you have the space.
The F1 car doesnt go flat
It's so funny when Matt is scared in a car
Mat's lamborghini is going to win
LAMBO IS THE BEST
Waw lamborghini is the best
that lambo is insane
F1 just kept spinning.
That lambo crazy
You ok hun 🤣
F1 driver with more excuses than his loses.
I doubt that Lamborghini beats gtr
Fast lambo
why did david did not used DRS?
Added advantage pickup for Lamborghini is insanely awesome... otherwise on a pretty long stretch Lamborghini can't survive this race😅😅😅
Added advantage pickup for Lamborghini is insanely awesome... otherwise on a pretty long stretch Lamborghini can't survive this race😅😅😅
F1
The performante is naturally aspirated + if it was a twin turbo it would've been the fastest lambo
The GTR and the F1 are basically tied, you can see the GTR pulling at the end
The f1 driver was just stupid
Add ONE turn, and  watch the F1 car destroy that lime green turd.
Through a 10 mill Yamaha banshee in the race and everyone else is loosing
And this f1 car is restricted
I gutted plaid hit 8.9 1/4 and off the show room hits 9.2, sedan…these are super car and formula 1s, bring the plaid in this match up, same hp, except plaid weighs over 1000 lbs more, let’s mix it up! I’m a gas junky with fast cars but I drove the p100d a year ago then bought it, sold it after the plaid came out and waiting on my delivery, such a blast to drive. Love this channel!
I love the sounds of that F1 awesomes sounds
it’s weird that F1 didn’t win in everything because it’s so light
But lambo have best soung lambooo 😍😍🔥🔥🔥❤️
I watched nisan GTR  1600 hp on your Chanel how that can be stronger then lambo ????  But lambo is laboooo ❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
That F1 car sounds like mosquito bzzzzzz
Man you should have brought that gtr with 1600hp
this is why lambos are awesome, my dream car 😩
Thumbs up  bud
Asks David to rev up the F1.  David keeping the car at idle : Yeah I think this RPM has already done the trick
Perché non fate una gara in pista e vediamo chi vince
whos the carwow starter girl i like her fit.
F1 is for cornering car..
Wat a fake show!
the cheapest GT-R can keep up !!!! amazing
Where was the lambo tuned tho!  Which tuners????
That lambo is as fast as the rimac nevera
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Now I want to see that Lambo vs the Rimac Nevera.
Now try with a 2000 F1 car 8 )
gtr rolll
This was insane!! Check out some more F1 vs car videos here: https://www.youtube.com/c/PROJECTDRIVEN1?sub_confirmation=1
Huracan is crazy 🔥
Am I the only one stoked to see Matt racing with David freaking Coulthard! Great video, amazing race!
WTH 8.9 seconds???
with great power comes with great responsibility.
Aahhhh that Lambo is absolutely insane 😳🔥
Add a drone to film
now do corners
u should give yanni that Lamborghini .. so he smashes and enjoyes little hehe
Put the lambo round the corners let’s see what happens then
7:26 nice Also, you curse a lot
4:35 what a joke😂😂😂
3:59 what is this😏😏
3:08 😂😂😂
0:35 we care bro!!! But realtively light in a car innit
The monster car only one gtrŕ
An f1 car has 1100 bhp even the reunalt
That big bad ass lambo is brutal and incredibly fast!!😎😎😎😎🤣🤑🤑🤑🤑🐱
Pls test these three car down in Spa
Watching that Lambo, just kept thinking of J.Clarkson - “POWEEEEEEEER”
Raaaa why  the f1 car is on hards like hello? U lot coudlve put soft or ultrasoft and dosent even have drs like
Carwow pls upload 1200hp Lamborghini v Bugatti Chiron 🥺🥺
3:31 🙂👍🏻
Race with F1 Mercedes
F1 car seem not looking legit
circuit in MONACO, Montecarlo, F1  destroyed NISSAN , LAMBORGHINI.
The lambo is light weight so it is quicker than gtr
Lol anyone can identify that the Lambo is tuned  But no one can tell about GTR  That's why I like Japanese engineering
so you're telling me, that a lambo can be faster than a bugatti chiron if a lambo has a turbocharger? maybye? i dunno
4:26 bugatti in the background lol
very good video. the f1 tires are not soft (doesn't develop to their fullest potential), they don't have DRS and these V8s don't have a high top speed like the other F1 hybrids v6 and the V10.
That F1 sound <3
Bro these are 8 and 9 second cars, do you see how fast the world is going?!
An insane 100-200 kph on that Lambo, absolutely mad
çöp ef1
Tuned Lambo to F1 : " Eat my Dust "
Hey Matt I think you should race the Rimac Nevera vs that Lamborghini Huracan to see which one is fast
Always raining on this bloody country
That Lambo is sick af!!!
Not Fair with the tires
F1 car sounds like ive Got a bee stuck in my ear
Ladies and gentlemen, this is exactly why Lamborghinis don't have turbos.
Rimac vs F1?
The gtr was cheated imo.
Race starts at 3:30
You should have the rimac against the lambo
Las cosas como son Matt no sabe controlar mucho poder
It’s worth it to watch the drag race, I mean Matt’s reaction to lamborghini launch is priceless
I just want to see a video where he loses....😉
I think power to weight ratio is really the deciding factor in this.  Honestly,  I thought the gearing of the Formula car would give it an advantage... I guess  not.  LOL  And I wouldn't say you "destroyed"... but definitely the absolute winner.
It would help if you had the starter in front of everyone instead of on the bumper of the center car...
Matt please please 🙏🙏  drag the turned green Lamborghini and the mirac navera
That Lamborghini just launched him into light speed
ghaghah   english hujowy akcenrt
That Lambo is on another level of insane.
That Lambo is not a car, that’s insane
😂😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥👍🍷🍷
Get the 2022 F1 cars
DRS??
Did he just hit 220mph /354 kmh ?!?!
Even though that Lambo is turbocharged it still revs to over 8500 rpm. It's insane
I can't believe the lambo beat a F1 car. That's crazy.
Take one corner and the lambo gtr see the f1 peatiful red lights
Let's appreciate that if you say the Nissan licence plate it will be pronounced as fucker
The GTR guy did not launch properly in the first two races. And why should a competing racer be the one to call the shots?
Do 1/2 mile races 😁
Sheesh these TT lambos are dnagerous
Why don’t u race
The Lamborghini set off way before the starter had dropped her arms. The results are a joke.
F1 vehicle is not appropriate for drag racing. Let's race on the  track
https://youtu.be/tpua7OL-HIY
Drag race fans watch these videos and giggle. There's an obvious reason why you guys never compare an actual drag car like a funny car, but I wish you would anyway just for laughs.
F1 monster
Surprised non of the cars broke down
Your mercy is so expensive
2:43 3:32 3:46 3:57 4:48 5:02 5:14 5:42
That Lamborghini is probably working out in the metroflex gym. Yeahhhh budddyyyyy
I am done ☺️☺️☺️....
u can feel the power of that lambo in the rolling race when it just shoots off
You’ve got to be kidding me!!! Wow, the Lambo kicked ass!!!😱
So all these three cars will destroy the bugatti Chiron
F1 doesn't even get to reach its full downforce, at low speeds it's wheeles would slip
Anyone noticed Redbull was on the slowest compound tires and the road was damp? Sorry to say, but you guys on many occasions test cars under shitty conditions...
I want to see that lambo vs the rimac 😂
I would like to seeing MR . M Racing faster like rocket is perfectly and interesting nexts time and i hope you have funny with your race
@Carwow ... Can you make a drag racing video on a actual half a mile drag strip 👀
Race against a 2021 f1 car, then we'll see
Lots of fanboys here... lol. Add some braking zones and cornering, that's where the real cars and drivers shine! Very  cool vid, dig it!
David uncle can’t even win here 🤦🏻‍♂️
Try this with the 2020 Mercedes W11 1100 bhp with softs and DRS.....
Hi there this is Ms I am from south africa I was hoping that if you can sponsee a video with Lamborghini hurricane 2015 from underground racing with the green lambo red bull racing 2011
JUST REMEMBER F1 CARS ARE NOT MADE FOR DRAGS :) in a real track F1 car would dominate by 15 to 20 seconds in one hot lap.
JÖRGEN
Matt why you jumped the start twice 🤣
The lambo is a bit slow it goes 220km/h but I thought it went 350km/h......
How can a 250.000 lambo defeat a 14.000.000usd car
I need that lambo
I could see genuine fear in matt's face when he first launched the lambo
Compared to the Lambo & GTR's huge engine & gearbox setup against the F1's tiny one, It's really impressive how a 10-year-old machine can be still within 0.3 sec is friggin impressive. Would like to see these two cars go against the Mercedes W10/W11.
If you made a race in a circuit and you would have used a more modern f1 car with soft and Drs,  the f1 car would absolutely win with a huge gap, becose f1 cars are made to be fast around corner and use aereo dinamic to gain speed
Those tuned Huracans you see in alot of drag videos are beasts. Old days it was always only the skyline mostly but damn there is alot of huracans. Wonder why it is. Is it the engine that is perfect for turbos and what not?
Awesome race! A race between that lambo and a Rimac Nevera would be super cool!
Mat you need to do a drag race Rimac Nevera vs that Lambo
You need to do not rolling 1 mile w the F1 car not
Race on actual race track🙂 Silverstone isn't far from Birmingham
Can we just appreciate the GTR, I mean that car is heavier than all and it accelerate like a beast.
Your so close my F1 ❤️
Okay, now try lapping Silverstone with these cars then tell me who wins...
That GTR has better top speed than that Huracan
Take V10 F2004 or New V6 Hybrid with ERS/DRS and Bye Bye Lambo lol
f1 built for fast cornering
When GTR  race with F1 and LAMBO.. V6 vs V8 vs V10 incredible both of 3 cars very fast 🚀🚀👏🏽👏🏽
AHAHAHA THAT FACE WHEN MAT TOOK OFF IN LAMBO
Au should try Bugatii Chiron vs Nissan gtr
Surprised that there’s a production car that can so soundly beat the F1
Why F1 car dipnot open DRS
Not a Lambo fan at all but that’s was very impressive and it didn’t break. With the modifications I thought it would struggle and not be able to apply the power but wow..
the lambo is completely BONKERZ! 🥜
Bruhh that's illegal 😿😒 what's wrong with GT R guy😕
I need father like him 😔😂
You should have called verstappen to drive his redbull car
Lambo jump started every time.
Just imagine guys with 70k £ the lambo tuned and it’s look bad aswell N maybe the ingine will die soon and it’s faster the porche turbo s in just 1.1 second lol the turbo s is nuts
how about a five lap race with drivers to compliment the nismo and lambo take em all to the edge-or a gpz driver to get in the nismo lol :)
absolutely amazingly fast -super tuned and the lambo got 220 mph
I've watched Matt's GT-R drag race and the 1600hp GT-R did the quarter mile in 8.9 seconds, it was insane....I think it would have given the Lambo a run for it's money 🤔🤔🤔
Wow, by far the best sounding F1 engine… bring back the V8s
hoonicorn 1400hp car vs lamborgini 1200hp green color youtube hoonigan which car is faster
you know a car is fast when he's got fear in his eyes instead of joy
Demon LAMBO
the slowest car ran 9.3 in a quarter mile. just let that sink in for a sec.
F1 sounds 🔥
GTR fans punching the air 🤣
Love your chanel
scams scammers scam Lamborghini turning to drag car cheating cheat poop shit

Put your money in your mouth and I'm ready to race I bring my GT-R   I'm ready for the challenge of one million dollars 400 meters We have a racing circuit ready
That F1 slow.
LAMBORGHINI 🇮🇹🌟🏆🔥💪
Manuel king gtr
the gtr is literally trash
If Coulthard had DRS and the slipstream, he would have beaten the lambo.
The wordplay on that plate.  I dont care who wins the race, its all about the drag.
still a nismo fan, the horrified look in Matt's eyes says i should have kissed my wife goodbye in the morning hahahaha
still a nismo fan, the horrified look in Matt's eyes says i should have kissed my wife goodbye in the morning hahahaha
@carwow América Latina, tradice este xD
I wish I could buy the 1200hp Lamborghini
Everybody is good on the straights. Now race on the new Jeddah track and see how fucking trash the Nissan and Lamborghini.
In order to sell something, you have to promote it. But that’s a different story when it comes to numbers.
How was the Nissan so bad and the Lamborghini so much better
3:13 haha that sounds so ridiculous
The tuned things Look so bruh on the lambo xD
Jeez that Huracane just    Went ahead  Just took off
He made him sell the formula 1
Let’s go lambo
How about This lambo & the pulse Chiron 🌚
Mi piacerebbe vedere una Ferrari  modificata con turbo , contro GTR and Lamborghini ! ❤️
So If I want to impress my wife, I should get a Lamborghini. Let me save up some money for the rest of my life, and I'm halfway there.
Mad ting
You have been front 10 maters
While drag racing is fun... and had the results I expected... Try adding cornering on a race track and lets watch the F1 car repetitively lap both the Lambo and GTR! All modern race tracks are built deliberately to limit cars top end speed, adding bends/track wiggles are for safety! Commercial cars aren't light enough and don't have enough down force to handle bends at speed like an F1 :)
👓  👓  👓  👓 ⏳ SEEK YE the LORD while He may be found, call ye upon Him while He is near: [Isaiah 55:6 KJV] ⏳ 👓  👓  👓  👓
Around ten years ago a top F1 car could take off from a dead stop, exellerate to 140 miles per hour and then come to a complete stop in just 4 seconds..... according to the race commentator at the time.  I wonder how that car would stack up against these guys.
The decade old F1 car performed quite well.
Apples to oranges comparison as to the F1. Stupid.
I think everyone knew that lambo was gonna flog em in a drag 🤣
the current f1 cars do 0-200 in 3 seconds...they would smoke the lambo easy
But it's only a straight line. Would be interesting to see how each car does a qualifying lap on any Formula-1 circuit
Again beautiful cars and awesome video.👍👍👍🎉🍻
Heck yea, Fuckin' Lamborghini!
i think the GT-R SKYLINE CAN BEAT LAMBORGHINI, HEHE
Roses are red Violets are blue  Let the races begin @ 3:32
U can't have the fastest car do the countdown..
Nissan GT-R with a respectable showing and the only one that can get over speed humps and fit in a parking space 🤣 King of the daily drivers!
Me clicks the Video:hmm  Me After the Video: Does anyone have 200000 pounds for me
Did the F1 car have an F1 driver in it? How does an F1 car lose this
I'd prefer if my child stepped down the road before an F1 car
F1 sounds like a weed trimmer....
if f1 car used drs and Ers and f1 car was on maximum speed setup f1 would destroy the Lambo and Gtr
A 2021 F1 car would destroy both !!!
Can poeple stop complaining about how the f1 car wasn't designed to drag race? If you don't like the idea, THEN WHY WATCH THE VIDEO IN THE FIRST PLACE
F1 fans are seething about  the F1 not winning the drag race... Everyone knows that on track the F1 would win, you ca stfu about it...
So it takes well over 1000hp and AWD to beat an F1?
power to weight math checks out
Crazy numbers :  Your inside a Formula one car, running at 200 km/h, you release the throttle. No brake. During the firsts seconds you will feel a 1g deceleration just because of the drag of all the wing. 1g is more or less the maximum braking power of a car (not a sport car).   But let's try with the current > 1000 Hp F1 instead of the anemic V8 2'4L naturaly aspirated...
That lambo already lost its back bumper before the race start
The f1 is not suited for a drag race put it on a circuit and it will beat the s... out of that lambo but nice car
Showing us scenarios we can only dream of!  Great content!
Everyone's going wild about an F1 car getting beaten in short, straight line race. Put in three or four curves and see who wins then 🙂 Either that or put a methanol- filled-dragster in the race - it would be over the line before they'd reached the half way point.
Lol. That Lambo is crazy. Funny how it was waaay closer the third time tho, which was the only time he didn’t jump the start. 😂
you talk too much Just Say'in.
F1 still sounds so sick🔥🔥🔥🔥
Thats funny that the F1 car said he'd catch you guys on the top end cuz too much wheelspin YA OK BUD
He hella redlit on the first 2 races in the Lambo
What about that new corvette
Lambo definitely jump the 2nd time.
Knew the lambo was gonna gap both of the cars
My bicycle has 1/4 hp
Awesome to see a street legal car with just bolt on's beat an F1.  The built 1500-2500Hp Huracan's would seriously teach F1's a lesson on the 1/4 mile.
Bullshit that car has almost twice the power
I'm only here to read inane comments from the crying F1 fanboys.
do a lap at Nurbergring and see which one wins
its cool to see the huracan and gtr on carwow cause i literally live about 5 mins away from where they were built/modified in jm imports I see and hear sick cars coming in and out from there all the time
Literally the same race all 3 times. Look at the finish each time. It’s the same. They just replayed the video. Pfffftttt  It’s a set up with different drivers driving the cars and then looped.   Not impressed
Do long race on F1  Lambo will smashed 😧 Isn't that ?
God all these cars are so cool
Guys, you must to have a look into Anderson Dick YouTube channel. What he’s doing with a corvette is completely insane. He turned up already 8.9s in a 1/4 mile, now is aiming 7s.
WTF??? I was 100% certain that the F1 car would win this. It has 30% less power than Lambo but it's 50% lighter.. What a dissapointment..
He was anticipating the starts; took off before the starter's hands were fully down by her sides.
Staged beyond doubt, do the power to weight sums
Looks like f1 will be using Lamborghinis now lol I don’t think so
Finally, a fair start
And could you stop jumping the start ffs
Don't know why you price the f1 car so badly. The cost for season is that just for the cars or to run the whole team?
i wanna see that race also with lewis hamilton's 2021 brazil gp car (with soft tyres)
Perfect tuned...
F1 car beats all, always will. Lambo is fast... On a straight which is never the case, untill there's a corner 🤣
These should always have a 150hp Civic next to them.
that aint the best f1 has to offer.
Loved the drag race and that TT lambo was crazy and the gtr but that F1 car is 8 years old and i was looking forward to you going against a 2020 or 2021 Mercedes F1 car that can go 0-60 in 1.5 sec and reach 200 mph in 11 seconds
Tske it round a proper circuit ya nunce
You have to count that the F1 has an enormous amount of downforce, which the lambo and the gt-r doesn't have, so in high speeds, since 150-200km/h it's really noticeable. Also I think the configuration fo the car wasn't for top speed, they cna run to +360kph and hard tyres. The lambo is really impressive tho, and has a really good LC
F1 car 2.4L mini V8 (Naturally Aspirated) 750- 800hp blows my mine. What a machine 👊🏼
Am I the only one seeing olx ads in this video
Why haven’t I seen yianni in a long time
Eu sou do Brasil
The F1 car would eat the both the others as an entree on a closed track - it wouldn’t be even be close to being close...
The F1 sounded like someone passed a lightning bolt through an electric blender.
David Coultard is slow even on a straight line
For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment; (2peter2:4) - Because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead. (Acts17:31) For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. (John 3:16-17) Jesus loves you, he's waiting for you to repent and put your faith and trust in Him :) https://youtu.be/uZdv-TtiMkg:)
If the F1 car was geared for drag race it would have won!
FORMULA 1 ENGINE...UNDER 2 LITERS! NUFF SAID!
i knew the TT Lambo was gonna win because how much HP it has a TQ and its very light for a TT V10 Lambo
nice but try it with LMP1 car :)
Scalpel vs butcher knife and butcher knife wins in meat cutting contest. Butcher knife is declared sharpest.
Much closer when he didn't jump the start.
No way
El coche de Checo Perez que bonito
The F1 car has so much aero that produces so much downforce it just creates a ton of drag...
I feel like f1 has a lot of restrictions to technology without that I think they could win
4:06 bro that’s funny as hell I modified mine in Forza horizon 5 with stock lambo huracan engine and it legit accelerates as fast as that does
he had a whole ass cargasm lmao
Should have raced the 919 Evo in this
with all due respect to Lamborghini, that F1 isnt tuned, tired, aeroed, or current.   also, nothing beats the sound of a F1 car. Having been to Montreal a few times, the early 2000's F1 cars felt like they were breaking your ribs with sound as they passed.
Those 2 tuned sports cars put a lot of power on straight line but the F1 car will certainly destroy both in a circuit lap time for sure. F1 cars are built for fast cornering speed, not straight line speed : )
IIRC up passed 900 hp you'd blow the standard GTR block.
Setelah melihat video ini saya semakin ingin membeli lamborghini 😁
Gtr losing in acceleration huh
lol this dude can not wait for the light if his life depended on it.
Not a chance in the world that car costs 60 million to make thats like apple selling a iphone for 800 bucks and it only costs 80 bucks to make. That cost has to be crew costs, fuel, and transportation for the year.
How is an F1 car slower than a lamborghini
Of course the GTR wouldn’t win in a drag race, but if you added some curves or raced on a road (the kind that most people drive on), the other two wouldn’t stand a chance against Godzilla.
Please carwow measure the speed at the finish line.... 1/4 1/2 and 1 mile....
First two times he jumped start
#Stopolxautos
He definitely jumped the start TWICE 😂. Lambo was still crazy though.
why isint the f1 car using drs?
I am just curious on why the RB7 has the "HONDA" logo. If I remember it correctly, the power unit for the 2011 RBR RB7 was from Renault.
All F1 fans clicking the video expecting it to be an easy win.  **F1 car loses**  Let the explanation games begin...
now race a 1980's turbo f1 and see what happens
3:30
i love GTR
didn't he jump start both races?
The F1 car does not cost 62 million. They cost around 8-9 million.
this is like watching   McGregor  fighting      Mayweather  In boxing.... now I want to see Mayweather fight  McGregor  in his playground
that's an old f1 car doesn't uses ERS or DRS just saying
its getting boing pretty quickly to just stupidly accerlerating on a straight line with different cars. after 3 f1 cars i lost the interest, maybe due to lack of knowledge i can gain from your videos
wtf kind of fruity f1 car is this?!  give me a break.  this is the f1 car they have at disney world for the kids to drive
if you have to remove entire panels from a car to fit the turbos on, then its probably pretty fast
Awesome comparison. Cheers!
just do a lap on a track ,and you'll see who's the boss
4:47 fail start green out ;)
I want to see the Lambo go through corners like an F1 and keep a decent speed and stay on track. :)
How can buggati veron lose to F1 but Lambo wins 🥲
Crazy Lambo..wow..
Nothing can match a ferrari 458
He definitely jumped the start on the second race though. Watching in 0.25x speed makes it very clear.
This can't make the tyre of F1 into its working temperature.
I would have expected F1 to be a bit quicker
F1 goes through a bend at that speed.
Absolut lambo 🤷🏻‍♂️
Crazy thing on the f1 Cars are they can drive turns at 200kmh or even more
3:27 for the race
That lambo is insane! 220Mph thats so fast
That Bull runs like the wind! Jesus H!
The TPMS light on the Lambo is on ? 😁 2:43
Gtr danbiys mad they lost so horribly hard lmaooooo
I want to see that 5.2L V10 Lambo VS Boba Motoring’s Golf MK2 that did the 1/4 in 8.2s with a 2.0L inline 4
tiraram toda potência dessa F1 ta louco :(
Imagine that g-force
I can't ever get into the drag race culture. the tt lambo was nuts - but still can't get me into it. Pretty sweet tho.
F1 technology truly is out of this world... 750hp out of a 2.4L naturally aspirated V8 is a beyond godlike engineering achievement.
Why did you use hard tyres in F1 in wet weather?
Thats a Fake. F1 Car is in 2,5 sec 0-100
Race starts at 3:28
That Huracan is WILD.
If the F1 car had Drs and Ers they would get smoked but still that Lambo was a rocket
Lambo king of the street.
lol they took a old f1
Bad tires and f1 cars aren’t made for drag races because they make a lot of downforce to turn in sharp corners fast. If you set that f1 car with less downforce on the front and rear it would’ve won. Also if you made a turning race the other cars would’ve got destroyed.
3 races...3 wins...2 false starts but definitely Lambo is a beast
O F1 claramente deixou ganhar !
That gtr isn't mod correctly, a gtr with that much hp should have destroyed anything, u should try rd engineering gtrs, no contest! My gtr 900hp is as fast as this gtr, with that being said lambo amazing launch big ups to the peeps that mod the car
I saw a nissan gtr and a Lamborghini hurcan and a bugatti divo I think and many more cars
Wow
an F1 is not a dragster
How much money F1 How much money Lambo  How much money GTR .  I love GTR ❤️
the formula 1 car may have activated KERS and DRS
F1 car would smash with ers and drs and it not being 10yrs pld
Suiper chingon , senti ese pinche poder neta , excelentisimo video
Personally I would have liked a little more focus on the Nissan - I know it was slowest in this test but its still a stunning car. But great video.
Cheater , you just cant  wait for the 1 before you go, well u managed 1 out of 3 anyway
I,d like to see some electric supercars go up against an F1 car . That would make a good video as we know how rapid off the line electric motors are
Sure a lot of people here acting like drag racing isn't a part of what a F1 car does. The entire track isn't one big corner, there are straightaways, you know? And that means that at least some of what an F1 car must do is accelerate in a straight line. And it is possible for something to do it faster than a F1 car, especially one from a decade ago, with enough horsepower. Just because it's F1 doesn't mean it's the best at everything, forever.
Hopefully the next gen gtr they give some serious weight reduction lol, but yall can definitely see who got the best power to weight ratio
Somehow Mat manages to drive the winning car all the time🙄
In straight line is Lambo faster, but test it on track, no chance against F1 I think ...
.
Damn maybe I’ll change my mind Bout not liking lambos 😮
That Huracan vs Rimac Nevera drag race plz Matt 🥺
Those both cars are electric in front of that F1 sound 😘
F1 has reach limit on top XD
F1 cars have never been about drag races - they deliberately slow the cars down off the line and ban launch control etc to make it all about the driver... so these comparisons seem a bit silly. No launch control, no clever electronics, not even an automated clutch, no 4 wheel drive etc... do a race where you have to get round a corner first, and the F1 car will fuck off into the distance
Do an f1 car from 2004 or even now then see what happens
Why not using F1 hybrid?
The f1 car need just 1 turn to win any race
it just an old F1 car... imagine 2021 F1 drag race against both of them.. :D they will lose.  but i think both of that monster still cannot beat MERCEDES BENZ AMG ONE that will Launch next year with 1000HP ( F1 engineering ) 1,6L twin turbo hybrid, and mass araound 1000kg too.. the power to weight ratio 1:1.
Nice drag racing...  I had my $$$ on the F1... And I think that putting [aftermarket] TWO TWIN TURBOS Coupled w/a high performance, production (V8?); against two different (V8s?)...?! I think that was just bit like having an F15 Jet against a Learjet...  And the 'Rollig-race'... I don't knw WHAT HAPPENED THERE?!? Its like thre was [another malfunction]...? IN A FREAKIN: $40,000,017. 60 HA Ha ha ha! Formula 1 CAR?!?  Oh well... It was all in good fun... Although, the F1 champion driver responded in: ...crickets...
THIS LAMBO VS THE FUCKING 911 TURBO S!!! PLEASEEEE
Next time use stock Lambo instead of tuned Lambo wtf its just not fair play, so dont be happy when you won the drag. Also let me see how good you can handle the curves against the F1 ?!?!
lambo queimou largada 2x pô
Lamboooo!!!
why wont they do a rematch drag race cause gtr and twin turbo lambo horsepower are way past the f1 so why dont they race but f1 use DRS
Hellow!! You should try the Greek car  Chaos..
GTR พ่อทุกสถาบัน
Do a tuatura vs f1 car
Italians Do It Better 🤟
I thought an F1 car had a little more than 1000 hp?
Ahh,that lambo is just  nuts🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
The gtr35 is dead💀
Try with the 2021 F1 cars. They are at 1000+ HP now.
Faux départ de la lambo
What if  PORSHE 919 HYBRID EVO  VS  F1
You jumped to the fourh gear directly🤣🤣
One of the greatest VIDEOS EVER WATCHED IN THIS DAMN CHANNEL! A M A Z I N G ! ! ! ! ! ! !
I guess F1 car is Fuel saving mode...not in quali mode..
But let's be honest, it's got no chance again my Mark V Golf GT TDI 2litre modified to 250ish, 0-60 in 2.4 and my top speed is way off the speedometer 🤣 could prob beat these three with a blindfold on. easy 👍
its not really fair cuz the f1 car is on hord tyres and the trak is wet so you shouldve put the f1 car an intermediat or wet tyres
Jamie would you love another go," YEAH,if the team are,am happy"
WOW CaR YeeetT yes MEEE ,
I like this guy he’s funny
3:25 it save your time
The lambo is quick but costs at least 5 x the price of the GTR
No 1 Lambo and the rest
Watching that Huracan win makes me proud of my Huracan
There are so many engineering and scientifically mode are there in f1 car so its not easy to takeoff like 200mph like lambo.lambo is autosport
F1 is older than that 2 cars he is 2012 driver and his car  f1 is 2009
its not faire ! cc
I’ve driven a Lamborghini and it was brutal on the body so I can’t imagine this version
Dang that's fast!! Let's go Brandon!  https://youtu.be/2LcqZPv5pXY
I need to  see the same video with a 2020 F1 car with C5 (hypersoft) tyres & open DRS.
Now put the GTR and the lambo head to head stock
Oh Mat, you're not a Brummy, you're a Yam Yam.
Do the  r25 renault f1 car
F1 is absolutely pinnacle of motorsports.
lambo started faster.on a track f1 says: tchau
I’ll always be a GTR fan girl, but that lambo was insane.
This is a unfair test you cant get that f1 car to hook in the rain
This f1 car is so sad at the first try
f1 Car is 1000 hp
The best...10 !!!
rules killed f1
Who agrees with me he looks exactly like newzealand cricketer Trent Boult 😂😂
That GTR have 200 hp 😂😂😂
gtr not 1300 hp
Sheeeesssh
That's a good set for Dragtimes channel =)
wait what? I think F1 can defeat all cars, Formula 1 broo🤔, it cost can be 70 Million pounds for 1 car
I dont know but... Something on that F1 is missing. For me it seems like that F1 is lack accelerarion, i hear like it missing revolutions, i feel that top scream is missing
6:02 chipmuncks !
The rb could be alot faster with ss tires
Wow
is that a bugatti at the back at 4:27 ?
Race it with the hoonicorn🙏
This race is amazing! Maybe you can do a mile drag race to stretch how the F1 would fare with longer roads for momentum
lamborghini has perfect start if f1 has perfect start too i think f1 can beat lamborghini
Finally a car youtuber who knows the metric system
Who would  spend 70k  to completely ruin the look of that lambo?Well done Singh.......would of looked better if he just reversed it into a wall.
F1 Brabham BT55  is better than RedBull   750 paltry horsepower
Mano a lambo é marcha em cima de marcha parece de moto de corrida, as marchas dela são muito curtas
si ma la f1 non è quella del 2021 anche perchè adesso hanno un V6 da 1.4 litri se non sbaglio
gtr 1400whp big turbo
That f1 driver isint real good at shifting
The GTR was long known as a tuning powerhouse, but seeing an F1 beat a 1300hp a R35 GTR was well, can't really say embarassing for Nissan or cool for F1 but that shocked me, considering F1's are made for race tracks.
Just the sound of the F1 car wins the day
That F1 Sound reminds me of one of my childhood petrol RC cars
Super Video. Die ständigen Kamerapositionswechsel nerven mich aber.
Ahahahahaha F1 behind lambo???? Fake video. Probably David shift gears under 5000 rpm. Ahahahah really hilarious
So much stupid excuses and ppl who don't know shit in the comments you assume that GTR is the best of the best it's actually not 9.3 is on the slow side of fast GTR's  you slobs in the comments just literally talk too much and know little of automotive science when it comes down to it. ''F1 car design for this '' well it can drive straight.  TT lambo's ''king'' funny because a GTR holds the fastest title for that.  Chill out children .
شيلبي تقفل ملفهم 💀 .
If the F1 car had ers and drs, which allows it to have better straight line speed, it would've destroyed other cars. And the fact that 8 years old car with 750hp can compete with 1200, 1300hp newer cars, just shows how crazy F1 engineering is. That RB would kill those two cars on track btw.
all the money in this video and they couldn't have one guy on a walkie talking to all three of them to say go?
You know a fully upgrade hectic wrx customised by a lebo smoke them
number one lamborghini
Don't forget 11 years old f1
If any car managed to beat F1 car in initials, that car is the king of streets.
Never mess with: A civic with a laptop Gtr with drag wheels Supra with loads of gauges
There ain't much that can throttle a Formula 1 car in a straight line but damn, that Lamborghini is really something else.
The launch of this lambo is crazy🤯🤯
Porsche 9RR 911 GT siker
😂
Jesus 62 million for the f1 car??
No way in hell that F1 car loses. I see it's on hard tyres and most likely it's not on full power mode. These card go from 0 to 200 in between 4 and 5 seconds.
U ve chosen the wrong type of formula car for this, grab an indycar from the late 00s, those things did over 230mph in corners at oval tracks over 240 on straight
Please give it a thumbs up who wants to see matt racing this insane lambo against the astonishing of rimac nevera !!
2023 I promise you self, I will get a Lamborghini
U was a little scared! 8D
Perfect
Lambo destroys f1 lmfao
Pause @ 8:39 look at matts face 🤣🤣🤣
Best of all
Try to Circuit Race Lambo vs F1
why is it callled drag race when you cant drag the race with your hands
Is that a legit F1??
Pagani show drag race to
Ridicule
maybe the redbull needs some soft tyres lol
Imagine a 2020 F1 car with softs and the DRS….
Next race vs RedBull 2021 car. 😁
Bullshit video non car can beat f1 car, this guy just would love to be winner at any car he drives no matter if he insults ppl intelligence
Why alwaya Rb7 not Any F1 car the fastest another i think will bit lambo
Race again a supra
I think you should try the 1600hp gtr vs the huracan in this video id say itd be closer
There’s a folklore, “you just dont fuck w/ lambos without bumpers mate”
That was fantastic 750 hp  vs  1200 hp  vs  1300  hp .
Gtr is real beast💪💪💪💪💪
So many excuses for the F1 car in these comments lmao. The cope is off the charts.
This Lamburghini Huracan vs Nevera Rimac 😍😍!
Matt was ghosted just as he took off!
1200hp Lamborghini vs 1600hp Nissan GTR, the drag race time used almost the same. Give a like if you want to watch this.
The track doesn’t suit the F1 car. It’s really bumpy, it won’t give you a full performance under this condition.
He just break the speedomeeter
Realtalk the powerful is gtr
i use YouTube premium but dont working   :-(
Show the top speet
that is awesome but, why don´t you put that lambo against the plaid or nevera this could be quite interesting
I can hear the cry scream of jdm fans
Mustahil F1 kalah
You should try the Lambo against the Hoonicorn of Ken Block.
Wow that Lamborghini is insane.  Let's race it against the Agera.
Wow that Lamborghini is insane.  Let's race it against a Bugatti, your choice.
Are you crazy you have a F1 or rent it
F1 never heat the tires
Now gsr civic
The F1 car will blow you up on smooth asphalt or special track
I'd certainly be nervous driving that Lambo at those speeds with the tyre pressure warning light on!
If they where stock tho
I sub
Matt very happy beating a 2011 f1 car lol the f1 car is not designed for straight line race it is designed for cornering speed that is why they have a big wings and that's creates big downforce while also creating a Lot of drag
Now go around corners
I think it’s awesome how each driver seam to get more familiar with their cars and got faster and fast.
Those freaking Lamborghinis are no joke. How the heck it beat a FORMULA ONE!?
No way that f1 costs $61 million
На Ниссан прокладку между рулём и сиденьем поменять
Lamborghini doesn't have much in special, bring in the Supra and we'll see who's the king
That lambo is no fing joke! There's no way it only has 1200hp, he's running 8's on street tires on a non prepped surface. 😲😲😲😲😲😲
I need to learn about engines man. How does a 2.4L engine become a V8???? And how is a 5.2L engine a V10!???? I am so sorry for my stupid question but I must be educated!!
10/10 ;)
NBA/LUKE ZEBARI
Why does it say Honda, the RB7 had a Renault engine 🤔 just like the other RBs Vettel drove and won the 4 wc
How many gears does that F1 car have?
🤙🔥
Modern day F1 cars run turbo V6's and make over 1000HP with their electric engine assisted power units.  Pretty sure the outcome would be different. F1 cars have enough down force at speed to drive upside down and still stick to the road.  Doubtful the Lambo has that level of down force.
Lamborghini amazing fast
pleaaaaaaaaaasssssse make drag race between this lambo and rimac🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🥰🥰🥰
Taking f1 in for drag race is an insult of same.
Pulled off Way before the rest cheated
@carwow nice fake video, we know from many videos that it is faster than gtr lamborghini and many cars, only the cars you drive don't drive as fast as you do nice fake video
1200 hp lambo vs rimac navera
1600 hp gtr was required for this race
Uff😍😍
Matt, if you’re reading this. Can you next time test the practicality of the f1 car?
Lamborghini without rear bumper really is scary.
How about racing a course instead, I know which car I put my money on ..........
That Lamborghini ROLLS!!
LOOK AT THAT NISSAN! The rear end sinks right down on that drag race!
The F1 car didnt win😭😭... My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
Good. Now bring out the H2R
matt : COME ON!!! david :..................................
For the first time ever someone made me think that maybe the price of a lambo is a good choice over the power and fun it could deliver !!!
What a tree with the Lambo. That was a .003 reaction probably.
Nice race sir i like it...... I'm so happy to this video.... Nice nice.. Hehehheh ayos
Hard⚪ tyres on f1 car Need softs🔴
F1 one used to stand for number 1 on any land vehicle and nobody even dare to race those open wheels, but now, it should be called FOo1 for all the idiotic regulation;  cheers FIA
Need a 3,000hp viper now.
Tbh this shows how good f1 cars are. They are just rocketships.
Cara essa lamborguine e foda
I didn't know bionic was a fan bruh
Hi... Y is this F1 price are 62 million dollars because F1 price is not more than 20 million dollars... Any prof of this F1 price...
A drag race means nothing for a car that has rules for his category and made for a race on a track
GTR is still more special to me
JDM gang are crying (me too)
F1 650 cv?
🤔
Wow
WOW. I just cancelled my F1 order. You guys saved me a TON!
Lamborghinis are beautiful
Lamborgini  join the F1 race
Can you do a race with a ford GT?
The F1 has a teeny little engine compared to the others.
Dude this video was so awesome a freaking Minecraft youtuber commented on it lol
Nissan is the last because it is not aerodynamic and f1 with only 750hp but it is very light
PLEASE THIS LAMBORGHINI VS BUGATTI
Man a tuned r34>>>>>r35
Lambo is insane 👍
in second race gtr was farbehin
the lamborghini is 1st twin turbo and tune
Helooo kawasaki h2r where
And you can’t prove me wrong
The gtr would actually win cause it has the most hp and a 1000hp gtr could even possibly win but the did not tune the gtr
You shifted twice in the first Rolling race
was kinda hoping f1 would smash em
Matt do the Huracan vs Chiron
GTR socks lol
งง ภาพตัดต่อแย่มาก
Humilhou o F1...
I wonder where the 11 yr olds are now lol
Yo need to race that Lambo with the 1,600hp GT-R
F1 cars 🏎 aren't ment to launch of the start
Try 1/2 mile.
it was wet basically...
Something wrong with that gtr
Bring in the hybrid w12 from merc and see something scary
That is one quick lambo to be fair, but the F1 car wasn’t built for top speed to run quarter miles, it was built so it can pretty much hold its top speed going through corners🤘🏼 Do the same race but on a race circuit and watch the f1 car run laps around both while having a cuppa tea😂
He should race that lambo against the Rimac
Formula slow horizon boy its nuts
Id love to see next time alpha omega gtr
that'sold F1
Nonsens.. stupid test. No body can fight with f1 cars.
All cap
Mat just scared by a Lamborghini 220 mph N/A from going to fast
Every F1 car goes 0 to 60 MPH in just 1.6 seconds.the rest you know
A modern F1 car with DRS enabled (less rear wing drag) on lowest downforce setup with actual racing softs would be atleast 1 second up on these times, and closer to 2 seconds over the full mile from having a better start on fresh tires!  Put some real race drivers in these cars and do a lap of Silverstone and you would see the F1 car ahead by 15-20 seconds haha
we need the 1600 gtr vs the lambo
Great race🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
How about challenge dragster😏
Lambageeene
Rodrigo uuh
The new F1 car champion Maclern
Can we get a Mclaren F1?
😳I meeeean that GTR it's complete garbage 🗑  how dare that thing only does  the 1/4 in 9.3 🤢          (Sarcasm)
I thought that F1 was actually an A1 race car. But that lambo launced like a demond. All3 3 cars will win within their division of racing.  Credit due to all 3.
That...gtr....are slow?
BigboyNissan is try winner.  Bicouse hi hawe 300 kg lither.. goodbay Lambo
you know its fast when mat doesn't even realise he's going 220
Wow
DRS not on, that’s why.
GTR needs a driver.
Now do a stripped down plaid!
remove the Wing and spoiler of F1 then see what happen..
that twin turbo lambo almost got beaten by an NA F1🤦
The F1 loses due to the amount of downforce of the wing it reduces too much too speed..
But still Electric is love
Whichever car you ride, that one wins. wtf🤔
i wanna see a video of the best supercars vs an f1 but on a circut, and the other cars get a head start
This lambo vs the 1600 hp GTR PLS 🔥
The way that Lambo moved off the line was almost comical. There just needed to be a Huracan shaped cloud left behind it. 💨
ไม่อยากเชื่อว่าF1.จะสู้ไม่ใด้
How much was the gtr
the gtr not a 1300hp it just only 480hp is a slow speed sport car in the world and this is Lamborghini huracan it just 700hp not a 1200 hp please check it properly before you write a title
Wow
https://youtu.be/iSvtN5it5Ro 🤔
220 mph whattttttt
The philosophy of the rich and the poor is this "the rich invest their money and spend what is left.The poor spend their money and invest what is left...
Matt jumped the start
Lamborghini showed us that it is the best car in the world, and it is king of races
Lamborghini is forever
That lambo is something else
tesla will smoke this 3
Just gonna take some time to admire that welding at 0:49 ...... Wild
It's fake it's GTR company's Monopoly because GTR can't Winn against F1 any drug race ....
Yea put Max in the Rbr and takr a newer Gen and the lambo would get smashed because the lambo need als these mods to beat a F1 car
👍👍 subscribe
Soft lastik ve drs olsa alır .d
Yeah but try a 90 degree turn at 100m/h... Bet the F1 wins that.
I love to have the lambo for my 18 years old
The F1 sounded like an gas powered rc car
Lambo had a headstart for the first 2 races
Dont get too happy Matt Watson. MULTI 21
So lamborghini won?🤔🤔
Izusu 4jj   1/4  in 7.2 sec. Thailand
Can we get a laferrari in a drag race again
Damn it!!! That was the best race yet. That got my adrenaline pumping.
Lamborghini huracan is the best car
Lamborghini iiiiihhuuuuu
Đây là chiếc xe f1 cũ kỹ đời 2011 lúc đó có 750 hp -800 hp , bây giờ 2021 mạnh hơn nhiều 900-1000 hp và công nghệ tối tân hơn . Mấy chiếc xe độ gtr và huracan chỉ là trò trẻ con so với f1 ❤ . Carrow hay so sánh không khách quan và luôn quảng cáo cho xe của mình
That huracan may have to do a drag race against the rimac nevera
They guy in the gtr isn’t putting all the power down all the way like mat would have
f1
rip GTR rip Coulthard
That Lambo is ridiculously fast😍😍😍
Ini TDK betull
Yes Lambo with the turbosss
I want to see a Bugatti Chiron Longtail on this dragstrip.
Let HAMILTON OR VERSTAPPEN  drive the F1 car to make things even.LOL🤣🤣No disrespect to DC he's one of the best.
He's got the skin of a  KFC chicken, and that chin was messing with aerodynamics, get some normals in there please.....:)
Absolutely  shiit video !!!
F1 is 60 million dollar car bruh .
It amazes me that the Lamborghini driver is without a helmet and looking casually here and there during a drag race against a Formula 1. An overlook from the channel or a fake video?
Haha neither of them cars would be no where near beating an f1 car
nissan gtr is overrated af!
GTR🔥
That gtr did really well
Gtr needs driver mod
this not true speed of F1 LOL no one supercar defeated F1 Hahaga bias ahaha
at the end of the day, around 300kg makes a big difference between gtr and lambo.
100 million dollar car dam
Wheres the f1's halo😂
Both cars with uk plates are illegal for the road with those noise levels. We'll lose our rights to modify our cars if people take the p*ss.
Lambo was always ahead in a cheat start. Definitely fast, not sure if it is faster than others...
Turn at all, and the f1 would disappear.
Lamborghini 1200hp vs bugatti
no drs no ers
Looks like an old airfield and the surface was a big draw back for the f1 car as David said getting any grip was hard
7:38 Damn that GTR is awesome bro
Jumped the start again
f1 is faster
No fair Lambo engine is modification
Tidak adil, F1 tidak dapet Traksi yang sangat Bagus, karena itu Bukan Aspal
No DRS?
Good vidios...from..Bali Indonesia.
Who wins? The lambo or  Ken blocks hoonicorn. This vs that
Dang Man That Lambo Is Insane
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLnDbH_auIk&t=169s
Now take a 2020 f1 car with the monza aero setup. Yes, it's like 100kg heavier than the 2011 but it does produce 1050hp compared to the 750hp. 1050hp with monza wings (almost flat af) is probably gonna smash that lambo but I mean.. There's a reason those cars cost from 75 up to 500 million dollars 🤷🏼‍♂️
Straight speed...too easy.    Add curves.    Then you'll see where the F1 shines. 😄
7:37 that just looks like the fastest flyby ever
MotoGP Bike vs F1 Car vs Another Car🔥
The F1 is only 2.4 engine  with 750hp this is insane
I like Lamborghini because the speed and I like Nissan Gtr because it's heavy and easy to drift
Race them on an actual circuit however and the F1 car would win easily.
the f1 car still got the best sound when it drives by :D
When will gtr fanboys understand that the car isn't as great as they thought?
No wonder the F1 car lost, it was driven by Coulthard.
this lambo vs nevera,i wanna see that
F1 cars are built for cornering speed, if they ran this in circuits F1 cars are quicker. But that Lambo is so fast in this drag race though
And that is why they call a TT hurican the king of the street.
Ha ha ha .... 😂 🤣 😆  not possible F1 to be so slow  haha 😆 😅 🤣 😂
Legends says that lambo is still accelerating🤯
They should change setup of the rb7  im sure it was at monaco setup
That v8 f1 can keep up with those boosted monsters despite half the power and 10x downforce. this is insane!
many times bro. .i I watched this post. .but still like not believing! ?? whatever it is is a victory for lambo..
It's a shame Bugatti Chiron cost 10 times more than Lamborghini ,has 300 more horsepower and it lost to 1200 horsepower Lamborghini. I guess for less money you can buy a car which is much faster and has better handling. Bravo Lamborghini.👍
well the m5 beat the porshe and the tune lamborgini hurucan beat the m5
All I have to say is gtr omega.
F1 car 👍👍👍👍👍👍
yup put it on a race track and your lambo will be rendered puny by the f1 car where its build for.....but hey we all know this, i even think you even lose  against worst f1 team car
did he said 62 mil pound?.....  per F1car?
A ten year old F1 car vs two highly tuned modern cars. I bet the F1 still smokes them. Maybe not Turbos change the game a lot. It would be interesting to see these cars against one of the turbo era F1s. I guess the jeopardy would be much reduced. Luv and Peace.
Everybody gangster until F1 meets corner
bring back turbo to f1
The GTR only 4.1L not fair
Use the current gen F1 V6 hybrid
fake
Awesome man, lots of love from Pakistan 💓
v10 twin turbo come on!. . .
That f1 did really good for it standard's but is no one gonna talk about how they have legit fricked the lambos engine so hard it's a legit jet plane unable to take off
Fake
Marketing bisnes......😂😂😂😂😂
Keren
The Lamborghini vs Rimac Nevera!
take those things around twisties and that lambo is toast.
he's like a lil girl.
F1 probably has bad gear ratio for drag racing.
Bring aka_boode Aventador
Di##
Race with yanni sitting in the porshe 911 turbo and mat on the upgraded lamborgini heracon
The lamborgini's back is looking ridiculous like a crashed lamborgini it's back cover is gone only has lights at the top!!!
The most amazing thing about that Lamborghini is the fact that It can go over 200 mph safely with any idiot driver , that’s how good the car is
Lamboghini promotion
дниссан как обычно поc@cocaлити
try it on track, you'll be surprise. F1 built on track not drag
And Tesla with minor mod, will killed every cars on the road.  Even stock slayed high end American Muscle  Piston my arse
Now put them all on the track, at abu
And then they turn……
Hey Matt Try your best to make a race between these 3 monsters  1600 hp porsche: https://youtu.be/RSlWNV774DQ 1600 hp nissan gtr: https://youtu.be/wekl2gAvkrU 1200 hp huracan: https://youtu.be/tbm-izZisbw  These car finished the Q/M in similar time  Sure if you could arrange a race between them, it's gonna be EPIC 😍
So that's what Alex choi feels like everyday huh?
04:46 Lambo clearly cheated.
that surprised me!!
Theres so many F1 experts and Legends down the comments
F1 said : Please set the battle again for a lap of Nurburgring bitch!! !!*__*
Put that Lamborghini against the new Rimac Nevara
People arguing the F1 wasn't on softs and had high downforce specs. Dudes, the Lambo had semi-slick street tyres and a spoiler. The F1 was specced well for the race, this is not a race track, it's an airfield with bumpy surface.
The car isn't worth that much at all. That's the R&D budget for the season. Plus, this isn't even comparable to what those other 2 cars can do. So dumb.
Were Mat driving Yianni's?
Aerodynamics, wheel grip, bhp, lightweight, that's why supercars more insane
Wow!
It must feel bad that a $250,000 car wins a $62.5 million F1 lol
Everyone seems to be talking about the F1 car going around a track. Of course an F1 car would dominate around a track regardless what it's running against. My F350 dually would beat all of these $$$ cars... in towing. This is an apple and oranges comparison and a  drag race in which the lambo was a  beast.
So a dentist in his factory stock Tesla Plaid would hit second place in drag racing here.
You should use a f1 2020 car and have ers, drs, and softs
On any track, the Red Bull will outclass the rest of the cars
how much is that gtr
So an F1 with a weight power ratio < 1 loose in a drag race against a Lambo with a ratio > 1? 🙄🤔 I bet the torque is the responsible 😁
The F1 car is really ment for cornering. It’s a big go-kart
Remember people Nissan GT-R & F1 was turned down.
turbolamik opel corsa 1050hp , 1070Nm, time 1/4 mile 8,9s , 1/8 mile 5,9s , engine R32 VW.
Kawasaki H2 r next
Neooooooooowwwwmmm
Sounds a bit sus when you listen to the F1 cars revs, maybe just the editing but the rpm doesn’t seem to rise as quick and at one point stays at the same rpms
ต้องสลับที่บ้างวิ่งแต่เลนเดียว
Kinda not fair when both cars are awd and the F1 is rwd
We love Mat! Keep him until he retires!!
El obvio, un V12  de 1200 caballos vs creo una V10 o 2 V10
220 mph in the rain, no roll cage, no helmet, no prayers. I hope you brought a change of underpants.
Ламба 772 лошади/тонну, формула 1 1153 лошади/тонну ! Дед там заснул за рулём ?
Bee 🐝
RB on hard compound tyres with big downforce at least on rear wing, but I absolutely love it
Actual race is at 3:31
Lmao Mat is so scared of the F1🤣
A F1 from hard tyres, tem que ser Soft tyres.
That F1 sound and shifting!  Sigh.
Ok great vid. But that f1 sounds like a mosquito at 3AM…
Na prostej każdy idiota potrafi dajcie jeden zakręt  i lambo leży
Bunu izlemesi çok heyecan vericiydi 😂👍
20 year old F1 car will destroy any roadgoing car....shows how lame F1 has become
where’s the supra 🤓-
but this type of f1 is old in present it is rb16b of f1.
"If the team are happy I'm happy"... lol. The Borg lives !
Can we just be amazed that the lambo ran 220MPH in slightly damp conditions!? 👏🏾👀
The Lamborghini is a beast in both the drag and the Rowling race but is it good for the track😹
I was thinking the formula 1 car would win but crazy is that Lamborghini 🤯 in the drag race
Sounds like a brummie
Unfair race. Lambo clearly jump start. What a shame. Purposely to look down the japanese car. Plain dickhead
the F1 car is not even on soft tires, its hard
Lamborgini is always king of hihgway
next time bring the 1600hp gtr vs 1200hp lambo vs 2000hp nevera
All those cars cant compete with hoonigans gymkhana ford f150 which is 1600hp🥱😅👍
Real videolar da ,tüm spor Japonların ve f1 otomobillerin , Lamborghini yi geçtiğini görünce ,lambo kariyer katliamından kurtulabilmek için ,kamera çekim kalitesinden oluşan bir reklam videosu çektirmiş 😂😂😂😂 evet, eğlenceli reklam 😅😅😂
Try that race again with a stock 1000 cc motorcycle and that Lambo won't even touch the bike
The fabulous screw perinatally film because pepper visually float afore a ludicrous competitor. well-groomed, knowledgeable stage
#carwow @carwow please do race between tt lambo huracan and Bugatti Chiron . I think lambo will be win .
They filmed the F1 car revving just once, then filmed Matt's reaction in every car it raced against. Just saying.
F1 cars don't need to be fast from 0km/h.
3:28
Lambo 😍😍
This lambo is insane...
lambo is AWD, will crush off the line.
What I find strange is you give power figures in imperial measure but torque figures in metric? David Coulthard - Legend.
GTR ALWAY LOSE FOR THIS CH.
If the DRS was on DC whould have won by a mile
F1 cars don’t have traction control anymore 🤷🏻‍♂️
Suuuuuupraaaaaa!!!!
let use rolling antilag on those GTR
Don't forget F1 is N/A (naturally aspirated) haha
Put another 6 cylinder in that GTR and that thing will be flying
Pls do that with a f1 2021 gar
Huracan 1200 HP vs rimac Nevera 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
H2R hmm not bad
WOW !!!
A lot closer when you don’t jump the start lol
🇯🇵👍
and now do it with ONE corner :)
Amazing Lambo! Wow, it's most fast for all!
What you actually came here for starts at 3:30
Quit with the damn ads you Brit!!
GT-R: biggest horsepower but aerodynamics of a brick.  Formula 1: very lightweight, but downforce adds monstruos drag and air stops it from going further.  Lamborghini: ballistic shape reduces drag and cuts air to maximize speed as possible.
The formula 1 car sounded like it broke the sound barrier at 7:40
It's pretty fucking stupid how they're acting like the gtr was so far behind when it was only a tenth of a second behind the F1. Obviously it lost but not by far like they're saying it is.
750 competing with that kinda power tells you how badass a f1 is…
I'm surprised something didn't break in the lambo as soon as you revved the engine. Usually just driving on the highway at the speed limit can break something that will cost 7 grand to fix.
Show Brasil Natal ponta negra
Imangine how many euros it cost to tune the lambo like that
Love that the F1 is a Honda 😂
the F1 car is 10 years old mind
F1 cars sound like shiite.      Lambo all day!
3:30
So hp per ton numbers Lambo 701hp per ton GTR 643hp per ton F1 1047hp per ton
Hi Mat. Formula One vs Rallycross, please. My son asked. Thanks
Do it with a r-34
But does the F1 car have DRS
The diference is in the gear ratio, in the weigth and finaly on aerodynamics
And now one Round on a Race Track.....
Cool
Careful not to crash any of those cars, you want them at max hp if you plan on winning any battles.
That Lambo!!! Crazy
Gtr didn't have the proper tune
GTR is grand theft robbery
race the f1 around a track
i know from the thumbnail that the lambo is gonna win lmao i mean dont mess with lambo with no rear bumper lmao
Can we have a top fuel dragster now 🥲🥲🥲. I'm desperate to see that monster compete against these minions.
Maybe they should pour a few more gallons of RedBull in the F1 car to increase speed.
-DAMN THAT LAMBO IS FAST! Matt got so serious he was scared for the 1st time! LOL!
Well... why not race the lambo againts a nitro methane top fuel dragster? I mean your trying to drag race an f1 car
My prediction before watching is the F1 - lighter = faster  Damn - guess I was wrong. Now see who has a fastest lap time lol
I wonder what would've happened if Matt hadn't kept jumping the start.
You definitely jumped the start on the 2nd run. The thing with the F1 car is that he wasn't getting off properly from the dig. His reaction time was slow, and those cars aren't meant to be launched from a dig. With the power to weight DEFINITELY being in favor of the F1, it should've pulled you in the first 1/8th, while you and the GTR should've been reeling him in during the last half.
Sorry but that Gtr is not making 1300hp.
Impressive cars WOW
F1 shat on.
I’ll save you time. Lamborghini, Formula One, GTR. First race starts 3:30
The moment in life when you gap a F1 car...
I wonder what the Tesla plaid would do
Imagine driving a $60million car and getting whooped by a $1/4million lambo
Koga ste stavili da vozi bold F1
What about a standing 1 mile?
that start is too slow for a f1 . f1 has thd quickest launch there
Until a Tesla comes along
A track lap challenge would be great. But the Lambo is very impressive on drag.
I am sorry this is stupid. The RED BULL is not on Soft, the Wether is light rainy and look on the rears the runway is very dirty. Do this in Silverstone once more.
In Germany we call this: Autobahn
don't waste your time watching this long drawn out video, wake me up when they actually race
Unfortunately the road was wet.  If the road had been dry the F1 car would have been better in 1/4 mile.
and a tesla plaid beats them all. Let the whining begin!
modern f1 has more than 1000 hp does lambo beat? Where to Red Bull Racing to hand over a Red Bull for a challenge?
Lol 1300 hp gtr can't even ran an 8 sec must be a gay as tune .who ever tune it u need to come to Australia and learn from us ahaha.i know my gtr. 1300hp should run low 8 sec not 9 sec lmfao 🤣  I wonder is it the tune or the car don't even make 1300hp ahaha
Trading my corolla & buying lambo tomorrow 😅
Wtf the GTR waited 1 sec before going ?
missed the first one, but lambo DEFFS jumped 2nd race
"Where is he, I wanna do this again!" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
i cant be the only one seeing only the 3rd attempt he didnt jump the launch to soon??
GTR: loses.  GTR fanboys: but the GTR is not a strait line car! Can the F1 car take turns?
Kinda unfair that the f1 car is on cold slicks
The impressive thing about the f1 cars is that they could make 1/4 mile with corners at almost the same time as on the straight.
should’ve turn on DRS
I'd love to see this huracan against the Rimac Nevera
Lambo starts early on both races :/
I would like to see the same matchup but without the tuning on the Lambo.  TBH I thought the F1 would have an edge on the first few hundred yards, but maybe Mat jumped the start.
Great. Now repeat this competition on a race track with corners. That’s what racing cars are designed for. This was like beating Bruce Lee in armwrestling and thinking, you are stronger than him.
I have always liked the Lamborghini because it is such a beautiful car and has the power to stand up for itself. My only problem is the cost of the car, the maintenance and parts.
Yes. Jumped by a mile. Twice.
A 8 year old F1 car without softs, drs or ers, which is not made for drag races. Remember F1 is the pinnacle of motorsports and the playground of some of the best engineers.
I would love to see a Indy Car in this I believe Indy Car would win in the straits compared to F1 but on a winding track the F1 has it from what I’ve read
Son los pilotos los basuras, el men del Lamborguini se adelantaba y el GTR es mas rapido y le puede ganar solo que son los pilotos
F1: ok lets add some turns and corners and 50 laps more
the lambo got like 400hp+ on the F1. And the F1 still made it reasonably close.
Nissan Gtr is the best driver is a diferent
No, you didn't jump the start, the other two were sleeping!
Hard tires lol
you can’t fuck with a no bumper lambo
power to weight ratio is almost the same between the Lambo and the F1. 4WD makes a huge difference!
I can’t think about a whiter video than this
It's David Coulthard on Redbull?
I expected the F1 to do better than it did due to it's drastically lighter weight. Not surprised about the Lambo/GTR outcome though.
This guy reminds of a kid if he didnt get any sweets he would throw a tantrum
ridiculous race! make sure that the f1 does not slip all that time
GOOOoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOoOOOoO F111111111111111
The Lamborghini launches so fucking hard holy shit
That Formula car is amazing.  The Lambo isn't very impressive.  The Nissan wasn't impressive at all.
Insane race guys bout want to see you doing a race with the Hennessey Venom GT
Awesome.....Lamborghini destroyed them lol
That was surprising that the Lambo beat the Formula One
that F1 car has that fast and the furious gearbox... with all of the camera cuts it sounded like it had 14 gears lol
⭐️Plant for Planet. I ❤️🌵🌴🌲🌳🌎🌍🌏🌹⭐️
The Corvette ZR1 beat these clunkers each race. What? You didn't see it? That's because the Vette was already at the finish line and the driver was out, had a cup of coffee, took a whiz, and had a nap.
I wonder where a Tesla S Plaid would be in that race. Put it in race track mode and see who gets off the line fastest.
I always thought that formal one cars were the fastest in the world
The Lamborghini was monstrous.
11yr old kids be like a tuned supra would gap the lambo
WOW I simply love the huracan.....one lucky sod owns that 😭
lol, lambo jumps start each time
millions of dollars to run 9.0s??? LOL
Get the RB16 to race you, I wanna see that.
I think that the gtr has the long gears and thats why it loosed
If the team are happy, I'm happy! 🥲
f1 could win easy in racetrack
1/4 world record belongs to an Electric car ..
Race a supra  haha you lose
Put some softs on that red bull and it will obliterate the lambo
Put the soft tyre on.
Tesla beat all of those easily :P
I think just by looking at the braking disadvantages of the other cars vs the f1 car In the race with cornering and turning the f1 would demolish. It's almost as if it is made for that kind of racing 😂
I mean that RB dates back in 2011, meanwhile the other cars are like 8 years younger or sth. I'd like to see SuperMax with RB21 insteaddd
Gtr 1300 hp and he finish third big fake
All I want to ask is u might want to check his seat
i have nissan gtr the horse power is 1235
Unless they repainted the Red Bull, it not the Championship winning car because that one was a V8 from Renault where the one here was the Turbocharged V6 Hybrid from Honda.  What I'd like to see would be the Lambo and the GTR up against one of 90s V12 F1 cars that had around 1000 horsepower.  Or better yet to be a better match, one of the 80s Turbocharged monsters with 1500 horsepower.
Y the formula car sound like a rc car?
Let me drive my Lancer on that track you'll gonna be left behind, credits to the F1 car just right behind Lambo for a second
I thought hp means hp of free fire 😂
That lambo caught the others napping. Lol.
Lambo is a beast
0:05 sooooo that number plate basically says fucker lol
Dude in the lambo jumped the first two races
Note: the downforce in the F1 car is very considerate in regards to slowing it down. And keeping it from flying off into the distance.  Note: the F1 car has a far higher power to weight ratio than any other cars full stop. So in terms of straight speed if it didn’t have downforce it would become an aeroplane. Meaning that essentially the F1 was racing with rather large training weights.
Now take some corners . .
The Formula 1 car has way more down force for cornering.
It would be hilarious to put these three against a Top Fuel Dragster
The start is great what he wanted to say "oh sh**"
Nothing lime making a 10 minute video about somthing you could have done in 3
Difference is the F1 car can do it round corners.
Im not a fan of super cars but I'll definitely want tht lambo tho
Is that fuckin bear grylls
One of those earlier F1 cars with V12 would be wonderful to watch. @carwow
So,if you guys watching the video from the begining they "forgot" to mention  the F1 car weight by not a mistake im sure... is 640 kg + 2000-5500kg downforce(depends from the wing tilt or angle . So actually a 750 hp and 2700-6200kg car racing against a approximately same weight but double, 1200hp cars with launch and traction control ,whic also doesnt have in F1 car in fuck*ng rain.  This 2.4l v8 F1 engine is brutal. Also with hard tires while raining and full wet the track,what a joke poor redbull just spining out in 1st and 2nd gear . Just put that F1 engine in  lambo 750HP and GTR 1300hp please  "hold my beer".
you jumped the 2nd, i dont know about the first one tho, quite close to a perfect start i guess
Lol I knew that gtr had no chance
This race reminds me of the Escudo Pike's Peak in Gran Turismo 3
700kg !!
Great lambo..
H2R: hold my beer 😌
Lambo TT is a monster
if you let david drive the lambo and turn abs off he would brake in a shorter distance
the lambo jumped the first two times
That Lambo is fucking nuts
Just skip to 6:50. You're welcome
Please just get a motorbike to race that lambo now
Now imagine the F1 wasn't on standards from 10 years ago.
Since retiring David Coulthard has been having a blast doing these things a regular driver cannot do. Has he really retired (still sits in F1 car, races them and in full uniform with RedBull engineers, crew etc) or just had a altered role. You decide.
The F1 is on Hards, not even a Medium let alone Softs.
Remember Kids, this F1 car (RB7) is now (as of this video in 2021) is a DECADE old car (from 2011).
now go to a racetrack and repeat..and get eaten by the f1 car..
Honda, not Renault? Are you sure about that??
Really thought the weight the the F1 car would give it the drag win so that's super impressive from both road cars...well if you can call them road cars
Did not expect this outcome at all.
wow straight line :D what about some laps and then see which one is really fast
F1 car was having more drag..
Matt actually looked worried on that first start!! Love it
Would've been really cool to see what both cars can do on a proper track with turns, I know the Lambo and GTR aren't made for that but curious to see what insane horsepower does to lap times.
Im interested to see if both cars (that is not tuned) can top with the modern f1 cars
There is as svj twin turbo in the Eua u gotta do a race
If they had to a lap around a circuit you would see the gap in time, F1 cars are not Drag cars
"Hi mum i just out dragged  a formula 1 in my lamborghini"  ( lol )
Imagine fighting drag race at absolute formula 1 track race, that lambo will get smoked
That little one going head to a f1 car
They need that lambo as the safety car for F1 😂
Damn thats a fast Volkswagen! ;)
The modded lambo needs to get a nerf lmao
Man, somebody get that gtr driver a pillow.  That gtr has the best launch system by far but the worst driver.
Skip ahead to 3:30 if you want to see the cars actually move. 1/3 of the video is talking.
Take the front and rear wing off.   F1 car wins. Probably 10 to 20 times the downforce in current setup.
For the price of lambo, it shouldn't breakdown. But it does, alot.
The f1 car was on its slowest tires too 😂
64.m for what
You have to consider the f1's tires weren't warm up
Is it just me or does it sound like the f1 isn’t hitting full rev. Also I do agree it looked like the labo was leading a little but not too much. Labo won by a lot but I still think the f1 is a true winner. Modern f1 cars are another thing to consider. I think it is the Mercedes that makes the turbo six with a split turbo hot side on back abs cold side on front of the engine with two exhaust inlets for the turbo for a faster more balanced spool of the turbo and then colder intake temps for more power and smaller lighter engine.
The F1 at the worst view of the arm drop! And I'm sure Matt foot was already pushing the gas before he said go on the radio! The positive traction Lambo had a big advantage with positive traction! The F1 is not made to drag race!
250 million?
Who TF edited this!?!? Just show the f'in race, why all the cut scenes?!? Know what I hate about watching the NHRA? Not enough cut scenes while they go down the track...
They got a frickin F1 car but no starting light.😟
Get the rimac out 😁
Why this drag race takes 10.5 minutes is beyond me.
I am suprised about the GTR tho.
Would have been interesting with warm and red/soft tires on that Red Bull
And they said the new Tesla beat them all.... I need to see that.
In a proper race that f1 car would have slaughtered the other two, much faster when you don’t have to slow down around corners
can you make the race with a 2019 formula one car ?
Sebastian Vettel should drive the Red Bull...than the Red Bull would win
We need slightly more modern f1 cars maybe the 2016 f1 car
Guessing the F1 car would have been a lot closer, if not faster, if it wasn't on slicks on a wet track but still surprised the lambo did that much better.
Stupid race and all canal. This compare is radiciulus. My english is bew
This is just so stupid.. Bringing an F1 car on a drag race? A DRAG RACE?!  I mean, come on! What are you even trying to prove here? Even if Max Verstappen or Louis Hamilton is driving that F1 car Versus ME (an unskilled nobody who only knows how to drive my 2004 Kia Picanto) driving that Lamborghini on a drag race would surely beyond reasonable doubt that I can easily win any given time over that underpowered F1 car! Probably, even a child can tell that that F1 car would loose to that Lamborghini!  There is nothing worth watching here on this particular vlog/video.. All I only saw  was just how they were mocking and humiliating a Formula 1 car (that even the guy who drove that F1 car was pissed and how he and the F1 car was insulted! This is just pure arrogance!  If you really want to test that Lamborghini's speed and power, do it! But please do not drag ANY Formula 1 car into that kind of race (Drag Race) ever! EVER! Because that is just STUPID! You would look like an IDIOT feeling good about yourself laughing and smirking thinking that you had beaten a Formula 1 Car ON A DRAG RACE while watching it from the side/rear mirror of your Lamborghini! Truth be told brother? You were not even racing at all! Nor "Testing" your Lamborghini on how it would perform against an F1 car.. Frankly speaking your real chances of winning against a Formula 1 car is 0%..  If you really want to test that Lamborghini of yours on how it would perform against a Formula 1 Car, then take the fight to the Formula 1 Car!.. Take your Lamborghini into the world of Formula 1!  Let me pick a Constructor's Car for you to compete with! Forget Red bull! Forget Mercedes! Forget Ferrari!..  HAAS' Car would be enough..  Driver?.. Nah! Not Louis Hamilton! Nor Valtteri Bottas! And definitely not Max Verstappen!.. 😂😂😂  Nikita Mazepin would do just fine! 😂😂😂  So, Drivers would be: You against Nikita Mazepin Cars: Custom Lamborghini vs HAAS' VF-21 Racetrack: Suzuka International Racing Course Laps: 10  GOOD LUCK!!!
My guess is that F1 smokes the other 2. If it doesn't I blame the driver.
Now try a road course and see what happens...
I would bet that the f 1 car is the fastest of all 3.. now i know .. Bad..  2.   .. omg
Fake
Green car jump start
Drag starts at 3.30
Funny, the f1 gets ass kicked by a 1300 hp gtr and a 1200hp lambo and in another carwow video the f1 kicks ass on a bugatti ? Doesn't makes sense lol
Matt the cheater
Let’s not forget there’re Huricans and GTRs with if 2000HP
Bella prova, ma assolutamente inesistente dal punto di vista oggettivo. Una Formula , così come altre categorie di auto progettate per la pista, ha un carico aerodinamico ed un peso, progettati per poter essere veloci nelle curve. Se in questo video si fosse inserita anche solo una semplice chicane, la F1 avrebbe stravinto. D'altro canto, 1.500 kg, in curva, si fanno sentire :)
3 races...3 wins? False. 3 races...2 false starts/DQs...and 1 win. Also, a rolling start that wasn't even remotely even.
Lambo is using automatic gear. F1 does'nt have automatic grear. Plus the road is not made for F1 tyres they should have used griped tyres for this surface. Plus we are not sure about the DRS of this F1 car... I know F1 is about corners but this drag race seems baised to me.
Well guess f1 aren't well suited for straight line race
Line up a top fuel dragster and watch nitro take them doen that 1/4 miles in under 4 seconds. Its the loudest thing you'll ever hear.
Is this kirkbride airfield?
Nice to see Anton lebec has a side job from dancing.
3:27 You're welcome
Now take them all on a proper circuit and watch the lambo cry behind the f1.
The F1 car has crazy downforce and braking and isn't designed for drag racing lol. It'd slay them on the track. Impressive engineering regarding all the cars though, they are likely all equally as unreliable and problem prone haha but the smiles per gallon are worth it.
It's all about horses for courses . No vehicle does laps quicker than an F1. No vehicle is quicker than a top fueler on the strip and street cars are better than both on the street.
And don't forget the lambo had massive turbos and the other cars did not.
Is it old F1?
Coulthard has done a Hill and turned grey overnight
To all drag race video creators !! Can you stop with the "Fast and Furious" 30 second drag race edits ! At a minimum,  show the straight up race, PLEASE!
Tbh in 2012 I believe they changed the F1 engine to a better one and also the F1 car is with hard compound tyres which are the slowest tyres
The curvy step-grandmother prenatally charge because insurance physically exist amidst a strange cut. fantastic, bitter sheet
That Lambo is insane!
Stopping power lol now throw them a curve or two. See ya!
Cheater
No drs and no softs 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
The lambo is scary deleted bumbers haha
GTR kept up
That Lambo off the line looks like a 4WD car vs a RWD car off the line in the snow. It just gets up and GOES!
Now go round a corner.
Personally I didn't found that F1 revving sound appealing, but rather like 2003 shitbox ricer civic
CARWOW deserves billion followers.... unlucky because not all people know this amazing youtube chanel !!
both times the lambo jumped the gun, DQ for the lambo
Tesla S Plaid as a car no4 would be really interesting. 0-130mph/0-200kmh in around 6 seconds
*Living the dream, Living the dream.*
That lambo is is tuned, while gtr is stock.
Try going around the corners at that speed like an F1.
What a treat!
In the thumbnail, one of the tires is backwards on the Lamborghini
And no one talking about Gtr, I can't even believe it's lost. I know that the Gtr is the one who lost the most fastest bike in the world which is the Kawasaki H2r. Grrr.🙄🙄
Just utterly pointless
But hector is running 3 spooner engines with nos
tbh formula 1 lost the drag race from the standing start because it is too light and can't get all the power from the wheels to the ground... while the heavier 4 by4 cars have no such problems... and since power to weight ratios are kinda similar in ideal conditions formula 1 should get of the line quicker than those cars.. it just doesn't have enough grip at low speeds due to lack of downforce. During rolling starts, the weight of the cars is much less impactfull and both those cars are nearly twice as powerfull, so once they get to higher speeds, formula 1 can't keep up ... Formula 1 top speed is not the best at about 350 km/h so there are many road cars that are faster in a straigth line especially once that have more than 1000 hp XD... BUT there is no faster car on the planet around a race track nonetheless
and now, folks, let's pack some curves to it ...    lambo & GT-R left the chat
Do i hear a farm truck aproaching?
My only question is..  Whos the party so sore that they had To remove Renault from livery and replace it with Honda text? After all its Renault v8, But jsut looks stupid As now has Honda text on side of it.
ngl i,d love to see that lambo against a kawasaki H2 or an H2R
the sound of the former f1 cars 😍😍😍😍
Matt in the Lambo from the rolling start "I've just f***ed off!" 🤣🤣👌 acceleration on that Lambo looks insane!!
Boring... Even My Renault Twingo is faster than this Nissan
Put the f1 car on softs
Why they dont set the F1 in top speed mode??? F1 cars are setting in every circuit circumastanses. F1 has 500 kmh top speed
A f1 car has about 1000hp
you drive on the wrong side!
Jumper 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think the f1 would win in a race between the lambo in a race track🤔 tell me if im wrong.
What, didnt formula ones are around 1000?
If you pause at the right moment you can see Lambo's move when her hands are still up. And that happens with both races
surprised even at a straight race the f1 lost.  Its weight to power ratio is far better than the other 2
Where’s the v12 or v10 f1?
that gtr is not tuned well XD i know how fast tuned gtrs are and they are faster than a bugatti whean good tuned
Entertaining, however, these cars weren't meant to be raced in this manner. The F1 car is the Most Disadvantaged. The GTR is Disadvantaged in weight...it's much heavier. Throw some Curves in the mix, and see who comes out on top. 👍🏻
F1 car sounds like a drill
Put that lambo up against a model s plaid
Can you put air on the Lamborghini tires please
The problem with the GTR is its weight. You should've brought a dodge challenger into this. Because that Hellcat engine doesn't mess around.
Sorry GTR fanboys lol
Lambougayney
😳🤯 Whaaaaaaaat?! 62.5M?! For a F1?! Thats so much money!
Ofcourse this is not an fair comparison as the Lamborghini and the GT-R are both ultra high tuned and far away from being stock. F1 car is just ''stock'' and unbeatable on a track.
There is the Proof Jdm is crap
Now add a mk4
Now, take a corner ...
You know a gtr is slow when it’s 90 percent stock. Then the lambo. Yea.. formula 1 2011 I think he said.
You need the most insane cars to beet F1. However, when entering a corner. Nothing beats f1
I'm happy Lambo is getting ready for the Tesla Roadster's 8.8s 1/4 mile :)
We need this with added Tesla Plaid.  Only thing Tesla losses big time in is its lack of awsome V10 sound.
Remember when 250 horses was a lot??
try again on a better surface, RB7 with softs....
Never race with a lambo who is without bumber😂
Poor F1 driver...i never belive F1 will lost...
Wrong car...he shd use Rimac
Power to road not power to wheels Add a bend and its a different world
Actually I’m impressed by the gtr I expected it to lose by more
The F1 had to start in 2nd gear and still got wheelspin. Imagine if it had softer rubber and 4wd like the Lamborghini...
real shithole is gtr.....made in china and fake
Now go around a corner at speed
Is that Vettel’s f1 car
All I gotta say the F1 driver can't drive that Red bull and of course this is staged
You should definitley do this again, but in the F1 car, let it use soft tires and let the driver get the tires up to optimal temps, that’s when the F1 car really shines
Why don't you use a 2021 F1 car?
And now turn.
lambo without bumper
4:02
Where is rimac here ? To absolutely destroy  each and one of u :D
its only a 2011 f1 car aswell imagine a 2020 or 2021 car
how about a corner.  i know who wins then
Lamborghini vs Ferrari please (old cars..not automatic) please please please please please
what is the point of this test? How to tune a lambo to beat a gtr and f1?
Let's take a single CORNER. Then you will see what F1 is... ;)
Great job guys.  Would love to see a top fuel dragster  out there just for shits and giggles lol
F1 cars aren’t designed to be quick from 0-50mph, but from there to 150mph it would blow the doors off any street legal car.
if it was Old generation 2000hp of F1 car.  what do you think?
Imagine that lambo againsts a gutted plaid tesla I want it to happen the record for the gutted plaid for a quater mile is also the same as the lambo.
Cold tyres though
lambo jumped  race 1 and 2  ....
Why do we rarely see Bugatti and Pagani drag race video?
lamborghini with a turbo. Damn f*ckin hell
Now put them on a track and watch the f1 car lap both within 3 laps.
Lambo keeps jumping
RedBull and Coulthard, f-ing weak... sure they have tons of more HP, but still... FFS....
Red Bull  is too slow
I kind of think 1000+ horsepower GTR will go faster than 9.3 seconds y’all need to ramp at Tune up
why lambo always starts on the 1 2, not 3.
its really weird imo the gtr has 1300hp and does 9.3 my friend dad got a 2012 r35 gtr and 827hp and do the 1/4 IN 9.9SEC
That F1 car sounds more like a RC car lol
Formula 1 cars are not made for straight line speed, the are meant to carry speed around corners.
https://youtu.be/3JeZ5Q-jlnM
that was awesome!
My old school mate DC! :)
Crazy speed.. Considering horsepower.. F1 is superb
I think in a proper circuit the f1 car would bust their asses in a straight line. They get to 340 km/h in some straight lines much quicker than now. Also it has to be modified to the right circumstances so it can perform the best out of the car
the LAMBO jumped the start every time!!!!
It's definitely a jump start.
Anyone watch these and always think “Navera would’ve won that” ?
That Lambo is nuts…wow
Lambo wins 👑   Meanwhile porche 911 turbo s.   So you are challenging me.
how to f ur lamborghini
I am pretty sure, that F1 car was a formula b or c class car. Had it been x class or Indy car It would've defeated them both with ease
A LAMBO ONLY 150K?
F1... SOUND like  BEE... 😀😀😀
when i heard the F1 sound, I instantly remembered cars 2
DONT LIKE THE BACK OF THE LAMBO LOOKS LIKE THE BUMPER HAS BEEN RIPPED OFF
There's no reason that F1 shouldn't win. Driver error
F1 with hard compuond... pff
Seeing the weight of the GTR I didn't see it winning in any way at all.
now chuck the nismos engine in the f1 car and find out the speed
There is one problem that I saw in this race for the F1 car and that is that the wipers were on the Lamborghini therefore that means the ground is wet and the F1 is on white stripe tires and not on intermediates.  This means the F1 cannot get grip and the wheels were most likely spinning on the ground more than moving the car.
The same on go kart: https://youtu.be/4dgy9dbQWFc
Back in the day the RB7 had 7 gears ( forward). On the day of this shoot, someone bolted a gearbox designed by the fast and furious wankers.......
Saw that lambo earlier after leaving Japfest that thing is nuts
Jumped just about all the starts, not even level going 50mph
Det falsk
Ok,  the F1 car has an insane budget. You have to bear in mind the relentless restrictions put upon the F1 over the years. In fact most of the budget is generated because of those restrictions and eecking out what you can. The banning of turbos cars, the banning of active suspension, the banning of launch control, the list goes on and on.. The road going cars only have to pass road safety specifications with no real limitations on performance as long as the local joey can drive it. The Mclaren 1988 MP4 had around 1200bhp...........Just imagine what we would have had 32 years later had there not been the restrictions that were in place in F1 on maybe half the budget.
jump the start 2 times!!!
I think the Hoonicorn would smoke them all.   I feel the F1 wheels aren’t warm enough and the road probably isn’t as good as a track, so that’s probably why it’s so behind.
Fun fact: GTR is on parking speed without pressing the gas pedal
They should bring the current F1 RedBull RB16B with Max Verstappen.
Insanely fast cars the turbos on the Lamborghini are INSANE
That Lamborghini is INSANE
Rimac vs Ferrari f2004 vs 2020 Mercedes f1
OMFG THAT LAMBO IS INSANNEEEE!!!!!
So the moral of this story is that an F1 car is absolutely no good at jumping traffic lights (interesting).
You actually looked EXTREMELY SCARED  🤣😂🤣😂🤣
That lambirghini is on dream car give aways up for raffle! Defo bought a ticket!
Literally why I don’t watch so called “F1” anymore.
Yeah, and then you just add a turn to the track and the f1 car just kicks your asses!
he had false start like every time hahaha
soo to think of it if you buy a hypercar or supercar you litteraly get a f1 car what is faster,more comfortable and you can drive it on the roads its sick!!!!i was sure the f1 car gonna beat them but no even the f1 car was hardly beat the nissan.
thats would be different if the F1 was a V10
Nobody was expecting the F1 car to win, but add some corners into the mix and it’ll be the only one left standing
Dude WHY IN HELL DID YOU SAY #$%#$ IM 10 YEARS OLD
Try with Kawasaki H2R
what if a supra trespassed !
NEXT: 1200hp Lamborghini vs 1600hp GT-R. I think they both did 8.9 sec.
3 races, 3 wins, 2 jump cheats.
I honestly thought the F1 would have a higher pull through the top end. It's insane that a street car can hold it's own against current F1 tech. But honestly I think that's more to do with F1 regulations limiting power, consumption and whatnot. But I'm impressed.
Next time include an electric car too
Starts at 3:28 o7
Hear me out.. that Lambo vs the hoonicorn
fake
Where's the Nitro Funny Car .. Blow all these cars to the weeds . .
The GTR guy didnot pull the speed
Нашёл интересный видос про NFT Game - с реальны доходом. Farmland:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M79BxPZYT6o
I don’t know how much the wheels give but I think if the f1 car had the red tyres then I think the f1 car would have won
Can you get the latest red bull honda to compare, more power in the new engines
You even drive stick m8?
3:29
Something doesn't seem right about the RB7. Feels like the gearing is off.
JM Imports were also the company that did some of the work on the Lambo, great guys, they know their stuff
Drag racing is the missionary position of motorsports. 😴
All three cars are freaking amazing, but cutting off the race before turn one skews the results a bit.
Its kind of like the government vs the people. The government spend 66 million only to be beaten by some guy in a 2 hundy thousand car. Under 120th of the price
Ok, now try taking a corner
This video falls in the category of -  WGAF.
why arent you wearing a helmet?
Try Ferrari F1 2004.
Lambo back end is mutilated
What about a 2021 f1 car
Hard Tires The red tires are better
That way your worked out the price of the F1 car was stupidly wrong. You just dived Red Bulls budget by 4.... That budget included, developmental costs, pay of all the team staff and drivers, AND also included 8 cars, as each driver essentially had 4 cars each, although it really doesnt work that way. 1 F1 car is more so around £10,000,000, but a lot of those parts will be reused throughout the entire season, so it's not really 4x £10,000,000
imagine lambo or skyline doing 90 degree corner at 100mph
That Lambo is absolutely nuts
If the Red bull had slipstream then the lambo would be over.
Drs not even opened smh
now put the f1 car on softs i see u trynna be slick putting it on hards
I am thoroughly surprised by this. I thought the F1 car would absolutely smoke both of them if I’m being honest.
Crash into a wall with all three cars at 200mph. Guess who is the only one surviving?..
Now do 0-100-0mph
The Godzilla 😎
it's not fair since lambos  are meant to be more top speed then anything while gtr is good for starts and then the f1 is good for speed around the corners
False start from the lambo
Didn't expect the f1 to lose
Why not DRS for the F1 Car ?  Sadly it's a RB7 from 2011 so it got a V8 that's just can't compete with actuals Hybrid-V6
Just taking look to the breaking test you can understand that F1 is a masterpiece in everything. But onestly that Lamborghini is a monster 🤩
N importe quoi. 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Huracan vs Buggati🙌🏻 pls next video
We want this lambo with bugaati
Bugatti chiron vs lambo we want this
That’s nuts. I was really confident the F1 car would still beat the others with its huge tyres and high power to weight ratio. I realise racing is all about power round corners but still...
Lamborghini starts early every time
Did not expect the lambo to smoke everyone.
How a Lombardi is faster than a f1 car
Lamborghini DRIVER YOU CHEATED! GOZILLA would have you for lunch if he got a fair start!
F1 is for cornering dip shit
Amazingly, a nice top fuel dragster will run the 1/4 mile in under half the time of these cars. But they aren't very good in the corners. The Lambo is nice!
9.3 seconds for a 1300 horse GTR? LMAO Either he's too scared to drive or he's on a low boost setting.. A 1300 AWH GTR does 8 second passes all day long.
That lambo is just....  I need one.
imagine the GTR had launch control
Shocked at this, I thought the F1 car would have left them for dead.
That Lamborghini is 😭😭😭
We want a Toyota supra(not d bmw one) in a race😁
I don’t think the prise for the F1 car is fair in comparison of the the two other cars  The production set up cost and development for a nissan is also millions if not more The same can be said about the lamborginni Th millions tou talk about fir the F1 car is also development and general cost of personell etc . Max  The downside is that an F1 car can’t be bought by “ normal” users
مستحيل!!! الفورميلا1 اسرع
I think i know this Lamborghini, it must be tuned by ExtremeTuners in Greece.
Why not soft tires on F1??
the fact he said the car cant be as good as it could be at 1:17
Just curious, why do I see a lot of TT Huracans and Gallardos but almost no TT Aventadors or murcielagos? Are V10s easier to tune or more reliable than V12s? Or is it the much higher price of V12s?
What.. Lamborghini was very fast OMG.
GTR 1300 hp??? mmmmmmm or the driver dont know how to run it.
They new F1 cars pack around 1000HP++ using a 1.6L V6 twin-turbo engine combined with a powerful ERS. The likes of new Hamilton's W12 or Verstappen's RB16B would absolutely smash these supercars.
Here we know Nissan v6 is crazy😁😁😁
this is execly why nobody watch f1 any more. because is boring. because f1 car should be fastets car on the planet. ok thos speed cars made for straight line competition ok. but as a driweble car for corners allso for reacing, should be fastets of f line, 400 meters and cornes. ant it is just not.  that why nobody like f1 any more.
F1 sound loudly
Amazing race. Although the best bit is the camera front on on DC in the formula 1 car. That gave me such a rush it actually bought a tear to my eye. The camera plus the noise. Wow. Even though he didn’t win he’s a legend.
3:50 its like super Mario hahaahhahah
The only legit race was the third one. Race 1 & 2 , the Lambo had a head start.
Lambo started before the other cars
How did the Lambo mop the floor with the more powerful GT-R?  I think most of these 4 digit highly modded GT-Rs have got power figures just pulled out of someone's ass.
Crazy Lambo😱
lambo jumped twice lol!
That's the thing about F1 cars. They are designed to go INSANELY fast around corners, not in a straight line. Their straight-line speed is *aerodynamically* limited, unlike most road cars, which are either mechanically limited or electronically. They create so much downforce, they can only go so fast to overcome it.  Really fun race, but I'd like to see these things race the F1 car on the track.
the F1 car is also on the hard tire, which has the least amount of traction for F1 dry tires
H2R vs ALL
Wow!
F1 be like get me that Lamborghini
try it with some corners
The Lambo is nuts in a straight line.  Well done to the owner & tuner! 👏🏾👏🏾
Ok yes.. I was just going through all of your videos and the lamboo did it that's the only car that won the f 1 car
Do the red bull team get paid for turning up with a 62 million pound car, and driver, fuel usage etc?
the F1 car is slower in a straight line also because of the amount of downforce it has just pushing the car down into the ground
around an actual race track the F1 car would be like so much faster
Matt is a gangsta
all this from some who cant do a proper vette launch..duh ..absolutely no cred..
Everyone gangster in their tuned gtr until Europe slaps them back down to earth with the tuned lambo
Love this vid. People doesn’t realize though is that F1 car got less than 1000hp Im thinking maybe 700-800hp N/A. They are made for cornering, all grip: traction,downforce,lightweight and hard braking. Unlike the lambo and gtr that are made for quick acceleration and built to stay on a straight line.
Amazing content
I can see Matt did jump the start both times but the second time not by too much
idk if im stupid or something but that looks a lot like the 2021 f1 car sergio peres claro sponsorship gives it away can anyone confim that for me?
tesla plaid vs rimac vs this lambo would be the best race
Wow lambo beat their asses 😳
Amazing video. Loved it.
AWD Advantage with launch control,,, try rolling starts F1 will do better
I'm pretty sure if the Lambo was legit faster than the F1, then all we would see in F1 races is a bunch of tuned Lambos. LOL
The batmobile would be all of them in a quarter mile
That F1 car may be $62.5M...but DC is priceless...
that mega facepalm at the end cracked me up solid :joy:
The breaking distance was absolutely insane cutting that much distance off of a stop means everything in anything but a drag race.
You should do a 1 lap circuit to finish the comparisons. Kkkkkkk
In my head: the F1 got this In my heart: can't bet against a Lambo Moral of the story: Listen to Your Heart
Honda F1 car vs BSB superstock and Superbike
Did he say 60 mil for one car?  Ummm doesnt sound right. Even 6 mil sounds rediculous
USE THE ACTUAL F1
dude really went 220 mph dats insane🔥
Just try with supraaaaaa tartarsaadrw
I'd like to see that Lambo race that twin vr6 golf
LOL....64million f1 vs 150K++ Lambo and GTR....spend 60mio more on the lambo n gtr, each,  they will smoke any f1car on race tracks as well as on drag race tracks!!! And still 4mio less expensive than the f1 car!!!
Lady Chatterly crisis.
The f1 sounds like a fly LMAO
That gtr is all stock vs. Tuned lambo
He cheated every race. The first two races he hugely jumped the starts, and in the last one he hit the throttle and then said "GO"!  Do the whole thing with a proper lighting system, and let's see who wins.
If the track was longer the GTR would of most probably gapped them both pretty sure
Love the way matt looked properly scared when he took off 😂😂😂
That is ember-racing for F1, really that lambo killed it 3 times.. WOW
A totally unsuccessful driver on a GT-R
That was awesome full stop.
That F1 car can't be geared for a drag race, I bet they change a gear in that and it dusts them all off.
I would love to see the race again if the F1 car had soft wheels and not hard ones.
It's just a fun race people, chill out... of course the lambo and nissan would be absolutely humiliated vs the f1 if they ran complete laps, everyone knows that.
The Tesla model s plaid does the 1/4 mile in 9.028 seconds. And that's a family car. F1 definitely needs to get faster with more powerful engines. Really the F1 car didn't stand a chance against none of it's competitors, except for the braking performance.
Such terrible editing. I’m trying to watch a race and the edit cuts in and out purposefully obscuring the race and the sound edits are completely mismatched.    It’s a big no from me.
So building a lambo like this is better than a Bugatti huh... Nice, its worth it
Lambo is well built. Nice work
That F1 car is not impressive at all considering how much it costs. It had the weight advantage so i thought maybe it will do better.
Honda vs Lamborghini vs nissan😂😂
When you would rather have a Nissan than a Lambo.
I hate edited races just for views
9.3 is pretty fast !!
F1 Cars aren't drag racers. But it was still fun to watch.
once u on the track its totally different bcoz of the skill of the driver F1 is too good
For Power and weight F1 car should be the winner
wow that GTR and that F1 is freaking strong one is jus V6 one more jus Na 2.4L
That lambo is on Roids! The monstrosity!
Matt/Anyone know if another car has ever clocked 220mph or more crossing the mile marker?  Is this TT Lambo the fastest ever? (Excluding the Rimac obviously)
Nice, now add a turn into the race, see how that goes.
lambo vs bugatti
Which will get Matt to a vaccination centre the fastest?
F1 car did not give its maximum power
i remeber Mat from carbuyer times 2010 i just know he will be new big thing in auto shows he have charisma...
The f1 car is on hard's #noshot
And now Corners 😁
ok, but how's the RB 16 compared to RB 7? Which one is faster?
Erm... that's a 1.6L F1 engine he's racing there.  One. Point. Six.   Let that percolate for a bit.  How many litres is the Lambo running?
It should have been Ricky's Gtr instead cuz it did 8.82 secs in and drag race event and set an overall record.  Even the lambo lost to Ricky.
it took so hard for Lambo to beat Nissan GTR Beast so Lambo decided to tuned Hard, so Hard 🤣 and as expected CarWow suceeded to downgrade the Japanese Beast GTR 🤣 Bring Original Lambo vs Original GTR it will kickout all
F1 cars are made for high speed cornering not drag racing
The f1 car is using hard tyres. Put some soft tyres on it and let’s do how much quicker it is.
Guy jumped the start twice.
That DMO's lambo? And Jurgen is here!
glad the walkie talkies didnt fall behind the brake pedal - dont do that
All wheel drives vs. rear wheel drive in a drag race? Bruh. . .
Drag Races from Pakistan here ❤️🙋‍♂️
Your just advertising lambo...but the truth is slow in reality..
Arent F1 cars 800-1000 bhp? Also stick twins on the F1 and non of those cars would have a chance!
And f1 cars rnt even made for straight line speed
I'd be interested to see what this would have looked like with the W11 or another modern turbo hybrid F1 car. I'd imagine they are significantly better off the line. Probably should be in Monza spec as well..
he definitely jumped the start on 2 one though
I want to see 1200 hp lambo vs koeinigsegg
That lambo is no joke
Amazing, that F1 car was really something else   If only it had longer ratio box it would have nailed the Lambo and gtr
That formula 1 car is 62 million for nothing
Stupid automatic transmission.
Next time : Lambo vs GTR vs LMP1 Porsche or Toyota 😁
3:31 4:47 5:41
#Script
That Lamborghini vs Rimac Nevera!
Hmmm try that on the race track
Congrats Matt, best car videos on YouTube
The turbos on the lambo at the end of the brake test
🍅😎
"It starts to run out at the top end, so at the mile we would definitely have the advantage over you..."  ... Proceeds to get even more annihilated in the rolling start mile race 😂
Rimac = 8.69.. like a lambo
That was a eye opener. Brilliant
F1 beats them both anyway
First 2 starts were false starts for Lambo. Third one is legit.
That lambo is mental absolute monster it destroyed a 63million dollar f1 car and top out at 220mph 350kmh damn what a car
how the hell is that possible. 8.9 sec, in wet conditions....remember the 1900hp nevera did 8.6 in warm and good conditions...and wtf this huracan? should has more power than 1200! i bet on that. so around 1500 instead,
If you add a corner the red bull would toast you 🍺😎
I doubt if that gtr is 1300 whp it looks to slow I’ve seen Godzilla pull times wayyyy quicker than that crap
Remember the f1 car has to run when it’s tyres are hot when cold they don’t have no grip
The F1 car is on the hard compound tyres where there's almost no tractions. I think if they put soft on, the F1 car would smash the Lambo. But who cares F1 cars are not built for drag racing, it's made for circuit racing where it has the advantage over other cars through the corners.
Do some track work next time, see how these street cars hold up to the F1 car
Juggling radios at 354 kmh 😱
Subtitles for the Scotsman 🤣
Ludicrous Speed!
That Lambo is fast, but just does not look right without the back bodywork. Must admit, GTR fan!
AWD vs 2WD is very fair...
LoL get an F1 driver who knows how to drive one.
What if it is the older 3L V10 F1s? 🤔🤔
Matt, you always jump the start.
That’s impossible, the skyline makes a million horsepower
That gtr driver needs driver mod
What is the music at 6:50 ?
The formula car can still turn at that speed.  The others...disaster.
now try with 3.5L V10 F1 Car
Very exciting and fun to watch but I just can’t fully focus because I’m so distracted by the fact that he’s racing a hyper-modified exotic at 200mph wearing shorts, no helmet and what appears to be shirts made of synthetic fibers. If there were a crash or a fire, his chances of serious burns, head injuries, or worse are unreasonably high.
Try Rimac Nevera vs F1, im sure its faster.
launching an f1 car on concrete with cold tires in the rain. ok.
Well the f1 of now has turbo's and 1000+ hp  but that naturally aspirated engine is music to anyone's ears
F1 car not designed for drag race, though I did think it would be closer.
Gtr price?..yh.. Also this is made up and staged asf cause lambo sponsor better i guess or the f1 driver is just a random dude from the bushes cause there's no way in hell a f1 car loses to any existing car, i've seen lots of different vids and they alway come up on top
Reminds me of the time my eldest son took me for a drive in his Third Evo a mark 9 - when that I believe was a 9 second car - OMG when that thing accelerated or broke it was absolutely crazy change in velocity - rather glad when he sold it!
TT lambo can shit on anything.
F1 is never built for drag racing I am afraid. On the other hand, I would like to see how the Lambo and the Nissan GTR perform on race track compare to the F1.
This is lit
Race starts @ 3:31
F1 car will beat the lambo with soft tyres after a formation lap...
i was expecting yanni to be in lambo
I want to see a drag race against a nascar
Make 3 turns and the race will end with 2 drivers
Should have done a 0-100-0 test.
Bro ...
Hit laguna seca and that formula 1 car would lap you
Same old Red Bull, always losing
I always thought F1 were V10’s 😵‍💫
Tw#t driving the gtr got to stick with prius or so
Comparing apples and pears again are we?
Yeah that Chiron owner should let him drive it with the speed key
When mat said shut up already 😂😂
Braking for the F1 is obviously better, it's built for corners and it's way lighter. Put them all on a F1 track and see who wins.
you jumped the first 2 times
I mean gtr is too much weight comparing to lambo so thats why i think the lambo win💔
4:21 sneaky bugatti
Okay, now put them on the monaco circuit.
The f1 car would be definitely faster with some soft tires instead of hard tires
That Lambo is savage
Where did you get your numbers? Current F1 cars have 1.6L V6 engines and run around 1000 HP.
I love how the lambo jump started twice
Gtr driver little idiot..
Go on a road course! The F1 will eat you alive!!
Ams Gtr 2500hp: "dude, see those kids with their toys?" Supra 3000hp: (eats popcorn) Alpha Queen Gtr 3300hp: do the dishes, 7! Rx7 4 Rotor: Okay mom!
They should swap lanes
They need to do it again with the plaid and nevara...Lamborghini looses.
Successful people don't become that way overnight. What most people see at a glance-wealth, a great career, purpose-is the result of hard work and hustle over time. I pray that everyone who reads this will be successful in life...
Thank‘s I love you guy‘s
Salio re mal F1
It's only old one if you race the new one it's gonna beat the lambo
Finally
Wft with GTR 1300HP SO SLOW!!!
Well once you introduce corners & bends  ..... its a whole new 🌎
Must say I'm a some what disappointed,  I was nearly sure 1300BHP GTR would smash pass the horizon!!
Get Lewis in..
Joki GTR nya noob bngsd 😏
Coming looking for commenters suggesting putting a Tesla in there... Just stop. Enough with the Tesla. Lol
I dislike this video because GT-R not win 😠😠
Do the race with red tires to f1 car for mor grip not with white tires cuz they want a lot to come in best funcion
Well, its not suprising, but the rear suspension gave you a really nice launch, and beyond that at a certain speed power to weight is just dwarfed by power to drag, so the lambo should be the quickest anyway. The f1 car has too much downforce and drag, i bet it would beat you if it was steamlined a lot.
a 2020 f1 car would probably destroy all 3
This Lambo vs LLF GTR 👌🏻🔥🔥
Lamborghini 🔥🔥🔥
You guys should have had at least one lap around the track. The video is not complete.
lambo jumped start twice....
Matt launched when her hands started moving, David launched when her hands hit her legs like he was supposed to.
He s not driving the gtr fast enough
The genuine fear in Mat's eyes every time he puts the foot down
That Lambo just fucks off
Do this race again with a Tesla in the mix.
The red bull would skin both on a lap not a drag
That GTR slow ain’t no way
When will people stop racing F1 cars in a straight line.
“THIS IS ROCKET LEAGUE”
What about the the 9?
the gtr are factory spec! not a 1300😏.. i have 1100hp,why the 1300hp like a rubish like this chanel...manipulate and not honest review...
Is the f1 car tuned?
you always start before them or ahead of them exept for 1 time so for me i cant say if you really win
someone please answer to my query    so cld that twin turbo Lambo be beaten by a nicely tuned , modded R34 skyline?
now add a corner
Hit the showers Boyz. Lol
That’s not a f1 it’s more like a BS1
Who said that f1 it's 750 hp and even so it's a lot litter then the other so this video is fake
Yo that Lambo is nuts!
Race that Lambo againts DMO's twin turbo lambo
O tão  fodão GTR não é lá grandes coisas
The Lambo is sickkkkk 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 Sick cars man, lovin the channel
Lamborghini is awesome
The only time you all launched at the same time was the third race and there wasn't much between the three cars at the end. Just for fun you should have thrown a funny car into the race. Now that would be hilarious to watch.
Anyone know the torque on the formula 1 car?
This video proved the 2009 to 2016 are the worst f1 car of all history.
The jdm kids:🥲🙁
I mean I know the lambo isn’t stock but people say the demons beat lambos are clowns
Your units are a mess, you state horse power but use metric for everything else
🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
wheres Tesla?
You jumped the second race too so if you ask me you lost 2 won 1 as you had a false start but yh nice lambo too be honest
Tomss
Would love to see a Kawasaki H2R battle that lambo.
Remember ppl F1 car's aren't just about speed, its speed and aero around corners
You know it's crazy when a car has more horses than masses
VW Power!
Different story if we were dealing with corners.
You need a better driver for GT-R. His reaction time for both drag races was slower than you.
62 million for a f1 car. what the actual fuck.
Try to do the same setup with the circuit one lap race.
"Stroker"
Tyre setting would be interesting on car comparisons like these. The Lambo rides on Semis, while the GTR is on Sport tyres
He never said how much the Nissan cost ?
It's always feel good when you are jump start 😏
in a circuit the f1 car give 30" to all supercars
The biggest advantage is definitely the mid-engine
F1 car in this race is like a cheetah 🐆 in greyhounds race
The F1 of that era is quick but the power of the later ones, which can be close to 1000Hp would give the Lampo a real competition, Thinking the power to weight ratio the f1 is no1, but the Lampo is a beast. We need the finish speed for each car.  But I feel the F1 car was not at its best.
F1 car starts with hard tyres, it makes a big difference if it started on soft
Mate that lambo
The lambo has the advantage over weight, aerodynamically towards the GTR while the f1 car was definitely not a king of drag race but if you're on a circuit, the f1 car would trash both cars. While the GTR was just so heavy and aerodynamically at a disadvantage.
Hey matt, is it possible to have a drag race with ken block's ford hoonicorn ?  It would be great video i guess. Thank you.
True
F1 is a european philosophy, where you face turns, elevations, steep corners not built for drag racing which is more of a american idea of racing. A more fair race would have to go for 1/2 mile turnaround and then came back to starting line
Put on some soft tire and see..😒
Remember, this is the V8 era F1 car which have around 700-800 hp, the current cars have 900-1000 hp but the 2016 car is probably the fastest of the modern ones while the 2004 might still be the fastest in a straight line
Now do a race with corners lol. The formula 1 car would absolutely destroy
ruined the whole video jumping the line  over and over
Got to do a race with all those car but replace that gtr with alpha queen gtr
Man that  guy  is pist
兩次都偷跑
Well technically the lambo only won the third race since it's the only time it didn't jump the start.
Mauvais départ la lambo a triché
Mantap jiwa
People should remember this F1 car didn’t have DRS and was on hard compound rubber for the run.   They are mid 8’s 1/4 cars in their most aggressive race specs.
Okay I am total F1 fan and last thing in world I expected was an F1 car to bet a 1000+hp GTR in a drag race.
You'd be f#cked on the corners though
Red bull cars of this low hp era are the slowest accelerating f1 cars in the last well maybe ever.
Ok - now how about after 100 starts, what does maintenance cost on each? How about a set of tires?
Drag races are for the ignorants
very  impressive... now  move your ass to Silverstone for a 52 lap race and let's see how that Lambo behaves! 😏
Epic! Subbed
That’s one seriously fast Lamborghini
LOL 😂 weight to horsepower ratio with the GTR is Not equivalent to the gtr … a gtr with 1600 Hp would blast the Lamborghini…
Ok, how the FU*K is that Lambo putting all of its power down!? That's insane... :D
We need 1500hp Huracan vs rimac
Lamborghini is a bast car  I Love Lamborghini ❤️❤️😘😘
The lambo sounds amazing 🤩
But with the price of lambo you can get 10 GTR
Real F1 have 0-200km 4,9 sec and 0-300 9,8 sec. So the video is absolutely FAKE and don't believe it. F1 is the winner for sure.
Models S plaid would smoke all of them in the 1/4
Fam that lamborghini huracan got tuned up ALOT. huracan has no performance like that, the formula should've won that
If the f1 car was running supersofts he would have smoked them
?
That Lambo is insane !! I was expecting the f1 car to win. But damn 🤯🤯🤯 never underestimate a Lambo with no bumpers. 😅
The chap that owns the lambo had a similar set up on a gtr which blew up. Hopefully that doesn’t happen to his lambo
So clearly the F1 car is a huge waste of money
You need to do a rematch with Tesla Plaid
Bugatti Chiron is 🖐️🖐️
Huragan wygrał ej elo
The gtr forget to relase its hand brake....
you forgot SUPRAAAA
How many euros the Lamborghini owner pay them for all that?🤣
Can we borrow RB16b instead? I would camp an hour b4 it premiere...
This lambo make's the GTR and F1 car look "slow" but I'm not sure how many people have drive a sub 10s 1/4mi car and more impressive a sub 9s, just wow.
2021 f1 car would smoke all them
No disrespect to the Gtr or the ones tuned and build it, but there are 1200hp GTR's doing almost 0.5 second faster quarter miles times on none drag roads aswell...
Sounds like David is short shifting though.
I thought these were RC cars
Formel 1 is like Mosquito on Drugs.
But he has not the Soft Tiers on
Those are scripted races
1200hp Lamborghini vs Rimac Nevera
He’s obviously piss off 😂
HAHAHA. YOU ARE FOOLIN YOURSELF AND DONT EXPLAIN TO US. WE DONT NEED IT. WHAT YOU HAVE ARE ALL PRETENDERS. EVER HEARD OF KOENIGSEGG? HEHEHEHE
There’s a rivalry between lambos and gtrs in drag competitions and this vid was made to throw some shade lol
It’s a 2012 car dummie
F1 cars are insane ....
Why do all Japanese cars seem nerfed when carwow reviews them
Him looking around is so careless and dangerous
Holly that Lamborghini was on some mad steroids 🤣
2.5 Million for the F1's.
GTR DIDNT KNOW HE HAD LAUNCH CONTROL!
I hope everyone that reads this my comment will have not only one but several cars even better than this
Nissan Failed me
LET ME DEFEND THE F1 Let's remember that F1 can drive flat out into a corner, the lambo can't. The downforce is so hardcore on the F1 that it could drive upside down on a ceiling. That's all :D
Fake video
That's just a poor comparison between apple and bananas. Each car have a different destination and different field of use. The mighty lambo on a circuit, for instance Monaco, is completely useless, as well as Nismo. Period. If u know what I mean🤔
Claramente manipulado, os cortes deixam isso claro kkkk
we all knew nissans are garbage,, but didn't have to prove it that hard lol
if the f1 car had DRS
The engine of f1 is a renault with v8 2,4 ;) not Honda ! But marketing !
It's good promo for the Lambo, they said the price in comparison with F1 car. I wonder whether DC drove his best. Anyway, 2011 F1 cars were one of the slowest in this century. I'm a bit surprised with the starting seconds, but RB's top speed is really slower because of drag, not sure they got DRS then, rather not. Please do such test with Merc or RB 2019, 20, 21 cars.
F1 is the fastest car in corners, not straight.
@3:30 if you want to skip the garbage.  1300hp Skyline, 1200hp Lambo, 750hp 2011 Redbull F1. There, saved you 3 minutes, you're welcome lol.
Fuck me that lambo is no joke. Despite the early jumps
Lamborghini owner will be like : F1 oh yeah waste of money
Put the Rimac Nevera there and you're all doomed....
I was thinking that there are some mosquitoes and housefly making noise in my room😂
That lamborghini is sick, BUT!!!!! It's not stock so you really can't compare really...lol.
WHY YOU DONT DO A DRAG RACE WITH THE F1 CAR VS THE WORLD RECORD CAR ELETRIC VS DUCATTI V4
Just imagine if the F1 still using a turbo in its engine and not that V6 N/A
Unreal!
What about the 2020 Formula 1 Car up against the lambo and GTR
My dream car is an f1 car with a top fuel dragster engine in it. It’ll smoke anything on the market.
David is getting older 😳 😂 🤣
Yo that lambo is frieking insane
Show us the actual race, not just cool clips
What the hell? The GTR still did 9.3 seconds, that's nuts for something that looks mostly stock.
Next time replace the Gt-R with an 1.3k hp supra...
Let the F1 run red tired and let him warm them up, might be closer than you think.
One word: power to weight ratio!!!!! Even at about half the power of the lambo and gtr that f1 car was so impressive! Explains how cars like Alfa 4C, lotus can take on more powerful cars even without having very powerful engines because they weigh close to nothing!!! Cool video!
Only difference is the fact the Lamborghini isn’t hybrid . And is probs trash over corners , aswell as the fact the fuel would go in ab 30 mins at full speed
Yannymized..
Who care about the Lamborghini and GTR the sound of FORMULA ONE ☝️ it’s just awesome 😎
If you brought a 2000+ horsepower GTR from Texas, it would be a different story LOL
🏎🔊🔊🔊🔊🤤😍😍❤❤
Try drag race with f1 car 2019 please....
As you can see it is all scripted, they let the GTR lose most of the race, the GTR drive is not driven the car hard enough to put down the power to the ground 🤦🏻‍♂️🤣🤣
Race this Lambo against Rimac Niverra!!
I be ok with my nissan versa hatchback 2018 on low gears. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😅😅🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️ nissan gtr very heavy with restrictions if it was with less weight and no restrictions easy 215 mph. F 1 😑 have restrictions too do to how airborne it can gets in races and a few more liters 🙄 now the lambo no restrictions light weight for a big engine. no if al 3 where the same horse power and no restrictions and the same weight with will be a different result of who the winner will be. Most likely it will have being very close. F1 restrictions to lower horse power and to add body kit to increase drag in other to limite the car accident on the track where incremente.
You what? 354 Km/h @ the mile?
My niece did a 7.2 in her Tesla 3. But can’t confirm because she was asleep with the FSD.
Everybody except Matt asleep at the first start..
jumps the start every race
To all the 9 year old kids. F1s are about speed downforce and CORNERS
Jürgen😂😂😂
Put the f1 car on softs nextime haha
sincerely weak f1 !!! pls do with a bmw f1 !!! I have a bmw monster in my personal production !!! I still have work to do!!!beautiful video RESPECT !!!
The Lambo sounds exactly like an R8 :D
The guy in the middle keeps jumping the gun, twas a race between the 2 others🙄
Umm…I don’t think Red Bull puts all of their $250 million budget into their cars😂. They’re usually between $7-10 million
Kawasaki H2R
l'italia vince sempre
اه
Now take them for a lap around silverstone and see what happens.
Still waiting on a equally equipped GTR to make one of these races. Like any of the Alpha series
That F1 car is faster than chiron and That lambo is even more faster than the F1 car. This is nuts
Lambo
When are u going to drive and race the new Nissan z 2022??? And I know you have to the nismo version next can't wait
The 911 : (watching from the other side)~
I think that lambo is faster than the Chiron? Right?
i wonder why dat 1300hp R35 still using a standard exhaust instead of performance exhaust???? n it's look's totally stock outside..
Put on soft tyres on the f1 car and open DRS
David's ego was crushed... lol... 😂
😮 the F1 should be worry.....
so its a slightly detuned GTR... but then 70 thousand pounds worth of lambo tuning... which doesn't really make it a fair race
Bonkers!!!
When DMO Thinks he’s the first for stick twin turbos on a lambo lol
I fucking love Honda’s logo being plastered all over F1
Nissan, while still greater than the rest of the world, is our retarded step brother.  Brought to you by Acura/Honda
The fact that the gtr was way far behind in race one, and only a millisecond in race two, suggests bias. A Lambo ad
to be fair with the GTR that thing have the aerodynamics off a Brick
that f1 car is trash
Why there is Honda badging on Renault F1 car....does not right
LAMORGHINI IS THE MOST BEST CAR IN THE FUCKING WORLD!!!!!!!
Come on! An F1 is not built to drag race, 2nd same HP but 500 more lbs. Also dude jumped the first 2 races. It should've been understood that with those specs the Lambo was to win.
I mean if you had a 2021 red bull there it would be completely different story
Matt's reaction in that first pull off 😂😂🤣🤣
Use a more recent F1, car and try not to jump start. 10 years ago F1 was good  but not as good as todays cars while the Lamborghini has the newest mods.
Show gtrs topspeed at mile
ทางมันไกล้ไปป่าว GTR ยังไปไม่สุดเลย
The Huracan with twin turbos is a beast!
The crazy thing is a factory stock, Tesla model s plaid, is in the range these cars in terms of quarter mile times.
That lambo is insane, don't think I've seen a F1 car get so easily beaten in a straight 1/4 mile
My goodness. It's like the Lambo had super pursuit mode like Knight Rider. The low end is just as strong as the high end. Very surprised the GT-R was not closer.
Come on Mat time to get a modern F1 car in no more than a few years old.
Ooh the sound of f1 speeding is so good
I really wasn't expecting that at all.
This was fun, but drag racing isn't an F1s specialty. Put them on a track!
I love this and it is very good
Nice race combo!
when an tuned lambo is faster than an f1 car lol
Please, use a real F1 next time.  V10  950 hp  600 KG.
The F1 2019 mdel f1 car:
Was wondering what brand is the walkie-talkie hes using ?
hope try F1 new model,this F1 2011
I would like to see a corner speed comparison. That is where F1 is at!
I wonder how Renault feels about the Honda badging all over that Renault powered F1 car? it's odd that Red Bull update the livery on a car that old. I get it for the test mules they use but odd seeing it on a completely different era of F1 car.
Sem lógica um GTR de 1300 HP perder assim..  🤦‍♂️.. péssima montagem do carro.
Try this Lambo with RS7 from Poland :D
That lambo is faster than supra
Wtf you actually got a Redbull car
Tesla roadster: AMATEURS!
Yanni is gonna like this video 😏
From what I have been told, the F1 car’s mastery isn’t power, it’s agility on a race track combined with power. In other words, in a real life situation with turns, the F1 kills everyone. (I think)
Hmm… F1 should be faster, only 750kg…? The Red Bull is designed for tight corners at high speeds. So, it has ridiculous amounts of DOWNFORCE ⬇️. So at speed, it theoretically weighs more that 750kg??? 4WD & the extra weight probably help to put down the power. And almost dbl the HP!!!
Bugatti bolide vs devil 16
Is he a millionare he is to much with cars
Find it funny how Red Bull go to the trouble of putting the latest livery on a 10 year old car. Guess those sponsors have to get paid
Bet the F1 car could stop even sooner with some heat in those rotors and pads.
Shocking!! That RBR F1 car costs about 10x my road car!
First of all that is a 2008 f1 car on hard compound tyers so it's  not really a fair comparison and it's made for corner
The F1 car needs drs and also a good road
If its a race with turns. F1 would beat all.
Can we just acknowledge that the F1 car is on hard tires and if they had a 2020 car
Omg that Lamborghini is unbelievable. Love the vid guys. From Australia 😘😘😘
Auta
Heheh you always fast start man
Throw some super bikes in the mix to just for good measure
F1 will smoke you in a track and is not a drag car
Mat Watson you should be in the Fast& Furious movie
The sound of a F1 car is always the best
That GTR needs a better tune or driver cause sheesh😬😬😬
Ther's still a 3500hp nissan gtr on drag strips !  🙏   Google it
Thanx fr this race, as i always wondered who wud win against an f1 car   👍
If the f1 car was on soft wheels it could have won
Lamborghini is better than jdm i dont care
I can't believe that the Lambo is very faster then a F1 car!
Pretty cool when you can say your Lambo has F1 Luke acceleration
Lambor AWD :D
Lamborghini all day, everyday!!!
Lamborghini is the king of street but GTR is God, and we need a formula
remember kids, formula 1 is not just about speed, it's speed around corners.
Epic race though wow 🤩 get the hulk thing Godzilla gtr see if that can bore off that lambo wow how fast but all that cash and no back bumper ( messing ) next level power that my mates 1200r ain’t on a level like that massive shout to severn valley motorsport though they are quick so god knows how that huracan must feel
My stock g37 would of took em all to gapplebees
Why oh why did that gtr fail again they are so quick the one I experienced was a svm 1200R he can’t drive him or maybe it’s just to heavy on set off , I’d like to see say Schumacher Ferrari f1 vs that f1 is there somet wrong with it today though or is it like a rally car set up you need to do more info on these that Lamborghini is silly but I don’t have a passion for it lp640 is more Lamborghini next they will do a Porsche and go diesel omg I hope 🤞 not
Massive big OMG I wish I can but 1 million likes for this Lamborghini 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This would get 5 million hits in a week , pikes peak Suzuki vs , zonda r , vs Mac f1
The huracan tbh reminds me of my mums old celica, ( back window ) slides pig ugly , and the doors are same as hers lol , Lamborghini to me is lp670sv orange with someone to have the balls to put two fk off turbos on one of them .
220mph no helmet.  Smart. Sets a good example for the up and comers
This lambo is mental!!am even hurt that my favourite car wow car(porsche 911 turbo S)doesnt stand a chance at all. Let it go against that electric rimac now💀
This is my favourite video
not real. No way the F1 would lose a drag race against a road car, no way. This is staged.
Matt I would genuinely love to race My 1.1L Peugeot 106 against a super car that would get a f ton of view s
The stock Plaid would have been up there with the GTR and F1 for a mere $125k  https://youtu.be/5zkIDLk9Qao
10 minutes for a drag race 🤦🤦🤦 behave yourself carwow FFS
That lambo is an utter flippen beast
Could've included a S Plaid just for shitz and gigglez
I think you should use F1 car with V10 motor, maybe will go in other way
We need Lambo's in F1
What about the air filter right above the wheel? Dirt much?
I remember Road & Track testing a 1974 Ferrari 312B f1 car (ex Lauda) and managing a 1/4 mile time of 9.0 secs flat at 159 mph... faster than the Red Bull here with far less power. That puzzles me.
I feel bad for the Formula One team getting embarrassed and humiliated by a car that costs a fraction of what they paid for their car. Maybe the F1 team should trade it in for a TT Lambo. Lol.
If it aint a mk4 supra or a r34 skyline, all other rice cars are ASS. Hyper/exotic cars and tuning is meant to be in europe period. American cars are AsS also. 👍🏻
You guys know the GTR comes with a launch button, why is he not using it?
Too scripted
Yeah.. I think both RBR and DC had the F1 car put in lean mode and No DRS.. Seeing how the top speed of the 2011 F1 car is 246 MPH it should have no problem out running a 2x heavier car with a top speed of 220 MPH. Not only that it used white tyres that at optimal at 115 C degrees which is bad for a drag race, not only that but it looked like it was raining slightly so slicks were in an even more of a disadvantage due to lack of traction control and other assist tools that both the Lambo and the GT-R have. Cool race tho.
matt shit himself when that lambo took off
I really thought that F1 car would win! 🤭
Renault engine
F1 ist ja nicht für Geschwindigkeit sondern für extreme straßenlage also hohe geschwindigkeit in engen Kurven gebaut, da fickt F1 alles weg
You need to get a post 2017 f1 car in there. That one is a dinosaur now.
Now F1 car Vs Lamborghini at that speed on a corner.
A TT Huracan always takes the W
Now do a lap.
Lambo nd gtr : brrr brrrooomm Rb F1 car : zoom zoom
DRS would rip the Lamborghini
how silly, the F1 car is made for cornering.....
Matt hitting 360km/h is just WOW
DragWow is ridiculous.
that f1 car is a decade old, naturally aspirated, no drs, not built for straight line speed, keeping up with them super cars. nuts
people don't understand that supra and nissan cars are 90 'and 00' and that they are not made to be faster than today's super cars but they are very unique and that's why people love them
Now do it in a Circuit race track. Nice to watch though. Thanks.
Just realized the lambo and gtr are tuned and the f1 isn’t Daym impressive
I miss that F1 noise. It should be a rule for F1 2022, "your car must sound amazing"
i think redbulls F1 car 2021 would win tbh, they have come far during the last seasons.
Jurgen has a turbo Lamborghini that’s faster than all these
https://youtu.be/V4RmD_obUBo  koenigsegg agera rs
Matt is jumping the start every time 😂😂😂
Honestly I'm very impressed with the GTR especially that breaking test.
Lambo is just 👌🏼
So the F1 car is still seriously quick in a straight line considering, plus is can corner like its on rails and brake like it hit a wall. Impressive cars all around though, serious ponies.
The guy in the F1 seemed like he was worried about flipping the car as the street didn't look smooth enough for the F1. I do not think F1's on the track jumped up and down like that.
Race Start in 03:30
Doesent lamborghini have lounch control
Tesla play
Need a proper drag package in the f1 car
I know im late here but just hear me out… tuned turbo s vs tuned lambo
3:30
Only thing I didn't like is that. It's a Far pass years F1 car racing here with the low HP of 750. Now F1 cars are alittle over 1000 HP. An if it was one of the new F1 car it would of win every time.
Thats only 2011 now imagine what a 2020 merc would do 😆
Next with tesla model s plad pleasee... The quarter time is simmilar
that lambo vs rimac nevera
that lambo is insane
Carwow can you kindly do a lambo vs a nissan 350z
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAfotsQcqDE
gtr will never have a chance with twin turbo lambos and r8s. especially the "undergound racing" lambos and  r8s
You can just see how much the tyres warming up helped the RB
less talking ...!!!!!
A drone-view would be awesome for the Breaktest
Before watching this I’m just gonna say, horsepower isn’t the only thing that matters. Weight matters a lot too
Would love to see this race with a Kawasaki Ninja H2R involved
Lamborghini elle est nulle
the only thing is the f1 is meant to take corners at that speed i promise that if the lambo turned at all it and Matt are goners
Try again with the same horse power against an Ams GTR Alpha Omega
Considering the F1 is just powered by 2.4L NA engine with all the downforce and still able to keep up just blow my mind.
Do that Lambo vs Rimac Nevera
Do race between Lamborghini Huracan turbocharged versus The nevera
They could easily put a more powerful engine or tune the one in the F1 to have more power. They got regulations and standards to follow for racing but if the engineers wanted to go crazy they could come up with some 1500 hp AWD super machine that pretty much could fly if you put wings on it. They don't do that because the cars have to last  the duration of the race. That lambo was modified to do one thing and that was go stupid fast in a straight line. That lambo and GTR likely wouldn't survive 3 laps before breaking down in a modified form while they still get crushed by the F1 car which needs to survive 50+ laps and a few hours of full throttle racing. There is a reason why race cars do not have stupid high horsepower numbers.
That GTR is not 1300hp lol. And im most definitely R8/Huracán biased
Matt looked scared. Great video!
HE went top speed in the lambo 220mph
Take to a race track we will how good these street cars are against the F1 😂
A 7speed automatic gearbox? ok, Do you even F1 Bro
Advantage of formula one is in curves. Drag race is non sense
wahh incroyable lambo 😰😱😱😱🚀🚀🚀🚀💪🏼💪🏼❤🇫🇷🇫🇷🇫🇷
That is a good thumbnail
5:51 "ohh no i can hear the f1 car coming" he says as he is pulling away 😂
The reason why the lamborghini huracan  doesnt have the rear bumper
yep , lets see where you are after one lap at spa
The fact that rimac nevera does the 1/4 mile in 8.6s. And the lambo in 8.9 is craazzzyyyy
Those boosted and tuned machines will do ten minutes on a race track and then go back to the pit and cool down. The real challenge is to get rid of all that heat... Insane machines, all three of them.
hey Matt can you race that lambo with rimac nevera
Who is driving the first car as I like a bit off William
Mat was in a coma after this
Not the bumper delete
the gtr deserved to be tuned better
What would it be like if "rimac nevera" participated in this race?
Forza Italia 🇮🇹
Now go around a corner
Hard tyres?! And a turd behind the wheel. Unfair on the RB
Are the F1 tires warmed up? For me the Red bull had cold tires...
Matt sounded like a f1 car at the end of the 3rd drag race
So this video is very intriguing: 3 different power levels BUT with 3 consequently heavier vehicles. Since I know power to weight ratio is the common denominator for all three vehicles, and using "logic" and a little math I come up with the following power to weight ratios. Of course this is using the good old standard Horsepower ('MERICA) and the metric weight in KG. The F1's ratio is 1.15 HP per KG, the Lambo .773, and the GTR comes out to .707 HP per KG.    This means the F1 is putting 67% more HP per KG than the Lambo, and 61% more HP per KG than the GTR. On paper the F1 looks to be the winner before I even watch the video. But, this doesn't factor in traction with the F1 only being rear wheel drive and both the GTR and Lambo are AWD.  Should be fun, lets see what happens.......
The soundtrack on that F1 car though...
Who wants F1 vs Tesla Roadster?
That lambo was so insane, imagine beat an f1 Car 🤯🤯🤯
When your street car is faster than a F1 car...
A Mercedes F1 car with Hamilton driving it would beat them
Now try a track lap see how the lambo does XD
where is lambo's pants....
How can you even expect to be beaten by David Coulthard?
It's really scary when you think about modern super cars allowing untrained drivers so accelerate faster than F1 cars of the not so distant past.
We really need a drag race between that lambo and the model s plaid
Omg.....2:25 buzzysingh is an Indian.(;
https://youtube.com/shorts/GvpZT4gT43s?feature=share
Well unbelievable 🤣 either the F1 is shit or the driver is scared to push it further. 😁🤔
"frikkin hell"🤣😅😅
Why does the F1 car have hard tyres not softs
who wanna see the tt lambo vs the rimac nevera, leave a like :D
Hoonicorn : are you kidding me
Only un this channel lambos win against gtrs, or maybe the other drivers let the lambo win
How much Lamborghini pay you for this video?
F1 lose cause it's for corners, not drag.
They should use Lambos to do the F1 race.
I just knew from the thumbnail that the GTR had no chance
Change that plates on TT Lambo to LOL F1
Its raining and wet track, no drs and softs are disabled.
The GT-R seems slower with 1300hp
come on.. get real.. that F1 is not your  opponent when racing a supercar..  that F1 engine and chassis has already  been regulated by FIA and you cannot just race them in that place..  Go to proper F1  Circuit and race them there.. Cos the magic is in the F1 circuit  + F1 Car...
Imagine recording 9.3s in a 1/4 mile drag race and still being in last place.
'MoMeNtUm' LMFAO
If you want to see the quickest TT Lambos go look at underground racing on IG they’re the fastest
GTRs need have about 400-500 more BHP to be able to keep up with the TT hurracans.
Anyone notice how the titles says “GT-R Nismo,” but in the video it is just a normal GT-R?
Is the driver of the f1 car  max verstappen
Red Bull RB7                            Lamborghini Huracan                                     Nissan GTR 2.4 L NA V8                             5.2 NA V10                                                       4.1 L Stroker Engine 750 Hp                                      1200 Hp                                                            1300 Hp $62.5 M                                     1240 Nm                                                           1290 Nm 650 Kg                                       1553 Kg                                                            1840 Kg 7 Speed Auto Gearbox        7 Speed Dual Clutch Auto Gearbox    6 Speed Auto Gearbox Paddle Shifters                    $150.000                                                             $140.000
the person driving the gtr is a waste
The horsepower on an F1 is around 1000 HP
Why didn’t the F1 car have DRS wide open?
not clear start
That cannot be real f1 car i really cant understand how they use so much money and still lose to lambo
Why you use Motorola phone (my English is bad and I mean your phone when you talking in the car). I have the same :) It is very good, but between it is for kids.
Matts face when he first launched the lambo, genuine fear haha
Yeessss Black Country power for the win 😂
Maybe this GT-R is in safe mode?😂
The crazy thing is that at the end of this strip at nearly 200 mph that F1 car could be thrown into a 60deg turn and barely have to lift off the throttle. The others would be luckily to not roll trying that.
U should try Ralph Schumacher's bmw F1 car
ටෞකන්න දාල
Yanni know your friends
You all should do stretched bikes next. Those get into the 8/7s
You should organize a drag between that Lamborghini and the rimac nevera, tesla s plaid and if possible the NIO p9
Well...if you go around corners, the F1 car would smoke the Lambo.
That Lamborghini tho OMFG
Wow
This is the best race I ever seen 👍
Next time  get some alpha tuned GTR and not this basement ones which got tons of HP on paper but  they are slow as snail on track because of bad gearshift  optimisation
I expected more from a 1300 hp GTR
cold tires on the F1 car + a traction disadvantage
that lambo needs to take on the hoonicorn or pastranas WRX.  @hoonigan this is ideal fodder for this vs that
F1 car not setup race😁
Modern day f1 cars have 1300+ hp
In a circiut lsmbo would lose
4.50 Fall start huracan
Race starts at 3:30
pls do Mazdaspeed 3 and other hot hatches in a drag race
4:52 that one mosquito at 3:am
NGL for all intents and purposes the GTR brakes harder untill it has to come to a standstill.
Hi Mat please update the leaderboard
Someone call Tesla for the drag 😂y'all will feel embarrassed af XD
I am blown away that the F1 didn't destroy the competition. Obviously it's designed to be able to handle but still. Crazy.
3:28 everyone 😐
Mat, I believe that Lambo won by jump-starting every time !
geez this lambo is a monster
wrf thar lambo
#Padu!!!💪🏻💥💥💨💨💨
superchargers are better than turbos
Good video 👍👍👍🔔🔔🔔🔔
What's important is all three are faster than the 3 million rupee buggati Chiron
Your face tho-
Wow… a lot of people bragging, for a straight line race… 😂… Add one corner and that’s it!!!!
We have to mansion that GTR engine will still runs after 5 new engine's in Lambo and 40 in F1 🤣
F1 car has hp/weight ratio 1,2. how can lambo beat F1 in acceleration...Puah.F1 car complete 1/4 mile nerar about 8 sec.  I think David use  half of the throttle.
The f1 car is on hard tires
Nissan gtr 300kilos mas por100 cv mas.
I cant wait to get my telsa roadster with rocket thruster ! you will need to update this video after that !
That Lambo dude…OH MY GOD!!! 🤤
Now add a 917/30…. 🤓
Omg that lambo looks insanely fast :OOO
That Lambo is nuts !
We need a Mclaren F1 V.S. Ferrari Enzo
The Lambo was ahead when you called the rolling race. The GTR should have beaten you right there
race at 3:31
Every other race channel tuned gtrs win.
THATS an old ass F1 car.. either that or its an indy car. f1 cars have the shield on top of them, and have wider bodies and a wider rear wing.
What about that 1200hp Lambo and Ken Block's '65 Ford from The Hoonigans' ThisVsThat?
Mate I can smash my Mrs that fast.
Then a Civic and a Tesla turn up.
Lambo oh my good
Didn't the 2011 redbull have a renault engine??
Love that “oh it’s a close one” guys 15 cars ahead 😂🤣😂
This lambo vs rimac nevera race is needed
Never mess with a lambo without a rear bumber or a civic with a laptop in the passenger seat thats just common sense
mmm,how will it do round a BEND in comparison to the F1 car.
There u go trash woow so race car
Always funny that people think drag racing a F1 and beating them is a HUGE feat. First off he was within a second of you now take a a turn at 160mph see how it goes... i mean if u want to be fair. Just come back when you are within a half of a drag strip of a top fuel dragster otherwise its comparing the best football player to the best soccer player on hitting eachother on a full sprint.... filthy casual u would be absolutely owened
That Lambo can be over a second quicker but I'm still picking an F1 car then a GTR then a Lambo
Hahaha sorry but a real 1300hp gtr is faster than the lambo something must be wrong with the gtr or the lambo must have 1600hp+...
Jumped start every time
Hurts to see no drs activation
Respect for GTR 👍🏻
YO THE LAMBORGH HURACAN IT'S THE BEST CAR.
Ik the gtr can win it’s just that the driver sucks no kizzy
Go for Nevera vs this Lambo 🎃
Mat the Lambo 1200hp Yianni  Bugatti Chiron You in a Laferrari
gt-r sandbagged it off the line
This test is pretty stupid TBH. F1 cars aren't designed for straight line speed, they're designed for cornering. Take these three cars on any track and the F1 car will lap them both several times over.
Showing that once you mod any supercar it's fucking fast, gtr's are just cheaper to build and therefore more common. Shitboxes
It’s All garbage vehicles
Cool race.
7:42 😅😂😂😂
why f1 car doing drag race ? :D Like wtf. So now f1 on circuit vs lambo and gtr ? :D its dumb : D
Carwow please do a drag race with the MP4/4
Rimac nevera?
The F1 V 12 Shummy drove had 900 HP.
3:30 to skip the bullshit
F1 cars are not drag race cars. Only add one corner to the track and F1 ends first.
That GTR is underperforming but that Lambo is definitely fast.
Add 1 corner and David will be far ahead  🤣
Put that lambo against the rimac nevera that would be mental!!!
Get this years Red Bull and put a set of soft compound tires on it and it might actually have a good chance
"I have just fucked of.....fucking hell"       Hello Clarkson?
A new f1 car and you will lose😂
I really don't get drag racing. It takes little to no skill since you don't corner and don't battle for position. It's just like going to the gym to lift weights. Power that has little to no utility in real life.
GTR 🤔1300 POWER  🖓
1. Why did Redbull change the original livery ? 2. My expectations for the Redbull were low but Holly fck😂
The dangerous chemistry perplexingly surround because shock suggestively own astride a sick bat. abject, inquisitive pedestrian
Put some softs under the fq in good weather
This is so crazy
If hE turned that corsa mode on jeez WELCOME TO HEAVEN MATE🙂
Now do 1 lap and u will be demolished by F1 car by 30 seconds
In a circuit however, you will not achieve that speed and power. f1 would win it.  XD         Also me: It's a drag race you IDIOT. What did you expect?
what differentiates a f1 car from a normal car is not the speed in a straight line but the speed they are able to carry around a corner
jeeeezzzzz cant beleive it, lambo is faster than an f1 carrrrrrrr!!!!!!!!
How is this huracan faster than the 1200hp Audi R8?
The nizmo doesnt even exist
8.9 sec wow!!!!
All my fav cars are here !
The Lambo against the Rimac would be a good race to see!
GTR wins if we do a bit maths...
Now its time for this lambo and nevera
AWD w/ modded Launch Control against 2WD F1 Car in damp/wet condition and cold tires... this was a foregone conclusion.
Its because the garbage F1 is very 1.5 turbo back in the days it was a V12 TRY THAT.
UGR Lambo?
He jumped the first 2.
Im pretty sure that Lamborghini is exaclty the transport used to take pple to heaven. 😂🤣🤣🙆‍♂️
Matt on his way to heaven : "ohh my god this is hell"... 🤣🤣.. That lambo is no joke.
I think the F1 Car could definitely win on an better underground or with DRS because they not used it
We need to see race Nevera vs that Huracan 😵😵😵😵
You should get Guy Martin and his 800 bhp bike and have a race
did anyone else guess correctly?  i feel so inappropriately good about myself.  except, i thought the f1 car was going to have an initial lead (with the diminished weight and low speed lack of downforce).
Can you believe the lambo beat the F1 and the buggati didn't Lamborghini is the best car when I buy my svj damn 1600hp
60k in the lamb i wonder why he won psshh
купил ниссан еб..ся сам)))
Subscribe For Awesome Car Sounds Like This!!!   https://youtube.com/channel/UCnRJYv25Jx3aFCG5oYFnNEw
We all know the F1 is just teasing the other cars that's not how fast they are this test is a joke
Why is everyone trying to defend the F1 car? It lost, get over it.
now i’m a little embarrassed cause i saw drag race and i thought RUPAUL’S drag race
Compete this and that silver BMW m5 1000hp
why tf does the f1 car not have its original 2011 livery, that is the current 2021 one
How perfect that lamborgini is tuned 🥶
It's helps when u have AWD and no rear bumber
that lambo looks hideous from the back lol but it makes up for it because it is NUTS lol
Only in this channel GTR always loses
even if you don't drive any f1 car Imagine you passed David Coulthard this is insane
Holy smokes
Insane hey.  Wow. The green machine kills em
The gtr need a driver
I thought this was GTA 5😅😅😅😅😅
https://youtu.be/uke4CYUgJkg
That nissan drove as if be equipped with an broken non-turbo OEM engine
If the F1 car had a V10, I reckon it'll be neck and neck.
У Ламборджини фальстарт) А вообще не ожидал, что она окажется быстрее, прогнозировал ей 3-е место ...
Matt, please stop swearing, my kids love watching you but don't like the bad language.
You need to get the red Vauxhall Victor on here against anything that is stupid enough to try and beat it. Also you'd have a new 1/4mile record.
thats why u dont put 2 turbos on a lambo😐
W O W   ! ! !    That was a drag race, with an unbelievable outcome.!
Pointless, the RedBull F1 was a purpose built car to go around a circuit for 44 laps or so. It's built to handle tight corners and nail those apex turns to perfection. A horse will always beat a camel on flat surfaces. Come desert, and the story completely changes.
And this is why no one wants to watch F1 anymore.
Young people, take off until the morning, Nissan will pass through you. Are you kidding me?
holy f that lambo is fast
If you dislike this video ur hotboi
The next race can be between 1200hp Lamborghini Huracan, Rimac Nivera and a motorbike; Kawasaki H2R which has top speed record and  0-400 km/h 26 seconds!. What do you think @matwatsoncars ? Thanks.
This LAMBO is the Hulk of the cars !!!
Jesus Christ that Lamborghini is not normal wow car wow
I can’t handle 225 HP so imagine 1225!
That's why you never race a lambo with deleted bumper, you'll just say hi to their rearview mirror all the time!, Now what i want to see is this lambo go toe to toe with a tune 765 lt mclaren😂😂😂, pls make it happened carwow🙏🙏🙏🙏
Gtr are to heavy
Do it with Hamilton or Vettel or Alonso and you will see the speed of a Formula 1 car  Or repeat the experience on a track
The f1 is detuned
Now have them compete on a proper circuit.
dogshit country literally always raining
The 1300hp Nissan GTR did 1/4 mile in 9.3 sec which is the same time of the 800whp 992 Turbo S
70mm in cars no microphones
Lamborghini kept jumping the start
Was cool. Love lambos and F1. They should do a drag race with proper timing so jump starts don’t matter and can be sure which is quickest.
Stop jumping the start tho lol
8.9 isn’t that a new record?
O piloto do gtr é ruim d+ slk!!!
i was really expecting the F1 with its power to weight ratio and reduced drag to smash that race, really suprised me
Lambo VS Ninja H2R ?
now try this same cars on a track, like monza, nurburgring, etc. what will the results????? :D
What’s the price for the gtr?
The Lambo jumped every start
Please put the Rimac in the mix…
F1 are not designed for drag races. F1 use a very hard mastering clutch not designed for starts F1 are only 2 wheels drive F1 aerodynamic isn't designed for top speed but for corners handling. F1 need soft and hot tyres for a good start. And the rain and track a clearly a major plus for 4 wheels drive.  Completely stupid comparison.
THIS IS FAKE CAUSE NO CAR IS FASTER THAN FORMULA ONE CAR HAHAH
Haha lambo go brrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Should of been 2019 ferrari
You know that lambo is quick when it got no bumper
oh well all this time I thought F1 cars were beasts at acceleration. I would like to see 1000cc bikes brought in to races.
Only on carwow you see madnesssss like this! 😍
8:05 now try to corner with these cars
Race starts at 3:30
I love DC.
GTR driver is driving like a scared driver
Definitely sharing this 😍
That Lambo stole my heart 🔥🔥
IT DEPENDS ON THE DRIVER IF IT WAS SCHUMACHER HE WOULD WIN FOR SURE 😂
I need to see this lambo vs the new rimac!!!
Até minha avó sabe arrancar melhor com um f1 do q esse cara kkk
That's why F1 races are just boring..
🤔 Erm? Wasn't the RB7 Championship Winning car powered by Renault?
Really surprised the F1 car didn’t just pull away at the start, being half the weight
Short track. try long trajectory for sure win F1
Stop fucking about and get the Plaid S.
Get the Rimac Vs Tuned Huracan
Insanity
As usual Mat wins thanks to jumping the start, AGAIN! Stop jumping the start on every video and go on go Mat!
i figured the F1 car wouldve been the fastest. guess not.
F1 driver is either dogshit or holding back in the start 🤣
Cool but f1 will be faster on the track
Italian car
Do that same lambo against the new tesla s plaid
There is in Holland a Nissan gtr whit 2400 horsepower
So now, I am buying Lamborghini
Yannnnnnnni????
The F1 wasn't tuned for quarter drag.  The gearbox needs to be completely redone.
the lambo is on semi slicks and the gtr is on michelin ps4s street tires.
0->300->0  Would be interesting. Or 2x 1/4 Mile in 1 go down and back to start.
The best thing is old mate crapping his pants
Make this Lambo vs Rimac!
Gtr is better than lambo 🤦🏻‍♂️
that F1 sound really sick
Thats bonkers!
This man acts like 220 mph is nothing 😂
I was expecting f1 then lambo then gtr close quite surprised by the results
Seems like Red Bull has excuses everywhere they go.
Tesla plaid runs a 9.1 in the quarter mile right off the showroom floor.
Should’ve been on the soft
Tt huracan is the king of the street
That lambo vs the rimac nevera
F1 aracına Max werstapen otur bakalım neler olacak 😁😁
Add 1 corner somewhere and it's game over for the other two cars
The Lamborghini is incredibly fast, I mean, it can smoke 1000 of those OMG ITS A 1000 HP supras
All the gtr fan girls: if he had slicks on...
dude, you jumped every time
Their power to weight ratio is obvious, unless any one is using a locomotive engine, the winner is ALWAYS the lightWEIGHT !
Didnt actually see shit from the drag race other than cameras changing every 0.6 seconds and filming interior ffs
Seeing the GTR lose making me cry rn omg
Power to prices ratio, gtr would spanked them all.
Great, now lets compare the prices.
The F1 car sounds like a bee
Gtr 🖤❌
Are you really sure the GTR has 1300hp lol it looks like a stock  Good race between F1 and Lambo
Why use f1 at 2.4 v8 n not older v10
He is so annoying
Lmfao, this is so fake as the f1 should have taken both of those cars without a problem as that’s not the same type of car
0-60 times ?!!
Sickest drag race ever
How about challenging the F1 in the track?
Every car is a gangsta until David Coulthard revs up his RB7.
Rain, poor concrete strip. The F1 car had no chance because it didn't have the grip
Hi Matt I am planning on sticking a Rolls Royce Merlin V12 spitfire Engine in the Back of a Austin Metro and I plan to stick a Jet Engine in the Back of a Transit van and the Metro will called Bluebird 4 and the Transit Van is going to be called Thunderbird 1 and the Transit van will be capable of going faster than the fastest fighter jet and the Bloodhound and the Metro Will also be capable of going Faster than the Bloodhound land speed car and the Fastest fighter jet and the Metro is going to Be Street legal and the Transit Van may be a Little difficult due to the Large Jet Engine in the Back also you'll be able to hear the Jet Transit Van from quite some Distance and as soon as they are built I will Put in my  Will that if anything was to happen to me  then both vehicles will be Put in a Car museum  and there will be a red button that I will push and then after the vehicle has reached its top speed the vehicle will go into shut down mode which Completely cut off the Fuel to the Jet engine this is so  that the vehicle is much safer to be around but the this Is also dangerous because the cut off Button may not Completely cut off the fuel supply as a result of this the vehicle will essentially be a Bomb on Wheels and if the Vehicle fails to stop then I will eject myself out of the Vehicle and once I have done that the vehicle will Self destruct
I wish there was a bike in there just to satisfy the bikers even if it looses lol
This was actually insane! There is just one higher level! If you could test a huracan from undergroundracing vs the rimac nevera. (I think a record might be born) :)))
Was this the Monaco spec RB??   Looks like it had too much Wing.
Carwow needs to get in touch with boba motoring. Get some of their cars on the channel. They’re insane!
GTR esta mal tuneado ..ese motor da mucho mas
Can we just appreciate, especially the German people here, the way Mat pronounces "Jürgen"😂
lets do a whole lap on the circuit, i guess the F1 would smoke them easily.
You have just tapped the formula 1 world.. bring in more from them.. it will be even more wow..
Unrealistic you racing against a 2011 f1 model, is it worth it?
Why f1 car dont open drs
Time to chuck in some twisties, Matt...
220 mph the lambo didn't even sweat
In monza
GTR is soooo slow only slightly slower than an F1 car :/ lol this video fails to show that all of these cars are blindingly fast ahahahaha
Buggati bollide vs f1
GTR  is OG ❤️
Hhhhhh absolutly amazing
Never race a lambo with no rear bumper. Even if you in a f1 car
in albania there is a nissan gtr with almost 2000hp
Why they use an f1 car from 2011. The f1 cars of today are much faster and got more power.
driving the F1 is not an F1 licensed driver..
Gee, you mean a rwd car that weighs 750 kg didnt perform well in a drag race while it was fucking raining? Weird... 🤦🏻‍♂️
Apa ni F1 cap ayam
The Lamboghini will loose its car
Amazing how the F1 car would keep up despite all the drag produced from it's down force kit
Alter Verwalter
I think what everyone wants to see is Matt and Yanni on bicycles on a quarter mile
Sounds like a Drill.
I want to see F1 Car with no restricted fia rules on engine fuel flow, fastest and latest engine with 2022 bigger tires, race that with L.hurra please.......
again fake noobs
Lambo the best sulercar in the world
I would have picked the F-1 with the rolling race.. boy! was I wrong!
f1 guy ''team are happy  i'm happy ''
Lamborghini wen
Bruh I tought it was gta
So not weight but power RULES
Ditch those walkie-talkie and get an ear piece, too dangerous driving with no hands on.,
Fake fake fake f1 is Best
I was just about to get off the loo and get in the shower, when he yelled, “I’VE JUST FUCKED OFF!” More 💩 popped out, as I tried to hold in my laugh! TMI? Yes… But damn… They’re that funny. Oh yeah… Where’s Yianni? You should challenge him to bring something that he thinks might beat that Lambo! I didn’t scroll the comments, but I’m sure I couldn’t be the only person thinking that!
Why isn't David using drs 🤷
I don believe....the F1 car lost to the Lambor.......
DC is so classy, and such team player
Plaid Model S vs this Lambo please!!!
Now try taking a corner at that speed.
You know Lamborghini  is always Lamborghini
Instead of using an F1 car, just strip down a civic and throw a turbo on it 🤣
That cant be the same engine as in a real F1 car, not the highest horsepower ones no way, top end ones have what, 1000hp and weigh so little?
Twists and Turns on the Path to Obtaining the Fa Soon after, He Ying’s family’s application for immigration to Canada was approved. The family was busy applying for passports and moving. He Ying postponed her plan to learn Falun Dafa.   After her family moved to Canada, He Ying began having health problems. First, she had difficulty breathing. Then she felt tired after walking only a few steps and she could hear the sound of chains when she walked as if her legs were tied with iron chains. She became breathless and needed to hold onto something to avoid falling if she walked a short distance.  She also began experiencing insomnia. She had cold feet and frequently had to go to the washroom at night. Her insomnia affected He Ying’s life significantly. She tried sleeping pills, but they did not work. She also could not drive because she fell asleep behind the wheel.   He Ying did not tell her parents about her health issues because the entire family had various health problems at that time. Her sister’s health was awful and she did not want to add to her parents’ troubles.
URG tuned Lamborghini would be better that v10 is a beast
idk what, but the f1 car is terrifying.  i thought the f1 is going to fly. but no.haha
Imagine the plaid is 9.2's and 9.0's without being gutted and not fully charged. Also where's a Tesla Plaid video.
62 million pounds??? For a car that can wreck anytime??
the GTR was obviously running on a low engine mapping  to save the gearbox (35k €)  he didnt want to shred it for 1 carwow video )
Green car have the best driver .
Imagine if they used a V10 F1 Car with launch control 👀
UGR LAMBO.  260MPH In the HALF MILE!!!
Get a UGR Lambo. Won't be close everrrrrr
Gtr woulda whooped the lambo for
Lambo jumped
Nissan is like "I'm just here because people think I'm fast but I'm not"
That first rolling race man missed 3rd, imagine he used the whole gear
think nissan doesn't really fit in this
I think I like the 100 mile brake test over the 70 mile one
P0RC43
The only thing I came for was that beautiful F1
The gtr driver was absolute garbage late reaction on every start and haf brake lights on instead of launch control on. In the rolling race Matt says go and Matt pulls out like 4 cars before he starts going!!!
Oh my God that car is "Fing "Amazing
Throw a 2jz Supra in there
Not bad for a supremely underpowered Honda. Even up the hp output and that lambo would be lambshit.
Matt saying he can't see the F1 car me seeing the F1 car through the window be like 😐 YOU CANNOT SEE THE CAR THROUGH THE FRIKKIN WINDOW MATT WATSON!?
well, imagine a F1 car with 1200hp...
are both the gtr and lambo by jm imports?
Do it with a newer redbull 😉
who likes a lamborghini with no rear bumper? Personally I don't like it
Lamborghini is machine ☺️
It's all about traction, power to weight ratio, and aerodynamics. I can't believe what I just watched happen. That Red bull was using 87 Octane pump gas, and the Lambo was on 115 octane racing fuel
lambo vs rimac navara
Thanks
How about on circuit
Please mat🥺
Do a race with dobre brothers
This vs Rimac please
Lambo jumped the start on the first 2  races...only the last race was a fair start
The part when you ahh! Really funny😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Never mess with the no bumper lambo
Hello, amazing cars but for me at 6.2 its still a killing sensation to go inside so I quit.
bro why wast that f1 car on hards let it be on supersofts
Wow, that Lambo is crazy!! Did not expect that result at all!!
Lamborghini 🥰
Never thought i would see a street car beat a f1 car in anything. But here we are, very impressed with that lambo.
F1 racing is pathetically slow due to its limitations. A lot of street cars would perform better on f1 tracks than f1 cars
Lambo very, very insane!! 👏👏
Now do one with a turn at the end of a quarter mile into another quarter mile. lol watch that F1 car whip around the corner at 60 mph
I can't be the only one who wants to see the Lamborghini vs the Rimac Nevera......
Proud to say that Lamborghini has been my favourites since the early 90’s 🙌🏻
Didn't think formula cars would be this good at drag racing
Matt....bricking it
Lamborghini va Rimac 😱🦾
I call bullshit
without rain, the F1 could win it
Race the lambo against the Tesla Plaid!
You need a real F1 driver in a real F1 car and go round corners
Why did the rb7 sound like that... it sounded off, almost like a r/c car or something and seemed under powered
Adding HP/KG would be great thanks:)
every time mat yells come on it gain 50 more horsepower😂
Put soft tyres, open the DRS and change the F1 setup to a setup with less downforce than the actual one and we'll see if the lambo is still first haha
We want the F1 car vs Rimac nivera vs that lambo
Isnt it possible Mat to made races where you drive all the cars? You launch most time best from drivers it could made truly quicest car
Huge numbers but still no one-to-1 @koenigsegg
Please add a Tesla Plaid to this race. It runs the quarter mile under 9 seconds as well!
The cars seem even, however hard to tell when he keeps jumping the start.
🔥F1 🔥
Pretty crazy to think that F1 car dispatched the Bugatti Chiron with effortless ease. That Lambo is quick!
Am I hearing the F1 car or did a mosquito land in my ear?
Be interesting to see how well the lambo takes off on road tyres like the gtr has instead of the semi slick race tyre currently on the lambo
Rimac vs that huracan vs f1 car
I was sure that the f1 would win
You can have 284 Twin Turbo Lambos or 1 F1 car.
Lol the F1 car sounds like a rc car 😂
I heard a mosquito during the video
Of course this Monster Lamborghini is faster than a formula 1 car in drag race BUT on track the formula 1 car it is the fastest of all
Grandpa F1 still giving a good game.
Jesus Christ I did not expect a GTR to do the quarter mile in 9.3 secs wtfff
Wow the spune of lambo is 🤯🤯
That lambo vs rimac!!!! PLEASE
There's just no way F1 win with that much of a downforce. In the track yes it would easily beats all of the competitor. But in drag racing, hell naw. Slow af in the first gear, and too much downforce.  Next time try racing against one in the track, i doubt the lambo nor the GTR wins
Fun how it says Honda on the red bull when it is running Renault engine
More videoes with The lambo
That Lambo vs Ken Blocks Hoonigan
On a track we all know the F1 would kick ya ass 😂😂
I bet a 2021 F1 car would stand more of a chance in the drag race.
Bruh that’s what Nissan gets for releasing a new gtr with parts from their scrap part bin. Ohhh look the engine from a v35 shitbox let’s put some new rods and pistons in it strap 2 turbos on and that’ll do. Disgracful. And then toyota followed suit with their new bmw I mean supra.
Too much wing on the rb7
On the straight, no chance. David need bends to gain any advantage with those racing regulation limitations.
That lambo vs rimac
Such a brilliant race how about a V6 turbo redbull f1 car then see the lambo try and dissappear
That lambo vs the buggati
F1 have not been created for straight lines. Let this Lambo take a turn and let's laugh 😀
that Lambo is insane!!!
Godzilla is Impressive with a V6 engine. They have really maxed out all power obtainable for the poor V6 ad its a jaw breaker to even show in this race.
Crazy 1000+HP gang
I would like more to take a TT R8
2021 F1 Car needs 4.5 sec 0-200kph if its ready for race
Follow the 10 commandments Christians and ask for forgiveness so you go to heaven
Drag of downforce. That's why no one would see where the f1 went. of course.
That Lambo wasn’t fucking around
That F1 🏎  sounds like a Nirto RC car
60 million car roasted by 0.6 million car. Lol
Thank you 🤣🤣🤣😅
1200hp huracan twin turbo vs 1000hp bmw M5 (tuned by evolved)
Matt was genuinely scared 😆
How is possible that car with less power/weight ratio won racing car? Don't tell me it's all about grip, i dont believe you
Mat jumped the start twice in the beginning
GTR looks like an SUV in this company.
4:45
Marty jumps every race in every video lol
Imagine F1 with DRS and Warm Tires
This is the best fucking race I've watched in my entire lifetime. Holy smokes, that Huracan sounds sweet.
Lol people really think a lambo can beat a F1 car? 😂  scripted...
Is the Lambo stok?
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE BUGATTI AND KOENIGSEGG AND THIS LAMBO!!!!!
He jumped both times if it was when the arms go down…
Dont even care which wins that F1 sound just ahhh...
Tuned lambos are deadly sometimes
Any chance for lmp cars and formulaE cars?
F1 is not meant to do drag racing and you guys know it, had this been an F1 track those two would not be able to handle turns as effectively.
Sounds like a nitro RC car lol
Best Video
These gen F1 cars ain't that quick then.Cue F1 fan boys outrage. Ha ha its right there to see.
Put up that lambo vs kawasaki ninja H2R!
With a proper tune that GTA would have destroyed
I bet David would have been closer if he was on softs
Isnt the jdm import guys the same guys Who did the silvia for the csgo guys friend spark or something
you should add mk4 supra to pleased your 12yo viewrs
Huracan too fast
F1 is build differently. Its on another level in high speed cornering and breaking. Its not meant for drag racing.
F1s aren’t exactly meant for straight line races
This shity Formular 1 Car cost 62million Dollars and can not win against a tuned Lambo? Okey I am ashamed right now! Just garbage. Lambo I love you.
This is the best Drag Race I've ever seen
the amount of down force you can see in the gtr
Deep down most of us are GTR gang. But goddamn that TT v10 sounds immaculate
It's clear the f1 car didnt had the grip enough spin the tires
I can't comprehend how quick these cars are unless they run next to a base model BMW or something
I love how the only car u can hear through all the races is just the f1
I lost all respect for formula 1 Smmfh. They just sound good
So the gtr should be better or the same as the lambo when unlocked?
Am I crazy or that guy engine swapped an GTR? Lol
Having that hurrican is like having aimbot in warzone
We need an autonomous car F1 type race with totally unlimited cars.
F1 is on hards, damp track, and seems to be running max downforce configuration, ofc it wont beat 1200hp lambo, there is no tracktion on those cold hard tires
https://youtu.be/pcHumlKI5EE watch this GTR 3.8, 2000hp, What 4.1 can do? Stop watching this, they are lying about the GTR!
Well we have no idea what the setup that F1 car had. If you set the car up specifically for a drag race and put on softer tyres and used its DRS it would smoke the lambo even if F1 cars are not built for drag races. During the starts you can see how much the F1 car struggles with grip on those hard tyres, maybe they were cold too.
Wow a shot Mercedes in my country coasts like the lambo
Is everyone gonna hate me if I say I don't like the sound of the F1? To me it sounds like an RC boat.
Lamborghini for life
Ur Look like danny d kekw
Why do people keep drag racing cars that are made to go around corners? I know it’s about views but I never make it through a whole video once I see the format.
They should have put a Tesla Plaid here in comparison so people have an idea how fast that Lambo really is!
The challenge should have included a full stop at the end.. just to see the differences in vehicles.
the f1 isnt mate for drag mate !
ZERO chance that Lambo has 1200 HP only.   Anyone that knows anything can tell you that
That Tune on the GTR sucks
The RB7 was on worn practice hard tyres so that’s not fair
Things that scare me: spiders, clowns, lambo without rear bumper, civic with a laptop
Please please, get a top Moto gp bike and a few cars 🏍🏍🏍🥳🤞🇬🇧
No importa que tan rápido hagas el cuarto de milla, el único campeón ahí es el F1
The drag that formula is pushing is insane
What an out come! Amazing...
Why does he jump the start every time?.
little depressed by thinking my car have only 50hp xD
F1 car DRS close hhhh
That F1 is so sick
You do drag race in RAIN with all-wheel drive cars vs F1. Thats pathetic!
Now get a Honda with a laptop in it 😀
Esse piloto do gt-R tá de sacanagem
7:15, That freakin lambo went from 2nd to 4 gear.... Dammm
The pumped deborah microcephaly squeak because coach accordingly enter astride a dreary supply. useless, minor comparison
U did not tell the price of nissan
Its wet outside and that F1 has flat tires so no grip, maybe different if it was dry
TT huracan vs Rimac! Close times and it'd be fun to see who could get the better grip
that lambo smokes everything , same engine used on R8 , with 2 turbos.. that engine has big pottential
Now take them to the track and do some corners as well ;)  F1 cars didn't get traction in the first run, yep, but still sick how that Lambo is walking 🤯  Also the brakes on both the Lambo and GTR are insane if you remember their weight... I think if they warmed up the brakes the F1 car would have really smashed them both.
But the f1 car has DRS but not on?!
Why do people think huracans with bumper deletes are beatable
Please I think you guys should add porche 911 turbo s to this race Thank you
That Lambo is ridiculously facts for no reason lol WOW. I definitely had my money on the F1 car.
Formula 1 aracı eski nesil artı sert lastik kullanıyor 2013 model ve öncesi bu dezavantaj demek
That Lamborghini is crazy would wanna see it go against the Tesla plaid
The Lambo driver just has a better ping
Horses for courses apparent here, put some corners in and see what happens with that line up, or add a top fuel dragster if you must insist on straight lining
That moment when a Nissan drive past your F1 car. Gotta love JDM
F1 cars are build to go quicker at corners, is that correct?
That lambo is insane🔥
LOOL at 3:59 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pfff 2011 F1 season got sone of the slowest F1s... this does not do justice to F1!
ok.. now turn and see how it goes for the Lambo and GTR
Leave it to a brit to make 1200hp look slow and a gtr look slower than an f1 car.
Here you go: TT LAMBO VS RIMAC NEVERA
man that's a fast volkswagen
David “If the team are happy I’m happy” Coulthard
This is the craziest drag I’ve ever watched
I think the gtr sounded better
Nah bro, the f1 can slided so much i don't even know
That F1 car sounds like a mosquito buzzing around my ear.
would have been interested to see a plaid s
Don’t just compare the speed, what about the price?😂
You should race the Lambo against the fully tuned Porsche at es motor
you all drag is a fake scenario
ok gtr but i wana see supra bby
Holy shit. The pull on that Lambo is positively bollock shrivelling.
GTR driver sucks!!! 👎🏻
Damn lambo .. the F1 straggling 😂 is there another car 👀
Why isnt the F1 car on at least medium's? since there isnt really any warm up lap at all..... I mean he even says he's getting wheelspin and having to start in 2nd gear.... goddamn carwow, put that f1 car on some fuckin softs next time.
I think if they put the new f1 cars can be kinda different
1000hp and up is just insane for any kind of car.
I was secretly hoping the lambo would win but I would have had my money in the F1 car; great race and video! 🤘
Thanks for not having Yanni in the GTR.
If you have more track that GTR would eat both Alive
That boosted Huracan yeets off like an electric car! Wow!
4.3m people didn't pay attention in physics class.
cheat
Take the rear wing off the RB7 and do it again! Please? haha
This crazy  Lamborghini vs Rimac Nevera can be intresting ⚡
Let's be honest... the f1 is the only car that can turn at these God forsaken speeds Feel bad yianni wasn't here
yes, I am convinced  Will take the F1 car.
Need the LLF GTR
They think that Lamborghini is still making Tractors
That Lamborghini is Insane it's powered for Angel of  death so it can be anywhere at anytime to take those soul before they blink 😆🤣
Jeez $62M is insane
This was super cool. I always wonder though why channels that manage to get their hands on millions of dollars worth of cars can't get proper starting/timing device (Christmas tree) to eliminate the question of a false start.
In the third race:"woooo it's so close with everyone." Ehh no, that was actually the only time you didn't jump the start. 😏
I am sure Yanni is smiling with a Lamborghini win!!!
Bet that Lamborghini is a dog in the comers
If team is happy I’m happy 😆
lol matt bought a 2010 f1 car if he raced the latest f1 car he would loose and f1 cars can go upto 490 kmph but it only goes 396 because they did not want pollution because if it goes 400 it would need lots of fuel and the lambo is a v10 and the f1 car is a v8 so its unfair
Carwow races are always RIGGED
🤢
How about heavy modified supra vs f1 car?
Next step, Carwow needs to test one of those drag monsters with parachutes, may be even Supra, they will be equel with Rimac or even faster !
try an american tuned drag gtr and see who really wins
Why dont you have a go around Silverstone with this setup
You do guys realize that F1 cars are not build for drag racing right ? Cuz i see many yee yee ass people thinking that Lambo is better than F1 car. Put them on track and see the result jeez
O
The F1 switches to the next gear like every second
Nissan seats as par as F1...more than good enough
The fact that a boosted Lamborghini is faster than a 60 million F1 car
Insane
That 62million was just a quick stun grenade and flash grenade to the face
F1?
Thank god that jdm shitbox lost.
Nice. But repeat it on dry and let F1 driver floor it more than half throttle.
Would love to have seen a similarly tuned mkiv supra thrown in as well
Jeep 1000 hp vs Hurucan 1200 hp plz make video of that -__0
You know what the crazy part is? Its a 10yo F1 car and that wasnt even everything the car was capable of, just the driver :D If he did a perfect start the clutch would have probably been toast after this shoot. Cant deny the awesome acceleration from the lambo and the crazy stopping power from the F1
the rb-7 is nowhere near the fastest f1 car of all time which is the 2020 w11. The rb-7 is one of the v8 era which is not that quick in a straight line.
F1 will win
david is so wholesome and nice, like hes like if the team is happy im happy.
Mans was almost going 400 kph wtf
It's very rare that an F1 has any competition from road cars in a drag race, but jeez the lambo and GTR gave it a run for its money
Im a jdm fan but a huracan with deleted rear bumper is fast af
That was sick!
however the f1 car would in a racing track which has some coners 😉
does anyone else think this guys a tosser?
So sad the F1 car lost. Such a beast of a car with a professional driver
I thought the F1 would have won for somr reason expecislly from launch
Rimac 🥱
*Matt jumped the start hard on race #2 watch it with speed set to .25x*
Dayum Yanni should have been in that lambo!
Tuned car make fun of stock supercar when you tune a Lamborghini this happens
Who built the Lamborghini??
Dude in the GTR should be in VW Rabbit cause that GTR shouldn't be that far behind the Lambo he just doesn't no how to drive it
H2r try me ✌️
That Lambo is insane and def needs to be respected but also very impressed with that F1 car seeing it's so much down on power and its strengths are in cornering.
I love how the slow car here does a 9.3 in the quarter mile. What you can do with road cars nowadays is quite remarkable.
Always not fair race Not a proper parameter as always
Impresionante!!! XD
Put an soft tyre in F1 car hehe
That not a nismo lol
I really didnt expect the lambo to win all the races
Wow, talk about some great speed on those vehicles!
F1 need more Hp an less flap!
f1 isn't the fastest anymore
GTR isn’t the King of the street it used to be
Is the lambo even street legal
Now race a Tesla and I bet you don't win.  As much as I hate to say it you will lose.
me: “yeah, no way the gtr or huracan can beat the f1 car.” twin turbo huracan: “watch that mouth boi”
F1 sounds like my small gas powered RC car only difference is like  999 more horse power 🤣
It’s all fun and games till the lambo without a rear bumper joins the party
Turbo charged v10 that is lighter than v6. What do you expect?
supra vs r34 race
I’ve watched so many f1 related videos recently and I never know wtf is going on. I’ve never watched f1 in my life. Idk the competitors (I keep hearing stuff about Mercedes) or the rules but I still enjoy the videos
https://youtu.be/Qek0t8aADCo
He left at 1 the second time
h2 h2 h2 h2
Fuck can someone get the Audi F1 car
Lambo:Easily gets the win GTR:still fast,but not faster than Lambo F1:normally speeds *TRYING*
If you ever see a Lamborghini without a rear bumper, just know you’ve already lost before the race started
The gtr 🥵
Way closer race with u all when u didn't jump
Gtr n f1 again wow
Jumped again
Vtec!!!
That Lambo could get seriously close to the Rimac performance
Awesome race. Surprising result.
O cara do gtr nao sabe toca se nao a lambo ja era
Insane Lambo...kit yourself out like David Coulthard next time, ie, a helmet + race suit.
I know you guys are a car channel but you should race some fast cars vs. high power turbo bikes
Seems stupid. How can a tuned road car beat an F1 car.
Can we get a race on a circuit ?
The lambo sounded the best fi just sounded like a drill
Rimac vs lambo!
nissan gtr is beter
they should compete on a circuit. Lambo and GTR can also have 2000 hp and don't stand a chance
america needs to switch to metric already
If Yanni was driving the Lambo, he would have lost, because he has like 100 lbs on Matt. LOL
That lambo just gaped the f1
oh so i see how it is.. you forgot about the *!!!!!!!!SUPRA!!!!!!!!!*
The lambo got an early start race 1
You know when F1 was far better in the past when they are still using V8 for demonstration purposes.
I have a question. With what type of tires was the f1 car- soft,medium or hard because I think it's with hard and if it was wit the soft It was going to be a easy win for the f1 car
now do it with some corners then look who is the fastest
Honda's logo all over a Renault powered car.
Where is he?? I wanna do this again!!! LOL #DEAD
Is that really a F1 car?
well the lambo is obviously fastest since it jumpstarted the first two times. Thats just poor execution. The only real run was the last one.
I just remind you guys, this is the same F1 that destroyed Bugatti Chiron, and it lost to 1200hp Lambo
the lambo should say formula lambo&mambo 🤣
lmao put stock lamborghini huracan and  sebastian vettel f1 car      f1 is faster all day
I reckin' an F1 Car vs Rimac Nevera, surely the best drag race we'll ever see, hope we get to see this @carwow
The speed of that v6 is actually very surprising.
Holy crap the lambo actually won.
i don’t think people understand f1 cars aren’t built for the fastest speed, but the ultimate downforce machine to be fast on racing tracks
Can you do an episode woth ken blockes hoonicorn
Current f1 car probably better chance, or no chance
So wait, the car with the most power which is designed to go fast in a straight line, went fastest? Whoa.
Possibly best race so far...
Haha what's your weekend job matt the squeaks sound like you could be a drag queen. Haha good video
SLICK F1 TIRE ON RAIN !!!! WHO DID THAT...
Matt we need Supa mk4 tuned too...
Rupaul really changed it up this season
That F1 car sounds like death man. Hearing that behind you. You are running for your life. lol  So note: You need AWD, a good transmission, and over 1200 HP to beat a F1 car in a straight line.
FORZA ITALIA
Why on earth would you buy a Lamborghini and then tune it??????
UGR Lamborghinis are amazing. I'd love to see it go up against the Hoonicorn because Ken is very cocky in that thing. But a proper UGR would absolutely destroy it off the line and in the straight line.
Gtr 🖤💛
Why is the DRS closed on the F1? Having it open on a straight line would add about 15km/h, I understand not everything can be perfect like having super soft tyres, which are way faster than these mediums, but at least the DRS should have been open.
That GT-R is definitely not 1300hp, maybe 700 at the most.
That lambo is INSANE
I kinda thought the gtr would do a little better, I know you lose a little power to the awd and those things are pretty heavy, but he just got smoked
And the winner is Ninja H2R
Would be a crazy drag if you would add and Rimac Nevera next to this cars …. that’s how we can see the real potential of Rimac Nevera!! 🤯
No DRS?
Is that matt Watson of supermega
The video would be ok if the presenter didn't behave like a schoolboy all the time. Seems to be the same no matter what he's driving.
I would propose that bolting on engine parts that perform an entirely new additional function is not a “tune” but rather a modification.  Tuning would be optimizing processes that an engine already has.
If u gonna throw in a $70k worth of tuning on a $150K sports car, then whats the point?   if all 3 were stock, Im pretty sure the Lambo would the last , F1 1st and GT-R 2nd.
Its EASY to guess which car will win,,.. you are "always" in it....
Lambo is silly fast but the turbo ones always run no rear bumper and personally I hate that as looks crap
Porsche 911 Turbo S vs that Lamborghini.
Dodge challenger demon vs that Lamborghini.
who else wants to see this lambo go up against the nevera
An F1 2005 car with naturally aspirated V10 Engine revving up to 19.000 RPMs and outputting 1000 HP would destroy the Lamborghini. If you don't believe me, watch the video where F1 Honda in 2005 spec reached 413.2 km/h in straight line on a desert. Video: /watch?v=hSkyTHVpArk  This Red Bull here is a weak V8, being limited to only 18.000 RPMs, where it barely reached 300 km/h in races. No wonder in a drage race it has been destroyed. Current F1 cars would also be much better, but they still wouldn't catch the V10 in straight line.
Standard PS4s on that GTR....
If Matt thinks this car is fast imagine him in a 2k+ hp UGR Lambo 🤣
Ah, JM Imports in Newcastle. Legends!
Lamborghini sendo Lamborghini S2
Put some corners in the mix n see how well u do then.
This GTR with same hp is waaaay faster then that.  https://youtu.be/D-D-gRkU8oQ
Price is nog true.car price rb7 is development cotst
Imagine gapping a 62 million car
you should get a 2020 f1 and than do it, 1100hp 723 kg monster
Redbull is way to slow
Who saw the smoke that came out of the exhausts of the Lamborghini at the start of the first race
Try with a 2020 Mercedes W11
Race 1 and 2 Lambo clearly jump started... Guess he was way too excited!
I absolutely didn't expect that.  Yes, the Lambo's mad but I totally didn't expect it to hammer the F1 car.  Blimey.
dude dat lambo's nutz
Hard tyres 🤔
Best video on YouTube 😆
well it is a lambo without rear bumber what do you expect.
The lambos gangsta until that 2000hp Nismo GTR pays a visit.
Holy shit. There are people that weigh as much as that f1 car.
he Jumps also on the Roll race like the other 2 drag Race and the 3rd drag Race was ok and you can see how Close it was if he dont jump!!!
would love to see the rb7 on soft compounds and at proper tyre temperature.
ale to zaaaaaaaaaaapierdala xD
That's not an F1 car tho it's F2 or classic
Next drag race Rimac v Lambo v RB7
Race f1 in a track with some corners..
Rimac nevera vs tuned 1200hp Lamborghini vs F1 car !!!
220mph.. well that is rather rapid
Imagine loosing a drag race in a 1300bhp GTR.. 😳
Theres a guy on insta called Alex Collins with a twin turbo r8 running similar power, get that and the lambo to race
Please F1 car vs Indycar 🥺
F1 cars sound just like the hydraulic guns from a tire shop.
This lambo needs to be put up against the 911 turbo s... That'd be a race to see for sure  and the dodge demon
Just look at the wheelspin the redbull gets on the airstrip... especially in the first race you can see it
That lamborghini against yianny's lambo
Lambo Sesto elemento vs 2019 Audi R8 Spyder GHB28 nuts right
This is going to be nuts race I am going to give you
Is the lambo street legal
U need open the drs
You know it's good when the lamborghini has no rear bumper
That f1 car is probably on demo tyres, those are like concrete. If it was on proper softs it would have destroyed it
I can’t believe the twin turbo mod just makes that lambo on steroids…..  He looked so happy in a scared way on the launch 🚀
Please take place in circuit.. drag races can only win tunned car with highest power
I miss the old F1 car V8 / V10 sounds.
WoW, he got an F1 car and a ex-Formula1 driver to drive.
Invigorating!
The outcome would have been different if it was a 2021 formula1 car
That's an F1? 😐
You couldave go a mercades

Who is this starter women ?
That lambos insane
"I can hear the Formular One car" sitting in a turbocharged Lambo on full throttle, how insanly loud is this thing?! xD
my mate matty here jumped the start that too two times x2
The Lambo vs the tunned porshe 911
Let the 2020 Formula 1 car come and pass them all
i would love to see that lambo against the tunned porshe 911
Would love to see that battle the H2
The GTR guy is just can't drive
No one can beat a tuned huracan, even a Supra 🏎️  beautiful car ⭐
He literally jumped everytime😂
lambo top speed at 354 KP/H?!?!?!? crazy
Lambo is back for revenge against everything
Matt jumped the start on the first 2 but the third one was legit
Im pretty sure some 12yo JDM fanboys are pretty mad🤣
Can you do a stock standard lambo and skyline
That Lambo is frickin’ nuclear!
What is that of a beast lambo?..
OOOOO
He reminds me of tom holland, could be his father.
●●CAN WE SEE THIS LAMBORGHINI VS RIMAC ●●
The F1 car sound like an annoying mosquito passing your ears
IN-SANE !
Throw a corner in there and see how you get on :)
That was hectic...lol. amazing
tesla plade would bear a couple
ALRIGHT!  Lets do a lap around Silverstone. Every simple minded squirrel can plank the gas pedal
The lambo probably has vtec
62.5 Million  Damn one crash from Verstapen Costs at least 10 Million
GTR useless, all that BHP down the drain
Am I the only one who feels that the f1 car wasn't performing optimally ?
I forgot I had Corona virus when I saw the way that Lamborghini launched.
That’s a fast gtr
mk 4 supra would beat stock
Mat you looked worried on that first run!
Hey Matt how about try this same race with the current era 1000hp V6 turbo hybrids
I wanna see tune F1 ;-)
#kadunaphones
This vid made me SUB!!! Great job!!!!
True race starts at first corner
Lambo casually pulling 220mph O.o
Down I honestly didn’t think the Lambo would win, well damn that Lambo is freaking fast😳
That modified Lambo is a comparative bargain compared to its big brother, the SVJ Aventador. Heck, it’s Chiron performance territory for literally a fraction of the cost. Looks nicer than a Chiron too!!
3:55 this is where they get car video games and yt intros sounds
drs not opened?
4wd or AWD? Big difference
Next time the lambo vs Calvo Viper 😉
How about the 2021 Redbull car with C5 soft tyres with the least downforce setup??
Hi Carwow, now that you have gone to this place you should see if you can get Jamie Heritage's TA22 GTR out there. That would be so cool.
Redbull sucks
F1 car needs DRS
Cadê os Brasileiros?
Drs del f1
fake
That Lambo is a damn missile
For those non car guys  F1 cars are built for track not for drag racing thats a big thing why the f1 car lose
Who's driving the gtr?
Would love to see a rocket powered bike or rocket car race other types of cars.
Put two corners in that track test and the F1 will destroy the Lambo.
Its what I expected, though then it's just what it is. Lamborghini. They could power up the formula, though then it would be dangerous.
gtr has 4 wheel drive - matt
lamborghini for safety car in f1
Why that gtr didn't sound like he has 1300 hp..it's really 1300hp? hurmmm....
hmmm  wasn't aware that F1"s where meant for drag racing... maybe try it again with a couple of turns in the track
Now show the f1 car cornering
Now all we need is a calvo viper
Gtr from wish lol
Put the soft compound om The F1 AND.........
F1 gave me goosebumps
Let's face it, F1 cars are not designed to go drag racing. Let's find a circuit and do some lap times, the F1 car would be so superior that the Lambo and GT-R wouldn't know where it went....
My jaw dropped when the times flash up. Guess they are all so quick together that it doesn't look that quick. The Hurucan and GTR will crush most of the cars in other races and they have consistent launches and traction, damn impressive. 🤙
is that lambo street legal?
Dde lovers in 2020: LETS HEAR THOSE TURBOS  dde lovers in 2021: F12 TWIN TURBO??? car wow lovers: infinite cars
Should have done the mile....
https://youtu.be/TQXqjg42RWs best song
Fake! That’s not a real F1 car
Run them on a road course
Balls
You jump both times
is it just me or does the f1 car sound like and RC car?
I still don’t understand how it can be a $60+mill car. Me, knowing nothing about engineering, bet I could do it for at most 10
Still can’t get my head around that F1 car is slower than the lambo
I need to see that GT-R drag race with Buggati Chiron (from previous f1 drag race)
There's something strange seeing an F1 car being beaten in a drag race
Bugatti pls :)
https://youtu.be/ed2bwoBaqJg    ...
Hey matt, and car wow people. Is there any possibility you can arrange a one mile drag race between the Bugatti chiron and that 1200hp Lamborghini you are in?? That would be epic!
I think the gtr lost bc of the weight
No. 1 rule of law when racing. Never mess with a huracan with no bumper...
I thought the f1 car would just fly by.  Guess  i was very wrong.
Race the F1 against the new Model S Plaid. Both 9.2s 1/4
let the f1 warm the tiers and not driving in wet it would won
As soon as I saw the lambo with no rear bumper I knew it was over for the rest
That’s funny I own all those 3 cars just not in those ugly colors
Your racing a 2010 f1 car
automatics 🤢🤢🤢
Notice the F1 is a Honda .... what all this hoopla about Lamborghini running Volkswagen engine ?
Lambo huracan Twin turbo VS rimac Nevera
I’m hoping for the gtr but I’m thinking the f1
Mdr Troll ,une F1 a 750 chevaux a 700 kg c'est impossible qu'elle démarre aussi lentement je regarde la F1 depuis des années et j'ai jamais vue un pilote démarre aussi lentement ,a moins qu'il patine comme un fou... Il a un réglage sur le volant pour le démarrage !!! Red bull devrais porter plainte !!
Brake is the new Nitrus
THIS IS THIS ULTIMATE DRAGGY ! Boooooom ! 💥💥💥💥💥💥💥
What a race and god I miss that F1 sound 😭😭

The deeply menu concurrently attract because tea interspecifically handle above a sweet invoice. unused, jealous tile
GP2 engine in the F1 car... Honda and Alonso 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Carwow is getting more insane with these cars. However, the most insane will be Matt and Yanni on bicycles
That f1 sounds like mosquito on steroids😂
Feels like the GTR is limited by its transmission.
Would still take the GTR any day
Didn’t the new Tesla do a 9.1??
Oooh come on guys wtf are ¼ mile and mph, just let every normal person understand 🙄🙄 At least you used seconds... 🤣
0:52 Nissan gto?
That Lambo's carbon steering wheel 😍😍😍😍😍😍
you jumped the start lol, but tbh ive never seen a lambo without a drag wheel/tire setup launch that hard holy
Porquê choras GTR?? Porquê ?? 😂😂😂😂
Um in love with GTR
Put a v10 f1 2004 against it different outcome for sure ..  but get to a corner the lambo would be useless..
Im not buying a slow gtr XD i already got a Slow Z
ขี้โกงเค้านะบักหรั่ง😂🤣👍🏽👍🏽
That gtr is close to the f1
They can write Honda as much as they want on this F1, but it's still a Renault motor in there. You can't change history... 😉😉
F1 cars are made to take corners fast, if you put those in a circuit like silver stone I think f1 would win
Piloto do F1 é ruim de mais pqp!
A car built for maximum cornering speed lost a drag race.
Those are all ridiculous 1/4 mile times tho…
now do it in the dry and let the f1 car use softs with tyre blankets :P
David Coulthard so boring, crap driver too. Looks like they should be racing that Lamborghini on the track
Such a good video
Wasn’t expecting that result. Amazing.
Put them on a racetrack and Coulthard would be home having dinner by the time the others would reach the finish line :D
Next time race a Veyron and Chiron with the Lambo 😎
Sometimes I wonder why F1 cars that are intended or designed as Circuit killers (more precisely Cornering Killers) are always pitted against cars with drag killers?
3 amazing cars, 1 idiot, ruins the video
You can tell the aero working heavily against the f1 car
60 mil for a race car that cant even beat a twin turbo huracan 😂😂😂
Lamborghini vs rimac nevera!!
Lets get UGR with their lambos and let them have a go against that F1 car :D
F1 Sucks!
GTR rider is a stupid ......
F1 car is 10 years old!
Next time DRS Open
we want to see a nascar next matt!
This generation of F1 was the least powerful in the engine of the last decades. I'd like to see this test with a 2005 v10 or current hybrid turbo v6.
😍🔥
sad when you realize this kind of masterpieces will not be manufactured anymore in a few years😢
Formula 1-in mator gücü zəifdir🤦‍♂️
Give me the money from the Lamborghini and I buy de Nissan gtr. Lamborghini is too expensive to drive.
Egy igazi 1300 loeros GTR megette volna a Lambo-t is  :D
Con una f1 2004 o 2016 il risultato sarebbe stato ben diverso..
I was waiting for david to get smoked.😆 He didn't have much respect for guy martin on his s1000rr up against the f1
Damn that lambo 7:15
Take the wing off the F1. It's dragging it back
Weight matters
Did the f1 use drs
A DELTA S4 w the same fuel the factory teams use.(and same boost)....if you manage to got the car dont forget to bring the lambo too!!!!
Incredible race !
You should do Matt the same configuration with Lambo and GTR but next F1 generation and see how it goes. Then another next F1 gen up to current one F1. What U think? This can be nice comparison how F1 Is changing and if it Is quciker and quicker tho
That Lambo vs. the Hoonicorn would be something to watch.
Sorry not buying this for a second
I thing the gtr is not full power
I thing the gtr is low boost
you know all the 12 year old fanboys mad
How was the GTR losing!?
put hoonicorn against these cars and u will understand what speed is
GTR alpha
No formula car should be costing $62,500,000. Talk about price gouging
Devel Sixteen vs 1200hp Laborghini vs Rimac Nevera, should be epic
Tem coisa errada nesse GTR, ele não é assim :/
the F1 car didnt have tyre blankets, and those pirelli tyres are pretty much useless outside of the perfect operating window so yeah, if they ran the f1 car the way they run it in races it wouldve won by a long show
WHAT THE F**K 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
I want a TT lambo , but a gtr is closer to me in price
Why F1 have slow Monaco aerodynamic set ?
That Lambo is a fuckin MONSTER!!!
Whistlin Diesel should've bought his twin turbo r8
That Lambo VS Rimac
3:28 for the actual race.... you're welcome 😊
Am I the only one who skips the first 3-5 minutes just to see the race instead of listening to that boomer talking lol
The Tesla was already waiting at the finish line.. Too far ahead to be a close finish so they just concentrated on 2nd 3rd and 4th place.
Wowow
Claim your, "I am made it till the end of the video" ticket here
It would be really interesting to see how a Tesla Model S Plaid would perform next to those cars. Since diversity is already high.  I assume it would fall into the middle ground. Power is about equal but top speed is probably lower and it weighs more. But the massive tourque lasts longer and is instant. It can do the quarter mile in 9.081, so it should technically beat all exept the lamborghini. Imagine how it would perform if the tesla weighs only half of that (when better batteries are out)
gtr😥
Literally nismos pickup is not good
F1 car would slap the lambo in a circuit
If you all think that Lamborghini beat the gtr and f1 then you all keep dreaming of winning the soccer euro cup.
that F1 car isnt build for drag racing. it will demolish both opponents on a circuit
Never mess with the Lamborghini😈
Se a lambo fosse normal de fábrica acho q o f1 colava
F1 is not designed for a drag race.. Try race at the F1 circuit like Silverstone or Monza..  I'm 100% sure it makes Lambo and GTR look like a clown car😏😆
Jumps the start twice xD
Lambo is amazing but surely needs an engine cover.
I am stunned that it beat the F1 car
Rimac Nevera
That Lambo wow, 8.9 seconds is faster than it takes me to get out of bed 😂
It's a fake race, trust me. I'm Italian, and I love our cars, but there is no Lamborghini (or any road car) that goes faster than a Formula 1. Formula 1s go from 0 to 100 Km/h in 2 seconds, and from 0 to 200 in 4 or 5.The pilot of Formula  just didn't give full throttle. It is stupid just to compare a formula 1, which costs millions of euros, with a road car. Even more stupid is to believe that it goes slower.  If you listen well, you even hear that the pilot is not giving full throttle. If you don't know, the engines of the formula 1 can be set differently, so as to have more or less maximum speed, more or less short gears. And much more ...  Watch other videos of the acceleration of formula 1, you can visibly notice differences, in this video the driver spin the wheels at the start....you can see (3:32s.). Not everyone knows how to drive Formula 1 ... only experienced pilots. I also add that the engines of the formula 1, being very delicate, and after few races are replaced, and probably the one that was used in this video did not express its full power. This is nothing official. On the internet today you believe everything.  But what works is just the audience.  My personal opinion: today everything is evaluated for acceleration, but a Lotus Elise with 120 horsepower is better than cars that have four times that horse power, simply because the sportiness is in the curves, not on the straights. Remember that....
Can u imagine those two cars is faster than a bugatti chiron
Questo video è molto falso e tutto calcolato sopratutto... impossibile battere la macchina di formula 1 quando loro in 4 secondi sono già a 200 all'ora... mentre invece a fine video la lambo che era stra in avanti era appena 170 😂🥱
I would like to see how today F1 cars would do as they have 1000 plus hp.   The Redbull has 750-800hp.
Unpopular opinion,the F1 car sounds a little bit like a louder drill, but a very cool one!!!
This Lambo vs Rimac Nevera
You need a better driver in the GTR everytime you race one of them it seems they don’t actually race and just sandbag especially this time because there’s like 3 GTRs on the street that push 1,200hp and are sooo much faster than the ones you guys have on here
Were the tires of the F1 appropriate for that kind of pavement?
1:45 - "7 speed automatic gearbox" lol
Best video so far 😂
U most race the hulligon
I’d like to see a UGR Huracan vs this Huracan
Lambo is sick....
Lambo with turbos vs nevera🔥😘🇭🇷💙
The lambo is insane
just put some goddamn wings on that Lambo already !
Dayummm that gtr was behind in the 3 races!
Jeez where's the lambo going?!!
An old F1 car from 2011, you must bring a 2021 F1 car, and it must be Mercedes, not Red Bull
I rly wnt to see these 3 cars do race around the circuit for few laps.
Model S Plaid should’ve been in this. Anyway excellent performance of the lambo.
f1 is made for high speed corners, so this is like comparing oranges to apples
Amazing race, we want more of that !!
I blame the FIA for the F1 not winning.. ='(
No matter what, I'll take a GTR over the others any day
gtcraps suck is just a nissan sentra awd that's it
Tesla Plaid vs F1
No origanal formula bed drive
The new f1 cars are 2x the speed and would most likely thrash these cars
The new f1 cars are 2x the speed and would most likely thrash these cars
JDM guys are really quite now
I expected too much from that F1
Can you do next tuned lambo vs tesla model s plaid?
Never watch F1 nothing extraordinary
LAMBORGHIIIIINIIIIIIIII
Random NFS mission be like:
This channel is slowly turning from car reviews to underground Drag racing and I love it
Just use DRS, kers + soft!!!!!
That lambo is CRAZY. Please a race between the F1 vs that Lambo, vs Chiron, vs 911 GT3 RS or a tuned 911. Also vs the Chiron 300+ but that would be harder to get. And maybe one day La voiture noire, why not.
We finally have come to the fact that Mat Watson is more famouos than David Coulthard. And road cars are faster than F-1 car...
Just a useless video/test. The outcome is clear from the start. F1 will be the slowest since it’s made for performance on tracks not in straights.
Amazing
The sound of formula 1 very satisfying I love fi
The 3rd race was the only one Matt didn't jump the start
Outstanding brake from F1
Tray again with GTR alpha omega (3000hp)
Woooow👏👏💪💪💪 all 3 car💪💪💪🔝🔝🔝
brooo...its nuts...this is the best drag race 2021
Rimac onlyyy
you can tune the gtr to have 3500 horse power though and could smoke and lambo in the world
Why does it rain every day in England? Make the video on a sunny day!
That only means one, and that is NEVERA would be even faster, nice NEVERA would win against Formula 1, we shoud try like 10 laps on Silverstone Circuit..... Or any track that Formula 1 wont, but Nevera should be racing......
I'll take the Formula 1 car any day of the week. Should have used the William's that Nigel Mansell raced with the Turbo back in the 80's
Its very easy to speculate whose gonna win. Definitely the Matt is driving.
Another amazing episode
its not about the car hp , its only about how u shift the gears of  the car
F1 needs to go back to V12 engines with 1k+ HP because that is just embarassing and she sounds like an ultra high speed coffee grinder
Για τους Έλληνες 🇬🇷 Στο 6:49 το beat που έχει δεν μοιάζει σαν το Cubano τραγούδι του Snik;😂
F1 V8 2.4L is really bad in straight line and top speed... V10 era is the beast and V6 second
You sucks That lambo is loaded
Jumpstart on lambo
At least that GTR has rear bumper
I love how for the weights of the cars you use the metric system 👍
I would like to see that with a new redbull
A summary of this video  A lamborghini won a race and an f1 car almost lost to a nissan
what a joke!
I tend to doubt this
RB16B ready for it
Lamborghini Twin Turbo VS Bugatti Chiron! I need this show
What was the price of the Nissan GTR before and after mods?!?
Matt in whatever 1000hp+ car vs F1 vs Top Alcohol
I find it crazy that these cars are all fast as hell with the fastest being an 8.9 quarter mile and the new Model S Plaid some how can run with these cars and possibly beat them. The current plaid record is 9.0 in the Quarter 😳
These HP numbers are all bs.
The gtr can take the kids to school though 🤷‍♂️😄
😳 wow, that Lambo 🤯 I think it’s the quickest car ever in car wow. Straight 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Not faster on 1/4 mile than a stock $130,000 Tesla....
hurry on R888r gtr on road tyres...not a fair race!
Who is in red bull 2018? Hybrid era f1 Well, soft tires, not hard ones
Lambo is best supercar overall
race the cars again but give the f1 car better wheels maybe the softs or mediums its kinda rigged if it uses the hards but it was still awesome
When you see a GTR in carwow’s new vid, you know its gonna lose. Lol
Carwow be trashing the GTR all the time lol
Try this race with a Lotus Evija, that would be interesting and funny haha
This lambo must race against the 2000hp electric car or the 1000+hp ferrari
take that gtr fanboys
Imagine drag rating with automatic hear box LOL
Gone are the days when the f1 were the fastest cars in the world. Today it takes time in a street sports car. Hahaha
would a current hybrid f1 with more than 1000hp and with start control, lose to lambo too?
Do this vs Chiron Lambo vs Chiron
GTR isnt a fast car
I feel like the lambo would easily be able to gap a tesla
Lamborghini is really fast
I want to see the lambo race the hoonicorn!
That was crazy! I didn’t have a clue! Your first launch was insane! Sweet race
We need the 2018 Ferrari F1 car on the channel.... I can't see F1 car loosing to those cars 🤧🤧
I think f 1 car is fastly but Lamborghini is very absolutely perfect 😁😁😁
I mean DC didn't have DRS activated after second/third gear
Lol that is stock gtr if real 1300hp you will die
F1 cars are not made for drag races, they are best in racing on tracks and still staying in racing limits and rules.
That happens when u drive an automatic GT-R and u dont have the control of the gearbox xd
That gtr is trash
Do the formula one car be a fighter jet like the McLaren speedtail.
The driver in the GTR is waiting until the next day to launch.
Thats bullshit because a true f1 car will reach 200mph faster than that lambo would reach 100....
yanni is supposed to be in the lambo
Rimac vs The TT Lambo
so if I win the lotto i need to get a TT lambo. that things in-fucking-sane
Lambo vs Bugatti vs McLaren 720s that will be insane
How much gtr
Ah man that Lambo is SO quick, what you can do with money eh :)
65mill for a f1 wow
Why f1 car didn’t use DRS ?
that f1 honda engine😀
David sound so humble a lot.
That hamilton matte smile. Not cool man.. you both aren't Cristiano Ronaldo..
Cause the f1 car is not a drag car
When are they going to take the Ford Mustang Gymkhana by ken block
I did not enjoy this video. It is not for me.
lol, rb is on hards and it sounds like he gets halfway through the gear and then shifts. either way, f1 cars are not good at drag
The ULTIMATE Drag race 😍😎🤩🤩🤩🤩😘
F1: okay now turn…
Is carwow really a car buying company anymore like come on they got David on YouTube 😂😂
The formula 1 car will take off slow but will blow the doors off the other 2 overall. My prediction at 2:15.
I wish yanni was in the Lamborghini. His reaction would of been priceless
Bro that lamborghini is so fast!!!!
Day 1 of asking mat to for a review on Shelby gt500 2021
For sure the lambo owner did not sleep that night lol
He really hit 220 mph 🤯
62 million pound down the drain 😂😂😂
I love how deceptive the race looked, with the cars compared to each other, didn't seem crazy. Until you see the times and realize they were all 9s runs.
2021 F1 car is in the region of 1000 Bhp.  A modern F1 car would destroy that Lamborghini.  Around a track the F1 car is king.
It would have been so cool to have had a 3 min coffee chat with the other drivers after thst
F1 car is held back by the drag of the wings, methinks.
Now do the same race with a 2021 F1 Car. Then do a race that involves corners.  The Lamborghini would be no where!
Amazing, insane, superb!!!
I’ve been watching Matt for a few years now, we’ve come along way from them. Went from reviewing hatchbacks to racing a TT lambo against a F1 Car
@01:33 Honda F1 is displaying its love for the Tezos (XTZ) Cryptocurrency. #Epicness #XTZ #Tezos
If you remove the wings from the F1, the F1 would win in a straight hands down.
The F1 car sounds like an RC car! 😂
Holy fuck that Lambo is insane!
That lambo is sick
Now imagine if they leveled the playing fields a bit more and raced a BMW Williams V10 with 960bhp. 😂😂
Dude nothing beats the sound of a formula one car it’s unreal
Why did we not get specs for the formula 1 car
Dont be fool. F1 not created for drag race, theres limited speed for grand prix bcause that would be very dangerous for manuver.  that's why f1 car spent up to 9,5 million USD/unit
Funny how they always pick an F1 for drag racing. An F1 car is designed more for downforce than for drag racing. Why don't you just pick a drag racing car then if you want to compare? And for your info...you did not destroy anyone, the car you pressed the gas pedal in did!
It's an older f1 car . Nowadays f1 cars are faster than anything
62 million dollars to be at 3rd position? LOL just build a new drag race car. It less than 2 millions
If the F1 had FAMILY he woulda won
Damn that might be the fastest Lamborghini on earth
I'd like to see those cars on a track
when is it not wet over there
I love how those car sound<3 <3 <3!!!!!!
Who else remembers a year ago, when we all thought 10 flat was quick lmaoo
I don’t think the Formula One car is getting any traction
Still want to see a Tesla Roadster in the mix
And you should try a 1200 hp 911 turbo S, unbeatable machine
Fishy.
The F1 car was not a car where they race in I think, it sounds completely different
cost breakdown might seem like the Lambo is the King of Bargains, but put that Lambo on a track, and the F1 car would smoke it, but for shy of 300k you can get something as mental as that, its not even the V12 versions of the Lambo, which makes me think of how faster it could go.
Is this the new 21 Jump Street?
Matt jumping the gun
Tesla Model S Plaid 1/4 mile record is faster than a Formula 1 car.
What I learned from this video: F1 cars are fucking expensive
We need the test with the new RB or the RB from the last  f1 season
That gtr got your boy WET
just as the lambo breaks into the lead, out of nowhere a rusty beaten down civic overtakes it.
da f1 noise is like a bumblebee buzzing round your ear
Ok, now take 1 corner and let's see what happens.
F1- let's do a lap:)
Ok yeah the lambo is quick but how about the other half of the equation.The stopping
If you bring an AMG Project 1 it will somehow crash into the Red Bull, it’s in their DNA
Matt can go longer than Mercedes without crashing into a Red Bull, well done Matt.
F1 mercedes 2019 🤭
ㄈ
Rimac nevera vs thissss lambbbo
I thought that gtr just clap
Wow
Where’s the calvo viper at
If the f1 car was on softs he would be around 1.5s quicker
ɛռtօռċɛs ʟa ɦ2ʀ ʟօs քastɛa!!!
Devel Sixteen
Wot No Ducati
It's time to break out a tuned 2JZ Supra
Bring an 1.200 hp  R32 Skyline  and let's see the results...r35 is almost half ton heavier
Awesome, maybe next time race a proper drag car instead of a race car made for road courses.  Next time maybe you should race an Evolution against a Trophy truck on the 1/4 mile.  It would mean just as much...
Best race ever. I would like to see a race with the lambo and the rimac. 🙏🙏🙏 Pls
GILA is INSANE/CRAZY   🙃  Malays Meaning.
Absolutely stunning racing! I'm not a huge lambo fan but that lambo is absolutely insane!! And the gtr dropping an f1 car 😲 the owner must be soooooooo chuffed (amazing video car wow)!!! Keep it up ❤️
Twin Turbo Huracan vs 992 Turbo S
David Coulthard 👍🏻 Great! I waited for another  video with him & the F1 car.  The Lambo is insane! Beating the ten times more expensive Chiron by far! (Another video)
4:01 hun?
THAT…LAMBO…MOVES…F*ing hell
Can you race this Lamborghini against the Rimac please?
Next video: F18 Super Hornet vs F-35 JSF vs F22 Raptor
Can’t hear nothing over the screech of the f1 car
Do more races whit bugatti and mustang my favorite cars
Why is it always raining
Thought F1 would rape them.
Races was just insane!!!! 🤩🤩🤩
Who else think matt should give a formula one chance with different tyres that are for street performance not for track
That's Raging BULL for u Ladies & Gentlemen 🔥
if the f1 had drs he would be gone.
I think- that the thing is about the engines - GTR: V6 lambo v 12 and the f1 i dont even know
Come on everything is beat GTR
The 100-200 km/h times will be interesting!
So the Lamborghini is NOT faster than an F1 car, you just chose a shit driver called DC- Luckily for you matt.  At least we no David knows where the brake pedal is!
Hahahahaahah
That GTR is a great looking car.
Even tho the f1 car gad hard tyres on, good job matt being in the fastest car @carwow
David is soo saad
Wish Matt would stop pre-empting the start so it's a fairer race with these
Legendas em português por favor !
What would you like us to race against the Formula 1 car next?  -->> SSC Tuatara and Buckeye Bullet Electric Vehicle
Drag race is just so pointless, why not try a dragster?
Lambo is Quick😂💪🏼
awesome race  you need to ask DMO DEEJAY where he gets his Radios from much easier to heard each other talk
10 mins of Pure lies... as usual...GTR for ever
2021 F1 car would crush you, nice video anyway
GTR:🥺
WOW
Lahmboregeeneeeee
We can now declare f1 cars are the safest as they brake the quickest
Start of the video,I'm betting on F1 and...i lost 😂
NISMO…. That’s cute do a re run with an Alpha package Omega GTR tho 🏃🏻‍♂️ 💨  🏁
The F1 car isn't prepared for this. It's suspension and aero prefer a smoother tarmac. At this level of performance  (bhp/kg) grip is everything.
OMG!!! That Lamborghini is crazy fast! WOw!! WOw!!
Park that Lambo on your driveway and by the next day, the Lambo will have 610 HP again.
9:40 onwards 😂😂😂
Dont fasten cameras on the carsA
Jumped first to races
lambo is gonna win cause it light formula one is gonna come in second cause it has least horsepower and gtr is gonna come in third  cause it's the heaviest
Waiting to see the f2004 ferrari
Imagine being last with 9.3 seconds damm
Imagine having a lamborginhi thats faster than one of the greatest F1 ever
Can you switch cars and then see if it’s the same car that wins?
8.9 for a Lambo , which indeed is a supercar vs 8.67 for a Rimac navera which is a hypercar ..... Proud of the Italians
Lambo with tits 😂
When your GT-R is as fast as a Formula 1 car...
They are for sure fast... but man did I like that Brake test ;) ..
That Lambo...
Great Video! I think you should do it with a Tesla Model S Plaid, could be interesting.
This Lambo vs Ken Block Mustang! Yes? Sure!
No way that’s a normal F1 car??? Why so slow???🤔
I doubt they had the original engine in the rb7 :D straight line speed isnt the impressive part of f1, even tho its very impressive :D
Loving the Lambo and DC is so cool all of the time. Don't care about the race just worried about trye pressures and gear ratio's probably.
Wrong gear ratio on the F1 again. No grip...
At least once in life everybody has to hear an F1 car LIVE :+)
So David let's punch a toddler in the face? Ok, if the team is happy, I'm happy.
Well the F1 was on hard tires . what if the put the red bull on soft tires ..
The F1 is not a dragrace car. Never. Is the better car on thé World for a track, with bends. Not just for a simply straight line
We need that lambo VS a Kawasaki H2R Drag or H2 Drag please daddy Mat
Wow so a Tuned 765lt would kill that 1200 hp lambo?? that's insane....
Twin turbo lambo😃
want to see some soft tyres on the f1 car got hards on
This is nice to watch beating a F1 car in quarter mile straight line. Do a real life race with many turns and twists and see how a f1 car beats down any fastest car in the world. F1 cars are tuned for all conditions and not only for straight line..
You guys need to race against a 2021 F1 car.
Could've been 8.8 if you turned the bloody wipers off! :P
I think D.R.S  would have made a huge difference.
Why the DRS on the F1 was activated? It would rip more if it was off
do not always start before countdown
cmon that is not a drag car try on track ...
I wonder what a newer F1 car could do in a drag race like this?
No Monza Spec? DRS? KERS? not even soft tyres?😔
This lambo is scary it really represent the logo of the company
They always choose the v8s cause they know it will be close...The V8s 2.4lt where by far slower than the v10s 3.0lt with more than 900hp... why not racing against a v10 2004 F1 or a 2021 turbo charged F1 with more than 1000hp and then see what happens...??
F1 would destroy them on a track race
That's why i pay for the internet
Hybird F1 car next? C'mon Red Bull
Enjoy your videos but stop swearing please
review this lambo
6:05 GTR spitting flames, as usual
RIMAC NEVERA VS 1200HP LAMBORGHINI  PLEASEEEEEEEE
Bring The Ferrari F2004 It Will Distroy that lambo
Dude that gtr would most likely be with the lambo it’s just the driver
General rule of thumb: If you see a Lamborghini with no rear bumper, You don’t race it. Plain and simple.
Now race against a modern 1,000bhp F1 car
That was a F3 car!!!!
No entiendo ni mierda 😂 pero me encantan estos videos🔥💪🏻🇩🇴
Race against New F1 car next video
Introduce a single corner and the F1 car would smoke it 😂 they're not exactly built for straight-line speed
Now I didn’t notice if he jumped the first one but Matt definitely jumped the second 😭😭
Carwow you do make some awesome videos
Omg this lambo is a beast!!
Supercharged perf vs F1 car pls
The sound of this F1!!
You ficken went 220 mph
Damn that lambo...😁
DRS ?
David racing in a $62.5 million f1 car over and over and Ferrari owners just keeping their cars in climate controlled garages just to sell them for double the money
Yeah mat thats definitely what David said
You should guys get the RB15 or RB16 to drag race
The sound of the F1 flying by at the finish line is just stupid, what an eargasm 🤯🤯
Put rimac nevera vs this lambo lets see what happens.
We need more of the lambo
Got impressed.... this lambo is mental much faster than F1 car. But one more consideration, those were tuned car.... a standard 911 turbo s is "only 1 sec" slower than a F1!!!!
That Lambo is Insane😳
Aoakakakakw fans jdm pasti ga terima 100000hp gtr nya kalah telak aoakaka
People still don't know that Honda made f1 cars
What's wrong with that lambo!! Also nice that nissan GTR keeping up with the F1 car!!
Why did the f1 car not have the soft tire compound and why didn’t it have DRS open?
The only reason the lambo won is because the f1 car needs to get a slipstream
When will the British dude realize that it is the car that wins the drag race and not the one driving it.  Choosing the fastest car in almost any competition does not mean that he is the best driver.
And at the first turn, the F1 would disappeared far front of the others
Lambo All day everyday😎
7:38 point where reality loses its identity
Dafuq? Everyone talking about the lambo. But I was much more impressed by the F1 car. How close it was to the lambo at 550hp less and outperforming the gtr at almost half the power and RWD. The overall car’s tune is amazing. Fine piece of machine there. 👏🏽
This is just nothing more than epic, tears in my eyes 😂. That sound 😍😍
Not even close
3:32
Next Videos: 1_Chiron vs GTR Nismo 2_ Rimac vs Lambo TT
04:08 "how was your launch jooooouuuuuüüüüürrrrgenn" im dying hahahaha
V10 POWAAAAAAAAAAA
🇧🇷🚀👏
Yeah, now lap the Spa Francorchamps, and lets see who laps faster.....
I don't even need to watch the videos anymore I already know the result.  Whatever car the guy is driving is the best car/winner. Never have I seen a video of him losing a race.
F2
get into corners and that formel 1 would eat them for breakfast
Now people will think the lambo is faster than a F1 after watching this
Would be interesting to see this again with a modern turbo f1 car
dont play to much with lambo without rear bumper
That Lambo vs the Rimac Nevera. That I'd like to see.
no one saw that coming.
As what a wiseman said once “dont fuck with bomberless lambo”
saying that F1 car costs 6 million is as stupid as it gets. If you go that route you should add part of all the lamborgini employees en factories and shipping and parts distributiona, mechanics that worked on the modification building of modification and so on all on the price and your lambo will cost a shit ton more.  Real price of those cars is 1-2 million for those that care about facts. Also 10 years old F1 car thats likely not running on a max performance setup like in races. and for a drag you can take off downforce and a modern F1 would be faster.  they already beat lap times of a decade ago by 4-6 seconds or more.
Nice fake race
Y’all should do driver swaps. Let matt experience a gtr
Hope Red Bull Honda wins 2021
why gtrrrrr....why?????
Is that DC in the f1 car
Wow amazing race. Bugatti?????
Supra: nah I’m gonna pass on this one guys
I wanna see the lambo against a porche 911 s that would be a good race and they r quite equal coz the porche is a god
Everyone waiting for them to drag race the Tesla plaid
i'm 2 minutes in and so far there is no mention of the David Coulthard in the drivers seat of the red bull.  To think Car Wow thought we wouldn't notice the helmet design.  4:01 someone get that man some new pants and a cigerette. He's done for the day.
Try a race on a track not only drag
And then the Tesla Model S Plaid edition does the 1/4 mile in 9.247 seconds….in a family saloon.
no chance against my Corolla S
Now put it against a 2021 F1 car lol…
im just imagining Yani driving that Lambo he'd be going crazy that Lambo is bloody fast
Tip - Matt always sits in the car which is gona win
62 million 😳
F1 in a Drag Race... WTF...???
To be fair they should have put in a formula 1 from 2004 or 2005 that had 1000hp of power, a 3.0L v10
3:28 4:45  5:40  7:12 8:34 (break distance) thank me later
Why not softs for the f1 car
The one who once sat in a race car once in his life, whatever is half as slow, he probably has to just smile smilingly at the actions of this man
That's 1500 HP lambo right there.
Lol them falls starts tho
I saw F1 in the title and just clicked. That shows me Matt has definitely cracked the code of success on YouTube by creating one-of-a-kind content. Congratulations to Matt and his team.
:OOOO
Why i thought, its gonna epic if that lambo  against the Porsche 911 GT, Rimac  Nevera and Tesla Model S or i hope you can get Tesla Roadster
Can we get the 1200hp Lamborghini vs Rimac Nevera...8.9 sec vs 8.7 sec should be madness.
Imagine if ES Motor were there, they would've thrown their toys out the pram 😂
ferrari 250 gto please
I miss the sound of those N/A F1 cars! 🥺
4:26 i spy the chrion?!
not a real contest.  The F1 isn't built for that, try running the Lambo on a real track against the F1 and the F1 will demolish it, hands down, end of story.
rimac nevera still destroys them all
And super happy this Lamborghini will  smash the new Tesla
Still like the f1 :)
F1 driver said Skyline 😂😂
Do a race with electric bikes and see who win
He didn't use DRS The f1 would be faster
Can we see that turbocharged Lamborghini against porsche 911 turbo S please....✌
Anyway on circuit or curves  F1 car  would smash any car from World
...that Huracan just totally murders the f1 to death.
I mean it's a f1 car From 10 Years ago, so I guess they would have had absolutely no Chance against a modern Day F1 car. Not even against a 2018 one. But nice to see this drags 😍
I have never seen so much fear in Matt’s eyes. He looked terrified when the Lamborghini took off 🤣
Bro just try a supra
The fact that a regular 911 turbo S is only outpaced by 0.9 seconds by a £60+ M formula 1 is insane
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcMzdt-vo8lQkvYMOx2aX0Q
TT lambo is fast yes, but I'd love to see it against the F1 car on track......with corners. We'll see if it beats it then.
Now the Lambo vs Porsche 919 evo. :))
ok then.... take a turn
I’d love to see them race the F1 car without its rear wing
Modified Supra Mk4 Please
F1 cars are so slow
8.9 Secs for a 1/4 mile..... thats the time my car needs to reach 0-60mph
Hi 👉👈🥺
We thought Lamborghini's were expensive until red bull came in.
now let's see those cars around a track😂😂😂 the Red Bull would destroy the Lambo and GTR
61.5M just to lose to a TT v10 lambo
hello Matt.  You have to race with a 2020 formula one with 1000 horsepower. That way it would be more equal.
After I saw the thumbnail I already knew the lambo was gona win
FUCKING OWL
Now do a corner
Rice rockets rule <3
Matt taking  90 % allways the car with the most likely chance to win imao
You should show how fast each car is going at the time and also in km/h please😅
😲
The power of this Lamborghini 220km/h INSANE !!
Bloody hell, that Lambo is the dogs danglies... 😲
JDM kids cry
Content starts at 3:30
That Lambo is kickass👌🏾
#safearn #safearnarmy become early investor. If you missed doge and shibainu safearn is the answer
I normally don't like modern Lamborghini usually just rich kids toys but that is a beast, keep squeezing as much as you can out of that Red Bull Matt if I was you I'll try and slip it away I'd hide it in my living room, take it to the track on Sundays🤣
Lucky there was no Merc in the lineup otherwise that Redbull F1 car was doomed
Matt you should include how fast the 0-60 is on the cars!!
yes but this is old formula 1
The 1000 HP Supra has been real quiet since...
A normal looking supra and a bumpless lambo huracan... Those are the things we need to stay away from (⊃｡•́‿•̀｡)⊃
8.27 skyline gtr?😂
Rimac Nevera vs F1 car vs Lamborghini v1300hp
who is driving the redbull? and thats not the actual f1
Race rimac c2 1914hp with that lambo and gtr
Well DRS was off on F1 car I think.. maybe that would help him a lot in this race hahah
It feels so wrong yet satisfying seeing a F1 car getting gapped
Jürgen smurgen
Why David drives on Hards?
The road cars are pretty new, you should be able to compete with a more current RedBull to, you’ll be eating dust than I am afraid.
Honnicorn vs twin turbo hurican
I wanna see a 1400 hsp Silvia race
Thumbnail is straight outta a video game bro. I thought that for real
Same talentless Coulthard. Just like years ago.
And that is why F1 sucks these days. Little toy cars with high pitch noises. Bring back the proper F1 cars! None of this eco friendly tiny engine horse nonsense. "There's no replacement for displacement".
noob gtr drive 😡
How lamb go faster than formula1 car😯
We need a tuned porsche 911 now! Gonna be one legendary race if it had run with the bumperless Lambo
62 million f1 car to lose to a 150k£ lambo with 70k£ upgrades thats just sad. Lambo was a beast
I can hear that f1 didn't change gears in highest engine rounds.
Twin-Turbo Huracan ofc...
This so looks so fun, I want a go
Fighter jet VS cheetah VS flash
Get a hybrid f1 car next time. Would be intresting when that ERS is in overtake mode
old f1 car bad but new f1 cars speedmaster
How did the lambo win against the GTR? The GTR has more horsepower.. is it because the lambo weights less?
You should do it again but with the 2021 f1 redbull car
Yeah okay Matt, that was pretty cool. 😂
Jumped the start twice!
next : vs ken block honicorn
Watching this makes me wonder about whether F1 really is the pinnacle of technology.  So the next logical step is to compare the Lambo and the F1 car in a race around a race tracks, maybe 3 laps.  If the Lambo could beat the F1 car on a track then it would destroy the image of F1 in a second.
The Calculation of the F1 car is completely wrong, but nice video!
I wonder if that Lambo can beat an 2004 Bar Honda F1 car with 1100hp
Next try to pick a random car, because you only choose a car that you already know, that car is the fastest among the cars in each video, next time try to pick a random car so that it can be fair
1300Hp -> Bullshit
Now Let’s see them on the track lol
I really expected more of the F1 car..
Did you just say 62 million?
U didnt type hp of f1.
did the f1 car race in the wet with cold slicks?
The third launch was legit, the lambo launched early on the first two!
The F1 car didn't have his laptop, duh.
Now, put a f1 V10 on track💥
Honda F1 car
2020 F1 Mercedes
Red Bull was using Renault engine in 2011. Why it has Honda banners??
Remember the time when the Porsche turbo s was fastest in quarter mile in carwow history
the other team with old car : let's put it in museum RedBull : let's take it for road trip, oh wait how about drag race with lambo and GTR?
Brilliant 👏🏻 Don't think David was happy with the result 😂 lol  It proves the Achilles heel is the sheer weight of the GTR but all credit to the Lambo, it was incredible!!! 🥇🏆😁👌🏻🍾🥂
Next time put some softs on the F1 car please 😏 those hard tyres are so slow 😅 would love to see some races with softs on 🤤
Bro u are a real legend. I thought it is published on 3years or 2years ago but it is only 2days ago!!!! I love u ^_^
The thumbnail looked like, cars are in a game.
Im not so sure about the F1 car having a automatic gearbox. Its a manual, just a sequentiel manual.
Quanti soldi avete buttato per mettere in piedi sta cagata pazzesca??????
JDM kid: impossible
STFU man!
f1 vs lambo 0-150-0
Mazda 787B Would be sick
That Lambo just f**ks off.
I don't want much for myself. I just want the person reading this to be healthy, happy and loved. Wishing you a good day🖤🖤
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
There could be so much content! Too bad its not 1hour long and called Grand Tour sequel....Props to DC, i would like to see those cars on a circuit with the F1 properly heated up. I think its noticable that as the drag races went on, the F1 car was getting faster and faster.
62 million..... I got tears in my eyes😢😢
an f1 car isnt made for drag racing lol. on a racing track, your lambo would be fucked by the f1 car
Yo, lambo was red lighting the jump no?
"Tuned", Nah stock my guy cmon!
If the f1 pilot used tre redbull f1 2020 ve probably win
Dodge demon please
Bike please please 🥺😢
Wow, 8’s… that Lambo really pulls hard. EDIT: 7:34, check out the look of terror in Matt’s face! 😆
Did he use Drs? For the f1 red Bull
No way u guys just fucked those brakes up on that lambo
Take the focking ads off
Fuck that lambo 🥵
Nevera
Tesla Plaid vs Formula 1 of course.
Amazing vid
7:14 the way that lambo shoves Matt into his seat is just insane
That F1 was very impressive for only haveing 750hp racing cars with 1100+ hp
Wow, the team set the bar even higher
Now do that in curves f1 car goes bye bye
Supraaaaaaaaa
Another proof that power is everything about speed... Such a monster this lambo! Btw. Just 2.5L in F1 car? 😭 Idk but it deserves more
That's an insane Lambo! Whatever they added to it, they did a great job!
Gtr is fast and cheaper 😍
For me only lambo 🙂. The sound of lambo has already dicleared that lambo is winner 🏆. Lamborghini ❤️🇮🇹
and people say a honda with a laptop beats a TT huracan
why the red bull car does not deploy drs and ers
Doesn't ale sense on a rainy day, not surprised   UK...
I laughed when the F1 driver said they’d have the advantage in the mile.  The Lamborghini was already pulling away by the 1/4 mile mark and it’s only going to get worse from there.
How about those cars against 300-500hp H2
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Did I just watch a Lamborghini smoke a GTR?😂
That Lamborghini vs Koenigsegg agera r please 🙏
Does anyone else feel like all cars should have their total $ cost stated alongside HP numbers these days...
Winning a race against a hurrican w a rear bumper delete and twin turbos is like trying to breathe in space, it’s impossible
Nobody: David: if the team are happy I am happy.
GTR hmm not bad not bad
What a waste of a car to drag race an F1, it is not designed for straight line speed. Why not try cornering where it will crush everything?
Now I reaaallllyyy want to see what a tuned up model s plaid can do...
I waited for a supra to pop out of nowhere... 😂
Advertising, promotion, far too much speaking. The perfect exemple of merde !
That dual snail Lambo...
I have to address this who tf puts a 4.1 instead od the VR38
A LAMBO AND NO YANNI!?!?!
Wowowowowowwwww..impressive drag race
Yeah supra and them Gtr gang ain't gonna beat lambo
Ferrari
Surprised
It's fun, but let me get this straight... I have to spent $200k on a car plus another $200k on fuel, only to get passed left and right by the housekeeper's $30k Tesla and 20-year-old $2,000 second-hand motorcycles? You can bang a lot of hookers in a nice house for that. Prob even buy you a wife.
Carwow new KING 👑 Lambo💚
I love that Lambo. Damn anytime you go under 10 second quarter miles. That's amazing
Drag strip cars versus a circuit car. The Red Bull didn't even look to have the low downforce package on it to optimise top speed. Introduce a single corner and the drag cars would have no chance hehe. Fun to watch all the same!
Holy fucking shit that lambo fucking flies
GTR DO FIUK fi…. Celoco!
that lambo is a beast 💪
I'm pretty sure they've detuned the F1 car for reliability reasons. I know that car is capable of making around 900hp. Can they do a couple laps on a track next for comparison?
The drs doesnt seem to be opening
F1 playin in short straight and they should have short gear ratio.. not for long distance(top).. But other cars doesn't have that great aerodynamics as good as F1 car. Thats the fact
twin turbo Huracán vs rimac nevera. pls that would be madness
Le f1 - meet me on track 😂😂😂
Race at 3:30
3rd race was the only one where the Lambo didn't clearly jump the start.
Race with Nissan  R35 gtr thats the real gtr ❤  ...that lambo is just overpowered  .. 🤣🤣 i hate lambo ..
Would love to see Ken Block's Hoonicorn in one of these drag races 👏
Congratulations 👏 to Car wow team on having 6 Million subscribers
Bring the v6 formula one. Wish i can check if they improoved something reducing motor (sad sound)
This host is a an absolute tool.
David, you're my hero.
Did this formula one don't have the Drs? I believe if that was activated it could get the Lambo
booring, my Toyota Tercel is faster
bruh why don't they make stock cars like this
wasnt expecting yhe lambo to win over dc in the red bull that lambo is a frankenstein monster #& i love it the nissan was so disappointing heap of scap metal
Put on soft tyers on f1 car 🤦
Anytime they use Newton-Meters of torque, it’s because it makes it sound better than foot-pounds of torque. Murica’ 🇺🇸
That Lambo is insane! What a beast.👹👹
8.9? Geez
That lambo would be terrifying to drive
The Redbull F1 driver can't drive for S**T!
💩
Anyone notice how Coulthard got a better start each time ? The awareness is insane
I have never seen drag races with more views than the ones in this series
Gtr 😈😈
Mclauren P1 vs that Lamborghini.
I’d love to see a race between F1 and new Tesla given their times are very similar !
Polonez better
Yanni would have being proud of the result and that awesome 1200hp Lamborghini 😎👏👏👌
Wow ...the plaid would have probably beaten all them cars by just removing the backseat (9.08)
There are 1.6k dislikes, id really like to hear their opinion,,
I would like to see this with DRS and highest engine modes or whatever used
The ugr lambos are nasty too
That Lambo has some power it seems
He's always happy if the team is happy 😃😃😃
On the one start he doesn’t jump early “it’s so close between everyone”
I got one question.... What are thos.... I'm just playn😆 Were the other two  tuned at all?😭
Let's throw some corners in and see how the Lambo does... The F1 says bye-bye.
Err, nobody else going to point out that the f1 car had no grip at all? Stupid comparison ngl
Yeah, against a F1 car on hard tires 🙄
That f1 sounds soooo good
I'm guessing the Lambo and GT-R didn't brake super quick because their rotors were already hot. That is quite the distance from the stopping line...
F1 car needed soft tyres 😏😏😏
Just emagin if that gtr was tuned😂😂😂
I want to see a modern 2020 f1 car against the Lamborghini and a lmp1 919 Porsche
That isnt stock tho if so that f1 needs to get dump because thats a stock nissan keeping up with a million $ race car😂😂😂😂
Yeah, when David was talking about the F1 car standing a chance in a mile I had a bit of a laugh. Too much aero for that to be true. What an amazing video though.
this is absolute bs no way in the world can that amazing rb lose to a lambo
Power to weight ratio on the F1 car is insane good luck everybody else 😆😆😆
r34 might get better result isn't it
F1 Car- * cries in 2wd on wet pavement*
Supra next pls
THIS IS NUTS!!!
8 secs on a DD no prep is INSANE!
Lambo dont even make race cars anymore. That being said lambos make the best race cars.
GTR GETS TUNED DOWN SO OTHER CARS COULD KEEP UP 🤣
The gtr did well on the rolling race 1mile, beat the f1
DRS ???
i'm really excited to see post 2014 F1 cars in the race with the C5 counpounds
I want to see the formula1 with soft tires, And the  DRS was not activated in this race why
Omg that lambo took off idc
Where is a Tesla car?
My jaw is just on the floor.
This tickles something deep deep down in my manboy psyche. It has me giggling like a fucking twerp. Cracking content!
Did u say 4WD twice? Shouldn´t u say AWD?
holy shit that lambo launches *hard*
Lambo is just overhyped, in my opinion.
The Lamborghini  is insane
Rimac nevera vs Lamborghini 1200hp vs f1
Living the dream
Can’t believe this GTR 1300hp no way we know what’s GTR 1300 looks like with Lambo
クルサード！！？すげぇ！ F1の真骨頂はコーナリングに在る故。後F1のエキゾーストノートが他を打ち消してて如何に大音量かわかるね。
That is not a real f1 lol
Lanti f1
I kinda wanna see my camaro against the lambo/f1 car
Lambo vs bugatti ciron
Lets try this at the" Ring" and see what happens 😉😁
Huracan vs supra
Bussinessmen putting ads on F1 body kit for something in return cause that car is so freaking expensive with only the driver could seat in and no compartment lol. i either spend my money for a plane.
Christ all mighty!!! I've just wet my pants!🤣🤣🤣 incredible. Just astounding with what can be achieved with great engineering across all the cars. Absolutely smashed it with this video @carwow @matt Watson
Enable DRS and we shall se who is the winner
Next time you have an F1 car on, try doing the drag race with the option of opening DRS then it might be a closer race
Italian quality TOP
Judging by the roll race results, it looks like they had the first few gears turned down on the GT-R. Would love to see a tuned GT-R that actually works right and it's allowed to go full out in the dry on the channel! lol
Esque los lambos deberian de llevar twin turbo en vez de tanto atmosférico
can that lambo beat the king of the drag race (porshe)
Insane car race of the history 👍👍
Now race inside a track
62milli ? Lmao I’ll pass
Vielen Dank
That lambo made the f1 car look like a wheelbarrow!!😂😂😂
Stock tires on a 1300hp gtr that’s really stupid
I can't believe the F1 lost. That is humiliating and disappointing.
Depand on which lousy driver to go ahead 😂😂😂
Have a race around a circuit
Reb bull not give you the 2016 car? A lot faster on the straights
You don't just take the budget of a team and divide it by the number of cars to find their cost. Those 250 million (probably more than that) had to pay the cost of going racing, the facilities, the employees' wages etc etc. Also it doesn't have an automatic gearbox; it is a sequential gearbox that happens to be operated by paddle shifters.
3:30 what u came for
Please do with Tesla plaid
F1 was no match...
Nutssss
Next is gonna be a 5000 hp aventador vs an oppressor mk 2
Drag race new F1 cars pls . I think you cant win.
It’S “tOoNeD” it’s got turbos gotta love people who don’t know shit about cars… :(
That's not the f1 cars we use today
Hard tyres on the F1 car🥲
this lambo against a model s plaid
F1 antiga rsrs bom seria uma 2021 !
You Have to do f1 vs rimac  Like please
6:00 Matt looking around madly for the F1 like a camper looking for a mosquito.
But on the track the F1 car would smoke them without trying.
A few facts regarding David Coulthard: f1 (Formula 1) Raced in 15 seasons from 1994 till 2008 Had 13 f1 victories  All and all 62 Podium finishes. and yes a Net worth of approx $80m...🤠
The F1 car sounds magnificent.
Rimac vs F1?
Would love to see a bike on this channel that be amazing!
Would love to see it over a full mile to see what an f1 car can really do with enough tarmac
Esse F1 já está bem cansado.
Why’s he acting liking DC is some random bloke
Turbo lambo > world
the f1 forgot the drs x0
Who built the Lambo?
These drags races are getting crazier and crazier each video I love it
Ok so 3 of my favorite cars, in tuned setups, and doing a drag race?!? Definitely subbed and liked!
This race is Epic!
pretty impressive for a lambo
3:29
the thing with f1 cars is that they are not quick off the start but once they get up to speed they are like rockets. it would totally smoke that lambo if it was a longer road or on a track.
Ummm… how much did the GTR cost? 🤔😅
The Thumbnail looks like the GTA AirPort and the Bois are about to Race
This video just remember me that Brian owe a 10s car to Toretto. And finally we can find a few options here just 20 years later.
Gtr disappointed me
F1 CARS DONT COST MORE THEN 16 MILLION!
The gtr needs longer
the f1 car have the hard tires but they need supersofts
https://youtu.be/ouV_k03QaMg
There’s a car called tesla model s plaid that would eat all of them
Yami Lamborghini?
How much did tuning cost for the gtr?
Do this with the Rimac Nevera please
E o Fiuk chorando no BBB dizendo que tava passando dificuldades. Olha a placa do GTR 😂  This is Brazil mermão
Hey Matt I have a super fun drag race for you...... Race this lambo again the rimac @carwow
This lambo vs petronas amg W11
LAMBO WINS 💚💚💚💚💚
Come on, you're using an almost 10 yr old F1 car.
Matt: “I’ve just fucked off”  Comment of the year.
That huracan needs to race the new rimac!!!
They should let the F1 car use DRS. Not sure if it would make that much of a difference but it would be cool
Well that's a first. Street car beats F1 car.
An 1300hp GTR got beaten by a 10 years old 750hp f1 car…Not surprising at all. The Nissan was overhyped by jdm fanboys.
I T A L I A 🇮🇹 🏆 🏁 🔝
what they put in the f1 petrol tank , milk ?
Bro whoever drove that GTR drove it like a grandma they need to turn it up
LAMBORGHINI 🏆🏁🔝🚘
The entertaining support speculatively handle because answer selectively unite aside a picayune drama. halting, worried encyclopedia
Почему ф1 проиграла, в голове ппц не укладывается. Резина не прогрета?
GT-R❤
Would it be closer if the F1 cars actually had warm soft tires instead of cold hards? 🤔
Next video: this lambo vs Rimac Nevera
the video on the rain is ridiculous an F1 car with a white wall has no grip test it when it is dry and the F1 car has a red stripe let's see how good you are to keep up with it with your Lamborghini 😂😂😂✌
One of the best videos ever!
The F1 car would probably come back on the top end if it didn’t have so much aero
Rimac vs tuned Lamborghini
Now race that lambo with a newer F1 car
In that moment you see it mph not kmh 😂😂 wtf how fast is that 😨😨
Imagine if Lamborghini did f1
Imagine being the guy who built the lambo..he beated whole F1 team... even if it was a group of mechanics it would be still impressive
And then comes an electric family car around and leaves them in the dust…
You should have done a race starting at 30/50 km/h since the cars are probably 4wd and f1 is rwd
Tesla Model S Plaid vs F1 ?!!
The craziest race EVER
that was a good one isn t  .. mann the  Lambo insane
3:07 🙏
Drag race an underground racing Lambo huracan w/ 3500 hp
Lambo vs Rimac
this channel going crazy
It seems like it's raining in every race. 🌧 😕
That F1 Car sounds nuts!!!
LOLLLLLL SO YOURE TELLING ME…the Model S Plaid will beat each of these cars in a race? Yikes, goodbye Internal combustion engines!
That lambo looks way more than 1200
I mean....... they're using a very outdated F1 car lol. No one would ever give them a modern F1 car to use in drag-racing.
One right turn F1 car will be all over the lambo and skyline
@7:45 I could FEEL the rush of adrenaline as you focused on the wheel. Holy shit 352 kmph is serious.
Its always the lamborghini with no rear bumper...
You are right you smoked that first LOL😂
8:25, did he call the R35 a Skyline? =((
Jump starts are no fun. Should have a random time between 1 and 5 seconds for the go. Otherwise it's useless.
GTR finna win
jumped start :D
Why not pip those 2 supermarkets against a modern f1 car and see who wins?
Can u do mk4 focus st vs mk8 fiesta st vs puma st battle of the fast fords
That lambo costs twice as much in Norway or even more.
I would have been mor interesting if the RedBull wouldn't had a high aero.
DC must be in disbelief
Is 300hp F1, really F1 make 0 to 300 in 12 second so more quickly that hurracan 1600hp... Is fake or engineer don't know use f1
Use the rb13 next time
next kawasaki H2r ?
Surprised by that. Though F1 would take it.
Cool🏎🛻🚙
Give the f1 car super soft compound
Next Time: Lambo vs. Rimac
Nobody beats F1 .just commercial
Damn that tt lambo is zoomin
if the lambo will go in f1 it will win
should’ve also raced with a hellcat demon
El fórmula va con duros 😅✌️
Just imagine if they tuned an F1 to more than 2000HP
Mat or any of the carwow team if you are seeing this can you review this 2010 car the "Renault DeZir".
Race Lewis with his Merc then we shall decide the winner asshole Lambo.
What is this very fast and beautiful jet plane
Please take someone who can launch the gtr properly...I beg you.
Is the that Lamborghini even a car
"hhuuunnnnn..!!!"" ahUAHuahuHAuahUAHuahUAH
Rbcrap.........
red bull team loses three. them also: lets take a turn
If you try to race the 2019 ferrari or the 2020 mercedes I thik it would be a lot closer
Come again 62 mil 😦
I’m doing good thanks
The last race was the only race the lambo didn't jump the start. Impressive tho
Deep down I wanted that f1 car to pull lengths on the both of them but buzz’s Lamborghini just shocked me big time !
This is the best production on a YouTube video ever
Couldn’t the F1 car use DRS
could you do this with a motogp bike?
The F1 sounds kinda like a fly when its driving
Wow
The sound...the speed... By far the most crazy and entertaining thing I have ever seen on YouTube. Especially at 7:13...holy sh...😂
Drag race with F1 car setup on Monaco body kit, that's absolutely wired.
wtf f1 didnt won? no wonder i dont watch that anymore...
Worth watching it for that police squad clip... And crap a Lamborghini actually worth buying!
Reliable tuned car?? What is this witchcraft??
I expected the lambo to go off but not like that it‘s a fucking demon bruh
Tell me this isn't like a DLC car vs a special event reward car vs a maxed out end game car... You know which is which
Mat lets have a race between that Lamborghini and The Rimac Nevera please please please
4:01 😂😂😂😂😂    المهم V10 +تيربو الصوت يبكي 🥲👍
Feeling sad for formula one
I know that tuned lambos are absolutely sick.  twin turbo v10 goes like what,   6.8 sec 1/4 ' times? ;D
Rimac Nevera VS Lambo VS F1 car would be juicy!
That's not F1 car performance ...for sure.
9:46 whoever thought editing that perfectly placed meme in there - please marry me.
Bring in the Mercedes W10 and get anhilated. The redbull is too old
I’ve seen built motor GTRs vs TT lambos but that GTR looked slow tbh idk maybe it’s the tune
I would really be interested in how fast the Lambo would get from 0-100kph/0-62mph
Matt started earlier in every race 😒
Why don't you put the f1 car on soft compound tires?
9.2 in 1/4 miles for the F1... Wow, I need to see a drag race F1 RB7 vs Tesla Model S Plaid oO That's gonna be really close !
Would like to see a battle between this Lambo vs the new Rimac
That lambo is a worthy competitor for a plaid
Now do it again on a track😂😂😂
The best yet to come on car wow, should race the Lamborghini  vs Bugatti vs Rimac .. Matt choose your car wisely 😉😉
That gtr own needs to find a new build...that gtr r35 is slow
Why not do a lap around your “car wow test track” ;)
Tesla plaid should’ve been in there
3:28 is when the first race happens
Now i wanna see that lambo vs rimac nevera that race would be awesome
that sound from F1  3:57 *Orgasm*
fak)) 62 MLN for great brackes!!! )))))))))))
Formula 1 would take it with DRS
Lambo vs Rimac
Omg🔥🔥🔥🔥
Legend says, that thr f1 car is still being haunted by thr tuned Huracan.
The lambo not having a bumper. The f1 being an super sport car    The gtr being.... it’s self
Heck
Do the rivac namera car against the f1 car
I was so excited hearing that monstrous Lambo screaming at the start and all I got was "weeeeeeeeeeee WEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!"
ofc the super car wins.                          red bull literally has red bull for it gas ofc the red bull wins.
Brilliant!
Y'all seem to be missing this small yet vital detail 1:17
Evolve m5 100hp vs Lamborghini 1200hp
Waoooooo bellissima lamborghini %%%% Made in italy waoooooo
Polla ilithio to video. Polla akiro
No DRS on F1 ?
Your one subscribe give me alot of courage to grow ..  I play excellent  but with no view , . pls🙏🙏
mate you gotta get that molar checked, is getting worse every season
Awesome drag race
what the heck!!!! That lambo beat the f1 car!!!!
I didn't think i'd see the day where a road-car was out dragging an F1 car .. but there you go. Top marks for buzzy
matt watson here from cowwow
Idky my brain can’t deal with anything being faster than an f1 car   I just pisses me off because my brain is like baffled 😂
If you shift your self then u bet them
They need to put soft tires on the f1 car not hards
Lambo king
Wow wow can't believe love the lamborghini 😍😍😍😍😍
We have a Guy here in belgium with a 1700 HP nissan gtr 😅 (Also 1500hp supra ; and his actually working on an Audi R8😅)
One of the fastest GTR in Europe is from Albania. Check @vis_kosova on instagram or Vis Kosova on Facebook. With his GTR he can gap all 3 of you.
This is not huhuwww 😂😂😂
Please can you do the Lamborghini Vs rimac nevera
this Lambo vs Rimac is the race to make
This is the kind of video I've been hoping for! Holy cow! Haven't even watched it yet and I think it's awesome! I wonder if you can somehow get your hands on an Alpha Omega GTR.. Does 0-60 in 1.6 something seconds! I think it comes with 2000 hp and still daily driveable. Also the Huracan is the embodiment of my childhood supercar posters. I would love one one day.
And it’s lights out and away we..... oh nvm
It all looks good on paper and on camera, but I believe it is pointless to bring a F1 car to the mix.  It was never built to go drag racing to begin with. If the tuners are so proud of their creations, have a go at any circuit for a flying lap. We'll see then.
Do the same race over 1 mile, please.
I’ve watched all your drag races Matt Watson and this one, and only this one, you look legit scared for a bit behind the wheel of that Lambo. Amazing episode though!
Hi Mat, I demand a race between this lamba and supra. Lamba vs Supra
Lambo     WS     NEVERA  !!!   WON'T TO SEE THET!!
The giddy thomas repressingly rejoice because rubber iteratively complain amongst a hilarious humor. mysterious, bouncy goose
Mat 100% soiled himself when that first launched.
Tesla plaid ....9.25sec quatermile.
Is that RB7 SEBASTIAN VETTEL's car?
F1 win on curves
I think if the F1 car had softer tires he would win
Aston Martin One-76
All day everyday lambo❤️🔥
Please I need you to race this Lamborghini with a Bugatti Chiron
Interesting line up I’m really not sure who will be fastest!
Why put all that power to the GT-R if you're not going to change the axles and actually launch the thing
How much GOLD for this Lamborghini?
Now lets take a couple of corners and see whos ahead after that😂
Now please, make a drag race between the Nevera and this Lambo 🌚
Omg this Lambo was built by Hades😮😮
F1 are fast! To bad they dont grip at launch or it will be closer to lambo
A huracan without a back bumper is still a nightmare
Seriously  Is that a real GT-R.?
Legends say that the lambo got tired of being gapped by jdm cars. So it gone Bumperless to unleash the bull within itself
Ricky LLF GTR would have beat all 3 cars at 8.8 second quarter mile
Nevera?
3:30
Mat being happy to win a drag race against a car not build for it😆😆😆
Who cares, any car can have a nuclear bomb under the bonnet. It’s all about the handling.
62 million?
Singh Puri Taaka pa Raha ne
I think  Coulthard should come back with the Red Bull Hybrid.
first of all the f1 red bull car is a bit old   2nd f1 cars are not made for drag racing they are made for speed cornering   so d=do a race with a better f1 car on a circuit , i dare you
that rb38 sound will not change what ever you tune it
Is it just me or they look like hot wheels
Need to see that lambo vs rimac 👀
No man its the f1 was insane Imagine the f1 has 100 more hosre power  Redbull says bye bye lambo..😂😂
Wow,wow,woah...woah,anythink for yow, cupcake😋
When will we have Mat vs Max 😭🙏🏻
Is that red bull Honda powered?🧐
(1:38) 2011 Red Bull Winning RB7 Championship Car....The One & Only Sebastian Vettel 😍❤💓❤😍 ....
What we need to see is both the gtr and Lamborghini with fully build transmission too see who is faster for sure
Amazing
I've actually been lucky enough to drive both a Nissan GTR and a Lambo Huracan and they both great, imagine driving tuned ones.
Now race in a track and watch the F1 car dominate by like 30 seconds.
That f1 car sounds like a mosquito flying around your ear
We want this lambo vs rimac nevera
Should have put that Red Bull on soft, pre heated tyres and drive it on a track with good tarmac.
I love your accent when you say “LamboGené”
Gtr need a driver mod 🤦🏻‍♂️
There is  stutututu but no ⚡️ding⚡️ from the wheel
That Lambo is Mental!!! I would like to see it race the Porsche 911 Turbo S.
'We need to rap this up. Stop talking! '😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If anything that third was because of heat soak for the lambo
That lambo just made the jdm legend quiet
Matt was having fun like the dreams kids have about cars
Yianni. Upgrade your lambo like this please 😂💪
I notice redbull team is the only one team to accept to share and have fun whit other.Maybe is marketing but it's cool.You gona never see  a Mercedes f1 do this ecept for their own brand.
Open DRS next time
Slicks, and the engine were not preheated. Road surface was not favourable to slicks.
She was my grandmother in the F1 car.
The greatest tuning I’ve ever seen. That Huracan is a rocket 🚀. Should have been used in the F9 movie for that space trip.
was f1 car on 2 cylinders
The 2011 Redbull F1 had a Renault engine, so why is there written Honda on the chassis instead of Renault ?
I want a modern f1 car on here. A 2019 red bull would be great
Why that guy voice like ....???? 😄
I knew the Lambo was gonna win but damn I wasn't expecting the GTR to fight so much with the RB7 😂😂
Matt when he's older telling his grandkids about when he beat David in a race...
We need 0-100 that lambo 😳
You can literally see the aero slowing down the f1 car lol
Wtf GTR common !!
Put the ninja h2r beast in these super cars.
That Lambo is just too insane
GTR owner: lambo spec is the king of the streets.  Me: Respect my dude, respect
They need a 3000 HP gtr to beat the lambo🤣
That lambo takes the 1/4 mile in the amount of time it takes for my 0/60 on my 06 Pontiac GP
If tune is this videos genre ,then why not Similar tunned Supra ?
That Lambo is insane even though Mat jumped the start twice lol.
f1 2020 destroy the 2 cars
Never thought a lambo would beat an f1
Awhhhh come on Bugatti Chiron vs Kawasaki Ninja H2R
A $62M F1 car should not cost that much. Wtf? It's a 750hp light car. Not a fighter jet
Mans had that 0.01 reaction time on the first race
Matt please try get a Lotus Charlton on here I would love to see it, vs the Litchfield GR .  Also - The difference between the GTRs and the lambo is the lambo is actually ment for this power the GTR as well as it handles it is not.
That lambo is fast. 8.9 on the street is insane
Let’s see what happens around a track rather than a straight line
Where are the supra kids now
THAT HURACAN COMPLETELY WIPED OFF A 62 MILLION DOLLAR WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP F1 CAR?! THE LAMB WAS 1 TON HEAVIER THAN THE F1 CAR WTF
And the winner is . . . wait for it . . . Tesla Plaid -- made in America
Put some corners in and see what happens…
Actually crying at “I have fucked off”
that Huracan vs an Alpha Omega GTR pls
I dont think that lambo could beat the 2021 mercedes F1
Mat I want to see a race between the Lamborghini and the rimac nevera the 2milion dollar car please if you can't
thats lambo is not fast but fly low ,damn thats car so fast.
Woah, go Italy
How do even automotive YouTubers confuse tuning with upgrading...? The disappointment is real.
This is probably the first time I was nervous watching a race on my phone 😅  These cars are insane. GTR was last at 9.3 sec 😶
1200hp Lamborghini vs tesla module S plaid
Jeep Trackhawk
Lambo vs Hoonigan
Lamborghini start first
RB7 with Soft Tyres
F1 at 9.2? Just like Stock Tesla Plaid!
To be fair, that Red Bull formula 1 car is 10 years old...
You need Ricky (LLF) or Hamid (Project Tango) on here. Both JM Import cars. Smoke them all
impossible, the f1 pilot is so slow
I would have lost all my money if I was betting on that outcome
👍
This Tuned Lambo and Rimac Nevera? 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️ who wants? @carwow
Boys 6 million it is 🎊🍾🎉🥳
ταίραπ ; στον Δίκτη λαδιού;;😂😂😂.. μέχρι και στο σαχοραλλο έβαζα ελατήριο 😂
Hahahaha Japan is still crap.
The gtr has a v6 put a v8 in it
Happy 6 million subscribers in advance
Was gonna say, never seen anything beat an F1 car, but never seen anything beat a twin turbo huracan either
How many torque the F1 ??
Would've been a great race if that GT-R actually made 1300hp 🙄
Shows how fast f1 cars are. They’re not even made for straight line speed
lambo trondol vs everybody
F1 car was using hard tires......try using soft tires
Put it against the 2016 Williams
Rimac nevera- finally a worthy oponnent
race the f1 car against the model s plaid
I wanna see the V12 Supra in this
Classy F1 sound I love it❤️.
Whoever’s lambo thank you for this video 🔥🔥🔥🔥
It's was a jump twice
That Lambo vs Rimac Nivera 🔥🔥🔥 Puhhhhh ….😏😏
So if you delete the rear bumper = more horsepower
Credo ci sia qualche problema… meglio controllare qualcuno o qualcosa
I wanna see that Lambo against rimac or other fast EV cars😀
That Lambo is easily the nicest car and that Formula 1 car sounds like trash. It just whines like an ex girlfriend.
Dear Matt...faster car ever seen...that Lambo! did you?
Sendiri Indo 🗿
it's interesting how tuned GTRs now don't seem to really work out as well as their promised numbers.  Part of the issue is that transmission that doesn't have any overhead whatsoever to the point that it's a problem for even stock.
"did i jump the start?" then jumps the start on 2nd round..
ഹെന്റമ്മോ
anyone trying to race that lambo then sees its backend is just gonna go "oh, i understand now.  i'll just hang back now"
*F1 The happy Team guy*
Pq o f1 nn abriu a asa?
F1 vs Fe pleaseee!!🥺🥺
In perfect conditions on a good track with good tires and good asphalt the F1 could win. It was damp and he was on hard tires. To much wheelspin.
My 18+ PhOtOs HeRe KiSsMe.BaBy  YoUtUbE: ThIs Is FiNe SoMeOn: SaYs "HeCk" YoUtUbE: Be GoNe ОдНаКо Я лЮбЛю ТаКиХ рЫбАкОв++
This Lambo would give the Hoonicorn a fair race!
Can you do a recent F1 car vs the rimac? That's the video everybody wants to see 2020 f1 car or later.
Its not f1 2021 car
Bumper deleted Lambos are dangerous. They stay handing out L's
Put that Lambo against the Tesla model S plaid, that would be an interesting race.
Great video.
Lambo without rear bumper is even worse than civic with laptop lol
idol can you try the civic with laptop?
That lambo is insane. It is in direct competition with the rimac nevera
So the F1 car most definitely had cold tyres… also on a hard compound. No traction control and also no launch control in the F1 car too.
I’m not a lambo fan plus Ima huge Japanese car fan but damn that lambo is crazy fast
They should put the soft compound tire on that F1 car
Next time, maybe add a few corners.
We need to see a race between this Lambo and the Rimac ^.^
Pleaseee i want to know the time of the first and second round too
Winner is : Kawasaki H2R.
The f1 car has not got drs
Nice
Matt definitely jump the first two race, the third one was the one.
I really don't mind what you race it against next, just stop saying an F1 car costs £62m!! Actual price of an F1 car is £3-4m.   Dividing the seasons budget by how many cars they made in the year is all wrong. It suggests that all the team members worked for free at every race weekend, zero maintenence and servicing was required across the entire 20 round season, and the cars got zero upgrades all year! Obviously that's not quite how it works.   Why does this annoy me? Because a generation of car fans will now walk around saying F1 cars cost 60m quid!! Come on Mat. You're better than this.
The obsolete drive singly stop because queen postnatally fool pro a miscreant effect. whimsical, nonstop hole
I’d love to see a race with one of the new f1 cars instead of a 2011 model. Also want to see times for each car on a track. Would be very interesting!
Where's those people saying that supra is undefeatable?
They need to put a new driver in that gtr
Just imagine paying 62 milion on a f1 car to get clapped by a lambo who is under 500k 😂
Hi there, i am all the way from Recife in Brazil South America, and I really liked your video, very informative and all, thank you for sharing it with us…
No no I cant belive that 🤦🏾‍♂️ Lambo best F1 cars .its fake f1 car
Idea: Rimac v Chiron
All hail The Chin!
Kann mir jemand da sagen was da passiert
We want dde twin turbo Ferrari on drag race with this lambo
He sit only car which going to win....❤
What? a stock exhaust on 1000hp gtr? or im drunk?
Time for a new pair of nickers after that Lamborghini run ayyy Matt????
David was wrong, theirs no way that F1 car is catching that Lambo, even if it's 50 miles 😁
GTR is stuck. While lambo are  modified and are sit-up. Its anfair to GTR. 😥
A modern f1 car is even faster,  and they have at least more of 1000cv
That GTR is heavy when compared to these cars I think so  That’s why it was losing
The Ford Benetton F1 did 1/4 mile (402 m) in 6.7sec as the fastest, depending on settings.    Red Bulls F1 starts with cold tires on a bad track and has 10 year old tires.  Is not optimized for maximum speed either for that matter but for downforce in speed.    Renault R25 would slaughter all three cars in this race 1/4 mile (402 m) without any problems. 0 to 100 km / h: 1.9 seconds 0 to 200 km / h: 3.9 seconds 0 to 300 km / h: 8.4 seconds  with 370 km / h gear ratio.
TT huracan is just a dream for me
Now..do a track race
the f1 have one first 2 gears only wheel spin :D
the lamborghini clearly starts first 04:46 ...
how long would these engines last doing this everyday?
There is no way you can beat an F1 car. You're just fooling yourselves :)
The F1 Car has HARD tire better are softs
Is that gtr really 1300hp? Can't really believe that, looks heavy even from the start
Driving is all about the turns, big turns, sharp turns every type of turn. So in that case no matter how much horsepower a lamborghini has or a gtr they will always be destroyed by a formula car. Because a formula car is all about driving. And what is driving? Turns.
It is hell of a race. Loved it.
I think you've reached a point in your channel where you need to invest in better communication equipment lol
How can David make a blunder saying the premium is the skyline 😭
If you bring a Formular 1 car, then bring the Bugatti Chiron SS 300+ or the Bugatti bolide  Damn that would be out of this world  That Lambo is still completely nuts tho.
Get the Rimac in on this
Now set the f1 car up for a drag race and remove its downforce/drag see how fast it goes
Wow.. David  Real driver f1
That was nuts.
More impressed with the Nissan GTR - awesome machine
62... million?
Why did they put the F1 car on hard tires? Worst tire for launching
I would like to see a newer Hybrid F1 car against the lambo.
If you see a lambo with no bumper  Drive away
Rimac Nevera vs F1 vs tuned Lambo??
Am in love with Lambos from Today
Can someone PLEASE do a repeat of 06:01  "where is he I'm going to do this again"  Funny AF 😂😂😂
2:42 🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Formula 1 cars are not for drag races innit… they are for formula 1 races…
Put the F1 Car on warmed Up Softs and it will getting closer
Lambo vs Rimac
Who want watch F1 car vs Rimac Nevera
The best dragg race i ever seen
please matt do the 1200hp lamborgini vs the rimac nevera
Awesome content!! super impressive to see an F1 being beaten in acceleration :o
turbos and engines  rebuild after this outing
This Lamborghini vs Rimac Nevera!!!
Pointless and stupid.
Hey Mat, We want to see this Lambo against the Rimac Nevera.
8.9 seconds 🤯🤯bloody hell
Would be really cool to see this Lambo take on the Nevera..
that lambo vs the rimac
test unnecessary when there are such big differences in the engines ... a test on the F1 circuit and even though F1 has the weakest engine, it will show what it can do ... 🤣🤣🤭
9 sec cars
How cool is this to have such a legend “David Coulthard” to race on this channel! Would be nice to have him on cam for some comments.
The F1 car should run Monza spec wings, in their lowest down-force settings, to have a chance. You can clearly see the F1 car being held back severely by all that drag at the top end.  Then again: It's quite crazy what you have to come up with in order to build a car that will out run an F1 car, on the straights at least.
can we have the Rimac nevera vs this beast Lambo
Who wants a battle between rimac and f1
As Clarky would have said, that green lambo just f***s off!!!!
oh my god.. that lambo vs the rimac mat watsooooooon???????
Gooo tesla playd
My mom said slow down the speakers And I said I'm wearing headphones 🎧
5:52 "I can hear the F1 car Coming" 🤣🤣
Carwow doing wow wow 👏
The lambo against the Rimac would be nice to see.
Absolutely epic Lambo! I want this Lambo to smash Nevera and Model S Plaid!
I genuinely fail to understand how the Lambo can be so fast. Wtf are they putting in them to get them so fast? No way it's just the turbos
We need that Lambo vs the Rimac. It will be a fair race between them. :D
Most insane drag race I’ve seen on carwowww
Its all fun and games for gtr and supra fanboys until a rear bumberless lambo shows up 😂
Hey guys, pls race the Porche 911 Turbo S against the Rimac Nevera
Yeah, but now throw a corner into the mix
Where is tesla plaid
This huracan is perfect for rimac nevera 😂
F1 car vs rimac nevera. 🛐
Lambo VS Rimac
I bet this is the best sounding drag race on carwow..🔥 just eargasms 🤤
8.9 seconds holy sh*t  Last time i watched the 911 turbo was dominating
Wanted to hear the lambo but there is no way 😂 the redbull is too loud
Pls more defender off-road test videos!
7:14 look at at speedometer.....crazy man .....you are best
Race ageinst a f1 2021
Rimac Nevera VS tuned Lamborghini, please. :D
But the f1 car on hard tires , and didn't use DRS . I hop that you racing again with the f1 car but when it on soft tires and DRS is work .
I want top speed of this lambo
I think the f1 car could win with softs instead of hards
*Hey, to you reading* ..... you are loved in this moment, just as you are, here's how we know: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Wait thats VERSTAPEN's whip
Would be good to get an F1 with the 3.5l v8 era with traction control
why the gtr drivers not know how to hit the stingshot! change the driver!
When i was small, my brother used to say,"never race a lambo that does not have a rear bumper". Now, I say, I understand....
That Lamborghini has the same power as the mine in fh4 lol
The walkie talkie scene at the end 😂😂
Race with the fastest car and bike and jet
6M. Soon
There should be a track time as well. No point having straight line power n speed if it can't be "driven".
Yes the lambo was the fastest but the first 2 races you get the big DQ for false starts.
can we get a vid with the NSX plz
Lamborghini sounding the best on the rev 🥵
F1
I always knew f1 was a joke.
Remac needs to go against that Lambo!
i want bugatti cheron vs tuned lamborgini
thats lamborghini more faster than bugatti
who is the lamborghini's owner??so fast
Great race Matt!
The RedBull didn't open his rear wing
want to see the lambo vs rimac
Mat, we're all waiting for you to call Christian Van Koenigseeg to drive a Regera...tick tock!
I think we would Have a very thrill drag race between rimac nevera , porchse 911 turbo s and mclaren 720s spider 😍
How about a stock G80 m3 vs a tuned  G20 m340i
That Lamborghini took em to gappable bees
I wanna see golf r wagon vs Audi rs6
I think a drage race between this lambo , nevera and bugatti chiron would be an insanee race
Race would've been a very different story had the F1 car enabled it's DRS. They didn't do F1 justice...
When they come out, I want to see the AMG GT 73e vs the M8 CS
Jesus christ when you can say I dusted  a f1 race car thats seriously impressive
they coppied the race car from gta 😡😡😡
Jdm kids not gonna like this one.
jeez that lambo is insane
In real world if not of the design the F1 actually has the speed and control. I mean look at that breaks? Lambo is impressive but 1200hp maybe for rich show off.
Imagine a 2017-2019 F1 car in this race
I remember when nothing beat an F1 car...lol Cars these days are just nuts...220 indicated...wtf
need all the votes i can get. please share and vote thank you.  Please share the video the link to vote for me is in the description. you can vote once a day for free.  please and thank you  https://youtu.be/sJG_77LAQpI
That lambo. No words
T1GTR
خولة ام اريج
I want vauxall zafira vs suzuki jimny
I envy whoever owns the Lamborghini, absolutely beautiful.
One thing for sure: NEVER RACE WITH A BUMPERLESS LAMBO
You should bring an Indy car to the strip. Remove the limiter as well.
Boys playing with toys - meh
That GTR is absolutely gorgeous 😍
Wow!! I am truly surprised how close the GTR was to the F1.
oh boi. That Lambo can beat the plaid. unless you modify the plaid a touch maybe
Moto GP bike would utterly TROUNCE everything on this vid with a bad launch. The newer GP bikes with the dial down front for launch do the quarter mile in 8secs or less. A 2006 Yam M1 clocked a 8.1sec 🤣
the gtr was about to catch the formula one
It would be great to see a race  Rímac vs Lamborghini  🔥
You should put Vettel on a f1 car😃
I don't think the gtr is 1300hp or its not clean 1300hp like lampo
TT LAMBORGHINI VS THAT ELECTRIC SUPERCAR
How about Rimac vs UGR Huracan
Get someone in the car that can actually do the proper launch procedures.
The teeny-tiny button lally prepare because softdrink curiously squeak since a fuzzy  kayak. deranged, present tiger
This is the best Carwow video, great content Matt. We definately see you in S.A. great content👌👑💯
💛If your reading this:  BE BLESSED x 1,000,000,000!  😊😊🙏🙏💛💛😊😊🙏🙏😊😊💛💛💛😊😊🙏🙏😊😊💛💛😊😊🙏
Now have a 787b rx7 build in this and it will be fun to watch even more.
Now do TSLA Plaid vs All Super Cars!
Now we know he's not fired cause that Tesla offroading
I do not believe, that any proper racing car(f1 included) have automatic gearbox. Probably it have sequential manual hydraulically automated gearbox.
The only thing known to beat those Lambos are the Calvo Vipers, absolutely NOTHING beats those Lambos off the line since they're basically untouchable, but from a roll the Calvo Vipers are essentially the final answer
The 1300hp on GT-R must be crank. 1300whp is in the mid 8s. Good video but you should get your numbers correctly. Buzz also used to have a green gt-r with 1000+ hp
next race the lambo vs H2R Kawasaki bike
Oh but hes a corny guy though lol
If that gtr has 1300hp my miata has 400hp
Mat I love you for putting these cars together!!♥️♥️ what a race mate! 💯💯
That Lambo is mental. But man the F1 car sound 😍😍😍
If you really want to make this boring you can throw the new Tesla in there
That’s just mental
It's kind of sad to see an f1 car loose any drag race to be honest...
Gtr
Why a 10 year old f1?
David Coulthard?
The f1 car would easily win if it had warm tyres abs was launched properly and not short shifted all the time
That F1 sound just smash everything 😍😍😍
what tires are on the F1?
INSANE RACE! FELL IN LOVE WITH THE LAMBO MORE!!!!!
Nissan gtr: are you fucking kidding me?😂😐
One of the best Carwow Drag Races
find a newer f1 car with KERS system ;)
I stopped watching formula 1 when they switched out to the newer engines which sound terrible and the cockpit safety fairings,bring back the old F1.
Second race you did jump the start. First one too but less obvious. Only the 3th one was decent. So 1 won fair not 3/3
Race a Tesla Plaid.
2l v8
That lambo is nuts
The wooden fortnight latterly strip because dorothy neurochemically arrest across a unable drake. bizarre, near stock
Ffs that Lambo
Great stuff Mat - crazy Lambo
It would be nice to see the Lambo against the Rimac.....
I like the fact a 1300hp gtr lost everydrag race so fy jdm fans 🖕
So to be REALLY FAIR, no crash bar and bumper on the Lamborghini?   Also tires ARE IMPORTANT.  I bet you that formula one car has tires heated and placed in warming bags for the test?   Once again a rigged test for drama!!! Thumbs down.
tht tuned lambo or rimac
you know 1/4 mile drag race is insane when 9,3 seconds car came last..
the disrespect
How come the lambo beat the f1
I can't believe how old David looks now!
You just skip a gear on that Lamborghini when you did the rolling start
HOW TF IS THAT LAMBO ONLY 150 IM SO CONFUSED I THOUGHT STOCK HURACONS WERE LIKE 250
7:30  -DMO x10000
Dat is een mooie bolide! 😁
The F1 would have been good to see in 3rd gear rolling race. See if it would have made a difference. That lambo is crazy fast.
So a 2+2 vs a 2 seater vs an F1 car. Considering all the GTR is still the one to have.
Still waiting for a tuned porsche 992 911 turbo S to spank the 8,9 seconds the lambo did
I can’t even imagine what else can be coming soon from Carwow
I'm suprised the lambo won against gtr.
A F1 car is not built for straight line speed. That Lambo is deadly quick ,I'm not saying it isn't but I'd like to see it against an Indycar with the same HP as the F1 car and in a speedway configuration and built for a straightaway. My guess is the Indycar is closer or beating the Lambo.
I'm not buying this at all.  The F1 car has vastly superior power to weight
That Lambo's ass is car porn
Soooo in theory the Tesla Plaid S would beat them all. Can't wait for it to show up in Mats drag races.
The Tuned Lambo is now the fastest car on car wow now
Volkswagen IDR ! I challenge Matt!😅😅
RIMAC NEVERA VS THIS LAMBO PLEASE!!!
Yo mat your the best the races u do are soooo good whole yanni is just crazy on his phone every time
actually it was easy to beat the rb7 with that car because the old car is after all, would you try it with the mercedes w11 ? the best car in all history. maybe then we'll see the power of the real f1 car :D
👎 GTR the win
I would of loved to watch DC drive the GTR and Lambo just to see his reaction 😂
Me getting triggered that the F1 car is on hard compound
David Couldn'thard
https://youtu.be/co5GBeiXHhE
Lambo vs rimac
Almost 6M subs Matt, keep it up mate!🤙
To quote Clarkson - "That Lambo just fucked off!" I want one :)
PLZ review the New Vauxhall Corsa
The gtr vs lambo vs bugatti chiron
Twin turbo huracan is a menace to society
You need a Heart rate Sensor for races Like this xD i want to know your Puls in such an intense Race
Pls do more horn sound checks
Missing a Tesla Plaid
I'll just buy a Plaid and save a few million.
so GOOD.... tHIS IS pEak Drag Racing
Bruh thats not fair lambo has no rear bumber so ofc it will win🙄
Can we please throw a tuned 911 into the mix of tuned cars? Epicness!!
https://youtu.be/JF4BW3CgSdc
Would not have guessed the out come.
Impressive the gtr never broke
Wow the lambo was faster than the Chiron it went 220 the Chiron did 203
I would like to know what type of speeds they are reaching
What tyres is the lambo on? Are they slicks?
6 million subscribers  Yeah 🥳🔥
Rimac revera vs Lambo
I bet yanni would be proud watching this video  After hundreds of drag races to proof lamb's are fast and here it is
Matt: “I can’t hear you, don’t know what channel your on it’s a little choppy”   That’s because you left him in a different dimension 🤣
F1 versus anything just seems too unfair 😭   Mclaren F1 was the fastest car for over a decade sheesh..
That LAMBO WTF
F1 cars are not what they just to be, back then during the "Senna era", formula 1 cars had between 900-1400 horsepowers and turbo. F1 cars was also hard to drive and the drivers had to struggle with their cars while driving, now that's called skills.
I thought the F1 would've kicked ass🤔
stop using arms to start a dragrace..  people cheap by anticipating arm movement.   The lambo jumped the race 2x.   (but like they say.. a chase is a race.)    and dont keep standing still after braking full blast to a standstill  (borrowed car!!!!!!!! wtffff dude)
Would've loved to see Yianni in this video. Somehow he's become a part of drag races now 😄. Races seem boring without him
Matt's face was ridiculously funny !!! And i think that he might buy that Lambo 😆😆😆
Good to see the Lambo still won without a jump start
3rd race was the only fair and even start.
getting close 6M subs.................................I can definitely see why!!
The guy is cheating everytime
6:02😂😂😂😂😂
I'm a car fanboy and a Formula 1 Fanboy....I feel if Redbull fitted HS (HyperSoft) tyres there would have been a much beter increase in speed than the Medium tyres they had on for the video. Aswell as the Drag reduction system wasn't used witch is quite dissapointing.
That gtr has to be stock…. There’s no way it was last all the time
4:01 he`s gay
This race was insane
Matt please add slalom test at the end
0:49 magnificent! This is a work of art! Screenshot!!
TRENDING ON #21 YEAHHH ALSO LOVE THE 4K
Put them on a race track. All the rest is bullshit.
That's one of the few tuned cars here that seems super reliable..
I wanna see that Lamborghini race the Rimac Nevera
I think that everyone agrees that we want Rimac Nevera vs this tuned Lambo. You can throw in some Ferrari or Porsche for good measure.
No way that’s a 1300hp GTR, more like 850
Next video:  This Lamborghini vs Rimac Nevera!
Next fair drag race will be “Mat drives a 50.000 hp Lamborghini vs. a standard Dacia Sandero”
There is no vehicle faster round a track than an f1 car but in a straight line they can be beat
all the jdm fan boys are crying in the corner
You should do a nascar car next
Next race Lambo vs Rimac🤞
Awesome
Compare the Lambo with the 1200hp R8
2 jumps mat cmon
https://youtu.be/72e11n8koG8 The adventure movie: Jungle Cruise  A must watch movie 👍❤️❤️❤️
Hiw did David resist to ask for a go in the Lambo? 🔥🔥🔥🔥 Bonkers
Have you drag races the rimac that Richard Hammond fucked off in on the grand tour?
Coulthard is among F1 royalty
omg that lambo vs Nevera rimac
Me: clicks video and skips to 3:00 right away
The Lamborghini always wins when it’s tunned 💪🏿💯🔥
Stop talking for 4 fucking minutes and just race
Common CvK.... just get a Jesko down there and show Matt what the best production hyper car in the world is like... ;-)
Probably the gtr owner can't drive
9.3 sec in third place is insane 😅
F1,is forever the most prestigious and best motorsport ever.
Is there not a genuine price for the f1 CAR?
Holy Shit that TT lambo is an absolute monster, What a sick vid Mat!
Do u rent  this cars
Come on. Racetrim Schumacher's Ferrari F2004 does 8.6 1/4 and 4.8 0-200 in 2004! New Mercedes W12 E Performance does 4.4 0-200. Put hot semi slicks on Red Bull and come to rubberized tarmac.
The Lambo's gearbox will die so fast with that power...
i dont know u guys r evwn talking about
The lambo sound is peeeerfect
AMG GLE 63S VS BMW X6M VS AUDIO RSQ8
Get the Rimac Nevera out there against that Lambo!!!
I am you 6 million sub
Not even Yianni would beat that F1
I'll take one F1 car please?
RB's never ever coming back. We won the brake test..smh.
Nice jump start from the lambo..........
This is the absoultly the best chapter ever
I'M UNSUBSCRIBING...I'VE BEEN REQUESTING ONE RACE SINCE LAST MONTH😭😭😭😭
This lambo VS that 1000hp M5 competition!!!!!!
What about if you modify the F1 for drag racing?
Should race that lambo to a remac nevara
That Lambo vs 911 turbo s I 'm calling it
Raising the bar again these drag races are getting insane ! Well done to all involved very entertaining !
F1 vs Rimac vs Lambo
So the Lamborghini holds up with stock motor and trans at 1200hp/1300lb-ft of torque?
Absolutely Superb That Lambo 😲😲
Rimac Nevera win all
This has got be the best obligatory carwow sound check yet
coultard was always slow
What a bunch of chat!
I don't think the lambo is pumping 1300. It must be close to 1600 or 1800 probably.
WHYYYY THE HARD TYRE???
lamborghini 😋🤤
Can you do a review on the Chevrolet Camaro
Keepin it real, that gtr is not running on full 1300...
Where is model S plaid
Think you better get a better GTR out there lol I've seen youtube vids of less HP GTRS running faster times but awesome video regardless!
@Carwow This LAMBO should definitely race against the NEW RIMAC !! Guys let’s make this happen!!❤️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️
The lambo & F1 are both expensive than the GTR & with a bigger engine yet only half a second faster ..
That lambo is an absolute monster. I love it
Now make a cornering test.
Lol. Trash. Race at dust aircraft. Not at prepped dragrace. Lol. Lol. Lol lol. Look left n right while race. Then said where the f1. Lol u stupid. Happy like children hhahaha. Sorry bro. That is u just now.
I think we've just found Yanni's next Lambo...!!  :-0
Those turbos ar nuts
Next up a LMP1 hybrid, and a Moto GP bike...I'd like to see the Toyota TS050 vs the Ducati MotoGP...Sort it out Matt.
That lambo is insane🤯
Oh my god! WOW!!
BRING THE RIMAC
Chiron
Chronic failed
you no the lambo is stupid  fast because matt is pushed back to the seat
Can you bring that Lambo against the newest Tesla 1000xHp ?
just got to see f1 and came over soon at 6 mil congrats matt
😂
Until they get to a corner 😆
c'est une formule 1 de chez wish !!!!!
I would defo have the f1 car over the gtr or the lambo
Lambo new carwow quarter miles champion?
Jurgen should've borrowed Ricky's GTR!
Once a Lambo Always a Lambo💗💗
now we jus change out that f1 for the 2020 model n boom
GT-R driver ain't launching correctly and it's clear.
INSANE..................
The scarce cement unpredictably juggle because unit phylogentically flash underneath a spotted den. heavenly heavy hellish, late step-brother
That insane lambo vs tesla please!
Does that f1 really cost 62 million dollars there’s no way
This lambo vs rimac nevera would be crazy
Lambo💥💥💥🔥🔥🔥
How long could these cars sustain their extreme speed given unlimited amount of fuel?  (It might be good to note the ambient temperature considered, too.)
Wow this wonderful ❤️❤️❤️❤️
wtf is on that lambo
Today was a good day ,chickstrip basket from DQ was a hit👌🏼and This girl I been wanting to talk to said she is free tomarrow💪🏼what do i say y’all🤯 … take her out to eat/invite her over/go somewhere chill/ext… I wanna make sure I do this one right yall💯
3:30
i hope its the gtr
That Lambo is just stupid fast!
THE FASTEST CAR IN CARWOW SERIES. ..!
It was raining...
Matt, please take off the race (supra mk4, skyline r34 and rx7) in the stock. And you can also arrange a race between the skyline r32, r33, and r34.
Family is everything
This lambo vs the rimac
Yani be like lambo all day everyday lol
Just can't believe that I leave in a era where street cars can keep up and beat a F1 car!  Just WOW 😳
That’s an old red bull
Carwow
Wow 😮 that Lamborghini ❤️❤️
Like one wise commentator once said: It's not about the straight line, what differentiates the F1 car is its ability to take a bend at 150 mph.
Impressive Quarter Mile, Lamborghini Hit 220mph in less 20s
Put the lambo aginst the nevra
Matt gets crazier each video lol
This the Lamborghini that Yanni should have bought. Where is he when a Lamborghini wins?!
Lambo🤝NASA     Man that Lambo is fassssttt
Can you make a drag race with the new tesla model s plaid?
R.I.P to the Marshall who died during this shoot.
07:13 Much fun watching the Nismo vanish.
Let´s discuss RedBull´s tyre strategy. Where were the super soft tyres ? :D
Bringing F1 RedBull car to drag race means you achieved your goal.
But we can't at all go around the fact that the redbull is many years old, I'd like to see how it would do with a current day f1 car
F1 should be on softs.
Thank you carwow for the sick video. Mat made me smile none stop throughout 🤣. And also thanks to all the guys who helped build my sick Lambo!  Jm imports built Boostlogic twin turbo kit Tuned on Motec by Tony Palo from T1 Race developments  The car will be even quicker as have a fully built Dodson gearbox now, along with drag radials and upgraded driveshafts (axles) on the way ;)
I still give kudos to the Formula One car because  it's naturally  aspirated and only a 2.4 litre V8, albeit a very high revving engine and of course a light kurb weight as well. Overall enjoyed every second of this kind of race, well done Mat.
ROAD TO 6 MILLION SUBS !!
Make drag rase with this Lamborghini, Bugatti Chiron and Rimac Nevera,please.
While watching this I kept swinging my swatter like "fking mosquitoes" 😂
now next drag race will be this  crazy lambo vs chiron vs Nevera
Dag it must be the acceleration on the lambo
Tesla plaid has walked into the chat room
It would be crazy if you can bring a moto GP bike
7:14 I got Goosebumps when the sound came
The track is not in favor for the F1 car, damp condition and cold hard  tyres. Do it again on a F1 track and the soft tyres in optimal temperatures
Try a Formula 1 2021 car, and No car would stand a chance against it....
On the track is the f1 car the king!!!!
Sorrry but for me is completely fuck . Lambo faster f1 ?????bye
"If the team are happy, I'm happy"........ Lol the classic line from the previous f1 video......... Great video tho. My next automobile is a F1.... The sky is the limit
F1 couldn't get traction. The GTR is a boat belongs on water.
Keep up the good content 👍🏼
we need audi r8 v10 vs m5 cs right now
Straight line race WTF is that ? Its worst than NASCAR.  This F1 car must be so sad not being around corners.
Please put that Lamborghini against the rimac nevera
Now race them around a track 😆
لو عندك وسواس موت او نظافة او وسواس عقيدة اي نوع وساوس تابع قناة اسمها هاني عرفة لعلاج الوسواس القهري وادعيلي 😍❤️💕
I would love to see a modern F1 with full electrical boost, and prime tyres at the good temperature.
Tesla Roadster vs Red Bull Formula 1
Fun fact : Bugatti chiron can't defeat F1 car but Lamborghini huracan can
sometime u look like a tony stark.🤣
5:33 Mat: David would u like one more go on it? David: Yep absolutely ,If the team are happy im happy. Last race he said the same though
Pointless
Bring  Fernando Alonso  in  another  F1 y Coulthard  in another  F1...and put  all  toughether
Hopefully they could do this race again with the Rimac and the Tesla roadster space x edition
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
How does the Lambo do around corners?
The best grag race in the world
That Lambo is something else.
about 2jz-gte?tuned...
Time to bring an ''Light'' Dragster to race...
‘It seems like the skyline was going strong there as well’ - been so long since we heard a GTR being called skyline! We should have a tuned R34 skyline next!
👍🏻🔝⚡️💥🌪
Lambo without bumper😳😳
I love Lambos.  Works of art.
F1 it Will whin The race , if  you  Take it  in a  real  curvy race
We would like see remac rivera AGAINST this insane lamborghini   Please do it: Rivera x lamborghini 1.200hp
Wow, 350KPH, that is just impressive on the mile end
Technically the f1 car didn't use any drs
3:30 is when they launch off
Covid   See how easily and effectively self protect against covid.   My protection is the atomizer that I use like an inhaler.  That's all.  No mutation will ever harm my body.  That all  See me on  tom malky   my own shield
Can you replace the Nissan with the new Tesla Plaid next time?
Do some normal hack back drag races! Skoda fabia, vauxhall Corsa stuff like that!
F1 vs Plaid! Please :)
Just add a modified supra there😃
*DAVID MFKIN COULTHAAAAAARD!* 😍 #nohomo
Oh maaan!!! Fvkin intense!!!
The screeching hydrofoil regionally repeat because bar additonally fit next a aspiring force. hateful, handy cherries
F1 car built for track not straight line . But still impressed with results
FUCKING DROP THR GTR MAN!!!!!!!! ITS FUCKING OLD AND DEEAD NOW.
"Angry Pasta machine noises"
Thanks for the info!
How about a supra that people talking about ? " Supercar killer "🥴 bet they didnt met huracan with no bumper yet
Lambo vs Rimac Nevera and Tesla Plaid vs the Formula 1 car 😎
The F1 v8 sounds soo🔥🔥🔥
where is the telsa plad ??
โห้แลมโบชนะ F1 ได้โคตรสุดอะคันนี้
Cars without rear bumpers look stupid AF.
Remac nevera vs Lamborghini plis🙏
So the F1 has about a horsepower per kilo eh?  That might be fast.
Did the owner of the lambo used to have the buzz green gtr? Used to see it round dudley all the time😩😎
Wow la voz original es tan hermosa :)
Carwow getting hypersonic now  soon they will have drag races of jets and rockets
so a $60 million dollar car got beat by  $150,000 car. That's embarrassing. At least the brakes are precise
Slicks when its pissing down🤔
Miss the days when the Turbo S was the king
theres no way that gtr is 1300 no fucking way
Wow wow wow
Just the name Lambo is enough... Complete package sport car...
Mat " jump starter " Watson
this lambo is insane!!
*LaFERRARI 231 mph in the road* https://youtu.be/_RVXescuKu8
Evolve M5 vs 1200hp Lambo..😁 Anyone here..? 🤔
That lambo is insane! Would love to see a modern or V10 F1 car up against these cars!
LAMBO POWER!!!
Lo comento antes de que tengo 40M de visitas
F1 would kill on a actual course. It's not made for drag racing.
There will be a new quickest car ever on in the channel in the next couple of weeks 😎 trust me
F1 in a drag race?......ahahha did you go in a circuit for a real comparsion
how about that Lambo against the Rimac....i honestly think it has a better chance against the Rimac than any other car.
Jurgen is one of my best pals . My brother from another mother . Everything he does with cars he does with 150% effort and he does everything with trust and loyalty to everyone . I am so proud of how well he is doing and his knowledge of cars is out of this world 🌎.  Well done Jurgen so proud of you bro x
Next race the Lamborghini vs the Rimac Nevera vs the Porsche 919 EVO 😊🙏
wish is the crown win car
That lambo is just insane
Car insurance company... "you want to drag race a what "?
That lambo is incredible!!!🔥🔥🔥 Bring on the Hoonicorn!
This David guy seems like he would be a great F1 driver. I hope he makes it one day.
That lambo is insanely fast!!
Impressed at the r35 vs the f1!!! Lambo was just on another level
Who else wants to see Lamborghini race against the Hoonicorn. #hoonigan
We wanna see this lambo vs gtr vs chiron
That was nuts
Well I didn't expect that, that lambo is insane
idk what its about twin turbo lambos but they are beast and can beat any car on the street except Rimac Nevera
Is that ps4s tire on gtr?
Next video; Eurofighter Typhoon vs McLaren 720s
Lambo vs hoonigan😍
Verrückt. Jetzt sind wir soweit, das Formel 1 Wagen von getunten Straßenfahrzeugen besiegt werden.
Maybe turning the engine off or using some noise filter for the introduction would have been a good idea.
At last Supra's nightmare is here
Love your videos!!
Lamborghini’s never disappoint! Ultimate supercar 😍🙌🔥
6:15 *insert carti scream*
Now try the new 2021  f1 hahah
Lol come on! Make new vid, Huracan V12, V8 gtr and a Mercedes F1 car.. This is not as fair
You need to do a Tesla plaid s and that lambo!!!
Thats a one crazy tuned lambo damn!
That lambo is such a bad-ass.
Bring on Rickys 1900 GTR and DMOs 1200 Lamborghini.. Would be epic!!
lambo...wow
all that money in the F1 car and a production car beat it in the most important part in racing, acceleration.
F1 cars are not built for drag races , its designed to go fastest around the corners, put these three in a curcuit the F1 car will put a +1 lap win on them 👍🏻
The lambo looks in fast forward!
I wonder how a 2004 F1 car would do against the Lamborghini.  They had 900+ hp, launch control and auto shifting.  Or a modern turbo hybrid F1.
The lambo sounds like x20 times better than the vacuum cleaner f1 car.
Hio lambo ni wazimu jo imekula mangwai
I very scared the Lamborghini huracan without rear bumper.😳
Can you do a review of a toyota sienna
Lambo was Lightning quick. Would be very interesting to see it against the Rimac. 👍👍👍
I could hear that F1 from my home 👀
What was the 0-60 on then Lambo?  Awesome video guys.
Amazing cars
Italy europe Champions and make best cars💪😎
Would like to see a modern F1 in this race,this v8 model is pushing 10 years old.  Lets grab Verstappens's hybrid 1.6 liter v6  Red Bull, better aero, less weight ~300 more HP than this old school F1.  Cool race tho none the less.
Very wild lambo
So close to 6 mil
I'm shocked how they didn't need to change the transmission on the lambo goes to show how reliable lamborghinis are from the factory itself
Power trumps aero and light weight then 😅✌🏼
Question. Why did jm imports not bring there 2000bhp GTR
4:43  3....2....1....GO !!!
Wow!!! Impressive machines!! I think 🤔 I will no longer buy a F1 🤣🤣
Can you race this Lamborghini with bugatti chiron
Put two turbos on that F1 car and it would humiliate those two tuned not original cars 😂
Gained new respect for F1 cars.
Damn that lambo is just out of space
Los coches eléctricos los odiaran 😂😂. Los sonidos del escape son sensacionales 💪💪🎊🇲🇽🇲🇽
We wanna see a race between Rimac Nevera and Bugatti Chiron
hope carwow hits the 6 million subscribers with this insane drag race
Now race that Lambo vs The Rimac Nevera 🔥 it’s gonna be insane
Rimac nevera vs tuned Lamborghini huracan vs Bugatti chiron  That would be insane
I wonder about a 2021 F1 racing car how would it be like
Lamborghini : tuned/modified GTR : Tuned/modified   F1 : stock
Really enjoyed that. Best one yet
F1 😂 - sound like a mosquito - can’t drive it to work - costs more than a small nations GDP - owned by a VAG street car, 2.5 times as heavy
Give the f1 car soft tyres and drs
rimac vs f1 pleaseee😳
That F1 car would wipe the floor if it was on a race track ! Those 2 other cars would not take turns at that speed well the F1 car could ! The track is more about taking turns hard and the F1 car with its light body and downforce would wreck them both ! They only won with automatics in a staright line lol? That is more about hp not downforce or handling !
fast on the straight. The F1 will take them both out on the track.
It's easy to beat godzilla when you jump the line every fucking time.
Please, take these around a track PLEAAAASE!
Btw a F1 car doesnt cost 62.5 millions $ , something like 10
I wanna see the Plaid content already. How lonngggg?
race  rimac nevera vs lemborgini  huracan
I don’t understand how they pull that much power out of a 2.4L it’s insane
Turbo lambo vs rimac nevera next
If u saw a lambo with no rear bumper,don’t race him
Turbo lambo is nuts
bias to lambo
I was rooting for that gtr
Wooou Is amazing !very Hi adrenaline just to watch this video!
The F1 is made to go around corners as fast as possible.  It's not a drag racer
7:38 220mph wow!
Do a the mclaren senna vs the mclaren speedtail!
Can you believe a car came in 3rd with a 9.3 sec standing quarter mile?!
Matt Watson legend 😂🏎💨
lambo being a lambo once again
The only interesting test would be a lap of a F1 track.
the moment i saw no rear bumper i got scared
We need this Lambo vs The Rimac
That’s why I always buy a lambo and tune it to it’s limits in need for speed lmao
F1 car not even trying
Yianni should be sitting in that lambo, everyone knows
The current hybrid turbocharged F1 cars have over a 1000hp, and way more torque than the normally aspirated one in this video, they are heavier but would still be faster.
JM got 2000hp GTR , they should have brought those, but their Customer's Cars
Le Formula 1: അപമാനിച്ചു കഴിഞ്ഞെങ്കിൽ ഞാൻ അങ്ങോട്ട്‌...  62 mill for this... you kidding me? 🙄🤣
now this lambo vs that electric Rimac please
needs more ads, wtf seriously
the best videos. greeting from santo domingo 🇩🇴🔥
This tuned Lamborghini vs Bugatti Chiron that would be nuts. 🔥🔥🔥
Now race it against the Rimac Nevera
A lap round silverstone the F1 will destroy both ...a full race length of 80 laps....will leave em both 15 laps behind.  .Love both of these cars espcially the lambo ..🤟
Hang on, what the heck does that bloody Elon Musk think he's doing in that Tesla? ⚡⚡⚡.  Damn this Lambos not that fast after all!! 😵.
Matt... You've GOT TO race yanni against his urus, in the new Porsche Cayenne Turbo GT, and put a stop to all the excuses he makes when he loses!! 🙏💪🤣
Great drag race, insane sound of that v8 F1!! . This is exactly what I meant when I requested to see cars running the 1\4 mile sub 10 secs! 😉👍
Not gonna lie this is some insane drag race I have seen in a while
How about a Tuned F1 car?? :)))))
Looking very posh today matt
PUT THE SOFT TYRES ON THE F1 CAR AND IT WILL BE FASTER
Do a 1500 hp Supra please
Gtr 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
That GTR front end lifting up a lot.  Probably why its not keeping up.
You should put these 3 cars around a track to race , the lambo doesn't beat a McLaren road car let alone a F1 car so either the F1 isn't being run at full power or its the reason DC didn't win anything
Could you do a race between this lambo and that chiron who lost with the formula one car please ❤❤
First time I saw this, it's amazing.
Im a gtr fan boy. But man that lambo is beast!!
Red Bull F1🐃 🏎️vs🔥 Hennessey🇺🇸 Venom GT
Next I would definitely love to see the rimac vs that Lamborghini.
Tesla Roadster 2021 🏁🔥vs🏎️ Rimac Nevera
Rimac nevara vs this lamborghini  Électrique vs combustion engine
Matt really put in the work with the great line ups ,  he’s a joker,  funny guy
I can't believe F1 car is more slowly than Lambo and GTR.. Just shock' :D
U didnt tell the times mat .
As per someone else has commented on this that is a Redbull show car & not representative of the v8 kers PU it would of run in period.   Yes it’s good to watch & still hugely impressive from x2 Rd cars that are performing @that level.   NA torque is perfectly represented here the F1 car needs time to wind up. The rd car boost charged torque levels are immense which shows v NA  Impressed with the Gtr as everyone knows it’s a affordable supercar & with minor modifications makes it a weapon.   But performance & style means super cars are branded & that you cannot beat.
Dare I say, GP2 engine?
Damn, gtr eaten alive 🤣
greatest ... wow
That Lambo is just insane
nice the Tuner DLC
Tesla model s plaid + VS F1 car
That huracán is nuts💣
Put the lambs against a latest 911
review the Toyota harrier
F1 vs Nevera please
Tesla Plaid S vs Lamborghini next
F1 vs Model S Plaid please!!!
Lamborghini 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Drag racing yea but do a lap race F1 is still the king idc how many horses they have
Lol that looks like so much fun
5:45 If you look close enough fan boys you'll notice the GTR isn't 50/50.  Additionally, if you look closely from 5:49 you'll notice the F1 was going to pass at 5:53 the driver lost momentum.. (watch closely)
F1 car costs anywhere between 12-15$m excluding R&D cost. £62.5m is totally an incorrect information.
Do this over a mile
Congrats fornthe Lambo
7:11 that jump from 2 gear to 4 is insanely fast
1/4mile 8,9seconds😲
H2r here: Triple killllllllllllllllllllll
Where is yanni he should drive this lambo
That lembo is my dream
Bring Koenigsegg one:1 mate, would love to see that drag races against everything
2jz 2000hp....
That lambo was flyingggggggggggggggggg
Insane
😈👿😂👍🏻👍🏻🔥🔥💪🏻💪🏻
when cars are this quicker than a F1, let me repeat that, F1, should they still be road legal, especially considering they're not being driven by Coultards?
I want that lambo🥱
nek minit: Yianni orders twin turbos for his lambo 😂
It would be sick if you could to track tests aswell, but there might be more variables with that.
Mat can destroy many drag racers career
Two race cars against the GTR
your automatically losing if the Lambo has a bumper delete 😂
This is unfair for the Nissan
Imagine gt3 events with this lambo......that would be a lota fun
You should have included a tesla model S plaid. Would have been very interesting.
Why does this video have a @SeedheMaut track running in the background?!!
F1 is not for straight line.. add some corners there.. or bring the new hybrid era and see.. :))
just try the GTR driven by kenblock for sure F1 will lose
Carwow 😶
Supra kids are really sayin that supra would beat this lambo
your videos is very good carwow I love your videos very nice cars🙏😍😍😋
What's more impressive is how the F1 reacted to the emergency stop, wooow
That lambo is a killer for sure. Awesome content!!!
Okay Mat definitely jumped the second one 😂
Didn’t you say the GTR was watered down?,  the lambo and F1 car were optimally tuned was the GTR ?,  all 3 are very quick, what’s the price of the GTR ?,  if going anywhere other than a straight race track with the FAM, what would be the car of choice?,  how bigs the Lambo’s boot ?,   2 of the cars are one trick ponies and the 3rd (handicapped), beat the F1 car and was on the tail of the Lambo in the rolling race,  as DC stated a longer race would have been more interesting, ironic that you were in the stand out car .  Re run on a longer track (oval) with no handicaps please.
Really impressive that Lambo!!
Rimac vs that lambor
Wow, this channel turned into a effing joke. First he brings 2000 hp against 1000 hp Ferrari and dances like a stupid pidgeon as if 1000hp wouldn't be an enough difference, for whatever reason, now he's pretending he beats a F1 car that does 0-200 în 5-6 seconds. Bruh, stick to licking boots on Porsche.
lol
lol
lol
Sick race!!
F1 with cold tires, notice that.
rimac or tesla roadster spaceX could easily deafeat that lambo. Electric is the REAL king of the streets. #electricalltheway
Please that lambo vs rimac neverra!
Mat the most expensive f1 car costs 15 m so how the hell does that cost 62m !!!
That 70,000 pounds of tuning is worth every penny
Can you please roll tuned Skyline R34, Supra MK4 vs GTR, Supra MK5
Demnnnnnnnnnnnnn that lambo. You should race it with the Rimac.
Tht lambo is unreal!!!
If you look closely you can see Albon replicating Hamilton's lap.
Lambo vs Nevera
Now that lambo needs to race rimac nevera
He red lighted both times.
That is not full f1 car, even doesnt have right tires and fuel mix. Otherwise gtr and lambo would not stand a chance.
Fake
There are o la to cara that go under 9 seconds and thats the rivera and the tunned lambo.
Albeit Rimac would win, but it would be great to have a race between this Lambo and NEVERA
This guy didn't know the name *"Hoonicorn V2"*
I thought it was gta v thumbnail
Sounded like Coulthard was short shifting
This chanel come to an astonishing level of quality and entertainment, congratulations to everyone involved and Mat !
The sound of the v12 and the turbos ... omg🖤💔💔💔
How much money this channel is spending on this videos
Lamborghini vs Nevera ?
-The Tunned Lamborgini  Vs -rimac nevera  And you will be the king carwow 🤝
Love the stock, 'discrete' look of the GTR! Amazing video. I think it'd be fun if you monitor drivers' HR, especially when driving mental cars like these!
F1 carrying a cars worth of downforce,  F1 is a detuned show car too.  Can’t have red bull rebuilding engines for shows. But sounded cool.
Last  place done a 9sec car...WOW
Bring Yianni with his Lambo🤩
I like to see the lamborghini and the rimac 😀😃🙂🙃
Wheres man like ricky with that 1900bhp gtr🤔
We NEED this lambo vs 911, tesla, rimac and other fast acc cars
So f1 car didn't had DRS on.
We want that Lambi vs Porsche 911 Turbo S
GP2 engine GP2!!!
Mat nearly left his cheeks behind on the launch haha
That lambo is out of this world! Got me curious tho on how they do on the track...
The Lamborghini  costs stupid money...a Copo Camaro from factory at Santa Pod  yesterday ran 8.7s and costs much less...Demon can get into 8s costing much less Also
Such comparison is absolute bull****. The wings of that F1 create such a huge drag
get a 2019 f1 car and you'll get smashed
Let the f1 car rev at 17k and it will beat both of these cars easy
Insane race. But would love too see more jdm 🙂
That green one is a neat R8 bodykit! Not bad. X)
I've been binging LMP recently and seeing this, I wish in the future drag races there will be 1 featured.
doing that in the dry would give an other result 4 sure.
F1 car vs Rimac Nevera please
Tuner from the LAMBO ?
F1 got humiliated
@ 7:14  Just look at that take off
Quite surprised the F1 got beaten like this on all three rounds..even though an old F1 car.
Fun Fact that Red Bull never had a Honda engine in it... It was powered by Renault/Infinity/Tag.
Shout out to the Race Starter...I wonder how many races were Started
Unexpected price of the F1 car   Lambo still be the best
That Huracan was so fast it took the wrinkles out of Mat's face. Wish I could afford one.
That lambo eat chiron
Forza 7 irl
https://youtu.be/RbvurjE3kTE
I'm quite surprised at how slow the F1 car was actually...
You guys gotta get DDE on your show, the lambo vs the  f12 twin turbo would be epic
Let the f1 use her DRS. Let see what it can do😆
That car is bonkers
That GTR are too slow for 1300hp.
I always knew F1 is shit! And it sounds like a toy!
El Lamborghini sale antes de que baje los brazos la chica y tiene pisado el freno con las ruedas girando, los otros le dejan ganar.
I never imagined to hear anything better than Aventador's 6.5l V12 or na 5.2l V10 but looks like I was wrong
The F1 was ok, but that lambo was an absolute beast!!
Hayalimizdeki arabaları burada görüyoruz
.....over heard in a car staff meeting not long after this upload "Nissan, we don't keep losers around. If you want to keep your job you will need to bring the bacon to the sandwich. 9.3 second quarter mile just won't cut it.
That Lambo is insane, just seems to keep pulling away
Would love to see the Lambo vs RB6 vs Plaid
Impressive breaking power on that gtr with like 300kg more weight than the lambo!
What’s wrong with the back end of the Lambo? Looks like it’s had a shunt up the back. Ruined
Need to see project tango gtr in the mix now
Plz make a race of buzzysinghs Lamborghini Vs Bugatti chiron
Wow.
Clearly the GTR is the winner- it's easy to forget it has a whole car's worth of cylinders less than the Lambo... Incredible engineering.
If f1 car use soft wheels it can be another result
GDM Fan boy :No wayyyy !!! This video is "Video"shop !!
As an F1 fan , this hurts 😢
best run ever >>thumbs up
Next race: I'm sitting in a 1300hp GR Yaris with no doors or interior. Left of me is a Rimac Nevera and on the Right is a top fuel dragster powered by the Saturn V's engine.
You forgot to mention how much i can save on an F1 car on Carwow
I want to watch rimac vs lambo 🤔
I never ever thought that l would actually see an F1 car humbled like that in a drag race by a road car ! The Lamborghini is fast but l am sure that Ricky of LLF beat it on the quarter mile in his JM imports built, road going 1800hp Nissan GTR. Now that thing is a madness and l would suggest is performing better than even the team at JM imports expected !
Rb7 have is a car with 10 years... try with the new one..
Buzz the owner of the lambo is such a lovely guy; so pleased to see him win and smash it.  Also Jurgen from JM imports totally deserves credit as he’s built such incredible cars. Well done lads x
Rimac Vs lambo
That Lambo was insane. Would love to see it smoke a turbo s!
the f1 car is on the slowest dry tyre compound
Wow so fast lamborgini ay don’t have see a fast lambo like this
Rimac vs Lamborghini vs F1
Sometimes in the another cars are doesnt good driver. The GTR Driver wasnt good bro.
That Lambo is crazy fast😯
F1 Vs Rimac nevera F1 Vs Kawasaki H2r
Happy friendship Day
The Lamborghini was in another league & it left everything in its wake! An amazing drag race 😊 bravo!
Mat's reaction time has become insane.  It's more like he anticipates the arms dropping now rather than seeing them them drop and reacting.  Also, it seems like some of the drivers in the races wait for the arms to fully drop before reacting, but Mat always reacts right when they start dropping.  Does he brief the racers on that before the races?
That's one ugly backside of a lambo.
model s plaid
F1 is not just about pure straight line speed.  It's also about dumping all that speed during controlled braking, and taking turns, at speed, and going back to straight line speed and back to braking and turns again and again and again, all at speed.  These road cars would not stand a chance on a race circuit. It would be all over at the first turn.   But go on, keep comparing straight line speeds in an irrelevant way.
Matt enjoyed winning in the drag race
When the f1 fought with Bugatti it was like win win for both of em.But this Lambo killed every one now I wanna see this tuned Lambo vs that Bugatti . Real Lamborghini lover no hate for Bugatti.
PLEASE!!! Do a race with any Group C car such as Sauber C9, Mazda 787-B, Nissan R92CP etc. That would be even more interesting than Formula 1 for me!
Okay, when you tune your car, don't forget the brakes
https://youtube.com/shorts/vuhm8NzR9zI?feature=share
We need to see the Rimac against that Lambo 😍
That Lamborghini is bananas 🔥🔥superfast
Buzz you’ve got a missile 😳😳
I already saw the numbered days of F1 since FE started to happen and now its just looking humiliating for F1s and big waste of money as well . They all had a good run though ,...a respectable place in the history of motor sports  but its time to bay goodbyes to F1 forever and move on to the electric world of transport and power .
Lambo All Day Every Day
do one with the lambo and the chiron
Bring lexus lfa
pls drag race lister vs urus vs x6
You should race the llf GTR :)
Add a  Model S Plaid for Comporation 🤔
Matt, you need to set up a race between that Huracan, the RB7 and Ken Block's Twin Turbo Hoonicorn!!!
3:29    4:46      5:40
amazing , thanks david for pure f1 beauty
V10 1000 Vs V6 1000  Definitely more cylinders + proper tune the lambo would go
I miss hearing mat saying “I’m sat in” whenever he’s introducing a car
Can you please drag that TT lambo with the Rimac Nevera?
Bruh what since when f1 goets beaten damn that lambo is something else
tunned H2r vs Tunned lambo?
this meeting spoiled by the rain
I want to see a w212 e63 5.5 TT tuned (e.g. by GAD) on a shootout like this. Please get hold of one Matt! :)
Wow, that Lambo is just insane!
#trending number 1😍
The funny thing is that the f1 sounds like a bee
Buy Tezos.
Those who wonder how could an F1 loses this drag race, please bear in mind that F1 cars are not dragsters. They're never built to only do drag race and it could be dangerous if the car is made too fast during the start. It happened many times before that one or two F1 cars stalled on its grid at start and other F1 cars hit them hard.   F1 cars are made to go the quickest around a track, both Lambo & GTR have no chance if they're put up against any F1 car in a track.
Forgot to mention the price of GT-R.
Best yet  Epic 😁👏 Suspect llf’s skyline would’ve taken the lambo
Lamborghini all the way 👍🏻
Can you do a race between 1200hp Huracan and Bugatti Chiron??
Gotta say, best race yet 👍
Where was yanni?? Would have been sick😂
fyi F1 are for circuit not for drag because engine displacement is too small compare to the other cars if theres a 6litre F1 car ot sure will smoke all of them
That Lamborghini, just fcked off. Ho-Ly-Fuk😳
Jj
The lambo damnnnn son
That Lambo is absolutely nuts 🔥🔥🔥
How cool is this to have such a legend “David Coulthard” to race on this channel! Would be nice to have him on cam for some comments.
This is how you Lamborghini properly
We want to see Agera RS go against Chiron
Pls race The tesla roadster against The nevera
That lambo is nuuuuuts !!! Holy sh*t !
how q 2.4 na engine produce 750 hp?
Crayzay lambo
Rickys gtr from llf
Never mess with the Lambor without bumper
Add in some corners and the F1 car would be a blip on the horizon in front of the other cars!!!
Race that lambo vs a tesla
You can hear that the F1 car isn't set-up for max performance. Redline is lower than normal for those V8's and he's short shifting like crazy.
Where’s the Kawasaki H2?
R35's are 👎🏻. R34 was the last good one. Everyone says GTR's are supercar killers but this just proves otherwise. GTR gets sent to gapplebees by a huracan. Best part is the GTR has more work done to it and makes more power☠️.
Race the 1200hp Lamborghini against the Rimac Nevera
Lamborghini absolutely insane, he smash gtr and f1
The F1 car clearly has some major traction issues due to the tires not being warmed up. Normally these things do 0 to 200 in 4.5 seconds, and even in the wet 6.0 seconds, so it should have utterly smoked the sports cars, no matter how  tuned.  And also worth noting that the weight of 640 kg is the minimum weight mandated by FIA regulations, and is the kerb weight of the car including lubricants, coolants, AND the driver AND has enough weight to make up to require ballast. So for a direct comparison with the dry weights quoted for the sports cars, the dry weight of a 2011 F1 car is actually around 500 kg. Mental yeah !
this was like OMG
Why yanni not driving it?, Whether losing or winning in a Lambo his reactions are priceless
354 kmh em 1/4 😨😨😨 anda demais, pqp!
LLF enters the chat
Skip to 3:29
wwwwwwwwwwtttttttttttttttfffffffffff😵😵😵😵😵😵😵😵
I wish Redbull made their insane Redbull x2 2010 or 2014
Wow that was exciting 🤣
Comparison of the engine is a huge factor, V10 vs V8 vs V6 surely a V10 with lightweight can accelerate quickly and can gain momentum in a short mile run.
What’s the 0-60 time in the Lamborghini???
Please review lucid car
That WAS nuts!
This video #1 trending! Respect to Matt Watson. Well deserved!
That lambo is just insane but if that gtr is really 1300 hp and the lambo is 1200 how is that possible? Even I  weight reduction 100hp is a huge gap. And the lambo put train lengths on the gtr it makes no sense. But then again props to the tuners of that lambo that's insane
Get DMOs Lambo and Rockys skyline to challenge them 😜
I‘m a german newcomer👀🖤
Is that Mark Webber again in the F1?
Lobe the humour. Thanks guys. Very impressed with the Lambo and GTR compared to the F1 car. Great show!!
You could try them going round corners aswell
Rimac vs Lambo please
https://youtu.be/YASfcY-MARc
this is nuts!! lambo is way incredible
my huynday tuscon sounds better than that lamborgini couse my car dosetna have euxaste
Never mess with twin turbo Lamborghini
This video really puts it into perspective how quick the boostedboiz mr2 is. These cars are mental, then you realise there is 30 year old Toyota with a Honda engine going even faster.
Make a race between a formula 1 car and the Rimac Nevera
🔥🔥🔥
Yanni wants this Lambo now
That lambo is fast!
Let's get the jesko on here
7:13 how he holds on for Dear life.   Lambo: 1200 HP..... I lied foo!
Fun fact this is 1on trending
*You ok hun ?" 😄
“If team are happy I am happy” , same dialogue last race also , so humble 🥺
Race this Lamborghini against the 911 Turbo S. R.I.P the 911.
How about an F1 car that's not detuned, isn't shifted short and is running soft tyres?
Huracan has been nerfed by its Naturally Aspirated 😆
Man that Lambo launches hard
The Lambo won But 8.9  Well.   3 slow cars then  Other lambos and Gtrs smokes this cars
This is by far the best drag race performed by Carwow, period.
Biggest surprise was seeing DC is now completely grey haired 🤯.
That f1 car makes that v8 sound like it's prepubescent
Imagine these cars off with the GT WINGS
🤯
the person who built and tuned the lambo is a legend that thing just hooks and goes
All three are insane, that Huracan is just nuts but damn you can't beat an F1 car.
If the f1 had the race set up made for this type of comparison was different maybe..
What a video! Nothing beats the sound of the F1
Actually formula 1 cars are not ment for drag races... i mean.. its not the fastest if its going straight for too long.
5:35 Gentle man speak
Tanks to red bull team
Trash video.  Here, lets compare 3 vehicles that are so vastly different, that we already know what car will win.
Never mess with a lambo without a rear bumper.
Not let's put them on a track and see how they do. We all know the f1 car is not made for drag races.... to me is a pointless race. Lambo vs gtr yes no point adding a F1 car
#1 on trending
Ты тоже ищешь русские комментарии?
Are you saying a Lamborghini is quicker than a Bugatti
The chiron did not beat the f1 but these cars annihilat-
Mat can u please do a full review on that Lamborghini ❤🔥
"if the team are happy, im happy" -david
This lambo vs sf90 vs rimac nivera.🥂🥂🥂
carwow should now be called carwow-WOW!! Hats off to Matt & the team for pulling this off. This race, for me, is just 2nd to that crazy fab race with the SVJ, 812SF & 911TS. Like some have commented, this TT Huracan rocket or another with even more power, should go against that missile called the Nevera..show that ICE done well can still kick ass...
Need to get DMOs e63s on here
😀❤️❤️❤️😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭🇹🇭
Is hard to believe it the Lamborghini tuned cars can beat the formula 1 cars 2011 series. The Lambo Is insane tune up. With 1200hp and 1240nm is really perfect number and really fast.
This was a real race 😅
Invite Zezé from AM Motorsport, i does the 1/4 mile in 8 seconds on a polo 1994 1.9tdi
Man he had hard  He needs soft
Can you race this Lambo vs Rimac Nevera???
How does that Lamborghini get enough air taken in as the intake filters are at the back of the car
Plz could we have Dodge Demon vs F1 Redbull ? Thanks
hello carwow I'm from Indonesia I'm curious Lambo 1200 horsepower vs rimac please fight those 2 cars please.🙏
I wonder what a current F1 would do. I cant believe lambo be it that soundly.
Traction and 2 turbo's wins the day dispite the weight of the Lambo & Datsun ,  now take the test to the track were the f1 car was built for it will demolish them both .... intresting thou ...
F1 cars from 2009-2016 were pretty weak ass cars
Call bobamotring and his 1200hp vw mk2 vs the hulk lambo...  can it be don!? A crazy idea... From Argentina with respect...
CHEERS to them who rewind it to listen the F1 again. 😂
R35 not even near to 1300hp
I knew F1 sucked and is fake, but that was really crappy.
next bring a top fuel dragster plis mat😂
This is very entertaining. The Lambo was in a different league
Twin turbo high precision engine like the Lamborghini is just STUPID POWERFUL.
might wanna get some softs on the f1 car, might provide more grip and maybe less wheelspin idk im just ranting out my thoughts to sound like a car professional
Click on every video wondering which car is going to win. Watch 2 seconds to see which car Matt is in and you know the result.
You know what this means don't you?   Yani's got to twin turbo his Lambo.
Best carwow ever!
Maybe a Kawasaki H2R into the mix as well? Can't imagine that bike being beaten with a rolling start. Model S Plaid also claims a 9.2s quarter mile, so might be a close one with the F1 car too.
everybody about how cool are the cars...but what about the balls on David to drive that car with slicks on that weather...
I Love It When My Notification Pops Up  “ Your Comment has Been Liked & You Have a New Subscriber “
You know you're getting old when you refer to the GT-R as the "Skyline" :D
1200hp Lamborghini v Rimac Nevera
When I saw Mat’s Face at 220 MPH   I can’t believe what happens to the driver going at 320 mph on my Ferrari 599xx evo in fh4 😂
Insane from JM yet again 👏👏👏
Love the F1 car in videos
Who puts dislike on this 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ maybe better go back to watch how to make a cupcakes 🧁 video
That f1 car is impressive
PLEASE put Yanni in that Lambo 😍
It's crasy that a tuned street car let a Formel 1 car let it looks like it's not really moving 🤔sorry for the bad English I am from Germany
We need the Same Lamborghini Huracan against a Bugatti Veyron and a koenigsegg (any model)😜
You know that gtr is fast, considering that f1 car beat the chiron
The acceleration on the Lamborghini is just ridiculous.
Those JDM kids gonna say this is fake
I'd call this drag race void, you're not changing gear manually, whereas Coulthard has to, need to enforce fully manual gear changes
imagine what could a 2020 F1 car had done in that drag race !!
That lambo is nuts
Those sub 10 seconds drag races are coming hot these days...wow, what a race...well done team carwow 👏👏👏
How much do we get off the lambo in car wow
First corner and lambo will stay faaaar behind. Just a numpty's straight line toy
7:14 that lambo switched from 2nd to 4th real freaking quick 👀👀
Gtr is fail
plz do a race between that Lamborghini hurricane vs tesla model s p100d
Can you please do the Ferrari SF90 And the same Lamborghin with yiunimize driving it 😁and f1
i whould like to see formula car vs this lambo in Nurburgring
the fact tht skyline is equal fast w f1 car is more impress than tht lambo
Red bull isn't the fastest F1 Car I'm Sure Sebastian Vettel silver car is faster
2 radios is more 20 Hp more
The terrifying thing is that the lambo can still go faster. There's at least 100 to 150 kgs that can be easily dropped in weight to give it a better power to weight ratio.
Try a race track against the F1 car 🤦🏻‍♂️
I love that huracan sir mat
Rimac vs this Lamborghini
8.9 seconds... Wow😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥
That lambo my god😱😱😱
According to estimates, in perfect circumstances and with warm tyres (and obviously with Matt at the wheels) f1 car should complete the 1/4 mile within 8 seconds beating both Lambo and GTR. Anyway this drag race was pure fun
Anyone else see the bugatti chiron in the back? 🥺🤔 Or is it just me?
mat , next Formula-E vs Tesla vs Moto-E 🙏 pls...
Great video.  As probably some people pointed out, F1  are made for track and Lambo or GTR would have no chance there.  Lambo what a BEAST.
“This Lamborghini vs Tesla Models S Plaid” who wins?
Lambo vs porsh
When you add corners, that f1 car would absolutely destroy the gtr and the huracan
damn an f1 car has a 7 speed AUTOMATIC. the huracan also has an AUTOMATIC. shouldnt a car selling website at least tell you if u have a dct or sequential or not? its not that hard. if the automatic part is a must then maybe include torque converter auto or dual clutch auto or single clutch auto.
That f1 car is detuned so much to the original beast
#1 trending 😱😱
Lamborghini huracan twin turbo vs Audy RS3 Iroz Motorsport vs Ford Mustang hoonicorn 🙏🙏🙏
Next time, please get RBR to use their Monza spec car, and perhaps, some Ultra Softs from the Pirelli purple era.  I'm not an engineer, but I'm sure Ultra's won't suffer from thermal deg or blisterings from just going up and down the track; should make this race more interesting.  I personally think, if these competing cars turn up tuned up, it's only fair if the F1 car is tuned up in their own way that they can be.  @RBR please make this happen!
Alright  Just modified any Lambo to the max against mk 4 supra max boosted. And let's find out ✌️✌️✌️
Carwow please race the hypercars like Koenigsegg,  Bugatti, PAGANI, tuatara etc.
🐂 Lambo 😅
1.7M views in less than a day! 😳 👏👏 Absolutely mental.  And that Lambo, surely the air filters being in the wash of the exhaust isn’t the best.  Could it be even more powerful with clean air? 🤔
Why does Mat always drive the best car?
4:44  thank me later.
That lambo is literally quick
Never sleep on a Huracan with a rear bumper delete!
I was hoping for a track battle but….
HOW did you get an F1 car?!
We need Yianniiiiiiii
Need Ferrari vs Lamborghini
if RB7 use red tyre that may be another story
On a track results would be Red Bull, Nissan and Lambo
Would've been more interesting if RBR got the Monza spec'd car, the one with the flat dinner plate as the rear wing.  I wonder if David used DRS?  Didn't seem like it from the camera angles.
The question is at what RPM do you need to reach that HP?
What a showoff.
The GTR just can't hide its 300kg dead weight penalty even though it's got more HP.
Would love to see the Lamborghini up against a motorbike, like a Panigale V4R.  Perhaps a @44teeth hook up?
Max Verstappen we need some backup
That lambo is nuts
V8? On a Honda? 🤔
Plaid plus vs F1 next please?
If that is the price of Huracan in my country i can afford it..unfortunately the price is 350k pound here excluding roadtax and insurance
Please use this Lamborghini against that 1800bhp electric car. Drag and rolling race!
Team are happy, I'm happy Nicee
Rimac vs that lambo vs the tesla model s plaid...real show that one😋😋we'll be waiting mat
Mat you need to do these lamborghini vs rimac nevera
One of the best days of Matt’s life I bet
the lambo vs the chiron next video. The chiron lose to the F1 so the lambo will kill the chiron? Thumbs to see that next guys.
Is this why David was absent from the Saturday's Hungarian Qualifying coverage? 😅  Shame on you DC, shame on you!
RACE THAT LAMBO WITH A BUGGATI
F1 vs Nevera plz!
Apart from the sheer horsepower difference between the F1 car and the Lambo, the Lambo is able to put down that power way better but even still 500hp more on the Lambo only netted it a 0.3 sec better 1/4 mile time mainly cause the F1 car is way lighter than the Lambo.
I want to see this Lamborghini VS Bugatti Chiron that will be so much fun to watch
Next video : hi I’m mat Watson here and here I have an f-1 car , rimac , RAF Air Force Typhoon
Lamborghini looks like cockroach
Yes JM is blowing up!  love it lads! Congratulations
My gosh that lambo smash F1 car.. damn...   We would like to see the lambo vs nevera and nevera vs F1..
this lambo needs a tuned 1200hp 911
The F1 shifted like 24 times👀
Please do this huracan vs nevara
Please car wow could you on future videos show us all the 0.60 times as well as the 1/4 miles speeds and times .we know the lambo was able to do the 1/4mile in under secs but but was its terminal speed at that point.
Well thats just made pretty much every drag race embarrassing from here on out ,pub chat my cars quicker than a F1 car  lol than lambo is just insane 👍.be interesting if you could get it back to race a bugatti super speed  now that would be epic.
Probably the sickest drag race ever. These cars are totally insane.
OK, UST HEAR ME OUT, LOL!!! THE RACE YOU GUYS NEEEEED TO SETUP RIGHT NOW IS THE  F1 CAR, VS THAT LAMBO, VS THE RIMAC NEVERA, THATS IT, END OF CONVERSATION, THAT WILL BE AN EPIC RACE FOR SURE!!!!!!!!!
Remac bring it on, the Lambo will fight for us.
One word: Summon the Rimac
This was insane!!!
Let me know if you guys need some 4K aerial footage
GTR guy doesn't know to ride it and it is stock.
You just buy a 911 Turbo S and still can record them without being too behind.
I would like to see the 1/2 mile race from a stand still.
F1 not power in drag. But power in corner circuit.
👍😍Lamborghini most power full 💪
I love this channel!! 🤣
Well that f1 price is far from real. Near 5-7million...
Could you plz put that lambo up against the rimac
Writing before watching huracan will be definitely faster hp/weight huracan 1.4t 1200hp vs 1.7t 1300hp f1 is rwd and i dont think that he has so long gears so 1)huracan 2)r35 3)f1
Definitely the best video iv seen on carwow. Thanks guys. That Lambo is in another level.
I like how the “ slowest “ car is still fast as fuck 💀
220 mph and 0 safety gear
Cant belive f1 lost to lamborgini 🤨
They stole the f1 car in the middle of the night, and this is what they have been doing with it, untill they notice and have to give it back
Those who are asking for birds eye view i.e drone footage of the video takings is not possible because the video takings are done on an "active airfield" therfore won't get approved by the FAA for flying.
Can we all just appreciate Matt here has upped the game of drag racing by introducing F1 into the pack
The green Lamborghini is identical of the green Kawasaki.
Plz that Nissan ant making 1300. Maybe 800
We are the last gen witnessing these monsters Grawling, 2035 will be total electric
Never expected F1 lose..
How many gears that F1 have?
Buzzy's Lambo on fire y0!
You should definitely add Tesla S plaid
Lamborghini vs Rimac nevera vs gtr
Next Race- F1 vs Lambo vs Nascar
What year F1 car?
Amazing
No doubt that Carwow is in another level
Yah f1 just for trackrace dude ! That’s look sad
I absolutely LOVE how the GTR sits down at the back 😩‼️
5:15 Pure Partridge
Islam emancipates the mind from superstitions and uncertainties; it liberates the soul from sin and corruption and frees the conscience from oppression and fear. Submission to the will of God, does not curtail freedom, on the contrary it gives a very high degree of freedom by freeing the mind from superstitions and filling it with truth and knowledge.
HAMILTON AND VERSTAPPEN IS WATCHING.... WHILE THE LAMBORGHINI OWNER THINKING TO GO F1 NEXT SEASON....
In the first race mat had a really perfect reaction time
Change name from David to Gerald!!
Why the F1 don't use the soft Tyres?
RB7 didn't have grip, was quite evident.
Dominic toretto : i'm falling sleep watching this dide
Do Formula 1 vs Rimac Nevera. Let's see who wins
Imagine if the f1 car didnt have that giant front spoiler its game over lmao
Amazing race. Ty
on 1mile id definitely have the advange over you.. -D Coulthard. Did rolling start up to 1 mile and lost. So david? -Mat
I like how he keeps saying its soo close every time they start
Pliz Lamborghini huracan 1,200hp vs Rimac nevera
@ 7:13  you can see Matt shifting from 2 to 4 gear, I wonder if that was a genuine mistake or did he mean to just fackkk off in 4th gear lolll anyways that lambo has some pullllllll
How F1 car not win
Would love to see a Senna do the brake test!
Next, F1 Turbo Hybrid V6 2021 VS Remac Nevera VS Huracan Turbo 1200HP VS Kawasaki Ninja H2R, This Will Be a World Record Racing...
Love to see that lambo against a porsche😈😈
Where is your brain man 12 cylinders vs 6 cylinders  That is just bullshit
Lambo is a rocket, but the thing is the F1 is designed to take that high speed through the corners and on deceleration, power to weight and physics don't lie
Tuned GTR doesn’t give outcome as on paper.   Waste of money for tuning it. Tuned Huracan is the best tuned system and it suits with the car best.
THIS IS INSANEEEE!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 my favourite of your drag races yet! 👍🏻
Add the lamborghini on the leader board
DRS?
Throw the Plaid Model S in this, Carwow!!
F1 engine sound !
Why that GTR driver again? He's fat and no idea how to drive at all... Let him drive the Lambo and he will way back as always usual...
Kinda wanna see the Lambo face-off with the Rimac Nevera, would be a fucking madness.
DRS was not engaged… that would help
when i saw the lambo without a rear bumper, i already knew.
ABSOLUTAMENTE I-N-S-A-N-O!!!
Enjoyed
Audi rs3 (800hp) vs 911 turbo S vs  BMW M5 (1000 hp) vs Lamborghini urancan (1290 hp)
Please add a drone to view it from the top😃
PARA CUANDO EN ESPAÑOL
More f1 car videos please 😍
Its a lot closer when he doesn't jump the gun lol
imagine break failure at them speeds😩
Please read this carefully ;  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake .  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 );  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.
Very awesome video!
“nuta meetas”
They spent 250 million just so it could go as fast as a 80k GTR
All Lambo fans like this 😎
we all know that F1 car will smoke those cars in a track. But damn those cars are beasts
Just race some fighter jets now Mat bc this is getting ridiculous 😂
I'd like to hear peak power at what rmp on the stats breakdown.
7:14 car accelerated so fast it basically skipped third gear 🤣
The most bullshit drag race ever. Gtr are one of the fastest car out there and the Lambo kills it by 3 to 4 cars.
Like Yianni says Lambo all day Everyday...
Do y'all think the new f1 cars would win this
this is the best drag race i’ve ever watch
That sound, make this 18+ video
All you hear is the f1 car
drag race between formula 1 car would be great
use the jeep trackhawk pickup please
This Lamborghini is woooooooooow
Best one yet.
If it was the 2021 F1 car's it would of won easily
Albon about to recreate this.
God bless everyone and your family 🙏🏾❤️🗣
Live for God  repent read your Bible pray and have faith I’m him stand firm in it Isaiah 7.9 in Jesus name amen he’s coming soon🙏🏾‼️
Matt Watson in no1 trending yeah 👀👀
Tremendo ese Lambo!!!😳
Surprised the GTR was the slowest
Carwow need to get their own carwow track and do lap times. Being fast in a straight line is alright but being fast around a track is what it’s really about. It would break up the endless drag races a bit as well.
70k of mods on the Lambo but they couldn't afford a rear bumper ;-)
Matt please race the Lamborghini versus the rimac I will pay the see that
This lambo hurricane vs Rimac Nevera
تحدي التوقع🤔 العقاب جامد😂😂❤️ https://youtu.be/ypTYwJ6lcSo
Tesla
7:35 Jesus christ, 220 mph, that must feel pretty insane. (Even if the speedo is off a little bit)
Now this is what I call a drag race holy shit?
No surprise seeing Tezos on the car...Next level car+Next level blockchain= Winning!!
You jumped the start.
Why do you use walking-talky instead of doing a phone conference or something and have you hands free?
That F1 car brake though
carwow america latina please
Can we just appreciate these cars like holy cow they're all insane
Listen... I am the way, truth & life no one comes to the father (God) except through me.John 14:6 Please believe that Jesus died for your sin & rose again. Then confess your sins to God today! Dont be left behind.
New race tesla plaid vs tune lambo vs rimac🔥🔥🇯🇲🇹🇹🌍💯💯
use drs!!!
For a Nissan, not bad at all.
Chick monk voice where is he i could do this again😂😂 but that lambo is wicked hear the sound of it🇹🇹🇯🇲🌍👊🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯
Act twin turbo would destroy anything
Loved the race but there is not a single video on this channel where a Gtr actually wins a race tuned or stock🤣🤣🤣
Wtf
Let's get on the track now, and see who's the best car and driver.
I felt that Toretto spoke at the end. "No matter if you win by and inch or a mile, winning is winning" woooowww. 🤣🤣
Nissan stats is fake news😂😂
Can you do a formula e car vs formula 1 car?
Love it that every Carwow drag race always has the GTR last
F1 is on hard compound tyres it seems.
Remember when the Turbo S with a 10.1 secs was the fastest car they've ever had on the channel
Lets do the chiron vs that lime green lambo
So did you have the f1 driver take it easy?
WOW!!!
Too much talking..
Drag this lambo against remac. Their times are not that different
Imagine having a car capable of gapping a F1 championship winning car
배기량 튜닝은 어떻게 하는거에요?
Is the engine on that Lamborghini ok? Seems the power is ruining it? A lot of black smoke when it takes off... Considering it's running on petrol / methanol
Dmo DJ huracan vs that huracan needs to be raced
How long before Matt gets asked to front Top Gear?
You forgot Renault made the engine don’t forget that
My granddad works at car wow
At least it would've been fair if you did a lap time on a small track so that the F1 car lapped both the Lambo and the GTR once...lol.
F1 cars depend on grip so this isn't a truly fair race for the F1 car
Idc about the lambo still taking that f1 car
Rematch between the Lamborghini vs 911 turbo s. Thanks
that lambo vs model s plaid
i am quiet disappointed that the GT-R did not won anything
“You ok hun” part tho🤣🤣
How much can I save on an f1 car with carwow?
Fake show fake show fake show fake show 😂😂😂
Buzzy Singh’s Lambo is Insane
Sounds like the Nevera has a mild competitor
Lamborghini also makes fast tractors!
Lamborghini vs Remac pleaseeeeeeeee
es increible ver como un coche de calle destroza a un fórmula uno,muy divertida la carrera
It’s almost unfathomable to now need a 1200 hp tuned Lambo just to beat the Tesla S Plaid… Insane times…
Matt's been spending too much time with Yanni.  Jumped the starts which kind of ruined this race.  The F1 car would have been much closer otherwise...but that Lamborghini is like shit off a shovel fast.
That lambo is absolutely insane
So hp means nothing!
the race starts at 3:30
Daai lambo is moer vinnig
Well, this channel became a random tuned car drag race exclusively, no more reviews, no more real cars.. I guess it's a good bye.
With cars like that, you really gotta go all the way to the 1/2 mile imo @carwow
Hmm? Not sure if that gtr is really 1300hp?
heh,   take some corners and see which one wins
Great race Mat but next time make sure you race the GTR in full power and let's see exactly how that Lambo holds up Mate 😉
I'm sure the F1 still has the down force set up for racing. Still, a lambo beating an F1 is nutty. I'd like to see the race again on a prepped track.
How much does 8 seconds cost in cars, vs. motorcycles?
can you do a drag race between the nevera and the 1200hp lamborghini
That lambo  needs to be on hoonicorn vs the world
Porsche 918 spyder vs lamborghini drag race
This video is offensive to the gtr community I want it removed ;-;
Well fudge me that was unexpected.
Given these tuned cars performed flawlessly is impressive when you consider how much trouble and glitches you've experienced with tuned cars in the past. A TT Lambo always sounds good on paper althogh be be honest I did expect it  to put it's power to the road in the real world as effectively, efficiently and consistently as it did, very impressive! The GTR may of came last in this race only because of its impressive company, given it did 3 sold sub 10 second runs one that was 9.3sec and did them without putting up a fuss or making excuses means it too is a winner in this race 👍🏻
There is no way the F1 car get beaten by a car.. any road car.
Best ever vid I reckon , insane 🤪
we know the results before you start. so looking forward too it.
That lambo v rimac nevera
Goddamn that huracan flies
Im Japanese and I'm confident about GTR coming first but then I realised that it was against a hurracan with a rear bumper delete
Pls who the hell tuned this lambo? That car is freaking crazyyyy
i wanna see the 1300hp iroz RS3 vs the huracan
Curious what the difference in the F1 car would be if it ran less wing. Like if it ran Monza-spec.
TT Lambo Vs Remac also you can throw in the F1 in for good measure 😋
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
All the way from Mexico, freaking insane mate!!🤘🤘🤘
When the slowest car in the race does the 1/4 mile in 9.3 sec you know things are starting to get serious.
Awesome video Matt keep up the awesome work! Now to me it’s like:  Tesla Model S Plaid: I can go 9 secs on the quarter mile! Beat that!  Mat in the Huracan: Hold my beer. *does 8.9* Tesla: uh……
That's the real power of lambo's💪
https://youtu.be/L4dMnHW2B9I
That lambo is fire
300 kg difference between lambo and GTR is a lot.
Aquí Buscando algún comentario en español
If anyone likes watching tuned cars do the Quarter mile in World record times watch ‘Dragtimes’ channel for a lambo or ‘Livinglifefast’ for a GTR - both well over a second faster than Matts lambo! Madness 🤯
This has shocked me. I thought the F1 would have been faster on the mile. And that lambo... is fucking insane! And the GTR is absolutely no slouch
this is sick!!!!!!! well done everybodyyyy!
drag race is one thing... but a track race.. the F1 car would just walk away with time

7:14 why lambo shifted the 3rd gear too early into 4th gear ?
Standard gearbox for lambo? Wow
you guys know what that tezos logo is on the F1 car?
How about a Tesla compared to these cars?
@carwow why don't you get someone else to do the countdown for the rolling race instead of Mat. That why he won't have the advantage of flooring it before everyone else because he is doing the countdown.
Godzilla being the heaviest in this league still this 1300hp GTR beating a honda F1. GTR being the greatest car ever made in this era.
Rimac has to be next!!!!  BUT, you should have also added in a race to the half mile / mile mark to see if the F1 car would have ever caught the Lambo. Going off the rolling race results I’m not sure it would have, contrary to what Coulthard thinks
Lambo proving you can have an awsum sounding turbocharged car
yaaaaaay you didnt got fired
That f1 car just has to much drag with al the aro bits on it
How are F1 cars so expensive?! You could buy 15 Bugatti Chiron for that price
They should put the f1 in DRS mode if they can but great video
That Lambo is totally insane! That's the carwow drag race record isn't it?
And a stock, yes STOCK nevera gaps them? Bruhhh 💀
So the Huracan TT is literally faster than F1
Why you don't tell us how much tourq for the F1
We wanna see the remac nivera with the formula 1
Think that was the best car wow race ever!!
Please ease Tesla plaid S vs This Lambo
You should race the Lambo vs the turbo s
Before I even watch, didnt the evolve m5 comp blow this gtr away a few videos ago? Discard the shit, keep the champions 💪
that was epic
Better reaction time than coultard 😂😂😂😂
If the Lamborghini didn't have the twin tutbos, it would be last
La caña
I feel like that lambo should be worth a lot more😭😭
3:47 5:55 what a sound
7:36 - 220 MPH = 354 km For Us the rest of the world
The Tesla Model S Plaid way way better without any Mods !!!!!!!!! All these cars with these mods are NOT going to live long  life max 20 to 30K miles then you have to lose more money to replace lots of parts and fixing them !!! Plaid is the best of the best for sure for many many years to come !!! Oh btw when Elon will push more power over the air to the Plaid for FREE will be rocket !!
The torque of the formula 1?? 🤔🙄
"This is the sound of Underground".🎶😎
that lambo is nutz
Let DC use DRS haha
We need a drag race with this lambo vs a rimac
Lambo kept jump starting
The launch from that lambo is INSANE
That speedo y'all put up on screen for the mile race, You should have done that for the quarters as well
Lambo is 0.28seconds slower than the Roman Nivera😬😳
Congratulations! you have reached the end of the drag race game. You can now go back to second hand advices.
https://youtu.be/nXviPEs9S7A
bruh... a lambo beating an F1 car is like a guy in a suite beating the shit out of an MMA fighter
WE NEED A DRONE PLS CARWOW!! awesome drag race as usual but i think the quality would be improved immensly with aerial shots
That f1 car in racetrim would have destroyed both. That engine is nowhere near it's rpm's it did when it was racing.
holly hell... get Matt and crew flippen headsets, LOL!!  I cringe every time I see him trying to drive and handle a walkie-talkie.  Great races, the 3rd was the most fair of them all.  Matt didn't jump while the starters hands were still straight up vertical.
So the lambo is faster than the Buggati Chiron?🤔 Previously on CarWow the F1 car beat the chiron....
I would change my insta bio to gapped a f1 car
Starts at 3:30
wow, that Lambo is nuts!!!! Yianni would love it I think it should have a race with Rimac and Chiron 1-mile rolling race Lambo might beat Rimac
That lambo well and truly just F#cked off like Matt said! Seeing him drop those WT’s on the roller and how quick it pulled 50-110 was hideous, still climbing fast at 220… 🤮
lesson learned. If you see a lambo with no rear bumper, dont race
Remac vs this lambo
Why do Tesla fanboys have to ruin every comment section, and its always about straight line speed lol. Fun to watch but probably one of the worst benchmarks for a car. Not hating on electric but would take a slower petrol engined car just for the feel tbh.
Mat had the Lambo at 220mph.....Holy Moly!!! Has he ever gone that fast before?
Well there must be a lot of luck of knowledge in uk how to tune gtrs. I have watched many gtrs in carwow racing and they are so slow comparing the power they make In Australia we have couple gtrs 1300hp running 8.5 1/4mile all day (yes full weight street cars)
You need to race that lambo against the rimac nevera!
Should have been an F1 car from the actual season and not from 2013
Freaking Out!!
@2:42 Thanks me later  👍🏻
That lambo is literally a rocket 🚀
Impressive Quarter Mile, Lamborghini Hit 220mph in less 20s
Singh is king ...
Yeah your Lamborghini Beat a Honda and a Nissan were so impressed
the lambo is so fast it makes a 9.3s drag look slow
Bey f1
Empieza en 3:29
Basically huracan and gtr can beat chiron easily oops
One of the best videos. That lambo is an absolute weapon
That F1 car should use ultrasoft tires and use DRS... If they do that, lambo cannot beat the F1 car
Can't believe how this F1 car has beaten Bugatti Chiron and not a Lambo.
6:00 name of song?
7:38 wtf 😮😦😦
How do u handle so much power n speed 🙆🏻‍♂️
I would like to see that lambo vs the rimac nevera
Dude that lambo is crazyyy
jm imports ftw
Considering the brakes are not hot, the wheels are not hot enough and the surface of the test track, those braking abilities of that F1 car is insane!
Yanni is probably drooling over that Lambo 🤤
NOONE CAN SMOKE A TT LAMBO. It has just 1200HP and it can go up to 2000HP. Im sooooo sorry for GTR fans. 🤣😈🔥 Lambo All Day EveryDay. Big like for this video.
How did the f1 completely destroy a chiron, but the lambo destroys the f1? I know twin turbo huracans are mad, but im confused that it beat the f1
Would’ve loved to see a 0-60 launch with all of them!
Watching these fast, and glorious sounding cars, i wonder what the point of electric cars is. I mean, they are just a little bit faster. Not even much faster, but they are like 90% more boring to watch. Whats the deal?
My inner JDM soul is just happy it kept up with a freakin F1 car
I wonder, Matt, when you show the times to the quarter mile. Do you take the fastest of all 3 runs for each individual car, or just the times of the last run?,
Cool.
If only Lambo would of done turbos to it’s Huracan, it would be one hell of a monster machine!
I love Lambos. The F1 car is a freaking weapon.
The 3rd race was the best accurate representation. Imagine if the F1 car was AWD or had a turbo 👀
Wow a Lambo won something! Yanni would be proud.
Formula 1 is .5 seconds behind at the start .
Definitely that Lambo vs Rimac race is required
So when you have over 1000 hp you can do a quarter mile in 9 seconds or less... That's not shocking if you are in drag races... And yes I'm talking to you Tesla, everyone is talking about the plaid and drag race numbers and ignoring the fact that it has over 1000 hp so the numbers are ok for the amount of power... And it's more impressive in that Lamborghini for the fact that it has a gear box and thousands of moving parts in that engine in comparison to the simpler (not simple but simpler) electric motor...
For something different and more exciting,  do s speed comparison like this...  https://youtu.be/3RuUp5MT3Uc
Man, that Lamborghini is tuned like hell. I really thought the F1 car was gonna win because of its less weight advantage. But that Lambo launches like a fighter jet. Lambo's launch was nuts. Perfectly tuned Lambo 🔥
You should race the new cayenne turbo gt vs urus
Brilliant!  That Lambo is a brute!.  David C a great sport as always - definitely one of my favourite F1 stars - down to earth.
We need the model s plaid now in this!!
This lambo vs Rimac Nevera vs Bugatti Chiron vs Ferrari SF90 💥
Fantastic idea! Loved this match up. No German bores
It would be nice to see a more current F1 car in comparisons like this.
H O L Y :0
Yo matt and team best vid yet.brill👍👍
This Lambo just god level
WTF 😂😂
Thats Lamborghini against the nevera
well, the F1 car is not designed to maximize straight-line speed an F1 car is all about maximising Cornering speeds.
Supra who ?
Very happy with Lamborghini winning, great achievement I would like to add an Arabic translation, we love your channel
Pabi should Turbo charge few models of their cars...I mean Turbos their add lot of of performance in their'e cars
Pueden subir esto a carwow america latina por favor
Was the DRS on? For F1 car
Lambo : 8.9 sec with 221mph top speed Kawasaki Ninja H2R : <8.3 sec with 249 mph top speed
Rimac vs lambo
A stock F1 car vs heavy modified super cars…
It would be good if yanni had driven the F1 car
What happens if you put the rear bumper back on the Lambo?  Ha!😏
Did a Lambo just beat a F1? WOTTTTT????
German Power 💪💪💪
This is my first time to see an F1 car losing a drag race to a "regular" car.. How is that possible??? 😲
Bro....... Lambo, INSANE ... 😍😍😍 Gtr... ❤️❤️ OMG
That lambo literally launches like a missile!! Crazy!
Mat looked genuinely terrified.
Thats vettels car isnt it?
Good to see a datsun up ✌🏾there 😍🇧🇧
the best electric car (rimac) cost a lot more, has more hp and isnt really faster than that lambo. here the e-car fanboys can see what a good combustion engine can do. tesla, rimac, and else are expensive crab.
Epic
That lambo v the rimac
We need a behind the scenes of these videos mat
Now try taking a few corners at 150mph and see how you fair against the F1 car.... lol
Awesome Day 🤟🏼
What a stupid video, boosting his own ego in a borrowed car.  Discusting!
This is by far some of the best car content on YouTube   Hats of to Matt and everyone involved this video was amazing
man...that was exciting!
Race bmw m5 1000hp and the gtr 1300hp and the lambo 1200hp
this will destroy the #RIMAC #Bugatti or de #Nevara. hardcore tuned both. Even hardcore tuned the LAMBO is cheaper and quicker.
Weight to power ratio (+100hp, +40 torque & +300kg) favours the Lambo over the GTR. Would love to see a AMS GTR on this channel.
The sound of that V8 😍
Get these same cars on a track and guess witch one would win? 🤔
now just gotta wait a few years then race a turbo hybrid f1 car.
Mat Watson was "coming" too early ;-) behave
That Lambo is a surface to surface missile
I really don't get that trend of exposing the rear end of a car, it makes the car look so ugly compared to a "covered" one
Lamborgini vs the Rimac vs F1 car that would be amazing!
Well he definitely jumped the gun twice,  but that lambo is still incredible.
I suggest during the break test you could get a drone shot directly above the cars. Just to tingle the satisfaction.
He said fricken hell reminding me of DMO Jay
Still quite impressive for that old and frkn heavy GTR
6:56 wait, hold up.... thats only 0.3sec slower, than the 2million € nevera😳
I bet the Turbo S would still win somehow 😂
They never bring a good gtr in race ....this gtr was about to pop a wheelie
Next time please bring the legendary Porsche vs this F1 car
MENTAL!
Wana see that lambo against the rimac
Just imagine that lambo vs the rimac nevera that would be and awesome drag race  Like if you would like to see that
UNBELIEVABLE!
where is the elon muski
This lambo vs nevera vs Red Bull for next race
Now let’s add some turns?!
I can already see this one becoming a classic...
Crazy Lambo but that's not just a tuning... The whole back end is missing...
62 million on that f1 why so much 🤷🏽‍♂️
Maybe on dry ground it would be different for F1
That lambo made the F1 car feel like an RC car 😭
220 mph😨
#1 on trending!!
F1 : 👁💧👄💧👁
I wonder why the F1 car was so.....slow? Well, I guess it’s because the F1 car is a truck car not a drag car! I think I just answered my own question!🤣
Probably a different story if the F1 car had the grip off the line.
this lambo is completely INSANE
Would love to see the Rimac vs Lambo 👍🏽
The Revera V F1 car?
Damn! Buzzy’s lambo is just next level! Respect to all machinery though in that race full stop that’s some super epic fast cars right there!  Epic epic vid
Absolutely mint!!!
Only 62million£? That's a bargain 😄
wrong start
Straight line f1 has no chance go to a race track
Matt, please, aerial shots. Drones etc. It would probably bring in the next few million subs
Great video
5:15 hasbullah is that you
Awsm
Rimac Nevera and this crazy Lamborghini would be amazing 🤙🏼
Why doesn't lamborghini produce a twin turbo car??
Get Ricky's 1900 bhp GTR against the F1 car
So that lambo is as fast as a rimac and cheaer haha
Don’t touch the Red bull. You may get a penalty
Most F1 teams: “Our F1 cars are not toys”   RedBull: “I dunno, drive it across the USA, floor it through London, go up against some guy named Matt in a Lamborghini”
That lambo TT vs the Ferrari sf90 or rimac nevera
Wow!! I’m impressed by the Lamborghini beating a F1 the RB and the GTR could be almost the same RB used Renault and Infiniti power units and those come from the Nissan-Renault auto group but I’m wondering why Lamborghini don’t make PU’s for F1? Or even a team? Even BMW could comeback to F1? I know is a very expensive sport but I noticed more and more people are watching F1 than ever !!
That formula 1 car weighs it's horsepower lol
Insane doesn't do justice to the lambo
ok that was an awesome shot at 7:38 wow
We will miss all this engine sound in 20-30 years. Manufacturers push for EV is bad for car enthusiast..
Matt, I think you should consider going back to saying, "I'm sat." You changed cause of everyone noting it for being incorrect, but it was YOUR intro. Now you're another guy simply saying, "I'm sitting...."   Jusayin it was your own unique intro.
Haha.. F1 car  is not that good apparently.
That was insane!!! I figured the F1 car would smash but them twin turbo Lambos are stupid fast.
These races get 'more carwow' 😲 on every upload.
220 mph 😂
standard gear box lol... that wont last 10k miles
David's car revving sounds like a Dremel tool on helium.
ЕРУНДА ПОЛНАЯ. Ф1 НЕ В ПОЛНУЮ МОЩНОСТЬ...
jüüüürgen
There should be A CarWow Tournament with all the Winning Cars doing Drag Races To find the Ultimate CarWow Car.
JURGEN AND JM-IMPORTS STREET KINGZ!!!
where they transmitting on police frequency? (9:46)
Soz - ridiculous video editing of races.
If they would put a hot mamacita for the countdown than the views will double.
Wow I never seen anything like that.. Formula 1 car got beaten by supercar wow wow Car Wow 😀
i just wanna see Tesla plaid vs f1
Rimac Nevera vs THAT LAMBO!!! Will be closer maybe
Nice vs.
please do drag races with NUTS cars like these with Yianni it will bo so much FUN
WTF YOU GOT DAVID COULTHARD?!??!?!?!
Imagine if u put turbos on that formula 1 car
That weren't David Coulthard that was Gerald from Clarkson's Farm.
I want to see the Tesla S plaid in this mix.
Safe to say car technology has come a long way…
That lambo Jesus!
Where’s Yianni? It’s Lambo time🥺
we need dmo's C63 on this channel!!!!!!!!!!!
hey carwow , watched your old video ,  which was uploaded in 2013 , don't we become old FART as we age 😂😂
Well that was bloody epic
Wow that Lamborghini is incredible, congrats to whoever built that, a lot of the tuned cars on this channel have problems but this seems to have gone smoothly.
Absolutely Stunning drag race !  Car Wow is king  You deserve your place on bbc television as a car program on a Sunday night  Top drawer Sir Matt 😀😀😀😀
Always enjoy Carwow content. That being said, I think Mat needs to do a little more research on F1 budgets... It's not quite as simple as "divide season budget by number of cars".
1000hp supra gonna race next?
He jumped the start, every time.
Would like to see the lambo vs BMW f90 evo with 1000hp. Would be Great! Put the F1 into that race too.
Buzzy Singh’s Lamborghini 💚 💚💚
Buzz car is amazing nufin catching that money well spent mate
lamborghini is the quickest car on carwow
Matt is HILARIOUS.....
Did not think I would ever see an f1 car being gapped by a lamborghine machine
Best race ever!!!!
tt lambo vs rimac next please
Rimac Nevera vs this lambo would be fun to watch.
Nuts!!!
Let me remind you guys that this kind of content if free, not commercials and hype then 5min publicity , 15 min fillers etc... that is why television will be out very very soon...  Great video!
Maybe it would be most interesting if it was Mac st2, not GTR
Speaking from experience any idiot can race in a straight line, corners on the other hand the F1 car got you beat
That lambo definitely needs to go against the rimac nevera!!
Rolling race was a rush .. they wasnt line up he was ahead when he start it
The greatest race ever.
Those guys driving an automatic in a straight line and act like they are pro drivers make me laugh🤣 Now lets see those 3 on a race track!
This tuned Lamborghini vs rimac nevera
GTR launched so bad....
https://youtu.be/gnK7_NsZVEU
Eeeesh but look at the fumes behind that Lambo. That's one smelly bull.
Eeeesh but look at the fumes behind that Lambo. That's one smelly bull.
4:49 thing looks like a sesto 😍 That is mental 🤯
Lambo vs rimac  It would be interesting
♥️👌👍
THE SOUND OF THE LAMBORGHINI IS CRAZY..
tuned lambo vs rimac nevera <3 ogoggogogogogo
1200hp Lamborghini vs Nevera next vid?
3rd race Matt finally didn't jump the start
Carwow  nailed it once again, legendary, hands down !
You should take this lambo against a Bugatti Chiron... That would be very interesting...
£62 million for a f1 car.. over priced 😂
I would love to see the F1 on a prepped surface for this race. The other cars are almost making twice as much power and that F1 still keeps up. When the GMA T.50 drops it's going to be insanely fast for the amount of power it has
One of the best ever drag races funny as fuck
I hope yianni gets to drive the Lamborghini... He'll for for sure
huracan vs rimac nevera vs tesla S Plaid !!!
This Lambo is badass
Nuts, love it 😍
Matt jumped 2nd start.....by about 3 weeks lol
Considering the formula one is supposed to dominate the track/corners, it did pretty well
Everybody: Clearly see the lambo incresing its lead even at the very end of 1/4 mile  David: "So at the mile we would definitely have the advantage over you"
On the third attempt he got off to a good start, in the first two part early, in any case the lambo has a frightening traction, impressive how quickly it unloads all the power to the ground
Please share the times for the three frag races :(
Imagine this redbull on a hyper soft type tyres
The should give that F1 car DRS lmao
Where is Max Verstappen
This video shows how F1 became so boring. Noise sucks and cars aren’t competitive like before.
When 9.3s car is the slowest
What a race 🤩
Koenigsegg make an appearance in the future ??????
this car f2 not f1
this guy really cant stop jumping the start of every race
A couple of tuned street cars beat a championship winning car,albeit  few years old its still madness to think how cars and tuning is moving forward.
Carwow is the best car review show/channel in the world right now. Unrivalled. Insane drag race.
Can you Hyundai Tucson vs Kia sportarge
Not really a surprise that result put them on a track and then watch the f1 car shred these to bits
I kinda miss the Turbo S in this race
Going by power to weight I was expecting the F1 car to smash it! Interesting
Actually I don’t know about others but I prefer stock cars no matter who wins bcoz we all know how terrible the tuneup cars r right mr Watson
Where the eggs and Bugatti at?
Lambo twin turbo is a monster. Nuff said.
Lambo 👍
If you race the remac nevera vs this tuned lambo, it will be an Intense race
When 9.3 second car is the slowest. What a race!
Can u guys bring tht nissan GTR tht destroyed it transmission during a drag race long ago... if it's fixed of course
Do all the generations of f1 cars
Até que fim vc ganhou uma kkkkkkkkk.😁
Man I would kill to see the F1 car go against the nevera!!! Pls make it happen Mat 🙏
Hi mat thanks for another wonderful drag race but I m still waiting for my dream drag race bmw m5 cs v the rest four door super saloon cars like merc got 63amg etc etc
Rimac vs buzz Lambo??? Be a good race????????????
That Lambo ripped off everything 🚘 ✂️
Thank you for all this videos ! I am a GTR Fan , but that race was just INSANE !!!!
tesla Plaid drag race please, Thank You
how must it feel to own a car that is faster than A FUCKING F1 CAR
i need to see the rimac nevera vs these cars
Incredible skill from mat at 7:14 holyyy
Whereabouts are the clueless young Cretins that think their Stage 14 tuned Audi RS3 OAP Shopping Car is faster than any Lamborghini at all.. (usually a tit with a laptop has charged them money and told them it’s faster)
Karen Horner going to request another review from the stewards for this and blame Hamilton somehow 😂
Thanks carwow
very bad asphalt for the f1, need a better runway
a modern f1 car would smash them, this is slower then these hybrid f1 cars
Plz subscribe
https://youtu.be/iTBlOXlHlgU
Getirin şuradan tamer abinin 2000 hp lik GTR ını bir şey deniyecez
This vid brought all kinds of joy
You guys should do a Rimac Nevera Vs Formula One car
This lambo vs rimac please !
To be fair now do a race at Suzuka, Imola , monza,  the f1 will murder the lambo in one lap
Nice drag ❤️👍
Imagine that someone looked at the 600 hp V10 Lamborghini and was like : Let's get this puppy twin turbo 😎
Twin turbo Huracan vs BUgatti Chiron
Kinda weird Yianny wasn't in the Lambo in this race, I think he would've made the video more entertaining thanks to his love for Lambos. Still the video was very good. Man that Lambo was insane, wasn't expecting it to win at all. We need a drag race where the Tesla Model S Plaid races that Lambo & a Bugatti Chiron. That'd make an insane video.
Re upload?
Imagine that formula 1 car was also tuned
Thought the lambo was gonna pop a wheelie at the start
That Lambo is fast oh my g. More specs? Best one so far this from your team. Good work.
the best automotive channel in the world carwow
Yanni wants that Lambo
who said you need to buy an electric car to shoot-off the line? buy a TT lambo today.
The F1 is for cornering ;-)
That Lambo, dude... frikin fast.
300 h2 or h2r pls Vs the twin lambo
Need to see a Lamborghini vs a Bugatti the best of every brand Bugatti and the Lamborghini too
Would be nice to see the F1 using soft tyres - and maybe have the race on tarmac, not concrete! Perhaps a V10 F1 car too....
Every time I see a Lambo in CARWOW  I just had to think about yianni
Lamborghini vs Rímac  👍
Best video yet! Cheered me up no end.
the most epic ending 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Would be interesting to see a 5 lap race against them to show what the f1 was actually designed for
Why treating DC like he's insignificant
Nissan is taking too long to lunch the next generation GTR, that I'm sure will be a killer to Porsches and Lambo's
Matt  you have races that dreams are made of!
Matt hit 220???!!
was the Formula 1 car using ERS?
I genuinely thought the F1 car was going to shred them but......WOW that Lambo was bl00dy rapid!!!!
Where is yanimaize
Wow nice cars I love it 😍😍
Mat cheats in almost every drag race on this channel, one jump start after another! Always the same!
Nice to see u again matt even after scarping ur CEOs tesla😂😂
Such a pity the Hoonicorn has been decommissioned.. would have made the best drag in the world... ever!
Tezos <3
LAMBO É LAMBO NÉ PAI...!!! 😁😁😁
I like your videos but you spend tooooo much time talking at the beginning be brief ty.
Toto & Lewis in season 2022: "Introducing the new RB beater... a tuned Lambo" Horner & Max: "Loooooool"
Holy ass that Lamborghini was nuts!
I love how DC still does all of the redbull promo stuff
I think that if you actually want to capture  the potential top speed of that F1 car, Red Bull should update the bodywork, particularly remove the rear wing and add a shark fin, kinda like what BAR Honda for the Bonneville Project, when they tried to make their car do 400km/h. With all the aerodynamic components that are on the RB7, I don't think we can see what top speed this car is capable of, and considering that such an upgrade has no effect on the budget cap, I don't see any reason for not going forward with this idea.  P.S. I would like to see this drag race happening in a couple of years, but with the RB16B(Verstappen's car) that time around instead of the RB7. I know Red Bull are not using their Turbocharged cars for their stunts, but this is just a drag race and it's just like a Race Start.
Tezos is the real king here!
Time for Rimac vs Tuned Lambo? 🔥
Absolutely magnificent Lambo
the first two races, the lambo defo jumped the starts.
First time seeing you in the middle 😂
The Lambo is Epic................
Isn't red bull using Renault engine in 2011?
Just. Insane.
There is a limit to what an old F1 car can defeat in a drag race. I mean it's rwd, medium tyres, made to go through the bends and subjected to restrictions due to regulations.
3:38 I've never seen Matt look so scared behind the wheel of a car 😅
If the lambo can get a little more power it will beat the rimsc on 1/4 mile
In..sane…
Its a good race, when the last one did the quater in 9.3 sec..
did he aay skyline?
6:49 Bruno X Spacc-Keverem beat.
this lambo insane
You OK hun? 😂🤣
Great video
Saludos desde la República Dominicana 🇩🇴
All about power-to-weight ratio ... thats why motorcycles murder cars.. 🙄😂
LLF Ricky’s R35 GTR is faster than all of these! (1900 bhp)
Pointless. F1 cars will eat anything in this world in the corners. These cars are made for drags only.
We need to see the Lambo vs Rimac Nevera vs Bugatti! Make it happen Mat 🔥🔥🔥
Geradeaus kann jeder. Fahr doch mal mit dem Lambo oder dem Nissan um's Eck.
LAMBO is .. 🐱‍🏍
Never mess with a lambo that has no bumper
A real competitor for the Tesla Plaid... man! I'm so proud of that Lambo! Literally burnt the drag strip
Nobody: Matt: Wow I just f*cked off!
Lamborgini vs nevera
I cant believe the lamb won you need to review it
Theres not Gtr price, but I guess its like half price of lambo 😁
When is that Lambo taking on a Rimac??!
Please redo this race replacing the Nissan with a Tesla Model S Plaid :-)
I don't know how you guys got DC with an RB F1 car into the game but well done. Over 1.3 million views in one day... Crazy...
Please do a video on how they can squeeze 750hp from a 2.4
Never challenge a Lamborghini with no rear bumper.
Don't try to race a rear naked lambo Just don't ever
Lol you looked properly terrified when the Lambo launched
gtr fanboys crying rn
Love the Helium Scream  🤣😂😂
Best drag race ever !
That GTR isn’t used to coming last 😂
I would like to see that lambo vs chiron vs remac nevera
O u r   YT  i s   m u c h   b e t t e r  -  U N S U P P O R T E D        E L E P H A N T   https://youtu.be/aEB-_b37ChI
This Lamborghini VS the Rimac Nevera!
14 year olds Jdm fans are crying rn
I'm surprised Matt not in the formula 1 car since he always try to pick the car that's most likely to win
Do a drag with Tesla Plaid
Holy s*** that Huracan is fast!
The gtr is only 0.6 seconds faster than a stock turbo s
That’s are cool assss! But I quite like comparing stock cars, and I would really like the sf90 and Chiron against each other if you can
That Lambo vs. Rimac Nevera!
Holy shit. That was amazing
Leave it to the loozer Matt Watson to always bring a crippled GTR
The lamb needs a roll cage and a three point harness
1320 video a awd turbo civic gapped a twin turbo Lamborghini lol
Matt deserves to be on the #2nd trending video BTW cool Comparison still Love GTR, even it lasts 😁.
Before I watch I bet the formula car is gonna win     I was wrong😂
The guy in the GTR has never launched a car before smh
Gtr would've won but it couldn't launch hard because of the driveshafts
We gotta to give some subs to reach 6M.
we hope see this Lamborghini much
Ultimate race. Hurican v10 biturbo vs rimac vs chiron. Make it happen Matt.
Semi automatic in the F1 car?
THERE IS NOT ANY CAR IN THE WORLD THAT INCLUDES BUG VER OR KONING OR ANY $10 MILLION DOLLAR CAR OUT BREAK AN F1 CAR
You should race that Lambo against a Bugatti Chiron!!
Nooo I wanted to see F1 Vs rimac
It's absolutely nuts that Lambo pulling ahead of the f1 all the way to the end, what would that thing do on a drag strip I wonder
A new killer for gtr guys
Can you Drive with a hybrid Formular 1 Car? That would be cool
So a £62.000.000 F1 car got smoked in a drag race and pull by a £220.000 Lambo Wow how the world has changed haha Loved it. I'm sure on a track its a different story but still impressive as was the GTR
This race Lamborghini was turned that is the reason F1 car is slow but it's awesome race
What the fuck !!!!!!
What a mess
لو عندك وسواس موت او نظافة او اي نوع وساوس تابع قناة اسمها هاني عرفة لعلاج الوسواس القهري وادعيلي 😍💕
Remember back when we were amazed by 10 second quarter mile times  Now literally minus by a second and then some 😭🤣🤣
Tesla faster!
I would love to see that lambo go against a Bugatti ...now that is what i would call ultimate drag race esp to 1 mile...😀
How much to buy that Lambo?
Wow, this is one of the most intense CarWow dragraces I have ever seen 😳😳😳
Please stop disgracing the f1 car.
Oh Jesus Christ,  that Lambo is sooo extremely fast😳
Y'all be choosing the worse examples Of Gtrs on this channel lol wtf. R35 isn't launching or pulling like A Gtr at that power usually would. Even Looks like stock suspension the front raises when it launches lol altho its still fast 😂
Wow that lambo will absolutely demolish the 1.000hp evolve M5 Competition
Mercedes Petronas in the next race 🏁⭐
The Lambo is fucking ugly without the rear bumper. And the F1 car is from 2011...
what in the world
You should race this lambo with the rimac
That Lamborghini is no joke mate look how it launches it’s literally a raging 😤 bull
Now those are Turbo S killers right there! Most insane drag race ever!
These drag races would be more fun if they had someone watching the vid to see if anyone jumped
Can we just appreciate these cars like holy cow they're all insane
.وين العرب
Mk4 supra vs tt huracan vs r34 skyline next
Wow. Blistering!
Like always jumping the start
2.4 Liter V8? Thats quite small!
I definitely wanna see a drag race between this monster 1200hp Lambo and a tesla model s plaid!
That lambo is insane🤯
Did  that green Lambo have traction control
Finally... A car that will shame the plaid model S
Koenigsegg 1:1 vs F1 car please
Who else thought F1 would win?
That Lamborghini is no joke 👊🏾💥💯
Mucho intro
The driver in  the GT-R should go to sleep because he not deserve it
Tesla Model S Plaid Vs. Rimac Nevera Vs. F1 Car
the small car make me laugh 😂😂
WOULD YOU PLEASE DO A DRAG RACE WITH   KAWASAKİ NİNJA H2R
oh wow !!!
I want to see the nevera in this race and I know that is possible in this channel. I love this channel 😍
Its a fast lambo damn.
Maybe Toto should give Botas the Lambo.
red preheated tires would be interesting on the f1 car, the traction is terribly bad.
lambo vs rimac...????
Do the F1 car Vs a civic with a laptop 👏👏👏
Audi❤️
PLZ review the mg zs
Mate…as soon as I saw the missing rear bumper on the Lambo I knew it was over for everyone 😂😂 that thing is mental
Wait till the sleeper GTR hits this channel. think it's like 1800BHP.
Daaaaaaamn that Lamborghini fast then bullet hahaha
220MPH? YOU CRAZY MATE?
That Lamborghini is insane
With a single turn, the F1 would destroy them.
calling the F1 gearbox an automatic gearbox never ages well :)
this lambo vs rimac nevera vs tesla plaid !!!
Review of Infinity Qx55
The lambo jumped before she put her hands down, the f1 and gtr started right on time.
One of the best video's yet !
The video I was waiting for
Further proof to never race against a Lamborghini without rear bumpers 😂.
That Lambo went Rambo.
Where are the 12 year olds
Do a race of rimac nevera and f1 plz
Newer F1 car would murder everything, but this content is golden.
So a gtr is almost as fast as a f1 car? I'm getting a gtr
7:56 😂😂
I think your pricing on the f1 car is ridiculous.. you can't determine its price based on the budget of the team for the respective year and divide it into the number of cars they made..
You jumped the first two starts Mat !
That lambo versus the rimac would be insane 😯🔥
Mad.
Who felt like slapping there head at the end?
They are some machines, but that Lamborghini 🤯
We need a Porsche turbo S vs that Lamborghini !!! Whose with me 👍👍
It's good to buy a tuned lambo then  buying a formula 1 haha
I love red bull racing. So nice of them to send out the car with david too. Red bull's my team Max all the way for the win this season.
Mat. You no longer award the king of the Carwow  track since you started racing all this tuned cars it appears. Pretty obvious.
Fake!
Matt you jumped the start twice
well bloody done matt, thanks to your brummy friend for the presence.
One of the best YouTube content ever. Thanks guys!
This Lambo vs Rimac Nevera!!
How was that for you David? If the team is happy, I am happy… …… Legend 😄
Lambo vs nevera!
Yes
Apakah ada org indo yg menonton 😂 .
stock GT-R is with 565 HP , but I did look race whan AMS GT-R ( Elk Grove , IL) try to break the world record . Thay did but 2 week after and the best time was 6.84 seconds .  But that GT-R has around 3500 HP .  Lambo can not race with the best GT-r prepared .
That Lamborghini against the 911 992 turbo
Rimac nevera vs Lambo
this.was.mental
Guys what you gonna pick no rear bumper hurucan or with slick tires hurucan?
Awesome,this is a piece of history, i don't like electric cars but i wish you repeat the the test with remac and lambo and f1, thank you matt, like that alot but next time put louis on f1 seat, god bless
I would like to see that lambo race against a Chiron!
Take the aero off the Red Bull see what happens
Forza suddenly looks so realistic
Rimac nevera vs F1 ⏱️
Wow
none of these cars can compete against the goat…..bmw 114d
thank you, red bull team, we love this races, and of course, thank you carwow for make it happen!!!
so is it faster then the porsche spyder?
Im never going to watch a formula 1 race again. Those cars are just too slow now :(
Who hear Cubano like)
Awesome race!  Would be really awesome to see some different exotic cars, like the Pagani, Koenigsegg Regera!!!
Lambo is 🔥
Never mess with a lambo with a bumper delete
Rimac nevera vs F1 car
Tezos
GT-R driver had sleeping pills before He come to race. 70,000 on the engine that's alot.
No wonder David was never even close
'Tuned' =/= Slapping twin turbos and tuning it 🤣
Guess mat didn't get fired after the last video
Where’s the TUNED 911 Turbo S??
Can't wait to have Ricky's gtr on here in the coming days
That naked Lambo just smoked the RBR F1 winning car by A LOT
Its a bit a low power gtr. Check ditch tuner: Total Car Concepts. Those have gtr's wilt more than 2200hp
Is it the DRS is on?
That was impressive..
I'm sorry, but I don't know, F1 and the twin Turbo lambo and gtr are fighting.
The F1 is the Honda in this race
Meaningless. Do it again with bends.
pls do a foot race with yianni
https://youtu.be/-h3ZURRkpw0
ThAt was a fast lambo
not surprised with the huracan traction off the line, but damn that pulling power must be ridiculous to experience, it kept putting car lenghts on that rb7 like it was nothing
This race gave me goosebumps! It was ABSOLUTELY INSANE!!! Great job Mat! We hope to see more drag races like this.
Let me race a downforce specific car in the one kind of race where downforce is more hurtful against two cars tuned to race this specific type of race. Garantee if you took off the front wing and reduced the since of the back wing significantly then the f1 car would blow them out of the water easily
The sounds are amazing 🤩
F1 vs Suzuki GSX-R 1000 Pls
Race the lambo against Dom's charger
QUESTION MATT CAN IT GET ANY BETTER👏🏼😍
Will the lambo outperform the f1 car in a race track?
That lambo is something else, can’t believe it’s traction off the line, it’s a bullet!
DC
Why are you flying? This should be drag race
A f1 car is a completely different car i think is not a good comparative , maybe vs a le mans will be a real versus
Cool race Mat!😸
Subscribe to the NDL and Niko Omilana or your breath stinks 😷
Nobody beats my Pacer! Except in your dreams....
Whichever company did the Huracan tuning did a great job
Nevera vs this Lamborghini
Gerald from clarksons farm driving the red bull?
Next race: Tuned Lambo vs comet Halley
From you see the missing bumper you should know💨
"Skyline" 🤣🤣🤣
F1 would obliterate these cars on a track
put a tesla in there hahahaha, will win all
So the Tesla Plaid model S would be on par with the F1, if I see it’s 1/4 mile numbers…
I miss the "I'm sat in.."
Matt is such a wuss. He always picks the car that's the strongest on paper, for a drag race.
Now race around a track lol
Lamborghini vs Bugatti
Toreto is proud!
Was that English when David was explaining 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 @4:24 and on
#2TRENDING
DMO’s E63 would be sick on a race
Insane 🔥🔥🔥
That huracan is absolutely nuts❤️
Put a model s with them
Bring DMO
I mean this with all the respect possible I'm tired of seeing these type of cars you need to bring the cars from the states our race cars from New York our 2000 horsepower GTR our 3000 horsepower Lambos. Then you will see a different. Matt Kimbo Gtr
It could match the rimac? 1,300 hp Gtr vs that lambo and rimac
How to beat an F1 car  Put David coulthard in it
W11 cs rimec c2 That would be amazing
Man that GTR is so fucking sexy
Who is driving the GTR ? i think he don't know how to drive
INSANE RACE 🔥🔥 OMFG THE RUSH ON MATT FACE WAS INCREDIBLE! Keep it like that I already subscribe to all the sponsors! 👍🏻🔥
Matt jumps most starts... very slightly. But still.
You should have included Murder Nova!
The moment you realize you finished a quarter mile in 9.3s but lost the race.
Putting the softest compound tire might help at the launch to the F1.
Now we want 80hp-100hp races
Next time: that Lambo vs. Tesla Model S Plaid
How does a 1300hp car get gapped that bad? The weight difference is not that much for how much the gtr lost by. I would expect it to be a much closer race but maybe not 🤷‍♂️
This tuned lambo vs chiron
Insane race matt. Love from sri lanka
62 million whuuuttt!?!?!? I never knew them formula 1 cars cost so much 🥴
Probably sounded like a pesky mosquito buzzing next to your left ear😂
This is epic.  The lambo is unworldly fast I assume on stock internals? But ugly as heck with the open back end.
"so, what exactly happened, well, the Lamborghini won" - Matt.  Also, Matt, you jumped twice
Next do a tuned E60 M5 I wanna see what that thing does with tunes
Everyone was so excited they couldn’t stop talking 😂
Nice but Bring new one f1 and see
So, how are those air filters going to cope with all the water being thrown up by those massive rear tires?
F1 driver started slow intentionally i can hear he revs lows
I really would like to congratulate you Matt for this videos!
Tesla plaid drag races mat pls
Two turbos is like a hack for racing
That’s fucked my brain !
TT lambo vs Rimac next!
Rimac Nevera vs Rimac
Imagine they were using the new f1 cars
Wow this was just mad!
Pfff, what a machine this Lambo is!! Straight out of hell!
David, open DRS next time pls.
For a F1 car, that wasn't really designed to go fast in a straight line( especially over a short distance) , it did really well, I'm quite surprised. On a side note, you know its not a normal drag race when the car that came LAST did  9.3 seconds on the quarter mile !!!
Definitely lambo has 400hp more from gtr in this race.. Stupid carwow
F1 limited revs :(
Wow Lambo!!!
Dislike semi slick tyres for lambo and normal road tyres for GTR.. hey cheater car wow the GTRs out there destroy lambos even with 100hp less..
Been waiting for this to be honest
Now i want Rimac vs This Lamborghini 🔥
My best video yet I'm full of goose bumps
Lamba - false start
how did 1200hp lambo managed to win against F1 when 1500hp bugatti chiron lost the race?
Me thinking that none of the street cars can even be close to the F1 car, and then seeing the lambo blow it out of the way.
GTR owners in shambles.
Matt: cmon cmon Me screaming: Lamborghini Italian accent (bye bye f1 car) Also me: mom I want a twin turbo Lamborghini Huracan RWD Matt: This is fun Me: ikr and I haven't been close to a Lamborghini in my life lol
70 bags? No way 🥱 two turbos, some welding, some pipe work, upgraded fuel pumps and injectors, boost control, dual wastegates and a tune etc shouldn’t even be touching 10k for that 🥱🥱🥱🥱
Any other day that GTR would be skelping any other car....that Lambo...my god.
It was an amazing race, I would like to see Tesla plate drag race
Best Race of the year !
I did not expect the F1 car to do so badly
Notice how Formula 1 teams never use any of the turbo-hybrid era cars.
This Lambo vs the SSC Tuatara vs the Rimac would be the best drag race ever.
Yianni must be creaming his pants watching a lambo beat an F1 car. 🤣
The Formula 1 Car sounds like a T-Fighter from Star Wars. I like it. But no one came on the idea to compare this Car with a Lambo on a Drag Strip. The Formula 1 Car is built for a Round Course not for maximum Accelerating. When you Do so, you must compare All this Cars also on a Round Course.
those sounds at 7:03 ..long live the ICE engines
Wow -  never thought a Lambo would win a F1 car.
that lambo is insaneeee
I would love to see another go, but this time. 1/4 mile, brake, make a tight turn, 1/4 mile back. :)
Jesko vs Rimac vs F1
Imagine Matt in a Calvo Viper
The F1 car did not use DRS....
The F1 car has been limited on revs as it goes up to 19,000 RPM and it wasn’t fully on tap but the other two cars are frighteningly fast
Model s plaid vs F1 and that same GTR please
Does anybody know if the F1 car had the back wing open ? cant remember the name for that
WE want a tuned 992 turbos s !!!!!
I wonder how a present model F1 car would fare against these cars!
Oh man..... How we miss the screaming F1 engines of old.
That Lambo is metal ... Insane race yet again Matt 👍👍👍
The v8 era is so missed. That sound is intoxicating
F1 fan boys r mad😂😂😂😂
THIS IS A SAVAGE RACE. Carwow can actually can make anything happen!
I'm lazy can some tell me which won?
Obviously the gtr was gonna lose, it literaly weight a small truck weight
this formula1 is not formula1 i cant believe 😔
Can’t imagine how much fun was that, even I was having fun seeing the video 🙌🏻loved it
Please bring down  tuned nissan patrol from Gcc
Good job nissan gtr.
Put that lambo against a tune m5
Rimac vs this Lambo!! Pleeeeeeeeeeezzzzzz
mat please do a 918 in one of these races
3:57 I really miss v8
try with the corners now :)
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
British christian bale is that you?
Tanner fox, range of cars 😂
911 turbo s vs this huracan vs rimac nevera))
👍👍👍
LOL i know when i got a lambo, bring it to Jurgen :-)
Dmo needs to race that lambo
Hmmm ... Red Bull needed DRS
Now I know that f1s are not made for drag racing
Broo call toto…
Well, they say they want F1 to be more cost-efficient. So just buy some 150k Lambos and be set. Corner speeds are going to suck badly, but they could recover some of that on the straights :p
Who tf disliked this video????
WTF when Lambo💎 🚀
i guess f1 car needs better tires , he kept losing traction
Now i think that the UGR lambos may be faster than the Rimac Nevera
Not a Nismo.
Hey matt, Can Rimac beat a lambo..
Not at nismo
I've seen matt nervous 2 times only, first in dodge demon he was scared as hell , as it keeps on spinning wheels and second this time in tuned lambo.   HATS OFF TO THE TEAM WHO  TUNED THAT LAMBO.
Keep any small pets and light loose furniture away from the rear end of that Lambo, anything small will be sucked into those turbos 💨💨 😂😂
1200 pounds of talllllkkkkkkkkkkkkkk lmaooo
Rimac nevera vs F1 car drag race
that lambo 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Next time: 9ff !! 🔥💪😎
One of the best Drag Race ever!
Now it's time for race this Lambo with nevera and Chiron ❤️
Rimac VS lambo!!!!!
I don't understand how come carwow never use gtr alpha 16 that would destroyed the lambo and that f1 💯💯💯
Drs
Why does he not open his wing for more speed?
I want to see drag race between  kawasaki h2r vs that tt huracan , also rimac nevera oh how I forget about  that,
That twin turbo Lamborghini can beat the Bugatti Chiron
Brilliant video, more like that please !
God damn.  The sound of an F1 engine is eternal bliss!!  That thing screams like a demon on fire being chased by Vampires on crack!!
Can you bring Ferrari F-2002 or F-2004?
As people say.... 3 cars you don't wanna race are: 1. A Huracan with no rear bumper 2. GTRs that sounds "stustustu" 3. Possibly....an F1 Race Car.
Let’s see the Remac nevara vs the twin turbo lambo but maybe something 1200+hp that’s insane
352 km/h in 1 mile... this huracan is INSANE
Mat the 2011F1 car is irrelevant now u should of used the Mercedes from the 2019 year🤦🏾‍♂️
R34 1200 hp would do this better
A tuned viper would be a very good match with that lambo
Tezos ❤️
That Lambo is Olimpian Medalist 🥇
“Some say he has a MASSIVE chin… and he does because it’s david coulthard” -clarkson
That turbo lambo is a MONSTER!!
Can't you get a more modern F1 car ? That one is over 10 years old. It's like the Windows XP of F1 cars !
please mat... this lambo vs rimac nevera 😊😊
Very rare to see an F1 car fall to road cars..... It was wet though, makes a big difference to 2WD!
Maaan! A Supra is needed there!!!!
Thats was just nuts! Love these crazy matchups!  Matt, that lambo was fast enough to go up against the Plaid and leave it in the rearview, for that matter, bring back the nevera as well to see how hyper ICE does against hyper electrics
3:28 drag starts
F1 braking is on a whole 'nother level!😅
I think we all need that Lambo to face off against the Rimac innit
1M in the blink of eyes !
The GTR driver keep sleeping at starting point.lol
Ge the 919 porsche LMP vs the Rimac
We need to see an HGP Golf R and an Porsche 911 turbo
This huracan vs the rimac
Yes respect the Lamborghini  but I still love the GTR.Lambo weight is less sits lower to the ground and wind resistance is very low compare to the Gtr with its suv height and not properly dialed in for the 1300hp so yes the Lamborghini will win still Gtr any day ☺👍
King Lambo 🥇
Should probably wear a helmet....
The guy in the GTR is driving it like a bitch
And that was just a normal tuned TT Huracan, imagine the UGR TT Huracan X-Version with 2000+ whp a fucking monster. I woul freaking love to see that against the insanely diabolical HOONICORN!!! 🥵🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥 hoooolyyyyy sshhhhh******
Mat is an idiot,  but in a good funny way!!  Love the video!!  Omg once the gtx gets a large weight reduction.  It will be the new Godzilla again!! It still did a great job
Get a real formula 1 car with 1050 hp or the 1500 hp old version and then race them
I wonder if people know that these are not the latest f1 cars lol that the new hybrids 1000hp would just fucking rape anything .
This is the best race of this channel.
TT LAMBO VS RIMAC NEVERA 🤞😍
could you possibly find a tuned Ferrari and we can have a drag race  ferrari vs Lamborghini
That's Lamborghini is just a beast.. Because of that Lamborghini I watched the videos twice and I'll keep watching it.. The amount of thrust that lambo has it has just blown me away😍 I hv no word's for that lambooo
GTR fanboys punching the air right now 🤣🤣🤣
The sheer look of terror on Mat's face as he launched the lambo :D
Thks Jesus,none of them are a shitty diesel
That Lambo is like a fighter jet an absolute weapon!
jdm kids crying
What if the F1 car had 1100 hp 😳
£62 million dame redbull gave you that car woooow
I would like to see this Tuned Lambo, vs the Rimac vs Tesla model S Plaid
It goes from crazy to outrageous
I'd like to see this done with a rolling start - drag races are great, but 9 times out of 10 you're already moving when 'fun mode' starts
Matt actually got a quicker launch reaction to a retired F1 driver
Everybody talking about the lambo, it's a TUNED lambo
Love the huracan would definitely choose the huracan but i think that gtr needs a better tuner cause it has the power on the low end and the top end but kinda bogs down in the middle 🤷
Best one yet....
Who we are: carwow fans! What do we want: a drag race between that Lambo and a Rimac Nevera When do we want it: now!
Imagine paying $62.5m to get walked by a tt huracan
That Lamborghini vs the new model s plaid PLEASE
Lambo vs Rimac?
Avoid the lambo with the rear bumper delete 😂😂😂
Matt - Great race! Would love to see DB11 on the track..
Buzz said the gear box wasn't standard on a vid the other day?? Was also coy on putting a BHP figure on it and reluctantly said 1200
That Lambo though🙆🏿‍♂️
How about trying a newer hybrid F1 not an old spec 750bhp  F1…
07:13 when the misses got home early and sent a risque text message
do that rimac car with this lambo
Try the tesla model S Plaid vs the lambo or the F1 Car
Ooo my God this is too much fun It's fantabalous sir
On a full lap they wouldn't see where the F1 went. Braking and cornering being totally different league.
Wow TT lambo 😍
Duh Mat race against W11 it’s the fastest F1 car ever ..
ABSOLUTELY POSITVELY GET THAT TT LAMBO WITH THE NEW TESLA PLAID ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY
Matt "the frog" Watson
You should have brought the GTR R34 Supra Mk4 and the Rx7 too that would have been insane
Singh is King!
Helmet Marko: Max would’ve driven that quarter mile 2 tenths faster
rimac nevera vs the tuned lambo
GTR 1300hp hhhhhhh
GTR for me
Lamborghini vs rimac
Well, I didn't expect that outcome, well done Mar!
This Lambo vs Bugatti Veyron
This Lambo vs Bugatti Veyron
This Lambo vs Bugatti Veyron
This Lambo vs Bugatti Veyron
It would be good to see a drag race of some rare and or exotic super/hyper cars (stock) vs each other and a Ducati Superleggera V4 (cuz that’s super rare too)
*Chiron vs f1 rematch with good driver*
Best race to date, no more to be said 👍
This Lambo vs nevera please
and first time i swa matt was afraid of this speed
Damn, that Lambo is no joke
The 3rd was a true reflection, as Matt jumped the start first 2 times
Love the crazy comparisons. Keep up the good work
that lambo was fucking fast.......oh ono oh no...what i have seen now, was just incredible.......
Those lambos are nasty when tuned.
Yes you jumped the start.
Find golf 2 vr6 turbo
The fact the F1 has almost half of the Hp than both just imagine if it had the same Hp as the others...no way those street cars would keep up and the aerodynamic is Insane given the fact it’s a 2008-2012 model F1....just imagine a 2021 model
Lambo still sounded better
Seriously, out of the three starts the only one where he didn't jump the start was the third. I propose a rule for carwow where the driver who jumps the start gets a bitchslap. Also, whose genius idea was to put an f1 car with slick tyres in a drizzling weather?
If only The lambo didn’t cheat the two times… launched early on both
Italian car >>
I don't usually comment but damn that Lambo doesn't play around.
F1 in drag race? try next time topfuel cars...
Never mess a Lamborghini with no rear bumper
f1 car vs nevera when
The TT huracan its just overkill 😮
Any chance of getting a Underground version C lambo hurricane vs rimac? And do it over quarter and half mile, would be an amazing race as it’s the fastest petrol car vs fastest food blender with 4 wheels
Insane. Carwow definitely winning 🙌🏾
I think if it was dry the f1 car might have won because the Lamborghini had 4wd
Yianni would have enjoyed that lambo! What a monster!
Uau! 🇧🇷 Huracan is insane!
That lambo on a bone dry day with a good launch would give the Rimac nevera a good run for its money
The best lambo
The f1 sounded like it has 15 speeds haha
It would be nice if you gave the 0-100 and 100-200 times 🙂
He jumps the start clearly but the Lamborghini IS faster
MATTTT.... THIS IS SO INCREDIBLE😲
Holy shit that lambo
Imagine doing a 1/4 in 9.3 seconds and still losing. Or imagine having a 62.5 million car and still losing to a 150k car
We didi not ask for this race. However, we go it... Ladies and gentlemen,  Merry Christmas !!!
Wtf that huracán goes faster from 50mph to 120mph than my car goes from 60km/h to 100km/h 😂😂😂
This lambo vs model 3 performance drag race would be amazing race to watch 🔥
Whattt 8.9s😳😳😳😳😳MAT DM ME ON INSTAGRAM I JUST WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE MODS ON THAT HURACAN.....
60000hp American trucks next 😂😂😂😂😂
mmmm , well one is a downforce machine, and two are actual cars.
I mean the huracán is already a very fast car being N/A, putting 2 big turbos on it like damn 🔥😂
that lambo just fucks off
These 3 plus the Rimac
I expected yanni to be driving the lambo. 😥
I’ve been waiting for this video
That huracan vs Rimac Nevera
David forgot to ask "give me full power"
Destroy the like button for the YouTube algorithm 😂...  Carwow is the benchmark. Great work.
That Lamborghini could take the rimac nevera😨
Do the plaid vs the Lamborghini. The best plaid 1/4 mile is 9.08 i belive
Hey , who else wants to see this green lambo against rimac nevera ?? 😱
this  Lamborghini Huracan  vs  Rimac Nevera 😏
The gtr is not far from the others.... and you can put 4 people.... insane race !
Never underestimate a lambo with no rear bumper
Buzzy singh just buzzed the fuck out of that lambo omfg
It’s me or idk but I think the GTR has a stock exhaust, stock exhaust with 1300hp 😂
where the break test at m8?
one of the best episodes so far!
I wonder if Matt is too scared to race the 911 against the F1 car or maybe redbull won't allow it because it'll blow past it lmao
An engine is a Air Pump. 5.2 liter vs 3.8 & 2.4 Liter all tuned to the maximum.
The Lambo vs Rimac Nevera
F1 winner
Porra !! Essa huracan tá insaana.
Matt was not expecting that lambo to go like that unreal launch 😳
In most drag races can we see the drivers swap cars so to even it up more
An engine is a Air Pump. 5.2 liter vs 3.8 & 2.4 Liter all tuned to the maximum
When are you going to bring the M5CS and the 918?
Cmon matt... firstly you need an actual driver in that gtr and to have it on race fuel and not pump lol... Grandad was fully asleep behind the wheel haha
The RB can go a good bit quicker.  Engine turned down and serious lack of traction plus a sprinkle of rain. Low 8s more like it on a good day maybe into the high 7s.  On DCs first run he was spinning the wheels well into the 1/8th!  That said the Lambo is totally insane and I am not quite believing that its 1200... I suspect more.
That lambo was close enough to beat the rimac nevera 🔥🔥 also.. did the gtr beat the sf90 's time??
Maybe try to get a modern f1 car on there, one with ers, they’re a lot faster than the 2011 cars
Why is the Nissan GT-R in this video? It's a relic that was cool 10 years ago. I would much rather see a McLaren, Porsche, Ferrari, etc.
These cars sounded fucking insane
First twin turbo Lamborghini that actually impressed me but ill still go GT-R any day
OMG LAMBORGINI F1 !!!!
VAG drives 👍👍
Ending is a laughing scenario
Is matt becoming good driver or the lambo is just too fast??
please put 0-60 times of the cars on scren after the race
Hei bro pls race bmw m5CS vs audi rs7 or r8
That lambo is litrally lit🤘🤘
The f1 was on hard tires tho
Do a lap around a track then we can see what really is possible  🤔
I would love to see a rimac against all those !  Just wow carwow
F1 car vs rimac
pls rimac vs lambo :)
Really Insane race❤️❤️🔥🔥🔥
I watch all these videos…but still don’t know what a naturally aspirated engine is 🤣
Turbo honda civics*
Tune in next week when Darth Vader races the enterprise
That Lambo is on another level... 😳
U should put softs on f1 car
Now….let’s race all 3 cars against a top fuel car….that would be a slaughter fest……just do it….🤣🤣🤣🤣….put all three cars on a race track and see who wins that one…those two pigs could not even come close to the cornering speeds of the F1 cars….any one can go fast in a straight line…no skill needed…and in the end …the space shuttle takes the win @ 17,000 mph….beat that number….!!!
Tesla model s Plaid vs formula car
Would've loved to have seen a stretched H2 in this race
haha Mat definitely jumped the start😂
At 6:01 LMAO😂
Since this Lamborghini has broken below the 9 second mark, this calls for Rimac race😁😁😁
1200 hp lambo VS Rimac
Which RB car was this exactly?
Dont scroll down there are spoilers in the comments 😂😂😂
I never thought the lambo could beat the F1
DC screwed all of the starts though.
F1 cars are so loud. He can hear it even inside a Lamborghini
WoW insane how the Lambo can put all that massive power into the ground and traction, awesome!! That F1 was like a toy... Good job carwow, i love this content :D
Carwow really is becoming the modern day top gear
Ha ha Mat looks genuinely scared 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Next time Lambo 1200 hp vs  RIMAC NEVERA
That thing sounds like $63,000,000
Damn! I just gained an inch of girth watching this!
Nissan gtr with your coin money
Best drag race Lamborghini 8.9sec
Team Checo Perez  Red Bull gives you wings..
Can you imagine running the Tesla plaid against these.
Wow! Just Wow! 💥🔥😍
Hi Matt!! Did you drive a 1200 bhp Huracan with the TPMS light on??? WTF!!! Hello from Sant'Agata Bolognese. I m the Road Test Manager in Lamborghini. I would like you to visit us in our plant. Ciao!
The brake test really shows have impressive an F1 car is
We all here to see if GTR can beat Lambo or not
That Rift exhaust system on the Lambo.😍
Gtr isn’t slow.. still faster thn many fast cars
I was rooting for the gtr all things considered
The F1 car isn’t designed to drag race. That lambo is. Let’s see them race on the track
This Lambo vs Rimac Nevera
that's not 1200 HP, it's upwards of 1800...!!
If you think this Lambo is fast, wait until you see some of the 2000hp and 3000hp Lambos people have made. They would make all of these cars look like they are standing still.
These ain’t crap compared to UGR Lambos, Calvo Viper, or Texas Killer R35
Does that make that Lambo the fastest car seen on Carwow?? The rimac had 8.65 right?
I wanna see that lambo against a rimac
Really wish we could see an RB1 with the cozzy v10...im too young to have heard the V12s in person but i do remember going to some races the last year of the Jag R5 going into the RB1 and wow the sound was incredible and had over 900 Hp at like 19k rpm. I then remember the next year they all were not sounding as cool at the track and my dad complaining about the F1 rules lol. They also lost almost 200hp.
That GTR definitely got no 1300HP
I’d take a slower mid-engine Lambo over a quicker GTR any day.
That lambo against the Rimac would be the next Level 😉
It's not very impressive when you think about how limited the F1 car actually is in comparison to the others.  Both the other cars are purpose built for straight line acceleration and top speed with no limits. The F1 car is built to maintain performance as efficiently as possible throughout an entire race circuit with restrictions. While it's entertaining to watch its not a realistic comparison. The same would be true if they had a drag car competing on a road course. Both cars appear superior when in reality the F1 cars purpose and design make it inferior for this type of comparison.
Tesla model s plaid vs f1
I want to see the Evija in a drag race.
Replace the Gtr with a tuned turbo s 991
Whaat in the fuck
We want rimac vs that lamborgini
We need llf gtr car against that lambo!!
I wanna see that Lambo versus the Rimac Nevera
This was the best drag ever MATT... CONGRATULATIONS
Just waiting for the Porsche 992 modded to 1000hp
8.9 1/4 mile....just wowzers
That Lambo!! 😮🤤
Next vid should be 1200hp lambo vs rimac nevera
That lambo is fucking nuts
Bloody funny video!!
This is waaaaaay better than the Fast & Furious F9
That formula 1 car was an older one im thinking. If possible get the newest one with the most current performance. Still very impressive for that Lambo to man handle a real race car.
GTR needs a better driver 😭😭😭
Fake!! F1 changed 13 speed?  Poor Videomontage...
"tuned Lamborghini" lmaooo
I could predict every race including the braking. 1500lb 750hp F1 car designed for track racing is going to have trouble out of the hole, but stop super quick with better brakes, and lighter weight. Put some turns into that race, and the F1 wins every time!
Imagine if the f1 car was AWD
Better we can see the speedometer
Imagine running a 9 second quarter mile and coming dead last 😄
Still slower than Rimac :p
I cant wait to see that Lambo against Rimac
You guys do know that the Tesla model S plaid completes the quarter mile in 9.1 right??? And it’s a bloody family car!!!
Lol gtr had shit street tire mitchelins it looks like.  Lamborghini had nice sticky r compound r888r tires.  Helps big time with sticky r compound tires below 100mph.
Lambo jumping start
If this comment get 1450likes.. carwow will have a old 90's GTI hot hatch race!
😱🥶
Ok, now do a road course.
The F1 doesn't have enough HP, but I surprised how bad the GTR did.
Building something fast in a straight line is relatively easy compared to fast on a track.
I really thought that GTR would have it but that Hurucan is just insane
Lmao DC, the Lambo didn’t run out of puff did it?
Didn't the RB7 have DRS? Not sure why he isn't opening up that wing.
This lambo should race the rimac nevera
In america, the land of the free, and the home of the brave, we spell the name with 2 t’s. Watson’s name is what we wipe our shoes on before we come in the house.
Jeep Grand Cherokee TrackHawk please 😭😭😭
Instead of two radios to countdown rolling races, could you have like  some indicator lights in all cars to ready drivers at the press of a button?
If the red bull had ss tires it would have won
Do drag race with 1,500 hp Supra to beat the F1 car and that Lambo 😂🤣
reasons for winning:  anticipating the arms dropping same torque but 3-400 kg lighter than the nissan wich is on factory suspension and overal setup. F1 car power to weight ratio helps alot, but it cant get all that power down from standstill and above 200kph the aero works against it on the straight. so the aero only works between 80-200 on a straight, to help keep the power on the wheels, after that it just limits the car with drag.  you didnt jump the start at all, but the other drivers just waited for the arms to almost fully drop.
Have Red Bull put in several complaints against Carwow??... I didn't see Mat push the Red Bull off the track??? I can imagine dickheads, Christian Horner and "Helmet" Marko deeming Mat's victory as "hollow"
this first time i see Matt scared xD  please get Mazda 787B
Mat Watson is a virgin
THIS IS LIT
Your F1 car cost is wrong....
Где то Гордей прослезился
Do an F1 vs Rimac
was the f1 car on hards not ultrasoft
this race went insanely crazy 🔥
GTR reaching the quarter mile in 9.3 seconds. LAST place. Okay 👌
That f1 car sounds epic!!!
that was insane haha
TT Lambo is no joke
Well I was completely wrong...
Lambo 💉
Plz make video with yiannimize plz
DC one of the favorite F1 driver ❤
I LOVE these kinda races 😍😍😍😍😍
Wish to see LLF GTR compete in a drag race near future .
Let's have a race between Rimac and Lambo :D
Jurgen knows his stuff need rickys gtr on there
put those f1 tires on soft :(((
9 second race. 40 second footage from Mats car, only at Carwow
im a GTR fan but just like they said, dont race a lambo without a rear bumper
AWESOME!!!!
Now put them in a track.. F1 smashes everything
❤️❤️
Next Video : Rimac V 1200hp Lamborghini
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Jesus Christ wtf is happening at carwow holy
I’ll be enormously curious for the Tesla plaid V roadster V Rimac or  RS6 V 911 V and something else on a wet surface
2004 Ferrari  (8.6s)Vs 2005 Porsche 919 LMP Car (8.3s) Vs Rimac Nevara  Will be awesome awesome
LLF skyline GTR  Rimac  Plaid tesla
Maybe the huracan can beat the nevera.. testt pleaseeAaa
It's a shame there's no V10 or v6 hybrid F1 car. The result would have been very different!
me love gtr😍
Goose bumps when hearing all exhaust sounds 😍🤩😍🤩😍🤩😍
Need to get that lambo against a Bugatti 😱
So, how many horsepower that lambo need to beat the rimac?
That lambo is fucking fast, more pls of that lambo vs super cars
632 peoples finger slipped and hit thumbs down on accident.  Bc there's no way a real car person doesnt absolutely love this race
Who the hell tuned that GT-R 😡?
Jm imports is too modest , why not bring project tango or Llf rickys gtr ?
I’m waiting for the people that are gonna be trigger because the gtr was last place🤣
Model S Plaid be like: hold my vegan green broccoli juice... wait where's my steering wheel?
Hi, yesterday I watched your video where you buy your mom an electric car. I just looked in Russian, I want to tell you you have a very cool mother. It is clear why you have achieved what you have. sorry for my translation). good luck and hello from Belarus
So.. Weight/power ratio is everthing
This is the most insane drag race i've ever seen 🔥
Wow, two of them are slightly faster than the off the showroom floor 5 seat family car from Tesla 😂🤣😂
Yassssss
Hi guys, could you please try and do the lamborghini sian sometime? I really want to find out how quick it is.
Fun thing is than the lambo was quicker than the bugatti veyron... carwow should make a drag race of all 10 and sub 10 second cars, with all those cars like a bugatti, f1, tuned audis, porsches etc...
That F1 was screaming like my dogs hunting down a deer!. wow carwow! that Lambo was madness with its large intestines showing from the back
Throw in a 1600hp supra in there too. Supras get a lot of attention.
3rd time lucky for not jumping the start Matt lol
A bit pointless to be honest the f1 car is running on tyres for a track not for a 0-60 sprint. For me the Lamborghini has been ruined, if you want a fast car in a straight line that’s over 1,000bhp buy a veyron.
Look like f1 more safer
Did i just see the best YouTube video ever?🤯 quien más de México 🇲🇽 sigue este canal??✌🏻✌🏻
*HURACAN IS BROKEN FAST*
He jumped the start twice omg
We need a drag race between that Lamborghini and a Kawasaki Ninja H2R.
absolutly love all three cars, but ill always stay true to my god(zilla) ;)
Its a insane race, but I really wanted the Remac Navera to be with in this race to see the true speed on it, u tried it with normal cars not as crazy as these 💯
"If the team is happy, im happy." The most experienced sentence he could say.
Mat you are god!!
Can't believe the f1 car lost with the lambo but won against a bugatti
Best Race Till Date
Now go around corners :D
That lambo is mental.
waiting for es motors to bring the porsche 911 992 turbo s with 1000 hp
And that kids is why you never pick a fight with a Lamborghini without a rear bumper
Great video!  That Lambo vs Nevera vs F1 vs Koenniggseg One:1
Por favor
Where is the Tesla model s plaid?
GTR vs Lamborghini vs bugatii
استغفر الله العظيم
TT lambo is the king of streets but that r35 R.I.P
Can you do the new Porsche Cayenne gt vs lambo urus vs Audi sq8 plz. Would love to see it happen. See who the king of suv
Yani is  proud of u 😂
Does it still count when you put 2 turbo's on it, and tear the rear off the car?
A super well produced video EVERY DAY? You are 1, hard working dude!! Thank you 😻
The lambo completely aniahlated them both good job....
We need a Rimac vs TT Lambo
This is the best drag race that carwow do until now. Just insane.
The Hoonicorn vs this Lambo.
note to self: never even try racing a lambo with no rear bumper
Lambo has race tires but GT-R is on street Michelin tires there will be a big change if gtr had same tires
the new corvette z06 sounds like that f1 car somehow
It would’ve been interesting to see the tuned 911 turbo S with these
TT Lambo vs Rimac Nevara?
Matt legit jumped the start the first 2 times doesn’t really matter that Lamborghini is insane but still would have been more entertaining if he didn’t jump start twice
just seen that hurican on llf channel got smoked by rickys 1600 hp gtr
Matt is on another league when it comes to incredible car content 👌👌👌👌
Most intense drag race I've seen
Bring some 3000hp GTR
so the tunned lambo is faster than  chiron  !!!!
and now a lap with corners... F1 car 1st place, the other 2: 30 seconds behind...
Best drag race ever bitchh
Ahora una carrera en silverstone.
F1 redbul rb16
Why doesnt somone else just call in the rolling race instead of Mat accelerating with no hands on the wheel
People can't beat that tune twin turbo
David is still a true professional!
That huracan is twin turbo same engine and r8 have audi r8 twin turbo
that Lambo VS Rimac nevera would be incredible
I love Lamborghini 😍😍😍
Literally reads all 7+k comments and no mentioning of that GT-R 🤨🤔😂🤣 Lambo wins the comment sections
Wow ...I Loved The Lambo...💚
Whoever disliked this wasn't supposed to watch this in the first place
Holy hell that huracan
Red bull fans will cry about this too 🤣🤣🤣
I need to see that Lamborghini race the new Tesla but this is the most important race I see
That F1 car is INSAAANEEEE!!!!
No way f1 car not to be the first. Bs video!
Now do that lambo vs a model s plaid
we would want you to get that supra  ---> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpeNox1pSMM  with these toys and see
5:43 live the moment with mat C mon OMG OMG it s so close 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
That was no Formula 1 car, it was a giant mosquito
220mph (354kmh) was insane 🔥
Where's the SUPRA ‽
the lambo is mental  what if... that lambo vs tuned audi r8 vs rimac (if possible)
Model S Plaid vs Taycan Turbo S next please.
Never challenge race an lamborghini with no bumber😬
I listen to it and i piss myself
Yanny is definitely happy watching this video 😂
Cold tires on the F1 car…
Whoever was driving the GTR doesn’t know how to drive… theres no way a 1300whp 1290trq GTR is losing that bad…
Wow
You should take the Ferrari f2004 for tests Or the Mercedes w11 EQ Performance
This lambo is really really nuts....
Power, weight and traction wins every time.
Now, add Tesla Model S Plaid. Game on
Man That sound, is a monster
Nothing like gapping an F1 car.
You amaze us in every drag race. Where this gonna stop ?? Keep it up plz
Wanna also see this Lamborghini against the 2000 house power electric car !!
put them on a track, and the equation will change to put the GTR and the LAMBO to shame
Can we all just take a second to deep that the gtr came last with a quarter mile time of 9.3 seconds.... wtffffff
Mental ! // enough said.
I think it adds 2 hp when he says come on !.
This channel been doing legendary drag series. Salute to everybody
Rimac vs that crazy lambo please!
Next video: Jet powered truck vs. F1 car vs. Elon Musk’s rocket ship
0:04 im sorry but thats ugly
Please I wanna see this Lamborghini against the blue Bugatti
Current F1 car would eat them in those races.
1st start was perfect... 2nd he jumped
OMG that Lamborghini was nuts!!🔥❤️ Go ahead and race her with Rimac Navera!
Was DRS active on the F1 car?
Gtr is the dodge challenger of Nissans
The F1 won based on sound alone, forget the race🏎
very good videos, I would like a video where this rimac fridge vs bugatti vs lambo 1200hp
Sooooo we need the Lambo against the Rimac now 😁😁😁
Get that Rimac back to race the Lambo...
Exact same race with rimac nivera
Oh Matt....this Lambo are 🤪
and then the Tesla Plaid showed up 😳 😳
That Lambo is ridiculous!! 🏎💨🤣🤣
Love it more stuff like this please! Maybe get them doing laps somewhere too so its not just about outright power! 🤩
most beautiful sound of formula 1 cars… not like the boring ones today
I want lambo Vs Bugatti after f1 defeat
Le couple de la f1🤔🧐🧐🧐🧐
Pity you didn't have a tuned kawasaki h2 in the race ,good race though
I can hear david everytime he is in vid say "The team is happy I'm happy"
Thanks Mr Watson for doing the vdub fans justice. Celebration $tr888 🔝💪🏽🇯🇲…….
Thanks Mr Watson for doing the vdub fans justice. Celebration $tr888 🔝💪🏽🇯🇲…….
yo guys, remember when the 911 992 Turbo S was the king. Yeah.
Please make 3 cars in this video race on Circuit
We want sleepers
I'm shocked after seeing the F1 lose 💔
I see what DMO Deejay means now. Mind boggling drag race.
a good rival for Rímac
8 second lambo???!!!!🤯🤯🗿
8.9 seconds with 1200hp lambo than a bit faster TT lambo might beat the rimac in a quarter mile
What a way to end off July! That Lambo can deny Mercedes an 8th championship. Hope Redbull took notes.
It shows that you dont want to race againts lambo without rear bumpers.. it smashed F1 car OMG
Nothing in this world beats TT Lambos. Fact.
first time Mat is winning with a other car than a tesla lol...
7:11 who said men can't multitask
F1 is just embarrasing. Getting beat by a roadcar even if it´s tuned.
Lambo vs Rimac 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
that lambo was .2 seconds off the Rimac? Thats awesome to know that electric cars arent necessarily the fastest
How is the F1 car so slow?
The f1 car had lots of weelspin
No one expected the Lamborghini to win! We all thought F1 would.
Can’t believe F1 didn’t win
You looked soooo scared :))
Please stop these videos. Drag race everywhere! The quality of a car is not on a drag race. Go on a track and will see.
Wow the f1 car is actually slow now. Maybe they should get the hybrid ones for the next test.
Jesus Christ that Lambos fast
Please get in touch with Chris from bike world YouTube channel, and ask him to bring a superbike, I would love to see that collaboration
Lambo twin turbo vs rimac nevera 🤘🏻
Without the tt on the lambo the f1 car wouldve won
OMG car wow is so close to hit 6 million subscribers
İ believe th F1 didint find the second gear.
Note: avoid racing lambos with no rear bumper
I love seeing Matt so frightened by the Lambo's power. All haill the Lambo TT
Wow that F1 car did way better than I thought it was going to do
i want f1 car vs rimac
This lambo is way more than 1200hp, more about 1600hp
You can't jump 2 out of 3 starts and be this happy with the wins! Rigged lol!
That gtr is trash
What?!!....i expected what exactly happened..😒
The nowadays rare sound from the F1 car is just awesome
They should have done 0-60 and 70-0 of F1 cars
What do I need to do to own a Lamborghini🙄
Tesla Roadster be like hold my beer
Muy buen video Lambo power
legend has it that the Lambo is so fast it lost its pant
Insane trucking speeds... that lambo is crazy
Rimac Nevera Vs Lambo as soon as possible 😃
The fact that this channel managed to land RBR along with DC himself is just incredible
Increíble ese lambo 😍😍😍
nice
The race I was waiting for before even I watch it
That was bad ass!!! Big thank you guys!! Y’all ROCK!!
How sad for the f1 car
They did 8.62 sec with the Rimac, Lambo 8.9
Don’t ever mess with a twin turbo Lamborghini Huracan
You need to explain to other drivers when to actually take off .. you can see they wait for the arms to touch the sides while you leave the second they start to drop … the lambo would still beat the Nissan but you can see he is shat off the start and just ruins the race for your fans
FYI Lambos over read
If only Lamborghini make a huracán twin turbo for production car I think it could beat the rimac nevera
Why isn't the f1 car on softs? 🤔
I heard some people say buy a stock turbocharged engine car for more tuning potential. I am sure they are wrong now.
Come on Pirelli, get David the soft tires
Next time get a proper build GTR so you see how it will beat all.
Wait the gtr is a v6
9.3s for a 1300hp gtr. Sry not buying this.
Because many huracan turbo do not have a rear bumper. turbines seem inside, is it a fact of heat?
i just need to see an AMG SLS  Vs 458 Vs lambo gallardo Vs R8 V10 2011
When a 9 second GTR looks slow
I was already scared of lambos in my sonata  new fear unlocked: lambos with their bumpers off 🥵
I'd like to see a review of the f1 car
Ohh that screaming V8 F1, I had an orgasm
THIS IS INSANE 😍😍
That lambo is f***ing mental
Always cheating at the start 🙄
Why the fuck did you not do a full mile drag race???
Jesus christ. That Lambo is insane. TT Lamborghini has always been a force like no other
There were 2 Bulls there, one Red and another raging 🤣
the best drag race i've ever seen ❤❤
1300hp gtr and it’s last lol
We need a race of the Ramic Nevera and that Lambo!!!
Slowest gtr ive seen over 1000hp
Matt jumpstarts on first 2 drag races
Damn.  The Huracan with turbos is NO joke, that's to be certain.
That damn lambo😱🔥
Please, bring some NFS-like car with nitro installed. Those childhood dreams... cheers
We want to see Ricky’s GTR from LivingLifeFast vs the Formula 1 and the Rimac Nevera !
I say that lambo vs. That new Rimic electric car.. Clash of the titans !!
What’s the 0 to 60 mph on the lambo?
I mean does pretty well for a small v8 turbo
I'm unable to overcome Lamborghini performance, each time i think about Lamborghini, i'm replaying again again and Mat face was like Mr.Ford in Ford vs Ferrari, trying Ford GT for 1st time and start to crying...
That lambo had that man scared to death.  Did you see the 50-100. 7:10
Thanks to years of conservative and strict regulations from the FIA, a STREET CAR, with an AC, a STEREO and a ROOF has wiped the f ing floor with a modern day F1 car HAHAHAHAHAHAA. what an utter embarrassment holly sheeet.
Can you do a review for this lambo?
Wr want This lambo and rimac
Weird pitch: THIS Lambo, F1 Car and Rimac Nevera
Carwow becoming more BOSS with each video
Fake drag race matt always wins
And the Nissan Gtr was last, completing the quarter mile in 9.3 seconds.   WHAAAAAAAT!!!??
@carwow do 1200 hp Lamborghini vs Rimac Nevera vs The F1
This Lamborghini deserves to meet the Rimac
we wanna see this against a moto gp bike
9:26 when the end of online classes
try 1200hp f1 to that 1200hp lambo!!
Are we not gonna talk about how the f1 car is rwd and it’s also raining?
Yeah... Wait till a corner comes... there you'll see where the 62kk are :D
Ok now I want to see that Twin Turbo Lambo Hurucan vs Rimac Nevera. Street Cars are getting stupid fast.
The cringe I read in these comments are my kryptonite.
Another Brilliant Video All The Best Team.
Μόνο χοντα ρε μουνια 😂
lambo baby... godzilla was awesome tooo... if gtr shreads few more pound of wait i think it can race that lambo..
That lambo is cracked, surprised to see it beat the F1 car. Also, 8.9 seconds 1/4 mile it must be a record
Do Rimac Nevera vs Formula vs this lambo
Gtrs are slow
We need Alpha GTR WITH 2000 HP vs Rimac and 2000 HP LAMBO now
Que chingona carrera con ese lambo...
Finally an actual Starter Girl
Sub 9secs 🤯🤯
Except for the brake test, that was surprising! Great job as usual, Matt! 👏👏
Super mega
For your information, this is what a bumper delete does ti a huracan
He jumped the second race alittle less again.
Can u guys please review the Renault Talisman wagon?? Btw, love all ur videos!
Next race should be this lambo vs tesla model s plad +
Pure adrenalin rush.. we need more races like this matt. Rimac vs this lambo if possible 😍
Jazzy Singh's Instagram account is private. 👎 Car NO WOW
That Lambo is pure sickness.
That Lambo is a monster 😳 TTURBO
Should’ve given the f1 the hit to see if he could be reeled in
This lambo vs rimac, i think that was be a good idea
You see Jurgen and the team at jm imports?? Produce madness only builds. Wait till they get LLF GTR and project Orange on here 😂😂😂🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Just hearing that F1 car tells you y i hate teslas
I remember that time when Turbo S was the king of carwow dragraces
Maybe bring a GTR that can actually launch without the lower rev issue?
Carwow provides us the content no one else can provide love from Pakistan 🇵🇰
Mat lambo vs rimac
That Lambo is just INSANE !
i want to see this lambo against the rimac nevera
Am I the only one who thinks the F1 car sounds like a pissed off wasp stuck in a tin? The other 2 sound much better.
lambo fan boys be "YAY WE WON WE ARE THE BEST "
2:43
The biggest anticipated race in history is still Yanni vs Matt 🏃 🏁
First race Lambo jumped the line.
How mental is that Lambo
Who wants this 1200HP Lambo vs a Tesla?
I was hoping the GTR would won but fuck me that Lambo was quick
I love that legend DC called the Nissan the Skyline
DRS ??
V8 F1 win the sound. No one can beat it.
That Lambo is so fast.
How did u jump from 2th to 4th gear in a rolling race? Looks like a save Mod from gearbox 7:13
Surprised nothing broke down
Something's wrong with that Nissan GTR, 1300hp ones are hitting around 8.5s in a quarter mile. They are obliterating Lambos everywhere.
I didn't expect that.
LLF Ricky's GTR vs The lambo vs Rimac
I’m sat
I mean,62 million for a car ? Holly shit !
That was a proper race!  👌
didnt jump the first race but you sure jumped the second, but a chase is a race  switch lanes each time, does the guy only a few feet from the "starter" not have an advantage
Damn, video is so intense, very good race, Lamborghini is absolute beast
Wish there was the Chiron Who else?
That Lambo is absolutely rapid
The 3rd race was good start for everyone :D awesome
What a race! Wow. And the Lambo! To me the Lambo also sounded the best, better sound than the F1.
Please do Tesla Plaid vs Rimac Nevera
thats the fastest lambo ive ever seen....carwow is goin crazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I still love the GTR.  No matter what
why do they take one of the slowest f1 cars though
The winners here are the Car Wow viewers! Great job Matt!
Need a Calvo Motorsports viper down there somehow
There’s something broken in that GTR
Lamborghini 😱😱🖤🖤
Now we need to see this twin turbo Huracán vs the Rimac Nevera! 🔥
what did those cheaters do to that gtr
7:22 matt: im just f**ked off sounds similar to  jeremy clarkson to the rimac: that rimac just f**ks off
Really needed the Rimac Nevera in this lineup!
Mat, please do a race with some Koenigsegg some day.
i want some manufacturer to bring out a sedan with bonkers power like the TT lambo and beat the Tesla plaid as one final hurrah for the dino juice engines.
David Coultard  is awesome comes to chill with the carwow gang and gives us great content
I'd love to see who would win if you added 1 turn.  🤫
F1 car needs DRS
Bring 2jz turbo supra plz
Nevera vs the F1 vs that 1200hp lambo
Mayne 8 seconds that's crazy
Mat, can you make video where is race Rimac Nevera vs Rimac c1 vs first Mate's electric bmw?
If be happy just keeping up with the f1 car
Yo, these are getting out of hand 🤯😍
Hey Matt, can we get some races with a newer hybrid V6 F1 car?
Race a screaming V10 F1 car!
Who ever tuned this Lambo has a brain of magic, also how can you convince an F1 team to let you race their car just like that. Very well done Carwoow team.
Now go around a corner.
put the lambo & RB7 with the Rimac
For ppl thinking the F1 car was slow, they are mostly purpose built to have the most speed/grip through corners, rather than straights.
That's not a proper way of driving that 1300 hp gtr it's faster but it depends on the driver
One of the best races on the channel!!!!!❤️
Congrats to nerly 6 miljon prems!.
*F1 car vs Twin Turbo Lambo vs Rimac Nevera. Make it happen.*
Not at all what I expected
I want to see YIANNI'S reaction on this mental Lambo....
Wanna see that lambo against the rimac c2
Where's Yanni??
Insane
Need rickys gtr
As expected the car Mat drives is always the one that wins. Ruins the whole drag race when you know the outcome
Matt, “2.4 liter naturally aspirated v8 with 700 and 800 horsepower.”
Prueba un lahmborgini sesto elemento
This redbull V8 era is so slow in straight line. Try the V10s or Current car in monza configuration. These cars do 0-200 in just above 4 seconds.
I love it - but can we start to get some corners on Carwow now? I think cornering is an important aspect of any car? I know the location is going to be hard to get.
On Track F1 wins
That lambo really flies 😳
Alright, time for the rb11😂
Never mess with a bumper delete TT lambo
Try uphill normal black top road plz
Megnéztem volna 1kört a verseny pályán is ott, hogy muzsikáltak volna az utcai autók 😀
These F1 Drag races are insane 🥵
That lambo is crazy well done buzzy Singh well done.
Why dont they not use in ears instead of walkie talkies?
For all the Americans here. Imagine a Sheeperace build vs a b rogue build vs an underground build
1300hp gtr should be faster. Js
F1 lost
Lambo is just 0.2 seconds slower than the rimac !!!!!!!
TT Lambo Vs Rimac Vs SF90 Vs 765LT
When the F1 had the real sound of F1 engines, not this crap muffled noise since Mercedez projected engines they use today.
Good video,  really well made,  I totally anjoed,  but,  if the mighty f1 v10  2004 19k rpm monsters would have been called at shootout,  it would be a different matter 🙂
Brake tests are terrible !
Its a faking insane !!!!!!! The lambo fly from start
Ngl if the f1 car was on soft tires the f1 car might of won but holy that lambo
Wow! Beat drag race yet!
We want Tesla model S plaid >
How about VS a non tuned Lambo
When it comes to quarter miles, i think its fair to say, declare, agree and sign that literally anything can happen! Anything! Classic James me say, Thy first shall be Last i guess  That was damn bonkers 💪
Ламбо 👍
That lambo jesus! A rocket car
F1 CAR VS RIMAC NEVERA PLS
Didn't expected this. Thought F1 would destroy them. But we know F1 is not made for this.
didn't expect the outcome
Insane race! That lambo is mental
Amazing drag race. One of the best in this channel - just the Tesla S Plaid was missing though....
Can we have the gtr from before that wasn’t able to do the drag race
Content like this is exactly why I wouldn't be surprised if Matt arranged an F15 fighter jet launched by Yanni next to the  Nevera 😅🤣. What a great channel and amazing content ❤.
I want to see a tuned Porsche 911 turbo s  vs these cars
The F1 car is for track. Even lose the drag race, it is much quicker on track. Road cars turn 1g Super cars turn for 1.5g F1 6g with soft tyres
What if the redbull are using a present F1 car ?
fitst time saw Matt really get scared from speed!
Nevera va F1
Well, F1 cars are not that fast after all 🤷🏽‍♂️
Next you guys need to add a Calvo Viper in the mix. Those things are the real kings.
Bmw take the win no cap
This lambo vs a chiron and a agrera s
crazy when you realize that lambo and that gtr can both break 3000 horsepower with the right boost
Lamborghini versus Rimac please!!!! 💪💪💪⚡️⚡️⚡️
Real races have curves.
Lambos on their own , quite powerful , slap a twin turbo system on it and it’s a bat out of hell
Modern F1 car would be much quicker, they have 1150-1200 hp now and can run a 7.5 1/4 mile. That old NA V8 sounds amazing though.
The huracan is bonkers
wow other youtubers drag racers left in the dust of that F1 car. Quality
Buzz’s car always hit unreal speeds
that lambo is absolutely CRAZY
My kawsaki h2r is faster than the cars!
but still dont like the sound lambo with turbo...
We need to see this lambo vs rimac
The jdm made in Japan drift race Japanese lager sa🗾🎎🇯🇵🗾🎎🇯🇵🗾🎎🇯🇵🗾🎎🇯🇵🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 en f1 🏎️🏁🏁🏁🏁say🏁🏁🏁🏁🏁👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
That's just insane to see a F1 car lose a drag and acceleration test, and that Lambo do a 8.9 second quarter mile time! I knew those GTR's are a victim of its own weight. The munch clutches, gearboxes tyres and fuel and struggle to get the power down.
This Lambo is one fucking rocketship. Holy crap  Finally a proper tuned car, thank god ... AND it grips
Lambo all day, every day, best launches, big watches, white teeth all day every day
Rimac Nevera
Next race … this lambo VS Tesla plaid
You got the jump on everyone except for one race off the dig you were to car lengths on the GTR on the roll that's the first time I have seen a Lamborghini win on a roll against a GTRs are roll race monsters.
Crazy crazy race!!!! Now the Lambo vs Rimac.... That would be something.
Bet my Tesla Plaid would've won lol. It's the new king. This is a joke of course. But it'll run neck and neck with these cars which is insane.
That lambo is incredible!!
It would be awesome to see a drag race between this lambo and Rimac!!
I still can't belive how the normal 911 turbo s does 10.2 sec . Like it's insane that car
lambo that was nice wow wow wow
kawasaki ninja h2R. vs  lamborgini.  huracan
This is insane! Thanks guys bring back the lambo for something else again please buzz
I want to carwow do Tesla Plaid vs Rimac Nevara.
More F1 plz!!!!!!!
THIS IS AWESOME CONTENT. PERIOD.
My civic will smoke y'all
The best  quarter mile race ever¡!!
The gtr was tuned downed
You know your cars fast when it decides to skip third gear and go straight to 4th because third took too long lmao 😂
David Coulthard - Legend.
@carwow So when you are bringing up the Chiron SS?
That Lamborghini is insane !!! We know coz Matt doesn’t go this CuCo whilst driving a car that often !! 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Matt you have simply outdone yourself mate, KUDOS!!!
Last time I saw a F1 car in car program Clarkson nuts payed the price
Imagine what an X package 2.500+ lambo can do.. insane video carwow keep it up
70k tuning when you dont change the engine and the gearbox? 18 karat gold pistons? :D but damn that thing was quick! :)
I'll drink a Red Bull for this
Loved his face the first run in the Lambo. Completely underestimated the power those can make
62 million are you crazy❗️❗️❗️ I can buy planes , ship , Bugattis
Back then no street car would beat an F1. Sad.
“OVEr tHe mILe wE wOuLd dEfiNitelY hAvE tHe AdVaNtaGe oVer yOu” 🤣🤣
TT LAMBO....... OH MY GAWD
If the F1 was all wheel drive . It would kill any car
It would be even closer if you wouldn't jump the start every single time
So why is the F1 car 62Million?
they just need to reduce the body weight of that GTR and then everybody knows that result will not be the same.
THE DRAGE RACE OF THE YEAR!
horsepower dosent tell the whole story, americans could learn from that
Have they actually remade all their thumbnails or have I never seen the numberplates with the Car Brands before???
I'd still go for the GTR. I know it lost but it weighs more 400 KG more than the Lambo. Its reliable and its sexy.
I'm a diehard fan of lamborghini
I liked the video when I saw the title during commercials ;))
The F1 sound will bring a tear to the eye...what a time it was for racing fans!!!!!
thissss... is an amazing drag race!
That has to be the career highlight of Matt's career. You're done, you can retire now, Matt. lol You beat a F1 car with David Coulthard driving in a souped up Lambo. I'd still love to see Yanni driving that thing. lol Great race, Matt!
6:55 Tesla Plaid go home, all o ye slow pokes! 🤣😁
OMG that Lambo’s a Missile💥💥💥
LET THE LAMBO RACE WITH REMAC NEVERA !!!!!!!
In F1 mics 50+ people sounds like 20+
David’s Wife: How was the s*x tonight?   David: The teams happy, I’m happy 😃
Mat definitely enjoyed this one 😂
TRUE FEAR AM MATT'S FACE IN RACE 1
Lamborghini twin turbo sounds💥💥💥
Newton meters?  In the US we use Torque. Why is a better description?
This is why Lambo's are naturally aspirated, to preserve the spirit of competition.
everyone knows lambos with no bumper are the scariest cars to race can’t beat um😂
Haha that F1 sound like a mosquito.
That Lambo is insane!😳
Rimac Nevera vs this Lambo. Make it happen!!!
that lambo is faster than an tesla plaid?
Setting gold standards in drag races. Mat and carwow team, take a bow
that TT lambo made the gtr appear slow af altho it did 1/4 mile in 9.3 s
I wonder which feels faster, the link or rimac 🤔
i need this cars in a mile drag race
Never seen Matt that scared before
so a Tesla Plaid sedan does a 1/4 mile as fast as an F1 car.
i think a v10 F1 car would compete better with the Lambo but that shows how insane it is haha
F1  VS  RİMAC NEVERA       ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Matt plz race this Lamborghini against the new tesla plaid
Mother of god 😲 that lambo is insanely fast
This, but with the rimac nevera
Mat, looks like you made it! Congrats to you and your team, almost 6M subs and an F1 for an epic drag race, you deserve it :) I love the down to earth and no swagger BS approach, just fun and actually useful information, thank you for everything!
That lambo vs the rimac vs the chiron😍😍
that lambo is CRAZYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
give that red bull soft compound
Need to see that Lamborghini vs rimac
Jesus christ that Lamborghini huracan is insane fast 😳
jesus christ that lambo is fucked up
This Lambo vs a tuned Porsche 911 turbo S vs a tuned SF90 ?
3:17 that's from the previous Chiron drag race, but ok
It was my money on the F1 car every time. My god, I never expected the Lambo to be that quick despite the stats. 8.9s Wow!
The fact that that F1 car has an approximate value of $62.5 million is absurd on another level.  Just dumb.
ayo- i didnt expect that omg-
No traction for the F1.
These are really high quality contents. Gooooood job carwow
That rear bumper delete on the lambo automatically added a 800 hp
I wonder how that Lambo would fare against the Rimac Nevera... that would be a good drag race
F1 car on slicks in damp conditions
he literally went 220 mph that’s crazy!
That LAMBO is NUTS
Who else wants to see a drag race between this lambo , a Supra , Model S , Rimac Nevera and the F1 ?
Thanks to JM Imports, Buzz and Red Bull Racing for  helping to make a great video! Looking forward to more Carwow and  Mat!
the fuel supply of the f1 car is also limited 🙄
Surely the F1 car would have a Renault engine in it? Assuming it just says Honda as they are now supplied engines from Honda?
🚀🚀🚀
Huracan's engine 👍👍👍
H2R vs Lambo vs F1 next
We also want 1200hp twin turbo huracan vs Ferrari sf90 vs chiron vs tesla model s plaid
How much does gtr cost?
If the gtr had higher rev setting gun the tune it probably would’ve won the dig race
I’ve never seen Matt look like that before. That Lambo is freaking mad!
Mat we need to see what yiaani thinks of that lambo
A video of these three on a circuit would be great. Also a video about why the Lambo does so dang well with turbos
Who was in the RB, Pastor Maldonado?
Nice race !
Cant digest this result. Maybe cause it was DC in the F1 car. :-D
Matt can you start doing lap times too
Doesn’t that make this Lamborghini the 2nd 🥈 fastest car to complete the quarter mile?
Can u do next suzuki swift v dacia sandero v hyundai i10 v toyota yaris ,ik its a slow race but cmon it will be interesting
Wondering how long before stock gear box goes with 1300 hp?
Bugatti chiron vs Rimac nevera
Great video! That lambo sounded AMAZING!!!
Please do more vidoes with Coulthard sir, he deserves a lot more respect
Put Max in that Red Bull in next race. Immediately!!😂😂
Bugatti vs lambo
Ahhh no EVs 😁😁😁
Plz we wanna see race between Bmw M5 2007 vs Bmw M5 2020
That was maadd...🤯🤯🤯
Add the Rimac Nevera here and the race will be more insane
I wish they heated the f1 tyre and had the run with drs on
I want to see drag racing between Bugatti Chiron vs this Lambo 1200hp Vs rimac nivera it will be “in”sane who agree please give me thumbs up 👍
Potato
Do 1 with supersonic thrust
Can’t wait until the turbo hybrid formulas are allowed to race it’d be no competition
I think F1 could do better at a completely dry surface, but even tho I don't think it could take on the Lambo
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST RACE EVER SUBSUCRIBE FOR THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It’s not often you hear a car comes in LAST with a 9.3s 1/4 mile… 😂
That F1 car sound takes over the video
At this point its liturally just abour which car is better tuned and obv the huracan was better turned than the gtr
💯💯💯
Wow... 8 second quarter on that surface is even more wild seeing Mat do it. Would like to see him run a 7 second quarter mile in future 🤔
Wy dont thay open drs
Modern top fuel dragster next!!
Imagine if there was a Tuned Model S Plaid lol
This Lamborghini against, the Bugatti Veyron????
Next time Ford honicorn vs Lamborghini.
put 70k into awd civic see what happens🤘
The Nevera vs that Lambo?
Get a modem f1
This is the type of drag races we want.
What was torque output of the F1 car???
Could we potentially see some laps time in the future?
That lambo would beat the Model S Plaid!! Wow!!!
Mat fucked the gear change as well, but still won
Bitte auf deutsch
Matt, that's not what tuned means.
I wanna see a twin turbo r8 vs this huracan
Is the Rimac Nevera we want to see Vs that F1 😭
the lambo just fucks off
I've see that lambo and clicked the video you guys are doing fabulous job keep it up guys and a race between nevara f1 and this lambo huracan would be great too to watch absolutely love it guys 🐐👏
Plaid has entered the chat.
Didn’t expect that lambo to be that fast 😆😆😆😆
Best races 🏎
The lambo double shifted in the roll race and still won🤯
That braking distance is showing you how F1 would destroy both cars on the track. Just one of the things.
God sake theres no cornering in the test..... Results would have been so different 😂
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson lambos with no bumper > anything else
yeh next time don't mess with no bumper lambo
It would be interesting to know at what speed the cars get
Only in the UK 😃 😃
That lambo missed third geat it went second gear to third for a moment and shifted to fourth. It would have been even further in the race it the third gear would have been till redline.
That Lambo just F***S OFF
Lambo..... All day everyday..... 😎😎 (YIANNI)
Still have the gtr its the most practical out of all 3
Was not expecting that!
Is that Lambo fast or is that F1 car struggling to put power down?
Gtr needs a stronger drive shaft, how are you going to run 1300 hp but can’t launch
That formula 1 in your ear has to be a really scary sound
Lot of smoke coming from that Lambo's exhaust? Fast though! My heart of hearts wanted to see the F1 car demolish the other two.
Nice one ! 👍
The F1 breaking power, my god
I mean the f1 car is not made for drag
Nissan wins 9 times out of 10
TT huracans are just a different beast but  I thought that GTR was gonna be closer
That's it I'm tuning my ride.
R35 nerd, absolute great car
That Lambo would be a decent competitor against the Rimac. We know the Nevera will win, but would be a lot of fun with the drag races.
You make yanni proud matt
NEVERA VS TUNED LAMBO NEXT...
It would be very interesting to see a race between this Huracan and the Rimac nevara...
Lamborghini vs Nevera
F1 cars are not what they just to be, back then during the "Senna era", formula 1 cars had between 900-1400 horsepowers and turbo. F1 cars was also hard to drive and the drivers had to struggle with their cars while driving, now that's called skills.
Idc what anyone says the sound of an F1 cannot be beaten.
Pleaseeee get rickys GTR in this. It will blow everyone away
F1 vs rimac nevera
F1 vs Lambo vs Model S Plaid ?
Imagine F1 car with 1200 HP😳
That Lamborghini is running more than 1200hp to pull a 8.9 on that slippery runway.
the  Lambo is complety stock,just few pipes extra in the exhaust
Lamborghini is now drag king
Carwow's production value for this video= +++++
That’s the first time in awhile I’ve seen Matt get surprised at a car’s speed lol. Not even the Rimac got that reaction out of him.
Rimac nevera vs lambo
Petrol head still got a chance against Electric Nerds... 😍
There is NO ONE doing it like CARWOW and fucking Matt, incredible daily content, been following for 4years and never it as never let me down!  Keep it coming
Wait until ricky brings his 1900 bhp skyline on here, see ya lambo
🔥🔥🔥
Hello, I Come From VIET NAM, I like Your youtobe Carwow channel
F1 car with that road condition is just too hard for them
I feel like if it was the rb16. That the f1 would win then
Mat definitely was not prepared for the way that Lambo pulled.
I used to love gtrs but theyre dead now stock or modded or even built just outdated as fuck
Just take off the big wing from the F1 car and give it warmed super soft compound tyres.  But very very impressive by this cars. All wheel drive does it at the start
Can’t even lie, I most def enjoy these modified car comparisons 👀🔥
F1 with DRS won easy
F1 only needs some corners to kill both
🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 “The five lights are on...” .   .   .   .   . “And it’s light out and away we go” “Matt Watson gets away well” . . . “And he takes the chequered flag to win the drag race” Stewards : 👀👀👀 “And Matt Watson has been given a five second time penalty for jumping the start” “DAVID COULTHARD FINDS HIMSELF AT THE TOP OF THE PODIUM, WITH MATT WATSON, PLUM LAST”
Matt I'm happy for you I watch your every episode since I founded  your channel  love it. I'm happy for you, you know what they say If you do something good don't do it for free and  here you are doing what you like I spouse, and getting paid by viewers, I wish you more viewers you deserve them
a quarter mile is just over 400 metres. That huracan is basically averaging 100 metres in 2 odd seconds, four times.
Lets just say that lambo will show up in the google news feed tomorrow
Hi Mattson
Wonder how recent 2020/21 F1 car would do… great Vid mates ✌️that Lambo was tuned great.
🔥🔥🔥
Best one so far!   (somehow i always think that at every drag race)
I miss the DDE tyre slayer hahaha
Really Matt jumped the first 2. 3rd was fair and won easily.
Coulthard: "over the 1/4 mile you have the advantage, over a mile though I'd destroy you" Lambo: "you are like a baby, hold my beer"
Amazing!!  Keep it coming!! 💯👍 Rimac needs to make an appearance with the RB F1 at some point… 😬
The best part about not being the F1 car driver is hearing its Doppler effect, which you can't do if you're the one driving it. It's like porn you know, you enjoy watching it, but when you're the one doing it, you can't see the same things, and it's a bummer.
We are going to NEED to see that lambs vs the new Rimac thing
The best race since I saw some Russian street racing in 2013 in 8 pixel
Best video so far! That Lambo is insane!
TT LAMBO VS CHIRON
These races just seem to be getting more and more crazy, at some point these guys are probably going to bring a top fuel dragster on to their track  lol
If u search fastest quarter mile times it comes up with videos on TT lambos just saying that’s why lambo had to make their engines naturally aspirated if they used turbo chargers like every other car just wouldn’t be fair
The nevera would destroy even the lamborghini. Nuts
We need rimac vs turbo lambo!
Lambo Vs rymac race 👍
Shame too put turbo in Lamborghini
Now, F1 vs Lambo vs Model S Plaid please!
He drove the F1 at 80% of its capabilities, just listen to it guys, he short shifted all the time. The car is so expensive he was probably told to do so.
This Lambo (8,9 sec) against Rimac (8,7 sec) would be an interesting race now...
I love these races
The F1 car tho
current F1car does 1/4 mile in 8.8sec
Red bull sounds like the Lexus LFA
Damn a tuned 765LT would keep up with the boosted Lambo wooooow
Can’t wait to see Ricky’s GTR on here
The 2011 championship winning F1 car which mean that's the same car Sebastian Vettel used..???
I wanna see that lambo  race a bugati  shiron  💥💥👌
i'd love to see an M5 CS on here
They should do one F1 vs Lambo vs Rimac
First time I've seen a f1 got beaten
What happens if you tune that F1...
Best reaction I’ve ever seen you have 😂
NEXT TUNED TOYOTA SUPRA
Yam yam
Those TT lambos are epitomy of "built different".
We need more of that Lambo 😰
That Lambo is super fast
I was reallly disapointed in the performnace of the F1 car, but i guess if this had been a full lap of a circut race, the F1 car would have obliterated the other two
Get Rickys 1900hp Nissan GTR vs the Rimac
Mercedes F1 team : let's keep our cars in this classy museum  Redbull: let's give this 64M F1 machine to carwow
Seems like the f1 car use wet monaco setup
8.9 holy moly no joke here!
That Lamborghini tuning is worth to money  But GTR got loose
as soon as I saw the helmet on the f1 car, I got so excited.
I would be very curious to see this lambo vs tesla model s plad, would be sick :D
Drag between Nevera, this Lambo and F1 car be ...
This race is amazing🔥 Because Lambo is my fav car
Who wants the F1 Vs Rimac Nevera?
The front splitter of the lambo isss sickk
the slowest car is 9.3 sec  what a race
Doesn't the formula 1 have drs?
Best. Dragrace. Ever!
Is that Lamborghini only has 1,200hp, then that also means the sky is not blue.
Race idea : Civic with a laptop vs That lambo
I was just at a drag strip and saw a huracan. Unfortunately the white bmw driver couldnt shift. A stock diesel F150 beat him
Lambo beats an f1 one car no problem, nothing out of the ordinary just an eye watering 62 million price difference 😭
Nice
Matt what's the 0-60 time of that Lambo? Damn 🔥
one month i was waiting for good movie :)
Look like the r8 is a good tuning car
That twin  turbo huracan is absolutely orgasmic in every way Holy shit the looks and the sound.
nissan gtr just 6 cylinders :....
62 mil for f1 car Is it a joke?
A 170K Lambo smashes a 68 million F1 car, how is that feeling RedBull?
A 170K Lambo smashes a 68 million F1 car, how is that feeling RedBull?
I still love my gtr....😋
wow matt jumped every start lol cheater!!!!!! #loser
THAT LAMBO THOUGH MAN!! THOSE TWO BIG AND THICCCCC TURBOS DID THE JOB!
Cringe lambo fanboys getting horny ig
This is amazing race
Please race ANYTHING against a Viper ACR-E CM2000 or CM1800X by Calvo Motorsports. 100% street legal.
Bonkers
1300hp and 9.3, Something wrong with that GTR.
7:14 3rd gear : why are we still here? Just to suffer?
I mean when you see a Lambo with his bumber off you really don't want to race him 😂
Wheres that tesla s plaid?
Overall F1 is the better car just tad slight slower than the Lambo but stop alot faster
Do a review with that lamborghini ❤️
F1 car seems detuned
Matt get us a tuned Porsche! 😂🔥
That F1 sound 🥰🥰🥰
You should do indycar in oval spec vs those
yeah .. the team isn't happy
Should have brought Rickys from LLF GTR on there
Lamborghini is next level
WTF is powering that Lambo!?
This Race Was Completely Nuts
This would be good race between this lamborghini vs a bugatti please make it happen👏
The thing is, the F1 car can do those speeds around a turn.
We want 1200 hp twin turbo huracan vs 800 hp 911 turno s vs fast tuned mk4 supra
Lowkey the best drag race ive ever seen
That era f1 cars were slow as phuck. Race against the hybrid era cars then the lambo would get smoked...hard
I wonder what would happen if they had a go at a proper racetrack... ;-)
Hello Mat, please make the drag race between Rimac Nevera and this insane green  Lambo 1200 hp. I'm waiting for this video.
the huracan kept going before they were meant to go which was where the F1 car and the GTR went which was the correct time, the race wasn’t fair. and the GTR was only about 100 horsepower and nearly 600kg heavier so it DEFINITELY was not fair. very dumb to be honest.
The wheel on the F1 is not perfect
Matt looked absolutely terrified on that first run haha
My brother knows the person who owns that Lamborghini
Mat can you do a dodge charger hellcat widebody vs m5 cs drag race? If will do ill be thankful to you but the rolling race you need to do ut in 60mph becauce of the gearbox raitos/final drive ratios thats in the hellcat
I think the F1 would only need 200hp more to compete against the two sports cars. The driver will do the rest.
Imagine the times on a real glued quartermile dragstrip.   I also want to know the trap speeds!
Speedy speedy what would win in a race then or the fastest RC car???👍
Very nice dude!
i can't believe that the rimac is STILL faster lol
Yianni is going to love this Lambo.
Freaking lambo oh my god. Please do a drag race with this same lambo and any Bugatti. 💙💪
The tuned ttRS, Tuned R8, tuned 911 turbo s, this 1000hp lambo, Bugatti Chiron and Rimac . And please bring Yianni to drive the R8 and this 1200hp lambo.
Mat what 0 to 60 time? 😶😶😶 8.9 is just (. 3 secs slower than Rimac Nivera) that is bonkers
Perfekt video
Those three plus HOONIGAN MUSTANG
The F1 car is on hard compound tyres, Come on Mat. If it was on soft tyre compound tyres it would've been a lot closer. Anyways love the vids
Wow
Should of thrown in a H2R 😉
Next up we need Rimec Nevera vs Tuned Aventador or Tuned Huracan vs F1 vs Bugatti Chiron plz Matt I hope you'll look on to this
It's shoking that a tuned Huracan performance us faster than a 62million dollar F1 race car 😂
Your face said it all most Insane I’ve seen nice👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Killer Huracan
Why was 1500hp chiron not able to beat f1 😏
If yanni were there he might break into the tears because of lambo's victory😂
Lambo vs Rimac
1200hp Huracan V Nevera 8.9s V 8.7s
That Lamborghini needs to vs the rimac!
How about throw in a corner....
This is absolutli unbealivable
I wonder what gear dc started in with the standing start… you could hear the red hull struggling for grip in the first couple of meters  Edit: nvm! even in 2nd gear, it struggled to find grip
This was fun as Hell. I can hear the Formula One car, it's coming. 😅😂🤣.
Lambo jumped the start
People always sleeping on a gtr stop dragging these r35 man get a R32-33 or 34 and do the same
🤩🤩🤩
Let’s see them round a track 😏😝
Do rimac vs f1 car
Crazy to think a Tesla Plaid would.beat that GTR in a 1/4 mile 😂
HURACAN TWIN TURBO 😎 CHIRON QUAD 4 TURBO 😭
😂 If the team is happe I'm happe
CARWOW...CARWOW...CARWOW>>>>    BMW M5  CS 635HP   VS   PORSCHE 911 992  650 HP....!!!!!!!!!!
CARWOW...CARWOW...CARWOW>>>>    BMW M5  CS 635HP   VS   PORSCHE 911 992  650 HP....!!!!!!!!!!
Damn that Lamborghini is very angry
CarVauv the one of the best of all time I wonder what if Mat will find alpha15 and Plaid
I'd still take the GTR not even close
I believe that it was the best drag race I ve ever seen!!Well done Matt..
Carwow is on another level of drag racing!! Omg!
F1 is without OPF! ;-)
7:13 the Lambo skipped 3rd gear. Not that it matters it still won. Impressive.
Pls 4470 hp supra

Best sound test ever
I was surprised with the gtr. Being the heavist and not running the full power it still did pretty decent.
I just clicked because the back bumper is off
This Lambo vs Nevera!!!
Lambo vs. Rimac holy crap we need to see it
Greatest Carwow race i have ever seen! #that F1 though
This is the ultimate Lamborghini...let Yianni drive this while Matt drives the Rimac Nevera.
The GTR is so over rated. I dont know how many time ive seen people throw horsepower figures at this car its ridiculous. People really think its the end all be all in everything fast. Its a V6 and an outdated one at that.
Has a perfect start 1st run, and jumps the 2nd 😂😂😂. 3rd run, Where's the F1 car, i hear im coming! As he's pulling from him 😂😂😂
Amazing 🤩 race
Great video.
220 mph thats crazy
I know it's interesting to watch but stock is way more attractive. F1 vs Koenigsegg vs Pagani
Matt is like a child in Christmas
Best video in the chanel
You don't have to get in and watch a video, you will know after thumbnail who won. Guess why ? :)
After seeing this who else want to see Rimac nevara vs this lambo 😂😂😂😂😂
Monicaaaaaa!
The F1 car feels like its changing gears as if it was in Fast and Furious lol
That lambo Vs the Nevera.....is what we want to see
Standard transmission in the Lambo, was almost waiting for it to blow up :D
👀
When are u going to test the Koenigsegg absolut?
Are you making dc race a formula 1 car on slicks in the rain? Lol
Why are always Huracans that are tuned and not Aventadors!!!
This lambo vs Remac nevera
Lambo is always the king........ btw, was that david coulthard in the RBR?
That Lambo is insane!!! Eyoh!
Where’s F1 vs Rimac Nevera vs Tesla model S Plaid??????
Great drag race! Make  a drag race with Pista and svj please!!!!!!!
Use me as this Lambo and GT-R vs the Rimac button.
F1 V8 Twin turbo
3:47: the mosquito in my bedroom at 1 am
2:02 the F-35A, the Air Force's version of the jet, costs $78 million. I mean dear god!
Couldn't they just stretch a huge tarpaulin over the field so it doesn't get wet? Haha
NEXT VIDEO!!! Jet Fighter VS F1 Car VS Bugatti Chiron.
Pls show the leaderboard after every dragrace
Really quick lambo
Does anyone noticed Lamborghini hit 221mph 🔥🔥🔥
First time ever hearing him not say "I'm sat in a" rather than "I'm sitting in a" 👀🤣💀 get DMO's Performante featured
Here before 1 million views
deep down I was GTR gang but, my god that’s why those TT lambos are known to be the true king of the streets… insane race carwow ❤️
what a fantastic race! great to see. Would be incredible to see this beastly Lambo up against a modern F1 car with all the improvements. just crazy to imagine that a road legal car like that smoked a former world champion car from a decade ago.
Awesome! Carwow just keeps showing the world how to win at YouTube
mat you jumpt
this is the craziest  car i have seen
Next time bring LLF's GTR pls
Saying that Lambo is a MONSTERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       Is an understatement.
Wow, Rimac Nevera with 1900hp has a time 8.7 and this Lambo 1200hp 8.9..... Insane
How did the GTR lost that much
Is this a f1 car with a suzuki hayabusha engine or something?
Hey Matt would be cool to see a 90 degree 3rd gear corner test or similar added to these vids. Just to see the differing grip levels of the different cars you drag.
Now bring out a V10 F1 car
I still cant believe that the lambo launched faster than the F1 car. I knew the lambo would beat it in speed, but not launch. Damn those cars are nuts
this is called powerful badass race :D
This was a genuinely exciting line up
now put them on a circuit race track)
Im in love with this lambo dammnnn
The lambo destroy all the cars I can’t believe 🔥
4:46
try tesla s plaid
Carwow have literally changed the game with this type of content!
That black on black on black on black GT-R looks fucking SICK!
imagine if F1 driver test lambo on track and forget the brakes not good enough
Wow 🤣🤣 loved your reaction to that Lambo what a machine
Now i just need a : Regera in this race To complete my list.  Hope they can get one soon...
I want this huracan get drag race with aventador svj,please
Lambo vs Nevera?
Lambo vs rimac nevera
You just hear F1 engine and thats it haha
Nehmt mal ein F1 von 2004 oder 2005, da hat der Lambo nix zu melden ☺
F1 car did well considering its the old least powerful V8 version, rear wheel drive and looked like it was spitting with rain. Would be a fairer comparison if they used the current V6 hybrid F1 cars
dribbler,driveller
i want to see the GTR with the chiron lol
F1 = réglementations 2.4L maximum vs serial car unlimited..... 👎👎👎
That was an intense race… Wow. 😳
Answering the question we all wanted to know most! Is an F1 car faster than modified super cars?
The Rimac is the only thing beating that Lambo!
Lmao you literally raced jurgens slowest car
Pistons are a lot better than electric motors...❤️
I think that’s the best carwow video I’ve ever watched…
Buzz lambos🤯
Mental Drag Race. Loved it !
Those two cars are road garbage (stop to cool! LOL). The F1 is a F1....
There is no way that the Gtr is 1300 hp
Espero este video en español💪
I watched the start back frame by frame.... and matt definitely jumped the start (on race 1 and 2) lol
Your funny
8.9 seconds a 1/4 mile..... Everyone knows we need to see that lambo vs the rimac nevara👀
That Lamborghini is lit.
Now that you have these two against the formula 1, please bring back the Chiron and race it against these two 😂
Putting the WOW in carwow
Mercedes amg gls 63
Incredible video Mat!!
62million for a race car....LOL.  F1 is MONEY LAUNDERING.
Pin this comment u got fooled if not heart and reply   ... Read more
But around the turns that lambo should be toast
I really thought the F1 car would destroy the other cars, i'm blown away
Would be intresting to se a  Williams FW27 (bmw) vs that. The v10 in those could put out over 1000 HP. And I think they had launch control?
make a drag race  between this lambo VS remak nevera, it will be insane
Rimac vs this lambo
Get Ricky from llf's 1900hp gtr on this next
Now put the Huracan against the Nevera. That would be close.
now we know dont try with lambo without bumper
That lambo is a rocket made the gtr look like a Yaris
Who else read that GTR's license plate as f****r😂😂😂
Red Bull:The Ultimate Career Destroyer Lambor:The Ultimate Drag Race Destroyer
Waiting for the day they do a drag race with coaches
Finally, F1 defeat🤣🤣
Plaid Model S enters the chat..
You should get Daniel Ricardo to drive the f1 in a newer f1 car
Mat might have the most exciting job in the whole of UK.
Imagine no sounds like these anymore :@(
Alfa GTA mat! 😊 ‘d love to see your point on that beast
An idea for your next test.  Eliminate the F1 and replace it with the Tesla Model S Plaid.  I am sure that the electric vehicle beats them by a landslide !!
Okay, we gotta see that Lambo vs a new Tesla Model S Plaid now. 8.9s!!!! Wtf.
Lambo is always ultimate
Car wow have come so far.
Race the Lamborghini with Rimac Nevera
Now I know why the Lambo doen´t have Rear bumper ... it doesn´t need it.🧐
I want that Lamborghini against the Bugatti Chiron 😻
I think For the best car he is F1 RB7 ,i like and love rev that's car OMG 😘😘
That Formula1 was quite spectacular if you consider those cars have double the horsepower.
220mph and a 8.9 quarter is incredible from the lambo hats off to the tuner
This show is getting amazing day by day
you need to get project tango or Rickys Gtr on the channel. theyre in  a different league alltogether.
Thank You redbull
all wheel drive considering power to weight ratios factored against each position.
please do with lambo and  bugati  chiron
Test the F1 against the Rimac Nevera, that would be epic!,
Come on guys bring the turbo hybrid era
And now let’s see a lap of silverstone.
Matt channeling Yianni launch mojo
actually im really jealous with matt because he living in everybody dream life
1200 hp lambo vs Rimac nevera next
Wonder what would happen if Lamborghini decided to enter Formula 1
Awesome guys  as always  that Lamborghini is something else insane !!  Thanks to the owners for letting this happen👍
You're in the lead, absolutely demolishing the other two. Still you're saying come onnnnnnnn? What do you want mate? You're in an 8 second car FFS 🤣 loved the race though Matt.   Also no you didn't jump the start. You've just gotten annoyingly good at this.
Man that lambo is something.
Really impressed with the lambo. Turbo V10 must be amazing and a road car. Is it still as easy to drive as pre modified?
F1 sound just insane :)))
GTR driver was asleep on the first two digs
As expected awesome incredible mate
This lambo vs Remac 😍
THAT WAS INSANE!!!!
Do a M5 Evolve vs an RS6 MTM
It is the first race which Lambo is not the loudest car in the group😂
Would be interesting to see a 919 evo vs the Lamborghini and the f1 car
Now that's a race. I really enjoyed it.  Keep stuff like this
9.3 sec is incredibly fast for the GTR. But the other two cars just make it look slow. Mind swirling amazing
Where were these cars during Hoonigan vs the World? Carwow remains the kings of youtube drag racing
I think GT-R wasn't in perfect conditions
OMG, the traction, the power, the torque, and low end, the mid end, and the top end is insanely insane on the tuned Lamborghini Huracan!🔥🔥😱😱... I guess this is the craziest car Mat has ever driven and also we the viewers have seen too! It overpowered the F1 car very very easily, I thought it would be a tough one! Thanks Mat for this incredible Drag Race!❤️
the huracan is nuts
Lamborghini on steroids
Did Matt jump the line twice?
This Lambo vs Chiron
insane
Matt could you try to get one of the turbo f1 B186 Benetton from F1 turbo era. Think they were running 1350-1400bhp.
Next video:  Tuned lambo vs rimac nevera
It’s so epic you get to have a F1 car on now. Utterly, stupidly, fantastic. Something the world needed, but didn’t know it wanted.
GTR setup is shit…🤦🏻‍♂️
Detune the GTR to 1200hp and he might get near the lambo
Someone seem to be unfair looking at the formula one car
Definitely jumped the stat each time
When u realise ur cars been on drugs LOL!!!!!!!! 4:02
the video starts at 3:30
The adrenaline in this video is off the charts!! Especially during the roll race when mat had to let go off the two walkie talkies and shift immediately, that was nuts!~ I love electric cars and I'm all up for them, but seriously fast car with engines and their sound is still unbeatable. That huracan is perfect car for most people before everything goes EV, it is just about as fast the Rimac Nevera and still has a engine sound to it. Let me get this clear, I don't hate EV cars, I just love how far ICE have come along over the years. Sad to say this but this decade is probably the last decade of ICE before they get assisted by electric motors if not fully electric, and I just appreciate them so much more now. We are living in an era where 4 cyclinders are making 400HP and V10's, once tuned with added turbos are making over 1000HP, especially the Calvo Vipers, those thing make over 2000. Love it, nothing will ever beat these last generations of Internal Combustion Engines!!
The f1 car has the tyres it should have the yellow
get LLF nissan gtr on this channel
The Lambo is mad... Also on stock engine and trans parts? 👁👄👁
Get LivingLifeFasts GTR and race it against the rimac nevera
that 3rd drag race must have been one hell of an experience for mat, just hearing that v12 screemimg behind him, brilliant
Would like to see that Lambo against the Rimac 😀
220mph like wtf😂😂😂 fast as hell tht lambo
Matt you did the lambo justice! The switch from calling to race to shifting was insane!!
slow nissan lol
THIS LAMBO VS THE RIMAC CMOOOOONNN:*
now we need to pit it against a tuned turbo S and a model S plaid
4:52 th f1 sounded like pennywise was coming
Unpopular opinion: I really don’t like the way the F1 car sounds, it sounds just like a mosquito flying near your ear when you’re in your bed trying to sleep
We the viewers are the true winners. Amazing race 👍
You OK Hun 😂😂😂😂😂😂 that line killed me 😂🤣, love u Matt, greetings from Morocco ❤️✌️
Who else wants to see this Lambo VS The Rimac VS The F1? 🤔
220 on the huracan holy shit 😱
One little thing, the lambo since it's twin turbo it doesn't have a dual clutch transmission any more but a single clutch conversion
I just have to ask as a long-time watcher, how do you get these cars! Particularly F1 cars? You must be a master at making connections:-). I love your videos I am finally subscribing :-)
That lamborghini was more like a rocket than a car
TT Lambo vs Rimac Nevara! 😝
The fact that these days we have street cars that can beat F1 cars is amazing
5:54. Matt: I can hear the Formula 1 car, he's coming... Ze Germans can hear ze Formula 1 car too.
No doubt those TT kits for Lamborghinis are f’ing nutters. They really are almost unbeatable on the street. You almost can’t beat the price of a used Huracan and UGR or AMS kit on top.
these races are getting more crasier and crasier
U lot need a DRONE to get a better angle of how quick they going ⭕️⭕️
Damn that lamborghini is a beast the launch is insane before the race started i thought the F1 was gonna win but i was wrong lol but at least the GTR took second in the rolling race 😁
Rimac vs Buzzysingh
get that Lambo against the Rimac Nevera
I am upset with GTR
Sweet Race! Now This Lambo vs Rimac and Tesla plaid vs Porsch 911 turbo S
Matt and the Carwow team just made the dream races come true..   I hope to see more tuned cars drag races and race car vs race car
Moron driver in that black GT-R
차는벨N
Get Ricky LLF’s GTR against some of those unbeatable 911’s
Im glad you still have your job :D
That F1 car sounds just like a lexus LFA.
The F1 is so slow haha
Only if the f1 car had DRS
Damn what a very interesting drag race tho, i thought the lambo and the gtr won’t stand a chance that f1 😂
That lambo is different gravy
a man can do only one thing at a time
Take off the rear and front wing on the f1 car 😂
only if f1 had softs
That Lamborghini against the Chiron would be epic...
rimac vs that lambo
Turkish subtitles please, you have a lot of followers from Turkey...
Matt, you now have to definitely compare that Tuned Lambo with the Tesla Model S Plaid
Shocked that yanni isn't in the lambo
3:16 ASMR for me
how about a 2020 formula 1 car , its not fair you race an older fi car
Where are the “Japan/JDM only” kiddos now?
Yanni’s reaction to the insane lambo -   “Wow, What a car!”
It would have been interesting if you guys would have added an electric sports car like porsche taycan for this drag race.
That lambo is just on another plane of existence though rear end looks like someone spilled it guts…
F1CAR vs 1200hp lambo vs 1300hp gtr vs rimac
JM Imports has tuned a 2000 HP GTR whyy this one?😭
Really sloow driver on GT R , reaction time is HUGE... I believe GT R can beat Lamborghini roll on
pleasee that lambo to be one by one with nevera
The Chaos at the end on the walkie talkie is so funny
I want to see a built 911 Turbo S go against the Lambo and GTR
Tesla model S plaid vs formula 1 car would be a good race.
2:42 I love that turbos whistles
Someone said that is skyline? Omg
i really want to watch you guy race a tesla model s plaid on your channel
The rear end of this Lambo looks sick 🔥🔥 !!!
Yes yes I always wanted to see a race like this
This tuned lambo vs kawa h2r
Amazing race
This is like the calico vs f1 cars
Get Matty's Rimac here 🤜💥🤛
Next week, Space Shuttle vs X-wing Fighter vs The Flash
This lambo vs DMO lambo👀
The lambo’s rear end 🥵🥵
You have access to the real life sandbox mode.
Hats off to matt on this one!! 👏 that gear change after the walkie talkie drop was pure talent! 👀🤣💯 did yianni proud on this one hahaha
when an audi aka lambo kills an F1 racing car and driver - do you know what GERMAN ENGINEERING means - Gocart milionaire's toy vs. daily "AUTOBAHN" utility vehicle
It's so odd to not hear the gtr
2jz fans must be cry, if he look at dis lambo
That was fucking nuts....wow.
I think f1 cars late because of  DRS ON.
a camera angle from a drone would be better for the breaking test😊
Idk it's a honda
This Lambo VS Rimac
We need to see dragrace between Rima Nevera and this Lamborghini
Sexy Drag! Can somebody tell me what material is the cam "mount" behind the wheel and where to buy?
Never race a lambo with no rear bumper.
must see  rimac vs this lambo
I want to see that lambo with the  new rimac nevera That would be  🤯
rimac   and lambo  drag race please.
M5 1000hp vs this Lamborghini?
F1 CAR VS koenigsegg, both have 1:1  power-to-weight ratio
That Lamborghini F***s Off!!
still waiting for some supra 1000+ hp^^
These tuned supercars are cool in all but can they actually use all their power and are they reliable? Are they even that much quicker than stock?
Hey Matt... was that 220 mph the fastest you ever gone? 354 kph is no joke!
I find it irritating how people use words like „killed“ or „destroyed“ when comparing cars that do the standing quarter mile between 8.x and 9.x seconds - as if it would make one car a „loser“ or „slow“. Just ridiculous.. especially when they compare a 5 seater Luxury Sedan like the Model S Plaid with those heavily tuned supercars and say something like „shit Tesla“ - oh my gosh, perspective guys!!! 😂
Imagine a drag race with a Ferrari f2004 🤌🏻
So no Carwow offer on they Formular 1 car?
I feel the GTR driver was somewhat useless
can y’all do a f1 vs PLAID
Why are F1's  more expensive then? 🤔
Advice Stay away from lambos with missing bumpers.
I hope this lambo is enough quick for poor Yanni! :D
The stopping power of the F1 car is just mindblowing
The lambo looks sick in the back.
Thanks Red Bull and D.C. so awesome to have the comparisons.  D.C was this American’s favorite f1 driver.  It’s awesome that you guys and he have taken time to show what f1 is all about.
Let the f1 car activate the drs
Stock engine TT huracans are insane !
They can’t hold that lambo
I saw f1 and clicked on the video
If that F1 was to have the same power it’ll be another story
Honda civic casually driving by
Where is the Tesla plaid?
Why isn't yanni driving the lambo?
This Lamborghini vs Chiron waiting 🔥🔥🔥
BEST DRAG RACE 🥵
#carwow i am confused the f1 car beat buggati Chiron in privious race which have 1500hp but in this race the rb7(f1) car not able to catch a Lamborghini which have 1200hp . Please anyone who explain me this mystery .  I know the Lamborghini is tuned up by twin turbo and ecu remapping and etc but still it got 1200hp less than buggati 1500hp .
What was the times?
Wear a helmet at that pace! So fast
Gtr 1300 hp ?  Around 1000 max.
Its nice to hear f1 car
on the first track after 3-4 laps, F1 doubles both cars hehe
Rimac does the 1/4 in 8.6 and Chiron would spank a Rimac at a mile so god knows how u guys comparing all these cars lol the Chiron is king and has the highest top speed could float past the Lambo without trying lol in a mile
Awesome!!!!
Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 kiks ass all of this cars.
Get a 1500hp huracan vs the rimac nevera
That formulat 1 car sounds like a mosquito
the most charismatic the most charismatic and interesting youtuber in the world 😁😉👍👍👍
A tuned car that actually works consistantly
Now I want to see that huracan vs Rimac Nevera
Next: Plane vs Helicopter
We need the 1600hp R35 ack to race against the Lambo and the F1 car. This wasn't a fair competition to the Nismo. Still subbed even if the Nissan lost lol
Only in the rarified atmosphere of Carwow, a sports car making 9.3 seconds in the quarter mile, can finish last 😅
that lambo is just on another planet
That Lambo its nuts
We want Jesko vs chiron
This channel.. welp breaking every world record.. lol
Poor Mat got too excited and sounded like a high-pitched pubescent girl.
im refusing to believe that f1 car is that slow
Imagine Porsche got tuned
That lambo against the rimac nevera🤩
Why is an F1 car more expensive that a SpaceX Falcon rocket?  Simple answer : They're over priced! Their fair market technology price is barely above 350k per car.
Holy sheepshit Batman ..!  Insane
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
341345 gear shifts on the F1 car or is it me?
No one cares about brake test f1 car full of excuses still got smashed every single time no contest lambo is a beast
This Lamborghini Is Dope 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥👌
That Lambo is nuts!
In next video you should do the same Drag Race with the same cars but also tune that f1
ThT F1 just got dropped big tym
Ill say it again lambos are the faster cars to tune up to low 7 second 1/4 miles and their kings over the 1/2 mile or longer. Gtrs are the 1/4 mile kings tho past low 7s
Matt: jumps the start by a second each time Everyone in the comments: Waow teh Lamborghiniz DESTROYED da F1 EBIC! :DDD
I think the Rimac and Chiron would spank the lambo In a mile race
Finally says I am sitting. (Otherwise mat says : I'm sat 🙄)
"I just fucked off"                -Mat Watson 2021
I once saw a ugr tr aventador going bat shit insane, tt Lamborghini’s rarely loose.
I want to see this Lambo vs The Chiron vs The Remac😶
Gotta give it to DC. He is, the nicest guy in the championship...
For all the Lambo Fanboys who were waiting for this moment.............
Price for that gtr!?
Love when they take the rear of a lambo, looks insane
please do this drag race with the 10-cylinder f1 maybe the bmw or the ferrari f2004 and you will see that the result is anything but.
That’s absolutely insane
Infkincredible.
There is no way that GTR is 1300hp, cuz if it was, you'd just see its ass disappearing in front of you
Put that Lambo up against Nevara
Oh it doesn’t rain in UK
Drag race Chiron, Nevera, F1 and the v10 1300hp tuned Lambo Huracan
Now that’s a drag race video
The F1 no use drs and kers?
Add the rimac nevera to the race
Hypercar vs Hypercat matt! Koenigsegg Vs Bugatti
Do a Lynkan Hypersport
Lambo Owners  Attendance Please😂🔥
7.14 the lambo actually jumped the 3rd gear 😂 from 2nd gear to 4th gear like who needs gears let's just skip some 😂
What happened to Godzilla?
65 mil for that F1 car lolzzz
Get a streched busa on drag race
What in the Too Much Big hp Going on here
Mclaren speedtail or P1 or 720s vs F1 😎 that would be a killing rag ever i think.....
Need to see rimac Vs chiron Vs LLF GTR!!
I'm sure that lambo in very loud jeeeezzzz wicked lambo and great work on tuning👀👀👀🔥🔥🔥🔥😂😂😂😂
Bah its raining… 😒👎🏼👎🏼
Can we not get Jurgen's JUN GTR on the show?
COULTHARD HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN EMBARRASSMENT
F1 car with McLaren F1
8 9s 💪🏆
if it wasn't for the difference in weight, gtr would win
What about the new TESLA PLAID vs F1 car ?
Why is there a wing on the huracan? Makes it slower
David be like: "Silverstone will tell the truth"
Yianni must be jumping around like he's won the lottery because of that hurcan
The fact that you can actually feel that Lamborghini's power, the way how Mat is talking
what happened to the back of the lambo 😕
Daaammmmn 400k views in 4 hours...way to go @carwow!
the Lambo looks like a Honda bumped into its back 😅😂
Carwow's races are getting crazier and crazier
I think @yianni would have done a better job in the F1 car. Christian Horner won't be happy.😁
"Matt Watson here. Today I'm riding a beam of light and next to me is Yanni in a gravitational wave.."
Yall brought the wrong gtr
wheres the bmw m5 evolve?
Flatten out those wings when you do drag races.
Let's throw a 1200hp Porsche in there for the boiiz. Would like to see how that compares to the lambo.
Got to get your hands on a plaid and put it up against the big boys! I’d imagine it’ll do well on the 1/4 but maybe not so great over the mile!
The Lambo doesn’t have a rolling race lunch? Because most of the TT Huracan’s has a rolling race lunch
Need to try get a current f1 car on track
how about race these cars againts a ferrari f2004
Smoking an f1 car with a f1 champion driver ..says how crazy that lambho actually is..!
Man I miss the sound of the f1 v8
Bonkers, just getting a F1 team to join this drag race is impressive
220mph that was insane i love lamborghini huracan
Oneday everyday 💖 the Lamborghini 🥰
Plot twist : Coulthard had set in pit limiter .😂
Nice work mat
Put the rear bumper back on.... like if you agree
Dark Knight Wins
Need an older f1 car these new ones are slow as hell but still I would be gassed as hell to be part of this need a 90s f1 car. Or a group b rally car lol
Zu krass
The launches that Lamborghini can pull of - What the hell even is that?! It's nuts!!
Wtf…….
Most impressive comparison, thanks!
F1 cars are so overrated
David Coulthard?! How bonkers is that then 🤩🤩🤩 A real CarWOW!
Sooo... is the F1 time officially new drag record? I mean, after  all, it is a stock car xD
The thing that it is just mindblowing is the performance of F1 car compared to the other. Road cars have a LOTTTT less downforce so this performance with less hp and 1/2 weight is insane
The GTR is fast tho
Could we do that lambo vs the nevera
WHERE IS THE ICONIC "I'M SAT"
Could we do that lambo vs the nevera
please more like this 😍
Buzzy’s Lambo vs Rimac Nevera next🙌🏻
This was awesome to watch, great job guys! I wish they could do the same two cars but against 1983 Brabham F1 car with BMW M12/M13 1.5l turbo four cylinder engine in qualifying mode pushing 1400hp! Now that would be epic to see. It probably wouldn't win the drag race but the roll race would be epic to watch.
Can anyone give credit to the gtr???
Maybe it can go more than what bugatti can do right?
Holy shit that was epic
We all want the f1 to win
The lambo is crazy, but he jumped the start literally every time lol
*Red Bull* : “ok, we think we should add some turbos”
One of best best drags
nevera vs bugatti plz
Somebody get Matt a proper comms set up!
Get in touch with DMO and race his Lamborghini twin turbo !! @DMO deejay
No Racetrack. Slippy underground.
Supra kids happy hearing for a race supra vs lambo  The lambo :
This lamborghini vs rimac nevera to see who is the king
Rimac vs lambo we want it! 🔥🔥
Dude some is wrong with that F1 car
That's Insane.
No yianny????
How many times will u jump the start matt jumped twice
It will be a good match if this Lambo race with Rimac.
1200hp lambo vs rimac please
Matt always jumps the start 😂
ما يطرب البشر غير الشفر
This nissan are so slow hahah 100hp more and so slow.
The Rimac Nevera would still have smashed the Huracan
H2R vs 1200 hp Lambo
F1 cars are made for downforce, not straight line speed. It was still so damn worthy to see that 750 HP RB keeping up with a 1300 HP GT-R. Obviously no doubt that the RB would demolish the other 2 on a track.
Video inutile come al solito. Complimenti
When a lambo has a turbocharger, all other cars are just too slow in comparison
This Lamborghini vs Buggati
Any way Redbull can send over one of the v10's?
Everybody gangsta till u see a Lamborghini without the rear bumper
2021, still using walkie talkie :D no phone service here?
Imagine being stupid enough to buy the r35 nismo for 30k more than the Huracan. Goes to show how old the GTR tech is and how badly it needs a revision.
They wanted to compete with a tuned Turbo but RedBull said no 😂
ලැම්බෝ තමයි හොදටම කලේ 🇱🇰
get that lambo against a chiron
why do they dragrace the rb7 with hards and not softs?
Gerald is that you?
Disclaimer Mat Watson wearing shorts !!!
you can't just take the cost of the entire f1 season too calculate the cost of the car because then that includes a bunch of expenses that does not affect the car things like driver salaries the race team, cost of the weekends. the 62m number is probably way higher than what it actually cost to design and build the car
I'd love to see that lambo vs the rimac bcs they have the same time
8.9s 1/4 mile? That's faster than the Tesla Plaid WR set recently. The hell
Do a drag race tournament
Can u race this lambo a mk4 Supra and a Bugatti
You know this car is insane when Matt looks like he's about to shat himself
This was mad 🤣🤣🤣🤣
That was an awesome race. You guys just keep pushing the boundaries. Keep up the great work
The weight of the F1, Matty boy.
Tunes GTR is a piece of sh*t
get david to open DRS
we need to see rimac vs thise lambo
8.9 sec 😳😳 my dinner just fell out of my mouth
RedBull is doing a great job, making this possible for the fans. Love it
Porsche 919 Evo,  Rimac nevera, Formula 1 ... close call between rimac and 919
F1 vs nevera
The lambo is the best car for the rolling race VROOM VROOM!!!!!
Can you not get the new or older f1 cars , you've picked an f1 car that wasn't very fast but had amazing downforce
The most exciting Drag till date Mat!!😍😍😍😍
6:34 whats wrong with Dave Coulthardt , he sounds like Stephen Hawking!   Probably loosing 3 times made him pretty sad. :)
Can we just take a moment to appreciate the sound of that F1 car!!!
😱😱😱👽👽👽
Classic mat always cheating the starts
Why isn’t Yianni in the huracan?
Shame you couldn’t get hold of a more recent f1 car, the hybrid turbo era, now that I’d like to see
Best sounding drive by ever 😳
Would be extremely nice to see these races with a V10 F1 car, from 2004 or 2005
V10 pulls
Wasn’t the RB7 powered by a Renault engine?  🤔 Did they just put Honda stickers on it or did they retrofit a honda powerplant?
Lamborghini vs Rimac 🏁🏁🏁
Why not make a timed lap on a track  Cause I suppose that's where most of the cars will actually come in picture
I'd love to see the rimac vs the F1 car
I LOVE the fact that the gtr is built and they haven’t ruined the outside they’ve kept it almost completely stock looks nice and clean and is a super car sleeper  For people saying a gtr isn’t a sleeper. What I’m saying by super car sleeper is normally a gtr is a quick car but it can’t smoke lambos ferraris and nearly keep up with an F1 car, this gtr has HyperCar levels of performance from a super car hence me calling it a super car sleeper
That tuned lambo is shifting gear so fast like it's racing itself 🥴
Could you release the times for the fastest runs as well?
Saya tunggu versi indonesia
Red bull need to bring the RB16b next time you race.
so now we want this Lambo against the Rimac Nevera
"you ok hun?" hahahahhaha
Matt dude, put on that lambo against de nevera, a 911 turbo and the f1 car that would be epic!
That F1 car has better power to weight ratio, why the Lambo won?
THATS CRAZY
that F1 car brakes like...Wowwww...
The GTR done incredibly considering it was the cheapest there by a huge amount.
Wow! That Lambo!
New King in drag race ❤️
twin turbo lamborghini huracan's should always be bumper deleted in my opinion
4:33       Matt should really be on top gear,he would make a better host than all of the new ones
I understand the performance would be completing different for the F1 in a track race but it's upsetting to see a 62 million car running second 3 times in a row from a 200k car
Please try drag racing those tuned supercars against MotoGP bikes... that would be FANTASTICCC😁😁😁
220mph 😉
Needs a V10 04 or V6 20 to compete here  V8 was one the slowest in a straight line
Drag race don’t count if you’ll never warm up your tires ☹️
Omg lambo killed both cars 😲
Consider how insanely fast these all are, and then realize that if there was a Rimac Nevera here, they'd be left in dust by a huge gap. :)
My favorite video 👌 now
The F1 Sound 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
Forgot gtr cost
THIS LAMBO VS RIMAC NEVERA!!!!
Please get Ricky's 2000 bhp GTR or Project Tango vs the Rimac!
Winner: Rimac (8.6s)
The dislike is from the Nissan gtr funs
Shout out to Jurgen Vallon from JM Imports ....... 100% respect to you bro ...... Such a humble cool person ....... Crazy builds on cars as well at JM imports  ...... 🔥🔥🔥🔥😎
That Gtr number is legend😆
Finally time to call the rimac..
A good race would be that lamborghini vs rimac vs buggati pls do that race it will be incredible
I did not expected that Lambo to destroy everything, wow
It’s fascinating how a car can cost as much as or more than a private jet or a single airbus.
The F1 CAR is INSANE :D
"I am sitting" ....ewww...no "I AM SAT"
Tesla Plaid: I AM KING 👑 60-130 in the 4’s   TT AWD builds: “I still have 3 more boost settings after 1200whp you do know this right?”
When Buzzysingh drives his lambo He becomes Buzz Lightyear 😎😎😎
sounded like the F1 car had a 25 speed gearbox
he forgot to say how much the gtr wAs
Kirke Danose helped me understand the technical analysis, now I can examine the current chart and predict which direction the market will go. She is definitely the best professional trader I know
F1 vs 1200hp Lambo vs NEVERA !!
Hmm. I wonder what the result would be if F1 were be from 2020
I did not expect the lambo to be THAT fast! Insane!
F1 ❤️❤️❤️💕
This only tells me one thing the 911 turbo s is quick af
Put some soft tyres on the f1 he would smash it😂
Yay Matt didn't lose his job!
Matt's reaction on that first run had me in absolute stitches ahahaha 😂😂😂😂
TEDBULL F1 🏎 AND DC.  Are THE BEST 😏 epic epic race
Where the jdm fanboys at?
When you see a Lambo with no rear bumper, you know you are done lmao
1200 hp my ass! :-) Let’s see your Dyno charge for that Lambo!
Almost 6M!!
.
F1 car killed the Bugatti Chiron Tuned Lambo killed the F1
Like to see them around a track 😂
We need a race between the rimac and the lambo please
Where is civic with laptop?
Now do this same race but thru a 90 degree corner lol
Matt did this is the last F1 video - "The team budget was x and there was 4 cars so this car costs x/4" I'm pretty sure team budgets cover more than just the cars (travel, etc) so I don't think the F1 car would be that expensive
imagine yanni drive GTR
Super funny 🤣🤣👏🏻🙋🏻😂
Carwow can organise any drag race  Plz Bring  the  M5cs
Great performance LAMBO.
Took three goes to get Matt to stop jumping the start 🤣
One if the best yet, i seen that lambo on the JM imports channel and had no idea it was so fast 👍
Nevera Vs this lambo
Now an F1 of 1000hp
That Lamborghini is mad
What is an old formula one car such as Senna’s when they still had 1200hp and weighed naff all gonna perform like these days against these machines?
It may have made a difference. The F1 car was using hard tires. Soft tires would have launched harder.
Lambo is so ugly...
holy fuck man
Turbo Viper
Rimac vs that Lamborghini please 🙏
GTR driver just can't drive
Mat always jumps.
Awd civic next
Just get that crazy lambo against rimac nevera
this tuned lambo vs rimac, fix it Matt
That Lambo would be sick against the Rimac
Like Jeremy Clarkson says, this “lambo” just fucks off
that GTR get destroyd
Next SSC Tuatara Vs Bugatti Chiron Vs F1
Don't you think it's ridiculous when they put the current season's livery on the old car? I mean come on, Honda wasn't even in F1 back
Made a drag race with tuned chiron, lambo would cry
So that reg number reads as buses to me
I'm trying to get a better deal on the F1 car through your site but can't find it. Lol 🤣
65 millions just got flushed
1200hp Lamborghini vs f1 car vs rimac please
Another awesome episode..
That Lambo!!! Wow
David Coulthard, the legend, give him the respect he deserves mat! He is the hero today
WE ALL KNOW NOW THAT THE RACE TO MAKE IS "GREEN LAMBO VS RIMAC"
This lambo vs Rimac vs Danny's lambo 😂
I wasn’t sure wether or not to buy the F1 for 62.5M£ but after this drag race I’m convinced! Thank you Matt Watson and Carwow! Can you get me a deal so that I can save a few thousand pounds? Thanks!
The GT-R put up a good fight but that Lambo is just too insane
that's like DMO's only faster
That Huracan just fucks off.
Matt I’m pretty sure the RB7 is not an automatic 😅😅
The best one yet, and that f1….fuck me what a sound 🤤
Won't the F1 car be faster with some soft tyres
Is that the fastest car you’ve driven Matt?
Bloody awesome. The best one yet Matt 💪
The Rimac should have been in this as well 😒
Bugatti Chiron x this Lambo x this GTR???
Gtr is like the avarage passmark to beat 😂.. Did you beat a gtr? Good.. Thats a good car 😜
F1 of 2011 lol
That Lambo needs a Chiron w16 challenge. Waiting for you to make it happen @MatWatson. Watching from Namibia
NEXT RACE RICKYS GTR AGAINST THE LAMBO
GTR need a another tuning 😂😜😜
Absolutely insane this race!!! The best ever ever ever!!!
Aaa good old days, redbull stil terrible at startings
Now I'd like to see a drag race between this lambo and Rimac!!!
Lambo vs rimac nevera
This would have been a good time to have a Porsche 911 join in
How would the current formula 1 cars go here? Are they a lot faster than the one DC drove here?
OMG im interest to see what car can beat nevera.
👌👌👌👌
Lambo sounds really good.
Look, almost nothing beats a bumper-less Lambo😐😐...
That price of F1 is insane. Totally unacceptable
Incredible
This Lamborghini vs Rimac Nevera that Will be close
GTR’s are shite man
Matt on that rolling race start LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RBR gets its engines from Honda now, but back then their supplier was Renault. Do they also use Honda engines in older cars? It's weird to see the Honda logo if they use a Renault engine
Ahh When F1 cars used to weigh only 600 odd kgs.
And the F1 car now need a million dollar clutch lmao this cars are not ment to hard launch , that Lambo tho..... Only 220k that's a hell of a good deal!!
The gtr is an outdated drag platform, a Gallardo would give it a run for it's money.
Me and David couthard go back to the PlayStation 2 days with formula 1 and Michael Schumacher glad to see he’s doing, yes I’m a American .
From my experience that gtr is not making 1300 since it lost that bad to a 1200 hp lambo. What hp was it tuned on??
That Lamborghini goes as good as it sounds car goals. 👌🏼
Drag race request THE NEW BMW M5 COMPETITION VS THE NEW BMW M5 CS
I would not lend my car if I don't appear in the video.
Did not expect that result! Keep up the good work guys!
That Lambo is just insane, can I have one please !!!
You should bought the Rimac.
its a great era when peoples road cars are faster than F1 cars
Awesome!!!!!
These cars are mental! I love the GTR aka godZilla so much but it was demolished. I did notice however it was very close to formula one car near finishes so I guess these cars are crazy as for the price, let’s not🙆🏾‍♂️⚰️🤒
I see GTR, I click 👍🏼
Here I'm missing yianni😂😂
Is the F1 car on hards?
Note to self: modified Lamborghini > F1 car
Hi Mat, cool Chanel Need a new electro Lambogini plaid) don't thank follow Mat :)
Hi Mat. I want a drag race from your team. The drag should be between Rimac Nevara and the Formula 1.
That f1 car sounds like it has a 30 gears gearbox😂😂
Awesome!!! I think every cars is win
F1 on HARDS .....!!!!!!!!!
That was just awesome 👏 👏👏. That Lambo, damnnnnnn!
What is 0-60 time in that lamborghini huracan? Maybe 2 seconds or 1.9?
lamborrghini limr ni 4000 wow shout out pilss buy nic
A F1 car doing a drag race feels bad, the amount of downforce they have kills their top speed, but put one corner and the F1 will come on top. The F1 car doesn't have any fans so they need their crew to put some hand held fans on their radiator.
Esperava mais do GTR de 1300hp.
Help me car wow, I'd like to buy an F1 car
I wonder what the speed rating on the huracans tires are lmao
How about dude that owns the Lamborghini can officially say his car has spanked an F1 car. On video.
f1 car vs Tesla model s PLaid??
Was the f1 driver asleep?
Carwow racing 👎fake. Street racing 👍good.
62 million was wasted
Why someone would dislike this video, I don't know. But this was f'ing awesome
This is the another reason, why Lamborghini never made turbo cars and just kept it natural.
Why is everyone so hyped about the sound of a turbo
Next: this lambo vs f1 vs rimac. Or this lambo vs rimac.
Did he say 2.4 l naturally aspirated v8 making 750hp????? Thats insane
Matt u jump the line
Hurcan Witb No Bumper Is Scaaaaaary
The one time the lambo is fucking nuts, yanni isnt there lmao
thats one hella drag race man
I wonder how the results would have been like if they threw a 2021 f1 car and  used drs. Amazing vid!
Race starts at 03:30
Take those cars around the track, and the turns will show case why the F1 car costs millions of dollars.  Using this logic, why not launch against proper drag racers?  We do appreciate the speed and capabilities otherwise of these two street racers.
2 AWD cars vs a RWD in the wet. Seems fair
What a job, Matt Is a lucky guy
That was awesome 😂😂
GP2 engine
OMG in the third race  i was smashing the ground for that f1 ' goosebumps ya'll
Yeah do a lap around a track then you'll see what is the f1 car made of
Wow wow wow best drag races ever. Matt and car wow are smashing it. Miles ahead of the game.
"At the mile we would definietly have the advantage over you". Haha.. What bull crap is that? :) The faster and longer you go after the 1/4 mile the more the 750hp is going to lose out to any higher number. Nothing inticated that you started to gain on the Lambo.
this lambo vs rimac
Yanny is grinning widely somewhere 😂 Lambo Poweeerrr
How much can carwow save me on that F1 I couldn’t find it on the site? who am I kidding I can’t afford to put cheese on a whopper
need these to race on a circuit next
Juergen should have brought Ricky’s GTR lol
Lambo vs Rimac next ?
Get a underground racing vehicle to race. You haven't seen nothing.
This lambo is incredibly
What about the 2021 redbull?
That Lambo is nuts, love it.
I want a lambo just like that  That thing is insane
I feel ashamed about today’s society bcuz mat had to point out in the subtitles that the skyline is a GTR 8:25
What David really means is: "If team are happy, i can still be pissed off"!
Gtr driver sleeping 💤 ?
You know Carwow are on another level when the slowest Car they are testing is a v8 f1 😂
Nobody Me : where is Yianni
For sure the fastest drag race until now at carwow, good job Matt!
Don't let the performance and time overshadow the fact that all cars had incredible traction
Now I wanna see that Lamborghini vs. the Rimac Nevera
This explains why all Lamborghinis(except URUS) are not fitted with a turbo....this is not one of those cars that you would use to drop your wife at the office but it really is one of those cars to drop your third wife at the office Jesus Christ that's fast!!!! I wonder what PORSCHE think of this........
GTR
Put the red bull on softs for petes sake!
Lamborghini with no bumper😩😳
This lambo vs rimac vs bugaati vs this gtr
When a near 4 million pounds Bugatti is getting kicked by f1  AND A 220K POUNDS LAMBO MOD HURACAN IS Better!!
Hi Matt, any chance to review the new BMW M5 CS?
race the lambo vs the new remac that would be insane
this was fuckin epic
Lambo 1200hp vs Rimac Nivera please 🙏
Bloody hell 😂
The GTR needs R888 tires also.
I GOT IT. F1 CAR V FORMULA E CAR!
What is that Lambo eating rocket fuel?
Where is Yanni :(
we want to see a rematch between Nevera and this incredible lambo
given that the lambo is barely pushing any boost (since it should do over 2000 hp), it is already a weapon. That V10 is a masterpiece.
Hey Matt I want to see a jaguar I pace vs a Porsche macan GTS vs a Tesla vs Mercedes GLE 63 Amg vs a Jeep trackhawk please I need that race
This should be the actual "World's Greatest Drag Race Channel"
Lambo vs rimac
Something is going on with that GTR it shouldn’t of lost against the lambo that bad even from a roll something is off
That is the slowest 1300hp I have ever seen
So much for F1 aerodynamics
Bruh... that GTR is weak...
Bro what they did to this huracan
Finally a TT Lambo. Not to mention that if there was an Underground Racing tuned version and not tuned by "Bill's screwdriver and hammer garage".
Nevera vs the huracan
Matt got some jizz in his pants after the first run.
Loved this
The racing rule says: if a Lamborghini is missing the rear bumper, never race it
You guys should use the moose test aswell
You need a new tesla model s plaid, quarter mile in around 9.2s, same as the f1 car which is insane for a family car.
🤯🤯🤯
This lambo can beat 1900hp rimac nevera with only 1300hp
Lambo with no rear bumper go vrrrrrrroooooom
that lambo is insane
3:30
0-100?
Is it fast than the rimac nevera ??
Lambo vs Rimac PLZZZZ
Omg
I think it would be interesting if this beast the Lamborghini will have a drag race with Rimac!!!!!
The lambo Killed it 🔥🔥🔥
get RedBulls 2021 F1 car and then well see who wins
Can we get a clean pair of pants for Mr Watson please?
does lambo have a go against Nevera?
F1 vs nevera vs tuned ferrari superfast
I want to see this Lambo against 911 turbo s tuned
Damn, that Lamborghini is mental!
I dont have to say it but… Nevera vs THAT Lambo please!!!
“I’ve just fucked off” 😭
I want see david in Lamborghini. Shocked with the power.
Do a tuned r34 vs the F1 car
This was such an exciting race!
That lambo is nutts!!!
Amazing content, way ahead of the petrolhead social media crowd 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Gt3 rs vs f1 car
I just love DC so much. Such a great driver,humble gentleman. This was epic. That Lambo hit 220 like yeah,casual crusing speed on Autobahn,ja.
Wow CarWow  Thats a shock , Poor DC was gutted . Looks like you didnt expect it either.  Amazing result . Shows how fast the Rimac is!
This Lamborghini is nuts
We've got to see Ricky's (LLF) gtr on here
ya let the redbulls tires get cold with that into.
Totally pointless do this drag race in the rain.
Best drag race ever!!
Surprise, surprise, Matt in the winning car AGAIN.............
The 62m f1 car gets shit on by 17k worth of tune up of a lambo 😀
8.93s…🤨That’s a Lamborghini 🔥 🔥 🔥
🤯
Lol that Lambo like a missile
Car wow gets better and better haha 👍
do  more drag races with shmee150.
You need to race that lambo against the rimac
Nice
4:58 it sounded like someone humming LMFAO
A Brick is always going be a Brick even if you put 10000hp in it & the GTR proves it.
GTR is a high power and strong car
😱🚀🚀🚀😷
Lambo tt vs rimac nevera ?
My Nissan Juke is tuned. I dropped a 1200 hp GT-R motor in it. 🤡
Would have been nice to have a boring normal car like a Golf R for perspective so that GTR doesn't look so slow 😂
London bus race pls with other old engine
That gtr let's not forget  Is a sports car  Not a super car  But look how good it does
I can already feel Yannie smiling like a lunatic.
221 mph maxed on a Lambo on a runway is just mental
The arse on that Lambo looks like something evil straight out of Mad Max
twin turbie lambo vs turbie s
Wow that lambo.I was not expecting that 😳
Crazy that a car that can walk a championship winning F1 car is road legal. You can literally be 17 and drive that thing in public roads.
Nuts insane crazy fast lambo!!!
Damn F1 car sounds like a damn annoying fly buzzing around.
That Lamborghini is insane 😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥 Yianni tune it like this😜🤪
All your untrained necks may faint if you brake as hard as that rb7
Need a tuned supra Vs Lamborghini Aventador Svj
Considering the performance  150 000 for this insane Lambo feels like total bargain. Those exposed turbo though...
The worst nightmare of the Lambo , but the dream of the rb7 : add cornes
I have such an eargasm from that F1 V8 engine.
I know of a gtr that would tackle that lambo
Epic content ! That brake test tho 🤣
i saw f1 and carwow, i smash like button
62 million wasted ...
This lambo is INSANE 💥💥
Where is godzilla fan boys ?
everybody likes the food except of jürgen, he must würgen
best drag race sofarrrrrrr !!!!
This drag race was bonkers🔥🔥
Yanni would've loved to be in that Lambo! Matt you could've been on the GTR. Lol
and the Formular 1 car isn't really built for straight line speeds, it's a cornering machine.
That Lamborghini hit 354kmh!! Wow!!!‼️
You need to get LLF gtr on a drag race vs a Bugatti Chiron
Wouldn't the f1 car be faster with DRS open?
DRS not open... Not revving to the limit. F1 has to be nerfed... Still, that lambo is unbelievable...
I was always told that quality > quantity. This channel is the exception. The quantity is amazing as is the quality. Zero sacrifice on either. Other than Matts accent, but I can deal with that. Good job guys.
This is mad😫😭♥️
Should race a 1300 horsepower Veilside R34 GT-R.
Race between this Lambo&tuatara
GTR perfect daily driver
F1 sound is incredible
Bring a Porsche 992 turbo s with 1200hp
Yannie should have been in the Lambo seat.
Imagine doing the 1/4 mile in 9.3 seconds and coming last!
Lambo 👍😱
3:30 thank me later🔥
The Rimac Nevera...
Do a drag race btw this lambo and rimac
Now brake and try turn into a corner
that’s a road legal Lamborghini pulling away from a formula 1 car. pfffttt
The fact that a stock plaid 5 seater would’ve been competition is scary
Hard tires, if not we'd be flying.  Love the content Matt. Cheers.
We want this lambo vs Tesla plaid
4:01 orgasm 😂😂😂
You didn’t say the price of the GTR
So how much discount can you and your team at carwow can get on one of these? Lol. Wow what an amazing race for the generation. Nothing road-production I can think off can compete with that lambo. Insane twin turbo power. But let's get a proper Lewis Hamilton f1 car against that in absolute bone dry sunny conditions please!!!!!!
Your editors are epic Matt
Man when you see a green lambo with bomber off you better settle down boy😂😂
matt watson 2021: "THIS JUST FKD OFF!!!" haha amazing content once again
Finally Yanni gets the last laugh 😌😏😈
Lambo Jumped the start twice first two races
The _cleanest_ GTR I've seen in a long while
I'd love to see this again on a bone dry day, reckon the F1 car would be closer
for sure yianni will be happy
So, Lambo vs Rimac?? 😁
I just fucked off hahahahahaha
Gtr whut
Absolutely, incredible content. Great video, very entertaining
How in the hell do you add 2 turbos and call a car "tuned?" Are you stupid on purpose?
Original Lamborghini can't beat this two car
matt you're the best driver  i was shocked lambo wonn amazing vid
F1 car vs Rimac Nevera ⚡⚡🔥🔥
This has to be one of the best and epic race ever against F1 it's unheard-of. Loved it
F1 might have limited power and torque for this kind of purposes.
This lambo vs rimac nevera vs f1 please
That Lambo is insane
Please Carwow Bugatti Chiron vs Ferrari SF90
Carwow: The gift that keeps on giving
This is the ultimate comparison for the car enthusiasts! Greetings from Canada.
I was ded when they showed timings lmao slowest was 9.3 like wtf 😂
Awesome
Gtr apunto de ganarle a f1
None can beat Yianni in that lamborghini
F1 vs ...🙏😊😊🥰
That GTR is something else
Now everyone take corner at 200!
Please make a review about the new Maserati Quattroporte SQ4. Use more maseratis on your videos. Great content.
damn that 911 turbo s is fast and its stock and not an f1
The back of Lamborghini is in the gta online Tuners Update Style 😅
Finally a "tuned" drag race where the cars actually work - I guess with a £70k tune you get what you pay for!
Awsome....thats y we follow carwow🤘
i wanna see that lambo vs the rimac
that Lambo is nuts
They left out the turbo s cause it would win anyways somehow
Fake Red Bull F1.
Lamborghini, Rimac and Plaid! Let's do this Matthew!😜👍🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Give that F1 A DRS hahaha
Insane videos always!!!
So a 150k lambo+ 70k mods is 0.2 slower than a steril 2M Rimac?ill take the lambo
Everything's fine until Lamborghini enters the chat without rear bumper
DAy 8 of asking for the plaid race
Worthy challengers for the rimac 👍👍, this channel is getting lit by the day
Gtr driver sleeps or its bad gearshift
V10 awesome sound and performance
Plaid has already run a 9.08, so it would most likely run right with that Lamborghini and beat the F1 and GTR.  Plaid for the win.
Completely disagree with this race; in the DR, the F1 did not have the heat of the tyres plus rain and no grip hardly, not to mention 4wd vs RWD and Matt jumping the start. The rolling race Matt was miles ahead of the skyline, and the  F1 car was utterly unfair. The only decent part was the equal stopping race. Think a re-race is in order, Matt!
The tunned Lambo have'nt showed up in the Leaderboard  Mat
I’m not sure the F1 car price is correct 🤣
HEY MATT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE REACTION OF  YANNIMIZE AFTER CHECKING THIS GREEN LAMBO 😂😂
The drag race leader board needs to be updated. The second car on the list was just beaten by the Lamborghini in this video. Also the GTR needs to be included just below the RB7. All aside, great video.
Those cars are faster than a Bugatti Chiron
WTF WOW
that gear change after the dropping the walkies was insane lmao
Cowabunga dude
Missing the king of drag races the  tuned 911 turbo !
Race the f1 car with the Rimac Nivera
CarWoW : we want to have a drag races between tuned cars VS F1 car, can we borrow your F1 cars? And bring David Coulthard as well?  Red bull team : say no more.
Can you guys bring the Holy Trinity
YES.YES.YES.
The gtr was busy taking a dump
Lamborghini 1200 HP car a waht!
Rapido en español latinooo
Next time the F1 V10 please !
Time to call Toto…. Get Lewis out there.
Tesla Plaid vs F1 car? 👀
Which one do you think wins A45s VS NISSAN GTR R35?
that lambo is an absolute rocket
He was on the same channel Mat, it’s just that he was so far behind. 😂
Lambo vs RIMAC
The best drag race ever: rimac nevera vs 1200hp lamborghini
That lambo needs to meet that Rimac! Like yesterday!
The Sound of F1 Cars is just nuts
Now put that Lambo against the Nevera cuz honestly they both f**k off
this is why you dont f**k with missing rear bumper lambo hurricanes
How much can we save on the F1 car on carwow Matt?
lowkey, the gtr was catching the lambo in the rolls 😂😂😂
"that was nuts"
we need the 2021 F1 redbull car now for the same race also add the Chiron to mix things up
So a 1200hp performante beat an f1 car, the same f1 a 1500hp Chiron couldn’t beat? Makes sense
you know the lambo is fast when the rear bumper has been removed
8:05 he's used to it
there are 3 cars with blowing ear sounds and you only hear one. tf
Rimac nevera vs that lambo would be an incredible race
drag racing is not a F1 strength it is more the weakness.   that RB7 top end is like 320kmh.   it would be interesting to see how long it takes a F1 car to catch these cars on a track like Silverstone
Ламборгіні 🔥👑💙💙💙💛💛💛
Titanic Vs maglev next please
sir plz have this lamborgini turbo with rimac nevera
Is this f1 car is still working?
masya Allah....great race respect from indonesia
we got a lambo with no bumper, now we want a civic with laptop inside
ICE cars 😍 who need EV?
We need the rimac vs bumper delete Lamborghini
Best race ever
Epic….
I mean the GTR did the 1/4 mile in 9.3... thats still incredibly fast
The editing makes it sound like a F&F drag race with all the shifting
Lamborghini 1,200 hp vs Rimac nevera
U need a 1700-1800hp gtr to win a tt 1200hp huracan
Blooming incredible!
Just imagin if the rb7 was on red slicks
Now I'm actually curious as to what this F1 engine could achieve if they were to put it in a car designed for acceleration, like the lambo... I figure 8, maybe 7 seconds
We need 2005 V10 Formula 1 car
@carwow, Please send this video to Lambo HQ to raise some brows. A Bi-Turbo Aventador is what we need right now
That's Lambo vs rimac nevera Waiting for that
Wow
That huracan is incredible
Bring back the "I'm Sat in a __________ "
Lambo sounds best
imagine lambo making a car with twin turbos....      damn!!!!!!
Cool R8
I love your videos
F1 will win :edit, HUH? HOW…
I love how matt shows us how to subscribe to his channel in all of his videos😂
Get the Cayenne Turbo GT on here
Jurgen is a legend
Might be a silly question but why doesn’t Lamborghini make F1 cars surely they’ll top the competition
Lamborghini vs rimac it would be  interesting
Does each of them reaching 1 MPG?
Now have 3 laps around a track in same cars 😂
This video and cars are absolutely unbelievable! !!!!! Thank you Carwow!
Lambo is insane 😳
So I’m sitting… barbecue sauce on my tittis
That was probably the best brake test ever. I know it's the lightest of the three but the way the F1 car stopped on a dime was awesome 👌
I love this channel
stock 911 turbo s would've beaten the lambo
Can we se a video with: Rimac nevera v f1 car v 1200 hp Lamborghini
wow!  the best one so far.  great stuff mate
please this lambo v rimac v chiron v F1 car
You know the lambos fast when it makes a 9.3 car look slow
Congratulations Matt, you just changed the F1 Business. 😁👏👏👏 IMPRESSIVE!!
hati hati sama huracan trondol 😂
Content just keeps getting better
Would love to see Yanni driving that insane lambo
That Lambo is scary but Matt definitely jumped both starts
That’s the best drag race I’ve ever seen 🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇
Lamborghini Huracan top top top❤️
U should race the Lamborghini and the Bugatti
Yianni would be happy. For sure.
That Lambo started to look like a bargain
A like is obligatory at this point!
Vote for Matt drives F1 car himself
Im not gonna lie the gtr seemed slow comparing to the lambo till I saw the lambo did the 1/4mile in 8.9s and gtr 9.3
Race this lambo with a stock one let’s see the difference
Waiting for the Tesla plaid
The Lambo sounded better than the F1. You can't change my mind.
This race is just insane man !!! THIS IS NUTS !
I would like see what my grandparents launched at green lights: a drag race between a Trabant/Volga/Moskvitch/Lada. Some retro Eastern block please!
So Epic
F1 sounds like a Mosquito😅
the Rimac would have smoked all of them
Sheeeeeeeeeeeeesh!
Was it raining as well ?!
AT 7:14 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!
Race that Lamborghini against the Rimac Nivera
Slowest car ran a 9.3 😂😂😭😭
All the expensive cars and no headset walkies...
We need a race between This lambo and the rimac nevera!!!🙂
A F1 car as slow as a Datsun? How is that possible? I expected the F1 car to destroy both completely, despite it's driving on the hard and probably cold tires.
Best drag in the world!!!
THAT LAMBO IS CURRENTLY THE FASTEST I/C ENGINE CAR ON CARWOW!
That's not the Mat I know......
where is the godzilla??? where is the JDM    king of speed????  JDM fansboy speechless...  🤣🤣🤣
That F1 car was somehow disappointing.
Imagine doing 9.3 sec to a quarter mile and finish 3/3 man that lambo was insane....
*Next video:* "Hi guys, Matt Watson here, so I'm sitting on the Comet Encke and next to me is the Voyager 1... and we're gonna have a drag race 😃"
NEXT: Dragster Top Fuel VS F1 Car.
Bonkers
Yo buzzy singh
Incredible Lambo tuning. GTR had weight disadvantage. Would like to see Lambo competes Rimac
Get the F1 car on Monza spec please. It wasnt a fair race for it 🥲
Officially the fastest car on carwow
Siapa yg nonton ini orang indonesia likee klo memang ada🔥
you guys can get a Formula 1 car but somehow can't get a Mclaren 765LT :( pls I want to see 765LT drag races
Now mat pls make this race: rimac vs lambo
I thought "fortunately it doesn't rain". Then they drive off and it rains
Bro i cant imagine one car that can beat that lambo
So much management to maintain the condition of these cars to prevent further damage, incredible. Some of the best performance cars in the world in this video.
F1 seemed to be shifting early for the v8. I guess they dont want to rip it for youtube likes
Who is killer gtr killer or lamborghini killer ?
The Lambo get x2 of its HP!
Now I you have to bring a huracan ugr with 3500 hp to see your reaction
All wheel drive traction is the key…along with massive power.
Absolutely insane!!!  That Lambo!! Cool to watch the F1 too,  cheers red bull and the owners, impressive for sure  😬♥️😎👍💪
Let's see the Lambo Vs F1 car over the standing mile to see if indeed David can win at the top end! 😀🤘🚀 .
amazing race but drive the fucking cars cool down please that is irritating me
Lambo with rear bumper off: *danger*
Looks like you have to do a test with the Lambo and the Rimac now.
Start measuring distance for break test
Lamborghini needs to comeback in F1 again!
David thought the r35 was still a skyline lol
Well nice It must be no. 1 on trending
OMFG 😍😍😍😍😍😍
THM’ Don’t mess with a twin turbo lambo
That's the best carwow video 😃😃😎
Everything is gangsta until a bumper less lambo arrives.
“If the team is happy, I’m happy” we heard it for 2 videos already, hope we’re gonna hear it again  in the future vid
Mat here from carwow, I'm sat in a literal particle of light and next to me is a starship and we're gonna have a drag race to alpha centauri.
Chiron vs Agera RS Matt, let’s settle the debate.
F1 cars are getting slower when compared to modern sports car. This result was impossible 10 years ago. This shows F1 should improve engine max output instead of aero tweaks or hybrid tech.
let Yanni drive that Lambo....would luv to see his scary reaction.....Matt.....!!!!
that F1 car doesn't worth 62 million :)))))))))))))))))
F1 cars are not what they just to be, back then during the "Senna era", formula 1 cars had between 900-1400 horsepowers and turbo. F1 cars was also hard to drive and the drivers had to struggle with their cars while driving, now that's called skills.
Why is there no DRS?
That lambo was fasttt needs to race a buggati chiron
why didn't david turn on the DRS
8.9 Jesus Christ lol, that's insane 🤣😭
Matt : David, do you want one more go? David : Yup, if my team happy, I'm happy. Matt : David, do you want some cake? David : Yup, if my team happy, I'm happy. Matt : David, do you want some tea? David : Yup, if my team happy, I'm happy.
We want that lambo to race with rimac nivera 🔥🔥🔥
Podaa poori mone myre power.. 🔥🚀
Bye bye supra
Why not bring real F1 cars, from 2003-2006 not this downsized V8 garbage. Still good reace, but hurts to see F1 car demolished like that.
WOOAAAH GREATEST RACE EVER!!💣💥🚀🚀🚀😎
next time a naascar  stock car race?
Want to waste your time?  Then head to Crapwow, and my team will help you waste a lot of your time by uploading every day. Crapwow, your annoying, aggravating, irritating one stop time wasting car comparison site!
Do an SF90 Stradale vs F1 car?
Cool 😎
1:55 yeah nevermind the driver's salaries, travel costs, etc .. each car is maybe a couple mil at most .. could be a tiny bit more accurate
Do an SF90 Stradale vs F1 car?
We NEED to see the lambo vs the Rimac nevera!!
Нормально настроенный гтр порвал бы ламбу... Вечно у них гтр сливает
That Lamborghini is next level
Next up! Bugatti vs TT Lambo
音が良すぎる
JDM KIDS=Nothing can kill Modded Supra and GTR,And always compare it with Exotic Supercars💀 Modded Lamborghini=You re joking right mate?
That lambo was on semi slicks, the GT-R was on Michelin PS4S and the RB7 was on hard compound tyres. This ain’t fair. 😂
Espectacular Carwow. Los autos que conseguis! Son increibles.  Creo que este es el mejor videos de todos. Muy bueno!!!
Need some caterham rs500  What say ?
That lambo.. whaaaaaaatttt🤯
All quicker than the Chiron
Matt: I can hear the f1 car where is it  The Lamborghini turbos: I don’t think so
And yet, I will always take a GT-R over a lambo.
the gtr is too loud
Next: that lambo vs rimac nevera
I've saved this drag race in my watch later. Appsolutely nuts.. 😎😎😎😎
Remember when we thought the Porsche 911 Turbo was insanely fast by doing 10.2sec over a 1/4 mile? Now put in perspective that next to the tuned Hurican with 8.9sec. Absolutely insane performance! *Well done to Mat and his team for achieving this level of content!*
RIMAC VS LAMBO?? Would be interesting
Please that Lamborghini against Rimac Nevera
So who would win ina race between that tuned lambo and bugatti chiron....can u guys do that? :)
That lambo is f*cking fast... Need more videos with it.
So if you have slightly more hp than a Model S Plaid then you win?
mat is the type of a guy who wishes to race a train till the tracks end
u shuld make a race between this lamborghini annd a bugatti chiron
Probably the best drag race I've ever seen so far !
Yeeeeeeh. Nice drag race♥️♥️♥️♥️
220 mph crazy
Genuine question, but why didn't the Red Bull activate the DRS? Not that it would made much of a difference since it's probably limited by gearing up to this point, but still.
We want to see an f1 car from 2021
That tuned Nissan is faster than the Bugatti Chiron, when you raced the Chiron with the Red bull F1 car the Chiron took 9.6 sec
F1 car had huge drag with those big wings.
Best of the best lambo for  all time
Bugatti chiron was crying of watching this video 😂
Nice but when's the 1/4 mile foot race between matt and yianni?
amazing how arrogant watson is,incredible
Yeah mate this is a great video
Like Glorious Purpose that F1 sounds.
The tuned Lambo is in its own league
Who are the 300 morons that dislike this video?  You all should be punished
Can you stop saying the f1 cars cost xx million dollars the season costs include wayyy more than just the four cars
is that lambo the fastest they’ve had?
I have seen the world and can die in peace now😌
Next video: I'm sitting in f-22 raptor and next to me is a sr-71 blackbird and we're going to do a drag race! 😂 😂
All i can is the F1 car, it's so loud 🤯
Nothing is faster than a 5.2 l twin turbo v10. The Audi R8 and the Huracan are the fastest cars tuned
Wooooooow... ❤️
RB7 using Renault engine right? So this is rb7 with 2021 skin? Or its honda inside as well?
Just wow
The real question is how would todays mercedes f1 do against them, cmon matt if u could bring 2011 car u can try to bring lets say 2018 or maybe 19 car it surely is faster than 2011
What is that lambo being fed…goodness
Moral of the story----  Never, ever, EVER mess with a Lamborghini, with a missing rear bumper!!!
I bet Buzz is Over The Moon with these results 😂😂
U should have also added in a stock chiron and senna
Great race though
GTR tuning is messed up. Launch controll has had a downgrade.
Where is yanni now the races are beginning boring
That Huracan is from another planet, oh my lord.
That lambo should not be road legal 😶🔥
I’m sorry but rear bumper delete Lamborghinis are ugly, I’d rather have style than weight reduction for more speed.
That huracan is literally on triple steroids
Bloody hell these drag races are amazing!
Now a race between the evolve m5 , this huracan and a 911
Amazing
1200 hp 911 would beat all of them
WT F1
I think that Lamborghini faster than Bugatti 🤔
Waiting 911tubo vs this lambo
do e1 next
This is exactly how an F1 car should sound like.
8.9 is Carwow record right?
Remember that is a old f1 car
I need to get me a twin turbo huracan now
That Lambo got from expensive to priceless after this video 🤯
Please get the new F1 car and put it again that tuned ridiculous hurricane Lamborghini. That thing is ridiculously fast, I think it might be the fastest road car on a straight line
Godzilla
this is the type of videos i wanna see, just some ridiculous machines going against eachother
the fact that 9.3 1/4 mile was the slowest blew my mind
The question is ….. was the lambo faster than the Rimac?
Verstappen wants to know Matt's Location 😜
Lambooooooo
Now please: Rimac Nevera Vs this Lambo 🙏
We want an F1 with DRS system open
Imagine you lost a drag race with 9.3 seconds.
This was awesome!! Please do more of these special car drag races 💪
"The Nissan was last completing the quarter mile in 9.3 seconds" 😂😂😂😂
When Nevera vs F1.
Once again we learn one of the most important lessons in life. ~Never mess with a Lambo that has no rear bumper
The best part has to be when DC called GTR as Skyline!  But dammm that was some serious number 8.9s! slowest car being 9.3s and the V8 F1 sound 🤤🤤🤤🤤
SO the GTR that came last can beat a bugatti Chiron
Remember when the fastest car in Carwow was Porsche 911 Turbo S? Good times
that insane race... i think f1 will win...
Please do a drag between This Tune Lambo and Rimac Nevera ⚡
Hey isn't that lambo Damon's former car
Sounds like Mat is haunted by a wasp
That lambo is on another level 🔥 nearly Ripped matt’s arms off
Lamboo vs Nevera????
Seriously, don’t mess with a no-bumper Lambo.
At this point Matt can dragrace any cars he wants .
Race that lambo against Kyles (1320videos) R8
4:19 DC on the radio sounds like Kimi
My money is on the modified Porsche 992 turbo.
Who else wants to see these against Ken Block in the Hoonicorn?!?!?!?!?
This lambo is just absolutely insane. Period.
That lambo
We need that red bull in monza spec.. then let's see
Lamo: ohh ya  F1:come on track 🤣
3:39 man looked scared
wow my love for lambo's just went to 10k rpm
ADD MPH TO THE 1/4
Results would've been different with DRS
So maybe motogp bike?😏
Killing it Mat Watson
This f1 sound is like sex with beer in hand while your favorite soccer team scores a goal.
That drag race was insane! 😶
F1 vs Rimac ??!!
Why aren't they using a newer F1 car like 2018 or 2019? it's cool that that's the championship winning one who put the newer carbohydrates have upwards of a thousand horsepower.
That Lambo is outrageous!!!!
thats the “old F1 car” lol but its kinda new
The 2nd gear pull was BRRRUUUTALLL
Even I know Yanni is not happy with Lambo with not original configuration, I am totally amazed that finally i see real specs in a tuned car! GREAT SETUP! This Lambo is like a bad joke to others 😈
Wowwww, crazy video, your are just great Mat!
Why is the gtr slow
carwow vids....just when i thought i was out, they pull me back in!!!
I just witnessed a Lamborghini won against a F1 car 😰😰
I am see your videos regularly and I don't no why in your all videos in which GTR  races my favourite are loses. Did you explain it 🤔.
Top
Yian will have to sell his Lambo and get this twin scroll turbo machine 🔥🔥
Ok next Nevera vs this huracan
That huracan is brutal.
What about that Huracan vs Rimac? I guess it would be so close and interesting as well.
I thought the GTR was slow. 9.3 in 1/4.  Insane drag!!!!! Lambo for the win baby!
That Huracan is no joke
Oyyy Mat you've got to put that lamborghini up against the Rimac. That would be one hell of a race!!!
I wanna see that F1 car against Plaid now
And the winner is... #Rimac 🤭
Here we have a Lambo that’s faster than a Formula 1 car. And Yanni’s not driving it. He must be absolutely gutted
As someone named Jørgen, I think you did a decent job pronouncing it correctly :-D
F1 cars are not what they just to be, back then during the "Senna era", formula 1 cars had between 900-1400 horsepowers and turbo. F1 cars was also hard to drive and the drivers had to struggle with their cars while driving, now that's called skills.
Best drag race yet... I have rug burn from watching this
Lambo feels like 1500hp 1700nm
We should see the Es motor 911 vs that lambo I believe it will be spectacular
The gtr should of been walking every this. This is fixed
Can we bring a modern f1 car lol?
The Lambo doesn't sound as good as it is stock
that lambo is sick.  It'll take a 2016 Mercedes F1 car to beat it probably.
They didn't bring a 911 turbo s to not embarrass the formula car.
Have to give the F1 car DRS 😄
Put that Lambo and the Chiron on the track.
Please do Rimac Nevera vs Lamborghini v 1200hp :D
Next Mercedes F1 Team
7:13 When she says her parents aren't home
You ok hun?😂😂😂😂😂😂what a car👌🏽👍🏽DC☝🏼👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽 MUCH SUPPORT FROM ROTTERDAM NETHERLANDS 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
I know F1 cars can brake hard but my god......
wher is 1600hp gtr
I'd love to see Yanni drive that Lambo! Imagine, he would be speechless!!!
Go around a corner.
Problem is f1 cars are capped thanks to the association. If they werent capped drivers would crash and die daily due to the power they would produce
Woww my jaw dropped after that first race, I thought the F1 would take it 😧
Matt....which is the fastest Team.....the lambo Matt.....ok put me in that one
On the rolling race that lambo picks up speed sooo quick jesus
I want to see a BRABUS in the drag
I can't imagine being the number plate of that Lambo
I always like the videos even if they are boring so plsss bring them
How about more "normal" cars? Like the Skoda Octavia RS for example? VW Passat R,...?
Genial!
This is scary
Is it ever not fucking raining during your drags?
Or else I will be mad
Llf gtr was running on low boost @ 1300hp, why not run the car at 1900hp? Assume 1300hp is street tune. The lambo lost to the gtr every race when Jurgen hosted race wars couple weeks ago. Gtr got 8.0 dead on quarter, insane car.
Matt don’t gets fired
Can you do The Lamborghini huracan in this video and The rimac Who knows it Can win
Get Ferrari F1 car and max or Charles and them in F1 car plssssd
Sounds like a mosquito race
I know i'm not going to be popular but the formula 1 sounds like a mosquito
Now thats a propa drag race enough boring bmw and audi and mercs thanks matt
Life of Palos were you at?
why not the mile
Bravooo Mat you are the best driver in the world😁
I can imagine Yanni really angry for not driving that lambo.
Lamborghini 🥰 top
F1 sound is the best....
These video shows how far cars have come in the past 20 years
That lambroghini and rimac race ple
Lambo dosen't stand chance against RB 7  with soft tires and DRS on. Also wasn't the RB 7 shinny/glossy blueish purple with the Renault engine?
F1 be like: Look what they need to mimic a fraction of our power.
everyone gangsta till f1 car gets beaten by lamborghini
petition for a tuned porsche Turbo S in a drag race  That would be a massacre
Lol the f1 car is so loud you can't hear the other cars
Lambo is so fast
TOO EASY
Damn that F1 V8 Sound 😍
Now imagine what a modern f1 car with soft tyres and low fuel would do….
Did you say that Lambo is for sale? Asking for a millionaire friend 🤣
That Lambo is absolutely nuts ! I think it can give tough competition to the new Rimac.
LAMBO, TDI power @ start 😄
Lamborghini all day everyday😉
But the f1 car isn't made for drag race if they raced at monza or spa that would be more interesting
1200hp audi r8 vs f1red bull must by good
That hurrican is nuts
Huracan 1,200hp vs buggati chiron
I can hear a lot of 12yo "JDM Fanbois" crying because their tuned "hero" lose to a tune Lambo.
💀💀💀🌹💣👊
That’s gotta be Yannys favorite drag race now
this shoes how great tuning is and how trash f1 is!
But what would have happened if the formula 1 car ran on the supersoft tyre instead of the hard tyre?
What a race gave me goosebumps.
Every GTR you bring to a race its so slow even if it has 2000 hp the driver doesnt know how to launch it pls be fair
Is that the Underground Racing Lamborghini?
This race reminds me of the ones I used to play with my Hotwheels when I was younger😂
Matt... judging by those numbers that lambo would sit with the nevera... Bring it home for INTERNAL COMBUSTION!! YOU KNOW WE NEED TO SEE IT
Bugatti: I have failed the race   Some Lamborghini with bumper off: fine I'll do it myself 👺
A huge W for the lambo boys
2 corners and F1 is already 10 secs faster
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
They should put a tuned gtr nismo then see the difference. The gtr done  exellent considering its raving a built lambo and a f1 car.
What a he'll but F1 is the fastest
Who else wants this tuned lambo vs a mk4 supra
Just to "restore" a little bit of F1 reputation in here. Facts: - this F1 car is 10 years old - current F1 cars have much more power - he is running probably the hardest compound tyre - car is most certainly raised as much as it could be from the ground (less grip) - track is wet, bumpy, cold (as are the tyres) - map on this F1 car is probably the "mellow" one in terms of engine power, as are the settings for the rain  Nevertheless, Lambo and Nissan are both works of art with these modifications.
F1 off DRS
The f1 car is racing with slicks on wet surface :(((
Big ciaoooo Fratello Mat🙋‍♂️
You know the drag race is absolutely bonkers, when the slowest completes the quater in 9.3 seconds
So much drag on the f1, would’ve loved to see DC get into the slipstream in the lambo and see the diff but that’s probably too expensive to risk..
My reaction when that huracan launch: WHAT THE FU*CKKKKK
No one is taking about the tt lambo , Bugatti vs tt lambo plz
this means that this Lambo is much faster than a Chiron...
Wow, you actually looked a bit scared there 😁
This is crazy
Petition for Murciélago vs F1 car rev battle!
Wow amazing
Imagine that there are some rich blokes that sit in front of online vehicle retailers and click "check out now" after adding  f1 vehicles like this one to their cart; skipping the "Donate $1 to your local End Hunger For Children Charity" without second thought.
That Lambo vs the Bugatti
V10 2 turbos 🔥🔥🔥
Lamborghini is the best company I hope in future this much power is street legal so we can drive such a powerful Lamborghini
Great race guys. I really wanted the F1 to win 😭
the f1 is a 1:1 ratio car, neat!! one horsepower for every kilo.
This modified Lamborghini Huracan vs the Rimac Nevera please please
That Lambo is absolutely NUTS- 8.9 seconds!!!
that f1 just sounds like a rc car 😂😂😂
Please we need rimac nevera vs that huracan
That lambo is on another level!
Perhaps the old f1 v10? I would like to see that
Still jumped the second start lol
Mat dint get fired
Fantastic race Matt. I wonder if you best mate Yanni would be able to find a better Lambo in his cars? You should give him that challange. The end result would be spectacular.
That Lambo is freaking fast
That green bullet is incredible
I had goose bumps man! Ahh what race!
If there were bends the F1 car would destroy the Lambo and gtr
it makes no sense to use F1 for drag race. Its been built for totally different purpose.
We want remac vs f1
First time seeing lambo winning agains this competition
8.9 1/4 mile on asphalt.... that lambo is absolutely insane, it would do lower 8s on a prepped surface
The next race I would put the BMW the thousand horses against the Lamborghini
On par with rimac nevera almost
Lambo on steroids
Dc was spinning its wheels for ages. Get a mercedes to do the race lol
it would be cool to see lamborghini 1200h vs audi r8 1200hp
The price of F1 cars, jaw dropping !
Why does the f1 car use the hard compound
Increíble carrera
first i tought it would be race between gtr and huracan but look at that huracan, its just crazy
Dont b silly the f1 car would melt them
F1
Lambo is also on semi slicks
Can we have that Lambo vs the plaid vs the rimac nevera?
Damn that lambo...🙌🙌
Looked like the Nissan was gonna do a wheelie on the 3rd attempt.
This video is gonna reach more then 8 million views
Matt you didn’t say the torque of the  rb7
Next video beat the F1 on mount panorama
Lambo vs Rimac 👀 What are we saying matt ?
Tommorow the Lambo vs rimac nevera
Dear lord that Lambo
In a straight line,an F1 Car against horsepower like this, it’s average at best, but, put these Cars on an F1 Track, a five lap race, even a one Lap head start, the Fi car would pass them both, in four laps!😎, well, what do you think Mat?
Not a f1 car its so slow a f1 car is going 350 de driver is not good race max verstappen
That's why we love Lambo.🔥🔥🔥🔥
So the Lamborghini goes second behind the Rimac on the chart.
This is what i mean when people say "supras would easily beat lambos" ofc tuned supra would beat stock lambo, but when the lambo is tuned too the supra is gonna lose.
Specific power; Lamborghini 1 hp for 1.3 kg . Nissan 1 hp for 1.38 kg .  Red Bull  1 hp for 1 kg . I know the Lambo has higher torque (and 4 wd) but the Red Bull has a 30 % higher specific power.  Something is off here.
Mat after 10 years: ...and there is Max Verstapen in RB16B
Best drag race ever
F1 car vs model S plaid?
Mantap siot..
Wow, wow, wow, I’m absolutely gobsmacked by the speed of the Lambo, even at £220k it’s well worth it
So casual about David Coulthard being there… 😳🤷🏻‍♀️
OK i am honestly disappointed with the F1. lol
the huracan grip so good on 1/4 qmile that the front goes up. such an amazing AWD masterpiece
Makes the standard current 991 turbo s seem all the more impressive....
Lambo wins , where's  yanny man Lambo all day everyday
In defense of the f1 car:  No setup for a drag race (it was on hard tyres -.- - nobody in f1 ever started with hards) No DRS (2011 was the season DRS was introduced) Most lightly no (K)ERS use (the 2011 car had a little bit of it) 10 years old (they are about 40km/h faster these days at top speeds)  At track it would lead after the first to curves, even at highspeed-tracks like Monza.
I feel like the Lambo would do a 3.5 minutes laptime on Barcelona. Zero grip on the corners.
This is one of the best uploads so far loved it boys
that lambo's absolutely insanely rapid
Man modded lambos are insane!  Insane numbers as well!  Great vid!
I love when david said, if the team are happy, im happy. Thats teamwork in formula 1 is brought everywhere
Woww excellent race matt
It would be awesome to see 0-200-0 mph race with this cars
Matt we need Model S Plaid vs Nevera Please, you and Brooks fron Drag times are the kings of Drag Racing on YouTube, the only ones that can bring us such an epic race.
Careful or Red Bull will ask for a stewards enquiry 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Get a civic with a laptop in a race
Yeah matt..that's what I heard from the F1 driver too.
All we need now is rickys 1900 BHP GTR
That lambo is so insane❤️🥰
Now.. Race them in Reverse.
That Lambo just fks off
I wish the F1 car could do a drag race with the hoonicorn
Superb 👏👏
The Lambo is MENTAL 😍
Okay this Lambo is so good though. The tuner did a good job on this one
This lambo is incredibleeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i want that car
Would like to see a koenigsegg on the channel
RIVERA VS F1
That Lamborghini 😲, 8.9... amazing.
Should've done a half mile drag race
I’m sceptical that F1 car was running full power. Power to weight ratio should be over 1100 bhp per ton which would easily despatch lambo with only around 790 per ton in the rolling race
Mat you're jumping the gun
That Lamborghini has more than 1800 bhp not 1200. It has the same power as rickys gtr from lff if I’m not mistaken as they were racing them on the dragstrip last week.plus for over £70,000 in upgrades I’d want more than 1200 bhp
That lambo agains navera
That lambo is crazy
can't mess with a lambo without rear bumper
Wow that Lambo is fast!
Lets go F(ev)
That Lambo has daddy issues
Should get the LLF gtr on here
Wait Matt is from brum? 3:24
Nevera would kick that lambos ass
Nivera vs that Demon Lambo
Lambo + Exposed pipes = yeah!
Matt playing Forza in real life Next time remove the aero from the 🏎️to let it go beyond 200mph
This is so fun to watch my goodness! You guys are killing it with this content seriously! The lambo has 4 more cylinders, better all wheel drive there was no way it would lose here even though im a gtr fan. The sound of the formula 1 car is the best sound in the fucking world i swear! How is it possible for a V8 to sound like that?? Only a 2.4 L? 750hp? Unbelievable man fuark!
No one:  Literally nobody:  David: if the team is happy, I'm happy
Goosebumps just goosebumps🤌🏼
Missing a Tesla plaid
Aahhhh... Mannnnn the lambo waaass innnssssaaaaane😎😎😎😎😎
Nobody: David: if team are happy, i’m happy
If they managed to bring a Tesla plaid it would be the ultimate drag race!
Bwoah... I know what I'm doing
all sub 10 seconds, fastest line up you've ever brought
Мan the lambo just fucks off
I wish I could see a track lap with those cars
That Lamborghini just killed  both!  Awesome. But I still hope one day we can see the F1 car  against the Bugatti Bolide and Koenigseegg One:1
Get a supra
Great racing 💪💪
Holy shit that Lamborghini
63 million race car?
The combined sound was insane!
The bugatti should have been in this drag race.
Put this lambo vs. Nevera 😉
F1 cars have way to much down force it effects their straight like speed.
It gets crazier everytime and i love it!
He deffo jumped that start
youre telling me Yianni couldn't drag race a 1200 hp Lambo he gonna be mad
why is it always raining? just the one time to not have a slick surface with 2 four wheel drives and a rear wheel drive. To top it off the F1 was on slicks in the rain?? really????
Can we have a mk 4 supra next
Rimac Nevera vs that Lambo would be a treat to watch !!!
So if Buggatis were tuned🤔
This old fashioned F1 sound though 😍😍
This lambo should run with rimac
Rimac .... rimac ... rimac ....rimac ....
This was epic
You could buy 260 of those lambos WITH THE EXTRAS for the price of ONE of those F1 cars
Kid's don't know a stock supra won't win against a lambo or gtr  (Some kid's writing comments like supra is faster and quicker than buggati)
Now this Lambo vs the Rimac Nevera please
Did anyone notice the F1 car is on hards
I'm not going to watch F1 anymore. I think i'm  just going to go and sit outside my local Pub and watch the road cars. "They're faster!"  (And not buying the F1 ticket pays for the beer lol)
Holy smokes that lambo is quick. No way it has 1200 and is that close to the nevera. That's just ridiculous 😂
Rimac vs Chiron vs f1
Do a drag race against hoonicorn
They have to bring the 919 Evo to the Drag race ;)
I was hoping David would have a go in the Lambo
Imagine an Indy car in this race 🤨😮.
WTF TT HURACAN IS ROCKET 🚀
U should do Ram 1500 vs Ford Raptor vs Silverado vs GMC Sierra vs Hilux vs amarok vs Nissan Titan vs suzuki d max   Btw all should be 2021 models   drag race rolling race and brake test maybe off road test also   This is the ultimate pick up race   Or   Caddilac Escalade vs chevy thaoe vs GMC Yukon vs land cruiser vs Nissan patrol   2021 models  Pls do one or both of these
Remac vs lambo
lambos with bumber deletes scare me
THIS IS HOW EVERY LAMBO MUST BE THE WE KNOW THE REALITY ...😞😞😞  STOCK  GTR VS STOCK LAMBORGHINI THE GTR WINS THE GAME😞😞
G-TR one life, one love...
Look at Mat’s face when lambo lunches hilarious 🤣
That first run, you looked genuinely terrified, lol
my guess is f1, lambo , nissan
PLEASE drag race the Porsche Cayenne turbo GT Vs Urus Vs X6 M competition
By the end of the day Matt will have 6 million subscribers!
Tuned cars are shite craic. Stop having them
David being second that’s the natural order
You need to race this lamborghini with a bugatti. Because the F1 defeated the bugatti. It would be pretty bloomin crazy
Whaat happened to my GTR🤔
Top top top...👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾
This is for great a drag race. I'm watching for hundred time.
Horrrrryyyy sheeet this is awesomeeeeee
Insane. I was not expecting that. Thought the F1 would win easily.
Funny that those who numbers are only a fraction of what USA tuners have been able to extract from both platforms
Lamborghini : ) All day  Everyday 💓.
Doesn’t the RB7 have DRS? Being a drag race, I wonder why they didn’t deploy it.
The F1 Sound is just so menacing!!!
Yianni must be very happy today 😂.
Imagine having this guys job he’s getting paid to drive the best cars in the world 😮
Is that rickey's car? He said the car will pop up here?  Buzz fell 😴 on jmracewars...
the fact that the F1 just stopped in like 0seconds is insane, compared to the other two
The first time ever that M looked truly alarmed!
hello  can u pls do f1 vs f1 car?
My prediction is the one with the lowest horsepower doesn't break down
This is gonna get VIEWS
I’d like red bull to give the current honda powered turbo hybrid car and race that one.  Bring max too if hes all healed!
Holy shit that lambo is quick. Even though this was a drag race, I don't think it did justice to the F1 car. Throw in some corners and you'll see that F1 do them at 160+kmh, something which the lambo and the gtr can't without seriously risking rolling
*Yanni do it like BuzzySingh does....learn Lambo boy learn* 😘😛
Jurgen was ready to take off in the GTR
Lambo is nice, but F1 sounds just so beautiful
You managed to procure an F1 car for a drag race? So glad I subscribed months ago
Once you've seen twin turbo labos like the crazy Underground Racing labos with 3000!!! horsepower there is nowhere left to go :(
F for honda leaving F1
I'm gonna cry brooooo🥲 I'm a fan of JDM I'm a lambo guy too And look at that F1... Dude That's bloody cool my lord 🥺
Who would tell that Matt has chosen the fastest car..
Nice race. It would also be nice if they could have one shot of the race that was one continuous shot and wasn’t composed of 18 separate 1.5 second cuts.
Mat definitely jumped the start on the 2nd race
That's nuts
I'm so glad I went to the British GP (2011) before the turbo-hybrid era of F1. 20 of those cars going around were amazing 😍
You are the best Matt watson.....
As speed is all relative that didn't look that fast a quarter mile....until the time comes up 😂
It’s crazy that the Lambo caught 220 and Stradman in his Veyron couldn’t get 200 wow GET THE LAMBO
Bout time the lambo's got some love 🤣
3:36.   Look at the Lambo  ?!!   Here he himself is surprised ! PS:  Ferrari is likely to go knock on Lamborghini's house for the next Formula 1 Grand Prix.
6:03 😂 chipmunks 🐿
would like to see the f1 car with drs
wow
Don’t be shy put some soft tires on it
Livinglifefasts GTR against the Rimac I need to see
Moru tuned lambo please
Lambo+turbo=beast
Llf Ricky’s 2000bhp gtr needs a feature 👀
I just want to see mat drive an f1 car
The Rimac would have been perfect in this race.
That Lamborghini Vs Rimac Nevera would be interesting 😍
3 insane fast cars. But that F1 sounds so good🥰
Can’t wait to see LLF GTR on here 😨
2:43 Oh My..... This sound
I love the videos, but the rain needs to go. I don’t see how that helps the F1 car or any car
Hey mat, why don't you race the f1 with the rimac and and the electric ferrari that you raced with the rimac
That gtr does not have 1300hp otherwise it would of cleaned the floor with the other two
Would love to see DMOS e63
Did I jump the start ? Lol.....as usual
I bet that Lambo would melt its bumper off if it was fitted. In fact that probably why there isnt one as it now is a green molten puddle somewhere on a random street.
NEVER NEVER thought the F1 car would get beat !!!!!! shocked very I know David does not like loosing and he was trying as well !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Please do rimac nevera vs ssc tuatara vs F1 car
David Coultard the single most boring man ever to grace motor sport
Love David Coulthard. It's great you have him on the show. It must've been such an honor for you guys.
Would like to see a koenigsegg vs that lambo
"The best car buying comparison site"  As if these cars are buyable 😅
Get a motogp motorcycle that would be nuts
Showing Lambo-guy's instagram account was a bit of spoiler
At the end the radios were like in the need for speed game
Finally a worth opponent for the Nevera 😁
LLF GTR vs BUZZ LAMBO vs RIMAC
The tuned lambo vs a rimac nevera🤝
😲😲😲
May I have a carwow discount on the F1 car please matt... how much can you save me? 😁🤭
Now get rikki llf to smash that Lambourn to bits 🤣
That lambo is awesome 😎
Oh My Gosh that Lambo😱😱🔥🔥🔥 Really curious to see Chiron vs that Lambo...
Lovely to see a Real Car beating a glorified Go Kart. Go on Lambo
Did he GT-R owner sell the plates to the Lambo after this race?!
I wonder what's next???
We need Rimac Nevera vs That Lambo
Would love to see twin turbo huracan against a Kawasaki H2
With that much power and awd the huracan is so fast. The f1 has a lot of drag at high speed and drag to hp ratio is probably much higher than for the huracan. But while on a straight line the lambo is faster, through corners it’s much slower even compared to  a gt race car which in turn is way slower than an f1.
Did F1 car had tyre blankets before the launches or did it launch with glassy rubber?
Rimac Vs that Lamborghini 🔥
oh Mat, you always know how to make me drop everything and click… a national treasure you are!
let's put it this way, when you combine the craziness and passion of an italian with the cleverness and practicality of a german you get something very similar to the craziness, passion, cleverness and practicality of a japanese man, but two heads always think better than one, the GTR is ancient, VW group just has so much more money and japan is not quite what it used to be on the 90s
Fun fact red bulls fastest pit stop was also a record at 2.9 sec and the f1 1/4 mile was 9.2 😂
all that millions and being beaten by a Lambo ahhh shit
Carwow is the GOAT
BMW m4 cs vs amg c63s coupe
The gtr35 it's look normal standart sportcar without aggresive kit but has 1300hp,can i call a "slepeer car"?
The guy built a car faster than a proper F1 car. Wow. Just wow
Tenéis que usar un F1 de ahora, esos tienen 6 marchas, uno de ahora tiene 8
Now add a corner
What makes these videos exciting is the way the F1 car screams!!  It just gives me goosebumps!
Want to see the race between this lambo and rimac nevera
This Lambo vs the Rimac Nevera please
How about Drag race between F1 and Rimac Nevera?
Truth is No body came here for Lambo or GTR
Multi Matt 1, David
Really need to do a shootout with some Ssangyongs.  I mean, how hard can it be...?
In this life, have money.
Toyota Supra A80 2500HP vs f1 vs Lamborghini
Mat you should put up subtitles for all walkie talkie conversations coz we cant understand what the other person is saying normally too
Lambo power 😁😁😁😁 thats why i love lambo ❤❤❤💋💋😘💋
When Matt launched the Lambo, I couldn't stop laughing in the office.. and everyone was like what the hell man its month ending 😝
that lambo is insane!!
Matt's soul left his body for few seconds when he launched the lambo
Rimac Nivera vs Lambo 1200 hp coming soon
Now lets bring in the Nevera and see how the lambo gets smoked
Ricky's 1900bhp Nissan gtr.
We want a single review of that green "monsta" ☠ Mat
this lambo vs the rimac plss
Hi. This huracan vs Rimac.
This drag races are best, absolutely awesome. Thank you guys!
We need Bugatti Chiron Vs this Lambo, please
Still slower than the turbo S
now race that lambo against a chiron and Rimac Nevera!!!
Yeeeees twin turbo lambo 🤘🤘
Matt: hi, how r u? Me: Don't u ask man🤑
Жду видос на русском 😄
We want to see a drag race between that Lamborghini and Rimac Nevera. Thanks.
The best drag race so far on this channel. The F1 car got beaten by a road car!
imagine coming last in a drag race after finishing the quarter mile in 9.3 seconds
Matts had his teeth whitened 😂
I fans david coulthard 😇
Matt jumped the start
You are always in the tastes car Mat
That lambo in the drag just took off into another time zone…
F1 is amazing
Nevera vs UGR TT Huracan vs F1
This lambo against rimac
They shouldve tested the v10 f1 cars
Best race ever…. But Mat face and reaction 😂😂
Doesn't matter what you drive, do *NOT* challenge a Lamborghini with no rear bumper.
Whats with that NIssan? 1300HP and last.....
Surprised how the rolling race showed both tunned road cars walking away from the F1 😲
Rimac Nevera vs Lambo
do kawasaki h2 vs f1
Sheer humiliation of the Red Bull!
next time hamilton car please
Hope Rimag navera VS this Lambo  Race coming soon
Your lambo has got bits fallen off of it !!!!! at the back
This Lambo vs Rimac. Do it plz.
5:52 you can what??
3:17 that mosquito when i sleep...
220mph??? bruh
You know you already lost when a lambo doesn't have a rear bumper
Don't get me wrong the speed of that Lamborghini is insane, but I couldn't just buy a Lamborghini and rip the whole rear of the car off for a performance boost even if it is 1,200hp, it just ruines the look of the car.  Also I'm not a fan of the sound with the twin turbo's it just doesn't sound as good as naturally aspirated.
Lambo just start before the 2 others..
Just imagine Yannie in that Lambo teasing Matt, all day everyday 😆 Amazing content guys, always a treat to watch. Hoping for more to come
How much horsepower? 3 of them all: YES
Wagen lovers🤩
Where is Yianni?
LLF Nissan GTR Ricky   She can do it with Lampo
imagen Bugatti pure sport tuned ever one dead XD
Crazy thing is that a 4,800 lb Tesla Model S Plaid sedan would come pretty close to keeping up with that Lambo. It can do the 1/4 mile in 9.1 seconds. Electric ⚡️cars are definitely the future of drag racing. Internal combustion just won’t be able to compete with them in the future.
so a stock plaid is the same as an f1 car and would beat a 1300 gtr, go a way to go to get that lambo tho
Perfect
Why you always put some sleeper guys in a gtr.....this thing is way faster.... Ways.... I promise you...
Damn that Lamborghini is one Fast car!!
Hi guys check out our channel for car content and other fun stuff! 😀I  https://youtube.com/channel/UCNmNiSYSJK0OefSu18laeVg
It makes me SAD that Mat is not SAT in his cars anymore..:(
Best drag race ever!
Mat's reaction was fucking legendary 🤣🤣🤣
The WoW in Carwow, brilliant
The carwow Drag Race is wonderful every time. There are beautiful supercars. Special cars such as the rare f1 car can be used with the supercar Drag Race.
Can you launch carwow game for PlayStation's and smart phone 😇
He’s auditioning contestants for the plaid  runs
F1 car sounds the best, so good
Thanks to this questionable editing, the F1 has a 25 speed gearbox...
everything I thought was going to happen, the opposite happened, I don't remember ever being so wrong :)
6 mn followers and could not have good equipment so they could talk to eachother to start at the same time…? Had been fun to see the Gtr start at the same time as the Lambo in rolling races
Legend says... never race lambo with no rear bumper.
You should've mentioned the 0-60 in the Lambo Matt
2011 F1 car, just sayin'!
In the 90's a fast car would do 0 - 60 in around 5 seconds.  20 years later they are going 0 - 120 in the same time.  That lambo gaps an F1 car.  Ridiculous.
That was impressive!!
Stick that f1 car round a track and it’ll shatter everything
get the 2020 f1 car, let it use DRS, lrt it use KERS
The way the lambo trashed the F1 car was crazy. The car was now sounding like a bug😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Where is the Porsche
Magnifique👍 excellent👍👏😆
That Lamborghini is insane🤪🤪
Where's the Porsche 911 turbo s
Best video I’ve seen on the channel .. 👍🏼
Easily one of the best races in a while. Having Yianni in it would have amped way it up.
What kind of Formula 1 is that... RUBBISH
Let’s see a Nobel m600
Now add a corner into the drag and see who wins :)
Do Ford Mustang hoonicoon 1400 hp
Has carwow ever seen a sunny day? Always wet when Mat Watson is in town...
This is probably the most intense car wow drag race video I've ever watched
Would like to see DMO’s E63s vs Evolves M5 on car wow..
F1 vs RIMAC
Funny how dmo says his is the only twin turbo in the uk 🥱🙄
The video-editing team is also getting better and better :)
its simple, i see a Lamborghini Huracan with no rear bumper, i know the winner
So Mat didn’t lose his job?🤣
This is crazy
That was insat..!
Dc!!!
F1 will win this race even before I watch the video
7:15Matt hit full acceleration in a tt huracan with no hands lmfao WHAT A FREAKING LEGEND!!!
That Lambo's engine sound made me cry in happiness,it was just melody for my ears
Pls Pls put this Lambo with Yanni in it against Remac with you in it... That would be absolute Smash!
We want to see Jurgens Jun R1 GTR in a Carwow drag race, over 2000bhp
Ламбо надо с широном поставить
How the hell is there no turbolag from the huracan?
we need that lambo vs the nevera
That lambo is nuts 👏👏👏👏
The lambo is intense
With slixs in rain is a no goo for the f1 car . Whats the point here ???
I guess that gtr is not tuned , otherwise it would have sounded 🔥
You need to compare the f1 car against cars of it's year
Check tires pressure in the Lambo.
The fastest drag race yet👍
Nice video! 😇 can you drag those 3 cars against ninja h2r?
Absolutely insane Lambo.  😍
A twin turbo lambo did what a quad turbo chiron couldn't
Next should be civic with laptop
F1 vs Tesla plaid! What else matters?
This race is biased. The GTR should have won. They deliberately made it lose
how much did the GTR cost?
Hats off to the the car owners and redbull for setting this up.
Are we going to see you driving that f1 beauty someday?
and the tesla model s  plaid ...?
The Lamborghini looks like one of those cars you buy and have problems every 2 weeks because something breaks
try to racing those cars with Mercedes w12 f1 car
Was F1  stock ?
Need to see a battle between the Rimac that Lambo and the F1!
3:30 for race
Mods are shit and so matt
F1 on slicks and in the wet? Pointless
It would be fun to see all the cars from the video on a racing circuit
U should get some real drag cars in these videos
Mate Rimac is on the phone trying to get that F1 car for his next promo video
@DMO twin turbo your hurricane.!! 😅
I need to see F1 Car and Tesla plaid race now!! Or with all of them, its crazy fast it's scary
I've watched 100's and 100's of amazing car wow videos. May yourself and your team do an amazing job. I. Think has to be my favourite drag race.
How many seconds on a track would the F1 car win by? How many laps would the other cars last before blowing up ? 😂
250 milion is not only for 4 cars......
Imagine if carwow got arguably the fastest f1 ever the 2020 mercedes w11
Jurgen where's ya nova
“GP2 engine”  Fernando Alonso
100% real, no fake, 1 link mega
Watching this is more entertaining than watching weekend GP nowadays
We need a turbo hybrid F1 car vs that Lambo
That lambo is so quick wow
More vids whit the lambo.
I love seeing David Coulthard on carwow, more of him!!!! 😄
3:34 I want to get trashed too 🔥🔥
@carwow can we viewers get a drag race between this Lambo vs the Rimac? Looks like the Rimac's finally got its level of competition with this Lambo in the scene. #Carwow #matwatsoncars
I know 'HONDA' is on the RB car and DC's helmet and suit, but is the V8 engine a Renault?
A little bit more power for the lambo and it will beat the rimac nevera 🤯 imagine a porsche 9ff
Ah yes 2nd drag race with f1 car
3:12 OMG another living legend 😍🏎🔥
No way as if the lambo left the F1car !!!!!!!!
Epic vid!!!! All amazing cars!!!
Lambos eating up F1 cars for breakfast, lunch and dinner!! car scene is over!!
THAT F1 IS LOUDDDD😍😍😍
You should of had rickys @LivingLifeFast GTR on there , 1/4 mile 8.042 !!!! Would have slaughtered even the Lambo, serious weapon
Amazing lambo loved the exhaust sound. Would beat most cars on 1/4 mile.
Hands down the best car content I have ever seen in YouTube. Carwow offer me a job I am so damn bored in here lmao
amazing race waow🇵🇰
Best carwow racing ever ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Race a stock tesla model s plaid against these!
What a crazy Lamborghini!
Best one yet
Wow
6:56 cubano snik?
The wrath of Lambo🔥. All cars are just mental.
Omg proof that the red bull car was bad an vettel had to out drive it to win the championship, what a legend vettel is
This is the best episode ever
Nothing beats the classic "Lambo without a rear bumper".
Brooooo We needed way more exhaust clips from the F1 car cmon man
To all you GTR fanboys this further proves the efficiency of the V10 platform
That Lambo though!!!😳😳😳
Feeling bad of nissan gtr 🙄
1:38 don’t you have to announce they are from Honda too? 👀
Great Lambo, green 😁Hi Matt, yeah perfect lunch 😁
Did you record this in november?
For me this is like the next gen top gear,  i love the format, not to long,  never boring,  straight to the point high quality content
That's Lambo kills 🔥🔥🔥.
Matt’s Lambo is the fastest but imo he jumped the start a bit the first 2 times
Hey Matt why dont you give start role to another walkie talkie user and you focus on driving? I'm having heart attack every time you countdown
👍
The best race💪
Well I now want a Lamborghini with turbos bolted on it !
Ok, now we want to see that lambo against the red bull and a model s plaid
one of carwow greatest videos only the noise in shadows was too much good job!
2000hp rimac 8.7 1200hp lambo 8.9 ;) i guess ice are still hard to beat ;)
Even though the F1 car was short shifting through the drag race and going a bit steady on launch that lambo is an absolute beast!!  Please have more of it on the channel!!
I hate tuned cars
What's the torque figure on that F1 car?
When you see a lamborghini with no rear bumper & a twin turbo… just know it’s game over
How about a Plaid Model S vs the RB vs a Nevera?
F1 2021 car is next
At this rate carwow is gonna get the F1 car as a long termer
Rimac Nevera vs Tuned Lambo
Wonder how much maintenance is required on those cars? How often you need to change those air filter next to the rear tyre on the lambo?
The hurricane with no rear bumper
Matt, can we get a 2160 HP Nissan GT-R vs the Koenigsegg Agera R?
Imagine they could get a Porsche 919 Evo
Isn’t David Coulthard officially the coolest Formula 1 driver ever?   He’s always game 4 a race on YouTube, I’ve never seen any other F1 driver retired or otherwise, actively doing this!✌️
Who built that Gtr TF!!
That Lambo is nonsense. Doesn't matter what BHP it has when half the body panels are off 🤮
It’s scary as hell that you need a racing license to drive the F1 car, but anybody with a normal driving license and a big enough bank balance can drive a car that is as fast/faster in a straight line, but can’t break as well and can’t handle as well……. 🤯🤯🤯
Pretty insane lambo!
Transceivers are the most advanced thing here, but they are made by slaves in China. Similarly, the F1 steering wheel costs enormous money, but it is made on the spot in the country, so they are expensive, no slaves. Bosch used to want to do, design his motor controllers locally in the country but they were more expensive than the whole car so he has been using slaves in China, Taiwan since the 1970s. It is a pity that F1 has lost, I am disappointed.
Need to get a hybrid F1 car up against these monsters.
what about lambo in this video vs rimac ?
Please race modified pre 2010 small engined hatchbacks like a k11 and a Lupo!
JM imports repping the north of England 🤝👏👏👏👏
backstories: That Huracan is owned by Buzz Singh. A couple of weeks ago, his Nissan GTR caught on fire and it was a total loss.
Sheesh 8.9 sec 1/4 mile
Lamborghini is straight from hell! bloody hell!
We are gonna get fighter jets soon. Car wow has no limits.
That Lambo any day over a Rimac.
Imagine tuning a Porsche 911
F1 car vs Kawasaki Ninja H2R motorcycle could be interesting, very powerful bike...
We all knew who was winning the break test😂😂.
I have an exam in 25 minutes  And I am still watching this video   Coz...... ...... ...... ..... FREAKING F1 CAR
The F1 sounds like a fly💀
lambo is insane
"g0DziLla" HAHAHAHHAA

How could you use a hard tyre compound in the wet?
New F1 CAR should race against this lambo

Drag race Lamborghini and Bugatti
So the new king of the drag race is the Lamborghini ❤️❤️❤️..
I would love to see RB16 vs this Lambo
Add some corners and the F1 car would say bye bye.
The F1 Cars the sound on shifting like symphony on my ears
I think it’s the first time that Matt reach 350km In the show 🔥
I don't think anything can beat that Lambo in a drag race
The classic Lambo, without the bumper shitttt
This was amazing
F1 car sounds like a mosquito
That Lambo is nuts...
Get the V6 Hybrid F1 cars on and re-run the race😂
GTR was running only on 6 cylinders.
Didn’t see it, but it’s gonna be interesting  Edit: HOLY SHI-  Edit 2: I thought that Formel 1 would be winning, but that Lamborghini is just nuts
rimac nevera vs f1  vs lambo pls
that f1 car on optimal conditions can do 8.0 seconds quarter
Lamborghini vs rimac
65m for f1 lol i thought 3m will be enough
Seeing the numbers on the speedo of the lambo go up is just insanity 😂😂
Rimac vs tuned lambo
I saw on Ricky's LLF channel that his 1,900HP GTR was being filmed for a CarWow video recently - like a few days ago. Looking forward to whatever race that rocket is involved in.
Glorious sound of an old F1 car
F1's are not meant to only go in a straight line
Get the Jun car on :)
what the actual fuck is that lambo
You almost reaching 6 million subscribers what are you going to do now
I want to see the ultimate of all ultimates. Porsche 919 tribute vs something equivalent, please make it happen.
I make sure that Yianni wants this Lambo.
F1 vs Tesla Model S Plaid
AHA...sooo...for 170.000 pounds you get something that you can pay 2.000.000 euros buying Nevera...
Let’s call it: this Lambo is officially going to be a Plaid Killer. @carwow set it up pls 🙏🏻
TT Lambo + Nevera + Tesla Plaid
I want to see that Lambo vs Ricky's 1900hp GTR and the F1, now that should be interesting.  The GTR was very impressive still.
Love the modified cars on the channel
The GTR driver can’t drive..
MORE. OF. F1.
Tesla 4 door saloon plaid is just as Quick as that F1 car.  That is insane.
Did he just said fucking 62.5 million dollarsssssssss!!~!!
The F1 is on hards.  It would gain a good few 10ths on Softs Or am I wrong?
Please do a rematch, but swop out the GTR for the Rimac Nevera
I would shit my pants if i saw that lambo from my rear view mirror
GTR fan Bois : Ouch
That GT-R has such a nice wheels. Fits the car perfectly imo
He is so close, I can hear him in the distance :-D
gtr driver sleepy :D
Pls try with F1 car V10 engine 😍😍
Straight line racing tutorial. If you see a Lambo without rearbumper you lose automatically
Finally a non electric race
Poor GTR NISMO 😢😢🥲
That lambo 🤯
Matt pleaseeee get the Tesla plaid on your channel!
Where are the GTR and Supra fan boys?
Matt has jedi reaction!)
I'd like to see Ricky's GTR race the Rimac
1200hp on a stock engine and trans? Who the fuck tunes these cars? Hillbillies?
Me="Well if Tesla couldn't win , nothing can' Lamborghini = "Hold my bear !!"
I want to see that Lamborghini VS Mercedes w10
DO A RIMAC VS THIS 1200HP LAMBO DRAG RACE
That lambo is on steroids. I really like yani lambo vs buzzy lambo. I want to see yani's reaction being beaten by a real lambo HAHAHAHA
The F1's probably the most reliable car in that lineup /s
Wow look all 3 cars hauled ass and they are all on AUTO !
We need formula e vs formula 1 in a drag race
Did he DRS 😂
Just waiting for Karen Horner to complain about Hamilton putting a wheel up the inside on the rolling start
Lamborghini : Here, there, GONE.
The most crazy drag race on this channel 👍👍
The Rimac vs that Lamborghini n the F1
Dear God the arse on that Lambo is a thing of beauty
Man i miss those porsche 911 days when 1/4 miles was like 10.1 seconds or so and now it’s like 8.7 8.8 seconds... we’re old now😂
Huracan is the new gtr the good ol godzilla is just too fat and with a small engine takes too long to spool the big turbo's.
Lamborghini 1200hp vs bugatti Chiron ?
Get that f1 turned up to the ~1000hp they produce.  Today’s f1 do 0-300kph in ~9 seconds.. 0-100kph 2.5 sec 100-200kph 2 sec 200-300kph 4 sec.
Wait matt didn’t lose his job?
come on Matt jump in the F1, just for funzies
I was so excited seeing thumbnail that I didn’t see the title and when I heard that lambo was tuned I was 😵‍💫😎
Why would you do that to a Lamborghini 🙆🏾‍♂️
Carwow went from racing golfs to freaking f1 cars. Mad respect.
you definetly jumped the start
That GT-R is darn lagging. Needs antilag tech and stuff or quicker spooling turbos
Can you also publish the terminal speeds for the quarter miles times pls. Thanks
3:27
Now how about an actual race on a grand prix track :)
Nearly 6,000,000 subscribers, this channel has come a hell of a long way..... Instagram seems the platform these days!!! 👌
Mat: I Can Hear the Formula One Car!! 5:53  Formula one car: I'm not Coming. You're just fast. (And F1 Car Gives Up).
Everyone gangsta until lambo without rear bumper comes in
What u feed yo Lambo? Red Bull or somethinn?
I smell a viral video
Pls do a twin turbo lamborghini aventador drag race against other modded cars 🤪
so this is what a commercial minded lamborgini with turbos can do ..yesssssssssssss
Yannie is proud
Was F1 car running with KERS ?
The sound of a twin turbo lambo is something else
put sped on 0.25  and look the start
Wow that lambo 🤯
I have a wish for a race: model 3 performance vs model s plaid vs taycan turbo s (and of course the nevera if you could get your hands on it again!).  Great vid as always!
Bro what that lambo did to a fucking formula one car was nuts
Man that lambo just raped that f1 car I guess 62.5mil wasted
Tesla s Plaid. R8 TT 1500up. GTR 1500hp
I want that Lambo against the Rimac Nevera
Escalating nicely. Surely we have to get this intro one day: "I'm sitting in a Soyuz rocket, and next to me is a Falcon Heavy...and we're going to have a drag race!"
Fastest quarter mile on carwow ever..
2:42 😩😩😩😩😩
Oh my God!! Team F#*king Lamborghini! That rolling race caught me by surprise
That Lamborghini is insane
WE NEED 9FF PORSCHES !
Is this Lamborghini the fastest un car wow ?
Just casually mentioning Coulthard is my fav part.
220 mph that's a lot of speed
A rear deleted lambo will beat any shitbox of a jdm car 🤣
Nevera vs This Lambo
You are not going to find many clips where a championship F1 car is made to look second tier. Kudos to Buzz Singh and that Lambo.
Like to See an newer F1 car… could be closer! 🧐
Mat got friends in  high places. Next Hamilton and Block vs rimac
This is so crazy!
I bet that race would have looked better back in the day on landor St lol
8.9 👀 that’s crazy
Never mess with a lamboghini with no rear bumper🤣🤣🤣
When a huracan got double turbo, it's just INSANE!
Do the lambs vs a stretch bike
Great vids Mat! Something NEW would be racing a Harley Davidson against a similar car. That would be pretty unique :)
Excellent Content!!!!
CRAZY LAMBO
Who'd have ever thought 9.3 seconds in a quarter mile would feel slow?
I could feel the speed of that Hurican in my chest when it took of
Matt..... you are jumping.      A LOT!!👀
F1 sounds like a drill.
Best drag race ever!! That lambo is insane!!
Fun concept. Annoying host
Now add a corner
Yeah RB just casually racing their car with other people. Imagine other F1 teams doing this... Imposible
Dominic Toretto: I need a 10sec car!!! Matt: 🙄
The ending with the walkies killed me 😂
One of the best races😍😍
Tesla fanboiis after seeing this: I bet the plaid can beat that Lambo.
BIG UP THE JM BOYS
Oh please please do this on a circuit. The F1 car will be drinking your collective tears.
£62.5M! Damnnnnn. Can't believe how fast that Lambo was!!
I SAT IN> IM SITTING IN
That souped-up Lambo blew me away of thinking F1 cars could not be beaten. Someone here made a good suggestion to try drag race this Lambo and Rimac and see what happens..
I just noticed that this is first time carwow has the Original Huracan featured 🤔
DC is such a humble guy!  Pure gold.
next time with soft tires for the f1 car and let him use drs
why are you jump starting every time, its annoying
update the drag race leaderboard ty
Show love for the Red Bull team, they're always down for some fun.
Can you guys tell us 0-62 MPH in these drag races?
The fact that he said skyline makes me proud.
Crazy cars matt. Especially that F1 . Just mind blowing
The drag is nuts!!! Keep racing Matt!!! Now I know that rear bumper rules
Content just gets better and better
Iam waiting for rimac vs f1
Bring any v10 f1 car
When DC called it “The Skyline“ 😍❤
I love your content Matt but this is seriously pointless! Highly tuned cars that no one can buy vs an F1 car. How about taking some of the best production cars money can buy and do some lap times? And then compare them to the F1 car for shits & giggles !
Review lambos
Why formula cars are so expensive ?
That was a cracking race, who else thought the F1 car had it in the bag?  no just me? alrighty then!😂
Review lambos
Lambo destroyed that f1 and gtr! epic!
Review lambos
We wanna see this lambo racing a rimac nevera
How about that red bull engine in a gr yaris
CarWow just keeps delivering that contet. Much respect!
Buzzysingh take a bow. Twin Turbos for the win
Review lambos
Just because its faster in a straight line doesnt mean it can beat the F1 car in a race on a track. The F1 car was using hard compound tires which has less grip than the soft compund which has red text it couldve made a bit of a diffrence but the lambo still wouldve won. Not on a track though haha.
that lamborghini vs the new rimac?
The the Panigale V4R back or a V4 Superleggere
Review lambos
Review lambos
Super impressive race, nothing beats a lambo with deleted rear!
Wher its labo faster of formula 😂😂  only in dream
This Lamborghini vs Rimac
Review lambos
Review lambos
I waiting Twin turbo Aventador Vs Kawasaki H2R, or twin turbo Huracan Vs Rimac. Congratulations Mat
https://youtube.com/watch?v=Gg_4R9x1_UQ&feature=share
Review lambos
That Lambo just f*ck off🔥
Plaid Vs F1 car would be interesting. From what I have seen the Plaid does 9.2 on the street. The F1 car did the same...
Review lambos
The GTR is real crap here
Damn didn't expect for this awesome race
Review Lambo
Best tune ever seen
But how many mpg?
Review lambos
Review lambos
Carwow be aging like the F&F franchise  Every new episode is just bigger and more crazy
What kind of gears does that Lamborghini have 😬
you know the F1 is loud when you can hear it from inside the lambo
next drag race: space x vs blue origin vs nasa
Hey mat thanks for this Absolutely bonkers drag race. And also pretty please do a drag race with the Rimac nevera vs bugatti chiron everyone has been asking for this drag race for such a long time if you more subscribers do these drag race immediately
BEST EPISODE YET
Lambo.. all day everyday 🌚🌝.....
Rimac Nevera vs that lambo pls.
Do race bit win bogaty vs Laborginy
In the netherlands is a 1750 hp gtr r35
R35 plates... Fukr minus the 1 lol yes! UK starting to compete with us Aussies and our custom plates finally
And then that hurracan is tied back to the garage
How much do I save on the F1 if I buy it from carwow?
Hey,, try bringing back the 1600HP and Rimac Nevera with F1... It will be very VERY close I bet...
7:57 *"I've had better"*
“I’ve just fucked off!!” - Matt
That was awesome!😎👌🏻
if it's a 2019 F1 car, it will perform better than a 2011 F1 car V8
Yenni is the happiest man today ( Lambo fan boy)
What is the 0-60 on that Lamborghini?
Rimac vs lambo next?🤷🏽‍♂🤷🏽‍♂
Not kidding, I enjoyed it enough to rewatch it 2 more times. First for a YouTube video.
try that again against Ferrari F2004, Williams BMW F1 FW26 or Mercedes-AMG F1 W11 EQ :D
Tezos was advertising in 2010?
That Huracan should have raced the Rimac! I’m sure this would have had a very fair chance. The Rimac did a 8,7 and the Lamborghini a 8,9 so… and still 600hp less than the Rimac.
These cars are awesomely quick !
Only 1 spec is necessary….Formula 1
Mat pls do this lambo vs chiron or veyron
Yanni needs a tt huracan tbh
7:14 look how quickly the lambo goes from 50 - 100 mph
All good and well. I know a drag is considered the ultimate show of power. By I would like to see that Lambo hold onto that F1 car around a race track
Woow that Lambo is Insane 😶
Think the lambo is fast you need rickys GTR on here
Better internal cameras please
DC must be missing the DRS button!!
Everytime you guy get a GTR there is always something wrong with it just get a GTR from Night Racer next time i beg!!
That Huracan is more than '1200hp'... I know its lighter than the GTR and all that but how much its quicker than the 1200hp R8 (same car) Yanni drove on this channel and a 1500hp Chiron suggests the car has about 1600hp at least, the GTR seemed like around 1300hp as suggested though.
I love Lamborghini 😀
Baking news : Lambo is going to join F1 in 2022. Driver seat : Matt Watson & Yani Race start : Using walkie talkie, haha
Matt you should do the Rimac against the the Hurican
Finally we have got a competitor to the rimac. Let's go!!!
The best drag race in Carwow ❤❤ Loved it 👌
Next, Can we have the evolve tuned M5? and the Lambo Huracan?
I guessed it’d be F1, Lambo, GT-R. Had no idea the Lambo would be that quick. It’s nuts.
F1 car vs Rimac nevera
GTR the most overrated car around
DC LOVES MAT
That was amazing - how are you going to top that at 6million subscribers?
DC should know better. The R35 generation of GTR was not a Skyline
There is something special about a car that makes more power then it weighs and is faster than an formula1 car
That lambo is naughty
6million subscribers, here we come.
How about you guys get Model S PLAID
The lambo is a one hell of a beast
That lambo just like a rocket.....
Lambo all day every day .... so as carwow 🔥🔥🔥
Holy smokes that’s one fast lambo ready to die hell yea ima die excited in that thing jajajaja😂
so... he didn't get fired xD
Naaa imagine DMO’s twin turbo perfementé
Damn! That Lambo is quick!
jesus fuck, that lambo is close to challenge the rimac nevera
Do 1000hp supra vs 1000hp lambo
Thays an nice 1/4 mile seconds....requesting you to between rimac and that tuned huracan thats fast!!!.. even rimac too...this will be interesting of the two faster beasts. BTW Congrats!! Matt For the future 6 mil This is fast!!!🥳🥳🥳🎂🎂🎂
All I can hear was that F1.
If the F1 doesn't gap you between 150-250 km/h it won't catch you. Stupid top speed isn't and never will be an F1 forte. Try to do a corner at 300 km/h though. ;)
Wow. this channel is nuts now. i’ve been here since 2018
If it wasn’t wet and on softer tyres the F1 would’ve definitely won.
Just wow
F1 sounds like a coffee grinder with 3 beans running around inside it🤣 jk
Lamborghini v new Rimac Nevera 🔥🔥
Now do the track timing
Man that Lambo is a rocket
Holy fuck the look on mats face when that lambo took off I had goosebumps down my spine. You should do this tuned huracan vs the Kawaski H2R
Please Mat, do the Lambo against the new Tesla Model S Plaid+ (1100 hp!)
Uy in the gtr is a fool
What is faster than light? Me: Matt at 7:13
I gotta get one of those nice cars that sounds good.😂 If I can afford it...
Put a turbo on f1 you will see
Literally jaw on the floor to that Lambo's acceleration 🤯
They can afford a 60 million car, but not two bicycles
Wow David Coulthard..! 👏💪🔥
Is this NFS HEAT ? Cuz both the GTR and Hurracan havent lost a single weight while having 3 times of power 😅
VET f1 car 🥺🥺 Old but gold
get the 2020 mercedes f1 car and then race it
This tuned up lambo against the Rimac Nevera
TF 😦😦😯
Crazyyy
Always wanted a lambo to win the race
Matt, if these are your ideas, then you are a certified legend. If these are not your ideas, then someone at CarWow needs to be given the credit.   Anyway, I reckon the Lotus Evija would beat all three of these cars no problem.
Matt jumps the start
Don’t get why there’s no soft tyres as well as no DRS. Otherwise F1 car would’ve won by miles.
WHERE IS PLAID DRAG?!?! We want PLAID
.its a win for the lambo ALL DAY EVERY DAY..!! By seeing a lambo I was expecting yannie..!!!👁️😂😂
That lambo is nuts.. it's like rocket
Look forward to every car race/review Matt. Keep the videos coming!
wish i could drive that hurcan
The lambo v rimac pls
Please don't say I'm sitting anymore 🙏🙏😢
YouTube drag racing…. Completed it mate ✅
Strangely enough we just posted a video about this same Huracan. Wonder who's gonna get more views 😂.
GTR 1300 horse power ????? 500 hp is dead )))))))
Cmon GTR spit Fire
f1 car vs Nevera pls
So it was a "RED" bull vs "GREEN" bull vs "Godzilla"
Always fantastic content 👍
They are breaking the laws of physics!?
How about the f1 car vs Lando Norris in a Mclaren Speedtail. Now that would be even more awesome 😃 (and if there was actual f1 commentary while the drag race happens 😆👍)
The red bull v rimac pls
This was a nice drag race. You should race that Lamborghini against the Bugatti Chiron next.
I love how ‘sleeper’ that GTR looks, you would never know it had 1300hp  Edit: I mean sleeper in terms of the power this specific GTR has. Most people know the GTR and know it’s a fast car, but you would never know that it has been tuned to 1300hp
It's official this lambo is the fastest car in carwow
Uau was insane! I just love this vídeo 😀
Im waiting for those jdm overrated fanboys, to claim their cars can clap this huracan.
Plz bring the hurcan on your next videos it's a monster
The svj has the best sounding v12 agree or not?
Gawd dayyyuuuuuummm!!! The tuned-Lambo is super charged for the race. He ain’t playing around this time. Completely put the F1 machine to a whole freaking sleep for 3 times.   …However I wanna see the tuned-Lambo against the RIMAC and the F1 Machine in a drag race. Make it happen Matt.
Audi V10 goes *brrrrrrrrrrr*
lamo is🔥🔥
Weird to think that F1 car beat a chiron last month lol
The R35 looks like a normal car at least , that Lambo is soo ugly.
By far this the best youtube channel for cars ❤️❤️
Helmut Marko's probably like how could you lose against a tuned lambo David? Perhaps we could put Sebastian in his car and he could be two-tenths faster than you lol.
I want an sf90 stradale to race that Lambo
Not letting the f1 car warm up tires?
Careful Red Bull don't take you to court because of the result of the race...
Let's be honest, Mat has the best job in the world
Who else thought of DMO’s Performante
How about trying a race between this Lamborghini, Rimac Nevera and a V12 formula 1 car. Just for a fare comparison Mat Watson.....
V10 no joke
Imagine if they actually sold that Lambo as a street legal car with the same performance. I mean, about halfway trough the race you can clearly see it ripping the asphalt from the ground
Then are the rear bumpers with diffusers are of no use...???!!!🧐
Damn, that AUDI is quickk xD
£70k spent on it and they couldn’t afford to put the back bumper back on.
One of the slowest F1 cars in the last 30 years but great you can get one F1, but if was a F1 from 2000 to 2004 the F1 would win easy!
With some cheaper stock EVs already biting the toes (or even slightly beating) these highly expensive and heavily specced/modded cars with insane HP numbers, the 1/4 mile figures are becoming less of a distinguishing measure imo, perhaps standing mile or kilometer and 0-60mph (or 0-200kmh) should be the new benchmark norm for acceleration to separate the sheep from the goats!...
7.14 holy shit the speed just rocketed!
I’m having that Lambo after tonight’s lotto comes in
Most epic drag race 🖤🖤
2011 f1 still 🤴 sound from heaven
You should make a review or race a Koenigsegg
- That was Joe's fault. ....so, won't you ask who Joe is?  - I DON'T FRICKIN' CARE WHO JOE IS. DIDN'T YOU SEE THE F1 NOT WINNING??
The fab work on the lambo tho😍
The new rimac Ferrari race was the most exciting up until this one for me. That Lamborghini is rnd the bend!!
Nice
That audi v10 is a special engine
The kind of drag races we get to see on Carwow is mind-boggling, with new car videos every day, wow I mean car wow 😁
Bring a 2014-2021 Turbo Hybrid F1 car and enjoy the show 😆😆😆
The traction on that Lamborghini is insane
Didn't see that coming !!!!  F-1 Lose ???!!!
That lambo  is faster  than the chiron
GTR may have lost the race, but won our hearts with 9.3 seconds.
You can buy a rimac and be an environmental hippie or turbo your hurrican and look like a fucking beast
We really need tesla plaid in this rase
3:16 f1 revs and Matt hits the exactly same pitch when he screams “that’s just nuts” 🤣 Also David Coulthard? You’re getting really big CarWow….
Brooooooo. Need Ricky's Gtr on... come on.
Fucking hell that lambo is crazy fast
I would love to watch 1000+hp Supra mkIV vs F1 car
I thought rolls Royce boat tail is unnecessarily expensive but 63m for that F1 is just nuts!!!
Your the best Carwow 😘
WOW
That Lambo looks like a batmobile from the back
You know the Lambo isn't normal when you the rear bumper is gone and all the parts are visible
Cool race, surprised the F1 car got beaten. Not sure they're putting the stickiest tyres on that Red Bull though. One detail I did not appreciate from Red Bull is the rebadging with Honda stickers when it's a Renault powered car. Seems rather lame to me.
use a so old f1 is a nosense
F1 car's are dead now day's sound absolutely crap, and i know it's still a V8 but compared to the old V10 and V12...
If only it was an A-ven-ta-dor
Lame-bo
I wanted to see David launch the lambo
What the hell was that.
MORE TUNED CARS
I'm losing track of time. We need CarWoW speed wall!
If the F1 car was on softer tires like softs or supersofts, the lambo wouldn't have had a chance. And the tarmac isn't quite good.
I'm goin to bolt 2 turbos to my mum's Toyota Corolla
ayyyy
Now put a tuned 911 turbo s and watch how you hear: oo well the Porsche won 😂
As if the lambo is that fast Jesus
Where is GTR fanboys ?????
I guess the age old saying 'never trust a Lamborghini without a bumper' holds true
It's easy to beat a F1 care where there are no bends 😆
Dang bring in all kinds of races. The f1 vs nevera. The lambo vs the nevera. Etc etc
Take the same F1 car which was taken in drag race with Bugatti.
Lambo runs on diesel?
Great fun
I think Yianni is a very happy man after this video because a Lambo beat a Formula 1 car!!!!
F1 car is so light always constrained by grip off the line. It always seems that when an F1 car is tested to drag it's on a drizzly cold day with a mediocre surface so we never see the best of it. Most of the time they race on a warm summers day on hot tyres and tarmac. Conditions are everything for an F1 such is their design to operate at peak performance in narrow temperature windows.
220......that's insane. Never seen him do close to 220 in a drag race. Good god
Ya know, it's a different pain when you don't see the F1 winning
Still waiting for a Bicycle Race between Yianni and Mat
Honda vs Lamborghini vs nissan
Not bad Matt, you only clearly jumped 2 of the 3 starts 🤣
Sir,  would you please do this lambo vs ferrari sf90. i believe it'll be awesome.
Damn😳, that Lamborghini is fast asf. What the hell, what type of engine is under that hood and how much does it cost to own one ? That is going on my list of dream cars I want to own one day.
Now i might never watch f1 races
Honestly Matt, you might aswell just get a turtle to race that F1 car.
I like these videos but this presenter is a total prat. He's not funny and is missing about and pulling weird faces. I was once rooting for him to present Top Gear but not anymore
Put the lambo and nevera against each other, drag race of the year
I don’t expect that happened 🤯🥵
I don't watch any other car channel regularly other than car wow. This channel is absolutely thrilling and amazing. Love Matt & Yanni and the car wow team ❤️
That lambo is from hell
very interesting video
Not surprised at all. Would love to see the reaction to a UGR X3 version with 3000 wheel hp, lol
The hurackan❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Those cars didn't break any record in carwow drag races??????
Great fucking Content period. Great to the variety of cars from stock to wild drag and roll race 😎🤘🏽🤘🏽🤘🏽
I remembee when Carwow used to be boring...now its one of the most popular car channels...hard work pays off
How to launch an F1 car example: mode slow, 1 burn out, a static bitepoint learn, func 4, mode race start and you good to go
Now a lap round a track please..
You always drive the 1st cars 😤😡
the accleretion is amazing, but that breaking power must suck your eyes out of your head
Make a video of 765lt drag race pleeeeaaase
that f1 sound incredible
That's what you call a PR disaster for Red Bull. DC probably won't get another loaner from CH any time soon.
3:57 🥵🥵🥵
What a race that Lambo is crazy
Carlow hooking us up with the Drag Race of our dreams!! Thanks guys, the race was insane
That RB7 sounds magnificent😍😍
Ricky from llf his Gtr gives that lambo a real run for its money... That's the race we  need to see
JM Imports! Levels 👏
Finally he changed the walkie talkie
8.9 seconds!! 😱😱
That labmbo was an absolut beast 😧😍😍😍 8,9 in the quarter and 220mph in the whole mile, next time Rimac Nevera against the Red Bull
Mat your a cheater 🤨😂😂😂
Brilliant!
Just wow!
They need to use a new Formula 1 car
That Lambo vs Nevera 🔥🔥🔥
You can still hear the F1 car from inside the lambo at full chat ! I miss the old F1 days
The sound!!!!!! What a video, i would watch it on on, thank you carwow team!!!!
Hurrah Hurrah can
If you really expected a Lamborghini without a back bumper to lose,you are stupid
Freak Hulk Lamboo 🐂🤣💚
Finally,no cocky bugatti involved
The Lambo is nuts
Wow this drag races are hitting new highs each and every time
Godzilla, VS Kong VS megazila right here happening in real time. Sweet Jesus christ that lambo sounds 👌🏿💯💯💯💯. I just wished when they launch 1000hp rides they need to push it to 1 mile rather than 1/4 mile.
I liked the video without watching cause of F1 car😍😍
And now the hybride powered current f1 car. It would blitz this
I guess it has to do with the f1 tyres
Fake ad fuck
I think lambo you should build a twin turbo hurracan ❤️🔥
Help Me Carwow. How much can I save on the F1?
Nemera vs Lambo!
What’s the 0-100 time in that Lamborghini 😬😬😬😬😬
Matt, You broke all the bussiness. Hi 5 from Poland! Im in shock. Everything is possible on Cwow!
202mph Mat, your fastest on the channel
F1 car still sounds the best out of the three. Goose bump noise
This was so intense, it made me shed tears out of excitement! Absolutely epic!
That lambo kept going without missing a beat. What a build!
WOW! I actually did not expect that. Don't get me wrong I know in a straight line there are many things that can stay with an f1 car and even beat it but still very impressive that lambo!!
I know its tuned but still...daiyum that Lambo is quick!!!
Why is that gtr so slow?
The fastest lamborghini
10 second cars, Family
I want to see three races- 1. This lambo against a supra with parachute in the back 2. This lambo against Porsche 992 911 turbo s 3. This lambo against Rimac Nevara
SHEEEEEEESH!!!!!!!!
62.5 Million in the dust XD
Was that the fastest quarter mile ever made on this channel??
Yanni will be happy. Brilliant video!
Thnx 😍
9.3s quarter mile, and you're last. That's a win for me
You can see the f1 cars engine struggling against the down force at higher speeds
Watching straight outter kenya 🇰🇪
That was nuts!
Want it, Lamborghini
yep in a drag race, a tuned lambo will definitely win. however, an F1 car is not built with a straight line in mind. and actually, i don't think DRS was used. If my memory serves me right, DRS was first introduced in F1 2011. It would definitely have DRS. So i think the gap will be shortened if DRS was used? Don't know much about the mechanics of your race so I wouldn't know if it was used. But I would definitely love to see you guys race those 3 same cars in a circuit, because that would make the difference between an F1 and a performance street car.
So…… I NEED that Lamborghini build ASAP lmao 😂 that thing is beautiful
Crazy
Nahhh this race was the craziest that lambo did the madness 🤣🤣
8.9s, just slightly over the Rimac..... *hint*hint*hint*
Someone lied on the GTR entry.
Next race rimac vs 1200hp lambo
This lambo is the pure evil...
Could you do an all tesla range test please? =)
Any car that makes an f1 car look slow is a beast. Good to see some sub 10 second cars (sub 9 for the lambo 🤯)
matt is the king of all the car youtubers
we need a tune 765lt lol
The last drag was the best drag I've ever watched
Imagine getting gapped in a 62 million quid car
Yianni would love that lambo
hey car wow do you know porsche 9ff ?  it would be cool if u can get one in your channel. you know the 9ff was the first car series who got over 400km/h 4 moths befor buggati🙌🏻
Rimac vs lambo
This channel is getting BETTER and BETTER!
Next level fighter jet plane😜
You know it's a good drag race when the slowest quarter mile time is 9.3 seconds. O.M.G.
am i the only one who wants carwow to add the mph and time the cars trap at the 1/4 mile pass or ...
The Lamborghini sounds good. Also very fast, super I like it. But I saw a video between Bugatti Veyron and F1 but f1 won the race also accelerates very fast so why in this race it didn't beat the Lamborghini. Bcoz I think lambo wins bcoz its tuned... Right?
Definitely wasnt expecting the lambo to dominate like that. Sick race.
Drag race for 1 mile (lambo vs F1 vs gt r) Will be so unpredictable 😉
Wtf???🤯🤯
Lambo fanboy here. Just came to leave some moisture💧
Dam y0 buzz!
Would be good to see the latest Tesla Model S Plaid against this lot!!!
All under 10 seconds. Carwow's record
Is the F1 car on hard tyres ? and not on the softs ?
Karen Horner is currently reporting Matt to the stewards for jumping the lights.
Open the fuckin DRS on f1 car.
This lambo is a killer ouawwwww
The lamborghini remind me to DAILY DRIVEN EXOTIC LAMBORGINI HURACAN TWINTURBO… soooooo crazzzzyyyyy
Once again videos get better and better
Why is Mat plain white boring?
That huracan does the 1/4 mile faster then my car can do 0-60😭😂
Lamborghini vs Nissan vs Honda
Lambo is with 700 hp less just in the near of the so hyped Rimac time 😅
Mantap anjg
Epic
We need to see the Ariel Atom V8 up against the big boys.
Well this is because the Porsche is on vacation, wait until she cames back💔😂😂😂
Ope   drs
Christ that Lamborghini's fast.
Race the rimac vs that lambo
Next video: Matt vs NASA
We want bugatti chiron vs 1200hp lamborghini
YOOO WHAT CHIRON CAN'T CATCH UP EVEN 1500 HP BUT LOOK ĹAMBO 1200 HP SAY BYE BYR
Tt hurrican vs turbo s???
That lambo was absolutely nuts! Mat, we want to see this lambo against Tesla Model S plaid. Bring it on!
Rimac, Buzz's Lambo and Ricky LLF's next 😍
Next race for F1 car should be Tesla S Plaid. It should be pretty even race.
Somewhere in London,  Someone is screaming "Lambo all day Mate"
ive never seen a lambo like that. the launch and power is MEGA!! Your so lucky to have that job
whars the carwow deal on F1?
This was literally one of the bestt drag race ever, Really enjoyed it. Thanks Matt
Can you get any bike's in for drag racing? Like bike v F1 car v Lambo etc
Buzz's lambo is insane, ¼ in 8.9 is madness. Can't wait for Ricky's GTR to show up
WTF.. ! is this insane Lamborghini... More Lambo and More F1 Red Bull
Turbo S will smash that lambo...
Holy shit,  that lambo is crazy. it would even keep up with Rimac Nevera
"I've just fucked off" - Mat Watson 2021.
THAT TT LAMBO IS NUTS!!!!!!!
This was insane... 8.9secs...
9.3s ...coming last...how the cars and technology progressed...bonkers!!!
V10 power
lamborgini was always jumping jumping at the start.
*Next F1 vs SUPRA* 🔥
Why the F1 car only uses white wall tire (medium compound perhaps?) Why it didn't the red ones? (Soft)
Rimac VS Lambo pls
Yiannimize would be so proud of this win for lambo😂💯
I mean, It’s been a year since carwow had 2M subscribers.
6:03 😂😂😂
7:37 wow that gtr was asking for more😵😵😵😵
RIMAC  NEVERA
Looks like Im done watching F1
Do the lambo 1200hp vs a Lamborghini svj
What About a dragrace between multiple redbull cars of different generations to see how they have improved
this lambo vs Bugatti 😍
This lambo vs rimac nevera🤯
Lamborghini a new F1 team???
That Lamborghini should be a constant feature until it gets beat. WOW!
What amazing video....woooww
Lambo vs rimac nevera?
Where’s the bumper for the Huracan?
F1 cars are not built for strait line speed. Put the three cars on a track and tight corners and F1 wins every time!!
Not normally a massive fan of Lambos, but that is incredible. Sounds awesome and is mega fast. "I've f**ked off" was hilarious
Until there's a corner and the f1 turns hard. Meanwhile the two others go straight into a wall lol
4:00 age restricted
So who agrees the Lambo should have the license plate F1 KILLER 🥷🏿
Unbelieveable. My childish dreams comes true. Absolutley unreal.
Matt getting scared of the speed
Remac Vs f1
Who made that lambo?!
This is the craziest race ever
JDM fans :- grt NISMO, the most expensive gtr tuned is the best Just a entry level lamborghini with 2 turbos :- hold my beer 🍻
Formula 1 car does 1/4 mile in 9s? I don't believe it. Looks like shortshifting and a save engine mode.
7:36 is that 220mph.....wearing shorts & a jumper....lol
Gtr never 1300hp ! Max have 800hp
I’m sure Yianni is so happy with this race  Now he is saying Lamborghini all days every days with that walkie-talkie hand watch 😂😂😂
My favourite race 😘😘❤️❤️
Can someone remember me the time of the rimac nevera ? I forgot it
That Lambo is  BEAUTIFUL ❤️
😱😱😱😱😱😱
It has to be said that just saying an F1 car doesn't really mean much these days. The cars today are turbo hybrids that are faster than the 2011 RB7 by some margin. Especially the launches where they can use some of that hybrid power, which wasn't available in 2011. In F1 terms, 10 years is the equivelant of 20 years+ in Street car terms. Very evident by how Racing Point had what was effectively the championship winning car of 2019, but was nowhere near the top, just a season later. Still, this is a mighty drag race I would love to see again with other cars as well. RIMAC VS this Lambo would be interesting, add the SF90 and that 1000hp 991 Turbo S. 😁
Do lambo vs Rimac vs F1. Please
People from Walsall: Matt, let's get things straight... you're not a brummie! Rest of the World: ???
u should have added a tesla model s plaid it the group
The lambo versus the rimmac next pls!
Gasoline engine and gearbox engineers should get pissed off and take the upcoming electric takeover personally, and put out some 1,500 hp cars before they no longer have the chance.  Like forget all this slow buildup from 500 to 600 to 700 hp and so on, and skip right to 1,500-2,000 hp as a last sendoff.
Brilliant video!!! You guys are the best!!
GTR license plate reads F**CKER
Too much traction loss for the F1, could it be because its a tarmac and not a race track?
If i was mat i would just give bc u never mess around with bumper deleted huracans
DC 6:30 "At the mile we would definitely have the advantage over you" Sorry mate not today!
Imagine how a V10 F1 car would perform there.
Mat's reaction time🔥 so underrated
I'd really love to have a go at the Huracán with my 1973 Corolla
It’s crazy how small small all F1 engines are
Seeing the f1 car far behind hits different
GTR BEST 😍👍
What was the best time for the lambo?
And that’s why legend says, do not race a lambo without rear bumper....
Hi Mat can you please do a race featuring the BMW M5 CS and the Mercedes GT63 BRABUS 900
He jumped the start 👀👀🥶
Can you please do a review on a HAVAL JOLION 👀
LLF's skyline would of taken it i reckon
I would love to see a couple of laps between the f1 and the lambo tho 😁
That poor F1 car with just 3 digit HP
Would love to see a 9ff  1200+ car im that race 🤔
Once again, best CAR channel on Youtube...WOW. enjoyable&entertaining. When Matt's Mum drag race Yannis, I quit the internet!!! 😅😷🤣
Waiting for tesla plaid……..👹👹👹
Wow fastest REAL car on the channel a lambo.. you can mention the rimmac which is only just faster but has another 700 hp lol and didnt do it on the carwow strip which is a rougher surface then the selected promo event rimmac chose so bring the rimmac here and its guaranteed to be slower then the previous 8.6 so who knows maybe it loses to this 1300hp lambo on the carwow strip  anyhow imagine what this lambo would do to the rimmac with another 700 hp.........
So an IC engine still can beat EV car in timings
that lambo is just too much😅🇮🇹🙏
I wanna see that Lamborghini vs the new rimac 🤯
TT lambos should go up in value from here on
You jump the start everytime😂
*CARWOW NEVER DISSAPOINTS....MAT IS THE KING*
Loving this channel and content!
Felt like the lambo's HP was a lie Sandbagger 💀
Where is the Tesla Model S Plaid?
It would be great if you show leaderboard of drag race at the end of the video
Rimac Nevera vs This Hurcan OOF
Buzzy singh must be proud of his bad boy 😂😂😂😂😂.
Don't mess with lambo
This is probably the first video in which I can't stop smiling through out the entire video
Why Yani is not in Lamborghini?
All these vs the rimac😃
It would be great, ive we see the LAMBO against the RIMAC NEVERA
Why've they took the old livery off it and put the new one on
The sounds while crossing the quarter mile line though....
Matt jumped it as always 😂
Great cars mat
That's just crazy.....
This is one of the best drag races  Awesome guys 👏🏻👏🏻
Mat is the king of drag racing❤❤❤
That f1 never gonna catch the TT, doesn’t matter how long the runway is
the best race of carwow! can't imagine what's next haha
Rimac v staged lambo
Dude....you took the Legendary David Coulthard's name just randomly...my head was blown up..He is a frikkin Legend along with Schumacher and Montoya..He was McLaren-Merc teamed with Mika Hakkinen. Man the memories of early 2000s.
This is crazy
♥️
Need to see Ricky's 2000bhp r35
you can never mess with a lambo with no back bumpers
Every drag race is becoming ever so...    more and more nuts!
Hi mat try getting the rimac c2 to drag race the F1 car. But that Lamborghini is amazing your face said it all when you launched it for the first time down that runway.
Now try the 2020 red bull vs the lambo and the nevera
Next f1 car vs any car in circuit
tuned m5 evolve vs that  lambo vs  buggati chiron
sick
I think this is going to put you over 6 million!
That lambo singhs
Technically it's 3 races 2 jump starts and 1 actual race. But even if it's 3 correct starts Lambo would still win.
6:54 a keverem a szószom a zene ahogy beszél alatta? (:
This F1 car needs another gear box for the drag races)
they need the 2016-2017 rb car. Those cars had monster top speeds
Every other video with redbull f1 car, it will the king. redbull team will be upset after this video.
Awesome race, pushing the envelope!
I was expecting the 2 heavily tuned cars not to work. Surprise... Surprise 👏
Mat has the dream job
After a rough week, carwow video is exactly what I need.
hey matt, we need Remac with these 2 cars
Wtf I need that Lambo power
This is the reason why I subbed to this awesome channel
But F1 can continue in the corner with same speed 😎😎😎
Lambo beat the F1 and F1 beat the buggati does that mean this Lambo is faster than buggati 🤔
Did mike Ami drag race combo.  Lol. This one just lovely.  Tho
WE WOULD AAAAABBBBSSSOOOLUUUUTELY LOVE TO SEE THAT F1 CAR AGAINST A MOTO GP BIKE......😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Lambo against Rimac should be next 😱
Go to love that Honda branded Renault
Well doesnt that lambo fuckn hoot .
lambo fastest car in carwow
that lambo vs the f1 vs rimac nevera
Did the Lambo do 220mph??!!  What tyres are they using.....NASA slicks.
You should have used Ricky LLF's 1900bhp R35 GTR 🤔😬🙏
I would love to see a drag race with a Porsche 918 spyder…BTW great video, I didn‘t expect this!
Lambo straight from hell😈
Red Bull about to blame Lewis Hamilton for making the runway too short.
Gets to the drag and the fucking adverts come on, sack Carloway, them shit!!!!
Please race this lambo with that tunned porche 👍
That Lamborghini is insane.
It says ' no results ' when I searched that F1 in Carwow! Disappointed 😞
Would like to see that Lambo against a Bugatti and that F1 car against a Koenisegg. Great vid.
Next video idea  1200hp Lamborghini Vs Tesla model s plaid Please!!!
Lambo is faster then everything 😹❤️
get dmo on here with his quad and lambo
That lambo means business 😨
try corner speed with that F1 car
This is just crazy insane Holly shit
Surprisingly the tuned cars made it through the video this time 🏎
This is by far one of my favorite. 💯
Tesla plaid vs F1 please!
Ne možeš tako da računaš vrednost auta odnosno formule budžet za sezonu podeljen sa četiri, bože koliko si g***
Definitely need to see the T.T Huracan vs Chiron after watching this one
OMG that lambo is just flying
This lambo versus the rimac and the f1! It’s the race you need to do
Has anyone else noticed that it seems to be the car to the far right of the track losing most.
I did not also expect that lol the best race ever please do vf supercharged performante
In all the F1 races that I have been the thing that amazed me most was the braking. It’s incredible how those cars slow down for the first corner.
GTR All Day
Next time a race with Boeing 777 vs airbus A380🤣
Rimac Nevera:1900 hp, 8.7 seconds. Tuned Gallardo: 1200 hp, 8.9 seconds. Petrol is still the king!
So the Lambo is just slightly slower over the 1/4 mile than the lady shaver (Rimac) but sounds and looks better and is alot cheaper! Brilliant.
Brummie in the fastest car again shocker!!!!!
that's crazy
The 250million was to pay staff (executives, drivers pit crew etc) R&D, travel, upgrades and more... the car was about 2 to 3million.
Imagine getting pinned by carwow
I wonder how yianni must have felt sitting in that hyper lambo
8.9 1/4 mile thats crazy
Here before Trending
Wow, so fast.  Hm, if you can test this Lamborghini vs Rimac Nevera ,pls) This will be amazing drag race.  So, thanks for the videos 😀
Yanni definitely deserved to drive the Lambo!
Fastest drag race ever
The Lamborghini is so  hot and killing it 🔥🔥😍😍😍 Best Car ever on this Chanel
Now race that with the Nivera:)
we all thought YIANNY would be driving the lambo didnt we all? hahaha...thats what lambo would do if they took the porsche route of turbos
Can you get all that to VS a stock Tesla Plaid S maybe? 😅😝 But honestly I would love to see a Rimac vs Nio EP9. Battle of the EVs 😅
Awesome video . But who the hell can give it a thumbs down. 🤔🤔
Assuming my maths is right (probably isn't... ) average speed over the whole quarter mile was around 100mph! Madness
Epic keep them coming matt 👍👍
You are fucking mad, I mean you are drag racing a fricking f1 car. Let's all take a moment of silence for the king of YouTube 👏
Modern F1 car would've trashed the lambo
That Lambo looks like the Marvel equivalent of Abomination. That Nissan looks the finest. Soo subtle.
That Lamborghini is faster than the Bugatti in a drag race .... Nice 👍👍👍
That lambo fuck me
😳 😳 😳 What's with this lambo, how could it beat the GT-R
Holy Christ the Lamborghini damn near pulled a wheelie!
Rimac vs f1
"So I´m sat in the Millenium Falcon and next to me is the Imperial Star Destroyer, and we are going to have a drag race."
That Lambo is insane - 2 added turbos!!  DC did not like getting beat 😂
Hmm did he say Skyline 🥴
love it
That lamborghini just flys out of there
Under 9 seconds is just insane and must be a carwow first?
Lambo has aloud sound but I can't hear that when the red bull tourn on😂😍
1200 HP Lamborghini vs Rimac
Wow… Just wow…. Never in a million years would you think that in just 10-11yrs - a tuned Lamborghini would monster an F1 car
Ok but how much can you save through carwow on a f1 car?
That Lambo! 😵 King Kong! 🏌🏿‍♂️☄️
How did the f1 car win against a chiron but lose against a Lamborghini? 🤔
I really love the Drag Race videos in terms of the competitors you put together each video. I do not like the way they're cut. I'd like to really be able to tell what is going on, but with all the completely random cuts it's just not possible. Of course, you get a vague idea, but that's about it. Maybe you can clean up the cutting style or maybe I'm alone with this opinion, just wanted to share.
Freaking fast Lambo
That lambo's fast no question, but what the hell happened to that gtr
220 mph and seemingly completely stable in the lambo.  I wonder why Lamborghini doesn’t just build that car now, unless it’s because it’s going to break pretty quickly.
Next Saturday……..  So I’m sitting in a F1 car, next to me is a F-22 Raptor Jet and lastly we have a NASA Space Rocket, let’s have a drag race…..! 🚀💥💥🏁
Mat getting a model s plaid request for the millionth time
This is just mental, Matt you have an done yourself this is bonkers 🤪🤪
Never thought we'd ever say a car on Carwow came last with 9.3 second. 😂 Carwow is levelling up. 💯🔛🔝
Matt vs Yanni wheelchair drag race
That Lamborghini got up and went bloody amazing drag race
The lambo is so bad its unreal. Imagine how horrible it would be to drive. Ruined an amazing car to go fast uncomfortable in a straight line.
Did the gtr braked early?
Loved that lambo mincing a f1 car
That Lambo was summon from hell's racing department. 🤯
That Lambo is amazing broooo
That Lambo against the Rimac please
This is bananas. When  a 9.3 sec 1/4mile just isn't quick enough. What a time to be alive.
The sound of Formula 1 is eargasm ❤️ it's so sweet ❤️
Rimac vs f1 car
Finally got the JM team on board. Best tuners in the country.
3:32 is why you came here.
That Lamborghini is a bullet
Puff menuda máquina,pero el f1 honda no corre nada.
AMAZING 🤩
Now with a 2021 f1 car
can i just drive that lambo too? man it looks ridiculous kinda like its eating air
Drag race of the year right here!! Tbh i thought F1 would come first, then the nissan and then the lambo. Wasn t disappointed!
How about that lambo vs Rimac Nevera
The F1 car has a better power to weight ratio than the other cars actually.. but still lose??
Yanni would love to have been driving that lambo
Race the Lambo against the remac
I think lambo is lambo no one can beat your lambo bro.
Oh so y’all post at 4 in the morningggg bet🔥
Give Red Bull soft tyre
Man just imagine how fast those 3500hp ugr huracans are now.
Make a race betwen this Lamborghini and Nissan GTR 2500 hp so this Nissan is from Vis Kosova
One of the best drag racers ever NGL
Lambo all day, everyday ❤️
but this is not the real F1. make the videos with the current F1.
The lambo 👀👀👀👀😜😜😜😜
Need to update the leaderboards because that lambo isn’t up there…  It’s nearly as fast as that Rimac holy moly
His face on the first Lambo-launch! Mat Shathimself Whatsgoingon :D
I clicked expecting the F1 to obliterate the Lambo and GTR but boy was that Lambo on steroids!  Super awesome work Matt and team!
This David Coulthard was biggest loser in f1, and here is he not better
That’s not DC in the f1 car it’s Gerald from Clarkson’s farm
Yay! No electric cars 😍😂
The TT Huracan is cool, but not having a rear bumper is just ricer as crap.
Man! That Lambo! 🔥
JM-Imports do know how to build their cars 😅
I would be very interested in a dragrace between f1 car and motogp bike
Sebastian Vettel’ car sound amazing
You guys are stepping up ⬆️ the game  Well done 👍 mat & car wow
Rimac still quicker
How much did the r35 cost?
I think try mercedes in the next f1 car cos it's much faster
That  F1 car has the same sound as stock lambo . 🔥
Lotus Evija, Rimac Nevera, F1 car
Where is Nevera?!!
Do we know how much torque has this lovely N/A 2.4L Honda ? 😍 Thanks carwow You're the new Fast and Furious since Fast and Furious is now fiction and violence movies
So a F1 car beats a almost 2K HP Buggati chiron but loose to 1300HP Lambo
I'm sure you can think of a better way than talking on some 1980s walkie-talkie 🤣
F1 have a top speed from  372  so how can he ever lose the race
That Lambo is insane.
That lambo is the definition of fast and furious
Man like Bashir 😉
If  you have lambo and thats says you have big balls-mr.umut
That Lambo it just puts its power down so cleanly  simply awesooooome 👌
When is there a challenge with an actual 9FF Porsche? 😉
How about a race between this  lambo and rimac nevera
Incredible stuff guys
Absolutely insane!
I love your videos, but do you mind including one scene where all of car specs are included on top of cars as it would be easier to pause and compare rather than trying to remember every cars stats.
One of the best races yet!🥵
LLF M5 vs DMO E63s🥶🥶🙏🏽🤞🏽
Lambo❤
Wow the first tuned GT-R that had no problems with the drag race
3:16 "It was at this moment, I knew.... I nutted."
Put that lambo against that Rimac
F1 car vs Chiron vs Rimac would be interesting
That lambo is just insane 🤯 big fan of DC sir 😁
That Lamborghini was defination of speed , style , power......
That lambo... Pffffhhtt....
When ya road car is faster than an F1 car (going straight) you've done something right.. Bragging rights for sure
it would have been interesting to test them on a track
🤣matt looked genuinely petrified at that start
carwow can make compilation of Mat giving wrong stats
NISSAN👍️
Matt is there a chance you could race the Huracan twin turbo with the Model S Plaid? Cheers, Chris.
Hey Mat, is it possible if David can activate his DRS for drag race please?
Where else on YouTube can you find videos like this?
You need to race that Lamborghini Huracan with the Rimac Nevera
0-100 100-0 tests 👍
This video is surprising 🔥
Hey mat how are you this is unbelievable and this lambo can crush chiron even gtr can isn't it
Get @livinglifefast Nissan GTR on here
I wish the F1 car had won😂
Next the tuned M5!
Meybe race this Lambo vs Rimac Nevera?
3:19 me when my mum allowed us to go to McDonalds back in the day
This was so fun!! Really enjoyed it... And yeha about the sound that Lamborghini was good but there's no beating F1
Carwow is rising↗️↗️↗️
Indian you're next video can you please do with a Lamborghini versus a Bugatti Veyron please
This lambo vs rimac nevera  in a drag race
Moreee of these brutal races
You know it will be crazy race when there is F1 car .
As soon as he said twin turbo V10... It's over, it's done. Also as soon as he said "built 4.1L engine..." It's over, it's done.😂
Really expected more from the f1 car
That's it I'm taking my bumpers off today and slapping on some green paint. Lol. Insane video.
*We're smashing the Lowest time ever recorded on a quarter mile race video after video lol* 😹🐻
That Lamborghini probably BURNT out it's Rear!
Trust me Lambo is suck
I really love it when the notification says "someone liked your comment" and "someone subscribed to your channel",
I think any Koenigsegg can get that hurucan in 1mile or less.
Matt's math is "slightly" off.  The cost of an F1 car is about 12M GBP
Man that lambo went flying wtf
Just keeps getting better
Rimac be like: Hold my beer 🍺🍺🍺🍺
Go NISSAN GTR R35 NISMO VS HONDA NSX VS FORD GT 🙏🙏
FAKE RACE
Пц!
Imagine this lambo racing against  Rimac Nevera😳
Good race 🤙🏼
You know a car is fast when Matt Watson looks scared
That Lambo is from an Indian guy 😍❤️
Every video with an f1 car uses and old one, you should try to drive a 2020 one
That helium voice 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 “where is he I’m gonna do this again!”
Imagine theses tuned cars vs a stock Chiron 🤯
Family won’t do this time
That Lambo! My goodness😳🔥🔥🔥
That Lamborghini is nutssss!!
F1 who watch this in 2021? lol
You guys are insane, I love you ,👍😂
You know your car is quick when people shit their pants while driving it
So what have we learned here boys ? Don’t race a Lamborghini without a rear bumper.
anjas lambo trondol
You should have a leaderboard of all the drag race times
Impressive how you dropped both Walkie talkies and floored it !
That lambo against the 911 turbo s.
Imagine they use RB15 with low downforce wing configuration against that lambo and gtr
If there’s anything that can silence a toxic  fanboy, it would be an Italian exotic without a rear bumper
This Lambo is incredible :o Bro why they dont make biturbo versions of huracan or aventador in Lamborghini ? it would smash everything
That was awesome......my question is why do you never invite a H2 Kawasaki to the party?????or that’s right these car are Modded ok then get a mod H2....
🤤 Nice to see a modded exotic, most exotics are stock...with no character or it’s just wrapped.
Lambo is madness. Not seen many cars launch like that
BEST Lambo so far.......
Nobody talks about F1 car, it lost because is stock  standard. Ha,ha. Please bring the new F1 turbo car. The clash of Titans
I would love to see where a modern f1 car would come in this race
There's no way that Lambo has only 1200 hp...
A lambo beating a F1 car is some serious speed ! Loved the race.. try racing this lambo with rimac concept 2.. i would love to see petrol heads rejoicing a win against the electric
Did david just call a R35 a skyline😐
Is that the fastest a GTR can do the 1/4 mile? I thought GTRs could do 7s and 6s.
The Indian guy's lambo is meant to get him to the washroom fast
The F1 car too loud the rest are basically EVs
Top gear wishes it could compete with this.
I would like u use a chart summarizing the weight and price and stuff
Yeah but all we want to see is the Plaid smoking the lot
That Lamborghini! Fuck!!! Need more races from those with thode hyper cars and also those electric cars
Hey!! U should have a drag race between this lamborghini huracan and rimac nevera, that would to insane
That Lambo vs the rimac would be an epic race
Can you organize a race Sf90 vs Lamborghini?
it would be interesting if the RB7 uses DRS
That F1 car has the original Fast&Furious gearbox dude
crazy race!
Poor sweet GTR 🤮
Great having a F1 car on the channel. What about a 2004 V10 F1 car or one from the current hybrid turbo's?
imagine yianni being there and not driving the lambo
The F1 car is just spinning its wheels. No traction at all.
We need to see that Lamborghini vs Rimac
This is hands down one of my favourite channels ever!
Llf Ricky gtr smokes these cars I’m fairly sure… you need to get it in the Chanel!!
YIANNI ENTERS THE CHAT: "LAMBO all day. EVERYDAY."
Coulthards always been shit at launches
Maybe you can race a modded supra Mk4
Power corrupts, Matt went a bit crazy
7:20  🤣🤣🤣
you shoud try the lambo aventador svj twin turbo 2000hp
That huracan is a beast
We have to get w11to drag race
Formula 1 might aswell make buzzy Singh the head of development
The chronic failed against the failed car
Mat keeps jumping the start
Only car wow can do this
Nevera vs twin turbo Lamborghini make it happen carwow.Carlow. it's just 2/10th off Nevera pace.
Wow ❗ What an awesome drag race. Mat plz make a drag race with a audio rsq8 r vs a Ferrari 812 GTS
Holy crap this thing is fast
That Lamborghini just f**ks off. I am  blown away by its performance 🤯🤯🤯. WE NEED TO SEE THAT LAMBO AGAINST THE RIMAC !!!!!
Red bull isn’t giving their f1 car anymore to Matt lol
please make a video on bugatti chiron and that insain lambo
He actually said skyline for the r35 😂
Imagine a 2017 Porsche Turbo S with no rear bumper and some Twin Turbos like this… 🥴🥴⚠️⚠️
They made a 9 sec Gtr look slow
Good one Matt
That lambo vs rimac would be great
Would be even crazier to race an F1 car against a Koenigsegg Jesko, Aston Valkyrie or even a Mercedes-AMG ONE
F1 vs rimac please
Fun race.  Would F1 V10s be faster ?
🔥🔥🔥🔥
TESLA S PLAID PLSSS
CarWow must have great insurance cover to take financial responsibility for a £62 F1 car driven by world record holder David Coulthard. The record? The only F1 driver to crash out on the parade lap .
dang that lambo is a beast
Love to see the current generation F1 car do this and not a 10 year old one.
I want to see a twin turbo 458 go with this Huracan Singh!  It's gonna b me fucking epic!
Absolutely insane drag race this weekend, Matt!! Christmas definitely came early on this one. They sound and race so angrily & beautifully 😍
Surprisingly both Lamborghini and GTR performed better than Chiron !!!
1200 BHP Lambo VS Rimac Nevara VS F1 car please!
DC!
F1 hybrid
Imagine running a 9.3 at Car wow drags and coming last. Those are some seriously quick cars. The F1 brakes.. man always knew their braking was nuts but its not every day you get to see a real world comparison against standard cars.. even high performance ones getting absolutely smashed.
the last time the f1 car win the race against the bugatti but now that lambo just did it.🔥🔥🔥
Add a 360 curve at the end and get them to come back the opposite way
Mat do it with the rimac nevera That lembo you Rimac with yanni
F1 Tyres: spinning and struggling for grip Mazepin: liked that
its unfear for the F1 next time call lewis hamilton
best video yet'
That's 100k views in less than an hour.
Everyone Gangster till a lambo with no rear bumper appears
Does that redbull's front and rear wing cost same as that Lamborghini?
Anything below 10 seconds is mental i tell ya
Buzz’s car is a missile 🐸
2 jumps for the lambo.....
Bruh I'm surprised Yianni isnt here when there's a lambo
That Lambo is on another level of awesome!
This made my sunday..
I knew one day a road car would smash an F1 car but I didn’t think today was that day 😲🤯🙌👍 brilliant.
Gtr still impressive
Rimac complete the 1/4Mile in 8.7 sec That Lambo in 8.9 sec
Try with Mercedes w12😂😂
i love this lambo😍
Will we ever see a 2021 F1 car here? We need a machine like that before F1 changes the wheels and make the cars a little slower for 2022 season.
I thought Yianni would be in the Lamborghini.  :-|
And now we need a 2020 f1 car vs that huracan vs the Rimac
Wow, wow, wow...🤪
3:30
F1 vs zr1 c7 manual stage 3 which is more difficult to dirve  Me vette
Matt... You are living the dream 😍
化け物勢ぞろい
That Lambo is NUTS, but I'd still go for the GT-R. Not only my dream car, but a proper sleeper this one.
Best drad racing channel
Lamborghini just beat F1 red bull
No wonder the lambo is fast coz there's no yanni inside ❤️😂🙏
Never seen in my life a car accelerate so quick. Insanity 7:14
All three cars are nuts 😱 would like to see the tesla plaid against those
That lambo is mind blowing
No Matt you didn't jump the start, it was a perfect start, i wish i was good as racing driver as you are
this video make my day significantly better today thanks a lot Matt
Need a 2004 V10 F1 car
Next race. This Raging bull vs the Rimac !!!!!!!!
Try and get a H2R for the next race. Cheers 🥂
Incredible to have Redbull RB7 starring!! ♥️
David: If the team is happy.I am happy.
What’s the 0-60mph time?
Ridiculous!
Man those road cars are freaking fast... I would have bet that the F1 car would be in an other league (acceleration wise), but apparently not...!😱😱
I think yall should have the same race but the whole runway and see
Donc this with a v10 f1 mowe powa baby,  insane video that what we want
I’ve just fu** off
Man I miss that type of F1 car and a sound too 😭
Id like to see a lotus 98T
Very impressive that Lambo 😱😱
😂😂👍insane!!
He is in the fastest lambo and still staying "come on come on"😂
I bet Yanni will be jealous of not being in the Lambo.
JM imports Are smashing records with there cars
8:23 no no nooo 🤦‍♂️ it’s not a Skyline
what was 0-60 on that lamborghini
awesome content
My mind is goin nuts imagining this lambo vs nevera race😵😵😵😵😵
62,5 M hahahhahahah useless F1 Car
That lambo was QUIK
KAREN HORNER calling F.I.A currently, Lamborghini without a rear bumper is in violation of FIA regulations. 😂 Mean while Mat sending Michael Masi an e-mail 📩 to checkout. 😂 (if you know you know)
That lambo holy f**k!!!
I’m pretty sure at this point that’s DC’s daily driver now.
8.9 seconds is godly fast dude 😂💔
Red Bull has Renault engine not Honda!
Gtr driver is staying behind intentionally and has no excitement to be part of the race!
W T F carwow toping everything with this video  the lamborghini and nissan are absolutly MENTAL  especially the lambo
Matt what is the fastest car you have driven? Do you think the twin turb lambo is any match for that rimac you drove?
Last place car does a 9.3?????? Holy crap lol.
You know the race is crazy when 9.3 seconds in a quarter mile is the last.
Let him yues the drs
That Lambo so sick!!!!!
Woaaaahhh that v8 f1🥵
Gtr is "stock" supercar killer 😂
All that missing was a Porsche 911
alright now its time for Rimac or any other Hypercar vs Lambo
So goes the saying "never race a lambo with no rear bumper"
I can imagine peole gonna say ye the GTR just did a 9 second run.9 Second is bloody quick regardless but that lambo's launch is insane.
Would love to see those same 3 cars doing a 200-0 race. Alternatively a roll race from 20-30 mph would really show off vehicle performance and reduce the AWD advantage of the Lambo and the GTR. Man that Huracan is a rocketship!
Wow F1 car is very quick.
Ever gonna do any motorcycle races ??
The question is which car can beat that huracan
There's an unwritten rule when you find a lambo with bumper off and a couple of turbos.  Don't even think to try
Now this was the most inclusive brake test
Where is the rimac Nevera ???😉😉😉
F1 vs Rimace nevera
Next: Bugatti vs McLaren Speedtail vs Jet
Carwow absolutely smashing it lately, awesome job
white striped hard compound slicks on a wet runway , there s just no grip mate
This is the craziest race I've see you do Matt. 8.9 secounds in a Lamborghini you guys just keep stepping it up 💥💥
The lambo is insane and the GTR is really fast too considering it looks like prettymuch a normal stock car
Who is Waiting for ricky's 1900hp gtr vs rimac nevera
Lambo definitely the winning in a straight line....put them on a track however and it Would be quite different!!!
Wait if stock GTRs with a nearly 600 horsepower are running 10.83 at the drag strip why is this this 1200 horsepower GTR running High nines
The GTR's suspension is flimsy . The dive and squat is highly noticable during launch and breaking
Love love
Simply absolutely AWESOME!!!
Pls drag race between Lamborghini Urus and Urus killer Porsche Cayenne turbo gt
DC if the team is happy I'm happy. 😁
2 missing points: 1. Yianni in The lambo  2. 2million kroatian  electic car  3. Obligatory Stock Porsche 911
we need that 1500hp supra soon😁 competeting
This Lamborghini vs rimac please!!
F1 sound 😍
That lambo was absolutely bonkers sub 9 second car and still puts the power down very well with all the mods. Insane
f1 are suposed to be fast arround corner I already knew that the redbull would get clap in a drag race
Just need one of those big-rig with compound turbo diesel setup to complete the variety of drag race
That F1 car braking it was tugged back forcefully xD
you will see the power of the lamborghini when it's tuned. definitely will smoke some tuner cars like the gtr. Also, if that F1 has v10 or v12 on it, it will definitely out smoke the two.
That Lambo should be competing with a F22 raptor damn..
Had lot of fun😍😍😝
If this was a race in like proper race not a drag race that red bull will smoke both if the car just saying lmao not hating the car I love all the gtr
Matt: That's just Nuts!!!      Love it 😍
Maybe next time try to get a porsche by 9ff. Very nice video
BEST VIDEO ON YOUTUBE
The lambo win the f1 car then can you please do as a bugati vs the 1200hp lambo😀👍🏻
Mats doing 220 mph with the tire pressure indicator on.....:)
Seb fans here??
HO LY SH IT !!!!!!
Wow, salute for the lambo's engineer
They should do the Rimac Nevera vs the Tuned Huracan
F1 vs Rimac Nevera, please Mat?🙏🙏🙏
Waiting for this RedBull F1 vs Hoonicorn🔥🔥🔥
Damn carowow moving mad
The lambo has at least 2000hp cmon..
Haha jump the start much Lambo 🤣
Amazing. Throw a Plaid S in there with the Lambo and F1.
Karen Horner is now on the phone to the FIA complaining his race car was beaten by a road car.
Put the Koenigsegg agera  against the f1 car👍
Best drag race ever.....Bravo carwow 👌👌
220 mph? oh god 😅
The last scene with walkies matt reminded me of clarkson 😂
AAMAAAAZZIIIING.
Show your Power Lamborghini Lovers 👇👇👇
I won't be surprised to see Mat racing jets with cars in few days
Perfect weather for a RWD 650 kilo car launch right
Lamborghini be like: Gas gas gas
9.2 for a 10 year old f1 very impressive not even a prep surface and not fully tune to race spec
Huracan 🥰
Oh my god is that lambo
in my opinion nothing will beat the sound of that f1 car
One of these days Matt is gonna start the video saying: Hey there I'm sitting in a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and I'm racing with a Lambo and a modified BMW M5 with 1800bhp and 2000nm of torque. Boom! 🚀
C'mon mat Get the 2020 F1 car
Now get that 2020 F1 car. Thet will smoke the Lambo.
Jeepers that Lambo is rapid!!!
That Lamborghini was just ...............
R34 vs Supra vs ?
Wonder how a Tesla Plaid would fair against these from a dig?
Lambo on 🔥
What the Fu...  The F1 car is Reign Supreme!  2:58 Sounds like a turd.
Just never trust a car that has turbos replacing its rear bumper
Epic race lots of fun to watch you crap yourself matt, hope you get one of the hybrid v6 f1 cars just to compare
Cheers to that lambo mate 💥💯💯
Unbelievable......
That Lamborghini has done terrible things to me 😂
not always u see a lambo compared to an f1. that brake test was insane
Bring the Remac Nevera in the mix
I think That f1 car can do a sub 9 quarter mile but that lambo is tuned to such am extremely level its unbelievable
That Lambo is nuts 🔩😲😲
GTR ❤
Lol when the slowest car still does an almost sub 9 sec run xD
Why spend 62M when u can pick a Lambo and make it a GREEN MONSTER !!!!!!
If the straight was long enough the  f1 and gtr would overtake the lambo
62.5 million wasted
man one of the best drag races good job...✌✌✌
So these cars are faster then bugatti Chiron hmm
Crazy to know that the Rimac Nevera would beat all of them
I miss the days when 10 seconds by the 911 turbo were considered the fastest 😌
1200hp Lamborghini vs Rimac Nevera
Lambo is the fastest car on carwow
Next try a car from 9ff!
Loved the drag race. Would like to see this in road course.
Hi
You know a cars Fast when it can beat a GT-R
2:42  Giving me DDE Vibes 💚⚪❤️
You should have kept a 1300 hp 911 and given it to Yanni
The sound of those V8 F1 engines is *pure* magic.
The myths true  don't Race a Lambo without a rear bumper  what would happen here if there was a civic with a laptop
And 2 jump starts
La cara de impresión del conductor del lamborghini... Y está persona está arto de coger coches potentes.
There must be a tuned Porsche 911 Turbo S out there... Need to add one of those to the mix!!
Race the lambo against Rimac please. I think the lambo will stand a good chance
Love the lambo
quicker than elon musk hahahaa
Wow! CarWow.. WOW!
@carwow Rimac Nevera vs Bugatti  Chiron Super Sport  vs F1  vs Kawasaki H2R? 😀
Lambo is unbelievable 😳, made F1 car look so slow.
I think the Lamborghini is the king of 1/4 mile 😎  fu*k electric cars kids  toy
https://youtu.be/mLUTB5TwM4o F1 vs Bugatti Chiron Bugatti Lost I think lambo is more powerfull than Chiron 😃😃😃Is it? https://youtu.be/YG_yoO76C7c
This is extraordinary Carwow!!! Keep up the good work. Cheers!!
no DRS? 😂
Imagine putting a 9.3 quarter mile and still coming last in the race
This is the content we want
So, a not fully tuned GTR that weights 4,000 lbs stood toe to toe with an F1 car?  Nice.  Woulda been better to have seen the GTR actually use launch control and go all out.
GTR is the heaviest one
That was the drag race I never thought I’d see WoW 😮 great video
This is Insane that Lambo 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
When you see a lambo with no rear bumper, you know it's going to be ridiculous.
Ha shat him self
Lambo trondol
Lambooo
Erm ok I didn’t expect that 😆😆
Call Fernando Alonso for a proper F1 start
You know what would be a really interesting race the rimac nevera vs the 1200hp lambo
Imagine ugr huricans vs rimac nivera
I wouldn't call adding twin turbos "tuned".
After achieving these levels of speed on cars the next thing for Carwow is to race fighter jets
Just bussin'
Mat, why won’t you show times of all runs?
The rimac still the fastest
😮
I couldn't understand😐. How did the bugatti chiron lost against that F1 car and this Lamborghini won?????
Lamborghini will be wheelie its shelf ( in hot day slick tire ) maybe 🤣🤣🤣
Just Insane drag race!
Epic race, lambo is nuts 🤯
As far as I remember, the fastest 1/4 mile time on this channel is 8.7s by the Rimac Nevera. That lambo is 8.9s, means that its the 2nd place for 1/4 mile on this channel. That's fast af
That Lambo is Satanic
Best video for a long time.
Now put them in a circuit and see what happens
Need this Lambo to VS Rimac Nevera
Yes
I love F1, Its really interesting to see the RB7 race these cars!
1200HP Huracan vs 1200HP 911 Turbo S
Yeah F1’s are meant to be going trough bends at speeds that the Lambo and GTR would be thrown into low orbit
Someone please confirm that F1 Car costs about £62 million
Twin turbo Huracan's ARE THE BOMB!!! Hard to beat the performance and sound
This race is just awesome
Where is "living life fast"1900hp GTR..
And to think a production Rimac is even quicker over the 1/4 lol
Green lambo vs Nevera
I am bit confused that chiron with 1500 hp was not able to beat f1 car but 1200 hp lambo could 🤨🤨
9:49 😁😆😂😂😂😂
When traction was taken out of the equation, the Lambo was still pulling on the F1 car, now that is one useable missile!
The guy driving the GTR is responsible for the lambo build
Amazing race…👌👌
Get the 2019 F1 car on softs🙏
Please see if you can get your hands on a Group C Le Mans car
dude we need this lambo against new Rimac Nevera !!!!
f1 sounds like an rc car
David : Team are happy I'm happy
Okay, i will say it! I envy you now! Thats insane! Keep up the good work!
Huracan vs rimac nevera vs tesla roadster (if it ever enters production!)
But can those beat a Porsche?
I thought dmo was the first one to have a twin turbo hurrican in the uk?🤔
You do most curious drag races on planet.
Lambo vs rimac
Wheres yannie
Jumping and jumping and jumping
This was awesome… should’ve brought the LLF gtr then see what’s the result. 😂😂
Porsche gt3 with 1300hp ❤️
amazing
That was MEGA!
this why lambo is the king , some say mclarens are fast , but, put the lambo two turbos and this is what you get .
OMG
Bro that Lamborghini is faster than my internet connection
WHY DONT’T YOU DRAG RACE A LOTUS F1 89T, that will obliterate anything
Just one emoji for that LAMBO !! - 😱
Oh my god the lambo 🔥🔥🔥🔥
All 3 are quicker than 2021 Haas
Next should be that lambo vs tesla plaid model
i know where i would want to sit when the first corner comes :)
7:14 the sound of that f1 car…
Please do a video on this same Huracan Vs Rimac C2.......
Those quarter mile times are insane!
Only a Punjabi (Buzzy Singh) can tune a super car to this insane level.🔥
If Hamilton was driving, he’d take out the lambo
Νο way the F1 car could beat that Lambo under any circumstance. From start or rolling the Lambo was kicking it's ass.
should be wearing a helmet with that kind of power
Now tune a McLaren senna and race it against the hurucan
0:20 - its like a hot woman without skirt
Next time Rimac Nevara vs F1 car
How was this video released at 3 am where I live and has almost 100k views before an hour.
Green monster
The more epic drag race in the world
1200 Hp Lambo vs Tesla Model S Plaid
priceless moment when you do a 9.3 on a quarter and come in last.
Wow
Ahhh I love this drag race
GtR need low carb diet...
Rimac nevera vs tuned huracan
Hi Matt. Can you do reviews of older cars? Like performance cars...? Thanks.
There was no Honda badging in Red bull in 2011 F1 car.. looks to me for of the recent ones
Now thats a drag race well done car WoW team
Twin turbo huracan vs rimac nevera please.
Need to run Rickys LLF Gtr vs Tesla Plaid
LOL the Tesla Plaid would fit in this race quite competitively...
The best channel on YouTube, great vid
I did not expect that!?!?!?
Let me tell you something about this Lamborghini,  - its not driven by yanni
This is insane content 🤯👌
We all want rimac nevara  vs tesla plaid . please
That Lambo is insane!
Fastest lambo yet and Matt drives it ! ?? Should of been yani all day every day 🤷‍♂️
Redbull : destroyed career of Chiron Lambo : Hold my beer buddy
i like the sound of the GTR because theres not a shit load of crackles like the lambo
Lambo 2x jump Start, F1 only 2 WD And now On the race track.. Bye Bye lambo 😅
Put the Rimac against the that lambo!!!
so a car , an F1 car .. against a space fucking ship?
Please get Ricky from LLF’s 1900hp GTR on for a drag race
We need a dragstrip with corners... AA, yeah - a race track! or half of it...
That lambo is likely sandbagging that 1200 figure
Rimac va lambo plz
Wow 🔥
David ‘if the team are happy I’m happy’ Coulthard
Should have brought the Tesla plaid in the game.
Did David just call the GTR a "skyline"🤭
3rd one is the perfect start
Brake test I would just slam on brakes so hard that I probably hit my head on the steering wheel & win everytime
Mat(Carwow) makes a video that will be a drag race of the Cadillac Escalade Platinum ESV 6.2 V8 vs BMW X7 M M50d vs Audi Q7 3.0 TDi Quattro Tiptronic 7L
Gtrs number plate on point.
That hurucan just fucks off
Bloody amazing, thanks CarWow, when are you launching in Australia, we need you?
The f1 brakes were like hitting a brick wall omgg
i wanna see that lambo v remac nevera
This lambo vs the new rimac...
Matt you jumped the race
Never mind hp. Just a number. What is the hp/kg at the wheels?
Now take all three cars to Silverstone, and have a ten lap race.
One way for Redbull to get free marketing to some extent, unless they paid carwow but it does not seem like they would have for a video like this.  Cost to get the F1 car there the team & driver so on, but carwow needs something crazy for content for their youtube channel.  Regardless of all that the video was good.
Mat isn't worthy enough for the Lamborghini. Put him in the GTR and Yanni in the Lambo. Great video though.
Lamborghini on fire no lag it just perfect car build
Why Don't you show nissan gtr drivers face? Thants not good at all
The f1 so loud that u cant hear the straight piped v10
Tesla model plaid vs This Lambo vs Rimac
Just when I thought your videos couldn't get crazier 🔥🔥🔥
How about this Lamborghini vs Rimac naver?
Lamborghini vs rimac
David everytime when Matt wants another go: if the team's happy I'm happy
F1 sound 😍😍😍😍😍😍
please what about Mercedes Benz Formula 1 car
Ok now this is a race 😉🔥
give rb some super softs or softs
This is the best one so far!
Best drag race i have ever seen
this fucking lamborghini is crazy!
i can't give more likes
Next drag is 1200HP Lamborghini vs Rimac Revera
Smoking a f1 car like wtf
Mate the redbull with no drs?😅
It would’ve taken an half an hour episode to make this on Top Gear
Outstanding👏👍🙏🤗wow
Feeling bad for f1 car 😭 lets race in a track
The RB7 is truly a workhorse.
I knew a tt v10 is one of the fastest craisiest builds on the world but i didnt expect it to beat a f1
POWER TO WEIGHT VS HORSEPOWER...
Wowww
We wanna see Tesla Plaid vs the F1 car.
“If the team are happy, I’m happy”- A wise man.
david coulthard?!!! wow!
This fucking lamborghini is crazy!!! FC.
Make it 2000 hp
V10 TWINTURBO
Never mess with a Lambo without rear bumper
WOW 😍
Wow the breaking power on F1 car is something that i never seen before
Next bmw m5cs please
Rimac Vs the lamborghini
That is not how the GTR performs.... If mat was in the GTR ... it will be the GTR
The most exciting race I have seen
Can we get a drag race between this Lamborghini and the Rimac?
I don't normally watch drag races but that was special. Proves if a road car can beat an F1 car, F1 has too many rules and restrictions
I love this ❤️❤️❤️❤️
the fastest green lambo ever and Yanni is not in it! It must feel like the ultimate betrayal
You guys need to do this Lamborghini with the Rimac nevera that would be an incredible race!
Bugatti Chiron vs THIS Lamborghini, You have to do this Mat.
I want to see Ferrari F2004 F1  Both on drag and lap race
New audi SQ7 VS old audi SQ7 drag race please!
Hell of a Lambo
Carwow is the best channel
7:14 Just look at the speed climb like hell. That is actually mental. It's like a car you'd build in Forza.
Rimac vs huracan TT
A frikin formula one!!!!! WTF!!!
Gone are the days of an F1 car being fast
Do a video with the  lambo and the rimac nevera
I would love to see the Tesla model S plaid vs the F1 car in a drag race
Let this 1200hp huracan vs a tesla plaid and a rimac navera 🙏🏻
fake drag race fake roll race fake brake test 💩💩💩💩
Thanks Guys was a great Pleasure to be invited on this event and have 2 of our JM built cars race and do well.. massive thanks to Buzz Rocky and Ucar for making this Happen no idea how the GTR got roped into this race but glad it did even on Stock Driveshafts we managed to stay safe..   big thanks to Carwow once Again and all the JM staff for making cars like this go Fast,.
Matt we can't wait for including in this kind of drag races the new plaid... pleeeaaase!!!
Costliest drag race
This is the best race I have ever watched
We need this Lamborghini race against that electric car nivera or whatever with 2000hp!!👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
U know if the video is good when Matt is starting to curse mid race 😂
Try more latest f1 car Turbo hybrid v6 ones
Oh Yianny is definetly wet through!
Wow that Lambo is insane!
The formula one is a different bread. Has nothing to do with the drag race. Top speed around 340km, no aerodynamics. Also had a c3 tyres (hard tyres) which are the slowest tyres in F1. If the tyres(100-110°c) and brakes(400-1000°c) are not in the optimum temperature, the braking test is pointless. There are faster formula cars that are worth racing. But definitely not a formula 1 car.
Upcoming videos by Matt-  this Lambo against Rimac  Rimac vs Buggati Rimac vs Tesla model S plaid Rimac vs F1 car
I love your videos, but what kinda stupid filming amd editing is this? Horrible angles, horrible transitioning between cars.
Lambo without bumper>any super car
Would love to see these 2 beast against the buggati
62mln my a$$
So the guy in the gtr was napping the whole video.🤦🏻‍♂️
now this is a drag race
Couldn’t click faster
lambo
1200 hp Huracan vs Chiron vs Rimac Nevera
That F1 is just screaming!
I'm happy bc I love tt huricans
opening DRS
Carwow has made me have so much experience and understanding of cars such that I predicted the race/test results correctly....
rimac vs that lambo I wonder who would win because in the rain lambo did quarter mile in 8.9.
I think the F1 Car has met its match!
Now i wanna see that Lambo, against the Nevera.
that F1 driver talks like Gerard from Jeremy Clarksons farm
Wowww 🔥
Red bull should’ve been on the softs
6M Almost, Let's go Carwow FAM. And besides, the video was cool 😎
Massive wheelspin from the F1 car
Do I have  a dejavu? I already heard that "I'm happy if the team is happy"
Yooooo dude pitch up this lambo and f1 car against the Rimac!!!!
Damn this lamborghini is really good for the environment with those turbos 😄
Imagine Yian in that lambo and Matt in the rimac nevera
Wtf was that lambos launch jesus
Lambo vs remac nevera again..
if only it was the fastest F1 car ever built, ( ofcourse i am talking about 2020 mercedes amg petronas f1 team F1 car) .
That F1 sound made me nostalgic lol, would love to see them back in the F1 but FIA doesn't want it sadly
Every single time you guys killed it damnnnnnn
Racing rules : 1. U don't race a supra with a intake in its headlights 2. U don't race a Lamborghini without a back bumper 3. Don't race A car with stustustuu
I want that lambo to race e and h2r cuz the h2r smoked the f1 car
LOVE IT GOOD RACE
You should do rimac vs lamborghini
Were is the video on the m5cs
The lambo would smash the Rimac Nevera if it had 100 more HP
Please make some old school drag race videos such as the W140 1998 Mercedes S600 Vs Bentley Arnage or like the W124 Mercedes 500E vs Bmw m5 from the 90's era
matts on like X 15
Yes buzz your car sounds even better than before beating f 1 cars lololol 😆😜🤣😄
TÜRKİYE DEN SELAMLAR 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
How about the tuned lambo vs the chiron ?
Hennessey Venom GT would beat that slow Lambo with finger in nose
Why david didn't use DRS  or KRS?
Carwow why you use f1 car from 2012 or 2013. You should use f1 car from 2018 or 2019
The good old "No replacement for displacement"?
I would like to see the huracan vs nevera
Take the heavy artillery! Put the Rimac Nevera race against that Lamborghini!!
MORE MORE MORE!!!!!!!!!
Great vid as always that lambo Sounds insane
I’d like to see this Lamborghini against the Rimac and Audi RS e tron GT
Please do a bugati drag race 😍
Man they always do some insane races
Rimac 2,000hp vs Lamborghini 1,200hp thumps  up, wanna see it
Nah nah nah that lambo is so fast
Lamborghini vs Rimac next
F1 car is my least favourite sound. Sounds like a bloody mosquito lol
never mess with a Lamborghini without a rear bumper
In any this kind of level race the missing part it's a Porsche Turbo!
Can't wait for a TT SVJ!
The lambo looks epic from the back
Next can you do a race and review with Lamborghini huracan sto?
I love that DC called the GTR the Skyline.
Combo Of Matt jumping thefirst two starts and I imagine lack of temp in the F1 tyres (you could hear it scrabbling for grip) meant the first two races were bigger gaps. That lambo is insane though
Interesting results indeed, next time add a couple of corners and it's a different story.
Nissan vs Lamborghini vs Hon…da?
The lambo is faster than a Chiron
Matt and yanni running already
Man that GTR was disappointing.
Incredible 🔥
Where is Yanni? He should have driven that Lambo
An F1 car in a drag race ! Amazing 😍 love your channel 😉
So nice all cars made tesla plaid times 🤣👏
Bet the Lambo is nice and economical 🤣🤣🤣🤣
You know it's crazy when the slowest car is 9.3 seconds
what engine mode was te red bull running?. i dont think a quali. probably a demo far lower than the race period.
tt lambos will smash ANY car.... ANY...
Wow, apparently F1 have been using wrong cars for their races. They need Lambos and GTRs.
In Lambo do 0-60pls it's getting fun.
This time, the Lamborghini, it just fucked off
Buggati - i got 1000+ hrprs GTR - hehehe Supra - hold my tea  😂😂😂
62 million for the car? So the team didn't need to pay the staff, travel, RND, marketing etc etc?
How can they put Honda on this f1 car ????
That's difference in braking will be a MINUTES at the track!
gtr be like jus 2 turbo more i will win
Bugatti Chiron vs Lamborghini huracan
Mat bring the bloody Ford GT pleaseeee 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Amazing！
If they are able to get a new generation of F1 car…
f1 sounds SCREW DRIVER MOTOR
Can you do a video with every single Tesla in (maybe not roadster
This car won against Bugatti yet lost against lembo how is that even possible ☹️
Give that RedBull soft tyres man so dc could get the traction that He needs
OMG that Lamborghini 😱😱
Why the hell didn't lambo adopted turbos in their cars (not the usrus)...they could be even faster in stock....
4:20 That gtr started way to late
Wow
The hair all over my body is standing on end👌🏻 Your most exciting video yet 👍🏻 Try get something to beat that lambo please 😃
That Lambo has way more then 1200hp
Formel 1 sound ❤
Tuned Huracan against Rimac??
Been waiting for this vid for ages! Even though we know what happens😁
Очень жаль что на Ламбе не Яни.
Would be  nice to see these beasts on track with the f1 car
Gtr❤️❤️❤️
First 2 times you jump stared but the 3rd time was fair
Crazy race🙏🙏🙏
Day 3 of asking for Audi S1 vs GR Yaris... Please
Wow... I'm impressed you guys got a real, late model F1 car to DRAG RACE with🤣😂 Nutz!  (😳 HOLY SHIT! It's David Coulthard!! DAY-UMM)
I’m guessing this was on the same day with the Chiron.
Fuck me sidewards that lamborghini was aaabsolutely phenomenal!!! Jesus!
Mercedes after a season : Carefully preserves their cars in a museum.  Red Bull after a season : **hehe new toy**
Rimac never a vs f1 vs lambo 1200hp vs Chiron  Who is waiting for this race ?
You do NOT see Mat looked scared often! Jez, that Lambo
We need that lambo against the Nevera!
That lamboooo just roasted them..,🔥🔥🔥 Yianni laughs frm distance... 😂
This vid is obv going viral. So hi youtube!! (Commented on 58k views)
That F1 engine is built by honda 🤟🏻
Who wants a drag race between the lambo and the rimac ?
Race that lambo with the rimac pls
Mat watson taking Carwow to a another level🔝🔝🔝
No no no no no no no no no no you're not doing this
I'm estimating that Lambo is at 1200whp not crank, because that 1/4 time is ridiculous.
Once a wise man said -  "Lambo all day. Everyday."
F1 vs GTR 2000hp+ PLEASE 🔥🔥🔥
Damnn Carwow is giving us one of a kind content 🔥🔥 .
You know the car Mat is sitting in is fast because he hates loosing and always goes for the fastest car.
This Lambo vs Rimac?😁
MATT WATSON  DOING LAUNCH FACE...PLEASE...
versus MotoGP next?
Best drag ever
Just imagine the Lambo against the Nevera. and also put a chiron in there
The Lambo is the right car for Yanni. Lamborghini one day, Lamborghini everyday as Yanni says 😊 #yannimize
Now we need to add the Chiron to the race and things'll get spicy!!
And the germans Beat everyone again. VW owns Lamborghini and that‘s why Lamborghini is practically german
Holy fucking hell...that f1 car got smoked!..!!
Lambo 😎
That’s got to be the best race of 2021…
Fiat panda 1000hp vs Tesla model X plaid
Lamborghini Perfomante is so cool!!!!
This is one of those videos that you just like before it even starts! Just wow! 👌🏼Carwow!
You didn't even need to do the brake test to know what will happen
That lambo sounds nuts but that f1 car made my eyes water wow holy crap loool
3:28
should try that whit a nascar or any gt racing car, or heck a rally car, F1 car is more or less made for taking curves fast than a in a strait line, even they are fast there also
Formula 1 one car vs the rimac nevera vs the lambo 1200hp
The lambo just fucked off to mars
Remac nevera : ha..! Soo cute
This lambo vs tesla , please 🙏
I think this green hurricane has some jet engine swap. 😃😄
They need to do the rolling race on a public road with with F1 car, it would be absolutely hilarious 😂
Buggati chiron vs 1200 hp huracan
Need Rickie’s LLF GTR here
Lamborghini Huracan with $150.000? Seems even a bit cheap
5:53 This gotta be a meme template!
Man that F1 car sounds horrible. I used to watch F1 as a kid and I've always disliked how they sounded
Just wait until LLF Ricky's GTR is on here!
If it were on a track, the f1 car would've smoked the huracan
Drag big money..  Next ,, lambho 1200 ps vs  bugatti chiron ..
Is this the first time the none of tuned cars broke down?
Rimac Nevera stays unbeaten 😎😁😁
Please get Lewis Hamilton next time kkkkkkk
Best channel of this era.
Please do this lambo vs rimac nevera
Can Mat try a drag race between the lambo and rimac nevera? I would really like to see how it will go down.
Who is here before 1 million views :D ?
What if they used soft tyres🤔
U know mat has upped his game when the car coming last has a quarter-mile time of 9.3s
Why do you hide the Rimac out of the races !!!!👀
I sure lambo is more than 1200 hp.
2021 Red bull F1 is noticeably faster off the line and in gear so would win.
The race we didn’t know we wanted
Now we wait for the Lambo Vs The M5
Dom Torreto vs Matt in that Huracan
The best drag race
That lambo vs 2 seconds of throttle from a top fuel dragster
8.9 seconds? Incredible
I love lamborghini 😍😍
Yo crazy mat😍😍
Lambho without rear bumper is something else. Be aware when you see them on the road 🤐
Fantastic Race!
I'm sure Ricky from Llf in the GTR would kill that Lamborghini. But very impressive 👌👌👌🤙💯💯
It’s 4 in the morning….
Lol Matt jumped the start twice😄
F1 videos are so cool <3
Day 1 of asking Rimac Nevera vs F1 car
so much horsepower so little time
Weeeeewww!!
that lambo is quiiiiiick
RedBulls aren't known for their straight line speed but more for their corner speeds XD
That Lambo flying
Just say the stopping distance.... Please 🙏 please 🙏 please 🙏
JM-imports 👑
I was not expecting that from the Lamborghini at all dang the tune
Now we know we Need a lambo  that can destroy every hypercar on earth.
Cool race, the Lambo is just insane....thanks for all the effort.  Now try again with a F1 car less than 4 years old.
Wow that was amazing🔥🔥
Great video, that lamborghini 🔥🔥🔥 is the fast car i ever see in carvow afterr rimac , maybe a race , this lambo vs rimac !!
You should get Kawasaki Ninja H2R to race a long side with you.
You found an F1 car. Then you found cars that could beat it. Insane🔥🔥🔥🔥
Pleaseeeeeeeee add the rimac to this race... 🙏🙏🙏
Nyooooom
pls do the drag race between rimac nevera and this incredeble huracan
Top fuel dragster next 😎
Rimac vs f1 car?
Now I want this lambo vs Rimac.
that a punjabi lambo! baby
and also nice job at the huracan, its nuts!
не честный драг был !!!!! мокро для F1 было!!! по сухому уделала бы F1 ламбу!
Damn Matt u did Yanni wrong 🤣 He supposed to be driving the Lambo 😂
Well well well...That's Lamborghini for you!!!
The ultimate race. That lambo vs Tesla Plaid
What else will Mat get next episode, Dominic Toretto's Charger is my guess
This Lambo Vs Nevera? It would be interesting
Bugatti loose vut lamborghini WIN  ?  Je ne compren pas
Love these videos
wow!! those are some serios cars - under 10 seconds drag race. Not to mention that the F1 car is 10 years old and it copes with  these incredible tuned cars.
how about a tuned supra mk4?
Now it’s time to race a 1000hp supra vs those cars😈😈😈
Mat you LEGEND! The best thing from brum since ozzy osbourne 🤣😂
Mat(Carwow) makes a video that will be a drag race of the Ferrari SF90 Stradale vs Rimac Nevera vs F1 car
Hey Mat, could you do a race with two of these cars or atleast one,  bmw g30 540i xdrive, bmw g30 m550i against anything matching their performance? Big Thanks! 🙏
Do made stuff with Jm imports!
I think the F1 car is not trying.
Wheres the rimac
Those cars are nuts
Ok, so... "Help me carwow" - I want that F1 at a fair price.
Hey guys CARWOW HAS DONE IT AGAIN !!!!!!!
So during the drag race , I guess  Matt was pulling more 'G's than an F1 car ?
Holy hell...... this channel is frickin insane
hey matt, The Lambo Huracan is Supercharged or OVER POWERED i think that's enough beacause your way to far on them
How many gears do those F1 cars have? Dang
They should’ve brought DMO’s twin turbo Performante and Ricky’s new GTR
F1 number one
Yanni would be proud of the Lambo 😁
You jumped the start on the first 2 runs, Matt.
wooow
Just imagine the slowest quarter mile was 9.3 secs. Being a lambo fan boi that got me jumping
Rickys from LLF GT-R vs the Rimac Nevera🔥🔥
that lambo has more power than 1200 hp
I think that lambo can beat the rimac nevera with 1,500hp
That car costs almost 64 MILLION and it's very shameful seeing that Lamborghini which costs 150k absolutely railing that car it's very shameful
After this F1 petronas merc vs f1 honda redbull vs f1 ferrari
I knew the lambo was gonna win when I saw it
Yianni should have been driving this Huracan  just to hear “ Lambo all day every day
No way 62 mil??
Try and take the rimac nevara up against the f1 car!
This will blow up
OMG that lambo!🔥🔥🔥
Holy SHIT THAT HURACAN !!!🥵🥵🥵🥵
Now we want this tuned Lambo vs nevera!!
Now race it around corners...
Ok but where's the Bugatti vs rimac nevera vs model s plaid vs f1 car
yes officer the car is stock
Let’s see the three of them do a lap…
the f1 sound like an annoying masqito
Imagine having the clout to cameo David Coulthard
Holy shit so nutss
Foookin’ shiieet.. that was insane Man!
Dream come true, ,tuner vs F1 💞
What a video
He told us to be ready many exciting races are coming up and by this video he has made justice
kind of sad the F1 car didnt win but wow that lambo!
I didn’t think the F1 car would lose. Best drag race ever
That f1 car does not cost 62 million.😂 Red bull had a budget of 245 million in 2011 f1 season for all its operations. Salaries, logistics, R&D, ect. The car cost around 5 million to make. 😐🙄
I feel like the Formula One car with a underestimate due to its performance as the driver has mentioned it's a lot to do with the traction and how quick you start off on the launch the cars were all wheel drive and a better power ratio for what it is the Formula 1 car is a rear wheel drive of course it's going to struggle to get grip on a launch like that but overall it was one-of-a-kind race
Please! Drag race: Rimac 2000 h.p vs Lamborghini 1200 h.p 🔥🔥🔥
I wish you can have a koenigsegg to race
Fair play def sold a 1200hp turbo kit for every lambo owner with this
woooow lambooo crazyyy car
How did they got that F1 car?
First of all its a Lamborghini and its hurricane and its tuned and most importantly it is driven by mat watson …..i bet you guys you didn’t heard of any deadliest combination than this🤯🤯
Mat please bring Motogp VS F1
Bro is talking about all the horsepower but I’m thinking. Come on now it’s an F1. What are the chances? Then that huracan starts flying. I’m speechless
Carwow should now become a TV show
Redbull car and honda helmet:)))
the lambo is just 3 miliseconds away to beat that Rimac Nevera
lambo driver now being smug and telling every one that my car is faster than an F1 car
Bring in the Rimac as well
Wasn't a huge Lamborghini fan until this one🥵🥵
That V8 symphony 🎵
fantastic race
You guys are brilliant, I've never come across another channel that has so much variety in their drag races. Always up the ante. Thanks Matt!!
Rimac v the lambo next please!
This lambo vs rimac
Time to upgrade to the 1000hp f1 car
After this Yanni should turbo charge his Aventador to 1500hp 😂😂
What's that blue speck in my mirror? Oh it's a Formula 1 car.
Great! Now go around a corner
Insane! Wow
Hi @Buzz
What's the breakdown of 63 million for that formula 1  car?  Does it have a 24 kg gold engine?  They told you lies matt 😆
That lambo was nuts😳
62 million quid and be smashed by a 250k lambo :))))
The lambo is NUUUTTTTS.... But surely the F1 car is detuned it would still beat 99% of road car's.
I WAS TOTALLY not EXPECTING THAT AT ALL
More racing with Redbull LET'S GO 🔥🔥🔥
Still love the nissan regardless
Three races,  three f**king time you jumped,  Mat.
Just your casual upload at 3:35am .. 😂
man that V8 sound is unbelievable....
I REALLYYY wanted that F1 car to use DRS and ERS
I miss V8 F1 enggine so much
Nevera vs. Red Bull?
A wise man once said : "Never race a lambo without rear bumber"
that lambo vs nevera would be cool
Tesla model s VS Bugatti Veyron 16.4
If the team are happy I'm happy😅
Do they keep updating their current F1 sponsors with older cars? That Red Bull had no business with Tezos when it came out?
That was insane, great video!
cool lambo
A pointless race but this is exactly what I want to see on YouTube. Great channel
Here we go again.. another BRILLIANT DRAG RACE :D
That lambo insane omg
8.9 sec to the quarter... 😲
That lambo looks like ripped by alien...
So glad to see JM imports getting in on the carwow action, Jurgen and the team do amazing work 👍
Is the lambo 0.3s behind Rimac Nevera?
Rimac Revera vs. F1 plz
Ohhhh damnnn God  I miss YAINNE in this race so so so much
How about Rimac vs 1200 hp Lamborghini vs 1300 hp GT-R vs another F1
Now you have to get the Hoonicorn on the show
Wow 😯

tuned cars 👍 tunes cars over 1000 hp 👍👍 reliable tuned cars over 1000hp 👍👍👍
What a race!!!
The sound of the F1 car is just amazing. Miss everytime I hear. The main thing missing from F1 today. The fact that the Lambo destroyed both cars is just impressive.
Put that lambo against the rimac
Honda logo on F1
Do a the exact race once again, But this time with the Bugatti Chiron instead of the F1 car
Why I’m really really excited with matt😂😂 This lambo is monster
Mat(Carwow) makes a video that will be a drag race of Volkswagen Polo 2.0 TSi R WRC vs Volkswagen Golf 2.0 TSI GTI Clubsport DSG vs Volkswagen Scirocco 2.0 TSi R DSG
Crazy video with insane car
That Lamborghini just restored the glory of the gas engine, nuts just nuts. Gas forever ❤️
We want cleetus McFarland
F 1 should do 100-200 in 2 sec . This one in like 3
We would like to see this lambo vs the  Rimac 😍😍😍 0.3 sec difference in different races. It all goes to reaction time. The race would be epic. Yainne in lambo vs Mat in Rimac
F1 vs bucati  and superbike.. Good race...
We need to see a twin turbo Lamborghini Aventador that would be so dope
Get 911 too ❤️
This is the craziest YouTube channel!

Brilliant!
That lambo just take off what an insane power 🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯 always a Lamborghini fan ❤️
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I was expecting max in the F1 car
Bring in the tuned Porsche 911 brought in few races earlier and let’s see if the results differ
I would like to see the first corner . Hahaha   things would change.
WOWWW
How about you race police cars against each other? That would be a good video. Let’s see which cars we have a chance of blowing out during chase haha
This video just proves how patetic F1 have become, ridiculous! :((((
Lambo all day everyday
Imagine driving a car on the street that's faster than an F1 car
If yennie was their he will absolutely lose from him 🤪😂😂😂
I do 14 hour shifts and your videos are the only thing I look forward to. Thank you so much buddy. Also I bought my 2021 car from Carwow because of you.
Please .. This Lambo vs Rimac .. lets see who will take the carwow Taj 👑

To all the Tesla plaid fanboys........ Se ya you bunch of 🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔🥔😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
Wanna see a rimmac vs rickys gtr from LLF
Mat doing 360km/h now. Why do I reckon that in 5 years he’s gonna do like 500km/h on that track and gonna strike a bird?
this is sick
What are you waiting for?? LINE UP THE CHIRON AGAINST THAT SICK LAMBO
Twin Turbo Lambo VS Rimac
if yanni seeing this he would be so proud😂😂😂
That huracan was insane..
Holy cow that brake modulation from david Coulthard is amazing, no lock ups
That F1 car sounds insane!!! The future generations will definitely miss this drama!!!
That Lambo though.... INSANE!
Wow the traction and power of that Lambo is amazing. It is very impressive for the tuned cars to perform this well consistently. Normally tuned cars struggle to put the power down but these cars really performed wonderfully.
Man I still Can't get over the fact as to why f1 cars are THAT expensive. I mean sure it got hell lotta carbon fibre and engineering in it, but 62.5 MILLION?!??
That Lamborghini is ridiculous 😂😂
This Lamborghini vs rimac nevera..... Rimac did 8.6 quatermile if remember
We want to see F1 vs Rimac Nevera
Where is Tesla Plaid?
Damn that lambo is fastttt 😵
Do you can race the New m5 cs against the m5 comp and m8 comp
Epic race   So now we know how the plaid model S is going to go as well, it in very real terms of acceleration is a formula one car
why is the gtr looking so slow my god its a 1300hp car for f's ake
... Why dosent the Red bull use DRS?
Dude if u attach wings on that Lambo it would literally fly wtf 😂😭
UNXECPTED fock my english
Why dont the f1 car use the drs??
Crazy fucking race 🏁
2021 when a road car driven by a brummy whoops a F1 car driven by DC and the loosing road car does a 9 sec 1/4 mile! AMAZING!
Mat(Carwow) makes a video that will be a drag race of Lykan Hypersport vs F1 car
Amazing 💚
Best F1 vs Rimac Will be nice to see
Love to se these races with modded cars!
Amazing🔥
That R8 was awesome!!
This Lamborghini vs rimac nevera.....
3:17 same clip from the Chiron video lol
Holy Jesus that Lambo is absolutely mental… speechless
7:27 awesome
that bugatti driver was slow
do a race between bugatti chiron super sport 300pls vs lambo hurican tuned please
What in the world....?!?!?
Even under 10 second GTR and F1 seems slow front of this lambo.  This car is mental 😅 Yanni will be happy to see this
At least those  masterpieces are fast enough to beat the chiron😂😂
After this video yianni's gonna say " I'm feeling so proud for being an Lamborghini owner"...
Imagine coming last with a time of 9.3 seconds, fkn hell 😂
That lambo is fu***ing nuts
Evolve after seeing this alright bring the M5 to the shop order bigger turbos slap that thing on the dyno and i don't want it off it until the dam thing reads 1500 horses
That ugr got awd. No wonder
Bro i need that fucking 1200hp Lamborghini WOW
We need DMO on Carwow
How about the Rimac Nevera vs this lamborghini😁
That Lambo 🥵🥵🔥🔥
Where is the rimac? Oh wait. The rimac only compete against 750 hp cars according to carwow
Can you try racing a 2020 or 2021 f1 car?
Lamborghini is fucking quick 💣💣💣💣💣
Mat faces is killing me🤣🤣🤣. He really enjoy with this lambo.
Pay in mind that the F1 car is from 2011 , just imagine a 2021 model 😳
when will we get a plaid model s vs a formula 1?
Wow That Lambo is Fast afk, it should drag race with Rimac Nevera....
The Lambo was pulling away from the Red Bull.
9:33 just like conversation at Sepang circuit
Impressive that Lambo, just wondering how will do vs Rimac as the power is way less then that electric Rimac and did almost same 1/4 mile time  as Mat managed to do at his best  hmmm...
Thats what I call - entertainment -
It's sad though that you've put again some clips from the previous video with the Bugatti.
We need more of this!
I know i know, it's just drag race.
Rimac Nevera vs F1 is all we need.
Yianni must be proud
Plss do the king of carwow...drag race the faster car in carwow video
jesus christ that lambo . lambo vs rimac nevera would be a good race
Remac vs Lambo vs Tesla Roadster
Ask redbull to bring out the MotoGP bike
That Lambo omg😭😭😭
It just gets better, wow

Matt's personality is the best
I can feel that how you are feeling when g force pushed you back in the seats
Well that was unexpected
You have to race the huracan and the chiron
Matt what about you race the Lamborghini vs the chiron???
Matt I am asking this for 5th time do a review of yanni’s lambo ploxx
Those videos you just like even before watching!!!
When will living life fast come there with his GTR ???!!!!

Top fuel dragster   F  1 is not. For 1/4 mile .
Race to the full mile would have been ultimate 😭
Mat(Carwow) makes a video that will be a drag race of the Mercedes-Benz GLA 45 AMG 4-Matic vs BMW M2 CS Auto
Next video should be this lambo vs Bugatti vs formula car
that huracan put the most glorious performance i've ever seen in a drag race.... utterly blown away
Yani: Lambo all day any day
That Lambo is a ballistic missile and it's not too far behind the Rimac (8.6) which has got 700+ extra hp and roughly twice the torque (and 700 extra kg to be fair).
God bless Lamborghini and Matt
Where is bmw M5 CS car wow?
Красавчик Lamborghini 👍🛸
f1 vs the rimac nevera pls
Crap... Flipping Hell 🤣
This is the reason we watch carwow They just never disappoint there viewers.
You need to bring the rimac back now
A bit of a booboo with the F1's 7 speed *automatic* gearbox
Like before 100k views🔥
Yani would be so proud😂
I want to see a half Mile only Plaid race vs some good cars SF90/ 765LT.. the Plaids speed is 162 over the half mile that I know already
This is going to get a lot of views
Lambourn vs rimac please with yanni in the lambo of course
That was awesome..one of the best drag race  ever
Mate give the RB Monza spec aero. It's gonna be much faster
Italian cars are better in stock
How do you get subscribers ?
I love lamborghini
A bumper less lambo ......death
This drag race was awesome
I fu***d off                            ~Matthew Watson
Laemborghini alllllll dayyyy everyyy dayyyy
How do you beat the best sounding engine of all time?  Bolt on two turbos.
Carwow is the best in these drag races. I just love it!
Mental. Kudos!!!!
Can you do a monster truck race
So that bugatti is just overpriced shit in front of these cars
Pfft that lambo is a death trap on wheels 😂😂
F1 sound: opera. Also it stopped in like 10 meters 😁
That Lamborghini impressed
GTR vs M4 Comp vs E63s
Please race tuned supra and AWD tuned civic (laptop) with these monsters.
That Lambo would give the Rimac a serious run for it's money
Porsche 919 please!!!
godzilla held its own tho even with no wins
RIMAC NEVERA VS BUGATTI CHIRON!!! Please watch this drag race CARWOW
Lol now take it to a track and watch both cars get lapped 5 times with the F1 car
Dude that lamboooo💚💚
Süper video
You did jump start twice lol and F1 isnt designed for 1/4 mile and its 12 years old. However another great race and content
Pls do the tuned lambo for quarter mile time and half mile and 1 mile
red bull already pissed with LH, now with carwow lol jk..
crazy to think the Tesla Plaid is running these numbers stock
Jdms are shit 🤣🤣
Mat(Carwow) makes a video that will be a drag race of the Porsche Taycan CT Turbo vs Porsche Panamera Sport Turismo Turbo S E-Hybrid
yanni would be so proud of you matt.
Not a tuned formula 1 car?
Carwow is dominating YouTube
All of a sudden this channel is a sub 10s arena
Close braking test😅😅
All that money 9nnthat lambo and he can't even afford a new rear bumper.....what a let down 😏
Wtf the Huracan!!!! 😳😳😳🤯🤯🤯  Crazy fast!
MATT there's a new YouTube channel using your formula for drag races😂. Just be aware of this
The Lambo just smashed everyone.  I'm telling you if anyone puts the turbos to the Lambo's stock engine the power would be insane coz they build insane freakin.. rev band engines. That's why Lambo all day every day🔥🔥
That Lambo is nuts, although one of the old V10 F1 cars with over 1000bhp would have been interesting....!
Le: Bugatti Chiron driver 🥺🥺
The start on the lamborghini  is insane  as hell and it so beautiful   Imagine  lamborghini  let go of naturally  aspirated engine  to turbos cars Imagine  the thing they can do  Still the sound of the naturally  aspirated  v12 and v10 sounds better
Wasn't expecting that!
Mat(Carwow) makes a video that will be a drag race of Nissan GT-R 3.8 V6 Black Edition vs Jaguar F-Type 5.0 V8 S/C R vs BMW M5 Competition Xdrive
That huracan's just insane.
미쳤다
This really is the best channel on YouTube. 👏🏽
Yes part 2 for the f1 drag race in carwow 😃😃😃🙌🙌🙌🏎🏎🏎
Oh my gosh very interested today i never enjoy like today
I waiting for another race with the F1 car
Surprised by that result, I thought the F1 car would absolutely destroy them
BUGGATI DIVO and LAMBORGINI aventador
What a race I wish I can sit In a Lamborghini in my birthday in two days
Matt’s reaction time is insane
That TT Lambo delivered every single time, gosh
Lamborghini POWERFUL V10 + TWILTURBO HIPERFAST!
One of d big races frm carwow ❣🥰👍
Even though the gtr lost the drag it is still bloody fast
A more normal race between the new Golf R and the new TTS would be great both 320 hp same engine but diffrent cars. As 3rd car the Cupra Formentor with 390 hp because its bigger and heavyer. Would be interesting.
We need this lambo vs rimac 👇
put that lambo with the rimac it's bloody quick!
#MatDrivesTheF1Car
Really very awsome race...i love it really love it...keep going CarWow...
So what happened Matt in the fasted car so you know who going to win. Matt jumps the start  Although no more radio starts so that a fair race now.
Red bull need to bring a newer car now
If only the F1 deployed it's DRS.
And now this lambo and gtr against a moto gp bike,would be close.
The lamb is a beast😈😈😈
That brake test hella impressive
This is absolutely joy to watch
The lambo issa real monster👹
That Lamborghini will smoke anyone in its way. Period!
What David was thinking during the race: GP2 Engine... GP2
We want yianni to ride the same lambo come on Matt u can work this out ❣️❣️
Went from "let's see if we can break the 10s mark" to breaking the 9s mark. Insane!
Ouuuu Yes F1 car, thank you Mat for making videos 👍🙏
So formula 1 cars are overrated 😂
Holy moly that was a dragrace like no other! So fun to watch!
Yay a F1 carrr ; Noooo
Been wowed
thats gotta be one of the best sounding race ever
please koeingsegg vs F1
Hopefully I end having the money to do that huracan build
That lambo is absolutely killer, so insane
Best drag race ever 🔥🔥
whats up with uk's gtrs
seeing as the F1 did the 1/4 mile in 9.2 seconds, I suggest you do Model S plaid vs the F1 car. They have similar drag times (of course when it's available)
lambo without yanni 😢😢
One question where is Yannie ..
You have to put a tuned Kawasaki ninja h2 in one of these races or even an h2r, I’m begging you I would love to see that happen!
I can't believe Mat actually won an F1 car omg it's unbelievable and the facial expressions it means that Lamborghini is bloody quick
Red Bull's 2021 car would obliterate everyone here
We need LLF’s gtr vs that lambo
forza horizon 4 tuning be like:
This is the reason why we love RedBull
Never clicked this fast on a carwow drag race video notification
Next thing we seeing a boeing 747 vs an airbus a380
My eye's got wide opened, in disbelief when I saw who's racing who!!!!
where yanni tho
Rimac vs f1 please
I hit the 👍button before I watched the video.
I'll say this though, round any track that F1 car would just obliterate those other cars including the Lambo.
I would really love it if the F1 car would have a Monza-spec wing, DRS and KERS. The races would've been much closer.
So what is redbull gonna whine and complain this time? The Lamborghini running on a drier line? Or are they blaming Hamilton for the lost?
It means you can but a €150,000 car and beat a Chiron and F1 car🧐
When have you not seen even a slightly tuned GTR
INSANE X 3 👍🏼
That Huracan fckin smashing F1 cars after tuning boiii!!!😲
Really unexpected win 😂
What about formula 1 2021?
This Lambo is fu*king insane!!!
Lamborghini Hurricane sounds the best
My only thought to this was: Holy shit...
Amazing race's thes month along side the chiron and F1 to 👍
Lambo almost able to beat Rimac Nevera while having 800ish HP disadvantage +rep
Car wow are now the kings of drag races!!
The day is not too far.. When we get to see V8, V10, hybrid V6 drag race here. 👍
Wow the lambo was very very fast
Next video: Porsche 918 Spyder vs Porsche 911 Turbo S
That Lamborghini is Mental
Bloody hell. The braking power on the F1 made it look like it hit a brick wall.
220mph!!!
Next week: *F1 Car, Kawasaki H2R, MotoGP Bike.*
Fun fact: the dislikes are from Greenpeace morons
These races are getting crazier and crazier
Great race but I think it’s safe to say that there is no car in the world that would beat an F1 car if stock
At least you bring big smile to yianni and lambo fans! This is heavyweights drag race. Half miles should be isn’t?
That's what no bumper on a lambo gets you😂😂
This as the be one of my favorite carwow video
650 Kg, including the driver 😮
The best drag race ever on carwow ❤️❤️❤️❤️👌👏
Lambo Boys are finally happy
Mat when will you drive F1 car?????????
Omg what the race, between 3 legends. 🔥🔥🔥
how about that lambo vs Nevera
carwow keep finding ways to outdo themselves!
Go round a ring and then we will know who will win
This drag race is...  1:38
Then this Lamborghini is faster than the Bughatti in a drag race sheeeeeshhhhhhh 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I feel blessing can see this video, it's amazing
That lambo I thought the f1 was faster
can you do that gtr vs a tuned supra?
OMG lambo
Next drag race: 1200hp Lambo vs RIMAC NEVERA
Lambo without rear bumper is dangerous😬
One of the best videos in carwow
Imagine a stock lambo with this performance.
the 1,600 hp GTR vs This Lambo ?
Rimac Nevera vs Twin turbo Huracan vs formula 1 car vs Konessieg Regera
That Lambo is a different animal 🤯
You can tell when Mat is excited🤣🤣"you want another go?"
The fact that the lambo is faster than the f1 car is insane
What is going on at CARWOW 😂
Good job to the guys that tuned that Lambo
Daaaamn them lambos are quiick
That GT-R is either tuned shit or the driver sucks or maybe both
Think CarWow's CEO should give the CarWow's YouTube team a pay rise 😳
Nice race
Bro that gtr's a sleeper 1300 hp and looks like a stock gtr with some aftermarket rims and just some enhancements to look better but makes more power that a 1.5 mil veyron 😂😭
What if the f1 car had 1300 turbo engine without speed limiter?.
v10 vs v8 vs v6 f1 car
Mat in 2022: Now we'll do a brake test from 200mph.
That third drag race was perfect as all car went together, but that Lambo just obliterated everyone! It's nuts!
220 mph! That's probably the highest top speed Matt has ever experienced in a car.
R35 disappointed
The craziest drag race ever
F1 sound just fuckin amazing 🔥
race that Lambo against a Tesla Plaid!
Awesome race 🏁 We need a Rimac vs Tesla plaid vs Bugatti Chiron next please Mat. Might as well chuck in a Ferrari.
The Lambo definitely has more than 1300hp and geez what a stop from the F1 car
Gtr is my favorite car
This race just give me seizures
That lambo is a beast
いやGT-Rの9.3秒も十分すぎるくらい速いんだが笑
still waiting for rimac vs rb7
Bring a Civic with laptop to go against this Lambo in the next video
I saw this and my heart skipped a beat
That Lamborghini can deliver you to the moon and back in no time. Absolute beast of a car, no flaws. Power, traction, gear change. Wow, just wow
Owk now we need mercedes w11 f1 car
Now this is what you called a drag race 🔥🔥🔥
F1 go brrrrrr
i feel bad for the gtr cos its a great car and even did the 1/4 mile in less than 10s
Sick of seeing jurgen on everything lately
the slowest car on the day does a quarter mile in 9.3 seconds. SMH
V10>F1 V8
A Lamborghini and No Yiaani?! 😂
Matt has reached to the level where no one has reached he is definettly the best car journalist and has the best drag races ever no cap
That lambo is nuts!
No way.
This is gonna blow up the internet
Finally a twin turbo V10 huracan/r8 😍🔥
Girlfriend: Ready for round 2? Me: if the team are happy, I'm happy :)
try again with a V10, should be interesting
It's all fun and games until the lambo is missing the rear bumper
We want this lambo, F1 and Nevera!
Meanwhile ninja h2r be like are you guys racing
This is mad!🔥🙌🏿
Goosebumps!
Carlow drag races just gets faster and faster
Need one Bugatti vs koeinegsegg race
Why dont they put it in DRS
Yeee, closer to that F1 vs Rimac Nevera drag race :)
Lamborghini v1300 vs Bugatti
But the huracan is just MENTAL
I think you should bring the Rimac back
Rimac Nevera vs Formula 1 car
Man the lambo is nuts
That Lamborghini is washing out ❤️‍🔥from Malaysia 🇲🇾
That is one insane Lambo💚🔥#Hulk mode
The best channel in youtube ❤
this races are getting more interesting and better every day
Next video: 1500 hp cow vs an apache helicopter vs a submarine 😂😂😂
Tuned cars are amazing when they aren't throwing any hiccups aren't they
Yianni crying in the corner 😂
Where is the *Rimac Nevera ?*
Here before 20 million views !
That lambo vs rimac nevera!! Best drag ever
Wow, what an amazing experience that must have been! And the editing gave me so many laugh out loud moments! 😂😂
Race the Rimac, the F1 and this monstrous green Lambo.😉👍
F1 car does not have an "Automatic Gearbox"
Clear struggle for red bull.
Wow lambo
https://youtu.be/SA0fv6Ji7sU
How about we do a track time trial in all these cars? Bet DC won't loose in that.
Amazing as usual
The nissan gtr felt slow and out of the race, but its actually so quick it did a 9.3, wow
I don't care, I'm still impressed with the F1 car. Mod cars are stupid!
Buzz’s Lambo is insane fp!
first one
Matt ! You need to invite Vin Diesel as Dom Torreto for a drag Race !
F1 is about corners, not drag
the lambo.. i-
"The team are happy, I'm happy"
I have never click a video so fast xD
Matt crapping himself on that first race, priceless!
THAT LAMBORGHINI IS JUST INSANE
That Lambo was flying through MPH like KM/H 🔥
That lambo is savage
That lambo 🔥🔥
best race ever on carwow
4:26 u can see the chiron in the background from the other vid
Next drag race: Mercedes f1 vs Aston Martin F1
Notification gang from South Africa 🇿🇦
That lambo is definitely a F1 killer🔥🔥🔥
✌️
Like Mat says...THIS IS NOT!!!!!
When you have bi turbo lambo, i mean it really serious business there. Good job carwow
Those tt huracans are no joke they are stupid quick.
Bruh, I've driven the same Nissan GT-R🔥🔥🔥... In Forza Horizon 4 😐
OMG 😳 That Lambo is nuts!! in the straight line!
This is what I needed at 2am.
Holy shit 8.9s
I miss yanni for this race.
62.5 million pounds down the drain.
I am lovingggg these videos these days
Nice Up to Next level 🚀 🚀🚀
Can't wait mat tries the Tesla plaid s
Car enthusiasts know that this will get more views than normal but those watching this for fun please sub to this Channel because I know you’ll really enjoy what this has to offer. 😊
Yanni will love this lambo
This is amazing i wonder about the 2021 f1 compared to these, or the turbo monsters in the 1985 with 1200-1400 hp
Where is fiat panda?
Best vid so far.
Rimac Nevera against that Huracan.. 8,7 second vs 8,9 seconds. Should be a good one
F1 vs Koenigsegg vs Bugatti would be a #1 trending videoo.
If you want it lamborghini aventador svj today YouTube
One of the crazy races I ever watched
RIMAC NEVERA: HOLD MY BEER!
Does buzz know he built a street legal weapon 🤔
Do a f1 vs Rimac Nivera
GTR driver is sucks.... Matt do it again and drive the GTR by yourself ... Then we will see the diffrence
This is best drag race👏👏  wow!! The lamborghini is very fast..mat and all please like my comment
Rimac Nevera still fastest🤜⚡🤛
what else do we need now huh ? a monster truck ?
That’s f**king bonkers
The V10 cars with turbos become expectation exceeding I have seen. Not v12 or v8. The Lamborghini might shame Nevera and electric cars. It took Rimac Nevara 700hp more to do 0.3 sec better than that. Petrol engine isn’t going anywhere I guess.
When a car channel doesn’t know the difference between 4 wheel drive, and all wheel drive. I kinda start to doubt them.
That Lambo though 😍
That lamborghini is NUTS!
😳 👍
Hmmm...just turn up the boost for an extra ~200hp on the Lambo and it may be able to match the Rimac Nevera...
Freaking nuts Lambo
When you think about it the value for money with the Lambo TT is impressive against a F1 car
Matt big up🖒....these races just getting better and better again...
That F1 car sounds like a bug.
want to see between this lambo with rimac
Would be nice to do a drag race between the F1 car, a Rimac Nevera and that Lambo
leading to 6mln !!!!
Insanity
E i n   g r ü n e s   T i e r   💚   💚   💚
This is why we shouldn't race huracan without rear bumper and twin turbo
That lambo was an absolute rocket 🚀 😳
That Huracan fucks off
Mat you are my favourite
Woah. That lambo is fire 🔥
THAT LAMBORGHINI 😰😰😈😈
That Lambo...
The F1 car has too much drag
Never thought I’d see a road car (in whatever guise) stuff an F1 machine. Multiple times
When you see a lambo with no back bumper and turbo's, you'll know it is over for you
Insane :))))
Do that Lambo vs Rimac Nevera
F1 ANYTIME..
Pls put a rimac navera
Can you do rimac revera vs this lambo  It's gonna be interesting
SIMPLY WOW !
MEGA 🔥🔥
One of the greatest drag races I’ve seen in a while…
F1 vs Rimac Nevera 👀
If Yainne would drive that lambo, he would really be satisfied to be a lamborgini fan.
Carwow get better and better with drag races
Absolutely insane......🔥🔥🔥🔥that Lamborghini 😎😎
Now this is a damn drag race! Top cars love you guys!
waiting for you tl race with the m5 cs
Please do a half mile with the same trio
Imagine a car that crosses 1/4 mile in 9.3 sec loses
Imagine they start turbo charging the lambos....
6:02 LOLOLOLOL LMAO
Yeah, then try to race these cars on a race track.
More of F1 drag races please ❤️❤️❤️
Huracan is mental
Mannnnnn 🙆‍♂️ this race was just *beautiful* 💯
Im not satisfied!!! They could’ve done a second rolling race but didn’t!!!!!
Oh no
Wow
How many gears does this f1 car have😦
Invite DMO DEEJAY to your channel with his whips!!
Suggestion: SpaceX rocket vs BlueOrigin rocket
We need mod supra vs the lamborghini  I want to see 12 year old crying
I really enjoyed this one
So obviously the Nismo only feels fast judging from your reaction.
You should try racing that lambo with the remac nevera
Sweet Jesus the launch on that lambo 🥵
Ok not that the GTR could have beaten the lambo, but why is it that every time you get a GTR on the track you put the slowest reaction drivers in that car…Also I think you need to apply a policy, and that is to explain everybody WHEN they can go, because you start when the arms go down and other lift off when the hands are down. You anticipate on the drop and therefore are always a few tenths earlier. That 3rd launch was the most fair…you see the other drivers need to get used to the countdown and the drop…3rd was the most fair race.  The first rolling start…I mean c’mon….the GTR is one full car length behind…again not that the GTR had a chance in this race bit at least treat Godzilla with some respect. Haha
We want that lambo with rimac nevera 😎😎
That lamborghini is CRAZY
Rimac vs huracan
Love the GTR's number plate s :)
I thought Carwow couldn’t do any better after the Rimac. Then Matt goes and drops this….
That lambo did 8.9 🤯
Ngl the drag races just keep on getting better and better
Whenever i see Lamborghini,  i see Yianni
This type of road is killing the F1 ... :(
150,000 pounds, how cool it would've been if I could get this car at this price only the currency would have been in rupees instead of pounds. I wish
Still slower than Nevera🇭🇷
Where is yiannimize
The slowest car ran 9.3 🤯🤯🤯🤯
waiting for honda hr-v vs Toyota CH-R vs Audi q2 drag race 🙂
£150,000 destroy £62.5 million in a drag race.
Damn, that lambo was tuned perfectly 👍🏾😁
Next Video: 1200hp Huracan vs Rimac Nevera
That Lamborghini is a beast for sure🔥🔥🔥💪💪
the f1 car should be the drs is open
Was literally watching that lambo on the llf channel
They need to bring the v6 hybrid f1 car out. About 1000hp would make this even better
This is definitely the best car channel on YouTube, love the work Mat and keep it up
You know they are some crazy cars when the F1 comes last 🤣🤣
Gtr got gapped
Wow that Lambo
Bila nak bawak KING (MYVI) lawan semua kereta ni Matt oiiiii
Can the F1 do a rolling race?😒
That Lamborghini launch is CRAZY🔥🔥🔥
That gtr sounds amazing
The bar goes up every time  Next video f2002, f2004 and mp4/4 drag racing await 🏎
Now all we need is a Formula One vs Model S Plaid drag race!
sensational 🔥
You cannot have access to an F1 car Carwow: hold my bear
This Lamborghini is looking like superman without underwear 🦸‍♂️
We won’t this Lamborghini and Chiron drag race
Эта лабма-волк  в овечьей шкуре
That lambo is mental
Yanni would be so proud of lambo 😂
I swear from the thumbnail I thought the Lamborghini was DMO’s Lamborghini with a different wrap
Wow that lambo tho.......Yanni making proud noices in background
IDK why but Huracan always performs well with tunes
that is one fast lamborghini
Race it against RIMAC!
R u getting rickys gtr with 1900hp
Where is m5 ?
IDK why but Huracan always performs well with tunes
According to yiaani  Lambo all day everday
Red Bull look like they're just giving away their car rn lmao
Never ever mess with a Lamborghini without rear bumper.
The formula 1 sounds like an rc car haha! Awesome video!!! Love the huracan especially with that twin turbo it’s out of this world 😍
