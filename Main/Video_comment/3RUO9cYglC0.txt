Listen to The Skip Bayless Show podcast: http://sprtspod.fox/SkipBaylessShowPodcast
😜😜😜
Time flies Look where Shannon is now and look where skip is... And Dallas still sucks!!!!
What's up with Diet Mountain Dew & Skip Bayless, exactly?...
We just beat them this past week  This show is dead Skip isn’t even on tv no more and cowboys still have the same qb same HC Let that sink in.
This Cowboy team does this to you, Skip, because you always overrate them and refuse to listen to anyone else. By the way, if a team “has a running game that you cannot stop” then there is no way you are better than said team.  There is no pundit who second guesses a team’s decisions after the fact more than Skip when he’s wrong. Skip’s biggest mistake of his career was thinking his ego could handle debating someone who actually knows football on a daily basis. Nobody beat Skip more in debates than Shannon did. And it was all just from using Skip’s bogus arguments back at him to show him and the audience just how delusional they are. In the end that’s ultimately why Skip lost his composure and said some things to Shannon that nobody can come back from.
As a cowboys fan watching this is so funny
RIP The (original) Undisputed > The Facility (yuck)
lol 2024 and still come back to watch Skip get trolled when they lose 😂😂
Still loving this two years later 😂
Skip is the lamest cornball ever 😂
The show isn’t the same without unc & Jenny
Now you know what too low sports level you all the time blaahh blaahh blaahh Skip ? Zip your mouth now Idiot
Don’t waste your time to talked with Idiot guy … Skip is too low level about Sports
Look at you face Skip … hahaha ….
You will Wrong all your life Idiot Skip …Zip your mouth Skip
Stupid Skip … Idiot Skip … you still wrong all your life Skip … stupid ….
I miss these days so much
4:23-4:48 God I miss these two together😭 Shannon come back!!!
You are forever Wrong Wrong Wrong about football Skip … Stupid guess … you need to stop your job now Skip …
Miss them together
I miss this duo😭😭🥲🥲
Skip is like all cowboys fans full of excuses
As a 49er fan, hearing Skip just lose it and yell about "the stinking 49ers" had me doubled up laughing each time I replayed it. 😂
Just put Dak Prescott under the bus 🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌🚌
Do not resign him let him walk because you can't trade him or even give him away.... their are no takers for Dak Prescott.... nobody.... nobody.... nobody wants Dak Prescott because he'll lose too many games because that's who he is.....a 75 millions of dollars loser.....
Jerry Jones you get what you paid for from Dak's Prescott 75 millions of dollars and a Lost again and again and again and again no super bowl appearances.... thank you Dak Prescott for nothing from you.., your a sorry excuse for a QB
There was never a doubt in my mind who would win this game.  Dak will never get it done when it matters
Just thinking how is skip so cool with Jerry Jones and he won't even acknowledge skip but he flying in helicopters with snick a smith and appearing on first take skip a fraud
The cowboys are nothing but underperforming bums -unc shay shay 😂😂😂😂
37 cases of Diet Mountain Dew?!...  Yikes!...
skip bayless🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
DAK SUCKS!!!!!!!
Skip will be really crying When Rogers beats the Cowboys again this year.
Skip you complain about the boys being boys and doing boyish things and being lovable losers when it counts but that’s their identity
The chokers when it counts cowpokes are the modern day version of underachievers of the nfl
Skip is living proof of the old adage there is no fool like a old fool
Dak lost this game a repeated the same thing a year later
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I know this was last year but what do we know DEJA VU , I am not saying we need a Parcels, Bill Cowher or a Bellycheck, I am saying we want a parcels, Cowher or bellycheck couch 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬😨😨
This is my favorite Skip meltdown
Calling a running play with little time left is just to little to late and it’s lame
As Shay said statscot he got those empty calories
Tell-it-like-it-is Shannon Sharpe
The only bowl the cowboys was going to is the toilet bowl
more than a year later still funny as FCK !
Remember a year ago when this happened? And then it happens the next year and the cowboys fans reaction are exactly the same?
They can just replay this every January
Bums. Done
here after they lost again but this time divisional round LOL 😂
And here we are 1 year later...🤣🤣
Last year's (this video) reaction was so much more entertaining than today's
ngl i thought this was today’s show then i heard jimmy g
How are the cowboys better then the 49ers when everytime they play the 49ers beat them they beat them in Dallas they beat them in San Francisco the 49er are just a better team
Cowboys failure in January: as reliable as death and taxes. 😂
What a difference a year makes....
Skip look like he's going to 😭
I don't understand how you have to be motivated to play in a NFL playoff game
He got Dak'd!!!
Man, time hasn't done well for Skip
History repeats itself 😂
One year later and Dak does it again 🤣
Love it
Deja vu.
Skips hides behind excuses
Cowboys with that Satanic pentagram on their helmet deserve everything they get
same script a year later
You was wrong, wrong, wrong, wroooong, WRONG!!! Wrong again Skip 🤣.
Skip will be saying the same thing tomorrow.
Huh same thing happened 😂
It’s just lame to lame the officials
Brock Purdy is the real deal
History does repeat itself and once again at San Francisco the boys lost 19 to 12 The niners have the Tom cat cowboy’s number 2. years in a row
Skips blame deflection was the ref well what about the rest of the game
Whose here after the cowboys lost to the 49ers again in 2023?
Whose back here after the NFC Divisional game 😂😂😂😂😂
This is a classic every year I feel for skip I was hurt also skip but we got this one in 2023 match up this week 🫡
Ohh skip you going to get a double dose of that gold rush again well here skip wine you need some cheese 🧀 lol 😂 and there going to not loose but get spanked the next time In nappa Valley were no oil just fine wine
1/22/2023 Niners vs Cowboys re each other again 🔥 Go Niners 🔴🟡
49ers gave the cryboys the corners late in the 4th quarter and they couldn't score. 49ers couldn't even let them win without beating the Dallas cow pokers.
I freakin love Shannon's passion 😂😂 But Skip!... Skip! 😂
Ready for another one of these Tuesday morning
COWBOYS will choke once again
Couldn’t spike the ball fast enough to stop the clock against the 49ers in the playoffs  That’s also how Daks very first game ended against NYG
Imagine using your whole argument based on penalties that right there tells you are decades from winning a SB but carry on skip I’m sure we’ll hear until the day you die how the cowboys are going to win it all.  Your they’ll win it all in 3020
I would pay top dollar to taste Skips tears after the official said the game was over 😁. Skip, you do not work or play for the Cowboys!  Stop saying “WE”!!!!!!!!!
Skip has been WRONG 25 STRAIGHT YEARS ABOUT THE COWBOYS!  Why does anyone think Skip knows anything about football!?!? If you fail that many times in any business you would be fired!  FIRE SKIP “I love Baker Mayfields sack bouncing off my chin” BAYLESS!
that was last year Skip has short memory week 14 in 2022 season and he is back to the old bs again wait few more weeks and same type of show all over again
5:31 😂
Wat about my dew skip!! Lol
9 months later and its still priceless. 49ers for life.
I mean dallas fans so this to themselves.
Skip took it like a MAN! Hats off!!!
I miss this Jenny, she is so much better then this robot jenny they have now..
8:15 has to be a top 10 Skip line of all time
5:31 lolol
Damn, remember Skip was sick that week (which is why they're doing the show separated); credit to Skip for giving it his ALL here - he must have developed a migraine after this segment.
Who is watching this 8 months later?!!! 😀😃
Lmaooooo
Bayless is a pathetic joke of a human
Shay statscot he got those empty calories
In the end the boys are just the boys
people in dfw hate ship bayless
7 months later, still at the same spot, still at the same thing 😔🙄😋😁😆😅🤣
I love calling him Rayne Dakota Prescott
Lol 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shannon sharpe got some nice teeth
"This is the year." Indeed, it's the year your cowboys will choke again
Skip hurtin maaaan 😂 He hurt y'all ... Them fans... They faces.. . I live it. 😂
Diddnt dak get the coin toss wrong earlier in the season
This whole show is for adult babies, bonkers
To watch Skip explain a loss to my 9ers is just so "freakin" GOOD for my soul! Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
SKIP, HOLD ON & WATCH THIS VIDEO JANUARY 2023. IT WILL BE THE SAME AGAIN,
Jenny Taft a very strong  10.
Its still funny coming back to this and seeing Skip blaming the referee. Here's the thing. Even if they had the chance to snap the ball, there was less than a second on the clock, and Dak spiked the ball with all 0's on the board. Not to mention that when Dak ran the QB draw, he didnt decide to slide until he ran into an opposing player. When they tried to snap the ball on their own, they showed little urgency, they showed little alertness, and the fact that these multi-million dollar athletes (who have known basic football rules since college at the least) tried to snap their own ball knowing that they couldn't do that shows that the only people to blame for Dallas' early playoff exit is themselves. Even the damn announcers were saying that the play wasnt going to work out for them, that was before the ref even got into the fray.  And I'm a Saints fan who is no stranger to the referees screwing me out of a playoff game. I love ragging on the refs, but that game was not their fault.
SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP!!!!!!
As a 3x champ and HOFer it must be interesting sitting across from skip and debating football
They got a running game you can not stop ha ha ha ain't that the truth
Haha yea
😅
I expect the same this season 😂😂
I miss this jenny
Lmfao typical PATHETIC COWBOY fan response....omg I really wish someone made a meme of cowboy fans saying the ref should run as fast as dak!haha I've thought I've heard every excuse in the book but yet again cowboy fans find a new way to be pathetic/delusional! Stephen a Smith is right the most annoying, disgusting, delusional, pathetic fan base Balmes other people except the people who actually matter that's why yall won't win a thing.....switch the broncos and cowboys Right Now and the cowboys will go 0-6 vs the AFC WEST!! Yall have been in the worst division in NFL HISTORY FOR 10YRS AND HAVENT WON A DANG THING!!!hahaha
No matter what the cowboys do they won't be better then the 49ers
YOU GOTTA LET EM THRU SKIP 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
You can tell that Skip Bayless is all business around 1:34 because of the way he says "Let's do it...".
Til this day if I’m having a bad day I come watch this video to get a smile
Ramón James
Sadly, nothing stunned me about that loss. Only the most obstinate of Cowboys fans thought the Cowboys would win it. Don't get me wrong. I'm a Cowboys fan, have been since the late 80s, but I'm not blind to the team's weaknesses, specifically the QB position. Prescott is too limited in his abilities both physical and mental.
Jesus loves you :)
What better way to make myself feel better than to talk about the Cowboys losing to my 49ers.
No no sir it is up to your quarterback not the referees to win you the game your quarterback the one that says he wins us a lot of games no your quarterback choked it's up to Prescott to get down and manage the game if he's such a good quarterback
Cowboys fans always blaming other people pointing finger at each other instead of the real problem it's the Cowboys
Cowboys: can’t go home if you’re already at home 🤷🏽‍♂️😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone else ever come back to these lost reactions to get a good laugh lol
Give Skip Bayless credit for 0:14-0:22, in all fairness:  He at least admitted that he was wrong--albeit it was in hindsight.
It would have taken more time to go around the oline
Cowboy fans are pathetic they think there gonna win every year even after 20yrs of not winning more than 1 playoff game they think there all that and they PLAY IN THE WORST DIVISION IN FOOTBALL....SWITCH THE COWBOYS AND BRONCOS AND LET THEM PLAY THE CHIEFS, CHARGERS AND RAIDERS TWICE A YEAR AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS(0-6)  and don't talk smack cuz raiders beat yall up and we don't even have a number #1 receiver, defense and an o line but DC IS WAY BETTER THAN DAK AND THATS FACTS!! That's why all get bounced cuz you play garbage teams in regular season and once you have to play a good team yall get whooped!!! Until Jerry Jones steps down yall ain't winning a damn thing hahahah!!!!!
Shannon you are crazy. Cowboys are 20 years 20 years.
LETS GO NINERSSS 🏈🏈
I can think of a better Breakfast Of Champions than Diet Mountain Dew 🤣🤣
Shannon!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤ that’s what we do baby!!! I’m dead 🤣☠️🤣 Skip: breathing 😮‍💨 heavy because he already was light up 🔥 on social media.. he can’t take it anymore 😂😂😂😂😂 Best show ever 🎉
My hate for the cowboys is strong. Lol
Cowboy fan's are hilarious they believe they gonna win every year 😂😂😂😂
As a niners fan I enjoyed this
Dak throwing a hail Mary is funny
Tell'em how u really feel Skip
Oh dear! Skip my faint
Its July 2022. I was feeling bad so i turned this on and I suddenly feel  great.
😂😂☠️☠️☠️😂😂😂😂☠️😂😂☠️☠️😂😂…  Shannon came in and skip saw the smile 😊 and he is ok ok wrong wrong wrong SHOW IS OVER!!!
Where was Dallas the whole game because complaining about a play where statscot didn't know the rule.of handing the  ball.to.the ref is childish
Why didn't the Cowboys have a timeout. Oh, yeah. McCarthy is their coach.
I can relate to skip as a Yankees fan I too have not seen championships in awhile and it’s sad
This would have been a 1000 times better if they were both in studio
Is it even NFL football without the Cowboys losing?
This is 😂😂🤣 til this day
Who wants to make a friendly bet that the cowboys will have 5 or less wins this season?
the fans where crying cause rhet are morons with no football iq
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
You lost 75 million skip?
She’s Beautiful.
I hate when fans say we or I when they are talking about their favorite team!  If you don’t get a paycheck from the team you are a fan of should never use that language. Skip talks about the cowboys like he’s Jerry Jones 🤮
Know body talking about how they are betting with Cases of Diet Mountain Dew 😂
I love Jenny Taft 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Just another Cowboy fan blaming the ref for his team not knowing the rules
Eagles fan.  Nobody cares.
The upcoming season  2022  my Hawks will have a   9-8  record we will play the Cowboys  10-7  in Dallas  27 - 23  Seahawks wins  with Drew Lock     YEAH  RIGHT  MY  HAWKS MORE LIKE  6 - 11   Drew Lock is a Crum Bum  😂
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Those who think Skip Bayless is just performing for tv should watch him at 14:28 when Shannon starts to give a little more technical explanation of what SF was doing in their running game. Skip is rolling his eyes, shaking his head and sighing until they took him off camera. There was absolutely no reason for him to do that at that time based on what Shannon was saying. But Skip is JEALOUS! He does that EVERY TIME Shannon gives former player details on football. He hates when former professional players demonstrate that they know things you can’t learn even if you cover sports for 100 years like Skip.
Why is this old man rolling his eyes when Shannon talks about the 49ers blocking scheme. As if he knows more.
Right on point Shannon. Dak is terrible. Chokes in pressure situations. Not a good QB.
Anyone remember skippy telling everyone that Dak is better than Stafford?  Lmaooooo what a clown!
Skippy ur cowboys stink and have always stunk lol..  There not overrated, everyone knows they beat up on the most pathetic division in football and are no good!  They are "overrated" bc of clowns like u skip propping them up all year bc of a weak schedule!  Clownboys lol
Always blaming the Coach but the Coach ant playing in the game Dak a QB he should have known not to run that far
Cowboys will forever be losers.....
Skip: I predicted they would go 12-5!!! Shannon: And I predicted they would go one and done!!!  That part had me rollin!!!
Media always hype up the Cowboys,  makes me sick . FLY EAGLES FLY 🦅
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂LMAO
Put them back in sunnyvale
Cowboy Fan's tears are the sweetest nectar lol
Mahomes starts at his own 20,13 seconds gets off 3 plays, scores! Dak couldn't even spike a football in 14 seconds!
Now ots the refs faul no way no how
Skipp 7.50hr. Too funny try 75 million$$$ guaranteed check the books brother jerrys cowgirlz😜
COWGIRLZ DO COWGIRLS THINGS
I watch this on occasions since it first aired just to hear Shannon get at Skip Cowboys
Everyone else: ... Shannon: HOLD ON JENNY!!! JENNY!!! JENNY!!! JENNY!!! HOLD ON JENNY!!! JENNY!!!
There needs to be a doc on set to check Skips blood pressure
646 cowboy fans who disliked the video, 😂, sharpe got you good
Poor skip...Shannon at his best trolling
1:05
Corran a McCarthy
Corran a McCarthy
8:15 Was too damn funny!!!🤣😂😂
Cowboys gonna give skip a heart attack one day 💯💯💯💯
skip just sitting there taking his scolding gave me ptsd when my mom would yell at me for doing something bad
I just thought of something. When skip talks about how many yards that Dak Prescott had in the fourth quarter, I had a thought. A lot of those yards were empty yards. Because even though they progressed the play, they never really got in the end zone but once. So what's the point of having so many yards if you only score seven points?
If the cowboys are better than the 49ers, why did the 49ers beat Aaron Rodgers and the Packers?
Give skip some diapers n a pacifier cuz he sounds like a little baby whining n crying. Seriously listen to this grown man whining on national television n complaining about some BS so pathetic
Skip saying he was wrong like it’s some big Revelation  Guy is wrong 90% of the time.
The Cowboys lost this one bc the moment was too big for Dak. Did you see the look of extreme confusion and total amazement on Prescott's face as he sat on the field at the game's conclusion? The "Keystone Cops" ending was comic GOLD! Dak tripping over his Center and trying to spot the football then running into the ref who was SUPPOSED to spot the ball by rule could not be choreographed any better. The sad, tearful faces of the Cowboy faithful was pathetic. I'm a Cowboy fan too, so I can't even imagine the amount of vitriolic banter   this has and will generated for years to come. Hard days ahead for Cowboys fans.
Dirt Dew is nasty
Eagle fans not worried about the cowboys wining a Superbowl anytime soon. The mental game. Somehow the do something. Or something happens and they lose.  Wanna scare me! Fire your coach for a coach who been there. Have to TB that can get 100yd a game. Improve your pas rush. A defense that will not allow you to get into  field goal range to win the game with less than 2 min left.
Does skip realize that the oline wasnt even set when the ref got to the ball?
Poor Skip...
I’ve noticed after watching alot of old first take vids that Skip stopped doing the Joker smile since moving to undisputed.
Go see week 11 of 2018 broncos at chargers that's how to use your 1 last minute fans go see what Dallas should of done forward to the last minute dak and McCarthy should both be fired
😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣
Watching Skip lose his cool when his Cowboys lose makes my heart feel overjoyed! 😂😂😂
Skip had a melt down from like 6:30 onwards
0:25
5:16🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
San Francisco “Super Gremlin” 49ers
Skip is right here, I’ve watched every game since this and every ref has been there within 2-3 seconds. That red just sat back until the play was done, usually they advocate as the play does.
Dak needed to take responsibility for running that ball that far knowing full well he wasn't going gonna score. He made a poor decision and came back to bite him. 🤷🏿
How do you think Shannon Sharpe is a good analyst and also very talented and I used to think the Skip Bayless was a decent journalist until the incident where he had it with x head coach Eric main genie and part of the he got fired twice and he even applied that just because he talked to coaches that he can actually coach in the NFL and I lost all the respect for him... And I am so glad that he's not a niner fan.. and he's a cowboy fan so I think he curses the cowboys
This whole segment was hilarious… very funny duo 👍
Cowboys are not America’s team…..Dak isn’t worth 3 million a year
The cowpokes should of passed the football but no they ran the clock out by running the football
Shay statscott got himself some empty calories
Skip is slumped down like a little child 😆 🤣 😂 😹 😆
The cowboys are a walking accident waiting to happen
Baseless is discovering that the boys are just the boys
Jenny is beautiful
This was classic.  Shannon was at his best.  Skip looked like he didn’t sleep a wink!!!
4:51 🤣😂
Skip Hyped up those Delusional cowboy fans for a devastating heartbreak
How them Cowboys now 😂😂😂😂😂
Being a MISS State fan  watching Dak against the 49ers reminded me when he was at state we were ranked #1 going to Tuscaloosa and play Alabama for what could have been sec west champs but Dak showed us that he isn't going to be that player that wins championships looks like he's starting to show Dallas what he showed state fans
Cowboys was thought to be the best players. Yes  different they were thing happened it changes. Never know next yr it's another different story
Steven A. Said the same thing Shannon is saying.
Yeaha that pretty much some it up
Jenny is glowing 🥰🥰🥰
Skip doesn't drink Diet Dew anymore. So that's 37,000 dollars?
I think there are no 2 people on the PLANET EARTH I enjoy watching argue more than these guys!!
Blathering idiot,....
Poor skippy guess he didn’t look how they were 5-4 against the rest of the league
Is it me? Or did Jenny have facial surgery?? She looks very different..
As a Cowboys fan, I saw this coming as soon as we hired Mike McCarthy but this still hurts. We haven't had a real coach since Jimmy and since Jimmy left it's been a constant struggle with discipline and play calling even though we have the athletes to compete and win big but that won't happen with our GM/Owner/Head Coach/Cheerleader/Everybody's frenemy Jerry Jones.
The Ref was stunned the Cowboys ran the ball.
Are the Cowboys better than the 49ers? Just a thought…🤔
Did y'all see Stephen A Smith on first take TO FUNNY
Facts Unc coming from a Cowboys Fan. Dak is just another average QB! 2016 to 2021 one year hurt come on. No NFC Championship not once yet?
Skip week one next year “My CoWbOyS going to the super bowl” lol how many years have we heard that from u almost 30 years now
The tears of Skip is the most refreshing drink
Maybe  if the umpire was payed by the cowboys, he would have been exactly where they wanted him to be.
Watch the video skip, the dallas center moved the ball forward and the ref had to re spot the ball. Try not cheating next time. Hand the ball to the ref.
8:15 lmao
I got news for ya Skipster...the Cowboys are NOT better than the 9ers. You are a hater. Wake up man, first step to the cure is admitting it.
Skip, hiring McCarthy was a mistake just like not putting Romo back in as starting QB when he was healthy and putting Dak on the bench to learn.
I was so happy when the 49ers beat the Cowboys because I hate the Cowboys
Stephen A Smith
Skip is a jabroni
👍
Lousy stinking no good cowboys
And you still lost 12-5
Your stinking cowboys lost to 49ers
We don’t need u to say anything you lost take it ,, shut up and talk about the miners for once admit it
Respect this community 🖕🏻the packets
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
skip the goat
Shannon told skip setting himself up disappointment lol lmao
What Merry Go Round goes up and down? lol Unc wild
Skip Bayless.... lol 🤣
Since I was a kid I've always heard (from former HS & college coaches) that lots of penalties = poor coaching.  Def was true for the Cowboys.
Lol 75 million  Dak has money arm syndrome    I've  got a middle finger up for all Dak fans until we get a new QB
You watch a video expecting Skip to humble himself after being completely wrong about his Cowboys, and what you get is 15+ minutes of him making excuses and taking cheap shots at the team that beat them.. Why am I not surprised lol?
Jimmy G didn’t leave them off the hook
Skip is double face man.
I was just happy they got more than 10 wins in the season. As sad as I am to say this, I knew they weren’t going to win. They didn’t show up to play at all, they were better and should have won but they didn’t bother to go to the game. They should have let the fans play. I love dak but he’s a second string qb, he’s not mvp material.
Very happy with this
Skip had nothing for this argument and he knew it. Shannon had him on every single point & Skip had to low-key accept every point. Too funny!
Both teams entrance into the stadium was a good indication of their state of minds
Dak set the ball down 3 yards further then the slide location, the ref touching it live where he did was generous as it was.
I love Shannon the Oakland Raiders
Dennis Green they are who we thought they were
Can’t believe my ears, skip said they lost to a 69er team that they’re better than. The 49ers are a better than the cowboys, this is coming from a hawks fan
How is “hands to the face” bad coaching??  What? Did Mike McCarthy forget to tell the lineman “he guys, now remember, ‘hands to the face’ is a penalty.  So dont do that.
Skip Bayless is an idiot!
Shannon and Skip 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
SKIP, WHINE WHINE WHINE!!!!!!!!!! RG4 RG4 RG4!!!!! WHAT HAPPENNED THE 1ST 3 QUARTERS, DID RG4 CAUSE THAT TO?
Well damn sharpe
Another OVER HYPED Dallas Cowboys Team!!!
Highschool skip unzipping his backpack "I haven't spoken yet"
Come on skip stop blaming the ref this was all on the cowboys
Well skip I don't think the Lakers are going to make it either so you might have your day to "Gloat" also?
Lol
When will Cowboys fans learn? You've been had, dooped, hoodwinked, bamboozled, led astray,  and run amuck! The star that night wasn't shining bright deep in the heart of Texas!!! 😂😂
Damn
Shannon giving Skip another beat down!!!!!
Skip wants to 😭... America joke choke again.Its the big money contract curse😅
Skip really arguing about not getting the last play but he doesn’t talk about the 8 extra seconds the refs gave the Cowboys. 🤣
Sour grapes
The accident waiting to happen cowboys should a got that insurance from Allstate commercial so that way you can protect yourself from mayhem like the refs 😂😂😂
111 yd in the fourth quarter Failed to mention 50 of them were on the last drive as freebies
I'll say it one mo gin, the cowboys won't make it until Jerry Jones tells Jimmy Johnson "I'm sorry". Until then that Jimmy Johnson cowboys curse will ride.
typical Cowboys entitled fan perspective coming out in Skip
scip the words you use is very hurtful to people who really do make 7 dollars and 50 cents a hour and they don't deserve that pay i know you know no one can live off that pay . So i suggest you use your platform to up  the pay rate for all . Now think about that cause noone in america should have to take home 7.50 an hour lets see what you do . charles clark
I blame the ref, but mostly I blame kellen more his play selection he is not an offensive coordinator, all the years he's been there. Dallas are not a playoff team also every coach that came to Dallas Jerry Jones has manipulated and puppeteer them to run his playbook or go home this is my team and I'm going to coach it whether you like it or not.( if you want to get paid).
Jenny😍
Dallas Cowboys have been practicing 'Social Distancing' from the Super Bowl 🏈  since 1997.... I'M JUST SAYIN' 🤷🏾‍♂️🤦🏽 Knock Knock: Who's There?! The Second Round... Knock Knock: Who's Not There?! The Dallas F'N Cowboys 😆 🤣 😂
It’s not the ref. He also got blocked and to fight through the line. He was trying his best to get there.
Dallas OC is supposedly in the running for head coach positions. NOT! That play calling was bad! You can blame it on Dak but who is giving the plays! It is a 50/50 blame!
I thought Cousins was overpaid ... Dak said hold my 🍺.   14 yards later ... 😆 🤣
Good video
That Bayless man...that Bayless man. I do not like that Bayless man. I do not like him on my screen, man just shut up, O Lord, my spleen ! I do not like Dem Boyz, O man. I do not like them, Jay I am. Not in a boat, not on a plane, not on my coat, not in my brain. Skip Bayless and Dem Boyz, O man...I just don't like them, Jay I am.
Uncle Shay Shay shoulda rolled up with the Henny and Cigar 😂😂😂😂😂
I'm not gonna lie skip can't catch a break lmaoooooooo
One of the funniest endings in NFL history
If only Sean Lee had been playing...
Dallas is better than that. This year at least. To many mistakes. I been a huge Dallas fan my whole life. Just an unacceptable outcome. They let it happen at home too. Just when I thought Dallas choking in the playoffs was over 🤦‍♂️. Even though in the end they may have and should of had a chance for about a 25 year pass for a TD, How many F ups did they need though? All they had to do was win and they didn’t. Better luck next year. Such a disappointment. They wouldn’t like it if I was Jerry Jones.
Stunned? Lol who was stunned? Everyone was picking the Niners to win besides narcissistic cowboy fans.. lol 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Skip putting that ref’s business out there was out of pocket… now everyone knows his employment in for information 🤦🏾‍♂️
The boys will never.... EVER.... WIN A SB , WITH JJ RUNNING THINGS, PERIOD..... If you disagree , just think about this, he hasn't  enshrined Jimmy Johnson into the Cowboys ring of honor, really Jimmy is the reason there was a Cowboysdynasty lol... but good news , his 89 yrs old people,  hang in there
14 penalties on any level will cause you to lose a football game. The Cowboys are very undisciplined.
Dumb ol skip is still trying to blame the official cry me a river skip
Diet Mountain Dew????? 🤣🤣🤣
Shannon was a bit out of control. Relax buddy
SKIP YOU'RE ALWAYS WRONG ABOUT YOUR COWBOYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!smdh
I never believed that Dak was the QB to get us back in the SB. He chokes in big games.
“Guess who’s not upset?”  Your momma case you eating the poor women out of house and home
As a neutral observer I expected the 49ers to win. They are the better team. And the Cowboys expectations are always hyped. And most Cowboy fans are disappointed come playoff time. You cannot honestly blame the ref.  You got to accept the overpriced and over hyped Cowboys need a new coach.
Skip blame'ss
Looks like Dak lied to Tom Brady with that "we'll see ya again" after that week 1 loss
even though Skip, I love you both, 😂😂
Shannon has a great dentist.  His teeth are AWESOME!!!
Nobody said nothing about field goal kicks difference mIss one  good field  position game    changer give him bonus
Skip and Cowboys are stunned. And nobody else is even surprised!
Awesome
Where’s ur ravens
There’s only two people that follow you on Twitter, SKIP, so it doesn’t matter how much you condemned your cowboys, this is the show where we like to he Shannon put you in your HOMER place
Wow that was the first time skip ever admit he was wrong about anything, he usually makes excuses for all his, WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG analysis
GTFOH the ref did all he could to spot the ball. The Cowboys are just stupid for calling a play that had a two second margin of error for successfully getting another play off.
Skip Brainless will never learn! Lol
I bet anything that crybaby Bayless is a Republican. Crying about the rules and blaming their idiocy and their loss on the officials.
Cowboys were 6-5 against any team outside the nfc east. We all saw the loss coming 😭
Couldn't happen to a better person or team.
d is eLaughing Stock of the NFL 🤣🤣🤣🤣
We don't hate Skip. We love him. He just frustrate us with his ridiculous takes often and we want our beloved uncle Sha to set him straight, especially on Cowboys and LeBron.  This two are the greatest duo ever, an absolute Goldmine 💯 🔥 We and Fox are enriched by it.
What do the cowboys and Lebron James have in common?
This was Shannon Sharpe at his very best and most brutal. Go Shannon !!!!!!!!
In my over 50 years of watching the NFL, in every game there was a loser;(except an occasional tie), but I have never seen an NFL game where fans were literally hugging each other and crying after a loss. I'm a lifelong Steelers fan, and we have made losing winnable games an art form lately,  but I have never felt the urge to cry after a loss! It doesn't mean that much to me! Its not the Dallas Cowboys that annoy me so much, but their "over the top", always somebody else's fault fans, that  makes this Cowboys' loss so enjoyable and gratifying to me!!
America wins when the cowboys lose
Get Shannon his cases!!!
🗣️Dallas run off hype but hype don't win playoff games performance Do🤷🏽‍♂️
I love it...
Easy Skip!!
Skip that old man that knows he’s old Shannon that old man tryna be young
I’ve heard that hormone therapy could help Skip’s menopause issues exponentially. He’ll still be his same whiney, excuse laden, arrogant, old ginger biotch self, but…
Dallas gett back to the game when Jimmy G miss that wide open post corner throw in third and throw that int in fourth guarter. 49r’s just let them come back to the game.
Man Unk gave Skip the business lmao
Watching Cowgirl fans try to blame the refs, when they simply didnt play well enough to win, is perfectly typical. 100% in character!
As much as he wants to blame the game on Ramon George, but he could've respotted the ball 2½ yards back where Dak actually gave himself up. Game should've ended before that spike either way.
"If the 49ers had any other QB, they'd beat you all by 30" LOL
AUDIO IS PATHETIC
Shannon sounds like a professional wrestler.
This is one of the many reasons why Undisputed is so much better than First Take.  Undisputed uploads the entire topic in 1 video while First Take cuts it up into 10+ different videos for more views/ads.
Shannon 😂😂😂😂 Skip 😭😭😭😭😭😞😞
*Who taught Dak how to handle the football in the postseason?  Romo?* 🤔😂
*This is for you, Dallas fans:* *______* *|     |* *|     |* *|     |* *|     |_**_________* *|___________|*  *Enjoy!* 👍
Cowboys beat the EAGLES and said the EAGLES suck and the cowboys turned around and lost and the EAGLES said the cowboys suck 😂😂😂
Does Skip understand how garbage time stats work in the 4th quarter? Smh
Oakland raiders lol
Let's go 9ers!
I'm with Shannon Sharp!
Skip is pathetic
That thumbnail creature on the right looks exactly like a cowpie
Awesome duo lmao
THE PENALTIES WERE DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
niners  and packers a big battle
cowboys lose😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪
people underestimate niners
its my turn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
skip was wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Damm Romon George
Dak is overrated and people are starting to realize it, he lost that game and had no idea how to manage the clock. Dak isn't a great QB and he's not a leader.
Skip was not in denial, but his displeasure was hilarious.
I live to hear Shannon and Stephen A Smith's comments after a Dallas loss 🤣🤣🤣
Skip stop, don't blame that one play on Dallas losing!!!!  They stunk up the game with penalties that extended drives....
Just goes to show ya how many Californians are moving to Texas, it was a sea of red!!  🤣
I want to see all these commentators and players from Dallas on the field refereeing games who are blaming the a referee for that game on how it ended and see if they can do any better💪💪💪💪🤜🤛🤝🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤓🤐🤐🤐🤐🤐 So stop blaming the ref for the lost
OK, who gets the credit for coming up with Jimmy G for gag / gaffe?
Now to be honest, I absolutely thought they would win. It's the 49ers for goodness sake! This was literally the easiest task they had!! I thought they would've won and then gotten trounced in the actual playoffs via the Buccaneers or something. But who cares, I was sick of them anyways. LMAO
Up set
Hahaha
Thank you YT algorithm for suggesting this video! I needed the laughs. Sincerely, A Lifetime 49er Fan
Shannon has one suoerbowl why is he talking
*said CeeDee
Heard you cried?
I'm a Niners fan and this is painful to watch Skip squirming but hilarious as well. Good for Skip on his spin control ability. Even more respect to Sharpe for holding his feet and face to the fire.
This whining about the umpire is really lame . . .  McCarthy says they practice this all the time - really - didn't look like his quarterback or center had ever practiced this.
Skip look so sick 🤣🤣🤣
I stop watching the cowboys a few years back some story since early 2000 same cowboys sports is a joke lockdown
Skip is an idiot.  The players are supposed to give the ball to the ref as soon as the play is over, ESPECIALLY if they are in a hurry. It's not on the ref to break through the oline because they tried to spot it themselves.  If they gave him the ball right away and didn't impede his progress, he might have made it.  It was also a stupid call with 8 seconds to go, unless the plan was for Dak to slide 5 yards earlier.  You can't leave it up to chance like that. I'd have called 2 hail mary's instead.  They had 2 shots from the 40 and capable WRs to catch it. Trying to squeak out an extra 15 yards doesn't help that much in the long run.   It was an epic fail by both coaches and players.
Hahahahahahahahhahahahahahahaha POOR Skip
My Cowgirls hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
Love it...$75 mil check bouncing because of a playoff game failure.  BOYS for life but this season was truly disappointing because I felt Dak had actually turned a corner in the first several games.  His total regression after the injury really ruined what should have been a great season.
Absolutely ridiculous that Skip blames umpire Ramon George.
Shannon, shut up, stop yelling.
I almost feel bad for skip. 49ers #1
I don’t care how much everybody hates Skip, I think he’s hilarious.
Shannon just won 10 cases od do baby. Skip lost big
Why would the ref assume Dax would run a play (QB Sneak) that you (Skip) agree was extremely unlikely!
Also ref had to adjust the ball position not just tap the ball. If dak hadn’t run more yards and wasted five seconds doing so, and moving that much further away from the ref who is STATIONED behind the line, all would have been well. Can’t believe this ref is being hung out to dry like this. And I’m not a ref fan. Nor a Dallas hater. Well, maybe a little.
This is PRICELESS 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The fact this bih got 1 million views 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I was geeking when that ref said. "That's the end of the game" and than ran away like he had 10 minutes to go see his side chick.
Y did t ref move it back a yard then forward half a yard??? Just touch it n move away.
Didnt know earl hebner was now an nfl official. Lol
I genuinely like this show. I watch the clips at work during my breaks but c'mon son! How do you not post clips from the other playoff games...smh...Bills beat the breaks of the Pats, Bengals was in a thriller with a controversial call, Chiefs dominated the Steelers on which was more than likely Big Ben's last game but once again all we get is Cowboys & Brady talk...smh
You can't line up and block the referee from doing his job and then place blame....i understand Cowboys were prolly frazzled but they should have sought the ref and handed him the ball for spot. Also even though the middle was open space, I wouldn't have gambled with the clock on that play . Bad move by Prescott and or whoever called that play. Also also, if you suck as a team for 3/4 of a game and leave it all till the end, shame on you and you prolly don't deserve the win.
omg...this is too good!
SUPER SHOW! I was in a horrible mood having a bad day until I saw you two roast each other to ashes. Magnificent!
I lost it when skip yelled "took the ball and slammed it right down there throats"
skip look like he snort a 8ball to get him through this show
Cowboys 6-6 outside the NFC East Packers and Bucs both 8 or 9 wins outside the division  Dallas MUST do better vs good competition
It's always fun to see the Bovines lose and their fans cry.
Dak choked. He even had the deer in headlights look in his eyes.
nothing but excuses  Skip
Am I the only Cowboys fan that understands that it was the bad QB sneak play call and not the ref that costed us a chance at winning? 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
SG super grimlin
There is two reason why  I picked the niners over the boys , and you take these reasons out the equation and they are even , and the finale score is even. Debo!
Dak is not a good qb it’s plain and simple. Plus cowboys don’t know how to execute when it matters the most that’s why they’ll never win at least in this era
1:37 ? Can't stop laughing for some reason dude weird
Dak should have headed for the sideline as soon as he broke contain. He had the first down, he had blockers. If he made it out of bounds there would have been 10-12 seconds on the clock, with the clock stopped. They would have had time for 2 plays. Would he have made the 30? Maybe. But the clock would have been stopped.
Why when Dallas cowboys loss a game they blame other people
123 hefty bags 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Awesome
Yo Skip we can't see your clips. Are you aware of that?
Ref should have caught up with the play faster...and Dak should have given the ball to the ref, not the freakin' center
Cryboys/Cowpies rule, Skippy! Doing what Cryboys/Cowpies do best: whine, cry & blame everyone but the pathetic incompetent losers that the Cryboys/Cowpies  are. No accountability. Blaming it on the referee, Ramon George, who was 17 yds behind the play, where he was supposed to be! Every NFL game that i watched this season, the referee is 15 - 20 yds behind the line of scrimmage. Charlie Brown & Sgt. Schultz ("I know nothing, I see nothing" from Hogan's Heroes) were not even on side until 0:03 when the referee grabbed the ball to place it correctly. Cheating Dak-Dak Goose & Biadasz (center) placed the ball on the 23 yd line, when the rules clearly state that the refs have to spot the ball. For the record, Dak-Dak Goose slid & gave himself up at the 26-yd line, his knee was down and was touched by Al-Shaair (#51) at the 26-yd line. Look at the replay. It's right there on tape. The Cryboys/Cowpies tried to cheat 3 yds but claim 1 second was stolen from them. Lest we forget that the Cryboys/Cowpies still needed to complete a 26-yd pass which Next Gen gives less than 40% probability. Chokers and poseurs.
Dak should of handed that ball to ref and that wouldn't even be a topic
Im a cowboys fan n this lost is on the Dak n the offense cuz the defence got us here n Dak lost us the game.
If McCarthy didn't let them get into that position in the first place? More often than not, you don't end up with this kind of problem. It's called playing not to lose.
Eagles fans cried when we won the Super Bowl. We don’t cry when we lose,!
Skip Wa Wa Wa. Stop crying.   The game was over
“Yeah.. he tackled him because he’s not very good” dead
Can’t say Skip doesn’t get the views and this show isn’t popular 1M Views???!!! Within a day?! Nice! Undisputed >FT
Well said Sharpe !!!
Dallas are a bunch of bums just all big names and not really that good hahaha love it Jimmy g knew he's got this and they would win this one cause Dallas sucks
Remon caused that delay of game when we faked. Didn't leave the snap until the clock was zero then walked away and blew his whistle.
Hahaha doesn't take a genius to know cowboys stink will always lose
Lol Dak and the Cowboys D doesn't play any better in the 4th quarter. Lol the other team is just playing conservative on offense and the defense is just bending not breaking.
Dak is wack!
"yea u slept like a a baby and now ur making points like a baby" XD lmao
Even as a Niners fan I think Shannon went a bit overboard on Skip. It was a good game. Neither team put in a perfect performance. Jimmy G made a few mistakes. Skip was talking about that particular ref. Personally I don't like him either, but I don't think he was to blame for the Cowboy's loss.
Everyone ought to vote for Governor Abbot, he is the greatest Governor of our nation and of our time!
Skip Bayless is pathetic…
That cowboy star on the helmet hypnotize a lot of cowboy players into thinking they're all stars but they're not. This is why u need a disciplinarian head coach to keep them grounded Mr. Jerry Jones. How many seasons n head coaches  is it gonna take for u to see that
Cowboys didn't deserve to be in the playoff. All 11wins came from sorry teams. Easy teams they played all year long. NFL put the cowboys in the playoffs for ticket sales. Um a Washington fan,know one in the east deserve to be there.been waiting all season to say this. Cowboys will always overrated.
Blame it on the refs as always😪
Skip Bayless releasing Shannon Sharpe is making his points like a crybaby when Skip Bayless always sounds like a crybaby when he's complaining her making a point or anytime he gets a point he always sounds na na I was right so he dont have room to talk
I'm loving every minute of those stinking cowboys early exit out the playoffs til this day
Not the refs fault @skipbayless the ref has to officiate the play.. Dak should have went down at the 30 that would have given them 3 sec left..
Shannon gave Skip the tongue lashing of a lifetime
Skip Bayless is a clown.  Who on the Cowboys is better than Deebo Samuel?  No one.  Which Cowboy is better than Trent Williams?  No one.  Which Cowboy is better than George Kittle?  No one.  Which Cowboy is better than Nick Bosa?  No one.  In what universe is Bayless living in that the Cowboys are more talented?
Wyness skip sound like a girlfriend who just lost an argument just because Cowboys do with the Cowboys doing that's losing the playoffs it should be no surprise to him by now the only one what one or two playoff games the last 20 years and one was against the Lions where the referees had to give the Cowboys I recall known to mankind step needs to stop riding on the Cowboys nuts so hard
I don't know why any Cowboy fan are surprised by this 49ers are better team Cowboys only made the playoffs because of the division they're in that they played in any other division they would not even have been a 500 team Cowboy fans might not like it but it's the reality of the situation
WELL HOWDY!!!! HOW ABOUT THEM COWGIRLS!!!!🤣🤣
I’m a diehard cowboys fan- you gotta stop blaming the refs!! It was a stupid play call. Simple as that. Downright ignorant!! Can McCarthy, trade mediocre Dak and underachiever Zeke!!
You Gotta Let Him Get Through Skiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiipppppppp
Nope Skiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiipppppppp Where's That Same Energy On The Cowboys Pound That Table 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bwahahaha!  This was some classic Sh!t!
Looks like skips been watching too much Pat mcafee
You should show the plays so we can actually see haha. Dallas should of never been in the game. The Niners almost beat themselves again, jimmy seems to choke at the end of big games. I guess he got injured in the first half though. Hopefully he can get healthy we need him to play like he did in the first half 80% of the time and we will be alright. Seems like he couldn’t do much in the second half.
I wouldn't really say the Cowboys were "stunned" Basically everyone outside of Dallas saw this coming a mile away.
On one hand- it’s really damn annoying how Skip will stretch like Michael Jordan’s arm in space jam to blame anyone but the Cowboys for their failures. On the other hand- I also rather respect and admire that loyalty, even if it’s to the Cowboys lol
Y’all keep yelling louder and louder 😂
Cowboys are some under performing “BUMS” 🤣🤣💯
She’s in the thumbnail like again really 😂😂😂
Shannon is on the money, end of story
Cowboys lose love it
Jimmy Garapolo beat the Cowboys...how humiliating.
This game was decided long before the ref ran into the back of Dak at the end of the game. Dak was choking throughout the whole game, he is not an elite QB, but yet he's paid like one...smh.
Dallas Won
Skip stop making excuses.  We lost fair and  square
I slept like a baby!!! I am dead!!!!!
It was a home game for the 49ers in Texas I saw those jerseys in the stands
Possibly one of the most satisfying HUMBLE PIE moments of my life!
Can we give a shoutout to Shannon's teeth? Dude should be in the dentist hall of fame.
Skip looks like he’s gonna have a heart attack 😂😂😂
I like these camera angles lol
You lost
LMAO it was funny seeing the fans cry. Y'all silly rabbits. DCB4L
Shannon: "If the 49ers had any other quarterback, they beat y'all by 30." Damn!
I love to see the Cowboys lose. Every year, their fans/Skip Bayless says it's their year and every year, they choke.
“ DALLAS  LAS NALGAS “
Skips rage did not disappoint unlike his Cowboys lmao
The CHIEFS are the new AMERICA'S TEAM
“Yeah.. he tackled him because he’s not very good” dead 
I watched this again today and Skips anger is still funny 😆
Nobody was stunned..Dallas lost the game is first half  ( too many penalties ) and honestly 49ers should have blew them out. Why just think if the (3) field goals would have been (3) touchdowns.
“Yeah.. he tackled him because he’s not very good” dead 😂😂
Cowboys are just overrated. Emotional damage
Skip Bayless, you're as big a cry baby and 5 year old excuse promoter as Dak Trump ("credit to them") and Mike McCarthy. You're all truth deniers in the same sniveling manner as our ex-President in that there's ALWAYS an excuse!!! I have a feeling all 3 of you were in DC on 1/6. BTW-absolute greatest 5 minutes and 40 seconds of Shannon Sharpe ever followed by the pathetic, whining excuse machine Bayless.
I thought the day finally came where Skip would unleash the N-Word to Shannon LOL
Soon as I seen the 49ers walk out listening to music and having fun while the Cowboys walked out all uptight and nervous I knew we were in trouble
Putting the last play on the ref is B.S
Skip talks about cowboys everyday
Every year when they get eliminated he try’s to defend him 😭😭😭
I'm putting Stock in Kleenex tissue after Cowboys loss. More Money than Bitcoin. Money 💰 🤑
The ref should not have run over Dak, he should of politely asked to get through so he could TOUCH the ball.
wow give out ramones address .....
Only in America an idiot like Skip can steal a great living legally.
🤣🤣🤣🤣😎😎😎😎😎🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💩
Y do everyone hate the cowboys
Fire Jerry Jones...the boys will never going to win the championship until he is done and gone...
Will someone tell Shannon that without Terrell Davis he wouldn't have a ring smh.
I am not a proud Cowboys fan rn but Skip is probably the most idiotic Cowboys fan
Ha ha ha Skip admit it now your team You seems to be sore loser be careful breath your heart 🤪🤪🤪
I love my 49ers from a little girl. I'm from the N.O. 504. I'm 54 years old and still a diehard 49ers.
The stinkin 49ers got the Dub Skip.
The problem is not just McCarthy. It is Dak. He too often plays it safe in big games until its too late, holding the ball too long instead of throwing it to open receivers, because he's afraid to turn it over. He's afraid to become Tony Romo, who was great, but too often threw interceptions in the big games.
Either Shannon Sharpe is half deaf or he thinks his audience is. Why does he yell so much...in a tv studio....with microphones...like a mad banshee?
SKIIIIIP.. RG4 was GOLD 😂😂😂
Bills pitched the football equivalent of the perfect game against a defensive minded HOF coach. . .and THIS is what these hacks lead off with?!?
Jesus loves you he died on the cross for your sins. All you have to do is believe in him and you will be saved. ❤ ✝️
Damn Shannon, u taking it right to the heart on skip.. lmao
I didn't think this needed to be explained but the ump starts, where he is supposed to, from like 15 yard behind the line of scrimmage. Dax takes off with like 12 seconds left. The ump gets to the line with about 8 seconds like meaning he ran about 30 yards in 7-8 seconds (give him 1 second to realize dax is running). He then had to get through the offensive line who had inexplicably already set themselves down?  The ref did absolutely nothing wrong on that play and trying to blame them like skip did (even throwing a random dig at the guys full time job) is utterly insane.   The cowboys called a play were everything had to go perfect for them to have a chance to get 1 last play off instead at the endzone instead of 2 chances from the 40. To blame anyone but themselves is pathetic.
The O line blocked for the first time all night. Unfortunately for them the blocked the Ref.
Shannon just killed skip and the cowboys 😂😂😂😂
Cowboys fans be like 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥱😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥱🥱🥱🥱😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😳😳😳😳😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Skip, Skip, Skip. So 😔 The entire Cowboys nation is blaming the officials.  So sad.
Wait how are the refs (a huge part of this multimillion dollar game) not making enough to be a full time job 😂. You cannot complain if that’s what ur putting out there that’s comical
Dallas cowboys SB was beating the eagles 4th string the week before!  Lol skip Dallas is horrible when it matters, they come up small.
Dallas cowboys SB was bearing the 4th string eagles through week before lol
the NFC EAST SUCKS SKIP LOL. NOT HARD TO WIN THAT DIVISION LOL
Skip u suck!  Get a new coach !  Dallas cowboys suck !  U are always wrong about cowboys ! Lol..
if you were better than the Niners, you'd have won...take the L and move on, Cowboys & Skip.  You can sit at home and watch the Niners next week...
Mike McCarthy is mainly to blame for the loss. 14 penalties,  and Why did they run a slant route instead of an out route when it matters most at the end? Don't blame the refs, cowboys stink up the field again in the playoffs!!! Hilarious!!!
Listening to skip had me dying!!! 😭😭😭😂💀
Shannon let Skip have waooooo
Skip is a lame
Shannon Let Skip Have It My Dallas Family Is Still Crushed About This Damn Game Dak Dropped The Ball ..🏈
Micah parsons got blown up whole game saw him get pummeled
I love Shannon!!!!
Everyone who isn’t a Cowboys fan got a laugh 😂
*”Jesus… I’ve never seen a football team get dumped on as much as the Cowboys!!!”*
This is great television.
34:28 "Cowboys are under performing BUMS!!" Shannon is DEAD on except he left out OVER hyped....
THEY WERE AT HOME!!
Skip’s baby impressions 😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Cowboys lost, Donnie lost, Cruz got lost... Get over it texas
I think we were ready we just need to play the whole game like we did in the 4th.
I'm convinced that there's no way Jerry Jones doesn't bet against his team everytime they make the playoffs.
Skip is dillusional it wasn't the refs fault
McCarthy is/was a terrible hire.
Most QBs at Dallas are overrated
Skip quit! 🤣🤣🤣
Cowboy's fans are the most delusional fans in the NFL.  Been calling Dallas a SB team since 2016(when 11 of their 13 wins came against losing teams). Same this year beat up on losing teams , looked like a totally different team when playing good teams. If I were a Dallas fan what would bother me is not the loss, but the reaction from Qb and coach. McCarthy needed to take responsibility.  This is on me . My game plan was wrong, I did not have the team prepared... Same with Dak, This loss is on me , I made too many mistakes,  was not prepared.... When Jerry is the only grown-up in room not a good sign. McCarthy needs to man up apologize for his aftergame remarks take responsibility and tell players next season this will be a different team. Players will play my way or don't show up to training camp. Then trade Zeke first thing in of season.
I love my cowboys win or loose but I just amazes me how much hate the cowboy get we get more hate than the 31 other teams put together I mean 4 games this weekend and every single sports media talking about my boys and they will keep talking about them even long after the super bowl it’s over I LOVE AMERICAS TEAM WE THEM BOYS!!! DC4L
Poor cowboys, they think they should be able to spot their own balls, three yards beyond where the slide started at that, and just go ahead and add a second back on to the clock just because they're the cowboys. That ball was spotted 3 yards beyond where the slide started, if it wasn't on double zero at the snap, which I personally think it was, then it was on one and you can't add a one back. Also yall act like yall just needed a chip shot field goal to win the game,  when in the real world yall needed a touchdown while they would have 8 defenders standing in the end zone. It's very unlikely even if you did it properly,  which you didn't.  Blame it on whatever you want. But it's bad coach,  dak even said we give it to the center in practice. Real coaches practice real life situations, like having someone pretend to be the ref. It's just bad football and yall deserved to lose, get over it.
All we do is root for the niners now.. lol if they win then we say see its cuz they were the best like the typical cowboy fans we are. Football is so fun. The Fandom..  the trash talk, the emotion it's a blast. Everybody loves the cowboys. Everybody tunes on whether they root against or for em they are the most entertaining franchise in all of sports. That's a fact. Lol
He said he a Gremlin lmao too funny man
Why is Shannon yelling?
They should’ve faked an injury
4 seconds? Nah
Tell em Shannon! We smoking dat cowboys pack 🚬😂😂😂
Skip was right and pinned Shannon down when he brought up how Shannon was vouching for DAK TO GET PAID TOP DOLLAR but now this
Stupidest sports show ever.
im dying man i love skip hahahahaha
I don't want to hear Dak compared to Mahomes ever again.
No surprise cowboys lost. Out coached fire Mike get a rock star coach way to much talent. And I'm a niner fan next game niners vs Packers. Bye the way Arron lost his last three playoff games against niners. Why not one more. Go niners get that upset
"Stunned" lol ..... and if you don't know, now you know.... ninja - The Niners are a much better team and that's why the Cowboys lost.
Dak picked up like 10 or 15 yards, typical cowboy fans exaggerating everything. What yall don't think dak can throw a ball from the 35 to the end zone? I get it of course you would rather be close, but you can't run the ball with no way to get out of bounds and you don't have a way to stop the clock.  That's a way to lose and that's what happened...
Bruh, yall cannot blame that man.... he was sprinting down the field to touch the ball.  You can't expect that guy to be right behind Dak. This is the argument saying that guy cost yall the game??? Lmfao yall are ridiculous. My question is who runs a sneak up the middle of the field with 10 seconds left and no time outs?
Dak stopping the referee was the best block thrown by the Cowgirls the entire game.
Haven't seen Shannon like this since Clippers blew 3-1 lead in the bubble
At least Skip is loyal to the end. And Shannon, the two teams he played for are so great that he deserves to talk.
Shannon whippin on Skip like a red headed stepchild….I can’t stop laughing. 😂
This was the easiest $500 I've ever made 😂😂
as a packer fan, jimmy g isnt even bad. he gets a lot of hate for no reason for just doing his job
Ah, Skip, Cowboys suck!
The Cowboys saw how cold it's going to be in Greenbay!
Easy to get big yards in the 4th quarter when the defense plays prevent.
I love you Shannon , you're the best
I love that it was a team from san francisco that ended the cowboys' season.  Lot of trumpers foaming at the mouth this week.
Bottom line is Jerry Jones is getting exactly everything he deserves.  All the complaints and finger pointing all goes back to the egomaniac owner.  The football Gods are displeased with him.
I’ve been a Cowboy fan since SB V. This was the most talented, most flawed team . The fans are the most entitled acting fans in the NFL duped by Jerry‘s carnival barking leadership.
Shannon is nothing more that a Steven A cloned Cowboy hating bum himself. He's just copying what Steven A does and doing it in a different voice. One day all that hate is oing to consume you and be both of your ultimate demise
They have been the running joke for the last 25 years! The biggest laughing stock in football. 😭😂😭😂
I love Karma!! so sick n tired of Skip turning the show into a Cowboys Podcast he looks old and defeated I Luv It!!
At least Skip isn’t TOTALLY delusional. There’s still cowboys fans that are already saying next year it’s their year since now they’re hungry 😈 😭
Your Cowboys suck.  PERIOD. You lost at home.  Against a Jimmy Garoppolo lead offense.   Against a defensive with a rookie corner.  With out Bosa for most of the game.  And no Warner for the Last 8 minutes.
How much Diet Mountain Dew do these guys drink?
This actually made me low key love Shannon , he’s the perfect foil for Skip… he  always entertains Skip’s animated, over the top takes then just patiently waits to throw out a giddy Skeeeuuuuupppp.  His laughing and crackling giggles as Skip melts down make me LOL so hard.
Oh Skip....skip 🤣
These are supposed to be the elite. The best of the best. That's why they get paid the big bucks. I'm just thankful they aren't brain surgeons because they can't have a bad day. No excuses.
Skip just stop y'all lost 🤡🤣🤣
... I'm an American; Dallas has NEVER been my team. HA !  "You lose, you get nothing!" Ha!
Skip: cowboys lost cuz of lebron james
Dak is the main reason why Cowboys lost! Overpayed and overrated!
Cowboys always letting skip down
America's Team......Yeah Right!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cowboys got bullied. Yet Skip never credits the Niners.
I think Dak Prescott might have A.D.D. and maybe that's why he's so up and down. People with A.D.D. work best under pressure at the last minute and during those last minutes times they produce awesome and great results.
I love watching your guys’ acting skills. It’s actually very impressive 😅
I'm a DC4L.................Point blank we got out COACHED! PERIOD!

Cowboyz will never win the Superbowl again their trash 🗑
Skip everybody knows you hand the football to the officials not to your team mate...
Jerry shook Jimmy's hand at the Hall of Fame ring ceremony and then pushed him to the side.  The Cowboys lost and the 49ers pushed us to the side.  Period.
The Umpire before the snap is 15 yards behind the line of scrimmage.  Dak Prescott runs for a 17 yard gain.   That's 32 yards of space created by Dak Prescott for the Umpire to travel to get to the spot.  The Umpire didn't do this.  Dak Prescott did it on his own.   It's not a question of the Umpire being late.  The Umpire gets there when he gets there.  Dak Prescott created too much space and distance.  He gets an F for situational awareness.    Then Dak Prescott and the Dallas Offensive Line build a wall between the Umpire and the football.  NFL Rule 3, Article 2, Section 2 is unambiguous.  "A Dead Ball is Ready for Play while the 40-second Play Clock is running when the ball is placed down by an official at the spot where the ball will next be put in play, or when the Referee signals for the 25-second Play Clock to start."  Instead of making it easy for the Umpire to place the ball down at the spot, Dak Prescott and the Dallas Offensive Line hinder him, not once but twice.   Dak Prescott and the Dallas Offensive get an F for situational awareness.  The Umpire did his job and followed the rules.
skip how can you defend the Cowboys last call?  The cowboys tried to decide the line of scrimmage??? Weird you are a profession ignoring the rules.
Y'all full of it.
Horse face he tackle him because it's football not college football horse face
Skip the referees robbed us they knew what they were doing right off the bat they took the Cowboys right out of a game I ain't never in my life seen a referee run from the back of the field and get in the middle of the ball when they pinch the hike it and move it back that was crazy
The clock was off by 2 seconds! When the Niners called a timeout at 38 seconds, 2 seconds were mysteriously added giving the Cowboys 40seconds🤷🏽‍♂️
Heck pokeyfans had their surrender towels in full force..
I already knew they would choke man so I didn't even watch. Its become a regular thing and they been my team since I was 12. Im bout to tell America they can have em, start supporting the goat n gronk
The clock running out was on Dak the Dunce. The idiot should’ve known the Ref gets the ball, LMAO!!!
Shannon was the one arguing that Dak deserved to get paid?
Man, they been embarrassing them selves, shooot
Fhorse face Shannon shut up loud mouth hater
Skip is soo pathetic trying to blame anyone but dak. Dak stood in the refs way and handed it to the center not the ref. What typical pathetic cowboy fan. Raiders actually got ripped off and they don't mention it once lol
Skip Skip Skip take your time and say it.
I love this show! Hilarious. Skip - you didn't let us down
Jimmy G did try to help the Cowboys🤷🏽‍♂️😂🤣
Shay ripping on skip 😂😂😂 he said I was just at peace 😂😂😂😂😂
Who Shannon’s favorite team ?
😂THE BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS
Skip’s eyes says it all 😂
Prrrgrfrrg R
🤣
For more information visit 🤪
Cowboys need a new coach, a new quarterback, and most especially, A NEW OWNER!
Super Bowl with cowboys...next year? for the 35th time in a row....lol🤣
Poor Skip can't face the reality. That run play was the dumbest call in history.
For everything Dak does great he makes up for it with missed passes and bad choices. What does losing tell you with receivers like the Cowboys have. Time to get a quarterback with equal talent.
The cowboys sucked the entire game but they only lost cause the ref didn’t give them a chance lol
Lol super gremlin WE COULD HAVE BEEN SUPASTARZZZZZZZZ
It's always hilarious when arrogance gets owned. And there aren't any other fans more arrogant then Cowboy fans.
I’ve been saying all year the Cowgirls would be one and done!!! I’ve been saying for several years that Dak was overrated and Jerry Jones shouldn’t have gave him that big contract!
skip had a million dollars  on them boys ml:(((
Skip want to chill on the pain pills.
QB draw with 12 seconds…🤔😂🤣
Skip looks boutta he boutta hit shannon w the hard er 💀💀
They aren't more physical than the Niners they are one of if not the most physical team in the league
Actually the Niners seem ripe and poised for a deep run
I bet skip knows the exact number of cans shaye owes him lmao
Them boys made skip quit the show lmao
If the cowboys had a run game they would've won
Jenny laughing at shaye a lil TOO hard lmao
Shannon "I GOT YOU I GOT YOU"😆 lol
Skip's rage was even funnier!
Can you believe what brady could do with that Cowboys tean
Was that not a hold on Micah parsons on the first T Drun clear as day? The refs allowed the 49ers to gain momentum while throwing flags anytime cowboys had anything going it’s irrelevant now neither team will beat GB or TB
My motto is always bet against the cowboys 🤣
The years of having McCarthy in greenbay he killed so many years when the packers should’ve at least made a super bowl appearance but like always he plays conservatively and not for a win
McCarthy needs to be fired asap and hire Dan Quinn
The official needed to do absolutely nothing differently then he would would do on any other play. If he sprints when he has never sprinted before, he should be fired for unfairly helping one team. Skip is out of his mind. The offensive line blocked the official from getting to the ball, the Cowboys are fortunate that he tried so hard to get to the ball. The official was supposed to just touch the ball instead of putting it on the correct spot? Everything Skip said about this was wildly off base.
Cowboys can still make it to the Super Bowl if they buy their tickets now.
The cowboys were not prepared.  Jerry Jones said the cowboys were ready because they were all healthy.  True.  That does not mean they were prepared.  Jerry Jones best asset is his biggest weakness.  His business skills.  He gets the best talent is certain areas.  Top dollar.  Jerry Jones then gets the best deals in other areas.  Good for business and it is risky for a super bowl run.  After zeke Elliot got injured he lost a step.  Jerry decided he did not need that step zeke lost or it was insignificant. Business wise it got them to the playoffs.  12-5!  The defense and the passing game bailed them out all year long when Elliot had a bad  game.  Zeke had a bad game against the 49ers.  The defense showed up.  The passing game was great but not enough to bail them out.  Jerry Jones needed to spend a little money for that extra pop he likes so much.
Just you wait guys! Next year it's gonna be the Clownboys year! Dak will rise once again from his pile of undeserved money and embarrass the city once again!
Why even talk about the last play? We had 2:30 minutes and 3 time outs left and couldn't get it done. What makes you think we could do it with 4 seconds  Disgusting performance I have officially given up on this franchise. Jerry Jones doesn't respect his fans. All he cares about is money end his ego.
You know I didn't hear Micah parsons 1 time this show? 7 from haven we got him and you don't. I'm so glad the cowboys lost
The cowboys numbers are over inflated cuz it came against bad teams so those numbers are gonna look good.
He actually said he’s wrong ?
SKIP IS SOO FUNNY WHEN HES SCREAMING UPSET
Typical cowboy fans, blame everybody else apart from themselves! Had enough time to clock the ball, but Prescott gives the ball to the centre, why not give the ball to the umpire!!! That sums the cowboys up!! Go 9ers
Shannon sharpe is like a parody of himself
HOW ‘BOUT THEM COWBOYSSSS?!?!
I quit being a cowboys fan after that game . They played like trash and destroyed every chance they had of winnnin (many were given!)
“Just like 90% of the Cowboys fans were crying.” -Shannon 😂
These sports commentators need to be refereees
IT'S 2 THINGS IN LIFE THAT NEVER DELIVER ON SUNDAY, THE MAILMAN AND DA DALLAS COWBOYS 😂😂😂
To bad the Muleboys couldn't of played the Eagles. They step outside of there division they lose most of the time This is  B E A U T I F U L  😂 🤣
Skip mad 😂
“The Cowboys are gonna do Cowboys things” will forever hit different after that QB draw 😆😂
Unc just served a plate full of truth and heartbreak. Hot L sauce on the side 😆
😆 America cheers when America's Team loses
Cowboy fans there is no crying in football
I hear all the arguments for the last play of the game with 14 sec left. as I watched the game I saw the game clock added about 15 sec to play within the last minute of the game. Thats shady
Jenny looking better than ever yall sheesh 😍
For anyone saying it was funny when the ref ran after saying the game is over. The reason he ran was because the team that lost was a home team, also could have caused alot of ruckus and damage to referee’s
Only one team can win the prize at the end everyone else are equally failures. Lol people just have personal feelings towards certain teams who always have a swagger about them.
America’s Team because even the haters tune in every single game and know more about them then their own teams lol
49ers is America’s TEAM 💯😤😎🤫
Typical cowboys fan blaming everyone expect his team dak was suppose to give the football the ref so he can set it down instead he gave it to the center to set and that ref was sprinting trying to save the cowboys season and they still ridicule him romo was even yelling at them that the ref has to set it but sure blame him when your team played bad 3 and half quarters of the game
Skip HE called you out like a grown 👨!
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
Skip:"My team led in points and yards and turnovers!"  Yeah well they didn't lead on the scoreboard in this game now did they Skippy?
I swear the skip and shannon show is just trying to mimick stephen A smiths gimmick….
We won’t get anymore HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYZ 🤣🤣🤣 sorry skip lmao
You think skip would learn dang!
I enjoyed the fans fighting more than the game. Wow 🙃
he always do good in the 4th because that's when the defense loosen up a little. Dak is mediocre, just like jimmy g. Dude is no where close to mahome, Brady, Roger's level.
Jesus Shannon just cut the best WWE promo in the last ten years.
Has a Giants fan, I have to say please keep Mike McCarthy! With that talent they should at less be in the NFC championship game.
This week on: "At Home With Baker Mayfield." Baker invites an NFL team over for a Playoff watch party.  Baker: "Boy those Cowboys sure do binge after a big L." "You think they'd be used to this by now!"  Hahahahahahaha!  Happy "Big L Day" Skimpstress. That big bad ref pushed my offensive lineman out of the way.😥 That in itself speaks volumes about  your offensive line!
The 49ers are the more talented team. We have 2 starting lineups of dl! That alone makes us the most talented team in football.
So referees got away with this versus "time management"
I'm just a disappointed eagles fan here. What we did was way worse than cows despite of rookies in charge.
那么，当时的分封机制是什么呢？就是把华夏民族各个宗族联合起来，统一建立一个中央政府，叫做“周”，把统治全国的领袖叫做“天子”。天子这个名称不详细解释了，从中国古代宗教性的说法，代表替天行道。  周朝建立中央政府以外，也把全国其他的各个宗法社会团结在一起，这个叫“家”。譬如，在山西某个地方都是姓李的，或者在河南某个地方都是姓王的；李家有李家的传统宗法，王家有王家的传统宗法，陈家有陈家的……中国的姓很多，每一个祖先传下来，聚族而居，形成宗法社会。所以，古代宗法社会的治理，叫做“齐家”。周朝把每一个大大小小的宗法社会，根据领导（政权）的力量，以及土地、人民的数量这三个条件，分封成一个国家，这就叫诸侯。  我们要知道，周朝的分封是蛮平等的。至于“不是同姓不封王”，这是秦汉以后家天下的制度。譬如，汉朝刘邦当了皇帝，封王的必须是刘家的子孙，别家不行。周朝不是这样，周朝是尊重每个宗法社会，你有土地、人民、领导的能力（政权），就算一个国家，封为一个诸侯。周朝把几千年来，轩辕皇帝以后，尧、舜、禹这些帝王的后代，乃至各个宗法社会的后代找出来，看他们在哪里，还有多少人。还有万把人的，好，也算一个国家。这也就是春秋时孔子说的“兴灭国，继绝世”，把过去断了、灭了的，都找出来封。譬如，鲁国是周公的后代，齐国是姜太公的后代。因为姜太公功劳最大，所以土地面积上齐国比鲁国大。当时山东、胶东这一带，都属于齐国，鲁国是在济南这一带；其他像宋，是殷朝的后代；楚是南方的国家，很大，长江以南都是楚，当时文化还没开发。照这样看来，周天子并不是只封给自家的后代，周文王姓“姬”，后来的“周”姓，也是他的后代。我们现在讲滕文公，滕国在鲁国的南面，更小哦！是封给周文王第十四个儿子叔绣的，滕文公就是姬叔绣的后代。至于周朝建立诸侯，具体是多少个，究竟是一千多，还是八百，现在很难考据确定。  这样分封很多诸侯国，但是精神的领袖只有一个，就是中央政府，周朝周天子。诸侯国的交通、文字、文化等等，并没有像后世那么完全统一哦！是各自管理，但是也相通的。换一句话说，周朝的分封建国，不是什么西方由奴隶社会这样过来的封建。拿现在西方文化的观念讲，它是一个“联邦组织”，各个诸侯联合，尊奉中央周天子，这就是周朝分封诸侯大概的形态。可以说，周朝分封是很平等的，所以，孔孟之道推崇尧、舜、禹的公天下是第一，其次呢，周朝是比较民主、公平的联邦政治。
We’ll, this is a program I’ll never watch again - all that screaming - ugh!
Poor Skip. Lol
Can we just admire how slick and clean those lenses on Shannon's glasses are?
I’m so happy the Cowboys lost … it makes it easier to swallow the Eagles loss toTampa Bay
I say again excuses excuses!! Stop Skip they just lost!!
Super Gremlin 😈😈😈
“It’s bad football….I blame that on head coach *Drop the mic* McCarthy” 😂😂😂 ~Skip
How bout them GalBoys
Skippppppp
Cowboys had no business losing that game.
I thought merry go round went in a circle.  Don't recall one that went up and down
For all this cowboy talk from skip and the complaining about how they should play, he should go interview for the coaching job himself
Dak Prescott is Don Meredith 2.0, 'nuff said.  As a Packer fan, I'm laughing at the Cowboys because of " Big Mac", 😂 Shannon was right, Favre and Rodgers made "Big Mac and fries" look good. Look at Big Mac's record when Rodgers was out hurt.  Now you all Cowboys fans know it's nothing but smoke-n-mirrors! 😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I think we're focusing tooo much on what Cowboys did and didn't do!!! How about that damn 49ers Defense!!!!Yeah
Super gremlin Kodak black reference lol
Get Harbaugh, keep Zach Martin on the o-line, replace or at least get 3-4 more lineman in this off-season. Put the best men in and let's go. Demote Tyron Smith his fragility is just hurting the possible camaraderie that this unit needs.
The Jones’s are the problems with Dallas
I can watch this segment all day long... I love it when Skip is eating his words. 😂😂😂
NOT EVEN SSKKIIIUUPP can defend the Cowboys
Refs are in the NBA and The NFL  Umpires are in the MLB  C'mon guys it's not that hard
Skip Bayless proves once again what an unmitigated idiot he really is….
As a packer fan I enjoyed this.  McCarthy at his best haha
Waiter, there’s a fly twitching in my soup!” “And what do you expect for the price? A ballet?!”
Its funny how cowboys players and their fans blame the ref on the last play who did nothing bad for them. That culture has to change imo.
I could never see myself ever being a cowboy fan what is there to like about
LMAO!! THESE GUYS NEEDED THE LARRY FITZGERALD TRAINING!! 🤣🤣
Are they even sponsered by mountain dew?😂
Dak Prescott lost the game for the Cowboys
Shannon did a good job breaking it down
They are what they have always been. A mediocre, self hyped, ovepaid, undisciplined team.
49 ers where a bad match up for the Cowboys... real bad
Skip wrong for brining up that mans job
Jenny looking more fine than usual.
Shannon straight up roasted Skip on National Television
The refs gave do many chances to this loser cowboys and still Dak Prescott blames them For his own debacle !!!!!!!!!!!!’
Why does Fox 90% of the time not show the play when Skip asks to see ‘x’ play and he has no idea the rest of us don’t see anything LOL
Skip is a disgrace as an analyst ! He  is supposed to give a balanced view of the teams and give respect to the other teams strengths rather than always touting his horn  “ my favorite team cowboys “ . He is a SORE loser …….
40 seconds to 54 seconds skip on a perc
"Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong"
😢 😎! 💯 K for 🏆 and they 💦 it away!
Prescott a periennal chocker...get rid of him...he sucks!!!
What people fail to realize is the 49ers have pretty much the same team from 2019!! With the division we are in makes the 49ers battle tested!! People are going to stop trying the 49ers like they are bums!! People fail to realize the amount of injuries they have endured not only this year but in the 5 years!! And yet they fight and don't use excuses when they loose!!! The score does not justify the 49ers running it down there throat!! Just because ur team looks good on paper doesn't mean your team will win a championship!!! And cowboys fans need to understand that!!! Maybe one day the cowboys will learn to beat other teams other than the weak East!!!!!!
nope skip, it's not the umpire's fault. Dak should have handed the ball to the ref right away instead of his center.
5:17 😂😂😂
Cowboys are the Chargers of the NFC. Lots of talent but always choke and underperformed when it matters
Dak should have been looking for the umpire the second he slid. This is on his lack of situational awareness. Or maybe the coach for not remembering to tell his QB that during the time out.
720p WTF?
"Cowboys are a better team"  (when they get to pad their stats against the NFC East). 49ers play against the Rams, Cardinals and Seahawks. I bet the last-place Seahawks would have won the division if they played in the NFC East.
Cowboys played horrible i knew they wouldnt win a playoff game 49ers took the opening drive n walked right threw them i knew they were done right there diggs had a great season but they missed 2 wide open tds where he got beat on double moved dak chocked n mccarthy is thr worst situational coach in football im a giants fan but im just being honest n now they owe zeek n hes old dak is way overpaid they done all down hill from here lol
On to the next season. Lower your shoulder and keep pushing forward.
Ive waited for this one. 🤣 Soon as that game ended I instantly thought of Sharpie's gloating and Skippys bitching and poor Jenny caught in the middle. 🤣
That overthrow to Aiyuk was both of their fault. Jimmy G assumed that Aiyuk would've kept running up the field (which Aiyuk should have), instead of sitting on the end of the route. If Aiyuk kept running up the field, then Jimmy hits him over the top and in stride. If he kept running up the field, Aiyuk had open grass for a touchdown. An Aiyuk touchdown on that play is the nail in the coffin, which is a different game at that time and the boneheaded interception by Jimmy G never happens. That overthrow to Aiyuk was bad, but it wasn't all on Jimmy. With that being said, Aiyuk absolutely burned Diggs on that route.
This nasal sick voice suits Skips silly villain character perfectly😂😂😂
Lol lmbo
Qb draw with 14 seconds left on the clock. Cowboy things.
I know Christmas was less than a month ago, but this is Christmas day for Shannon Sharpe.
And what about the bum broncos Shannon likes it sweet keep bending over
DAK is generally TERRIBLE, stop giving these QBs that were terrible this weekend credit for getting yards late in the game when the other team is in a semi PREVENT defense!
How can you not think we’re americas team after this lmaooo
Lmao. I love watching the Cowboys lose.
Shannon shut up , skip hit this one on the money , that official cost us that last second chance
Hey Skip your always wrong dude. Shannon made ya look stupid again. As the Cowboys did what they always do get beat in the playoffs.
Skip. Please stop jynxing the Cowboys. Every year.
You can't make this stuff up, but the cowboys lost in the most cowboy way possible.
Yo why didn't you show the plays !
Skip is complaining about the coin toss now? What would have happened if they didn't defer, they would have gone 3-Out, just like the next few successive drives.
drip bayless is a legend
Dallas cowboys are the joe biden of football.
Grown man crying on national tv is sad ... Skip is a beta male smh
That wasn’t even close game!! Should been blowout
They bums skip Bayless and yk it 😂😂😂
Cowboys have great talent, but theyre very young and have no experience in the playoffs, also kinda cocky/arrogant with all the pregame talk.. Maybe this Loss will be good for them in the future, but they have to hold themselves accountable instead of pointing fingers at the refs and humble themselves.  The Niners had that playoff experience, veterans and they literally had nothing to lose and everything to gain in this game.. They barely qualified to make a playoff run in the final regular season game, in overtime!  If Niners knock out Green Bay, I will be so happy to knock out the number one seed, people will be shook!  This upcoming game against the Packers could be the "Superbowl" before the Superbowl..  People forget that the Packers beat the Niners earlier this season by two points, because of a field goal led by Aaron Rodgers and his clutch ability with less than one minute on the clock!
All I gathered from this is skips wife could could cheat as much as she wants and skip will find a way to excuse her whereabouts
Man bruh Dallas luccy they got what they Got cuhz the game was supposed to been over
Nobody to blame here it was a rebirth season, dak was injured last year, this year he's healthy, he's back, and looked good till that int happened. But also a team full of young talent with some vets mixed in, I think they'll be alright and learn that if they wanna be the big dog you gotta beat the top caliber teams in your conference.
Mike Mccarthy did a great job this year, any other coach they miss the playoffs, he should be COTY
So there not going talk about the Cincinnati Bengals going the playoffs
Skip's just wrong on the facts.  When the ref ran down and made contact with Dak they were NOT all lined up and ready.  There was a receiver dawdling back from downfield - still on the other side of the line.  And how does Skip not know that Dak is supposed to HAND THE BALL TO THE REF and not place the ball down himself and put his team down in set???  The ball doesn't get placed by the QB or the center.  Skip knows this!!  The ref SHOULD HAVE taken the ball and moved everyone BACK 1 1/2 yards to the 26 or 25.5 yard line where Dak first dropped down.  The game should've been over during the process of the ref walking the ball BACK to where it SHOULD HAVE been placed.  As another NFL player said, if they practiced that in drills like they said they did, then they're supposed to leave a gap between the center and the guard for the ref.  THERE WAS NO GAP.  The ref HAD TO bump and push to get to the ball.  The ref shouldn't have had to FIGHT to get to the ball.  Skip is completely WRONG in his thinking.  That block of the ref was that O-line's best block of the whole game - stupidly preventing the ref from trying to help them.  And they were all off-sides and encroaching the neutral zone, bending over the ball, when they snapped it.  NO WAY did that team deserve seconds to be put back on the clock.  NO WAY did that team deserve to be in the playoffs.  They needed to be bounced out for being so FUNDAMENTALLY undisciplined.  That last buffoonery was just a microcosm of their total lack of team cohesion and discipline the whole game.  Shame on Skip for making those BOGUS arguments!  They simply were not a playoff-caliber team (despite their glowing stats, inflated due to a weak schedule).
I would have rather took my chances of 2 hail marys then try to get closer and only have 1 chance..does anyone remember Aaron Rogers..he actually threw hail Mary that was over 50 yards..now maybe dak can't trow it over 50 yards..if that's the case..then he needs to go..but either way..if he would have tried to throw 2 hail marys..maybe there could have been some kind of defense penalty..the LAST thing I would have ever done with so little time and no time out would have run it in mid field..my 5 year nephew knows not too do that..I will say though..the only question I would really like to know..why was the referee so far away after the play..the obvious thing would to be running with them..don't they have more than referees..they could have someone else touch the ball..just saying 🤔
There's no blaming the ref. If the ref was doing his job, he would've backed the line up two yards and made everyone reset. He gave them a chance and they still ran outta time.
Skips facial expressions all video long🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It’s ok, because we gonna see how Shannon’s sorry Lakers look come Playoff time, that is if they even get to the Playoffs
Cowboys play calling is TERRIBLE the run game was working very well for them and they continued to throw the football to much
Love the title of this video. 'Cowboys  STUNNED by 49ers....' The only ones stunned are the media the delusional Cowboys fans. Everyone else picked the 49ers to win. GET IT RIGHT UNDISPUTED!!!
I can't wait for next season's Cowboys first round playoff loss.
Poor Skip, looks like he was going to explode with a massive heart attack. Shannon at his best.
There should have never been that much time left.  Refs gave the cowboys extra seconds in the Niners last possession
Hahaha it’s the refs job to sprint like usain bolt and then backflip like a superhero and spot the ball?  And skip, the ref needs to just touch the ball, not spot it?   Hahahahaha so the cowboys center gets to spot the ball where he wants hahaha.  Anyone who thinks the refs did anything even slightly wrong is insane.
Damn Shannon a savage on this one! 😳
You can't make this up the Cowboys create ways to choke
"The nectar of the Gods!" 😆👌
Just out of curiosity why are they not studio together?
12:46 Quit lying to yourself Shannon, this season alone on September 26th when the Packers took on the 49ers there is footage of an official sprinting down the field while the play is still going on just to get there in time to allow Green Bay to spot the ball.
Who here likes Minecraft?
I had been saying it since they got that butts handed to em by the Broncos!!!! OVERRATED!!! They were .500 against WINING TEAMS! They had lost to 4 of the teams in the playoffs in this season, and only beat 1, the joke of a playoff team Eagles. The Cowboys had a bloated record due to getting 6 wins against their divisional opponents. Trevon Diggs is overrated, Micah Parsons overrated (anyone who compares him to the Giants Linebacker legend is overrated.
I could understand if Skip called in sick today to avoid facing Shannon in the studio.
Cowboys feasted on garbage NFC East teams. Bunch of cupcakes in that division. Skip acting real salty 😂
I thought Skip passed away years ago when he tried to be a reporter for the Mercury News.
Cry, whine, snivel, cry some more, whine some more!  Booo Hooo.  Hey, how about DAK DA DUMBSHEEEEET hand him the football.  Duh!
Dak is a garbage QB! I knew the Cowgirls were gonna choke and take the L. I can’t believe Jerry paid him the max? I would have traded him or let him walk...
So it sounds like Shannon’s saying 49ers sounds like some damn tattle tails 🤣, telling the refs to watch for something, just play the damn game isn’t that what everyone always says, don’t put it on the refs or in their hands, granted Dallas made some boneheaded penalties hence Randy Gregory. This is to funny though.
See those veins in Skips neck!!  WOW those were about to POP!  Love it!
Lmao you know skip lost hundreds of thousands betting on the 🤠 dak ran too far, need to go outa bounds, to stop clock.
It didn’t really matter. The winner has to play Green Bay in Lambeau field.
skip sold them boys to the media now jumped ship smh
Skip is so pale it looks like he has that COWBOYS COVID... LMAO
Did he actually really believe they were going to the Super Bowl???????
Cowboys yall shouldah knows yall lost the game before it even started. 49rs comin out the locker room with Kodakkkk BUMPIN with DEEBO and WILLIAMS leading the charge..... that was game right there
BUMS!
Help me understand how coach is responsible for recording breaking 14 penalties.
I bet kyle shanahan doesn't have to motivate his boys for a playoff game, yea mccarthy is at fault for the cowboys starting the game like soft tissue paper but if NFL players should be able to motivate themselves for a huge playoff game, jerry writes big checks to anyone and everyone and they don't play hard because they haven't proven anything to get the check. As far as skip saying the cowboys are a better team it's false the 49ers clearly have the better talent on there team.
I love seeing the cowboys fans suffer
That was the most Cowboy ending to a game I’ve ever seen. They could’ve had three shots at the end zone & instead they called a run play & ran out of time.      😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  How TF is McCarthy an NFL coach???
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Stupid cowgirl fans lmao
49ERS AMERICAS NEW TEAM
Mike McCarthy is a plant.  Sent to Dallas to fool Skip Bayless into thinking he's the savior.  He's Satan.  Signed, A. Rodgers.
The Cowgirls are who we thought they are!  Suck!
Skip trying to blame the refs cuz the Cowgirls completely choked YET AGAIN 😆😂🤣😆😂🤣😆😂🤣
Befunga
She is really beautiful
Stop crying skip. The ref didn't loose the game
Why they are not in the studio..
You can hear skips thoughts lol
the cowboys only scored 17 because of a jimmy g interception which if never thrown the cowboys would've only score 10
They need to trade Dak for Deshaun Watson
So Dak started his slide at the 27 yard line, ok.. then he gives the ball to his center and his center spots the ball at the 24.. so even if they get the snap off they are 3 yards offsides so blaming the refs is the dumbest thing of all time..
Damn why skip had to dox the refs job like that? like there's enough psychos outthere that willingly could seek to hurt the oficial over a football game
The cowboys just shot themselves in both feet over and over again
Skip always flip flopping
I am a cowboys fan....and I agree with shannon...and I don't normally like his takes.
Skip needs to lay off the diet mountain dew edit: Shannon is so funny man he really let skip know how he feels lmao
😭
No one mentioned  that in 11 years they have not progressed in the finals. They have the record. Lol
Skip and the rest of the Cowboi fans  gone be WRONG  WRONG WRONG  WRONG  WRONG  WRONG WRONG  WRONG WRONG  WRONG WRONG  WRONG  next season as well just like the last 20 plus seasons
He say he super gremlin 🤣 he fw dat yak
Skip talking about 12-5.  12-5? Ya, in the NFC East. Cowboys a .500 or less team in any other NFC division.  Oh, and the ref bowls over your QB because your 75 million dollar QB was too stupid to remember to give the damn ball to the ref to spot it.
Watch amazing short of food
Dak shouldve had it in his head to drop as soon as he passed the 30 instead of getting as many yards as he could. Tick, tick,tick, tick...
49ers has way more talent on there roster. Idk what skip was saying about them cowgirls are a better team. We also have better coaching staff and GM. Can't wait till Saturday and see my team beat up on the Packers. If Bosa and Warner show up. It's going to be a great game for us. I'm also glad Lance gets a feel for the playoff environment for next season.
He didn't get to the ball because it was the only time the Cowboys blocked
Dak slid at the 25 1/2 line. The center was holding the ball at the 23. Center doesn’t spot the ball skiuuuuup
49ers where the better team plain and simple...They had more proven playoff experience, played tough games all season in the toughest division in football that prepared them...They would have gone 14-3 easily in the weak NFC east....Boys got unlucky facing a injury riddled team just hitting there stride
Skip is such a sore loser. Take your L like a man.
Thanks Shannon for give the 9ers some credit and recognition...(I am 9ers fan) If Jimmy doesn't throw that INT worst case scenario we punt ..cowboys then would have drive a longer field for possible points . And at the same time burn time of the clock on that drive...Jimmy missing a Wide open Aiyuk .... Kyle not going for it on one of those 2 4rh n 1 deep in Dallas territory. I think one was in the redzone ..(credit dallas d on that. Forcing Kyle to make a tough  decision..Kyle went with the 2 FG....score should've been 31-10 ..Either way 9ers won Boys loss..😀😀
How are you blaming hands to the face penalty on the head coach.  Players play, false starts are also on the players, they are grown men!
Zeke played with a bad knee received most of the snaps when  you have a healthy  , explosive Tony Pollard you could be giving the carries to ! That's just stupid ! This is why the Cowboys are where they are right now ! Home watching everybody else.  All this damn talent and you still get the same result ! I just don't get it 😕 They played like bums Sunday.
I would love to hear Stephen A. lay into Skip. Skip wines like a typical Cowgirl fan. Shannon knows what's up. Go Niners!!! Beat the Packers Saturday!!
I feel sorry for all the fans ? I thought the giants and jets were hated !
Whatever makes skip the most miserable is what I am interested in
skip calling someone else a crybaby is rather funny
Daks numbers in the fourth were those 3,4 plays sf gave him, he sucked.  We were even missing our 2 best defenders.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life9
The Cowboys need to rework Dak Prescott’s deal.   He really is a mediocre QB, at best
BUMS...LOL LOL LOL LOL LOW BLOWS
Skipppppppppp Skipppppppppppp 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄🤣🤣😂37 cases
I knew this team wasn't going far since after the results vs Broncos & a out of form Cardinals. You have to be very, very skeptical in every aspect of the Cowboys, on the field and the organization, no matter what hyped up talent they have
This deserved to be an "in studio" episode bc i know Shannon wouldve went overboard lol
DAK SHOULD HAVE LOOKed FOR A REFEREE TO GIVE THE BALL TOO.
Damn this is hard to watch.
So Skip is placing blame on the ref too...typical...cowboys fans relect their team...weak and full of excuses
That young lady was crying with 4 minutes left in the game. 😂
They are not bums.
Cowboy fan here. The zebras were garbage but the loss isn't on them. The Boys were undisciplined, totally unprepared and sloppy af. That's on the coach.  Dak was who he's always been...an almost winner - low football IQ and trash in the clutch. Typical Cowboys doing Cowboy things.  It wasn't all bad because I bet the Niners. Wanted my team to win but I knew they wouldn't cover. Trash is as trash does.
Referees are not on your team. They should not be part of your play.
Skip blameless on his cowboys....priceless😄...  Thanos: that puts a smile on my face.😌😎
Yea lol Shannon please don't get too complicated with skippy bc he has no idea or knowledge about football!  He is a clown who doesn't understand the X's&O's of football!  Bye Bye Clownboys lol
Imagine the cowboys coming out the huddle "1, 2, 3, hefty bags!' 🤣
how to be a loser and get paid 75 million? be a cowboy 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kudos to Skip, he didn't make any excuses, he called his team garbo efforts and i gotta respect that 💯
Hey Skippy, Stafford is going to the 2nd round and the Cowboys are going home/staying home 🤣  And no ur Cowboys are not better than the 49ers as we all just witnessed lol.. There were only 2 teams in the playoffs you were better then, the Eagles & Steelers that's it lol...  See Skippy when u can't beat up on pathetic NFC East opponents you guy's get exposed for the Joke you are!!
That's bs blaming the ref, he basically sprinted to the ball to touch it and ya ran out of time, you never had the chance Skip
Don’t tell me they aren’t in studio because of the watered down COVID🤦‍♂️
take a shot every time he said he was “wrong” about his cowboys
And you know what's worse? All the teams in the NFL, whether they know it or not, are gonna use Dallas as an example on what not to do in terms of placing the football. That's the ref's job, not yours!
Dam the cowgirls
you would think skip shat in shannon's cereal this morning jesus he went at him
Bye Bye Skippy and your always wrong what else is new! Now u can switch all your dumb nonsense to the bucs and brady lol..  Because the Bucs are getting bounced by the Rams!  lol
Did the Niners even play in this game? Judging by the coverage, I'm not so sure.
I don’t know why the word “Stunned “ came up .. if we all knew that the cowboys were going to lose like they always do in all the big games.
Inskip how dare you say that you're impressed with his hater mentality in his racist mentality. You're nothing more than a baby version of him. You suck also and you're just a traitor. You both deserve each other
Why are they not in the studio??
And they lost at home hahaha
Cowgirls fans is the reason I hate the Cowgirls.....never gets old watching Cowgirls lose in the playoffs love it
Cowboys suck
I used to love this show but now I hate it and I know so many people who feel like I do. So maybe your producer should take something away from my comments.
Cowboys the new Detroit
The best show !!!!!!
Niners should've traded for Matt Ryan
I can't stand the QB !!! For the Cowboys
Lmao 🤣 look at skips face 😅 he’s hurting!!
"I would think any QB should be able to run down the field faster than a ref... unless you're tom brady"... hahaha Shannon still got in a Brady dig at Skeeeeeep
Calling that last run play cooked them. With what little time left you don't run it down the middle of the field.
The cowboys fans and knicks fans are the same 😭😭
Instagram should be 2.0 star not 2.9 star because there has to many fake account and fans pages insult normal user!
After learning that in the past 25 years the Dallas Cowboys’ playoff win percentage is .231 which is less than both the NFL w/o a name and the Dolphins, I will never say “How bout dem Cowboys!?!” again until they at LEAST reach the NFC Championship. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
"Oh we got a big bad defense"😂😂😂 "No you don't just take the football and cram it right down their throats"😠😂😂😂
Randy Gregory who works at JP Morgan is the most hated man in Dallas rn. Hope his boss ain’t a cowboys fan 😂.
Shannon was thoroughly enjoying Skip’s rant. 😆😆
Shannon went all in on Skip.. Ha!
49GANG..YAAAH
Why is nearly all of the reporting and commentary about this game from the Cowboys' perspective?  How about giving a little credit to the 49ers?
I’M A COWBOYS FAN … THE TRUTH IS THAT DAK IS TRASH.. DONT WANT TO HEAR IT .. JUST FACTS
“Yeah.. he tackled him because he’s not very good” dead 😂😂
Niners didn’t win. Cowboys just loss. Beat themselves. Idk how they scored even once with how they played. Used 10% of their potential/ ability.
Tuff ending for the cowboys and can we talk about how good that woman looks 😵‍💫
What are the chances you would do a full segment on the Rise & Fall of the Cardinals this season,  from best to playing worse than a pop warner team, no disrepect here. But🤔  I really appreciate you guys,  second to none in all sports    Thanks!
You guys see 11 from heaven get knock tf down by Deebo!!
Shannon said it...Favre & Rodgers made McCarthy...ouch
this is gold!! lmaooo
Skip is delusional... You were never going to Run on the 49ers front 7 🤣 49ers were and are the best Running team with Mitchell and Deebo...  STOOOOP BLAMING THE REF 🤣🤣 TAKE THE 🔥 L.....
These refs be joke too ,
# Diet Mountain Dew....Nectar of the gods # Skip Drip Bayless
Hilarious!  I did not want to miss Undisputed today just to see Sharpe's reaction, but Skip's rage was even funnier!
Cowboys need some form of leadership, this was disgrace
Cowboys lost to The 49ers?  A  FESTIVUS MIRACLE!!!!!
Zeke had 31 yards lol no run game lol
They almost won they just didn't take advantage of things when it went in there favor ,
The love and respect Shannon show's to Skip even when he's trolling him👈🤣 this guy's have nothing but love for each other 👈 Oh, by the way " I'm a DALLAS COWBOYS Fan" !!!!!! And I can tell you " They Suck"!!!!!!!!!!! Period.🤓
How bout them Cowboys! 😂😂😂 we had McCarthy as a coach up here in Wisconsin. So glad he’s gone, coach duh🤪
Bayless eating crow.  Fried crow, boiled crow, roasted crow, stewed crow, sauteed crow, barbecued crow, grilled crow.  Good times.😂
"World 🌎 Class" "Dysfunctional Organization"                🎊 🎉 "Winner" 🎉🎊      🏈Houston Texans🏈  🏆 2019 , 🏆 2020 , 🏆 2021
I thought the Umpire was late to the play- Skip Bayless 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
People cried because of all the money they lost being the favorite
Skip got me not as scared to snort coke at 40 as I was. If you can do it till 70 im good.
U can see the pain and sorrow in skips face
Cowgirls will never win the Super Bowl. Never never ever delusional cowgirl fans. FAKE football team !!!!!!
Like always Skip Bayless you're wrong. What's new ?
Don't worry cowboy fans,the cowboys will get better in about five more years
I don't think Dak snaps out of it. I think the other team let up off the gas😂😂😂😂😂
Shannon Face “ Did You Say They We’re Gone Win 2 Games 👿” 😂😂😂😂🤣
Bro Skip got heated 🔥🔥🔥😂😂
I think it’s crazy that people keep saying that the 14 penalties by Dallas was why they lost the game. The 49ers had 9 penalties that stopped their drives and extended the Cowboys drives. People are acting like it was 14 to 3
Cowboys messed up by punting it on 4th &2nd twice ! They could’ve converted those and gained momentum but like skip said they looked defeated already they had no balls to do anything
THE LAST PLAY WAS DAKS FAULT.. EVERYONE KNOWS TO HAND THE BALL TO THE REFEREE AND NOT YOUR LINEMEN 😂💯🏈
That last play was Daks fault and whoever called the play.. Bec they should of told him what to do on that play n situation..but he should of known what to do so I say it's daks fault... He got up and handed the ball to his linemen and not the referee.. EVERYONE KNOWS TO HAND THE BALL TO THE REFEREE
I can tell Skip was😭😭😭 Last night
Good game it's always fun to talk things over.
Stund who Cowboys never had a chance
The fans had no faith in their team..they where all crying with like 5:00 on the clock..💯😂.. I was watching them like damn that's a eternity of time left in a fb game esp only being down 6
Skip adequately expressed my frustrations with the cowboys. As a fan, I am pleased with skips performance. A small victory after such a disappointing loss.
Deleted by dak running too long:)
Skip has no clue what prevent defense and running the clock is I guess 🤷‍♂️
I think it's time for the Cowboys to part ways with Dak.
I’m living for Shannon 😂
Ahhhhhhhh....I LIVE to see skips teams and players fail. I'm on cloud nine!!!!! 😂😂
I imagine “dew” being thousands of $
Heart attack alert!!!😭😭😭 Let's go Miners!!! Let's handle the cheese heads!!!
Notre Dame's highest priority is to hire a 5 Stars Defensive Coordinator Lawrence Taylor, along with a 5 Stars Offensive Coordinator Jerry Rice to annually sign five 5 Stars Players and attract 5 Stars transfers from Alabama and Miami and Win the National Championship.
Dallas has the better QB but the 49ers has the better RB/WR/TE/OL/DL/OC/DC which is why they won.
Skip: " they have to let us have another shot with 4 seconds"  No Skip, the Cowboys have to play better, the Cowboys have to be smarter in a situation like that, the Cowboys are trash and I've told people this all year ... that's why you lost the game
Always awkward when the cut doesn’t happen to the video
Umpire should’ve spotted ball two yards back if u wanna get technical 😇
Dak ran too long....daks fault.......don't do dat skip:)
Rassss...... SKIP get red, vein ago buss....😅😅😅
Skip actually took the L better than I thought. Wasn’t afraid to look himself in the mirror and admit that the cowboys are  trash .
Yes!!!! Shannon Sharpe RULES!!!!
When the villain gets his comeuppance should've been the title of the video
Yep...two teams that never hold the players accountable for penalties. Raiders and cowboys. Losers till they wise up.
We all been waiting for this 😂
Skip sounds like a whiny Cowboys fan blaming the ref and saying "we were better than the 49ers". There has been very little credit given to the team that dominated for 3 quarters, had a lead the whole game, and won the game!
Cowboys are garbage.   I love it.  It’s like a second Christmas
Anyone else notice from jump how different they looked coming out of the locker room?? 49ers were fired up and relaxed and Dallas looked like they were going to a funeral.
Mountain Dew needs to ✂️  y'all a check for all the free promotion lol  😂
6:40 Shannon lmao the whaaat gets me Everytime!!!!!
Skip sounds real dumb here COME on MAN !!! Dak needed to slide lil earlier and it’s on him ! Point period ( honestly it’s a dumb play call ) considering they had consecutive sideline plays on the drive !!!!! I’m no Cowboy fan , they should’ve thrown the ball . They still would’ve needed a miracle shot at the end zone to win …. People acting like it was at the 10 or5 yard line
Skip the game was done by the 4th quarter what r I talking about 🤔🤔🤔🤔
Dak is a bad quarterback. Bad coaching.
#1 Cowboys fan . The coacj Mike Mc Carthy cant reign them in to play disaplined football.  So what  else is new. Jason Garrett couldn't either. Because Jerry wont let them to lay their hand down when our team to keep penalties down.
I was starting to believe skip until he started with the excuses! Score board skip
Better team won skip!!!
Sucks that this wasn't in person, I woke up just to watch but when I saw it wasn't in person I tuned out. It just isn't the same
Tony Pollard needs to start in 2022 season. Zeke is washed out. Dak is full of excuses and since his injury he has not been the same.
The Cowgirls won in a weak division.  If they were in the west they would have six wins.
Coz there muck Jimmy g won more playoff games then the cowgirls from wit the 90s ahahah
I cherished the moment when Skip said he was wrong over and over again😂😂
I agree Shannon we should have never been in that position
Get him unc. get him. let's go!
No skip ur wrong dak is garbage just like Shannon said we should have never been in that situation
Since I'm getting rid of all the hype, I have an official Zeke jersey for sale no bullshitting, in top tier condition.
Skip we had 14 seconds during that play u need 16 seconds to run that play properly
Lmfao,  keep believing in those Bums
The cowboys should have lost the game but...imagine if the Golden State Warriors were down by two with two seconds and the ref runs into Steph trying to shoot a three?
By looking his face I am so concern that Skip will not be able to finish this segment
All I can picture is Stephen A Smith with a cowboy hat n cigar smiling and screaming HOW ABOUT DEM COWBOYS.  Poor Skip.
Every team that was seeded to have a home game won except for the Cowboys.  It is very hard to be a Cowboys fan right now and for the last last 27 years of mediocrity.
That Cowboys fan needs less Twinkie and cheeseburger time and more gym time. She pushing double and triple chin status.
God can skip and his gold chain just retire. Nobody will miss this hack. He's garbage
This is the first time I've listened to your show this year. I stopped because I was tired of hearing your two shouting all the time. I tuned out at 4:31 and don't plan to take your information for the rest of the season.
Skip finally said it at the end they weren't ready to play. Takes you back to the week before where they were living it up breaking records chasing stats against 3rd stringers. Every team in the NFL packs it in and focuses on the playoffs except dallas it cost them. That's on Jerry Jones. Emphasis is not on winning its on perception and numbers and records its a rotten culture from top to bottom. They let Dak leave week 18 feeling like he was invincible with no preparation for the playoffs no focus no humility its frankly a disgrace.
Maybe Jerry really did make a deal with the devil to win a SB after firing Jimmy and he’ll never get another one as long as he lives
Shannon is right, if the Niners had another QB, they would have lost by 30. Jimmy is feast or famine. I’m glad he got the team ahead before he started to fall apart in the second half.
I hate Shannon 😭😭 DC4L
O now it’s the coaches fault again uh lol
Now they can lead us to golf course, Skip
"But hares the thing". Lol
Love the fact the cowgirls are GONE!!!!!
its alright cowboy fans you for sure got it "NEXT YEAR" 😅
Win lose DC4L
Cowboys will never win the big game 🤣 Time to get a new owner that’s knows football and isn’t a racist 😂
I picked the 'pokes by 27-26 over the Prospectors. Glad I was wrong. Funny thing that both Garoppolo's and Prescott's last plays were tech errors. Prescott's - possibly - cost them the game and certainly Jimmy G.'s came within an eyelash of doing it as well with his false start.  Whatchagonnado?  Oh, and Dak is a cry baby - a poor sports cry baby - the worst kind.
Crying about the ump at the end of the game... Give me a break. A better team wouldn't have been in that position. Our cowboys just plain blew it.
lmao Shannon talking about how great he slept
Skip you want some whine with that cheese.
Skip was NEVER WRONG about the Dallas Cowboys. The Dallas Cowboys NEVER EVER proper game planned DAK PRESCOTT for that game properly. That Oline was not coached for the game. It's not about the 49ers front line. It was about the Dallas Cowboys an ENTITY who has won super bowls with Troy the man Aikeman. And emmit Smith. And deion Sanders. And Mike Irvin.  NEVER WOULD THE COWBOYS GO INTO A PLAYOFF GAME AND NEVER RUN EMMIT SMITH. NEVER NEVER NEVER. the cowboys never ran their running back. They never put the ball in their te and wrs hands to win the game. Dak was hit and rushed and hit and faced blown Assignments after blown Assignments after blown Assignments. The cowboys Jerry Jones did not put up the cash to win. Jerry did not seek the high entity vets for advice on game day preparations. Dak did not get the proper advice any other white QB would get to win. Dak was throwing tight spirals in that game. Dak skills were there. The origanization let Dak DOWN. the d was on point. They were never coached to that particular game. The d stopped the run game. They is stout. They got the coverage to stymie the pass game Pat MaHomes exposed Jimmy G as a QB who can't win off the pass game. They never prepared the TEAM TO WIN. SET UP.
Damn Shannon u down 37 cases 😬😬 sheesh lol
The ref was so stunned about that and play call  that he forgot to run forward until the play was over
Someone tell Einstein the Raiders are not in Oakland
HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS
WE LOVE YOU  SKIP!!!!!!!! COWBOY FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!
8:14 skips cardiologist is drooling
shannon’s in studio you can tell, it’s crazy how low budget shows are when they aren’t in studio
Cowboyz going to the Superbowl.....SIKE! 🤣
10:51 Shannon: YOU GOT TO LET HIM GET THROUGH SKIP, YOU GOT TO LET HIM GET THROUGH !!!!!!!!!!! 😄😆
Skip is a joke trying to pin that last play on the umpire. Dak needed to hand the ball directly to the ref, not his center.
Rayne Rayne go away! Frauds
Prescott is just another average quarterback just like Romo was and just like D. White was.
Jerry Jones ruined the Cowboys
Skippy thinks 50 to 60 year-old refs should be able to run as fast as world-class athletes in their 20s.
Bayliss is in full “coulda, shoulda, woulda” mode.
"They're bums. And this hurt."  Yeah that pretty much sums it up.
Shannon was 100% dead nuts accurate on the Cowboys allllllll year long! I’m a Cowboys fan and you can’t argue with the facts.
They need to play to their "Strength's" 💪 Run the Ball!!! they trying to make it All about "Dak" so he can be the "Hero" Dak is (Average) mix that with the Running Game Dam who is the Star or get All the Credit "Run" 🏃 the Ball!!! Im not a Dallas Fan but to Me they should have Won that Game (Dez) the X was right about Dak he's a Big (Baby) 👶 with a Big (Ego)!!! Jerry Jones is "Heated" somebody got to Go!!! Watch ⌚ the Head Coach "Outta There" Jerry gone "Drag" Dak...Dallas did Look good this past Season they still got a Future Team Squad change the way Dak plays or Trade him they need a Little Adjusting and Ego Check😎they have a Good Squad...
Pre-snap penalties are a lack discipline.
Love when you upload ❤️❤️ Stay safe everyone!!
Mike McCarthy is horrible I said it when he 1st hired him
LMAO the best defensive block by the Cowboys was Dak blocking the ref to end the game!
No stunning, they suck
Hella funny that they put homegirl in the thumbnail, she *Instantly* became a meme 🤣 🤣🤣🤣
They trending #2
They cut their own throat.
Im so happy that da cowboys lost
skip's fault 🤣
Skip you SUCK
Randy Gregory tried to hit the Jake Roberts' DDT.
Skip looks unhappy
Stunned ? Boys led the NFL in penalties this season. Game over.
Why didn't they talk about that the cowboys had the ball at their 16 yard line with 2:42 left and 3 timeouts. Got to the 49er 46 yard line with over 2 minutes left. Prescott is not the guy. If he was the cowboys would of won the game on that drive. All this talk about what happened at the end of the game is dumb. The cowboys lost when they couldn't finish that drive at the 49er 46 yard line. Prescott had his chance for some Cowboy playoff history but proved again that he is no Roger Staubach.
Watch the 2 minute drill in ANY game. Whoever gets tackled with the ball runs and finds a ref to hand the ball to. What did Dak do? He was frazzled and he handed it to his center to pick where the ball should be spotted. Cowboys are nothing but excuses and have no one but themselves to blame
Cowboys didn't beat any team with a winning record except for New England
Words cannot express how happy I am
Why is Shannon yelling?
49ers sucked but the Cowboys sucked worse.  49er fan's think the 49ers beat the Cowboys.... nah the Cowboys beat themselves to the benefit of the 49ers.
Merry go rounds go up and down!! Shannon is crazy
4:45 this is hilarious 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Shannon has held this in fot so long lmaooo
Where are all the Cowboy fans who put Wack Prescott on a pedestal all season long? I thought ya'll said he was the greatest in history, that he'd win the Superbowl and he'd be MVP? I'm a Cowboy fan but I'm realistic and not delusional like most Cowboy fans.
Whole new staff and qb
Who's next moving on 😄
49ers played the Rams twice, the Cardinals twice and the Seahawks twice. They were battle-ready.
why is anyone surprised the cowboys lost.  they didn't win a single game against a team with a winning record during the regular season.
0:17
So I assume this is the last episode of Cowboy's daily with Skip and Shannon until next season ?? 😂 The producers are scrambling trying to find a way to make sure that they can talk for over half the show about the Cowboys every single day until 2022 kickoff..... I'm not even saying they should talk about my team but I stopped watching because 90% of the show is about the Cowboys... Yeah they have a large fan base, but how many Cowboys fans are dying to watch sports talk shows right now??!?! Masochistic fans only I bet...move on guys, Last episode I watched out of 2.5 hours they spent 2 hours on the Cowboys, 20 minutes on Tom Brady and 10 minutes on all other subjects combined.
Prescott should have held onto the ball and give it to the umpire as he was coming up to the line.
With all that talk I think that if they played again this weekend the '9ers would win again. And the Cowboys are my team. 'Best offense in the NFC East but...
Now you know how patroit fan feels
When even Skip doesn’t spin it, you know it’s bad.
Skip is godlike
Couldnt they purposefully commit a penalty to stop the clock ? Even if the clock didnt stop wouldnt the ref be on position to "touch" the ball after the penalty was declined?
We already knew. Skip will blame everyone except his players, coaches, and coaching staff. Dak doesn't know the rules. Dak should have handed the football to the ref... Not put it on the ground... Teams who count on miracles, end up losing games. The Cowboys will do Cowboys things 🤣🤣🤣Skip is suffering, and I love it🤣
I'm a life long cowboy fan,,,and I NEVER EVER SAW ANYTHING  LIKE THAT BURNING DUMPSTER FIRE!!!!! CLEAN HOUSE EVERYONE GOES!!!!
Yassssss
skip I love you man bt at the end of the day the regular season doesn’t matter in the playoffs. We just have to do better smh
8:15
as a cowboys fan. I don’t think I’ve felt so let down like I did yesterday /:
Skip has the eat crow face on
I know this is all part of the entertainment but Skip will save himself the embarrassment of Cowboys demise every year if he wasn't such as delusional fan. Everytime they win during the season he comes next day boasting, and now in the biggest moment they disappoint. I am glad Shannon is there to put him back in his place.
That was a sloppy un impressive playoff game. Looked like preseason at times. Have to wonder what goes on in their minds doing the dumb mistakes that they know from Pop Warner not to do??  Too wierd....
Great show guys
Is Diet Mountain Dew a euphemism for money or do they need to go on and get a sponsorship?
man I love totally worth the wait to see skip try and defend and shift blame, shannon got em good
Skip keeps getting those hormonal treatments…
“Just give me a cowboys loss and pour sumn water on me and I turn to a super gremlin”🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
BS to say it's the ref's fault for being late to the ball.  The Cowboys player should have looked for the ref right away and hand him the ball.  It's the damm QB's fault.  It's easy to blame on somebody when you lose instead of your own demise.
Bwahahaha. You like the play call??? Stupidest play call of the season. You gotta play the sidelines. You can't expect a fer to keep up with the pros.
8:15 i thought skip was gonna have a heart attack
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates. 🎈
I LOVE IT! Skip is the biggest CRY BABY I've ever seen. Thank GOD them stinkin' Cowboys LOST!  "CHIEFSKINGDOM"
Skip Bayless just except the fact that your cowgirls are not going to the Superbowl. You looking worst than the fan's. 😭😭😭😭
"Lord let me open my eyes tomorrow!"- 😷🤣🤪Shannon word up
The only one Sharpe got right.!?!?   Bayless.... It's the only one that matters!!!!
Human integrity + legal gambling = a suckers bet
Skip forgot to say, they also play in the NFL East! 😂🤣😂
4:26 "Underperforming bums. They're bums." -Shannon
Best duo since Muhammad Ali and Howard Cosell...Great stuff LMAO!
As a Cowboys fan, The cowboys deserve every comment Shannon gives in this video. I'm disgusted with this franchise.
lol i love fanboys like bayless. eternally optimistic and never learn. then are stunned when their team gets dunked on.
When I saw Dak sitting on a bench alone in the first quarter after 2 3-and-outs I knew the game was over then. Because he wasn't sitting next to the coach reviewing plays and ways to break down the defensive schemes the 49ers were throwing at them. Awesome quarterbacks don't sit alone. They study even when the game is in full swing.  Dak Prescott is the Alex Smith of the NFC East.
Skip and Cowboys deserve each other. Take the L fool and stop blamin' others for your team's ineptitude. LOL
🤣
Just like Skip, blame it on the refs!  😂
Dak has still not proven that he's worth the $$.  He wasn't worth it before he got it, and he's definitely Not worth it now. It was stupid to cave in and meet his demands.
DAX....sucks........bottom 1/3 QB.......at best.....cant throw.......
Not only Dak not being a great QB, Zeke is no longer a great running back...31 yards in 12 carries.
"We're aMeRiCa's tEaM" 🤣🤣🤣 They right in a sense. This one team can bring the whole country together to laugh at them in unity when they embarrass themselves. 😭😭😭
Skip says the Cowboys are better than the 49ers.  Honestly, they're not. WIth a reasonable quarterback that plays focused every down, the 9ers are a better team. And the defense is better by far.
😂
Jenny is lookin good
Best part of the show was no drip Bayless!  Guess there is a no swag policy when the Cowboys lose in the playoffs, although Shannon is rocking his chain!
Your cowboys' biggest problem is and always has been Jerry Jones since the "Jimmy Johnson" break up. Yes, it is the coaches fault. But because no legitimate coach will work for Jerry Jones. He does everything else right; he just meddles and butts in too much with the coaching of his team. If Jerry Jones really wants to win a SB before he dies, he needs to go sit up in the booth and watch his team win like a regular  owner. Like Robert Kraft, trust the coach that you hired to do the job you hired him to do. It's why Jimmy left. Otherwise, Jerry should just coach the team himself. SMH!!!!
Shannon went STUPID on Skip lmao
No Excuse for Dak Prescott hi have 4 quarter's to score,he waits to the Last minute.he is a failure, next year is going to be  7 years and he can't not win a playoff game,I hope he quits playing football.Jerry jones overpaid Prescott,we don't need him to break records or yards,we need Superbowl s.
The truth is..they must FIRE. the head coach. A team w all those penalties is a reflection of the coach. Where was our running game..(Zeke)? What happen to Dak, did he choke again? What happen to Lamb and Cooper? This game proves that Gallop, is better than both of them. Lastly, the defense has no run stoppers (LB's), and that's a coaching issue too. This team is like a wm your dating that you kn will let you dn at some point.              Shalom.
Go niners
cowboy are better than the Niners? why did the cowboys beat then Niners in Dallas?
Nobody wants to tackle Shannon Sharpe because he had poop in his pants
Dak ran too far past the 1st down marker and that ate up the time
Wow, Shannon.  That was a beatdown!!! Oh, and, DUDE DEM CHOPPERS ARE PHENOMINAL!!!!
I ain’t going to lie, after the loss the only thing I could think of was Shannon and how he was going to put it on Skip 😂😂😂
I had to come see Skips face after his Cowgirls lost! 😂😂😂😂
“CeeDee L’s pile up.” 😂😂😂😂
Skip is delusional
Typical Cowboys and Typical Skip…
100% can see a Dak for Russ trade happening in the offseason.
This is better than some of the games
Shannon acts like the ref did a great job, I bet if it was his precious donkeys he'd be singing a different tune!
Love the giggle, Shannon and the Skiyup!!!
I feel so sorry for all the Cowboys fans.  Jerry Jones is old, with not many years left.  I wanted him to get another Super Bowl before he dies.  Jerry needs a different head coach.
They are hilarious! Shannon’s petty level was at an all time high but it was great to see Skip take it like a champ. I would talk about the cowboys fans delusion but I’m a Ravens fan and we’re just about as crazy as them. 😹😹😹 but who DIDN’T know this was gonna happen with them?? 🤷🏻‍♀️
If skip asks to see a replay LET IT'S SEE IT TOO!!! So annoying to have them go over a specific play yet we can't see it!! Be a better show
UNC killing'em 😂😂😂😂
Love it
I almost feel sorry for Skip
Wow that surprised me. Shannon seems even more rialed up than skip in some points, I thought he would be loving all this and be very calm and just nodding his head to say "I told ya so" maybe hes doing it for dramatic effect.
Crybabies 🤧😪💔🥀😂😂😂😂
Nothing mentioned about Zeke playing with a bum knee.  Why was he playing when you have healthier players that could give you a better chances
How about them cowboys Go Shannon tell the truth
Skip stop making excuses! Our QB is average at best and we’re never capturing the chip with Dak at the helm
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shannon slick he licked his tongue at Jenny and hit her with the I will "HIT" you baby.
Cowboys dump zeke. Way over hyped and paid!
With a general manager they got Dallas are not going anywhere
SKIP -🤠😢🥺  Steven A Smith-😂🤣🤣
first Dak the Wack needs to give the football to the ref idiot
Skip and Shannon act like WWE characters.
look. no excuses. if this was the other way around where Jimmy G did what Dak the Wack did then all you sports caster would be turning Jimmy G down
8:17 This man Skip 😂😂
Dak could’ve just given the ball to the ref…
🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣 expecting the Cowboys to get past the first round with setting anybody up for failure
Skkkkkkiiip!!!!!😂
Why don’t they show the dang replays
The Cowboys would not have scored if they took the ball first either.  We would have fell behind whether we took the ball first or deferred.
Cowboys can't run it down any ones throat, because they have two players that are overrated, and thats Dak the Wack and bad breath Elliot
Skip had a valid point for the referee at the end of the game. If you are the suppose to follow the ball and spot it you should be there right as soon as dak slid to spot the football and on top of that runs into to dak and the center making them reset because the oline lines up when the CENTER is set. Not a cowboys fan but i believe there should have been atleast a few seconds on the clock for one last play. I just believe we need new referees. Every year its the same thing different team and no one suffers but the players.
"He stinks it up for 3 quarters and the all of a sudden he goes warrior and it's too little to late" wait you talking about Derek Carr or Dak Prescott 😂 probably both. Trash.
Skip blaming the ref is infuriating. Sure, the ref could have followed more closely, but it's the Cowboys fault they were in the way and made the ref wrestle his way through, pick up the ball, and set it correctly, which wasted 3 seconds. Why isn't Skip asking Dak why he didn't hand the ref the ball and get out of the way?
“Skiup Bayless you oughta be ashamed of yoself”
Mary go round goes around in circles , Shannon How old are you ??? im 53 ? Roller coaster goes up and down !!
why the three of them not in a studio ??? that will be fire 🔥
Skip I love Mr. Sharps baby points
Can you believe the Cowgirls used to call themselves America's Team? WHAHAHAHAHAHA.  It's a shame we have to suffer every Thanksgiving with Dallas and Detroit.  Both of them are a complete joke and have been for decades.
They was always sorry just a stacked schedule got them that record
The biggest penalty of the game was when JIMMY G didn't let TRENT WILLIAMS get set on the 4th and inches. If that doesn't happen we win and you guys wouldn't even be talking about the refs lol DALLAS beat themselves on penaltys
Jenny is freaking beautiful.
The Cowboys need (all) (new) COACHES !!! asap.
The Cowboys sure have some pretty stars...🤣🤣🤣🤣
Diet Mountain Dew is gross.
Why is Jenny so damn fine 😍😍
If Dak would’ve went Down earlier and Gave the Ball to the Ref we wouldn’t be having this conversation
If you guys are hating on mike because of the play calling hate to brake it to you he don’t call the plays that’s the OC
Hahaha I love this!!
If you're not a Cowboys' fan, it's hilarious, if you are, it's like putting your head through a brick wall.
Skip is in so much pain!!!😂😂😂
Lol Skip 😂 so great 😄
If they had handed the ball to the ref the game clock would have been reset , instead the Cowboys tried to spot the ball themselves
Show the replays fools, don’t just talk about them!!!
These two are so much fun to watch. And Jenny is awesome too!
It's as simple as this the cardinals broke down the cowboys on offense and defense and the 49ers ran with that type of game play and the coaches from the cowboys weren't ready for it.. it's the playoffs coaching is the biggest factor and the quarterback being able to handle pressure and adjust to the game
😂 dam he said bums
Minus us not making the playoffs I agreed with what Shannon said for the most part and I’m happy about it
I think Shannon is just as mad as Cowboys fans are! You could see this happening all year long! Same results it all comes back to the Owner
1 am 70 years old ,  cowboy for life  what"s wrong with dak passing to  zeke  . thus, this loss
Dallas had a SHOT AT THE END with like 30 secs left to win that game and they blew it...Bottom Line !!!!!
Real talk  If the 49ers keep running the ball like this  They can be tough to beat   Ever since they started running the ball with Deebo they’ve been winning!   And I’m a Seahawks fan but we are just watching the playoffs
I’ve been telling cowboys fans for weeks that they’re team especially parsons is over rated but this is nothing knew to non delusional football fans
Skip….I’ve always been a fan…but you even made Antonio Brown look normal today. The complete angst on your swollen face was more like what I saw from the fans in the stadium ( and I get that…I’m a Giants fan…) than a professional sports analyst. Take some time off. This was a bad look man.
Jimmy G was the best players on the Cowboys. Unfortunitly for those boys, the Niners have 21 other good players.
Skip has Covid
As a cowboys fan, I do not think dak is THE guy. Haven’t thought so for a while.
I'm sick of Dat and Zek and the head coach.
Shannon's most accurate statement was "they are underperforming bums" Dak needs to put in some serious with this off-season. Accuracy was atrocious. Pocket presence was non existent. I also think he's the reason for all the false starts. When 2 linemen jump at the exact same time, something was up with the snap count
if they throw the ball to get closer with 14 seconds left instead of running the have plenty of time to get one more shot maybe even two shots to the end zone, running the ball killed them , a pass travels faster then a run you stupid idiot skip
I didn't set myself up thanks goodness!! I knew it was going to happen! You could see it all season long!
Did Skip admit he wa wrong ?
I was more impressed on that facial expression from the young lady it looks like she was saying here we go again
I love when shannon stops talking and just starts giggling
As for The last play , what Shannon said was right that the ref was trying to hustle to the spot of the ball to give a chance to spike , it was not his fault. I think Romo even said right before they snapped the last play "they better be carful turning in the middle" , and Dak ran in the middle and was not careful. I am pist that The Cowboys could not take out The 49ers because they are a team that I feared having my Packers to play. The Cowboy's would have been an easy win in Green Bay , sigh The one time I wanted The Cowboys to win they lose.........................
Don’t ever separate Skip & Shannon.  Greatest debate show there is
😂😂😂💀
They never played a good team 🤣
I am happy that the cowboys lost, but how come nobody is talking about dumb Randy Gregory who caused an offside which made the cowboys loose a precious time out which would've mattered later...
Same old cowboys Choke Choke
Skip excuses excuses excuses
the nectar of the gods 💀💀🤣
The referee ran over both Dak and his center
Would've liked to see the Cowboys win, but I knew they weren't going to. They never do. It wasn't "stunning." It was expected. Good lord, the JAGUARS got closer to the Super Bowl in the last ten years than Dallas. Why? Because Jerry's the owner and the GM (and it wouldn't surprise me if he's up in the box calling plays to Big Mike). There is literally no one that can call him out on his decisions. And yet, they make so much money off national television exposure and merchandise sales that there's no reason to make changes.   "Expect disappointment and you'll never be disappointed."
These guys need to do a Diet Mt Dew ad for the super bowl, it would be must see!
Skip was hot
Skip Bayless's team was late to do thier job. They had 59 minutes to win and now they cry about the last minute. Typical spoiled NFL BRATS!!!
Why can't the audience see the play you're talking about???
Skip said it,Dallas could not stop their running game
penaltys killed the cowboys!!! thats it
Anyone could have won 🏆the NFC east is the laughing stock of the NFL.
I hate the Cowgirls, but seeing Skip having to eat crow makes it even more satisfying lol.   America's Team lol....more like America's Embarrassment.
The nectar of champions skip Bayless you crazy you give the the cowboys some diet dew 😆 🤣 😂
Another 1, Skip stating facts per usual.   “Diet Mountain Dew The Breakfast of Champions, The Nectar of The Gods”.
Skip saying the ref just has to touch the ball. That’s BS! The ref HAS TO SPOT THE DAMN BALL! In which universe can players just decide where they want the next play to start from. That’s the ref’s job! Should’ve handed the ball to the ref, not your center lol
Shannon Sharpe trying to imitate Stephen A. Smith ... What a laughing stock & quite pathetic! Shannon.. You are NO Stephen A. Smith.... You are just an enormous LOUDMOUTH fool. Skip Bayless is liar and a fraud. Worst sports show ever.
Skip with these names. From Jason 8-8 Garret to drop the Mike Mccarthy  🤣🤣
Dak - "Jerry, I went to the bank and it said my accounts have been frozen" Jerry Jones - "I'll unfreeze them when you get us out of the freakin 1st round"
Cowgirls fumbled the bag yet again.
Yo this is serious I can tell skip didn’t sleep.
Does not matter your regular season record if you make it to the playoffs know your self and know your opponent Dallas messed up big time I knew the 49ers was going to win
5:00 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Today Skip and Cowboys 🤠fans are on bridge on suicide watch ⌚😳
The fact that so many people woke up early on a day off to see this says sooo much! I LOVED EVERY BIT OF THIS!!!!
10 of 12 wins were against garbage teams. 6 default wins against their garbage division. Of course they lost in the 1st round. Garbage teams don't make the playoffs....well Philly is garbage and what happened to them...
*HOW ABOUT THEM COWBOYS?* Going home in the first round? 😂
simple as this..dak presnot!!😁!!
When the 3 rd  quarter started & they got two false start , next dak got sack I turn the tv & found me an Movie The Cowboys sucks
Excuses Excuses 😜😜🤪🤪🤪🤪
Let it go Skip....🙄
Keep rubbing it in Shannon I’m loving this seeing Skippy squirm in his seat.
You are what you are " Bill Parcells"
“You have to give us a chance to steal the game!”  No they don’t, refs gonna ref.  There’s a reason no other team has called a running play in those circumstances before.  What incredible whining BS.
Honestly has Dak even improved as a QB?
The 49ers are the MOST mediocre team in the NFL , even if the cowboys won in the last minute .. what makes anyone think the cowboys would beat the good teams ? 🤦
Was waiting for this 😂😂😂
Skip, category stats mean nothing when your team has the 2nd easiest strength of  schedule in the league. They were 0-6  against playoff caliber teams.
Cowboys poor run defense
Nah I rather throw With 14 sec u have at least 2-3 plays to do side line throw plays for offsides. Cowboys were already close to the TD.
No NO no no no its not enough for me when all year you been shooting off your stupid mouth about your cowboys and how special this team was lol an over inflated hot air balloon that always deflates hahaha just shut your stupid mouth Skip
Senile Skippy, blaming the referee, for the Cowboys not handing him the football as the rules stipulate. Dak placed the ball & that's illegal!
It’s all skips fault the cowboys lost for hyping everybody up! 😭😭😭😭😭💀💀💀
Skip blew a gasket
The ref was late?!  Skip is ridiculous as usual.
They were at home! They lost a home playoff game!
Skip should have called in sic today…😂 got those bags in his eyes.
@22:08 damn skip, I didn't think you'd stoop that low to go after the officials the way you did; but yeah, it's his fault for a draw play being called. Big ups to Shay for correcting him💪🏽
Diet mountain dew is the nectar of the gods. Its also what plants crave
No wonder Skip left first take. Him and stephen A are water and oil when it comes to the cowboys
In the 4th quarter, Bosa was hurt Warner was hurt, and that was the only reason the cowboys could do something. Even then, they still had a hard time movie the ball until the end when the 49ers played to prevent a touchdown. The 49ers are a much better team than the cowboys. The cowboys think they're good because they played weak teams all season. They only beat two playoff teams, the Eagles, another NFC LEast team, and the Patriots, before they went on a run. Both of those playoff teams turned out to be the worst teams in the playoffs and got spanked this weekend.
Coaching Coaching Coaching!! A blind man can see this Jerry....cmon man.
Skip and Shannon: i picked the niners but I was shocked how the cowboys were dominated for the first three quarters.
Shannon so loud and obnoxious get him out of here
And the tradition of Skip saying he was wrong wrong wrong about the cowboys continues
Skip sounds sick af
Damn shame the raiders and cowboys both had ref problem with play that could have got both of them tied and into overtime.this slow ref and the whistle in raiders the nfl needs to do better with refs!! I feel for ya skip both our teams better then what happned.hope niners get clocked clean by gb.and i hate the chiefs hope bills or titans can upset them.
Shannon knows he ain't right!  LOL
Shannon is 100% right Jimmy prevented us from hanging 30+ points on the Cowboys.
Cowboys will only be good once the Jones family is gone.
Dak made the decision to hand the ball to his center instead of the ref, and then gathered his whole O-line to block said ref from getting to the ball. Then after the ref had hurdled over a player to get to the ball, he had to move it backwards to a more correct spot, and the entire O-line had to shift backwards with it or be called off sides. This is why you train 2 minute drills. There's not enough time to think. It has to be instinct to look around for the ref after a running play that doesn't take the ball out of bounds.
The only  thing showed/bright spot up last night was the special team , specially that kicker guy.
If Dallas was in the NFC West, they would finish 5-12. If the Niners played in the NFC East, they would finish 13-4.
In the end, the game just proved that the Cowboys have been frauds all along. They also have been mediocre for five years. They're the Minnesota Vikings with media hype.  Dak is Kirk Cousins with better PR.
Skips tripping, Dak and the OL body blocked the ref!  Should have handed him the football and let him thru!
I’ve been a Cowboys fan my whole life.  I HATE when fans blame the refs.  Should never leave the game in their hands.  The refs didn’t make us commit 14 penalties.  We need to take this L like men stop blaming other people.
Oh boy skip is gonna get sweet revenge once the basketball season for the lakers ends. It’s the only way he’ll have fun on a segment lmao
Sorry Skip but Dak is supposed to hand the ball to the ref.  he has been playing football for YEARS and this rule has never changed.  He choked when the game was on the line and cost his team that final try.  Let's not even talk about the fact that the center picks up the ball and the line was lined up offsides until he did that.
The graphic should have said:  Shannon Sharpe  SKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEUP!
If Cowboys had 1 more play, they'd had a 25cyard TD pass. But they needed about 5 more seconds.
Cowboys need to completely  revamp the offensive line. (Besides zac) and once we do that if dak does not step up he needs to go. No more excuses.
12:58 I don’t think Shannon ever heard what skip said 😂😂😂
😂😂
Next season they won't make the playoffs...
Lmaoo omg I can't take it 😭😭😭
The umpire botched nothing.  You wanted special treatment from the officials and didn't get it.  The Cowboys botched it
The better team won . Get over it skip. Niners offense and defense showed it
As a Cowboys fan, I am aware that we have NOT replaced Troy Aikman! Romo was playoff trash...and so is this bum dak. Until we get an elite QB (like a Josh Allen, Burrow, or Herbert), we will be bottom feeders.
Can we just get the dolphins ex coach
My Dog Montana, baylessed in the backyard.
Shannon has no mercy 🤣🤣🤣
GO NINERS!!
Everyone knows a good qb looks for the umpire to hand him the ball so he can set it. This is exactly what Dak didn’t do.
Tell Skip I need my super bowl ticket money.
This may be the first time i’ve ever seen Skip accept defeat 🤣🤣. Enjoy it fellas
nothing matters the cowboys lost
🤣
1,2,3 Hefty Bag. 1,2,3 Cancun lol
Slight tangent, but tired of these weird, forced injection of females into sports commentary and debate shows like this. Truthfully,  could have been a brawny dude instead of a female, and it would have been needless with the way it was done. Split screen with Skip and Shannon, then suddenly someone else on a three-way. Why?
“THAT REF SHOULD HAVE SPRINTED TO THE BALL WHILST ALSO AVOIDING EVERY PLAYER IN HIS WAY!!!”
Shannon should buy a Deebo Jersey just to torment Skip LOL
1972: The Comeback By Staubach 1982: The Catch (and Grab, if you know you know) 2022: The "Slide"
SHOW US THE PLAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY… its 2022… y’all can’t do the segment in a split screen… I’m confused
Your a die hard skip its all good im sad as well
123 cancun...break...Shannon killed me..lol
Happy to see unc lay the smack on skip 😌
Damn….Shannon just buried skip to China.
I really believe skip drink diet mountain dew for breakfast
All those points scored by the Cowboys most of them were against terrible NFC East teams !!
I been waiting to see skip face🤣🤣
Shannon sharp is right about this one
The Cowboys snatched defeat out of the hands of...defeat?🤣
GB, TB, Rams, 49ers are all better than the Cowboys this year. Ariz is equal to the Cowboys because they underperform and have questionable coaching. Murray bailed them out so many times but is still learning
Fire McCarthy throw a ton of money at sean payton his contract is up. Fangio or Zimmer if Quinn leaves.kelen can stay or go just don't elevate him to head coach. The culture of this team needs to change and that starts with a coaching change  I'm tired of underachievers on this team
Cowboys will be better next yr trust me. For such a new team I think they were just overhyped Nd they underachieved but they’ll be better next season
Easy Shannon 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂poor Skipp
Shannon Sharpe is so glad Dallas lost to get back at Skip Bayless because of his crushing defeat to Tom Brady in last year playoffs where he was wrong throughout!!
All right Skip! Now you're starting to make sense
Mike and Dak need to go! Now!
11:00 Yeah exactly... He was forced to bowl through half the offense line. Who’s fault is that?
Lol even Skip blaming the ref. Haha cowboy fans are so delusional
Games should never be won by a "miraculous steal"! Especially in the playoffs! Cowboys do cowboy things! The better team won that day!
That game overshadowed most of Tony Romo screwups.If not all
they had the ball on the 40ers 41 yard line with 14s left. should of just taken 2 shots at the end zone from there instead of wasting time trying to get closer before taking a shot. Dak is certainly capable of throwing the ball 40 yards
I don’t want to hear shut about the official. It is YOUR job as a team to give him the ball. Teams literally practice running the ball over to the ref. This just further showed that the cowboys are horribly coached and unprepared.
lol poor skip !! The banter back and fourth is solid gold I love it !!!
bums
How about a little credit to the Niners playing a huge game without their best player on Defense for a second half! My lord!
I hate to admit it, but Sharpe is correct...had Jimmy connected with Aiyuk, that's a TD because NOBODY was in front of him. Had he not thrown a pick, that's a probable TD. Yup...49ers by 30 with another guy...and I LIKE Jimmy.
Bayless blames the ref for not running completely around the line instead of taking the shortest path.  The Cowboy line impeded him and caused an unnecessary delay.  Mr Sharpe points out correctly that refs do not run alongside the players during a play but Bayless wants exceptional treatment for his exceptional team.  How special.
I came here to make fun of Skip.. but cases of Diet Mountain Dew?? I'm confused
You've. Got. To. Hand. The. Ball. To. The. Offical. Skiiiiiip.
They looked entitled and hung over
4+ mins left in the game (a long time) and some cowboy fans were already crying? Lame.
Paid $75 million but played like 7.50 an hour lmao
Shannon really called them Cowboys bums 😂😂😂
I love a good skip beating but wtf did I just watch? Like Shannon, attack the cowboys, not skip… kind of tasteless on this one.
There actually seems to be some legitimate animosity and schadenfraude here... lol
Mike McCheeseburger has always been garbage 🗑️ just like Uncle Shay Shay said. Dude is doo doo butter 💩🤣
The real spot should have been the 26 where he started his slide. They gave you the yards and y’all still choked.
Shannan went in!!.. Skip Bayless the man is absolutely Right!!.. just shut up & take it like a man!
Cowboys are undefeated when they run the ball more than they pass when will they learn
That last play was so stupid, it was obvious there wasn’t enough time for that, even Romo said it on air, Dak went to far up field, he was supposed to go down after 10 yards and went 15. That’s why time ran out, not because the official was late, and the official was going way faster than normal. As a coach or OC, that extra yardage wasn’t worth the risk of the clock. It’s going to be a Hail Mary whether it’s 10-15 yds closer or not, I could see doing that if they were on the edge of Prescott’s ability to throw it in the end zone, but that wasn’t the case.
49ers should go get Rogers after the season
37 cases. I didn’t know shanon was down that much o nrhem dews
Brian Flores would’ve played Cooper Rush
Its called the Jerry Jones curse and as long as he manages the team this will be the results
I’m so glad they lost!! So many bandwagon Cowboys fans
This one is just tough as a cowboys fan. We got the ball back and had the chance to take the lead but didn’t show up. Then as much as the defense tried, they just couldn’t capitalize. Very tough loss. Penalties costed us so much, DUMB holding calls. Very very depressing.
Skip better find a new team because the CRYboys will send you to an early grave!
Y’all hate dallas so much🤣
Why do I always enjoy seeing Skip squirm???:)
Of course the cowboys won the NFC east. Weakest division in football 👎👎👎
Not a Cowboys fan here, but didn't the ref get in the way twice?
Damn Jenny "Laffy" Taffy is shining!!!
Skip with the whataboutitsms
Skip mad 😂😂😂😂 🤡
Number 4 is considered an unlucky number in Asia. In North America it also isn't a lucky number. Dak is wearing the wrong number but he has fantastic skills. Congrads 49ers
God I love Skip Bayless he’s the best 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dak said super bowl or bust? Cmon man what a disrespect not only to the other teams and players but to say Super Bowl or bust he is more delusional thank Michael Irving
As I 49er fan, I was so relieved they went for a qb sneak in bounds, with 16 seconds left. I was thinking they needed a touchdown not a field goal for the win lol.
Give the ref the ball 🤷🏽‍♂️
Great stuff, poor Cowboys season came down to a stinky game 🤣
8:19  You can tell Skip really hurts and is mad inside. Haha. Shannon just trying not to laugh. 🤣🤣
Oakland 😂🤣 as a raider im mad 😡
Dak Prescott is another Tony Romo he is just going to be good at just putting up numbers nothing more Dallas cowboys he will never win a Superbowl in Dallas
Zeke was crying. How about dem cowboys
skip so hurt lmao
Cowboy tears are the best 🤣🤣⭐️😭
Shannon said “ I told you, hefty bags on Monday. 1 2 3 Hefty bags, 1 2 3 Cancun, BREAK! I still can’t catch my breath from laughing! 🤣🤣🤣
Damn let skip make it lol
The NFL Least division was the Weakest in the NFL. Both teams lost easily. The 49ers won without a Qb.
*JENNY JENNY JENNY HOLD ON JENNY*
Poorly called game both side of the game on 9ers first touchdown parsons was in a choke hold and no hold
Really - stop blaming the refs.  You're at home - you lost.  Enough said.  Dallas, America's Team - in Penalties.
How about them cowboys 😂 sitting on the couch with us!
HAHAAHAHAHAHAH skiiiiiiiiip
Skip, the facts are that the extra 15 yards didn't change the fact it would be a hail mary either way.  I would rather 2 than 1.
Wow, do my eyes deceive me! first time Skip takes ownership and admits he was wrong….. feels good listening to that. 😂
You can't as a team spot the ball. The ref has to spot ball. that's why you give give him the ball. Your center can't spot the Skipp.
love to see skip eat his delusions 😂
Need to light fire under Dak! He's the catalyst for entire OFF! KMoore is Dak's pillow! Dak chose KMoore after SLinehan was fired... for no other reason than Dak was cozy with KMoore.  Dak, right now, is a fake tough guy. Listening to all the profanity during Hard Knocks... these guys were thugged-out... And no one was "out-thugging" McCarthy! 🤣  When happy-go-lucky "McCarthy" is leading your gang... you better not leave your hood! 🤣🤣🤣🤣  This season optimize the downside to being "over-confident".  Hopefully, they find a new identity. If not, repeat performance next year too! Unfortunately!
Does anybody know why they have been virtual the last few days? Don’t watch everyday, just clips, so not sure if they’ve said
It's up to the referee? You crazy Skip!
at 10:10 so I guess the NFL should have an extra ref follow where the player goes with the football during the play? There's no way to know where the player will end at the end of the play!
At 3:32, skip bobbing his head is gold, he’s like this lost 😡 hurts
i think the play calling by 49ers was pure trash in the 4th that being said cowboys wanted to beat them at that instead of the game lol
Why the cowboys have to do this to us every year
Skip is one of the newest and oldest reasons people  love seeing the cowboys get beat.
6-0 vs. the NFC [L]East Enough Said. Ba bye Cowboys Let's Make Some Noiiissse!
Upset? Who didn’t know the 49 errrrrs were going to win?
Lmao. U ragged my skins all season and we suffered.  Shouldn't have got rid of our defence to eagles. But i sooooop enjoyed seeing cowboys ( who I predicted before first game btw they would never win a play off game again haha.  Soo happy this day .. 🤣🤣)
I disagree with skip alot but I have to admit he’s entertaining
They play like boys and cry like girls.
Shannon said it first, no matter what your regular season record is and your team stats, but when it comes to the playoffs either you get better to advance or you get exposed. That's playoffs in football for you
THE COWBOYS BEEN LOSING IN THE 1ST ROUND FOR THE PAST 27 YEARS!!!!!! So how is this a suprise??😏
Thanku for telling skip the truth UNC SHAY SHAY 🙏🏿
Niners the better team.  If JimmyG were a more consistent QB, we hit Aiyuk leading to another TD and dont give away 7 with an INT.  That just there is a 14 pt differential and we'd have won by at least 20.  Niners played with heart and soul and won even with having lost our top 2 defenders.  GO NINERS!  The best team won, that is what the Cowboys and Skip can't stomache!!!
As long as Jerry bitchass Jones keeps his nose in everything it's gonna be this way aside that one of the best defensive teams in a while but can't stop committing stupid penalties.ive never been a fan of Dak of that trash from greenbay no different that the clapper (Jason Garrett) a damn yes man.but I digress even if Jerry steps down it'll be the same thing history repeats itself.if rather be 1-15 than keep going through this bs
Can everyone finally admit how incredible Rodgers is for the fact that he won all those years DESPITE McCarthy's ineptitude as a head coach.
No, no, no. The Ref was right there but your "boys" had him blocked out. Don't blame the Ref. He was clearly hustling.
Who is worse, the Cowboys or Bayless? Blaming the ref who was actually fighting his way to the ball us an absolute homer of an excuse.
Dak is a game manager at best
That loss was so bad skip can't even be in the same room.
They lost because they dont feature their most explosive players. Ceedee Lamb and Tony Pollard are their most explosive players, but they spend most of the game trying to go to Zeek, Amari and Schultz.
People still sleeping on the Niners, acting like Dallas lost because of one play at the end of the game.
Seems like I heard this before?…”The Win was Stolen from us! “ Skip says, “all the Official has to do is Tap the ball” . NO! the Official is suppose to Spot the ball on the correct yard line. This Center placed the ball on the 23 1/2 yrd. line, the Referee placed it on the Correct 24 yrd. line, which is what he did, and that took the extra 2 seconds. Dallas fans were Praising the Officials for getting the placement right on the First down for Samuels, Placing the ball 3 inches short of a First down, but when things don’t go the way they want it too, “it’s the Officials fault!”. Game Over!
That same ref also cost the cowboys a delay of game by running in between dak and the center from hiking the ball. That's awfully strange how it played out.
Jerry Jones needs to ask Jimmy Johnson how to build a SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM. 😆 🤣 😂
If professional football players need to be motivated for a playoff game then maybe it's no the coach. Sounds like yall are trying to make McCarthy a scapegoat in the name of social justice to get an african american a job
DAMN ... Skip cut Dak's salary below minimum wage... DAMN
When you play in a weak conference; you get false hope and views of reality as to what your team is capable.  Even GB is suspect in reality.  A QB who knows how to manage the game (Aaron Rodgers) and a decent Defense is the #1 seed.  Look at their schedule; They've won a helluva a lot of close games.  I don't think GB has that kind of luck after their first game - even with Rodgers.  The NFC East - was so weak; the Cowboys really didn't know what was what.  The 49rs have played a more diverse schedule and better teams (hence the lower seed), but made them a better team.
Y'all Stop Blaming The QB. The Cowboys Offensive Line got Destroyed.  Period.  That's why they lost.  The cowboys should have put Collins at Left Guard and Steel at Right Tackle.  And they Wouldn't have gotten Pushed Around.
Lmfao. 4 seconds? Nah son, zero on the clock is exactly where it should be when you don't hand the ball to the ref. There's a reason we in Packer nation were calling for Mccarthy to be fired 5 years before he actually was. But don't worry cowboy fans, hold onto him just as long, I'm sure he'll figure it out lolololol
Skip was absolutley on one lmao the cowboys have pushed him to the edge of sanity
Thus is the best I've ever seen skip act after a big cowboy loss! He's  growing  up before  our very eyes lol
HAD TO HAVE BEEN THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN!!
Skip we lost because we hads 14 PENALTIES AND we did not  Score for 3qts the ref Is not ti blame Mccarty did not prepare them
Except at 51 yards away you would have had 2 opportunities.
8:20-8:30 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Go for you skip running your mouth to much
DC4L!!!!!...But I'mma keep 💯💯💯!!!!...Like Jerry said, it should've never came down to the Refs!!!!!...One ????....Do you honestly think if we had Tom, Arron, or even a Joe Burrow, would we have lost that game with the depth we had on both sides of the Ball!?. Think about that for a minute!!!???. I hope every Cowboy fan enjoyed this season, because I guarantee we won't be this deep next year!!!!.
The 49rs came to play. Wasn't the refs fault Cowboys lost. Funny how every team blame the refs when they lose never themselves for poor decision making.
🤣😭🤠🤣🤪🤧🤣🤠🤣🤠🤧
FIRST OFF, THE CRYBOYS ARE NOT AMERICA'S TEAM.  SECOND, I HAVE HATED THEM FOR DECADES!  AS GLENN DICKEY'S BOOK POINTED OUT FORTY YEARS AGO, AMERICA HAS A BETTER TEAM: THE SAN FRANCISCO 49ers!
Boom cowgirls disappoint fan base again lolol
Man I was at the game front row I’m not even gonna cap I was upset than a mf. I’ve finally came to terms yesterday that I will never hype this team up ever again.
Skip you deserve it. You dropped Tony Romo like a hot potatoe for Dak. Dak can’t do anything without a perfect team supporting him. Great running game the first half of the season and he is considered as a MVP candidate and then running back toe his PCL and Dak went down the remaining of the season
Skip is so blind to the truth…
It’s become a yearly tradition, a holiday to watch skip cry after the cowboys let him down 😂😂😂
Skip and Unc were both in rare form, hilarious!
Unk called  them bums lmfao 🤣 😂 😭
And ,,, one more WRONG
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love seeing Shannon giving skip a hard time 🤣🤣 Go Broncos 💙🧡💙
skip..quit blaming the referees..u & the cowboys fans r terrible freaking losers..get the f over it..watch the 49ers next weekend against green bay
I suppose the umps scored 23 points also
Dak is 2nd highest paid QB in NFL at $42 m. :)
Skip and all other cowboys fans ...your team is helped every season by the refs. Your team has ZERO character. Lots of individuals. I'm STILL glad to be a Giants fan over your losers.
Skip tripping if he thinks Dallas is better than the 49ers ..if Jimmy didn't do his usual melt , they wouldn't have even been in this game
They should played the COWGIRLS INSTEAD OVERATED TEAM THEY SUCKS. GO PACKERS.
YA LOST THE GAME 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hey Skip..Jerry jones is a blind men...this is BS....DC4L
Re subscribed after this skip Bayless I appreciate this skip Bayless. Now the Lakers just need to make the playoffs
Niners did a false start twice in one drive yet went 118 yards to score, not an issue, yes with Jimmy, so Dak had the same chances. No excuse, it was simple, Dak and Dallas knew they would lose. Period
Unprepared overrated under preformed they got out coached! Prescott just looked bad!
Is Skip sick or he was just finished crying?
What people are not realizing we are a top 3 defense for a reason cowboys fans are acting like they would've scored on that drive for a second on the clock.
Don't think sharpe ever been on a merry Go Round🤔 .. Up/down up/down😳 lol.. Hand movement lol
As a eagle fan . Randy Gregory thought he had the ball carrier he was coming off a block
The refs forced the Niners to punt  After the refs stopped the Niners 3 times on 4&Inches Then the refs defense stepped up and defended the cowboys last play YEA REFS FAULT
Love seeing skip down and out hahahaha
You agree with a qb draw with 17 seconds left and no timeouts? And also the ref probably didn't think you guys could be so damn stupid as to run a qb draw with no timeouts but dak to off he's a ref you think a ref could keep up with a sprinting nfl qb are you serious also if dak hands ball to ref and not the center the ref would've spotted the ball quicker and you'd have 3 seconds left ref has to touch the ball last not the center  Crybabys will always look for excuses and never point the finger of blame at who made terrible choices
49ner empire all day go niners
😭😭 skip really thought the cowgirls were gonna win
Skip really called the ref RG4
I'm a WFT fan *** but wow Dal...  u were at Home ************ 🏡 😕
People need to realize this so they can understand about the refs, they tried to help.rain dak Prescott slid at the 25 yard line, the ball was spotted at the 23 so the ball was supposed to be moved back two yards which would have took more time off the clock.
100% skip will try to defend the awful running last play of the game.... it's really dumb, so he would love to have a "dissenting, unique opinion" about it   here we go
Dude this is a show so stop shouting.
Come on skip,,,,you have to give the ball too the ref,,,,,you can't blame the ref,,,,,,DON'T LEAVE THE GAME IN THE REF'S HANDS,,,,PLAY TO WIN SKIP,,,,,,
Where was Tony pollard all game ? I can’t believe they didn’t use him.
thought skip was gonna have a storke when he was yellin
SHAN-NON!  Skip!  This was the best-ever, love it-love it-love it!  For Cowboys fan(atic)s: "Back to life, back to reality..." - Soul II Soul - "Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)" (1989)
Both these Clowns are horrible.
Skip did very good accepting this defeat. Issues I had with what he said... 1. Nobody should like that QB draw. That was a horrible play call. Middle of the field was open for a damn reason. 2. To blame the ref is ridiculous.  Cowboys are professionals and should have known to account for the refs extra time necessary.
Merry go round go round and round, not up and down Shannon
I’ve never seen Skip like this
Why unc talking to skip like he a child😂😂😂😂😂😂
Don't rubbed it  Shannon your team is also a loser Eagles or Phonies whatever.  Dallas is a better team. Packers go go go will win the Super bowl. Skip time to find a new team. Pick a new team.
I'm disappointed but not surprised.  I've watched this organization since the Staubach era. This team was good but not great. They needed to be great yesterday.  The refs didn't cost them the game, but the 14 penalties cost them opportunities to be great.  We're coming up on a 2nd generation of fans that has no idea what it's like to have a championship team.  I still believe Dak can, Zeke can't and McCarthy is a possibility.   I hate to lose to the Niners but they were the better team.  Plain and simple.
The way Jenny rolled her eyes at skip LMFAO
Fire mike hire tony romo he was telling mike what to do
Someone at the studio got covid 🤣 they at home
They are not a better team than the 49ers Skip.  The only reason that the Cowboys were in that game at the end is that the 49ers lost their two best defensive players.
😂😂😂 Shannon just kept twisting that knife boooyyyy 😂😂😩
The fact that this is the longest segment they’ve posted on youtube is hilarious the producers be doing skip dirty 😂
Yes with Bosa and Warner out, 49ers still got what 5 sacks vs. what 0. They also rushed and harassed Dak over and over. And Dallas was outplayed clearly. As for the 4th quarter, Niner's played prevent to some extent, did not want Dallas to get a big one on them. That is why Dak and Dallas got better states in the end of game, you know this. Later, we well guys.
Skip trash af 🤣🤣🤡
Lol 😆 Maybe Mike McCarthy Should Have Said Dallas Will Win I Guarantee It Lol Nope They Lost!!! Bye Bye Dallas 👋
As a Chargers fan....I didn't think a team could lose in a worst way than we did against the Raiders on SNF this season (Second to 2007 Div loss to NE). Only worst than this Dallas loss was the fan reactions during the game. They was hurting, and it wasn't the Refs fault....they just played bad and the fans felt let down
Skip, Prescott should have handed the ref the ball. But he tried to initiate a play instead. You've paid Dak too much...
That randy Gregory hold. That Dak interception. Not going for 4th and 2. Blown pitch to zeke 3rd and 11. Obvious blitz on 4 and 11. Qb draw no timeouts 14 seconds left. Can’t even blame the ref on this one. We also missed Gallup
Dak just sucks. He's not that dude
Lmfao stop it with the excuses it's ridiculous yeah Dak show us something that he's not an elite quarterback never has been
skip  you blame  McCarthy but,bbut skip who's your GM ? Who hires the coaches ? who pays your cowboys  ? thats who you blame skippy boy
these players are making millions to know the basic rules
Brian Flores needs to coach this team
skip lives rent free in my head as soon as the ref came on and said game over i immediately thought of skip 😂😂😂😂
Daks not good enough… period
the ref should have moved that ball back about 2 more yards... from the start of the slide.  and that would have ended the game cleanly because moving all of the cowboys back 2 yards would have easily drained the clock.  100% can't blame the refs.  they got all the calls right in that game, on both teams.  tough loss tho.
Well I was right cause I knew the 9ers would win. They are better, it’s that simple. Playoffs is a different animal. I’m 5-0 with my picks lookin for the flawless win tonight
I've never liked skip more, he was on fire as ate crow!
Watching the cowboy suffer makes me happy inside.
This Skip stuff, I always look forward to every year. and one reason I subscribed LOL. Go skip!
merry go rounds go up down up down? lol
Gerry needs Mike because he does not cast shade on Jerry's greatness. Here's a question: would Jason Garrett have won if he was Head Coach?? I am going to say, "More likely".
Jesus Jenny is hot!
Cowboys will never be anything but a joke of a franchise as long as jerry jones is involved. They haven’t been disciplined in years. So cowboy fans can be expecting failure for years to come 😂😂😂
As long as Prescott is the quarterback Dallas will never do anything. I’ve thought this since day one. I don’t care how good he appeared to be his rookie year. He is not good at all. Making millions and he’s not worth a nickel. When Romo got over his injury he should’ve been back at quarterback and Prescott should’ve been on the sidelines where he belongs. Prescott is worthless!!
Take a couple of shots to the end zone. Why the qb keeper to the middle of the field , with no time outs. Odds are much higher of getting a pi than that boneheaded play. McCarthey then tries to spin it on the refs. Absolutely one if the worst calls I've ever seen.
Will tell you Skip, if Dak got a last play after the run, that one shot would have been a INT, absolute. No doubt. Dallas would have lost the game regardless.
SKEE-YUP SKEE-YUP BUT SKEE-YUP
LOL this idiot said Cowboys were for sure going to win one playoff game
*Bro Skip is the best he takes losses like a real man*
Diet mountain dew is he serious?
Shay statscott got him some empty calories
I'm going to turn vegan and hang up my hat and Spurs and start riding camels.
Watch the hypocrisy with Skip, Jimmy Gag his new put down name, but be going for Jimmy G next week against Green Bay...Go figure... Laughable
I'm going to be vegan hang up spurs and hat and
Skip, it's not the first thing Shannon has got right the whole freaking football season.  The Cowboys are not a good team. And I'm a lifelong Cowboys fan who's lived my whole life in Dallas.  The Cowboys record this year against teams that finished better than 9-8 was 1-4.  One win, four losses against good football teams.  Does that sound like Dallas should be in the Super Bowl picture?  And the problem isn't with QBs or wide receivers or running backs or defensive ends or head coaches.  We've been through more of those in the last 25 years than I can count.  The problem is with the GM/owner...that's the only thing that's been the same for this last quarter century of failure.  Until Jerry Jones dies the Cowboys will never amount to anything in the post season.  And I certainly don't wish anyone any harm, but I'm not gonna have any expectations until we have a new GM and owner.
Best episode ever 😂
Shannon didnt have to do it like that. Jeez! This hurt to watch man gosh... 😭
That was NOT enough wrong!s to defuse the situation Skips! Everyone else in the world could see what was going to happen! Who of note did the Cowgirls beat after the bye??
Cowboys aren't even good they had a easy schedule this season only valid win was against the panthers. There schedule is easy every season fan base gets so fired up then let down the first game of the playoffs.
The bet was 10 not 8 🤫
Sorry Skip Dallas is not better than the 49ers, but they do have more talent, bigger names, spend all they can. But the 49ers have something special, something you cannot buy. You are clearly wrong Skip!! All the best, get over it bro. Be well and safe.
Skip finally speaking facts 😂
Pay the referees full time money and stop  being money pinching with t he referees the quarterback  g et pay  millions a years so  is bullseye  to complain  about the old referees not getting the futbol spot on time fck off with the bllsht
In the second half 9ers lost Bosa and Warner that's how Cowboys came back. Also, Jimmy missed the go home its over TD throw and then gives them a gift. Also the ref doesn't have to touch the ball he has to spot it. The players can't place the ball... Ever play football?
Damn I wish they were in studio😂
Poor Jenny having two guys yelling through her pods lol.
Trade Dak for Russell Wilson.
Again blaming the coach or officials is just a loser mentality
Soon as I seen the 49ers walk out listening to music and having fun while the Cowboys walked out all uptight and nervous I knew we were in trouble.
Truth is they need a real coach a made man who will keep them disciplined cuz the penalties are insane . The run game is nonexistent Zek is Done move on from McCarthy and some help on the offensive line
That's why he wears #4 duh!
San Francisco has the best NFL franchise ever, and they have team unity, for a long long time. Not always the best players but they have been competitive. Question if the Niners have a great franchise, go ask Aaron Rodgers, go ask Tom Brady, we may see both in the playoffs, and they know the 49ers could win it all. Why, because they play the game, regardless of who they can put on the field. It is a team who wins game, with unity! Done
Shut up cornballs if we would have had more time we would have beat them shut your mouth Shannon Sharpe your corn ball 2
Ref wasn't late. They forgot the rules. Somebody change skips diaper.
Thank you for taking McCarthy off our hands... signed a Packers fan.
lol Skip we deserved a participation trophy last shot into the endzone. Your QB that's is paid millions to be the smartest player on the field made two dumb moves at the end.
As a 49er fan I couldn't stand to watch the Cowboys fans and listen to the Cowboys fan announcing the game. Romo was horrible and biased. I hope he never announces another game again for the 49ers
“The game is about to end” so why are the cowboys running it, and staying in bounds with zero timeouts? 🤡
Dak Prescott GAGGED...Cowboys be who we knew they were. Sorry Skip
I dont have a problem with how the game ended but having refs who do it as a part time job seems kind of ridiculous, with how many times refs mess up games, it would make sense to pay them well enough that they make it their full time job
Skip is a typical Cowgirls Fan, Blame !... Pathetic
That lady’s face represents every cowboys fan for the past 28 years
I love to hear Skip cry.. lol
jimmy g almost gave it away too...i said it both qb are horrible..shannon wasn't good either going to call motion for a qb sneak..crazy..just qb sneak it...we got lucky not going to lie..
Shannon's reactions never disappoint!!
The only thing skip could blame was the ref who was trailing the play. In other words he had nothing to say.
The video I've been waiting on all morning Lmao Skip is hella upset I'm sure Jenny over there crackin up cause she knows Shannon is gonna go in on Skip about these Cowgirls!!
Skip looks sick, sorry to see this. Yes I knew the 49ers would win, should have won my more, like 34-17 perhaps. They played with team unity even when Bosa or Warner got hurt, they stepped up and played their game. Mistakes, sure, both teams made some, but in the end, the team who earned it won. Not due to big names, or a stacked team, but due to team unity.  Get tested Skip, hope you are fine, be safe, cheer up, Dallas is still a great team.
Dallas put the ref in that situation so nothing on official, you wasted time and is it  the refs job to make sure you get a play off.
Skip you Alright,  You got about 3 or 4 teams don't you !... That dude a Joke
I didn't know that Skip is the owner of the Cowboys.. Skip Kepp 😭 😭 😭 😭. 🤡.
Dak gave the ball to his center, which the center spotted, ref had no choice but to respot the ball because dak and the center don’t know the the rules
Gold
Cowboys fans are gonna blame it in penalties well I would too if I was the most penalized team 😂 Not a cowboys fan glad to see em lose bc my dad dislikes them
Tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock that’s what happened skip the rest did not lose you the game You’re a team did
Stefon Diggs does not play for the Dallas Cowboys Mr. Sharpe! 🤦🏽‍♂️
LeShannon giving him both barrels. 🤣🤣🤣
I’m a Niners fan born in 81 and have literally been a lifelong 49ers fan.  I was watching 49ers games INTENTLY as a baby (according to my mother) so I hate the Cowboys. On top of that hearing that Cowboys fans were freaking cheering when Warner got hurt I am RELISHING the Cowboys getting ragged on.   That being said I’m gonna give a shout out to Micah Parsons. That dude showed UP. Too bad for him the rest of his team didn’t do the same.
funny...good sports....this is the trash talking i like..just goofy around and not...
The refs did not lose you the game
Why was this episode filmed like an early COVID episode? Are they quarantining again?
Game over skip stop the excuses
Loosing the cowboy way
Dallas just doesn't have top tier talent.  They play in the NFL's toilet division.  They beat losing teams.  Not good teams.  Their "stats" are smoke and mirrors.  Skip is clueless.
According to Skip its the refs fault. Wow. If you look at the replay Dak was eyeing the ref as he was running and he stood in his way. Dak cost time by doing that and he placed the ball on the line knowing that's the ref job.
Man skip so emotional this episode 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Dak sucks
00:58 skip bouncing 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
When Dak see the ref. coming he blocked it🤣🤣🤣🤣 like i said Skip blame the official 🤣🤣🤣...
That dude skip is a shadow
That game was so, sooo, sooooi satisfying to watch!! 😜 now my Packers will do the dirty work and take out the Niners!! GO PACK GO!!
Skip aired out mans whole info 😂😂😂
I been waiting for this since yesterday.
Blame the ref...if you gotta reach for that you deserved to lose the game
I love these two.  Both are so passionate, both are Alpha's, and  don't hold back against each other. Yet, they love one another like brothers and dont take anything personal. Best duo on Sports TV ever!
pay your debt shannon skip its ok we aint gonna trip about it fk it nobody said we would win all of the games shannon u r wailing dude back up shannon u got this one rah rah rah rah ur satisfied damn sam
Sorry Skip , I agree with you most days , but you can't take a chance on a draw which has to me timed perfectly , and have the ref factor involved. w/ 14 or 12 sec. left , you gotta take your shot at the end zone, probably two shots. Which would have been low % anyways of getting the TD
unc was waiting the whole year for the cowboys to lose in the playoff.
Shannon speaks all truth here…but as a niners fan, cmon jimmy….how you miss wide open aiyuk?!🤦‍♂️
I KNEW THE 49ERS WOULD SHUT DOWN EMMITT SMITH.  THERE WAS NO WHERE FOR HIM TO RUN.
might lose defensive and offensive coaches....might as well get a new head coach also
This is why analytics don't work. Cowboys had great numbers against garbage teams and then flaunt around like they're in the top tier like the Packers, Chiefs, or Bucs.
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS 🤡🤡🤡 same old cowboys lose first round. Everyone slept on this 49ers team. Those boys are bad out in San Fransisco. This rivalry is renewed, and Dem 9ers gon get Rodgers again.
Got punched in the mouth
How bout them Cowboys?  They lost the game & the 49ers did not win it.  Jimmy G did his best to hand over the game to the Cowboys but they were worse than him.  If he plays like he did, which I think he will do, the 49ers are toast in the frozen tundra.  Rogers is no Dak & the GB packers are no slouch like the Cowboys.
The Cowboys stop running the ball, mixing it up from run to passing will allow your play action to be more effective. Keeping Dak in the shot-gun formation 60-70% ofthe time was a mistake.
Yes. They were crying!! Hahaha
I don't know how Skip got out of bed this morning... seriously.
AHHHHHH
Tonight we're gonna party like it's 1995...... hahaha.... Dallas sucks! They'll never win another SB....ever!!!!
Just like Skip to blame the Ref. Skip, you know the rules, too. Just like the DEMOCRATS crying RACIST. COWBOYS/FANS/SKIP BLAME THE REF. (COWBOYS AREN'T AMERICA'S TEAM). Who ever said that was a Dumbocrat."LGBFJB ".
The Niners have been doing this. These experts are speaking as if the Cowboys had to win this game. They haven’t beat any real teams all year , the Niners have beat up on Playoff teams and lost some close ones. Cowboys were outmatched from the jump.  They were lucky to get back in it thanks to Jimmy. Self inflicted wounds aside , it would have been an ugly loss for the Cowboys. Niners deserve more respect than this .
Skip has had many of these days. Today belonged to Shannon no doubt 😂😂😂
If he didn’t run through Dak and the OL then he has to go all the way around or tip toe through them and then Cowgirls fans would be complaining about him being too slow
Take accountability and ownership Dak as the leader of this franchise. Final plays like this and of course the infamous "Dez catch" don't lose games. It's the sloppy plays that causes games like these to depend on risky final plays, that's the root of the issue. Stop with the excuses. Stats mean nothing if we can't execute when it counts the most.
The Bills and the Buccaneers in the Super Bowl.
Dak is a fraud!
$7.50 and hour that sums it all up...Jerry are you here?
As a Cowboys fan I must say that Shannon is always right about them, but ALWAYS wrong when it comes to MJ
Shannon dancing in the beginning had me ready for this segment alone.
All that hype just to play like that and lose, man, the Cowboys suck, no excuses
The cowboys folded like a cheap chair. It was crunch time and for the game to end like that was them cowboys
The nectar of the Gods💀😭😭😂
Kuddos to Skip for holding in his tears when uncle shay went after him. He showed him no mercy. Anyways, best sport show ever.
Cowboys Cursed
Skip if you thank that was a good call your Absolutely crazy with 14 seconds left you had 3 plays at least that was the worst play call In history of the playoffs without a time out left
It's not the ref fault because the cowgirls was late to play this game for the first 3 quarters
I said last night, Shannon is going to have fun clowning Skip over this Cowboy loss, AND Skip is going to spend the rest of the NBA season clowning Shannon over LBJ and Westbrick after every Lakers loss… Skip is in the Dak and Mike camp though, wanna blame the refs for the Cowboys’ failings.  Game shouldn’t have even been close enough for that play to matter, but I’m glad it ultimately went down like that, so they can spend a whole offseason thinking they had it and what if.  LMAO 😂
On an unrelated note when tf they gonna fix those blinds I have NEVER like that design for that stadium and it just mind boggles me they didn’t even think to add some form of shading or curtains to cover it up instead letting the sun come through like a holy light
damn as a 49er fan i feel bad for the cowboys lol
Can we get Sean Payton
What happens when America finds out that Skip Bayless used to be a good newspaper reporter in Dallas, but now is just a self-aggrandizing know-it-all clown?
“The Cowboys are a bunch of Underperforming Bums, They’re Bums !”
Skip excuses excuses excuses excuses excuses excuses excuses excuses excuses excuses excuses excuses stop it skip
Skip making excuses for his Cowboys blaming the umpire. To answer the question they would have been better off taking the Hail Mary from the 50 because they ran out of time by the time they got to the 20.
Is Dak a better version of Tebow?  Can’t tie his shoe laces up first three quarters  then becomes Brady in the 4th
Stop crying about the referee skip,dak prescott slid too far when you know you only have 12 seconds,and you suppost to give the ball to the referee so all you cowboys fans crying,the center put the ball way ahead of the spot and the referee was blocked out for setting the ball in the rite place,stop crying Dallas cowboys and skip,you are who you are looser cowboys fans,every year hopes up and end of season bubble burst jaja,and sorry Jimmy gi threw interception or it would be 23-7 end score
Thank u skip .. I gained respect for u
Why skip and Shannon are not in the studio 🤔
"Nectar of the Gods" 😂😂😂😂
SKIPPPPPP!!! Epic Melt Down 😂😂😂
This man Shannon funny asL
Skip: "And yes, his QBR was 27..." Shannon: "WHAAAATTTT?!?!?" 🤣🤣🤣
I said it all the last 2 years- "Dak is pedestrian against good teams", He is NOT A 40 MILLION DOLLAR QUARTERBACK!  He plays scatterbrained against good teams.  The head coach should also be fired.  I've watched the Cowboys since the middle 60s and this last 24 or so years has been an absurdity.  Jerry should have fired himself for letting Jimmy Johnson go.  That was cutting off the nose to spite the face.  Flushing common sense down the toilet.  Jerry's team management for winning in the playoffs is abysmal.
I’m a Pats fan and I felt worse for the Cowboys than I felt after that beating from the Bills. Losing like this at home with high expectations must hurt a lot
Didn’t know I needed to hear Shannon calling the Cowboys “bums” but I am loving it
Skip wishing he had Stephen a smith for a sec
“now this puts a smile on my face”- Jenny the whole time
Dak pulled a Paul Crewe
You’re telling me.. 90% of the show is about the Cowgirls L?? No word about the Bills demolishing the Pats?? No words about the chiefs sending Big Ben into retirement?? No word about the bengals vs raiders?? Holy effff
Shannon 😂😂😂🔥
The umpire was not late, Dak can not spot his own ball!!! Dak looked right at the Ump when he was running up and Dak turned his back to him and got under the center. Every player ever in that time clock situation looks for the ump and gives the ball to them to spot it!!! It’s not the Ump’s fault that Dallas called a dumb play having Dak running in the middle of the field, they probably thought Niners would stop him sooner, Dak can see the time clicking away and chose to keep running. You don’t deserve another shot just because you WANTED another shot.
Jerry Jones: “Damn that’s crazy…” *gets on his private jet to go to his private yacht/cruise ship. * 😎 the cowboys won’t win a Super Bowl until Jerry bites the dust.
Shannon -I'm Schadenfreude in the flesh- Sharpe
I feel like the camera man was a 49er fan the way he was showing those fans 😂
I knew the Dallas cowboys was going to loose when they lost to the Arizona Cardinals and the Cardinals suck!
Damn I wish they were in studio. 😢😂
Skip bitter go niners beat the pack interceptions coming soon !!!!
Where was all this energy for the Eagles though? The eagles swore they had a chance this year but they don't get this much hate when they lose.
The tighter Jerry’s face, the better the loss! 🤣🤣🤣
Shame they had to call in this episode. Needed a live blowup in person
Should have hosted Stephan a smith
Is Skip okay?  He looks weak and unhealthy!!
Bottom line. You don't see plays like this happen in crucial times to well coached teams.
Underperforming bums, no good for nothing Cowboys 😆
Cowboys SUCK! So does Skip!
I actually picked the 49ers to upset the cowboys but I also thought the raiders would upset the Bengals so all my picks except the raiders is right and I have the Rams over the Cardinals
Somebody needs to tell Skip the Umpire did his job. Dak did not hand the umpire the ball. That is on Dak. Stop crying Skip. Us, Us, We, We....does Skip work for the Cowboys? You need 16 seconds to work that situation Skip. That is widely known around the league. They had 14 seconds.
Skip really needs to go back to school and learn how to re read a clock. No way they would have had "4 seconds" not to mention, the Ref actually spotted the ball incorrectly.  The ball should have been spotted at the 25 or 26. Dak or someone else should have been sprinting the ball to the official. Your center doesn't just get to spot the ball wherever he thinks it should go. Maybe if the Cowboys hadn't thrown away so much time and committed so many blatant penalties they would have had more of a chance. Nobody's fault but Dallas'.
RIP Denny Green - Great reference,  I'm gonna have to watch the youtube vid of his bears tirade again.  Never gets old, I still remember that Bears game.  If you are maybe too young, lookup the video it is classic.
0:14
"Why would the game be over??" 🥺 Cowboys had no timeouts and Dak wasted time. "In the end, I think we deserved a last shot" 😢 Jimmy already gave them 7 points off his INT and another opportunity off that Trent Williams tick tack false start call, how many more chances did they need 😂💀?
Damnn ol girl in the stands made a thumbnail lol they owe her a $
The audio is dogshit.  Why are they screaming like that?  So damn cringy and unlistenable.  Took me a while 25 seconds to SKIIIIIIIIIP this trash video.
How does Mike McCarthy still have job. And Daks kirk cousins but on a bigger contract
I couldn't tell if that was Mike McCarthy or Joe Judge in a sumo suit.
How bout them dem Boys!!!!!
He was about to say got Mike Mccarthy "Fired" at 6:07🤣🤣 he had to catch his self from giving away the "RIGGED" soap opera  called the NFL🤣🤣don't give away the script SKIP you won't be on t.v no more🤣🤣🤣🤣
At this point Jerry Jones should give 3 1st rounders to Robert Kraft and 20 million a year for Belichick and call it a day lmaooo
The biggest takeaway I got from this game is Jimmy G is hot garbage. That game should not have been this close. He gift wrapped Dallas chance after chance to win that game
We had a great year how bout 1st round running back michagan St zeke I love him he's just not that guy
As a Seahawks fan all I can say is the Cowboys play a lot like the Seahawks on the playoffs. They feel lost, non aggressive, outmatched at times and always playing from behind having the 4th quarter being their best.
Somewhere in Ireland, Jason Garrett is smiling. 🙂
0:59 Yo skip got me crying 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What are the cowboys favorite restraunt?:      IN and out
At least Dak has that sleep number bed to rest up for next season :p
Cowboys will never win a championship with DAK!
15:48 "If the 49s had any other quarterback, they beat you all by 30".  Pure savage. That burn scorched both teams.
Raiders fan here, I don’t feel so bad no more 😂
How bout those cowgirls 👏👏🤣
Dallas Cowboys are nothing more than Detroit Lions with a larger fan base
It’s a crime they couldn’t be in the studio together
The cowboys are a joke,,,,,,,hahahahahahahhahahahahahahah
Shannon is laughing now but I think skip might have the last laugh If LeBron don't make it to the playoffs or lose the first round of the playoffs,lol
A lepord does not change it's spots lol 😂🎊🎇🐆
Question, probably a dumb one but why aren’t they in the office today? Covid?
Skip:He is worth 7.50/hr!!! Everybody:damn…😂 Me: Minimum wage is 7.25/hr so it’s not a complete insult
shannon hasn’t slept like that since lebron won that ring with the lakers lol
so do people forget that Dak is still recovering from a career ending injury. Like wtf there's no way u guys are real fans. They lost that game cuz of them not cuz of the 49ers. I really wanna see a coached team next year if they are like this next year we're done.
If the 49ers had a Russell Wilson or even a DeShawn Watson at this moment they would've won by 30
Jenny👸👑😘😍
Trash Prescott!!🤣
Cowboys doing Cowboys things
I thought Leafs, philly and Knicks fans were bad, them CowBoys are built different.
I appreciate how Skip handled this loss.  Honest, and accountable even though he is disappointed.  It’s a bitter pill to swallow and Skip stayed with the facts instead of fanatic apologizing for mistakes.
Hahahahahahhahahahahahaha Cowgirls lose again.
I accept the lose now I gotta deal with my local fans here in the bay damn 49ers fans .God never gonna hear the end of it .
Jenny 😍😍
We will never win with DAK
Why aren't they in studio?
Jenny 😩😍
Dey had plenty chances nd kept getting penalized
Next season will be the year.
SHARPE IS A RACIST
Dawgg Shannon came out with so much pressure he had skip putting his head down. Stephen couldn’t even do that to skip.
The cowboys lost in the most dumbest way possible
Party 🎉 at club shay shay’s 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Shannon deserves this moment 😂
Lmao! Naw skip...cant SKIP PASS THIS!LETS HEAR THE EXCUSES!
The Cowboys were 6-6  OUTSIDE OF T HEIR DIVISION. Make it 6-7.
Skip forgets the 49ers injuries, the prevent defense, and the Jimmy G stupid plays that let his team back in
I stopped watching this channels because I got tired of Skip always talking about the Cowboys, but today I have to watch his reaction and is very laughable. 😂
123 hefty bags
Talk talk talk all day about how the cowboys lost isn’t the story of this game. The truth is how the 49ers dominated and almost lost because Gimmy Jimmy tried to give it away again. 49ers dominated O and D lines and even still dominated when Bosa went out. Seriously, cowboys not entitled to a win just because and so so silly to have to listen to all the whining and blaming officials. Pay attention Packer’s.
Skip's tears are delicious.  Shannon been waiting for this.
I'm a diehard Cowboys fan, they beat the bad teams, but couldn't show up when it mattered, I knew the 49ers ground game was too much for them. I been saying get rid of McCarthy, take Kellen Moore with him. Time to retool that offensive line, Collins an Smith are done. Dak isn't that guy, he just isn't, an Zeke has ran out of gas. Same ole sorry Cowboys🤷‍♂️
I'm Packers fan so I hate both 49ers & Cowboys and I'm happy one of them are gone but it's a shame there wasn't a last throw. How come a ref will run with a Wide Receiver or Running Back that is running alone towards the endzone, but no one was there after the QB draw??
17:50 “when it doubt throw a flag on..52” the way he said 52😭🤣
Bitchs was really crying in the stands lol I’m weak af they must have lost money😹😹😹
Man y’all gotta chill with the Dennis Green references….”they are who we thought they were” Lmaooooo
Skips tears 🤤
49ers!!!!
Skip and shannon were lit for this one!!!
That draw play was only good if they had a timeout left 🤣. Dak should've thrown either to the sideline or over the middle of his receivers were open. Stop it Skip 😂.
Bad coach.  Mike McCarthy should have been fired long ago. How can you have Zeke Elliott and Pollard on the team and not punish the defense. Since Mike joined the cowboys  Zekes production is going downhill.  With all those penalties, that reflects on the coach because,  there is a lack of discipline.  Mike was living on past glory. But Aaron Rogers made it happen.  The team is solid, you need change at the top. PERIOD
Music to my ears today 🥳🥳 everyone can enjoy the rest of the playoffs now, the trash has been taken out
Sheeesh
Mike & Dak got to go!
I'm a die hard 49er fan but the penalties is what cause the Cowboys to lose that game but to through trash on the field is uncalled for.
Oh no Skip!
A QB Draw is the type of play you call by accident when playing MADDEN not in a real life NFL game.
That was the hardest game to watch this year
You're a hater skip!!! You're going to croak before you see the cowboys win another super bowl
As soon as I saw the QB Draw I knew the game was over.
Every team goes home at some point except one.
Dak didn't go warrior it's just the 49ers lost Bosa and Warner their 2 top defenders. It's not a coincidence you started to move the ball once they left the game LoL
@12:50 sharpe speaks the truth
Dak blocked the ref and tried to snap it w/o the ref touching it which would have also ended the game. Take the L
Cowboys will do cowboy things to loose 😂😂😂😂😂
I do t think penalties is in the coach that has to be on the players
My favorite is Dak popping off to Brady after losing to the Buccaneers, "See you in January." Nope! 🤣
Blaming the ref on that last play is poor sportsmanship.
Skip wants a part time ref to pull a hamstring trying to keep up with the NFL players when he is way behind them
It was all the ref's fault.  They were a pickup team of refs.
Everything skip said is bs, game should be over before half already
Wait they be betting Mountain Dew😂
Cowboy fan or not this team is by far one of the more talented teams in the nfl.  Dallas has had talented teams over the last 20 years.  The difference between them now and those other years and the Troy Aikman teams are the coaching!  Like come on man!  Bellicheck or any good coach could win playoffs game with this roster.  They do cowboys Jerry made Americas team into Americas laughing joke.
Top 5 segments of all time 😂
If the Bucs had lost yesterday too, they would have put out a B.O.L.O for Skip Bayless today 😂😂😂😂
Shannon clowns the Cowboys and Stephen A clown's the Cowboy fans. They should do a crossover segment together for the ULTIMATE ROAST of the Cowboys and their fans.
Bayless: "If he catches that then we win the game" Everybody: If they didn't know how to play football. Then we win!!
At 20 minutes in the video it looks like Shannon is wearing the Blue Star on his shirt.  Love it..lol
I love Skips obsession w Diet Mtn Dew
We would’ve made it out of that game with a win without all of those penalties (our fault not refs) but our team isn’t the legit super bowl contender that they’ve looked like in spurts this season. It starts with Dak sometimes playing like a complete average nothing special QB and stretches all the way to our diva culture and some more things in between. Not even that upset about losing in the first round because it’s clear we’re not who we need to be to make a legit playoff run. I’m only upset it was against the niners smh lol
Dak plays just exactly like the previous QB!!
3:20 "Oakland Raiders"... If only...
How I'm laughing at the Bronsexuals right now
BOOOOOOOOOO! WAAAAAAAAAA
49ers fans hacked the cameras somehow 😂
Skip you make more excuses than a Vikings fan!!
I've been waiting for this!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Is Skip going to be OK, he looks like his head is about to explode? Any player in the last seconds of a game must "hand the ball to the official". Every other player in the league does it, why did Dak think he could just give the ball to his center?
Skip why are you  switching  up  on  Dak , it is a lot on coaching,  and penalties  is that Daks  fault.  NO that is coaching.  You and Shannon  talking  about  Daks comment  about  the refs what about  McCarthy  saying  it was the refs fault.
On paper we're better that's it
Did anybody think wack Prescott was gonna be able to get the job done for real?
What exactly was the picture of the lady for?
This is so typical of cry boy fans blaming referees and all this b******* when the bottom line is they're the most overrated team and they have the most ignorant boisterous fans and the only thing they have to say after they fail for the last 26 years is... We will be in the super bowl next year.., 😄😄😄😄
ref waved his arms like a boxing ref calling the fight lol it was hilarious
Skip!! How do YOU expect Ramon George get to the ball?? You don't like him coming from behind Dak; if he goes around the O line he gets ripped for taking the long way around. 50 year old man can't run a 4.4 - how about if he just got down on all fours and go under the legs of Dak and center to place the ball...gtfoh
poor skip he is gettin hammered by sharp lol its crazy how people are so adamant in puttin down the loser but are quiet when the under dog becomes the winner because cuz they just are. hatters skirt tailers we in some and we lose some no need for all this everyone cant win u know dallas did pretty well....be a good sport and say ull do better next time even jordan was not great at first he did not even make a team but he came back and look at him now the best there is !! the world is so unforgiving its a shame dang u call em all that!!! bums ur gonna eat those words soon!!! they talk about lebron bad as well look at him hmmm
Shannon is soo dang hilarious.
Jimmy G made two big mistakes late and the Cowboys still couldn't beat them. That final play had to be the worst play call I have ever seen in an NFL game.
KODAK BLACK IS A 🐐
But the Refs... the argument of the loser lol
I’m a giants fan, I was actually kinda rooting for you cowboys yall was doing good this year I was happy for y’all
Shannon: "Your quarterback is a rollercoaster, he is not a marry-go-round".  I'm done! ☠️☠️☠️😂😂😂😂
The center/any Cowboy can’t spot the ball for the refs. Skip sound straight foolish!!!! lmaooo
Been excuses after excuses since "Dak caught that". 😆.. Dak did catch the ball but, the other playoffs lost games after, are straight up excuses.
Alot of brand new crying Cowboys fans memes were born yesterday.
Let’s go niners but jimmy sucks
NO... Only going to get worse, via salary cap.  This was the Cowboys only chance, now the window is closing very fast. Teams in the NFC are coming up and the tip teams currently are better then Big-D and your coach is Mike McCarty. Lol... Joke's on y'all.
This may be one of my favorite episodes.  I've been waiting all day while working!  ~ Mister Walter
Any ex-football player or expert will tell you that with no time-outs and 15 sec on the clock you cannot run anything in the middle of the field and have enough time to spike the ball and stop the clock. So why would they run that play with 8 secs? I'm just enjoying all the Dallas fans being miserable and sad today....it's music to my ears
The ETHER 🔥 🤣🤣🤣
I have a question... What happened to the ALL WORLD linebacker Micah Parson?
Bed time old man!
Pass dem 8 cases and shut up Skip...lmaoooooooo
Why do they like diet mountain dew so much ?
We definitely need a new head coach
I'm a Cowboys fan but Shannon had me dying saying Skip was the reason why fans were crying in the stands because he hyped up the fans by telling them this was different and Cowboys we're going to the Superbowl. Sad but true. I thought this was a different year too but nope same old Cowboys.
The Niners were clearly better than Cowboys yesterday
When cowboys lose in playoffs suddenly the whole world becomes happier lol Pure comedy
Clippers and Cowboys both need to find a remote island to move away to
The momentum did shift we just blew it as usual
They really put her in the thumbnail 😭 bless that women
Eagles fan, i have  a special kind of hate for the cowboys that goes back to the 80's.  All season long  i was hatin how good  they were. After my joke of a team folded like a cheap suit to TB, that last play in dallas just made my weekend. I would be lying tho if i said that i didnt feel for the fans. Omg.
I hope Jerry Jones never sell the Cowboys and lives to be 150, his incompetency brings me joy
So no you are it better then the SF
They were trying they're just not good enough
Shannon shouldn't work on Skip so hard. He really is upset about his, "Cowboys". Well, he's still got, "Tompa Bay".
The reason Cowboy fans didn't see this coming is that they didn't account for division records. The Cowboys got 6 easy wins and a bunch of padded stats from their division. They were never as good as their stats suggested. Packers were the only team in the NFC with a weaker division and they are being put on notice.
damn, skip aint have to put they money/bets out there like that
Skip is hilarious 😂
Even skips handkerchief is frowning
This is classic, all-time great Skip and Shannon! They are the best sports show, PERIOD!
Bums 🤣🤣🤣🤣💯💯💯💯
WHAT CAN GO WRONG WILL GO WRONG YOU CAN NOT MAKE THIS ISH UP AT THIS POINT 25 YEARS MAN 25 YEAAAAARS!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
That interception where Dak threw to the outside of the WR on a curl instead of the inside was awful. but they are not good in a lot of areas. Not aware in crucial situations like a blatant hands to the face on a 3rd long with a big chunk of time left (I know it was over 5 minutes left). They don't have a valid complaint about the last play. They might have a valid complaint on the play right after the fake punt. When they rushed everybody in and it was clear that the 49ers weren't going to sub in, the ref kept holding up the start. Leading to the delay of game. But the Cowboys should have executed that play more efficiently by not waiting so late to exchange personnel. Shannon is right about the front D line for the 49ers being able to cause problems for the Dallas O line. But this game also should that Grarappolo is like Drew Bledsoe. Will play well for little while but then make game killing mistakes later on. I think he has problems with nerves. But the result shouldn't surprise anyone who has been analytical of how they've played and not biasly hopeful like a fan.
Skip is a BIG mouth. 49ers flattened them in the first half. Jimmy almost gave them the game.
Im shocked they didn’t bring up that Dak should know that he has to get the ball to the ref immediately.
Dak Prescott is garbage
Dak Prescot moved the ball in the 4th quarter because the 49ers played without Fred Warner and Nick Bosa. So stop saying we ran out of time. Just be graceful and say the better team today won.
Yeah, you cut them to pieces during the game,  but at the end you acted like they deserved to win.
1st the penalties absolutely did hurt the Cowboys big time. This was a 5 point game.   2nd for a defense that isn't horrible, they let Jimmy G have more success than he should have had  3rd and finally the Cowboys not having a shot at the endzone was 100% Dak's fault. He knows how much time is left. He needed to slide way sooner. That's on him.    But you can't have over 100 yards in penalties plus probably another 100 yards of offense negated due to the 100 yards you got set back in penalties... and expect to win. Yet they had a semblance of a shot.  As a Packers fan, I'm glad Mikes over there with you guys in Jerry world.
Sharpe is a hater
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡 Dollass Clownboys
The niners have won they're last game this year
We can blame the coach and players. But the one constant in the last 25 years is Jerry Jones
I don't think enough credit is going to the 49er defense. They had 13 minutes of possession vs dallas 2 minutes in the first quarter.  That defense held them to no production and it allowed the 9er offense to run the clock.    They got injured on defense which is why Dallas was able to come back into it.
5:10 shannon: "Last night I slept like a baby. Lord help I can awake up and give to Skip."  🤣
The only thing yesterday was worth their pay was the jumbo cheesesteak everything else overpriced
The cases of dew has to be code for money or something cuz I know Shannon ain’t drinking dew
“Underperforming bums” 😭😭😭
Skip! 😂😂😂😂
lol
Skip is the man but Shannon is perfect in this 😂
Skip and other fans can say " the Cowboys are better then then 49ers, they just didnt show up" all they want. End of the day commitment and discipline will almost always trump talent. Sure the Boyz might be "more talented", but they certainly weren't the better team. As a Cowboys fan I'm glad I didn't buy into the December hype. Been a lifelong fan but I've had to emotionally disconnect from them slowly over the last 5 years. The management, coaching, and overall culture is garbage. I wasnt even surprised but I was disgusted by their performance. Dak is decent but he's shown he's not elite. Zeke whom I was considered one of the premier true runners in the league is now a bum when it comes to pounding the ball and gets paid top dollar for pass protection in the back field. Ceedee is great after the catch but has gives up to easily when pressed and fails to frequently get separation. Bunch of overrated guys on this team. Jerry can fire McCarthy but they need to hire a GM and let him bring a real coach in. Until then my team is just a reality TV show.
As soon as that game was over I knew Shannon was going to give it to skip this morning
Im not even mad… because these guys are always sleep in the first half of the game. The camera moves over to dak and he looks lost than it moves to zeke and he’s staring into space with his mouth open. Just lost
The way Jerry gouge you on ticket prices and parking My only satisfaction about being there yesterday was at least he getting gouged too by his team!
This was well worth waking up early on a day off from work, just to see Skip and Shannon's reactions after my Niners won yesterday!
My eagles lost in the most eagles way and it bad but nothing makes me happier to see the “this is the year we win the Superbowl cowboys fans” cry get mad you name it so In the name of all that is awesome and beautiful….HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!!!!!! Let’s go Eagles!!!!!….Lets go home!
You guys may be the most entertaining football analysts streaming today.  👍🏻
LMAO! Ok, now looking for another dose of laughs with country Steven A.
Dak under and over threw many passes and the penalty’s show the undisciplined coaching they have been receiving from the head coach but not only that the 49rs did a great job of making sure the defense didn’t make many plays by not throwing to trevon diggs also limiting the amount of throws jimmy g was allowed and let that run game show against the cowboys and the 49rs ran the cowboys out of that zone defense they were playing all game
Jimmy isn’t going to throw a lot against Green Bay mark my words last time we played them in the playoffs he threw 8 passes might be about 12 this time
Give it to him Shannon don't let up off skip's neck... But wait next year they'll be back on that bandwagon that the good old cowboys are going to win the Super Bowl.🤣🤣🤣
The cowboys fan in the thumbnail is the same lady Stephen A Smith showed on first take. Seems like some copying is going on
Skip you sound like a Lions fan my guy. Loser talk.
One sided refs all game
He moved the ball twice, causing more seconds to waste.. Regardless the 14 penalties, especially the trash Gregory offsides ones, cost them the game. But the ref did it prior to the final play when he stood in the way after the fake punt was executed and caused a delay in game when both the offense and defense were set. So refs had a factor in this game but the Cowboys did beat themselves.
As a Saints fan that used to LITERALLY wear paper bags on my head because my team was so bad.....Damn, this was impressive 😂🤣🤣🤣
Skip says the cowboys are better than the niners.  Final score aside, the niners could have won this game by more had they not made mistakes at critical points in the game.  Did he not see SF go right down the field opening drive?
Lol shannon
This episode of undisputed is going to be called Skip Bayless 101 excuses why the Cowboys lost  1. Its the referees fault  and 101. It’s Shannon Sharpe fault  he jinx’s the Cowboys
Skip looks like he's crying blaming the ref 🤣
"I was like Lawd pls let me just open my eyes tomorrow...And give it to skip Bayless!!" 😂
Jimmy gaag🤣🤣🤣
Good cop , bad cop.
Has noone told Skip that Dak has to make sure the ref gets that ball and sets it, not the center? Why is he blaming the ref? That was all Daks fault, for not sliding sooner and not handing the ball to the ref.
Cowboys are trash 🗑 Lmaooo
That lady in the thumbnail LOOOOOOOOL
Skip don't care about the Cowboys. He's just an entertainer playing a role. Wake up people 😴 🙄
Bro that one chick was absolutely balling with 5 minutes left hahaha
I still think NFL is fixed
Damn Shannon’s teeth on point 😮‍💨
Fire McCarthy! Oh wait I forgot he's white not a coach of color. Sorry my bad🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cowboys offense was pathetic. Run game non existent, couldn't move the ball majority of the game then when they had a slim chance at the end Dak makes the greatest play in playoffs history 🤣
Bro say super gremlin
Jerry Jones gave $75,000,000.00 to Dak for an 0-1 playoff record in 2021/22  ---- but, Jones only has to pay Dak $20,000,000.00 for next year's loss
How my man Skipper the Dripper hasn’t got a Mountain Dew sponsor by now is beyond me
The cowboys played a real team that’s why they lost just saying
Alright credit to skip for all those wrongs.
I've never been this disappointed with my cowboys
They ain’t better than the 9ers gtfoh skip
I dont normally watch skip, but when I do its once a year when the Cowboys are eliminated😂😂
Skip try to get the umpire beat up, exposing that man whole name and place of employment 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
SKIYUP MAD WE REJOICE
Barney is a wanna be steven a smith
L to skip
This is more like a WWE promo than a sports talk show
Jesus Christ Shannon went IN!!!! 😂😂😂
They dnt wana tell yall one of them got a positive c19 test reasons why they not n the studio together
Shannon is right
Skip doing coke before the show 😂😂
"How Bout Them COWBOYS" 🤣🤣🤣
his Cowboys???? Does Skip work for the Cowboys? Part owner?
Hate to say it but the cowboys need a quarterback
"1-2-3 pack yo bags 1-2-3 CANCUN!!!"-Shannon Sharpe
All fans say, "this year my team is going all the way!" Thing is, Cowboy fans are so effing arrogant and get angry so easily than other fans from other teams I've sat and watched games with. Dak should be suspended a game or two for the nest season.
Skip...you did play not one dam down....let alone, didn't suit up....your team....put on a helmet....keyboard man...
He will never learn that's why he is now called skip clueless give it up on the cowboys
May we see another sad Skip next week if his golden boy Brady loses? One can only hope.
Have to throw throw throw not enough time to run
This was without a doubt, the  most anticipated video we ALL wanted to see since the clock ran to 0:00 Sunday evening. lol
Skip, why didn't Zak just hold onto the ball and give it to the official instead handing it to the center, causing the ref to have to crash in and grab the ball from the ground as fast as he could? He was actually trying to help the Cowboys.
The way the ref gave a statement, dropped the mic and then ran off the field was 1 of the funniest things ive ever saw.
That scramble play was a cop out by McCarthy and Dak to save his Offense's "feelings" if they blew a last second endzone play for all the marbles. Blaming the refs seems easier than totally owning up.
I had to roll a phat joint for this one.....
Skip is gettin melted. Unc is on one.
Cowgirls suc
Skip face it our cowboys aren't that good
Nick bosa and fred warner leaving the game is the ONLY reason the cowboys came back at all in the game
If Jenny had a body, she would be elite 🥛
Why aren’t they in the studio? When did they start video chatting?
Niners to strong and more talented than the overpaid cowgirls 🤣
Why does that guy always shout?
Disappointing overrated overpaid prima donnas that are poorly coached and managed.
Give unc is DEW‼️
5:31 IM CRYING
What waste of air time. Who cares if the cowboys lost, just give the people what they want and stop talking about them.
fire ur sound engineer
The bootleg channel got ALL the views for this video already 😂😂😭😭
Better to gag than choke
Why does all Dallas fans blame the refs?
Rooting for the cowboys is like having a girlfriend that always disappoints
Skips tears are funnier than all the crying Cowshit fans yesterday!! Lol!
At-home-Jenny is sooo adorable! <3
Poor leadership blaming the referee, you QB and head coach don’t know the rules and somehow the referee to blame?
I hate that they aren’t in studio. I wanted some ITS MY TURN ITS MY TURN from skip. This is very disappointing.
Why does Shannon hate Dallas so much?  I will say I feel bad for the Dallas fans but at least the game was close. As a NE fan I know what I'm talking about. Now we're on to baseball.
The 49ers and refs tried to give the Cowboys that win many times.  The better team just won.
Neither of these teams were gonna beat Rodgers or Brady anyway.
The thumbnail >😂🔥
That loss had nothing to do with the ref
skip looks like he wants to die hahahahaha
Skip and Shannon got the best show!!! Me and my friends sitting here laughing and enjoying this episode!!!
And can you believe that out of those 111 yards he threw for in the 4Th 50+ we're on that last drive when they were not guarding anyone. He still played  like 🔥 🗑️
Skip, my friend, the Cowboys wouldn't have been in a position to tie the score on a Hail Mary pass in the first place if the officials hadn't STOLEN the first down from the 49ers with that questionable and completely unprecedented repositioning of the ball to make it short by an inch and then calling that highly suspicious penalty on Williams for not setting before the snap.
The Niners are the better team
The cowboys fans they gonna cry in the car , house, family members house, sports bar, friends house damn that's tough
"They are what we thought they were, and we didn't  let them off the hook!" hahahahahahahaha LOL
I love skip energy today
Shannon listen to tht Kodak
Skip is consistent.... He gets disappointed at the Cowboys every year
I have been watching Skip Bayless since Cold Pizza.....I have NEVER SEEN him this emotional about the Cowboys....this is HILARIOUS to watch... .OMFG
Look at the herd cowboys fans
Skip bouta give himself an aneurysm, needs to relax realistically he shouldve been ready for disappointment, i mean really Mike McCarthy?!? EVERYONE knew he road the coattails of Favre and Rodgers, you dont think Aaron would have tried to get Green Bay to keep him if he was any good?? Cowboys probably arent going to win many playoff games until Jerry Jones either dies or gets so senile that they have to take control of the team from him and hand it over to his son Stephen.
Shannon is irrelevant. Smoke a black and mild drink Hennessy and choke on it
Skip is soooo salty and in denial it's almost pathetic to watch and hear...... Almost. 🤣🤣🤣
Can you imagine Shannon and Stephan A going at Skip at the same time about the Cowboys skip would have a heart attack
Like I commented to SAS... Laugh now. But Karma will come back. Oh and don't forget when you played for the Donkeys, the amount of tears your fans shed. So there.
Anger was the MVP for Dallas and kept giving the defense leverage. Can't say I remember when was the last time I've seen the punter be the best player for a team in a playoff game.
Skip 🍟’d
Every year it's the Cowboys year to win the Super Bowl!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let’s go 49ers
Unk like Kodak lol super grimlin lol 😂 nice 👍🏾
McCarthy is a BUM! come out flat, making penaltys like a highschool team, Zeke is washed after Jerry paid him early. He just smokes and plays video games on twitch.... I'm a Cowboys fan but I knew this ish was coming
"Under performing bum's" Damn Shannon!
How come they didn't do anything they did all season. Dallas can never get a win against a 500 team. Maybe I can go with Pittsburgh. At least the owner let's the coach coach
Lol Shannon was getting in skip’s cheeks
hahahaah the sneak diss to Irvin was hilarious !
Lmao I used to like Skip Bayless but the more I watch the shows and everything like that you really doesn't know what he's talking about he's one of the worst analyst ever up there with Stephen a Smith
SKIP BAYLESS'S HAD A BAD DAY AFTER WATCHING THE COWBOYS LOSE AGAIN ! Let's get some respect for the San Francisco 49ers who was the only road team to win an NFL playoff but to beat those boys in Dallas this is the same 49ers that went to the playoffs 3 years ago against the Kansas City Chiefs but for the cowboys penalized 14 times no running game mental mistakes no wonder they got beat ?   EATING CROW  A SIP OF BITTER 🍷 AND A SLICE OF HUMBLE 🥧 ! WELL AT LEAST SKIP BAYLESS IS GOING TO HAVE TO STOMACH THAT BITTER 💊 ALONG WITH THE COWBOY FANS UNTIL NEXT SEASON HOPEFULLY THEY CHANGE THEIR NAME TO THE DALLAS CRY BOYS 😭 !
Parsons gave the 49ers some billiton board material to use against the cowboys talking about playing bully ball against them.
Skip ur pathetic!! Give d Niners their respect!!! They BEAT ur team!!! Stop blaming the refs!! Ur defense slowed down our offense in the 4th.. ok..🙄.. we shut down your offense the whole game!! Thats why we won !!! Dak..zeke..pollard..lamb.. no one did anything!! Why... because the niners BIG  BAD DEFENSE!! Thats why!! Give em their credit!!  Skip and fans like skip are the reason people hate the cowboys!! Man up stop being a sore loser!!
14 penalties! Under prepared! Lack of Discipline! And miss opportunities! Like our coaches use to tell us! Don't let the referees determine the outcome of the game! Hat's off to our defense! You guys carried us all year!
Not the refs fault. McCarthy’s fault for not taking shots into the end zone. The goal is to get more points, not yards.
Truly a depressing loss. Mental lapses beat the Cowboys. You have to give credit to the Niners, but they would have lost this game had the Cowboys had any resemblance of discipline at all.
We gotta start using pollard
The 49ers was just a bad Match-up for the Cowboys simple as that
The penalties were a direct effect because the 49ers were too good. The 49ers D line was being held on almost every pass play. The Cowboys offensive line was deathly afraid of that rush, causing the penalties. The Cowboys frustration caused them to take frustration penalties.
DaLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLas didnt cross the 50 yard line till midway 2nd quarter. What a joke.
Skip should have started by saying “I have been wrong about my Dallas Cowboys…FOR THE LAST 26 YEARS”
Jacksonville has twice as many playoff wins than Dallas the last quarter century.
Dam Skip you loosing it. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love skip 🤣🤣🤣
😂 😂 Sorry Cowgirls CHOKED AGAIN! 😂 😂
Skip is a crackhead
In classic fashion, a Dallas fan is trying to justify bad play.
Dak and zeke are all time thieves. The money the6 got paid for being bust every single time it counts.  That’s what happens when your owner is the president, gm, coach and draft players listening to his 2 grand daughters lol. A joke of organization. As long as Jerry is there you will lose. He picks bums and bd characters to help them to be a father figure. Bad owner, bad coach, average qb and rb who takes too much cash on the cap.
If that had  happened to the niners and they lost like that any dedicated niner fan should know “you don’t put the game in the ref’s hands.” Cowboys should have never been in that position. They made the niner defense look very very decent. Their O has problems but is better than that. As a niner fan Im filled with glee much like Shannon and Stephen A, but i gotta say one percent of me does feel bad because I wanted them to lose… but DAMN not like that! 😂
*Skip gotta sit here and take all of this and Shannon was having a field day 😂….and I haven’t gotten over to hear Stephen A yet* 🤣
Said the same thing. Think about Dak vs Romo.   Romo during his time with the Cowboys had an NFC East that was the top 1-2 division for most of his time in the league. He played with an average O line & with no running game for most of this career with a terrible defense and HC/OC in Garrett. And Tony still won. He beat great teams and willed the Cowboys to victory so many times. He also didn't have as man comeback games as Dak because Romo never let the Cowboys get down like Dak does. Dak also benefits from so many bad teams now in the NFC/NFL in general that he pads his stats in garbage time or just against really bad teams in general.  Romo made things happen. He had a super high football IQ. I know if Romo could still play after being away, he would be absolutely scary after the knowledge he's accumulated. It sucks his injuries cost him the last years because he could have won with the team Dak had in 16-18.  The year Dak took over when Romo got hurt in 2016, the Cowboys were loaded for a SB run. They got Zek and had the top O line and weapons all around. Dak was new and got to ride that RB and O line and easy schedule. Lost in the 1st round and they should have played Romo.  2017 with overall hard schedule, they miss the playoffs. Dak has to play hard teams due to previous season and teams start to figure him out.   2018 with overall easy schedule and NFC East they make the playoffs again. Dak gets to play easy teams. Loses against the Rams in playoffs.   2019 with overall hard schedule, they miss the playoffs. Dak has to play hard teams due to previous season and teams know his game by now.  2020 Next year with overall easy schedule and NFC East but Dak gets hurt. Would have made playoffs this year due to schedule.  2021 Next year with overall easy schedule again and NFC East  Dak gets to play easy teams. Loses against the Rams in playoffs.   See the pattern here? Hard schedule they lose and miss. Next year with easy schedule Dak wins and then loses against the hard teams in the playoffs.  This year he lost to the majority of good teams during the season and mainly played 6 easy games vs the NFC East and then the bottom teams in each NFC division.  It baffles my mind that they paid him that money & think his stats deserved that money. They should have broken his stats down by vs teams with winning records over his career and teams with losing records over his career during each season.
cowboys will never win a superbowl with dak sorry to say.. how about them cowboys lmao
😂😂😂 ROFLMAO 🤣🤣🤣
Skip when u hurt 😢  I’m hurt 😢  LoL 😂 😝  Skip look like he crying 😭 n 💩
that opening of the show LOL  " I was WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG"
I’m a cowboys fan n the refs was not a problem them boys have ZERO DISCIPLINE
Leaders don't condone throwing garbage at the reffs.  You own your mistakes.  I don't remember Dak ever excepting his failures.
I think Diet Mt Dew is code for hand relief.
Blaming the ref is such a bad take. Bottom line losers lose and dak is a loser and will never win anything. BTW I'm a cowboys fan
Lol shannon sounded like he was making a wrestling promo.
That "under-performing Bums!!" killed me!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 It came out of nowhere 4:22
Dang Shannon bumbs
I just LOVE Shannon!!!
America's so called team is a comedy. The characters change thru the years but the laughter is non stop!! THANK YOU MR JONES.
This was so sad I can't even cry ,
😂😂😂 Unc Shay Shay
Finally gone. Just an average team Cowboys nation. Beat up the poor teams, lose against a winning record team. Dak 15-25 I think against a winning team 😆
Sweet delicious tears taste soooooo good 😋. Thanks, I knew we could count on you Cowgirls!
I love when DaLLLLLLLLLLLas loses on an awkward play. The Cowboys will do Cowboy's things.
Why is everybody talking about the last play ??!! We had a whole 4 qtrs to compete n win
How about them cowgirls lol
Skip ain’t get no sleep , 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Why isn’t the segments this long when the Lebrons lose 🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️🤷🏾‍♂️
Eat your words again Skip. Never bet against the Niners!
Mike McCarthy is a horrible coach
The lesson, Skip, is never put all your emotional eggs in one basket.  Aside from Deebo, the Niners didn't play that well. This was Dallas' game to lose and, wonder of wonders, they lost.  Now, let's see what Scooter has to say, if he's stopped banging his head against the wall.
I didn't know Skip owned a part of the Dallas Cowboys? With all these we's. LOL
What the cowboys should do now is never pay for expensive players and just get young ones to win cuss every time THEY GET PAID THEY JUST TURN INTO GARBAGE AND DAK never deserved that contract
I’ve been waiting for this😂😂😂🤣🤣. It’s ok Cowboys. NYG, WFT, and us Eagles welcomes y’all to come sit with us on the couch and watch the remaining part of the season.
Actually it was there fault.Every coach i had told us in the 2 minute drill always hand the official the ball.Your boys tried to spot it on there own
Did Shannon call himself a super Gremlin 🤔? Nah bro. That visual is not even funny.
The cowboys are victims to their own arrogance every year.
I hope everyone takes a step and doesn't put everything as Dak's fault. That entire team is to blame. Dak had it rough through that game and the penalties on the defense and offense that messed up most of their good plays. It was atrocious and if someone blames just Dak, there is massive problem with them.
The Hard Knocks Curse..  some one should write a Counrty song bout the ending of Dat game..
Skip ain't gonna be around long enough to drink 37 cases of diet dew lol
Funny how zeke Elliot ever since seeing him on twitch saying he was faded hasn’t played the same. No one ever says what is happening what’s happening is zeke is lazy marijuana makes you lazy and slow and I’m sorry but the fact that no one says that shocks me. Zeke thinks he is Ricky Williams who used to love and still loves marijuana but he always did his job to the fullest. I’m shocked how the cowboys have kept this player after seeing he isn’t any good as a RB
The umpire is not located  behind the linebackers like “back in the day”. If you play  or watch football you know if you run forward and the umpire is behind, he would have to run further to reach the new line of scrimmage to spot the ball.
Skipp is 😡😡😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Skip is wrong. That last draw play was idiotic
It always starts as how about them cowboys???? and ends how cowboys???? lmfaooooo
It was the bad luck of the draw for the Cowboys because NO TEAM wants to see the 49ers for a one and done game, Green bay better be careful also...
The cowboys fan reaction is priceless during last nights game. 😂🤣😹
Why aren’t they in the studio?
One of the biggest problems with the Dallas Cowboys (and there are many) is the player begin to believe the press releases that they are all that and a bag of chips.  The stupid comments by Parsons about 'becoming legends' the week leading up to this game made me gag!  Dak claiming he wasn't in a slump was just butkus!  What needs to happen is what happened in the movie Major League where the players had all the perks taken away from them.  These stinkin' millionaires need all the Taj Mahal perks Jerry is giving them need to be taken away and get them back to playing freakin' football!!!
HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS!!!
Did you say they were gonna win sum games ... 😆
Cowboys gonna do cowboyish things
FirstTake Was Better Today , Stephen A Smith And Playmaker Was Amazing
I have never seen so much hate for the Cowboys unbelievable. I feel so bad for the fans.
1&Done Skip!
SHANNON SHARP IS A BULLY! LEAVE ME ALONE!
Skip swears like Dak and the cowboys woke up in the 4th qtr 🤣 nahhh Jimmy INT let yall back into the game! Niners outplayed the cowboys plain and simple not to mention the multiple self inflicted penalties. Just an embarrassing showing overall.
Someone finna make a meme out of these 😂
5:30 I’m crying 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shannon = Hall of Fame / skip = Hall of Shame 🤡
Skip is the greatest sports debater of all time.
PLEASE, PLEASE  SOMEONE GET A DEMOROL FOR SKIP HE MIGHT HAVE A HEART ATTACK
u mean the 49ers sonned the cowboys lol
The Niners tried their best to give that game away but the Cowboys refused to accept it 😆 🤣 😂
I love these two together, pure entertainment 🤣🤣🤣
Did yall see this fake towels?
Since the very first possession i automatically saw that the 9ers came to play...... but congrats 9ers fans , im rooting for you.
I have to admit that Shannon is right about Dak.  Dak does have a lot of Tony Romo tendencies.
That cowboy's loss was so satisfying cause I knew skip was gone be sick lol
😂 only if Skip didn’t have covid or else if they sat across from each other this would’ve been golden
why are they not in the same room
Love the confidence in just needing one more second on the clock...lmfao! What a joke. You do not run a qb sneak with 14 seconds left with no timeouts! Amazing! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Lmao@Skip...Leave that Ref alone....You lost.
I love skip lmao
What happened to the Cowboys #11 he said legends were made ,he runs his mouth too early ,too fast he was nothing in that game .
Condolences 🙏 to my guy Drip 💦 Bayless, How bout them Cowboys!?!? 🤣🤣🤣
Dallas, Philadelphia,  and Indy have no Qb's!!
Man i love watching these two go at it lol
No excuses, they lost that game. Find the ref, hand him the ball. Undisciplined teams do undisciplined things.
Jenny is beautiful
How bout them cowboys 😂😂
In the Cowboys defense, they do have a lot of young stars that will only get better. They might be a couple seasons away from a SB. But it’s their annoying fans and Skip that make me not like them.
Skip is absolutely wrong.    It is not the refs job to make sure Cowboys has time on the clock when they ran a running play with no timeouts.   Cowboys don't to spot the ball that is the ref's job.
This is always a must see when Dallas loses😂
Skip stop making excuses ! They shouldn’t have run the football
Skip and his flat out bad takes.he behaves like a spoil rotten kid.
I was SOOOO excited watching that Cowboys game for one reason and one reason alone. To watch that smug, entitled, self important smirk wiped cleanly off of the face of Flip Brainless. Pouring myself a nice cup of tea while I lean back and enjoy this @$$ whopping ol Flip is about to take. Sometimes the universe gets it right. 💯😌
I HATE THE COWGIRLS LOL . EAGLES 🦅 ALL DAY
Skip’s repeated use of “we” is enough for me to eternally hate cowboys fans
We shut  out the Dallas cowboys
Let me tell y’all something I cant indict anyone Kyle shanahan may be best offensive mind in the game ..and he hasn’t reached his prime
Okay my boys lost but Shannon broncos didn't evening make it and some of yall team didn't get n the playoffs
The term Cowboy was invented as an insult by Drovers.
How is skip whenever he says lebron not the goat 0:11
Skip is delusional just making excuse after excuse.. That empire was not late they weren't even set when he got there.. Shannon said everything that needed to be said.. Skip go home you sound like a non football player
Jenny 😩😍
Why do they call mountain due the breakfast of champions ? Drink that for breakfast every day and you gonna end up pretty bad
I can’t agree with skip enough 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
The Cowboys were overrated and overmatched. The 49ers are better In Every phase of the game except special teams. The 49ers played not to lose in the second half. The only reason it was close.
I’m starting to think the “dew” is cash and they use Mountain Dew on tv so they don’t get in trouble lol
Sometimes, its so hard to listen to Skip... I never seen someone so smart make so many excuses....smh
Fire Mike Mc…and hire Eric B (chiefs OC) or Leftwich (Bucs OC)! Penalties and Clock management are directly tied to coaching!
😂🤣😅😆😁😄😃 SKIIIIIIP!
I can tell you the problem Kellen Moore Dak Prescott and Zeke fire them and you'll do better haha
Skip acted just like a cowboys fan after Shannon let him have it lol
Church Clock; To know how much time is left without looking at the clock. It's an awareness attribute
Shannon is being such a sick ! Lol
I lost faith after losing to a injured Arizona in this exact way. So this loss doesn't hurt too much.
One of skips most outrageous takes, busch light is the nectar of the gods not diet Mountain Dew
DEBO SAMUELS HAD THE FIRST DOWN
They always do cowboy things there were simply terrible I had so much fun watching that comedy show of the cowboys 🤣🤣🤣
Shanon said he would wear a 9ers jersey if they win
The 49ers were simply the better team.
Oakland raiders ayyyye lol
Not Shannon quoting Kodak black
Damn Unc Destroyed skip! 🤣🙌🏼
Why are them not together?
You did tho skip
Its not just Skip. Vegas bets, Pro Football Focus, and all these stat metrics are ALWAYS favoring the Cowboys, and I never understand why.  What heartbreak... In these dark times, Jenny's smile always cheers me up. She definitely has "the glow"
Flip Bayless 👊🤣
Deebo Samuel is better than anyone on the Cowboys by far
Why Jenny wearing airpods & other 2 don't? What is purpose of them airpods?
We got robbed not once but twice from the refs that game 😔 DC4L baby!!!
Clownboys choke season right on schedule every season as per usual 😂
Skip keep trying to blame the ref. The denial is strong in this one.
The Cowboys had a relatively easy regular season schedule and got found out by a team that finished third in the NFC West. Over rated team as usual. They believed their own hype.
Why aren't they in the studio????
LMAO 🤣😂😂 Prescott making $7 dollar and 50 cent an hour.
I am now an Official Jerry Jones fan! Way to go old man, you keep doing just what you’re doing.
You can see the pain in skips eyes 😂😂
Classic Undisputed!
We have to give my niners some credit , this dallas team does not have to play west teams like we do and they weren't ready for us  to me it was just a mirage that all .over rated team ,and i love when we are underdogs most of the time .
Uncle Shay doing his best Dennis Green impression lol
That black lady is gonna be a permanent meme. A symbol of the heartaches Cowboys fans been dealing since Bill Parcells was no longer coaching them.
Skip tried sneaking in that his Dallas Cowboys lost to a 49ers team that they are better than. Skip, they are not better, they are worse, and yesterday proved it. Home losses do that. Nice try.
I always liked dak until he started opening his mouth
Genuis
Oh Shannon you're so mean!! Hahahahaha
Skip is an idiot. If the ref didn't run through dak he would have had to go around them and it would have took longer 🤦🏼‍♂️
QB Draw is fine if Dak gets down 5-10 yards sooner
How about them cowgirls
This is what I waited for the second the refs started running off the field!
1st place NFC East lost to a 3rd place NFC West team in the playoffs Let that sink in  Cowboys is a dwarf among hobbits in their divison
Shannon on skips neck lmfao
Cowboy fans today "You know we going to the Super Bowl next year"
I hate the fan base and I hate how every year Dallas supposedly one of the best teams in the league and they always disappoint.
Cowboy fans gone learn today 😆
Skip disrespecting falcons legend Damontae Kazee shakes me to my core
DAK PRESCOTT ISN'T READY.  the games to fast for him.  Brady doesn't have that problem.  Take Brady to Dallas he wins a superbowl.  Too much talent not to win.  What's the excuse this time dak... refs. Clock. Trash. Fans.   Let guess will continue to get better.  There's no more games left.. you fall under pressure.  Move on.
Consider how bad the beating would have been if the studs on the SF D line didn't leave the game wit injuries. The score would have been 37-7.
My Stephen A. Line ran through my head "Just wait, they'll never let you down. What can go wrong, will go wrong..." 🤣🤣🤣
Somebody give skip some water
I don’t even like the cowboys but I wanted a Súper bowl for jerry jones dak Is trash the moment was to big for him and you could tell
Skip, better not ever pick my 9ers.
Bums they went 12-5  Skip handled Shannon easily lol and Skips a clown
The Cowboys could have just scored 20 per quarter and they would have won. That’s about as good of argument then blaming the refs.
Skip skip Ramon ain’t no pro athlete man was trying his best🤦🏿‍♂️🤣
cool. talk about other teams.
There should be a graphic with the mountain dew count.
CRASH N BURN COWBOYS????
1 minute in, and this is comedy lmao 🤣🤣
Man I've been waiting for this since yesterday afternoon lmao 🤣.
Cowboys clearly are over paying for a 4th qrt qb and a running back that is mediocre
Even Vick said they never practiced a QB draw with that amount of time left cause they never thought it was needed lol
Cowboys are not the better team. They padded those wins playing in the NFC East. 49ers has to play in the NFC West which was much harder.
No, Skip. My Niners are MUCH better than your Cowboys. That's why they won. Dak messed that play up. It wasn't on the ref. It was ON DAK. 🤦🏽‍♀️🤦🏽‍♀️
After the game I knew I had to see Shannon and skip and I had to see Stephen A. Priceless.
I don’t hear nothing about the offensive coordinator….Moore sucks! So do the cowboys, McCarthy and the refs !
If the Cowboys had half of their penalty yards against them back they would've won and that speaks volumes.
Dude skip is on suicide watch 😹
Man the way them Cowboy fans were sobbing and crying you'd think their entire life ended😂😂🤣
Cry me a river Skip!!!  Refs did NOT cost the cowboys! If Dak hands the ball to the ref this works out. Instead he hands it to the C. Ref owes them nothing.
Once the game was over I was waiting to see Skip's reaction on the show. I said I bet he'd blame the ref.
Love it one and done go to your hero now skip Brady and the stinko bucs with sorry nfc schedule 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Skip are you seriously arguing the ref should been treated as if he is one of the player and somehow he the ref didn't make the "play", meaning setting the ball down as if it was a play called by the coach?? Ref can only do what he can do, he was running, he had to tackle Dak out of the way to set the ball. Why Dak and the center didn't get out the way?
They deserved to lose, they were out of shape and lazy. That the only reason for all those penalties. Throw the ball to the end zone, you needed a touchdown.
Skip Ramon George is not Turbo charged ref he did his best Skip
I wish they woulda done this together cuz  Shannon woulda rubbed it in REAL good lol. Go crygirls
You know who beat the Cowboys? The 49ers by the numbers but reality says the Cowboys beat the Cowboys.
So tired of the same old same ol
Man i have been a Cowboy fan my whole life just because of where i live..but i knew the Cowboys weren't gonna beat the 49ers with Dak..i mean he is a good guy he just isn't a good QB, he will always find a way to lose big games..ALWAYS fans and it wont change.
Go watch the Packers and 49ers game earlier this year. Refs were trailing Rodgers and multiple refs were ready
He keep saying can we see the play. I wish they show the dam play
I love seeing Skip cry 😭😂😂😂
I am a Cowboys fan and I have to admit, Shannon was right about us this whole season. We were outcoached, outplayed and outsmarted. Lack of discipline is our biggest problem, which starts with our coach. Not to mention, our overrated offensive line. I'm still a fan for life, but we earned this loss with penalties and no blocking.
I knew it was over last week when the Cowboys kept patting themselves on the back for beating up the Philadelphia practice squad.
I was hoping Shannon would go nuclear and invite special guest Stephen A Smith on to tag team Skip.
Cowboys got punched in the mouth. Game over Skippy.
I’m so proud of Skip today
The ref said:"The game is over"  and then ran for his life! Wtf
One thing that would immediately show them improvements next season is if McCarthy made the entire team watch a mandatory penalty awareness meeting EVERY week. There is no way you can be the most penalized team in the league and expect to carry that over into the playoffs and achieve ANYTHING. They literally need to be tought how to play their own damn game, becuase it's embarrassing that this team doesnt even know the rules. I want them too literally look over every penalty and every rule for every position and every play, every week. The problem starts with the penalties.
Poor Skip… Shannon needs to buy him a Mountain Dew flavored Lollipop… lmao
Shannon called the Cowboys a bunch of bums 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone remember zeke elliot??
And still, after all the facts about the Cowboys being an over rated faux paper champion team, can't play under pressure against good teams, piling up penalty yards because they're undisciplined ...Skip wants to blame officiating.
Bottom line is everyone the Cowboys beat up on sucked. When they beat the Eagles and Pats those teams were a work in progress with new QBs. So really the Cowboys were going into the playoffs with 0 quality wins under their belt. It's not a shocker that a team with 0 quality wins loses in first round.
The Cowboys were just a good team in a terrible division. This coming from a Cowboys fan.
You were wrong skip. 🤩
Who does a QB Draw with such little time left on the clock and no timeouts. The  linesman didn't know the play he was going to run. Hence why you get 40 seconds for each play lol
Skips take today gave me life 😂😂😂✊🏽
If Skip screaming that mean his pick lost lol
Hahahaha skip is a sad old loser hahahaha
Dak is the king of junk time to make him look good
5:31
as much as i wanted to hear “HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!” this was more funnier overall 😂
I knew this game was over when they showed both teams before they came out of the tunnel. 49ers had that ENERGY and was ready to rock some heads! Cowboys was all nervous and shi and swaying back n forth and tight. Any football player who saw that was like aahhh shii 'dem boyz' ain't ready
My 49ers put it on them cowgirls nice baby it feels great baby
Why does skip look like he does co ca i ne
damn they didnt talk about the Lakers today huh haha
Cowboys fans are dealing with mike McCarthy and feeling the same pain packers fans dealt with for most of his time in GreenBay
Funny skip says dak and ceedee have no connection but clda sworn skip kept saying ceedee is going to change life in dallas lol...droppity drop drop trash trash trash
that qb draw was the dumbest play I've ever seen - I said  just before that play -  one tackle in the field and the game is over San Fran. I think it's perfect Dallas went down on very public EPIC stupidity- they were never in the game at all till  49ers gave em a  few late turnovers -    Skip do a segment on NFC east teams believing their own propaganda and how nobody should have ever called the cowpokes  America's team
WHAT HAPPENS WILL HAPPEN ......COWBOYS WILL DO COWBOYS THINGS 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Skip is gonna have a heart attack. How bout dem boys now, excuse laden crybaby.
Definitely sum bums
A grown man acting like a juvenile!
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS?! lmao
No Skip,  The umpire wasn't late.  But he did spot the ball wrong.  Dak's slide started 3 yards from the spot.  If you are going to draw, if you are going to slide, make sure you hand the ball to an official and not your own lineman.   Then make sure your team gives the official a path to the ball.  And let him or her spot it correctly.  The official goes as fast as the can.  That's part of the play.  You want to stop the clock?  Save a time-out or slide 5-7 yards earlier to assure that it will get done in time.  They did not deserve a second of added time.
They always say if we can see this play but we NEVER see the play.
Dallas Cryboys?🤣🤣🤣
Anyone think SAS left Skip a VM of himself just laughing manically and yelling HOW BOUT DEM COWBOYS!?!!!
"It's Odell's fault!"  -Skip Bayless.
Shannon's revenge.  Skip continually beats down Shannon for the failures of his Lakers. About time Skip has a taste of his own medicine. Cowboys sucked yesterday. Lol.
When is Skip going to learn that the Cowboys are not better than the 49ers just because Jimmy is mediocre????
Skip is really fuming 😡 right now!!!!
Turnover Ratio is important team stat but it's meaningless to bring up. Cuz turnovers are just 100% luck and freakish occurrences. Bragging bout leading NFL in turnover Ratio is like the guy who catches the most fish at the pond. No skill to it! Just pure good or bad luck.
parsons would of been a better option at qb and rb
I felt bad for Cowboys fans. They were Really hurting man.
never seen a team play as bad as the cowboy did last night,the o line couldn't even line up look like a pop warner game
Skip cried in the car lol
The curse of Jerry Jones at it again if he had kept Jimmy Johnson head coach back in the 90s he wouldn't have the curse on his team now🤣🤣🤣🤣
Are they not in studio wtf is this
I knew it was going to be a  long day when San Francisco on the first drive of the game took it right down their  throats and scored.  That first drive was the  ballgame.
When Dak is QB (i.e. captain of the offense) and being paid so much money, he really needs to understand situational as well as the rules for football, especially in the NFL playoffs.  For example, Dak should have got the ball and ran it to the referee in order for him to spot the ball.  However, he didn't do that because he handed it to his center and the referee came in later to spot it.  Also, the referee needed to fight his way through the line in order to spot the ball.
Skip is hilarious 😂
Ngl there needs to be some type of amendment to the rule especially at the end of the game. There should have been at 1-3 seconds on the clock. It was the referee getting to the ball late. That wasn’t cool. N I’m a ravens fan but I felt that was just wrong
I actually used to like this show alot Undisputed,before it became strictly a Dallas Cowboys show.
"The World is a Stage...and everyone has a part to Play in it."  For sometime now, I have come to comprehend that The NFL is an  "Entertainment Business."   Which means... It is designed to  Make Billions off people who  Can't get it is Rigged. (It didn't use to be, but now it is)   Ever wonder why NFL Officials do not Call certain Plays. Or miss calling other penalties? (Because they play their part.) Meanwhile, some teams win, and others Lose.   The "Foolish" penalties that some players Get, are intentional. They coincidentally give the other team more chances to make the outcome of the game possible.  Meanwhile, the unaware Fans, keep paying The NFL, The Owners, the players  Billions of Dollars to keep getting "Hoodwinked."   How did the Roman Empire keep "Their Citizens" Entertained? They Entertained them in Coliseums. Same thing, only here, they don't get killed.   It's All Rigged Folks. The NFL is a Rigged  Business. And The head of The Beast is... Las Vegas.   The House never Loses.  This year it's meant be... The Chiefs and Packers in the Super Bowl.  The Chiefs will win it.   Because, that is what Vegas want.   Time to... Expand your Thinking
Skip is sick 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Fact is its bad coaching...and even more horrible QB,running back and penalties💯
Put a Tier1 QB on SF vs Dallas Sunday. SF 52 Dall 13
drinking more water ever since this mountain dew bit started
How about them Cowboys.!! 😂 😂 skip making excuses bayless.  Don’t put this loss on that official.!! Even jerry didn’t. Skip is acting like one last play could have won the game. He is so delusional how many times have a team won a NFL game with a walk off TD not many so 🛑 it .
Dak is Trash 🗑....  DeShaun Watson should be on guys board Moving forward!!!!! DAK IS A CHOCK ARTS 🎨 😳 😂 🤣!!!!!!
Dak and Mike are afraid of anything 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Shannon was way too cut throat 🤣
I wonder how much they pay skippy to be such a whiny cry baby
"America's Team." LOLHAHA
Jenny Jenny Jenny… Hol Up Jenny Jenny 😂😂😂
OH Skip dont runaway from your beloved Cowboys man haha ha
SF 23 Dall 7  late 3rdQtr. SF WON/CONTROLLED this gm fr start-finsh. In Dallas!
Don't blame the refs. The Cowboys should have never been in a position to be relying on a QB draw to keep hope alive with 14 seconds on the clock.
My God these Cowboys fans and their beef with the refs not letting them spot their own ball. Just unbelievable.
Skip sat there and took it lmao salute
Don't let Dan Quinn off the hook
Them lebron and russ takes are bad tho still
I wonder if Skip is also sending Dak's family some death threats.... Cowboy fans are disgusting and Skip is their fearless leader
You Ik what it’s ok Skip like I Ik how you feel yo 💯 not a cowboys fan tho
Honestly all that passion from skip gained my respect
Oh, Skip....blaming the officials after all of those defensive penalties that kep 49er drives alive and Offensive penalties that killed Cowboy drives.
It’s great to see Skip accept defeat. Not everyday you get to see Skip like this so enjoy it. 😆😂🤣
1 2 3 hefty bags lol
25:38 Jenny not realizing she really isn't part of the show and only there to fulfill a quota as to not offend female viewers lol. You can tell by how no one really pays attention to her lol
Skip blaming the refs...shocking...he acts if they had an extra second they were going to win the game easily...they lost the game in the first half.
That cowboys game explains why Aaron Rodgers only got one ring
I think I speak for everybody that is on YouTube by saying that we AALLLL have been waiting for this since yesterday 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Skip Bayless looks so defeated. I love when Unc drives him like that...hilarious!
I'm a cowboys fan an it's just funny seeing us lose 🤣
Can’t forget randy Gregory trying out for the WWE in the 4thQ
The Cowboys will win the Super Bowl this year.
I’ve been waiting for this episode 😆
How about them Cowboys!!!!!!!!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Jesus stepped in 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆🙏🏽🙏🏽
The Cowboys are who we thought they were!  Not better than the 49'ers.
Unc was in the studio extra early prepping for this Cowboy cooking lmaoo get em Unc 😂 🤣
As much as I hate cowboys, there is nothing that I hate more than Skip Bayless. So putting those two together... Let's just say yesterday was a good day.
Dal isn't that good! Middle of the pack at best
Cowboy lose the game  first quarter
Skip looks like a petulant child bouncing up and down. 49ers own him forever. So stupid blaming that ref that wanted to do his job and spot the ball correctly but realized that the cowboys wouldn't be able to adjust and get the ball spiked in time. So he moved it back to the spot so that Dallas could hike the ball. That ref was literally cheating for Dallas. And Dallas is mad at him? That's an astounding level of arrogance.
Skip's ego is holding him afloat.  Lol  He's dying inside.
Dak made Romo look good
The cowboys are in the worst division in football. 6 0 against those teams made them look better than they were
Look here he comes who Deebo! Man he always bullies people like he did the Cowboys!Deebo said this my field punk!!
Lmao Shannon is a Super Gremlin now lmao
How bout them cowboys!!! hahahahahahahahaha this makes me so happy
the draw was good... just run out of bounds or stop sooner to give time for a spike! dak ended the game and hopes of a playoff run not the coach
Skip acts like the ref lost the game, wasn't for field goal range, you guys would have false started and ended the game anyway.
Totally Dak’s fault for not knowing the rule and giving the ball to the ref. If he does they probably get one more play.
Dallas girl cowboy lost was wonderful.The truth came out about Dallas Cowboys.Only steer and. Little cry baby in Dallas.
The lady in the thumbnail🤣🤣
Shannon Sharpe the Coaches were responsible for the lost and the play calling was atrocious.
Most Cowboys loss I've ever seen. I was actually impressed on how idiotic that was and was looking forward to this segment. It did not disappoint.
Mahomes improves to (7-2) in Playoffs. Prescott drops to (1-3) in Playoffs. (At almost 30yrs old! )
All of them penalties
Dak Prescott made an Aaron Rogers type of play at the end. This is what separates Tom Brady from EVERYONE else. When all the chips are on the line  and you can't afford a single mistake, Tom Brady makes the perfect play at the perfect time. No one else does it.
Jenny looking good fr
As a Cowboys fan and I love this show Skip and Shannon are the best.  Conor Williams is the absolute worst.  Zeek is done and Dak is as Shannon would say, “ empty calories.”  This team needs a new head coach and an offensive coordinator.  I hope Connor William is bagging groceries next season.
the Cowboys fan reaction reminded me when crooked Hillary lost the 2016 election ,epic and very very funny
How about them cowboys 🤣🤣🤣
I want Jenny to stay!!!
I’m a huge cowboys fan but Shannon has me rolling with his reactions 😂
Love you skip and Shannon good work how about them cowboys Lmfao lol skip the best clip ever awesomeness
The same things Skip is currently killing Dak for, are the SAME things he defiantly praised Tebow for 🤔
I’m a cowboys fan and I could see this coming. The 49ers will get wiped off the face of the earth in the next round. Dallas crushes bad teams and can’t get out their own way against good teams. The coaches and players need to be held accountable for not preaching discipline which caused the penalties.
Dak and the Cowboys center spotted the ball over a full yard further than where the side judge marked Dak down. the official should have made the entire offence back up and then reset the ball. The cowboy were lined up offsides when they snapped the ball. So even if they had gotten the snap off intime it should of been a penalty and a ten second run off, game over.
Man it's too bad that Shannon and skip had to be apart for this one. The in studio reactions and antics would have been much more amazing. I guess it's either because of covid or something else.
All football analyst on ESPN and even Romo knew and said live.. that you have to hand the ball to the ref. You don't get to spot your own ball. And he knocked over Dak trying to get the ball. If he ran around the O-line time would have expired before he got to the ball.
The cowboys need to clean the front office that starts with Jerry Jones they need a fresh start there
I told y'all to I said they was gone loose the first round 😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆💀
..BULL JIVE ! (:
Where is Dallas ( We are not going to lose)  attitude??? If they had the mentality they did when they beat the Patriots they would've won that game.
Bayless coming illogically unglued is hilarious.  The official is going to be 10 to 15 yards behind the QB at the snap, because of 1.) field of vision and 2.) in anticipation of the QB dropping back into the pocket.  If the pocket collapses, the scrambling could go back 15 yards from the line of scrimmage.  I don't see what they benefited from running Dak vs having that as a pass play running a route through the middle of the field.  A quick slant and YAC would easily have gotten the same 17 yards or more.  The Niners completely gave up the middle because they wanted the Cowboys to take the bait and be tackled inbounds.
Apparently, they not better than the 49ers.  How about that...
Cee Dee played more like VHS
Yes, you were wrong Skip but I fully expect next year you will saying "This is the year the Cowboys will win the Super Bowl!" and bet 20 cases.
Been waiting for this one
Heyyyt skip??? Where is the #12 bucs jersey??? 🤣🤣
Was waiting all night to watch this :D
Skip is horrible.. has no true football analytics. Just a biased fanboy. Bandwagon Bucs fan now Dallas lost
Best block of the game- keeping the umpire from getting to the ball.
As a long time cowboy fan I was calling for Rush at the start of the 3rd
I thought Skiiuuup would pop a vein in this segment.
Cowboys always start slow, its eating them
Skip🤡
Is Dak worth the $
I couldn’t care less about the cowboys team as a whole.. but the noisy cowboys fans, Jerry jones and the clown zeke taking that L is just hilarious
We had a loaded pistol for a roster and didn’t know how to fire the gun and wound up shooting ourselves in the foot.
"BUMS"! LMAO!
I used to look forward to see who wins the Super Bowl. Now I just look forward to cowboys fans crying every year.
Leave it to skip to blame a ref for the loss…😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤡
Only the mentally ill rejoice on other people's suffering!!!
Sorry Skip. The Niners are the better team.
SHARPE AND SKIP😭😭😭
Shannon & Skip🔥💪😍
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DR MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.    MAJOR RESPECT!!
Can anybody out there tell me Blake Jarwin did not play yesterday - I didn't see him on an injury report, could have used him in some blacking schemes no?  Zeke 31 yards.....?
Shannon! Damn! This is rough to watch man. Shannon speaks nothing but the truth and it hurts! He has to tell it like it is.
How bout them cowboys 🤣🤣🤣 where all those fans at that were talking earlier this season , bet against them in the playoffs easiest money I ever made
The video I came here for to see skips excuses lmao
skip looks like he's about to have seizures 😂
I love it when those bum Cowboys lose 😂😆🤣😆
I just love how skip is trying so hard to defend his boys uhuhumm, i mean his girls. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 sit yo a$$'s down in yall living rooms like the rest of us.👋
😂😂😂Love it.💕
'Thumbs up' at 49, seconds in, ...
We lost to ourselves! We beat ourselves! Too many penalties.
I slept like a baby!
I wouldn’t be surprised if some of these players like Randy Gregory put their own money down in Vegas against themselves to lose and purposefully botched the game, they have their friends put these bets down on them, heavy money. They can guarantee a loss in botching place versus guaranteeing a win because some of those penalties looked too ridiculous and purposely committed at horrible timing and great timing for the opposing team.
Jimmy G made it to a SB.  Dak will never.
he would have to run to the play 2 seconds sooner, thats actually asking alot of a guy, thats asking too much of a ref.  No excuses
🎿 skip still has tears 😭 in his eyes 👀 from crying sad tears last night 😭 from cowgirls loss
Shannon said it all season long: "the cowboys will do Cowboy things" and god damn he was so right. Go Niners!!!
Why they not in the studio???????????
UNDERPERFORMED...UNPREPARED... TRICK PLAYS....???WHY? LAST CALL OF THE GAME...WHAT? THEY WERE MOVING THE BALL...DAK? GET OUT OF THE POCKET...COMPOSURE DUDE..their ..my ranting has ended..wait..Rebubtle...Skip..the call was wrong...18 seconds ..one more sideline play was needed...
This SUCKS! I don't care about the freaking Cowboys and it's funny to see the fans react to this. But at the same time I HATE the stupid annoying 49ers. I hate the 49ers so I can't even feel good about the Cowboys losing.
I seen sniff twitter he was lacing into them
What happens if they spiked it anyway ? Does time come off the clock as a penalty. Or does the clock stop and they get a 10 yard penalty ?
I love it. The fundamentals won. Cowboys played sloppy, period. Don’t even act like it was one sided. The refs called it what it was!!!! A hold is a hold, offsides is offsides ssskkkiiipp.
Bring the yak n da milds 😂🤣😂😂😂
How could the Cowboys lose?? They were the best team on 3rd down??
So what if Skip wants to brag about his Cowboys. He's a loyal fan not a bandwagon fan like some people.
Skip's reaction and ScooterMagruder are my most anticipated video drops after that debacle of a performance. 😆😂😆
Aye the refs gave them a extra 8 sec at the 1min mark so the game should have been over anyway... And that remeasure off the debow Samuel game ending first down was SUS ANYWAY SO THEY WERE EVEN LUCKY TO GET THE BALL BACK .. THANKS 49ERS YOU MADE MY WEEKEND 👍
They was celebrating they Super Bowl last week against Philadelphia and the media went crazy like that was the ultimate test of strength
Wtf Shannon know about being a super gremlin😂😂😂 uncle shay shay a fool
Brian Flores would be an excellent choice if they🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥Mike😁 Probably not the GM "Jerry"💯
The Cowboys need leadership and the wake up call they got yesterday was believeable after seeing this for nearly two decades now
This cowboy fans think they win the game if they spike the ball 😂 you guys are crazy you still need a miracle Hail Mary to win the game lol
Knew he was gonna blame the refs
skip just got owned today
Don’t blame the refs. If you don’t put yourself in that situation you don’t need to depend on the ref getting to the ball in time.
Respect bayless, but you honestly can't blame the refs, for those mistakes.. cause 14 is hard too disagree with. Always great show.
If Taft dyed her hair black she'd look like Neve Campbell. Go see Scream if you haven't. It's really good.
They were nowhere near having 4 seconds left if everything went well
It was a lack of effort by the players that caused them to be so far behind. Especially Zeke. He hasn’t done 💩 since he got that big contract. It’s not coach McCarthy’s fault that the players don’t want to work for it.
Dak blaming everyone else but himself! His stupidity led to time running out.
Shannon landing haymaker after haymaker on skips feelings.
If Brady had taken his and Gronks talents to Dallas instead of TB, Dallas would have won a SB last year and would be favorites to win this year.  Dak is the weakest link.
You know what's funny? Dak and jalen hurts had the same stats with a difference of 1 interception.   Both of em need to go haha
Hahahahaha died laughing... Shannon started it in hilarious way.
How many cases of Mountain Dew does Skip owe Shannon?
Aside from the first drive, I didn't think the defense played all that bad. The only other touchdown they scored was on a 25 yard field due to a pick. Defense was okay.
I'm not going to knock on Dak u can clearly see there is levels to Coaching. MMs offense is boring af
Time management once kills the cowboy
Came down to football IQ. Cant leave it to chance to depend on an official to sprint and set the ball. Should not have gotten greedy for fifteen yards. Should have ran for ten, slid, and wait for the official to come. Make sure you have a clear path too for the official. These are things the QB should’ve reminded his team.
Skip’s an entertainer and NOT an analyst.
Skip, Skip, Skip - it starts with the 49’ers are better than the Cowboys.  They were in the SB just recently, and injuries hit them hard the year after and hit them again this year.  But don’t be confused, the Niners are stacked when healthy.
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
These guys got GREAT chemistry!!
It's not the referee's problem if your team it's running out of time
Interesting how Shannon Sharpe talks this way about the cowboys yet hates hearing the truth about his stat daddy L.br0n 🤷
I am a Buccaneers fan, but I thought that was the saddest loss I have witnessed yet (Cowboys vs 49ers).
Of course Skip gotta blame the ref for the cowboys loss 😂. SKIPPPP, IF THE COWBOYS WERE GOOD THEY WOULDN’T HAVE NEEDED A LAST SECOND HAIL MARYYY 😂😂
I hope Skip don’t have a heart attack
Every year skip bayless pays for the cowboys sins. Like Jesus of Nazareth he takes his lashings from Shannon for an ungrateful franchise. May we commend him for his sacrifice to the godless heathens of Dallas
This is what I was most looking forward to this morning.
Listening to Skip whining is the highlight of my day !!!!
Skip..how you doing  ?
I love skip, so is it bad that I always want the cowboys to lose just so I can hear skip have a meltdown. Poor skip,I love you skip!!!
Does constantly talking about 2 losing teams equate to good ratings? Do the Cowboys and the Lakers have more fans than any other teams? Do winning teams play in empty stadiums or to sell out crowds? Does 2 losing teams sell more merch than the winners? Please make this make sense.
I can't stand Shannon but i just had to see him dunk on skip after this😂😂🤣🤣
Skip always blaming everybody, especially the coaches. He needs to put the blame on the main operator, JERRY JONES, he needs to be one thing not three the OWNER, GM AND THE COACH pick one JERRY
Dallas one and done boys😂😂🤣
Funniest episode in a minute 😭😂
STOP IT....DALLAS HAD 15 PENALTYS OR MORE.... THEY PLAYED HORRIBLE THEN BLAMING THE REF... LOL YALL LAYED AN EGG IN THE PLAYOFFS SIMPLE
Why don’t you coach them Skip?
Who came here for the thumbnail?
75 million paid to that QB? Jesus
When skip talks about the cowboys he goes full blown gangsta! Skip dont F around! Straight up G!
0:16 Jenny questioning her life choices lol
And no I.m Not A Dallas Fan Go Steelers just stating fact do.nt make Dak The Scapegoat
My goodness, bless these two 😆😆😆
Watch how many cowboys fan blame them refs and not their own team for being terrible the other 3 quarters of the game. Prescott has NEVER been worth the 75 mil they pay him
Okay, so here's an objective opinion as someone not shaming either team or a horse in this race. In the end, it came down to coaching. I get that Dak made mistakes, but the whole team did. They were undisciplined and shot themselves in the foot. This is why they had an egregious amount of penalties. Yet if you look at the score, they lost by six. I think the talent is certainly there and Dallas honestly is the better team. But their coaching was God-awful, and in the end, it cost them.  Mike M. has won a SB. But he did it over ten years ago as a sixth seed. That's impressive, but I'm starting to wonder if that was way more Rodgers than he. Since then, he's done pretty much nothing.
Shannon probably got less sleep than Skip waiting for this one 😅🗣
A producer job on Undisputed must be the best job ever getting a front row seat to this 🤣
Skip blames the umpire. That's what a delusional unintelligent clown would do and is what Skip is. The ref was not late to spot the ball. Watch the replay: he is trying to get to the ball and must get through the line to do that. But Dak should have given him the ball not to the center. Any intelligent quarterback, even high schooler, knows that. But , of course, Dak is not that intelligent. Poor guy.
Skip and his brother are homosexuals. Nothing wrong with that.
The true winners are America
Dak and Zeke era over.
The funniest scene was that Chola girl cowboy fan who was crying and her makeup was running down her face and she was holding on to her cholo boyfriend and his face was stunned in disbelief LOL
Can't do tom landry wrong and get by... ownership folks.... it's awful.... wake up...
Didn’t think Skip would show up this morning 😂😂😅🤣😅
Uncle Shannon hit em with the Dennis Green quote. I'm over here crying 😂😂😂.
Skip a 🤡 blaming the ref. The spot was wrong and the ref should have moved them back 3 yards and that would have taken up the time anyways
Its alot of what Dallas didnt do and not enough of what San Fran did defensively smh
The cowboys were so bad that Jimmy G. Is the reason they even had a chance
Audio quality has been so awful out of studio rn
Skip...dont worry...we are so used to you being wrong...its kinda your thing...
You know Unc could not sleep last night because he's been wanting this chance to drag Skip.
He should have gave the sideline ref a headsup!
From the embarrassing penalties racked up all game to the senseless last play call by the offense, start to finish a pathetic loss by Dallas. San Fran didn't even play that well, Dallas had many attempts to take the lead but got in their own way.  And how sweet it is!
The only reason the Cowboys even had a good regular season record was because they're in the most pathetic division in the league
Wasn't the Ref's fault trailing the play. This was all on Dak, he is the QB and had the ball in his HANDS!!! You make that run, slide, get up and find the ref and hand him the ball.
Cowboys will learn and come back and win the 2023 championship!!
The Cowboys played trash teams except for the Cardinals last month. They weren't ready for the Niners.
Do.nt blame Dak for all the penalties and not having time  to looked down field and the defense played poorly he kept them in the game It.s A Team Thing
The empty drum makes the most noise.
You can't forget Cowboys had the ball with 6 minutes 3 time outs and they choke
I'm a bengals fan and I really can't say much. Jerry Jones ruined yall team, like Mike Brown does ours.
Some of those Cowboy fans have become social media sensations. 😂😂😂
no cool jazz turtleneck and chain today?!?!?!
Cancun on 3 😂
Honestly the overthrow to aiyuk made me more sick than the interception. I cannot wait until Jimmy G leaves this franchise.
SKIP IS READY TO THROW HANDS WITH SHANNON LMAOOOO  I mean, dumb idea, but I respect the love for his team.
NINERS RUN THE NFL COWBOYS ARE JUST A WARM UP
How bout them 9ers!
Lol all the excuses 😜 they didn't show up they lost 🙄 that it
So Skip was definitely wrong or...?
Such a good monday for sports.
God these are the undisputed episodes I wait for 🥰🥰
Skip acting like 10 year old me after the 2016 nba finals
Get Real Skip Bayless . . .the 49ers dominated the game and overpowered the Cowboys.  The 49ers were the better team. The only way the game became close was because of Jimmy G's typical 1 to 2 interceptions per game.  The Cowboys couldn't even win it with the 49ers giving them so many gifts.  Dallas has a lot of talent but they are young and undisciplined with bad coaching.  All those penalties proves my point.
"He's really good in the 4th quarter." Well sir, how bout being really good in the 1st,2nd, and 3rd quarters. He gets all those 4th quarter yards is because he throwing against cookie dough coverage at that point.
Niners outplayed, out-coached and were more disciplined than the Cowboys and were the better team on Sunday.  Don't blame the officials for doing their jobs. The Niners beat the Cowboys on both sides of the ball and earned the victory.  Sorry Skip - Dallas ain't that good!
Nananana I got you 😆 🤣 😂
Late to the play!? Skip it's the risk you take running a ball with no timeouts and 18 seconds left!!! Your at the refs mercy, if he's "Late" it's on you! Come on Man!
I lol’d when he said his team deserved one last shot. For what, an umpire trying to do his job. C’mon now!! Skip!!
*"hOw BoUt DeM cOwBoYs!?"*  - Skip Brainless
Too much praise for your team that you curse them - the curse comes from God. Praise The ONE who made those players, or if you are praising them attribute it to God. Say thank God Micah Parsons is a great player.
Game was not that surprising. -49ers committed to the run game, Jimmy G made some plays off of play action -The cowboy defense, like it has been all year, held its own against a talented well coached team for as long as they could -Dallas's high powered offense was really overrated, the O-line especially is the most overrated unit in the league, they led the way with all of the penalties because they would get beat so often. - Dak once again was below average throwing the football even when he did have time. - Wide receivers got shut down by what I thought was a vulnerable secondary - McCarthy and Moore suck, why people think Kellen Moore is a good OC or potential HC is beyond me, he calls the same vanilla plays that Garret did. The only difference is that he tells our team to try these embarrassing laterals. Good Game 49ers, you deserved this one, and any Cowboys fan that wants to blame the refs, this team was never going to do anything and deep down we knew it. Don't blame the refs because our offense are a bunch of frontrunners that only play well against the dregs of the NFL.
Dak needed to slide earlier and give the ball directly to the ump instead of trying to spot it himself and get lined up. The ball cannot be snapped until the ump touches it and the cowboys lined up in a way that made it difficult for the ump to get through and touch the ball. If Dak was smart he would've run straight to the ump and handed him the ball directly. That's what it means to play smart. Larry Fitzgerald was known for doing this because he knew the way the game worked. If Dak was a little smarter about it, they would've absolutely had another snap. Sad way for it to end but they deserved to lose with how they played
Bums lol.
Any playoff L hurts, but if u a real Boys fan this wasn't surprising... We lost key games in the regular season nuff said
Shannon hates all black Quarterbacks. Yeah he says somethings about others but few and in between he gives black Quarterbacks credit. Man Elway just wowed you.
As a Bears fan, I can appreciate the Denny Green reference.
I hope this 25 minutes of yelling makes these two guys feel better.
UNC loving this 😂
Sometimes I feel like the only rational Cowboys fan out there, this result could be seen a Mike, or mile, away. The playoffs bring out who you are in exponential ways. The signs were clearly evident all season.
Colin on his podcast said: Dak is Cousins without the haters. 💯
I literally couldn’t wait to wake up this morning to see uncle Shay Shay 😂 😂 I knew he was gon be on 10
I'm just here to do a poll, any feed back would be greatly appreciated.  Here's the question  Are the cowboys still dem Boyz
Skip is going to give the same intro that Shannon gave when the Lakers either miss the playoffs as a whole or get knocked out in the Play-In. They're both delusional super fans
Skip still can’t get over the fact that the Umpire has to spot(not just touch like what he was saying) the ball. Even good ole Romo knew the rules.
the umpire did chase the play in the green bay game that helped the Packers get a game winning field goal....
Steven A and Shannon should of had their own power hour.😆😆😆
LOL!!!! LMBO!!!! GET HIM, SHANNON!!!!
Damn too many top tier quotes from Shannon on this one.
The Cowboys and playoffs are like oil and water.
As a Cowboys fan I'm never surprised by the outcome of this game. We fold when we play elite teams. We lost this game simply by penalties, nothing more nothing less.
Dumb QB does dumb thing.
Skip actually blaming the ref because the ref spots the ball before every play on every other play of the game and not the Center lmaooooo. Just say the QB Draw is the DUMBEST PLAY CALL IN NFL PLAYOFF HISTORY!!!!!
that the last Super Bowl they won was with Jimmy Johnson's assistant coaches and his players that Jimmy had coached before being fired the previous year.  It has been at least a decade since any media have referred to them as "America's team.  Jimmy was also only the second coach in team history to win Super Bowls.  I don't know how many head coaches they have had since, but they haven't made it out of Wild Card weekend since!  The last time Dallas won a Super Bowl was 1995; that's over 2 decades ago!
Ive seen this same pattern with other fanbases and other sports anywhere around the world. Its always the same sequence of events where the fanbase looks for straws, any positive threads to grab and hold on to during the regular season which even feeds its way down to the organization and players on the team itself. And it always ends in hilarity, strong emotions, sad tears and anger near the end of the season of said sport.   Brah you didn’t get unlucky or got cheated. Ya’ll talked yourselves up throughout the weeks and when the time of truth came ya’ll got exposed. Delusional fanbases always are the same. Its like their way to cope that they aren’t actually that good anymore. Rather believing in a lie and get crushed for a week at the end than accept reality and find inner peace. Sad.
THIS IS THE YEAR THIS IS THE YEAR🤣🤣🤣HOW BOUT THEM COW GIRLS.🤣🤣🤣
Jimmy G did all he could to help Dallas.
Just a pathetic first 3 quarters like wow Cowboys I'm a die hard fan and I'm ashamed with the game I feel fans might leave Dallas
I prefer Shannon as a Super Gremlin than Antonio Brown as such!
Cowboys and Lakers they both getting tortured 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It’s not a coincidence their season ended with clock mismanagement. This is why you don’t hire coaches at a sleepover.
NO skip , the cryboys are not better then the niners  score board
Skip so hurt and Shannon pouring it on 😆🤣😂
This would have been better if they were in the studio
Where are all the sorry cowboy fans at lol
Even had the Cowboys scored a Hail-Mary TD on the last play, it would've just been called back by another penalty. I think that was probably Zeke Elliot's last game with the Cowboys as well.
Skip ... calm down bro... u bout to meet ur maker if u keep it up
My dad is older than the ref and he can book it with no issue. That ref is in better shape than my dad.
Shannon showed no mercy
skip going out sad skip don't know what to say.... i love it its like christmas all over again
Why are they not in studio?
I wish Jenny would just come in like the ref and say "segment is over".
Dak’s attitude this season is concerning. Now that he’s gotten paid his ego is way inflated. He had the nerve to take a shot at the refs after that performance? Show some accountability
The NFL VS. Covid19 : Die for the Lombardi
*Unc Shay just said he’s a super gremlin?*  *LOVE* THIS SHOW 😂
I only caught parts of today's Skip and Shannon Undisputed Show today. At any point did the 2 1 / 2 hour show cover any NFL playoff games not involving the Cowboys and Niners ?
Cowboys didnot have 3- 4 seconds
What can go wrong, Will go wrong!- SAS
EXCUSES EXCUSES SKIP! This dude is laughable. Makes me sick!! Get him off tv! 49ers were CLEARLY the better team and would beat these cowgirls 10 out of 10 times!!!
skip such a sore loser 🤣
Trevon Diggs is the most overrated player ever. He got 11 INTs cause he got targeted all game and when that happens, you're bound to have a bad ball thrown your way. But that guy was constantly getting beat, i couldn't believe it!!!!   That 1st round pick has to be a CB. It has to be.
the refs and human error.  like the bengals/raiders game that this show acts like was not played saturday?  big surprise as you just ignore everything raiders
Shannon needs to turn his volume down
Skip Still needed to add many more 'wrongs':)  Shannon is Top Notch.
Cowboys fan here. I'm not shocked this happened. It's been happening year after year. I just hold my breathe and say we will see what happens.
All the cowboys did this year was feast on bad teams I don't even think they beat a good team
Skip...hurting hurting
Skip Bayless❗ u should be ashamed of yourself, blaming the empire❗ for your OVER RATED Cowboys losing
She 🔥
Lolll at skip, that ref also works for chase..? I can only imagine him getting responses in the Dallas-Fort area
As a die hard Washington FAN....ive checked out weeks ago but this is the only W that matters now 😂. Good season cowboys fans real talk 👍
Typical cowboys fans, blaming everyone but their garbage team.
Wish Shannon wasn’t laughing needs to be serious. Skip gotta stop doing this
This man can accept the fact that he could not humble himself in defeat I'm surprised he that he did not blame LeBron in this this team was 160 against the NFC east and six and six against everybody else
Man undisputed is just as overrated as the Cowboys it’s lowkey became the 4th best show on fox
Nobody: Shannon: “The Cowboys are exactly who I thought they was some overachieving 🤔… some underperforming Bums”🤣🤣🤣😂😂
How does a carousel go? 🤷🏾‍♂️
Looks like, Skip, aged 15 years since friday.
why aren’t they in the studio?
lol this is too much
Lol knew the Dallas Cowgirls would lose 😁
Skip bayless
Shannon : Hairs the thang Skip : what hair what thang
even though dallas shouldnt have got the ball back.... if you watch the nfl youtube video of this game where dak takes off running, he did not need to run down the middle of the field... as soon as he breaks through the line a niner defender darts towards him... dak then had the choice run to the left of this defender and out of bounce, or run to the right of the defender down middle of field.... dak chose wrong game over.
Skip has to be the biggest pile of  💩 in existence
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
More disrespect for Jimmy G?? When all he does is WIN. These guys are unbelievable!
I was sad my Patriots lost the way they did but then I remembered the cowboys played the next day and they made me feel better lol 🤣
The rest of the world is not stunned. Only the Cowboys and their delusional fans.
Dak is Wack!!! 75 million dollars please!!! Dak thinks he is better than he really is, somebody needs to tell Dak he just a alright QB
You cant judge how good a NFC least team is until the playoffs. Cowboys didnt have 1 statement win the whole season. They only had 2 chances the cardinals and chiefs where they lost both.
The check bounced LOL
Skip trying to blame the referee for Dak's boneheaded move of handing the ball to his Center lmmfao. They literally play keep-away with the ref, and he did all he could to get to the ball and get it set. That man deserves a bonus
Just like you are wrong (x's infinity) about trash Baker Mayfield, clown. Skip has no objectivity when he likes a player or a team.
This is all I wanted the year was a cowboys playoff loss I'm so happy today thank the NFL gods for giving me what I want
I was thinking about Skip having to eat his words since the 4th quarter yesterday. With a big'ol smile.
" The Check bounced, bounced me right out of the playoffs.  And you said they had to go home....... THEY WERE AT HOME!!! they lost a home playoff game."    Don't know why but that had me rolling 😂
I finally cheered for the Cowboys due to a bet and now I feel their misery. Ouch
Again another let down for my cowboys
23:20 to me, it’s not that the Cowboys penalties weren’t valid, it’s that the 49ers had a lot of penalties that weren’t called on them especially Trent Williams false starting nearly every snap causing Randy Gregory to jump. But the Cowboys didn’t lose to the refs they lost because their oline sucks and Dak needs a good run game and pass protection to win.
Dak trashcott won’t ever be the guy.
I wonder if the Cowboy fans stormed out of the stadium the way they stormed in thinking they were headed to the Superbowl.
LETS GO NINERS ALL FUKN DAY 💯
Take the L like you do every year being a cowboys fan.
Stay Home 🏡  🖥 🛋 🤣....Niners Nation 🦾
We need young and fit refs!!!! @NFL
I’m done with this team, I’m done with the coach, I’m done with the RB who can’t run anymore, I’m tired of the quarterback who talks the talk but can’t lead you to victory. I’m tired of the owner hiring horrible coaches. Not even upgrading to Kellen Moore will fix this. Make Dan Quinn the head coach now!
Dak Prescott won the 🏆NVP (nickelodeon valuable player) after the game 🏈
Main reasons the Cowboys lost They kept shooting themselves in the foot with dumb penalties on both sides of the ball, they didnt try to establish the run, instead they felt to trap of throwing throwing and throwing, also they couldnt get off the field on 3rd down so that allowed the 9ers to control the clock, the clock management and our situational football IQ was horrendous
Play that Teddy pendergrass whole town laughing at me... Silly fool...haha 😆😂😂
Now he blame the ref
Did Skip just say the cowboys are better than the 9ers? Skip shall put the box wine down and sit! FOH skip 😂🤣
cowboys best block was when they blocked the referee from doing his job.
I couldn’t wait until Monday to look at skip face 😂😂
I almost felt sorry for Skip…said absolutely no one. Nah I did feel a little sorry for him. He loves the team and the game. He might be a little less easy going on the Lakers now tho. Up to this week I’d describe his Laker analysis as politely cruel.
Now the next joy of this season is Skip's reaction when Brady doesn't make it to the Superbowl this year.😀
Cowboy fans are too biased and ignorant of football to see both sides of the coin. In the final 15-20 minutes of play, the ref's called San Francisco 2-3 times for penalties which overturned their first down which would have sealed it for the 49'rs. Instead they were forced to punt and give Dallas a shot. 49'ers played defense and took away the sides of the field down the field and Dallas made short throws and that ill advised run by Dak and played right into the 49's plan. Run out the clock. Dallas had more chances than they actually deserved and they could not capitalize.
Does mountain Dew sponsor them?
I hope Mtn. Dew cutting a check
Skip can blame it on the refs all day.  My Steelers lost a game to a similar placement of the football.  We know the rules.  And the referee actually had the correct placement of the ball.  The Center had placed the ball  1 1/2 yards from where Dak started to slide.  And the start of the slide is where the ball goes down.  If the Cowboys had placed the ball in the correct location and gave the Ref room to get there, I could see the argument.  But he did everything right.  It was a chancy play call for a middle of the field run with no time outs.  WHY DO THEY THINK THE 49ERS GAVE UP THAT PLAY?
The Cowboys losing made the Eagles losing feel not as bad. I knew the Eagles weren't gonna go far AT ALL this year, but the Cowboys?! Welp, now Philly will have some company on the couch next week.
Almost feel bad for Cowboys fans.
3:30 Skip look like your 9 year old child waiting for his turn to talk just to tell you he pooped in the car seat.
Why do these guys have to shout? I always have to turn the volume WAAAY down just to try to listen to them. They're grown men, why can't they just talk in a normal voice?
Blame the coach as usual
I'm a lifelong Washington fan. Skip the Cowboy fan, in pain...   pure 😊 bliss. Skip do America a favor, please quit overhyping dem boyz.
I was looking forward to this since last night! skiiiiuups reaction and meltdown is priceless! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣. I'm glad my niners won it. I was worried that cowboys were going to come back in the 4th quarter, they came close but I'm glad they didnt.
Jenny jenny jenny jenny jenny!! lol
Man I wish they were in person for this. 😂😂😂
I don’t even watch this show anymore but I had to watch just to see Skip cry over the Cowboys coming up short again lol 😂
I love Seeing Skip like this all Angry. This Made my Day.
Bold prediction...dak gets traded to the texans for watson and 1st and 3rd pick!
😂😂😂😂😂😆
it’s a shame THIS episode couldn’t have been in the studio
Shannon 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
dallas shouldnt have had the ball back.... the replay clearly showed niners got the first down, it shouldnt have been 4th 1inch. that was a first down.
How bout them Cowboys 🤠
I don't believe what happened.  6 out patterns.  Then let's Charlie Brown an NFL team, running down the middle of the field as Forest Gump.  Great job.  Dax can't spot the ball. jimmy G was exactly who we knew he was.
Poor Skip 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
GOOD TEAMS DONT LET A GAME GET DECIDED BY THE REFS !!! We played like sh*t.
Oh no. I’ve been waiting for this segment today 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
As a life long Cowboy fan I was, of course dissapointed, because of all the penalties. Those penalties were at critical moments. Stupid holding penalties and they kept holding. And of course trying to come back in the fourth qtr. makes no sense. Something has got to change for next year.
Blame the ref?!?...that is weak, that is a cop out, stick to what you said. The Cowboys weren't ready play.
This one time skip 🤔😬😏
Both Dak and Elliott both are over paid!!
Skip needs to STOP saying the cowgirls are better than the 49ers. They're NOT. AND IT'S NOT CLOSE!!!!!!! And they proved it CONVINCINGLY to all yesterday! So what it got close in the end. 49ers were BETTER AT JERRY WORLD!!!! They were too damn physical for the cowgirls! Skip is delusional as always!!
Before this season everyone inthe comments was saying Dak is a top 10 qb😂😂
Skip should double or nothing of 40whiners vs Green Bay.
Skip didn't give him grief when he said chiefs win SB. Just saying
They needed Justin Herbert to convert those 4th down yesterday lol. Go chargers baby
Dak is garbage 🗑 I’m a cowboys fan for 36 years and I knew they where gonna lose why would Dak run into the middle of the field instead of throwing it the same way they where
Unk call them bums🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂💀💀💀
What happened you can't beat the refs.
Why don't you guys show the clips you reference? It is frustrating.
When it comes to the Qb position, he's not Dak good...
Hey Skip,maybe Dak should of used a different setting on his sleep number bed.LMAO  GO 49ERS!
Skip Gon cry in the car 😂🤦‍♂️😔
I really wish they could’ve been in the same studio today for this segment lol
I'm sorry, but as a Titans fan who legitimately hates the Cowboys, I am furious about the official. The officials have too much power in this league and they're not good enough for how much power they have.
How 'bout them cowgirls😥😭💔
Skip went on twitter after the game & whined the refs cheated the Cowboys out of a win
Soon as the game finished i knew Shannon would be saying “they are who We thought they were” lmao
A merry go round goes round and round uncle shay😂😂
Damn that wrong 😂
SOUR GRAPES SKIP , ONCE AGIAN BLAME THE REFEREE. PROVING HOW STUPID HE IS
Get Em Big Unk..... We been having to hear his mouth for the last 8 days let em know
"Now I TOLD you on Friday...I said you gonna come in here on MONDAY and you gonna be CRYIN"
You know what's funny is Dak started sliding at the 27 and they themselves spotted it at the 24 and the ref was just going to spot where they put the ball . What a fiasco
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Kinda ironic that romo was announcing this failed comeback by the cowboys too. 🤠
The Dallas Cryboys 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mike McCarthy is a horrible HC, with him cowboys will not win anything
Good job Shannon. Make Skip cry
Skip is a honorable guy
Shannon Sharpe getting some redemption for those damn Lakers.🤣🤣🤣
49ERS > COWGIRLS. Not even close!!
Wack should’ve gave the ball to the umpire instead of to the center
That 27 qbr for Dak in that game had something to do with the 49ers defense skip! Show some respect!
Man live tv did the cowboys fans dirty during the game lol
Was Skip wrong? I didn't catch that. 🙄
They doing the show virtually again now??? For what reason?
So who has covid?
I was kekekeing the whole time 😂😂😂
maybe now every sports show will now stop talking about them every single week probably not because they need the ratings
The game was crazy but seeing the fans cry was like, wow
Hefty bags on 3, ready break!!  Had me weak!!
GOD I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG TO HEAR THIS SEGMENT! GO NINERS! HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS?!
I thought skip would die in this segment
Just like their owner Jerry, this team is all ego and has no substance.  America's team?  LOL Really?  Is this what America is about? Losing!  They have been eating on championships that happened so long ago the members of that team are almost senior citizens.
Skip: it’s all Mike McCarthy’s fault. Just saying how good was Dak, when Dallas went to Vikings and won with a backup QB.  Trade Dak, bring in Watson.
Skip’s meltdown makes the whole end of the game last night worth it ten thousand times over.
The Cowboys are/were not better than the Cowboys. Skip a prisoner of his own hopes
I wonder if I will ever see the cowboys win a Super Bowl or even go to a Super Bowl in my lifetime 😩🥺
Larry Fitzgerald made a habit of immediately grabbing the ball and sprinting it to the referee in these situations, because he knew the ref has to touch and place the ball before every snap. How every team in the league doesn't practice this is beyond me. Even worse, McCarthy admitted to practicing it, by GETTING THE BALL BACK TO THE CENTER!! Which is WRONG. Unbelievable. I can't imagine what Rodgers had to put up with from this man all those years. This is absurd.
Never have I been so excited to watch undisputed
Bosa/Warner > Parsons/Diggs. Oh and they won without those guys!!
The REFS wanted the cowboys to win after that stupid movement from first down to 4th n "inches"   Then they forgot they didn't get the check from Jerry Jones 🤣  Y so serious 😈🃏🥃
Skip going at the referee is the most Cowboys thing after a playoff loss there is.  Dak needs to know the ref has to spot it, so maybe instead of handing it to your center…find the ref just like we are running backs and wide receivers do in the exact same situation. Secondly…complaining that he tackled your quarterback…should he have politely gone around him and wasted another second? You’re already saying he’s late, what else did you want him to do… The Cowboys lost because they did the most Cowboys thing…choke in a big spot. Simple as that
Unc trippin on calling em bums, this coming from a 49er fan. Speaking of which I hate how this more about the boys losing than SF coming thru. We wasn’t supposed to be here.
As a Saints fan and member of the WhoDat Nation, I dislike the cowboy fans.  They so annoying lol.  Watching them crying, throwing things, fighting each other was just comical.   I enjoyed every bit of it.  👏🏾👏🏾🤣
Poor Skip man. It’s funny but at the same time you can feel the man’s pain lol
The best team that played the cowgirls, 49ers was the best team period
Watching Skip is why Ive had to let sports go!
Yup 5he cowboys are frauds 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So the Raiders, bangles, stealers & chiefs didn’t play this weekend  huh? How y’all come up with multiple topics to talk about cowboys & bucs
The Dallas Cowboys need to be drinking those Mt Dews right before the game.
We let people hype us up to thinking we were better than we actually were. We didn’t prove anything all year. The signs were there. Tampa, Denver, Arizona, Oakland,  Kansas City and now SF. The road to success went through those teams and we couldn’t do it. It’s not about that last play. It’s about our inconsistency with big games and good opponents.
49ers are the better team... PERIOD! That's why I won so much money on this game. Too many idiots who don't know football. How people picked the cowgirls in this game blows my mind! They had a cakewalk into the playoffs in that putrid division. How were the 49ers underdogs? 😂😂 Whoever makes these lines... Thanks for the $$$
SO THE COWBOYS & SKIPPY SUNK TO A NEW LOW BY BLAMING A REFEREE!!!  WT🤬!!!🙌🏽💪🏽🔥💯🏈😎
Every year is “the year” for Cowboys fans. They honestly believe they will win no matter what regardless of how many times they lose.
He must be ashamed to come to work today because he ran is mouth so bad! U hype them up by being hopeful lol bye bye Cowboys
Unk Shannon said it best
Super Gremlin. Unc Yak!
Cry cry
It's all a set up
It's a shame this was a virtual show, it just feels a bit off with the delay in technology and such
Shaes all caps button is broken 😆
Skip is so mad haha. They normally have a fun back and forth, not today haha.
Too bad they couldn't be in the studio together on this one
Skip is still delusional everything is if we would have... But they didn't and I think everyone but Cowboys fans seen this coming. No your Cowboys aren't better than the niners. They weren't robbed and honestly they will never be anything until or unless the Jones family sales the Team.
I was waiting on this 😭
Shannon: no...you were a couple of “wrongs” short skip but its all good
Bring me a chalice with the tears of Skip Bayless!  Btw skip that draw play was trash, hand the ump the ball lol every play ….nah Dak and dem boyz special lol.
This is beyond hilarious
I think it's time to shake up the divisions. It's a shame the NFC East teams got bounced round 1. It happens every year.
Shannon is better at life than Skip. Cowboys are bad at life.
Jenny didn't put the crinkles in her hair. Must have been running late this morning 👀
Skip is old,rich,and f...kin delusional !!!
Bro Skip really took the L today 😭😭😭
It was clear as day that the cowboys r pretenders like always. Now this guy expect to be let off the hook after talking all that garbage before the game. The cowboys r who we thought these were!
Cryboys beat weaker teams 12-5 and even had a hard time beating many of those weaker teams.  I sat back worry free 17 weeks to see that on this reputable game day  They stood against a stronger team got punched in the mouth 1st and couldnt respond in their first 3 possesions with all hands on deck nice and healthy!  49s even lost key players and tried to hand the cowturds the win but cowturdz as usual.. declined 🤣 Cowturds Standards are: just win Superbowl Champions Standards are: Dominate Flawless Victories
God...Satan..   Take skips life in the next 7 months 🙏🤲  Y so serious 😈🃏🥃
🤠 cowboys are my team  I said the same thing shannon  !!
QB sneak with no timeout..... L
This is a travesty! How is Chef Shay allowed to do this show without the apron and cooking hat?!? Unbelievable.
Breakfast of champions, nectar of the gods. Diet Mountain Dew. Just Dew it.
Cowboys fans fast forward to September 2022: no , this is not your year , no this team isn’t different , no you are not them boyz
You’re always wrong skip. They ain’t your team. Your a cheap suit that’s it.
The Cowboys will do cowboys things
My man Shannon, literally bouncing on his seat 😂. Didn’t think he could be louder 😂 😂.    ❤️ this.
Shannon wasn’t going to act a fool on MLK day , days like this he usually brings out the jerseys and the henny, all due respect shay, u are the best on tv and made a smart pick. Happy MLK day
Skip you know better you've been covering the NFL for how many decades now you know the referee is not just supposed to touch the ball he is supposed to spot the ball don't try to make things fit your narrative and make other people look bad it was just your team brother they are just trash for real they got your hopes up just admit the fact hey 49ers was the better team yesterday don't put that on the referee
Drop the Mic Mccarthy is the most hilarious thing skip has came up with 😂
Skip last week didn't know that's the game will be play on the line of scrimage,......and as i wrote last week in my comments the 9ers will win, it's exactly what's happen.  To many penalties 14 .... bcos the guys in front of Them are better.
Skips meltdown has made my week
That’s  lot of wrong
Shannon just a wanna be Stephen A
I’m bouta start drinking diet dew
We blaming the ref skip 🤣🤣 dak should have slid way earlier that was his fault
I’m crying laughing 😂 Shannon said it’s skips fault lol
Penalties *always* matter in the playoffs Skip. Come on man.
When it Raynes it Pours
Skip Ya need to root for another team ! Send the Cowboys  rule books in the off season to nullify all those penalties !
Literally the same thing happened in Dak's first NFL game against the Giants in 2016.
Cowboys will always be trash as long as Prescott is qb. He is not a big time qb makes bad decisions all the time. Nope won't happen with him overpaid overrated
One and done like I said they would be
Jimmy Johnson said if I gotta motivate a professional I get rid of them.
F...ing Cowboy fans.  its always someone else fault.  The ref really.
Even Romolicious was commenting live, ugh oh, what's Dak doing? Give the ball to the ref. Just terrible coaching.
Yesssir this was the reaction I wanted to see 🚬🚬🚬🚬smoking that pack
I think low key that mountain dew skip and Shannon be talking about has to be gambling money
Its not the coach, its Jerry,  Mike McCarthy will be gone next year most likely & nothing will change, nothing ever changes in Dallas.
Like the commentators last night said, Dak should have handed the ball to the official to save time. His mistake, which falls back on his coach for not prepping him.
“he tackles a lot of people bc he’s not very good”nah skip mad fr🤣
Skip just basically put the Addy out for the ref.....
As a lifelong Cowboys fan I was utterly not surprised at all. They came out flat and lifeless on schedule. 7 yards total offense in the 1st quarter!! Gimme a break...
Jason Garrett smiling right now while rubbing his hands
Not going to lie, I would’ve love to had seen Skip and Stephen A go at it over this for old time sake 😂😂😂😂😂.
To be fair the ref should have grabbed the ball and re spotted it behind 5 yards where dak tries to spot it because that's where he initiated the slide. The ref didnt do that to give the cowboys a chance knowing time was scarce and that alone is unacceptable and unfair to the 49ers.
Oh my Shannon Sharpe gave it to Skip Bayless anytime you tell God please open my eyes so you can wake up and give someone the business
Something special they said 🤣
What has Ezekiel Elliott done ever since Jerry World gave him a big contract? Do the Cowboys even keep him? Are they stuck with him?
Skip &  McCarthy needs to quit lying they weren’t on the 50 that ball was around the 40 yard line when they started, and the ref tried his best to help them they were just all confused and bumping into him , and if he would’ve went around the line instead of trying to go between dak  to hurry up and set the ball, it would of been even longer
Damn Shannon! Relax
Everyone else's team can lose and not be in the playoffs but they'll laugh when the cowboys lose. Pretty pathetic if you ask me lmao
You right skip..we always trying to dig out of a hole 🕳
Not a fan of how Skip was calling out the ref by name, it’ll no doubt contribute to all the hate being shoved at the poor guy. Cowboys should have just played better from the start rather than blame some external factor which is going to ruin the refs life.
"SKIUUUUUP! SKIUUUUUP! SKIUUUUUUUP!"
The most beautiful time of year
The ref was at the correct distance in case he has to call a penalty on either team b4 the  previous play was over...then run over and place the 🏉
The reason the cowboys lost, it was the 49ers. Score board
😂bruh how is skip gonna blame the ref? Why don’t your players turn around and give him the ball???? They sit there and spot it themselves and try to run a play like they don’t know what the rules are.
Cowboys STINKY POOP
Cowboys in all y'all heads rent free. I see way more non Cowboy fans here talking spicy 💀 if it was your team you wouldn't be on this segment. Stop dickriding 🤣🤣
Better coach WON poor cowgirls they need a better dance move
I thought they get 10 cases yesterday 🧐
Fire McCarthy
Skip cried all night and all morning 😂😂 and I like that lol jab Shay Sharpe threw at Michael Irving at the beginning 🤣
The Cowboys Fired Jason Garrett for the team being undisciplined, not able to score and win the big game etc to then hire a guy that’s the exact same smh Ownership is to blame also. Hire the right person!
THE WAR IS OVER  ??? OR HAS IT JUST BAGAN ?? 🤔🤔🤔🤣🤣🤣🎥🎥🎥😳😳😳🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠
Skip bring up the personal life of the ref is just sad. Watching a guy go through the 7 stages of grief on this clip.
Shannon came in ready to go lol
"any other qb and they beat y'all by 30" is the most accurate statement I have heard regarding the 49ers
GAME PICKS WHO WINS GREEN BAY PACKERS OR 49ERS?
I told my fellow fans that dak wasnt worth that big of acontract when he signed. I told them during the season that dak was gonna bite us just like in the game....but cant blame him too much because of the penalties but just looking at how dak played didnt perform like a top 5 qb despite the fact that he is getting paid like a top 3 qb. At least the brother got his money right?
Not gonna lie I've been waiting waiting for this since yesterday
Jerry needs to hire Flores
The spike play by the Cowboys at the end of the game would have been even more disastrous, hilarious and embarrassing if the center spoting the ball himself and trying to steal an extra yard actually snapped the ball without the ref respoting it.
The cowboys bout to give skip a heart attack 🤣 chill man
I wanted Skip to cry smh
Cheers 🥂 26 years  God n the devil wanted the San Francisco 49ers ...   Y so serious 😈🃏🥃
This game shouldn't had even been that close. Jimmy G tried to help the cowboys win but they couldn't take advantage. Jimmy G ain't the answer for SF. I see why they drafted Trey Lance.
Jimmy G has more playoff wins than the entire Cowboys franchise since 20 years
I hate to say I told you so niners was going to win hey skip what’s your excuses now
Cowboys need to improve their o-line in the next draft. There were too many holding penalties. The key to a great offense is a strong line to protect the quarterback. Next year will be Mike’s last year if they don’t advance in the playoffs.
Cowboys fans always have excuses when they lose. Go NINERS!!!
Man! Why didn’t Shannon do the ‘HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!!’
The Refs told Dak to run the ball....... there it is for the conspiracy theorist on YouTube who will say that's why they lost. Go 49ers
The last play should have been spotted o at the 25 yard not 24
C plus offensive came to play....
Jimmy G gaged 😂😂😂😂😂
Uncle Shannon owes skip 37 cases since 2016 I’m so dead ☠️ 🤣🤣🤣
HOW ABOUT THEM COWGIRLS!!!!!!
Cowboys did what we all knew what they’d do… Choke and lose lmao
hes so mad i love it
I've been a cowboy fan since 96 and that lost did hurt but when skip said they where at home at the 18:52 I laughed until I was in tears
That randy Gregory holding call was the dumbest fuckn hold in the history it’s 3rd down they have to punt in your mind should be thinking make simple play get the ball back
Sharpe buy  some  vowels
Fred Warner and co scared that Oline into 2 consecutive false starts Skip. That's how. Excuses. Luck = when preparation meets opportunity. The Niners were better prepared than the Cowboys. Except for Jimmy's ability to go airhead at key moments.  You're not entitled to anything in life Skip.  You're team wasn't the only one with garbage to deal with. We just overcame ours.  Go Niners!
Did anyone else see that the clock went from 38 seconds to 40 seconds after Jimmy G got the false start penalty?
Quit it with the umpire. The Cowboys spotted the ball themselves. That is 100% their fault. STOP blaming the officials. Get a clue. Even on that play one of their WRs was massively offsides, even with the false spot.
If I where the cowboys I would shore the Oc from the patriots ASAP! I know it didn’t work out totally at the broncos but dude would have that Team disciplined! And that offense would flourish
5:28 lol
The cowboys blame everybody else except they self 😂😂😂😂😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡💯🤡🤣 of 4 quarter Hall of Fame you have a good Skip Bayless 💯🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡
Shannon “Remember I told you” Sharpe
Irvin was worried lol he knew this would be a close game
Just put 8:20-8:28 on repeat
Skip makes me not like the Cowboys, he one of "those fans."
That's what I waited for since last night, Shannon turning into the Cheshire-Cat.😁🤣
Nothing against the Dallas cowboys players but I can't stand Jerry Jones.  Just seeing him lose does my heart well.
Who else thinks those “cases” are really thousands of dollars in cash 💰
this was worth every moment!
LOL Skip.
When it matters most, Dallas chokes!
Steven A said it best....these cowboys walk around like they played on those champion teams and the old heads pump them up
Love these two, classic
Mccarthys gone
mad over 1 second lmao
Skip is in rare form.....what can go wrong, will go wrong lol 😂
Coach has to go . Make kellen more HC . I don’t wanna hear anything about Dak.. Yeah he threw a pick and didn’t play up to par but overall he had a great season. 4400 yards 37 touchdowns and 10 picks… (3.7 to 10)TD to TO ratio. I think we need to address the offensive line in the draft and let willams go he super trash. I wouldn’t resign Randy Gregory cause of his blunders.. LVE must go and I wouldn’t bring back Gallup. Fix the offensive line and defensive line that’s who let you down in the game.. sign a couple of free agents. That’s all I have to say. Absolutely one of the worst games I’ve seen as a fan and to top it all off, Captain Choke was calling the game.
I won't jump off the bridge for this  but who can understand  what  Shannon Sharpe is saying cowboys will clean house and bring in dogs and draft bigger physical players o line  d line  and we will  be back
Come on Skippy you should have known not to Trust your Cowboys especially against my Physical 49ers Army 😁😁😁
Dat thumbnail doh 😂
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS
Damn it, Shay & Skip not being in the studio for this one here doesn’t serve us any Justice watching the video 😂😂😂
I hate when skip acts like a toddler
I wish Stephen A and Skip were on the same network.   Imagine how a show called "Cowboys:  Point-Counter-Point" would dominate the ratings week after week with these two facing off.
Eagles fan here hey cowboys fans pull up a chair next to me and let’s watch the playoffs together 😂
Cowgirls beat their self blame whoever you want
How bout dem 9ers!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
You took your time to get on here. Good thing it’s a holiday 😆 😂
They didn't one team over 500 this whole year and wonder why they lost in the playoffs
Skip: You owe me 2 cases and 37 cases  *Im still waiting for Skip to give Shannon his 50 cases for the lakers winning 2 years ago and wearing the wig*
If cowboys fans weren’t obnoxious clowns they would get less hate.
All I could think about yesterday during the game was Skip crying lol
I must have watched another game lol yes the cowboys committed penalties but if your going to sit there and act like the 49ers were not your nuts
just saying, tony romo would have won that game prime tony romo would have won that game easy
SO "SHANNON SHARPE" TELL US HOW YOU REALLY FEEL!!!🤣🙌🏽🔥💯🏈😎💪🏽
I'm really glad that Shannon has taken the high road and chosen not to really rub it in. VERY professional.
I came here to watch Shannon go in on Skip
Its dak not mike
❌ Shan laughing like Michael Jackson He he he 😎
Man I love these guys so much🤣 I look forward to watching them through out the week
In no way whatsoever is Dallas better than SF.  The record difference is solely due to the divisions they play in.  Niners started slow but are who they are supposed to be now, a great football team.
America's Team? More like America's Meme at this point.
As someone with no dog in the fight , even my jaw was hitting the floor, Cowboys beat the Cowboys
Have a go at tapping the helmet of a tough nfl player, then condone slating an umpire for not being as fast as one of the best athletes on the planet, who didn’t know the ball had to be handed to him, then blocking his way to getting to the ball as soon as possible and then re spotting the ball, rather than giving Dallas a few extra yards they stole (which might have been by design), as per the rules. Dallas moaning at the official on this are part of the reason they are losers nowadays, always blaming someone else
Skip looks like a dam fool every year from hollering super bowl. Im a cowboy fan but 49ers just beat us up and we penalize ourselves soooooo???
The problem it's Dak his a bust lol  Joe Burrow show up for the Bengals ND his new to the league ND Dak got shut out by 49ers ND he been in the league for a while . Cowboys it's a toxic organization .
Find you a life partner that loves you like skip loves the cowboys.
Man cowboys always choking when it matters most... Then again they wouldn't be the Cowboys🤣🤣
This shows how strong the NFC West is. 49ers 3rd in the NFC West beat the number one team in the nfc east in their house. I wonder if they can take down GB as well.
Never seen this happen in almost 20years of following 🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️🤷🏽‍♂️
Lmao Skip 🤣 🤣 🤣
Put that jersey back in the trash skip!
Old man Skip needs his meds.
Havent watched undisputed in months,  but I had to come see the disappointment on Skips face 😂 and the satisfaction on Shannon's 😎
Climate crisis > football
The Cowboys were unmotivated, has no urgency, tried fake plays, etc, all because they know they can’t win. They already lost to ARZ, and they know SF was a more powerful similar team. When a team needs to fake and/or needs unusual plays against another team, it’s cuz of the other team’s intimidation and swagger.
So now it’s the ref’s fault for not spotting the ball quick enough??? Who on earth would think Dak would call that play with no timeouts??? That was a dumb play to call there. Don’t blame that on the refs!
Skip needs to find a new schtick.  His worn out phrases; Tompa Bay,  running in Cabo sand,  broken down shell of himself,  $7.50 an hour,  Thomas Edward Patrick Brady Junior,  Dakota Reign Prescott etc., etc., ad nauseum infinitum.    No self-respecting coach would work for Jerry Jones as his lapdog. We need a sports show featuring Jenny Taft and Joy Taylor, poolside in Honolulu.
I’ve been waiting all year for this episode 🤣😂
He blames Mike McCarthy when kellen moore is the problem it's his play calling always trying to put the ball in the Daks hands that costs us every game
I was watching their previous video making predictions about this game during the actual playoff game. It was hilarious seeing how confident skip was with the cowboys winning that I was anticipating this video and watching skip just crumble on camera
How do you think the ref only has to touch the ball after dark slide at the 26 and the o line lines up at the 23? Not only that you had to let the ref touch the ball, but you spotted the ball wrong and agin not let the ref do their own job.  You had 1-2 free yards and thought that was fair. Nope that’s the cost of qb draw.
Skip "High Bloodpressure" Bayless  did not disappoint on today's show lol
Quiero llorar quiere llorar lol it’s all your fault the cowboys lost shrimp bayless so suck it up and own it like a Man U over there cry o like a little baby 😂 😂
Skip!!!…… your team should know better and poor Uncle Jerry was the only one that owned up to the performance of his team!!!!!!!
Anyone else only watch skip when the cowboys do something stupid
Skip, Skip, Skip!!! Cmon man, you know that last play was 110% on Dak! It is his job to hand the ball to ump, NOT the center! Had he handed to "RG4", they would have had another play. R. George did his best, and that is just the truth, but I knew Skip was gonna use that as an excuse!
Illuminate refs!! 😆
🤣🤣😂😂
Skip was wrong.
No Skip. The Cowboys are not better than The 9ers. Telling you man if Lance turns out to be a superstar The 9ers are going to be SB favorites.
Hey why does Undisputed not show the plays to the viewers when Shannon and skip are analyzing them?
Cowgirls will never be good so fans need to get a new team to believe in
I love Undisputed but did y'all really spend the whole show only talking about the Cowgirls and Brady and like 2 minutes of Belichick losing. To my knowledge Bengals, Bills, Chiefs and 49ers all won. How bout talk about those games too. Nobody ever doubted Brady would win against the sucky Eagles.
49ers ended the game 2 times before Dallas even got the ball back regardless
The ref was so shocked by the draw 🤣🤣🤣
Even the old school Raider’s are tipp’n there helmets to thm BOY’S🤣🤣🤣
Stop blaming this is as _the_ cause of the loss. Dallas lost the game _during_ the game. We shouldn't of been in that situation. If this was a shoot out back and forth between the 49'ers and the Cowboys, then this play would be an emphasis of discussion. It still does not change the fact that Dak made a mental mistake in not handing the ball to a referee.   "All the umpire needed to do was touch the ball."  No team is allowed to place their own position after a play on the field. That's the rule. Dak marked the ball in the wrong spot. The umpire even placed the ball in the wrong spot if you look at the line judge on the sideline. When the ball was snapped the line judge even moved to where the umpire placed it.  "The umpire was late to getting to the ball."  You can argue whatever you want about that. It is irrelevant. Should we now have every umpire be able to run a 4.2 40 yard dash?  We lost. We played horrible. We beat ourselves on penalties. We are the Dallas Cowboys and this is what we do this year.
I must confess......Shannon just knows his football....PERIOD.
Shannon:  'cowboy fans will blame it on penalties' Also Shannon: 'the Cowboys were the most penalized team so far in the playoffs'🤣
Shannon having an amazing morning lol
He meant teeter-totter or Seesaw... Fans were crying with the realization that they're stuck with Dak for another 5+ years and he really is as mediocre as we all knew. Cowboys fans didn't want him for that price but everyone in the media kept screaming, pay that man! And Jerry did.
On the episode of America's Game that covered the 1992 Cowboys Ken Norton, Jr said that Jimmy Johnson made it so uncomforable for them when they lost. That Jimmy made you feel if you didn't do your job then somebody else would. Dallas has a talented roster but a trash culture. No one is made to feel accountable when they don't perform up to expectations.
Maybe Dirk nowitzki can come out of retirement and show the cowboys how to lead a team to a championship.  Dirk would have done a better job than dik Prescott. $75 mil bum.  Maybe Dallas can get a pro bowling team so their pro sports teams can have a chance at a championship.  Cowboy fans crying in the stands after the game? How pathetic, it's just a game morons.
How bout them Hypeboys
Knew after the first game they were going nowhere , Dak is just a guy unfortunately. they should have persued a difference maker such as Burrow, herbert, allen, mahomes unless they get a player of that calibre and jerry being a sometime nusciance wouldn't be much of an issue and get a few other thing mike should only get 1 more full season imo, he is overrated though, for dak to encourage violence i understand he is sad he disappointed the fans but there was no need to encourage that at all under no circumstances makes me begin to question his leadership now unfortunately
Skiiiiip has excuses for everything 😂😂
Why aren’t they in studio
Dude the receivers weren’t even set for them to spike the ball anyways
I knew we were not going to the superbowl. Dak is not ready for this and neither was the team. Bad coaching just bad period
First thing MLK day this is what U wanted
Skip looks absolutely exhausted lol look at his face!
Been waiting for this lol
Skip coked out
I'm such Skip will blame the refs.  I'm sure Skip will give Dak a +A.   If Dak done anything the first 3 quarters of the game who knows.   If SF had an actual QB.  The Cowboys lose this game by 4 TDs.   The game wasn't a close as the finally score.  But we all know ifs never wins game.  Ifs loses games.
I’m not a cowboys fan but as a football fan I wish they had one second left for one throw. That way skip would shut up about it lol
Skip is so triggered lmaooo
Title of this video is wrong. It wasn’t “stunning”that we wom because if people watched us the last part of the season they would know the type of team we have and they would know that we a better overall team Cowboys they just played a softer schedule as well a muchhhhhhh weaker division compared to the bloodbath that is the NFC West. If Jimmy G wouldn’t have over thrown Brandon Aiyuk towards the end of the 3rd quarter this game would’ve looked much uglier than it really was. Skip and all the Cowgirls fans in shambles and like McDonald’s I’m lovin it😂❤️💛.
Spoon fed bad teams.
Been waiting on this the minute the game ended and Unc did not disappoint 😂😂😂
Remember when everyone was talking about the Cowboys had a moral victory against the Bucs?
Lmfao.
Skip look like he been getting high all night or crying all night
When you continue to do the same things over and over again with the same results, you are not “better than that”. You are who you are. To say, “ we are a better team than the 49ers” is laughable and very consistent with the Cowboys false narrative.
Dak is a bad qb lol. What is Steven A’s saying . They are an accident waiting to happen lol
Jenny got that laugh like m*********** we knew you was wrong you p****
I only have one comment about the game. I heard that after the game Cowboys fans were throwing stuff at the refs. That is both classless and stupid. But I guess it’s about on par for any NFL fan base.
Talk all that sh*t. About coach McYay. You can't even get a coach to motivate himself to be healthy or let alone lead men.  Joke. The leader joker Skip.
Dak has the big 4th (after 3 awful qtrs.) because there is absolutely NO pressure at that point! No expectations means playing free and lose.
Skip looked like a dying human at the first 10 seconds 🤣
Nobody is talking about them adding 2 sec to the clock when the 49ers punted the ball on 4th and inches
Shannon and Cornball with no rhythm
Skiup!  Ya lost Skiup!  Gimme my cases of Dew!
Collect those cases Shannon! lol
They fans are the worst
Dak needs to divide up all that money Jerry gave him and give us a refund/pay us fans our money back….he scored 7 point at the start of the 4th….freakin ridiculous!!!!
This was a good segment.  I really enjoyed this !
Skip really believes the game should be refereed differently for the cowboys to get the better part of it.
The fact that Skip really tried to blame the refs before Dak, the coach, the play calling, the defense, or anyone else really shows just how delusional Cowboys fans, especially Skip, are
As an Eagles fan this loss eased our loss somewhat, we didn’t look anywhere near competent against the Bucs.
Bathtubs filled with Mountain Dew
5:30 Skip’s voice was funny af 😂😂😂
Hare's tha Thang skiup
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Dallas Cowbutts - Americas A-holes
Look….Skip gotta take it maaaan. 😂 And to all my Philly Eagle faithful.. “FlyyEaglesFlyy 🦅”…. Until next Season ✌🏾
Dak should have gave the ref the ball, not his lineman
I laughed so hard when the game ended yesterday.   I couldn't wait to see Skip lose it this morning
*cowboys for super bowl* 🤣
When Shannon said merry go rounds go up down, I think he meant Ferris wheel lol.
How bout them cowboys
Daaammm Sharpe!!! Skip over there looking like he has the "stomach virus"😂😂😂😂😂
Dak should have found the ref after the slide and handed him the ball to spot it and not given it to the center. There probably would have been a couple seconds left to run one play.
Shannon bodied Skip like usual.
All this yelling over Diet Mt. Dew.  At least make it Shasta Mountain Rush.  Pepsico is trash.
Poor SKIIIYYYYUP
It’s the cowboys fault they are miles better than the niners but the niners are disciplined and coached well the cowboys lost because they could not tackle and penalties.
Cowboy's on the right track, I'm a diehard Steelers fan.
Dak isn’t a roller coaster, it’s really really really simple. He needs the run game, he cannot carry you with his arm. They win when they run it more than they pass and lose more times than not when they pass more than they run.
YEAH IT'S YOUR FAULT BECAUSE YOU HYPE 'EM UP!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
As an Eagles fan, please keep Mike McCarthy as Dallas’ head coach, he deserves a 2nd, 3rd,4th and a 5th chance,  and hire Jason Garrett back as a Offensive Coach😁😁😁(Yes I know the Eagles were swept by Dallas this year, but my Eagles were “retooling” this year )
Now that window for the Cowboys to win a SB is closing. They paid Prescott all that money. Then they’re going to have to pay Parsons and Diggs a lot of money and as a result of that it will limit building a good team because there isn’t a lot of money to go around.
when he was like, :I slept like a baby and said "lord let me please open my eyes tomorrow......AND GIVE IT TO SKIP TOMORROW!"  I was like LMAO Funny!
Stop it Dak and Dallas players blaming the refs that rule has been a rule since NFL was in invented,If you have a DVR or watch highlights watch where Daks knee hits,it's the 25 and half yard line,then the center and Dak place the ball at the 24 yardline,that's why refs have to spot ball,the ref spotted the ball wrong  in Favorite of Dallas anyways.
Dak got sacked by a ref....hes garb
It was either this week or next week for a loss for both teams😂 Cowboys weren’t beating Bucs and SF ain’t beating GB 🤷🏻‍♂️
With all those cowboy tears and whining about the refs they should be banned from using 40 whiners for eternity. The Cowboys are the biggest bunch of cry babies in the league. Whining because they can't spot the ball themselves??? Come on man
Skip's sarcastic congratulations at the end was the best lol.
San Francisco came out way more physical than Dallas.
Can we call it what it is dak is not that good
Dak was still set when the ref set the ball. Him running into him did absolutely nothing. It was a dumb play
The way the ref said game over and ran off the field was funny as heck..
Great job skip...I'm proud of you 😄😄😉
The Cowboys' offense didn't show up. Plain and simple. Since they lost, the sports media have a right to take a 10 ton 💩 on them. But as a Cowboys fan, whatever. They're the main talking point until the next big story and/or tragedy in or out of sports. I can take it. Next up, Draft Day. 🤠💙
NAW JERRY JONES SORRY A NEED TO DO IN THEIR CONTRACTS FOR EVERY PENALTY A MILLION DOLLARS FOR EVERY ONE...I BET IT WILL STOP THEN...💯👊🏿POP WARNER PENALTIES
Knock it off. The ref went hard to get there. Don't put that bad played game on that ref. Excuses suck🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤫🤣🤣🤣🏈49ers 4 EVER
Dak looks like what the Cowboys want at QB he's the flavor of the month...but he is a backup qb and only a decent one....I mean tom bradys backup crushed him
NINERSSSS ❤️💛
As a Cowboys fan, this is exactly what I expected.  I have watched it all year long.  It was a penalty fest, just like on Thanksgiving and so many other games.  It is absolutely unreal.  And, can these announcers, who are such good friends with Kellen Moore, quit blowing the hype up about how great of an O-Coordinator he is?   I saw literally no innovative offensive play calling all year long after Week 1.  He had some decent wrinkles in there vs. TB the very first game of the season, but as the season went on, it became more and more like Jason Garrett offense 2.0.  Kellen Moore needs FIRED.  He is a terrible Offensive Coordinator.  Plus, whoever is responsible for the penalties also needs fired (looking at you Mike McCarthy)!
Sad trying to blame the ref.  It was Depress Scott that should find the frikkin ref and quickly.  Just lolololololololololololololollollolllllolll
Been saying it for years; Jerry Jones has to step down as GM and hire a GM who is young and upcoming. They will never make it to the Super Bowl if Jerry stays at GM.
That game was a lot closer than it needed to be all thanks to Jimmy G. If that 9ers team gets a top 5 QB I think they can be SB favorites.
The Cowboys are NOT better than the Niners.  Jimmy G is worse than they are but that's it. Our secondary with Emmanuel Mosely returning is much improved with rookie Ambry Thomas starting to finally come along in the last 4 games.  Moving forward I'm worried about Bosa and Warner's health and we will have to figure out how to win despite the handful of Jimmy G airhead plays that come along. He has grit for playing with a bad thumb for sure but he makes bad decisions consistently and that's the biggest question mark game in and out with the Niners.
Just stopped by to see a Skip meltdown and Shannon laugh at him! 🤣🤣🤣
The cowboys are a regular  season team they don't know how to handle pressure comes to the playoffs it was a great experience going to the game tho lol
SKIP
So much for going tryhard mode on the eagles backups last week 😂😂😂 that really helped y’all out
Skip was finna pass out listening to Shannon take 😹
Y’all finally realize that Dak is overrated? Wentz would be destroyed had he had all those weapons and stunk it up.  Oh and Wentz > Dak still.
Cowboys are probably rooting hard for Arizona today so they won't be the only home team to gag this weekend.
Mtn Dew x Undisputed partnership needs to stay
Not gonna lie, the first thing I did this (European) morning was checking Twitter to see Skip feeling sorry for himself. Made my day. Makes my day every time seeing him blame basically God and the world, if the Cowboys lose. And boooooy, they do like to lose.
Packers gonna crush 9ers
Honestly, Skip looks like he was crying all night!
When the Cowboys lost, all I could think about was Skip.😂
Now cowboys fans are worrying about the Refs conditioning. Just accept it, you’re trash!
Dak Prescott is a backup QB
Inject this directly into my veins
Stop calling Trevon Diggs Stefon, the man in Buffalo deserves better 😂
So would you rather the ref go around your line and waste more time?Dak shouldn't  have gave the ball to his center.
I’m tired of everyone blaming the referees. One name: Larry Fitzgerald. Take a few notes from him, Cowboy’s players.
Looked forward to Shannon cooking skip as soon as the game was over
Audio on this is horrible
Skip actually bet 9 cases lol he bumped it up on Friday
I was waiting for this 😂
What can go wrong , will go wrong !! 😂😂😂
I'm loving watching this 🤣🤣🤣🤣 SKIIIIIIYUP
YES SIRRRRRRER SKIP BAYLESS TAKIING THIS HOT SERVED L’S ALL NIGHT LONG 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Why do they keep talking about the last play like that determined the outcome of the game. Jimmy G gave the Cowboys chance after chance to turn around the game and they didn’t show up.
stop playing with points, straight up like in the real life games, they dont use points on the field.
“Merry go round goes up down up down” lmao
"Your guy is Merry go round "  Before the season:  Shannon, "Dak deserves his money"
Tell um how u Feel Shannon
For the life of me I cannot understand why EVERYONE spends so much time talking about a chronically mediocre team - the Cowboys ! What have they done lately to justify SOOOO much attention ? Nothing, nothing for 15 years and nothing for 15 years more. Go Mediocracy !!
Imagine baming the referee for doing his job. He doesnt just have to touch the ball he has to spot it in the right spot! The center doesn't dictate the spot of the ball the ref does. Plus the ref literally tried his hardest to get to the ball but your players are in the way so what do you want him to do?
Your guy goes up and all over the place.  Lol
Dak and cowboys, excuses and excuses blaming on refs, never on how poorly they played against the 49er chain saw of a running offense.  Serves cowboys and fans right, they in denial and will never win till they fix that!
Trade Dak to Detroit.
Ha Skip wasn't as mean as he usually is when his team chokes. Good effort good job 👏
Let's go Niners!!!!
Skip has no insight but to recap the game 🤡
First the cowboys are done next tom Brady is done next week poor skip your season is done and Tom season is done 😂😂😂
Super Gremlin Unc
The #3 seed in the nfc never has it good, there should be an infographic on that
Where them superbowl cowboys at now!!!!
Why do Shannon hates the Cowboys?   They were never his division rivals or play him in the playoffs.....  Yet praised Mahomes who plays for his division rivals (Chiefs)
Dak needed to hand it off to the umpire like a running back, not put it down and block the umpire.
Skip lol 😭
Serves u right delusional cowgirls fans LMAOO
We're not way better we are better...  Yet,  the better team wins.
STOP YELLING
As a Seahawks fan that is close friends with DIEHARD  Niners fans, that also believed that this would be a blowout witha Cowboys victory, Very good win 49ers. Well deserved.
What about number 21?
I like Shannon but trying to tell skit is cowboys is horrible dude and under overachieving and all those things just sound like you copying Stephen a Smith and Stephen a Smith jokes about the cowboys is better than yours Shannon so stick to what you know talk about Tom Brady or something like that but stop trying to be Stephen a when you talk about the  Dallas cowboys
I haven’t heard one sports channel congratulate the niners 🤫
the cowboys beat 3 teams over .500 ... the most fraudulent team ever.
Nobody was stunned but the Cowboys and their fans 💀
Referees did their job.  Dak lost that game by handing the ball to his center and not the ref like he’s supposed to.
The nfl referees are so bad it’s a joke that the nfl allows this trash!!! I’m done watching football until they do something about the referees
Skip done put this referee's job out on a public broadcast because he's mad about the loss. That's pitiful, and I'm a die hard Cowboys fan!!!
Cowboys only beat one playoff team huh
Yes all 14 penalties were with Merritt but they were not call the same on the other side if you look back Micah Parsons was held many times they don’t call the same game. Also they showed a game a while back with Green Bay playing and that umpire was over at a full sprint getting ready to get in position and grab the ball not what happened here he was 30 yards away and decides to move the ball back-and-forth playing a shell game for two seconds. Also we have seen it all year that the 42nd Klier expires and they actually give them like that whole half of a second while it’s at zero
Remember when Dak told Tom he will see him in the playoffs 🤣
Skip out here doxing the ref 😂. Man he salty lmfao
Go Cowboys! Still a fan but our Coach is not Star worthy and Team is to blame for all those penalties.  Smh. Horrible.  Never felt we were in it.
That game was a crazy game! The last 4 minutes of the game i was a 49ers fan. Just for that 4 minutes😂
Fun fact: 1 case of Dew is $1000, they just can’t say it on TV 😂😂
We are not even counting this year. Cowboys winning the superbowl next year. Cowboys nation baby.
Are you always blaming Dak when Ezekiel Elliott had 20 yards and getting played all that money the problem with the Dallas cowboys is they can't slow the clock down they don't have a running back that goes in there and actually just help them slow the clock down so the other team don't have so many opportunities so the defensive know all you got to do is stop Ezekiel in the first quarter and then they know Dak is going to throw the rest of the game that was they downfall bad coaching and a running back who just can't run no more
Let's just trade Dak an see what you can get
Its Sounds Like Stress Skip😂😂😂😂😂😂
I hate when they do the show like this. Why ain't they sitting at their table?
ive been a cowboy fan since 1966 and im done till jerry jones is gone!!!
Skip better Thank God that he still has Thomas Patrick Brady to fall back on.
Would skip have liked the ref to run around the offensive line to touch the ball? It’s not his fault the Cowboys didn’t give him the ball
Dak is an average overrated QB 😂 and people thought he was elite 🤣🤣🤣 lmao I love it
Skip need to start playing the circus music he plays for the Westbrick blooper reels  when Cowboys lose. 🤣
It cracks me up how nothing makes Shannon happier than when Skip’s teams lose 😂
Jenny ❤❤❤
fire burger boy mccarthy. he cant coach on the nfl level
Cowgirls lost to old redskins personnel from coach to players-Shanny, Williams and any other Shanny took in
The referee shouldn't even been in the conversation, it's sad and laughable that Skip got to look for the referee for an excuse of a game that Dallas stink up the place. I think Dak Prescott is overrated because to many times im looking and saying dude you have that guy and that guy wide open, how can you miss who are throwing it to??
Dak Prescott is a slightly better than average quarterback. Their coaching is way behind the curve. The front office management  is the second worse behind only the Bears! Where are they now!? With good coaching the Cowboys might win a playoff game!
MAN I wish this show could've been in person this week. "Lord please let me open my eyes tomorrow and GIVE IT TO SKIP BAYLESS" XD
"We defer because we got a big bad defense......NO YOU DON'T!!!!!!!!" 😆
My cowboys suck I'm tired of them
Super gremlin nah that was hilarious 😂
Why it sounds like everyone’s yelling on this show today lol sounds higher pitched then usual
I’ve been waiting to see this😂
COM'ON SKIP!
Is Dak still that guy? He still just has one playoff victory. Josh Allen at least made a Conference Championship game and can possibly make another.
LOL I SLEPT 😴 LIKE A BABY 👶 🙃 😅
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS SKIP? LMAO
Best upset game of the weekend!!! Go Jimmy G!!!
Larry fitz gives the ball to the ref 🤣
MacArthy shoulda went for at least 2 4th downs
Just here to watch the overreaction of a 60 year old claim how “his” team lost when he has no ownership whatsoever 🍿
Let me ask you question skip! Repeat 8 times
I didn't feel confident in them.  However I'm not an atypical Cowboys fan either.  The offense has been flat against good teams all season save game 1.  They've stomped bad teams but Dak certainly hasn't played like he was worth 75 million.  I said it 3 years ago I'll say it again.  They should have signed Cooper, traded Zeke and let Dak go.  Instead they kept all 3 and 2 of them are dramatically overpaid based on performance.
THE COWBOYS HAVEN'T WON A BIG GAME SINCE OL'🐐👑JAMES WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ..
I'm a cowboys fan but I have to agree with Shannon
Oh boy I got the popcorn and I am ready 😎
Zeke Elliot is straight trash. Dude went down on 1st contact every single time. He goes to the ground as soon as he hears footsteps. Never seen anything like it. The SF RB's were carrying 4 and 5 guys and busting up tackles on every play. I'm a fan of neither team, but were watching Zeke like "WTF is this dude doing?" He wouldn't fight for a single inch after he made contact with the defense.
I told all my cowboy fans, Prescott is more around 30-35m a year and they gave him 75m a year just to be inconsistent 🤦
But they're still "America's team"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
think every cowboys fan thought they where gonna beat the niners and bucs and cant even get passes san fran
A pocket passer wins again…even if Grap wins, they will treat him like Fowles and dump him
Look at Skip’s facial expressions! Priceless. Hahahaha I love it! Oh it hurts him deep Sharp!!!
The embarrassment and stupidity continues.  What can go wrong will go wrong.
Jimmy sure gagged his way into the next round. Lol.
If the Cowboys played the teams they played in the regular season in the playoffs they might have won a game or two
Im here to see Skip take that L...as Jenny. Happy Monday folks ✌🏾
Skips needs to retire. This is so cringe and embarrassing.
“You gotta get punished for 2 and a half hours for your unruliness all year”. That made me laugh way too hard
Why are they not even in the same studio anymore?
That Look On Her Face Told The Story LOL 😆
*Skip:* We deserve one more shot to rectify all our mistakes that we made!  Wait, what?
They bet 10 cases last Friday
Dak and Zeke are trash. They gotta go, along with that head coach and OC. Pitiful
the draw made sense. just really gutsy if not stupid without timeouts and that little time on the clock. you can expect refs to set u up so perfectly. whole team takes the L
Tony Romo was lowkey hating on Dak.... Every time Dak stats got brought up Romo got silent. Dallas is my team but the team plays undisciplined...To many penalties
😂😂🤣😂😂
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA 😆HAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAAAAAAAAHAHAAAAA  🤣
This was not on McCarthy
Hmmm…I am starting to think those cases of dew they bet aren’t actually cases of dew.
Skip putting that mans primary job out there thats very wreckless
Much love for both these guys... But DAYUM Shannon laid into Skip!!! Lol these two are hilarious
got damn Jenny.. 😍
😆😅😂🤣 How 'bout 'dem Cowboys Skippy‼️🤠 You're always at least that wrong Skippy. .... don't forget KD doesn't like you either. 😆😅😂🤣
Only skip is blaming the refs. Literally everyone else on every show is saying its the cowboys fault. First give the ref the ball and plus the line was blocking the ref. They've been breaking down the play all morning.
LOL!!!!! Biggest “L”  for Skip. 😭😭😭😭😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Whites haven't been this hurt since the election
My favorite part is watching how a $80 million quarterback like Prescott blaming the refs for choking in a playoff game.
😂😂😂😂
HOW BOUT THEM COWGIRLS!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
$7.50 contract
America’s FAKE team 🤣🤣🤣.....🗣🗣How bout them Fake Super Bowl pretenders 😂😂😂
Skips face!!!😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!  hahahaha
5:31 😂😂😂
Damn Dallas y’all always break my heart ❤️
bums hahaha
Just stoping by to show respect 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m sorry skip You should dump them now  Change team skip.
Cowboy s suck
“thats the end of the show” -skip bayless
I never believe that one single play is the reason for a win or loss. I suppose if I believed in luck but you make your own luck!
There’s no way this is the referees fault. This isn’t street ball. You can’t mark the ball yourself in the nfl. It doesn’t ever happen. Skip is delusional
1,2,3 cancun 😂
Once you’re drafted by the Cowboys you’re elite because you’re a household name. Then things like this happen and Cowboy fan are confused. Stop doing this.
They should give Aaron Rodgers way more credit after this for achieving everything he did, putting up all those insane stats despite McCarthy's  bad playcalling and clock management and making it so far with McCarthy every year and even winning a Super Bowl
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
RG4 lmaooo
I love it when Shannon goes in on Skip
Skip is pathetic blaming the ref and not Dak for NOT handing the ref the ball 🤣🤣🤣
Referees did their best to help out They couldn’t help themselves  How about them sexy cowboys.
Damn I wish they was in studio for this episode 😭
Skip called the 49ers defense  below average  and they were killing the cowboys  all night, WITHOUT BOSA.
Lol too funny
Shannon....merry go rounds go in circles...not up down.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 now I hope they talk about all the other games that were played on Sat and sun.
As a Cowboys fan I know we had no business being in the playoffs.  After week 7 that's when the decline started.  The following week the Broncos handled us quite well.  All these people being upset and all in their feelings is not needed.  If this team was in a different division then we wouldn't have a Monday talk about another playoff loss.    Now if we look at the penalties, what does that tell me.  The team lacks discipline.  The Bengals are the least penalized team and what did they do?  They won.  It also shows lack of preparation.
Skip pull ya slip up you’ll get your turn to talk and Ima a Cowboy fan
Jenny is soooooooooooooooooo soooooooooo pretty
“the game is over” hit so nice after yet another season
This team is always full of excuses. How about the coaches and players take more accountability.  You're at home and get shut out in the first quarter? This Offense has issues. The Defense has less but still gave Dak and Co. an opportunity.  14 penalties and you talk about the Refs?  Give me a break. You played 3 quarters. The Niners played all 4. Even if we pull out the miracle no way we go to Tampa and beat the Goat. I'll always keep my hopes up for My Cowboys, but we need to fix A LOT this off-season.  Terrible execution, terrible preparation and terrible excuses.  All the players and coaches, enjoy watching the rest of the playoffs from your couch and while you do that take note of the staff and players on TV on how a team with Heart and Grit and professionalism compose themselves.
No coach can coach any team when the owner cuts his balls off coming in the door .
whatcha talkin bout skip they went 12-6 lmao
Lol thumbnail
curse of the denver broncos
I think shannon or skip got covid and fs1 is keeping it underwraps I believe that's why they not in the studio together. 🤔
Unc tuned in "supa gremlin" lmao 🤣🤣🤣
My Cowboys are cursed. I’m convinced of it
49ers gonna be playing the SB
They Hate Head Coaches in Dallas. Mike McCarthy didn't do anything for everyone to be scape goating him. Kellen Moore Calls the Offense that he himself built and Dan Quinn had complete Autonomy over the Defense. Bones was coaching Dallas S.T. before Mike and will be here after he's long gone. Mike only controls the Challenge Flag. This ain't his fault.
Self entitled Dallas... goooooone
I knew it from the beginning!  They’re not built to win it all, and never will be. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
"The NFC East has been much maligned in 2020 -- and for a very good reason -- earning the title as the worst division in NFL history."
Those sexy boys did it again to skip
This is just sad by my favorite team I had a little hope after the draw but nevertheless, they played bad football.
A merry-go-round goes “Up,Down,Up,Down” uncle Shay?🤔 that’s mindblowing😂😂
i was waiting for this lmaooooooo
We need another coach bad. We are just cursed as Cowboys fan. The pressure is all on Dak. No running game. Our center and Connor Williams just let d tackles own them. Dak contract needs restructuring and also Dak and offense just always start slow them try to come roaring back. Romo hurt me for so many years now it's Dak disappointing me.
I couldn't sleep because I couldn't wait for this moment.... The league & media always put them in the Superbowl especially the schedule makers...
Oh how I've been waiting for this 😂😂😂😂🍿 📺
I been waiting for dis
Skip a real one for excepting his cowboys defeats
I’ve been waiting for this lmao
Skip: "you said they had to go home, they were at home" 😂😂
“HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS”😂
Skip never defends Dak the way he defends Tim Tebow and Baker Mayfield..... I just want to know why
The cowboys beat up on bad teams all year. Almost every time they played even a decent team they struggled and lost. They were severely overrated. And this game shouldn’t have been close. Jimmy G kept Dallas in the game. It should’ve been a blowout.
Skip always got excuses and a scapegoat every year
As a cowboys fan i believe this team is officially cursed 🤬😤
If feels like the world was waiting for this one lol enjoy everyone, we all this gone be good. 😂
Skip mad asl Lol
I love this show
Deebo Samuels is a throwback
My F5 key has broken. Also rather fittingly the first 49seconds of this are glorious.
You're always wrong.
would have been a better segment if they were in person
Dem refs was like Dip set Dip set💯💯💯💯
Skip playing crazy defense in this one 😭😂
I’d pay a lot of money to watch skip watch a cowboys playoff game. Skip Uncensored. 🤣😂
This goes for the Dallas Cowboys Fans.  If you are still cry 😭  like a baby for that lost game from yesterday here you some milk 🥛 🍼🥛🍼😭😭🔐
“stunned”
The cowboys lost in the most cowboy way possible. You can't make this stuff up
But Merry Go Rounds really DON'T go up and down. 🤣🤣🤣
Cowboys are soft period
I love the taste of Skip Bayless salty tears when he cries about his Cowboys, been waiting for the second all weekend! How about them Cowboys!🤠🤣
McCarthy is going to get fired he green lit that play. In his interview after he said he figured they would put more time back on the clock.
NFL is a business and cowboys are really good doing business. Football what is that.
Everybody know the cowboys was 12-5 cuz of a bad NFC East and had like the easiest schedules and next yr they will have a hard schedule and might not make the playoffs
Never in my life have I ever heard a ref say after reviewing a play, “I will re-spot the ball and re-measure.”
Ok skip, u said that when Monday come we was going to see what? I'm here for the excuses n disappointment n name blaming another yr 😂😂
Skip is in shambles and Shannon going crazy
As a packer fan this doesn't surprise me why do you think we fired McCarthy  another mcarthyism. He couldn't win with favre or rodgers  why would you think he could win with dak
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG, WRONG
Skip being real disrespectful to NVP Dak Prescott
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYZZZ!!! HAHAHAHAHA PLAY A REAL TEAM AND YA LOSE. BRING IT BACK TO THE BAY BABY!!!
Damn….Shannon bringing the 🔥
Skip why even waste time defending the Cowboys?!
It’s kinda bad tho if you’re down 32 cases to skip
It’s the entitlement for me. That’s why the Cowboys will never win. Jerry Jones need to stay in his place and be an owner and not the GM, HC, OC, DC and player 😂
Hey skip bet 20 for next year
Who else was waiting to see Shannon clown Skip this morning ? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭
I never heard the word wrong so much in a segment 🤣🤣
😂😂😂😂 man Skip going crazy for real. Blaming the coach is really weak
Love skips obsession with diet dew
What a shock that the winner of the NFC Least/Tank Division fell to a team that actually played and defeated other playoff teams.  Jimmy tried to give the game to Dallas at the end, but Dak just wouldn't take it!
I couldn't sleep waiting to hear Skip and Unc Shay
Jenny getting that pregnancy glow 😍 she looks gorgeous
This look like a interview for a future WWF match 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Elon Musk BOW to California. Greatness is here not there
This the only Cowboys segment I looked forward to watching all year lol
yeah blame the ref and not that they ran a QB draw with no timeouts. Cowboys have nobody to blame but themselves for having to play from that far behind in the first place.
I was waiting on today’s episode lol..!! I’m surprised they ain’t got a Lakers segment today since both teams loat over the wknd..!! Unless i aint seen it yet..
"Just gimme a Cowboy loss and pour water on me and I'll turn into  a Super Gremlin " 😆😂😂😂😂😆😂😂
Not in the studio eye in eye for this? Kinda disappointing :/
The last play didn't matter. It wasn't the ref fault Cowboys lost. 49ers already had them beat. And the clock was suspiciously changed from 1 minute to 40 seconds. And you can't blame the penalties when Cowboys kept holding.
Skip still have excuses while trying to be humble he's so pathetic
Shannon look like deebo Samuel 😂
...GOTTA LOVE SKIP...
😂😂😂
Oh hi SKKKKKKEEEEEEEUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!!!!😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣  HOW BOUT THOSE COWGIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!🤣🤣😂😂
I was at this game live in person. My first live NFL game and man it was breathtaking. T.V does no justice!!! The ending was insane!!! What a game!!!
Defense gave up 1 touchdown drive and 3fg  That touchdown off that INT wasn't on them
Every Cowboys loss looks like it takes 5 years off Skips life lmao
Skip looks so defeated
He's the only one surprised we all knew it was happening
As yes you were on fire on Twitter
If Dak is way better than Jimmy, then WHY DIDN'T THEY WIN. They had the better qb, the better defense, at HOME. Why didn't they win?!!!! Dak couldn't make more plays than Jimmy?! How PATHETIC!! How 'bout them cowboys!! 😂😂😂😂😂
He got you skip
Absolute facts you were wrong Sayless. And I like the Boys but they are not a good team. I knew they would lose in the first round
I can’t be the only one that thought of that classic “IT’S MY TURN!!!” from Skip the second the cowboys lost last night 🤣🤣🤣
Don’t understand what felt different about this team.  All you had to do was watch one game from them this year to realize that one and done was very likely.
Where are you cowgirls fans now?? Hidden from all social media once again screaming all that we dem boys yeah, that exit first round and hurt you poor fans for the 27th straight year 😂
This is exactly why patriots never over pay players…money doesn’t make you better…all these QB RB etc…making 20+ mil but playing like trash…
This is great, but would be better if they were in the studio for it.
I hope with Cowboys lose they will talk less bout them until next season Today"s whole show was basically Cowboys talk
Skip is heartbroken lol
The cowboys lost because they are the cowboys. They always lose why is everyone so surprised this is what they do, for the last quarter century all they do is lose
Worried about Aaron Roger
Shannon called it lmao
I'll admit, I overestimated the Cowboys, I thought they'd get through the first round
Might be the one time Shannon was up earlier than Skip waiting to beat the brakes off of him
Jerry said it well, dallas has all these combinations of players together you have to have success and it shouldn't have come to that last play.. You fans make excuses and don't see that 😂
America has been waiting for this...
Man there are other games/ teams to talk about..: wtf
The Cowboys are still the Cowboys: One and Done. 🤣
I don't like both teams
The Cowboys are gonna CowBoy🤷🏿🙃
Kellen Moore is getting offers but couldn't win or execute in the position he's getting offers for 😂
We've been waiting for this 😂😂😂😂
Skip is the most delusional cowboy fan of my life time 🤣🤣🤣
Dak runs a draw without timeouts. Ok that’s pretty funny. The ref blankly saying “the game is over”. I laughed so hard.
How the Cowboys continue to under perform like they do is mind boggling. They have an enviable roster but can't even make it out of the 1st round smh 🤦🏾
Your division sucks. My afc is tougher
Jenny is glowing!😍
Skip's meltdown makes the whole end of the game last night worth it ten thousand times over
Skip is wrong. Dak started to slide at the 26 yard line. He gave the ball to the center to snap at the 23, the ref brought it back to the 24. The ref had every obligation to grab the ball and bring it back to the 26. Skip should be happy because the Ref gave the cowboys 2 extra yards they didn’t earn. The center doesn’t get to pick where the ball gets spotted, the Referee does. BTW this episode would have been 100x better in studio.
All seriousness, let’s give Skip some credit. At least he accepted the loss this time. Lol
Had to watch this live this morning to see sad sack Skip try as hard as possible to make excuses for the Cowboys loss, deflect questions and assign blame.  Shannon: “Your quarterback is a roller coaster, NOT a merry go round!” “Your Cowboys are EXACTLY who I thought they were!”  Past Shannon Comments Regarding Screwups: “You can ALWAYS count on the Cowboys to do Cowboy things!” “Mike “Drop The Mic” McCarthy is coach in name ONLY!”  It was a joy to watch every second of this LIVE!
America team🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🌲
Cowboys lost because they didn't show up and they got outplayed Dak was average Mccarthy didn't have his team ready. For the life of me why call a run with 14 seconds left. They deserve to lose. I know Jerry won't do this but he needs to find a new coach.
Cowboys fans can’t blame the refs. 77 yards rushing? 14 penalties? 7 mins less time of possession? 7 points going in the 4th quarter? This game didn’t come down to 1 or 2 plays, the Cowboys deserved to lose.
Mike McCarthy is now 3-0 against the Cowboys in the playoffs.
" The Cowboys will do cowboyish things" - Shannon Sharpe
Word of the day Dallas. When was Dallas time they went to a superbowl? 🤣💀
Jenny looking gorgeously thick
Dak is who i said he was from year one..a backup..Dak is a big game choker and he and 2 yard Zeke should resign. Jerry is an idiot if he doesnt let Zeke go and make Dak a backup and go get a real QB
This delights me. Cowboys losing and Skip and Shannon the next morning.
bro this gotta be the 10th video of the same title.
This is Undisputed at its best!! Lmao You love to see it 🤣😂
Wish they were together in person lol
the cowboys practiced an extra week just to lose. 😂
Ya cowboys are cursed for real for real
I waited all night for this. They are not that good. Dak comes every time he plays against a decent team. There was no way. We are #1 in the worst division. That says it all right there! We never see those teams outside of our division who play the dang gone game and play it well. Cowboys get an inflated ego and the moment they see a team that can play?!!  It's game over! They are good to win a division but nothing else. Not a thing else.
Why do they only bet mount and due cases ?
The better coached and better ye won..don't blame the refs...he was problem thinking these mfs really called a draw play
Skip is heated 🤣
when mark sanchez has 4 playoff wins in the last 25 years and the dallas cowboys only have 3 LOLLLL
As a cowboy fan kellen moore has to take blame for that. The offense looked a shambles all day.
That ref was a hugeeee 9ers fan 🤣
Am I the only who think they’re saying cases but it’s really thousands??
I knew he was gonna scream 🤣🤣
Greatest play ever to end The season
I have been waiting on Shannon and Steven A this morning 😂😂😂
Skip can get payback next week if the niners can take down uncle shay's guy Aaron Rodgers
Niners definitely wanted it more. Super Bowl 54 rematch maybe?
Fun Fact: The last time the dallas cowboys made the NFC championship game Trevon Diggs wasn’t even born yet😭
I didn't expect to get to the superbowl, but I expected to beat the 49ers and lose in the next round atleast. Pretty disappointing yet again.
Blame Prescott the 75 mill man
My heart is torn into pieces thanks to one Rayne Dakota Prescott 🥺
Don’t worry skip. Thomas edward patrick brady jr won’t let you down!!
Whoever did the thumbnail is goated 😂😂
I've been waiting to watch this since yesterday. When the cowboys lost, my 1st thought was "I can't wait to watch Shannon give it to skip" 🤣🤣
Love this when skip Bayless cowboys don't win I love it 😂
Life is good
DallASS fans crying before the game ended made the win that much sweeter!!!!! You clowns again thought this was your year!!? Remember what CAN go wrong WILL go wrong!!!!!! HOW BOUT’M?????? 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😂
If only this was in the studio.....
4 Finger Jimmy > DAK  😄
NFC East is below average
How bout dem Niners lol
Shannon is so happy, he's talking about carousels 🎠 😆
Rarely do I watch the actual show. I just have it recording but never watch it and just watch the YouTube clips from them. Today was a goooood day, LETS GO NINERS!
Skip is comedy
👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 Skips Cowgirls
Im a Giants fans i love it
Certified Cowboys classiC
COWBOYS are gonna COWBOY lmao 🤣 how bout them Cowboys huh!?!?
HOW ABOUT THEM CLOWNBOYS!!!!!
HOW BOUT THEM COWBOYS!!!!!!!!! PLANT CITY FLORIDA IN THIS MUTHAFUKA 💯
Been waiting for this since the game ended yesterday lol
Everyone agrees super gremlin made our Day:
Bin waiting on this show since last night
The ref way behind the play has me cracking up , he couldn’t believe y’all called a draw 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Cowboys were 6-0 vs NFC Least Cowboys were 6-5 vs every other team they played.
The way the Ref said “Thats the end of the Game…”  like it was week 1 and just dipped had me laughing uncontrollably like the Joker 🤣.
As a Cowboys fan I am hiding from society for the rest of the week! My phone has been blowing up from people who hate the Cowboys 😭
Who else kept thinking about this show as soon the game was over? 😂
You’re always wrong Skip, so stop trying to be right about the Cowardboys.
The moment we've all been waiting for!
Been refreshing the page for this to upload lol
Whoever called that QB Draw needs to get Deported lmaooooo
As soon as I saw the cowboys lost this video was going to be hilarious
I’ve been waiting for this.
The Cowboys fans ran in the stadium like it was a Travis Scott concert  Then they left it like one😂 This is what you get, SKIUP!
The Cowboys are called America’s team because all of America laughs when they choke in the playoffs 🤣🤣🤣
QB run up the middle with no timeouts left to end the game is the most Jason Garrett thing I’ve ever seen.
Poor lady became a meme 😂😂 but saw how happy that clout made her
As a Cowboys fan, I was waiting all day for this just to see Skip. He was so delusional thinking the Cowboys would go to the NFC Championship LOL. I believed everything Shannon said on Friday.
Officials are corrupt.
"stunned".... How it's been like this for 20 years
I wonder if that random woman has any idea she’s on the thumbnail for one of the most anticipated undisputed videos ever.
The 49ers are just a better team. way better coached
Cry skip cry
I’m not even a cowboys fan and I felt disgusted watching that performance yesterday! We all knew they were gonna lose ! LOL
How bout them Cowboys 🤠
How Bout Them Cowboys 😂😂
Everyone was saying how good they was when the was beating up on them sorry teams and finally played some completion and loss everyone saying cow boys taking it all the way this year 😂😂😂😂😂
My daddy 49rs are for real
"Na na na na! I got you! I got you!" 😂😂😂😂
Christmas came early in 2022.
Super Gremlin 😂😂
Jimmy G almost gave that game away
So... we don't need to put Skip on watch...?
It’s the same story with the Cowboys every season. They fall into their own self generated hype after years of disappointments and then when they fall they blame everyone but themselves. The biggest concentration of arrogance and egos can be found in this franchise
How about them cowboys skip!
I dont even watch NFL but im disappointed Skip Jenny an Shannon STILL arent back in the studio? Someone got covid?
Been waiting for this
The moment we've all been waiting for!
75 CENTS DAK WHO QB RUNS WITH 14 SECONDS LEFT😂
Yessir, been waiting for this since they lost!!!!!(HOW ABOUT THEM BOYS!!!)
As soon as I jump on YouTube this pops up lucky me!!!!!
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’m not a cowboys fan but they got robbed on the last played but it was dumb to run a ab draw with 14 seconds and no timeouts. Smh somebody losing they job
What a great way to start the week 😂
Dallas fcking sucks man
Let’s b honest the Cowboys where frauds they beat inferior competition all year and where  praised for it…they literelly had the easiest schedule in the league ….everytime they played a decent team they folded all year long..there biggest win of the year was against a rookie QB that they had to take to OT to win…if u didn’t see this first round exit happening ur delusional
Been waiting for this since yesterday lmao
I cant wait to hear skip scream about the refs blowing it for them
Shannon listens 2 kodak black with that super gremlin reference 🤣
Skip let’s himself he "stunned" every year. We all know the Cowboys are gonna fail
Waiting for this all night
Skip so salty
