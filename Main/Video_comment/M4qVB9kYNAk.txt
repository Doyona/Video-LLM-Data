You are the one and only person who’s ever bullied a proper cardboard submarine that can fully go under water with air in the sub and I’m impressed
Who’s here in the big 2025
Am I the only one who see's the irony in him building a cardboard box out of cardboard boxes?
wowza
cant unsee a monster on the thumbnail
Is it just me but I see a face in the thumbnail
Now just dye the water red and you can play Iron Lung at home!

better then the titan sub

funny thing, I go to a boys camp where every summer we race cardboard boats, so... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (just coat the entire thing in a layer of duck tape) (or two) (or three)
Sadly something happened similar to this when it was early 2023 but what a epic skitz vid !!!
This is literally stupidest thing Liam has ever done
The thumbnail looks like a daily dose of internet vid

Back in the day, they used to sell an entire Nabulus nuclear submarine in comic book ads...   https://secretfunspot.blogspot.com/2007/12/polaris-nuclear-sub-photo.html
Meet your new Secretary of Defense.
Thank you Liam for making such wonderful videos!
This didn’t age well
goofy
The intro is one of my favourite things! 🤣👍
this sure aged well
This didn’t age well.
ah yes.. liam was the deziner of the titanic sub.
At least he does not want to make a company named oceangate
Edit: “oh I left him like a son-“
My younger self would cry and beg my mother for boxes. (Like always)
Just as good as OceanGate TM
3:30 rip Liam Michel(?) Thompson. "This video is of his last breaths. Last words: IT'S SO COLD, AHH, IT'S FALLING APART! NO! THE CAPTAIN MUST GO DOWN WITH THE SHIP! AHH! " rest in penguins😞.
i thought he was gonna mention the submarines titanic
this didnt age well
Was anyone else completely terrified that he'd fully drown in there??
Looks like mcdonalts happy meal box to me. No wonder why it didnt sucseed.
cardboard titanic submersible
"Iron lung? More like cardboard lung"
Liam you need to go to the bottom. do a part two please!
00:02:13 eerrm akshually 🤓 it's a dipod
The fact that he actually did it without clickbaiting is just amazing.
still built safer than oceangate
This Guy had a full ocean gate experience.
Uhm, this aged well😂
this video didnt age well
In another universe, this is how he died
This aged well.
this is better than the titan submersible
Foreshadowing……..
oceangate approves this message
Me asusté un montón. Tienes ideas locas, y eso es bueno de cierta manera. Pero, nunca hagas esto de vuelta.
Sure hope a 250k submarine implodes this year!
This video didn’t age well 💀
Bro would’ve gotten canceled if he did this now

Pov: How oceangate builds submersibles
This one didn't quite aged so well

Might need to use the controller F710 the next time....
this aged well.
The billionaires on day 3 be like
seeing this a year later 😭😭
Anybody here after titanic submersible implosion
his submerine is better that the titan 😂😂😂
did not age well
3:28 the 5 people on the ocean gate when they started losing air
If only he knew one year later what was going to happen with that submersible. If only he knew...
the billionaires could've used this to go see the titanic
'this submarine was sponsered by logitec'
This submarine is lowkey better than that titan submersible…
titanic sub replica
Yo I bet we could convince some billionaires to go in there for $250,000 no cap
this video aged poorly
I never knew Stockton Rush watched Liam Thompson
Youtube, not a great time to recommend this after the titan sub 🤨
Lol June 2023 is all I have to say💀
Anyone else got this recommended after the submarine incident
Actually, I was thinking, “Liam, how are you actually going to float??”
titan submarine💀
dude watching this in 2023 is so 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
no way this was in my recommended at the most topical time possible 😂
logictech controller
worked better than the titanic one
6:48 the titan submersible inplosion recreation:
The Titan guy took this vid waaaaay too seriously
This aged too well 😂
I wanted to check it out and buy but its very expensive

put flex tape on the bottom
Hey you stole my name I'm liam
Not to be that guy but the definitivion of a submarine  is it goes buck up from water
That moment when you almost die and then laugh about it
The amount of dopamine this gave me is more than it should, likely because of the water, I need you to do this again.
ill give u an idea. make a good submarine and then get like 10 rolls of duct tape and wrap the entire thing with it. that will work way better
Wait…how did you get the weights OUT of the pool?
Liam and its water proof!! 2 SECONDS LATER  drops it  Me: it should be Liam proof
"Getting inside a box and then going underwater is a terrible idea."  very much explained itself in about 30 seconds

2:10 Just noticed Liam called a bipod a tripod
This is DOPE
Hi liam, this was amazing. Im gonna try an convince my parents to get me of those camaras.   P.S  Im pretty sure you cant tell me this, but, when is your new merch coming out? I missed my chance last time even though ive been subbed for ages. :)
He should have done Flex tape on the whole thing. Then it would be dry inside
Two words: Flex 👏Seal👏
watch the flex tape ad please
this is the footage of the titanic
its sponsored by insta360 and rn it has 360 dislikes D:
I didnt even need the warning to not do this at home. It freaked me out just watching this. I'm really seard of tight spaces under the water
this fells like a mr beast vid
3:53 R.I.P Prototype Cardboard Submarine.
Liam in 15 years time: Ok ladies and Gents or whatever in between, today we are going to be flying to mars only using this cardboard rocket I have made. NASA and Elon Musk: damm this guy is always one step ahead of us… like how does he manage this. We spend millions upon billions of money and this guy is able to do it with $50. We must interview him
Liams face at 0:50 is the most cursed thing I have ever seen
0:56
how did you get air 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
Hey Liam I live in NZ to I love your vids 😊
Any chris cornell fans reconize the first montage song
Hello our first cardboard sponsership is hello phresh!
this is gonna save scientists and militaries all qround the globe millions of dollars. Thank you for your service, Liam

Mark rober funni version be like:
he could actually die in there if he close the submarine to tightly and he could not open the boxes and die💀💀💀
What if you have a something sharp so you do drown
What the fuck am i even watching? 10/10
Every child dreams of doing something like this
Awesome job you should do a pt 2
When you were under water I didn't realise i also held my breath (yes, even when you were in the submarine) until i ran out of it lol
1. Year anniversary
1:31 mark rober
My guy just why but soooooooo cool
Did you try taping the inside as well?
lol
lol
U are big 🧠
why dont u make an actual submarine that size? that would rack up so many more views!
Hi   Read more
If that wasn't cardboard and it's sealed very tight you could die from the lack of oxygen or drown on the first attempt
Best sponsor and brand could get. Seriously, I want to buy one now
Can I try it at a hotel if I can’t do it at home?
about to go to bed and a video with cardboard submarine pops up on my screen. I need answer, sleep is for the weak
What if you tried this again but you water proofed the cardboard and you made an air tube running from the sub to the serface. And you made an easy escape exit
You do now that you could drown!
6:48 and he was never seen again
wheres the sixth statement of lets make a meme?
7:18 the freeze frame tho
0:54 dude we was a legit murderer
Never thought of Submarine as square-shaped---thinking outside of the box is one of the things I so enjoy abt you/your vids (pun intended, of course) So were you able to make the You & Other You be simultaneously on opposite ends of the couch by using the sponsor's camera/ how did you do that? (great surprise-made me curious).Thanks❣
7:53
Shoulda brought scuba stuff. Like, an oxygen tank?
Reminds me of the box fort videos that used to be popular
This is the dumbest idea because cardboard+water=mashed cardboard
The random piece of hello fresh cardboard at the start was way more effective than any sponsership
WHY ITS NOT FOR CAT????
Liam really embraced his inner mark rober, with that music
Sinking of the Titanic (1912, Partially Colorized)
i bet he found his engineering degree in one of those cardboard boxes lol
I know whats the problem, he didnt use Flextape.
Just cover the whole ting in tape
The new Iron Lung update is pretty cool.
I saw the insta 360 on amazon once, nice to be reminded about it and also that by the time I get the money to buy it I won't remember it again.
Same music that is used by mark rober,nice.
Imagen if that was going to die evry nespaper titel vil be ‘man drowns when making a kardbrord u-bote’
This guy does loads of funny stuff 🤣🤣😂😂!
7:10
Добре
Liam you should of just got *slap* Flex tape!
Is it just me or did liam look bald when he came out of the water also my name is liam lol
This guy is going to invent a new planet in a few months
maybe you need proper safety next time.
Yes
drowning simulator
I suggest water proof card board. It’s a real thing
look at 7.17 LOL
You make very dumb ideas work and it Absolutely Hilarious to watch 👍
Can you make a car from cardboard
"How did he drown?"
Pls make another video just making a quite much bigger submarine your channel is actually epic
My Poor Submarine, I Loved you like a Son....... SECOND TIMES A CHARM - Liam Thompson

Why ,,...just why ⊙°⊙
woah! this is useless!
Should of been sponsored by carboard
I tride it ones
A yes, a box to kill someone that does not know how to swim
You can drown. Liam, i know you are making a video but please! Dont do this anymore. You can drown there are big chances. Thank you, bye! (Btw awsome vid)
Did you use flex tape?
Liam put himself in a box with rising water What a legened
Cool sponser but there like $380
I love it when his videos start with two or more Liams
0:40 #notsponsoredbyhellofresh
cover it all up with flEX tApE
The mark rover music hits different
Next video title will be I made a cardboard nuclear submarine
Hi
Hey
You know a YouTuber’s great when the sponsors are entertaining
What Was The Sponsor Again?
I couldn't help buf realize that you have multiple  hello fresh boxes :)
3:40 And this is how he died.
Where. Is. The. Flex. Seal?
It’s built on YouTuber endorsements and the materials that YouTuber need: Hello Fresh and duct tape
no liams were harmed during the making of this video
*SHING* hehehe 👹
If legitimate science is truly your friend, he would have told you that cardboard soaks in water and sinks. 🤣🤣❤️
This guy does what we all wanted to do as kids and didn’t.
What if you spray it with a waterproof coating
Rare footage of German scientists in 1940 making a u-boat prototype.
We all live in a cardboard submarine.
Liam is that one friend/person who never runs out of ideas, is always hyped, funny and ¿unique?
Recovered 1940’s U-boat footage showing the last moments of its crew
P H I L  S W I F T  H E R E  W I T H  F L E X  T A P E
So mad he's brilliant 😂
I do not trust u with a knife
99999999
the fact that he used a hello fresh sponsored box and it wasn't sponsored by hello fresh-
Liam the beatles beat you too it. They made a yellow submarine
Water go into sub to make it sink
ur kinda dumb this video was great
i was scared
He still is using the Alien tape
Is it just me or does the thumbnail look a bit like a sharks mouth in a box in the sea 🤣😂😅🫠😶🫥
Liam: box, me, water,= views
Hope you can swim
sHiNg
Dude you swallowed it, you could find out what your stomach looks like, oh and then it'll dissolve as soon as it hits the acid.
Wouldn’t it be weird (and cool) to be his neighbour? 😂
3:12 Liam's mum/sibling:*goes outside for a walk* *sees Liam* Still Liam's mum/sibling:ehh it's probably just another one of his videos
Make a submarine that is completely sealed with flex tape. You might not be able to break out of it tho.
if i were doing this i'd put on waaay too much ducktape
Use hot glue
FUN FACT FOR LIAM: when u use spray paint, it becomes waterproof. There’s also special waterproof sprays, and the spray paint needs to have thick layers, I made a mini cardboard boat and we used 2 coats black spray paint
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxifGS0cXl1xRpPAMBmjtcnn9GD6tSyfJc poor liam this is the sadest cilp
We need a remake of this! (I wish for)   and meybe this time... a boat made out of plastic! I belive that could work! :D  please hear me out Thanksss!!!
This man makes sponsors fun to watch
I thought he died because he trapped himself in a box underwater, then I realized this video was posted.
I'm claustrophobic and this is literally my worst possible fear
Cardboard submariners beware!
It was terrifying seeing you in the cardboard submarine the first time with no one there to help you. 😬  I'd love to see you try this by completely wrapping it in tape to see if that would help make it more waterproof
why didn’t you stick gorilla tape all over it to make the submarine waterproof?
Whipped cream made from whips
Flex seal
2:49 LEGS
I guess you could say it's your go 2 action camera
every logical person in the world : do you bealieve in Gaps and wotha leakage?
You know most of his audience is American when he uses "pounds" instead of "kilograms".  It's me. I'm an American. We're f%$@&? over here.
🎶"We're all sinking in a cardboard submarine"🎶
You should use Iron because 1. It sinks and 2. It's water proof maybe and 3. It doesn't leak
the cardboard boat sank  he took advantage of his failure, Now his goal is to sink
Bro how did he get out of the cardboard I thot he was gonna drowned
3:05 Me:   R.I.P. Liam....
That had to be cold. Glad you tried this. Sorry it did not work.
That's like 2 of my phobias at the same time
3:39 so scard
4:02
If you really wanted this to work you should've water proofed it by wrapping it in tape like duct tape/masking tape
Hi
If you probably layered the boxes it would of worked
I literally could not stop laughimg
The fact that I thought this was going to be sponsored by “hello fresh”
Liam where do you live I need to see all the things you built in person how do you build all That stuff
2:54 AMOGUS
why?
Broh that scream got me dead😂 3:10
Titanic replay 😂😂😂 A CAPTAIN MUST GO DOWN WITH HIS SHIP 🤣🤣🤣 🚢
7:03  cursed background lol
Wood 🪵
As soon as I saw the title I was like "this is it... this is the video where Liam actually drowns"
He should use The alien tape
Liam is the person who always laughs at his own jokes🤣🤣😂😂😂
7:18 pointy nose
Liam I think you should do it again and also you can use hot glue or something waterproof…
there
no its she
she
I just realised there’s a face in the thumbnail lol
It’s so sad that Liam never learnt that Paper and Water don’t really go together
What must the neighbors think…
1:27 when the add starts 2:28 when it ends
I think I might buy one of those cameras! Wait forgot, I am broke.
Try again but use flex tape to cover the entire thing
BTW tinfoil if done properly is waterproof
WHERE IS THE FLEX TAPE! 😂
Titanic in a nutshell.
I was worried on the first attempt that he was gonna drown even though I knew he wouldn't
New Zealand Settlement 145: Hikutaia, New Zealand. Hikutaia had a cheese factory in the 1960s.
You should cover it in press and seal and tape so it I waterproof
His friends just said buh bye
who else thought he was gonna drown 😁 but great videos tho
Do you have a twin or someone thing you make some of your intros with
paper products + water = good submarine
the sumbarine litteraly looks like a washing machine lol
7:23 the face tho im dying right now
You should cover the whole thing with tape
I watched this video because I did this once
w..wh why?
You'r videos get me through through day tysm
Pro tip for anybody who wants to do this at home (even though you shouldn't lmao): BOXING TAPE. COVER THE ENTIRE SUBMARINE WITH BOXING TAPE. It's strong, the best tape for well, cardboard boxes, and it's waterproof so no major leakage! I can't guarantee you won't have minor ones though :D
Well that first attempt looked terrifying
liam thompson: drowed in cardboard box ._.
Has anyone else noticed he said ‘yolo’ and his hat says polo Just me ok
I bet there’s still a box full of weightlifting equipment inexplicably stuck at the bottom of Liam’s pool.
you are literally me but when i was a kid but i never actually made a thing that actually works lmao
James 3:10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so. (Also Jesus is king God is king.)
i love your videos bro they always cheer me up and make my day
I was so scared you were gonna not be able to get out of the box and then drown   which I guess was an irrational fear because clearly you lived to edit this video and put it on the internet
Well done, _now teach Frodo how to do the same thing_
Pls Tell Me Why Your Dog Looks Like Fried Chicken?
imagine he put so much tape he couldn't escape and it filled up and he drowned that would be horrible!
3:52 reference?
The first sinking was so dramatic

Ummmmmmmm, Liam, one thing.     I have a speaker that dies of charge very quickly (like 10 minutes) so I was wondering if you could add subtitles to your latest videos so i can still watch your videos .    Thanks
You forgot the periscope/ breathing tube
This is some Aus shizzzzz
You never let me down I any of your videos not to be weird
“I have no idea what I am doing.”Liam,everyday.
you should use flex tape
Look like that Smosh guys brother.
Still water in it don't work
this is the video i thought liam would die
"don't try this at home or anywhere" Not gonna trying it at home Don't know what anywhere is So gonna try in my pond
Try waterproofing it
Bro you should have made this a cinematic, would have made you sinking so much sadder
I literally thought he was going to drown the first time
Cardboard isn't waterproof
Liam, I just got banned for 3 days on Roblox. But I Guarantee your videos will make me forget all about it!
Me after reading the disclaimer: How can I try this at home , you need to try it in a pool .
So glad I don't live next door.
hey Liam where you a engineer?
We all live in a cardboard submarine, a cardboard submarine, a cardboard submarine
Luan pls make a another video of submarine
Hi! I would not do not that just because i’m afraid i’d run out of air or drown when the water came in
Imagine dying by drowning in a cardboard box
Looking out at your neighbours garden and seeing this would be a ride 3:01 I can’t-
plot twist it was all a add for insta 360 go
noice
He never gets boring
When there are ads and you are scrolling down in the comments Gets rewarded with spoilers :3
Liam actually made me want to purchase the camera.
that  went far better than i expected
360$ is a lot for a waterproof tic tac but it’s cool still want one
👀👀👀
coolest sponsor ever 😎
The style of your videos is just like good old youtube classic. Wish youtube stayed like this.  And to give it a modern oversexualised twist: your body hair is hot.  But seriously your smile and laugh totally remind me of Vinny from v-squared. Almost like a doppelganger 🧐
You should buy like the waterproof spray for shoes n spray the cardboard w that n then glue it together with Caulk
Liam, if doing this again, please put an escape hatch in.
just wrap the entire sub with waterproof tape another youtube did that a few years ago
I like how he's using hello fresh packaging cardboard for everything
03:32 - r.i.p 03:40 - no more :( 03:41 - it has come to an end
thought that another person uploaded this video because you died
FLEX SEAL
different title: Liam Thompson Dies
rip liam
all right liam i saw your video with the secret door.  I saw the one with the  home made roller coaster.  Now an under water submarine  out of cardboard?  Sub'd. (scribed)
Maybe He Should Put 2x Cardboard On The Walls
my dumbass thinking this is sponsored by helo fresh
i love this guy, his ideas are so interesting and out of the box
i expected it to just start leaking instantly at the end, but when it worked and he actually got underwater with no leakage i was suprised
Can you try to do I again but try this: add flex tape or any type of waterproof filling, and fill it in the holes and cracks, and try to add flex tape all around inside the box, basically covering it, it might work!
Liam: don’t try this at home My neighbours the next morning: why is there a cardboard box in my pool😑
i tought that you will die
try covering everypart of the cardboard with waterproof tape
1:31 is that Mark Rovers music !
Sooo, you made a water coffin tutorial?
This is what Australians call a bloody legend
Obviously attempt this again with heat shrunk plastic wrap and silicone sealant
he looking kind of sus
We are always a 10 y/o and boys will be boys.
Liam! When u put out ur merch out again u better make one that says “Oh snap brotha” instead of “Oh snap”. Shoutout to Grace! U messed up ur own quote.
And this is how he died
Liam: only an idiot would build a cardboard submarine also Liam:
nice leg hair i wanna lick it so bad
The bad good ideas man.
1:30 When the mark Rober music kicks in
He should build a real subrine
I like how this dude try’s to use a submarine underwater without anything providing extra oxygen. 😂
CO2 casually fills his air pocket
i was very scared that he would drown inside that
is the link real? does it work?
Cursed
OMG THE BEGINNING  IT MADE ME CRY 🤣🤣
Tape the insides
I really think this cardboard submarine is a titanic glued with the titanic
The man’s using a hello fresh box.
Imagine not being able to get out of the submarine and its flooding..
I remember this music... Hmmm, Mark rober?
theese were the trajic stories of the garney research vessel and the uss florp submarines
Liam: Has like 20 million boxes and piles of cardboard  Me: doesn’t even have a box.
You shoulda sprayed something on it that makes the cardboard more waterproof
How do you get out?
my dude gave me a panic attack cuz of my tallassophobia
ok liam well done with the sponsor! Now I wana get the camera myself! Looks pretty cool!
7:02 :  CURSE YOU PERRY THE PLATAPUSSSSSS
I REALLY THOUGHT YOU WOULD DIE ON THIS VIDEO.
Why the heck did you think the first one would work
rare  footage of the titanic sinking
0:54 that laugh sounded so menacing
Epic
Tipp: u need to Waterproof it.
When the mark rober music hits
3:10 - 3:44 I was actually worried for a sec there. Glad you're ok Liam.
1:27 rise and shine dr freeman
make cardboard plane that flys
3:10 I like how it's soo climatic and legendary like a movie 😂
if he made that box too secure he probably would have drowned in there.  "cause of death: drowned trying to make a submarine out of a cardboard box"
Bro that is so sad i would’ve cried if u died cause u are the best youtuber in the G A L A X Y
What if you fully cover it in duck tape
Liam almost dies also liam:Its so cold me: ;-;
Alternative title: Falling in my pool wearing a cardboard box and trying not to drown
At 7:00 look at his face
you should have coated the whole thing in Flex Seal, no leaks no problems
make a submarine from anything you want
And this is how Liam died he was a good man
Hi
He should have used a flex tape coating.
“Don’t do this at home” “Ok I’ll do it at-“ “Or anywhere” **leaves anywhere**
Mmhm?
0:54 when he did the “HeHhe”, thing it made me scared
most creative suicide
Spray the thing that hates water and then make the submarine
I can’t believe that my dream was also a cardboard submarine! I spent days looking for a cardboard submarine and I finally found a non clickbait one
FLEX TAPE! will sure do the trick
Why does this kind of remind me of the Titanic?
plot twist this was the titanic
7:10 LOLOLO LOOK AT HIS FACE AT THE SIDE
Your like mark rober without the money, the team, the ten million, the worked at nasa the degree in maths or something and living in America. You even got the music right 😁😁
6:48 *last known footage of the titanic sinking from the inside, not colorized*
Chris has also done it before
The 360 has been sponsored too much  half asleep ci
You look like Tom Holland
His face at the end when he paused.
Liams an epic human👍
i like the montage of making a box with a hole in it
This is horror seeing the box slowly filling with water. imagine you can't get out because of the tape hell no
Hi I have clicked the link for purchasing the camera but it doesn’t give me a free mount adapter bundle. How can I claim that? Thanks!
so the first time i wanted too buy something... IT'S 400$!!!
we all life in the yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine

POV: you watch this video. Now you want to make a cardboard submarine
He nearly died
*puts the music mark rober uses for every video for the sponsor*
Dude cant u cover the thing in plastic wrap
in the end i was waiting liam was going to kick the little box to the pool, poor me
The montage was way too epic for a submarine that looks like a trash bin but still love the vid
🎶Liam lives in a cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine,  cardboard submarine... 🎶 😆
1:45 , what , YOU LOOK LIKE RTGAMES , but for real you do
Cool maybe you can use a hot glue gun
When will Liam learn that cardboard disintegrates in water!😂 but I have to admit... it’s SO funny to see him fail😅
Why is his Chanel so stupid but so entertaining lol
the revival of S.S.Success
this one is really cool

Hi
Nobody:   40k people: this is sick 👍🏻
Can the insta360 camera stick to walls? *menacing climbing noises intensify*
Bro go-pro are doing out of business with insta 360
I reckon you should build a cardboard submarine but wrapped in tin foil
I love u and ur video also can u give me shoutout please
He looks like a minion 😇😂😂😂😂😂
4:25 Subtitles think you breathing is music
Speedrunning life be like:
The first attempt actually scared me 😰
Have u noticed that his hat says polo and he said yolo XD
Bro the instant 360 cam is so bad quality
Also... Titanic gone wrong
When you are Card Board at home
Titanic 2, directed by Liam Thompson
Dude if he could’ve drowned in that box if he didn’t make it out in time, sorry kinda dramatic but it’s just goes to show how so many people care about people’s entertainment, Thanks Liam
nigga id be scared as shit it would just break open and id drown  💀💀💀
i thought he was sponsored by hello fresh, it was constantley being shown on the boxes.
His vids never disappoint but the anxiety I felt when he was trying to get out was scary
Use that's alot of damage stuf
If I had money, I would definitely buy the insta360
liam... sometimes i worry about you
Flex tape, thts all i need to say
Title: i build a cardboard submarine Video: *makes a machine that most likely will drown you*
I actually thought this would be his last video
Well I don't know what else I could expect... 😂
OMG DID YOU LISON IN THE- COMMENTS AND DID MY IDEA
how did he not drown
You should have used FLEX SEAL
The most smart and entertanive man award goes to Liam Thompson
good thing he’s not claustrophobic, OH WAIT
Hey Liam please remember me when you invent the first full working cardboard flying car
You are from nz how dare you use pounds as weight
The thumbnail looks like something straight out of “Everywhere At the End of Time”
7:10 TITAN!!!

This man is the dollar store British version of Mark Rober, but for some reason Liam is better

Why didn't you use flex tape.
1:47
Man be like dam it david made a cardboard lambo whats cooler than a lambo??? 🤣🤣
And me trying to find one box which fits me in it
Protip: If you wanted to calculate if it would sink or not without putting it into the water use the buoyancy formula. The buoyant force makes things float. It equals the volume of water the object is immersed in times the gravitational acceleration times the density of the water. Basically buoyancy force in terms of water=Vqg. If the buoyant force is higher than the weight force of the object in the water it will float. But if the weight force is higher than the buoyancy force the object in the water will sink.
Liam.. cover the holes.. in flex tape. It’s a fool proof plan
Brazilian Youtuber "manual do mundo" did a functional cardboard submarine that can go 4 meters deep in water
fav youtube channel

You should completely tape it
this video was the best i was laughing like hell

There is anYouTuber that spent two years making an actual submarine. He’s channel is called “Manual do Mundo”.
This literally gave me anxiety
3:26 - 3:47 i actually thought liam was gonna die 😂
That video had my heart rate spiking in fear he was gonna drown
Liam: “Im kind of just going for the um..the yolo approach” *meanwhile his hat says polo*
More like a CarboardSinkmachine
Holy shit the quality has improved since a few years ago
Now this is the best example of “ambitious”
We all live in a cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine!
He colonized the pool next ocean
LIAM!! use really strong waterproof ducktape all over  the submarine so then the water can't soak into the cardboard!:)
Is this also a secret ad for hello fresh?
Waiting for a new video

You should learn to Lucid Dream, and then animate it.

Me just sitting here watching Liam fulfill all my dreams…is magnificent!!! good job 10/10
I think I have a good video idea…… ‘Finding Ways to Rick Roll Myself’
Me watching Liam shuffle into the pool: This is the day Liam dies
This guy is probably running out of ideas😂😂
damn i got major claustrophobia seeing liam in the first one
-Liam- Shing hehehehh -me-...
Plz, plz make a part two but this time make blue prints etc.
EPIC
Video Idea: You should try to sleep on a bunch of bubble wrap
nice sound
i always like his videos before even watching, it never disapoints me, or my little brother who absolutely loves your videos lol thanks
what next a carboard car?
Tom Hollands lost brother 🤧
My claustrophobia could never
Me : /goes through my youtube recommendation Me : /sees a video named "i built a cardboard submarine" Me : oh that's intresting, who did it? Me : /looks at the channel name Me : of course, Liam
This guys an absolute idiot but I love him so much 😂😂😂
Total legend subscribe to this man
Question 🙋‍♂️. Why?
You look like an Australian Shane Topp. Amazing video 😂
I wouldn’t have been able to stay in hat box when the water was filling up 💀
day 6 for asking a q&a
U shd do a collab with daniel thrasher, he is a musician but is extremely funny like you, ig you'll would be gr8 in a vid together
Build one out of flex tape😂
Cardboard is Liam’s favourite material.
put some flex seal on it
I found this on monke video
tf would pay 364 pounds for a camera
titanic 2: the revenge of Thomas Andrews
day 5 for asking a q&a
Next up : build a wood submarine and go under water with it because cardboard is to wet use the same things you used and also some wood carving tools idk im not a expert and making and doing stuff okay now take this idea and make money off of it. :D
Same thing lower the cost
Use a huge bucket with a cap it will do better
So I tested my submarine by carrying my sleeping grandpa into my creation on his wheel chair…I don’t know if it worked or not he hasn’t come up yet….
missed you bro.
liam- no funny business me-"laughing"
among-
Just thought of a great idea that is greatly unreachable by me but I thought you were a possible successor. Idea: make a laundry basket into a working car, like the ones we imagined as little kids. I'm not pushing it, but thought it was the type of thing you would like to do. Keep up the great work man!
Dang you have a hello fresh box I see
Ummmmm wow that music is giving me mark rober vibes.
next video he will ride down the stairs in a cardboard box
Yaaay
I’m claustrophobic and can’t swim
My idea? Cover the whole thing in tape.
"I'm going for the YOLO approach" Said Liam, wearing a Polo hat.
7:52
7:47
Can you please make longer videos
Next teach us how to build a cardboard nuke
Oh yeah, it's winter there
If Liam ever went to a job interview this is how it would go: " So, do you have any experience". "No, but I have experience in doing stupid things".
Good to see you keeping productive in lockdown
Flexseel or flex tape?.???
man, buy for ur dog buttons and learn him to talk!
day 4 for asking a q&a
He needs to do it again.... 3rd times the charm!
Iberê vendo isso 🤡
Congrats for using the same music as M. Rober..
editing is just *YES*  You've improved a lot, Liam!!!
youtubers: dont try at home homeless people:
The cardboard boat one was a little extra but this is very crazy a cardboard submarine that’s a little extra as a new one too you should get a world record person and see if it’s a world record😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😁😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😄😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊

Me when my mom buys something in a cardboard box:

Liam Thompson makes a cardboard Coffin for sea burial
You should cover the cardboard in duck tape

I cant stop watching this!!
5:09 He looks like a little gremlin sitting in the box
next time Warp it all in plastic
Sorry, Im going to start uploading more." Said Liam, 5 years ago.
When Liam uses mark rober music:
use flex tape
Pog
Liam lives in a cardboard submarine in a cardboard submarine a cardboard submarine
I would pay good money to get the imagery of liam's wet leg hair out of my brain
Oh no, not Again! 😂😂. He will literally die one day if he does this again, may god save you.
If u used flex tape it would have not flooded
You have inspired me… I wanna do this! That looks so fun
Me: lockdown is getting to you. Him: normal
Epic.
Yes he did
❤️❤️👍🏼
Liam: This could work!...This could work. (proceeds to break the roof of the box)
Use flex seal next time
Famous last words: "how fun would it be to build a submarine out of carboard?"
It seems like Liam and Tom Holland can be best buddies
i feel like this whole video is an ad for insta360
did you know if you swallowed it and it hit the stomach acid it melts/disintegrate  (WOW VOILA)  I'm not a hater I'm subbed I'm just pointing out facts 🤣🤣
Hello! Sorry about commenting late. Anyways, I love your videos Liam. There’s always a banger, keep up the great work!
I do so much Liam does I can relate to the creativity XD
If u say the quality of the camera is bad that is just the graphics of your phone
Liam being Liam
Liam’s Neighbor: Hey why do I screaming from my neighbors pool again? Liam: oh hey I was just making a submarine Liam’s Neighbor: uhh wat? ur making a submarine out of cardboard.. ?????? Liam: yep
Honestly I would just wrap the whole box is clear tape
“Thank you insta360 for sending this camera to me so i can, do stupid stuff” 😂😂
If I was a sponsor I would sponsor all of his videos
Sponser time looks like a mark robber video
Epic
i love your video style and eiting and that i love your vids in general but please try and make them longer thx your by fa my fav yt'er
Since no one else will say it,I’ll do it myself. That submarine is SUS!
1440p is trash lmao
Lol
Can you make a submarine with wood.
i saw the vid and was like, oh god here we go again xd
Liam: Ur probably thinking how I’m gonna get into the water Me: get ur medical supervisor to push u in  Liam: Gets in himself
2 day for asking a q&a
Use that in the Bermuda triangle
you kill me bro😭😭😭😭😭😭
you idiot. i love this.
liam: AAAAAAAAAAAA camera man: hmm, interesting
Alternate title : almost drowning and dieing f or a couple of views!
no wayyy
3:27 titanic colorized
Cover your submarine with water proof spray thingy
this made me so nervous even though i know you lived
This man is a legend. He makes very original videos and is very funny. Keep it up Liam!
I’ve built a few cardboard boats before. Cover every piece of cardboard that’s gonna touch water, in duck tape. Maybe some spray paint.
I swear I LOVE your vids they always make me and my brother laugh =)
Am I the only one going to acknowledge that he used a hello fresh box for the sub?
The thumbnail reminds me of caretaker stage 6 ._.
Yooo me and my friend make short movies I NEED this so I’m a buy it thx for the info Liam!
wow it's an eight minute video, not that I mind
YOU HAVE THE SAME SONG THINGY AS MARK ROBER-
woaah
Do a flip my guy
seems like a good way to die
What if you sprayed it... with water sealant?
His reaction when he got into the pool made me panic cuz i thought he couldnt get out but it turns out he was just cold 😂
1 day for asking a q&a
Nobody:  Liam: Shinggg… hehehehe…😼
Oiii why u stealing Mark’s Music!!! Joking btw ur literally only other person I heard use it.
Let's all get Liam to 2M subscribers! I've done my part.
mark rober is that you?
FLEX TAPE EVERYTHING
Liam made an absolutely unrecognizable thumbnail that even his subscribers can't tell if the video is Liam's or not. I think that's the reason why it isn't having much views. The idea is brilliant but people think its just a random youtuber  Liam, we need your face at the thumbnail!
when his boat sinks and submarine float
submarine do be sus tho
Hey you should do it again but use tape to protect the submarine
i love mark rober's background music
Its funny. Cause there is no cool shot in this Video 👀
now build a wooden one that actually works (=
Next minute he drowns I wouldn't be surprised
Realized that you live in New Zealand I wonder if I could meet Max oh wait lockdown
Hii
Year 2050-  Liam Thompson- Going to outer space with a spacesuit made of thermocol and duct tape!
Great promotion. U grabbed our attention with the cool shots before the ad. So I decided to see the promo. Gud job brotha.
Please make a trying to break really stupid world records part 7
U should teach ur dog how to communicate with you using the button things
Liam's longest video
He should make a normal one that would be cool
🔥🔥🔥🔥
1:48 if you where wondering 1440p is also 4k
I love how you push your vids to the limit and do things that no one else would think of
His neighbor : whose dying
liam's title: i built cardboard submarine me: ofc you did
I forgot it’s winter in New Zealand
Cursed
Anyone remember back when he had 300k? That’s when I subbed. Keep up the great work Liam!!
Some thing about seeing Liam with a knife scares me
If you use a crayon it will make it water proof
Yesss a new video!❤️❤️❤️
Your outro is a hate/love thing bc I love the sound but when I hear it I know something great ended
YouTube not notifying me of the vid until now like:
why does liam look so stupid 3:38
And that was the day Liam Thompson made a card board submarine and drowned to death
WHY DO U USE MARK ROBERS MONTAGE SONG
0:54 pls don't murder us
R.I.P Liam Thompson.  [idkhisbirthyear]-2022  reason: tried making a cardboard cruise and then drowned to death
Day 5 of asking for Carolina reaper challenge
I WISH THESE VIDEOS WERE LONGER they are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Try to make a video like hacksmith. It's a challenge.
It's gonna be cold in northern hemisphere  So it's opposite in south
I have a idea tape the submarine all over with invisible tape like all over.
He tottaly we d8d the titanic
Flex seal and flex tape always works
make more max the dog videos please
Now I understand why there was war sounds coming from inside SpongeBob's imagination box.
HeLlO FrEsH
its  the start of spring why would you do this lol it would be so cold
I am going to die out of cringe
do a video on making an jet pack
We all live in a cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine
Imagine if it won’t break if you want to…      News:

The intro kinda looks like ryan georges
You can do it this is 3 and use flex tape coat the whole thing in Flex tape
3D printed sub

i bet they do this is submarine training
Subnautica Liam edition
lol
This dude will use cardboard to build an empire  one day I swear
Ahh
321
Hello fresh !?,.
i think a cried a little bit watching this video....from laughing
You need flex tape
i have an idea, you could put seran rap around the outside to make it watertight
the only person that i will ever be entertained and have the patience to watch well they get sponsored
I feel like this video will be one that does well in the algorithm
New quote ‘Today will be MY day’
0:54 me: oh sh*t liam bum bam BUMMM
i like that liam is "we" lol
this might be liams stupidest idea yet. i approve
I needed this today it’s been a long day
Liammmmm try again with flex tape/flex seal
why did you not just make a room in the sub and fill it with water so it sinks Liam. THATS HOW REAL SUBS GO UNDERWATER.
Sure, 4 pieces of duct tape will hold a couple hundred pounds under water. My logic is no different
Cool
I was genuinely scared at one point that he wasn’t gonna be able to get out and the fact that nobody stopped him from doing this is mildly concerning. 😂
the things this man does for us what like 3 times week? is awesome dude
His face at 7:04
I love your videos
I love your videos
Dear Liam, please do check out Browney channel. He mentioned you last century in his video, but you haven't responded yet which is awkward and a bit rude. Contact me if you can't find the video (Bring pizza).
Day 4 of asking for a Carolina reaper challenge
Use flex seal!
the hello fresh box lol
This is the moat liam Thompson video title i have ever seen 😂
Me: sees title Oh Fuck…
no one liam: engineers working from home:
Lol hello fresh
Liam gets something new with lot of cardboard: FREE CONTENT
“Don’t try this at home and with no medical supervision” he says as he tries it home by himself
I like how when Liam says not to do this at home. He also says. ”not anywhere else either” Which is good lol
Var det en attack sub?
cover the thing in flex tape
I am  ashamed of myself for not being subscribed...
Carboard + tape + a lot of free time =
Haaaaa
Liam, when are you gonna make merch?
Wow
a recreation of houdini's water torture escape
This is what you get when you watch mister maker 24/7
science also tells us cardboard gets soggy in water
The fact there's air inside the submarine doesn't help... especially because you need that air 👁👄👁
noice
why... just why... you knew this wasnt going to work but thats why I watch you
the frick?
Liam: i loved her like a son Me: huh?
You couldve add breathing straws on top
Why does the US waste millions of dollars on subs and sub r and d when the greatest cheapest most legendary sub is posted on yt?
Me seeing the title oh oh
hey stupid use plastic
4 days ago
5:46 should have used flex tape
He really is the real life version of phinas and ferb
Hey Liam it would Mean the world to me if you gave me a shout out I am also from Auckland New Zealand and I love your videos
Is it just me or did anyone else nearly have a heart attack when he started using the knife *without a protective surface underneath*        His poor carpet     *The poor insurance people*
me in my head: i can not guarantee  it will be a safe and comfortable ride
At 3 minutes it looked like a washing machine
Liam's one of those misunderstood geniuses except that the only reason I don't underestimate is because I have a TINY IMAGINATION AND HIS I HUGE
Why wasn’t this in my sub box
insta 360 is actually a pretty good camera
go on omegle
"papa jake here!"
I actually had to mame a cardboard boat as a project and we had to race I got 3rd or 2nd i think
I saw your hello fresh box I actually happen to have hello fresh too!Are you a fan of it?
The fact that you didn’t drown is a miracle
make a space shuttle out of cardboard
Get a wetsuit to keep warm 😀
Liam: sees Auckland is in level 4 lockdown, "dammit it's gonna be hard filming videos... Eh I'll make a cardboard submarine
Yolo with the polo hat
USE FLEX SILE
hi
liam: getting inside a box and then going under water is a terrible idea… also liam: continues to get inside a box and go underwater 😌👌
And I had a hard time with cardboard boat racing-
Good try bcs I expected more water there
Liam, really good vid but maybe next time cover the sub in flex seal
I am honest when I say I don’t know if he said that he was going for the Yolo approach or the yellow approach. In which case decent song reference
3:33 i actually thought u were a goner for a second but then i saw that the video had like 4 minutes left. phew!
The guys in the beginning look so alike 😧😱
Seeing the cardboard submarine sink was sadder than Titanic :(
Day 3 of asking for Carolina reaper challenge
I can turn water into a deadly weapon.  Liam please try it
amogus.
next time cover everything in hydrophobic powder
Build your own parachute
we all live in a cardboard submarine, a cardboard submarine
Liam is like the person to make our terrible childhood ideas actually work
It's winter, I can't think of a better time for you to do this :D
remember when we tried to make a cardboard boat??  ye, i do  *instant drowning flashbacks*
I thought u we’re gonna drown and we are from the same country
Getting Mark Rober vibes low-key with the music
DO MORE WITH MAXXXX!!!!!!
flex tape sub plz
Cover it in tape to make it “water proof”
Nice job,…
That's a sweet camera
He should have used flex tape and flex spray
Mark Rober music intensefies
Alternate title: i built an underwater torture chamber with cardboard
I thought he died but he didn't
Of course you did 😂
Why didn’t you just wrap the entire thing in duct tape that way it’ll be waterproof?
God bless
Kid: Mom can we get submarine? Mom: No we have submarine at home  The submarine at home:
Hello fresh sales after this video📈📈
flex spray the outside
Get some waterproofing tape and recreate this
The whole of Auckland in level 4 lockdown and Liam is just loving life😂
The news "Man drowns in backyard pool while stuck underwater in homemade cardboard submarine"
Hi
LOL
I saw this video Me: Cool! Cardboard submarine? Sure! Also me: MADE BY LIAM THOMPSON? ABSOLUTELY GREAT!!
This video is sponsored by hello frash
Use flex tope XD🤣
I literally thought the submarine was chest lmao
Dude wrap the cardboard in plastic or tape
"Youtuber drowns in a weighed cardboard submarine".
Didn't need the disclaimer 😂 you uploaded so you didn't drown thank fully.
Yea...acklands level 4 while the rest of new zealand stays in level 3 really has made you go nuts...
The Camera part where you tried to swallow the camera MY THOUGHT WHILE WATCHING: WHEN YOU TRY YOUR BEST AND ITS NOT A SUCSESS🤣
Liam: I've got a whole video to edit Me: I know you're lying, the video has only 30 seconds left
I also live in new zealand and I have tried the submarine. I failed but you were awesome at it. NICE JOB!
Let's join the legitimate science group
Plot twist: Liam has an identical twin and makes us think he has amazing editing when its just his twin.
Boy next time use a avocado box because it is very thick and easy to obtain
I love this but i have design that might properly work but its too long to write
Video idea teach Max to pull Frodo around in like a kart or something
theory for why there is two Liams, they are the left and right hemisphere of the brain
i love watching people suffering
At 7:12 he looks like the pog face and a bird had a baby
He does realize he can water proof it with tape? right?
Who else is getting these recommended to you in 2027
you sound like austin powers when you say yeah baby
my claustrophobia during this video : ,📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📉📉
I'm a big fan of yours and I live in Auckland I really wanna meet you it would be my dream.
Cool
I mean at least he’s not bored in lockdown
you live in the same country as me how is lockdown Liam?
sick
Don’t try it any were try it every were
I was opening a body armor and the quiz add thing it said which do you have a positive thought on...
How to do a sponsored video with the lowest budget, nailed it!
I kinda want that camera
0:56 homie I never noticed how much you look like Tom Hiddleston
Ah yes, the yolo approach.
And then he died
I honestly thought he would die XD
👁     👁              👄
aaa youtube   didn't notified me >:C
5:18 Liam needed a little help from his friend to make a (not yellow) submarine. He has to be making these Beatles references on purpose.
Missed opportunity to say "go 2" our sponsor link.
He said do noT do this without medical supervision. He’s from New Zealand and we are in lockdown right now so….
Ok , what I want to know is how does he have alll that cardboard huh anyone?
7:11   *W h a t .*
3:25 i thought that this will be the end of his journey.
Liam, you look really nice in that yellow jacket 🤭
Liam's chuckle after he opened the Stanley knife was concerning
try seeing through fish vison
Max is what the hell is wrong with this guy 😂😂😂
7:04 i’m making that into a whatsapp sticker
Liam hasn’t hasn’t been seen since
the noise is the best tho "huuuw oOoO yeh baby" 4:31
"Aaah my poor submarine. My poor submarine. I loved you like a son."
Let’s give this guy some credit he knows we want to see him suffer and he does it like a man
Rhe Hello Fresh box tho!!!!!
Use flex seal
That thumbnail looks like a sick album cover
ummmmm cardboard car next?
You can build evrithing whit cardboard
Submarine? Looks more like a sinking ship (attempt 1)
Do a part two and use flex seal
Cameras like £250
omg this guide tryna be walmart mark rober
Just put water proof spray on it it will be easer
In my senior year of high school, our physics class split into groups of 3 and each group had to build a functional boat out of plywood.  We had similar results.
*very epic*
I don't trust you with a knife.
getting in a box, and sinking under water, while its slowly filling up with water is my worst nightmare
Post more ur great
Could've sprayed it with waterproof can spray
your video production keeps getting better and better!! keep creating liam :)
You should’ve just covered the whole thing in flex tape
Who else felt claustrophobic when he went in the box in the pool?
spray it with water repellent
Is this the guy from 🧡⚫️?
Day 2 for asking for Carolina reaper challenge
1. Liam is cute 2. Guy is artistic af 3. He is cute
hmm. wait does it work uf you put flextape and cover all the cardboard up ang have like a window
Yay
More!
Liams vids never fail to make me laugh
Great content 👍✌️
Was watching subnautica videos when got uploaded
That's a STRONG submarine. You could've used polycarbonate, and steel, but you chose cardboard?! People are going to explore the whole ocean with this, I swear.
Hello Liam I'm sick of your videos Can you do more questions and answers? Where you live in your pool all the time the water is frozen it's pretty weird I've seen all of your videos 1000 times Thank you very much hope you upload another video soon
These vids are always so good ngl i love them keep it up
You should’ve made a frame out of pvc pipes and cover the entire thing with duck tape
Alternative title: man almost dies when cardboard submarine fails
Wh don’t you just wrap it?
OLYMPIC submarine
Whatbis this
Liam Thompson
didnt ask for ur scam sponser
Hello
imagine breaking into his house and seeing this happening through the back window
Your vids. Are getting kinda repetative
I love the anti-copyright version of monster's inc theme at 2:47 XD
Hi
“This video is sponsored by staples”
So he still hasn’t learned: cardboard + water: disaster :0
cardboard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Can you upload more tricks with Max
It’s all fun and games until Liam gets on the news for being the man drowned in a cardboard box in his backyard pool.
To prevent leaking through the window, use duct tap or flex seal to prevent water from going through. Also, to soak up any water that might leak through the hull, have two floors. The bottom one should contain a sponge or two, and the top one (reinforced heavily) will be where you sit at, with a drain at the sides.
Your stupid.............................. and I like it! We can be friends
Nice memes
it is my birthday
I doubt this will get pinned
Yo liam how did you get your outro song? I’m a fan
Liam is the one guy who does it for the people
Your gonna drown your self
HILARIOUS!  Literally best video ever!
I mean there’s at least one advantage of this cardboard submarine...     You’ll know very quickly when you reach unsafe depths.
He he he he
“The captain must go down with his ship!” **proceeds to escape submarine and not go down with the ship**
2:05 who else had anxiety when he did that?!
woah       So no one spoils things
Make these videos longer
nobody’s gonna talk about that he used a hello fresh box in his first try lol
Not the home Depot building music😂
its cool to see how much his editing is improving!
Yes FINALY, a new video
Its not trying it at home if i do it in a community pool!
2:52 at this moment I was laughing af
You should wrap it in plastic wrap
7:04 he looks like gru 😂 great video
LIAM you need to cover it ALL in water proof tape so no water would get in
You should be sponsored by cardboard
The sponsor made me want a insta360 go 2 even more
Watched this with my cat. She stayed awake and very much interested the whole time, and even purred occasionally. This video is cat approved.
Day 41 of asking Liam to eat a dog biscuit
Liam: "please don't try this at home." Me: okay but I can try this in the ocean right? The sea? River? Lake!? 😂😂
Just use flex tape mate🌝😂
His editing is so much better recently. 👍🏻
3:51  Liam: my submarine, my poor submarine... I loved you like a son! My brain, auto finishing: a sonmarine? 😄
Sub to destroyer
Fuck I get so excited when I see a new upload. Yewww!!!!
this gave me so much anxiety as it being my biggest bear
Elavator,Boat,Rollercoaster and Submarine Better make a country now!
maybe once im an official welder we can make a ghetto submarine ;)
Liam is the stupidest guy in the world and I LOVE IT!!
Do a video where you teach your dog max to chill out
Didn’t think that it would work well, well done for that... I couldn’t do that (why did I even say that)
Liam I am only a kid and have been subscribed for a LOOOOONG time all your vids are great mate keep the good work up you are definitely my favourite youtuber👍🏻
I was looking into a getting a camera I am gonna start researching this camera.
*MONTAGE THOMPSON*
ayo do u still play pool with ur eyes behind ur back? 👀
Use neverwet on the cardboard
Once upon a time I let my cat inside. We had gone to Volcano Bay the day before so our minds were on water slides. Then my little brother said, “What if we made a roller coaster for cats!”. I then thought, “LIAM THOMPSON CAN DO IT!”. I’m counting on you to make an amazing roller coaster for Frodo. I believe in you! ❤️
Anyone else just start imagining scenarios where he could end up drowning? Got so nervous watching this video
Originally i thought it was a cardboard thing with a tin can
me just be like how did he not die?
the giggle after the rhyming sent me 🤧
Liam is a master of Recycling
Liam: gets a new idea  Liam to his backyard: 0:56
Cover it with Lynex tape. You might die but what a great video it will be😝
The neighbors…
pewdz camera is prob worse than this little dude
XDDDDDDDDDDD
Here's a random challenge for you Liam,  Incase you didn't know, New Zealand has 10 verses to our national anthem. 5 in Maori and 5 in English. I challenge you to learn and memorize all 10 verses. I just want to test your memory skills and see your singing abilities (which I already know will be epic). You probably won't see this or attempt this so this whole comment is a huge waste of time, but you've wasted a lot longer time doing crap, so I will know how you feel.  As a proud kiwi I want to see this happen
Make a life size cardboard vending machine
Learn from Papa Jake 😂
well. I found the solution, if you had put that tape all around the cardboard submarine then it wouldn't have leaked because of the plastic covering over that tape.  I'm a genius 😎
This submarine was sponsored by hello fresh
Stop slacking you post like once per 2 weeks
Only legends will know Troy and Abed thought of this first
I’m wondering why Liam didn’t seal all the cardboard with clear tape so it’s waterproofing .
sheesh ur longest vid.... MAKE LONGER VIDEOS AND UPLOAD MORE YOU ARE ENTERTAINING !!!
Who gave this guy a pool?
0:56 mum can we go home now
its the end of winter!!!!
6:56 thought 😂
0:56 The New Generations Serial Killer
Pro tip: COVER THE WHOLE CARDBOARD WITH DUCTAPE SO THE CARDBOARD DOESNT TEAR APART 😂😂
Me how also my brain 😐
Liam plz upload more videos i love them
Where did you buy max from
I never get ads on your videos so I'm very happy you have a sponser
Did Liam get more good looking in this video?  No offence to old video Liam.
Is it just me or does it look like there is a really distorted face squished up against the plastic trying to scream?
Cool
not a video I expected but a video I needed
10/10 montages XD
His editing skills are improving which deserves more than 2 mill so "sus"cribe you knuckle heads
Oh so you knew cardboard floats but didn’t knew it soaks water too? 😂😂
Cool video can you please teach Max some new tricks again please.
https://youtu.be/__CBZfIm-EM
Me oh that looks cool let’s check it out 400$😳
you should wrap it in cling wrap or something, waterproooooof
I was gonna buy that camera thing but uhh   It’s 360 dollars
Liam don’t try it at home   Me he never said don’t try it anywhere else   Liam don’t try it any where  Me……..
So cool
make videoslonger
Next I want a cardboard water park
Amazing video and please do a part 2 and if you do one you can use water proof spray and 8t might help but idk if it will sink!
Nice editing
The dislikes are people who are jealous
Why is entertaining
I wonder if liam has ever gotten stuck doing something like this and had to call his neighbors
Ayy he finally posted let’s goooo :D
you should have used Flex Tape bro that stuff is LITERALLY waterproof
*we all live in a cardboard submarine*
“Hey May? Our neighbor just jumped in his pool with a bunch of cardboard again.. Are you sure he’s okay?” “I’m sure he’s fine hon..” - Liam’s neighbor’s, probably.
This video has one of those sponsors i don’t skip. It’s pretty cool, actually.
This guy literally brings our childhood dreams to life
Either that’s AMAZING editing, OR that’s legit *0:05*
He needed some flex tape
Who else only watches his videos just to see his dog
4:13 Ha good one Liam!
Pls make a plastics one
3:29 - 3:44   The Titanic in 15 seconds.
U need flex tape
U forgot to use flex tape
I love watching your editing gradually get better and better
You should wrap it in bubble wrap.
You deserve way more subscribers.
Yur on trending boi
LADS HE SAID POUNDS INSTEAD OF KILOS MY AMERICAN SELF IS SO PROUD
Liam's next video: i went to the moon with a cardboard rocket ship that i built
been waiting for a new vid ive binged like all your vids in like 3 weeks
Y e s
It was at that moment he nipped he f up
Something about Liam randomly fading in with a suit and an awkward smile makes me laugh really hard
Did anyone else see the thumbnail and say “what am I looking at?”
Hmmm, that cardboard submarine be looking *sus* tho...
A sponsor for an actually good product wow
3:43 looks like that one scene from the movie  tangled.
Amazing!
Imagine his neighbors watching him do this
The more leak-proof you make your vessel, the more likely it's gonna serve as your coffin when it either fills with water or you run out of air :/ what was the idea?
Ngl I kinda want that insta 360 camera
Can you make a spoon that works like a straw?
THATS A LOTTA DAMAGE Let’s use flex tape
the way he says i don’t know    is awesome
At 3:52 did he say, I loved HER like a son!?!?
Wow for the first time I watched the ad and I am invested. I wanna buy that lol
I bet the sponsee is hello fresh
The insta360 is so good but its expensive id wanna buy it but im broke lol
i think now i have a water phobia, omg im scared watching Liam inside that 'submarine' and then the water's come.
Liam is one of a kind He put himself at risk to entertain his fanbase Keep it up liam
I was thinking about u earlier
Your videos are so weird……       I       L    O    V    E    I     T
0:
8 minutes Liam Thompson video. Thumbnail is good. Title is intriging. It's from Liam Thompson. It's a new upload.  What can we conclude? THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE THE BEST VIDEO EVER
why  not try making your watercraft out of "waterproof" material..  see if you can create a legit Submarine from a really large plastic storage container or two?
Yah bro!
Though
how to be Liam: step 1: think of a terrible idea  step 2: do it
great vid
Liam Tells us not to do it\ Also Liam LETS DO IT
1:24 lookin kinda sus huh?
It's always great to see Tom Holland on Screen
So far I'm at 3:20 and I have to ask...am I watching Liam commit suicide? I DONT SEE AN EXIT
Use flex tape next time
How do u find your music
He didn't even use flex tape!
At this point I feel like Liam has the potential of being real life Tony Stark
Mark Rober music????? Tbh it actually works well.
got excited when i saw a sponsor     *got disappointed when i saw it was nearly 400 dollars*
Best solo entertainer
This felt so scary
Liam Thompson: Sponsor time  Mark Rober: Use my music
Put a nuke in there you can be a superpower.
I love how he said 'no funny business' when he's literally building a submarine out of cardboard.
Dude idk why but u exhales Peter Parker (Tom Holland) vibes
Every video is an anti clickbait vlog lol
Next time use silver tape on alllllllll the flufing cardboard
Day 15 of asking Liam to make a song
I thought the thumbnail was his face being smushed against the submarine window 😭
You should try *the great stuff* to fix up the cracks.
t t t should have used flex tape
OMG ANOTHER UPLOAD! Liam, im big fan due to your spot on editing, sarcasm, and silliness. To think, about 18 hours ago you were sitting in drenched cardboard and editing a video. I’ve been a fan for a long time. Keep up the good work!
lol
This dude is living his living his life to the fullest
Liam : YOLO  Liam's hat : POLO
This guy is so sad lol
Liam: never do this without supervision (liam being alone in his house)
I feel like im rewatching madagascar when alex was a kid in the box, and later an adult with the other guys, each one in a box floating in the water
hi
You should teach your dog Morse code so he can talk to you
You need to wrap it in tape to waterproof it
This is a claustrophobic's nightmare
Titanic : footage of a young man drowning(colorized)
Seal it with flex tape next time
Hi Liam I love your videos keep up the good work man 👍👍
Why does it feel like he is going to make a cardboard hang glider next
Yooooooo, the sponsor just got me thinking, your like, the same channel  as Half-Asleep Chris….. and you both got the same sponsor
Why was that Stanley knife so big, it was the size of a banana 🍌
He is going to drown himself one day
Please make more videos
Just before the video started I got a gopro advert 😅
Love your stupid ideas :)
I first thought it was just clickbate garbage! But the video has proven me wrong! Thank you for being an honest youtuber!
You know it’s serious when you hear Mark Rober music
“You have one wish.what is it?” For Liam to post awesome videos more
How to drown 101
What were you thinking
You know, Dylan Ares made a waterproof boat using a spray on foam sealant. Perhaps you could try something like that!
How the titanic actually sunk:
The editing in this is 10/10!!
"It's so small I could swallow it whole!" 10/10 salesman bro
hello am early
the lahf he has after oping the nife is tarifing and fuuny at the same time
Make your videos longer pls
Total Genius I say!
you know it becomes serious when there are the " do not try this at home" disclaimers.
this is crazy 😭 his video ideas are so unique
Just out of curiosity, do the brand know what video you’re doing before offering you the deal ? Because I’d love to have seen their reaction when the email pops up, “What am I gonna do you say ? Well I have a shit tonne of cardboard sooooooo”
I legitimately wonder if you were to coat one with flex seal, it may be waterproof and more durable
he could have fucking died
Day 1 of asking for Carolina reaper challenge
🎶we all live in a cardboard submarine🎶
“ *Shing* hehehehehe” Liam is a psychopath, I’m telling you
CORRE IBERÊÊÊÊ
Imagine if this did work! It’s pretty much just putting paper in water! Great video!
Liam, Liam, Liam... please don't accidentally drown yourself.
For a second I thought Liam had a friend
I laughed until i was out of breath
My boy Liam just built 2 cardboard boxes out of cardboard boxes 😂
Your video are really entertaining and I luv em
And His hair
I wish Liam Thompson would be my uncle so I could test the things he make
I like his smile
You could of drowned… WHEEE WOULD THE VIDEOS BE
3:48 oh my poor submarine my poor submarine I loved you like a son
Next,I built a cardboard rocket and fly in air
3:50  Me: IS THAT ALL!?
sad that he dround
the medallion idea thing is literally so amazing though how has nobody done that before thats so so cool
yooo my man got a sponsor
Liam you are the most amazing youtuber ever!!!
Waiting for it
When he uses the Mark Rober music for his sponsor, combined with his suit, *I HAVE TO WATCH IT*
that is stupid! you could  die from limited oxygen or from drowning
Should’ve used flex tape
This just makes my day a million times more ePiC
My anxiety was through the roof when he was in the first “submarine “ I’m like Liam is really out here trying to kill himself 😂
You know he's serious when his video is over 5 minutes
In the town where I was born Lived a man who sailed to sea And he told us of his life In the land of submarines So we sailed on to the sun 'Til we found a sea of green And we lived beneath the waves In our cardboard submarine We all live in a cardboard submarine cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine We all live in a cardboard submarine cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine And our friends are all aboard Many more of them live next door And the band begins to play We all live in a cardboard submarine cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine We all live in a cardboard submarine cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine Full steam ahead, Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant (Cut the cable, drop the cable) Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye Captain, captain As we live a life of ease Every one of us (every one of us) Has all we need (has all we need) Sky of blue (sky of blue) And sea of green (sea of green) In our cardboard (in our cardboard) Submarine (submarine, aha) We all live in a cardboard submarine A cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine We all live in a cardboard submarine A cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine We all live in a cardboard submarine cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine We all live in a cardboard submarine cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine
Try FlexSeal.
The thumbnail really reminds me of the covers for Everywhere at the End of Time
Wow great liam 😊
Liam, this is absurd. I love it.
wait how is the cardboard not getting wet  SYSTEM ERROR
This really had titanic vibes lol
One day there will be a Netflix documentary about Liam and his creations  *”Inside the mind of a genius”* Reviews: *Epic*
Me getting this in my reccomdations : OMG I NEED TO WATCH me realizing this was a liam Thomson video posted like half a day ago: no wonder XD
Wow so close to 2 mill i remember watching you at like 62 k subs
same
Someone give this man a 3d printer
Unus Annus flashbacks
Was I the only one who literally had a panic moment every time he went under and though he would be able to get out and then realized he uploaded the video so he was obviously ok? 😂
I DON"T TRUST LAIM ANYMORE< DON"T GIVE HIM THE KNIFE
Omg. Amazing. Very funny!
hi
Don’t worry liam, submarines are supposed to sink
*ok*
*17.410*
*149.918*
*74*
*1.920*
What do I say to get likes?
And by insta 360 but secretly by hello fresh
Sponsored by hello fresh
Camera very affordable and Best use for by far. I watch many Youtubers like at least 30 and you’re like number five or one yeah it’s more accurate
yo liam on ur YouTube logo I see a girl who is she is she another person who does weird things like u?
Eight minute videos seem to be becoming a habit... what happened to five????
You should try to put flex tape around the sub   Just know that this comment was written near the start of the video
This man has never made a video that haven't immediately wanted to watch.
What if Jazzy Anne and Liam collabed
Liam pls reply and i got a question. How do you come up with these creative ideas?
Liam: uploads Everyone: watches Liam after everyone watches: what did you think? Everyone after watching Liam’s video: it’s bad.                      But it’s so bad it’s good
Make a helicopter next?
Legend
I can't believe I haven't leaked yet tho...- Liam Thompson 2021
That was so cool
You should try again but use a big plastic trash bin instead.
We all live in the yellow sumbmarine
Mark rober might not be very happy
Hint next time you do something with cardboard and water cover the whole thing in duck tape so the cardboard dosent get as wet
Alternative title: box + Liam = submarine
Next time you should buy some waterproof spray
This is the titanic 2.0 (but in a pool with cardboard small) (and a submarine) edit- u survived the titanic 2.0
I like the knife cam
Is he TRYING to kill himself?
7:04  Liam The Long Nose Builder.
Liam: Without proper medical supervision, please do not try this at home (or anywhere)  Also Liam: Proceeds to do so without proper medical supervision  Everyone: *smort*
first thing i said when i saw this was ' liam thompson you abselute madman "
hm. strange
Everyone gangster till he green screens his own living room
Been watching too mich papa jake
Liam: ...And i will see you very very soon! Also liam: * posts like three weeks later *
When you have no friends to film with.
YAY!!!
✨ future of transport✨
Do a wood dive bell

TITANIC
e a r l y
Girl:He didn't even cry during titanic I bet boys have no feelings Boys: 3:13   6:48
Now do airplane ✈
smart
we want part 2
I thought it was gonna rip but then it was great and I love ur vids, 100/100 for the vid
This guy really needs to be pres
You need to spray it all in Flex seal
SICK
Yes The best building material, cardboard
Card bored ooooooo fun
I've been subscribed to you for a year now and I was thinking maybe you can try teaching max to play tic-tac-toe
You make it really easy for someone to make a "Liam Thompson but he's severely out of context" video
The add: and its all so water proof  ✨Yeets it in the water✨
Your contents awesome, most youtubers just react to vids and although some are really funny your like a legit fun engineer with original content
Liam: "I'm going for the yolo approach" Liam's hat: Sike Biatch, here's Polo <3
Looks like the drowning scenes from movies
the dedication
You should make a bubble wrap house :)))
Try Styroboard next!
He could of drowned!
use flex tape
*Liam in 4 years* : Hi guys, so today I’m going to be trying to hit Mach 20 in this plane I built out of duct tape and cardboard…….
Lol continue doing these fun vids and this was a really noice vid so thx now i need to go and sub bye
You should of used flex tape
7:05 was the funniest point to stop the video and talk lmao
i.love.you.liam,your.content.is.so.good💛💛💛💛✨✨✨✨
My thoughts throughout the whole video: you need o x y g e n     edit: i feel like some people may misunderstand this so basically what i mean is that if there's no leaks, there's no holes, and if he's below the water, that means no oxygen
You need so cover it in flex tape
3:40 liam thought "Why am I doing this"  but the vid was great
Omg,finally,new episode
Love the vid
"I loved u like a son" PLZ
Hey guys anyone know what the music in the sponsor segment is? If you do, tell me what it is please, it sounds good
This was like the titan. But better
liam ur arms look muscular, nice gains..!
2 weeks later i built a Car out of cardoard
wow papa Jake has nothing on this!
I was expecting something very very very dumb,      was not dissapointed
a tip from someone who won a cardboard boat competition: cover the entire thing in duct tape. duct tape is water proof, cardboard is not
My brain: NO
WE ALL LIVE IN A CARDBOARD SUBMARINE. A CARDBOARD SUBMARINE. A CARDBOARD SUBMARINE.
your boar was a submarine
Liam Cries We Laugh He Drown We Cry
Are we just going to ignore those tan lines??
Everyone else: 🎶“we all live in a yellow submarine “🎶  Liam:🎶 “I’m going to live in a cardboard submarine”🎶
This is possibly the coolest dumb idea ever
You are missing one thing, and that, is simply pressure.
During the sponsor he got the mark rober music lmao
if you just duct tape the whole cardboard, it might not sink
ok so from reading the title I am expecting this will be the last video from Liam Thompson, rest in peace
are you stupıd you were so cloes to deaf man lıam you sold not do thıs any more or ı say you are  stupıd
"I was out of cardboard, duct tape and *IDEAS"*  impossible-
You can put ducktape on The cardbord to not wet
You should spray the whole thing with flex seal
Imagine this from my perspective I have a Closter phobia and I'm scared of water 👁👌
i was honestly impressed on how he didn’t drown
if I trick you pin  Read more
nice totally works
video 2 of asking for another video with max
Liam….you ROCk!
I really wanted the cam to be honest but the price though
If anyone watching knows Markrober he uses one of his songs that he always uses
Alternate title:  *New Zealand man tries to kill himself in a soggy cardboard washing machine*
I am shocked! Liam didn't use flex tape in this video!
He gave us the best POV EVER POSSIBLE 😶 💥👄💥
you havent posted for 2 months BRO :(
this video is basically a tutorial about how to waste your time just to die
alternate title:   *New Zealand man tries to kill himself in a soggy cardboard submarine*
alternate title:  *New Zealand man still has no idea cardboard isn't waterproof*
Iberê tá realmente atrasado
Your videos are best
FINNALY a sponsor that is handy
I guess Liam and Liam are idiots
a submarine is a sunken ship lol 🤣
Use flex tape
The submarine kinda looks familiar...
Liam, 50 years in the future:  *hey kiddo, want to see a picture of me when I was young like you?*  Grandson: *I guess*  *shows him this*  Grandson: *BRUUUUUUUUUUUH*
Liam your stupid in a good way xD
Anyone else recognise the mark rober music in the background
alternate title:  *New Zealand man tries and fails to kill himself in a small cardboard box*
do a collaboration with 'I did a thing'
7:16 look behind sales man liam and look at the real liam lol
Next vid : I made a cardboard airplane and made Max fly it
Someone recommended camera to PewDiePie.
He sees holes and still try’s it lol 😂😂😂
Yes
do a part two
and then you had to get all the weights out of the pool? sounds difficult.
U need flex tape for *NO LEAKS*.
Did I just watch someone sponsor a video of Liam literally get in to a pool in a box ? XDDDDD But still I loved it XDDDDD And I was still in my head sure that this is a submarine XDDDDD
I was waiting for your video
Youtuber drowns inside cardboard box in pool
who else was waiting for him to jump on at the end
The fact Liam did this in winter (I think, I’m in north hemisphere so idk) is hilarious
well all live in a drowning cardboard submarine  cardboard submarine, cardboard submarine
Liam is definitely the neighbor in Year 3000 that has a flux capacitor
You dont even need to skip a second watching his videos 🤣🤣 But I do wanna see him build a legit submarine 😬
It was the hehehehe after opening the cutter for me though
Use Flex seal
You already knows it’s a good video if it’s by Liam
Now he should ACTUALLY try to get to the bottom of the pool with something better that’s not cardboard
Liam : Second Time The Charm! Me :😂😂😂
I've had my eye on the insta 360 go 2 for a while I might eventually buy it.
Liam’s grandkids will have to believe his stories after they’re shown this
Me: he is like a man baby Liam with a knife: SHINGGGGGG HEHEHEHEHEHE
I love the montage Liam
Nice accent
I love how he used scotch tape and not duct tape or really just anything other than SCOTCH tape that really just shows he really doesn’t know what he’s doing.
We like liam
0:53 shheeeeeeshhh
Liam needs to make the boat again and cover it in Flex seal!!!!!! That would be so fun and cool to watch!!
Next vid of Liam Thompson: I built the world with cardboard
It’s all fun and games until the duck tape doesn’t brake
i want to go into the Marianas trench in that
"OHMYGOD OHHH MY GOD IT'S FREEZING HOOO" "...it's actually not that cold"
Been here since 100k
It can even fit on a cat's collar
the submarines look like amogus characters
Anything you do hilarious
Even wearing a cardboard shirt
I have an idea u should cover ur cardboard submarine with flextape and add a pipe hole on the top so u can breathe i hope u see my comment Liam 😀😀😀
Nobody :  Liam :  **sleeping on_**____**** **building__un my back yard** **making a cardboard___**
his face on the right side at 7:11🤣🤣🤣🤣
The answer: more duck tape, solves everything
Alternate ending: man drowns in a cardboard box in his pool
Yes.
Am I the only one who gets motivated by Liam?
Finnaly new vid is released ive been waiting xD
I saw the title of this video and thought there can only be one guy who this could be and yup its liam thompson
Floated better than your boat
Its so long since u posted a video
read the title before i checked who uploaded and i immediately knew it was liam..
Dummest video yet
2:28 ad ends
7:10 that face
You should’ve flex sealed it with the spray so it would’ve been waterprooof
Absolute madlad
Liam- has a paid sponsor  Hello fresh- peasant
Welp… that was short lived 😂
I am going to be real I wouldn't trust you with my life even if you had that knife
Honestly, you're the only YouTuber of which I actually watch the sponsor part. 😂😎  3:11 DUDE!!!, I'd be scared!!! 😵😵
0:09 When you have no friends
We will never see the day where Liam realises cardboard absorbs water.   But tbh I’m fine with it
Did you use a FLEX tape ? 🤔
next build a cardboard airplane and jump off a building with it
2:21 ALSO IT"S VERY DURABLE SO NO WORRIES ;)
hello fresh
eyo that montage tho was good lmfao you should do more montages like that lol
Sheesh I thought it would just not do anything but great job you're really entertaining and I found your channel a few days ago and have been binge watching it since! Also when you had the billboard for your hate comments, I saw it irl! Edit: How does he have so much cardboard!?
Liam's Thompson videos in the next 15 years : making big mansion. using cardboard
Him: How am I supposed to get in the water? Me: Have someone help you Him: *bangs on cardboard repedatley*
Sus box
The fact that you wore a suit for the sponsor is golden. 🤣
Among us
Great way to drown
*E P I C*
Liam: it would be stupid to make anything like that card board boat  Other Liam: Yh heheehhe HEHEHEHAHAHAHA  Liam: let’s make a card board submarine :>
ok, i havent watched a single second of this video and im already gonna say. how the heck is this thing gonna not crumple up and suffocate him
Imagine being his parents, coming home, and seeing him in a cardboard box in the pool
hear me out liam... a whole video dedicated to flex seal
Liam is the only person in the world who laughs while he is stuck in a cardboard box, on his pool, sinking......
I started laughing as soon as i clicked in the video
Yikes lockdown is really getting to him
This is awesome. He actually did it! I am amazed!
YOOOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥  BEST VID
Finally, a video from Liam meh boi
I’m glad he survived, must’ve been tough in the navy
tf did i just see
“Sunken ship”
Now fly with it
True genius
Me - “Liam how are you going to get into the water though”  Liam - “Now you are probably thinking… Liam how are you actually going to get into the water”   Next video should be I became a psychic for a day or something
this is how they escape in money heist
Why do the submarines look like washing machines…
Cover the whole thing with flextape xD
POV: you played subnautica once
Love u bro
Try spraying it with flex seal so it actually works
Liam: We have minor leakage. Me: That's fine because submarines go underwater
How are you going back up in the submarine
My guy really went in without an oxygen supply
No one:  This guy: having a conversation with himself
The submarine  *Sponsored by hello fresh*
almost died
This video has really sunk my mood
Another video
LLLLEEEEETTTSSS GO
The problem with the cardboard boat was that it didn't float. Build a submarine,  no problem
3:17 POV alex the lion on his way to Madagascar
7:04 that face in the background tho 😂
Lol I would be terrified doing this
Am I the only one who wants to be this man? 10/10 btw :>
I think it should be yellow. It wouldn't leak then and you could live in it. Pretty sure.
I saw the thumb nail and thought this is the day Liam dies
My friend said she ding dong ditched you lol
In a few years: I built a working hoverboard using toilet paper
You should make another (better) cardboard boat
The cardboard was from the packaging of the camera apperntly 🤣
Do it agean please
Liam, love the fun intros, keep it up
Next video: Making a clingwrap boat and trying to walk on water.
Scientificly how did u breathed in there? The air ventilation is very small in water so u could use the goggles with the stickvthingy where u can breath through even though the pipe is small u can take a bigger one and bring the pipe out and then ur can breathe. :)
Yo! Once I saw the first version of  the LTsubmarine I had no faith,  BUT the LTsubmarine v2 is LIT 10/10 ❤️ nice job Liam
You should build an actual rocket ship with your engineering skills, I'd say you're allowed to use metal though lol
my dude cut a box just to build it back to a box
How can you come up with these ideas man. Like your content is lit! Keep coming up with these cool ideas man ❤️
w h y
Wheres the strongest tape???? The one that you used to stuck onto wall
Of course, good old hello fresh…
Liam’s channel is the example of: “image if….”
why from water go deeper when you could go on land with a cardboard car?
Literally seeing liam Almost Drown
A good day topped off with Liam posting. Great vids!!!
Everyone we need anything thing to push a submarine into water Liam yes but not  actually
cardboard car lol
Mrbeast on a budget
Liam the cardboard handyman is back.
4:23 same Liam same
Can’t tell if he’s a genius or a moron
Was I the only one who expected the video to be sponsored by “hello fresh” because of the cardboard box shown? haha
Liam: oh ya and it's waterproof  Me: we know you almost swalled it whole
Great vid Liam as al ways
Me as a kid lets build a submarine! Parents: Thats not possible! Liam:WhAt DiD YoU JuSt SaY?!
RIP Laim Thompson
Wow, this camera is actually pretty cheap, and aperantly pretty good :o
i was so anxious seeing the water leak in the cardboard. i seriously thought he'll drown or something 😭
im sold.. i have to get that camera
Wow great video
You should have completely covered every square inch with flex tape 😔  r.i.p. The submarine.
Good job not drowning
You should use flex tape
“Legitament” Science
But weights un with u
That one kid that takes science to seriously:
3:39 I was genuinely scared for him.
7:52 - OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
the neighbours-Honey I think i see a child drowning
2:23 when you forget your dance routine  on dance moms
Make it out of tin foil
Try again with glad wrap all over the outside so the cardboard is more sturdy
which editing software does he use, if anyone knows please reply :)
why does the submarine look like a washing machine lol
Today we are going to be drowning .
Liam's Brain Inc.
I liked how he is soo stupid🙉
Liam: remember when we tried to make a cardbored boat? *Has flashbacks* Almost drowned
no matter how much he did boat , he never learn that CARDBORD + WATER = SICK   at least cover with plastic broo
Just put flex tape all over the cardboard
Dude i thought you die
NOOO YOU CANT JUST A BUILD A SUBMARINE OUT OF CARDBOARD
Can I have some cardboard please?
Only Liam would use a green screen to create a background of his own living room.
Hire a camera person
This reminds me of that song that goes”we all live in a cardboard submarine” by the beetles   Wait it does go like that right…right
when I first found Liams channel I thought he was a girl tiktok boy……     yeah umm I was wrong
whats ur editer app
shuda used flex tape
FINNALY A VIDEO I LOVE YOU <3
Top 2 sad movies number one titanic number two submarines fail
damn, Snake would buy this immediately
Dude I thought you wre gonna die in that submarine 😂 😂 😂 😂
Imagine if he had the cardboard and ductape to do his ideas.. *futuristic flying cars, chrome buildings, world hunger solved*
Are u mccreamy cause ur voice is so same
I don’t have anything funny to say I just want to comment something so the video gets recommended more lol
Oh my go- blubblubblub
Hi Liam how’s lockdown in Auckland
0:55 "Shing!" 😄
liam is literally the Phineas of real life
Pls more max max max max max max max max let’s go max let’s go max max max max
Liam can you send me a tips for start YouTube channel
so this is what he dose in level 4 lock down
I love the fact that he says he's going for the yolo approach and his hat says polo
0:54 Liam is the Imposter! 🤯
If he was American he'd be hired by Elon Musk. That creative mind might be able to build something awesome with the right things.
I was scared for you to be stucked inside  it while in the water
The amount of anxiety I experienced while  I imagined Liam trying to break out of the submarine to get out is very very high😂
Not me thinking it was a cigarette box😂
Seeing Liam suffer is just so much fun.
Absolute sickness Liam! Keep up the great work!!
After watching Liam whenever I see something that I think is cool I always think of Liam saying dude that’s sick in his accent
Scientists discovering Antarctica like... 7:46
They say the weight is still at the bottom to this day
Sick submarine Liam
almost as epic as mycat
Ebic
Bruh that chin shot at the end my man looks like zlatan Ibrahimavich
Nothing like a good montage , am i right?
One day Liam is gonna save the world with cardboard
why not put a layer of scotchtape or anything like candle idk
Army's : we built the sorrow best submarine! Everyone: no  Liam: I bUiLt A cArDbOaRd SUBMarinE!1 Everyone: yes
The Sponser Camera : Can Film in 1440p Quality  Me (watching at 360p Quality) : Hmm yess very HD and clear quality i will definately buy one :D
everytime liam posts, i like the vid because i know its gonna be crazy
Here we go again
Liam after seeing how much views fails videos get
At this point if Liam can’t do it nobody can   Btw at 7:10 liams face in the background looked like Gru from despicable me
Okay honestly if some disaster struck ,i am gonna first run to Liam Thompson..He will definitely come up with something, i have to survive
Is it just me or is he the most American guy in New Zealand
Next video: I made a cardboard plane
I’m glad his videos have got longer, they were too short before!
New video  idea: building boat out of lays chips to prove that its nothing but air
Why did you just covered the submarine in plastic cause plastic is water proof or just use flex tape its water proof bruh  Also lovely video
:)
He almost drowned
I just had a feeling that he was gonna say after his montage ‘wow that was a good montage’ haha 😂😂😂
Cool
That thumbnail is pure nightmare fuel
Pls
Can you make more videos
He makes  a cardboard box look cool
He does realise cardboard is NOT waterproof
Why are you doing this in winter? I am in australia so I am pretty sure that new Zealand is is winter too.
I got SO much anxiety when the water started filling up his submarine and he went under
Funny Liam: remember when we built that terrible boat? Sensible Liam: yeah, what about it Funny Liam: how about we do that again Sensible Liam: HECK NO THAT WOULD…. Funny Liam:shush………..CONTENT Sensible Liam: fine…. 6 hours later Sensible Liam: WHY DO I ALWAYS AGREE WITH YOU!!??
YES YOUR BACK
Pin me pls
This is the longest liam video ive seen
Pog
here before 50k
i was so worried the whole video that he'd drown id never do that if i ever ever get a pool
I get Mark Rober vibes from this video
He went shining and laughed Iike a crazy killer🤣
Liam: "I Built a Cardboard Submarine"       Everyone: *clicks immediately*  So much fun man. Great vid! 🙌🏻"
Liam doing dumb idiot in lockdown agin
Ok now who just saw a video of his and clicked on it but then started watching him nelly every day - I think that me 🤪
covering the outside with a huge plastic bag to make it water proof would be a great idea
omg it looks like sus AMOGUS
in Australia, it has just turned into spring. In New Zealand, I wouldn't think it is very different. OF COURSE it's freezing...
That was the funniest video in the whole world 🤣🤣🤣
i always have to watch to the end just to hear the "and... ba bye"
Maybe we should call it the YOLO Submarine ;)
"budget submarine Titanic"
Hm
Real question is why
Next time can you make a small couch for Max? That would be fun
Love the sponsor!
This is so stupidly ingenious
Another day another weird thing liam is a living magican
First of all why tf did you put the go pro camera in your mouth.?👀
God and you did this in the middle of winter???? Why
Perfect now your down, destroy it, put it in your porch and see if hello fresh will take your suspiciously wet cardboard
Lets goo liam its a new vid
if we can get him and mark rover he’ll have like a whole submarine e that works
3:37 that’s what the people in the titanic were like 🤣
I was kinda concerned for your life ngl.. the submarine is totally blocked off so if the water fills it up you could drown.
Didn't use flex seal smh my head
Imagine he actually drowned while doing this.
Next make it from wood
Liam, the cardboard king
That little camera is sick!
I loved the intro
This guy never fails to make me smile
ok I was about to comment that the povs during the montage were sick -- great sponsor!!!!
Your one of my favorite YouTubers, you always put a smile on my face or make me laugh when I am having a rough day.
i was literally so scared you were going to drown even though you uploaded the video
Imagine someone visits Liam's family in that right moment...his guests asking where is liam and his mom answering: he's in a cardboard submarine in our pool!
Liam after getting into the sub: “we have minor leakage…” *submarine literally filling with water* Liam: “yep we definitely have leakage” *almost drowns*
Use hydrophobic spray
Nice I see the quality is increasing           get the 2 mil bruh
3:28  that felt like one of those water escape things.  i did panic
You could’ve also add a Foil layer that’ll make it water Proof, but it Was Amazing 😃
The editing on this video is absolutely superb. (Or should i say, totally epic.)
Hello 👋
next video building a time machine and saving the world from covid
Legendary 🐐
lockdown is getting to him all ready

I forgor 💀        🥶👌
What has quarantine got us to do-
Me: planning to rewatch a few of Liams episodes Liam: what about I just upload a new one Me: happy noises
the real Phineas & Ferb
Bro. Flex seal the whole thing.
Yay new vid
Ngl this is the coolest sponsor i have ever heard!
3:37 I thought  it was gonna be ur end but thankfully it's not and 6:50
liam will invent the next best space travel with cardboard
Liam:  1)builds a card board submarine, 2) gets an EPIC sponsor, 3) has a hat that says polo when he said yolo and 4) almost drowns Also Liam:  "that sounds like a great opportunity to wear a suit"
0:55 students at america when the teacher gives them a B-.
Waiting til he becomes a scientist so he can be like Mark Rober!
We all live in a cardboard submarine, A cardboard submarine A cardboard submarine  Yeah a cardboard submarine  Sure hope we don't sink :)
That is my worst nightmare
if u put some resine on it it would be (should be) durable
3:05... am im the only one here who thinks hes gonna drown in that thing xD
This is Hilarious
lol
I WILL TRY IN HOME

Xelent vid
I really thought there was gonna be a third try lmao
Your the BESTTT
It’s time I asked this, how much cardboard you do have Liam!?
yay the best utuber the BESTBESTBESTT
This reminds me of the old "Papa Jake" box forts
when you relize he said he is filming in 1480p but its not an obtion
It's even made from "ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDLY" cardboard
3rd time is a charm
Liam's videos in 10 years: I'm going to be building a working rocketship out of cardboard ladies and gents.
Box fort
i know what insta360 is bc of @Half-Asleep Chris
👍
liam i really like you but pls can you upload videos more early❤️
next vid: "i made max out of cardboard"
Who would of thought in winter in NZ the water from your pool would be cold?? Or maybe spring idk when this was recorded
Hey liam
he will be the constructor  dad when he'll have kids
Liam is a genius
"Yeah, that would be dumb of us if we tried it again..."  **proceeds to try it again after 3 seconds of thinking**
Please heart my comment
Cooooooooooooooooooooooppoopoooooooooooooooooooopopoooooooooooooooooooooooooopppooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooppoooooollollllklkokkklkkkkkkkkkkklkkkkkkoookkoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopopppopppoooopoopppopooopppopppooppoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooppooopooppppppppppppppppppooooooooopooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopooooopppp0oooooooooooooo9ooooooopopooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo9oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooppoopopooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooppooopoopooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopoooooopppooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopppooooooooooooooooppoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopoppooooooooooooooooooooooopoooopppooooooooooooooooooooo ko oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo9ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooppppoooppooooooooopppppoooooooooooooooooooopoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooppopopooopoooooooooooooooooooooooooopppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopoopooooppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooppoooooooooooopppppppppooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooopppppoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
You should have sprayed it with the water repellent spray
This guy is a gem, I watched even sponsors commercial without remoting it... How creative you gotta be for something like this:)
He should've used flex seal,phil would be proud.
Normal Youtubers: trying to get there videos above 10 minutes. Liam:Trying to get his videos below 10 minutes
Did I just hear you say sheesh? Liam never disappoints.
Disclaimer: No Cardboard was hurt during the making of this video. #CardboardLifesMatter
just randomly started watching your videos and became a fan <3
Liam makes a submarine with cardboard:  Scientists who made real submarine: are we a joke to you? 😂
Someone tell me how this dude entertains us everytime
I love your accent
First sponsored video, pog
most creators use sponsors to make more exiting big budget videos to attract more people which in turn will attract more sponsors and the loop continues. but liam? no. liam uses his sponsorship money to make a box to put in his pool
Phil would be proud
Checking hazard Not worth it
Liam is the only happy man while suffering.
Waiting for the cardboard underground bunker with cardboard tanks and helicopters
Do stupidly sleping patch of feathers
Pt 2
The wait was worth it this is fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥
go NZ
Can we just acknowledge the fact that: Liam never clickbaits
Noice
Rare colorized footage of Germans testing their first U-boat
God: "So how did you die?" Liam: "Well..."
Wrap it in cling wrap
Your the odd one out in my subscribe cause others are all gamers or artist only you are a ✨ LEGEND ✨
His videos never disappoint me
ROAD TO TWO MILLION!!! Keep up the great videos  Edit:  I'm a big fan
Love the camera idea! Would so use it for my channel. Jut need a bit more money. *Sad*
dude u should have put flex tape or paste that could work.
Liaam! You are the--- BEST!
This is probably one of the coolest sponsors anyone has gotten ever
drown
You could have out flex seal to waterproof the holes
Yes
Liam finally uploaded... Less gooo
I dont understand why so many people act shy, when Liam is just being myself and has so many fan. Remeber to be yourself, and if someone doesn't like you for who u are they r not worthy of u
I feel a little guilty for laughing while watching Liam drown
You should make it from aluminium foil
It kind of looks like a washing machine 😀😀😀
Liam is smart for a very good reason
Hahahahahah
Dog
Favorite YouTuber
DUDE HE USIN MARK ROBER SONG 7:10
Hi
Love u bro
I love how Liam can create a working roller coaster but still decides to use cardboard to create a submarine
My two braincells do be talking like that in the beginning tho.
apparently his "boat" sinks and his "submarine" floats
Make a cardboard tank.love your channel
Who else's expecting that soon Liam will be going to make a "CARDBOARD MAX!!!"😂😂
To the 17 people who disliked this video     WHY
i need liam to attempt to make a light saber pls
Paint it yellow so you have a yellow submarine
imagine he died doing that lmao
You should treat the cardboard with the water resistant coating. Just look it up on YouTube  😂
Bro! Liam is on another level 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Yoo
I wonder how it feels like to get pinned
alternative title: liam exposing himself to death for 8:04 minutes
try with a bucket on your head under water like pirates of the caribbean with the boat
you should weaponize it
1:32 this man is literally mark rober but..
The answer to all your submarine issues is use more tape.
Omg please teach max how to make food for his own it will mean so much :) I am a big fan also.
That would be freezing! Its Winter! the only thing that could make those subs better isssssss, FLEX TAPE!
saddest anime deaths 3:33
liam’s channel in a nutshell: 0:44
Nice camera i will buy it
Could have used Flex tape.
1 hour ago and 24 views already? THATS INSANE
Plot twist: he lost his keys in the pool and wanted to get them back without getting wet
2:52 amogis
Op intro
HOW DO YOU HAVE SO MUCH CARDBOARD!?!?
just watching this made me feel clostrophobic
Video idea.      Making a fortress for my dog out of cardboard
Oof, hope he knows "water pressure" is a thing lol
7:04 That is an interesting camera angle…
omg  wow
U should’ve used flex tape
Stranding on an island with Liam seems not to end well but funny at least.
Hey Liam, you are super funny and i love your content. keep it up
and it was funny too
Liam is so cookie
Liam's back with his crazy ideas
The mark rober music.. now I know this is an important video
Week 29 of asking for another Q&A:)
Now if he can make a legit plane out of something that would be impressive
that was a cool video and and a fantastic video and entertaining
the people who disliked this floated on top of the pool
Can you say *vroom vroom I’m in my cardboard box*
When you have a bunch of junk from lockdown. Kiwi vibes right here.
woah
Ten dislikes there the ten people I hate the most
Lian thompsan in 2029 'i built a Tesla s class'
i'm gonna sinking till i caint no more
this guy tells us everything is possible
Let’s goooooo
I'm SINKING.... wait it kinda works... Good job Liam
This just goes to show that with a ton of effort you can make even a Walmart budget project work… ish
new videooo
First time I got intrest into someone's sponser
it sunk i mean thats what a submarine is supposed to do, so task failed successfully!
Never does he disappoint me.....
0:54: liam is a serial killer
i like this guy
please giveaway it i donot have that much money to buy it :-(
idk how he keeps building all these crazy stuff and it always looks so funny. keep up the nice vids!
3:43 R.I.P Liam Thompson 2021 3:44 Oh Hes Back
I woulda gotten out way sooner in the first test, bravo!         or in the second...........
Imagine almost drowning in a cardboard box
Here before 100k views
ofc, coming soon: I started my own vehicle brand
I can't be the only one who found this channel one day then watched every single vid.  Awesome channel man, thanks for inspiring me to do some projects of my own.
He never disappoints me
This is so fricking funny
I saw the thumbnail for the video, saw the title... and i thought... oh no liam
where does he live where he has a pool but it’s always freezing
these just get stranger every time
liam should collaborate with mark robber or something
Next time liam has too much cardboard, he'll build a car lol
Day 1 of asking liam to make another so satisfying
Liam, you should build a duct tape boat please.
how        on earth is this supposed to work?        HOW DID IT(kinda)WORK?
make overnight in cardboard house on water
He should made the boat like this That might save him from the island..
Liam video are always just so unexpected. Great video…as usual
Day 11 of asking for another Q and A
Imagine if this is how liam dies.
epic
Damn BRO
ded
Love ur vids
Upload made my day
pin or bad
what editor do you use? premiere pro? pls tell us
If I’ve learnt anything from this video it’s that if you fail twice just give up while your ahead
I swear Liam's next video is gonna be titled "I Built a Cardboard Car".
Liam has a big nose 7:25
Nooo 1 hour too late
Mark Rober music lit
Liam’s just built different
You never learn CARDBOD + WATER = NOTHING BUT DESTROYING STUFF but ceep doing it really entertaining good job
Hello Fresh is dumb.
Yes yes yes , best video of the month
legit mark rober music
How to build a submarine: Step 1: buy a lot of packages Step 2: ignore everything except for the cardboard Step 3: K N I F E Step 4: Cut and stick Step 5: get in the box Step 6:throw yourself inside the the water  Also can’t believe he made 2
For some reason when he sink kinda like a scene from titanic when the ship is sinking….
That biz looks kinda sus, na he tweakin
You have the most original ideas on YouTube
minor leakage wasn't minor after all
DID YOU EXPECT THE GREAT THOMAS TO SINK HIS GREAT SHIP?!?!!!!!?????
this sucks, i remember when liam and max were popping off, and now it is lesser. BUT I WILL ALWAYS be there
O
I have a feeling this isn't gonna go right....  Edit: erm well i wasn't expecting that...
How did he not drown
I know obviously he didn’t drown but the entire video made me nervous that he was going to lol
If Liam had a Netflix series it would be insane
I know that he could pop his head out at any moment but it actually made me really uncomfortable seeing the "submarine" fill up with water
I THOUGHT WE LEARNED TO NOT BUILD THINGS WITH CARDBOARD
Cool, hahahahh
Hi
The first thing that went into my head was "this things gonna sink"
I never wanna miss liams sponsors unlike others
Sounds like a great idea , is a great idea
THIS IS JUST AWESOMEEEEEE
This is hilarious 😂 I always love it when you post <3
4:15 there was a third try lol
This guy should get Oscar for wierdnesz love him though
Can we just appreciate that he got into his pool in WINTER
I like when Liam is trapped in the submarine and can actually drown and die, his first reaction is that the water is cold.
I liked the different camera POVs in the video!
Cardboard is his new best friend now...
Ten words. Wow.
hello
Next thing you know he'll build a cardboard rocket
He could make another channel and call it Kardboard King or something where he just tries to make stuff out of cardboard
This guy literally does anything that comes to his mind  Edit: thx for all the likes !!! it’s even more than the amount of votes joe Biden got !!! I’m amazed !!!!
Oh wow liam I was just waiting for your new vedio I have just started watching from like 2 days and I have watched all the vedios
The thumbnail looks like a stage from eatot
"Liam, no." Was the first thought that popped into my head seeing this.
Lol
I love how Liam’s channel is so random and that’s what makes it so interesting!
Oooooh
Budget version of going in the deep end. Very cool
Next video"i made a flying car out of cardboard(takes me 5 inches off the ground)"
LIAM THOMPSON LOGIC: USES INTRO OF A SONG AS HIS OUTRO
pin?
I love it how liam finds some stupid ideas that people don't usually think of
THE KING UPLOADED ANOTHER FANTASTIC VIDEO!
Made my night…love the outro as always
Wait     I did not realize that I was early   Ish
You're going to be the next Phineas and Ferb
Somehow your sponsorship bit had grabbed my attention more unlike others boring ones😂
This is gonna be funny
Uhhh really educational video Liam Thomaspon. That's how I said your name. Liam Thomaspon
Liam Thompson will not heart this comment
Hi

Bean mode
Mark Rober music during the sponsor segment.

Video Idea: "I tried making a scrap robot" or "i made very long arms"
HOLY HOW ARE PEOPLE SO EARLY BOIS
This man is living our childhood dreams…
Out of my 200 subscriptions this one's my favourite
kiwis be like:

Spiderman: Stuck at Home
This is claustrophobia at its finest
45 minutes after
why
but,that not how it works please give me a heart
Another funny vid
Your good at editing
Liam's videos in 10 years: I'm going to be building a working rocketship out of cardboard ladies and gents.
“We do have a little cardboard tho” *And that, is how the first cardboard city was made, Liam Thompson did something so amazing, but destroyed the next day thanks to rain*
leban teaspoon
No one: That one kid in a group project: 0:43
Liam is so cool
Love your vids liam

Here’s Liam Just using just tape and the advanced people using drills and stuff like that (respect)
In the future liams gonna make a entire house out of lego I tell ya
He never disappoint us
The enventivness of this video is incredible
even tho it's cardboard. watching the water rise in the box made me claustrophobic.
I dont care what anyone says liam is the best content creator out there!!! I love u bro!
1:30 Liam turned into Mark Rober.
LIAM THE SCIENTIST AHHSHASH

nice
These titles are so random,  I love it!
Im some kind early
SO, what do you do for a living Liam? Liam : Umm nothing much just build rollercoasters and Disney rides in my backyard and home, teach my dog how to play minecraft, write his name, pet my cat, learn how to backflip and make cardboard vessels that may or may not shrink. Like I said, nothing much
Well done on the video Liam great job
I was so scared that liam was going to drown!😶
These boxes are indirectly sounded by Hello Fresh.
Exacly what i expected
liam : no funny business also liam : *jumps into the cardboard box... i mean submarine*
Next episode: i went to the space with cardboard

Love your vids your like Mark Rover but stupider ideas
amazing i thought it would sink
Lmao
I was expecting it to sink  Well it did  But it worked better than the boat
Make a cardboard plane that would be stupid
In year 3019 Liam will make a floating house
nice
when we don’t expect something and we turn out to live it.
Dad?
legend says the cardboard submarine is still sinking
Yeah i tried to make a cardboard boat too and when i tested it out it completely sink down.  I had a pet pug which followed me and fell in the water, I had to save him  Liam you' re the best
the video is good keep it up liam
Me when I saw the title: Hold on won't that sink nevermind its Liam
The thumbnail looks like among us
wow
0:54. You know what I mean
Me reading the title: You did whhhhat?
I'm.. Early? There is alot of views but this vid was 27 minutes ago soo....
I love how every video, Liam’s editing style is different. It adds so much variety to the videos.
“I loved you like a son” .. his poor.. poor children
I was just thinking about Liam today wondering what his next video was going to be about xD
Wow it only has been 24 minutes and this video got 10,429 view, Wow.
What
Hi

Wow
hi liam
Flex tape
Hi I love your videos liam
Imagine:  'Death by cardboard submarine' lol - great vid!!
Nice idea while in level 4
Feels pretty weird and unnatural to listen to that song in the background  and not being a Mark Rober video
A person : I think I am the coolest guy on Earth Another guy : I am the most epic  Liam : Well...I have a roller coaster in my backyard
He used hello fresh boxes...........man that’s FRESH
HI Liam
Wow, it actually stayed kind of
cool
realistily if he did this in the ocean in legitamently deep water he could die
New video let's goooo
This guy always makes me laugh, he's awesome, and super great at what he does, hahahah!!!
Least someone can still make me laugh 🙂
Can’t wait for the FBI agent watching him to travel across the world to NZ just to steal his submarine and ‘Americanize it’
How did you die?  Liam:  *CARDBOARD SUBMARINE*
I thought it would sink in 1 sec
You just bring me so much joy! Thank you Liam for always brightening my day with your videos 💛.
It's always a good day when Liam uploads
Ah yes he has a lot of cardboard loitering in his home again
816th comment!!!! 24 minutes

You should do another one but cover the entire thing in duct tape, so it’s some what water proof
0:55  s h i n g
my first thoughts when seeing the thumbnail: "oh no hes gonna die oh no hes gonna drown"
It looks like this video is going under a bot invasion
YEAH BOI MAX HAPPYBOI
Is this gonna sink or float? (Your first try kinda worked :)
soggy ship
He always makes interesting content
YESS. Thanks for uploding liam.
I have done some really creative stuff today as well! But maybe just a little less creative than your submarine…
nice
Up next: "I built a cardboard spaceship"
I thought it will just dissolve but this is insane
Didn’t papa joke technically already did this?
Whenever you work the the Gov but has no money
INSTANTLY DAY IS A 10000000 TIMES BETTER YIPPPPPPIEEEEE
Liam will never run Out  of ideas Because STUPID LIAM i think it will make him happy
11/10 video. Man, if you upload more often you would be a youtube legend
Nice
How are you making something so dumb interesting
The intro sketch was so damn good
Funny Thumbnail
my recommended page is still surprising me
3:10 This video is sponsored by hello fresh,
Next video: "I built a cardboard plane and flew over the Atlantic ocean"
Me: i've been crying for a moment because i saw something i shouldn't have seen about Liam in uoao.Kim again: I only saw the dms, poor girlfriend
Who tried to come here first to get a heart?          Don’t be shy
Wow Early!!
From a house To boat  To submarine  What’s next…
this video went by so fast... it was so good.... i wish it lasted forever. Good Job Liam!!
Ok

Nice ():
The next video will be "I made a plane with cardboard"
Bro I swear Liam is so underrated. He deserves 10 million subscribers.
This man's a genius
State of the art submarine

Title: exists Liam: gets flashbacks of cardboard boat
dude his neighbors have to put up with this
yes
0:55 Liam’s face he looked like a serial killer 😰
AWESOME VD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For when you make a cardboard cruise ship just remember cardboard isn’t water proof…
Next… a cardboard car or plane
*And that was how Liam drowned*
Liam is my favorite YouTuber, and this is why.
This is what lockdown does to u
THIS MAN
Who knows papa jake's carboard submarine
Do a second attempt after waterproofing the cardboard and using FLEX TAPE AND FLEX SEAL
Try with wood next time Just for science

lets go 13mins ago i was just thinking of when u were gonna post
This is honestly terrifying 😀

69th view LMAO
when Liam has children he is gonna have so much stories to tell them
Next video :  I built a cardboard battleship
The fact that everyone is saying "The fact that everyone is “The fact that everyone is saying “ “The fact that everyone is saying “The fact that everyone is saying “The fact that everyone getting recommended this again is legendary” is legendary.” “is legendary.” “is legendary” is legendary "is legendary" is legendary is legendary'' is legendary.
Yeah but The fact that everyone is saying "The fact that everyone is “The fact that everyone is saying “ “The fact that everyone is saying “The fact that everyone is saying “The fact that everyone getting recommended this again is legendary” is legendary.” “is legendary.” “is legendary” is legendary "is legendary" is legendary is legendary'' is legendary.
“The second times a charm” SpaceX: You sure about that?
Is the roller coaster still in your backyard?
Kiwi pap jake
Liam smarter than me, I would have made a plastic bag submarine..
Next step: Building a carboard airplane
"Drowning myself for views"
Liam is a mad genius (and an proffesional dog trainer..... well almost) LOL
Build a boat for max.
Sick!
Hahahaha
As soon as I looked at the title I didn’t have to even see who it was by who else does this random stuff dude.
As always, your intros are the best
Cardboard Rocket?
nice
3 dislikes??? how could anyone not liking this
liam : I am smart so i will use science also liam : jumps in to water and trusts cardboard with his life     ps this is a joke love your content liam
Every time I see a video by Liam in my suggestions box, my reaction every time is "Oh Liam what have you done now". Can confirm that I have never been disappointed. Love these vids dude
Liams back yeesss im in your same country sorry about covid 19
Shouldve sprayed the whole thing with flex seal lol

I can just imagine Liam’s garage full of cardboard supercars and veichles
Fun fact: Liam still does not know that cardboard isn’t waterproof
Liam Thompson is one of those youtubers who makes awesome videos and leaves you with nothing to comment

“I have no idea what I’m doing” - Liam Thompson 2021
omg 10 mins ago
I expected total sinkage. I was not disappointed. 10/10 video, great job!
I love Liam’s vids ❤️❤️❤️Always look forward to them!
Ah yes, "Minor Leakage" just like Titanic
Video idea: make you real life house completed with furniture, food and people out of cardboard then tie it to a million cardboard balloons, create a cardboard sky, cardboard space and fly to the cardboard moon that you made and create a skyscraper on the cardboard moon out of cardboard.
Lel
yea go liam build more dumb stuff go liam

I’ve never seen someone more creative 🤣🤣
It’s 10pm on a school night but you know this is fine ✨👏

Mark Rober music
Mate, your a huge legend, you have never click baited.
Hi
do another vision one where you see what a fly sees
"Liam is a mad-man who is also somehow cool" I didn't think I'd hear anything like that
I thought I was going to witness one of my favourite youtuber die
I feel so sorry for his neighbours
e
Hello I love this vid!
nExT make a house for max but out of cardboard or tinfoil!
This seems very safe
When your teacher tells you to make a submarine and you go watch the best tutorial yet
The literal manchild lol
It looks like a washing machine
Liam Thompson production quality 📈📈📈
Finally felt like it was forever last time he made a vis
Haha the first one kinda worked.. for 3 seconds and the second one looked like a rocket
3:40 *actually thought he was gonna drown*
Liam use hot glue 👌
You need to duct tape the whole box next time so it doesn’t get water in it  Don’t worry about your oxygen supply
hey
This is hilarious
"I built a Cardboard Submarine". Do I sense a bad- I mean good idea or what?
If you ever do this again, cover the cardboard with a lot of duck tape, make sure no cardboard is showing. It helps it waterproof just a little.
1440p why are you recording this in 1080p
Liam you mad genius!
👏 water + cardboard = awesome videos
Nice lol
I feel like this is his longest video yet… I love it
When you already know it’s Liam vid by just reading the title.
5:27 nice jacket. Looks good on you.
Your my favourite YouTuber
A lengend to be remembered...Liam Thompson
I found this so funny

This man is sick (A Genius).
Australian Youtuber almost Drowns in box, in a cold swimming pool

title: cardboard submarine  me: yea that makes sense 😀
KINDA EARLY
He is THE best YouTuber in the world EVER!!!!!!!! And just by looking at the title, I knew this would be another great video. But for real I wonder what would be going through his head when he thinks of what to do a video on LMAO🤣🤣😂😂

How to make a Liam Thompson video : 1. Stupid idea 2. Hurt yourself somehow 3. Be funny  Always works
Should've tested it at the bottom of the ocean.

i love your videos
I have been waiting for this
Love your vids
Who else watches until the full end to see the funny clip?
building a boat that does not float and making a submarine from the same matierial seems smart
You have 20 IQ and 3000 IQ at the same time.
liam: do not try this at home also liam: *tries at home*
As soon as I read the title I thought how got invited to his funeral
Why is everyone commenting? The video's only been public for 4 minutes
yay
someone gift this man 10,000 rolls of duck tape
Next video: I built cardboard from cardboard
Amazing
El Liam is eth gret-est
I immediately thought of the cardboard boat video when I read the title and I thought…    HECK YEAH, HERE WE GO AGAIN
How Liam thinks if cardboard boat won’t work then for sure a cardboard summarine will work big brain 🤯🤯🤯
That is one interesting submarine… 🤔 At least it didn’t sink the way the titanic did.
Build cardboard play button

We all live in a yolo submarine
This guy is modern genius
Dude shouldn’t have done it in winter/early spring depending on when this was recorded lol
This mans IQ is growing -4 each time he does a video, he’s broken science
So many views but it was only uploaded 5 minuets ago This proves the man has content
YES YOU FINALLY UPLOADED!!!

Hes doing everything I wanted to to as a kid, but it actually works
Missed your vids glad u posted
Liam is like a little brother that hit puberty way before me
Lockdowns got him going crazy
The fact that you can lowkey drown in there scares me
“this thing is so tiny, i can swallow it whole      -every baby
I like your vids, keep up the great work 😃
But why
At this point, what can’t he do?
Video quality increases. Video idea quality decreases. And I love it!
Build a cardboard house for max.
I clicked this the second he posted.

This idea is paper thin, I think it won't hold up
The best youtuber hands down  Love the unique ideas
Nice, you truly are the definition of “so bad, it’s good!” As an Australian, I can say Your amazing Liam!
Yeah, that would be dumb We do have plenty of cardboard tho....... 🤔
Liam: *Does something that nearly kills him* Also Liam: *Does that same thing but more extreme*
