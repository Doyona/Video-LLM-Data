Anyone else notice pickles is wearing nico’s uniform
Am I the only one who noticed that pickles chef's coat say Nico and not pickles?😂😂😂
Triggering lol
"Hey 👋🏻, You want some Candy 🍬, 😒🙄 You Idiot"  🤣😆 Props to Pickles for tryna boost ⬆️ the Health score.
Always hated that when the boss would walk by and you'd try to be nonchalant and friendly, and they give you the disapproving.Judging eyes as they mark on their clipboard😮‍💨😅😂😅🤣
Just happened to my restaurant....all I could think of was this sketch.....
My hospital feels the same way about the medical review board😅
Yup. Every time lmao. We had a guy put down a burger patty then immediately grabbed a bun to toast without changing gloves IN FRONT OF THE HEALTH INSPECTOR. Needless to say, our 98 went to an 84 just like that. Idk how he didn’t get fired.
The hairnet 😂
Legit this is how it goes. Especially the rags lol
Sany bucket. Omg too funny
God darn clip board. Ugh
sounds about right PANIC MODE!!!!  Hahahahahahahahah. Fuckin labels. Time date initials. HEARD.
Yo pickles not cool dude
True 😊
"Check your temps-" ohhhhh Joey, check your administrative duties. Who wasn't keeping track of the daily temp checks?
So true 😂😂😂😂😂
if the health dept looked in my fridge... LOL. . Lets say I am a bit brave on some of the "soft" vegetables.. not rotted but but yeah, I tend to be frugal .. if it doesn't have active mold on it or smells bad I try and eat it. LOL
My first year as a chef I was waiting for the health inspector for the longest time, I didn't know when they'd show up.  On a random day, I decided to clean my oven. Had to crawl in there and everything. Literally the next day, my boss forgets to unlock the door when we open. The health inspector calls and says our door was locked so she's just going to get a coffee and come back. Me and my boss power cleaned everything in 15 mins and we passed.  She didn't even check my oven.
This is true 😬😬
For a moment I was genuinely fearful my favorite restaurant and crew were about to be canned but then I remembered it doesn't exist and they are all the same guy.
You forgot to switch your jacket between Nico and Pickles
No eating on the line! lol 😂 I worked in restaurants so long I remember when the rule was no smoking on the line!!!
I always have to stop myself and remember it's the same dude
😂
NSF came we got a 98 we didn't use defrost labels just regular codes
“I need new dates on all these labels” is too fucking real 😂
Remember friends it’s either in your bucket or in your hand, nowhere else
So close, and here comes Pickels, lol 😂❤😂
I got the line cooks a coke after our morning rush while the health inspector was there and he got us for open containers behind the line..while he was sipping on the coke I got him.
Damn it, Pickles!
Every notice that pickles' jacket says nico on it?
I know the three different times I ran kitchens they would tell me the health department's here and I'd say so what because I knew the place was clean we followed the rules wearing gloves hats or hair nets it was always little minor shit I'd rather have it marked in blue than in red
As a 30 year veteran of the kitchen I always invited the health inspector back and immediately asked them to tell me how we could improve. They know all the BS stalls and scams already. You're not fooling anybody.
Omg pickles can finally aford name brand skittles probably from the tip out😂
I love seeing everyone work together ❤️😆
Every time
Why did pickles have Nico jacket on 😂😂
The only time I’ve had the health department come in while I worked in a kitchen was before my shift started. Thankfully I wasn’t there because I would’ve unintentionally caused a lot more trouble.
-3 for eating on the line
This is so spot on lolol
Pickles with reign ahead of the curve🎉
Anyone notice how pickles jacket says Nico and not pickles
Hated random health department days. Always got everyone stressed out, and chefs would have full-blown last-minute panic attacks that would spread everywhere. Had to refill sanitation buckets, throw rags in the laundry basket, keep the station clear, make sure labels were correct and toss expired food when checking in the fridges and pantries, and put away your dirty dishes.
I did that under the guise of getting change for the till from the office. I just walked briskly whispering “health department” at everyone. Our kitchen was spectacularly clean but none of the cooks wore gloves. They washed their hands super regularly though
Why is having a snack while cooking a violation?
I'll take some candy 🍬 Pickles.
Until they ask for your logs
Took me 2 years to notice he forgot to switch into Pickle’s chef coat in the last frame
Some health inspectors are cool and chill and some are like umpires in tge MLB, have enflated egos and are on a power trip.
pickles was wearing Nico’s thing
Have yall noticed that Pickles is wearing a coat that says Nico?
Why does pickles coat say nico
I’m telling ya, there ain’t a restaurant, food truck, or lemonade stand out there that ain’t breaking the health code in three different ways.  (Ain’t nobody ever got sick from our taters anyway)
Extremely true to life.
I remember doing this at the bakery I worked at. Was always so hectic
So no one using code to announce this visit? We'd say "table 99 has been sat" and then panic lol
Lol facts
Wait, why is Pickles wearing Nico's uniform?
Nobody  gets between  the whole  team
Just noticed that Pickles wears a Nico jacket
god damn it, Pickles, lmao
Incredibly accurate
Worked in hotel room service and our set up was in the kitchen. We literally had 4 large trash cans for when the health inspector came so we could throw out everything not labeled or any violations
Forgot the sani-bucket refresh
Concept for a restaurant rule: always keep everything clean and spotless, but still give the health inspector shit everytime for being the government bureaucrat that they are.   Makes them think there's something wrong, but they never find anything that slowly chisels away at their creditability and sanity.
Also, why does Pickles' jacket say Nico??
My heard dropped at the end... Dang it Pickles
It's exactly like when auditors come in retail. Suddenly everyone's darting around down stocking and dusting with the most fervor I've ever seen while also trying to be really subtle about it
pickles’ “eating on the line” demerit saves them from the inspector doing a colonoscopy on the deep freeze
Back when I was a cook, a health inspector walked into the kitchen during the middle of a rush. I didn't know who he was though. I just yelled at him to get out of my kitchen. He tried to say something and I started walking AT him to back him out of the kitchen.  I really thought I was going to get fired that day when I found out later who he was.
Goddamnit, Pickles! 😂😂😂
Should have sent Nicole in! She would have surely kept them busy.
Oh Pickels 🙄🤣
Move move move!! 😂😂
The double fisting pens!!!!
"New dates on all these labels!" I work in a hospital kitchen and im LMFAOAOAOAO
🫨Oh Pickles, even an offer of  candy is considered a bribe 🥴
Every year. Spot on
Yeah I hate it when they show up.
I wish random health department visits were actually a thing- 😂
If health standards throw you into a panic, you shouldn't be serving food.
I worked at a fast food restaurant that would wipe off old lables and print over them with new ones when the inspector showed up and somehow we were usually the highest ranking restaurant in the district 🙃
Idk how I just noticed this but pickles uniform says Nico
This is exactly how it goes
I just recently invested into Bistro Huddy. If the Health Dept. ever shuts them down. I'm going to be pissed 😂
Sooo real. Our  secret code is 86 ice cream, because we don't sell ice cream. I was off for the last visit unfortunately, i heard health dept. gave us a lot of grace
Hot mess most of the time health department shows up well oiled machine
My greatest compliment in the kitchen was when the local health inspector brought her boss to eat at my restaurant.
Dammit Pickles. So fricking close!
Pickles knows the health department has to find *something* to write up. hes giving them an easy out on something to put in the report so he can go home. Pickles is a hero
How are Nico and Pickles both wearing a Nico chef coat? Plot holes… 😭
When I worked as a waitress and bartender once. The restaurant was incredibly slow, so I deeped cleaned the entire bar. My boss/ owner screamed at me for doing unnecessary shit. ( he was just mad because it was slow). Next day, health department came in..... guess which area was the only one that passed.
When I worked in a restaurant it felt like this every time they came in. And with me being the cashier/hostess I was the one that saw them first and immediately grabbed my manager and told people so they could spread it around. It was all hands on deck to make sure everything was spotless.
I used to hate it when the health department came into the nursing homes I worked at as a supper cook. It wasn't a few minutes of inspection, it was days of inspection. They checked everything in the nursing home, the nurses, CNAs, and the kitchen. We always followed safety guidelines, if the health dept was there or not, but they were very particular & every single thing had to be perfect. It drove me crazy!
As a person who worked in service and fast food 😂 yes! This was it. All very accurate
I love Terry's "Heard" when Amber gives him the news.
The kitchen equivalent of DHS showing up to a daycare
so accurate. we were always looking for the pH paper that no one ever uses.
We had one inspector tell us If you know what to fix and it can be done in five minutes we’re more impressed. Almost got perfect scores each time
The hairnet scramble was hilarious!!!
The inspectors that have lunch before they inspect...... they're the real mvps😂
If you actually worked in the kitchen you'd know to check the pH.
Always one that messes it up with points
Eating Nutella with the sun in
lol I saw just thinking about this one
I noticed pickles had Nico's jacket on.  😂😂
i always forget that joey is the only one actually wearing a hairnet lmaoo
the hairnet put on like a fool is preem for me. i do enjoy when my coworkers do this everyday anyway as well
I was FOH manager when the health inspector came.  I told them I would get the Restaurant Manager and went to the back and told her.  I then immediately went to the dish pit and had them add more sanitizer in the sink.  Saw the report later and it said "Excellent sanitizer levels."
Why is everyone in the comments acting like this is funny?? Like this is food we're talking about here, if the restaurant i went to PANICKED when they saw the health inspector id sue their ass bc that's gross af. Like ppl are acting like they want to give people food poisoning 😭 wtf
Nico looks so won't without his hair hanging out.
OMG, someone grab the can opener!
They literally just showed up at my restaurant, right behind an eight top and a five top. Pure craziness. 🤣😂😭🤪
I like how three words throws the whole restaurant into chaos
Terry immediately ran Omaha 3🤣
Oh, god, we could be here all year swapping health department stories. The worst one was probably the time they finally noticed that the vent hood over the grill was just nailed to the ceiling and not hooked up to anything.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Health department dressed like a Persona protagonist
Awesome work is always keep it up you matter
😂
Lmfao this is so accurate
The Manager is a clutch position for health inspections, literally like Terry you stall for every second so the back of the house can get their s*it together.
😂😂😂😂😂 It's so lovely to see them all work together 🥹❤️ I love this channel and its universe
I can attest this is highly, highly accurate. I’m not even sure I can say anything in this skit is exaggerated.😂
I’m so glad I don’t have restaurant kitchen horror stories. The restaurants I worked in were mostly clean. Obviously there were human errors occasionally but we were good
This is exactly my kitchen but the benefit is all the health department people are my college underclassmen
Roll Tide!😂
Pickles has a Nico shirt? Lol
Facts. 😂 Been there more than once 😂
salon equivalent to state board 😮‍💨
Just noticed Pickles is wearing Nico's shirt
remember, kids: it's not how up to code the place is, but how fast they can *get* up to code that matters
I regularly eat at a restaurant where I can see her prepping on the card table placed on a dirt floor in her "kitchen". And I'm just glad we don't have health.Inspectors down here in Mexico. It would kill the best restaurants in town.
See I never understood letting a kitchen get to the point that the health inspector becomes a negative.  Even at home, I'm R/O labeling everything we have. Just instinct at this point
Wait, so it's not allowed to eat in the kitchen or what? What's the issue here?
Eating Candy while cooking isn’t that bad honestly
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂tooo toooo REAL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅😅
Innacurate!  They forgot to put their gloves on, rule no. 1!!
Good ol Pickles 🥒 😂
Haha so on point
What was wrong with the candy?
Pickles is the best 😂😂
I worked in a deli for a total of five weeks before I couldn’t stand it. The way we deep cleaned before the inspector arrive revolted me. IT WAS SO DIRTY
WYSI 727
LOL!!!!! Omg! 😂😂😂😂 pickles!!!!
Noooo pickles! NOT THE CANDY!!! 😂😂😂
has anyone ever really checked the temperatures? anywhere i worked nobody bothered with the logs so i write in random numbers that look right. i can't think of *how* you would actually check in any of the kitchen i worked in, does the manager keep thermometers locked up somewhere? anyway, whatever, it's been enough kitchens that i know the way i do it is normal. you just guess :) they always thank you for doing that
At a few moments during the video Pickles was wearing Nico's cook garb.  I guess they panicked so hard their clothes got switched.
I thought I heard "Check your tits!" 😂😂
god DAMN it Pickles, you had one job!
Can't believe he didn't say yes
as important as health inspectors are, some of them can be real a**holes. I was working at a hotel once and we ran a tight ship, didnt even really care if they showed up because we were CLEAN. That mfer got us on a broken floor tile because it could "breed bacteria" we were like wtf.
The quart container water cup is a classic
The sharpi pull out is a fact 😂
Hahaha pickles damn! That face while chewing and offering😅😂
Pickles run RUN GO HOME!
I have real tears in my eyes. You capture the cooks perfectly every single time.
Why are you making ads for triple ten
The last time I dealt with the health department, the woman came in, sat down for 15 minutes and came up to me with a sign that said "excellent". I will probably never have that luck again but boy was I happy not to have to deal with it that day.
Someone is using your vid for an ad
Same thing when faa comes around
Toronto, Ontario, Canada here 25 years BOH and this is so so true here forever too 😂😂
Hey drew, you might want to know that triple ten used your footage here for an ad about their software development course
Throw out the drinks and label!
PICKLES NOOOOO
We do this all the time in the steel  factory when OSHA guys come
😂😂😂😂😂
In my kitchen we yell “hootie-hoo” when the health Dept shows up.
pickles with the net on top of the cap lol
Not eating on the line is one of those rules i didn't understand until i saw someone else eat and realized 99% of y'all are slobs
T
you forgot to change into pickles' coat in the last shot lol
This is literally my favorite workplace sitcom.
I swear the government be harassing people 😂😂😂😂
His acting as so many different characters actually scares me with how believable it is
At least it’s not from the van
Why does Pickle's nametag say "Nico"?
Leave it to 🥒 Pickles……
The health inspectors that visit my families restaurant always come before we open or right at open, so everything is always freshly set up and not had a chance to get messy and we are pretty serious about accurate labels/dates on everything its always just a scramble to get the employees reeking of weed outside and water bottles and whatnot put away
this really pisses me off. if there was a line check done and if everyone did what they were supposed to they wouldnt freak out. i dont know how many times the health department came in and everyone was freaking out and im just on my station like "so?"
Health Department….. about time you showed up many of our customers keep saying their calling you to come shut us down……. Is there a bad backlog???? Are you taking applications??😂😂😂
It's incredibly important that health department officials not be stalled or impeded. Restaurants that have aggregious problems are allowed to reamin open for years after the problem is found even if it's not fixed, depending on the jurisdiction. In my last town we had a sushi place that had the ceiling flaking off onto the food prep area. Reports went back years having the same complaint. The place was still open.
I hate this because restaurants should never be afraid of the health department. they only ding you if you're doing something wrong or not taking care of the building and cooking areas
We've always been scheduled for an inspection and they only happened Monday through Friday 9 to 5...
Pro tip — hire a cook or a manager that served in the army/Navy etc…
Damn it pickles!!
lol terry is my bosses name 😂
I swear we all worked at she same restaurant 😂😂😂 ill never forget our manager Richard doing the same thing making slow conversation walking slowly to the back with the health department guy while everyone in the back ran around getting everything in order like the place was on fire😂. And that was in NYC where you get a big letter grade in your window on display
My first job was KFC for 2 years and I can't remember a singe Health Dept visit in our rural area.
This is why you always do this stuff😅
Could you make a sketch of him accidentally mishearing ”health departement”
The health inspector who usually did are restaurant came in one day cause the head of the health department was comming around and she warned us and was actually  cleaning my fridge and putting dates on things was so funny I think she was being evaluated  but this clip is so true lol
PICKLES NO😭
Crazy to listen to so many people tell people in restaurants what clean is etc. Lol. Brother, i eat street food and have never gotten sick. The health code violations at a general taco truck are through the roof. There is a reason its referred to as the roach coach lol. I have gotten sick from Applebees before but the lady in mexico making tortillas and tacos by hand no gloves never made me sick
Goddamnit Pickles!!! 😂😂🤦‍♀️  But actually they can tell when they’re being stalled and don’t really care because if the kitchen staff can correct any possible violations in less than 5 minutes, they’re not gonna code you and your business is probably better off than half the other ones out there 😂🤷‍♀️
Knowing Spanish has always come in clutch during inspections.
there was a button on the POS for “hotpot” which was the code word for health inspector to the kitchen/bar printers etc and one night in an insane rush I accidentally hit it and sent the entire building (my previous restaurant is in a historic tower with 5 other concepts)  in a tailspin it was so embarrassing lmfao
Cook here I feel like pickles is exactly how I am with my coworkers when I bring snacks. Do you want some?😂😂😂😂 I think I got flashbacks when he said the health inspector was coming through and he better put that towel in the bucket And they’ll have somebody in the back secretly redoing all the labels or putting labels on the stuff that didn’t have one 🤣🤣🤣 Everybody will be running around like chickens with their heads cut off, trying to get everything done and then act normal when the guy actually comes through
Dude nah…   Someone saying “kitchen this way?” With no other explanation would get thrown out?  We use our words to express ourselves! Like wtf?
If you stayed up on your temps everyday and your dates in the walkin and your cold line is working properly then health department walking in should be a breeze. If you implement hand washing when they’re supposed to then why worry. I’m a General Manager and every 30 mins my cook no matter what or how busy change gloves  and wash hands. Servers never touch top of cups only the sides and all serving untencils and I check my dates and temps every hour and I told health department to not even tell me they are here to just go straight to my kitchen and come get me when they are done to go over his report and I haven’t failed in 9 years that I’ve been a GM
Bet the girl chef wasnt cooking that day 😂
We got notified that the fire department was in the same lot as me when I was running food so me and one of the kitchen guys went booking it around the building moving all the junk in front of exits and extinguishers just in case they came by
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!!!!!!!!! Relatable I work in a university cafe.. The dates, the labels, the scattering
LOL no Pickles, bad Pickles! *sprays with water*
The accuracy 😂😂
Lol, I was a hostess at a restaurant (a long time ago) and I absolutely hated my boss and coworkers. To get even, I stopped telling them when the health inspector showed up and let it be a surprise for everyone. I will never forget the sound of dishes crashing, pots and pans banging around, and people yelling at each other when they found out. 😈
Was pickles wearing Nicos jacket?
Not pickles wearing the Nico outfit
My gf was a chef and she somehow knew when they were coming in..is that not common?
This was me with the fire department. We would have these events with like thousands of chairs and they had to go "somewhere" when the event was over, which was usually the bottom stairwell until we could move them back to the warehouse. Um, can't have those there if the fire department drops by, which is annoying because they never found us a solution as to how we can satisfy the "clean up the space," but "also where does this go so we can clean?" issue. I got a call, which we so cleverly coded for our walkies so we can notify our whole management staff at the same time that s--t was hitting the fan. We had to sprint down 3 flight of stairs, grab like 10 staff members to HAUL ABSOLUTE A** to throw those chairs back up the stairs to the event space in like 15 minutes. I'm screaming, just throw them, throw them, doesn't matter where!!!! We were sweaty and could barely breathe but we got enough out so that it was passable before they made it down the long corridor that our other manager was sloooowwwlly taking them down while they checked on everything else.
He finally got his on brand skittles!
I’m obsessed with these skits and all the characters. Can’t stop watching it
It’s always that one person😂😂
Any FOH staff worth their weight cones to the kitchen and tells us the inspector is there.
Rico’s hair net is killing me 😂😂😂😂
I swear the only way my old restaurant passed inspection was the owner paying the inspection off ahead of time.
I had an inspector complain the the jelly packets were messy behind the shelf at a breakfast diner
Place I worked at “required” the health department to sit through a 15 minute health and safety video because “we are a unique site”, smartest thing I’ve ever been apart of
"Heard!" 😂
oh lord i remember being 16 working in a restaurant this brings back nightmares
I worked fnb for 10 years. When I was in management, I always do a spot check every shift, (x3 daily).  And yes, it's always the label..  -before lunch, after lunch & closing.   So during audit we don't really worry much except for the new hires (discipline & behaviour during audit) & snacks..  - I was raised poor so I know what's like working hungry so I'm lax about snacks.
One of my old jobs had such a clean kitchen that health department would come in, go wow, this is the cleanest kitchen I've ever been in, or wow, it's just as clean as last year. The whole process was like five minutes, and most of that was just chatting with whoever walked them through.
I owned a bar and restaurant in the loop downtown Chicago in th 1980s , a hundred under the blender upstairs bar got me a clean bill of every time
I always grabbed every dish, knife and cutting board off their racks and tossed em into the sinks, kicked over every sanitizer bucket and kicked every cook off the line with their shit whenever the health inspector showed up. Drink on the line, 10 points. Dirty or wet dish on the rack, 10 points. Sanitizer bucket with more than 1 rag, 10 points. Sanitizer bucket not up to snuff on the glow stick 10 points. Label out of spec, 10 points. Temp of a fridge or line cooler, 10 points per. Then a whole slew of minor infractions worth 1 point each. Score put of 100, below and 80 was a failure. It's fucking brutal sometimes.
Damn spot on 😆
Little fact health knows where kitchen is but sometimes you get a new inspector that doesn't. When I was working at place the inspector gave a range on dates they probably get there. Sometimes a random inspector well come with no warning.
😂😂😂 Like when safety comes to do their checks. As an archaeologist who has dug holes in summer in the middle of a flat field, I do not need a hardhat. That's what's giving me heatstroke. The higher ups were usually the ones in trouble for no hardhats 😂
🫠🤣
I work at the food court at the mall so we always know when we’re next 😂 and she’s super chill also
Due dates was accurate as hell till I was in charge. I just wrote it with a sharpie on the cling wrap…our health inspector actually hated me and made it very well know when he was in…
Not the deli container for water
At my old place we just had this way too serious lady walk behind the counter mumbing.  Health department while holding an ipad.  We never questioned her come to think of it 😅
For some reason "PUT THAT RAG IN THE BUCKET!" gave be a ptsd flashback to my food service days 😭
This is unbelievably accurate, from the hostess making first contact, going to get the manager, everyone scrambling and telling each other in hushed tones the health department is here and then organized chaos ensues while everyone is doing last minute fixes
“The cook who hands out snacks and candy… check” 😂😂😂
The kitchen freaking the hell out is so funny 😂
Honestly hate the health department...have the stuff they take points off for is absolutely stupid
Why did Pickles have Nico’s coat on?
I worked at a high end resort and when the health inspector would show 2 outside restaurant/ bars would close. And we would get the day off lol
the hair net over the hat 😭😭
it would be over if the last place i worked got a health inspection
Ah yes, the whispered message passes along like wildfire and you see everyone scrambling to throw out drinks and changing tags. There's always someone that gets us dinged though. LOL
Worked at a university cafeteria during 2020-2021 with intensive covid precautions. they followed all procedures to the letter, i was proud to work there.
You could not imagine what will actually pass the health department standard. I worked at a bar that served lunch meat and steaks that were grey and frozen 2 years prior to being sold. I didn’t stay very long
Health department acting like they care about safety when they violate you for  dumbshit all just money grab
His hostess acting role is so realistic lmao i forget its him
When I used to work in food: There was only one person I showed hate towards as much as I did the owners: The health inspector. Because they cause more issues than anything else in my work environment and cause me to deal with more shit than necessary.  Even when you're fine, they cause management to demand the fucking most despite the fact we're already doing well and it pisses me off.
"lock that door and say you lost the keys" -boss 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Our health inspector ate at our restaurant… needless to say we were clean
A lot of the jobs I worked at as soon as anyone saw the health inspector everyone would run around making sure everything looked good then the kitchen would practically be closed until they left, so the entire kitchen would just hang out at the bar
Wait, chefs can't eat?
Not Pickles with the “oh no”! 🤣🤣🤣 I died!
as someone who used to work in a grocery store deli this is exactly how it feels when this happens
😂
Zero recordable, two correct on sights
Oh, the days...🙄😄 Ya had the nazis and the white hats.
Congrats Pickles, you are now a diabetic who keeps candy on him to make sure his blood sugar stays in check.
The hairnet past the eyebrows is so accurate 😂
😅I work a restaurant this is so on point
They supposed to give yall a 10 minute heads up
LMAOOOO THIS IS SO FUNNY. I DIED AT PUT THE RAG IN THE BUCKET 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Not Pickels wearing Nico's jacket😂
it is upsetting how accurate this is…
This is a thousand percent accurate
That's horrifying
We just pay our health inspectors
I can't get enough of these. It's so darn accurate 😂
I once got in trouble because we got dinged 1 point for a piece of parchment paper under the griddle.
I'd just yell: "WHY DO YOU HAVE CANDY! GO THROW THAT AWAY AND CLEAN UP"
Don’t let Pickles being nice distract from him WEARING NICO’S JACKET!!!
i love how pickles says "oh no" i watched it like 4 times
Am I the only one that noticed pickles wearing Nico’s coat at the end of
poop
Yeah , if you don't know the panic of the health department show up, you never worked in a restaurant
Oh god, the flashbacks😂
I remember when we had an inspection and the manager stalled while I ran to clean the cellar and ice machine, and the chef sifted through the walk ins for anything out of date😂 never moved so fast in my life! We passed though 🤷‍♀️
genuinely love this channel!
I used to work in a deli. This is so accurate haha!
my workplace runs on a rather strict company-wide inspection policy and when I tell you that I am forever thankful we get a few days notice before our inspector shows up it's an understatement
Most health inspectors agree that if a problem can be fixed within the 5 minutes they wait it’s not really a problem
😂😂
Did anyone notice that pickles was wearing Nico shirt?
Worked at a restaurant that rhymed with bentucky bried bicken and this is the exact situation every time inspection came.
giving me ptsd because i was always the one to speed label every container 😅
Accurate! LOL!
This one got me. Fucking health department showing up in the middle of the rush. Moving some big ass metal that's old, we don't know what it's for. Going to mark you for this.
You are 1 of the few shorts I absolutely don't skip. The acting is great. I frequently forget it's 1 person. Keep up the great work.
This is so accurate.
This is so accurate
If I were them I'd probably buy one of those remote doorbells with the button under the host stand
Worked at my local KFC for 2 years can absolutley confirm this is what happens when head office shows up
I want to see pickles as the chef 😂
The mark the most ridiculous shit that has NOTHING to do with the food quality
I worked as a dishwasher in a big chain and our instructions were always fill the sinks, dump everything in them, and don't touch anything until they leave. My manager would have your head if you lost us a point, but they still always found something.
It might be because I have mild face blindness, but I legitimately forget that it’s one guy playing all these characters. I feel like I know their souls at this point.
Anchovie
Yelling ‘dates’😅😅
Every restaurant ever. Even if you’re not doing anything wrong and they can’t find something you still feel like you need to make corrections
Maaaaan
i thought he said "put that rag down fuk it ! 😂😂
One time during inspection I saw an open container of McDonald’s coffee (and open container, especially outside food/drink, is a violation) at my station. I asked the chef “whose is this?” He was like, “go ahead, throw it out” - few minutes later, the inspector comes back, “Did you see my coffee cup?” Chef just winked at me ;-)
😂 this is soooooo true
I used to bartend at a restaurant where the kitchen was an open concept and was at the entrance of the restaurant. Cooks never got any warning.
🤣 I miss that energy 🥰
He is so happy sharing his candy. Lol
Why are the Health department people are always so miserable too? 😂
Typically revs and health dept give you a min or two before they start scoping everything out. And they ALWAYS take the full time to wash their hands before they put the gloves on. They know if its bad enough theres nothing to be done within the grace period anyways. They are a necessary evil. ❤️
LMAO label checks being the first panic thought is too real
Cheer~~~~a division of a large organization such as a government, university, business, or shop, dealing with a specific subject, commodity, or area of activity.😊
Health department: no drinking water OSHA: let them drink water  I want to see this fight
The scramble to fix up if accurate lol
Fuckin pickles
Reminds me of the one time we had a new HD worker coming in and my boss showed him the hotel rooms first so the kitchen had some time to put lids on everything during full service 😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Pickles is wearing Nico's top lol
I’m gonna need me some of that blonde girl 🤤🤤🤤
I used to brr er the one to check all the logs weekly and fill the empty spots…. Sometimes waited a month in I knew we weren’t due soon…. Stems from ptsd on my first job in a restaurant that the exec chef failed for and was my third week there… he screamed at me for it… but there was six months of it missing…oh and the wall in fridge thermometer was “ broken” at a solid 39 degrees but was registering on theirs fora toasty 51… I learned a lot that day after they shut them down for two weeks to fix everything. Any kitchen I went passed with good comments. Even had a health inspector literally say she was so glad to see me at this one place cuz she knew that she wouldn’t have to worry about it failing that year. We had the same one for our city and I worked almost every restaurant
His closet must be awesome!!!
haha the madness...
Just know, the OG cronut from Dominique Ansel & all of the pastries in SoHo, absolutely contaminated & you can blame the abusive workplace & insane turnover on Mingi. Want to contest this? I have videos that support me 😂
Ew Don’t eat at BH
Pizza place is so much easier. every time the health guy came in everyone acted the same as when the pepsi guy showed up. just say hello and let him work. I never saw us fail. only ever gave us a few minor nitpicks here and there
Where I worked we hire an outside company that was way more harsh than the health department and I will never forget when they came in before open one day and ambushed the shift lead manager and I. Our GM laid into us for having the front door unlocked at the time.
FUCK, PICKLES!
Even the health dept. has to show creds.  If that happened in Maine he wouldve been arrested for B&E
we just had the health department in and that’s how i learned the sanitizer buckets are supposed to be cold water, i got written up for that.
I completely forget this is 1 guy
The things I have seen working in restaurants (shudder) 🤢
Drinking water out of the soup container is so spot on
Hand towel sir 😂😂
I accidentally touched the toast when the health inspector was there
Fuck me, I hope Pickles didn’t really do that
Why’s Pickles wearing Nico’s uniform?
100% true
If you’ve always wondered what happens when the health department shows up this is the most accurate representation I’ve ever seen 😂 🫡
Does anybody else read these comments in pickles or other characters voices in their head? 😂
Literally every day OF MY LIFE. except all I hear is "TOUCH POINTS TOUCH POINTS!"
Gosh dangit Pickles.
I worked in a restaurant in DC and we passed our health inspection even with our mildew and rats so…😅
Are you not allowed to eat candy in a kitche,?
Pile 3 thank you always❤
Wr actually had to "force" them to check on us, cos the inspector was years late. He was so shocked like "Did you actually call me in?!" 😂 We do work hard to keep everything in check, so we were really kean on showing off 😅
I had this experience last week.
Fun fact, he actually could have potentially saved the restaurant with that move without even knowing it. In the world of restaurants, it’s much better to have 1 slightly severe mark than like 5 minor ones, obviously this depends on a whole number of factors but that’s generally how it goes at least in the restaurants I’ve worked at, and since he offered him food the inspector more than likely overlooked a lot of other things that would have been a write up and possibly gotten them in more trouble, again this is all 100% different from place to place and also depends on the inspector and their personality, but it’s definitely possible, and with Pickles, I’m gonna make it my head canon that it’s true
Hehehehehe
The only time the health inspector came into the restaurant I worked at as a kid I was so High and had gotten the other cook high on the way to work. We (The grill and cook area) ended up with the Highest Rating for any station at that locations history...  Best part was the Manager busted us out for coming in high but couldn't send us home because he had no one else to work.  LOL! I never let him forget about it.
Everytime 😂
Health inspectors in my town are a joke. However whenever one of them comes into the restaurant I always ask them where do they not eat, I have struck off like 10 restaurants in my area that are still been running for years. Also I had a health inspector come in once and all the cooks spoke Spanish but she did not. She asked the owner to translate. He came back with her and she would tell him the corrections, and then he would just say the same thing over again louder and slower and angrier. It took a few minutes before she realized he didn't speak Spanish. That was one of the biggest messes I ever worked in
Oh yes this pure panic is amazing. I worked at Starbucks for 10 years and it took me a year longer than my coworkers to master the ropes because I insisted on learning to always keep my station(s) up to code while everyone else cut corners. Once I mastered the ropes I could move faster than everyone whilst efficiently and effectively keeping everything within my responsibility up to code. Whenever the health department showed up I was chillin' while managers and coworkers lost all cool. No one was appreciative of my efforts, not even the managers. I guess they thought I was a tighass? My customer service also outshined everyone's. I probably made everyone look bad and I was treated as such. I was fed up and eventually let the health department back without giving anyone a heads up and when the manager was done tearing me a new one for not trying to stall them or give the crew any warning I calmly said "Maybe everyone should just always be ready for inspection." I didn't stick around much longer and I'm sure no one but the health department inspector misses me.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
If i work there that man better show me some id or the only place hes going to get to go is a booth or a table😂
"heard" LMFAO
Pickles!!!
"Kitchen this way?"  "Who the fuck are you?"
pickles forgetting to put his hair in the hairnet while rico did is the best part lol
Lol! The owner where I worked was very  VERY O.C.D. when it came to the cleanliness of the resteraunt.  And thankfully so, I have all those habits with me still. Our H.I. was John, and our boss just invited him right in. "Find something, John, Please, so I can get it fixed." We loved our Guy. 🥰 We loved our lil family of resteraunt chaos 🥰
Not pickles working with the hair net over his eyes! 😂 This is accurate tho. Lol
At least pickles can blame it all on Nico 😉
Yep.😂😂😂😂
I've been casually watching video about China's quality around food safety and food prep, I am very grateful that restaurants are afraid of health inspectors instead of us consumers begin scared of our food.   Health inspectors areamerican hereos.
Not actually wrong
Nope. In reality they just walk right out back no prior heads up. & don't like to chit chat until it's over. Best believe,  yall WILL be having plenty to chat about soon lol
Love/hate health department. Love that they've prevented literally millions of foodborne illnesses and deaths. Hate because even in the kitchens ive worked that were pristine, they still nitpick silly stuff and create a stressful environment the duration they're there
Retail does this too, fyi
Wait why is pickles wearing nicos apron
I swear theyre gay for eachother
Get a pager and agree to a code number for the health department
I love pickles and Joey episodes
How have I not seen this one!!?!?!? Awesomely relatable
Pickles: Oh no! 😂
Too accurate lol
0:25 Pickles' name tag says Nico..............I'll have my cookie now 😊🫴
You will NEVER get a perfect inspection. Being that it’s a self funded organization bunch of scammers
The hairnet over his eyes 😂
This is spot on
Damnit. I forgot you left.
Love this guy so much truth in his story’s
Tr4ngsg3nder? Why? You should aling more w your clientele
Nico’s hairnet 🤣
I love ypur videos so much xD i work in customer service too so its extremely relatable and just makes my day lok
I totally heard that look😂😂😂
😂❤
health department showed up at our deli (which is more than a deli we also specialize in fried chicken n other shit) and I’m convinced the dude was paid off bc it is FILTHY back there. I can’t look at certain spots too long or I’ll never eat there again. Also a lot of the floor is broken. I’ve hurt my foot on it and had to go to the doctors. there ain’t no way we’re “satisfactory”
... It's not a rag never call them rags they are towels
How's the weather out there? I didn't notice.
Had a perfect run til the inspector saw my rubber boobies bracelet 😂
U can always tell in the comment section who has or has not worked in a restaurant or bar lol
Hahaha just like that!! Scramble and go clean and check dates. 😂
the 'HEARD' was SO GOOD LOL. drew. you spoil us.
Similar chaos happens in a hospital.... lol
Pickles no! You doomed them all!
this is exactly the experience I had when I was working as a chef and we had a health guy checkup, except in my country they're not allowed to do a surprise visit they have to inform beforehand which seems kinda silly
throw all the dishes on the dishrack, clean or dirty, can't get inspected if they're getting cleaned lmao
GET THAT RAG OUT OF HERE  For real seriously relate to this, eco lab gave us a surprise visit and were severely understaffed and i was the first to get the message because of it. Had to run around the kitchen stashing our rags anywhere that couldnt be seen and replace our cheap ass stolen from the home goods isle paper towel with our stores supplies towel LOL. Grear fun. Love the stress.
Nah, Terry or Joey should be walking with the inspector throughout the entire walk and distracting them from all of the minor things. That’s what my manager did
I did this with my store manager and sour patch kids. She loves them and took a handful then mid chew stopped and looked at me, looked in her hand, sighed and moved on to the next department.
The fuckin rags lolol why can't I have my rags
I worked at this awful little burger place when I was in college. The way I describe what it was like in the back is that when we hired someone new, one of the hardest parts was teaching what we actually cleaned and what we just "closed our eyes to." That place was disgusting. And somehow the health inspection was always around the same time (it was during the summer, so I was never part of it) and as that time drew close they required everyone to come in and deep clean that nasty place.  The other key part of describing that place is we had this guy in his 30s (college town, so older than we all were) who despite having a degree was stuck in this crap job. He was the main guy to work the grill. And sometimes, you would be up front taking orders, and he would just. Scream. Rage at the top of his lungs for a few seconds, then go back to cooking. It was a wild time, man.
We have a REV guy, not entirely sure what that means, but he comes twice a year, always surprise visits, and basically does the job of Health Inspector, but with a fancierz shorter name.
I also want to see a female health inspector. We have had both
The rags is lowkey real
We had a health inspector that docked us for our dishes being wet.....in the dish pit  Everything else spot on perfect they spent 2 hours looking and that was it 😂
This is absolutely accurate.
I thought it was Pickles😊 but the name tag said Nico🤣
For those who don’t get why the last portion was such a problem for the caller, one of the fundamental beliefs of Islam is that there will be no more prophets after Mohammad, and god doesn’t speak directly to anyone but prophets. The question “if you heard a voice claiming that it was god would you believe it?” must therefore necessarily be answered “no”. So when the caller at first said “of course” he was literally going against an unquestionable article of faith and was lucky to be given the opportunity to change his answer.   The part he either didn’t understand or wasn’t willing to admit was where both he and the person he cited would give the same answer, but he was trying to hold it against that person as if the answer wasn’t justified, but would find it entirely reasonable for himself. IOW he doesn’t apply the same level of criticism to his own beliefs as others. Such a remarkable self own. And the fact that he didn’t see it coming *chef’s kiss*
When the health inspector visited the restaurant where i used to work in the kitchen at he showed up not only before my bosses or anyone else from the staff was there - he showed up so early that only my Thai coworker who's not fluent in German that well was there. When I got there, she looked at me so confused because this guy basically just continuously told her about everything that was wrong with the whole place while she understood nothing and also wasnt even to blame for any of it. Like yeah thanks for coming before the kitchen opens but I can't imagine being alone w the health inspector at my workplace (where all of us weren't even really trained chefs or line cooks anyway) while he berates me in a language I barely understand. Let alone Swiss german:)
Same in healthcare when jcho shows up 😝
Heath department! Heard!
The health inspector showed up this morning and said he was happy to see me because I make his job easy. Bossman showed up 20 minutes later and made it harder than it should have been. Not my circus. Not my monkeys.
This is SO true😂😂🤣🤣🤣except asking to see their badge but that may differ state to state😂😂
Health Department people always tend to be the bullied loser, it’s like they are the police.
Our kitchen was impeccably clean. The inspector came thru the dining room doors just as a kid opened a package of cheddar cheese slices with his teeth. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Fuck Eco Shore all my homies hate them
😅😂😂
So many good little details... like drinking out of a to-go soup container 😂
The worse is when they come in on a busy day or rush hour. Then have to stop everything
the frantic fighting with the hair nets is so real 😭
How long has this guy worked in the restaurant industry that he knows ALL the shit that goes on behind it haha  He never misses! 😂
people joke thst health inspectors are bad news but the trashed bar i worked at always passed with high marks lol
As a current health inspector these comments are horrible
Chef should have yelled at Pickles a bit like "damn it Pickles, you know you have to wash your hands before you can cook after eating that candy, I need you focused here! And your hands are damn near pruning up!" Heqlth inspector would have seen that the Chef has standards and has enforced them in the past (you *know* you have to wash your hands) and would make it clear that Pickles is following the rules and it's negatively impacting his work
Had a cook hear that the health department was here.  He decides his apron is dirty and he should change it.  Not a bad idea, but he took the dirty apron off and set it on his cutting board while he changed into his new apron.
My restaraunt they would stand on the preptable with their greasy filthy shoes to clean the upper walls and dish pictures.
One time I had a jack ass health inspector furiously flipping through our recipe books for blue cabbage. The cabbage was indigo instead of straight purple, so he was making a huge deal out of it and came up w blue cabbage and started asking us about it. Like??? Finally the manager came up w some excuse.  It wasn't spoiled or anything it was just a shade darker than normal.   This is why grocery stores throw out ugly produce is because of idiots like that health inspector
the way i screamed PICKLES 😂😂😂😂
This is very true
The hair nets 😂
Pickles’ apron also says nico lmao
I feel like pickles did some kind of 6 figure programming job before he just “got bored” and went off to follow his dream and be a cook.
The hair nets! 😂😂😂😂
The damn rags always get ya!
Dammit, pickles lol
I find this video on the day the health inspector, ECOSURE and the fire department official come to check our fire extinguishers 🙌🏽
😂😂😂😂😂
My old manager pissed me off one day, don't remember what he did, but when the health inspector came I just walked him straight back to the kitchen without telling anyone lol. Never seen my manager look so flustered.
"put that rag in the bucket!" Yep.
Usually health inspectors are pretty chill if you actually run your restaurant correctly. A few weeks ago our walk in went out and an hour later the health inspector came in, but they were really understanding. They just made sure we disposed of the dangerous food correctly(which we would have done anyway) and came back on a better day.
Real ooop, kinda 😂
Hearing Pickles say “want some candy” after hearing who he is based off of is hilarious 😂
I’m a shift supervisor at this warehouse in Canada and one day someone from the ministry of labour came in unannounced, she’s not asking anybody to do anything in particular, she was just observing everybody, then this forklift driver get on his machine and right out of the blue he says to her “ would you believe that in 6 years of driving a forklift, this is the first time I’m wearing the seatbelt” and he drives away like like nothing happened 🤣  Well the company got a $200 ticket The driver got a $125 ticket and a warning from the company too 😂
We have a Tony button lol
that's -30 points instantly where I'm at (eating in the kitchen) and any place that scores under 70 fails the inspection
Insanely accurate you know how many times I had to pretend to use my slicer because it wasn’t cleaned up yet
The equivalent for this on ships would be when the Coast Guard shows up.
Would not eat there 😅
Make sure the ice machine is spotless. It’s usually the first place they look and sets the tone. If you’ve got mold or mildew, they’ll be looking hard.
At the restaurant I worked at, “86 bell peppers!” Was the code for the health inspector, we picked something we never had in stock anyway.
This is so true 😂😂😂
exactly how it's like when the health inspector comes to Starbucks
Come in and do a walkthrough of your facility and once the health department comes in it shouldn't be anything but a 2 minute stall to ensure everything is still good. Only issues ive had running a restaurant is the employees not understanding that the wet towels go back in the sanitize bucket and not sitting out growing bacteria after they've wiped something up. I feel like im back on repeat😵‍💫
The most stressful day for me was when the health inspector showed up early that month and I was the new opener. I was so nervous I forgot to turn the peans on for food. Terrible day 😢. My only write up. A lot of food wasted and a very embarrassing phone call to the owner.
Oh God this is me at my store 😂 we freak out fix everything and act cool like. "OH Haiiii what's up please come in" 😂
Shoulda brought out Nicole
The chefs drinking cans of monster and water out of quart containers is so accurate 😭😭
Your videos crack me up, as a former food and beverage employee
😂 as a former restaurant manager for 20 years. This is exactly what happens. Thanks for the laughs.
This is quite accurate.  Source: Am inspector in NYC
I jump right into the walk in with labels and a sharpie while front of the house stalls them.
I had a prep cook standing next to me when the health inspector said our walking temp spiked and did this happen often. Before I could say a word she said "oh yeah it happens all the time!"  😠
Was once taking over a shift at the bar and while I was cleaning the mold in the coffee machine the health inspector came up the stairs and asked which way the manager was. I answered and as soon as she was around the corner, the smile vanished from my face and I threw the mold in the trash, thanking god for the timing. 😂
I remember the health inspector was at the place I worked and I had been prepping the bacon. Well they ended up needing me up front so they called over the headset and I (since the health inspector was right next to me) went to wash my hands because of the bacon and I made sure to do it properly (even got complimented by the health inspector.) I just remember them coming back over the headset and yelling at me saying they needed me and I was like “I’m washing my hands” and they were like don’t worry about that we need you.  I remember thinking how lucky they were the health inspector didn’t hear their blatant disregard for basic hygiene
No eating on the line!!! Ha ha oh man the memories
When the health inspector shows up the first thing you do is make sure he's wearing all the health and safety equipment you are supposed to be wearing.
This is spot-on. I remember years ago when I was the Kitchen manager/chef at a popular steakhouse in my hometown, where, being a ski resort town there were multiple restaurants. The health department would do their rounds and would hit about 2 restaurants a week. Once the first restaurant had the health inspector show up, usually the first restaurant heading into town, the manager would tip off all of the other establishments and let them know they were coming so they would (hopefully) be ready. My particular restaurant always kept up on everything, so we didn't always have to freak out, but we still did!😂 In my eight years there, we never scored below a 97, but even with the tip-offs, some places weren't so lucky!
Lol so true
You are the Eddie Murphy of our generation lol
hostess = new character?
So accurate of course you have to make sure a sanitizing bucket is prepared too and make sure they see you washing your hands to the point your skin is cracking.
Put the butter in the reach in!!!😂😂😂
Check the sinks!! Soap and towels! Someone run to the walkin and pull everything off the floor!!
I keep forgetting that it's the same person doing every role. XD I love these shorts.
Ahh fuck, I have to stop vaping into the vent hood for a while.
We just straigth up yell health department in our kitchen when they walk in
I'm a barista and the health department showed up last week and the only people working were myself, my shift, and two newer baristas, so they'd never experienced this. He showed up and while my shift greeted him and they went over a couple things I got on the headsets and started whispering directions to the other two and they were freaking out like we were about to get arrested 🤣 but I told them to put date dots on everything, put the milks in the fridges, put away whip creams, wipe the counters, switch out the sani buckets, wash their hands a couple times white the inspector was present, throw away their water cups and it was so funny. The inspectors are usually really chill though
Anybody who has ever worked in the kitchen knows this is exactly what happens when the health department comes
Rules that Pickles broke in that one second:  1. Eating food on the Line 2. Eating food while being OVER food 3. Eating food out of his hands without gloves and presumably not washing his hands before/after touching his Skittles bag.  4. Not really an additional thing, but eating with mouth open. Just as bad as eating while over food AND on the line, but by eating mouth wide open it ensures the health dept. guy won't glance over it the same he may if someone is mouth-closed having a piece of chocolate.
I remember one day it was quiet and I was on a morning start so I decided to deep clean the fridges, when doing so in the fruit fridge I found mouldy stuff and a cucumber in the plastic wrap that had .. devolved back into water.   I had literally just finished cleaning everything out, dating everything when the health inspector walked in.   I'd been telling my manager for weeks the bar needed a good clean but they hadn't scheduled anyone on to do it and I made sure they knew that I was the reason they passed the inspection that day.
The scariest thing to hear in a kitchen. Is WHERE ARE THE DATES!🤣
I was a eating at a lil Brazilian bakery when the health inspector was in. A fly happened to get into the pastry case while he was watching 😂 that poor girl working the cash register nearly died trying to get it out while he watched clipboard in hand 😂😂
Fucking facts
"Do u want some candy?" 🤣🤣
Pickles wearing Nico’s uniform 😅
It allways pissed me off that my work knew when health deparment going to visit them so  everything had to be done.  IM LIKE WELL SHOULD YOU DO THIS SHIT ALL THE TIME SO U WONT FREAK OUT WHEN THEY SHOW UP.
One thing that many restaurants forgets to clean is the microwave. The bathroom, the floor, the walls, oven , and pots and pans may be clean but the microwave could give the restaurant a failing grade. Other areas incudes the sides of the refrigerator door and under the tables and chairs.
Can't forget about the drinks without lids and straws 😅
As someone who knows when the health inspector comes, you have to have your stuff labeled. Starbucks has a specific inspector who will check everything from food protocol and labels on syrup bottles. I was also super tight on that when i works pizza.
🤣🤣🤣
How we looking on that script for a sitcom? Seriously this is so funny and one of my favorites and I've pretty much watched a 100 of your videos.
Pickles was just trying to be nice
When all else fails and that one idiotic coworker just completely ruines every single thing at work finally pushes everyone's last button:  Shift Manager: "Sorry about him Mr. Health Department guy he's really a good person he's not all there but he means well."   Rest of the Staff: ".......Yessss, he's as special as they get'". 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The new dates throwing out drinks temping everything then the oh hi didnt know you were here classic
Lol everyone where the beard net NOW
lol! The health department is so annoying. I just don't care anymore nor does my manager or anyone else it seems but they are a pain in the butt. Hey as long as no one is getting sick and the prep chefs aren't dropping their knife and re using it we are good lol
in my country no one registers their employees so whenever a health inspector shows us everyone gets a 2 hour break while the owner is bribing the guy
I work in the kitchen of a Casey's General Store and man is this relatable. I'm always trying to clean as I can but my kitchen manager and I are basically the only ones who care. However, first time Steritech came and inspect while I was working the kitchen got a perfect inspection. Boy did I feel good after that.
Man yesterday we wew skrubin knooks and crannys we didnt even know existed because health was coming soon
*heard*😂
Nah, the quick heads up and then the manager stall is actually accurate. Had an HI walk in 30 minutes after opening and of course, nothing was at temp. Got the “health department” signal from the bartender and was in tip-top shape within 10 minutes.. thank you Felicia and Kira. You the real MVP’s..
Nailed it, drinking outta the plastic cup! They would be everywhere!
The fucking bucket! lmfaoooooooooo
The checkered short sleeve shirt makes me laugh the most, I think.
Why is pickles wearing Nico’s chef’s jacket? 😂
How’s the weather out there? I didn’t notice…..haha classic
It' "labels all the boxes for!!" for me 😂  When your cooks work daily we already now what's in the boxes and how old it is, plus we work FIFO and most things don't last more than a few days, or a day. so unless it's long-term labels is just wasting stickers and ink.
I’ve never noticed before but Terry and chef look really similar…
Everything was cool, arranged, dated, perfect. Then we had a booking of 8 that turned into 29 with 2 chefs "sick."  Me and one other guy. He spilt 800g of cauli wings covered in batter right as an inspector went into the kitchen.  He didn't know she was there. This poor woman heard an almighty "FUCK" as she had a solid wooden fire door smashed into her face as she held her own moment walking into it.  We passed.
It’s the slow eye roll to dead pan for me
The dates omg 😂😂😂
Fridgerator lol
ahh I love how they are passing time to get everything checked haha the  kitcehn staff goin oh Shiz love it!!
ahh I love how terry jumps in love him!!
Terry being all bubbly!
Pro Tip on health inspections.  NO ONE gets a perfect score.  The cleaner and more pristine a store and area is... the deeper they look for something wrong.  Best practice is to obviously follow all your health and safety guidelines with food... but maybe don't have a SPOTLESS floor or backsplash, food doesnt touch it, you can clean it up at closing... and if you get a health inspector they can give that the mark they are looking for and then get the hell on out the door.  Because if they have to start digging for something, they might find something drastic you forgot about.... like... an expired jar of olives that has been sitting in the back corner of the walk-in for the last 2.5 years... causing you to get a MAJOR food safety violation.
at my work we day dot at the end of every shift, in stead of just leaving it
Health Inspections are jokes 😂  Any establishment making real money, just pays them off. Same with the Fire inspector.  Last place I worked, we used to get a heads up a week before they came. That place should have failed both inspections. Every time. 🤣
Drinking out of the clear plastic jars is just too accurate 😂
We just had a health inspection at work, they literally walked in, glanced at our fridge/freezer temps on the front displays, looked around in a quick circle, thanked me, and left. Very easygoing
I once offered an extra burger that was a double ticket... They told me they couldnt accept the bribe.. I almost crapped that burger out without eating it
Do you know how good of an actor you have to be to make me legitimately forget that all these characters are one person and not the actual cast of The Bear?
There used to be this idiot where I worked that we only had because we were low staffed. He grabbed a raw burger patty with a gloved hand and then used multiple other items before changing gloves and all in front of the health department person.  Luckily he quit when our district manager asked him to portion fries after he came in 20 minutes late and he thought we had enough portioned, so when he was again to make them by the district manager he simply left without clocking out.
So true
I always pointed stuff out to the health inspector 😂😂😂😂 he wouldn't even look after so long especially when I'd throw in a few non-issues he gave up looking😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 but I'd do this to distract from the bigger issues like dates and stuff. Him being bothered while doing his job was our saving grace. He completely overlooked quite a few small issues 😂😂😂😂😂😂
That's exactly how it was when I used to work at the palms in vegas the kitchen when the health department would come it'd be a whole different world hahaha😂
LOL SOOOOOOOO relatable.
By all means
Do they not give 24 hours notice in the US? I live in the uk
You definitely need to have your own show 😂😂😂😂
So accurate
This is the funniest sOit I've ever watched!
This is 10000000% accurate lol
I've never minded the health inspections so much as the radical inconsistency and moody subjectiveness of the inspectors themselves. Take three different inspectors on a tour of the exact same kitchen at the exact same time and you'll end up with three totally different reports depending on the age, experience level, gender, and any of a thousand variables having sweet f.a. to do with the condition of the kitchen. Weirdly changes from state to state and different localities within a state too. The largest city in my state is on the northern side and there you can bring your dog into a bar or dining room no problem. Here in my smaller town on the opposite side of the state they'll have a coronary if you even allow a dog anywhere near the entrance.
I wonder if Waffle House gets stressed out with an inspection - lol - everything is right there out front for all to see always
I lived on St john in the USVI and everyone knew the minute the guy got off the ferry from St Thomas the health inspector was there. Non health certified employees were sent home, closed toed shoes came out, alcoholic drinks were put away, and I can't even tell you what they had to do with half the food. Fairly hilarious.
😂😂😂😂😂
Wetting my pants over here😂😂😂😂😂
I just remembered to put sugar babies on the grocery list.
One place, I worked at we called it Code Blue, and responded just like this.We had someone always out front running interference.
LOL! I love it when companies act like the health inspector wont drop by. Like do yall just forget that aany ody can make an anonymous call and have the place inspected earlier than you expect? Like, this right here is exactly why we practice keeping everything clean as we work. So that we dont panic when the inspector arrives. No need to panic if you already know everything is always up to par.
Fuckk.. this is pretty much my kitchen I run and the inspector is due any day be the new year
lol I remember those hair nets😂
This is so accurate
Same for when state comes to look at the schools 🤣😭
This is more than real! I'm having flashbacks!
I love pickles with my whole heart
Fuckin pickles
Heard! 😂😂😂😂
These comments are why I never want to know how the kitchen is run on a normal day. Just give me my food and let me live in blissful ignorance.
As a former food inspector, I've never seen anything more accurate in my life. 😂
At least one plate didn't have a hair in it lol
For real!!😅
So true!!!!
Better not have any food with around that food you're preparing
I love that the health deptment exists, but some of them can be a pain in the endzone to deal with.  Because your store can be IMACULATE but they hve to find SOMETHING to mark down.  I have only seen ONE score have a 102 score and that was with the serve safe certificate.
So, funny story about health department inspections.  When I started as a shift manager, I was dating a health department employee.  She always told me about 'suprise inspections' days in advance...  😂
As a chef for the last 25 years.  This us wholly accurate..
Then you got those ego driven health inspectors refuse to put on a hairnet.
Real life
I speak this experience! ❤❤❤
At first I thought he said "check your tits" 😂
Oh yeah, been there done that😂
It's really funny because even if things are up to Code, the panic still hits and there is a rush of making sure everything is done XD
This is so true
Used to run a very clean kitchen. HD would come in and pull the place to bits looking for something. Used to leave obvious stuff out by the end just to give them something
Having worked in the same restaurant for almost two years now, i can confirm this is the most accurate representation of this i have ever seen
Did you learn nothing from school!!! Fake heslth inspector drills like fire drills to avoid just this!
Omg this is so true
Literally had this exact situation when I was in culinary school
I actually like when the health inspector pulls up.  It’s fun to see the nasty people panic about the same things I constantly try to get them to do. I always say, work like they’re watching you so you don’t have to worry when they actually are.
Me panic cleaning for Thanksgiving
I used to work at a small chain fastfoot restaurant, this hit me in my soul.
How many wigs do you own? Lol
Oh man, kitchen snacks...
😂😂😂😂 ❤
Low key every place ever
The kitchen understands
Not my dishwasher dipping his hands in Sani water in front of the inspector, going from racking dirty dishes to pulling clean ones out… love the guy but I was floored when I saw that one.
The rags and the acrylic nails ..we had to pop them off if they came in
Nah cuz y tf they gotta show up at THE WORST TIMES!?! Like its RIGHT AFTER lunch rush n we r trying to keep up with cleaning the aftermath n u show up NOW?!?!
I can go either way. I know how infuriating a random health inspection can be in the middle of rush hour, but I currently live in a city with no health department and no health inspections. Yes, the capital city of Alaska, a major tourist destination, has no health inspections. I cant eat out anywhere. Everywhere is a massive gamble with food poisoning, I have gotten it a couple times. Behind the counter at so many places is literally inches of grease caking shelves and stoves, clogged pipes, overflowing sewers, completely unsanitary cross contaminated everything. The quality is horrible, everything is frozen, it's just disgusting.
The health department doesnt care much for cleanliness they care about temps. They dont even look at dates or lables just stick their thermometer in literally everything
I feel this too hard rn my resurant is awaiting our corporate inspector rn and were all so highly wound im surprised we havent killed each other yet 😭😭
A place I used to work had a health dept specific panic button
Nico is getting a fish slapped across his face for that one
People complain about the health department all the time but just listen to some of the horror stories that the inspectors have to tell and you realize pretty quick the reason we need them.
100% accurate
This is real life at McDonald's
Its a towel not a rag, a rag is what a woman is one once a month.
Recently had one, 😂 it was a little like this lol
Terry:  heyy how's the weather out there? Health inspector:   i didnt notice... which way is the kitchen?  SMOOTH AND SAVAGE 😂
Anyone who doesn't know. In kitchens all food has to be labeled with what it is. What temperature it should be. And what day it expires, also what day it was made. That's what he means by "i need new dates."
Actually laughing out loud through the whole video. So accurate.
We had a "health department button" in the hostess stand at my old job. First night it was installed no one told me what it was so i played around with it....gave 6 kitchen workers multiple panic attacks in one night 😁
how do you get the chef jackets? I never noticed they had their names on them. That’s amazing attention to detail what the fuck❤
In the 1970's, I was a waitress in a small city of maybe 2000 people, and it was over an hour's drive to anywhere bigger. The health department guy came and the moment he left, the manager called the  tree to every other place in town. A phone tree worked by him making calls to two people, then those two people made two calls each, and on down the line until everyone had received at least two phone calls.
Throw back to when I worked at a summer camp and we had to take down a fire alarm because it started malfunctioning/the batteries died, and then the following week before we had been able to fix it a counselor had to climb into the rafters to put it back during an all camp meeting before her got to that part of camp.
At one of the small restaurants I worked at I had a health inspector who just loved me. If she came in when I was working I would intercept her at the door and buy the back a good 10-15 minutes of my just asking her about her kids and life. She was a really sweet lady and I think she knew what I was doing but we both enjoyed the chats. 😊
When I started working at a hotel I didn't realize it was health department, so when some random guy asked about the bugs I was like yeah I saw a moth once. And he was like you could get into a lot of trouble for moths
what's funny about this skit (as if there ever isn't anything funny about these skits) is the kitchen has their bistro huddy cooks whites NOT ON BACKWARDS. are you like me? have you ever thought it weird that the cooks always seem to have on backwards shirts? i'm thinking: 'is this a kind of kitchen uniform? buttons in the back?' and then the H.I. shows up and now everything's right side forward {even before he shows up to 'look around..' } as if to suddenly be in compliance. anyhoo....
Hair net and backwards cap it can only be pickles 😂
Ah health inspections how I loved screwing over my management due to their incompetencies. And it wasn't just food service either. Every time I heard that we was going to get hit with an inspection I made sure nothing got done to make sure that we failed because the way I see it is if you don't want to fail an inspection make sure everything that needs to be done in order to pass gets done everyday not just on the day of inspection. Best part was that my manager knew I did this, but couldn't fire me without losing their job due to their bosses agreeing with me. Needless to say my managers at every job I had to deal with an inspector with hated inspection day.
Goddammit Pickles
Health department in the us is a joke
Rule #1 of health inspector arrival... NEVER strive for perfection. You leave a few obvious small fixable violations for them to spot you getting to, this way the demerits have credit for being done and the larger issues get skipped as they will keep eyes on those smaller details.
THIS IS EXAXTLY HOW ITS LIKKE
I used to work in restaurants as a cook and can identify a appreciate these shorts .
Pickles so precious 😅
Those visits really are like a military scramble
I'm the asshole line cook who complains about things not being dated/labelled. Head chef ran a tight shift and I really like things being in order, so we got along quite well.
Everything here is so damned accurate, lmao.
The amount of times when I was food prep at McDonald’s that we printed new labels to replace the old labels on the same food items. 😂
Aaaaahhh yes loved it always looked for everything. Nobody scored over 89. Look deep enough youll see eveything. Air vents always dirty. Surprisingly alot of grease on top not just a regular use but basically small puddle. Dirty microwaves
At our place "Andys home" means "get your shit together and behave" for cases like this 😅
This is so funny! My restaurant was run by a former health inspector, so we never stressed out at inspection time. This skit is exactly what I imagined “normal” restaurants to be like
This is so true!!😂 We would have a code that would print out on a ticket to let the kitchen know when they were there.
We got rolled by the health department one time. It was a nice restaurant, just an old building. They took 10 points off for a hole in the wall of the boiler room. An inspector had never even checked the boiler room before. Feel like the health department has a ringer that travels around and tears restaurants apart cus that inspector was gone after acouple months.
Literally had a food safety inspection TODAY. This is so accurate lol
As a former employee of a super sofititicated restaurant, I can confirm we did this all the time an inspector came around.
There's a saing once you get to food service.  "If you enjoy eating there, don't get a job there."
The kitchen equivalent to when OSHA shows up on the job site🤣🤣
Omg the 1 liter plastic container to drink water or other stuff is sooooo on point 😂😂😂
The accuracy of red bandana nico using a large plastic to go soup Tupperware container as a water cup 😂😂😂  perfect detail 👌👌👌
Pickles really trying to sweeten him up.
Accurate
This is super accurate
I forget this is the same guy in different costumes and wigs
towel? in the bucket? naw dog i got things to clean.
It's so funny because it's 💯 spot on...
Health department isnt the enemy
I remember when the lady came, she was from the health department. And it was kinda scary...you know what I mean?
My head manager's first preference is to not be on duty when the inspector shows.  Her second is to be working with me when it happens!   Last inspection, the inspector was asking me questions, and I answered them the best I could, with as much detail as seemed prudent. I was washing dishes, but stopped to give them my full attention. Quietly, the managers and the cooks were scurrying around to ensure everything was as perfect as possible.   I was being me.  I'd prepped my areas for inspection, then postponed doing more portioning for washing dishes, in case I got called out for a delivery. When I get a delivery, I tend to shove freezer goods in the freezer, and try to shove the fridge goods in the walk-in. But such hastily stashed things aren't labeled YET, so... Management was pleased with that choice, with my doing dishes, and most of all... distracting the inspectors while everyone else checked/fixed everything.
“Peanut Butter sandwich to go!” I’ll always remember my confusion during my first inspection
Pickles is wearing Nico's uniform.
Health inspector ain't wearing a net dock him too
Nothing like some good old fashioned American fraud! So endearing and relatable and blah blah blah
Couldn’t be more accurate.
Just cookin and cleanin
Yes so true! Facts
Lol "oh no"
My restaurant got shut down for a day by the health department but it was on my day off so all the staff that was there had to stay and clean. They actually had to replace the wall behind the dish washer because there was a roach colony. Honestly we’re pretty clean in general but we live in florida and roaches will nest wherever they can. Overall we just had to fix a few things and then we were back on track, and we’re more strict now on our side work and cleaning
So true 😂
Me yelling at everyone to label everythibg always because of that one time when they showed up and i was the one who had to scramble to label everything....
Pickles..jeez..go pacers
Ouch I’m I’m a save scumming explorer
Love how these are so comically accurate to the letter 😅😂
Pickles affording candy
Health inspector usually shows up during my shift, last time by some psychic miracle I just knew he would show up that day. Everyone was shocked by my immediate confidence when he walked in and greeted me
Just noticed... Pickles is wearing Nico's coat... He must've forgotten to do laundry & had to borrow one
He’s so good at this I really think all these workers are different people at this point 😂
Dude surpise health department inspections was the worst but i also always tried to keep the kitchen clean
In The Netherlands it's really useless. The Health Department doesn't come in unannounced. They are obliged to make an appointment to come in & check the establishment. But, this doesn't work, because the establishment can clean & be well-prepared for their visit.   So, the restaurant where I worked was a mess, ruled by rodents & a frying pan that spit fire 364 days a year. And only the day when the Health Department came around, it was (just) clean enough to stay open for another year. It's a real mockery here. K.x.
😂😂😂❤❤❤😅
Hella accurate
Pickles is a soulmate
I just realized that Pickles is wearing a Nico jacket.
The stalling done by the manager while the kitchen freaks the heck out is so real 😂😂😂
The I didn’t notice to the weather is crazy lol
As someone from the panhandle of fl beach vacation towns, this whole series is so familiar to me! Everyone ik has worked in restaurants and they sound just like that. I love when he says "heard" ! I never even realized why I use that so much or where I picked it up from.... oh and the roll tide crap! Lol ppl around here live for college ball!
Ugh this just happened to my restaurant Tuesday. There is literally always one guy who does something stupid!
💯 correct when health dept. Shows up  They use to usually give us a small heads up so we had time to prepare
I wish they came in the front door
Necos hair netttt😂
The Health Department was never much of a big deal, EcoSure were the people you need to look out for. They are RUTHLESS.
Lol changing the dates is a time honored tradition.
Working a meat processing plant, they had a usda inspector working onsite 40hrs a week most weeks.
Bro literal fear  when I was working in panda express. They told to literally burn the food if they come whike were cooking.
I'm the one who run for labels every time 😂😂😂
We would get audited every so often and we would only know what week they were coming in, and that they’d be there around 10 in the morning, and every day that week the managers had to come in hella early to make sure it looked presentable for the inspectors
Bro everytime the health inspector came it was when I’d forgotten to shave for a month and I was always on the report lol
The mad dash to fix all the violations before they come back 😂😂
Pickles😂😂😂 but really, this is ridiculously accurate 😅
Check ur temps turned into check ur tits in my ears 😂
Always when your fucking at peak hours
I’ve been to the hospital, it’s completely destroyed on the inside. Very interesting to explore
in qatar you wont know the health i spector since they come in as custo.ers and its a surprise everytime on different timelines. then they will send a police officers to take your whole shop down, give you a fine, and probably export you on the spot☠️
These bits are so real lmao
I ran such a tight ship when I was a manager that we were always inspection ready.  We alway got perfect scores every time and never needed warning.  Just do the job right all the time ffs. People are paying a premium over home prices and they deserve a consistent standard of excellence for keeping the team fed too.  Even if you shovel poop for a living, take pride in doing the job well.  Your work is a reflection of your character.  Be of good character.
I've walked into places with a grade A inspection and I'm just wondering who they paid off because there is no way they are that clean. Some inspectors are on a power trip, others are completely normal. Good luck figuring out until they are inspecting you.
Any other healthcare workers think of their job and JCO? 😂😂😂
We had this recently, i never seen the chef move so fast 😂
I was a server for 20 everything u say is right that ridiculous❤
what is wrong with the candy?
See you get him to cut you some slack tho when you explain Pickles was a minority hire (cause he “a special angel”).
It's crazy how a wig and an accent/dialect change makes this guy look like completely different people😂
LOL!!! This is priceless. I love all of "you"
Daycare employees when state shows up
Not my restaurant, not my problem, I just work here bud.
I had a buddy from hs i ran into years later eating at this local Mexican food joint. Said hey and ordered my food. Caught up with him a bit and he's a health inspector and just did one on the joint we were at. The fact he was sitting down and eating after his inspection made me feel a lot better about eating my meal 😂
So... sooooo. Not accurate?! What are you doing to us man! But seriously.  This is it.
So many spot-on versions of Gordon Ramsay there, and none of them look like him! 😂 Excellent!
Owner: "Oh, well, hello again. Nice to see you. Just one second." **Pulls out wad of cash** "Same as last time?" Health inspector: "Same as last time, yes."
I work in a hospital kitchen in Australia. The amount of different inspections we go through (regular health inspector,  government hospital inspector,  private companyinspections), its a surprise we get any work done.
Ive never been at work while an inspection happened but i did the day before it was scheduled, and my goodness it was a lot to do, like everything was filthy
Pickles is wearing a nico jacket.
This episode was brought to you by Essentla Bottled Water.
Damn i sure remember those days working at a restaurant its was crazy. Management would go ape shit crazy acting all strict all of the sudden 😂
God, I love your content! Lol
This is like when JCAHO visits hospitals. Everybody loses their shit and starts hiding stuff. 😂😂😂
Critical violation***
I was blessed in my restaurant career  The health department only showed up once at every single restaurant I worked at. It's kinda like basic math.
Such an excellent skit. I love how Terry just slides in front of the inspector.
#teampickles
We always kept it tight so we didn’t have to worry but our worst nightmare was ecolab if you know you know
Who grows up and thinks, “I’m gonna work for the health department one day!”
Oh Katie would had Lee Lee as a faithful SIL if she was nice to Leah.
"Health department." "Heard." I love how quickly they get on the same wavelength.
i just noticed that pickle’s chef shirt says nico lol
Hairnet over the eyes😂
NO EATING ON THE LINE, PICKLES!
Literally just had an audit today. She's always hella chill about everything and is more forgiving than the Regional manager who insits we clean behind the massive rotisserie oven I can barely fit behind.
F'N Pickles lol.!!
Unbelievable how true this is even in the uk
We all have to cram our drinks on the small fridge by the kitchen exit because of health codes.
The rag bucket😂 bane of my existence
The health inspector never did shit at my grocery store job. I don't even think they entered the kitchen. Mr. Demoulas definitely gave them some hush money.
I once got so sick of the really greasy large metal pot that the place stored and reused the fryer oil in that on a slow day I just went at it with the steel wool because I hated touching the thing.   I was praised later for cleaning it like. A day before the health inspector showed up and my god if I regret anything about that job besides not quitting sooner it was cleaning that damn pot so thoroughly.
It's amazing that after working in the food service we still eat  Out😂
I was a manager at burger king i know glamorous anyway we had a bk inspector like a health inspector but by the company we had the store perfect this 50 year old employee we had was cutting tomatoes i told her 3 times when shes done put em back she said ya i will everytime well she didnt she cost me a 100$ bonus she did it on purpose cuz she didnt like i was 30 years younger and her boss
love this video!
Damnit pickles it’s 15 minutes. Just stay in the walk in for 15 minutes
Should see it on a ship oh baby is it funny
I’ve worked in a restaurant for years. Forget the busy dinner shifts, those health department visits were the most stressed days
so acurate!
I was a waiter for a Christian summer camp. When the health inspector showed up one of the biggest issues with that apparently one of the guys on staff hadn’t passed the food handlers license test. He passed the test a couple days later, but he hadn’t passed it before it was time for him to start his shift for the summer. So they just let him work before he passed it even though they weren’t supposed to do that. Anyways, when the health inspector showed up, I remember we all were running around, trying to shove that guy to like a closet or something to get him out of the way to the health. Inspector wouldn’t see him. Because apparently the health inspector ask people for their food handlers license is or could ask anyone that, and obviously this guy didn’t have it. It was so funny.😅
Id love when our first location or the places down the street would call us and send the alarm we would be on fire lol.  One time we had an inspector show up but her thermometer was broken so we ended up throwing out about 80lbs of ribs and then got a phone call like oh my bad nevermind 🙄
The craziest thing i ever did was hide the charcuterie cabinet and hide two whole dry aging ribeyes.
Omg yes 😂
That nervous host energy was on point.
Somehow where I work always knows exactly when inspectors are coming, so this is more of a 2 day process
NICO SHUT UP 😭
While us who work the industry find this funny and relatable..at the same time STOP SHARING OUR SECRETS. LMAO.   Pickles shoving the rag in his chef jacket. He's too innocent. I almost don't trust him.   P.s. you're so talented to play all these characters and their all so different. Me and my chef fiance die laughing at these! 😅😂❤
Both Pickles and Nico are wearing a chefs jacket with Nicos name on it
Growing up is realizing that health inspectors are in fact the bad guys.
Bahahahaha, put that rag in the buck!!
We had a inspector show up today in the store and she just started wandering around when I went to fetch the manager. I was very annoyed because she wasn't supposed to do that and I could have gotten in trouble instead. We can get written up if we don't have them stay at the register until the manager shows up.
Happened to one of my customers when I was making a delivery to them. I came in all happy go lucky carrying my stuff in, and everyone was just stood there silently, I said "hey guys, what's going on? Why the long-" then saw the woman with clipboard in hand and hair net on... yeah, unfortunately the place got done for not having "sufficient" ventilation.
And that is exactly what we do when the health department shows up at our restaurant unfortunately they always pick we're very busy
that's me af "oh no!" lmfaooo 😂😂
imagine if we had the hands and time to actually keep things clean
i relate too much.
I was doing Fire Inspections for my Fire Department and ran into the local health inspector walking in as I was just wrapping up one of the restaurants in town.  I went into the pizza place next door, mentioned that it was going to be a day for inspections since I ran into the Health Department. It was pandemonium.  Later that night we got free pizza.
Anyone who worked in a restaurant will tell you that health code violations are rampant. That doesn't mean you get served food off the floor, but during a lunch rush the kitchen gets messy.
😂😂 the urge to stab Pickles is so strong
You want some candy? 🤣🤣
I used to work in a restaurant that was in an old historic house. The health inspector would come in and just stand in the back of the kitchen and fill out two or three pages on a legal pad of the same shit she got us for every time. Most of it was stuff that was never going to be corrected, like the drains in the floor being too small or the exposed air ducts in the ceiling dripping condensation on the line. Somehow we got away with never fixing that stuff. The house had a basement with a dirt floor where we kept several non commercial freezers and a bunch of dry goods which was totally illegal. We took the knob off the basement door and painted it the same color as the wall and they never checked. 😅
What do you call a group of chefs?   Heard!
😂😂😂
Pickles is a genious.
I work at a restaurant that always for an A. It was also helpful that one of the AM managers was accidentally a pro at getting the health inspector stuck in a long window conversation. If we forget to put a label on something or were already busy it would give us a chance to sweep. Anything that doesn’t hurt helps. The only place health inspectors actually say they enjoy eating at
Kitchen of an assisted living community we can hear it in the wind "State's here, Move Cover, Temps, MOVE!!!!
One day at my restaurant my manager came running to our server station frantically cleaning and telling us to throw away alot of stuff because the health inspector was here, he asked all of us if we had out food handlers licence and 2 people said no, so he told them to go hide in the restroom 💀💀💀
So true it hurts.
😂 this is just like nurses when JACHO shows up. God forbid you have a drink ☠️🤪
bro shit is too fucking accurate. throwing on the hairnets and making sure all are thermometers are accurate. Especially having things like drinks and shit in the kitchen
Pickles going “ohhh NNoooo!” 😂😂😂😂
I remember being on shakes. (Making concretes, shakes, and malts as well as all the custard dishes now.) The blender gets cleaned with water between every blend but the sides don't and we got points taken off because I was getting slammed and didn't have enough time to clean it more. Friday nights are so much worst.
bringing me flashbacks
Honestly, I've never worked in a restaurant like this. The area I lived in is so mobbed-up that the health inspector is all know the restaurant owners. Some of the filthiest kitchens I've ever worked in all had some of the highest grades I've ever seen outside of a franchise location.
Chef Joey: “Do you realize something? Let me tell you, if the health department sees those videos that you put on the damn internet, they could condemn our kitchen, and we would have to move out of it?”  Pickles: “I’m workin on it!”
God that happened to me one time. I had the store absolutely perfect (as always) and some dumbass sat their sandwich on the prep table we were already done with for the day.
Realist restaurant video ive ever seen. 😅
Nice amount of likes
How I feel at a local grocery store deli where they want you to use a tablet to check the temperatures at 5 in the morning before the store opens so no food cooked and nothing just cold stuff but no one comes in until 6
Health inspections should happen monthly, that way the lazy fucks that only clean when its time have to do it about as often as they should anyways. Not to mention it would probably multiply the job market for it by 5 times or more. Healthy move for everyone, except the lazy ass employees.
Kinda wish they would do surprise inspections but no they tell you a month ahead of time.
😂😂😂😂 I want to work here so bad!
The hair net over the hat 😂😂😂
*shows my badge* U.S Department of agriculture food inspection “state name” division jerry take me to the kitchen immediately before they tamper with evidence and i would be forced to close this rats nest down for good and get you blacklisted from the industry and your staff reported for unsafe food now show me the way
Hi
I can feel the stress from this scene. Convincing performance
Our health department isn't who we worry about, it's our internal inspectors 😬😅
the label thing was the best
I worked at a Cookout right after highschool, there was one time that the health inspector came and it was just a situation where we were 1000% going to be shut down for a LONG time if that person managed to walk in. The cool thing was, this cookout didn't have an indoor area at all and the door was locked under normal circumstances. My manager pretended to try to get the door open by wiggling the door and trally trying to sell it. The health inspector wound up coming by the next day, and we had miraculously gotten things to a point where we wouldn't be shut down 😂
Hah, "Hide that rag, hide that rag!" So good.
lmao at nico's hair net
What's even better is when the health department and upper management are buddy buddy so even when theirs something that could kill multiple people they just go back and laugh about it.
A random towel or rag will RUIN your day.
This video is so funny and cracks me up every time🤣🤣
The rags are too real
Our health department inspector ate at our deli. We were always on top of things.
So painfully accurate. I'm off today and I almost felt like I was at work haha
0:20, 0:21, 0:33, 0:34, 0:41
SO accurate 😂😂😂
Literally it
YES uhm, just uhm, just one second - so on point, it's hilarious
Mj is about to ruin the next decade for the Hornets because a rookie hurt his feelings💀
Working in food has made me care less and less about human life every year, like i work in a morgue.
This must be what it means when an interviewer says "you will wear many hats"...but in this case, wigs
As someone who used to work at a restaurant this is accurate.
This is us every money. 😂
HD might feel adversarial but in the reaility is just looking for dangerous infractions. It's like in high school with teacher threatning students they are going to repeat a year but only people with wild behavioural problems are really at risk.
I find it funny that Pickles’s uniform says Nico on it lol
Cooks drinking out of the large soup containers is the most accurate thing wtf
"How's the weather out there?"  "Didn't notice."
I've never noticed that Nico's long ass, booty length hair doesn't have a net 😂
Similar to how it was at wholefoods tbh
This is why you should always be ready
"We've talked about this you can't bribe them with candy if you've done nothing wrong."
Each video gets better and better! 😂 It’s so funny how every restaurant seems to be the same. 😂
My fridge stopped working two days ago 😂🤣😂 ded
I remember recognizing our health inspector when he came by, that's when I was a host at chilis..I would tell them over the headset as soon as he got out his car lol
Way too accurate
Best manager i ever had was at my first job. He was strict on new employees learning the proper way. Once your trained you didn't even get manager vibes. Do your job your own way as long as it's not a health or safety hazard. Be ready for GM to stop in or the health department.
Anyone who knows the business knows this is about 99% correct
Never panic, panic and they will dig.
I love how accurate this is
Health inspectors and corporate revs are all like this!
Or just send out someone to flirt with them
The city I work in recently had ALL of their health inspectors quit and no ones wants to work for them. Pretty awesome tbh
Who else wants to take Pickles home to dinner?
This dude and the shawarma guy both popped up outta nowhere and are all over my feed 😂
It's always pickles😂😂😂😂😂😂
I once had to run out into the dry store and clean the shelves and fridges with nothing but a rag and some sanitizer, since the Head Chef had the Health Inspector cornered by the bar.
Good old days
Sir im diabetic its a health issue
Funniest prank to play on back of the house
Omg exactly how we are at Whole Foods when Everclean comes😭
My male coworkers had points off for having nail polish on, I am a girl and had a full manicure with acrylics, they were very short and I kept them very clean but I didn't get points off for that. However, I did get points off because I held the ice bucket against the body of my clean uniform and the rim was nowhere near me. (By the way, The handle was broken on one side. I was recovering from shoulder surgery and had difficulty properly supporting the heavy bucket so I would rest the bottom on my hip like a very cold toddler.)
Ha so true even when you’re ready it’s a bit of a panic
It had to be pickles😂😅😂
💯💯💯
Inspectors are some of the most soulless people on planet Earth takes a special kind of person to want to try and take others livelihoods away
*ROLL TIDE!*
I've been in commercial kitchens for over 40 years and these guys are always spot on and hilarious.
Hilariously true 👍
I could riddle this thread with health dept stories… My sanitarian wasn’t LITERALLY FIRED FROM THE HEALTH DEPT THEN REHIRED FOR BEING ABRASIVE, HOSTILE AND RETALIATORY AGAINST PERCEIVED PERSONAL SLIGHTS… We would bleach the walls…she would insist we repainted them… Just as an example. Oh, and she hated other women…her words… Oddly enough she ended up with my personal cell..took over 5yrs of hell but we ended up finding common ground and becoming….friends(?)
Never fails! It's like running an Armageddon simulation type of vibe, every time we see the Health Department show up
Where i worked, letting the health department in the back of house before 100% verifying it was in fact the HD, would be points off if not an instant fail
So dont eat at bistro huddy
Health Inspector once complimented on how good the food looked and I was stupid enough to say “yeah it does” and not offer him any… my ears are still ringing from the berating I got from the head chef and sous.
If restaurants do maintain a high standard of cleanliness they wouldn't have to freak out when there's a health inspection and if health inspectors did their jobs there wouldn't be so many nasty restaurants.
Every restaurant I worked at new when the health inspector was coming. Really helped out.
Anybody want some candy 😂
So accurate for any business I've seen so far. People just skirt the edges of reasonable and it feels like everyone's in on it since the workers somehow know before they are even there to have everything cleaned up. I hate how people announce themselves days in advance. Wish they'd just do surprise inspections so people would do their damn jobs.
Drinking out the quart container just hit me in a place I haven't felt since I hung up the chef jacket
This literally happened when they came in. He stormed in trying not to give my manager a second to rush everyone. Manager kept asking people really quickly to pick up things while he was in the back. Once the health inspector left the manager dabbed up the chief and said "thanks for bullshitting man"
I don't have any clue.  Never worked in a restaurant . What was the problem about giving candy?
Lol. We knew way before.
At a different grocery store, I had turned off the hot water at the handwashing sink because it was leaking. The health department showed up and it was a critical violation. I was asked why I did it, I explained that I was so used to my old store manager not fixing things and wanted to save the company money. He asked what store I was talking about. I told him. He agreed, took off the critical violation and understood.  The first time the health department came into the store that I became the department manager of the seafood department, thought it had been shut down. The previous department manager was so filthy, that you could smell the seafood out in the parking lot. She had one of those upright freezers that was broken, so she was placing ice into it to keep the frozen fish cold.  I cannot recall what minor violation that I had, but the inspector wanted to use my outlet for his laptop, I quipped only if you give me 100% on my inspection. The store manager was standing there glaring at me. The inspector said fair enough and took it off.
I worked in a grocery store and had two stories about health department visits. 1. The lady was inspecting the bakery and the bakery manager when nervous will talk in a high-pitched voiced. I heard her talking to the health department inspector, I slammed open the backroom doors and told Dorrie, that the health department was here, act natural. I pretended to see the inspector, said, oops, too late, and backed out of the department.  2. Same health department inspector but was just checking the eggs for cracks. I asked her if I could tell Dorrie, the bakery manager she was there. She asked who she was, and I mimicked her voice. She okayed it. So, I called Dorrie and told her. Dorrie said, "Ah frick, stall her!" The inspector heard her and laughed and told me that even though she cannot inspect the department, she might just walk by and ask if she had been stalled long enough. The inspector and I had such a long laugh after that.
I was working and the health inspector walked in with nothing in hand but a thermometer (I didint see it) he said nothing and tested evrything. I genuinely thought that this was some random guy who just walked in until he told me we passed and gave a few critics and left.
When I worked at my first restaurant my chef just snuck up behind me and threw my hair into a hairnet, put a hat on me, and told me to act natural. I didn't even know it was the health department until he left.
Put that rag in the bucket 😂😂😂😂 so accurate
Not the dirty towel in his Chef jacket 🤣
Chefs arent allowed to eat?
DRAIN THE DISH SINK!  WHERE ARE THE LABEL STICKERS!  BLEACH BUCKETS! GLOVES!
Perfect example of how the chef reacts to prepare for a health Inspector that has to come unannounced
I'm glad that most places are like this to
The most stupid things was the part were thwy have to hide their water cups.  In my state we kept out watter bottles with us. Then, a new law passed wrebwe had to keep our water bottles outside of the kitchen, so we had them all on a tiny table it was so humiliating and dehumanizing.  Like, really l can't keep my water bottle with me,but leave it outside. WTF, I'm? An animal? A slave?  Then, I worked in another restaurant werebwe couldnt even drink water while cookingn. Nor were we allowed to keep the water "outside" we all gad to drink in our non existent breaks or drink in secrecy.  Another reason why I left the restaurant businesses. Youbare treated like the "help" (slave).  I was like, ARE YOU F*CKING SERIOUS! When, i was told thay we fould not keep water with us.
So accurate.
It's always a pain when health inspector come. Especially when it's the middle of a rush and you're afraid you're not cutting the veggies right or if the gloves are changed frequently enough. Or if the fridge drawers at the line are cold enough even though they're being opened nearly every time a ticket comes in
the guy had his hair net on his eyebrows 😳
accurate !!!
Lmfao this is so true tho 😂😂😂
The hairnet over the cap 💀💀
Our health inspector came last week. They showed up an hour before we opened and told me the food in the hot well wasn’t up to temp….yea, we are not even open and it’s heating up…
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
The health inspector at my job came by to let me know he'd be coming back to do an inspection in an hour
You know the little jelly packets for breakfast? Yeah health inspector marked us for them not being organized
Bro its liget like this where i work they literally stashed a tote of cheese, tomato and onions  in the office They forgot about it i found it 20 minutes after they left when i needed more tequila
Can confirm this is exactly how it goes down😂😅
Worked at 24h subway for a short bit. Had health inspector come in because somebody reported cleaned sauce bottles on the floor in the prep area. Thankfully he came after I started my shift I was called in to cover since I did a walkthrough checking floors, cleaning my prep area, and getting everything ready for my shift. Reason I did this was because on graveyard I worked solo and customers would poke their head into the back room to ask for subs. I made it into a habit after a few years to keep it clean and clutter free. So inspector pops in and starts asking about things, I showed him the offending bottle,  explained that it was indeed on the floor, showed him where it was, and explained how it happened. Poor newbie shift manager was deer in headlights freaking out, assistant manager was just letting things happen. Inspector drops a white rag on the spot, walks to the doorway and chuckles. Said no way a customer was able to see that and had to be an employee trying to stir up trouble. Told him if he wanted to verify what I told him we can show him the security footage. He declined, said the place looked damn clean for an unannounced visit and trusts us. Him and the assistant manager went into the office to talk. She had a big fat grin on her face, I got a free sub of anything I wanted on it later. Btw 5 time meat feast sub is massive. Had sandwich meat for a week at home.
The "heard" is so real
Lmao. This is so accurate.
We just got inspected by our "pre health department" company so this is especially relevant rn 😂 Funny story actually, one time everyone started whispering that the company had swept in, so we started the mad dash for labels and temp logs. Ten minutes later we hear "oohhhh EcoLAB is here, not EcoSure" Y'all when I tell you the entire kitchen breathed a sigh of relief strong enough to generate an F4 twister
Im in pest control and thing i see in restaurant kitchen could het health department shut down on the spot once they read my work order history. There some places i will never eat
When I was a restaurant manager I passed this short around the entire staff, FOH and BOH. The FOH and BOH unity was never stronger than in that moment.
God Da__it, So&so, PUT ON THAT BEARD NET!
Whoa there buddy Mechanics use rags, cooks use towels.
That darn Pickles! 😅
Cleanliness is next to Godliness
I watched this video so many times... and I only just realized that Pickles is wearing Nico's shirt.
Ah yes, I remember those days
The words every food emplyee dreads “health department is here”
Yes gotta have rags in buckets and labels on buckets. OMG THE LABELS. Labels everywhere.
Pickles😂😂😂
Me and my regular health inspector at my Dominos are besties. She walks in and we always have a good time, have never scored less than a 99%.
I cost my team a few points on last inspection because I brought them milkshakes and set one of them in the wrong spot, which the inspector noticed. 🤦‍♂️
I work at a daycare and this is us when state comes haha
Eating behind the line😆
Having worked in the food industry, this is 100% real
I would usually be the first to see them. I would run to the line and yell to the cooks to put on gloves, then run to dish to find tongs for lemons. I'd throw away any employee drinks and food on the never used service bar, then text the manager in the office.
I sighed right with the chef 😅😅
Look, the chef’s shirts all have their names on them! That means a complete costume change each time, not just a wig-swap. Bravo, sir!
I love you Pickles!!🥰
Reminds of when The Joint Commission/CDPH/Fire Dept  would show up at the hospital 😅😂😅😂
I know this isn’t as comparable but as a chipotle worker I know how cringe is how to be to change the label so the cheese is one day good past it’s expectation date.
Yup ... 100%
Conflict of interest 🤔
Gloves! Health man is here! Gloves!
Regulations like this dont create a minimum. They create a maximum. No one is going to go above and beyond (or even really care) about safety if they are being told they have to in these specific ways. Its the difference between your mom asking you to clean your room, and wanting a clean room so you can be productive.
This is so accurate. Also I love how he really sells all these characters! He's so good
Every restaurant I’ve worked in. Health department shows up and we pull together like never before. Scramble guys!
Lmaoooo sooo true 😂😂😂
Mood Dude
Pft, that stuff should be done every day regardless... If you start when the health inspector shows up, you're screwed
Before we had a lock on our dumpster, people would come and throw their trash into it even after we posted signs saying it's not allowed and the one night someone threw a whole ass couch in there and no more trash fit. The next day the health inspector came and say the the lids couldn't close and thrash bags were outside the container. We received a nice little fine of $500. We immediately switch our dumpster for one with the locking bar
OMG...I don't know if it was intentional or not, but offering the health inspector candy and eating it while on the line/at the pass is a huge no-no IIRC. Kind of a 'no outside food or drink' rule. Hilarious as usual! <3
Why is pickles wearing nico's jacket?
The realness that hit when “…pssst..Health Dept. is here. *& everyone loses their 💩!* 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I saw a chain specific inspector looking at the dumpster one time and was like "they're Ecosure!" And proceeded to swipe all drink cups on the counter into a trash can.
I remember I used to work at a hospital kitchen and we were just told that inspections would happen sometime through the week. So I was hoping it wouldn't happen on my shift. 2 days later, it was my shift they picked. Holy fuck that was scary, 5 different people came with clipboards looking everywhere. They asked me and the chefs questions. And the funny thing was they were surpised by a cutting board we had. Standards are there are 5 different colored cutting boards for a kitchen. Used for different types of food. Thing was, our hospital only carried 3. Red for all raw meats, even tho were supposed to have different ones for chicken and fish. Green for produce. And white for dairy. But our kitchen had a 4th one which was purple for allergens. Our department had more patients that had allergies than the typical department. So we carried it. So the inspectors asked me "Can you tell me what the different colored boards are for." And I told them and when I got to purple, they were all surprised. "Wait, for allergies? I didn't know that."  THEN WHY ARE YOU IN CHARGE OF INSPECTING US?
Same energy as when DSS would come to the preschool I used to work at 😂 know your numbers, know your numbers!!!!
The accuracy of the total back of house breakdown that occurs when a health inspector visits….
Pickels nailed it! Now he'll be looking for big things and not the little things.
ITs like audits at my work! XD
My bf & I worked under the table at a Chinese restaurant & every time they showed up we just left until they did.
😂😂😂😂😂
Ayyy pickles
Its the same everywhere I see😂
Yep that was literally us in KFC when we knew the department was coming to have a little visit
I was lucky enough to work at a restaurant that makes enough money to bribe the health inspectors
I ran many Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly and the stress level is always high eventhough I do my daily walk-thrus because you never know if someone dropped the ball before you caught it and as the Executive Director, you're responsible for everyone and everything. 😊
Gd health department wrote me up for having my lunch on the back bar fridge . It's not like bartenders get a lunch break. 😒😡
Ummmm…it’s not a rag, it’s a towel. If you know you know
Somehow we would always get tipped off in advance. Like everywhere I worked I don't know how. We never had a surprise one like this.
OMG so accurate 🤣
😂😂😂100%😂😂😂
Anyone else forget sometimes that these are all the same dude?
Q? At the Very end does anyone hear  chef say, "you idiot"?😅
In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth. He created humans too to have a relationship with Him. That's our purpose as humans that have a relationship with God. Sin, however, messed that up because it made us imperfect and imperfect creatures cannot have a relationship with a perfect and holy God. That's why we so oftentimes feel empty, unsatisfied and unaccomplished because we're not in relationship with the God we were created to be in a relationship with. But that's where Jesus comes in. Jesus is God's son and He came down to earth in human form to live the same life we do yet unlike us He never sinned. Jesus is perfect. Yet despite the fact He is perfect He died on the cross for our sins and sacrifice Himself for us. The punishment for our sins is death but because Jesus took that punishment for us if we put our faith in Him and receive Him as Lord and savior we can be reconciled to God and be restored to that relationship we were created to have. And we can be sure that Jesus is the Son of God because on the 3rd day God raised Him from the dead and in that He defeated death and the grave, proving that He can do the same for us if we put our faith in trust in Him. That's how you get to Heaven. That's how you become full in your heart. That's how you become reconciled to the God who created you.
Health department the last mfrs I want making my shit. Lol
Working in the basement gave me time to run into the walk-in and check everything before the inspector got down to that floor. Such memories.
Eating on the line. Ughhh pickles!
I just realized Pickles is wearing Nico's uniform. love the details lmao
This is so on point.
I had a health inspection during a rush one day and the insidious comes in and stays looking around. He looks at me and says "busy hah?" me 'oh you know. Just the lunch rush and I'm down a line cook. Nothing major' "everything looks good.. Nice walk in. Impressive labeling system. What's that?" 'just a plate with an error. Gonna go to one of the servers'  them "can I order one to go? With whatever mistake was made. It looks good." Safe to say they didn't notice all the coffees on the line 😂
the mad dash when the health department comes 😂😂 ah the stories
Every fuckin time! I used to work with this GM tht was tht kinda manager (we all are) and now he went back to school ann he's our EcoSure guy lol... I always bullshit with him while they fix things up.
😆😆😆
This is so accurate
who noticed that Pickles shirt had “Nico” engraved on it??
Aha.. I've never gotten anything other than 100%. I think the only rule that ever gets broken is food on the drink cart, but that's an easy fix.
I just knew it would be Pickles
This is great
They ALWAYS find something bro they said the frier basket was slightly dented and if it somehow shattered and a piece of metal broke off into someones food it would embed in their gums and make them lose their teeth. On his final destination shi
I honestly don’t think health inspectors do anything. I work on scales that print labels for a bunch of stores. El ranch La azteca and a bunch of smaller mom and pops meat / fish stores. Every time I work on one and have to take the case cover off hundreds of live and dead roaches scatter all over the counter. Beware
You want some candy...HEALTH DEPT. EEEKKKSSS
Health inspector shows up and my boss is just like "fuck it I could use a break anyway" 🤣🤣  Ended up getting a $1000 fine and didn't need to close 💀
Honestly, the company compliance inspection was way worse than the health department, but that’s cuz we had a really clean store. The only thing that sucked was we had to drain the bar sinks so we couldn’t wash any dishes while they were there.
Normal ppl don't even understand the teamwork that happens when they walk in.
the hairnets are too real
This is so incredibly accurate 🤣 although where I worked the restaurants along the strip would all call around to let the others know when they had got inspected lmao.
Health Department stops by *doom music kicks in*
This is exactly what it feels like
So true
Health department is very much a necessity.   But at the same time screw them. They can be some of the most pedantic infuriating ducks at times. Once had them come in and literally perfect inspection. They find 1 box of strawberry’s out of 3 trays that arrived on my morning order that was bad(as in it was bad before it came off the truck and was placed in our backstock fridge).   “Well, found it what we were looking for”.   Never wanted to punch someone so much before.
Not the same but as a 'fast casual' restaurant supervisor this is exactly how our health inspections go.
My first experience with the health department at work was so memorable. I hated that place so much and I knew it was in fact not up to code. My manager was off doing something and my older coworkers were working so I happily took the man wherever he wanted to go. The city owned and managed the building so I figured they needed to learn a lesson.... plus it was pay back towards my boss. She wasn't happy, but boy was the rest of that summer a quick one
This is EXTREMELY accurate 🤣the utter panic and scramble and the "HEARD"
Quickly put fake dates on everything  yep!!!
The realest shit in the world.
This is exactly how Pizza Hut is ran for health inspections, only difference is you’d have to throw away the 47 expired items in the walk-in.
Worked in a restaurant for some years. Truest shit oml. 😂😂
I've never understood why you couldn't have a drink when washing dishes lol
Our KM used to say "Federales!"
So true
Oh man I feel this trying to remember the date from 2 days ago so it's not all just today😂
fuckin pickles
You know it's true. I try not to think about it too much tbh! Brilliant sketch as usual guys. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
It is sort of a violation to eat in the restaurant kitchen because you might forget to wash your hands after and touch things.
Well I've been there and it worse is every time you work FnB industries..well the part last minute is sssssoooooo....good let it go out of energy until Wake up at hospital it's saying it just was a dream..And doctor said take rest off day.. suddenly it turn out you have been Fireddddd...😢
I felt this one personally have been getting suprise audits for 2 months going into 3 😂 and tlwe only got a handful of us that are trying bro when i come in im sitting at the damn printer punching date tickets and cleaning the kitchen. 😂
This is us in salons when state board comes in. We always pass but it’s the authority they hold to fail and shut us down that instigated ensued panic!
Very very accurate
Joey looked soooo mad 😭
I felt that when the fridge stopped working 😭😂
Worked as a line cook for 6 years. Your videos are way too accurate 😂!
Pickle need to be beating and left with the trash
Why is pickles wearing Nico's coat.
Hide the rags is definitely real. God forbid we use towels for anything
Oh pickles bless his heart
Drinking out of the deli cup! Lol point on
The madness in the kitchen isn’t even the half of this 😂
My boss would literally come through and throw everyone's drinks away when the health dept showed up 😂😂
This is so accurate lol
This is so accurate 😂
Even if your kitchen is the cleanest in the state the health man has to find something, i suspect its to make it look like they are doing their jobs.
Where I work we passed a health inspection. Not sure how on account of having not hot water in the building minus the kitchen. So that means no hot water in he bathrooms. Our roof leaks in 10 different places, we have a kerosene water heater that is attached to the kerosene heater that heats up the store. So if the heater isn’t working we also have no hot water 🙃 with all of that we got an A
Bro it’s never that serious
Just like when Joint Commission shows up at your local hospital.
The candy part irritated me to no end for no reason
This is so true🤣🤣🤣
Meanwhile I work in a grocery store and the health inspector walks by the wall with mold growing all over and doesn't bat an eye. We had to file with OSHA over mold concerns for them to do something. They power washed and painted over with marine paint, like that fixes mold.
Listen, Aaron is playing it smart. Health department is always looking for something to get you with. Give them something small to bitch about and they won't find the bigger shit.
anything w tomatoes were thrown out immediately 😂😂
Excuse for the candy: Low blood sugar
Why did Pickles also have a coat that said Nico?
Dang, he dresses as a girl better than I ever will 😭😆
Every company when the audit shows up
As a health inspector I can confirm this is accurate.
HD was our code... and boy the Kitchen hated their surpise visits. But we always came out ok... I as the Manager made sure the Kitchen was actually CLEAN and the people in it at least stuck to the basic health standards. :P Still makes everyone nervous as fuck when they show up.
I was working the host stand when a health inspector came in. I just said "Okay do what you have to do!" And learned very quickly that managers do not like surprise health inspectors greeting them at the kitchen door.
In California HD can't inspect until a manager present. It just so happens, the manager is always an hour away.
At my first job as a teenager, I was so spooked by the health inspector she said "hello" and I turned and speed walked tf out of the area so fast. Got laughed at at the next day's staff meeting, and I deserved it 🤣
I wanna be a health inspectors to fuck with peoplen
I would slap Pickles silly. 😳🤬
What's wrong with candy I don't get it?
I'm going to need to contact a lawyer for the ptsd this has given me
So funny😆
That looks about right, everything about it it’s legit 😂 from the beginning to the end. 👨‍🍳 👩🏻‍🍳👨🏻‍🏫
It’s amazing how he h simulates chaos.
Definitely 💯 real vibes
Is the candy thing bad because it couldbe considered a bribe or why?
Damn it pickles... so close
Why is this so true? 😭😂
Joey with the hair net over his eyes 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
we had a health inspector come in while I was sobbing on a bucket in the kitchen. in my defense, it was my third week in and I was 16. also school had just started.
Damnit Pickles
You ain't lying I work at a popular restaurant n we ran around doing shit before the lady walked in
Our health inspector was so cool. She’d come in and “check her emails” at a table for 10 or 15 minutes before starting inspection
And there's Pickle saving everyone's ass. giving him the little demerits Pickles so they don't ever go after the big demerits
"They're not rags, they're towels!!! Dates, DATES!!!!"
Who is your favorite character?
i work in a kitchen and obsessively check labels every time i come back from my off days simply because people are dumb and our version of the health inspector on crack visits every few weeks
Sooooooooooo accurate !!!!😳
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Totally 😅
When I worked at Dominos, corporate  would do random inspections on occasion. If another store in the franchise nearby got a visit they'd call us or vice versa to give a heads up. We kept the store really well but always nice to have a little extra prep 😅
SO accurate
I never understand, working st a nightclub, when we have visits from people like this.. my boss runs around like a headless chicken asking me to do everything I do anyway, I hate it. I don't do anything differently, I do it properly to start off with lol
Are you still working at a restaurant?
Oh no!!
It’s impossible to not love pickles
I love your vids they are so so good and accurate I can't help but laugh please keep ot up
As a cook, Can confirm
Damn it pickles 🤣😂 tho that’s always me I’ll be in the middle of snacking not heat the whispering cus I’m partially deaf and get caught immediately 😅
Man, I had to look for this particular short again because that was us yesterday in the bakery department. My manager got a laugh when I sent her this.
I wonder if he ever is at home and is confused about who he is for sec.
You should do a sketch where the health department guy shows up to dine.
So accurate
I wish Bistro Huddy was real! 😭❤️❤️
I actually work for a well known supermarket. And YES that's how we act. We scramble once we know their in the building. Trust me we all know what's about to go down.
I once asked an inspector if she wanted a glass of water because it was the middle of summer in NYC- thankfully she was super nice and told me it wasn't allowed without writing it up.   Can't even offer them water on a scorching day without it being considered a bribe 😵
HIDE THE SOUV VIDE
Except for my station and stock. I was on point......to a fault.
This is exactly how it goes too
“Ecosure is here!” Is the most terrifying words you’ll see printed out on the back door. BEV NAPS FOR EVERYONE AND I SWEAR TO GOD COREY IF THAT WATER DOESNT HAVE A LID YOURE A DEAD MAN
The waffle house has found it's new host.
The Waffle House has found it’s new host
The Waffle House has found its new host.
The Waffle house has found it’s new host
Why does Pickles not have his own jacket?
Oh pickles, bless his heart.
Anyone that doesn't work in restaurants and pubs thinks this is a joke.  Those who have worked in restaurants and pubs know this is real af 😂
Prep Cooks at home not knowing their jobs on the line for walk-in QC labeling
Don't ever call Pickles an idiot. Pickles is a pure soul.
Ah the health department check.... I swear they get people who know nothing about food to do these checks
The last health inspection I went through as a FOH manager the kitchen manager said he needed to get the records he was being asked for out of his truck, pretended to hardly speak English, then drove off and wouldn't answer the phone 🤣 it soon became apparent why, the kitchen was gnarly.
When I managed a subway they had an inspector come in once a month, it sucked! The guy was a total douche who wore short shorts and would put one of his legs (foot I guess) up on a chair while he talked to you 🤢🤮
Been there, done that and I'm glad that the one inspector was a good friend of the owner.
This is accurate
It's true. I've worked at 3 different types of restaurants. Fast, regular, gourmet. They are all the same. Scrambling to get dates on food.
TERRY!  need to give the health dept guy the *ol' Tim flimflam! 💖
👍👍🔥🔥
We always throw some gloves in the waste bin, to make it look like we've been using gloves.
I get this is a comedy skit, but I swear to God, if that happened in my place, that guy is in some BIIIIIG trouble  Idk if y'all know, but the Health Inspector could literally close the whole place for the "you want some candy?" question, if they're a dick or a stick in the mud  Essentially they can write "kitchen staff eats food inside the kitchen risking cross contamination" or "kitchen staff risks cross contamination by bringing processed foods and eating it near food for the customers risking cross contamination" which both are a BIG no no and can get the whole place in a LOT of trouble, and if someone's having a particularly bad day or is a complete dick about it they could even make legal charges against the place for having unsanitary conditions in the kitchen, which would legitimately pose a massive threat to the existence of the whole restaurant (and if it's a small chain, the entire chain)  So yeah, please don't offer candy to the health inspector, hell, don't talk to them outside of the answers you're supposed/expected to give when prompted by them or your superiors, keep things as simple and vague as possible unless asked to clarify, and for the love of all that's holy, please don't do stupid things like that XD
Best ever so accurate
I'm proud to say I work in a restaurant that manages to pass our health inspection every time, with only a 15 minute warning
God damn it Pickles!
The health department can’t shut you down as easy as they make it seem. But they can fine you up to $300.
Oh Pickles 😂
I refuse to wait tables again but I would work here for sure.
Pickles jacket saying nico 😭
Yeah the health inspector only showed up once to my only food working job. Place was a pigsty anyways so him picking my dishwashing apart as slightly lower than average is a blessing. Too bad all other job fields suck ass so I'm just stuck jumping from one to the other.
Easily my new favourite channel
😂😂😂😂
I work at a pizza place where the health department hardly ever comes. Why is having candy bad?
Lol! I’m not a server anymore, but I always tell people who haven’t worked in restaurants that if they saw what kitchens that have an A rating look like they’d probably never eat out again. Lol. I think when you work in a restaurant you become sort of desensitized to it. I mean, the busier your restaurant the harder it is to keep everything perfect no matter how hard everyone is trying.
Love you
I am a cook at a hospital and this guy hit all the major notes. Biggest one for us was rag in the bucket everything else we always do.
I felt the "Put the rag in the bucket!". Lost points because not all of our rags weren't completely submerged in our sanitation buckets.
🤣 "just cooking and cleaning"....a likely story
My gosh, these clips are TEXTBOOK!
You forgot the server willing to take a hit for the team who selflessly, ruthlessly and AGGRESSIVELY flirts with the inspector for a few extra minutes
Damn it Pickles!!
We have the cleanest kitchen, so much so that Health Department has to nitpick to find something, yet every time we freak out when they are there. Without fail, sudden panic the entire time.
What is the wig budget for this show??
Bistro Huddy should be applauded for offering employment opportunity for the neurodivergent... aka, Pickles 🤗
Pickles come on😢
this is the one time you appreciate the manager’s ability to stall things getting done and their bullshitting strategies
when is cloning technology gonna be a thing so then drew talbert can clone himself and make bistro huddy a real place and the staff is literally just all clones of him in wigs
I love this guy … even though I’m a Vol 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I swear to God, Pickles
I don’t care what you guys think. Pickles is my favorite ❤
Hate the health department 😤  Gunna barely pass tho bc of team work lol
🤣
I went to a restaurant and got served by a transgender waiter it felt very uncomfortable
This was the first episode I ever watched on your channel. Absolutely love the content. And the quality only improves
this is too true!
Damn it pickles haha
So true, except my manager just bitched at us and didn't run interference lol
This one was totally on point.
Absolutely love these videos it makes my day to smile and laugh thank you so much
Just noticed now how pickles is wearing one of nikos possibly old work shirts
6 lashes for pickles I don't care if he is really the Main Character he needs the discipline!!!!!!!!!
Damit Pickles
drinking out of the plastic containers is accurate. I don't remember using those for anything other than drinking pop.
Worked retail for 6 years. Feel this vibe so hard but Weights and Measures on the nameplate instead of Health Department. We used to find the prettiest female employee we could to chauffeur them around and hope they were straight. Make em laugh enough that they forget to actually check any tags. Good content man.
I’ve been mistook for a health inspector a few times packing a clipboard into a restaurant. Its pretty hilarious, there’s always a sigh of relief when I tell the host I’m just a hungry dude doing some scribbles over lunch 😆
Last time inspection came to my job my coworker came to the back and told me and I didn't believe him. Lol I had seconds once I heard the guy coming to full the sanitizer bucket and put my cut glove on because I was slicing fruit.
Been working restraunts for 15 years as a cook and manager.... this right here.... facts
As someone that has worked in 5 different resteraunt businesses for 10 years as a server and a cook this is very accurate. Only difference is alot more cursing and crying as we know we fuckkked
Pickles is lowkey the smart one. If it's too perfect, the inspector will start digging for stuff to find. This way, you get a small demerit out of the way and he feels satisfied in his job. So while everyone was grumbling at Pickles for eating in the kitchen, he was saving the team.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
I’d like to think these characters are his internal voices.
How many times did I have to tell people?? PUT THE RAG IN THE BUCKET!!!
Pickles would be the one to mess it all up
Promote pickles!
You’re fucking amazing !
Love this
On point 😂 lol
Actually a genius move by pickles. Normally the health department can’t leave until they monitor one wrong thing so he got it out of the way with something light
oh this brings fond memories !! anyone in food service knows this!
This true of every restaurant and the health department
Damnit Pickles
Lmao This is so true lol I used to manage my mom`s restaurant I would unplug the phone and  flip the open sign as soon as the inspector enters the kitchen
GET THAT RAG OUTTA HERE!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Remember those fucking LIVESTRONG bands? HD would lose their shit over it. Now it’s no jewelry at all
The thongs!!!!
you haven’t worked in a real restaurant if you don’t know the “heard”
The hair net over the hat 😂
If you write up Pickles, you're dead, Inspector Boy!
Working in a kitchen for many of years, I’ve never seen a health inspector get upset over having drinks in the work place. I’m assuming they don’t pay the guys too well lmao
This shows up everyonce in a while for me, so good and nostalgic for me. Just cooking and cleaning is such a real response
Pickles is wearing Nico's shirt.
We're laughing but this shouldn't be funny.
Oh dear Pickles
ahahahaha accurate.
This is real.
OMG!!!! Yes, there's that idiot! I just want to ring their neck. Standards.  Standards.
They aren't called rags they're towels
Literallyyyyy😂😂😂😂😂
I'm a food microbiologist, and it's disturbing how many restaurants can get away with getting a pass on the health department inspection. 😆😅
Has anyone ever seen bribery happen? I doubt most would stick around a restaurant that needs to Bribe the health department to stay open but I’ve heard that the bribery happens a lot…I’m curious to find out if it’s true?
Dammed health department take all the flavour out the food  ......
Every time health department came by we had to waste all the water filling up too many sink stations, those industrial sized sinks though only two were ever really used. Nothing could be worse then finding an empty sink with one dirty utensils in there. We all knew which coworker would use miscellaneous sinks, knowing we had too many sinks, and wouldn’t clean up after she was done ‘cleaning’.  So health department day was always the day of headaches and rage born from the pettiest issues
god this is so fucking real
Too real 😂
Disgustingly accurate
I work at mcdonald's and its been a month now and where still waiting on are inspection.
Way too many gay dudes on youtube
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Poor Pickles 🤣
Super accurate
So true. CODE 1 People! You know what to do.
Dishwasher: Guess I'll just run everything through the machine for a little bit lol. *Turns down music on speaker and turns on the radio censored versions*
As someone who worked as a runner and a chef I can relate to this sooo much
Truth
Literally my kitchen life when the health department is there
We don't have health inspectors in Malaysia..
You are so talented!
Dude, your videos give me PTSD
Every kitchen has their pickles
One of my family friends was a health inspector and she said she could always tell when she was being stalled but didn’t really care, because if your restaurants health code violations can be fixed in five minutes then you’re running a pretty solid business
You get points deducted for having rags in bleach buckets. -5 points . 👨‍🍳
due dates!!! omg....thats the main one!! you would have people pulling markers out their butts and that one guy with the candy bar that's fucks it all the way up!! you have done this job...you know ALL the inside facts!!
funny
the only moment when when cooks become magicians(nothing to see here)
For the small few that don’t know you can’t eat on the line. We all eat on the line.
Put that rag away! Check your temps! Label everything! 😂 Made me have flashbacks!
ive experienced this
I wish this was a joke. The week we expected Health Department to show up at my old job was the week we would deep clean everything. Even wood counters would get polished.
The hair net over pickles face and eyes 🤣🤣
This reminds me of kitchen nightmare, “Gordon is here” “fucking idiot! Why didn’t you clean the walk in!”
Fridge died 2 days ago, check your Temps! Rags! Labels !🤣🤣I got horror flashbacks
That was the worst!!
Damn it pickles 😂
Any shot I can repost this one to my followers? We are a family owned linen rental company for restaurants in Kansas City.  Thanks and we love your videos!!
I want to add ti this "check the microwave !" And "run all the hot water !!!!"
What kind of an idiot offers food to the health inspector while EATING in the kitchen. You never eat/drink in the kitchen
Oh Pickles you adorable idiot.
Put that rag in the bucket!
This one must have got the most attention!! Or maybe not if in the USA?
YUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
CHECK THE LABELS CHECK THE LABELS 😂
This is so accurate lol
True story. I cooked at a mom and Pop restaurant. We had a room in the back with three walls and they lined up kegs of beer to  make a 4th wall to block the dogs they kept back there from getting out. When they didn’t want to look after them. I look out to the dining room and saw a guy with a clipboard talking to my owner at the bar. I went into a full panic I took the dogs outside and put them in my car cause I didn’t know what else to do. But the inspector never came to the back because the owner gave him a cigar and $100 bill and let him drink whatever he wanted. My owner was smooth as hell! Rest in peace!
“heard”
Day dots 😂 I love it. Because it's sooooo true
Love your vids! Most honest one yet 😂😂😂
“Health department  Heard”  Fr I always got called in on those days. Someone has to write up those time temp charts for the kitchen.
“Health department  Heard”  Fr I always got called in on those days. Someone has to write up those time temp charts for the kitchen.
So damn true 😂😂😂
Sooooo accurate 🤣
I thought health department calls before coming?
Lol the women one is so disturbing
"Rag?" "Bar towel!"
I remember being in the kitchen of a friend’s restaurant with my bf who use to do that kind of work. When we left the kitchen he whispered to me “Did you see the rag the waiter used to wipe the plate? Did it look clean?”  So seeing the rag joke here made me chuckle.
How has this man apparently worked in every restaurant in the country lmao
Every time
This is 100% correct every bit
Love pickles
How long does it take to record a video?
At most of the places I have worked The GM distracts The inspector will everybody date stuff and cleans.
Our code word is *Hurricane*
So accurate with the labels and rags😂
Bro we had mold in one of our coolers and we still got an "A", the health department is garbage
That’s how we act when Eco Shore comes in lol 😂 so on point
I luv pickle
Its too fuckin true😭😭
As if most health inspectors can’t just be bribed lol
"My fridge stopped working 2 days ago!" Dead XP
Pickles wearing a chef jacket that says Nico sent me
This guy drinking water out of a deli? He’s worked in this industry 100%
You had one job.
Surely concealing unsanitary practices from a health inspector is a crime right, why not just keep the restaurant clean and sanitary.
This is 100% accurate
damn it Pickle
I worked in a restaurant where no one wear a hair net, I never once saw a hair net
I was the “you want some candy” guy a couple times
these types of people are scum
Honestly, inspections shouldn't be announced to restaurants, I've worked with a pizza joint at two different branches, they always had at least a few days notice that they'll be dropping by, which gives plenty of time to get the kitchen in tip top shape, so they never see what it truly looks like when business is booming
I still remember when the Health Dept. would show up at our restaurant and we would make a mad dash to toss all the serving spoons. Not sure if other states have the same rule, but in VA, if you use a spoon to, let's say, scoop dressing out into a cup or on a salad, that spoon cannot just remain in the dressing for the duration of the service. That means that, if we were follow this rule to code, we would have gone through about 100 spoons a night just on dressings for salad.
at the starbucks immediately chucking our drinks in the trash and draining all of the sinks so they can’t test the water temp or sanitizer concentration :’3
Every place I've ever worked at. No gloves black mold, nothing properly cleaned just make it look clean tons of cross contamination, ect.. basically we would fail but we always got a day heads up and would spend the previous day only cleaning and barely taking orders
well the indoecter shoulf just go inside and not take btibes to be something other than a useless peice of shit.
Spent 10yrs running restaurants and felt this in my core😂🤣
Labels! Labels!Labels!....oh hey Mark?
The next time to help department comes offer him the new menu item before it goes on the menu make sure it is something delicious and it will definitely turn a blind eye to a lot of things if he enjoys it
The amount of work you put into these videos in phenomenal
Health department days are the best bro those asshole managers all on edge about getting caught it's funny af
This is the all soooo true!
My man!! You hit this right on point!! 🤣🤣🤣
Roll Tide!!
Pickles.. Sweet Pickles
The f tags are always outdated.
I work at a certain bell that makes tacos, and this is exactly what it's like. "I NEED TIMES AND DATES, NOW!"
Terry came through 🤣
I like how Pickles and Nico are both wearing Nico's shirt.
This is straight up 💯. I remember when they came. Everyone scrambled! Haha
Our manager used to throw as many people out of the kitchen as humanely possible so no one could pull a Pickles in front of the HD, send AGM around to apologize to tables as we were about to have a "small kitchen hiccup" that would delay service and tell the servers to stay the hell in the dining room refreshing drinks lolz
When I worked at CVS, the auditor came in and as soon as she turned away from me, I called the workers in the back to fix EVERYTHING cuz she was on her way there. It went smooth till she overheard an employee say he hoped there was no expired medicine since he didn't check that day. She found 5 bottle of about to/expired kids medicine. We got fined so hard that day
100% accurate.
Pickles. 🤦‍♀️😑
We were always told to disappear when the health department shows up haha
No eating behind the line
In my experience the host will also do a little freaking out lol
I worked at a sandwich shop in a city for awhile and whenever the health department would hit any of the places on the block we were on, someone from that kitchen would go and warn everyone in every restaurant, cause usually the health department would hit up more than one shop at a time.
This is so accurate it's scary 😭😭😭😭
I just noticed that pickles' uniform has Nico's name on it
This man’s videos are giving me ptsd from when I used to be a server
That is a true story for a lot of people 🤣🤣🤣
I totally believe that this is an accurate portrayal, and that is why I'm so uncomfortable eating at restaurants.
"You want some candy?"  "You want this citation?" As someone who once was certified in food service just to work in a warehouse with a freezer built into it, I can attest the majority of inspectors take their job VERY seriously. 😁
Heard
DAMN IT PICKLES YOU CNT EAT IN THE KITCHEN 😂😂😭😭
Bro this is so damn funny, but so true at the same time
Yup!!
As a health inspector this video speaks to me.
Lmaoooo the cooks even got their names on their shirts
I would like a pickles shirt. Please
LIDS ON YOUR DRINKSSSS
So relatable when i worked at longhorn !! Labels !!!
Putting on that hair net was so real hahahahah
😭😭😭😂😂😂
Every.....single......time
So true
Few people will ever know the stress of having the health inspector show on the day you realize that one of your fridges is 5 above the max temp
Just noticed pickles has a “nico” name tag 😂
I have a beautiful health department story.  I worked for a filthy and extremely unfair restaurant when I was desperate for work. Maybe a month. In that time I saw just how absolutely disgusting they were. Worst place I’ve ever seen. Worse than any house you’ve seen or something you’d see on tlc hoarders.  The owners wife got into it with me when she found a sheet I was keeping track of my hours and tips on, and threw it away claiming I was trying to steal from them by lying about not making any money. They didn’t want to pay minimum wage to offset the difference. She started throwing trash at me when I asked her why she would throw away my stuff, asking “is this it? This?” At that moment I was fed up and threw my apron at her and quit. I called the health department. When I went back a couple days later to get my last check (which was short hundreds) he started bragging about how the inspector that he knew I sent was actually on the football team with him in college and a good friend. He said he had nothing to worry about. Perfect marks. He didn’t know I was recording him. Sent it to the health department and he was closed down before the day was over. I felt so freaking awesome. Like a god controlling someone’s life. I saw him years later at another place and he looked embarrassed to see me and actually tipped me 50 bucks. Way more than 20%. Haha
Pickles be sounding like the coolaid man
"The fridge stopped working 2 days ago"  How are they still in business ☠
Health department is toothless anyway.
“Oh, no… Ugh…” perfect lol
Towel on the counter gets you everytime
"Oh no!" Lol  Pickles has to be my most favorite character, hands down! Lol
Lmao I'm sure we ALL wanted to cuss Pickles put right there
Stay ready so you don't have to get ready
Put the can opener in the dishwasher
Dammit Pickles.
This is the worst moment ever at work. End of a breakfast shift. We all  just cleared buffet, it's all out on the side. They show up.... Its all hands on deck
I think Guy Fierri oughta open an actual Bistro Huddy. But how would anything get done between wig changes?😂😂😂
How's the temp out there? I didn't notice...kitchen this way?
EVERY. DAMN. TIME.
My personal favorite skit do far lmao I run a kitchen by myself and I've been working without backup since the pandemic started so I know I've been slacking a little bit but I do my best with everything and I bleach everything I can on a weekly basis just to be safe but I know my mind is just in a blender.
Its funny cuz it seems prolly most places
God damn it, Pickles.
Actually they are not supposed to come during service.
Bruh the health dept shows up and suddenly we gotta wear gloves to run food and all my four drinks and 10pc wings I got under the counter are gone smh
So true
Heard
Das a real purdy women
Haha, and all bosses walk around like a chicken without a head, telling all employees to make sure you do this or do that, 😃
Same thing happens at the grocery store I work at. It's hilarious. The lazy people are the ones who work the hardest when they show up lol
LMAO 🤣 So TRUE! 😭
Our restaurant hires a 3rd party company to act as an internal health inspector. So, we get this level of anxiety about once or twice a month 😬
lmao drinking out of the quart containers
Yep you gotta distract him, talk to him as much as possible, and just hope he doesn’t look upwards into the ice machine.
Sooo sooo true!
ngl yesterday I walked back to the storage area which is an open space at the back of the kitchen and found the cook smoking there
Heard
DAMMIT PICKLES
“Put the rag in the bucket!” 🤣🤣🤣
Oh, Pickles! 🤦🏻‍♀️
I worked at a fast food place and we were so understaffed that it was basically impossible to always put new detergent for table rags or use a “new” rag. I was running around like crazy and barely kept the place up.
I remember they would always send me home early during a health inspection, I'm on meds that make me sweat a TON so I always kept towels around my head to keep from dripping, but one time the inspector saw that and told me it was unsanitary so the manager always told me to book it when the inspector showed up!
Damn it Nico!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Usually the manager would get a "Tip" that ol boy would be there sometime that day and we'd spend the shift deep cleaning and what not.
I cant wait for a dishwasher character
I need to know the what stalling question about the fridge is!
Freaking Pickles!
They were in such a rush that Pickles somehow ended up wearing Nico's jacket!
When Health Department showed up at the place where i was working, we literally had to hide the Rat traps.
I love Pickles
That news travels faster than the speed of light.
Pretty accurate
Thats restaurant and its 100% accurate the other one that from the director to the housekeepers scramble are the nursing homes when u hear over the intercom Dr H or Dr Red is in the building u better be on point lol
Accurate
GD Pickles
Can we just agree that Terry is awesome
Ok. First time I've exasperated "Pickles!" With the candy 😭
Classic
this is bs...every restaurant ive ever worked in always had a heads up that inspectors were showing up
That's a good manager he's buying his employees time
I keep hearing “CHECK YOUR TITS!” Which I guess is still a good thing to tell your employees if the health department show up…
I'm sure it's stressful to be inspected and run the risk of getting a  reputation for violations in the community, but I assure you, it pales in comparison to being served food unfit for consumption. My family and I went to an Italian restaurant for dinner.y wife ordered chicken parmigiano.  The chicken breast was raw inside.  Cold, pink jello inside.  I almost tossed my cookies.  We haven't been back since.
I'd love to know how many bags of Skittles he's bought specifically for skits at this point
Nahhh. They know a couple days in advance.
Damn it Pickles
Put the fuckin rag down lol shit is so real. Every lifer cook got two rags in each pocket they been wiping sauce and random shit with all night then cutting your sandwich with the exact same non sanitized blade. Hilarious he mentioned rags like 3 times
"So it seems you have 9 health code violations so that means I have to give you a 91 out of a possible 100 score, here's your A rating"
so fucking true
why does the woman have chest hair?
Sorry, we don't serve people from the food and drug administration
We need more of the front girl
Lol they do always have bright grey hair
Or maybe don't be disgusting and keep the kitchen clean?
Anyone notice that pickles is wearing nicos jacket
Drinking out of anything vaguely container shaped is very resturant.... Most hillarious I saw working in the kitchen was someone using like a 5 liter bowl.. Unsanitary? Well ya clean it ya muppet
I died seeing one of the cooks drinking out of the plastic container. 😆
They have food in the background that needs to be in the fridge 😬.
This brings back so many memories. Not like we had anything to hide but as soon as the health inspector walked in the hostess would let everyone know on the radio and the manager would run out to stall and it was all hands on deck to scramble in the kitchen 🤣
Omg the personal drinks and dates is so god damn accurate.
Dude. Sometimes I forget that this is just one guy in a bunch of outfits. That's means he's killing it I think.
When they show up and the cops get called for them being there to do their job!
the water buckets with the rags lol crazy accurate
How's the weather outside? I didn't notice:)))))))))))))))))))))) that had me...
This is us right now. We’re due for an inspection any day now, and it’s so awful. There’s so many little minute things to consider that the inspector is always bound to find something.
as foh, can confirm all of us stall them as long as possible. i once lived on an island and whenever the health inspector came around, literally every restaurant knew within the first hour. we all just started texting each other asap lmaooo
DHEC DHEC DHEC!!!!
So accurate. The quart container 😂
As someone who works in a kitchen, why the hell you gonna tell me o can't eat but can make the food? If I have a container, and wash my hands after I eat literally what is the issue?!
Place I work one of the guys in the kitchen wasn’t wearing a hair net when health inspector came in, one of the managers ran over and had him put one on before they saw
Sharpies, 😂😂
Terry is a great manager
I just noticed the names on the shirts 0.0
The health inspector came to my old high school job one day and my boss leaned in and told me to pretend we straight up didn’t have a basement lmaooo
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😍
Had our random inspection the other week...this is aggressively accurate
Not Pickles wearing Nico's uniform GOD I LOVE YOU PICKLES 😭
I've worked for schools and a hospital, and this is correct for both. That one dumb ass employee, the chefs really be about to choke someone out..
Wtf!! So accurate..😂😂😂
the chefs drinking out of the deli containers…classic
Where I used to work we had a set up always check the paper work and give the guys out back heads up because there is so much that need to be done lanes sanitizer lids clean rags all kinds of things and it was always crazy
Terry could have done betta.. Roll Tide.
Nico drinking out of a container instead of a glass! That was me 💯
This is SO true every place i worked at did this exact thing
Truth
Health department inspections are easy...Ecosure on the other hand gives me nightmares
How many custom embroidered chef’s coats do you own?
Dates and labels and rags are 100% accurate
The chill vibes right as he walks is perfect
“I didn’t notice, where’s the kitchen” 😂
This is entirely accurate
Somebody roll tide!
Yes, this is accurate, I work at a gas station and it was the equivalent of finishing your homework while they were holding it, we passed with flying colors got like a 3(that’s pretty good)
Get that rag out of here. Put that rag in the bucket!! Proceeds to stuff it in his jacket.
Digusting
😂😂😂😂  Wash your hands.
WASH YOUR HANDS......🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This is incredibly accurate
Whereas this is pretty funny, please consider how important clean and healthy food is. There have been a lot of deaths which could have been easily prevented by having good hygiene in restaurants etc.
True, true, true, true, and true! 😆
So true 👍
Accurate AF
Welp, fuck eating out anymore, I guess.
Why does everyone in your town look the same?  Inbreeding?
I worked in a restaurant for nearly a decade, never once did we have a surprise inspection. Usually, we got a 2-3wk warning. It's too bad. Had there actually been surprise inspections maybe the place would have been cleaned more often.
I worked in so many places, I kept running into thehealth dept. Guy  lol
I worked as a server in London for 7 years. This channel is HIGHLY ACCURATE so to me it feels like no matter where you work in hospitality - it is all same shit. Fuckjng mad and hilarious
And that's exactly what everyone does !! ! Manager's always stall them at the door while they hostess runs back to warn the staff!!! You nailed it100%!!!
Had a health inspector take 10+ minutes looking through our fridge with the doors wide open. Then she blamed us for the temp being higher.
I love your vids!!! 😍😂😂
In the state of Indiana, you don't need a hair net if you're wearing a cap or rag. The fact they put it on anyways made me laugh.
Roll Clean Tide
I mean this in the nicest way possible but you're such a good actor I forgot for a second you weren't actually a woman
I like how nico and pickles wear the same vest hahaha
Hi
You straight kill it bro! Been serving tables my whole life, spot on hilarious .. love the content 🤣🤙
After working at restaurants for six years... yeah you're right. Only one place i worked was ever always prepared for the HI, and that was just because our chef was a control freak. Pleasant to be around, but man he ran that place with an iron fist-- as he should.
,oooooo oooooo🤣🤣
Shouldn't you operate at Health Department standards all the time? Quit bitching; it's your fault if you don't.
Lmao
Put that rack on the fuck it 😂😂😂😂😂
I just noticed pickles was wearing nico’s uniform lol
they won’t let you know that they’ll visit?
Note to self don't go that restraunt
There’s always that one employee😂😂😂
They know in advance that's why they clean up
Gotta love pickles
As a worker at McDonald’s, this is relatable.
It's like screaming "LA MIGRA!" at a construction site.
Ahhhhh
So accurate it hurts.
I am the lead QA on night shift at a chicken plant and this is how the entire Plant acts when the USDA shows up LOL it's my job to run interference while my workers and supervisors get shit together LOL and yes there is always that one idiot.
The fact there isn’t one Hispanic in BOH really? 😂
Same thing happens in a nursing station when DOH shows up at the hospital.   Thirsty shift
It’s not a fridgerator god damn it!!  It’s a fridge or a refrigerator. Not a fucking fridgerator. We aren’t 7
I remember working the 2nd day of Panda Express and the manager and the other cook I was with were freaking out because there was a health inspection and I got sent on my lunch break and we failed it apparently lets just say it wasnt pretty the manager and cook couldn’t accept responsibility and blamed others for the fail….
In my earlier years as a chef I got nicknamed Chipy.
Everyone suddenly becomes an NBA player as they notice rags and toss them into buckets from 30 ft away
A while back when I was eating lunch, went up to pay. Noticed they had 3 crock pots sitting to the side.   For laughs after I paid, i asked what they were for.   “Sauce for to-go orders”. Oh, neat.  Better than week old from the fridge never dated stuff.  “Interesting. Do you have your thermometers handy?”   Guy said “we have a few around” then proceeded to look in back. Comes up empty handed, “I know theyre here someplace.  Why do you ask?”   At this point the bartender and line staff (pizza place) were kind of slowing down and listening.    “Well, I might be from the health department.”   At that moment, the manager pokes her head from way in the back, slowest ‘around the corner’ look ever.  I followed up with, “I’m probably not but I could be.”   Wave of relief from them and nervous laughter.   Manager came up and asked if she could help me. “Nope, food was great like always.”    “Why did you ask about thermometers?”   “Just curious.”   She knew the implications.   Said ‘hold on’ and gathered the crew to find them.  Many minutes later she appeared with half dozen, all clean, and proceeded to thank me for that reality check.   Probably cussed me afterwards.   They always pass their inspections, expect stupid shit like someone having a drink out of place or random something unlabeled.   Nothing super critical.  Yes, i’m the type that looks at the inspection website for reports.
I love how the number of characters have expanded and I’m invested in each one
Lol 😂
facts 🤣🤣🤣
I can’t stand how much I relate to these!!!! 😂😂😂😂
I go to lunch anytime someone I don’t know shows up😏
Yuuuuuuuup 😂😭 I remember those days
I'm a busboy boy and I can agree this is how the kitchen ends up
As a health inspector this is too funny.
The health inspector actually looks like our eco-sure guy😂😂
Our health inspector had a hard on for us...so we were always ready for that bitch...good news for all our guests...
Hahahahaha
i met some of the funniest ex-drug addicts and criminals in pre-release working at a mediocre café. it was super fun!
These are epic af... Roll Tide!!
Accurate as hell. That stress of not getting the restaurant closed sucks  And they are ALWAYS so dead inside
😂😂😂 accurate!!
He looks really hot in a wig ngl
I always kept my section labeled and everything properly done. Then this happened and I was asked to help the other cunts who can't do their job bit get paid the same as me, and me, nahhh, I'm going for a smoke 😂
Waiting………
What's wrong with candy?
Pickles wearing Nico’s uniform 😂
Man I use to work in a kitchen as soon as they come. Water bottles removed, trash can outside, check the sanitation water even though we just filled it.   Everything had a label so it was never a problem   But they always come in rush hour like why
Lol bring me back
How I feel when the state comes to my school
I used to work in Pizza Hut and when they taught us how to make food there was the “proper” way for when the health department came and “actual” way for the rest of the time
“Oh no”. Fucking Pickles
Health department magistrate is a nightmare. They will fined u for the most stupidest crap ever
You know what’s the worst about hiding from the “healthstapo?” You have to hide in a clean attic.
Health department is a breeze compared to company food safety audits, STERITECH is ours. That thing is stressful.
Good God this is so accurate 🤣🤣🤣
Thank you for being unashamed to say the word rag in a restaraunt. 😂 The amount of times I got corrected by my managers for and told to call it a "cleaning cloth" or something similar because "rag sounds dirty" is ridiculous. It doesn't matter!! 🙄
This is even better the um-teenth time through, weeks later. 💜
Narukami as a health inspector
100000%  Correct!
When the head Chef yelled "oh Fu** I laughed so hard, I can relate
Haha its more like:  QUICK GET NEW SANITIZERS!  Or GET YOUR MISE BACK IN THE FRIDGE or WHATS THAT KNIFE DOING IN THE SINK GET IT OUT
Lol omg so true
Honestly it's not that hard to adhere to food safety rules
Lol as a restaurant worker I can 10000% relate.
Why is pickles wearing nicos apron?
This is so fucking dead on.
2today except for the candy and an in company audit (which is more strict for some reason) but one of the midwhits from night crew messed up on cooling sauces.... would have been perfect.
Average kitchen nightmares episode
If this ain't accurate as hell I don't know what is
This has the same energy as OSHA making a surprise visit to the shop 😅
Honestly the place I work is pretty clean labels are to date everything is clean haven’t had any Stewart littles around the 7 months I’ve worked 👌🏻
You forgot the person calling all the other restaurants to warn them
The amount of wigs that guy has is unbelievable
Wait, are there 2 Nicos? The pirate-looking dude and the one with the hat turned back? Confused.
When I was at Applebees a manager quit and as they were leaving fucking HD shows up and he said “yea just head to the kitchen - don’t worry I’m the only manager here so just let them know that I sent you in”   That by far was the lowest score I’ve ever seen from Them and mf foot just didn’t come out for like 30 minutes- shit was soooooooo funny
the kitchen is literally the most realistic shit ive ever seen. 1 guy who adheres to the rules and cusses like a storm, 1 guy with dreads, 1 guy who always has a backwards hat.
🤣🤣🤣 this has got to be the best one yet lmao
My parents own a small takeaway and I’ve been helping out since I was young…. This is 100% accurate lmao
This is so true
.......yep.
As a dishwasher, whenever the health department shows up my manager just tells me to shut everything down and pretend to stock things until they leave.
This is like in the hospital when JACHO show up 🤣
The drinking out the quart container took me out lololol
I remember an owner to a bar and restaurant left me alone when a health inspector came to visit.   On top of doing both cooking and tending i had to walk through the whole building and listen to his lectures.   I learned a lot of cool things though.
Plot Twist the Health department was... Gordon Ramsey 🤣
Pickles has on a Nico shirt 🤣
as someone that has been working at restaurants for at least 4 years, this is the most realistic portrayal ever
Lol the restaurants in the neighborhood I used to work in would all send staff around to warn each other if one of them got a surprise inspection because that meant everyone was due for one.
NEVER EAT ON LINE
🤢🤢🤢
It’s funny pickles wears Nico’s vest
You cant stop Pickles from eating candy 🤣
You’re killing me here!🤣🤣🤣
Fuuuuck my boss is coming tomorrow I need to put a date on my fajita chicken 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭he better not arrive when I do
hey do you want some candy? he was trying to get on the inspector's good side lolz
So accurate though...
my old job opened after the health dept did thier rounds so he always scheduled specific days and showed them around before even opening
Hahaha so relatable!!!
This had my mom on tears ( of laughter)...both of us know the struggle
Awww pickles ..
No one told the cook that's out smoking pot by the dumpster with whatever waitress he's tryna get with this week...
Haha I still remember my assigned "tasks" for when the health inspector or corporate showed up.
As a ex head cook this cuts close
Love ur acting for real  Really funny 😄
Dammit Pickles!!! 🤣
I used to work in a supermarket where all the "back" work (bakery, deli, fresh cut, etc.) all lived in constant fear of the health department dropping in. My coworkers and I all hated each other to a terrifying degree, but when the health department showed up? WE BECAME BESTIES. We ran around like ants and got that place spotless in maybe 10 minutes tops. It was INSANE.
Love the detail of the guy drinking out of the plastic container, idk how true this is but I watched a YouTube short where the guy said it was common for people working in restaurants to drink from those containers lol.
at least he didn't see the dishwasher making a cyclone in the sink
As a person who has eaten at a restaurant before, this isn't funny.
The rag thing, oml  Every know and then management tells us to keep it in the bucket, but ice-cream gets so messy at DQ that there's constantly at least one out. 😅
This is very true . My last job my manager would label everything last minute 🙃  I left because of multiple reasons but it was so unsanitary and dishonest.
Lol ACCURATE!
💯
Pickles is my favorite 😊
😂😂😂😂
You’re not supposed to have candy in the back?🤨
The health department for my work seems to be high when he visits. Nice guy but we are in good shape normally
Pretty sure the only times I ever saw the cooks wash their hands more than like once per shift was on the days the health inspectors came.
In the medical field JHCO gives up advanced warning and it's an entire month of doing things completely differently.
Oh this is 100% true🤣🤣🤣
I love how Pickles is also wearing a shirt that says Nico😂
B
I forgot that it was one dude playing all the parts for a second.
Because if you don't out a date on your stake it will make someone sick. Fucking health department is a cost without benefit
Lmao there's always that one guy who doesn't get it, and says or does something stupid to the inspector. Someone give this man a tv spot, this needs to be a full on sitcom, not just shorts on YouTube.
You know he looks good in a blond wig. 🤔 😂
Cut to me eating spare mac and slurping an rc cola in downtime cause we’re fucking slammed.
This guy looks like Quagmire
So real it hurts
Absolutely terrifying. I swear, everything could be perfect, but they would feel like their job wasn’t done unless they found something wrong. Do I miss working at my family’s restaurant? Every single day. But am I so grateful to not have to deal with the stress of it anymore? Every. Single. Day.
“Heard “ 🤣🤣🤣
Realest shit I've ever seen
I never worked in a restaurant, but I've always heard the cooks aren't allowed to eat in the kitchen.
Health Inspectors are just buercratic bloating of the government
Surprisingly accurate with all stores that aren’t top level
Can you make a video on tungs. And how cooks love to clap them for no reason
I’m so hip everyone panicks but if we just do everything lol we wouldn’t need to panick
That's why i didn't work days at the hospital
Bruh this is so true, I worked in a local Italian restaurant when I got out of high school and in the kitchen this is what always happened 😂I was the one who always got stuck dating every container😂😂
Man I worked in food service for a 10 years, moved on to a different path but I do miss the rush of it. Everyone’s on high alert when someone in a suit and tablet/clipboard comes in 😂
Pickles is wearing Nico's whites 😂
The hostess is almost hot I'd say 😅
Pickles
I'm freaking DONE!!!
nothing scares a diner owner like the health department
Big shout out to the managers that distract the health inspectors so you can run around like a maniac making sure every is almost perfect.
Dude kinda looks like Gary Hobbs lol
Who tf is that health inspector? Yu Narukami?
This is so accurate I had a flashback
That’s so true lmao!!! Working at a restaurant is a stressful mess but good time :,)
😂😹😂 true
So proud of the BOH, they have official shirts now lol
Chad narukami???
The sad part is how true it is, cause no one likes to do thier jobs properly and make excuses, its the American way
Worked back of house, not as fancy but I say it's always the same when HD comes to play 😆
I can't stand stuff like this! Just do what you're supposed to do all the time so you don't have to worry about stuff like this. They go through the same panic in healthcare and office settings 😒.
Omg so real
I'm the guy with the candy 😭😭 luckily NOT the day Ecolab came though 😩✊️
This one is my favorite to date
DUDE WHY DID I THOUGHT HE WAS TOBY MAGUIRE AT FIRST!💀
Yep I was in the food service for 12 years and yep that's it all in a nutshell. I've always wondered if they see us scrambling around like freaking chicken's with their head cut🤔🤔🤔
This literally happened to me yesterday 🤣
This was always my unofficial task when I worked in a restaurant. I could see the health inspector walking across the parking lot (she always went to the Subway across the street first), and always uttered "Aw sh*t" and would quickly run to each person and whisper "health department" and the mad dash would commence lol
Ths fact this showed up when my  restaurant i work at is geting our FSC soon.
I need new labels 🤣
Worked in a food truck and that do be how it is 😂💀
This gives me joy and ptsd😂🤣
There's always someone eating on the line when the health department comes 😪
Restaurant equivalent of brushing your teeth before a dentist appointment
About the same as when the safety guy comes through the job site. SAFETY GLASSES! GET OFF THE LIFT RAILS! GLOVES?! WHERE ARE THE GLOVES?!
PICKLES IS A NATIONAL TREASURE!!!!!
Just slip him a $100 bill and cross your fingers at that point
😂
This guy belongs on Broadway or SNL with these fantastic performances
So very true 👍
No one run dishes till they’re gone!
This shit is so accurate I burst out laughing at “oh no!”
TOWELS NOT RAGS
💀so accurate!!!
The hair nets 😂😂
Lol dude these are so good I legit forget it's all you 🤣
yu narukami
McDonalds be like this and the dude barely checks anything 😫
😂😂😂😂😂
Nah bc this is true. 💀 Used to work in a coffee shop & we would leave personal drinks and food near the drive thru register so we wouldn't have to keep walking to the other side of the store for our food. I was always good about labeling everything that needed to be dated, but i always had to rush my sandwich and can of monster to the break table.
I’d laugh if it wasn’t true :,(
100% true
Facts
I don't really know how to describe this but I love how you like play the roles of women perfectly and believably while still funny and not being transphobic at the same time. It's kind of a complex thing to describe but I love it and these are really funny and creative.
We literally do the same thing
On point
I love this.... having worked in a fast food joint this is perfect
OSHA is the equivalent of the health inspector, we would call them Oh sh$&
Years ago when I worked in a restaurant the health department would come by and the manager would take him into his office and write him a check there was never any inspection. Just pay off..
I love it
This is the best shit ever
God damnit pickles
Accurate
Freaking Pickles, every day with this fool 😂😂
Everyone Haveing a different drink is so accurate. Guys. Even pandemic. All the chefs are eating and drinking
Hahahaha the eyes on the health inspector. Made me crack up
I was the candy guy when they came to Sonic. Damn
Funniest thing EVER, and so accurate. Let's not forget to clean the CAN OPENER. 🤣🤣🤣
Just noticed that you have different jackets for each chef with their names!! Such attention to detail
Oh dayum, that’s my que to clock out for lunch! See ya in an hour✌️
Why is pickles wearing nico’s shirt lol
Whenever anyone says anything to you:  “Heard”  so accurate lmao
Kitchen has new uniforms! Bistro huddy doing good!
So accurate. Also happens when the district manager for the franchise starts making the usual rounds, with each store's management discretely tipping off the other stores so they can get caught up on all the little stuff. It's funny to see happen when it's not happening to you.
Iv worked in the back of house for 8 years now and the whole thing about thr rags is soo fucking true gotta throw them shits as soon as you see him
Of course it had to be Pickles who inadvertently ruins it
There should be a light switch at the hostess stand that activates an alert in the kitchen
What’s funny is this is exactly how it goes
Normally it'd be the Kitchen porter (me) in a blind panic cleaning everything while the chefs lay back with their arms crossed in the mess they've made without thinking of helping saying "Yeah you need to keep ontop of that, bud"
That's legit🤣🤣 Everybody running around to check the temps and date tags🤣🤣
Sir you were on point it took me a week to get the restaurant ready and they never came
The restaurant I worked in the guy would walk in get us to make him a drink and sit in the boss' office for an hour and leave. When the boss passed away and a new owner got the place the first grade was a 96 the next visit was a 60 or something I can't remember exactly but we failed hard
I was wondering when a video featuring the HD would pop up. As a local health inspector I do find our timing is unfortunate sometimes. Always there when equipment is down or there is a rush.  Everyone is trying to get their job done so I try to work with folks. The date labeling def made me LOL. Big one for us.
you crack me up everyday
😂😂😂😂
…..Did anyone notice Pickles wearing Nicos shirt?
Heard!
They need to make these complete surprise visits.
If this is how you feel when the HD shows up you're disgusting and a pathetic employee. I'm thankful I've worked at very well managed restaurants
Hospital kitchen 😂
Dishwasher will be out back eating and listening to rap music only he likes, on a portable speaker
The drinking out of the deli without a lid on it is so on point it’s insane
Where is Tim and Pam?
Man I remember working in a kitchen and the Health Department showed up for a visit. The Inspector was walking around the kitchen prep areas without ahaircut, when told he would have to wear one (obviously something he should already know) he lost his mind, threw a fit and found every possible tiny thing he could ding us on.
Absolutely Spot On! Salute
Omg so accurate 🤣
If you’ve put go’ogle to use you know making your ex gf enter into a mental state of panic and confusion that can have her obsessively thinking about being with you is a piece of cake. I think that it’s called Treitan Mellory's Simple Paper, very easy to follow, and takes a couple weeks or so.
Accurate
You remind me of Robby Rotten
the guy drinking out the plastic Tupperware i see other people do that every day 😂😂
https://youtu.be/DaAnrlnOXZY
LMFAO this is so true except the visit can be started out front for 20-30 minutes prior to the beginning in the kitchen.  They also don't generally come during rush times when the most mistakes will be made.
Can I just say Pickles is my favorite cook 😂😂
This why I’ve never understood letting places know ahead of time. Like same for upper management visiting a store, why would you let us know so we can fix our shit we shouldn’t be doing? Isn’t the entire point to see if we operate how we should on a daily basis without an inspector around
This is probably the most accurate one yet
Lmfao this is so real
Could you do one about the employee that always says sorry? Lol I love this videos they are so good Drew!
https://youtube.com/shorts/ZPalTUpHwUE?feature=share
😂 this is too perfect
Roll tide
Too funny!🤣
🤣🤣
In case you wondered what happened to the Theater Qu 🌽🌽
I love you on TT! Also, when the health inspector discovers the life forms growing in your ice machine.... XP
Yoooo this is so accurate 😂😂😂😅
I worked at an expensive place in Orlando that had some problems. The drain in the kitchen floor didn't work well, and something with the dishwasher flooding the drain. We'd end up in a pond, tracking water into the carpet in the dining room. So, health department comes out.   They wrote us up for every instance a waiter used a cone cup, drank from it, then threw it away and went back to work.   In addition to a bunch of other violations.
yeah, no not eating there

That was actually sick!! hahaha expertly done man.
10 Of The World's Funniest One Liners ever!  1. Always go to other people's funerals, or they won't go to yours. 2. No matter where you go, you're there. 3. There are three kinds of people: Those who can count and those who can't.  4. Honk if you like peace and quiet. 5. The severity of the itch is inversely proportional to the ability to reach it.  6. We are all part of the ultimate statistic -- ten out of ten die. 7. My mind is like a steel trap, rusty and illegal in 37 states. 8. I intend to live forever. So far so good.  9. All generalizations are false.   10. What's another word for "thesaurus"?    Editorial: Perhaps the most thought-provoking one-liners is "Eat right. Stay fit. Die anyway." It's sad but true -- no matter what you do, you will die. This is because you have sinned against God. Let's see if that's true: Have you ever lied (even once)? Ever stolen (anything)? Jesus said, "Whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her, has committed adultery already with her in his heart." Ever looked with lust? If you have said "Yes" to these three questions, by your own admission, you are a lying, thieving, adulterer at heart; and we've only looked at three of the Ten Commandments. How will you do on Judgment Day? Will you be innocent or guilty? You know that you will be guilty, and end up in Hell. That's not God's will. He provided a way for you to be forgiven. He sent His Son to take your punishment: "God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Jesus then rose from the dead and defeated death. God promises everlasting life to all those who confess and forsake their sins, and trust in Jesus Christ. Please do that today . . . you may not have tomorrow. See John 14:21 for a wonderful promise. Then read the Bible daily and obey what you read. God will never let you down.Visit needgod.com

As a former kitchen manager, this is to ducking true and relatable 😂😂
Everyone gangster until the health department shows up
NAILED IT.
You’re such a character
I loved the health inspector when I worked at Subway. It was the corporate subway inspector who was frightening 😨 Like 'oh the health inspector gave you a 100? Well good for you but I'm going to have to write you up. You put to many olives on that sandwich and you have that old poster still up.'
Ayo
So true 👍
https://youtu.be/d7e6dErtgdo
Ok.
I want to eat at a restaurant entirely staffed by this guy in 20 different wigs.
Awful finish for a joke.
Hello. I have something important to tell you:  The bible makes it clear that God is holy. This holy God holds a perfect moral standard. Sadly, we have all fallen very short of that standard(Romans 3:23). The penalty for sin/imperfection is Hell(Revelation 21:8).   Thankfully the bible also says that God is rich in mercy and grace. That is why He sent His perfect Son to die on a cross to save us from our sin. You and I broke God's law, but Jesus paid our fine. Then Jesus rose from the dead, 3 days later, thus defeating death! (John 3:16-18)   "He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life; and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.” John 3:36 "But God commendeth His love toward us in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Romans 5:8    “That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” Romans 10:9-10
偶买噶很棒很棒！
Jesus Christ is coming back soon! If you haven't had a personal relationship with god your creator, he's calling you to him and he loves you very much. He died on the cross for our sins, was buried and rose on the third day so we wouldn't be separated from god and experience eternal death (hell) he desires that we know him and be saved so we may not perish but have eternal life. If we repent (turn from our sins) and turn to god believe in Jesus, get baptized in Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of our sins  become born again, filled with his holy spirit and follow him he gives us peace, comfort and joy in the holy spirit and a new life!. He brings hope to the hopeless, Healing to the brokenhearted, freedom to the captives, and can heal you and set you free. He sees everything and knows what you deal with. He's the only way to heaven. There is no other way in which man can be saved. If you die today where would you go?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 the monster
https://youtu.be/2CKuuYag9WQ Best freestyle out there💯🔥🔥
I leave a like Everytime  just bc he's so on point with all these videos.
I’m a restaurant owner vlogger and this is 100% true.
Whyyyy Pickes whyyyyyy😞😞😞
I swear to god it doesn’t even have to be  At a  restraunt it can be a fastfood place to on god
The "you idiot" is so priceless 😂 his face says it all
I'll like to thank the Lord above & YT algorithm for pointing me to this channel!!! My first day watching and am already hooked ❤️❤️🤣
Everyone gangster until the health department shows up
only just noticed the cooks all have their names embroidered. amazing touch!!
Screw the "Health Dept". What do you do when God Himself shows up at your front door so to speak?? Your not going to believe what I found on a map. YOU MUST COME SEE THIS. It will give you HOPE!
Where’s the lie lol
We had a guy like pickles. One kitchen I managed had drink rails so cooks could step from the line and hydrate. The local comes in and this dummy leaves rhe line drinks his drink and wins his hand on his ass steps back on the line........his station had the only working sink by it didn't wash his hands. Damn near lost my job
*sigh* pickles.
This is accurate AF
Lol health inspection is coming soon to my restaurant lol cant wait
Y'all have surprise visit?! My old boss used to have a call 2 days before the visit so we could ''clean up'' the place a bit.
This is with any type of audit service I swear being a lifeguard and if an auditor did show up it was just like this
Lol I used to be a general manager for Panda Express. This is too relatable. Was so goddamn stressful when the health inspectors came knocking
I was definitely pickles unknowingly showing our health inspector the whole that a mouse/squirrels could fit in thro the wall that the back of house used ads cigarette sender to the back of the store lol
Lol, this is also the reason why the ice cream machine in McDonald's is always broken. The cleanliness of that machine has to be top notch. The machine is never cleaned due to faulty instrumentation inside so they decide to always have it down.
That's accurate. Be even more accurate if he showed up during a rush
Put that rag away ahhaha
Every1 just wants to be a youtuber… no matter how stupid and pointless the vids are….
I once wiped down an entire kitchen in 5 min.  I loaded that red bucket up with sani-tabs, and scalding hot water. Stainless turns bright white when you use enough. That kitchen and cooler were glistening. It was also oddly steamy in the cooler. Lol
Omg our biggest thing was hiding the fans n drinks in the summer!! You through those fuckers outside if you had to!!!!
I think your videos are cool but my imagination always gets the best of me I'm sorry but if you don't mind you remind me of Tom Green and Gerard Butler mixed together.  Sorry bro I think that's a good combo though
You have  white privileges! Thus ignoring the privileges of the rich! If you think white privilege is unfair, then rich privilege is judicial immunity!
Hilarious, smh!
Health department inspections were a pain, especially when they follow you.  I remember losing points for not washing hands before I put bread in a toaster. And more points for not washing hands after taking bread out of toaster. According to them it should went wash, grab bread, toast,  wash, remove toast,  wash, butter toast, wash, place on plate, wash, serve.  Here's your 20 minute piece of toast sir.  Migh taste a slight soapyness. ENJOY
😄🤣😂🤣
Why doesn't Pickles have his own shirt? That's a health code violation!
😳😳😳
We usually weren't as worried about the health department as we were the quality control unit from olive garden. But either way, the moment someone looking suspiciously official was spotted walking up we were muttering into the headset and if there was enough coverage at the front, spreading the word around 😂
This is very accurate. My boss would just tell us all to leave. Lol
https://youtu.be/PGZP7kMvg2w
Never worked anywhere that was surprised by the health inspector. We always knew when he wascomming.
Lmao I worked in a kitchen for a short period of time thinking I wanted to learn to be a chef. I was there for maybe two weeks before realizing it wasn’t the career path for me.  The restaurant had the kitchen where I worked which was for private dining and another kitchen for the main dining room. Just a couple days in I showed up early for my shift, and there was only one other cook there: an older woman. She didn’t really have any specific jobs for me to do, so I was waiting for the chef or sous chef to come in so I knew what we would be preparing. A few minutes into the shift one of the cooks from the main kitchen busts through the door looking nervous. He sees me and asks “Where the fuck is the chef?” I told him I had no idea but that he should be in soon. Dude just yells “fuck! Health inspector’s here!” and then runs back out.   I look at the other cook and she just shrugs. A few minutes later, the chef comes running in with the other two cooks behind him and he’s barking orders. “Check the walk-in and take out anything that might be expired!” “Scrape the grills!” “Throw the old gelato in the sink and run hot water!” Everyone else is moving like they’d been training their entire lives for this moment. I’m stuck there thinking there’s no way we have that many violations in our small kitchen.   Finally he tells me to grab some empty bins, throw all the expired food in them, take the bins to his office and then lock the door when I’m done. We did all of that in about 10 minutes and then spent the next hour waiting out in the empty private dining area while the inspector did his thing. Chef even told me, if he asks to see the office for any reason “we’re fucked.”  The inspector didn’t ask to check the office and we passed the inspection. While everyone else is cheering, I’m sitting there still wondering how a kitchen for a Michelin starred restaurant could have that many health violations and whether or not I belonged on the industry.
Only Drew and Andrea would get the detail of drinking out of the deli cup 😂😂😂
Heeeard
Every restaurant— even 5 star!
Spot on 😂
True
It’s just like when licensing comes to daycare, I ran the kitchen so I got to watch the teachers scatter like mice 😂😂😂
Lol 🤣
Man him holding that quart container in the kitchen for real hits different.  Story time. My first actual restaurant job I was 19, Puerto Rican guy comes up says..drink this before 8am or I'll get you fired..I start going h.a.m. on this mf. Downed it like a champ. Then realized I had just drank cooking wine( very high in sodium) before 8 even hit I was to drunk to stand, let alone do my job 🙃 😅 miss being a greenie
GOD CREATED US TO LOVE US AND EVEN THOUGH WE SINNED AGAINST HIM HE DID NOT ABANDON US,BUT MADE A WAY FOR US TO BE RESTORED TO HIM THROUGH HIS SON JESUS;WHO DIED IN OUR PLACE AND IS RISEN...TRUTH.PRAYING IS TRUSTING THAT GOD HEARS YOU WHEN YOU SPEAK TO HIM AND MEANING WHAT YOU SAY...LETS PRAY,LORD JESUS I BELIEVE AND WELCOME YOU INTO MY LIFE,AMEN.*READ AND SPEND SPEND TIME WITH GOD DAILY,PUT YOUR TRUST IN HIM*ASK GOD TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HIS WORD*ALLOW THE HOLYGHOST TO LEAD YOU...I LOVE YOU BUT GOD THE TRINITY LOVES YOU UNCONDITIONALLY.
Someone has to make a video about the universe this dude has created with characters
I worked in a behind the counter kitchen and it looks messy, but let me tell you it is MUCH cleaner then a kitchen the customer can’t see🤣
You know, I laugh now, I was in food service for 20+ yrs and when we got wind the health inspector came in the door......we did just exactly that!  Lol!!!
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith                                                            /../,/.,./,./                                  ,./,/.,                /.,/.    /,.,/.,/
So true
https://youtu.be/Fo4SnFc0FuA
Our restaurant is on top of shit, but the servers station slacks a lot, so whenever health dept. Shows up, we'll casually lead them to the walkins first, so we can do a quicky-deep-clean and label everything in the drink fridge
True 🤣
The damn rags man.
it do be like that
Honestly I hate eating out and I rarely do it. I don’t trust humans.
If a waiter or waitress is waring a Mask I make it a POINT NOT TO TIP them at the end of my meal. Sometimes I will not even pay for the meal and walk out disgusted 😒
Facts 😂😂
How's the weather out there? - I didn't notice. Hahaha
This just happened, luckily we passed with flying colors, only cited because somebody left their phone on the prep table
If you're establishment acts like this when the board of health shows up you work in a dumpster. I have been a chef for 25+ years, I have always welcomed the board of health. In fact my restaurant in Indy was the only establishment that my auditor would eat at. You are preparing and serving food, if cleanliness is not a top priority you are a garbage person. I despise this meme, have some fucking self respect!
https://youtu.be/UtSF1r9xnBk
Poor Pickles. His stairs just don't go quite all the way to the second floor.
*heard* 😭
Good variety
panic situation
It’s way worse. You run through the Kitchen screaming they’re there and it’s ALL hands on deck and EVERYONE is scrambling to clean it as fast as possible LOL
Spot on bro 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I love Pickles! Only he would offer candy to the health inspector while cooking on the line.❤️❤️❤️
So many flash backs. I feel like I have ptsd from when I worked at a restaurant lol! Started as a hostess and worked almost all positions up to training to be a manager and you have really captured the essence of restaurant life lol
😂
😂🤣😅
You would hope that all kitchen staff would go above & beyond the law to ensure they have a culture if cleanliness and safe food handling as well as storage and complete these procedures so often that it becomes muscle memory
This triggered my ptsd from all those health department visits lmao
best in the biz man!!
Hilarious!
😂😂😂💯
So true 🤣
😁😁😁just love this guy

My aunt is a company health inspector and I was once studying at the same city where she does her inspections. She brought me 2 cases of water, 3 cakes, 6 small milk cartons and 12 yoghurt cups during the 2 weeks she was there. She gets free stuff all the time and because she still needed to fly home with just her backpack she had to get rid of all the excess food. This happened a week before the first Covid lockdown happened and what she brought really helped us.
Omg yesss #sonicLIFE
As a former restaurant employee this is all true lol
Omg so accurate for the back of the house. Damn it pickles!
Bro the cooks drinking out of togo containers is so damn accurate 😂😂 love these shorts!
Meanwhile the Mexican waitress at downtown LA, new mexico: proceeding to spit in the coffee.
To ell to he health inspector to hit the road  His kind not welcome
Bro I love your videos so many memories lmmfao your spot on with everything
Very accurate lol.
Ooo Good 👍 👌 👏
I hate health inspectors they are so grumpy sometimes. A health inspector came by surprise to the pharmacy I used to work at. At the time the freezers had been broken for almost 4 months so we had unplugged them to prevent over hearing and a fire. So as such we refused and canceled all frozen food orders and we didn't take the temp as it was turned off and not in use. The guy gave us a mark for not having Temps for the freezer every day for the time it was broken. He didn't care it was off. Like it's not in use. There is no food. There is no temp. He was like where do you put the food then. I was like we don't order any food we refuse it if it shows up n he was like well it needs a label. Even though it was unplugged! I was so pissed
Laughs. You look like a slapstick Gerard Butler that deserves an Oscar more than him. I bet your wife is happy every second.
Soo not funny
Same reaction with bosses, bosses family members-gf bf, immigration 😅
Do a "if servers and cooks personalities switched"
Deadass
Holy fuck this is accurate I've been cleaning my kitchen like a mad man for the health instructor cunt just says he's coming February what a dick
I never had this problem tbh lol we always kept are kitchen super clean

Before my dad created his martial arts school he was the GM for a really big night club in a nice area he rose the ranks fast cause he’s ex military “and a control freak” so he ended up managing a lot of restaurants he was known to go in under cover as a guest without  the new staff knowing who he was at every new restaurant/club he managed to see how the staff treated there customers, how they prepped the food, if they over charged, ect. Sometimes he would clear the place of asshole workers who would steal and were awful to the customers that made them loose business and bring in his people cause there are alot of people that would steal, do shots switch the customers, ignore the customers while talking to eachother x So now when we go to any restaurant I trust his opinion on everything cause he’s usually right cause he knows the ins and outs lol. Still a control freak tho. Also he’s told me some nasty stories about kitchens at restaurants he’s walked into that had mold growing on the food, dead rats laying on the floor and even once a finger in the garbage disposal that had been there for a WEEK after it had to be cut off. He ended up making some calls and having the place shut down for a full remodel and it wane t even his restaurant. They just trusted his opinion that much. But it makes me scared to eat at restaurants
mmm  interesting ...

Dude legit put on a whole women’s fit. Heels n all 😂
I've been dealing with them for years worse inspectors always the young ones especially the ladies, they have miserable lives they take it on you somehow, my restaurant is so clean that you can sleep on the floor, older guys are nicer .,and confident of their decisions.
Can I just say, that gray is really his color
Yup that’s about right 😂…I remember those days from when I was a bartender
Very Short YT Do you accept Jesus Christ as lord and saviour   Please  Surrender your lives to Jesus Christ    John 3:16 (KJV)  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believe in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.       Romans 10:9-10 also says, “If you confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.           and You must Repent To repent, about salvation, is to change your mind from unbelief to belief in Jesus Christ and to flee from sin...m.mm.mm.

If you're reading this, keep safe, don't lose heart, and stay strong. 2022 can be endured with kindness, positivity, and resilience. During these turbulent times there is still hope in the middle of the fear. There are good news, God promises to be with you because he loves you. "For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life" John 3:16. I just want to let everyone know that Jesus loves you with a passion more than you can imagine. He gave his life so you can be free. Give your cares to him, for he cares for you. If you've got pain He's a pain taker If you feel lost He's a waymaker If you need freedom or saving  He's a prison shaking savior  If you're got chains  He's a chain breaker.  Don't let your heart be troubled. I wish everyone the best day

THIS IS THE SAME PERSON! 🙌
I literally saved the butts of the last kitchen I worked in. Went on a break and ran right into the health inspector at the store next to us. I knew we were next, spun my pregnant butt around and flew into the kitchen with the news. Actual panic ensued.
The timing on this video. Health department literally came to the Chipotle I work at LOL
Lol💜

Ironic
If you think it may be dirty and HD shows up it goes in the dish pit. If it might be out of date toss it out and grab new stuff. Just do whatever you can to make sure there aren’t any major violations.

I always ran a tight ship but everyone looses their grip with someone watching. Also, forget anyone that does this during rush hours. Please do it at like 3:30 we had time to clean after lunch rush and we're cleaning for dinner. Thanks
The most accurate thing ever. No restaurant kitchen is regularly cleaned and maintained to health standards, except when someone smells the inspector (and if you're part of a chain or franchise a fellow store will call ahead to every other same restaurant in the area to tell them inspector is making his rounds). Not to say the kitchen is always gross, just that health code is a tad over the top, partly because crew is always too short staffed {especially now} to be able to keep the gold standard maintained. But we try our best

The accuracy
😭😭😭
One time we were getting an audit, and I was throwing some chicken wings into a tub. And one fell onto the floor, but, I was done with what, I was doing. I turned and in front of my boss and the inspector. Bent over picked up the wing, I looked up and the look of terror on their face was immeasurable. All, I could say was,   "im throwing it away I'm not dumb"
Having worked in food before it always frustrated me when we had to scramble around like chickens with our heads cut off. Just do right from the start.

"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus
The Accuracy!!! Hahaha
Hilarious!

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Hi, i wanna get reply...
Idk if anyone had a similar experience to mine but when I worked at long John's silvers and track bell combo store, whenever someone would come for inspection they would never actually  inspect anything and just leave after 10 minutes with a bunch of free food. I think I only saw behind our fryers once lmao
I was Sous at a small fancy place for years and this is hilariously spot on.
When on cruise ship, he even watched closely us (the server) when we washed our hands
I was 10 min into my shift supervisor shift on a Friday morning right after peak when they health department walked in. The morning crew hadn't cleaned anything and we were still busy so everything was still insane. Thankfully the store manager was still there and he was super chill and looked at the back first to give us time to get a little more organized. To say my heart dropped to my butt when he walked in would be an understatement. 😬😬🤣🤣
25 yrs BOH & now on the dark side as a state inspector ... this is so true it hurts!!! 👍

Damnit PICKLES!!! Head Chef wanted to blow a gasket when he said, "Want Some Candy?" Just know Poor Pickles got an Ear-Full as soon as Health Depo Man left. 🤣😂🤣😂   Also Pickles from the beginning of the short, is just so spot on. There are countless "PICKLES" out there in the World of Line Chef's 🧑🏻‍🍳🧑🏽‍🍳👨🏼‍🍳👨🏿‍🍳👩🏼‍🍳👩🏽‍🍳  "OH NO!! Uhhhhhhhh....." "My fridge stopped working 2 days ago!!" ((Damnit just Use a Thermometer bro))  "Idk, Idk, Idk, Idk.... It's TOO BIG!" ((For Gods sakes Pickles, Just put it on man!! #HairNet))  OMG Pickles I would have LOST it!! I'm getting so annoyed just watching this.... 👀😂
We had a code word to try to make it less obvious. Waffles. And one time she was coming and nobody remembered the  word so I was just looking crazy foing around saying waffles, waffles gosh damn waffles yall!! They finally caught on lol
Why is Pickles wearing Nico's uniform? Or nametag? I was so confused I thought Pickles' real name is Nico then the long haired guy is Nico, too?

Same thing happened when we had HACCP monthly audit LOL
Nah, if you've ever worked for a chain restaurant with a head office that is slacking on getting you essential things that "aren't in the budget" the health department is your friend!! Hey Mr Health Dept, here's the rusty walk in fridge shelves, here's the email from me notifying head office and here's their reply denying new ones. What's that you say, you'll rip Head Office a new one, get them to order new shelves, and say how wonderful and professional I am whilst not letting on that it was me who told you? Why thanks!
Cringe af
Hahaha the hair nets are spot on.
This lady is hilarious 😂

Health dept never comes during service. This is fake.
Solid
“是以万物莫不尊道而贵德”，这是老子指出“道”与“德”的重要。当然在老子的时代，对“道德”两个字的观念，并不是我们后世现代的观念。现代一般人以为，对人对事温笨笨的态度就是道德；其实那个样子不是道德，而是乡愿，是很坏的行为。道德是对善恶是非有正确的认定，而且有所作为，不是一般人所讲的中庸。一般所认定的中庸，并不是真正的中庸含义，那只是乡愿的马虎、含糊、是非不分、善恶不明。孔子说，“乡愿者德之贼也”，这种所谓乡愿的人，从表面上看起来，好像很有道德，实际上为善不能，为恶也不敢，根本谈不上道德。一个乡愿之人，在乡巴佬眼里看起来，是个滥好人，如此而已。可叹的是，后世道德的观念，差不多都属于乡愿的范围。  把“道”当成道德，也是错误的；“道德”的真正解释，在老子的学说就是四个字，也可以说是六个字，那就是“道生之，德畜之”。所谓“道”给人生命，给人安全，是生生不已。“德”能够养育万物，养育众生，所以“万物莫不尊道而贵德”。“尊道”是尊重它的体，“贵德”是注重它的用。这是老子指出来的体与用的重要。  他又强调：“道之尊，德之贵，夫莫之命而常自然。”他说这个“道”为什么那么可尊呢？“尊”者尊重也，高也。这个“道”是那么高远，那么伟大，那么了不起！“德”是由“道”发出来的用，又是那样的宝贵。这一切是谁做主的？上帝吗？菩萨吗？还是阿拉吗？到底哪个做主？“夫莫之命”，其中生命的根源，不可说不可明！不能用人世间功利思想的看法解释。那是自己本身的一个力量，是至善“而常自然”的。  千万要注意，所谓“自然”，不是近一百年来所谓自然科学的那个“自然”，现代自然科学的“自然”，只是借用了老子的“自然”名词，而叫做“自然科学”。在老子当时，根本没有什么“自然科学”这些名词。老子的“自然”，是他所创的一个名词，含义就是：本身当然如此，也是必然如此，不需要另加解释的，就叫做“自然”。所以他说“道之尊，德之贵，夫莫之命而常自然”，没有另外一个人做主，没有另外一个力量，没有谁的命令，是“道”本身有如此的功能。
This is hilarious. It enrages me to see people doing gross things when they cook.  1. Drop the rag on the floor where you and five other people have been walking back and forth, put it back on the shelf, and then continue to store the hamburger press on it between uses. 2. Ring up my order on the cash register with the same greasy gloves that you just used to put the pulled pork into the to-go box. 3. Scratch yourself with the bare hand that you're making pizzas with. 4. Cut bread on the same cutting board that you JUST had a slab of raw steak on. 5. Drop the squeeze bottle of grill oil on the floor, let it roll around, then pick it up using the same gloved hand that you then proceed to pick up raw hamburger patties. 6. Use the ungloved hand with open sores to make pizza. 7. Use a dry rag and no sanitization agent of any kind to wipe up your child's spit and snot from the front counter where they just sneezed (because you brought your child to work and they're roaming around the restaurant unsupervised).  I've seen all of these things happen with my own eyes. I've often fantasized about being a health inspector and the havoc I would wreak across the land with my power. I'd be a tyrant. No mercy...just lots of gross offenders being sent to the gallows. Ahhh...a girl can dream.
So true I used to hate when we had to throw away family meal

Last time I had to deal with a health inspector my supervisor started quizzing me with questions from the food handlers test. 🤦

How's the weather out there... I didn't notice. 🤣🤣🤣
This is one of the funniest ones! The 1 cook drinking the energy drink & another 1 drinking water? out of plastic "to go" container . . .
ohhh
This is how we treated it when we got a surprise dhs visit at the school I work at. The first day they arrived unannounced into my classroom right after my class had gotten covid and were slowly coming back. We had a one-to-one ratio that day which if you know teaching, you know that one-to-one is the forbidden ratio. The second day the secretary became a runner and ran to each classroom a few minutes before they showed up to warn us. We had nothing to worry about, but it was still so stressful.
the complete chaos!! I love it!

One time the health inspector came in and we'd hired a new host who was a wreck and she had TAKEN OFF HER SHOES AT THE PODIUM! I about died! Luckily the inspector didn't see and I was able to send the manager over to take care of the host. Smh such a nightmare
It's okay to be White
Did Terry the manager just hit me with a   *PURR* 🤣🤣
This is exactly how it is LOL
Once again top tier content  Keep up my man
I'm not a fan of that show with Stewie but I feel like Pickles could be Quagmire's son
Why's that so true
I've done this for fifty years and this is exactly what happens when the health inspector shows up
Goddamn it pickles....🤦🏻‍♂️
as a culinary degree major, this is so relatable lmaoo, i had just finished my internship in one of the 5 star hotels, whenever there's a health inspector everyone just kinda freaks out, even the head chef😭😭
“Health department” and “immigration”. What are two things you shouldn’t say in the kitchen!?   When I was a young cook, I threw away like $400 worth of cheese we imported from Spain. All because someone said health department and I wasn’t sure if it was at a proper temp. I later, eventually, grew into a chef. But damn I was a dumb cook starting out
Ngl i work in a restaurant and not even a cook (food runner/busser still work in the kitchen regardless) and i make sure i clean the kitchen before the end of my shift because i have ocd when things are dirty and i make sure my co workers are doing they job because the thing i need is to be doing their job for them because they disappeared somewhere which lead to me eventually telling them hey idc if you disappear somewhere but at least help keep the place clean before you go do whatever you want . The things people will do is surprising when you ask nicely instead of being a jerk about it.
This is so accurate 😂
Health inspector.  The true test for kitchen workers on who’s gonna fold under pressure and who isn’t lol.
Pickles is my favorite lol. He's so adorably stupid.
It do be Like that
God damnit pickles
Fucken love this guy😂😂 the accuracy here

Wait what about the refrigerator don't leave me hanging. Also can't be mad a Pickles love him so much
This is all to true.
Hilarious 🤣😂😁🤣
Accurate. One time we had just got a new chef and we had to be reinspected 3 or 4 times. Idk how we stayed open.
Some Inspectors are real good people and will keep things on down low. Others deserve food poisoning 10-Fold. Don’t see too much understanding Inspectors anymore sadly.
Pickles is so cute
Lmfaooooooooo if this ain't the truth tho!!!!!
I love pickles ❤️
“Health department”  “Oh what the f*%#”
It’s a unwritten rule in all food establishments.  The manager redirects the health guy to a task he’s unsure about like a broken handle or whatever and asks the health guy his advice about it. Any health department guy is going to talk about said broken handle for 10 minutes, but it isn’t a red strike, it’s a yellow.  You can easily pass the inspection with a yellow. But the point is to buy time for the cooks and bakers to get their shit together. Dates on food, properly stored ingredients etc etc.  it’s pretty ingenious, and every place I’ve worked at does this.
Wow..... Healthcare state inspections are EXACTLY THE SAME!!!!    nurses scattering like cockroaches making everything perfect.....  baaaahaaaahaaaa....  sharpies dating timing everything!    Baaaahaaaahaaaa
Bro I've been in the industry for my entire adult life your shorts hit the resturant business on the head. Keep them up always a good laugh!
I run a hospital kitchen and this is true IF you don't establish routines and cleaning schedules
I remember we had a tip line of sorts, all the servers and managers on our street knew each other so as soon as one place got inspected the rest hunkered down and prepped, knowing we'd all be inspected in the next week or so.
This would be funny except I keep thinking of when I broke down crying on a health inspection because my manager made me clean all the dishes and fix all the health code violations while still waitressing a full dining room by myself. Meanwhile she bribed the health inspector with food and sat on her fat ass. And then continued to make me do everything I fell behind on even after he left. And then laughed in my face when I got frustrated and close to tears
When they health inspector comes our whole Denny's crew scurry like roaches. We have hiding places for our drinks too but we actually keep all the food labeled with the dates and regularly sanitize everything.
I know exactly how this feels...💯🤦🏽‍♀️
😂 u want some candy 👍
I love pickles
QA always gonna tag something
Pickles is a generous soul... Lol..
Lmfao every restaurant nowadays uses this to make employees stay on their tasks 😝
Love these chef focused ones, great work co-writers
We need a part 2 for this. This is GOLD!
Ahhh the quart container water hit different
Amazingly accurate😂😂😂😂
This is entirely accurate, lol
My favorite part was the rags, the rags was an actual panic attack across the kitchen lmfaooo
No lies detected
I used to work at Cracker Barrel and we failed for the rag buckets literally every time they came, the entire time I worked there.
My boss dropped by while I was eating a brownie, had no shame! Think she respected that. She was like been busy today? No, ma'am. Hence brownie. Then I did my I washed my hands and did a travel path lol.  I didn't realize you are suppoused to rub the soap in for 20 seconds, not rub the soap and then rinse for 20 seconds (I never do that long because I am allergic to soap) last time the health inspector came by, but it wasn't a big deal. Also, I was the guinea pig because I wash my hands the most of anyone, which I'm trying not to concern myself about.
Everybody loses their shit when the health department shows up. 😂
Drew really got uniforms printed. The dedication is top notch
Most restaurants are disgusting
I'm not even mad at you, Pickles.
This hits different after weeks of binging kitchen nightmares 😅
Goddammit Pickles
Why can’t you offer candy to a health inspector? Seem like a nice gesture to me
OH MY GOD..."HEARD"!!!! sooo great!
they all got hair nets 😂😂😂
Pickles lol
The hairnet over both his eyebrows😂
Pickles, Pickles, Pickles, you had to offer that guy candy 😱
I felt that that get that rag out of here put it in a bucket
As a customer this is terrifying!
It's funny how where I used to work had 3 men with beards and yet over the 5 years there we never even went through one box of beard nets... 4 a year.
I work in a kitchen as a dishwasher this is extreeeeeeemely accurate lol
Basically, no eating or drinking behind the   Prep line.
Worked with a guy in internal audits where I worked, said he was a former food inspector. The stories would put you off of restaurants.
A beautiful sketch 😍
You ever do stand up? I’d travel far and pay a lot of money to see you if your sketches were as good as these videos are
Just cookin and cleaning
I Didnt get the "candy" part
This is it exactly
I love your shorts. Makes my day.
I wanna be a health inspector so i can walk by all the product and say "huh why do all of these stickers dating from today to 2 weeks ago look like they were written 10 minutes ago? 😂😂😂
No words. So good.
This was me the other day, head and sous chef off…I’m 22 and undertrained and they decided to turn up monday….I was like, here we f…… go lmao
Bro too true
Poor Pickles doesn't even get his own jacket, he's got Nico's 😂
Lmfao
I like pineapple
Love the heard
My dad was the head chef & kitchen manager at a BBQ restaurant. Health Department didn’t scare him because he kept his house in order.  Then the one time he was on vacation and they showed up they got a D.  Obviously they showed up at the peak of a rush, everything was in chaos, and blah blah blah.   At the time the regulations said that the sticker grade had to be facing out of a window. So they called him, asked what to do, and he said place it in the window facing the dumpster so nobody will see it 😂  They changed the rule after that so that it has to be visible from the outside.
Literally the exact same reaction in my kitchen good god this is uncanny
Why is this my McDonald's. The owner shows up and the service staff is putting on gloves and cleaning and the cooks in the kitchen are labeling and cleaning and throwing their drinks out
I work led in a bar and grill as a bartender and I knew the kitchen boys really well..we had a health inspection once and I've never in my time working there seen those guys act so professional and politely...once the due was gone it went back to all sorts of bizzar shenanigans
15 years in a deli and this exact scene happened every time the inspector showed up! I even had an employee panic and offer the inspector something to eat once!🤦‍♂️🤣
This is (unfortunately) the exact same process when Joint Commission or DPH visit hospitals :/
Been a while since I laughed like that haaaa! — says the ex restaurant staff
You got it bro! I hope YouTube will be prosperous for you!

We would always text our neighbor restaurants
Most realistic part: "My fridge stopped working 2 days ago!"
🤣
as a culinary student who just got their restaurant managers lisence this is hilarious! the offering of skittles was PRICELESS
Several years ago, a friend of mine got dinged because one of his longtime employees put an open can of soda in the cooler.
GIVE US MORE PLEASE🤣
Former health inspector - this is 100% accurate
My fridge stopped working two days ago had me rolling.
My job at chipotle in a nutshell lol
I wish the fast food places I worked at got inspected shit was disgusting
we do the same in my kitchen
NO LIDS!!
Pickles!!
“Pssst guys..code black!”
The best health inspectors don't hesitate and will go directly to the kitchen. This gives the staff no time to cover up the nasty practices that can KILL PEOPLE...
Central Ohio here most of the health department people I've had come in are ex cooks so by extension they're bros
Relatable
🤣🤣 all the labels have today’s date and the temp logs are identical 🤣🤣
It's crazy how every character feels different. You're a god, my guy.
We failed 2 health inspections,  still didn't get shut down.
The kitchen staff got new uniforms 👍🏻
That “AWW WHAT THE F#@CK” was so authentic.
I literally have to watch these 20 times to catch it all and still miss things...Pickles is wearing one of Nico’s tops-LOL.
This is hilarious. I never work in a kitchen before but all your skits are so funny lol
It's exactly this way in every food service environment 😭😂 "QUICK ECOLAB IS HERE MOVE ALL THE CLEAN DISHES TO THE DIRTY SIDE SO THEY CAN'T DING US FOR WATER STAINS"
Hahaha this is such an accurate representation of when the EHO turn up
We had a surprise inspection a week ago. We got a 92 but there's little things I'm still trying to fix. I'll have anxiety till it's done but unfortunately those projects seemed small but require a lot more effort 😵
It was really like that 😂
THE DATE LABELS!! Omg!! Every single time...the candy just fucked it up!! Lmao
God damn it pickles…..
Oh Pickles!  LOL!  Generous to a fault...
As a professional pastry chef....... Why is this so Mother Effin accurate?
You gotta have nico come in super stoned one time
One spot I was at, I was about to clock out and they came. Chef threw a roll of labels at me and just said, “Run. Go. Walk in. Now.” Me being 5”2 jumping, slapping labels on everything on the top rack while FOH is stalling.
One time the health department guy came for an inspection and left some of his stuff behind. He came back at the end of the day and started following me to the back to get it. He took one step in to the kitchen, looked at our cooks with no hair nets, no gloves, and water cups out. Looked at me, looked at them, and said "I'll just go wait at the front" 😂😂
True lol. Everyone gets so awkward and tense at work
There is always that ONE guy eating something. EVERY. DAMN. TIME. 🤦‍♂️
2 guys named Nico?
You should not give a fuck. As a good employee you should do what you was trained to do on regular basis then the rest is the management fault. If you get fired, you sue.
Health Department people are sooo anal... MF even checked the tabasco bottle caps that theu didnt have dryed tabasco residue
And the inspectors never show up when everything is running smoothly.  It's always when everything has gone straight to hell.  Kudos from a former kitchen manager, Drew - this is spot on!
We used to always butter up the inspection guy with a cheese steak.
I love the accuracy here. The new labels the sudden temp check.  Chef kiss perfection
So accurate.   I worked morning prep shift and some how we always got hit by health department as soon as I'm going to go get changed. And they for some reason loved to come on Fridays.
This speaks to my SOUL. My shift never gets the health department visits but we do get corporate office inspections for quality control and i usually have to run around the kitchen tossing any drinks or towels away asap and telling everyone the "man in the yellow hat" (the guy that comes looks like the handler from Curious George lol) is here. Everyone suddenly doesn't have jewelry, has a name tag, doesn't have clean towels in their aprons, the sanitizer buckets are suddenly clean, snacks are in the trash, and nobody touches their hats with their gloves hands.  Oh you food service workers youuuuuuuuuuuuu :b
100% accurate. We had this trashcan that only ever held frozen paper fry bags from the freezer from when we'd drop fries in the fryer. No way for the health inspector to know this though. I'll never forget after we all were on our best behavior, the new guy pushed down the fry bags in the trashcan with gloves on.....
Drinking out of the quart cups is so accurate lol
Just realized he’s not reusing one apron, they all have different names. Genius.
Pickles is one of my favorites 😂
This is facts all day long!!!
Cooking n cleaning 🤣😂🤣😂 editing was on point
Hey did you drop a stack of 20s?
When the health inspector shows up we basically don’t even serve food.
Any ideas for a service bartender character? No time to talk, super fast, complains about tickets that look all modified, kinda messy, walks away when there's no tickets only to come back at a stack of tickets on the printer, usually spills half the drinks when pouring them into the glass, shakes things with a rocks glass and a tin for 2 seconds, wears wristbands with a bar blade.
So actuate lol
Health inspector came by my job earlier this week and we passed perfectly but somehow I found expired food on the line 2 days later. Obviously no one was doing their job 🤷🏽‍♂️ (we fixed it quick because unlike my other coworkers we have standards)
This just happened to me two days ago lol. Our restaurant is clean as hell though so passed with flying colors
FACTS!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
I work at a restaurant where the health inspectors ate because my boss was a clean freak.
So friggin accurate
As someone who had worked in food industry, this is accurate
Then In your house… raw touches cook and no one gets sick
It's exactly like that.
I love that pickles lost his jacket so Nico gave him his spare
As a health inspector this is 1000% ACCURATE
Ironically this is accurate for grocery store food departments XD we scramble just to be 100% positive everything is perfect
This is so true 😂😂😂😂😂👌
I felt this one with a passion, the "want some candy" guy needs to be sent on lunch the moment they pop up.
💯
At my restaurant they would just feed her the best stuff to keep her happy 🤣
1000% accurate As a Line cook i can definitely vouch for this
When I worked in a kitchen the owner instructed us to just stop what we were doing and leave the kitchen when the health inspector showed up. Since they were probably going to catch us doing something wrong if they watched us cook.
These videos are seriously a restaurant in a nutshell. Working at a restaurant and watching these videos I can't tell the difference. Great job on the videos
True.
PIIIIIICKKKLLLEEESS😩😩😩🤦🤦
Why is that so true health department comes and everybody acts crazy and runs around like a chicken with her head cut off and checking everything temperature removing stuff off the ground making sure it’s on top shelf sanitize water is at the right pH levels machines working and you might have a few people leave the room due to health cards not being on them. Lol . Your half staff becomes a quarter staff lol.
You nailed that one brother!
Why does it have to be like this? Lmao. As a Chef I have always told and taught my staff to always follow code from the moment you walk in the kitchen. You can’t fix everything but if you’re prepared and you work proactively this will never happen.
I feel this
Worked at so many restaurants can confirm
“Heard” gave me ptsd
It pains me that this is true
at the restaurant i worked at we weren't supposed to say rag, because it was considered an offensive term to women lmao
This guy is like the human clone of Morty's father, Jerry.
This hits so hard
Where I live the health dept comes to inspect but they give you like a week to fix everything they found and then they come back and inspect again lmaoo
The guy drinking out of the soup container.. love it.. that's real shit
I work in the restaurant business and this is EXACTLY how it is.
I use to work for a school district in a school cafeteria and I'm tellin ya, when the health inspector shows up its panic city. 😆
This is exactly what happened
yup...and i love it when the health inspector is pushy...and knows the manager is stalking and pushes past them and heads to the kitchen and spots all the violations
"Wants some fries"
Everyone runs to make sure everything is dated 😂😂😂 and the rags omfg
Facts haha
If you were on Netflix I’d watch
Flashbacks to my days as a Starbucks manager and hearing the words that sends fear down any employee: QASA.
Subbed
I get confused on why people *want* to keep their restaurants absolutely disgusting. Do I want to eat at a place that fears and hates the health inspector? No.
omg — flashback to my first job. This is exactly what happens!
"Heard"
As soon as I saw the plastic container being used as a cup, I looked away and shook my head. That is literally what all of us in restaurants drink out of, all the time lol
Beat episode yet
LOL 🤣🤣🤣🤣 All that hard work and on yahoo screws up knowing the inspector is there.
this is funny and all but now i’m concerned for myself
🤣🤣🤣💯
Dude. This shit brings back nightmares from being a line cook, and the sound of a ticket printer still gives me ptsd lol. I'm sooooo glad I got out of this industry, fuck people bruh.
😂😂😂 so glad I stumbled across his page
😂😂😂😂I’m effin dying so accurate. 😂😂🤣🤣🤣😂
I felt this on so many levels
How has he got me convinced that each character is a different person 🤣🤣
🤣🤣🤣😂…. Your good! 😉
110% accurate man, the worst is after the lunch rush. The bain hasn't been flipped, the walk-in looks like a nuke went off. Oh and the masking tape for dates is M.I.A.
This is so accurate lmao
Lmao the cooks drinking on the job is accurate af😂
This guy brings the party with him😂
So accurate 🤣
I watched a racist health inspector give my boss a hard time over a couple rubber baseboard pieces was peeling away like the caulk just needed to be touched up. My boss had 24hrs to fix it and he knew he was dealing with a racist health inspector so he had just paid to have the entire rubber baseboards replaced so they were brand knew. One stupid issue over a perfectly clean and sanitized pizza shop too and he was getting threatened with the rejection over that.
Working as the chefs right hand man the last 2 and a half years I can confirm that we got super intense with double checking everything. We got flawless records 2 years running. But once we both left that restaurant they failed cause the new staff was unhygienic,
Lmfao so true!!!
Why are you so good at these characters 😆 I can’t even act or be myself at work, let alone 20 characters
First place i worked at they threw the inspector on me cause i had just read up on everything hygiene and health in school. Only issue was grimy fridge doors but the guy was cool and let us off if we cleaned them before he was done with his inspection
There's always that one guy who gets us marked off..
Man, I used to work at a Michelin star place that neeeeeeded that A. When DOH showed up we literally stopped service, told people their food wasn't coming, and threw away several thousand dollars worth of product to avoid even the chance of B or lower.
It's amazing that one guy can do all characters and it's so well done that your brain totally accepts it.
Best video yet
Ohhh Pickles! *cue laughing track*
The way you actually take on the personality of each character is so  amazing to me!
Lmbo. That's exactly what goes on .. from my experience anyways lol  they be walking in like they the damn police 😂

this is 100% accurate
Literally exactly what happens lol
This is ment to be a joke but this is extremely accurate 😂 🤣 😅
DAMN IT PICKLES!!!!!
Just cooking and cleaning...washing the fridge with this here fish and making the soup of the day, Dirty rag soup!
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 i used to work as a deli clerk and this was spot on!!! Everyone even the boss would freak when the health department arrived.
Lmao our health department was so corrupt. They met with our franchise owner for lunch and they would drink and laugh for 3 hours and leave without inspecting shit.
“BIG MAN IN THE HOUSE” was our code word lol
Used to work at a care home and would panic so bad when OHS randomly showed up she would follow us around and make sure everything was good to go so we would have somebody distract her while the rest fixed little details here and there
Worked at a pizza place. Hearing “new dates on these labels” is so true.
What about the dishwashing getting kicked out???
Accurate. I used to expedite, so things on my side were fine, but the kitchen would turn into this
That just reminded me ...I'm   Going a restaurant tonight... Wife's birthday... What's Huddys like? Would you recommend it?
"the fridge stopped working two days ago" 😂
Worked at many restaurants…back of house…you have nailed everything to the T!!!
ahhhh, I don't miss that stress
Ummm this makes ur restaurant look bad my dude
Hey they're wearing chef's uniforms instead of backwards shirts now
Same in nursing homes
Even the places with gold seals are the same
Facts
Wait, is this the 'compliments to the chef' guy from a few videos ago?????
Man it was like this at every restaurant i worked at.
Pickles lol this is EXACTLY how every kitchen Ive worked in ever reacts, in fact one job made us roll all the fryers and half the food behind the dumpster before health department showed up lol
The hair net over Pickles' hat I cannot XD
HAHA getting the rags in the bucket 😭😭😭 ACCURATE
POV: Waffle House
I’ll charm him with candy he’ll love us it’ll be great
why does pickle’s name tag say nico?
Worked at Chipotle for a couple years and I don’t know if it is just poor work from the team that inspected us but honestly they’re a joke.
Lol probably the same in every field!
Yes so true lol
“I need new dates on all these labels.” That was me yesterday when they were at a nearby store. They never showed up though. But yeah I was running around dating everything. We don’t always date cause we are so busy nothing lasts long enough to expire. 7 days from opening, they don’t last 2 hours most of the time.
As a chef 👨‍🍳 this is 💯 accurate 🤣
Another banger, Drew! Thank you!
Absolutely hilarious  - the hair nets and rags in the coat!!! 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Haha
😁😁😁😁😁😁
Frickin pickles 🤣🤣
Pickles is the best😂🤣
As a former kitchen worker… this is so true.
Hekkin accurate, we all panicked when the health department showed up
You’re such a character, your videos always make me laugh!
I want to eat at a restaurant entirely staffed by this guy in 20 different wigs.
I don’t get why he’s a idiot for offer candy 😂
😂😂😂 there's always that one guy that ruins the score
Realest shit
"Put the rag in the bucket"
It’s always the dates
Roll tide
That's what's pre shift checklists are for
This is perfect! I just received my first 100 score of my career 3 days ago!
Everywhere when health department shows!
Yeah I remember we had health inspector drills so we could hide all the shady shit we did in less than 2 minutes
Omg lol so true
Health department day is always the worst day.  😂🤣
100!!
You guys should get Terry. Terry doesn't give a fuck about anything.
Don't forget you gotta stop cooking everything. I don't care what you got on the grill throw it out now
The rags in the buckets hit home....
My favorite moments managing kitchens is when the delivery drivers leave meat and produce cases on the ground in the middle of the lunch rush and then the health inspector drops by.
Man your edits are so good! How long does it take you to edit a skit like this?
Anyone who worked in a restaurant knows you just slip the health inspector a bribe and that’s the end of the inspection.
Of course it had to be Pickles who inadvertently ruins it 😂
Health dept inspection is a cake walk compared to the Corporate food saftey audit.
Holy hell.. this is ON POINT Lmaooo
PIIICKLES, NOOOO BABY 🤦🏾‍♀️🤣😂
Huhhhh pickles hes just got confused lol but hell everyone loves pickles cant fire him
The common enemy of the entire restaurant
Sweet Pickles
You are hilarious!  I love your talent, skits, creativity, everything is just funny and fantastic!  Perfect respresentation.
We usually weren't as worried about the health department as we were the quality control unit from olive garden. But either way, the moment someone looking suspiciously official was spotted walking up we were muttering into the headset and if there was enough coverage at the front, spreading the word around 😂
My dad was a chef at this little Italian place and he always had a bag of sour patch kids next to him
LOL This post is perfectly timed! LOL The Health Department visited my cafe yesterday and did the same thing! Everything was already date dotted but we still panicked and made sure everything was in good condition just in case XD The health department uses the temperature guns on everything in the store now like they're the food police so it was fun LOL
the rag situations is sooo true
Well…. They must know JACHO.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣   Pickles candy is equivalent to nurses cups at the nurses station.. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm surprised they didn't try to bribe him
As a Public Health Inspector...this is so true.
Always great content!
8th lol
They normally give a notice so the night before management is extra nice so we can extra extra clean 😂
Shit always goes down when Health Department shows up👀
Pickles is so pure 😭❤️ give me that candy
my kitchen is clean, i'm not afraid, but if one more time an a**hole tells me that i can't eat in my own kitchen i'm going full Jackie Chan on them
I knew pickles was going to do that.
Everyone gangster until the health department shows up
Hi
