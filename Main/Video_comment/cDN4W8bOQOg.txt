a zintu infected with the british football VIRUS how awesome is that TUSON UNITED FURY
Hope he turns up and grips a few of them round the throat
These overpaid, overhyped, overrated prima donnas don't care enough to fight for that Jersey. As an Inter Milan fan I've seen how Mancini instilled a winning mentality at inter by focusing on winning a league Cup then doubles. I bet my City mates he'd do the same at City and he did. The rest is history. Winning is a train of thought and habit. As is losing. United need to change a few key players first then instill a new mentality.
I want to superglue Ole to the wheel. I like the way he drives Utd....................to the ground
Yeah get them all to box cuz they are f*ckin shite at football..then get the bulldozer & knock Satan's den down very very old Trafford.. because let's face it Liverpool are the GODS
I live like not even a kilometre away from the united training ground could've met tyson😂
Stick to boxing mate, just ignoring oles tactics is stupid at this point
Well said big man !! ,,,,,while your down there   see if you can persuade pogba to wash the Man City blue out of his hair ,,,,, Not a good look??
He talks, you listen. Or else.
Truth
Tyson don’t tell me your a Man Utd fan ..? Please Noooooooo
Barcelona should take some notes down ✍
Appoint Tyson as the next manger they'll never lose again and if they do God help them.👊
Imagine Tyson rocking up on Cristiano Ronaldo and telling him straight... I think good ol' Cris would soil himself
muppet comments ..meathead mentality... Manager Ole has no clue of todays football thats the problem .....NOT the players
Fury should be United next manager
This dude has a throne ? Of course he does.
Ok
Nice
Knock ole out tyson fury his the problem 👊🏼
Whoever plays the worst has to go 6 rounds with Tyson. Should motivate the players
Lol 🤣
There is a Indian-American CEO who hired a woman to slap him whenever he opens up Facebook. Utd need to hire Fury.
hope tyson hits them a boot up the backside, for sure some hard words are needed, we get ronaldo and varne and the rest switch off. playing worse now than before are stellar signings. disconnect from deff to mf to fwds is shocking. almost as bad as the defense. seemed terrified when varne went off and constantly out of position. school boy stuff. i wonder if there wages took a hit would they start "digging deep". tbh before ollie showed up thats what i thought of most of them just happy to be there picking up the pay check.
Maguire v Fury is what I am here for. Set it up. Fury's got the golden fists but I am pretty sure that head of Maguire's is made of vibranium.
You’re talking to dead men Tyson
What he really needs to do is Punch Up Ole & we’ll be better off for it..   Whether Ole can’t continue as manager due to the beating or he’ll get his head on & become a better manager 😂
Aim that at ole.. get out or I'll jab you out
Ole needs to buy top cdm January and varane coming back will really make big difference will have a proper good strong defence trio which will work well and allow team to attack score goals we will get def top 4 and win the CL . come on Ole
Football is different...it's a big Team Game. You may have heart and passion all you want or run like a headless chicken. The truth is if you don't have the ball you can't hurt the opposition so about you help us to knock OLE Out so that we can get a better Coach or Knock Joe Glazer out in the parking Lot that will make my day lol 😆
Um! Life lessons from Tyson Fury, that's almost as comical as Bojo trying to run the country!
Tyson fury> ole this dude boutta pull out da whip if he was the coach making man united A BEASTTT
Fury is absolutely spot on. Come on Pogba, Maguire, Sancho, Greenwood, Shaw, etc. Stop hiding, stop using Social Media and get out there and do your talking where it matters!!!!!!  Only Cavani, De Gea and Ronaldo are showing any fighting spirit.   GGMU.
😂🤣
Stick to boxing mate.. yanited beating city is like wilder beating you.. not happening
The Tyson Fury team talk in the dressing room would cause ultimate diarrhoea to these united players!
Fred is shaking right now
Tyson fury the next Manchester United manager 😂
Love to see Tyson fury rock up to training and  give them roasting hahaha 😝there’s only one tyyyyson furrryyy
Winning mentality all well and true in a 1 vs 1,different story with 22 people on the field
Ole in. We still trust the process! He can turn it around.
Hopefully goes down bangs the lot of em😂 especially block face
The city game was like a nightmare guys. I don't even remember the good old days😢 we are losing "that thing". We aren't even seen as title contenders. Our players do not seem to understand the history behind the shirt they wear. For the love of God someone tell Ole to have the ballsacks to sack these lads that aren't here to play for us coz they just don't understand that it has been too many seasons now and the club is turning into a joke
I'd like to see Tyson get up in the dressing room before the next match and try and inspire these lads. I sat lads because I don't see men on the current side, just highly paid lads. Evra, Vidic, Rio, Rooney and older players like Keane, Bruce and the Dane were men - hard men at that. We don't have anything resembling a hard man at the club. But I'd like to see one - it's a forgotten position in the modern game.
Put Tyson Fury in goal for them...... That will equate to the usual two buses they badly park!!!!!!!!
Man Utd players are all big bum dossers
Listen to this man tire words
Did gary ask him to do this to take the heat off ole
Chin Woodward please
Manchester United is full of non-Manchester united players. Half the players need to go, a long with Solkjaer.
Thank you Tyson..
"... for a last couple of games" pffffffffft 😂😂😂
Well said tyson
Spot on…..
Stick to boxing bums mate.
I agree with Tyson Fury. This man should be part of this team. He has the mentality to motivate not only the players but also the management. Also who ever is the scout is useless. He has no idea who are the best players to bring in. The scout is a disaster.
I hope  he did do it
If the United players had just a little of what this man has, they would be something  like ok.
😂😂😂 pls Tyson go down there and give them some of these 🤜🏾
Well said champ those highly paid dicks could do with taking a leaf out of your hard earned book 📙
I'd have him on the staff, handing out 'encouragement' when the players slack off.
Well said,They don't have fear of loosing that is the problem. They think its OK to loose some time.That is not the pro football ,That is prostitution.
Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Fury for next United manager.
Fury should get Paul ponga in to the ring and give him a good battering for being so useless.
And Patrice Evra 😂😂 Cleary just there to make Tyson look even scarier. What a duo those two would be standing side by side
Ronaldo is the only person who has what tyson described
You talking crap. It's Olé and his coaching staff!
United need boxers to motivate them 😂 this is getting out of hand 😂
Yeah they need some punch
😂🔥
He’s right 100% only few of the hv the united spirit the rest is just don’t hav the united worries, ani I believe u guys also agree thay some of the play  tha ole hv been given don’t hv the united quality and standards why is that?? Who scouted them 4 players??? Are there coming from united academies?? Vary poor quality mates..
cheater
My boxing hero needs to come in and show  them what spirit means. We were comeback kings for decades. Now, we need THE Comeback King to come and remind Them.
Give em a slap Tyson & kick Ole out the door while your at it.
Signing cr is a huge mistake
Go Fury.. Say it buddy...
True champ! He should go into a locker room and give each of these dossers a decent slap. No one would even squeal. Be prepared!
Well said👍🏻💪🏻
Dossers United
Tyson Fury in, Ole out! Even Tyson give better motivational speeches than Ole the motivational speaker. (Not a manager)
why is he sitting on a throne
The fury of Fury
They’re a pack of frauds and a disgrace. The club is rotten to the core. It needs to be bought out by the fans and have a complete restart. Half those dopey shites need to go.
Probably the best dressing room the man utd players had for a very long time.
I think hne means that
If you can't beat them than you break them.
Conte, "I kill you!"
Just watching this I unlocked 5 star skill moves
Key words right there... Winners Mentality!!!
That's a load of bollox ,there not good enough simple as that ,some  inspiration from a boxer wont change that ,a new manager and 3 or 4 new players might tho
New manager
Ronaldo would whoop Furry just saying. 🤷
Sort out those Dossers Tyson
Fury at Carrington sort them out🤣
He’s just needs to say come on we’re all going to do a little bit of sparring after  you go out and play and don’t blame me if I’m in a bad mood it will be your fault LOL
United are properly inconsistent, and not digging deep as Tyson says, but the did have the winner's mentality against Atalanta and Tottenham recently. They got the players but their attitude is poor. Also, Ole doesn't seem to be able to find the right strategies against the big teams.
Tyson Fury knows whats lacking.  Bunch of Dossers.
Hahahahah man united hahahahahah what a complete joke that club is
After watching this Ronaldo:(on phone)hello Mendez any offers yet??? Mendez:What offers??? Ronaldo:Just turn on your tv and check any channel and you’ll see the headlines…fury coming for United players
Fury unintentionally trolling his own team there.
what is he sat on
He loves this club
Not even Tyson can save us😂
Tysons fury is right. But...be prepared.
Tyson at the wheel
🤣🤣 its great seeing all these man u glory supporters crying
Top man Tyson squeeky bum time at the training pitch thinking the Gypsy King is going to tell them what's what top bloke is Fury 😁
GO PLAY FOOTBALL RUN UP AND DOWN THE PITCH FATTY!! you can tell he's drunk all the fury family think there gods gift after Tyson is champ !! You can't fix stupid
Love Tyson. One of the greats. But this is nonsense. You can't compare boxing to a team game like football. They can have the desire to win all they want but if their tactics and coaching are non-existent then they'll get walked off the park. Sure, Tyson in the moment can find the grit and determination to get off the floor which is so impressive. What on earth has that got to do with players in the moment coming up with better tactics and organization?
Fantastic idea Tyson, the only problem is the players will tell you they are trying to get rid of Ole and his mate coaches. When they do get rid, we want to send you in at half time lol if they are loosing love to be fly on the wall you going in at halftime with your dad, What a second half to watch, Thanks Tyson for the support MUFC.
Ole at the wheel, la la
If this guy was the coach the players will play well just because if they don't they'd get knocked out each loss
I think we found Oles replacement..
Tyson Fury to coach Man U
Tyson fury as manager
Tactics. You can't play without them
when will the world realise this: There are maybe FIVE world class managers (Klopp, Tuchel, Pep, Zidane, maybe Conte). If a club has to overpay someone by hundreds of millions of dollars, it should be for signing managers.  Just simply supply and demand.. There are dozens or maybe hundreds of world class players, but they meant nothing without a good manager.
scary !
He gonna start boxing them up like a box of pizza
its our defence end off , i think we need the dynamic duo back in smalling n phil jones to show em how its done lol
OLE OUT
Why we always blame the manager he's the one who keep us at the top of the table last season and how you guys react last season you are the one who praise Ole for what he done
Put fury in defence 😂
Fury for manager
Tyson Fury be my dad
Ole out Tyson in.
Harry maguire wants to dribble. So ole should let him be the cf and dribble. That way there will be less goals scored against man united. Also transform luke shaw as the asst. ref.besides he has the pace to match any players.
Bout time someone told these over paid panseys
Look at his chair, golden drapes.. the man is a douchebag
Tell Sean Dyche to teach his son what tactics are, even the coaches at burnley would be better than united’s
Put Fury in defence and give him the captaincy job done
Maybe he come must throw a few Furyous, or even Wilder punches in the dressing room, then perhaps they might not have been knocked out in the 1st round of the Carabao, eventhough Bruno Penaldinho did try to steal a technical point in the dying minutes of the game...that's probably y Usain Bolt attended the next 2 matches, 2 hand over his 3 OG medals to him 4 that unbelievable sprint
Ahhhh it's so weird! Tyson Fury sounds exactly like my doctor 😂 growly voice and everything!
Proves that you can make it to the premier league without being passionate about your football
Lool imagine big Fury coming down to motivate you with those words, I feel motivated and I don't play for them! He beat Wilder with 2 broken elbows, guys a legend.
Referees helped United when fergie was in charge
Man utd is and will be shyte
Fury in ole out.. fury can do better than ole
Ole can't get the players to play for him
Thanks Tyson, sound advice. I think  you should pay the Glazers a visit💪
Fckin good luck😂😂😂
That’s why I’m saying these players don’t deserve to wear the Man Utd shirt! You need grit and bravery and believe ! These clowns are just passing through games not giving a fk
Nope it's called the Ferguson mentally
Tyson's definitely at the wheel. Unfortunately United's players are very contented passengers on the happy bus to Moneyland.
any uvva man avevafoort
Just put Fury in charge of training
LMAO
I don't think the united players will argue with Mr fury....
Tyson fury saturation point
awesome go to the club mate!!fire them up!!
Please invite Roy Keane too
“Whatever happens, happens” yep and they still get paid.
good luck calling out CR7, the rest of those bums like fred and mctominay you can call out but CR7? dude has done it all won it all at club level.
Ole gone fury in 😂😂😂
Very well said!!!
Yay Fury gonna save Ole!
Oh you just love to see it
Ole is not the man - we need a manager who has good tactics, as the players looked clueless and didn’t know what to do.
Maybe he should have Ole coach his boxing. Considering he has no credentials in both.
Supporting the wrong team Tyson. CTID
I don't think it's primarily the player's faults. I think the team put together by the manager and coaches is disjointed, they are simply not a cohesive unit on the pitch. They're swimming against the tide in a situation like that. I haven't watched too many games but have seen most of the CL games. What kind of tactic is bypassing the midfield by hoofing the ball from defence to the left/right wing in the hope that Pogba or Sancho get it like against Villareal at OT? An elementary tactic which you might expect of amateurs. The same was done against Young Boys, by all accounts. The ball needs to be on the ground most of the time, played through midfield, worked to Ronaldo. Its criminal to rely on long balls in the air when there are passers like Bruno, Pogba, Van de Beek, Sancho and Matic in the team.
Bringing his 5quid throne from B+M?
Your a boxer  Not a football manager shut up
Lol what’s he gonna do? Spank Ole??
It's an easy fix Minimum Wage until proven otherwise £8 hr should give them all the boost they need 🤣
Harry Maguire: ManU center back for life!!   -The entirety of EPL strikers.
Can only imagine the changing room speech, 'Get out there and win you bunch of dossers!'
Fred and Maguire were good players under Mourinho. He problem is Solskjaer. There is a reason why Fred was linked to Manchester City and Chelsea before United. If he players for them he’d be the same player from Shakhtar Donetsk. Same for Maguire, he was top of Josep Guardiola’s shopping list but wouldn’t pay more than what he felt was reasonable. Even the same with Wan-Bissaka. The problem is Solskjaer but the Glazers need him as their lightning rod on the football side of things While they do what they want on the business side of things.
But you can believe and get it wrong.
🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Tyson fury to replace Ole
I think Ronaldo is the only one that works hard him and Cavani but luke shaw needs to be trained like po from Kung fu panda they need to dangle food in his face to get him to run
tyson and roy keane take over please
Tyson Fury means 'They were playing like a bunch of dosser'
Harry maguire will be at blackpool beach next year and charging £10 for a 5 minute trot.
Mr Fury you have to understand City and Pool are not Wilder they are like Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali.
Ya big dosser
To Tyson: I hope it's only the hard word you are willing to give -- and nothing else. This team needs to stay physically and mentally healthy -- and not to entertain the ubiquitous "choke machines" of social media along with their "friendless fans" feeding them to the fishes, when a few loaves of love during hard times could see the return of Manchester United's hunger and desire on their way back.
That's very true mancester united was lost of its winning mentality, and this should've been done by replacing the manager, enough is enough
Ronaldo is the only player with the perfect mindset on that team. Pogba is terrible.
Fury, stick to boxing.  You’re only champion due to a lack of quality in your weight class.
maguire, shaw , de gea , 3 fking useless twats
I support chelsea but Thomas tuchel would save United if he takes over ole but I prefer him to stay
tyson champion supporting a shitte team lol .
Man U have been k/o’d by Liverpool, then k/o’d by man city so tyson fury should pay them a visit and k/o them and make It a hat trick.
What Tyson needs to do , is tell them that he is going to send his Dad , big John Fury , down to the training ground and give them a good talking to. I think that might get them going
Tyson Fury: You lot play like bloody doosers. Absolute sausages infact.
Definatley get Tyson fury on the coaching ground to get the players in the right mind set . Where as the winning mind set gone . Take the captin’s arm band of Harry and give it to Ronaldo asap
Just give united a proper coach
They’re a bunch of dossers Tyson!
Man Utd are full of big dossers
I would take this colossus in the centre of Man Utd defence right now over the centre halves that they have
oooooooooooohhhh!!!
Become a Liverpool fan at least get battle hard when losing
Ole out, Fury in
What a legend
Fury just saved uniteds season lol
Please knock out ole ,Fred and maguire
Tyson as Interim till the summer.
Not a football fan here 🙋🏻‍♂️  How do you all care about your teams in 2021?? Just a serious question.   What “connection” do you have with your team when 80-90% of them are from other countries???   Im just completely dumbfounded by it 🙆🏻‍♂️  The Premiere League has fewer English people in it than a Bradford Mosque
Give him Ole’s job, he couldn’t do worse
When some of the players and 90% of the fans lose faith in Ole and fed up with the Board/Glazers... Nothing good will come out of this.  I don't understand with the board decision, what makes them think he's still capable of managing the club?? His tactics is useless and just rely on individual brilliance, suck at player choice and making subs...   He would be sack in near future anyway, so why not u just sack him now??
Just make Ronaldo Captain and Manager of Man Utd just as Ryan Giggs was a player-manager after Moyes sacking at one stage.
🤣🤣🤣🤣.... Man U is really a laughable club. Their ex players r all over d media making senseless noise, now celebrity fan want to come motivate the players.
Fred and Maguire submitted transfer request
Tyson Fury isn't just the "gypsy king".  he's actual king material.  he might not be the most sophisticated person but he's got the heart of a leader.  1500 years ago this guy would be the king of a tribe, no doubt in my mind
United players need to look at themselves deeply. With all the money they pay you week in week out, you're not putting your best foot forward. The Manager is also part of the blame for United's form.
The players won't fight for a manager who is not at their level. Ole is a championship manager at best. His coaching staff have relegation and failure written all over their CVs. IT'S TIME TO GO! OLE OUT. I bet Woodward paid Fury to say this cr*p
The thing is that other players of other teams have winning mentalities that are stronger than that of ManU players.
Like Ronaldo is gunna listen to this tit if he comes down Carrington giving it big bollocks about winning football matches 🤣🤣
Fantastik
As if i couldnt love this man anymore ...he goes and does something like that🤣🤣🤣🤣 gypsyking!!!!!
Is that not Ole job?
Probably manage the team Better than Ole
Spurs players also
I feel like players will miss training the next day 😂 😂
Should have it in all contracts if you lose or draw you don't get 100% wage bet all of a sudden everyone trys harder lol
I wanted him to call them dossers!
Anybody doesn’t pull their weight, put them in the ring with Tyson.
I don’t know what this bald donny is talking about, United are playing really well for a team of their calibre, stick to the naked man hugging Dyson Furry
Is this the Burnley Mgr 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂👍😂
Patrice Evra!!
Well said Mr Fury. You should be there Manager. If they don't play good. Then they should do ten rounds with you champ lol 😜
Who is this guy anyway. Ole's at the wheel, trust the process
If you give this same team to klopp or tuchel or conte.. they,ll win the champs league..players don't have faith in ole .. so is hard to be inspired by a loser but easy by a proven winner
Tyson Fury vs Christiano Ronaldo December 2021
We are glad to announce that Tyson Fury will be Manchester United manager. 🤣🤣🤣
Play Tyson Fury At Centre Back ... :)
Wtf motivated!!!
Please give to the players
Annoys  me how he sits on a throne and thinks he’s a king  I’ve he army
Without Ronaldo this season could be a lot worse. And no one in the team want to win more the him. And the work he put in is unspeakable.
You speaking real
LOOOOOOOL EVVEN TYSON FURY IS DISGUSTED AT THIS FINISHED CLUB🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🔥🔥🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The winning mentality transmitted  becoming a true winner & a champion. ManUtd in general currently doesn’t have that. Only few players are playing their heart out to win every game. Shame on U for taking huge pay cheque for the standard u guys are putting. Come on Ole, u could done better then last season has “the best players” are under ur hands now. Tyson had said it right on the matters, get ur acts rights …. Never to late ⏰
A can perfectly understand where the Champ is coming from but personally I enjoyed that game.And funny enough I haven't got the BLUES.😊😄😄👍
And take Roy with yahhhh haha
I will gladly pay good money to watch Tyson Fury beat Fred's ass, maybe then we can have Van de Beek play more.
Ole must be driving under the influence of alcohol but, he’s still at the wheel
This Players Narrative is so overused Manchester United has turned to a comedy club. I'm loving it everyone but Ole gets called out 😂 😂 😂 😂
I keep saying that, the players are dishonest get Roy Keane to kick some heads and call them out in the dressing room.
Tyson would eat Ole for a midnight snack and then ask if there's any good restaurants still open
You have to give some credit to Man City. They were dominating at Chelsea too they have very strong squad to dominate in every match against anyone
Conor McGregor, Tyson  Fury, Rory Mcllroy, Usain Bolt, Ronaldo and Beckham should buy the club
If the heavy weight champion says you don’t have the desire and hunger you’re in trouble
Tyson next utd manager
Legend
F & E
Imagine fury teaming up with keane setting about the players lol
Wow, tell it like it is.  Spot on
Like you we are just as frustrated Tyson, we need supporters like you . There was a time when teams came to old Trafford and were very intimidated and left empty handed. Not now you are right ,word for word. 👍👍👍
Pls ,, Do it !!
Great, champ
Ole out Fury in!
Man City spirit 😂😂😂 0-2😅😅
Man United fans  must boycott football matches until ole  has been sacked
He's just saying what we're all thinking
Tyson is missing the point.  Is not the players fault.  He should talk to the owners, management team and the coaches
Talk about a humble threat 🤣🤣
To be fair, it is a good speach but really. It is not the players that its wrong with our coach
100.....been a united fan for almost 30 yrs and this is sad
Did he say Patrice evra? 😂😂😂
Wonder how many games he went to at old trafford before he was world champ 🤔
Sign him as our manager asap .. what can be worse than Ole at the moment 😕
From one slab head to another
Tyson better be getting Maguire in the ring and box him to reality
Why, what's happening at Man U?
It’s all Ronaldos  fault …. Ask the juve players 👍😂
This is why Ty calls Fury a disgrace. He’s a Man United fan.
So you’re just not going to talk about the manager…
Because deep down inside the players, they don't want ole to be at the wheel..
Big Man United fan. It is difficult watching their matches. You never know what team will show up. Makes me sick, really. Our defense has to be one of the worse ever. Harry Maguire is overrated and not captain worthy. Lindelof is terrible. Wan Bissaka is like a chicken with head cutoff. Doesn't have a clue how to cover a striker. Fred is not very good.  On paper, you think you have some of the top talent in the world. On the pitchj, they show no heart and can't put 5 passes together. Poor Cristiano waiting to get service from anyone. Makes the runs and throws his hand in teh air waiting for a cross, but doesn't come.  I don't thinkw e had one shot on net in second half. That is dispicable for a top Premier  league team. These players need to be held accountable. they need to be called out.
Tyson fury should support a better team 🤣🤣🤣
Tyson is a proper English man. We need more of his breed in this country. We’ve gone soft.
Sorry but the coaching and the managers at fault for the tactics on the pitch it's only a small fraction the blame on the players
Paying Pogba all that money with his lazy lackluster ass was the beginning to the end..... Sir Alex must rage on his car rides home....... We do not behave like Manchester players. So fortunate and elated to support...... Bayern München!!!!!!
And thats called a winners mentality
A team tends to reflect their manager’s personality. ‘Nuff said.
Fury speaking the hard truth
Well said tysongo and crush their millionaires egos
They need a knockout
Maybe threats will fix these lots but I doubt it…..
Him and Patrice Evra 😂
Go for the manager aswell fury
Brilliant! Man utd want are aiming to be prem champions in the very near future. If they don't have a winning mentality like Tyson says, it will never happen. Great advice Tyson!
Average manager average results
Its not the players....... ITS THE COACHHHHHHH
What’s evra gonna do 🤣
Well He is not wrong
Ole out, Gypsy king IN!
They need some proper coahing. No amount of heart, belief and workrate will prevent City's passing quality.
I long for the day to see Man City play Man United in the FA Vase final.
Just got over there and knock Solksjaer and his coaching staff out of the club. Thanks
This guy and Harry Maguire is like comparing black with white
Sack ole the pe teacher and hire fury as manager. I bet he could honestly do better just by scaring the players into working harder.
The glazers most be some seriously influential/important people, wow! Tyson Fury along with Gary Nev and the rest holding players to account when the manager is the one to blame as he is tactically inept. Errr look at Chelsea, Lampard could not do anything with the team that Tuchel won the champions league with lol, cannot make this crap up...
Tyson Fury for manager. Fury in
GIVE OLE THAT
Ole out Fury In
Fury is awesome, the Man simply.
tirai n kursi rumah nya tyson kayak rumah juragan di kampung-kampung 😂😂😂
You tell em champ, they are lazy and bone idle dossers
There’s a 145 people in the world who don’t have a sense of humour 👎🏻
Nice video!! Very engaging from beginning to end. Nevertheless, businesses and investment are the easiest way to make money. When it comes to the world of investing,most people don't know where to start.fortunately,great investors of the past and present can provide us with guidance
Oleout.
Muppet 🤣
So true 👍
The Man U players are a joke like, so is the manager and the board. And people try to make a mockery of Newcastle. Please.
Park Ji Sung in Fergies probably on average more in a game than the whole current United combined . Fergie made sure he had all the workhorses and hardmen like Park , Keane and Robson to complement all the prima donnas in his team . Ole inspired his players by telling them ' fantastic' and 'well done 'even after losing 5-0
Make roy Keane and him managers of United
“ Leave them alone stop picking on them big man. Players and Ole are doing a great job”   Signed:   ~ Every other club
Imagine Fury and Maguire having a scrap
It’s a damm shame Tyson has such a weak spot
Would prefer it if he threatened to chin Woodward and the Glazers. Would say Ole too, but it’s not his fault he hasn’t been sacked yet
Chronic losers and now fury’s going down to sort them out , if I was a United player I’d be shtting it
No one wants the ‘Hard Word’ off Tyson Fury… 🥊
Still no one is blaming ole.
McGuire ,yeah you I’m talking to,ya little dosser,ever had your nose broken.😡😠😡😠😡😠😡😠😡.
Ole has so many bosses and motivators Ferguson ronaldo and now tyson fury
Top man
Fury for next United manager
Yeh yes another big mouth be prepared  to loses the title too Tyson
👏👏👏👏👏
Obviously fury is clueless.... not one word mentioned about Ole? Stick to boxing you tart.
Tyson coming in with an uppercut on Maguire and Fred 🤣
They wanna make ole get sacked.
Harry Maguire = £80m. Virgil Van Dijk = £75m. LOLOL
👏
I defy any lawyer to try and tell me this isn’t threatening behaviour? The police should have intervened by now. If I posted a video threatening to turn up at a premier league training ground threatening to physically harm people I would be investigated, so why not for the man who enjoys fighting unskilled boxers?
Send out a warning to the Glazers
This man is a gem, he sees his club in trouble and as a fellow sportsman he wants to help. (I'm Arsenal)
Imagine played so bad that a boxer came out and gave advise!  😹
*only Ronaldo has that never giving up mentality*
Tyson should drop them down a big bag of performance enhancers
100%
Sack ole problems solved.
And I dare any United player to dispute that.  I know I wouldn't 😂😂😂😂
Tyson needs to punch some sense into these players 😂
He is just a tall Sean Dyche
That's a threat. Lol
Sack Ole! We need someone with authority/ father figure to slap them when they lose. They're prima donas except for CR7 who keeps on saving us last minute. Bring real players that love MAN U similar to the likes of the 1999 team!
"be prepared"
Banterclub
Stick the entire sqaud in a cage along with Solskjaer and let Tyson loose to knock some sense into them.
Oles at the wheel Tyson...
Your a great winner Tyson proved it time after time 🙏🏼🥇🥇🥇
And all you flip floppin Ole outers - he didn't call out Ole - for a basic reason - it's beyond Ole, like Mourinho, LVG and Moyes, to put it right - you can only do so much as a manager - the rest is up to the players!
It's not about the result, it's how you lose.
This could actually help. At least I am certain it wouldnt do any more damage. And he is 100% correct. You have to believe in yourself, and dig deep if you want to win. The way our players have been the last couple of games proves that they dont have the heart in it, (or alternatively that they are much worse footballers than we thought.)   -Give me 100 percent. You can't make up for a poor effort today by giving 110 percent tomorrow. You don't have 110 percent. You only have 100 percent, and that's what I want from you right now. - John Wooden - Persistence can change failure into extraordinary achievement. - Matt Biondi - If you don’t have confidence, you’ll always find a way not to win. - Carl Lewis
He can't even beat Brock Lesnar in a WWE ring. LOL!!!
He needs to talk to Big head no brain  Maguire, own goals Jones,  Swedish melted white choc lindelof multi coloured hair Peacock Pogba , no skills Brazilian Fred , skinny woods , social media and wanna be rap star Lingard
Fury to buy the club 💰💰
if our players had half of his spirit we would be top of the league !
hahaha be prepared manager tyson is coming for you
Be prepared 😂😂😂😂 finally someone is going to march in there and express how we feel.
Lol .. this is what man utd has become..a content machine, not a football club. Absolutely embarrassing. The club is run for clicks and content.
They all need a good slap. Get them doing a bit of sparring fury lad. Toughen them up a bit.
Go n kick their fuckin arses Tyson me son
Yes and boxings an individual sport. Some of the players care and others don't. The ones that don't need to go
Lets not rock the boat, United are doing Excellent and Ole should be given a life contract
Make sure the cameras 🎥 are turned on and running  Get the Bolt from Jamaica just in case someone tries a runner 🏃‍♂️  No pay for view crap 💩
Replace Carrick with Tyson and job's a good un.
Tyson fury - the team is not motivated enough Ole - what? Joe Rogan - ooooooh he's hurt!
I think man utd are doing brilliant 👏 👌. COME ON CITY HAHAHA
True but ??? Bro Ole?
Wouldn't matter if you had 10 world class managers at that team the players are just not good enough and just simply lazy A LOT OF THESE PLAYERS ARE MASSIVELY OVERATED maguire too many mistakes wan bissaka no defensive awareness fred can't pass pogba is a child Bruno losses possession more than any midfielder i know greenwood is too greedy rashford control is atrocious de gea simply can't smell danger and never leaves his line which causes massive problems when your covering defender is maguire who is so slow these players think they have all made it but the Premier league will find a player out and these players are being found out every single player bar scotty m and fred are LAZY
Great boxer but tyson you support some shite 🤣🤣
Oh great 😂 just what they need now 😆
The entire team is a joke, Not one of them look like they wanna be there, and blame the manager but he can only do so much.
Well said, Tyson!!
Imagine tyson fury giving ronaldo a quick 1-2 to the jaw
Ole at the wheel.......weeeeeeee🤣
The Champ has spoken.
That's true the team is not properly coached this team need a hard manager! A manager that is not afraid to bench certain players that are not playing well united need that right now!
Mate, if anyone thinks that the players are the problem at Utd, no one can help you. If you have the quality of players that we have at Utd, including the world's greatest footballer of all time (arguably) and you can't even win convincingly, or let alone look like a team with a plan, then we have to look at the manager AND HIS COACHES to say they're not good enough. Not as people, but rather as managerial staff of Manchester United, one of the biggest teams in the world.
Please start with Ole and his triplets Maguire,  Shaw and Wan bissaka
As a Liverpool fan, i say United should get ther **** together, Chelsea is coming.
Tyson is right so many moments that this United team have fell short and not displayed a winners mentality: Lost to Istanbul, kicked out of CL last season, lost Europa SF, Lost Europa Final, Lost FA Cup SF twice, losing to Sheffield, the list goes on. How Ole is still in this job is criminal
Imagine Tyson on the sidelines barking 🤬 orders to the United player’s……..RUN YOU DOSSER’S😂😂😂
What position do you think he would play
Oles reply " Don't tell us how to play footbally and we won't tell you how to box " 🤣🤣🤣🤣  Seriously get this guy in the changing rooms! He'd honestly conmand more respect than Ole has currently. Hope the fans start chanting his name at the next game, absolute legend 👊
Did he say Patrice Evra?!? OMG "I love this gaaaame" lol
Naaa, don't botherya self mate. Well maybe after we play them both legs then you can let them have it. We need to top 4 badly
Tyson the 🐐
Tyson and Patrice with there hands in air with 20odd …… laid out I’d pay double entrance fee to see that lol
3 years behind liverpool
So you think it's just the players fault and we're ok still being led by Ole and his coaching mates??
Yes yes let’s go
He is completely correct
You tell them tyson
Lol
What the f*ck has it got to do with you though. Do you see Ronaldo giving you advice on boxing. Different sport, you're opinion means nothing. Even in you're own sport lmao.
too many 'stars' that believe their own hype that dont want to dig deep or don't have it in them anymore when its needed - they need to realise they are now the underdogs in big matches and they have to have that underdog spirit to beat the good teams , like West Ham are doing
We need this man as our new CDM and captain 🥊
How do the coaches and the manager and especially the board get away with this?
The clue is that nobody told that players that winning is a decisive part of their duties, because the money continue all the same  to flow in direction of the team owners, despite their results on the field....
The manager is crap, not the players.
You don't need to send any warning to Cristiano Ronaldo. He's much more inspiring and driven than this Tyson Fury. even without a strong team and a top manager he is already performing many miracles, particularly in the champions. Cavani is also very driven. Together they are the A team in a C (crap) team.
The problem is the coach
They got dicked 2 -0 Ty 🤣💙
Love how he has an actual throne for interviews, what a legend
Difference is Manchester United have to play the fixture, its not as easy as vacating a title and ducking David Price is it.
4674IQ  "i never wanted to loose a point boxing, and i never believed id loose a single point... but i lost points".. Fury with brain damge.
Totally agree Tyson.. players not interested. strolling through a game.. not closing the cross ball fast enough not getting tight enough on the opponent....no fight
Bring tyson to kick asses of some united players like pogba,shaw,maguire,greenwood,fred,mctominay,lindel......, so that they come to their senses
Get Ole out of the club right now!
respect
i dont think even Fury can motivate Poggers
Look at Oly for that.
Yeah they are definitely going to stop looking in the mirror and doing their hair and concentrating on what there paid for.🤣😂👏👏👏NOT!!!
Ole doesn’t even know how football works these days. If you ever want the best for your team, get someone who can pass and hold the ball in the middle of the park. I can’t stand looking at Fred’s performance this season. The guy loses the ball before the opposition player touches him. Absolute disgrace to the club of this scale.
Fury the next united manager
There really trying everything these days
Except for CR7 he puts in the hard yards at all times. He hasn't rubbed off on the others some words from Tyson Fury might I hope that inspires results it'd work for me thats for sure.
He has a point.🤔
What his saying is what real united fans  been saying😴 just he has a platform!!! We have noooo fight!!!!!! Ole smiles it really offends me
this guy could get a huge protest going
he should be saying this about the glazers
Them players deserve a better Manager. Accept for Mcfred they can go with him, terrible midfielders
Only bruno and ronaldo have a winners mentality Harry the fridge maguire and Fred useless rodriguez need to be punch hard by fury especially Harry
Roy Keane and Tyson Fury, imagine them in charge, would be unreal
Ole the one should be called out
such a gyspy a united fan
FURY GOT ROBBED 🤭🤭 he is BACK 🔥🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪
Manchester who?
Football is not one man show fury, just concentrate on your boxing
This is not a one man game like boxing, it’s a team….most of the players are fed up with Ole and his tactics and want something new….they are been forced against there will
Ole is going to get smashed the big dosser 😂😂
One line each for some of the United players and staff. Greenwood: Do your defensive work  as well as your attacking. Rashford: Focus on your game not just feeding 'starving kids'. Bruno: Stop complaining about everything and trying to nutmeg the opposition at every turn and twist. Fred: Bulk up mate! McTominay: Ask for a stronger partner or better yet, ask to play as a single pivot CDM. Shaw: Stop eating fatboy. Wan-Bissaka: Don't make practically every 1v1 a sliding tackle. Lindelof: Get your back fixed. Maguire: Go home HMS Harry Maguire you're too slow.  De Gea: Slap the players that make mistakes leading to goals. Varane: Help DDG enforce that 👆. Bailly: Yours should be one of the first names on the teamsheet. Jones: Yours too (Kidding). Lingaard: Get off of social media! Van de Beek & Sancho: Your time will come. Matic: Knee Fred in the goolies. Telles: Stay lean. Dalot: You should've stayed in Milan as we don't deserve you. Pogba: Sign the damn contract and never make a sliding tackle again. Carrick: Passing stats are down. Phelan: Please borrow Sir Alex's hairdryer and his ⚽⚽.  Ronaldo & Cavani: Please don't leave! 🙏 Solskjaer: Please ask Tyson to bring Roy along with him to the training ground.
Even fury can’t polish a turd up the CITY
Like Roy keans brother 😂
Lmaooooooooooo
Tyson Fury is real GOAT
He sounded more motivating and Passionate than all United players and Manager. They're a disgrace!!
Tyson fury for asistant coach
Ronaldo already said that Ole is the one who was the one to blame. He started the game with coward tactic and mentality and thats why players played like that. They were playing the way they are not used to and they havent being coached and trained well. United now is Shambolic FC. Look at West Ham yesterday vs Liverpool, amazing.
As Liverpool fan he's right, hope he goes to Liverpool training as well.
You dont wanna throwing punches mr tyson. Surely you dont wanna damage maguire brain even more do ya? From whatever he got left inside that massive casing of a head of his
I thought he was a Blue 😆
This should be directed at the manager, there are winners in that team. Ronaldo is one of the greatest ever winners in sports history. They could dig as deep as they like, the manager is clueless that's the issue, not the players
No matter what fury or evra say to them ..they will continue to get smashed all season and west ham winning yesterday will push utd Futher down the table where they belong....C.T.I.D.1977../5000
😂desperate !!
how u have winning mentality if you doesn't have core and strategy to do it? you think cr7 doesn't have winning mentality? not just player, but everyone including manager, coach, board my big foot friend!
This guys gonna be milking the Wilder Fights forever.
Few wks u mean a few year
His talking to the fullbacks!!!! See what u have started if ya only just defended properly now he gonna gonna go to old Trafford while you lot gonna have to prepare on how u gonna defend for your freking lives from this guy!!!! Ya fuckd up!!
Isn’t he the genius man!
Make Fury the new Manchester United manager! 👊🏻
Don't mess with Tyson Fury! 👊🏻
Ole's at the wheel, tell me how good does it feel ??
God loves you,give your life to jesus christ today 🙏.
Uniteds problems started when they sacked David Moyes. Was he really incapable of rebuilding that team?
Replace our man manager with Fury?
He is right! United players never play as a team or have the drive to fight for a win!!! Greenwood wants to prove he is better than Ronaldo. I say bench Greenwood and bring on Rashford and Cavani to play with Ronaldo. Bench Fred and bring on Donny, same for Baily and bring on Matic. Occasionally put Henderson instead of DeGea beside the top 4 contenders.
I played in a team called Stattena IF in Sweden's division 6 once upon a time. I can not even explain how bad that division is. Sometimes only 9 of my teammates showed up on matchday. Sometimes the referee had to pause the match as some were hungover and needed to throw up. I am 100% sure that I and my former teammates in Stattena IF would have performed better against City and Liverpool. We were completely useless, but we did not lack passion. Vamos Stattena IF!
Any excuse to meet ronaldo 😂
Wow! The players are now been thrown under the bus instead of their clueless manager
Harry maguire and luke shaw have requested their contract termination after this video.
Another alex Ferguson move, he is still in charge, after Liverpool defeat, he went to the ground himself and convinced ronaldo to back ole, now he’s sending this guy
It's the Manager,his assistants and Board at fault... just see how Klopp the normal guy brings passion in the squad before tactical...turn into the most beloved person they got in Anfield
Crap themselves and run.
Lmao shame how a professional boxer knows more about winning mentality than our manager and the players
Ole : No need evra, we have fred
Patrice evra? You need to go down with Roy Keane mate. Give them some hard and tough words.
Ole out
Unfortunately united are like an Anthony Joshua
Get on the training ground and choke ole out so he can get the right mind set, he keeping young talents on the bench and playing crap players.
Spoken like a true Red. Man Utd has to fix up or else everybody has to get sacked from top to bottom including the players.
Lol him and Patrice Evra
The peoples champion.
he should start with mcfred and then mctominay and then maguire
you cant find a better manager than Ole, a family man through and through still able to sign autographs and smile for the fans even when losing 2-0 at home to their local rivals, what a guy!
Man Urinals wouldn´t win a pissing contest at the moment.
OGS is not giving Tyson Fury analogy for the rest of his managerial career now..🤣 Had Michael Jordan watched that Manchester Derby, he would've also made a video calling out OGS for comparing him with Pheewwwwsss..
I think you need to shut up. It's easy to talk but if you think your a better man why aren't you coaching Man United.
We must start winning again.
Need to give Ole a knockout
The coach is the problem
ole out tyson furry in lol.
they need Fury as a coach
Tyson fury for Manchester United manager
Your Wasting your time Tyson 😂🤣
That's going to go down like a lead balloon with the coaching staff,but it's obviously what they need
What will he do will he coach United keep your mouth shut let the president fans decide. U play boxing , football is team work it's different. Lol don't step in other business.
Pogba dab to that
U tell em lad they faking need a bit off that
Lol
Good on him but to mention evra haha 😂 the man's a joke
this man is 33...
Yeess tyson yeaassssss 🤜🤜🤜
he can start with ole gunnar solskjaer and his coaches
Love fury what a ledge the glazers won't let him got to united training ground anymore now they'll be like 'Oh no he said something bad about our club we was criticised no he can't come anywhere near here ban him immediately ' absolutely hate the people who run PR and who ultimately own this club its literally got to the point I don't even wanna follow the club anymore because it's just like they mug of the fans left right and centre for our money getting to the point where I'd rather support Watford or Crystal Palace or something least their owners try do okay with what they've got and not everything is about money like even Brentford try be decent and actually have a style of football I know united are above some of these teams but for what manchester united is globally and how big it is and how much money it has at its disposal to invest it has literally become BANTER FC
might be worth putting a bet down for 8 nil Man U v Watford!
I wouldn't mind the gypsy king being gaffer for a day at carrington tbh...keano can tag along and all 😁 GGMU.
OLE OUT, TYSON IN
Yeah, tell that to Ole, because if compared to other managers, he just sits his ass and do nothing to instruct his players
Boxing has a lot teach us in our daily lives and work. Thank you Tyson Fury. Greetings to you all the way from Uganda. Great sports men like you with words of wisdom inspire our world so much. Blessed to have you in our time
if anyone needs the hard word its ole because there is no way on this planet that u can have the players that we have & still be nowhere near challenging for any domestic trophy let alone a premier league title & thats all down to ole!
Sesn Dyche is that you?
Imagine asking Fred to give more, when he’s already operating at 110% and is still sub-par 😂
When fred goes to bed ,he firsts checks his locker for Tyson fury🤣🤣🤣
i hope Tyson will have his last fight in Old Trafford one day,  bring the fighting mentality to where it belongs.
this is exactly what i want to see!!!!!!!!!!!!  bring tyson to the dressing room and show them what the real man is !!!!!!!!! come one Tyson
I’m a Liverpool fan but love Tyson Fury and he’s right but at the same time hope it falls on deaf ears
Go on big man it's needed
Hes very right..... They just don't care, the movements the tracking back, the finding space the persistence. Its like every other player is persistent then the rest are thinking about waffles at home. Its not even the manager its mentality
Ronaldo  Is only 1 with that mentality , shawberto carlos my Mates call shaw and he is poo maguire 80 mil and he’s captain wow , ronaldo should be captain player manger coz he would do better than ole, united are a team without a identity and they need to sort it fast
FURY sitting on his THRONE...... And i am not talking about the Toilet
Next time United lose, they should get a round each in the ring with Fury! That'll bring out the winning mentality in them especially Ole and maguire!
One person who the world cant tag with condescending words.
Tyson should knock them all out that’ll teach them a lesson
Send in Tyson and Roy Keane
Problem is management 😪
But you need to be winning in the first place to get that mentality
When big TF speaks, you listen. If you don't, good luck.
Hahah horrible mancs in the mud
Utd supporter all my life, no direction no drive, the money each player is on is unreal and they just don't care about the fans that turn up week in week out, something has to be done asap
Central City East
got to love his chair
It’s a good hiding there needing 👊👊👊👊
The players are paid too much. They just don't care because they get paid anyway. They should get paid by how they perform. Most of them seem like they are taking sunday night run just chilling.
Yeah but eerrr it’s me ole at da wheel
Word.
Love it…..Love him. Only one Tyson Fury
Very timed defence of ole n his terrible tactics 🙄
Well Said And So True,,,,
Under the umbrella of "Mistakes" If Referees carry Corruption Not for monetary gains,just to keep their lucrative jobs How can it be identified?😂
Tyson 'You dosser',  reporter ''who me?' Tyson '' No the whole Manure squad''
City dominate at Home of all Top4 Rivals Only 1 reason they arent Top of Table Referee "Mistakes" Match Fixing - vanished,exists?😂
They have no heart and they're overpaid.
It's good to see & hear the X players Roy Keane, Paul Scholes & Owen Hargreaves etc.. expressing their views & concerns on what United needs to do to get it right to succeed but why aren't they involved in Ole's Project cos he needs them right Now!
When You listen to Graeme Souness to us he says it all. He knows about the bitter rivals out there and they do not want Man Utd to succeed. He's fully aware that things have compounded onto Ole knowing that Ole needs to improve his cause but he feel that more should be done by Man Utd to protect Ole & the progression. The Management team must improve so Roy & Others needs to see Ole ASAP!
So Cringey
Love this
100 percent agree with this
Ole out, Tyson in
Accurate
The English media will do anything to protect below average English players  SMH
Atleast Tyson fury will be a rock in defense than Maguire.
Give them a good walloping. By the next game, they all would be out due to injuries.
tyson will knock them all out...
It’s clearly the manager 😴
Great words from Fury but can't get passed thinking how funny him and Evra would look next to each other
Dear Tyson , stop blaming the players , it's on the coaching .
Fury speak the truth about Manchester United no winning mentality  and lost at home to they two rivals.
That is how bad United is at the moment
Someone’s gotta do it right
No mention of Ole and the coaching staff??🤣🤣🤣
Tyson fury as manager
Hahahah
appoint tyson as a coach.... these players deserve this ...absolute nonsense football
Fury, with all due respect, stick to boxing
Ole is on the wheel don't worry champ.
First of all Man Utd players should learn how to paas the ball. So poor attitude.
They all tried hard they just don’t have any tactics to perform! It is easy for non-players to say they aren’t trying.
Give the snow flakes hundreds of thousands of pounds a week. Human nature to get content with their lot. Comes down to managing the players properly and getting them out the bubble. Jim McLean all Dundee Utd style.
Sign up Gerrard while you have the chance...he is talented, good at comebacks, was a great players, will sell merchandise , is British AND is from Liverpool, like the greatest Man United manager, Sir Matt Busby.
Barnardo silva > Tyson Fury
Fred is running for the hills right now
Fear has a voice
I think fury would do a better job than ole 😂😂😂😂.
Yes Tyson
I love this guy🔥
Hopefully he sparks Ole Out
Tyson spits some truth. I'm a chelsea fan but rn man utd players doesn't have that winning mentality. That's what they're lack of or maybe because of their coach
Legend 👍
I’m not playing for Man United and even I’m scared
Well said, they appeared  mentally defeated. Unable to pass the ball. Susceptible to pursue which invites more pressure. This has been going on for awhile.
The one he needs to slap is the management to appoint the right manager.   Pocchettino etc
Bring ZIDANE!!!
If that approach actually worked, Roy Keane would have managed Sunderland to their fifth Champions League trophy by now.
Breaking news. Tyson fury KOs every member of staff.board memeber . Player an coaching staff in visit .
Play this guy as center back,he would do better than the fridge
Tyson  if ya want to do them a favour tell them to sack ole.
Pogba be in the corner crying!!!
I'D PAY TO SEE TYSON USING BRUNO AND FRED AS GLOVE PUPPETS 1 ON EACH HAND MAKE THEM BOX EACH OTHER FEK ME I'M PISSING MYSELF JUST PICTURING THAT AND OLE COULD HOLD UP THE CARDS AFTER EVERY RND LIKE RND 1 AND HE DOES A LAP OF OLD TRAFFORD PAY PER VIEW GET IT ON LOL 😜⚽🥅
I love this man
Cr7🏆🏆
It's ole that he should be warning!
Spot on! Tel em some home  truths. Send Keane too..
Remove Ronaldo and start using Sancho. This is the only solution . Ronaldo needs good clear chances whereas Sancho is different.
go on tyson
"if you blokes don't start to win games, you're gonna get knocked out"
The problem is Ole's headless chicken tactics, his clueless self declared world class coaching staffs and Fred.Don't blame the others, mate.
Ole Gunner is the one that needs a slap. 🥊
👏👏👏
Tyson fury believe in himself to win but he also has a good coaching crew, he can't just win for being a good boxer and same goes to united  the players are world class and that is why they need a world class coach or intelligent young man with passion to bring out the united spirit in them, even in ferguson days he still stand up to add spice to the team on the touch line, but ole want to be big when he's not even there at all just because he has many of his colleagues in the media manipulating people's mind, forgetting that people are dying silently in their minds as their lives are attached to united success
This guy has sounded more inspiring in one minute than OGS has in his entire time as the actual manager!!!
Tyson in!
He's so right tbh  think of the Man U players, how many this season have proved to have that winners mentality?  Ronaldo, no surprises tho, then *maybe* Bruno, and some could argue Pogba on his day, tho for Man U I don't see it, he has it for France, but Man U....ehhh  the only other one I can think of is Varane.........whose injured  this is a big problem for Man U, one I think comes back to the manager, a good manager can instill that mentality, look at City with Pep, Liverpool with Klopp, heck even West Ham with Moyes, something needs to change at Man U, and at this point it can only be OGS, I'm not a Man U fan and even I can see that
Sky sports love Utd loosing 😂
From one fake boxer to another fake football club.....I can see the connection now😂😂😂😂😂😂
Ole out
He is 100% right but you can see it for a long time now that professional football has changed. Players are less motivated now than they were years ago they dont have the passion anymore and thats down to money, greed and clubs sacking managers left right and centre because they lost the last three games. Also the bad side of social media is another huge problem but we wont get in to that. Edit: 2 minutes after posting this i see that Dean Smith has been sacked by Aston Villa. Talk about proving my point
I feel like its not they dont wanna win. Its just that I feel they wanna win just using their talents. Just doing what theyre good at n let the game take them. U gotta put in the hardwork in the game not only in practice. U gotta be exhausted after each game, especially when ure down 0-5 or 0-2 vs big clubs. I still believe ManU has more talents than Liverpool this year. Bland is what I can say up until now.
Unfair critics really. Man Utd have repeatidly gone a goal down and fought to the end this season.
Vera gon' slap the punched faces like NBA rebounds 💯❄🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇫🇷
He has same mentality as Ronaldo. They both always think that theyre the best. Im sure Ronaldo teaches other players about this mindset, but too bad he doesnt smack those sloths. Maybe Fury will? 😂
Why should they give their all? Some days we can't be bothered with work, and it's the same with footballers. Particularly when they have no mortgage/rent payments overdue.. Loyalty to the club (players and managers) and giving 100% tends to drop off when houses, cars, clothes are bought for you, and you've more money than you need. It's an old cliché, but it stands true. It's different for Tyson, he HAS to win, and he has to be switched on or he could get seriously hurt. A footballer might receive a bad review or earn a rant from a pundit who likes to be heard, but then it's home and feet up til his next 90 minutes 'work'.
Ole out  🐰 🧸  Keane  and Fury in …..🥊🔥🔥🔥🔥
Spot on ! We got a non footballer in Harry fuckin McDonalds AND ON TOP OF THAT THE ARM BAND !??! LMAOOOOO, simulation world
He could probably get more out of this team than ole if he had a football coach alongside him like the players would be too scared to come back to dressing room if they weren’t trying
Not even Tyson can put Fury into these players... 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Ole out
Let's go Brandon!
That’s what every fan is shouting. Fking PLAY PROPERLY, PASS PROPERLY, DEFEND PROPERLY, CLEAR THE BALL QUICKLY, MARK THAT GUY… SHOOT! SHOOT! FKING SHOOT DAMN IT! These players seriously need some hair dryer treatment
🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🔥 Olé out, Pogba out, Miguire out,shaw out, bissaka out, mctominay out,
Sign him up in January, stick him in the midfield  👊🏼
Get down to carrington and show that rabble what a fighting spirit is
What about the coaches not picking a trash team with a trash formation and trash system? Park the bus at home vs a team that thrives on possession👍
And tell OGS to resign whilst you're there.
Guess the manager who smiles after a loss and is very serious or frowns after a win
This other Italian fella who's not so popular with the United Board: "I prefer to kill him"
if they only had his and Keanes mentality
There hasn’t been any sort of fight that Utd fans of the old would be used to since fergie retired. Only a few players come to mind, Herrera at the helm of them. When was any post fergie Liverpool or city game as filled with fight as it was under fergie? I can maybe think of 2 or 3. Footballs changed a lot and with that a lot of the rivalry has quietened.
its the manager and coaches not the players
Come on...PR spin!! Ole has to go period
He ain't wrong tho. Utd do need to fight abit more.
This needed to be said
Well done for not blaming the manager. All apart from Ronaldo and Wan Bissaka need a wake up call.
Sadly that doesn't work with the modern footballer, if it did then Roy Keane would be managing Man United right now...
Nice one TYSON for this they need you to go down there a tell them they will be in a ring with you if don't take any notice and I have been behind Ole but don't think he can take us any further
Got to love fury. What you see is what you get a lion. He will die with honor. Gypsy or not. He is a man of honour and faith.
MAN UTD beaten before a ball was kicked. City walked out first as though they owed Old Trafford UTD followed like lambs to the slaughter.
United team! You Big bum dossers 😂 How good would that be lol
They’re not playing as a team and focusing on themselves each and every player on the squad. No synergy at all and I think deep down each player dislikes playing with certain members of the squad. It was all over Bruno’s face in the post match interview it’s like they want Ole to get the sack. He is part of the problem playing players that don’t perform well but he can’t make a winning team without winners mentality like fury said. Ronaldo has dragged crucial points out of a lacklustre squad which shows just how important he’s been since his signing. People will say he’s overrated and such but he’s not, he’s there to score goals but can’t if Man Utd don’t get the ball out of their half and actually create chance for him. Give the Captains armband to ronaldo as maguire isn’t putting enough fear into his team about it’s my way or the highway. The players forget that if a new manager comes along their jobs are also at risk with being in the Man Utd team. Any other coach coming in could instantly drop a few individuals and leave them on the bench. Like Roy Keane would say playing in the Man Utd team you should be proud and sweating and unable to talk in interviews after a game knowing you’ve gave it your all but don’t see that at the moment
D manager and captain ain’t winners though so u better give them some of that too
I would not mind Fury as a manager than Ole
Gypsy king: Man utd, I'm coming, to sort you lot out.  Ronaldo: Ey, Real Madrid, Will you be willing to take me back for half price? Just checking.  😂
It’s needed to be honest
Even Ole is the problem on that team. This team is not only for England people. We pay our money to watch foolish game like this? No you Ole and you harry muguire get out thru window please we are oready locked the door
How stupid are united fans? He spent over 400 million and they say we can’t compete with city so why did he buy these players? Three years and united fan still don’t get it, he’ll never be good enough for. How many more embarrassing games do you guys want with this guy?
Be prepared because some heavy fury blows from Tyson might just be falling on you guys soon 🤣🤣🤣🤣👍
Harry Maguire we tired of you. U don't deserve to be even captain
Am tired of that coach we are paying our money to watch foolish game like this man united
👏👏👏 Please do it soon! 🧐
Utd fans won't like this because if you start calling players out which is your main problem, it goes against oleout agendas they're being drilled with from all the youtubers looking for content
He summed that up perfectly .
My respect for fury 📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈📈
Ole out Fury in !
Mediocrity is accepted here right now. No consequences, bad performances are brushed off. Players dont even need to fear getting benched for poor performance.
Maguire - you're getting it you dosseeeerrrr!! 😂
True true true
Man Utd... back to the Ron Atkinson years of finishing 6th.  If only there was a way of motivating these little prima-donnas like making them watch a documentary about the Busby-Babes or something.
Tyson Fury sends a warning to f****** Manchester united players
That's motivation right there you muncs!  From a Liverpool fan...
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
They have nothing to play for with this manager.
he aint wrong
He needs to send a warning to the glazers and Ed Woodward to GTF OUT ALREADY!!!!!
If players ain't digging deep its because the manager has lost the team, they've lost faith in him
Do  them a weeks wages The get paid win or lose The are overpaid
Pathetic, a classic case of very low intellect. As for behaviour, he is a clear example of no mental condition just simply bad behaviour, which creates his justification.  By example he places professional  boxing in the gutter outside of any professional sport. No doubt in his mind he knows  exactly how to survive and work in space or  work at NASA as well. Of course a heavy weight Boxing Champion automatically qualifies!!!!.
The Gypsy King & Patrice Evra coming to the training ground to get them boys whipped and into shape. I wish Wilder the Bronx bomber could come too. That would be one hell of a beat down on all Manchester United players 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🤣🤣
Man U are a long way from getting up in the 12th round. They would have tripped up on the stairs on the way into the ring and banged their lip on the bell.
one man with a winners mentality...the rest....
Lol his house have that gypsy stile vibe with gold chair and curtains. Love him
In future, sign players and manager with a clause that if they underperform they ain't getting paycheck and see how they dance.
this guy is not even an athlete
Get ready to run when he gets to training ground.
GK 👑
Fury is speaking facts!
Ffs Ole needs SAF and Tyson Fury to be at the training ground to rally his players together, this is just embarrassing man. Ole has lost all credibility as a manager and should leave before his reputation as a player gets caught in the crossfires as well.
Thank you Tyson, makes me feel better hearing that from you.
this what we need....send Fury down to the dressing room
Don’t leave Roy keane 😂
Respect this man..united players doesnt have winning mentality
Tyson Fury should be our next manager!
agree with what he says but theres a big difference between a sport where you alone have your destiny in your own hands! where football is many individuals who have to be on the same level to reach that goal so to speak, and only takes one or two to fall below par and it all goes pear shaped. ultimately has to be the manager who takes the flak
Thank you.
They arent playing for the manager because the managers tactics are crap, these results have nothing to do with the players and everything to do with the coach
True tho, only player with a winning mentality is Cristiano
Tyson Fury vs Harry Maguire.. One on One at Carrington on Monday night..
Tyson v slab head MSG 20th December 2021 book tickets now
What a nice homophobe
wELL its a different case when fans who are not in the sports field complain but now gypsy king himself has said it , then they gotta do some introspection, you got the players and everything, where the results are.
Like of you want Tyson Fury to manage Manchester United 😅
Tysoe fury calls out fred
Stick to boxing , football is not your sport if you can call boxing a sport , prisons are full of boxer's punching someone outside the boxing ring is a crime but in the ring it's deemed ok to maybe kill someone or do permanent damage to them
It's really come to something when the heavyweight champion has to basically threaten the staff!
Take Roy Keane! Mr Evra & fury
Clueless head...with that clueless Ole this players can't do a thing...they need someone like Zidane who has a style of play..he builds players..have connections with ronaldo..he can really build that team...u need a winner top winner..no better option at the moment other than him..remember his cv..
Was begging him to call them dossers
Tyson mate it's becuase of the bloody manager
breaking news tydon fury sign for 3 years contract as coaching man united.
That sums it. This message goes to Ole too. They only did damage limitation but didn't put enough fight.
Still get paid to lose.
Tyson Fury to replace solskjaer? 🤣🤣
TELL THEM TYSON! THEY SHOULD BE DAMN PREPARED OF WHAT TO COME AND THE NEXT GAME AND THE GAME AFTER WILL BE HARDER THAN THIS IF THEY DONT HAVE THIS "WINNER MENTALITY" CAN U GUESS WHERE WILL MAN U END UP?
Make him the manager and problems are solved. He smash every one who doesn't give 💯 on the pitch. These players have gone complacent nothing else, need a kick on their rare side.
Has it become that embarrassing hahaha... buying cristiano was a terrible sporting decision in terms of developing a competitive team for years to come..he hinders the growth of the team snd progressively makes them worse like at juventus.. he was brought in for jerseys nothing else
Tag keane along bro. Eat em alive!!!! Cook em!!! Whatever just bring united back to glory!!!!
It’s shameful that other people are calling players out and there is our manager all smiley jokey on the touch line about achieving the next level on his candy crush game on the tablet. Ole life isn’t all about a happy go lucky and “fine margins”. It requires people to ride tough times and man up. None of these pathetic Instagram “we go again” posts cut it anymore.   The players just aren’t threatened enough to care. That’s why they didnt want Conte as he would (a) challenge and push the players and (b) would challenge the board. Neither would be wanted as both the players and board are weak to their cores
If I was fury the First person I’d be neck slapping is fred
This ain't a one vs one show, it's 11 v 11. The players follow a set of tactics just as you followed yours. It's obvious the system is wrong and a big name like Tyson Fury should be calling out the problem and not the players. They can fight all they want but Ole isn't good enough to win us a trophy plain and simple. I've never watched a game under Ole and said this is our style of play. All the narrow games we've won under Ole are due to special moments from our players, not us breaking down the opposition defence.  If we're a club with mid table ambitions  like West Ham then we've performed above par so far. But last time I check the biggest clubs in the world demand the best with the exception of Manchester United, when did top 4 become a target. Not winning the league should be considered failure but qualifying for Champions League is considered our greatest success Post Sir Alex Ferguson era.  If the biggest voices are tongue tied then the truth will not be heard.  Hitler rose even Germany had the best scientists in the world at that time and were arguable the best country in the world but because the good men and women said nothing and did nothing thereby allowing chaos to rise.  If Scholes, Ferdinand, and all others refuse to speak the truth then they're responsible for the future of what Manchester United will become if this farce is allowed to continue
Why is this plonker spiv presenting on Sky Sports News now
Take it from the Champ, he is not wrong, however that attitude must come from the manager also.
Bless him. Surely he knows that you still need a good boxing coach in order to be a good boxer, no matter how good the ‘mentality’ of the boxer. Yet another person who just can’t see how bad the manager and coaching staff of United are.
You may argue that a player should always have the winning mentality regardless of who their manager is, but if they don't believe in the manager, it's obviously a lot less likely they'll dig deep and put their body on the line.
Fury on the wheel
The defense is Swiss Cheese giving up goals from start to finish.  Defensive managers were run out of town for having too conservative an approach or too rigid.  Now that the squad is top heavy with talent the results are also unacceptable.  A pragmatic manager would balance the squad by removing 2 key players who are currently a detriment: Maguire who is grossly overrated, and Fred who just can’t fill the need.  I love Ole (legend) but he may be too pleasant and polite.
Maguire starts to get nervous
Start by beating T F out of the glazers then woodward and the coaching staff !!
Elijah wood could do a better job than ole.
Pay what the deserve. If they are homeless or in dire need of money have them sign special agreements. Stop paying them ridiculous amounts to run like sheeps up and down the field. Manager is to blame too but the players don't give a frick at this point. They get paid anyways so they just there for attendance like this is some high school or something.
Sorry big man...you’re wrong....Elite psychology comes from the manager Players are shot to bits don’t know who they are..Elite managers TELL PLAYERS who they are
As refs were finally called out  by media for being blatantly biased towards man utd  ,suddenly  utd look bang average without penalties...if only they did this when premier league started ...maybe the media should also highlight the 560m debt and the 250m wages
You need to give it to Ole
Love this dude.
This guy talks rubbish no one can change utd..get over it you mancs 😉
If I were Harry Maguire I'd be fleeing the country
Believe me Tyson go to the dressing room and knockout ole,Maguire and mcfred otherwise de gea might do it one of these days
I don't remember a time when Utd had so many low quality players. Plus they've never had a worse manager that's for sure, it's unbelievable.
Well done Tyson Fury for what you. Said about, Manchester United players with no mentally, no fighting heart whatsoever. Which i totally agree with what he's. Saying, ❤️😭
Love Tyson as a boxer,but when it comes to football his opinion is as equal as anybody else's.
Lfc to win the league. my views of Tyson has now dropped finding out you are a scumbag supporter.
Fury to be appointed as next United manager.
He’s too late he should have done ✔️ t before Liverpool vs Man U cuz he should support Liverpool
someone lock fred and fury in one room i want to see something
If ole stays at the wheel any longer where gonna be written off in a bad crash 😂😂
Ole needs to be sacked to save Utd
They just don't wana play for Ole
Sack ole and get him, atleast the players will be scared for their lives to lose under him. And other than that there won't be a bigger difference between him and ole in managerial terms.
Tysom Fury for Man united manager!😂😂
I want see tyson fury vs Phil Jones 😅😅😅😂😂😂😂
He's not wrong. I mean ole is clearly failing but some of the players seem ill equipped to take responsibility for themselves on the pitch. Don't blame others. Don't be negative. Build a team atmosphere. It's not about blame its about responsibility.
they care only about them salaries. Well said Tyson 💪
This guy😂. I am so happy to be alive in the time as him.
Wilder is a terrible boxer technically, but he has a right hand that could smash anyone, plus he is a warrior with the heart and guts of a lion. Utd are gutless wonders btw.
Just imagine being man united one of the biggest clubs in world football and watching your team play like a Sunday league team few of them players look like they've had a few pints before they go on the pitch aswell all over the place.
Islam is the truth. Read the Qur'an
NOT ONE would last 1 min accept Ronaldo and Cavani and most wouldn't even get in the ring
They need to get off their knees and play football.
Without fergie, United are now just a mediocre, mid table club again, LIVERPOOL proved that last week… 5-0 👍🏼
Lol I’m a fury fan but come on man these are different days they probably would want a selfie with U to put it on the gram lol
He should be warning the management, especially since he needed new mangement himself before the last Wilder fight due to lack of inspiration, motivation.
Damn right, they don’t care and it’s fxcking disgusting. Get maguire out of the dressing room. He’s the worst captain ever by a miiiiiiile.
Make him manager
Thanks Tyson for giving fans your voice.
Pogba….   Speak to my agent…..
You are the man!
No Surprise Boxer Angry is a Manc.
They have a weak mind. too many silk sheets i watch them and i am suprised. Hard work wins. We beat the best team in football back in the day, they won everything, we believed we could win through hard work. Hrad work and grit and determination. we won 10 -9
These players are there for the good money only...thats the truth...we paying fans are the suckers...they party harder than they play...90% energy partying...10% left for playing.
Tyson is dead rite..  utd players need to play for there club
Manchester United after one goal down: “Ohhh sh!t here we go again”
Spot on Tyson... There is just no ❤️ in this team right now
Who taught you the tactics to fight well, which is the foundation of what you do?  Well I think you need to have a word with Ole and his coaching team.   Some of those players you are calling out have one major trophies with their respective national teams. Also, they have won major trophies for clubs they played for previously.   Manu has become a circus.
How good is that! Quake United!
Mate youre directing this at the wrong people, its the coach and all his staff you need to chase out the club.
Ole would just tell Fred to sort him. Job done.
Fury is the man no small talk straight to the point 👍🏻
Forget hairdryer treatment let Tyson do some flamethrower treatment on them they need it
Wan Bassaka, Maguire, Lindelof, Shaw, Fred and McTominay are simply not good enough yet the clown keep picking them to defend. Like they say if you’ve no tactics the safest option is to pick a defensive lineup and hope for a moment of brilliance.
I guess harry would have tweeted about how sorry he feels and went on to lazing around as asusual after this.
O.M.F.G. I just pissed myself laughing, I actually thought this was serious, then I realized...it's man utd, they're probably stupid enough to do something like this.🤣🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂
Tyson Fury can manage United better than Ole
Atleast someone that's recognized in the society can send such messages to help us out..
Tyson Fury is a Great Champion but the only problem is he supports the wrong club.
Ole out  Fury in 😂😂😂
Only CR7 has that mentality out of all the players i have seen in man united
Anyone who got to the level in sport where they are professionals knows that 90% of sport is mental you win or lose the games before you ever walk onto the field. When I worked in the game the manager was the motivator with me and the coaches dealt with the tactics. Olly should bring in new coaches if only to freshen it up.
F7ck em.all
This needs to happen, to save my club
Tyson could do a better job than Ole tbf
Nothing should change at utd. Keep the same players and manager. Love to watch them perform like this 😂
They will keep blaming the players but won't mention the clueless manager!!
There’s no Heart ❤️ As soon as Signed All They Think is to get Out and be Happy and free 🤣again
well said
Ole just needs more money and time. Probably a complete new starting 11.
Tyson should give Ole a call.
He's definitely calling for Maguire. Send that fridge in and save this club before it's too late
Rival fans want Olé to stay permanently that should say enough
Ole out
not really been into boxing that much over the years, but watched Tyson Fury v Wilder and boy, is he the epitome of determination, belief and sheer guts. Tyson is an inspiration to so many and 100% qualified to call out the Man Utd players (and staff) for lack of effort and fight.
Why blame players if you dont see winning mentality from the manager itself?!?
Throw ole in the ring with him without a referee present
Do we have a sports psychologist at the club?
Even Ronaldo can't save United 😂
They are there for the fkin money only, big time Charlie’s not enough British or Irish players anymore who actually give fk and can dish it out and give a fk about the Jersey . If this lot got paid by performance they would be fkin skint.
He’d do a better job than ole
starts with a new manager tyson pal
Manchester U is a team full of young, overrated and overpaid players who get paid so much that they feel entitled and comfortable and don't really care if they win or lose because most aren't Manchester juniors. It's no wonder they have no fighting spirit.
You should adress your threats at the coaching staff, not the players. That says a lot for your understanding of football. This is becoming ridiculous how Man Utd try to spin the stories from every angle, so they can hide their mistake in giving Ole a new deal. This is not a United fan, only a paid glazzer puppet.
The only bad thing about Fury Man Utd fan...
LEGEND
Big decisions need made and it’s the managers job to make them.  That’s what he’s paid to do.  Picking the same players week in week out who are constantly letting the team down he deserves every bit of stick he gets.  Grow a pair and take the armband off Maguire right away and drop him.  Get Shaw dropped as well.  Drop Fred start Donny.  Pogba got dropped for speaking out but he was spot on.  Changes blatantly needing made here.  Problem is I don’t think the manager has the backbone and the balls to make these tough decisions.  That’s why he will never be the right guy and will never turn things around.
The difference is Tyson, you're a champion, with a champion's mindset. It's very difficult to instil that in other people.
Got to love Tyson
Go on Tyson!!!!
Please smackdown Harry Maguire and Fred
Well it was against City. City will make any team look like they are not trying .
Probably better than OLE as manager
Fernandes is shaking loool
These players don't even have half of this man's balls put together 👍
Fury would be a better manager than Ole.
😜😜😜 blame the coach...1 win in 6 penaldo effect and we were told he carries a team 😜😜😜
ole's at the wheel...at the wheel...oles at the wheel 🎶🎶 na na...na na na na na 🎶🎶💪💪 am still laughing off our 5-0🤭🤭
Tyson should look at the manager n his coaches instead. Fish rots from the Head❗
Sit down, Tyson.  Which player would definitely give everything  under Ole's broken management?
They (except cr7 )don't have SO called"winners mentality "...
Tysoe vs Joshua at old Trafford in coming you wait and see if it doesn't  happen fills the Glazer's pockets and gives heavy weight  boxing sorry WWE boxing a chance to go to old Trafford there both a circus carry on.🤣🤣🤣
Exactly what they need  to smashed
😂😂wow
tyson in
Lmao trying so hard to stay relevant.
That's what happens when you hire a "nice guy" as a coach in a competitive sport. Can't blame the players for embodying the coach & club. They're just there to sell shirts & campaign. Everyone else goes to war.
Worst tackles made stats. Worst sprints per game. Among the worst for running stats. When Ole came in,he said, “I’m going make us the fittest,fastest team in the PL” That was 3yrs ago. I’ve always been an Ole man,but he simply has to go now. The city defeat was worse than the Liverpool one because we were completely and utterly dominated by a team who knew their jobs inside out = that’s coaching. Their running stats were ridiculous compared to ours = that’s coaching. Their intensity and hard work were way way above ours = that’s professional desire. We have gone backwards,at speed,and we now urgently need a proper coach,someone like Meulensteen or Ten Hag at Ajax.
Plz stop from blaming the player's...ole is a  waste of time...he doesn't roate the squad so how does he expectto find a wining 11??Fredd&mactomin can't win games for us&yet you still see them on the pitch..The worst player on the pitch,wearing the captain arms band...none of the past player's is saying ole need to go:because they're coward to say it...schocles and Ferdinand...own Hargreaves;Garry Nevell wont t tell ole to resign because they don't have the guts to say it...ole is Physical Education coach..
Just play boxing ......
A training ground visit later, Tyson becomes an Ole-In fan
The big man having a frank chat with the squad at Carrington tomorrow morning…. Who would pay on PPV for that?
PE TEACHER
I guess the debate between CR7 vs Tyson Furry, whose the king of manchester (barely even started anyways) is tyson furry at this moment..
Wouldn't make a difference 😂
Ladies and Gentlemen.......introducing United's next manager !!!!!!👏👏👍
Jus give Ole a 5 years contract. I honestly think he's doing pretty good.
Well said tyson, they all need the fergie treatment
"No disrespect to the Manchester United players but I'm gonna come down there and smash your faces in you big dossers." Tyson Fury.
We literally have ronaldo for motivation or that winning mentality , but as all say motivation doesn't do sh*t cz our stubborn manager won't understand it
The word dosser suits well here.
We are using excuses like need a DM. Honestly our squad is very good. Matic or Mctomminay with the right coaching could fill that gap. We are conceding so many goals that it's terrible with the squad we have.
Spot on. Players are just vibing.  I'm not for "ole out" because we've had managers leave and it didn't get any better. If we sack him now we are at the begining again
Just when I thought I couldn’t like this bloke more than I already do. What a lad! 😂
No no he is right
When Liverpool were losing last season I didn't see LeBron James, Kenny Dalglish or Michael Owen intervening with what the current board and management is doing. This is one of the problems with United, Sir Alex Ferguson, Patrice Evra and now Tyson Fury can intervene and use their influence on crucial matters of the club. No wonder a manager like Zidane distanced himself from the United job, language barriers aside who would want to be dictated to by the former manager of the club, former players of the club and now celebrities who happen to support the club coming at training to talk to players. As a Barcelona fan I certainly don't want to see Rijkaard, Ronaldinho and Pau Gasol coming to the Camp Nou to speak to the players about a winning mentality. Why the heck is Sir Alex Ferguson, Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand and now Tyson Fury going to Carrington to speak to the players?
Sort um out Fury because if they cant do it for the badge they might preform to the fret of going 12 rounds with the heavy weight Champ.
with all due respect man please throatpunch the glazers  . I cant handle it anymore
if united players keep playing in this way i am sure that Unied  will have to wait more than 30 years to win the PL cup like Liverpool ...  😢😢😢
Stick to your day job!
Fury sat on his throne threatening the whole United team will be the best thing I see today 😂
players these days know only to perform in social media, no dignity for the sport. utter shame on man utd players who earns millions but does' nt have value of a single penny.
Get him in dugout!!  Pogba would listen to the gypsy king
When Messi didn't score and his team is still winning they blame messi for not scoring ... And when Ronaldo didn't score and his team is loosing they blame the coach ..wow 😂😂😂😂
What the hell has Liverpool got to do with this. Absolutely nothing so let’s us focus on the comments at hand.
Vieras doing a great job at Palace. Get him in.
RIP Man Utd 1878-2021 Those of us who have witnessed United's defeats at Leicester City and at home to Liverpool and Manchester City in recent weeks have been subjected to a style and results that are quite simply unsustainable for a club of this stature.  21% of Man Utd's home defeats in PL history have come under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The last 4 home games in the premiere leage and only scored one goal with 3 defeats and one draw and to top it, Man Utd conceded more goals at OT than Norwich at Carrow Road
Go end give them a good one champ
yeah give them a wake up punch, Ole is too good a guy to be a big club manager, he cannot give players the hair dryer treatment
Sack the lot of them
Tyson for manager
To The Glazer family, SACK HIM NOW FOR LOVE GOD.  FROM MAN UTD FANS (WHAT A JOKE OF CLUB) Defund the Glazers  F==K OLE, JOEL GLAZER, SAF AND GARY NEVILLE (5-0 LOSS AT HOME TO LIVERPOOL) OLE OUT   Did everyone hear the Liverpool and Leeds fans singing Ollie at the wheel – that tell you everything about Ollie and his failures. The propaganda is real in Man Utd & as long Ole stays Man Utd will never win anything & Ole will never be a world class manager that is crucial if you want to have long term success on the pitch. FACT Neville brothers are so bad as managers why should we listen to them anyway😂Everyone watching how good Liverpool and city are looking this season, Proper coaches. Chelsea sacked lampard, got a Elite manager and won the champions league last season. We’re wasting time with ole, we need quality. Man Utd Fans need to put their Olesexuals aside for the sake of the club. All good things ole has done is related to squad and not performance or results. Isn’t everyone tired of this yet ? Lol. This is nothing new. It’s been the same issues for the past 3 years (Counter attack FC) Ole still hasn’t improved or learned anything so i'm Ole out. I'm sorry, but the fact that Ole thinks we have been playing attacking football and the United Way is just delusional.  Means we aren't going to see any change in how we've been playing. If you're still Ole In, please know that there is support out there. Mental illnesses is not a joke. Eric Ten hag knows how to coach football and has a way of playing. Ten Hag or Enrique is type of managers we never tried before! Elite coaches (With their staff as well) who are also excellent managers, in this new era of football you ABSOLUTELY need both The problem with Man Utd is the manager, i don't know for the life of me how people don't see this. They are not coaches properly. Those of us who have witnessed United's defeats at Leicester City and at home to Liverpool and Manchester City in recent weeks have been subjected to a style and results that are quite simply unsustainable for a club of this stature.  21% of Man Utd's home defeats in PL history have come under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. The last 4 home games in the premiere leage and only scored one goal with 3 defeats and one draw and to top it, Man Utd conceded more goals at OT than Norwich at Carrow Road
If he can come in and just knock most of the players out permanently, it would solve the problems
He's not wrong! They're just going through the motions. Lacking the desire to dig in and grind out ugly wins
Basically Manchester United are a bunch of Dossers😂
It seems like he is ready to smash united players
Thank you Tyson.Well said. Get yourself down to Carrington asap. Love you man! ONE LOVE MUFC!.
Warning from the throne
He should come and beat the loser out of them
The passion for this Team is decreasing day by day..
Why is this in the news? Embarrassing
C'mon City
I understand u need winners mentality but if ur bench players r better n more well suited to win the game than ur X11 after awhile as a player u will give up.
Imagine Ole said yesterday that he’s gonna make sure we have a winner’s mentality against watford after the international break. Ole himself doesn’t know himself how to win at this level as a manager
It’s pains me that Tyson fury is a United fan. Such a shame.
Even Tyson would be better than ole
Well all that does is humiliate the players further
Wise words from the heavyweight champion. Hope Man Utd players are listening.
buy the club pls
Attention seekers not getting mine
lol
It won't happen until they get a real coach. Conte would have instilled it for sure.
Man Utd seem happy to lose, they’re willing to defend, defend, defend just to keep the score down as low as possible. Losing 2-0 is like a morale victory for them, their standards have completely gone.
Well deserved warning to Man united players.
Yes FURY!!!   Keep these team talks coming mate!!!
very true they dont care
Good , grab maguire and shaw then teach them how to defend themself.
Please fury knock out that Fridge 🙏, he probably woke up better man.
They don’t have the winner’s mentality 🙌🏻👏🏻👏🏻
cant blame manager for their ability to work hard for their money . They need to engage and push hard.
Tyson Fury is spot on here, the winners mentality, Under Sir Alex there were plenty of times when his team didn't have even close to the level of quality Ole has at his disposal right now, but he had a winning mentality and that ran through the entire team, the current team lacks that, and players like Maguire and Shaw specially are the worst offenders right now.
He should call out Ole being not good enough.
🤣rofl
I want Tyson kick Ole out
Tank u Tyson Fury Enough of this losing mentality n lack of passion these United players have in the team now. We want some of them out of that team, they do not deserve to b playing for man united
I think that's just confirmation bias talking. "Winner's mentality" doesn't win you anything. Thinking you can't lose can backfire when you try to rely on it, rather than actually putting in the work. I think the problem with united is that they still believe they have a devine right to success and all the raw talent and resources are somehow gonna bring results eventually. Why else would all these stars willingly waste years of their careers at this clusterfuck of a club.
Football it's a game. Nobody wins, always. I ❤️Man United, even lose. Bayern, City, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus... lose as the others. Cheers fr Madeira island. Ivo Pestana
Tyson Fury, announces the obvious, nothing to see here.
The Gypsy King has spoken 👑
Now Tyson taking matter into own hands  FIRSTLY HE NEEDS TO KO THE F OUT OF hypocrite NEVILLE,  greedy Glazers , Cardiffs reject OLE AND THE 3 stooges, McTrash & frowsy fallible FRED 💩
Ole can't coach the players so we gotta get Tyson Fury to come coach 😂😂😂the state of our club
Not the players, but the coach. Ole be prepare, you're next!!!
the problem with man united is they keep changing their shape  - they need to stick to one shape and stay with it. It's not a problem of motivation, when the team keeps changing shape, the players cannot develop instincts and a rhytm - a 6th sense about where they need to be and where their teammates will be - liverpool have played a 4 3 3 for the vast majority of time since klopp arrived. The full backs instinctively know where to put crosses and the midfielders instinctively know where and when to press, its team instincts that have made liverpool great and choosing one shape and optimizing it. - Man united should learn from them
Tyson Fury such a legend.
Fury's won more titles than United have in the last 10 years
Sad thing is other people out of football getting involved  man utd shamfull and desperate next you be getting Frank from shameless giving free drugs to the players embarrassen
Ring is out fury, especially Fred and Magur
Tyson fury appointed new manager when ole sacked
The mentality of the players comes from the coaching system...it comes from what they do in training...what they do in training we can all see on the pitch on match days...abysmal
What a lovely man... This guy is a legend
Give them all a slap Fury, they are rich spoilt softies, they dont know they are born, pathetic.
Its the manager mate, not the players
United really went and hired 3 pragmatic coaches in a row, what a mess down there
Isn't their 100k to 500k wages earned per week more than enough to motivate them?
He is 100% correct. We look like timid lost sheep out there on the pitch when we are supposed to be brave lions that play with no fear, smh.
Sack ole replace Tyson furry
Tyson Fury thinks he's Mr depression king now doesn't he..
why rant players not solskjaer lol
Better management then ole
clout chasing.. real clubs fires the manager
There’s our new manager right there
Ole is a dosser
I love Tyson ❤️
It’s partly the players, but mainly the manager. Start using your platform to tell the truth! The manager is out of his depth, absolutely clueless.
WAAAHHHHH😭 we don't like losing waahhhh, we are so spoilt and it hurts to lose 😭😭Give the manager another 400 million to spend 😭
Throw Tyson and all the UTD players  in a ring for 24 man Royal Rumble only Ronaldo and Gea will be ringside to throw them back again in ring. Atleast that will build some character and fight in them.
This's for the Real Manchester United fans ✌✌😍❣
This is clearly Ole's fault and sadly he has many friends, even the board couldn't sack him
OMG 😳😳
Take your dad with you Tyson!  Can you imagine Big John ripping into Harry Maguire?
i love tyson fury.
Liverpool R the best
Gary sold himself for money....Keane, Hargreaves and Scholes still back Ole....it's all friendship over the club !
0:48 should bring Roy Keane with you too. That’ll show them
It's Ole who is not tactically sound as well as not able to ignite the players' spirit, which in turn is causing the team to perform badly. It was tough to see Lampard get sacked, but ultimately Tuchel did wonders at Chelsea. Similarly instead of changing the United squad, getting rid of Ole is logical and change will follow.
Lovely. Now the players are going to get sent off as they will end up uppercutting their opponents!
As an Arsenal fan myself I can relate to what must be going through Man U fans heads right now.  Tyson should speak to the United board and arrange a visit to chat with the players. His honest and no nonsense approach can only help.
Tysons absolutely spot on
Ole and some of the players don’t have a winning mentality they just play for draw
He has more passion than all ex-players combined !
Ronnie has left the building
"hard word" seems like code for something
united lost relevancy in the 12/13 season, I seriously wouldn't waste your breath on them tyson lad xD
Ole In
Give them a spanking, Ronaldo will bring the salads.
No disrespect to Tyson but he is giving motivation to a team which has one of the greatest and most motivated athlete ever along with other world cup winning players. It's not the player's fault, its just a guy who is at the wheel.
How much are you getting paid?
That's why imma man utd fan❤✌🙂👌
first of all 4 2 3 1 is not the Manchester Utd way never as been and never will be + last season we played well away from home and shite at home ...finished 2nd in the league unbeaten away from home things were on the up we buy three players and now everything is fuked ...maybe Ole cant do it or a few players cant be arsed a new manger wouldnt help things at the momment ...some players do need to be dropped or have they fuking arses kicked ...
lets be honest. Their target yesterday was getting out alive with a narrow 0-1/1-2 lose
It's clear to see the players are fed up with Ole and are now downing tools. Obviously there's some in there that aren't fit to wear the shirt but even Stevie Wonder can see that the payers don't respect Ole and are taking the piss putting in shite performances...
"see you all soon, be prepared"  The slap-athon is coming soon to Old Trafford. Exclusively on IGTV.
ole out fury in
just slap pogba up for all the years he's been robbing us of wages.
So you think. Football is like boxing. 11 players must align in thinking to win a match.
I feel the pain he's going thru like any other ardent fan out there
I like the chair
Oh christ
If this kind of pep talk works, I don't think there's any problem with Man U. It's the fact that these talks never work. Just talk and no action... Something has to change rather than talk talk talk... Tyson better get in there and smash some faces in.
i mean you can have that winners mentality until you appoint Ole as your head boxing coach.
Why doesn't he take the manager and throw him out as well? Cause that's the real issue along with the Glazers
Hahahaha he's sitting on a throne
Tyson is kinda calling out ole as well as the players bc he talks about a winning mentality and basically never giving up even when it looks like it’s over. After the Liverpool game ole said the game was done at 4-0 which shows such a poor mentality. I know it’s Liverpool and they are world class but you can’t just accept defeat at half time. If newcastle came back from 4-0 against arsenal and got a draw then surely with the amount of quality and ability at united they can get 4 goals, but what actually happened is everyone gave up including the manager and we didn’t even score one
Tyson is right !  The team looked a bit clueless, and the performance was much worse than the result as we can live with a loss but not getting hammered at every aspect of the game !  The saddest thing is this wasn't a surprise and the whole team cannot rely on Ronaldo all the time to pull off a win against the run of play !  I like Ole although changes need to happen and several overpaid and overhyped players need to leave now !  Liverpool and City are streets ahead and pulling further away and they have world class managers/trainers ( we do not ).
Fury will recommend Eric Cantona to be the United manager since Eric will train the players especially Ronaldo how play football with Kung Fu at the same time
We need Tyson, Roy Keane and Sir Alex Ferguson in the dressing room before United's games, that would be box office Oh, and Souness specifically for Pogba.
No amount of advice will change the attitude when u have clueless manager, dead captain, & unstable midfielders. United are spoiling my weekend consistently
there's only 5 players good enough to play for man united , De Gea  Fernandez, Ronaldo, Greenwood and Varane (if he has a good defence with him)
Imagine teaching WINNER'S  mentality to Cristiano Ronaldo 🤦  Please all celebs of football World REALISE it's the MANAGER  We fans are on verge of tears  Even rival fans are giving sympathy 🤦
Utd players who the foook is this guy
Lmao brilliant
Too they can’t stuff their gloves
He's definitely right and I think ole is too nice a guy to say this to them!
Went to church for the first time in months. Prayed for Ole to be sacked💯
Can he send this message to hull city aswell lol, our team just seems like they don't even wanna play. They were happy that they beat 2nd from bottom in the table and we have only won 3 games so far this season
ole out
Tyson bookies favourite to become new manager.
Pogba dosser
Hope he slams some sense into ole...so that he walk away..along with his no good assistant coaches.
The players? Oh god
The first person to get a pummelling from Tyson Fury - OGS Ole needs to wake up, fast.
You dont wanna make him angry :D United players gonna have some fun very soon
Is he becoming to Furious Fury?
I've lost all respect for tyson how dare you challenge lord Ole you're lucky he isn't a boxer or you'd be washed by now😂
Fury in
If Tyson was receiving instructions from OGS's coaching staff in the training gym, his outlook might be different.
Start with Maguire
It's so painfully obvious at this point that the problem is the manager not the players
Start Fury ahead of Harry Maguire and give him the captain's armband, he'll soon sort out this bunch of DOSSERS
Just remember what Rio, the Nevilles, Scholes and everyone of Ole's friends said. They love him like you should.  You have Ole, 'Ole is at the wheel' so now embrace it.
As a neutral Maguire is not a captain...Bruno was trying to motivate the team but Harry was just looking scared all game
Even this man can see it the players are the wrong players for united no strong mentality. The players they give up no fight walking around not listening to coaches not listening to Bruno and ronaldo the amount of times they telling them is unreal difference between world class and mid table players
New MANU coach.
Be prepared 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Hell yeah! And Keano. Joint managers.
So what about Fred? If he has a winning mentality, does that make him a Utd player? No.
Astonishing to see Roy Keane and Gary Neville criticizing only the players and not Manager. Obviously, players deserve the criticism but why spare manager just because he is there former teammate. Because these guys didn't spare Jose Mourinho and finding it difficult to utter words against Ole.
Wait for 30 yrs. Like Liverpool
Extra security at old Trafford please ?
Fury you cannot forget that boxing is not football, it’s a team game with a manager that tells you what to do
Tyson fury for manager
Never a truer word. Lost the dressing room. Ole out
Ole in! Lol
Ole please leave
If you’ve watched every game this season you will have watched the effort levels come down for those players. I think it’s because they’re set up to lose every game with dead tactics and negative football
Ronaldo is probably the only one who has the winning mentality & he can't do it by himself.
Love it!
Give it Fury tut' end of season
Man United are crap the rubbish team ever
I think you should start managing the team Fury and give them spanners what they need.
Yes! Tyson Fury is a United fan too 🔴❤️
This boxer doesn't understand that Cr7 has 10 ×times more fighting spirit than him.
Appoint Tyson as a motivation coach, he wouldn't have to say much, just give him the authority to slap them if he thinks they aren't giving 100%
what a chair ha
If Ole picked Tyson in midfield instead of McTominay or Fred United would do better
Rudiger was on his way out of Chelsea.  Since tuchel came in he been one of the best in the league. Tuchel had a side which wasn't even his . After three years of building , the least you can do is challenge for the title.
Not a single one of Liverpool’s player had a winning mentality before Klopp arrived he made players from Southampton and Sunderland world class
I’m a Chelsea fan but I do really loved our rivalry with United.. I hate Tottenham Liverpool and city  Why do Manchester United fans don’t complain about Harry maguire being captain is beyond me  Ole should get the sack for giving him the armband  It’s criminal, we talk about United and you bring some bang average player and make captain.. really  Even when ronaldo is back
Legend
See Tyson knows.
😂 😂 😂 U need to teach them to Attack!
It's the coaching and manager, love ole he's a great footballer but not manager. The players haven't got a clue what the plan is.... they've broke pogba, broke fernandes, broke Rashford, telles, martial, van der beek, even Ronaldo looks in despair .... ole and his full team needs to go ASAP...
Thanks man😂❤️
Neville keep protecting ole please Cheers,  Rest of the league.
Is he on a throne?
The Gipsy King, Tyson Fury!!!
Yep
They’re all bums
The gypsy king 👑 💪🏿💪🏿
It’s Sean Dyche!
Listening to Nedum on ESPN says it all. What’s the meaning of me and Patrice will come down to training? What other team does this happen? Can Gerrard go down to Liverpool to do the same thing these ex united players feel they can do with Ole? Is this Manchester United or a circus?
This team ain't had a winning mentality for years now
These players except for a few are just happy to turn up, lose and then get paid
I thought he's managing Burnley xD :)
Ole ride off so clueless and unserious coach no tactics just vibes. 🇬🇭😭⚽
Evra, Rio, Keane, SAF, Khabib and now Fury
Thats the man united spirit…not this home alone looking kid smiling in interviews after every loss…
THE PLAYERS AREN’T THE PROBLEM, THE MENTALITY COMES FROM THE COACHES, THEY’RE RESPONSIBLE
Let me guess, Him and Sugar will train them for Free?
So true! 👊
Fury new Man U coach? 😂
Legend also knows that  The manager and players are working like babies
my man gonna smash some sense into ole
Couldn't agree more 🥊💯
Legend
Real talk 💯
The coach does not have it.
Respect bro
Respect to fury👏👏👏👏
