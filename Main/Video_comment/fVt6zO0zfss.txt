My household fruit flies must be sociopaths then.  They definitely dont die when i kill their family members
PTSD has deep roots.
Not in a weird way, but I like this gal. 🤗
Crap My Flies Sit On Top As If They Want To Mate
“…seeing dead flies may send living flies into what they call a “depression-like state”, which ends up shortening their lifespan”  Saved you 7mins.
If I seen dead bodies laying around hap hazardly everywhere I went...I would surely reach my end much faster.
0:35 lost opportunity to say "fly in"
I can’t stop wondering how do people know if a fly is blind or deaf?! 😂 Sorry this is probably a stupid question.
I used to hide fly bodies from the rest 💀
Romeo and Juliet?
It has been known for 20 years that if a girl lives in an unstable environment, evolutionarily she is better off having children earlier than waiting to mature and take better care of later children, to the point that these girls actually start menstruating earlier.
nah, no such thing as deprex or x griex or etc, doesnt matter, and ceptuxuax, do things not deprex etc about things, otherx, x dead x or etc or not doesn tmatter, idts
We might learn something about ourselves, but the evidence says we almost certainly wont.  According to the FDA, 96% of animal studies end up being absolutely irrelevant to humans....  Which means its almost guaranteed that more people have died because of animal studies, than have been saved.  It's past time to stop wasting our money on science that has a 96% failure rate.
Yea kodak said it
To be fair, a scrub jay's favorite thing is screaming. I'm impressed researchers managed to distinguish that as a behavior
I'm never killing a fly without using it for psychological warfare again in my life.
I bet this person smells like cats...
What would be the evolutionary advantage of dying on being exposed to death?
no, your wrong, they're just tf2 players who saw someone kill-bind
New fly trap idea incoming 😂😂😂
Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana.
That's so interesting yet odd phenomena....in what way would seeing and smelling your dead "comrade" be any good that you also drop dead. I really do hope this research helps with how our mind works etc.
Zoomer Science Fun Time Science Show Please Like
Yes, time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana.
So I should stop cleaning up the dead flies on my window sill
Are schools still allowed to show youtube videos? I feel like the spontaneous ad stuff would make that impossible.
Ah, SciShow. Or as I like to think of it "fascinating answers to creepy questions you never asked" 🎉
I smell bull lies
Not the ones in my shack.More they get caught in spider webs and die more they come.Must be the so called aliens Americans seem to see.😒
Explains why insect frass works so good
This is written pretty clickbaity, it's not like they just drop dead the way its presented at the beginning. They just like 30% less long
Misleading title, too much short-handing "fruit flies" to just "flies" ...& now there are people who think this applies to regular flies, spreading it around the internet in blatant defiance of evidence in reality, causing arguments  _AND WORST: providing fodder for science deniers._ YES, I've run across it myself. People believe what ScShow tells them & repeat it. In the spirit of the channel, this should be amended or even removed & replaced. My humble ¢₵.
they go with the crowd. its the cool thing to do. peer pressure.death is a way of life, baby
So. Did I miss something? I feel like this was a "how flies die...dead flies" not "why flies die... dead flies"
Listening to this, I marvel that our species is making this inquiry into how things work in the insect world, yet I find myself mildly disturbed that someone like me is out there doing the investigatory research and making an excruciating record of the results.  And although I might know where to find a supply of blind fruit flies for the endeavor, the need for a quantity of identical flies which can (who can) see but not smell leave me stultified.  I write this at 1:09 in the morning without my glasses on...
5:21 Well what if it happens so slowly you haven't noticed?
I died when I saw the thumbnail              -        Jk
Looks that could kill
Correct me if I'm wrong.... "Very just what" isn't a qualifying description, right?
Within days of my Grandad dying of cancer, his brother dropped dead from a heart attack. At my Grandad's funeral, his brothers funeral was announced.
So... Instead of relying on fly repellent I should just keep the dead fly around? Got it
Oh good, flys don't have feelings so don't mind the swatfest over here!
The Fruit Fly was created by God and dies after it finishes its intended job.
This person looks sad, but I couldn’t find a good way to word how. Then I looked at their personal YouTube page and saw a playlist for “late night comedy and climate change”…  That’s peak they/them content.
maybe it's an evolutionary response to prevent them from spreading bad genes? just a lame guess
This is truly fascinating.
This chick needs to get out more.
So this explains why Kodak Black said "dead like flies" in his XXL Freshmen freestyle. Thanks to Science!
Is it possible that flies are evolutionarily wired to avoid dead flies because they want nothing to do with whatever killed it?
Piano!
Scientists and their tendency to reject empathy for any small living being baffles me. Flies develop physiological depression, age and die when seeing a dead relative, but don't mistake it for feelings like humans have, because then that would go down an ethical rabbithole over how they created enough dead, blind flies as well as flies lacking neurological receptors to make an adequate test...Studies are fascinating but how they deny evidence they don't want to believe for the sake of convenience is upsetting.
is the thumbnail the guy on the grandpas ashes g sups
How are they not extinct??
This is useful information…
Giving a like just because of the pun
Does anyone remember the episode of hoarders with the lady that ate her poop.... why does the narator look like that lady?
Imagine being the intern who has to blind flies all day, of stuff their tiny nostrils with cotton balls.
Big X
This SciShow told me basicly to keep dead flys there as a warning for others so i have less. Intresting, less cleaning for more cleanliness xD
Yoo fr fr? I'll unalive flies and keep the bodies safe from ants and shi then
Male fruit flies will aim at fermented fruits and alcoholic beverage to get drunk after they breed because they have no other purpose once they breed they are over.
black and floppy ey?
Where is Hank and who is she?
Imo, this is another example of academia reading too far into an event. This is far from proof of anything. Coincidence and some correlation. Yes. Causation? No.
It's kinda weird that they die looking at their dead, but they are born in our dead. Weird.
Now if only they could tweak those neurons to self-destruct in every fly species. : D
Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned. For the wages of sin are death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ. Repent and believe the Gospel and be saved. It is entirely free. It is entirely of grace through faith alone in Christ Jesus.
blud really did explain a new way to make a flytrap💀💀                     interesting:D
2:13 the chubby apostle from berserk anyone?   The nickelson grin
Grief
Maybe this is a way to limit the transmission of infectious diseases that affect flies. I can't think of many other circumstances where a fly would stumble upon a bunch of dead flies in nature.
💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Unknowingly, I kept a dead fruit fly encased in tape hoping to scare other flies away and it worked
This new girl is pretty entertaining!   PBS needs some new talent.
fun fact: everything they says in this video is complete crap, they actually pass out and die.
Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana. Missed opportunity for this one.
Perspective = Eternal Youth. Let’s go who needs a fountain when I *am,* the fountain.
Wish house flies gained this skill
This is real lmao
I watched 30 seconds of this cringe nonsense before I couldn't take anymore and had to turn it off.
*Me omw to place dead flies in every window and door so i can make myhouse flyless:*
so youre telling me the key to killing fruit fly infestation is leave a few of their buddies dead bodies outside for them to see?
Okay maybe I'm the one new to this channel. So, is the host a male or female. Or, one of those that "identify" as a tree or something. Need a video on this. What is it...
Is that supposed to be a woman
So will fasting make humans live longer?
I swear to God, I've been contemplating this and wondering for a few months now why i feel so sucked dry, exhausted, sick, depressed, and stupider in this new house with new roommates... I'm around people who appear...barely alive...  I swear I'm noticing deleterious physiological effects. I'm going to test if i completely withdraw psychologically and just witness how this environment effects me.
Lol what a crock of shite.  I've had 2 flies flying around my window with a fly trap that has at least 30 dead flies on it for at 3 days at least.  People will believe damn near anything these days.
Boy or girl😬
I'm pretty sure that having depression comes with a very short life span.  In humans.
Great video, I really enjoyed that 😊
Moral of the story. Don't clean up dead flies.
They lost 20% of their lifespan from seeing a pile of coprses. Seems pretty normal to me
Damn.. imagine forcing humans in a box with rotting corpses
splash damage
All of this actually makes a lot of sense from survival perspective, as lots of dead flies in one place can indicate a presence of some type of hazard. And you`ll certainly want to avoid being in a hazardous place. And if you find yourself in a potentially dangerous place, you`ll want to be more alert, which in turn requires a lot more energy and induces more stress on the cells.
*MOST probably it is a beneficial survival of the species mechanism.*  If there are dead flies, then maybe there is not a lot of food around, so if other flies live shorter, less new maggots will appear, and then there will be more food left for the remaining maggots that might pop up.
Who knew flies could also get traumatized :0
I mean if you put a corpse in my room I'd probably die sooner as well due to the trauma
Flys get shocked, and ptsd too...
Maybe quote on quote depression is something dangures and it affegs  smaller animal more that bigger
Could have fooled me. Seems like when one dies, 100 more pop up to take its place! 😂
Everyone just gonna ignore the "blind flies n flies that couldnt smell"part... scientist are messed up in the head. At least they were just flies in this case, i wonder how the monkeys reacted? The blind ones n ones that coukdnt smell.. science.. woo!
Time to decorate the house w taxidermy flies
I stumbled across this little bottle of bath spray that had like 100 dead fruit flies in the top. It has a tiny hole and I imagine they like the smell, crawl through the hole and then can't get out. But the sheer number of fruit fly corpses inside always made me wonder wtf happened to them lol. I guess mystery solved. I kept the bottle and still use it when the fruit flies are bad by simply placing it near the garbage.
Clickbait
Im depressed. Hope it doesn't fkn kill me
America: cloaca gentium has produced another completely unidentifiable creature I can see. Man/woman/adult/child/black/white/human/tortoise. Who can say what this creature really is.
this guy is very smart
Wait... How do you know if a fruit fly is blind or cant smell?
OH I AM GOING TO USE THIS INFORMATION WELL, THE DAYS OF ME JUST THROWING AWAY THE CORPSE ARE OVER. NOW I WILL PUT THEM ON DISPLAY WHERE THEY ARE MOST ACTIVE!!!
This is really interesting but I don't think I'll leave a bunch of insect corpses on my window sills, it's not very nice to look at
Did this answer the question when I wasn't looking
I’m gonna leave out some dead flies just to make them think twice
Props to the scientists who took the time to scan the brains of fruit flies. Not usually something one would expect out of the community. 😆
tldw: we don't know
Sympathetic death 😭😭😭
Bro didn’t know flies had something in common with me When I see someone asleep I fall asleep
am i the only one that thinks the t maze looking like a female womb is funny lol?
So if I kill a fly I can just leave it around somewhere and it acts a a fly repellant/killer
Wtf did not know this was a thing....
They think it is a new TikTok challange or the newest trend, to die.
Next time I see a fly in my house I'm going to show it a dead fly
o
I know an old woman that swallowed a fly......
This is the first time I heard that flies die when the see other dead flies.
The best all-natural insect repellant is to wipe dead flies on your face.
YWNBAM.
...how do we know if flies are blind and cant smell? are flies born without the ability to see and smell? Are their naturally disabled flies?!
Bees becoming nearly immortal : "I love democracy"
So.. Lesson of the video, if you want to keep flies out of your home put a bunch of dead flies on tooth picks on your window sills as though your home is a castle?
I'm so confused
"Blind flies" - The researchrs probably had to make those flies blind for the experiment💀
thanks pat the more you know
Plot for straight to video horror story: group of teen trapped in the same room with dead people and age to death from depression
Wtf is that thumbnail
1:21  black and floppy was my nickname in high school 😂😂😂😂
I really like this presenter. Really good style.
That jar full of vinegar and dead flies must be like a genocide. My mom must be stopped.
Don’t Kick the bucket or else others will push daisies 😅

Please do not kill flies 🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
So really...flies can be traumatized by seeing death. Great, now I have to feel bad for killed pest insects.
Is he a she or is she a he? (or neither?)
Isn’t it weird that they made this video? Make no mistake: this information is absolutely useless; worthless even. And yet somehow, somewhere behind the scenes, someone was like “let’s make a video about flies dying sometimes.” And get millions of views.
Ooouffgh geez you are hard to look at, but you do okay VO. Watched this without video and it was alot better
So to kill flies all you need are dead flies? I'll put their heads on toothpicks and scatter them around the house.  I'm going to create a god of death for the flies, build out of their dead relatives.  An unholy sacrifice will be made.
in this video I've learned that I am in fact a scrubjay
"Ferb i know what we're going to do today"
They do?💀
You say this doesn't quite apply to humans, but lets be real, if I was pushed into a T maze by some giant flies and there were a bunch of dead humans in one branch, and I had to just live there like that, I'd probably go "Eh, guess I'll just die now" too.
Thanks for that.
Ok I’m setting up an open casket viewing near my fruit basket.
Kind of a clickbait title tbch
I am perplexed on whether this guy is a guy or a girl.
time flies... i love y'all 😂💚💚💚
So THIS is why I keep seeing something that looks like a fruitfly massacre by my window. D:
😭Glad I saw this in october
Bull.. It's been my policy; lining up dead flies and wasps (as a warning to the others), but I can't say that it's made a difference.  Maybe there's a difference between lab flies and outdoor flies.
Guys, did we just discover dark matter?
See its not that im a lazy bastard that doesn't like to clean in fact i was just sending a message... would you stick around if you saw a bunch of your comrades just laying around dead
Interesting topic, great thumbnail
I love them so much. Second only to Hank
Maybe the stress is causing the flies to age more
this thumbnail is epic
I didn't know Pat from SNL become a youtuber.
maybe they're really empathetic
PTSD
The joke about the mini therapist sofa was adorable T^T
And isopods just be like "oooo a snack" 😋
Did anyone also get a very strange ad at the beginning that knew the channel you were watching?
Pat?
is she a man
Anything that kills flies is good.  OK, this is just fruit flies but they're still a pain in the arse.
I always look up how insects treat their dead when I find and squash one at home ever since I found out about ant graveyards it’s fun to be informed
3:20 I believe you meant to say “giving it less of certain kinds of foods”, because all-around not giving a fly enough food will not make it live longer lol
Why is the title stated like this is a common fact😂
I am going to be kinda rude... But doesn't she look like the principal from Lab Rats?
So it's a good idea to leave dead wasps around then
Youngest grandma I've ever seen
hello I am from India learning English. "Hello dear friends, You know, this video about flies was very educational. I really learned a lot and it was so interesting. I did not know they die when are they seeing death. I am very fascinated with these small creatures and the host did an amazing job of teaching me about them and their lives. The host is she is such a great teacher, I could listen to her all day! I recommend this video to everyone, it is very entertaining and entertaining. Thank you my dear friend, I hope you also enjoy this video as much as I do.
Glad to see Pat is still getting jobs after that horrible early 2000s movie.
Seems like flies need to do some evolving. Dying doesn't seem like the optimal survival strategy.
Why is this gender fluid male talking to me in this video? These animals should be in a mental asylum not on my youtube feed
Crows hold funerals and then confer to see if they can figure out the cause of death. With their amazing facial recognition it is best not to be around or they may tie you to the death.
So the meaning of life is death, got it!
I would feel bad for them... but they're just so annoying. I'll use this as a way to get rid of them
Many flies died around me when they saw thumbnail of this video-
what the hell? so if we want to get rid of flies we just have to scatter dead flies everywhere?!😁
Interesting. So keeping a fly trap out with the corpses visible is actually even more effective than it seems.
Glad this isn’t the same for humans- I work in hospice.
The fruit fly: What’s the point to all this wing beating if Tommy just lies here, totally innocent, yet he’s dead? I guess I’ll die. 😂😂😂
Dead anything else and its party time thou
This likely happens as an adaptation to disease and pathogens. They live less, but that also means less of a chance to spread pathogens, and since they populate very quickly and have short lifespans, this can make a huge difference in the overall health of the population. So in essence they are sacrificing themselves for future generations, because the longer they are around, the more time they have to get infected with and spread pathogens. The presence of dead bodies in a natural setting, would indicate to them that something is killing them off and in great numbers, thus calling for a response. While dying quicker might seem counter productive, it can actually be beneficial, especially when we're talking about insect species that can aggregate in huge swarms, which would allow for pathogens to spread rapidly. But by reducing their numbers, they reduce the size of swarms, thus having an effect on the spread of pathogens.
No one has ever even heard of this… so no one has ever even asked about this.
What am I looking at?
The real reason why, is that they're really monkey's.  And we all know, monkey see monkey do.
Wait… are you that one person from those funny school skits on YouTube shorts?
Does the same apply to big garbage flies? I mean then the best way to get rid of them would be not to clear away their corpses in your room. Yuk.
Time to start putting dead flies heads on little pikes around the house
Good… the bodies of their friends and families I leave as warnings are working…
So you're saying I should stop vacuuming fruit flies and instead swat them? That way I don't have to kill all of them and the rest will still die.
DOOOOOOD!!!
This host is a diversity hire.
Soooo, in order to get rid of flies, we need to leave the dead flies around the tables so they all can die when they come in? Gotcha. I'll remember that for next time...  *Dumps a barrel of dead flies all over the living room floor. Leaves*  Cause why am I gonna live in a house full of dead flies?  *sets house on fire*
That dude doesn't seem very smart.
Is the host male or female?
So dead flies on a windowsill serve a purpose after all.
I will make sure to leave some dead ones out, so they know whats coming
This is true! All my friends that witness my decaying & dead marriage soon have their own cadaver-like marriage as well!
whats this guy talking about, he is bugging me
They start rapidly aging? How do you know? Do they apply for a pension?
This dude has a sense of humor😂
It doesn't make sense they do that. In nature, the idea is to keep reproducing, defend, battle, conquer so on and so forth. So if the fruit fly dies by seeing it's dead buddies, can you imagine if every living species on Earth did the same thing?
Wanted to find out but I need eye bleach in first 3 seconds where's another video on it lol
Hey it’s Pat from SNL!
why LGBT host
More like sic show 😨
Guess ill die
Pat is that you
Good that I keep some dead flies on windows
Now I know that elephants try to move their dead friends and trumpet when they realize they’re dead. How am I supposed to just go on with my day after this?
Gonna tape a dead fly to my window with a tiny light beside it so they all die when they try and come in at 2am
Damn are morticians okay?
"Yooooo... My heeeaaad... I'm so friggin wasted!"  *BOOM*  "Don't suck flies."           If you know where that's from, I salute you.
0:28 I had this same reaction right here. Amazing fly facts, alternate-universe Jonah Hill!
Stress ... their metabolism was increased so they could avoid potential danger. That is very expensive (energy). Without being able to fly away they rapidly depleted their fat and glucose stores and died.
I find this very ironic considering the fact that when flies see the dead remains of _literally any other species,_ they rush to the scene and have a freaking party—feasting on excrement and decaying corpses for as long as they can 😆  But their own species? Ey at least they aren’t cannibals…thats a plus for flies in my book
Now if we get can men on the internet & corporations to do this …. Most of the worlds problems would be solved!
So fruit flies are weak to literal miasma?
we dont need to see the obese girl to explain it. Just narrate the thing. Very distracting. clicked off early
Dead flies: *Exist*   That fly that saw the bodies: "Life it seems will fade away, drifting further everyday..."
Fly : "Dan? Daaan?! Oh god why? Who did this to you? F-. What do I do without you.. i dont wanna live anymore.." Hooman : "Lol why are you dead too, fly?"
Wtf is this creature that's talking. I thought it was a dude. The voice doesn't match
Brb, need ti get some dead flies
Pat
how tf the algorithm gonna know im reading that Stephen King short story about buddy tripping over a pair of sneakers because they been in a bathroom stall to long and dead flies are starting to pile on and around them, awesome vid all the same
Trauma in flies...😮
And then chickens will just eat their brethren lol.
It’s unfortunate that this woman is so hard to listen to. I know this is about science and not personality but hers is so off putting I just can’t get through the video to learn the information…
This has nothing to do with grieving. Really a stretch to try and tie all of this together with the idea that it relates to grieving and depression in humans just because the word "depression" is used, even after you admit that depression in flies is not the same as depression in humans.
Wtf is the evolutionary benefit of this
Just her/his voice would be enough for a narrator.
Time to go Vlad the Impaler on flies. Now, where's my toothpicks...
are you a boy or a grill
imagine being forced into a room to look at and smell corpses of your species until you die
Mom: Would you jump off a cliff if everyone else was doing it?  Flies: Yes.
The acceletated ageing is probably caused by the "stench" odor of dead flies. I would die soon as well if I were stuck  in a room with dead humans 😬
if u see ded, u ded.
I feel like something not discussed here might be more relevant: ammonia from decomposition. Do dead fruit flies produce it? And if so, wouldn't that cause harm to the living fruit flies, therefore causing aversion to the dead ones? Roaches have been found to adapt by avoiding areas where a roach has been killed by harsher chemicals or being stomped, but also less aware of gel baits which can be consumed, brought back to their nests, kill them, then continue to kill other roaches that consume their dead bodies.
“We are gathered here today to honor the passing of Tim the fly. He was- HRRK-!!” *thud*
Sad = bad  Noted
Flies ------->
I didn't know that
Or maybe we need more research into how it affects humans as well, being around corpses. The emotional toll alone definitely can't lengthen ones life...
Here's a disgusting fact. The common house fly is a cannibal. Next time you have a bunch of house flies around your garbage, pick a good spot, put out a little bit of bait, then use a flyswatter to squash the flies that land on it. Remove the bait. Wait for more flies to arrive. Proceed to swat the flies as they land on the pile of dead flies. You can do this till the sun sets or whenever you run out of flies. If you leave the pile of dead flies till the next day, you can continue the carnage until dusk, or you run out of flies. You can repeat this every day until you run out of flies. My record is 22,000 flies in a week. I didn't run out of flies. But I did stop this bizarre activity because the folks at the veteran's shelter were concerned about me sitting there for a whole week on a bucket, swatting flies, and creating a disgusting mess. It was a big, disgusting pile of dead flies and maggots. I did this during the Covid lockdown because I was bored.  🫠
They die of grief. Kind of cute actually
Time to scatter dead flies everywhere
So I can just leave dead flies where I don't want them to bother me.
It's always the damned Drosophila. You can't escape them.
This guy knows his fly facts.
Does that work on House Flys???
So since I am depressed that I had to say goodbye to my beloved dog far too soon 2 weeks ago, the grieving means I'll likely naturally see him again sooner? Silver lining?
Crazy how this video gets recommended to me as I just saw 3 dead flies in the same spot on my kitchen floor
How tf do you check if a fly is blind or cant smell. How do you even find emough flies that are blind or cant smell to do research??
I think is just the flies got stressed and aged because of it and since they're flies, well, they died fast. Remember kids, stress can kill you
does this mean grouping old folks in old folks' homes is not good?
Humans who have a great life and are very popular tend not to be able to cope with traumatic events very well. You'd think it would be related somehow.  Oh, and the full phrase is "time flies when you're having fun" which is appropriate.
Breathing is knocking years off of our life if we didn't breath oxygen we would live a lot longer
Nothing against this woman... but i really miss the old hosts. Specifically hank. Used to watch every video... but its just not the same, anymore.
Is that why I see TONS of dead flies in piles!?
So do nurses and care workers have shorter life expectancies than say pharmacists? I started nursing in the autumn and had laid out my first body by the end of the 1st week. Working nights one winter the 5 medical wards in our section had 23 deaths in one (unusual) night. It was a mad night as A & E was also overflowing and shouting for beds.
If that were true... why so many fruit flies.... tons of dead ones lol
my cat ate a fly infront of another fly, the fly flew in my cats mouth
I’m only 40 seconds in but the info about flies dying instantly on sight of a dead relative is inaccurate. Their life span decreases exponentially. It’ll probably be mentioned but maybe im wrong too.
is true you know , i had notice this so much when i see dead fly with a bunch of them sure will die together.  and i wonder why they never learned from mistake to fly away to avoid it.           Sticky tape fly trap, is full of dead fly just in one sticky pad
I haven’t watched the video yet.    But imma going to guess.       Heartbreak.   They die from heartbreak.
now i will have to put their heads on tooth picks if theres too many in the kitchen , and now i know they will get the message
So does that mean, one should put dead fruit flies next to fruit?
Guess I’ll leave the body of flies as a warning
Well. Guess I'll stay on my SSRI in that case! And any case....
Imagine if Humanity could die like this bet there would be way less murder
I didn’t realise Pat was presenting YT content these days?
As A Human , I feel so sad when see Flies Lifespan Is so Short time ❤
Anything which makes fruit flies die faster is a welcome gift. THEY ARE THE SCOURGE OF MY KITCHEN. They try and nest on my cieling but i suck them up with my handheld vacuum cleaner. I'm quite good at this now and can poach the bastards out of mid air.
Fruitflies let the "dark thoughts" win.
Imagine being a scientist and your job is making flies depressed
You’re an Vivec deepfake
Are you truly Vivec?
is this a boy or a girl
so what you're saying is that the flies are down? ba dum tss
My guess it is a protection mechanism. They dies to let other live, because of potential poison, infection or bacteria. They reduced amount of infected in swarm.
So if we were born and were told that we live forever our whole life we would live longer ? 🧐🤨
Time flies, HA
People usually don't die when seeing dead relatives but they can sometimes if they were particularly close to someone of coarse this is the depression where they have reduced appetite or become malnourished from not eating properly or they can die from being too sad although rarer. Such as when a man and woman married die a couple weeks apart even if the second person to die was healthy before. Or with dogs sometimes say the owner is older or gets sick and know they will die soon they make arrangement for someone to watch their pet after they pass on but its too upset to eat and dies after a few weeks as well.
Creepy, but interesting. I found your explanation easy for a layman like me to follow, engaging and without a load of unnecessary waffle. Thank you.
A lot of people in here think they know better than someone who actually has a degree in it
gibby?
Poor little things.
ok im confused is this a guy or girl
Interesting. So, dead flies act as a fly repellent in some way.
Ohh… so that’s why there were like, 500 dead fruit flies on my table one time
Okay, now we knows how to wipe them out. All we need is a dead flies.
When we had chickens we would have a lot of flies and i would always wonder why they died out of nowhere
So the flies go 💀👀💀
they die if they see other dead flies??  time to leave their corpses for others to find i guess xD
So, if I want to get rid of flies in my room, I should leave their bodies after I kill them
I am more actually amazed that "brain" itself of the living creature can control it's own lifespan...
So the effigies I made work?
It's too bad this doesn't work on roaches. In the apartment where I used to live, we had an infestation, and when I'd kill one, I'd leave its body as a warning to the other roaches so they'd go away. It didn't work, and they didn't die either, so we just ended up moving.
Um ....okay . I hope no tax dollars were wasted on this
Is that Pat from SNL?
I'm curious if they tested the shorter lifespan flies for increased metabolism? Trying to think of an evolutionary reason/benefit for this. Just wondering if nature sped up their life cycle to try and breed before whatever killed the other flies gets them too.
So how come when I set one of those liquid+plastic wrap traps, and it starts to get them, the rest of them don’t all die??
This is excellent fodder for a new SCP
idk about fly reproduction.. but I assume a sped up aging process triggered by seeing dead flies could be a survival mechanism they pushed younger flies reproduce faster to replace the dead.  again I'm no expert lol just speculation from someone who knows nothing about flies aside from that they are annoying and can carry diseases
i experienced this first hand! i was walking home with a group of friends one day after school when i saw a bumblebee sitting next to a dead one on the sidewalk. i made a comment about it mourning its friend half jokingly but one of my friends poked the corpse and that cause the bee next to attack and attack him specifically... lmao bastard deserved it.
I wish the same thing happend to god damn roaches 😑
Anything: *does anything* Scientists: "yeah I could probably use that to explain the human condition"
For these flies, death is an infectious disease
What if the dead fly that got exposed to the living fly in this experiment have some unknown desease/virus that affect living fly that we don't know off?
Oh, *fruit flies.* I thought from the title that this might be relevant to my interests, perhaps revealing a way to deal with houseflies. Nope. Just FRUIT flies. =9[.]9=
Wait... Is the presenter male or female?? 🤔
Interesting. I did not know this about the flies.
The fruit flies in my house didn't get the memo I guess, they seem to see dead flies and start rapidly reproducing.
The flies still alive on the other half of the maze: Eh-eh, I ain't going over there near Dead-ass Dave, lord have mersay!
WHERE IS HANK?
Don't try this on ant or bees...
Weird how funreal directors don't age.
did the fly tell you this
figured out the secret I guess
This feels like an SCP video
That's why I'm vlad the impaler of the flies. I don't use bug spray or glue or any of that fancy stuff. I catch and impale dead flies on the needles to show their comrades they're not welcome here
The recommendation I didn’t know I needed
The more you see your friends, family and pets die. The more you want to feel death isn't so bad so you can meet them again
No, you didn't. "Time flies..." Anyway, I subscribed despite the pun
almost the same as some married women. sees her friends getting divorce, she does it too. lol.
Has anyone run the math to see if morticians die younger than other people?
What if they were aging faster when seeing dead flies because it was an evolutionary way to make them reach sexual maturity faster in order to breed replacements for the dead flies, and depression is used as motivation to seek immediate gratification in the animal kingdom?
I didn't even know fruit flies were social animals. That's so cool!
As much as I'd like to care....I'm still ripping the wings off of flies and feeding my adopted pet spider that lives in front of the corner cupboard....and made it's web in an angle so I can still open the cupboard, and not ruin its web 😇
I kill flies that can bite me, while other good ones that do not bite me are welcome. I like to have a few of them at a time in my house. They are really fun to observe.
B.S.   If this were true.  Then a single strip of fly paper, would get rid of every other fly in your house.
voy  a empezar a poner moscas muertas en mi ventana
it's the thumbnail for me.  😂❤
Bold of you to assume employers would give hazard pay when it’s needed
And how do we even know what flies are blind or unable to smell? This seems like several experiments and lots of dead stuff.
So what I’m hearing is how far their intelligence goes. They seem pretty smart. Maybe smarter than we know or could imagine.
Serotonin receptors being shut off? So they stop having empathy and therefore they don't care basically? Does that mean fly's have feelings/empathy?
I wonder if this works for images of flies. If not, I’d have to guess the dead flies are causing this in some other way.
1:03 so what your saying is we need a aerosol spray of dead fly stink?…
This is big cap 🧢
when i was in college, there was a lot of major construction next to our dorm so there were roaches being seen pretty often.  first one i saw in my room, i killed and taped it to the bottom of my door on a silly sign (so people would think i was slightly less crazy lol) because my thinking was if you saw a dead human affixed to a doorway, you might not be so keen to see what's behind that door or hang around for very long.  no one else did it--surely because it's a strange thing to do, but guess which was the *only* room that never had a roach in it again 😂🤷‍♂   i looked it up before writing this this comment to see why that might be and evidently the pheromones released after death are like a warning to others; roaches will eat another dead roach, but being on a door and covered in tape (i just didn't want to touch it tbh lol, did not consider they would eat themselves) meant they couldn't access it, so only the visual and olfactory signs, both of which proved to be effective deterrents, remained.  all those years, i never knew, just followed a hunch and it worked out--very cool to be learning all this stuff now, especially since i get periodically visited by fruit flies in the summer...
Flies when they see a dead fly:💀  Flies when they see any other dead creature: 😋🍴
almost like how adam and eve started aging when they saw the apple..  Religious anecdotes aside.  I swear, it wasn't until i became a parent that I felt like i started aging.   as crazy as it sounds, I have often wondered if our own bodies rely on physical, and visual queues to transition into the next phase of life.  I'm not saying, we could live forever if we didn't.  But, perhaps, theres something to it.   It can also be said that 2 married people will live longer than 1 single person, because of love and care they give.  So theres more to it for sure, but it is strange indeed.
i wish they would just die they never do
I wish they did, I keep all the dead flies in my room and still keep coming in and not dying
Im pretty sure this vid was on despetate measures to put out.
Imagine a whole colony just dying after one dies...
It’s not mysterious, everyone. The flies clearly failed their sanity checks so miserably that they were rendered instantly dead.
It might be a way of clearing the area of flies in a possibly dangerous area.
If it comes out that depression causes aging symptoms to occur faster Imma be in a casket by 40 😭😭😭😭
I thought the reason for this weird automatic Death affect is to fight against fly traps, instead  of waiting or eating the dead (others flies if they cant eat bug meat) they die fast enough to Clough the trap so other flies wont get traped and trap will be unusable.
I always had this video pop up in my recommendations, but I've never watched because I was like, "No, that does not happen, what you mean?" But I just experienced this phenomenon and it's pretty interesting to see, so here I am
Who says we dont also age faster when seeing dead people we knew? Have ae studied it? And maybe the flies do feel some level of sadness and we do know that stress and depression has an effect on our aging, or at least visually since it's hard to tell if someone would normally have died at 80 or lived to 100 if they didnt watch more loved ones pass on.
FOX.....DIE
So... No open casket?
Nice video, I subscribe!
The same thing happens in retirement homes.
Thanks pat
Okay so this actually makes a lot of sense to me now. At work we have an issue with flies right now because it's just that time of year where they will do anything but stay outside where they belong, and whenever I'm working at the front counter, I always notice flies dead on the counter. And then I'll come back and I'll find another one, and another one, right next to each other, and sometimes I wondered if we had some sort of bug zapper or something above the counter that I wasn't aware of. But yeah slay honestly
is it possible that this trait evolved to protect a foodsource from being used up during an emergency, saving the foodsource to be used by potentially healthier flies when the danger has passed?
Is this why I subconsciously leave fly corpses to rot? I thought I was just larping as Vlad the impaler but for insects. Still remember one day being totally blindsided when a daddy long legs came up and started eating the corpse of a spider I'd killed on the picnic table beside me. From that day on, an alliance was formed.
Mammal predators, like wolves, don't keep deer populations down just by eating them. The greater effect is from the stress created by the need for constant vigilance, which reduces the birthrate of the deer herds. I imagine something similar is going on with fruit flies. Sensing other flies dead leads to greater vigilance. Just last week I saw a dead one in a soap and vinigar trap we made. Another fly walked down to examine it, and when it got about a couple of millimeters of the corpse, it turned around and RAN back to the top of the bowl-trap. lol
My dad once killed a horse fly and put it on his head, "as a warning to the others." I never knew he was on to something! 😂
I'll keep this information in mind to stay away from dead people
LMAOOOO this can’t be real!🤣
Reminds me of what Kodak said in that one interview 💯
I need to collect dead flies bodies, so no flies alive after they enter my house 😁
Like everyone else said I had no idea that flies die when seeing their friends dead 😂😂😂 I learn something new everyday
Now I can kill the Fly that keeps me up at night
Funeral directors *don't* get hazard pay?!
The fly world exists using fly magic. All flying creatures have flying magic. Humans lack flying magic but hold building magic to a very high degree. When a fly sees a dead fly they are afflicted by the fly world inherent Curse of May-day and that is why their lifespans are affected. Thank you for coming to my RedTalk
I love you
I would love to know who noticed that fruit flies die around other fruit flies and then decided to do a whole study about it. 😂
They/Them. Commiserations.
Is IT similiar to... structure of your cells while DYING? Like IT sends signal IT Is dead And other cells start dying? (I know IT sounds ridicullouse buuuuut maybeeeee? 🤣)
Is that Andy Milonakis? This is so random wth
Does this work on all flies, specifically house flies?
omg… flies get stressed?
I would also pass sooner if Aliens kept showing me dead relatives
"Time flies". You didn't finish your line: Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana. :)
this explains why my fly cultures die off so quickly
"Hosted by: Savannah Geary (they/them)" - I wish the they/thems were more like fruit flies 😆🤣
I dunno about the aging thing,  but i do know that one dead fruit fly always splits into two live fruit flies.... oh, believe me,  i know.. 😂
This is stupid. We live in an idiocracy.
Note to self: don't vaccum the windowsill anymore
I would hang them on hooks around the house now
I wish our fruit flies died like this. Fruit fly traps here are more like breeding pits upon their parents' corpses that just spawn more flies
Fish respond to stress hormones in the water; maybe flies are reacting to this in each other? Or 'corpse stank' generates a lot of stress hormones in the living? It makes sense for any living creature - we really do suffer by proxy.
Guess I didn't know flies died after seeing dead flies before watching this video.
Its time to put the bodies of flies on toothpicks around my home like medieval days
"if all your friends jumped off a cliff would you?" flies af:
Sounds like Quantum Entanglement to me.
I will line my apartment with the heads of fallen flies. Abandon all hope ye who enter here.
Brb while I make a little toothpick fence with dead flies skewered on it as a warning
Im gonna clap the flies cheeks more now >:>
So what is the life expectancy of a mortician vs people who don’t hang around dead people?
I work in a lab where I rear fruit flies and didn’t know this lol
Just imagine killing a hundred flies and placing them in different spots in thr house and end up with different piles of flies who decided its time
So I’m a multi tour combat veteran who became a successful criminal and then a vigilante against human trafficking. I look probably 10 years younger than I actually am. That kinda throws a monkey wrench in your hypothesis. In case it’s not obvious I’ve seen and caused a lot of death.  I’m spry as can be.
Admit it. You clicked here because you were puzzled by the thumbnail.  You did not know that either.
Rosie O'Donnell sure does love talking about flies. 😂
I had no idea Q from Impractical Jokers was this in to science. 😂
Good to see Andy Milonakis finally found a new gig
Oh no! John's dead! *Starts to rapidly age*
This was a great video
In other words; Beware: "You are who you hang with."
So I have one of those bag that smells like poop to attract flies and kill them. I still have plenty of flies in my backyard and the bag is almost full.
Dogs and cats can perceive it as well. Let them see the body of their familiar. They understand death. Don’t let them think they were abandoned.
I massively respect SciShow for crediting photographers. A lot of other channels cut corners but SciShow is different 💛
im sorry but i dont think this is true, it makes no sense. i do think that scientists sometimes need to justify their funding, especially when they are studying useless stuff. this kind of meaningless findings are a cool catchy bait that academics can use to continue some random studies and remain paid and employed scientists i guess...
Human males tend to die shortly after their female partners die. But human females do not and live much longer lives after their male partners die. I wonder if there is a biological connection to that similar to the fruit flies. Do male fruit flies die earlier than the females around dead flies or is there no difference?
Video is a load of bs.
So can I buy dead flies to leave around the house to keep living flies away
youve heard of the beach that makes you old, now get ready for....
I wish we could just show an annoying fly buzzing around a picture, and it would drop dead.
ive been a  professional house fly killer since a very young age its been a source of satisfaction for me for many years, im very skilled at shooting rubber bands and worked in kitchens which resulted in hours of practice- i am the bane of flies, i am their grim reaper.  i will hunt them down without mercy.  a rubber band can be set for stun, and a bic lighter will singe their wings so they are reduced to the status of a "walk" and the ants finish off the execution-  houseflies will eveacuate an area and stop pestering humans when they discover multiple dead, ant covered, wounded flies near each other, examining their former mates of flight as fresh kills wards off those remaining.  they even seem to do wellness check on the wounded, when they witness a pile up of fresh dead and wounded flies the rest will soon go into hiding.  my weapons of choice are the rubber band or a salt shotgun but i can also do the job without any tools- a fly always lifts off in reverse before shifiting to forward gear so you aim clapped hands above them.  as for the fruit fly the weapon of choice is a can of aqua net and a lighter- if rapid aging dont kill them the intense fireball will but they simply succumb to a toxic dish of soap water and apple cider vinegar.  a fun fact about the houselfy is it can often times be "revived" with table salt.  after 42 minutes the dead fly can no longer be revived, but before 42 minutes the dead flies nervous system can be jump started by covering the fly in table salt, if its physical structure is not beyond damage- a drowned fly is easiest to revive before 42 minutes but a broken one can be revived sometimes also.  if a headshot is scored with rubber band a decapitated fly will continue to make some flights with crash landings.
There are blind flies? Well now I'm gonna feel a little worse when I kill them.
Best viewed from the perspective of evolution. We develop so that we avoid things which are bad for us. This means that our body may actively start killing us if we hang around bad things,  so that we don't reproduce and pass this behaviour on.
If i was exposed to fresh corpses all the time, i think i would age faster too
What if you exposed dead flies to living flies, and they came back to life?
Click off as soon as I saw the dysgenic whale on screen. 🤮
Flies aging rapidly upon seeing their dead relatives, reminds me a lot of the time that in old cartoons, the character in question gets so traumatized with what they’ve experienced, that they aged up rapidly into an elderly, and are dry as a prune, and nearly reduced to just skin, and bones. XD     *_Maybe it is a good idea to leave the fly corpses on my windowsills to leave a message for any more of those flying intruders to not invade my house without my consent._*
So I should leave dead flies around to kill the other flies
Let me put this in human terms: Let's say you come across a table, full of food... ...BUT full of dead people around it. All keeled off their chairs. Would you eat off that table? Hell no, I'd say!
"Time flies."  I threw my pen.
Thanks for the tip, now I'll keep the flies' dead bodies 💀
haven’t watched the video yet, but my theory is that it’s like FoMO is peer pressure or something along those lines
It just amazes with all the things we DO know about science and biology ...the facy that theres so many things out there thay we dont know or understand the causes of is crazy
Well i swear the fruit flies in my house didnt get this message lol
5:50 Archers hate time flies. They mess up arrows.
To me it just sounds like the flies that see dead flies just get stressed the hell out. And too much stress can make anything's lifespan shorter, makes sense it would to a fly too.
Of course we don't research when when other animals feel depression like symptoms, because who / what could ever feel like us?
This is accurate because when I see vegans come close to me I wanna die
Because they're heart broken 💔 ☠️
Free will is definitely an illusion
Well thats weird. You cant eat a double dead meat also! ...  Another mystery,
i love this woman type person. she is so good at explaining things with meaning and enthusiasm.   this thing about fruit flies is fascinating. dogs also seem to have some similar goings on when their human friend dies. q without being macabre, is there some linkage for humans when a life partner or other very close loved one is gone?  (asking from my own feelings.) 🌷🪻🌱
Guess I'll start catching them, impale them and leave them on toothpicks as warnings for other flies.  Zahk the Impaler
Sadly just like humans elephants will return to the exact spot where their dead loved one died, for years. So they must feel love.
fly depression was not something I thought I'd be learning about today
They/ them
Humans should do the same
If fruit flies live for 40-50 days being surrounded by dead friends for two days is like a human's being surrounded by their dead friends for 2-4 years   It sounds like they're just putting these flies through war like conditions and then wondering why the stress causes them to die faster
Even though I'm a bug myself i usually hate files... But now i feel bad about it
Id be very interested to know if theres an evolutionary function to this. Is it more advantageous for the flies to die off en mass once something starts killing them individually? Could it help deter active predation by removing live prey and leaving only food for carrion eaters?   The aside about how flies live shorter lives when they have food vs when they dont could mean they prioritize resources for their young by culling the older generations faster when food is secure. Could dying when they see other dead serve a similar function?  If you could isolate why this happens and shut it off you could test populations of flies with it off vs on  to see if having this trait actually increases the fitness of the whole, or if its just a random mutation that doesnt negatively affect them enough to be selected against.
My takeaway from this video: Leave dead flies in plain sight instead of throwing them away.
So we should put fly heads on toothpicks as a warning to the others.
I always think it's silly when people say animals don't understand death, when my cats friend died we showed him what happened and he understood that. he definitely grieved, the next couple days he constantly needed people. glad to know that's a science thing because that's always annoyed me
These actually make me feel better about being too lazy to replace my sticky traps more often.  Trying to control the fruit flies in my house plants.
I have alot of neocardinal shrimps when one of them die they eat it. They are very sensity creatures and one water change leed to alot of them simply die :( . But pupulation rebound quickly
research irrelevent and false . I dont belive it
Neat
So I might live longer since I've done a crap load of MDMA/serotonin back in my day but just need to eat less? 😂
The main thing this helped with is how to kill fruit flies.   It has been forever & I can't remember the exact directions, but it basically  1) some $3 buck Chuck wine poured into some tupperware  2) cover it with some plastic cling wrap & wrap a rubber band around the edges of the cling wrap so it makes a seal. 3) poke little holes in the top of the middle of the cling wrap. The flies come in, get drunk & cant get out.  The extra important part, I guess, is to clean out the dead flies as much as you can. Cuz I used to just leave them in it when it had worked, but I'd had times were it worked at first, but then days they'd later would land on it & then fly away.  If the fruit flies avoid their dead, that means just clear the trap, cuz when it works, it can get dozens. In a day or two. Way better than a yellow strip.
My aging process is accelerated once I try to go into the toilet after my dad used it
you'd think they'd be curious about how these things affect the FLIES too. And I am sure they are, but you wouldn't know it listening  this presenter talk about this research.
Verifiably not true
Are you a boy?
"Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like banana." - Zilean, LoL
So I shouldn't remove the bodies of dead flies 😂
How do you explain that flies are still attracted to fly traps that clearly have already dead flies on them?
this kind of implies that even simple creatures like flies have complex internal lives.
I’m not sure why this showed up on my feed but I’m glad it did actually because it was pretty interesting.
Its awful what scientists do to animals. How do they live with themselves? Just say "im not a fly so it doesnt matter what I subject them to"??
It's Pat lol
I always knew their was a reason i left dead flies around for a little bit to scare its brethren 😂
I wonder if its because the fly has a massive stress attack cause they have an extremely fast heartbeat and live for a day.
this is like a similar thing to when you scare your parents or someone of that sort they'll say "you're turning my hair grey".
Not the flies that get in my house!!! It seems like it takes them forever to die on their own and when I set out traps for them and some get caught and eventually die, the other ones still alive stay that way until they die naturally. If this actually worked, I'd have no problem getting rid of the flies I get.
Time flies like an arrow and fruit flies like a banana.
They kill binds
Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.
Is that male or female very confusing
30% shorter lifespan isn't the same as dropping dead, this is clickbait
OKAY and now can we cover why Kulning and trumpets bring the cows home
how wold this benefit the flies? if it even does.
bro that thumbnail looked like a creepy poodle 😅
This is like the movie "BIRDBOX".
Imagine like your friend dies and your just like “f***! He’s gone… guess I’ll go die then” 😂😂😂
Man all the turtles need to do was show Stockman a dead fly and they'd of saved Splinter.  That's a dnd solution if ever I saw one.
So what you're saying is, if you kill a fruit fly, leave it there a warning to the next ten generations that some foods come with too high a price.
Goddamn I can't tell if it's a woman or a highschool boy 😆💀
This gives me an idea…
Glad to know that I was causing these bastards with wings so much psychological stress by leaving their dead corpses behind. I hate fruit flies.
Pat, it's great to see you doing well after all these years.  https://youtu.be/OQ39LCzqpFQ?si=mMq3XlxwhXcsK-QO
All the dead flies at the bottom of my trash can must look like a hellish landscape to them.
These studies are in fact directly relevant to humans ⚛️⚛️⚛️
Thanks I’m gonna tape 10 dead flies outside my backyard
Guess ill die meme comes to life
You mean I just have to kill ONE and out it in a place they all pass by???
Good to see Brian from Impractical Jokers getting side gigs 👍
hell yeah a fellow they/them person as a host!
Accumulation into exchanging and repositioning of energy on atomic with subatomic and dimensional levels, basically. 🎉
I actually never knew that
I need to kill more flies so other flies will get depressed & kill themselves...
So flies can be depressed, We learn something everyday don’t we
Apparently, since my childhood whenever I killed a mosquito, fly or any bug and even a lizard ..... I'll leave their bodies near window or door. My parents never liked this, even when told to through it out, I'll simply place it in lawn (still in my home) ...... the reason was to give message that you creatures are not welcome here. Now with this video, I'm glad that it was not just my imagination but it actually works ! 😁👍
They do? Flies here just multiply around me.
Flies take the "I cant live without you" to the next level.
So if i want to get rid of flies is to have died flies laying around. Heard
This explains why I found a team of dead flies on a window sill… it was a bit weird
Can anyone explain how this came about evolution-wise? It seems anti-natural selection to evolve a trait that actively kills you.
Im assuming the flies can't be crushed for this, or do they recognize this too?
I just think it is impressive we are able to map the brains of fruit-flies.
im gonna crucify a fly over my front door to keep those fuckers out
Is that guy a man or a woman???
Flies do  W H A T
My biggest takeaway is that some insects have shorter lives when thriving. Kinda the opposite of any biological programming ive been aware of.
Phenomenal presentation and presenter. Great voice and straight to the point. Awesome info!
nice information, ma'am
Could be a bacteria or fungus that flies carry, which grows unimpeded once the flies die. When living flies are exposed to it in abundance from dead flies, perhaps it overwhelms their immune systems
Thanks, I’m not cleaning up the flies I kill anymore so I won’t have to deal with new flies
Here I thought it was peer pressure..
(in the voice of Matt Berry) "Theres two of them now!"
I feel like that conclusion is a bit of a stretch... I think to determine that death itself is the catalyst, you would have to compare their reaction to death specifically to their reaction to other stressors - basically, what forms of torture are most effective on flies. Not that I'm suggesting a fly torture study, but I also wouldn't suggest locking an animal up with its dead brethren, so... Scientists, man.
Time flies like to eat arrows.
Couldn't it be stress, not much depression?  Like "oh no, dead flies, I need to get out of here FAST" raising heart rate and stress.
My linode connection keeps dropping packages like 60% package loss for my isp it has issues with some isps
this sounds like sci-show got paid haaaard to support some seratponin receptor theory by believeing themselves in the 77% as long "fact" which probably was measured on 3 flied. depression in flies. sure. it does raise spome questions... lol the only questions it raises is about the original research
i don't wanna be offensive but she looks kind of gender neutral
I mean, I've heard plenty of stories of both humans and animals alike dying shortly after a 'loved one' has. So.. I can see a linkage in this.
0:28 I cannot stress how perfect this delivery is
I’m watching this video at 11:26 pm what am I doing with my life 😅
Why do you always get the least attractive possible hosts?! They are so unattractive that it is distracting.
HEYYYY!! WE NEED TO DECORATE THE HOUSE WITH FLY CORPSES WHEN FLIES INVADE
Maybe your point about flies is correct, but your small excursion into bees ruined it for me. I read the source on your claim about bees.   It claims (as far as i understood, english being my second language) that the lifespan of workers pre-wintering (in autumn) is linked with the pheromone produced by the brood (workers) which changes the adult workers eating behaviour thus leading to a shortened lifespan. Resulting in possible colony death during winter (actual problem)  They also seem to say that they only look at one factor influencing livespan and what hat means during wintering and not the "traditional" metabolic aspect.   Which is in general the main driver between the stark difference between a livespan of 3-6 and 20 weeks.   I think you might have missunderstood this.   Summer bees live shorter lives (3-6 weeks) as they are constantly flying around collecting ressources and thus wearing their bodies out until they collapse from exhaustion.   Winter bees on the other hand live to around 20 weeks. They are far less active and nurse the brood and eat what they have in storage from summer, thus they live far longer lifes.  The study in your description talks about their livespan and how the presence of brood (workers, not princesses) influences their life expectency and colony survival during winter as a result.   To me it kinda looks like you saw the titel of the paper,  skimmed it thought it talked about queen brood and then looked up how long bees life, saw the difference in age and attributed it to pheromones,  even if the papers just talked about a slight difference within the life expectency of winter bees due to the presence of brood pheromones causing a change in eating behaviour.   (As far as i understood...please correct me if i didn't understand the paper correctly. Its hard to read scientific papers in a foreign language at 3am)
should be titled _"Did you know?"_ instead of _"Why?"_ 😂😂😂
Oh look PAT from Saturday night live is on youtube….
As Michael Rosen would say: The weak ones just used to keel over and die
So, insects have feelings, and are more similar to us than meets the eye. Thanks for confirming to me that I should be kind to them. I always am. I help them when stuck, even feed fatigued bees and wasps.
We out here stress-aging flies :(
So I hate flies. Always rubbing their little paws right Infront of me, thinking about their little schemes to annoy me. The other day they took it to the next level. Fornicating right in front of me and a third one watching. Smashed them, the male was dead. The female just flew to the other male who was watching and started again with the other one after 1 second. Two conclusions:  1: Flies have no moral integrity. 2: I need to clean
Im not sure what to feel about this.... I've killed so many flies, to think they were sentient just hinged me a little bit...
I love how we can endlessly explain and test stuff like this but the actual question of "why" always remains a mystery.
Not watching this because the host is so unlikable. Find better people.
Thats not true at all about bees. Bees live longer in the winter because they do not go and work daily wearing out the bee body.
Flys are really alive brain go boom
Couldnt it be something as simple as the chemicals released by the dead bodies affect the insects negatively and shortens their lifespan though- I know I'd definitely not feel well if I smelled what comes off a fellow humans corpse for days. I vote retry tests with the corpses visible but seperate from the flies so it cant be a factor- You compared it to pheramones from a bee which isnt emotional at all, its chemicals- If they were somehow near that particular bee without being exposed to those chemicals they wouldnt die as such-  There is a such thing as biased confirmation, you see something seemingly confirm what you want to hear so you dont accept the truth that its not actually related in the slightest -
Omg...I'm not...as crazy.  I have found that if  I leave a bug or fly corpse alone...it will ward off others of it kind.  It works for spiders too.  I noticed it as a kid thinking they recognized  this as a place of death.
Time to hang dead flies from my window as a warning.
I just wanted to learn a cool fact but this video is quite literally intolerable 💀💀💀💀💀💀
It does happen in some humans
Good, I can’t wait to test this out
Nah they got so many eyes so they can see higher dimensional animals, not all of them are friendly. Some of them don’t like fruit flies.
I've known of some friends' family members who died when seeing their dead relatives (they were old and had a heart attack upon encountering the body)
dont wanna be rude or anything but I feel like the voice doesnt match the body  would someone tell me if It's a male or female
Yes, that is their mindset it seems 😂
dogshit title.
so we don't know, dope
I geuss they regonize the bodies in the water
Ok I guess I should crucify the flies
Time to put a trap with dead fly inside my house.
I wish flies were extinct
Amazing thumbnail
Death by emotional damage. :(
1 word: evolution. Places flies die less, flies die less. And vice versa. It helps kill flies where death occurs more, hence survivors will survive more where they can best. You know, Nature... Kinda works the same for us too. We have better chacnes reproducing where we don't have too much death and depression. easy math. It's basically not a natural "law" rather than just simple math.
The presentator looks like a lesbian and nonbinary version of meg from family guy 😂😂😂
I gotta kill a fly and keep it some where so flies in my house will die
Are you also the channel a little bit better?
THEY WHAT????!
So we're using PTSD to kill flies. Huh.
Ok, new plan. Leave a dead fly on the counter to kill all the rest.
Grief ages you. This tracks
Is this a guy or a girl?
Is it weird how fruit flies die after seeing a dead relative?
After seeing this title the other day, I was able to kill a fruit fly on my counter.  I left it there.  None keeled over to join it, even after several days.  🤷🏻‍♀️  However, I am most successful at killing fruit flies after they wander into the fridge when I open it.  So, that makes me happy.  Lol
Time flies, unlike the flies that see their dead brethren
Wha!  The Birdbox was real!  a fly
So they dont die when they see dead flies, their lifespan is shorter when repeadly exposed to dead flies over their lifetime. Come on guys do better with your video titles.
Amazing how they lack conscience of self and the finite of life, but chemically perceive the concept of death
So it's NOT due to peer pressure?
I wonder if seeing dead flies increases their metabolism (so they can more quickly react to dangerous stimuli), thereby simply reducing their lifespan as a consequence
I hope this also applies to cockroaches. Too bad they're too resilient. Can even survive a nuclear attack.
Lesson learned. Will scatter fruit fly corpses all around my apartment and enjoy more fruits than ever.  (there are currently three corpses on my carnivorous plant so maybe that suffices)
I will hang dead flies on a string now
20 seconds in… realizing presenter is a liberal. Stopped watching.
why do we need a them they looking wamen to voice these things?
No flies and humans don't grieve the same. They obviously grieve far deeper. 😢 we shouldn't be so arrogant as to assume we're the species that can feel the deepest.
So if i want to get rid of flies i just have to crucify a fly to the wall and they will all die?
TF2 moment
I work in a bar and spring is coming up which means we're going to get a bad bar fly problem. Bar flies being fruit flies. I might collect the few I manage to kill and test this information out.
So all i have to do is impale a fly and put it in front of other flies and win?
I think this is a process that makes puts the fruit flys into an optimal state so that they can better think and better assess their situation so that they may escape it.  Which taxes their body heavily so they die faster.  I don't think this has anything to do with depression in the traditional sense, but depression does kinda do exactly that as well, it makes you focus hard and stress the importance of finding a solution to your life problems, and the stress of doing so is very taxing on the body
What about people throwing up when they see someone else throwing up?😂
Bro is getting 10 assists after doing 3 kills
Elephants will "Trump it?" Now I understand why they're the symbol of the GOP. I used to like elephants.
Never cleaning dead flies away anymore, hopefully I cause a genocide.
Why am I still seeing multiple flies still?!
use the fly to beat the fly  Also we should might ad well collect dead flies and lay them out cartel style to warn others off and to kill them on sight
... they do what.
This is a pretty dubious video, too hyperbolic.
Is no one going to talk about the thumbnail?💀
So, hypothetically, if I impaled a fruit fly on a toothpick and put it on my fruits like a head on a stake it would protect the fruits?
I have never seen this happening and I have a bunch of flies on sticky traps but the living flies seem to be doing fine.
It would make more sense that this was instead a case of the fly's metabolism speeding up when they see the dead to increase chances of short term survival. Expend more energy now to get away from what maybe killed your kin. Better to survive the day than survive the week.  That makes more sense because it has a clear evolutionary advantage. Sort of like how stress makes you more observant but too much of it can strip years off your life.  Also i think the title of this video is clickbaity.
Wtf is this homunculus speaking. Either very weird woman or a man without balls.
it's anthropomorphising a bit so should be treated with scepticism but to me it seems like this response is similar to stress. prolonged stress is detrimental to all animals health, and I think being repeatedly exposed to corpses of your species is probably a great way to generate stress in basically any species. insect psychology is of course pretty unknown so this is pretty heavily conjecture, but it feels like a reasonable guess for why this behaviour occurs. Most mammals and humans would probably not want to hang out with dead bodies, and if they were forced to, I imagine their lifespans would drop, even ignoring potential for disease.  Mortifcians and funeral directors as mentioned in the video are less likely to be stressed out by dead bodies because they know they aren't in danger, and eventually it becomes normal day to day. That and people working in the funeral industry generally self select to be members of the population less squeamish with the dead.
I’ve never felt so bad for flies before…
they just pulled a tf2
Why would this trait evolve into being?
It's God's way of telling us they're from hell
Can we do the same to mosquito?  Will it have same effect?
How would they know what they look like?
💀🪰
Why do i think this is a far  stretch from what the researchers did?
Yeahhhh this isn't true. Just get a fly trap and leave it
Random fly: *sees a dead fly* Also random fly: “I guess I'll have to pass away to”
Empathy at its most ridiculous level.
If we could invent an electric fly fence, what would happen to all the houseflies? Would they go extinct or evolve to avoid the fence?
Oh I think funeral directors would get shorter life spans if their job was about their family members. I don't get why it's so important to define other species' beings as "not like humans"; animals don't have emotions, animals don't think, animals don't reason, fruit flies don't get depressed like humans - All assumed as general knowledge from history till now. How important is it really? Similar brain function fluctuations between humans and fruit flies when 'brethren' die about them I'd guess. And differences between you and me as well.
time to cover my house in dead flies!
Now if only the house flies in my walmart break room would do the same thin!  🤦‍♀️
Granny? Mama! Papa! 🪰!💥!💀
Okay i’m going to star leavin dead flys around the house so other flys oof themselves
There was at least one scientist who had to blind and deafen flies for 6 hours straight to make this paper.
it's called speedrunning!
Kill lots of flies and put them up on tooth picks, like heads on pikes to ward off the flys
im gonna start leaving fly carcasses around my house, thank you!
So that’s why there are so many flies on my window sill
I wonder if there's an evolutionary advantage to the "guess I'll die" response
are you saying my depression will make me live longer bc my serotonin receptors don't work 🥺
Isn't this dude Pat from SNL?
Sometimes you say they "drop dead" or otherwise imply they die very rapidly, sometimes it's about shortening the lifespan to 77%... which is it? I'm confused
I used the flies to destroy the flies
Let’s be real. None of us looked this up 😂
Interesting research. Thank you for sharing.
Could be an evolutionary survival response, drop in appetite and fat deposits would in my opinion be a defense against toxins or disease, perhaps a further experiment would be to see if the age of the dead flies has an effect on the response, as dead young flies would indicate something is amiss, and trigger defenses against most likely, fat soluble toxins. I’d also like to see if this is a phenomenon unique to the western fruit flies, as insects are known for rapidly gaining resistance to pesticides, which these physiological changes would certainly help against.
I don’t necessarily agree that depression for fruit flies and humans is not the same but  It would make sense that if you kept seeing a dead person over and over again for like what seems to be forever  you would probably think its over there is no way out im gonna die. Therefore making your mind trick yourself that you will die sooner than later. And then your brain can prepare the body to do so. Not as quickly as flies thou since flies are a lot more simpler than a human but i can see depression if you have it for years like 2-3 years it probably takes away 4-6 yrs of your life or some certain amount. Fruit flies lives are that much shorter.
How convenient
When did Andy Milanonkis get a sceience degree?
So what I'm hearing is to just keep some dead flies around as an anti-fly system.  Got it
They age quicker? That's pretty crazy
Keepers know.
This is first time seeing this channel. Really cool and informative video. I like to learn new things everyday! Definitely subscribed!
Omg the intro where they talk about grieving I thought they said breathing the first time
So you're saying an effigy is scientifically sound in killing flies.
I can have a literal "battle field" of dead flies I've killed and I've seen no flies drop dead when they fly by or later...it seemed like more appear!
They don't
Every time I squish a fly, I compulsively say “tell your friends.” Pleased to learn that it’s actually been purposeful.
That seems like a stupid comparison. They speed up their metabolism. It's evolutionary adaption. Presence of death signals danger so doing essential things faster including reproduction makes sense
But they didn’t actually test for emotions, so we don’t really know if they are or are not sad.
When we get fruit flies, I know it is a *lot* of work but this confirms that all of the time I've spent catching flies and putting their little heads on tiny little pikes as a warning to others was time well-spent
Stressing out flies so they age faster is peak science
This is honestly the most devastating news I've heard all day
It's pat
i guess i need to leave dead flies in my house now
*Shut up Meg.*
I was hoping this video would validate me leaving dead flies all around the house, but I guess I was mistaken.
I’m guessing they’re dropping like flies heheh. I’ll go home.
So to get rid of fruit flies, you send them a message and leave a body? Time to experiment! 😂
War on fruit flies? They fuckin sicken me 😂 little creeps
Hey you've missed the point.  Depression is nature's way of keeping you alive by preventing you from wasting energy on fruitless endeavors.  It's also nature's way of keeping you at home, where your kith and kin are more likely to be.  Depression is an evolutionary adaptation, it's a life force, not a death force!
The void calls to the living. The living recoil from its gaze. Stress takes a toll and hastens their journey to it's clutches. Greet your end with levity, a smile, a laugh. For there is nothing left to do when death haunts your steps but face it and greet it as an old friend.
They die from depression.
Wait, is this why the massive fruit fly issue I had in my house suddenly dropped and eventually disappeared? I had a sticky fly trap strip hanging around. Caught a lot of gnats and some fruit flies. But I noticed a lot of the fruit flies suddenly disappeared in only a couple of days. Even though it was mostly gnats that were on that trap.
Smell that takes life away
My theory is that it's an evolution thing where they die off in areas where others died in order to prevent spreading to those areas as they would potentially be unsafe for their young.  The same reason they live longer when they don't have a food source, because they need to find a suitable area with food to make babies, and they then die off faster once there is food so they aren't  competing with the newer, more fertile generations.
The definition of “same”😂😂😂
The flies become stressed thinking something in the area is possibly killing them like it did their deceased cousin, become depressed and die too. 😢
I think it has to do with adaption: there were experiments that showed people working with the elderly became slower over time maybe subconsciously imitating or adapting to old people's behaviour
But do we die faster when we see dead flies more?
Guess im taping dead flies around my house
meme thumbnails      ☕
I mean if I was seeing death everywhere I'd be on edge, battle-ready, looking for threats, ✨️STRESSED✨️, and my new grey hairs would suggest I'm aging faster, too.
Xe/Xim lookin' ass
You got me thinking about the files in my kitchen on some DreamWorks level now.
Flies start dying of stress when they realize they're not immortal
So all I had to do was just kill a few fruit flies and place them around my house to kill the rest?
It's too much sadness for such a small creature that it kills it. 🥺
Why do we have to share DNA with flies...
Heart attack
so... instead of getting an exterminator and wasting money.. i could have just put a dead fruit fly on the floor?
I'm glad we humans don't do this! 😂😂
Never knew this
So all i have to do is kill one fruit fly
So a flypaper serves two functions. Not only does it catch flies, but if any of them are fruit flies, it creates a voodoo effect on the rest of the population. Nice!
Been stabbed scarrs blooded my experience
That's what happens when you look into pandoras box
Yes, there's no evidence this is true in humans. People who take a bath in the specter of human death show no mortality rates different from people who see little death. Soldiers and morticians are examples. Those who ran the death camps during WW2 usually lived long lives if they didn't get a death sentence after the war.
They do? Dang
I mean, why wouldnt you! If YOU saw a dead corpse when you want into a room,  you too, would drop dead when you saw your fallen compadre just lying there dead, wouldnt you? (This is a joke)
When they see other dead flies it means there isnt much resources so they die so that the younger flies will have less competition for food
I've got flightless fruit flies so I will do a little experiment to see if that's true.🤔
damn could u imagine if that happened to us? we wouldnt even host funerals. and accidents would be so dangerous. also killing someone would be a double-edged sword.
So is there a scientific name for this effect? That has to have a name.
I was today years old
It's Pam
it's Pat
Crickets also due when nest other dead ones I've noticed wh3n Feeding my leopard gecko, is it for the same reason?
The older i get, the stupider the sentiment that were going to learn about us by studying animals gets. We're going to learn about depression from flies now are we? Itl be the same year we learn to stop aging thanks to jellyfish .
one to kill them all
I dont know. Alot of men and women have died from grief. Many die slow.
"It's all about sending a message"
Fantastically interesting information, and very well presented! Thanks!
I think the flies took "if you die i die with you" a little to much
Could be a means of reducing a pesky fly population on your porch, etc: a few small saucers or snap lids with bunches of dead flies on them on about (in a manner that won't be a hassle to the humans).
It's Pat.
So what you're saying is .. I should leave the fruitfly corpses out to get rid of the rest of them?
Next video tip? How do you shut down Neurons on a fruitfly? Seriously I think the smallest needle still looks like a tunnel they could fly through, so what kind of media can shut down the neurons so they do not take in serotonin?
They WHAT? *makes a graveyard of flies*
Funny thumbnail got me clicking.
They do ot out of solidarity.  Now I have to hang up pictures of ded flies all around my home, perfect lifehack.
Not true at all. I’ve seen flies land beside and even on a dead fly and eat it
This made video made me fart with laughter
This is the first time I heard of this,and though I may be wrong it seems similar to human mass hysteria.Or otherwise it could be just a natural reaction in their body.once again sorry I don’t have a lot of knowledge in animals
So repeated exposure across their entire lives led to somewhat reduced life expentancy. Almost the same as "keeling over" when they see a dead relative. Almost.
So evolutionary, they learned to avoid places with a lot of dead flies because they know instinctively? That's so smart
•Aside from a blind fly which normal people would most probably be able to tell, just how they know such things always amazes me so much. Man! These scientists and their studies/discovery🤯.
Why can't mosquito die when they see me kill them
Exact reason why I don’t like to hurt pests, no matter how disgusting they are.
A fly seeing another dead fly: aiight I'mma head out.
So basically TF2 players when they see someone killbind?
Ima start exhibiting dead flies in tiny caskets around the house as a fly deterrent
Uhhh there's plenty fruit flies in my garden shed from mouldy cardboard and they die every 2 seconds but the ones that are living don't look at them and say guess imma die so I just disproved the theory right there 😂
good. I hope they all die lol
So technically, they get depression?
Aight I shall slaughter flies now
Ever day we come closer to making that sweet sweet drug that makes you feel nothing, from that movie 'Equilibrium'.
nice
Cockroaches seem to do this too
At the beginning of the video I genuinely thought she said "breathing" instead of "grieving" and I had to replay it like three times because I was so confused because I had no idea what she was talking about. Finally I just turned on subtitles and was like "OHHHHH that makes a lot more sense"
Fly flying around and sees died fly*  Fly: “My time has come” *dies*
3:19
Who in the world took the time to think of and observe this?😂
Fly, you fools!
I just loved this video and how it was presented. Thank you ❤
Turn this into bug spray
There has never been a time I killed one and didn't have to kill the other 10...
Half way through this, I literally feel like my life expectancy has dropped by 65%
This basically what happens in tf2 when someone killbind in front of many players.
How can flies have empathy, when humans fail to.  Made respect to the fruit flies.
even among us humans, long standing spouses *DO DIE* soon after they see dead body of their partner 😢
I'm going to start putting up effigies of dead flies around the outside of my house.
A fly, depressed 💀
Did not even know flies are self aware let alone can get depressed seeing deaths of their fellow flies. Very interesting!
Sounds like stress increased metabolism in the fear of death. If you have no communicable situational awareness and you walked into a room filled with corpses, your heart would be moving at a million miles an hour trying to figure out if you're going to die in the next 3 seconds and from what.
Maybe they were HSP flies. Yes, search for HSP.
when will I GET "Dead Fly" De Odorant, body wash, and Calone, could work for bar flies?
Give it to humain to successfully give depression to flys...
It’s so good you added they/them to the description. How would otherwise we know how to talk to her?
Well, I know what MY next home makeover is going to be!
chemical imbalance model of psychiatric disorders has been debunked. Seratonin is not the mechanism.
Now, nobody can deny that depression can kill ! 😂
Just like Vlad the Impaler. When an Ottoman army approached his city of Targoviste and saw tens of thousands of people who had been impaled and were being picked apart by crows, vultures and most importantly flies, they decided to tuck tail and bail. I'm sure the flies were thrilled though 😆
"...and while that's very just... What? It could also help us understand depression and aging humans." That was hilarious, dude. Good show.
But fruit flies always go inside my vinegar traps, and they can see their dead friends floating in the traps before they enter.
in the beginning i thought she said breathing so i got confused when she said it was hard lmao
they do?
100% true, I’ve left a few spoonfuls of whiskey or wine in a cup where fruit flies dominate my kitchen and within 3 days there must have been about 20 flies in the glass, fly spray and traps barely work for me and this seems to be the most effective way. Drunken little mites. Try it
Absolutely fascinating! Thank you!
I knew it! I've always left the carcasses of dead flies as a warning to the others - "ye be warned" - like how they hung pirates near ports to make a statement.
Was any of it funded by the NSF?
Got it, leave the dead flies in my home where they are so that the new ones will die faster
I'm concerning of the well-being of the researchers.
Good, I hate flies
Only people who think our feelings make us human and special would be surprised flies have serotonin.
I'm gonna plaster my walls with post flies
TFW it's not house flies 😢
I’d be willing too bet they do that so the next generation can survive because it would be advantageous in times of low food availability so the adults would die in mass leaving nutrients for the young and creating less food competition for the species
Clickbait.   Flies do not die when they see dead flies. If exposed to dead flies for 48 hours, they lived 25% shorter lives than flies than had not been exposed to dead flies.
That is awesome. I’ve been leaving the bodies out as a warning but I had no idea it was this effective.
wtf blind flies can fly
0:09 I thought she said "breeding"
Hey it's Pat is a great movie and fruit fly 411 about death is great too, thanks!!  Do you think they should change the name to "Hey THEY Pat" or "Hey THEM Pat"? ( just asking for a friend )
It’s so strange to me how this evolved to be true. Clearly, it would seems as if flies that don’t have this reaction (by means of mutation) would live longer to create more offspring.
That thumbnail is something else
Art imitates life.  Flies imitate death.
Why do I feel like I’m watching a CNET video with Brian Tong?
Worst thumbnail I've ever seen
you know when a video is sponsored by linode shits about to get real
Average doctor lives to be 73  Average lifespan of a fast food employee is 79.  Average lifespan of a rock artist who sings about morbidity is 45.  Average life span of a mortician …is 40+.   Says a lot about how humans age with depression.  Seems like the less you deal with and think about dead people the longer you live.  This is why I switched from a nurse to a fast food employee. I wondered if I’d feel happier and healthier. And I do.
Therapy takes a while. Flies don’t live long enough for therapy to be effective.
So you're telling me it I want to keep fruit flies out of things I should keep dead fruits fly near it got it.
How did you managed to make me see cuteness in a fly ! I really dislike them… but the image of a fly on a tiny chaise …
Title: "Why Flies Die When They See Dead Flies" Loads of people in the comments guessing why, evidencing that the video does not, in, fact, tell you why. Thanks, comments, for saving me 7 minutes of my life.
So in other words, if I kill an insect... like a mosquito, I need to keep those corpse like trophies in hopes it kills the others that might enter my room.
"these studies aren't directly relevant to people" I and my fruit fly cultures beg to differ.
ty for video, well presented.
It wasn't the video, I had a hard time with the presenter.  Hope chemo is going well!
This explains why I often find so many dead flies in one place.
They saw the flies that make you old.
Ive had these stupid things infest my house and they definitely were not purterbed by their dead, because the population just kept growing
I'm always noticing how similar everyone's speaking patterns is on this channel. They all have a different voice but it's the same mannerisms
Then why dont the flies in my crib care abt their dead buddies and never seem to leave 😂
so my habit of impaling dead flies and presenting their bodies as a warning to their brethren IS in fact effective.
I supposed humannwoukd die early too
Kinda seems like the acknowledgment of death stresses them out until they just die. Like they aren't very smart maybe they never think about death until they see/smell it.
trauma can cause humans to live not as long right?  Ik things like CPTSD can cause you to have more health issues vs someone who doesn't have it.
Fly 1: First time? Fly 2: "dies"
Where the fk do you get blind flies ?
Oh so that’s why my Drosphila stock failed, I was wondering why they never bred. Messed up my lab work for a whole week lmao
Glad to see your finally back on your feet after it’s Pat flopped at the box office 😂
Imma need these flies to start dying then. Ive never been this lucky
I actually think that there’s some thing that we cannot detect yet that is killing the original flies and then, when other flies fly to them, they get affected by the same thing causing the death cycle
breathing isnt a fun proccess. great way to start a video.
I clicked because the thumbnail had me "dying" 😂😂😂
How come that one fly didn't die at my house? I left one dead fly in front of my window just lying there rotting for other flies to take as a warning, flies were still annoying me.
Ok so time to store dead flies
This is a science show but gives me something that’ll tell me there’s more than 2 genders hmm the irony
tf2 killbind
I had to watch this because I didn't know that flies die when they see other flies.
Great. Kill one to kill every flies
I mean, if I walked into a room full of murdered people everywhere, that would probably cut some years off my life and I would become depressed.
I'ma start making my house a fly graveyard so when a fly sees the dead fly it quite literally drops dead and adds to the pile, thus the cycle continues 😈
So you might be wondering how they knew when they were dealing with fruit flies that couldn't see or smell. Well the answer i... Read more
Very interesting concept. She did a solid job presenting.
Bruh, what happened to you
But why do they die? What's the evolutionary advantage? Extinguishing of bad genes from the pool? (they only die if they're related)
Man if this applied to mosquitos they wouldn't be a problem anymore. Cover myself in dead mosquitos and more will not attack, what a dream!
The whole transgender culture js beyond wild, can’t tell if this human is male or female… thank you for the information though 👍
Maybe the flies just died from whatever contagious fly disease had killed the dead ones
put a corpse in your living room and see how long you live haha
so this i what kodak black meant when he said y’all dead flies
Welp was about to type "Because time flies faster"
I just want to know how much of your tax money went into this stupid study?
Time to hang dead flies around my house
i knew some mammals aside from humans could recognize death but flies? i’m mind blown
NEW FLY DEFENSE IDEA: Show ‘em the corpses of their fallen friends.
Seems like a mechanism for regulating population overshoot and collapse -- self regulating and balancing would ensure the species survival.
Fruit flies sound very empathetic. The pain and horror they must feel to see and smell dead flies must be horrific-understandably so.
So what I'm getting here is i should put fruit fly corpses and sticky traps all over the windowsill if i have a problem
I was gona give an upthumb but that cringe time flies pun gave me a shock injury and I must reconsider
I guess it's time to be vlad the impaler of flies
I'm no expert but flies only "live" for long enough to lay eggs, and "living longer" is only needed if they can't find a place to do so.  Once they lay eggs, it's actually better for them to die immediately so their bodies can be a food source for larvae.  If they can't find a good place to lay eggs, their chemistry triggers them to keep living longer until they do.   My guess with dead flies is that there's a practical correlation between seeing dead flies and that location being good to lay eggs.  Lots of fly bodies = good place to lay eggs = speed up metabolism and aging = lay eggs and die sooner = help larvae to survive  Just an armchair hypothesis!
This is actually so op for my fly farm. Guys we getting so many levels tonight!
Seeing a dead dog by a freeway was one of the  saddest sights ive seen to this day. I cant forget it, and it broke my heart from the exact moment I saw him. 😢
ahhh. dropping like flies.
they're just tf2 players
I’m going to start hanging fruit flies from the ceiling
This is the moment when flies became heisenberg
This boy is very intelligent
I just found this by "accident." 🤯
2:25 Who, but more importantly HOW did one measure the fat storage of a fruit fly.
Sounds like stress. There are many physiological processes that can help you survive hard times in the short term but frequent exposure can damage the body and shorten your lifespan.
Looks like a glitch for flies to speed run their lives faster.
Take this, negative people on the internet attempting to rub their negativity onto people!
This is some Nam, CIA psychological warfare sh**...
Is it me or does she sound like ai ?
Flies that perceive dead conspecifics also reproduce at a higher rate, and this may suggest that the decrease in lifespan is due to the strong trade-off between reproduction and survival in this species.
5:11 I didn't expect Scishow to get the definition and experience of human depression not right, btw. There are enough people already who think depression is like what you guys said, esp. the sadness thing *big sigh* x-x  But thank you so much for the video and great info, as usual <3 Had no idea about any of this and hope science can uncover even more there :)
Fascinating and the dialog was witty; I enjoyed it very much, great presentation!
Weird. I wouldn't have guessed any of this going by the fruit flies in my kitchen every summer. Very cool.
That was a new face to Sci show I haven't seen before. Refreshing. I want to see more new people. I think it helps the channel.
scientists are changing themselves these days.  Some are mimicking others.  Nature and Science should be integrate.  Cognitive dissonance evident.
So my philosophy of leave the dead in the building as an example to the rest actually WORKS?! I'm an accidental genius
The fact flies feel depression and grief is just sad
Can't miss out on the latest fad
Well... let's do the same experiment on humans... I doubt the results would be much diffrernt ;D
Same thing as humans and PTSD when you think about it
If only mosquitos did this also.
Man, I’ve been making a digital comic for the last 20 years that’s secretly about depression called Dead Flies (ignore that timeline though - there’s less strips than you might expect).  I should really try and work this factoid in somehow.
What did the one frog say to the other?  Time is fun when you're having flies!
Soooooo….. you mean when I find a dead fruit fly I should stick it on a pin by the window as a warning to all other fruit flies that their time is also near?
Didn't Padme in Star Wars die from a lack of a will to live?  She must have been a fly.
So you're saying if I want to protect a home from flies, I just need to strum up a display of dead flies around a window?
So I should keep fly corpses around the house?
This might not be entierly related to the topic discussed in the video but the idea of flies aging faster and sometimes outright dying when seeing death got me thinking about a couple of my friends who are married.  A year ago they had turned 30 and were very healthy looking. The woman was pregnant with twins. Unfortunately the children died shortly after being born. The funeral was absolutly gutwrenching and they asked their friends to give them space after. I recently run into them at a festival and I was thrilled to see them again but the thing that struck me is how much older they both looked. It was the first time I saw the woman wearing make-up and the guy started getting white hair. Both looked as if they aged more then a decade in this single year.  I deffinitly don't have the education to make any guesses here but I suppose it could be similar to what is going on with the flies, only as a person's life expectancy is a lot longer, a human probably wouldn't fall over and die from depression - a fruit fly on the other hand very well may, if they both experience rapid aging.  Anyway, the twins' names were Pola and Slava. I like saying their names if I ever get the chance so I can refesh them in my memory. And now you also know they were here at a time, fellow youtube commenter. Thanks for reading, remember to hug your loved ones.
Exercise
5:22 that's hilarious 😂
can a fly even feel pain? is it even really an animal?
You’re telling me that I can put dead flies anywhere to get rid of flies?
i had tons of flies on my window the other day and i trapped them and killed them, then the next day more came and i did the same. i cleaned the flies but some of them were hidden in little crevices of my window i couldnt nor wanted to get to. now whenever a fly goes on my window it dies, possibly cause of seeing another dead fly, or cause i put long-lasting poison spray...
What a load of bullcoks then. "Why flies dies when they see dead flies". Well you know, flies die. Regardless if they ever encounter a dead fly or not, they die. The title seems to imply flies live forever unless they encounter a dead fly, at which point they die. Then you (he/she?) explain they live 77% of the life of a fly that didn't see a dead fly. But if they see a dead fly at 95% of their expected life do they die even faster?
I hate flies! Good news :)
Fuether evidence that depression litetally shorthens your lifespan.
Yesterday I‘ve killed a normal Housefly, an other came around an looked at his dead buddie, got killed and an other one also came to look. A bit weird and sad.
they WHAT
Remember, these are all evolved to help the genes survive. It might help the fly colony breed on a better environment for their survival. Lifespan is a result of natural selection. When a shorter lifespan helps survival, the species will evolve towards that direction. In my opinion, lifespan extending technology is more ethically equestionable than cloning.
These experiments sound like a horror movie for flies.
So to clear my room of flies, I just have to publicly hang one?
I’ve started hanging fly corpses everywhere 😊
Hmm did they perhaps change behavior as well? for instance did they start multiplying even more rapidly? Guess the sight of death could make them think something like their "cycle" is over soon so they need to do more to ready the next "cycle"
Fruit flies really said 🎶All my friends are dead, push me to the edge🎶💀
No wonder there’s soo many dead fruit flies in the bottle I made for catching them, one after the other saw their dead brethrens and decided to go in willingly to die.
Welp…I guess I’m not attending another funeral🙂
I heard of another study that showed fruit flies responded to threats in the same way that many vertebrates do-that they displayed actual fear rather than simple robotic avoidance of a threat as previously thought. There's definitely more going on here with these little fellas than most people think.
Idk shadow
Honestly all this tells me is if you kill a fly in your room and leave it around you can get rid og the rest of them
Mood...
Could it be related to some kind of unseen fly disease that flies can spread when they die?
Wait a minute. Is this why the news mostly show doom and gloom, because we currently don't have enough to support social security 🤨
Uh how come when u kill fruit flies or flies in the house they live longer after seeing their fellows squished corpses😂
Got it , now I have pictures of dead flies on my kitchen walls
Go Go Sci Show! <Engagement boosting comment>
Soooo, you're suggesting i keep a few dead fruitflies near my fruitbowl? Should i also pierce their tiny heads on needles and put them on a tiny brick wall as a warning for the next fruit flies? XD
Imagine being trapped in a maze in which you frequently stumble upon corpses and smell decay in the air. That would age me pretty fast too
I be leaving tons of fly bodies especially fruit flies get dead thank God.  You wont make me feel sorry for those annoying pieces of bacteria carrying nasties
Damm I once saw an Ant die after seeing another dead ant. I thought that would just have been a coincidence.
Dislike. Cus "living only 77% long as expected" does equal the catchy title of immediately dying
Peer pressure
I was understanding everthing up till the study im too higb
wait, how do they find blind flies?
I look forward to science proving that modernist buildings increase aging in humans and other animals.
This just convinces me more that we’re in the matrix. Life is a valuable commodity and seems life is programmed to self destruct in inopportune scenarios.
Biology accidentally discovers psychology again
That is the absolute worst hoist you could of picked.... like YYUUCCKK 🤢🤮
So I just need to kill one fly to leave a message 😂
So there is absolutely merit to putting up little pikes with flies stuck on them as a warning to other flies is all I'm learning.
Gotta start collecting the dead bodies...
I've never heard about flies getting depressed. Dying of depression. That's- well... Depressing.
New strategy: Impale a dead fly and flaunt it to their annoying community members.
What would be the point? I mean most living things know instinctively to avoid there own dead, but also making you die faster doesn’t serve a evolutionary purpose I can imagine. Why would that mechanism have even evolved  in the first place.
I really enjoy Savannah videos! woohoo!!  I never heard flies died like this!
Looks like nobody on the writing team has a veteran in their family...
incredible thumbnail
_You say this doesn't happen for humans..._  Go ahead and take a bunch of humans who are simply going about their lives, no problems, kidnap them, force them to walk down a long dark tunnel into a chamber with a bunch of dead bodies and keep them trapped there for [whatever the human/fly timescale equivalent would be] and then drop them back into their lives like nothing happened, to go back to whatever cubicle or storefront they worked at before you kidnapped them.   *Tell me their gray hair and unåliving rates stay the same...*
I used to catch flys and stick them with a toothpick to our drop ceiling at home when I was a kid.  My dumbass friends believed me that I shot the toothpick through a drinking straw and stuck them there. Lol I was a legend among them for crap like that id set up and make it look like I was learning some super ninja crap at the Karate dojo I studied at.  I can and did catch them out of the air tho I just employed a bit of trickery.
The stress of constantly being shown dead humans would probably shorten my lifespan, too.
We had a spell at work where we’d find dead flies on the inside of the windows. It was pretty disturbing to be quite honest and we never knew why they just died
...... Okay I shall fish some dead flies out of my fly trap so the rest will see them and smell them, since now I think they are too hard to see and they only smell alcohol from the trap...... Thanks! 😅
I love that we have starving humans on this planet, and yet we have folks who have spent notable time and presumably money caring about a depressed insect.
So what you are saying is I should display the heads of the flies fallen comrads on spikes around my house.
I left the dead ones lying around, jokingly "as a warning". Turns out, it was as effective as it felt like.
ah. I'm having a hard time cementing and understanding what I learned
So find creative and decorative ways to display dead flies.
This video is why I choose to read about these things.  So annoying.
Houseflies be kamikazeing into the sight of clumps of dead flies on a fly paper
I imagine a fly laying back on a cough being told "Tell me about your buzza..."
Cool story bro
It seems to me that this aversion is o your fellow dead is nature's way of keeping them from potential danger, the physical changes and stressors being nature "incentive plan" to make sure they stay away
Thanks 👍
Very unscientific interpretation and exaggeration... The easy and obvious answer is seeing corpses of related animals induces STRESS. What a waste of money.
ANDY MILONAKIS?????
Of course it's adorable fruit flies and not jerkwad house flies.
So I've been wasting money on fly traps?
So keeping the dead one in the window did actually do something
so they hate the deathpit but need to feed. on their dead friends. just to pile up. also their hate and sadness. luvit
!!!
Time to make a wall of dead flies
So it seems like the flies evolved to get sad when they see dead flies, and thus want to avoid them, but when they can't avoid them for whatever reason, they get the *big* sad and die.
absolutely love the thumbnail😂❤
Its a old trick... farmers said pluck all the bad bugs off your plants crush them in water. Then spray your plants.. they claimed something would kill them but now this video makes sense...
People have, indeed, been affected and passed within a year of the death of a long term spouse. It seems to have been connected to how well they had loved each other.
Then this is a much better solution than using bug spray. All I have to do is keep a few dead flies around and play some on surfaces when I see Life lies about. Don't see the Dead Fly and immediately start dying. No need for chemicals, or even a flyswatter. The more you learn.
so what this woman is saying is monkey see monkey do?
So, in theory, putting fly heads on pikes — or rather, toothpicks — would basically scare other flies to death?
Sooooo basically, in order to get rid of flies effectively, all I have to do is leave the dead flies inside my home?
Is it just fruit flies? X.x Regular flies are awful.
Glad to see Pat from SNL found work and is doing well.
How do you know if a fruit fly is blind?! 😮😅
I was so disappointed when I heard it's just about fruit flies. I almost wanted to get a dead regular fly and put it on the window ledge...
I work on drosophila as a model organism for neuroscience research and last month when I saw this research it ticked many of my own observations....
What
That was very interesting! Thank you ! @SciShow
Can we pause on that 😂😂😂 1:24  just imagine it 😂😂😂😂😂
I didn't expect this to be about fruit flies and so useful 😂😂😂 I guess I need to go speed up some aging 😂😂😂
imagine if this was the same case in humans, no one would want to be a mortician/coroner or anyone in the death profession 😂
You will never get my sub back, even if you apologize. I thought this was a fact based channel that believed in truth and the scientific method. The moment you were "proudly sponsored" by an organization built around targeted hiring based on exclusionary protected classes was the day I lost my respect for your morals and, unfortunately, hank personally. Racists are people that are focused on color rather than quality, you'd do well to never forget that again. You've lost me but there's still a good chance you could retain other people willing to think. End the "wokeness" which is, ironically, the sociopolitical practice of plugging your ears shutting your eyes and going 'la la la la, I can't hear you, la la la la la, your opinion doesn't matter because you're just a (insert color or gender)"
It could be an evolutionary advantage in limiting the spread of disease, although that would make more sense with social insects.
Frequently exposing an flies to other dead flies? So just causing PTSD to these flies and they ultimately die from constant mental breakdowns.
Next time I kill a fly I’m leaving the corpse out for awhile instead of throw it  in the trash  lol
How do they identify flies with no sense of smell?
Wait. I understood the results as when the serotonin receptors are inactivated the lifespans are not affected by exposure to dead flies. Meaning that the lack of serotonin could actually extend lifespan, not what they concluded.
I wonder if in the future, places with fly problems could set a new fly trap of a photo of a dead fly with a synthesized smell of dead flies.
*EMOTIONAL DAMAGE* = Super Effective 😌
I need to know which fly species this works with.
my fruitflies need to get the memo or something
I remember when I did fly experiments. There'd always be one fly that outlived all the others. I'd always keep and breed those "lone survivor" flies.
Peer pressure
So their turning flies into psychopaths. That can't be good.
To bad roaches aren't like that. Their more like "poor Larry! I'll make sure he doesn't go to waste nom nom nom"
Time to hang the corpses of my fly victims from my roof as a ward against further intrusions and a way to add to the collection
Imagine discovering a corpse that knocks a few years off your life.
Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana.
WHAT?
Can you be fly on a plain to Boston ?  Depends on what you be wearing
Then why don't the flies just vanish in a trash room? Lol
seriously,  very interesting
that pun at the end. just wow lol
As growing up on a mixed grain and cattle farm we witnessed cattle funerals as if one of our cows or little calf died natural causes or coyote attack the the cattle would form a circle around the the dead cow or calf & moo in sorrow and we had 350+ cattle so the circle could be very large  especially for a calf then after their ritual they left in single file
Wow, that's honestly really fascinating!
Gloria was right... It was about sending a message
at this point i killed so many fruit flies i must have made 100 of fruit flies kill themself
Can you choose someone else to speak next time? Honestly almost anyone else will do
probably it triggers a process of preserving resources to allow other flies to live, as they see them dying.
For some parts of the video i couldn't understand the host. I had to put the video at 0.75 speed, I've never had this problem before 😅. Great video otherwise!
This maybe explains when I was killing flies with one of those electric swat thingies 3 other flies just flew on it and killed themselves. I was literally just standing still
so they basically getting traumatized to death... relatable
I can confirm that this is true in my own experience, as when fruit flies in my house see other fruit flies drowned in a dish of apple cider vinegar and dish soap, they usually jump right in after them
There's a graveyard on my window and can explicitly say that I've never seen it.
SOMETIMES YOU SAY...SO NEVER!
Aaactually, I went to high-school with this guy, who was a good guy. He had left a party and then wound up crashing his car. Sadly, he ended up hitting a tree and died on impact (Rip Kevin). Fire rescue got there first. One of the older members had known him and had a heart attack upon seeing his damaged, bloody, and lifeless body. He too did not make it. So, as a human, seeing another one dead can cause you to die.
What must happen if they see BrundleFly
I wish this was the same for mosquitoes. One time I killed like 15 of them out on my desk. Then here comes another one trying bite me giving zero shits about the grave yard I just made.
Interesting 🤔 it is understandable that a living being would avoid places where it can see dead bodies of it's own kind for dead bodies could mean that those places are not the best to stay, something is wrong there, yet to die because of seen dead bodies as itself that is mostly seems to be weird thing to do and that is interesting how that behave could form in nature because usually in nature the most important element we can point out would be survival, so maybe something is much deeper behind this behave
california flies overcame that. they eat the dead and come back for more
what if the reaction to other dead flies is not depression but fear?
I don't remember seeing this with fruit flies before... Oh not a strong impact, just statistical signature. K.
lesbian
I always keep a dead fly by the windows. Not because im lazy, but to keep other flies away 😅
Monkey see monkey do😅
When humans see their dead relatives, sometimes they die too! Nature is fascinating! 👹
Imma kill a swarm of flies with a dead fly and watch the dominoes fall exponentially
is it toxic
PTSD Kills.
I wonder if the data in this study is accurate or fudged.
“Cue Vietnam flashback meme for flies”
🤷‍♀️ when my father died when I was 19, I spent the majority of the first year laying in bed and waiting to die.  Not because I thought it was going to happen soon, but that I didn't *want* anything anymore. If I didn't have people that I felt responsible for their emotional state if I were to die, I probably wouldn't have made it.  It's been 11 years, and my relationship with food still hasn't fully recovered.   In some ways I don't think we are entirely different.
Time to hang up some dead fly posters
Is Savanah transitioning? They seem more masc than in previous videos. They look good, happy, and healthy either way. I am just curious.
MA! We're throwing away the bug sapper! I want to hang a giant photo of a dead fly!
We bought some infected bananas one time and were infested with fruit flies.  So we got a bottle and put apple cider vinegar in it. Made a trap.  Killed them all.  Little bloody nasty fruit flies. They didn't die after seeing their dead bros.
Nice presentation. If it were live, I'd have asked her this: If I kill a housefly in, say, my kitchen, would it be a good idea to leave its little body on the counter for a short time so any other fly can see it?!
"Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana."
thx for the fly science cutie
I guess even fruit flies agree that too many fruit flies would NOT be a good thing!
I just printed a pic of a dead fly in A4 size.
3 mins in an no explanation. Clearly this is an old video. Next!
Have they tried SSRI on the flies?
That’s probably why fruit fly traps are so effective 😮 I learned something
I'm sure the military is looking into weaponizing this. Did they already - COVID-19?!?
That thumbnail tho 😂
So weird.
I'm placing dead flies all over the house now. LOL. Thanks for the tips.
Huh, so evolution chose to go with a hard wired kill switch. Put those tinfoil hats on fellas - looks like big biotech is genetically manipulating their fruit fly product to have a shorter life span ensuring more repeat purchases.   But really, that is bizarre to find
When are you going to make a video worth watching that does not torture other animals ?
Correct: "time flies" ... it flies like an arrow. Whereas fruit flies like a banana. (Thanks for Groucho Marx for that insight!)
STOP YELLING AT US! Why is this channel so loud? I don’t like this. Please stop.  Yelling at your audience is lame.
With such specific genes controling this behavior/physiology, I almost hypothesisize whether or not this has to do with disease. If you're a fruit fly, you're easily susceptible to disease and are around it often, but not all disease effects you. However, if there are a lot of dead flies around you, this could signal a disease problem. Sexual reproduction's goal (if it could have goals of its own) is to speed up evolution. If there is a disease wiping out adult flies, it makes sense to die quicker if the flies are also reproducing faster, in order to reduce the likelihood of disease killing off flies before they can adapt to that disease.   I wish this video had gone more in depth about possibilities of why such adaptations exist in the first place, because fruit flies aren't the only critters who do this, I bet! I wonder if a disease angle is even the right way to view this.   Someone correct me if I missed something! These presentation-style videos are difficult for me to follow at times :C
Wanting to be far away from corpses is understandable, fly or not fly 😂
Please make a video about those modern "mosquitoe killing lamp", they ssually have UV light, does that do anything??
I usually leave corpses as a warning to the others. Good to know it does more than instill fear
I think them dying and trying to avoid dead flies is simply a disease thing. You don't want to spread that dead animal's disease to the rest of the population.
Very nicely done!  👍🏻👍🏻♥️
I Die alittle on the inside when i see my youtube history.🤔
Bro just resurrect them by dumping salt on them
I sense a Gary Larsen cartoon coming on.
Psychologically traumatising fruit flies for science?
I think they had a heart attack
Just fruit flies? Odd. And it relates to some sort of stress hormones, or lack-of-stress hormones, such as serotonin. Definitely interesting and/but definitely different.   The whole seeing dead bodies thing, though... I shouldn't have watched this right now. I and my other son found my oldest son dead at the beginning of the month. Matthew, my baby boy... 39 years old, way too young to go. A momma shouldn't have to bury her baby boy. I'm still in shock, and they still don't know yet WHY this happened – how the hell do I keep breathing? But I have to! His younger brother depends on me so much more, now!   On a related (and very important) note, please, please, anyone reading this needs to take time to tell your loved ones you love them EVERY chance you get.

Imagine having the ability to be traumatized to death when you only have a few days to live anyways lol
Who is this fella?
I thought this was due to diseases coming from dead flies. That’s why bees and ants transfer corpses away from their colony.
How the heck do you scan a flys brain
"All my friends are dead. Push me to the edge."
Lolll read this article few months back
Dogs do the opposite when they’re sick or about to die they leave the pack.
So should I put up pics of dead flies in my house and backyard?
Broken heart syndrome occurs in humans also.
My second Zebrafinch died after it was in a cage with it's dead partner for a few hours. We were away for a few hours and when we returned, one was dead and the second died hours later. I always thought it was (romanticly) because of a broken heart, but maybe it was the same thing.
those sticky traps tell a different story
So basically what you're saying is I should leave dead fruit flies laying around my kitchen.
Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.
You gave me a idea 💡
And you thought YOUR existential crises were bad
Did u know clover flowers are a carnivores plant? When fall starts flys from the ground get stuck to the flower and the plant goes to sleep it brings the fly in for fuel for next year
NEMATODES
Great video!
nah bro it's because of peer pressure
What's with the Intro? How is breathing a difficult process that feels like it's knocking years off one's life?😮 That sounds like someone suffering from respiratory disease, not the default
Got a new strat to kill all the stupid flys in my room lol
I guess even Beelzebub gets sad.
I am now going to leave dead flies all across my house
If humans were surrounded by dead flies for their entire lifetime, their lifetime may shorten too.
This is really interesting and creepy in a way.  Also, who is disliking the vid and why?
I'm picturing some poor intern with a toothpick blinding hundreds of flies for this experiment 😂
So what I’m hearing is a better way to kill flies 😂😂
yawns sure are contagious
Don't forget: " Time flies like an arrow and fruit flies like a banana " Truer words have never been spoken.
when I perceive the clip of a fly cleaning its own head off, my ageing is also sped up
Yes this happens but not as straight cut as this show says 😂 oversimplflied yes but also misleading like every fruit fly sees another dead fruit fly and just decides to die 😂😂
Kids growing up next to cemeteries be like🧟‍♂️
Shark repellant is made from dead sharks.
Why do they/thems always look the same lol
Time flies.... omg no.  Bad.  Lol
We had a spousal pair in our ICU. Both seriously ill. The husband passed within twelve hours of the wife. So sad.
Flies avoiding dead flues may explain why fly paper doesnt work as well as one would think
Glad to hear that my tendency to leave the fruitfly corpses on their "Death Trap Plant Stickers" to sign to their brethren that their time, too, is nigh, is in fact helping!
TL;DR humans are basically premium flies
So that's why all the fruit flies died in my fridge/freezer...  Seriously, I had a bunch come in on some fruit then they disappeared one day.  I found, like, 2-3 dozen dead on the floor of my fridge  Why there?    No idea 🤷🏻‍♀️
i wish i was a dead fly
Now i know to keep dead fly with me....or buy a plastic dead fly.
I mean, I don't expect my life expectancy to stay stable if I live surrounded by corpses, be it because of disease or... well, knowing that you're surrounded by corpses
☝️😏 how about mosquitoes?
🤗 young lady!  Thank you for such an informative and delightful look at these beasties
So that means we can repel flies if we can trick them into thinking the house they're in is full of dead flies ?
5:45 I expected her to say that time flies like an arrow while fruit flies like a banana. ;)
There is new research that shows extreme grief changes the shape of the human heart, making it more vulnerable to cardiac arrest.  To "die of a broken heart," is more than merely a myth.
Simple things, just science to complicate things... stress just eats  your life span, as simple as that.
I guess the fruit flies in my kitchen lack empathy or have zero serotonin. They see the other ones ones on the sticky trap and couldn‘t care less, 🤷🏻‍♀️
I personally thought they were just like robots that basically had no awareness of the outside world other than I see food or i see danger.
I wonder what evolutionary fitness this confers. Maybe a way to immediately contain a disease outbreak?
okay, I'm now keeping all the flies I kill on my window so other flies avoid it,  I need to know if this also affects mosquitoes
77% of standard life span isn't actually a "drop dead" scenario, more of a "faster degenerate and die 23% faster" one.
So they are very depressive flies?? 🤔
Finally a good way to get rid of fruit flies, the Vlad the Impaler method.
Ok so just how in the world are we able to not only see such incredibly small, nearly atomic in size, neurons in such detail as to distinguish one type from another, and let alone on one of the smallest organisms out there??
It sounds like they switch to a "fight or flight" mode when dead flies are around, like increasing their metabolism and such, maybe to be better prepared to short term dangers.
I thought about the scientists blinding flies for a living and it gives me mixed feelings XD
Thanks for recommending YouTube! So all we have to do, to live longer, is to change our mindset and learn how to genuinely enjoy the death and suffering of others? Well if we are insects that is. Thank god we're human.   Keep it uuup!
Thumbs up, as always. But. Give me some dopamine...  ;-)
Interesting... it makes me wonder if this could somehow be connected with that one study that said that linked male patients being more resilient to death when exposed to female nurses. Also, trying to correlate this with humans, putting seniors a place where they are limited and interact only with other third age humans, aka an ASSYLUM, in contrast to make them live in a functional home, where they can interact with their youngest descendants, like their grandkids. Im pretty sure their lifespans and overall health would be affected?
Kinda a no brainer humans wouldn't want to be in the same room with dead bodies😂❤
So thats what happened to all the Goth Girls.
How do you turn off senses or even find a fruit fly brain without destroying it before you can even study it...
Father in law: So what do you do?  Me: Im a brain surgeon.   Father in law: Oh! Have you seen anything crazy?  Me: Yeah. I keep having to operate on patients to prevent them from dieing when they see their dead friends or relatives.  Father in law:Jesus Christ. Thats crazy  Me: I know, right? (Takes a sip)
Do we know if the fly has to see a REAL fly to die or is it enough to print out a bunch of dead flies and stick them on a wall somewhere for them to see?
Serotonin may also play a role in why anorexics can starve a lot more dramatically than other people before dying.
Time fLiEs when you’re not having fun
Time flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like a banana.
Oh my god, flies die from sadness?!
Relating this to perception/depression is incredibly interesting. Definitely a point on nature side of the scale. Also props for recognizing the ever present passage of time in this vid🫡🫡🫡🫡
Okay...but how do you do an MRI on a fly.. ?
Well the fruit flies in my house definitely didn't get the memo
Very astute presentation 👏.  Please consider doing an episode on creatures living significantly longer on a calorie restricted diet.
I stared at the thumbnail for almost an entire minute before I realized that wasn’t a yorkie wearing a large, strange hat!🙈😅
Me having watched hundreds of hours of BESTGORE  ......... -_- *DIES*
They *what*
I wonder if this works with houseflies too.  If it does, I'm going to cut back on cleaning my window sills.
Science is wild... you can shut off various senses, specific neurons, or even just specific neurotransmitter receptors on those neurons. And, of course, observe the effects of all of these. All in an animal whose brain is practically microscopic to start with. How much trial and error did it take to figure all that out? Absolutely wild!  Very intrigued by the implications of all this, though. As someone with depression, I'm always given hope by research that may, eventually, lead to new treatments.
Now if only the boomers in charge would die when they see their cronies croak
Well, at least they died doing what they loved to do.  😶
Time flies when you're having fun, unless you're a frog... then fun times when you're having flies.
Aight time to litter my house with the bodies of dead flies now that I know they'll understand the message
Thanks for having a non-binary host. It’s nice to see lovely speakers of all genders with great presenting skills… and great personal fashion skillz.
I am trying to understand the evolutionary benefit to fruit flies dying sooner, the more often they encounter dead fruit flies.  The video explained the physiological mechanism, I believe, but not the evolutionary benefit [unless I missed that part of the video].  Perhaps the presence of dead fruit flies is evidence of limited food, and the entire fruit fly population benefits if individuals have shorter life spans during which to consume the limited food resources.  I recall reading that male mice typically die soon after mating so that no one male contributes too much of his DNA to the general population, and this helps maintain genetic diversity among mice.  I would think that evolution generally designs living things to live as long as possible; but apparently there can be evolutionary advantages in limiting the life spans of certain members of a population.
This video is ageing me 😱
Fruit flies: "if there's no one besides you, when your soul embarks, I'll follow you into the dark"
I mean it's often seen in much older couples who have been together a long time.... The stress of their loved one going can cause them to go to
You people just making things up now for attention huh?😄
A few weeks ago out of nowhere there were if I remember correctly 16 dead fruit flies in my tub. Never saw this many at once in my place before but I imagine it has something to do with the bathroom window being open. The fruit flies are small enough to go through the bug screen so if the windows open I guess they can just come in. Regardless bugs in general somehow find a way to come inside any building anyways even with no visible gaps in the windows or anything. I never knew this before. Kinda interesting.
So to keep flies out of your house, we should get a curtain of dead flies
The Romans used to tie a convicted man to a dead man -- skin to skin -- and the live man will quickly die.
So when I swat a fly, should I leave its corpse around so his friends die?
Death is bad for your health.
This is completely useless to me but also super fascinating, thanks internet.
now I feel connected to flies more than ever
Maybe seeing so many deaths at once is a traumatic overload for their tiny brains :(
I thought it was because they took "dies from cringe" seriously.
This video turned me into Vlad the Fly-impaler. Or maybe like Rome, I’ll decorate the way to my home with crucified flies. Death to the poop eaters!
oh, is that why there's also dead fruit flies around the _edges_ of the trap I put out yesterday, not just in it?
Beautiful, very professional! Well done! Feels good doesn’t it?
"hey he's dead  now so am i" -some random fruit fly
Do you have said that mice are not people you should do a compilation on when mice and people performed very differently under a test of some kind
What a bunch of goons
When I was a kid, I hung a dead wasp in our shed as an experiment to see if the nest nearby would react!  In a few days, the nest was abandoned by the other wasps!
I have been watching sci-show for years and this must be the best thumbnail you guys have ever made.
Hypothesis: Humans who see dead humans live shorter lives. Sometimes die.
Wonder what the average life Expectancy of a mortician is.
I can assure you that this does not happen. Maybe some, some time in rare situations, but no flies do not die when near dead flies. Another horrible video from this same person.
This is a myth (Chatgpt)
the bee one is almost sadder than the flies. imagining a whole prom party full of teenage bees deciding to die when they dont win prom queen
Do flies get sexually aroused like we as humans all do when we see our dead relatives?
My brother's nickname is "the fly" so every time I see a fly in the house, I say get out of here Mike!
I knew keeping the corpses of flies around after killing them was effective! not sure if impaling them is necessary but better safe than sorry.
Now this is the definition of a double-edged sword. On one hand, you won't have to deal with flies. But on the other, you have to leave dead flies everywhere.
I enjoyed this presentation.
Hard to imagine someone sitting around, poking the eyeballs out on fruit flies, and stuffing corks up their noses to stop smelling things, (yes, I know about breathing through their exoskeletons), but hey ... how many people can put that on their resume?
Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana. 😶😜😅🥸🤪    I used to work in a fruit fly lab.
I normally wouldn't go for this video. But with a thumbnail like that? I had to click.
Okay, but they're not actually just dropping dead?
If you want to make the smell of aging depression and death, keep vegetable peels in an airtight containet. After full after several weeks or month, put it into a calender over a toilet bowl and wash the resulting organic acids. Put the vegetable peels back. Soon you get that horrible elderly smell of aging depression and death.
I am rapidly aging and don’t even need to see dead fruit flies for that.
Could this be used as a more climate friendly fly repellant?
How does this benefit humanity?
Scientist, and those sheltered by means are so ignorant. This fool just sad people don't die when they see other dead people. Ever seen an old man lose his wife? Few widowers just happily out live there deceased spouses. Please guys you dont have to be so ignorant. Especially if this is how you "earn" your livings.
So ironically I got a fly tattooed this past week 🪰
Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like a banana.
avoiding dead flies helps the colony avoid carnivorous plants and toxic stuff
I once saw a squirrel carrying a dead squirrel in its mouth. Sad.
That’s not why that’s how. Great video though.
I call dibs on making a fantasy world where this is the case for humans
I have an Idea for a new wallpaper now 😛
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤   watching this video has accelerated my age…… Let’s all go to sugar rock Candy Mountain
Okay so what about morticians?
0:07 Please tell me I'm not the only person who heard 'breathing.'
Shameful click bait title.
Lies. I put many dead flies on my walls and there are still flies around my garbage can.
The real mystery is how those researchers caught the flies alive
I have myself noticed that fly paper seems to work best when it already has dead flies on it. They should print dead flies on fly paper.
5:17 hey, most flies drink nectar, so it doesn't have to be smelly to attract them.
Wait, they die when they see dead flies?
flies without serotonin receptors are basically psychopaths.
For the first minute of the video I was so confused because I thought she said “Breathing” not “grieving”.
5:30 - Are we sure about this?  Has anyone done a well constructed study comparing the lifespans of funeral industry workers with the rest of the population, correcting for as many confounding variables as possible?
Fun fact to add to 0:50 ; crows can hold something similar to a funeral, gathering around the deceased to figure out what killed them.
I could see that like, if a fruit fly comes across several dead fruit flies. It's possible that, from a genetic stand point their brain is saying "Uh oh, we might be an evolutionary dead end, I should tap out so as to not accidentally doom the entire species"
I hypothesize that flies avoid their dead relatives because they understand the concept of environmental storytelling
Life as a fly is inherently traumatic. Imagine being a fly, all you know in your existence is eat and breed. You fly around looking for food and someone to boink. You bump into another fly a few times, life is good. Then without warning you see that other fly splattered on a window.  Trauma in humans has an impact on our serotonin, I wouldn't be surprised if the neuro pathways of a fly simply can't handle the detriment of an impact to their serotonin since it has so many factors connected to it. Human brains can handle trauma better than a fly because we simply have a more complex neuro network. For a fly, seeing a dead fly messes them up so bad their little bodies simply perish.
TF2 players when somebody killbinds
Oh thats why my fruitfly batches for my Geckos die off quite fast
This just popped up and im glad it did🤣🤣
As someone currently with a fruit fly issue at home 0:23 caught my attention, I am now prepared to gather the corpses of the dead and spread them throughout the whole apartment. Watch your dead brethren and die of depression.
It would be interesting to see if the flies' reproductive rates jumped after exposure to the dead flies as a social mechanism for impeding danger cued by a chemical or pheromone marker. If they died faster but reproduction/mating rates jumped up, it might indicate the flies 'sensing' the end and dumping resources into mating/reproduction to pass their genes on
A tad bit unrelated, but the phisological changes of the flies when exposed to dead.ones declining  reminded me how fruit flies will choose to be more I ntoxicated if given the chance if they are rejected from mating vs flies that were not rejected. I mean being exposed to dead bodies and being rejected would be awful for any species, but it’s an understandable option in the end
So, to kill more flies, I just gotta leave one dead fly out?
This keeps happening with the new cats that I bring home. They see the hundreds of dead cats I have all over my house and they immediately panic and die. Oh well. One more to add to the collection.
This sounds like just a weird evolution mechanism. When your entire model is “Make as many babies as possible”, Evolution will force all the ones that are bad at their job out of the gene pool, By predators or starvation and such. It sounds like they’ve taken matters into their own hands— If you see a dead fly, That means you have gone through the same process as that fly, And thus should be punished just the same. They’ve... Expedited their evolution with this. That’s fascinating.  Edit: Just got to the part about expanding their lifespan when food is in short supply. This means that their lifespan is shorter when there IS food. When there is food, There is breeding. This also points to this artificial evolution overdrive. More breeding means more generations means more mutations. But when it’s in short supply? It’s like the opposite of that saying, “If I owe the bank 100 dollars, That’s on me. If I owe the bank 1000000 dollars, That’s on them” — If there’s low food, It’s a fluke, And you can just tough it out with a longer lifespan. But if you starve with that longer lifespan? The fly made a horrible decision, And now it dies — And so, Too, Do all the flies around it, As punishment for getting into that situation. It’s like a punishment model in neural network development... Almost like they have a neural network.
Lol an extra 23% damage is enough to leave some dead flies out.
Could this explain why we have countless myths about what happened to people after they die. Almost all of them have them living somewhere outside of the body.
Aight horror game devs, you got handed this one for free.
Dead flies => something killed them => may not be the best place to lay eggs => die yourself so that the generations that aren't near dead flies continue to breed => better adapted flies faster :)
First things first, no judgment please. But I definitely killed a handful of flies with a bug zapper and left them as a warning for the other flies that they've got it coming too. And suddenly, there were no new flies in the side room. I hoped they got the message and according to this video, it looks like they did. Uh... win for science?
Wait, did they give flies depression ?  That's kind of mean.
Could this be used for pest control?
Funerals would be mass casualty events if humans operated like flies.
Jackdaws... (Reddit flashbacks)
When you consider that a lack of serotonin receptors has been found to a play a role in sociopathic and psychopathic behaviors, this starts to look a lot like "The stress from being consistently exposed to death shortens the lifespan of the individual, unless no stress is induced in the individual due to the presence of sociopathy or psychopathy preventing it.", which sounds... very human. Doubly so when you consider that the majority of people who serve in roles such as mortuary and coroner services tend to display signs of mild sociopathy. Sometimes it feels like we aren't far off from defining lower levels of sentience and putting the argument of animal non-sentience to rest once and for all.
I KNEW IT!   I have said for YEARS that bugs avoided the corpses of their like kind. My mother said I was crazy but I KNEW that when I left the dead bugs others avoided them!   It works for mosquitoes too, by the way. A little less effective but it does work.
Savannah does a really good job. It would be great to see her present the videos more often.
Why fly die guy? K bye!
Im calling bs on this one youre just making up click bait😂
Lesson learned: empty your corpse room regularly to avoid depression.
WOW....Back in the 60s, when my brothers and me were children, my mom use to give us pennies and other awards for killing flies, in the house! My brothers and me noticed, that some flies, would drop dead, in our piles of dead flies!!!!!! After our jobs were done, we would throw away some of the dead flies, but we would leave SOME dead flies, around windows as a WARNING to other flies, who MIGHT want to come inside our house!!!! Weird, for sure! I guess my family knew about this BEFORE Science did!
Does it matter if the dead flies are ... deformed? This could be a game changer for my pest control
So I guess that leaving up the fly strips too long isn't laziness, I'm just making them more efficient.
Death is the most natural state.
whaaaa...?
When all your friends stop playing the game, so you decide to duck out.
Lifehack unlocked: let the dead flies around so the ones infesting your house also die
This is so sad yet sweet and interesting!
WHAT?! Now I feel EVEN WORSE about killing fruit flies! And it totally explains why I only killed about half a dozen but the rest suddenly disappeared. I thought they were just being good hiders. 🥺😭😭😭😭😭
She cute af
so I just need to kill one and display the corpse? I've never heard of this before. Thanks
omg time flies...
Better not happen in humans, I work in palliative care 😂
Iv been swatting them the last hour.  There is one trying to mate with a dead fly as i type.
Them did a good job on this video 🙄
Ok which ones do i have to kill cuz pest control is getting depressing. If I knew it was only one mouse and not an infestation i woulda made friends with it. I took him outside twice but shoulda went further.  Do mice learn? Cuz i coulda just fed it everyday so hes stay outta my stuff. Dude wasn’t even afraid of me was the saddest part. First time i saw him i tried yelling and he just looked at me like i was a crazy person. Honestly none of these animals care. I saw four deer in my back yard and i was like “hey” and they were chill.
Interesting, never heard b4
Stress is different from depression.  Flies are prey.  A bunch of dead flies might make another fly's nervous system think that some danger was lurking around killing flies.  The fly's body responds by de-prioritizing any metabolic processes that are not geared towards short-term survival.  Over time, the fly's body slowly breaks down from lack of upkeep.  The paper should have discounted the effects of stress before offering the explanation of fly depression.
A good way to rapidly age fruitflies is to spray ethanol or similar into the air close to them. They will also keel over and die extremely quickly.
Somewhat deceptive title here. When they see and smell other dead flies, they undergo physiological changes that help them to survive in a natural environment, but cause them to die early in a lab. Rather disappointing reporting here.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVt6zO0zfss&t=4m32s F and H look like happy magicians doing a magic trick.  Or maybe cheerful NPCs giving out free cotton candy.
Bison apparently try to lift dead bisons to their feet
False news theres a bunch of dead flies around my windows and i still see them fly everywere
Thank you for giving me an excellent reason never to go to a funeral again! I can just say that it's bad for my health 😊
This makes me feel way better about not cleaning those dead flies off my window sil. 😂
It’s common for dogs to eat their dead owners face = not-so-fun fact
1:53 “I’m gonna find ya, I’m gonna getcha getcha getcha getcha”
Eye catching title to the video. Then dialing it back during the video. Common enough, but always frustrating
I hate when videos start with "why" in the title but then proceed to say "we don't actually know"
I have small repliels and predatory bugs, and I feed them with flyless fruit flys. So it is not a small thing to know how can I keep them alive longer 😮 maybe I will try to culture them in a dark room 😅
I’ve been leaving their corpses around the house as a show of force. Gotta use that phycological warfare against them
I freaking loved the thumbnail XD
Are those stars on your shirt? That's a nice shirt. Where can I get that??
broke my knee while trying to dodge all the puns
I didn't know that 😂 it's like gettinga heart attack by looking at your dead brother (It can happen literally)
Science is a cruel and frivolous religion.
Too bad mosquitoes & houseflies don’t follow this
put dead flies near food so that all incoming flies unlive
this person looks like an amalgamation of all past scishow hosts
Flies die when you're having fun.
That time researchers traumatized a whole lot of flies by exposing them to a sea of corpses.
This makes me wonder about the elderly in nursing homes...
It kind of makes sense. A lot of things are parasitic to fruit flies. If there are a lot of dead flies its likely the fly seeing it has been infected. If it removes itself from the situation it limits the possible spread to other healthy flies.
Weird and curious. Do flies have a sense of identity?
"Erm, Jerry, why are you decorating your room with dead flies?"
I'm willing to bet if you repeatedly put people in a room with a bunch of dead bodies in it they wouldn't live very long either
naWH now i feel bad about fruit flies what the heck
I didn't know this  Some kind scary dark souls lore
Time to surround my house with fly corpse effigies.
now how do i use this at my bar to get rid of thjese goddamn fruit flies lmfao do i just kill em and leave the bodies there?
Evolutionary benefit of this?
❤❤❤❤❤
These flies are very dramatic.
This is a protection to the species if you are close to a dead body perhaps there is a disease that will affect the flies, so they evolved to die sooner if they come across the dead; It is just an evolutionary adaptation.
They’re just empaths
I suspect this is a survival mechanism.  Flies reproduce very quickly - if there is _anything_ that could suggest poor health conditions, they're better off all dying than to potentially propagate unhealthy genes.
There were two things I learned from this today: fruit flies die faster with exposure to the dead, and fruit flies can be born without olfactory receptors.  I guess it’s probably a combination of both that explains the reason why there’s always a point where suddenly fruit flies aren’t falling for the apple cider vinegar traps I lay out. Either they’re having a visual response like “oh my gosh, it’s Kevin!” And don’t go near it, or the ones without olfactory receptors are the only one that can reproduce, resulting in an army of fruit flies uninhibited by the laws of smell that once bound them for imminent doom.
This is why I don't clean up the bugs I kill. I thought it was just a warning to other bugs, but now I know it's better than that!
That thumbnail is nightmare fuel
Relatable
They should put a glass wall between so no smell comes
flyies have PTSD confirmed
"Breathing is difficult/not fun/ feels like it's knocking years off your life"?! Please try exercise or at least some meditation  Literally never once thought any of those things. Breathing is my favorite
I used to think that animals don't have those emotions they just see every other organisms as part of food chain when the other organisms die they just feed on them UNTIL I WATCHED THIS VIDEO
Ok, so old fruit will do this to freshly cut fruit also. Maybe the dead fruit fly puts off a chemical that causes them to age faster. And seeing dead flies and avoiding them could be because they know it will cause them to age.
I'm sorry... They found a small group of neurons, in flies... Damn, that's really something.
To me it always felt like killing 1 fly makes 2 more show up for the funeral. Perhaps I wasn't displaying the corpse prominently enough..  next time I'll go full Vlad the Impaler and mount it on a toothpick on the window sill.
Then we need to put little fly heads on some pikes to keep the flies from coming in the house. Be warned
Years ago when I was I kid I would leave the dead flies around and my parents would want them cleaned up. I was right!
It is very: "What?"
The statement she said about serotonin regulating your mood has been disproven. Google "The serotonin theory of depression: a systematic umbrella review of the evidence" for the Nature journal paper on it. Multiple other papers as well.
So ima use dead flies put on toothpicks as a message
Saywhatnow?
So fruit flies basically are just humans.
Averages suck. Some flys could live 3 times as long as a dozen others as they are healthier just by chance.   Might give a picture of what to expect for many but doesn't account for all those that defy the odds.
Flies might be attracted to dead flies due to the presence of decaying matter, which they feed on. However, it's not accurate to say that flies die when they see dead flies. Flies are more likely to be attracted to the smell of decay, which can lead them to gather around a dead fly or other decomposing substances. If you've observed flies near a dead fly, it's probably because they are attracted to the odor of decay rather than the presence of another dead fly. Gpt answer
I didn't know that Pablo Escobar was doing science videos now...
So leave the bodies to send a message. Got it.
Don't give vegans any ideas💀
Why only fruit flies? It would have been easier to kill a house fly by hanging their dead relatives outside the house 🤣
Does this work with mosquitoes?
At 1:30 gives a whole  new meaning to "budgie smugglers" for male swimming clothes. Yes we really do call them that,  Victoria Australia, but just the super brief type.
It might just be the stress
I'm aging faster when I see morons. Is it related?
I always thought it was just a winter generation. But the lack of food triggered it.
I wonder if this is why military visibly age after combat deployments
So being fat and depressed is a sign of survival 😂 that makes me feel better
If only that happened. About once a year, my house gets a fruit fly infestation, or it used to. Not anymore. A glass with a little beer in it and a drop of dish soap took care of it. Killing them is pretty easy. They seem to be pretty damn frail.  I had so many fruit flies one day, I could swing an open hand through them and hit about a dozen of them, and they would die. I left them by the piece of fruit they were enjoying, as a warning to the others.  What I saw was disturbing.  A necrotic orgy. Yep, they were being mated with by the living fruit flies. Maybe they weren’t really dead? Well, flat on their backs with legs curled up for several days was my indicator. So… maybe not?  This channel should change its name from “SCIshow” to “ASSume“, because that wasn”t science, that was a metric ton of assumptions. Wow. No wonder kids are so confused today.
So this is basically clickbait. Flies don't die upon seeing dead flies, they merely live shorter lives when surrounded by the dead. And we didn't get an answer *why* in any real way.
They got a guy who blinds flies
"Time flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like a banana" - Groucho Marx. Couldn't resist.
LOL! Loved the thumbnail 😂
I wish this happens to house flies
Sooooooooooo, you are telling me putting pantry moths heads on pikes may work with getting rid of the infestation?
Black floppy flies😅
Akamai means Smart in Hawaiian.
Elden Ring Death Lore Vibes😬
That's kind of sad, now I have to think about how emotionally sensitive flies are.
Don’t know why the flies around my place don’t die then. Plenty of dead flies around for them to look at.
Time flies like an arrow... Fruit flies like a banana!  :-D
Sooo, you're saying if I hate the sound of buzzing flies when sleeping, I should pin dead flies to the walls of my sleeping room?
Okay then the flies outside my house must be f****** bizarre, cause they love cannibalizing dead corpses of their fallen flies... Then they  just... Keep trying to go after your eyeballs
so.. the best way to kill fly in your house is to keep a dead fly and put it on tour around the house?
Maybe I won't clean those dead flies off my window sill.  It might actually deter new flies from coming in.
This is strange that flies die when they see others dead.🤔☠️
I'm surprised they didn't speculate on the evolutionary advantage that this behavior might confer. They explained the 'how' yet barely touched on the 'why' of this process. I had to read into the comments to see some examples of how this adaptation may provide an evolutionary benefit to the fruit fly.
"Lord of the flies"
When they see another fly dead, they are reminded of their own mortality.
Because death still around
My question is how they sre these flies brains  and analyze them
They don't. Reporting.
So if I put their past friends and fam on toothpicks on display it actually does something!
So when i swat flies i should leave them so that the rest of them drop too. This might be a life hack.
I think we all owe Kodak an apology
What happened to the good looking hosts
This explains why there are no funeral directors in the fly world.
so they die from stress and depression after seeing their fallen fellows, basically.
fruitfly: *dies* other fruitfly: "and i took that personally"
Ok so I will hang corpses of mosquitoes in front of my windows so they will avoid my home at all costs
So using the corpse of flies I can keep other flies away... just call me Vlad the impeller.
I guess this is a bonus if you work with children. No death to see. I'm going to live to 120.
"Die When They See ..." is clickbait. That they live e.g. 77% as long as otherwise, is not the same as dropping dead.
I think the main question should be where you got blind flies or flies that have no sense of smell. Did you get regular flies and blind them?
So do coroners weigh less and have shorter lifes ?
So wouldn't a pretty obvious possibility be that seeing dead things like you and not being able to get away from it might make the flies stressed, over-stimulated trying to escape and ultimately getting worn out and pained without repairing properly.  Stress would explain all of the results noticed in the dead-exposed flies.  It sounds logical that if things just like you are lying dead nearby, that whatever killed them might kill you too, so a stress reaction to make you leave would be beneficial.  But in an unusual human-derived situation where you can never escape your situation you stay permanently stressed and alert and over-exerting, so deteriorate.  Which isn't worth coding for in nature as you don't naturally find situations where something as agile as a fly can't get away from.  Versus the benefit of avoiding deadly areas.
It is extremely interesting to me that worker bees seem to have a program in them that causes them to die off way sooner if a new queen has been raised in their presence - because as soon as that queen is mated, she'll start laying eggs of a different genetic makeup to the bees around her who are her sisters. It's programmed replacement of one set of genes by another. On the other hand, generally when new queens are raised, the next thing that happens is a swarm - the new queen leaves the hive and takes a part of the workers with her to build a new hive. The queen can't build a new nest on her own, she needs the workers for that, and then she can start laying eggs but she still needs the workers to raise her larvae. Considering the process from egg to bee takes about 18 days... 3 to 6 weeks seems like a bit of a tight schedule to me. Bees will start dropping dead as soon as the first new bees emerge. And that's not to mention the workers who stayed in the hive, who are still needed by the queen who stayed.
I didn't even know they did...
wow I knew it seemed better when i smushed flies to sometimes leave their dead corpses around in the summer, always seemed to get less around if i did that
Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like apples...
If I had dead people around me, I would also get depressed and want to die!
So the best fly trap is just setting up fly paper... and leaving their hanging corpses as a message.
Has anyone done a study to see if funeral directors live the same length of time as everyone else? I’d actually be morbidly curious to see the numbers…
You gotta come tell the flies over here they oughta be dying 😂
The thumbnail of this video looks like a dog without eyes, I cannot unsee it😢
me seeing alive humans...guess I die..
Fascinating! 💜
Just say it! They're TRAUMATISED 😂😂
birdbox but for flies
This is an interesting revelation. However, can I comment on the video itself? When gaps and natural pauses are edited out as in this video, it makes it difficult to listen to. Brief pauses are not only necessary for the speaker to take breaths, they are also necessary for the listener to absorb what they are hearing. When these are edited out (presumably to keep the duration to a minimum), it results in a continuous stream of unbroken monologue that is both hard to take in and rather irritating no matter how interesting the subject. In this case, I had to abandon the clip at 4:56. It's the difference between talking TO someone and talking AT someone. It's like being shot at with a verbal machine gun.
Hasn't the serotonin hypothesis been disproven quite a while ago?
Wow
What if it's just stress
I wonder how this correlates to humans and the effect of working somewhere like a nursing home or paliative care facility negatively affects us (espessially with the abysmal pay these usually for profit places pay their workers) Edit: or a morgue for that matter. (Though I cant speak to their pay)
Okay! Now we need a death compilation video!!!!!
That is the most horrifying thumbnail 💀
Wow. Almost got to have half the video dedicated to shilling. About time to change the channel name to shill scishow & shill w/ads!
Breaking news: Watch your homies die, it'll F you up.
You are a fantastic presenter 😊
I thought flies have their own version of Werther Effect when I saw the thumbnail. XD
"Yo matt how you doing?- oh.. you're dead.."  "👦"  "🧓"  "⚰️"
Well, as a person who lives in Australia, I guess it's time to stick a dozen dead flies on my window and also hang a bunch on my door frame like a pirate cove.
You mean there was an easier way to do this all along?
lol they built a fly haunted house
Me when I ask a morgue worker how he's doing.
Presenter excellent
kill flies in front of your windows and let the corpse on sight to send a message
So i need to harvest dead flies, display them so new coming flies in home dies fast
So crucifying flies isnt all that awkward anymore.
I wish the same happened with mosquitos as with flies.
0:48 how very klingon of them 😅
So, you are telling me, I should leave a forest of dead fly effigies to make a self-feeding loop to combat the fruitflies in my compost *and* I get to cosplay as Vlad Dracula while I'm at it? Sign me up.
So....flies...like to die?
Biologists these days really being like "hmmm... do flies get death anxiety? Better check by measuring altercations in their CO2 production."
note to self: keep dead flies on the kitchen countertops
great thumbnail
Now... Can this be trained to house flies?   I'll hang em out like the British hung pirates.
5:32 That was extremrly satisfying!
So your saying we can do without pesticides now and instead just need a bunch of dead flies? Ummmm LOL?
The flies in Australia do not do this at all.
Flies are a cult
Or maybe it's the romeo-juliet syndrome... One dies, the other dies too.
Time flies like an arrow, fruit flies like bananas.
This is a security feature for the swarm. That is so whatever caused the death of the fly, for example, toxins or insecticide, won't be brought to the swarm by the fly that came in close contact with the dead fly.
Wish the flies in my apartment would see their dead brethren and die.
Blind people don’t live longer.
Lost the context between fruit flies and normal flies.. were the blind ones still a form of fruit? Feel like it's a limited group but sounded like all flies in the end..
So all I need to do is make an example of one
Hello darkness my old friend...
Fly 1: "oh crap, you guys! I think we forgot to die! Brad over there is dead.."   The other flies: "oh damn your right wtf"  *dies*
gives a new meaning to "dropping like flies"
Anyone else use those flytraps where the fly goes into a bottle of water and can't get out? In the summer time those this fill up solid with dead flies.
hold a fly underwater 5 minutes it will appear dead, if you then cover it with a small pile of salt, another 5 min. it will "come back to life".
Nahh fam cuz why don’t the flies at MY HOUSE die when I leave their buddy’s dead body on the floor for them to see 😤 why don’t I have normal flies 😡
So I SHOULD? leave them out as an example to the others?😮
Does the metabolic state that occurs when smelling food confer energetic benefits, like the human stress response?
5:49 Time flies ... like an arrow, but fruit flies like a banana
Good video except for the caveat that they didnt mention the serotonin hypothesis of depression is receiving less and less support while other more multifaceted theories are cropping up.
i bet the only reason she said "it's not a study about the flies' feelings or behaviors" is so people forget the scientists tormented innocent flies for research
Soooo... to fight a plague of fruit flies we should use a psychological tortures? 🤔
I’m just imagining a funeral director handing out 20% off if you can recommend a friend leaflets at the wake.
Is this with most flies? Mainly fruit flies? Average house fly? My grandma’s home back in rural Louisiana gets absolutely swarmed every summer (fruit flies and house flies). I’m thinking maybe she should leave a few dead ones in a jar and see if they start mass dying?
I suddenly had an urge to scream and 10000 million voices screamed with me and faded across the galaxy...
I think the fruit flies in my basement missed the memo.....they're breeding like, well, flies and I'm throwing away so many fly strips and so many bowls of vinegar every day. I'm going bonkers trying to get rid of them!
can I kill flies by killing flies? like can I just leave dead flies so the others go away or die? hahaha
Does this mean sticky paper gets more effective over time as more flies gets stuck on it and die?
When I went to my grandpas funeral my uncle said that I look older than my older siblings. I thought that was weird. Can my depression age me? Although I felt like I was dying years before I became suicidal because of my Lyme disease.
Good way to avoid spreading disease.
Do a piece on false positives and urine testing. I'd like to know why I'm detecting positive across a mutli-spectrum test when I haven't taken or been exposed to those chemicals? As workplace testing presumes guilt, should I just kill myself?

How about when old couples die after there partner passes?
Flies also usually are often born in bursts, after a cold spell, a heat burst, a sudden bloom of food so *MANY* eggs get laid. It's like saying why are there so many deaths in old age homes, compared to the rest of the city. Flies also only live 15-30 days, so *ALL* the fly deaths in March were flies born in February (Or March). Also, given the chance to feast on a fly who had died (Possibly from poison or disease) or not eating, I'd probably die too :p
Weird  because  here in Maine, I have never seen the annoying  flies die after they see flies dead ok flies strip not even days later
She's really annoying a 6 minute video to explain this really I think I'll see what it says on a search result...The study, published in the open access journal PLOS Biology, shows that a specific group of brain cells in the fly, called R2 and R4 neurons, are activated when flies encounter other dead flies, and that this increased activity leads to more rapid aging.Jun 15, 2023
so hey, let's roll this info over to mosquitos. please make them go away.
u non-binary bruh?🤔
Get these bastards out of my kitchen.
My dislike of dusting and sweeping fully validated. I was right all along.
Savannah, you are delightful! I love watching your video, no matter the topic 😊
Maybe it's just stress.
Fly therapy? That sounds like something from Rick and Morty. :D
Serotonin make you died faster. Got it
Legends says that Buddha sees sick and dead people and then he become religion leader  maybe we would have Fly Buddha because of this
No part of breeding is fun?  Maybe for you...

Top ten saddest anime deaths 😢
I will put a fly’s head on a toothpick
Sooo ... the idea is seeing someone of your species dead indicates you are in danger and so you live your life in fast mode to get as much out of it as possible before you die? And the living-longer-when-eating-less thing is the reverse, wherein not having the necessary resources to live your life fully, you instead choose to live in slow-mo, preserving resources until you're able to live a full life? Do these traits extend to aspects such as dieting, fasting, sleep and hibernation?
Like when someone throws up and the makes the person next to them vomit too
iknew leaving the dead flies I killed as warning 2 the others was actually working... now it's scientifically proven ..😤 damn it feels good 2 be a gangster
Wth is with that thumbnail though 🤣
What I want to know is what possible evolutionary advantage could this have given them? Avoiding their dead makes sense, since if the dead flies were poisoned or diseased the living flies risk infection. Slowing the aging process when food is in short supply makes sense too since they would need to conserve energy until they can find a suitable place to breed.  The ONLY possible advantage for the species I could see this giving is if, say, there WAS a virus or parasite killing fruit flies, living flies staying put and dropping dead might decrease the rusk of spreading that disease to other flies. But that's just speculation.
this could be. or... possibly... it seems... no amount of dead flies in our area to kill the live ones. I don't believe this.
The title made me question whether I'm dyslexic 😅
I will take advantage of this new knowledge since the fruit fly invasion is bad this year.
So you’re saying all I have to do to get rid of flies is kill only one of them?
Dudes I just saw this and I’m now dead💀
Now I want to know how Brundlefly would react.
Beneficial for humans though.
Me eing corn:😕 Chinese tu young 🌱 Kid named nelson 🤣
So what you’re saying is that I have to change the sticky part of my fruit fly trap more often. Got it.
You learn something new everyday.
So to finally stop the fruit fly infestation at my work place is to get some dead fruit flies.?
Top tier thumbnail
Finally, a vindication for my flypaper jacket!
My coworkers who leave dead flies around in the breakroom must know this.
…I didn’t realize that every time I splatter a fly that I’m destroying a billion years of evolution in their brain that has produced such incredible neuro chemicals like Serotonin and Dopamine…
I hope that works on mosquitoes too
My question is why? What’s the evolutionary reasoning for this behavior? :0
I kind of knew this already because in summer when I kill a bunch of flies that keep landing on me the more you kill the less flies I seem to get landing on me. And it’s not just because I’ve killed all the flies around me it seems to last for hours and hours before swarms of flies start landing on me again. So I’ve just assumed that the flies could smell the death around me and decide. not to land on me
seratonin? never met her 😔
Even flies have some emotions.
Oh so when Fruit Flies sees it's comrades dying They can assume that there's nothing healthy going around food wise And Thusly drop all their fat storages as if purging any poisons in an attempt not to be poisoned themselves and to find a place for the next generation to live healthy,   But When I Or Others see unhealthy food, we still want to eat it ?!?!!! What's up with that?
Death is contagious for them huh
Wow, the harsh effects of stress
This is a thing?
1:52 interesting
welp, time to play bug mafia
This is like a lovecraftian horror story. Suddenly people who see death start aging faster. This is horrifying
scattering dead flies through the house rn
not to burst your bubbles on your whole topic about dead flies, but this is wrong, i work in a restaraunt in summer we have a bad fly problem in the kitchen they seem to be in the bathroom the most, we kill a good amount of them , but more seem to come and not die, same with the fruit flies, so this theory is wrong..
❤❤❤
I do the opposite when I type "iseedeadpeople"
A lot of legitimate modern research is pointing towards the notion that most life is far more self aware & conscious than we have given it credit for. I think we don’t really understand neural networks, and our early estimates of things like insect awareness were grossly underestimated.
Punjab forever!!!!
Damn bro, I must have some mutant fruit flies in my kitchen then.
ill die faster under stress too
Err, so they subjected the flies through psychological stress and trauma. Uh ... yeah, that would shorten their livespan.
Same thing happens to my house plants.. when one dies, they all die.
I need to buy tons of dead flies
Time to print out a giant poster for all the flies to see.
Jumpscare thumbnail
Time flies, one cannot. They fly too fast.
I clicked for the absolutely iconic thumbnail
I feel like I recognise her voice, but not her appearance. 🤔
So you're saying if I have a fruit fly problem, killing one of them and not cleaning up will get rid of the rest?
This ain't science... I have so many flies around me every single day... This is B.S. don't believe this.. B.S. science
It's usually because those dead flies are stuck to a fly trap, and the other flies want to join their friends thinking they're gathered eating something tasty.
Could it be somekind of fungus growing on the dead fly and infecting others? Once there's a dead fly, it becomes petri dish to grow fungus in large quantity, which then releases pores in high quantity
That thumbnail is horrifying
I've never heard of flies dying from the sight of dead flies.
Do they ?
It is psycho to collect dead flies to externinate more? Asking for a friend
Time flies like an arrow. Fruit fries like a banana.
Thanks for the hack. Now I just have to kill the fruit flies and keep their body visible.
Is it only fruit flies? I think I have seen flies play dead after I have killed a bunch. Also, wasn't there a study where if people suffer a bit of hunger during their developmental years, their kids are like 20+% less likely to suffer heart disease? This kind of reminded me of the widowhood effect, as well.
There’s been more and more good science coming out showing how so many things we used to think were part of the human domain only are actually wide spread all across the animal kingdom. From aspects of language and tool use, to forms of self recognition and grief rituals, complex emotions etc. And not just in higher primates. It’s humbling, and good to see much of this research come out. It’s also honestly not that surprising to me that we just aren’t as special as we think, yet again. But it can be disturbing in some ways too.
Wish this happened with ordinary flies.
So flies are like dwarves and have tantrum spirals?
This individual gives off the same energy as the other Sci show host. The guy with the fohawk that screams 2003. I dig the vibes!
The impression I got from the summary of those studies is not that the flies just start dying. To me it seems more like flies which see a dead fly start consuming resources and speeding up their metabolism, which is an evolutionary advantage since it allows them to get more stuff done in the short time they have, as whatever killed that other fly could end up being their doom too. It's more of a "I'm going to die anyway so might as well just spend it all" type of thing. The acceleration of death is just a side effect, and not the end goal.
Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.
Scientist 1: What would happen if we gave the flies a crushing mortgage and told them they are ugly?  Scientist 2: 🤔 Let's find out.
I wish roaches did this...
so if we put a bunch of flies on spikes like a head on a pike we can get rid of them?
Not really fly-related, but I used to do music therapy in a nursing home’s memory loss unit. Many of the patients were living there with their spouse. When their spouse would pass away, the living spouse would almost always decline very rapidly. It’s easy to see how tempting it is to just give up when you see the world moving on despite your loss, grief, and despair.  So many of these elderly people heartbreakingly loved Skeeter Davis’s song “The End of the World.”
This conclusion could be misinterpreted in that either the flies died sooner from the additional stress of being near flies that were dead for some unknown reason which would even stress humans or even a bad testing methodology where they kill some flies with a toxin and find other flies die when they get close.  Seems more logical than smelling death kills which would be a self perpetuating pest control.  Heck, we are already clearly aware of how damaging constant stress can be to any system.
Grieving sounded like breathing and I was so fucjin confused I had to look at the transcript
I too avoid corpses of my fellow species.
When my wife farts i feel like I'm dying
Time flies like an arrow.   Fruit flies like a banana.
What I wanna know is: Would it be effective to place the flies you kill with a swatter on the windows to deter other flies trying to come in?
Dare ya to do a control group with humans.
The thumbnail 😂😂😂😂😂😂
now we know, I’ll keep dead flies in my house as a decor
That biomechanical function clearly isn't working in my home.
This might be the same as with humans dying from a broken heart
Witnessing death makes one avoid it because you would get stressed and thus age faster.   Wow!! Such a groundbreaking research to make a full video about!!  SciShow you can do better.
"Guess I'll fly."
I wonder if Undertakers have shorter lives??? I should always wait until after the whole video has played, Before posting my ponderances'... LOL Peace
I really like young Geary!  Such an amazing way with the camera!
soooooo..... if I place little plastic flies on toothpicks allover the house, will this warn off invading flies?  Vlad Tepes approved pest control, anyone?
0:47 that’s a mood
Quick , get those flies some fly prozac and grief counseling !
Do you think its kind of a "scorched earth" approach in front of sickness ?
When I worked in an assisted living facility for the elderly, we found that putting a dementia resident with more cognitively aware individuals made the dementia seem to "spread" rather than having the opposite intended effect. Not saying it's contagious, but... WTF? I wonder if this is a similar thing, not a contagion, but definitely an  influence.
Time flies like an arrow; Fruit flies like a banana!
I didn't know flies have brains
After finding out that the same feel good hormones humans get from getting a hug is the same thing that turns crickets into locus when starving; the fact Flys can die from depression doesn't seem like a big surprise.
When I was a teenager I killed a fly on my bedroom ceiling once and the body stuck there. I was too lazy to get a chair to climb up there and clean the body up so I jokingly just said it would be my proverbial head on a pike to scare off the other flies.  I guess I wasn't joking after all.
I'm gonna keep all the dead flies I find on a wall to ward off other flies.
Yeah let me just grab my swim trucks outta my pocket😂
This connection between sight and death just sparked my imagination.
Time to start leaving a couple dead soldiers on the windowsills.😂
imagine your 20 years old and see a dead body then become a 70 year old
4 hours ago
So bees will wrack their life if they are around a sister being raised to be future queen? Totally explains why Harry married that wench

I tried showing a Karen a dead Karen. She tried calling God.
5:40 that is one cool animation
Actually, humans /can/ die from grief, it's just really rare. Extreme distress causes the fibers around the heart to snap, and if enough do so quickly enough, the heart with infarc.
"black and floppy"... So they swarmed him when he was taking out his black floppy object from his pants.... Mkay
Also why cockroaches decides to die to no reason.
Ok, but how can this information be useful for dealing with a fly infestation
If you see your entire family dead ya I'd be like  eh f*** it! I'm out!
No flies were harmed during the making of this video.
Imagine, there would be alot more flies if it wasn't for that. So don't feel too bad
If I see a dead bug in the corner of the room, I leave it there for a while, assuming it will keep other bugs away.
I find that leaving their heads on a pin works best with fruit flies, slow torture for ants, crucifixion for neighbors, and slow burning for mosquitos. Works much better than repellent.
Theres a common belief that when one partner in a couple die from old age, the other soon follows. Could it be that humans have a similar trait that we dont know about ?????
Yay Savannah!
Well like a wise commenter on Youtube once said: "Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana"
Very entertaining I must say 🤔
I appreciate this video but it’s irresponsible to have someone fat narrate an educational video:(
I'm just going to leave dead flies all over my house now. Live flies will find themselves in a house of horrors.😂
This also makes you think about how useful flies as model organisms for humans. How true is the idea that intermittent fasting will make a human life longer if apparently flies have some special neurons that make then live longer or shorter in special situations.
I'd like toknow more about these Scrub Jays.
I wish it worked on mosquitoes , i would keep few dead mosquitoes by my side
If a bunch of dead bodies are lying around living people for even a couple of days, there is a serious risk to those people of cholera or other diseases of rot. Flies may have similar diseases, and I hope the researchers investigated that.
Flies die when they are killed.
Great, let's leave dead flies out as one way to control them?
Time Flies like an arrow.  Fruit flies like a banana.
Fascinating!
Okay Savannah, you asked for it ...  Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.
This proves that you learn something new everyday
Fruit fly *dies  another fruit fly: guess I'll die  The title should be a bit specific. Cause I don't see some of them happening on normal house fly. Though I see normal house fly get scared? When a lot of them are killed.
Wow, another reason not to see my grandparents! Thanks 👍
The ones on my kitchen refuse to die, even though it's already a graveyard
Just fruit fly diee when they saw fellow fly died?
I love this show, i hope hank gets better, but i love u all yall!
“…time flies.” Jail. Straight to jail
It would be interesting to see an experiment spanning multiple generations, keeping track of environments, living quality and circumstance. Impossible I know, but imagine if we discovered the ageing process was linked to something mundane like milk. Turns out anyone that had ever had milk (Which is everyone, even the lactose intolerant since you need to try it to know if there is an intolerance) was doomed to age. Why am I saying this? To hell if I know.
What if a fly sees an old lady swallow another fly?
my room has 30-70 dead fruit flies splat onto the walls. they will get the message.
It's Pat!
Who thought the tumbnail was a dog from afar.
Aha! So I'm not wasting my time by crucifying flies!
Elderly couples that die within weeks or months of each other make me think they missed their spouse too much to live on.
They do when they go to check out their dead mates on my flypaper......
I thought that was Scarra lol
I scream when I see dead people too.
Okay, I want to know how dying at the sight of a fellow dead fly contributes to species survival. That's the only way I can make sense of this mechanism. Otherwise I can see evolutionary pressures forcing these flies to extinction.  If flies survive longer during food scarcity, I can understand because the flies might outlast the famine and survive to mate again. During times of plenty, they can afford to "Eat, drink, and be merry; for tomorrow we die."
I wish mosquitoes were like this.
I knew many insects avoided dead relatives of theirs, but flies dying is a new bit of info.
wanna go on a date anyone?
Honestly relatable.💀
Understandable
ah yes giving flies depression. science is funky
Great thumbnail
A tiny couch for flies is definitely Not cute. 😬💀😵😑
New, kinda demented way to help get rid of flies just dropped, I guess
That fly literally said 💀💀💀
Well this is encouraging
Wait, so it won't work on house flies? Damn, the title gave me hopes for nothing...
Great, now I have Monty Python's Meaning of Life: Autumn scene in my head now.

Fruit fly depression 😢
only fruit flies… when theres a fly problem i keep a pile of their dead bodies to deter the others but it doesn’t work
--disinterested-- uninterested Look them up.
When you smell so bad your homies die when they smell you
I hate those little freaks, keep em' dead!
OMFG flies are so dramamic
I think it's funny that you all try to talk like each other 😅
No. No. Don't do this to humans. We saw what happened with lobotomies.
So killing flies and leaving their bodies to send a message really DOES send a message? Damn.
guess I'll start hiding dead flies around the house...
Came for factoids, stayed for the NB vibes.
so if a person never learns of death they could become immortal, got it.
Sooo does this mean I should leave the dead flies in my house alone?
so empathy
I've been depressed and suicidal for so many years, but physically I'm very healthy. It'd be interesting to see the correlation in humans.
i heard "grieving is a difficult process" as 'breathing' and was so confused until i went back and replayed it with cc 😂
Nice...now we know how to kill more bugs... put their dead on display.
Fly depression...that's sad.
love the thumbnail lol
placebo effect on flies imo
I can imagine an evolutionary advantage.  If the flies live long enough to reproduce.  If there are dead flies around, it indicates a natural selection event of some kind. To improve the evolutionary chances of species survival you want obviously more genetic variability.  If the rate of genetic mutation is mostly fixed through protein kinetics, then you want a faster generation.  By having flies die more quickly they consume less resources and if their reproduction capability is fairly fixed, having less competition for recourses between generations is going to increase genetic variability.
“Time flies” I can’t, they’re too fast.
Just fruit flies? Literally.....ALL flies need to die like that.
I must collect many dead flies to kill the others... :: goes fly hunting ::
This could be explained by a general strategy in invertebrates which seeks to reduce competition between adults and juveniles. Many invertebrates go to extreme lengths (butterflies, moths, beetles, etc. may be examples) to make sure that juveniles and those of a reproductive stage don't compete. If a fly notices others of its conspecifics dying there may be a mechanism that triggers a sort of self-sacrificing chain of events especially if that individual had already mated and reproduced (or at least laid/fertilized eggs). The result of this would mean less competition for their offspring which correlates to a greater chance of their genes being passed on. It would act as a self-regulating mechanism, at least within certain parameters.
Hmmm how would this work evolutionarily? would dying near other dead flies reduce the spread of disease? there must be importance of this trait. Or that not experiencing seritonin improves survival??? at least for invertabrates
I would not be shocked if we found out there’s some weird systems theory equilibrium which creates a healthier overall environment when species live and die together. Maybe it’s really universal or very particular to one or another states. Interesting research direction though.
could be an adaptation against disease or poison. 1. avoid dead bodies since they might have died from disease/poison 2. if you do come in contact with them, let's decrease your lifespan (as a function of time and amount of dead bodies) in case you caught something to prevent you from spreading it to others
Well now I have another tool in my kit to commit mass murder of flies.
Fruit fly that went left: “All around me are familiar faces… 🎵
Maybe it's less about that they die sooner and more about them living faster, like maybe their metabolism gets faster when they see dead flies because they think that they have to reproduce quicker since they might die sooner from whatever killed the other flies.
thats so weird............
I had a theory when I was a teen. That we die because we have known about death.  That is, if a human is deprived it's entire life of the concept of death it could live forever. Or at least longer. But the concept of death is all around us. Plants, animals, stars, etc. Then I did an experiment that I'm still running, with myself and my girlfriend has been a second subject without her knowing about it. I expose myself the less possible to the real outside world and I eliminate every single mirror or way I could see myself. For decades. I don't see my progresive aging or my image in pictures or videos or reflections. I think that the image I have in my mind of myself can help me age slower or faster depending of what I think. And apparently it has worked. People always get amazed or shocked when they find out how old I really am (I sometimes even forget my real age because it is something I don't care about). My girlfriend is having a similar effect on herself due to all these little things I do.  I remember reading as a teen about an effect dogs had called "The Peter Pan syndrome" or effect, I don't recall. Which said that dogs hindered their growth the more one would threat them as puppies. The more you threat your dog like a little dog the less it grows, the less it shows adult features, it stays puppy like, which was a fascinating effect to me.  Now I see this study about flies which I didn't know anything about and I find it gascinating and see some relation to my ideas. I'll research it further. It would be fascinating to learn that humans, just like animals, have similar effects. A study worth seeing would be to see how people surrounded by young people age, like Dan Bilzerian for example or Hugh Hefner. Did they slow their aging process by being surrounded by young humans? Would they have aged faster if they didn't surround themselves with young people? Studies like these would be fascinating, even if they show no correlation or relation at all. We already know people can die faster or slower depending of psychological issues, like retiring for example, or having a spouse die. OBVIOUSLY there's something going on in the brain with regards to aging. It is NOT a steady process, it fluctuates.
So you're telling me that I should never take out the flies that I kill so the others see them and die faster? Who'd have guessed.
I'm going to have to start stringing up dead flies in my windows.
I didn’t even know they did that
insects grieving sounds like the pitch for a new quirky pixar short 😅
What if people are secretly like bees and we just need to all become anarchists to become immortal
I don't know if this video is part of a coincidence, or our phones are listening to us (or both). A few hours ago, my niece pointed to some dead flies congregated on a counter and asked, "why are there dead flies sitting together on the counter?". I later jump onto youtube and this is the first video in my feed
This is new info to me. If I knew this I would have stuck a fly's head on a miniature stake as an example.
Dang nature, you're weird.  I love it!
Exposing flies to their dead comrades to see what happens reminds of that Onion article where they teach a gorilla about the horrifying emptiness of existential dread
"time flies" gdi that was good
Scare a person with a dead body and you can induce a sudden case of the being deads so not entirely true… 💀
tfw we are giving flies trauma uncool tho science
Even though it is later explained away, the anthropomorphism of the initial descriptions here is really a-scientific and reveals problems with, if not science vocabulary, then certainly the vocabulary of science journalism.  But then who'd be surprised by that.
Andy milinakis did a great job narrating, props
This is awesome!
egg
Guess the flies who have ever seen a thestral are few and far between, ha ha!
Does this justify aromatherapy?
Can we take a moment to give credit to the person whose hand was steady enough to first study the brains of fruit flies? Imagine how hard it was to hook their tiny fruit fly heads to equally tiny electrodes to study their brainwaves.
I've seen flies be very interested in fly swatters. Weird.
I think Savannah is an excellent host and am always happy to see them.  Well spoken, not rushed, clear, and concise!
So the little old lady that swallowed the fly should have eaten another fly?  😁
Flies too must come to terms with their own mortality, some do not fare so well
Comparing these results to funeral home workers is not an adequate comparison for obvious reasons. It should be compared to forensic pathologists in which case the results do share commonalities. Also senior care workers have been shown to develop the same ailments as their patients including especially Alzheimer’s disease.
If you live with a lame man you will learn to limp.
Honestly that's super interesting. It's as if the species has had to deal with population in flux issues constantly. If eating more shortens life span is that the case to prevent overpopulation. Secondly if it physically ages the fly faster to see the dead. Does that make flys more mature to produce offspring faster?
are they just traumatizing a bunch of flies into dying lmao?
This feels like that onion video where scientists teach a gorilla that it will one day die.
I just know this chick don't play when it comes to steven universe
Can I set up a ring of dead flies around my picnics like some lame. miniature pagan ritual to ward off flies?
Tempus Fugit, been on the face of the family clock for time.
They are normally living longer to give birth to more children. When their kids get old enough or their peers die they die too so there is more food for the kids.
Guess from now on I'll leave a dead fly' body just there, a message to all other flies "This will be your fate".
Time flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like a banana.
Well i have no sense of smell so that doesn't affect me
So... It throws them into an existential crisis. Going from blissfully unaware of ones own blissful ignorance of mortality, and therefore the concept itself, to having it literally chemically seared into your brain...
So what I'm hearing is leave the dead flies there to kill the others
Informative, easily digestible video. Ty
When I read the article in Nature a month ago I did ponder whether this channel would cover it. Low & behold :D
Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana.
time to switch to dead fly wallpaper
So what you're saying is I need to buy a tiny bowl of dead fruit flies to solve my fruit fly problem?
I'll stake some dead flies on toothpicks....this is your fate pest🤣
So you're saying that a fruit fly that saw a dead fruit fly chose   poorly
You scared them to death
Stressful adulthood makes for a shorter life. Who would've guessed...
5:47 BOOOOOO
Yay a nonbinary host
If flies died when they saw all those I killed 5 mins ago, I wouldn't have had to kill them cuz 10 minutes ago I killed a bunch already... or are there trillions of these mfs invading my home?!
Should i risk asking how they got a bunch of blind flies? Not sure if i want to know the answer.
TLDR; some researcher's swimming trunks smell like a dead jackdaw.
OMG! this is the start to locking away old people from the young population. Don't tell the millennials.😊
I'm going to make an effigy out of fly head.
So I *should* leave the dead mosquitos on the wall as an example to the others
We get pain nerves in our teeth, they get  necrolimination
I remember hearing a story, i forgot which youtuber said it, but they mentioned dead wasps constantly piling up at their bedroom window. i wonder if that was something similar to this.
I guess this brings a whole new meaning to “dropping like flies” 🪰
Maybe flies have a TV show called _The Flying Dead_ and seeing dead flies makes them afraid of little buzzing zombies.
How do you scan a fly brain? I'm picturing tiny fly helmets and wires getting tangled
Omg existential dread unlocked ! 🎉 😅 I’m fine
The extent to which we can analyze and control fly brains is wild 😮
And THIS is why I keep heaps of dead flies in my house   ;)  .
The flies in my apartment must have not got the memo
The thumbnail killed me.
Now i'll create insect effigies to hopefully get rid of the other ones 😀
Actionlab ant zombie
ack-ah-mee?   I thought it was ah-kah-mee?
So basically me having all these dead flies on my windowsills is just the equivalent of me having a fence with heads on the fence posts.
Fly: *Dies of shock*
So if I want to keep my fruit basket fruit fly free I just need a pile of dead fruit flies next to it? Okay then
Hmm it can be diffrent in humans where we need to see our dead to apprecate life 😅
I wouldn't live long either if some crazed giants kept forcing me to confront my mortality by showing me the bodies of my dead friends and family.
She’s a good host. Very enthusiastic
Why didn't you talk about what the evolutionary advantage might be to dying when a fly sees death?  My guess would be that a dead companion would indicate some threat that would justify a more short term survival mode, i.e. Being more cautious about landing and flying around more and generally acting more skittish, which would help the fly avoid the threat but shorten it's remaining natural life span.
so.... stress
Humans are capable of dying from emotional stress. Just like any animal.
If i hang dead flies in my door way will they avoid going in?
Tldr its clickbait they mostly just lose some fat cells when they see dead flies barely ever die
Thank you, no more need for doom
Oh man, I feel for these little buddies I've always said: Humans are less human than we think we are. Empathy, sympathy, joy, sorrow ect ect all the things humans love to claim as being uniquely human isn't, at all, uniquely human. All of those traits are tied hand in hand with sentience, with consciousness, with just being alive regardless of species. Humans are just the only species on the planet that has the trait of being belligerently arrogant and having the capabilities of acting on that arrogance. We deny the shared traits that other species have with us, even if we are observing it in person, just because we, as a species, want to feel special and unique. At the same time, humans have an existential fear of us being alone in the universe. I've always asked myself, would humans even recognize if another species from another planet is acting just like humans if we couldn't communicate with that said species? After all, we refuse to accept that species right here on our own planet, that we can't communicate with, have traits that are shared with us
This is very cool. I love content like this...its like going back to school 😂😂😂 i learn something new everyday!!!  You are awsome❤❤😊😊 Thank you!!!
Um gotta say i think this is B.S.   flies dont die when they see dead flies,  they just all happen to be in the same place when conditions aren't suitable for life 🙄
..time, flies.  briliant!
Can I buy a projector and show images of dead flies in my faccade so that all the flies around die?
that's such a wild idea! That that process evolved because somewhere in there this issue didn't come up, or benefited them in some way.
Maybe it's to stop disease from spreading
How do scientist go about measuring seratonin? Or how do they know or create flies that can’t generate seratonin?
You guys have officially won the "Ugliest Thumbnail Award"  It will continue to be nightmare fuel for me for a while.
Old people say kids keep them young….
tldr: bugs are weird
*Sees dead homies* Fruit Flies: and I took that personally
Why are you calling flies animals? They are clearly insects...
Time's fun when you're having flies!!!
In life, flies just wing it.
Great, scientists gave fruit flies depression
So leaving a dead fly as a warning to its kin isn't just a joke- it might actually work. Alrighty then.
weird knowledge increased 🤯
So basically people psychologically tortured fruit flys with dead flys for them to drop dead.
Me:  😳😱💭     if I cover my walls in dead flies or huge pictures of dead flies then they'll just die....    😃😁 😂😂
By reading the title I thought they would drop dead instantly when seeing a dead fly but no, they literally traumatized and tormented flies by showing them dead flies over and over until it killed them.
Time flies like an arrow. And fruit flies like a banana.
So flies that are both blind and have no sense of smell don't die at an increased rate when among dead flies?  I can't imagine that these Hellen Keller flies live very long in the first place.  I
Wait, so are you saying that leaving the corpses of flies you swatted impaled on toothpicks as warning all around your apartment _actually_ works in keeping the flies away???
Guess I won’t sweep up the dead flies for a bit Help kill off the other flies
Walks outside wearing a nice black suit. Gets assaulted by jackdaws.
Yeah, I did not know that.
Scientists are horrible. I don't even want to know how they acquired those blind flies 😭
oh grieving i thought she said breathing i was like uhh no that dosnt make sense lol
The funny thing is time actually passes more slowly when you fly because your velocity has increased. It must be relative.
I saw a crow wake once. A crow died by electrocution, and there was all this cawing. Suddenly all these crows came by and were so distressed. It was like 100 or so
i shouldn’t start hanging up the dead around my house as an example
Any idea what the evolutionary pressure would be for this?
Here's a couple extra 👍for such a good vid👍
Guess I'll just litter my house with dead flies to kill the flies.
of course, animals do that but we are overthinkers, so we invented religions, tombs and stuff.
What you meant to say is 'Flies DON'T die when they see dead flies'.
makes fly paper seem like another way to kill flies. Bring out the USED flypaper and its got a second lease of service.
My Overwatch team has the same problem
I’m starting to think I should’ve avoided watching my brother give my dad cpr then him being wheeled into the ambulance. I’d probably be successful
I love science as much as the next guy, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say a fly that shares functionally 0% of its brain structure with humans  isn't going to tell us anything about human psychology....
They die cause I swat all they relatives savagely
Cool aid peer pressure.
... seems like I should only have to kill one fly and leave the body on display.
Has these results been replicated? Cause this research sounds a lot like some of the fraud we have seen in other ariers of behavioral psykologi. you have a story that sounds real good, maybe we even want to believe it is true, the data could probably easily be faked and this result would look on the authors CV, ensuring they can get funding for the next project.
Imagine living only 6 weeks. But you're used to the idea because thats your species natural timeframe.  Making plans for when you're older....4 weeks you hope to retire but that's a long time from now and you still have 14 or so days to complete your degree.
Wut! This is so weird.
guess ill start plastering the fruit flies to the walls the next time i get an infestation!!!
Sarah Tonin? I think I went to high school with her
These thumbnails are so funny! their getting way memeier and it's amazing
1:26 they were provavly shook when he proceeded to wear the dead one
proves we live in simulation
Time flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like a banana.
So propping up dead flies actually works?
c'mon, they're flies, it must have more to do with a mechanism that helps younglings have more of the scarce resources than actual feelings, it must be purely evolutionary rather than psychological
What's the life expectancy of funeral directors though? Same as that of the general population?
Awe man, it's only fruit flies? I wish it was those big green ones! 🤮
They are just stressing the flies. I'd duy 77% sooner if you keep pushing me in a room with corpses.
Should I start impaling the corpses to "send a message"? 😅
Hope "black flies/bitting gnats" have the same reaction to dead flies as the "fruit fly"
i rarely comment but this presenter is really great plz have them be a main part of the channel. also whoever wrote the episode it was perfectly fun cute and informative and more episodes written this way would be well advised thank you
5:47 Oh you flying b**ch.
that must be the best thumbnail ever!
I still dont get it why flies are so relatable that we can use them in every experiment, including space flights and depression?
I'm curious about how the mechanism evolved. That would probably tell you a lot about other aspects of what's going on.
Flies living longer when food is scarce and having a shorter life when food is abundant might have to do with being able to produce as many generations as possible when there's plenty of food to support those generations, so as to expedite their genetic evolution and exponentially increase their numbers all at once.
This is not f true 😅
Time flies like the wind!  Fruit flies like bananas.
Great, another person who pretends their gender (mental illness) hosting a show that children watch.
I have to tell you though this does not work down at the horse barn.😂
Is the aging rapid, a quick death?
I wonder if the flies try to breed more with a diminished life expectancy?  Like they recognize a dead fly, and their bodies react with a "focus more on getting some eggs layed before whatever killed this fly kills you" response?
What is it?
If I had known that, I would have left dead flies in the windows😊
What about house flies? Any way I can convince them to snort hot lead.
Funerals would get hazard pay 😂
Sooooooo...we traumatized some living creatures so hard they died.  Just kept showing em gore until it terminally got to em.  Like, we've done some pretty messed up stuff to animals, but damn.  We straight up blackpilled flies.
Your EFFING AUDIO BLASTS TOO LOUD at the very beginning and is too high the whole video. Please pay attention to this.
2:07 man i would prefer to be in a room with tons of dead flies WAYYYYYYY more than a room with tons of alive ones
Why do fruit flies continue to be a reliable reference for understanding the human experience? XD   tbh i thought this video was going to be about flies being able to see the GHOSTS of their relatives. I'm kinda disappointed lol
Thank you for the content madam.
I need to try showing Twitter a dead 20-year-old.
...wait...what????!!!!
Savannah is such a great host. I love like their casual chill vibe sometimes.
I highly recommend window nets. It saves you the hassle of catching flies and saves the fly the hassle to die by your hands.
Oh he dead…..I’m out
Fly sad and dies😢
🪰👍
When she says grieving, it sounds like she's saying breathing and it made this very annoying and confusing lol
Is it me, or does it feel like she's trying to be like Hank?
I hate this host, take her away. Ugh.
So leaving a dead fly out as a warning sign to the other flies really works?
Click bait.
Where do you find the presenters ?
Wikihow: how to traumatized flies
We had a cat that would hunt birds back when I lived in Oregon. One day she killed an adolescent scrub jay. The parents found her eating it underneath a tree and so they perched above her and scolded the ever living heck out of her. She just sat there and took the beating, staring back up at them. (And she was probably plotting how to eat them, too!) I wonder if cats can feel remorse. Jays certainly do.
God tier thumbnail
Woander that can be sustitute the dead flus with pictures.
Because they be trying to save their fly buddy that's stuck in my ribbon fly trap. I'm breeding flightless fruitflies but turns out they gained their flight back... also I think i might have crossbreed 2 different types of fruit flies.
They dont die themselves. They unalive themselves.
I literally have a cup of fruit flies in front of me with 6 baby jumping spiders. There have been dead and eaten flies in this cut for 2 days and there are still very much alive flies in the cup... I must have passed into a parallel universe. again. goddamnit. *tinkers with portal gun.
Did they morph all other SciShow hosts together to get....whatever this is?
This is very similar with crickets. If you keep some crickets in a tub, and one of them dies, they release a toxin that causes others to die around them, which release more toxins, creating a chain reaction
lmao gotta apriciate the thumbnail xD
"We buzz together, we die together"
Me literally hanging fly corpses around the outside of my home like a twisted version of fallout NV because they see and recognize dead flies.
This is why alot of people are happier without social media.
I just learned this today
It just goes to show that what humans determine as "empathy" or consciousness is far more complex and vast beyond our own perceptions.
Wow.  I wonder if this will spur more research into potential links that humans have that mimic this.
Ray Peat vindicated again!
should I leave dead ones by my plants as a warning to others?
I'm really glad science is advancing our understanding of the fruit fly grieving process. From now on, I'm going to leave an extra piece of fruit on my counter to help them get through their emotional troubles.
So, collect the flies that die on your windowsills. Place one on every window. Or, buy plastic flies to place at windows
So what you're saying is I should leave all the dead flies in my window sill to keep more flies from coming in.
My whole family died Guess I’ll die🤷‍♀️
I’m about to put some dead flies around my house on some toothpicks. I’m gonna be Vlad the impaler to these annoying flies
But breathing DOES take a bit of your life!    Free radical reactions are expected to produce progressive adverse changes that accumulate with age throughout the body.  Free radical formation occurs continuously in the cells as a consequence of both enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions. Enzymatic reactions, which serve as source of free radicals, include those involved in the respiratory chain, in phagocytosis, in prostaglandin synthesis, and in the cytochrome P-450 system.  TL;DR: Free radicals are an important part in the biological mechanisms associated with aging.
Right thats it, Im making effigies around the house next time a fly dies, im sick of the little gits
Thank you Savannah !
Whenever I'd kill a mosquito or fly, sometimes I'd leave it there, and people would ask why I didn't clean it up. My response was, "I'm sending a message."  Apparently, I was!
So leaving a dead fly as a warning to other flies actually makes sense xD
😮.I am sure that will take this information, which i never knew before, and do something with it, but there is no guarantee.
Why can't Mosquitoes do the same?
What you're telling me is the good ole "Impale the corpses of your enemies in the front yard" is an actual way of dealing with flies.
How do we know whether a specific fly is blind or unable to smell?
The fruit flies were exhibiting stress responses, which do all of those things, including the net result of shorter lifespan. So it's a clickbait title, which is fallacious.
I just want to say thank you for helping learn and know about things I never thought I would want to know! It's been enlightening and informative!
so having a fly carcass near your fruits is a sure fire way to off them
Very interesting. Thanks
stress contributes to aging. long live the nepos.
So, to get rid of flies just don't clean up the dead ones.
"Recognize death" is technically true, but too easy to anthropomorphize. The creature generally doesn't know it's death.  It just has a biological process triggered by the sensory input.
Who dis?
5:45 I see what you did there 😅
Enunciation. It sounded like you said "Reading is a complex and difficult process, and none of it was fun" and I was like "then why are you narrating a science channel?" I wasn't going to comment about it, though, because I didn't want to knock years off of your life.
Loving this new host
Aww- poor flies :( Flies and just bugs in general don’t get the credit they deserve!
So we need to kill more fruit flies
nice thumbnail choice y'all 👍
Can you do something about Iceland?
Now I’m going to capture several dozen flies and toss one dead fly into the middle of them.
New insect extermination method just dropped
I thought it said "dead files"... 😂
What a weird coincidence. Not one hour ago I was Googling why flies don't seem to care about corpses of other flies or stay away
That's good for them that's one less fly to deal with.
I wish this applied to all household flies. I kill at least 2 flies a day, maybe 1 dozen when they are particularly annoying. If this applied to household flies, I'd finally have some peace.
The flies took brotherhood to a whole new level and die when they see comrades dead
I am currently reading King Solomons Ring by Konrad Lorenz. Its a very interesting book and he tells that story about being attacked by his flock of jackdaws!
Wtf is this
Emotional damage.
What exactly am I being lectured to by?  What's the science on that?
More snacks for me ❤
Flies are emos?

Talk about being fly to death
"breathing is a difficult process" uh.. Wat?
I, too, die when I see dead flies
Hi
Okay first: What Second: The hell?
Cool
Personally I didn’t know flies died when they saw dead flies😂
What?
...what?!
