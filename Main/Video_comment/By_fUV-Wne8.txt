Spain having trouble with Georgia. Can't see them getting to the quarter-finals of the Euros.
When a Spanish player aside from David Villa, Fabregas or Torres in the past 2 decades scores from outside the box... that's the look they have on their face. What Dani Olmo looked like. At least they're shooting now. I can't handle 5 yard passes and no striker up front - boring.
Stick out a leg not turn your back on a cross man
Wow! nearly forgot that there was time  when fans used to be in stadiums.
Everyone is saying "great to see fans there". Covid 19 virus is also grateful!
Seeing feran instead of fernando😀
Never a red that
Viva España
Glad Spain won  That random geezer that scored for Georgia celebrating like he’d scored a winner annoyed me
Wheres da gea
Viva Georgia!
Had Spain not snatched the late winner they'd be in a serious situation regarding qualifying :: no point having 80% possession and not knowing how to use it !! Glory days of Spanish football are long gone
Fans!!!!!😍😍😍
Everyone says about Spain, but no one says about how Georgia dominated the first half, amazing team, they play with passion for their country
Thought that tackle ...he took the ball lol
Has anyone relised it says european qualifiers at the start when its world cup qualifiers
💔 for Georgia
Bad sportsmanship dem sore loosers
I mean to be honest, my first watch I thought Spain was puttin on White, Georgia really plays well..
Thiago made the difference
1:03 did he just whack the camera
Fans definitely make a difference
my georgian wonderkid scored thats all i care about
I'm a bit worried for Spain after these last couple games
Stay on your line goalie
These highlights don’t do Georgia justice. Their number 18 ran that left side all game and had Spain on Ropes.
Jordi Alba has been so good this season. Definitely underrated.
Ferran Torres class player so underrated
Feels so strange watching football with crowd.
ayo this spain team is washed up ngl
Spain are so bang average these days.
Dude if Georgia could have held on for the Draw it would be like winning the world cup for them
Georgia has some  fans 👌
I could yet be proved wrong but where Germany, Italy, France and Portugal have all shown development in their recent youth, this Spain team seems miles behind previous generations
These Spanish players spend more time on the floor than my carpet
Crowds in Georgia?
My boy Ferrannn !!
Georgian keeper was unlucky not to save the 2nd goal
the sound of the fans are incredible
Spain made a very lucky escape today. So many issues w their defence. They r powerless against a quick attack. There is also no material to their attacking. Pass, pass, pass then nothing.
spain fallen off
Nice to see a crowd. I presume they will all be ill next week Sky?   What do your 'experts' say?
Kvara🇬🇪
Why am I the only one who thinks that isn't a red card?
Honestly the worst Spain team in the last 30 years. When they bottled tournaments in the late 90s and early 00s they had better teams than this.
morata really thought that backhell attempt was gonna work😂
Thought the title said fernando Torres for a sec and my brain spazzed out
Who else read Fernando Torres 😢
i hate Georgia, they banned us Palestinian from traveling to it because of Israeli recommendation
imagine catching covid just to see your team lose in the 93rd minute
and its pedri on the floor not jordi alba
jheeze alba with some beautiful assists
I couldnt believe they are real fans hahahaha
Foootball without fans is nothing
I just knew Spain would grab a winner in added time! Sods law! Spain a scraping matches! I might even back Sweden finish first.
I can’t wait till this celebration is on fifa 🤣
When the fans celebrated I got chills😂
We want every game!
Georgia played well.
Why do you all people have to talk about fans
Sky sports editor said “😱” 😂😂
Nice to see fans back to the stadium ❤️
Spain are doing a massive rebuilding job without a lot of their old stars. Whether they can rebuild in time for WC next year is yet to be seen. They are also playing more direct than their usual intricate passing around.
Can't wait until Ansu fati is back he'll give that Spanish attack some more bite.
Gvilia from Legia Warsaw 🦵💪❤️
Georgia always play great,technical football,but somehow they can not qualify to the big tournament...
Is this seriously Spain's first team now IV barely heard of most of them it's like everyone says in the comments there glory days are over
Fans should be vaccinated after match
I honestly forgot how full stadiums looked like
Alba defender of the year
God they olmost drawn with a country I didn’t know existed
Fans are back 👍
What does Messi have to do to get into the Spanish team? For years he’s been the best player in the world yet Spain never pick him!
Hopefully Pedri is ok💔
Great to see fans in the stadiums
Spain squad looks under 17 years old lol  Will take them 5 to 10 years to get the level of  world cup winning team
Is tiki takadead?
Big clubs should watch out for that Georgian player called Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, he is gonna be a world class player soon.
jordi alba is the best left back this season. u cant ignore the 21 G/A hes having so far
Jordi Alba is definitely the best left back this season and so underrated. 😎 Captain 🇪🇸
I have a feeling torres will score winner and be MOTM for city in the CL final this year  Don't support city at all, I just see Torres as the next superstar that isn't be talked about enough. He is incredible and city this year will win the CL due to their strength in depth.
Fans in the stadium, Under the lights, nothing feels better that that
How did they go from on top of the world to scraping wins against georgia🤔
Oh my God there's fans in the stadium, feels so good to hear the crowds voice
When Georgia lose 2-1 S... Pain.....
Pedri played so well
That wasn’t a red, all ball
Good to have the fans back
Attacking wise alba is the best LB itw
The collapse of Spanish football jeez
We barca fans loved the 2nd half midfield  pedri busi Thiago 💙❤️😍
Georgia are good at rugby and football.
dani olmo underrated talent i would love to sign
Thiago Alcantara is so disrespected man
spain r whack
Who remembers the times when any nation who drew Spain lost before a ball was even kicked🤯
Adama
Do I see fan ???
Am I the only one who sees the resemblance between Olmo and a T-Rex?
Why is there a red after every game
so good to see fans
FANS 😍😍
Ferran torres is underrated
TERRIBLE CHALLENGE. Game was lost then a awful challenge on a player that is so highly rated.. Rightly a sending off..
Unlucky Georgia, Spain look a shadow of themselves nowadays
Be interesting to see how Spain do over the next few years now that their golden generation has passed! 😎
Just  nice to watch a game with fans
Georgia ‘Olmost’ got a draw
How far have Spain fallen? The way they Celebrated that winner like it was the final! It's a WC Qualifier against a team ranked 90th!
Spain are absolutely awful compared to what they used to be. Seriously poor quality throughout.
Play de gea
Imagine the scenes of Georgia had held onto that 1-0 lead
Amazing to see fans !
Penchored
Bit weird seeing fans lol xD
Personally, I not so confident on Spain 🇪🇸 qualifying for the Qatar World Cup. Draw at home to Greece 🇬🇷 and the scrap past Georgia 🇬🇪
That thiago pass for the second goal🥵🥵
You forget how good it is having fans until you watch this
Spain counting on their youth nowadays
What TV series is everyone watching??
*FANS!!!! YAAAAY!*
Nice to see fans in the stadium!!! We still cannot have people in our  garden yet!!
Bravo skysports for how quickly they upload highlights 👏 can't wait until fans are back watching football live 🙌
How can my people be beating Germany 7-0 and yet they're struggling to beat Georgia? Can't take the win away from Spain tho.  Oops, it was actually 6-0. Sos Milan Mathew.
Ferrán for Spain is like Rooney for United.
Spain have such good youngsters Olmo, Torres, Pedri, Fati and many more they will be world class hopefully, very entertaining team to watch
Jordi Alba was class today 👏👏🔥🔥
What a goal by Torres
Beat my bet rats
Love watching Ferrán for Spain
So good to see fans
5th comment
Good match 👍
England are better
Jordi Alba is the best left back in the world right now. Man literally carried today
