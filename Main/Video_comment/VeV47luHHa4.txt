Mabel to late to ask, but when will you drive this on a frozen lake Colin?🫡
I really want to make the bolt one but don’t have the materials ! 😂😂😂
Oi! Furrrrze    ..leave them sheeps alone!
Please make a full suspension version. I mean the real deal. Hydraulic disc brakes,  rock shox , 1 to 11 gears the hole nine yards.
At least they dont have to aerate the grass
Metal wheels bro oh
You should put an helmet on your idea maker/knowledge center!
New to your channel, I got hooked on the tunnel video. Just watched this one and thought some steel fenders to protect you from the studs would be easy for ya. Just a thought. Thanks for the content keep up the great work. Cheers!
What do you do whit all the Ather builds
take it on an ice ring, would be mega
Furze your a touch insane but I love your style!
You need a snowmobile ski which has a skag to help it turn! I bet it doesn't turn very well right now!
😂😂 I THINK WE NEED THE SNOW DANCE 😂😂
4:06 colinfurze moment
You’re awesome
i’d love to see this on some real snow. snow you can’t see the grass underneath type snow. that or a frozen lake would be sick
You can tell if someone is having a good life, are they subscribed to colinfurze?
I like the music
I think what you may want is a snowmobile.
regular skis dont steer very good, snowmobile skis have things call carbides to help you steer on trails/little snow.
Put a front ski from a snowmobile on it!!!
Is that Jeremy Wade's place? 😁👍
Wat a life to have him as your dad lol always fun
Colin!  Another fantastic video!!!  Cheers!!!
Awesome👍
If this man ever applied for a job and they ask to see his engineering profile all he would need to do i send the link to YT
i aspire to be this man. a true jack of all trades
that song reminds me of number one from lazy town
It’s snowtrike now lol
🐄
where do you keep all of your contraptions?
Almost a Colin furze grind hard plumbing co. mash up.
6:20 sheeps: say hello         Collin:🐴
That "snow dance" had me dying
Drift quad$
Come judgement day ...when the big H bomb drops please please can I be in the fall out shelter with Colin.....air purifier broke .....WHERE IS .....COLIN! cleaver man
Why does the song sound to me like either trying to sound like "we are number 1" or trying NOT to sound like "we are number 1" and failing either way
Missed an opportunity with this one: "Snowdrift Trike" Because snowdrift... and drift trike...
love the trikes, have yet to see a FWD trike from you  could have been a direction for the snow trike
omg its soooooo cool
i would actually pay for a detailed course made by you that shows everything from every little tiny screw mounted to the big motor and your thoughts etc...
colinfurze how about you make a hover kart with jet thruster that is my dream car :333
Safety sqints engage!!
swap the engine for a Ducati motor and LOSE the dirt bike motor!
Hi HOPE You Are Well Please Will You Help Me Make My Manual Wheelchair Snow Friendly, Maybe Something With a Ski Attachment Or Sled Over The Small Front Wheels? MANY Thanks
How much can I buy it for
Needs more snow
You should make a gasofier powered drift trike!
use it on ice
It seems like it would have been more logical to use two skis like a snowmobile.
I'm just suprised he's still alive
Where does he get all those wonderful engineering toys?
Awesome! (Need a fifty something apprentice?)..... 🤣
You are so cool.
snow dance
Collin you can be a superhero if you wanted to....😎...your like megamind 👍😂
I carnt find the tutorial to.make it
♥️ Great video ! The video is a masterpiece ♥️
That poor mans field
Instead of using spike on the wheels u should have welded on paddles
w2wwwwwwwwwwwwww
use on the ice
Sheep enter screen *plays horse noises* 🤔
I want to see him take this on ice
TRY MAKE A DESSIL DRIFT TRIKE
Can.  You.  Make.  A.   Motorcycle.   With.   Spikes.  On.    The.   Wheels
needs lil fenders for this action!
Where can I buy the same endgine that you have
He should weld a cover for the wheels but only on the top
What if Colin made everything he has made into a wood version😂
오~~~~
He scared all those poor horses :'(
kinda got a little bit more Furze... yes indeed.
Colin  Furze snow mobile lol
Someone, somewhere has just noticed that is their old ski...
You need to make a ghost buster car
Dance moves phenomenal.
You are  so cool
Can you please do a tutorial on how to make the electric drift trike without a welder
Amphibious drift trike?
4:07 trying to summon a demon at 3 am be like...
The dance was cool
So cool
Shepherd engineer   lÖl
Laughed out loud for the snow dance!
You should call it the “STRIKE” Bc trike+ski=strike
This guy enjoys one of the rares honors of holding up to the title "master goblin engineering"
How about adding 2 more engines to the flying machine ? Really fly !!!
you should put off road tires on it
that's totally insane!
Here in this workshop  We " furzer " your education  !  😎🇦🇺🇦🇺👏👏👍👍
man, I’ll tell you about Brazil🇧🇷, like many other people, I don’t understand anything you say, but your projects are incredible congratulations and continue like this always! 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
I want to see the snow dance again
เเรงมากครับ
อยากได้
You should race one at Le Mans!
Colocar legenda em português porfavor
I was wondering why Colin was happy all the time-cause he's making a shit-ton of money off his videos. Good for you mate....if you find a way to get rich, why not?
Cool drift trike! Why did you make the ski point up though? It already has the curvature at the tip. Horizontal should be enough.
Now put paddles on the wheels and go to the sand dunes
Does anyone else watch these for the music? Thank you Colin
Uma inspiração de vida
Taxes now has a solution to their snow prblem
maybe something a peddle snow mobile without a motor or making a Moped motorcycle into a snow mobile
You should put blades on the ski and take it to a frozen lake and go ice racing
Please take this to somewhere where you can actually drive on ONLY snow, not a slight layer :D
can you make a hyper high pressure washing machine ? no need to have soap, just a wall of jets and clean all the dirt in seconds
Please could you tell me what mate and model is your profile cutting machine
Whenever I watch his videos half of me thinks "damn, if I had all that equipment I could build cool shit, too" and the other half thinks "yea right you don't even know the name of 3/4s of those machines, let alone what they even do or how to use them- you'd cut a finger off 2 minutes after you turned it on- if you could even do that!" me #2 is probably the right me, but well never know🤷
Dope
The trike is impressive. The most impressive thing here; Colin refuses to bow to the safety Nazis and wear approved safety gear.
New idea use the stawars flyer in a previous episode amd swap the wheels for skis
Hi ! I was a drummer and always needed to some day maybe see a flying drum. Is that possible ?
This is how golf courses should be aerated
Next time it snows try them spikes on the front ski on the back
where does he get those ideas?
Luckily you didn't blend your leg up when you fell off the back.
Hey Colin do you know if you can use gokart rear wheels on a motorised drift trike or can you only use front gokart wheels?
4:07 colin are you ok?
or make it flote
There’s one way to air rate your lawn
Make a mini motor bike
This is a serious comment and not a troll......can you explain why some parts are 3D printed and others are, well, cut out or plasma cut. I really want a good explanation and (like my brother) you are a plumber so I feel you can bring it down to earth without over explaining it.
You should make a bunkbed that can go up and down like an elevator
sheep: oh wow this thing looks cool and human looks friendly. Colin: starts up trike ski  sheep: oh sh!t we were wrong, RETREAT, RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!!!.
Colin sorry but I need me skis back
awesome!
...Skid-doo....
Great videos. Keep up the great work.
I just commented on your newest video but could you please make a badass electric bike ??
4:06 that dance 😂😂😂
I purposely don't watch a bunch of colin's vids so that I can binge watch them later lmao
Imagine being his neighbor and seeing this crazy invention with a ski you throwed away 10 years ago xD bloody respecp
Where do you buy the 2 stroke 125 pit bike engines?
How do you make all this stuff
Colin you look like that famous painter here: 6:36
Ku*wa moje pole
Easily the best channel on YouTube if not ... life! Keep it up you wonderful human 😄👍👔
You are a mad man. an awesome mad man!
Mister Furze, bolt a 3/4 snowboard to the forker. Screws only 1/2 inch longer. Wax that wanker!!! And have so much fun!  This was me not watching the full vid. I'm sorry bub!
the spikes looked like a mixture of mad max meeting saw meeting hell raiser meet resident evil
Что бл я незнаю английский но очень интересно 👍👍👍👍👍
Excellent music as always. Is punk+brass=always ska or is there more nuance
Is it me..... Or should Colin Furza AND MasterMilo82 do something together? (For those that don't know, Milo is a Dutch/German guy who has made crazy inventions and such, like the RollGolf and other insane stuff)
I don't know what it is but trike drifting is one of the most fun things that you can do! Used to have an ATC 70 trike with a big engine in it and regret selling it!
When you think about it it’s a ski doo with one ski and two tracks
Is no one gonna talk about how he put horse sound effects over some sheep
The field is gonna look interesting when the snow melts
Is it possible to turn the drift trike into a mud bogging  drift trike
He's living in everyone's dream
Should've made a rocket sled with the pulse jet
Romania?
So you built it motorized, electric and for snow. For me there is one option left... What do you think happens if you equip it with paddle wheels and make it swim? ;)
awesome content
You need tracks for snow and spikes for ice
I would like to buy one for quebec winter. It would be epic
https://youtu.be/Kp2_ymoVFwk
You surprised me again
Should put small snow blades instead of spikes on the wheels
你好
Go check out bikes and beards😂
You're mega big master!!!
Hey man  can u make the assin creed arm mounted cross bow gun
Bikes and beards said his is better check it out on YouTube
colin look at bike and beards
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp2_ymoVFwk   You've had a response video from an American Bike channel.
Argh RUSSIAN SUBTITLES???!?!!
can ice tyres on snow??🤔hmm
Colin make  a Motor bike
He should put treads on the trike and maybe he will have enough grip and no spikes and no wheeling too much
My boy you need to one up this flat lander from warped perception  he just made a JET POWERED GO CART !
The new lab
Looks dangerous, and yet, so fun...
My son, who is 6, is requesting a sled that shoots fire and can also shoot rocks out the back like a trebuchet. We love what you do and he calls you crazy guy collin.
How I’m finna be rolling through the next ice age
Anak indo ada
It’s the sheep’s for me 🐑
You should make an off-road version and put monster truck wheels on it
awesome, you should make a monster trike, has monster truck type suspension and wheels!
COLINFURVE IS THE BEST
I just realized that in almost every video you have subtitles  And I think I know why               Cough cough bRiTiSh AcCeNt
Я один тут спикинг русичь
Hey, make a SKATEBOARD WITH TRACKS or snow shoes with tracks! It'll get you up from your arse .D
7:04 jesus, talk about luck for the right leg.
Where do you store all your builds?
I want to see Colin Furze and Ken Block  to do a collab
a hug from Brazil
For powder
I would add a thicker ski
Me and my brother actually got a drift trike it's lever steering too so it's pretty cool the steers rear wheel
Use it in a ski track
Tack it on the ice
The snow dance really got me 😂
My brain: Thats your crush don’t act weird Me: 4:07
Make it as fast as you can
Or a baby car with a booster
Make automatic snow boards so you press a button and i goes I was thibking mabye a engine
Lawn CRUSHER ! ! !
You're so awesome sir !!
He reminds me of number 4 from Kids next door
KEŞKE VİDEOLARIN ALTINDA TÜRKCE ALT YAZI OLSA
GREATEST IDEA OF ALL TIME THAT is why you need to sub RIGHT NOW
take that drifting on a frozen lake
Brasil like
This guy has a machine for everything
This man was born with epic ideas.  Colin furze you have done it again mate. Good job
your are NUTS and I LOVE IT!!!!
likE eVrything else you do thaT is BADASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"We need a snow dance" hahahahahahahaha
приветик  тебе  супер  ты  мото  супер  молодец )))))))))))))))))  вам  класс  готов
Do the same thing with the tuk tuk  With snowballs launcher
@colinfurze add to this amazing invention by building a shell in the form of luke skywalkers snowspeeder around it. With guns and all!! Or maybe do this to the screw tank....
One of the furzest things i've seen! I was expecting he'd add protection over the arm- shredding spiked wheels, but all he needed was the standard safety tie 😅
lunatic with a tie
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Feels a lil bit more furze.... LOL
Use tracks instead
Hooooly I want one
Make a go-kart with big/heavy suspension
Why don’t you sell an electric drift trike kit? I’d buy one!
you should make an off-road version of the drift trike that has a lot of grip and like suspension and stuff
Hi
https://youtu.be/aUBJxFs8hko  !!!
H&S having a heart attack.  I must admit, I might have put guards over the wheels!  😉
Hahahah i had the exact same idear im not even joking when if snowed in england i saw a old vid of yores and fought you could make a ski drift trike but didnt get tound to telling you 😂
That thing needs fenders
ABİ SEN YAŞIYORMUSUN YAWWW
Why does this sound like the song we are number one from last town 1:43
This guy is living the life...
The rapid radiator continuously spoil because radar totally move mid a loving waterfall. elegant, fine ghost
you should make a jet ski bike
Make sparking wheels on the drift trike
Dude you should never change your attitude on videos, its so funny and positive even when things are breaking and exploding, awesome!
Never been skiing 😭 Skiing is sick
We need a Collin x Sam Pilgrim collab
That was so cool
Snow dance made my weekend
It’s honestly funny how sheep come into frame and you put horse noises.
YOU should DEFINITELY make another trike but put a small diesal engine on one. That would be awesome.
This guy using a welder in a room with carpet
Brother you are crazy 🤪
What size motor is on that?
Now use the trike on ice so the studs on the wheels so it drifts more smoothly :)
Fantastic!!!!! Now can one be made to handel a Lopithecus sized person?!....you know over 300pound and 6'5"tall?
Mother Hulda waited until Colin finished the snow trike,  I think she subscribed his channel  !
Make a snowmobile
Not so much Force 10 as Furze 10. Bonkers and brilliant.
6:22 Good Colin 6:23 Bed Colin It's real live
Now all he needs is a sand and off road mod, and this man could travel the world in his drift trike
Well done, Hope you get loads of orders.
Comment for analytics
How can you not love this guy?????!! He deserves way more subs.
Do a dirt version of a drift trike or maybe even put a little rear suspension in it so yo can do jumps
👍👍👍👍
best snow dance ever^^
Can you do something similar to this with a bike? Maybe with a snow mobile tread in the rear but more narrow.
5:38 Me after riding something I built for 5 minutes.
Colin chasing the sheep 😂
He's a huge kid.... And we love it!
I like the snow dance😂.  Da da da
Those spikes really do be throwing up alot of dirt lol
Extreme lawn aerator
You should make a spiky screw helmet to be even more safe
F***k You - Colin Furze!!! I'm here in my Home-Office and what do I do? Instead of working, IYKWIM. Binge-watching colinfurze! After each clip I say: Ah, another 10 minutes you can afford. And this goes on half of the day. Complete wrong chronological sequence. But: Who cares!  PS: Don't tell this to my boss! PS2: First line of this post has just been a joke. OK? Sorry.
You should make a mini nascar
Привет тем кто смотрит из России))))
Can you give the drift trike four wheels?
Colin, add tracks off of a walk behind snowblower to this ski-trike!!! :)
People in texas watching this rn 👁👄👁
Build a mirror that bends itself distorting the reflected image so that the person looks like a certain fatness level
IDEA.  -Leave out the spike crap and use snowmobile rubber rike things instead. Should give you some proper speed!  -Also, I wonder if you could actually make something like this which has wings. Like if you go fast enough it would actually let you lift off.
Initially curious the sheep quickly decided hell no.
Can u make a off road go kart that’s very light and fast
Nice video dude
I know it's supposed to be a drift trike, but I think It would be cool to see if you could add treads to it instead of the wheels. Like a mini snow mobile.
If you used it on ice I would recommend using a strip of carbide on the front ski so you would still be able to turn
Subscibe this channal
https://youtu.be/J_iGLZEc91A
Hope you're OK sir! Keep up the excellent work!!!
Can you build a driving Beer creat please
Why dont you make a wooden drift trike or one made out of cardboard or legos
Don't bother with ironing clothes; it only makes them flatter, you know.
Ты прикольный типок
Hey Colin, you should do something on tracks, but make it fast and light
Bro Can u make gyrosphere shown in jurassic world
you should make GLaDOS from portal 2
@colinfurze you should build a crazy rube goldberg machine with some of your crazy inventions incorporated
oops i guess your snow dance got texas too.
я повёлся на стар варс((( а тут
Colin have you ever though about using milwaukee or dewalt or a better brand than ryobi
Plot twist: At the end of this channel, Furze discovers he too is a created mad machine! This is awesome!  I love how your videos dont normally gave profanity in them. Keep making amazing content!
Build a roller coaster pls it’ll be cool
would like to see a drift trike with tracks
If ever that was a case for fenders, this is it.... Lmao
you sir, make some fine wields, respects to you good english man.
Well impressed by the snow mobile/trike  - even more so as my son is playing the trumpet music - Kingstons Devon - regards. Steve
His son must have the best birthday parties
Would love to see this on a lake
Please build a monowheel
Very cool, thank you for this wonderful content. It is from Iraq. I would love to watch you
Hay Collin make a rocket-powered quadbike.
Should have welded Chain Links on the rear wheels. Would have gotten better traction.
6:20 Sheeps : oh, look guys! it must be one of our friend Collin : **revving** Sheeps : nvm, RUN!
I just watched parks and rec and they referenced colin, he is a british icon.
🇧🇷
Make a skateboard that has skis as the wheels instead
Where does Colin find his music? His videos always have such great unique tracks
а у вас Ест ТуЛсКиЙ ПряНИк
羊追いかけるのワロタ
Make a Mario Kart Blue shell!
Electric is better
Put the 4 meter bicil in the snow ❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼🙏🙏🙏🔔🔔✔️
Spike wheels and scaring sheep everywhere! *~CAKE!~*
@realcolinfurze Would that's work as well in deep snow though???
How about making a video about cleaning your lab???!!, clean as new^^
add a small fender!!
What does his health or life insurance provider think of his “mad science” activities??
I love that on top of being a deranged engineering badass, you're also a skapunker🤘 pickitup pickitup 🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍
Just imagine yourself having him as your Dad... probably the most amazing and exiting childhood you can possibly imagine😂👌
7:04 Regret
Where is your turbo diesel drift trike Furz???
So cool! Try it on ice :P
Colin good sir!! I was rewatching one of your videos "Hydraulic Crane Seat-Scooter Pimp #2" and noticed some Mongol Rally stickers on the roof of the shed. Please explain?
Make a mini snowmobile
put skegs on the ski, and go on ice.
A fanfurzeble idea ;)
It’s a sno rabbit look em up they rip
Nice  aerator.
Does a safety tie still conform to British Standards when worn under a hoodie?
wtf
We are number one?
anybody notice the lazy townesque theme?
Hey #colinfurze I have a question which I realise is probably stupid and you probably won't read it which is fine its not overly important but my question is, what would happen we you weld and you didn't use the metal rode but just the welding torch by itself? Would it still do the same job or not work as good?
Furze needs fenders.
Hey Colin, is that your bed in the new Shreddies advert?
What every kid in northern America had as a 10 year old. Most of us lived.  For your next Level of subscribers, would you send up a (eggshells, hydrochloric acid, bubble tank generated) hydrogen balloon and launch the fireworks from it at 10,000 feet, culminating in detonating the balloon at 3:1 air:hydrogen?
Just wanted to say, the wife loves your jigsaw. Its kept her quite for a week now and looking forward to a quite week next week. perfect price for q quite life LOL  Cheers Chris & Clare..
take the hover bike out in the snow.
Hey Colin how about attempting your biggest challenge to date.. Build a hybrid rocket of 50ft or more and attempt a launch into space and deploy a cubesat.. Now we have two space ports rise to the challenge 🚀🇬🇧👍
6:20 hahahahahhahaha
grind hard plumbing just made one
Also can I just say I loved your snow dance
Colin have you ever thought of using Dewalt or Milwaukee or a better brand than Ryobi
That last fall got me thinking we would see you building two metal legs to fix yours in the next videos ! :D
put two tracks on it, one for each side
Самодурство, не помню вроде 30 когда успел стать сворливым дедом на прошлой неделе поехал на горнолыжку на доске ребро сломал об дерево вспомнил жизнь студенческую 10лет назад , поставил фингал под глазом и уехал.
Id love to see that thing in some snow...
We love you Colin Furze and thanks for using FOS this time 🤘🤘🤘🤘🎷🎺
Smart just not intelligent
this dude must have his own personal hospital room
Next you need to make the Furze Crazy Cart XL.
You should have attachments for every occasion
Colinfurse you are insane and I absolutely love it.
Try it on ice with those stud in the tires you will get mad traction and amazing drifting
Turbocharge the drift trike with a VZ21 TURBO!
Hey Colin, have you ever thought about building a battle not? I think your not would be an absolute nightmare...
I gotta get this on gtao
Wow, That Was Really Cool.
you have to come up here in Canada for some real snow
Put an engine in your giant bike
NEXT TIME PUT MUD FLAPS TO KEEP THE MUD FROM FLINGING TO YOUR FACE
He impressed me years ago with his metal work skills already but today it's just on another level. Hats off.
This looks absolutely awesome and super rad!  But please give this thing some mudguards and at least wear a skateboarding helmet. Your face came way too close to those spinny death spikes, and I want to see your whacky inventions even after your head makes contact with the bolts...
You can make a mandaroles ship try at least.
Looking at the intro how could his shirt possibly need ironing?
Nice project.i love your all creations Who reads pleas visit my channel.. 🤠🤠🤠🤠
That dance was pretty reminiscent of IT dancing
Can you make a 4Wheeler or an ATV?
can u make your own f1 car i would love to see that
On the ice?
Colin can you build a hoover bike 2.0?
I wanna see you make the gyro spear from #jurassicworld🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🍕🇺🇲👍
If you like these video's you should check out MasterMilo too. He's Dutch but does what Colin does x 2. He has a real tank and a huge workshop. And Colin please do a collaboration.. You two are kind of the same people lol.
A snow bord bike im think y is there a sky bike
Where do you keep your bigger projects
Ya play mario kart
those poor Wooloos :(
PETA does not approve.
Colin, I hope you have been offered an occasional consultancy role with The Royal Armoured Corps or what's left of The Defence Ministry.  British "loonies" are the best in the world. I can say this because I am one !!
Now you should add some mud flaps to it
Jet snowboard or maybe jet sleigh... 😐
With your expertise from this and prior projects how easily do you think one could make a mountain bike go from trail to being on snow without getting off of it? I was thinking some sort of lever that you push down to engage the extend the skis/bring the front tire off the ground. My thought was basically to create a bike mod that would allow you to go from riding on the plowed roads to riding on trails or on unshovelled side walks in an instant.
You sould extend the frame and put paddle tiers and gaurds around the tires to ride in the sand
FOS by the Kingstons sounds like "We are number one!" from LazyTown. Glorious.
@6:19 i have never appreciated editing in a video more than this one.
You should make an automatic cat box scooper
noice
Unsafe we don’t know her
I think it would benefit from a carbide on the ski, it would help you steer alot better
Im surprised ive seen no comments talkin about how he used a horse sound effect with the sheep
Use a proper Snowmobile sled steering ski because it has a spring-loaded mechanism in the center to dig in for better steering And use caterpillar tracks on the wheel assemblies !! :D
Need a better one
Take it to ice
bild a helicopter
11
That is so bad ass man!! sick !!!
those tires seem like some mad max type shit.
If it's that much grip could you make a Mini 4 x 4
Great work! Nice job too @EgonSorenson <3
Your son is the luckiest man alive lol
Your electric bill must be mental high ⚡️
For God's sake man put mud guards on it....I would hate to see a minced Colin Furze rooster tail.
My anxiety levels watching those spinning bolt wheels of death: 📈📈📈
This is so cool!
What Happend to your Landspeeder? Id love to make a bed out of it 😜
OUCH - did that catch you on the leg when you went off the back?
Go skiing
This guy is nutz absolute mad lad I love it
Be careful with that space heater, I have the exact same one and it started melting and almost went on fire, and the plug made a lot of sparks.
Can't wait for the cr250 go kart/motorbike build!
😀
now that is a Furze machine!
Colin furze location     9 Londsdale Rd Stamford England
You should make a steam punk V8 engine powered iron for your shirt
4:04 every day i at morning😂😂😂
Try it on ice
Can I get instructions on the wolverine claws?? 🙂
Colin make wood gas powerd 1 😅
love the jet one tho
How are you Colin? How you’re getting on with home schooling?
Yt need more colinfurze
Holy crap, that looks so fun!!
Was just thinking that ........ Adapting a Turbine to your Hover Bike would be really Cool  🤞
I love the way that yor brain works; ro come up with these ideas on how to build these things i absoloutley love it ^^
I have an idea, Drift trike but with a rotary engine
Quá đỉnh
Furze's powers of creation are so great, in order to get a snow day he froze the top half of the globe for his demo.
Maybe you could install a tilting flywheel to the motor and have that aid in stability?
Those sheep! XD
You should put skis on the go kart and spiked tires in the back
Kinda thinking of a mini drag car
Please make doctor who dalek
Like it that's great left a comment on you hover bike please read it got my kids watching you as well we all love the things you build your awesome wish I had your workshop but still wouldn't be able to do what you do I think your a genius well keep inventing I'll keep watching thanks for the great entertainment
Fun at 5 kph
Man you ruined Texas with that snow dance
The farmer who owns that field is going to be confused once that snow clears
10 M subscribers...what happened to the fireworks???
Mark sent me
bruh just drift a smowmoblie its ez
Another great video! 👍👍😎🤟
Can you imagine if he slipped off that seat and took a wheel to the butt crack....
From where did you get the engine?
Wooow 👌
If the world ever had a major disaster or some form of apocalypse... this man will be ready.
i'd love to build one myself.. but i dont have the space to ride this kind of not street-legal beast
CAKE!
How well would snow mobile track type wheels work?
you should weaponize your drift trike
Did he said "jetski!" Or "wiski!!"?
Awesome 👌
Poor sheep
Your getting old huh
Брат, ты офигенен! Привет из России))))
I´m gay
俺たちに出来ないことを平然とやってのける。そこに痺れる憧れルゥーーーー！！
Can you make a amphibious car?
Every time his insurance company watches his videos, his premiums go up, lol.
Colin you should do something with RC cars and attach a flame thrower or something onto one
Please make a bullet proof mandalorian armour
Snow dance creepily reminded me of the IT film remake when Pennywise is doing his dance!
take it to the beach!
How's your leg after the spikes hit them?
I thinck colin should build a motobike or somthing #team england
man i love this guy  keep up u inspired me to be an engineer  all love from Iraq m8 ❤️
damn i love this man  genius
“Oh yea oh yea this is a machine “😂🤣 love this man bro
omg id love to see that with a tank track conversion lol
Hi furze! I think you should get your delorian you made a couple of months back, put big all terrain wheels on it (maybe from a land rover) put a big plough on the front, and on top of the plough, put a flamethrower on it! Because fire!🔥🔥🔥 and there you go! The snowdelorian! Love you furze!!!🔥🔥🔥
Maybe sand tyres... Large cup size and a seat belt.
My guy can see 2 piece a junk and say yup I can make a car out of that
Minivan + monster truck wheels
In all senserity I would absolutely die for a custom fork (or anything) from Colin. So whats up with Stamford stickers at least??
Big love from Texas! Got 1' of powder here as well. Got me wanting to slap skis on the motorized bicycle sir lol 😁🤙
Take a moment and appreciate some one doing what ever the F he wants.
3:58
I’m pretty sure he is running out of stuff to build lmao
This man has to much fun
Hi Colin I think this band will be good background music for one of your vids (my uncle was in it) if you want feel free to give it a listen :)   Band name - Conflict  Song - the serenade is dead
A song suggestion for your videos would be do i wanna know by arctic monkeys
https://youtu.be/Nj0DHcx_L68
fun + funny + mental = colinfurze
4:07  Me when Colin uploads a new video.
Do you have a professional editor for your video's or do you do that yourself?
You've conquered the dirt and the snow but Colin, this summer, can you overcome the water?
I think you should make a manned electric drone
Is there a 70mph Mobility scooter still in that field?? Time flies..
Colin can you do a minigun firework launcher
I don't come here for his amazing creations. I come here to see how he survived once again.
Put tracks on the back its gonna be awesome
Colin since you've done electric drift bike and motorized mobility scooter, have you ever considered doing a drift mobility scooter
Mark Rober & Colin furze we need a collab
l am turkey likeee😅
Lpve the music in ypur videos!
Super.if you are a man like this cametaru and sign
Lan dayı ütü diye bişey icat etmişer haberin yok mu?
You should do collab with the sidemen
This HAS to go on a frozen lake!
The music sounds like we are number one lmao
Are you going to do a 10 million subscriber video?
6:19 I heard a horse but instead it's sheep for some reason.
Colinfurze you need to put a snow plow on your screw tank
This is definitely someone you would want on your side during an apocalypse
making elevator or escalator please
I saw this guy in the Sahara making glass art using solar tracking on a 3d type frame....could you make glass tiles from sand, just using the sun?
6:20  -  got to be the funniest moment of furze history They were all chillin then all of a sudden the roar of what can only be described as an apex predator sends all 100 of them running out of their wool
How about ‘horizontal’ fins on the rear wheels? So that it gives you forward traction, but should allow you to drift sideways nice and easy...
Video idea: hydraulic can opener
Always wait for the next Furze episode but this is an ice drift trike, paddles for snow.
Best channel 👍🏻🗽
Pulsejet Drift Trike to start Q1 of 2021 off with a bang.
I really enjoy your videos. I was disappointed this one had swearing in the lyrics. I hope you keep future videos kid friendly :) Keep up the great work.
I live somwhere that gets hotter than where you live and got more snow than that pile! Trust me i am as supprised as you!
Can't speak English
Why not try to make a mono track moterbike ? That might thrash snow an mud? What do u think
You should do the same thing but for water. Like a tri motored water skis👍
Send a handful of these to texas
I want to see you and Mark rober collab
K
Pretty cool. The front ski not tracking very well. For improved handling consider steering geometry to rotate the ski on its longitudinal axis along with its z-axis. Hope it was a fun build.
Did you catch the sheep?
5:27-5:36  GoPro owes you money.  A lot of money.  Advertising never comes free nor does it come cheap.
I'm surprised Colin's never been skiing. Seems right down his street, high octane, potentially dangerous, very fast
I would of DEFINITELY put some guards on the wheel's to make it a lot safer. It'd be an easy thing to do and they'd also work as mud guard's.
OK, now put it on tracks
Did you hurt your right leg on the spikes when you fell off?
Snow dance was hilarious!
If your running out of ideas why don’t you make something from Batman movie’s
This is pure fun. Great job.
4:07 are you okay??😶
Put the jet engine on it
You should buy a Honda atc 110 and weld a bar and weld some skis to it and stick it through the front fork and make studded wheels
We just got dumped on with snow,damn i want one of those!👍🏻
I really like this revisiting topic, but also I want to say I really really like this music.
you should make hiccups flame sword form httyd2
Hi Colin! You have created small people for your house, so perhaps, like me, you spend an inordinate amount of your time making crap sandwiches. There has to be a better way! Can you make me a sandwich printer?
ski-trike belongs on a frozen lake! I think it would work out way better there!
What is ONE or TWO tools/machines that would UP your invention building to the NEXT level (increase efficiency, capabilities, build speed, etc...)
God damn brilliant! Stay young, Colin
Why not build a submarine!!!!???
ImPRESSive snow dance.
Dirt bike snowmobile  But with retractable skis and track so you can use it as the original bike when there’s no snow  Would be nice if one existed
Pretty sure Colin is indestructible
...can i buy the Ski Trike drift Monster :)
Congrats on the bad skidoo
(read this in an intense narrator voice) One man 10,000 tools, One goal, he will do anything to achieve the unachievable. Will he succeed...
He looks like boris Johnson
Can I hire this thing for aerating my lawn pls?
Maybe he can do this on the motor mobility scooter.
I really miss when he would show a lot more of his work. Granted, there wasn't all that much to do with this one.
INSANE DUDE
I think the front ski part needs to be wider for better ride no? maybe a piece of a snowboard will do?
Hi Colin I've been looking for a drift trike with winter tires and summer tires like this for a long time. I wanted to ask whether you are selling your Drift Trike cheaply or giving it away. Greetings from Germany
Вот минталитет у вас ты бы ещё пиджак одел занимаясь сборкой
Hope your having fun
Colin your music is always great.
Jet Sled.......
I got an idea make an offroad version of the drift trike
iconic outro. hand down.
I’d love to see a pulse jet powered sled
If i do the snow dance in a desert will it snow?
make doom bfg already
can you differrent  type of cycle
When he started explain the dangers which are obvious. I thought he was gonna say now I gotta make some guards nooe
Colin nearly lost his right leg in a shredding tyre accident

Anyone wish his vids were longer?
Can you make Doctor Octopus’ mechanical arms? I’d love to see how you would would handle those.
I knew those middle bolts were way too long
This puts a big old smile on my face
You should take your bumper car in the snow
I love this channel it's so awesome:)
does anyone else love his choice of songs
I took my moped out yesterday and drove on a frozen lake that was pretty nice and I did some snow drifting with my bmw. But I wish I had a snowmobile or atv
I was abut to sleep but I guess not
That music isn’t half reminiscent of We Are Number One
Nice snow dance
Wonder if it could actually move in deep snow. Maybe make a drift rocket powered snowmobile?
The swing you built for one of your milestones. That one that goes higher than a house and upside down. You could make it with a sled attached to it and once you get to the desired speed by swinging 360° a few times you can make it release you at the bottom and launch forward on the snow sort of like sledding only on flat ground. In the summer you could adapt this to a swimming area where it releases you and skips you across the water on something that looks like a saucer sled.
Cheers from Poland.
Hello Colin, Greetings from Nova Scotia, Canada !!  I have a very....loose idea I would like to share with you. A bicycle that has dual  tracks in the rear and either a single wide ski in the front or dual thinner skis in the front, retain the handlebars for steering, and the pedal power, only...Heres where it crosses over to a Colin Furze Invention...lol Create a system of large and small sprockets, chain driven to power it very easily over snow, perhaps something along the lines of 1 rotation of the pedal sprocket turns the tracks 5 times in rotation, I have no idea if this could actually be built to function, BUT... if anyone can do it... IT'S YOU !!!   Thank You for HOURS of unending entertainment with your Creations and Hilarious Videos  Your Fan, Ron
Snow, sled, jet engine. Work with that.
Leave the bolts long
Can you bring this summer some projects with pulsejetengine? That would be nice!
we are number one is casually playing in the background
Colin we need a big new project. I love seeing how far your mind goes it needs to be FURZE
Try paddle tires like dune a buggy instead of studs. And then also slap a fat tire on the front and use it on sand in the summer.
Mate! Strap a pulse jet to that!
4:57 is that a cheeky word I hear :o
Love the things you come up with and build!! Some crazy talent! What do you think about your own twisted jet powered rc plain that shoots fireworks!?. That would be nuts!
You need to call it the 'snow drift'
Or a fan favorite make something with a jet engine or something blow up I think that is you in a nutshel(with tea)
Collin I suggest that you make a bike but instead you have tread mills instead
I mean the grip is fine if there was ice under the snow, or more snow than what the British weather seems to offer...would be amazing to test it in the alps with some slanted surfaces and thick snow coverage
same idea, but instead of a ski put on an ice skate and take it on a pond or frozen river
I was wondering why we just got more snow here, didn't know Colin did the snow dance.  Carry on.
love the noise the plasma cutter makes it sounds like Donald fuckin duck
You need to use a wider snowboard for front ski and build a set of snow trax for it. Looks like a lot of fun either way.
Hi Colin, great video, as expected. I was wondering which lathe do you use ? 01:58
this is the first decent colin furze video in a while !!
Love the  music tool!!!

You need to start producing and selling drift trikes or at least as a bolt together kit form
Sir I am your big Fan. I have been flowing you since I saw your video on" You have been warned". I wish you all the bast.
Furze is a skanker for sure! 2 Tone nation!!
Hi Colin, this is your ardent fan from Asia. I was just watching the movie Alita: Battle Angel and was wondering if you are able to make a pair of those cool remote control skates? If anyone who is able to do it, it is you Master Colin! :)
Master Milo of Holland as built a similar concept https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_Xv4P1Xn5c
Collin can you please make awd electric mini gokart like a Tesla

Uhhhm where can I buy this piece of equipment 😍
Am I the only one who thinks of Russia with the music at the beginning of the video
This man never lack of idea.
It'd be great to see another Ski on the front
snow dance 🤣 me and my son always love to watch you, my son joshua asked if you do a colin furze blooper reel? 👍
1:05 I've Never Ever Been Skiing - because - Skiing is for little fat Kids!!1!1!! -.-
Amazing videos inlike from INA 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
I’m thinking more of all the cow manure flicking up from our cows previously in that field! 💩💩💩
That was dope!
It would probably make a good plough machine.
@colinfurze , u should take it out on a frozen lake :P i grant u great success !
Wish we got more snow in the UK. Theres so many cool snow builds you could do!
Getting a wee bit chubby there Mr ColinZ xD
@Colinfurze you need to make something together with MasterMilo :D
A man living his life like every day might be his last...by his own hand. 😂 inspirational.
Why youtube is not giving notifications of your uploads🙄
And for years university professors and konsultants at the ministry of agriculture talked about soil damage by driving heavy farming machinery on the fields.🤔  And along comes Colin with his skiing thrift trike 😂😂😂  I really need more of it!
How about making a self digging spade. Can you dig it
Upgrade it
That's amazing
Collin, you are amazing on what you do with all the inventions you have created what a talent you have 👍👍👍
Drifting away from the UK
The channel should be called "what could go wrong?"

I want to see it on actual snow and ice
Keep the back tires on and the change the front tire so then u can do it on more grass and offroad like terrain
The background music got me into singing  NOW LISTEN CLOSELY, HERE'S A LITTLE LESSON IN TRICKERY
~when you take the game hill climb racing too seriously..👏👏
Can you make a drift trike or any sort of motorised vehicle using a weed whacker engine
Переведите кто-нибудь эту дичь на русский
Is a waterskiing trike too crazy? Or just crazy enough that it might work?
why have you not replyed to not one of my messages asking for help
now we need deeper snow to see how it really goes ;)
Подводную лодку сделаешь?
It's a tractor not a damn skies
You know what would be awesome? A Colin Furze soundtrack compilation playlist on youtube music, spotify, and apple music.
This is the sort of stuff your parents wouldn't let you have as a kid, but you would've loved to play around with.
every time i watch your videos i find myself thinking boy what if you and michael reeves had a video together. one day i hope you make it happen.
Paddle tires would be so much more effeciang
Seeing Collin Whiskey Throttle something was worth the watch alone 😲
Colin is like the most handiest handyman ever
Epic snow dance
FIREWORKS COLLIN! We are missing 9M-10M and soon to be 11m. What are we going to do? 😜
- Å fan!
Gotta use it on ice!
Now that butters my egg roll
If you want the best feeling driving that, wait for 8 inches of snow and it just feels like you're floating
He used 2 kind of snow to do this video...
YES!! Furze
More of a leprechaun dancing
Hello man
When it warms up you need to make a twin pulse jet boat and see how fast you can make it
If the body sprung like a skateboard truck, itd carve really hard
Why do I love Furze? Hes a Sublime fan, of course
Best sheep herding device! 🐑
MORE SPIKES!!!
Snow bike vs sheep stampede!
Now to waterize the Drift Trike. A skifloat for the front and paddles on the rear wheels.  (And a float underneath) Go skidding on a lake in that.
Recommend: do a sledge with a steering wheels and grippy wheels so it’s like a mini sledge car
You should build a body that swims 🏊‍♂️ for your 🦈 sharks head. I mean make it fully shark swimming up down left and right. And get that jaw working too! Well what're you waiting for?? Get on with it!!
Make a automatic ironing shirt machine
You should throw some magnesium skid plates on the wheels and throw sparks EVERYWHERE
He got a like just for the snow dance!
Beanie on.
you know that people in doctor who call the doctor a mad man with a box well we have colinfuze who is a made man with shed
I would like to see or have  Harley engine powering my snowblower
I dig the music... Got a real Streetlight Manifesto, Less than Jake, they might be giants flavor. Great work as always Colin!
make it with  t r e a d s

status report: scaring the sheep on a snow trike
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
How is this man still alive???
could you come rotovate my lawn too?
Take the hoverbike out, if there is enough snow, the props won’t bust when too close to the ground
From Wisconsin...Going to burn this 212cc mini bike into a snow trike
That field is going to look amazing in the spring
i called the go pro breaking "sorry"
Nice Colin. Get connected with master Milo in Holland and do a project together
I still wanna see a jet powered hovercraft :). Maybe a heli turbine?
4:07 that's some 2010 YouTube energy right there
Well that dance can be cut out and used as a twitch emote :)
Next evelution is having it on ice.. ⛸
Wouldn’t it have been better if the grip was in the front so it would drift properly? Just a thought though love the content
Far out bro, that thing is mean as. I reckon I'm gonna build me one of them bad boys, Chuck the wife and kids in the back and go for a sweet cruise down to my local fishing hole. CHEER from NEW ZEALAND
Shirt ironing machine?
Chasing sheep!! Classic
make a go kart with a car engien\
after i wrote this you mentioned that verry thing  "the solid rearaxle with the bite you get from the spikes in the rearwheels makes it harder to steer using a ski on the front " i was looking intoo using angle grinder gears to build a differential myself for a different moped powered project , seen ali express sell those as replacement parts think the "sungears" can be welded on the axles  you could even install differential braking for an even more snappy turn / innitializing a sideways skid
I #challange you and bet you , you cant make powerfull  wooden compound bow (allow little amount of metal)!!!
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteous. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

I like your page caz u publish science in the  simplest way
Take it to a frozen lake!
Excellent
Would suggest having some sort of fenders over the rear tires so you dont chew up your legs if you do fall.
Anyways you know that guy with the flying rocket pack? how about a rocket pack for a snowboard xD
The snow was too shallow, i think u prob did not even need the spikes xD
疯狂
The cost to aerate your lawn by hiring a lawn care company is about $15 to $17 per thousand square feet. The average lawn size is about ten thousand square feet, making the average aeration cost around $150. It will take a lawn care company about 30 minutes to aerate a ten thousand square foot lawn.
Now just drop off a bill to the farmer for aerating his lawn.
Like a sled but with wheels 😂
nice
That actually looks really fun to ride!  Now what if you could replace the spokes with bungees...
You DID IT OLE CHAP ! you caused it to snow ! I say , very good ! 😝
Dunno about the weather over there but if you get the chance, take it onto a frozen lake. That was the first thing I thought of when I saw those spiked wheels....
Put tracks on it!
Go on some ice!
My fiancée needs this, she just broke her finger and may not be able to ski now but she can steer still 😂
That shirt usually gets ironed out by the HIGH SPEED!
You talked like gordon
So much fun!  And the Ska plus snow dance made it extra!
Hey how about making a tardis !?
The MASTER
The grips were a monster. I'm not sure how you'd do it, but if you made this thing amphibious like the screw tank, it might just be the ultimate all terrain vehicle!
🖕👎
I just built a ski bike just got my old bmx and put a *slegs* cant spell it 🛷 one of them

That looks like fun to drive
https://www.hemmings.com/stories/article/the-grand-dukes-turbo-sleigh just an idea 😉
I have a question for @colinfurze : could you do a video on how to do all electrics for the drift trike, I think it would be really great to those who don't know how to connect all wires into those places where they should be connected?
Take it on ice right now!!!!!!!!
hey colin furze. you looking a little sick. did you have covid 19 or break your nose just resent? mate you are a legend. does not mater to me. love your videos. bogans all the way!!!!

Wider ski would've been better
I wonder how it would perform on solid ice with  one of those figure skating blades (but big) in the front. Talk about upping the danger levels! This could be the start of a new series, adapting the trike to different terrain.
It's kinda crazy how much stuff Colin was able to do once he got that plasma table
furze how bout on ice....but instead of skiing board..use the boot that have blade on it..i just forgot what its called

Make a automatic driving motorcycle  The tesla motorcycle 🏍🔌🔋
Anyone that takes an engineering class should be made to watch Furze's channel.
What if you add some small booster rockets to the screw tank or make another one of those screw tanks but wood on the back so all the metal doesn't melt. Or maybe some fans in the back to gain more momentum.

hi
you can add a metal mud guard for it to be safer sir
,😂😂🤣🤣🤣
very cool
This would be fun on a frozen lake!
I guess the owner of the land doesn't have to do any plowing this spring
Colin just driving his snow bike: "I'm above the conflicts of this mortal realm~"
GET THE IDEAS, Get the Bits, Use the Tools, Put it together........ And.... Then... "Faster than a 'clat rat up a trouser leg" - you have much fun! Only in Lincolnshire - the Mother of all invention
Ever look at someones life and what they get to do and be a bit jealous? No... yeah me neither... fun stuff as always here :P
More Jets pls
Spiked wheel drift trike with ski steering not surprised.....Colin in weather appropriate hoodie and jacket!!😮😲
Come to  Canada mate we have snow 24/7
Hi Colin! Your right leg was too close to the right scratching wheel. I suggest you to add some shields upon the wheels to protect yourself.
Wtf
Paddles would’ve been cooler and gripper and go in deeper snow
Stick a pulse jet on skis next. That should be fun.
I like the art direction 👌🏾
I was thinking why a YouTuber wants  rich a 10m+ subscriber they will have a limited or very long long day to make a videos or uploads...😓😓🤔🤔
Your the cartoon character that always wears the same cloths
Snow dance was best bit 4:06 100%!
10 seconds in and I’m realizing your solar dryer must not be working so well.  That safety shirt looks more wrinkled than (insert overly creative analogy here.)  P.S. Love the show, love the quirks, and love the creations! Your my hero.
Jet powered axe ? Like the one from Akita battle angel
The music is always excellent on your videos, but it was particularly magnificent this go. Cheers to you, The Kingstons, and Bedspin!
First song sounds like "We are number one" lol
What about ski powered jet😂
6:19 🤣
The snow dance was the best......lol
Why not try and make a flying drift cart
that snow dance is def becoming a meme
I love it but It needs rear fenders for sure!
Love it, should try make some tracks for it like the proper snow skis
Well now I need myself one of these to go to work everyday! I think a little 6x6 skid steer would be nice mate! But fast .... Cheers!
Scaring the animals just seems sheepish.
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good deeds because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can either be accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, and instead desires to obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Dogs can be shot by the farmer for sheep worrying.
Made in England
Not only did the snow dance summon snow, it summoned maniacal laughter from the depths of my being!
Still on his track  Track of craziness stuff
He is annoying
A jet powered Sno-Go ski bike would be da bomb!  Just sayin...
I really like this YouTuber
Мдаа... видимо весь год караулил, чтоб покататься, пока выпадет наконец сантиметр снега, который через пару часов растает.  И это мы к вам зимой на мотоциклах приезжаем на знаменитый зимний мотослёт элефантентреффен. Надо наоборот, приезжайте вы к нам на мотоциклах зимой в гости- мы встретим с распростёртыми объятьями, главное не превратитесь в сосульку по дороге . И зима у нас как надо- неплохо нос кусает, и снега много, который пол года не тает.
LOL snowdance worked into holland as well!!
haha you better not slide off the seat or you'd get castrated.
Great project Colin
Could have done with that coming out of butterwick head up hill on snow covered ice got a rescue tow from Mitsubishi pick up truck driver fella saved me
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates⭕️
The next one you can maiby make itt go on water?
You and Mastermilo should make a video together, he is the Dutch version of you.
I love all your videos I have learned a lot from you colinfurze.  😉
Snow dance was the best bit ever 4:06
Drift quad bike
Still brilliant after all these years, I've been subbed since 09 and this channel never gets boring.
I think you just need a wider front ski and wider wheels so that it rides on top of the snow instead of plowing through the snow. (Maybe use part of a snowboard for the ski) that should help with your grip problem.  You could also put "skis" with holes cut in them around the wheels to add extra surface area. Kind of like the wheels on a snow plane.

Take it on a frozen lake
How much for one bike like that you have and sweet ride and be safe out there
Unfortunately, you have little problem. This isn't spike wheels, but it's snow paddle wheels.
The back song sounds an awefull lot like "we are number one"...
Col, with added Ska... splendid!
Love this shit!
why this guys a genius. he creat thing before e have time to think about it.  you are genial.
Your films are amazing, they bring out the best in people for sure. 😊
The Colin Furze channel, where men are men and sheep are nervous...
Love it!  Well done!
wow
👍😎🍺🍩🛠️
Love the snow dance
Why in gods name would you thumbs down this ? Even the music is good :) Nice one Colin !!
You are just Furzey crazy :)
What about a jetpowered Iron Form your shirt?😜
I just watched MasterMilo' s project. Now im going to watch yours.
3sj
Plan:get the screw tank and make some kind of firework rocket launcher and attach it to the screw tank and blow some wood targets up
You know they’re real mates when they stand in a freezing cold field filming you having fun and spraying them with mud and snow!
You put me in the mind of the late and great Fred Dibnah, back yard mechanics. Love it.
You need to throw a ski from a snowmobile on the front of that. The stabilizers will give you more 'bite' to your turns.
Your shirt has been ironed with a cold brick, nothing wrong with that. Love your vids
should have adapted it into more of a skidoo design imo, still very cool though
that's an awesome way to get spikes on tires!!!
wheel covers or skirts whatever you call it
No Colin Furze were harmed in the making of this vid! Okay maybe one... TFS, G :)
You need to team up with Guy Martin that really would be bonkers! 😝
Das Ziel (nicht "Sinn") des Lebens ist die physische Unterblichkeit nach dem bevorstehenden Quantensprung: wir-kl-ich-keit de. Alles andere ist Illusion.
do something 2 stroke
Did you add horse noises when you saw the sheep? Cause I think ya did and I absolutely love it
what do you mean drift trike? this looks like a rototiller to me.
this are an animal my friend l Iol
Not sure where this might be from but those sheep 🐏🐑🐏 running away was the most british thing I've ever seen if it's somewhere there
Furze: we need some snow England: NOOOPE
Like this if he should make the landspeeder actually hover
That belongs a frozen lake
Pulse Rocket Sled?  Gets you places AND keeps you warm.
Make a atv with tracks
When he got a laser cutter he acquired unlimited power
Epic conversion. Got to try this conversion on your eletric drifter.
JESUS CHRIST OF NAZARETH IS LORD...............REPENT AND YE SHALL BE SAVED.
Question from Russia - where is the snow on this video??
Man that looks like fun!
I think the sheep thought they would gang up on you and you would leave with the noise. They just couldn't hold strong. One folded and off they ran. Lol. Much love Colin. God bless you and your family. Build on my friend.
snow dance blew my mind jeje
Preety cool
The Musik and just the build of this thing is sooon fucking satisfying haha
Build the world's longest snowmobile!
We're do you get the engine from?  How much is it worth?
damn, ive been stuck inside all week because of that brilliant snow dance
Call me
#hello6209283725
Colin, you can add some fenders over wheels so it can reduce dirt going all over the place and also protects you if fall over. That would be nasty... All in all that was AWESOME!!!
Awesome! And great music as always. 👌
...and then I added guards over the spikey wheels.  No? OK, carry on!
You r crazy but i like it...!
Bloody awesome dude. I want one!! Can you imagine a grand prix using these, it could turn into an Olympic sport!!
Beautiful 😻
how about try it on a frozen lake with a ice skate thing in the front :o
This man is living his life to the fullest
That ironing of the shirt, do you have a robot for that? 🤔
Any news for the arm mounted hydraulic jaw??
I always have a smile by the end and usually from the start of these videos
Fit a bigger engine!  Yamaha do a 200bhp turbocharged snowmobile engine! Should be fun
What about a rocket hammer
you mean you need too make a machine that will iron your shirts automatically...
Awesome 😱
Wow 🙄
Bu adamın atölyesinde olan çoğu alet bizim sanayideki ustalarda yok
You need Furze Safety Fenders over the back wheels
The grass in this property will look interesting once the snow melts.
https://youtu.be/FIeNwfrcbhU
Your the reason ive chosen welding as my profession
Wow ,, noticing the purge on the numbers !
Make a jet ski - pulse jet powered skiing.
EY OH SNOW DANCE FURZE I KEEP DOING IT OUT IN PUBLIC
When a world class fabricator does his own thing!..... is there anything you couldn’t craft up!? Been watching for a while & I gotta say, I’m inspired to wanna try build that Trike! 🤔
Very good Unfortunately I don't know any English but I like to follow your videos. It would be a lot to ask you to put the option of subtitles in Spanish thanks and a hug
There is a famous character, a Google search for "signals walter bulls". He made a fortune for himself back in 2018. Recently, such services have appeared that allow copying the results of professional players. This guy shows how to copy after him automatically using such a service. We must try while the market is on the rise!!!
Oh I’ve seen these. Kids get them in happy meals at Canadian McDonalds.
You always amaze me, but we have learned to expect anything ! Great job as usual . Keep safe !
я написал трек оцените пожалуйста ❤️
Outstanding! That really cool way of making the tires grab was a brilliant feat of engineering! No how about something like a steam powered motorcycle? Maybe a bit tame for you but I'm sure you'd figure out a way to give it some skin peeling speed!
Love you channel don’t even know how long I’ve been subbed. A idea go airborne more risk yes, of course but it’s always good to learn new things and more views wouldn’t hurt either
how long did he dance
It's a Shame your videos arnt long why come you only make it under the 10 minutes
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Love the wrinkly shirt.
Those studded wheels would probably work all right on deeper snow, but now they are only grinding mud... Welcome to Finland, Colin, we have SNOW!
I’m subscribed and I saw this on trending before my subscription page. What the heck YouTube.
The man I want to be
Tom Lamb is going to be pissed when that thaws and he sees what you did to his field!
Can you make one that goes in water
Snow aerator)
I was already going to 👍 but the snow dance sealed the deal
I’d like to see Colin do a collaboration with Mark Rober
Rip Grass
You should put some shield on the wheel.Looks really dangerous if you fall of the side.
What was the 3D printed part?
What did you say was your profession again??? 😄 🤣 😂 😆
Could you build a pulsejet-powered sleigh?
this is gay lol
You need to take this on a frozen lake to get the best result! 😜
this music in the background reminds me so much of the "I am number #1!"
Why don't you build a budget dirt bike for £300 so then I could copy you buy building it
snow dance FTW 🤣🤣🤣

Very nise👔
I would love to see the grass when that snow melts🤣
You've never been skiing.... I think in the future you should do a snow themed feature with your toys and new ones. Hit up those slopes!
You should let Sam pilgrim have a go😲😲
Listening to that Ska bit in the build segment, I couldn't help but thinking "Furze is Number One!" 😆

Next up a Furze's take on ironing a shirt?
How long did this take to alter? Days or over a week?
Can you make it run in the water? Fan club from Thailand

You're on trending mate. Let us hope more science and engineering YT channels get the love they deserve more often. 😀
Pieces of snowmobile track would work even better
Make us an epic all grain home brew system we can try to replica
Colin! You are seriously as mad as a box of frogs! Please don’t change!
what if . collin furze feat Grind hard plumbing Co. create some epic vehicle?
Another excellent project (and dodgy snow dance !).
Die Illusion geht zu Ende. Das System opfert alles für den bevorstehenden Quantensprung: wir-kl-ich-keit .de
idk why,but i keep hearing the "we are number one" over the video's background music lol
put some wheely bars on the back of that snow trike. Ya wont flip backwards anymore
7:07 You were sooo lucky.
hello Mr Furze. ya know what would be really cool a drift trike built outa cardboard and wood with the og engine
That's one way to plough a field :)
That thing needs some mudgards that sends the dirt flying up and back behind!

There are certain YouTubers who are too good for YouTube like  Casey Neistat, Liziqi, Vsauce n many more & Colin is one of them.             Tell me your favorite YouTubers that you think are too good for having YouTube channel & plz make sure that they have certain set of skills and not just a celebrity with good look.
Yeah that's a cool machine man.

Colin you need to take a small car like a Volkswagen or something and put tank treads on it
could you do the same thing to your electric one or would the snow destroy the electronics?
Do one with snowtracks instead of wheels
https://youtu.be/MirgijJJt_A
Stuck inside self isolating and this video has cheered me right up. Try some old mini digger track stuck on the rear and a snowboard on the front. More surface to skid over the snow and less grippy on the rear? Love your channel 👍🏼
try making a drift trike that works on ice but behind it, it can either polish or tear up all the ice and spray it everywhere
*Video of sheep* *Horse sound effects*  Logic...
HAhahaahhahhaaaaa
You should  try to put tracks on it
A szot brwi go agin
Make a wheelie drift trike
This guy has major James acaster energy
I thought the snow dance was the funniest thing on the video UNTIL the initial launch played. Not sure if I've ever laughed that hard at a Furze video before.
Hover bike?
All i could hear was "we are number one" every time the music played haha
Colin Furze is the Steve Irwin of makers.
👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Pmsl 🤣 snow dance
We use the same karting slicks. Say Max 180 kmph on them :o)
Oh cool! You made a sleeve sleeve.
OMGAWd the snow dance is LIT ima learn it
Just realised in one of the songs it swears 🙄
I'd love to see that field in the late spring
You need to build an automatic shirt ironing thingamagigg! To iron shirts by yourself is not very Colin Furze 🤣
Colin I want to make a electric bike with alternator and using the new really safe fat batteries you can get fancy doing a video on that to help me they go sooooooo fast
Yayyyyyyyyyyy
4:07 How did he summon snow with Sr Pelo's Halloween dance??
How's the gassification going?
You should make it jet powered
I wanna know when he gonna start selling these inventions of his. There amazing
Having too much fun Furze!!!!  Can you make a caterpillar tracks for the back wheels maybe? ^_^
You should find some small paddle tires
The building montages in his videos are so good.
my brain during the exam 4:10
Love and support from India
The Furze is a god amongst men.
You should try swapping out the tires with paddle tires both on the snow and on the sand dunes
Probably would be hard where you live, but it would be cool to see this in some deeper snow, like on a mountain or something.
Awesome!!! 🌟👍🤩🥶
Where did you get your Plasma cutter
As always cool and interesting! And this time it's also useful, because it's snowing outside. On my channel, you can also find many interesting homemade products. Who cares - welcome
Great viddy as always! Loved it! Got lucky with the leg there when you went off the back. Could have been bad!
Electric, auto balancing unicycle...

That was pretty fire commenting to help algorithm
He look kind of like Gordon Ramsay but is very good with technology and other thing and is much nicer
thats not a field were things are grown right? because if it is you killed all plants where you drove

Look so fun 🤩
can you do something for the climate change?
I suggest you either make a 🙏 skateboard with exhauster in next video or ya snowgun... that your choice ❤️ and we will wait for you 🔥.
Put a paddle tire on it. Better acceleration and bigger rooster.
You should sell a make your own Colin furze trike drifter box on your website 😅 be unreal 👌🏻😊
Got an idea for ya  A Covering That would have a Dual Use... A Wheel Guard when using the Tires to Move but then when Nearing the General Area of a Hill you tap a button or lever that Transitions the Guard’s from the Top of the Wheels to The Bottom which would then be used as a Sled to Slide Down said Hill
Also useful in aerating your lawn.
https://youtu.be/8XBrW_9ZyEs
Noticed someone on YouTube made a snowball gun. Could Colin make one of those?
Really should be wearing ppe
Would love to see that field once the snow has melted! I think you ripped it up proper 😂
The snow dance was funny as hell. My son and I watched it several times
Him realizes that his shirt needs ironing and I realized that i have watched him for years
Hover ski? 😆
I want one so bad
OK, now we need to see a pulse jet powered snowmobile!!!
👍
Colin: "Pretty simple really,"  Me: "Everything is simple if you have a Colin Furze safety tie."
reverse the body on a car so it seems as though it is driving backwards when it actually is not
You are A Big genius Sir  Love from India 🙏
I guess it should come as no surprise that Tom Lamb keeps sheep.
Dangerous at the wheels, need protection!
Wahhh jiii bete tumnee to mojjj krdiii   Tum to bade heavyy driverr hoo 😂😂
Well tracks on a drift trike would have been fun but also hard..but what am I saying he has a land speeder..lol
You need to make your own car next for sure
I cant imagine talking to this guy in real life with his real personality
He lives in his own world and I love it
Love the snow dance
I tried the snow dance   Didn't work for me damn it 🤔🙄😁✌️
Can you change the engine to 600cc??
Love from India I love your videos ❤️
Are you taking orders I need one of these ASAP 🤣
Needs treads
Jajajajaja snow dance.
Him "Its quite simple really."      Me *trying to figure out how to make macaroni*
Pulse jet powered snowblower! (melter!) What?! Someone's got to do it!
For a reason the background music reminds me of Russia 😂😂😂
Ski steered vehicles, like snowmobiles and snow bikes, have a much different ski design than skis that you strap to your feet. For steering, a ski isn't flat, it has a runner that sticks below the flat part of the ski. It also usually has a metal strip with carbide teeth for extra grip (especially on ice). You might have a lot better control with steering if you used a ski like that :). In any case that looks like so much fun though..
He should host a reboot of scrapheap challenge (junkyard wars in the US)
This the essence of Furze! Brilliant video and build - long time fan
Absolutely bonkurz!!!! I love it!!!
That's wicked.
The music is killer in this... as always! Keep it up, dude!
Man, your problem-solving approach is blowing my mind... If I had a project like this and ran into a similar scenario, I would be like "okay, I need to move the centre of gravity forward, and strengthen the drivetrain and..." (and I'd likely lose sight of the fact that this machine was originally intended for driving around a field for lols)  Whereas you set about solving the problem with an angle grinder in probably 5 minutes. Awesome.
make a small scale prerunner pickup chassis enough to fit and give it a beating
What about a dual front ski setup?...with suspension.
Now all I need is a frozen lake to race that thing on 😁
hey, suggestion as someone who grew up with snowmobiles - you want more control on that ski, install a 'ski rod' or 'carbide'. they run one up the length of a ski, and its just a beveled rod that runs the central length of it, with two threaded bits that go through the ski to affix it with a washer and nut. Also, the tracks are something you could put around the tyres, its a rubber track (one piece) and has 'lugs', or the paddly bits that it grips with (fun fact, the ones with extra long bits and high performance engines are used in the summer to run laps on water like a nitro powered paddle boat equivalent to a jet ski, they do it up in Norway and over here).
I wonder if you took that out on Ice if it would be even better

Hey, can u make some kind of mini Incinerator that burn anything inside to unrecognizable piece?
You should make a go-kart type of this. Have it low on tracks and have it enclosed from the environment have brake lights and make it wide enough that you could drift without rolling. Basically a go-kart snowmobile
Ski Trike rally race with your friends it would be awesome
Grindhard plumbing 🪠 would like this build for sure! You should try and make a something custom with hand controls!
Do NOT watch the snow dance at 1/4 speed...
https://youtu.be/e-ad_0CO3UI WHAT THE HECK!!
Why don't u and hacksmith partner up and make hoverbike  🔥 2.0
failure isn't colinfurze guys... every time he tries out another stuff....  I wanna be like you too
drifttrike!
Create your own car.🙏
One step further,How about an ice skate on the front and take it to a frozen pond?
Put a carbide snowmobile runner down the middle of the front ski to help with steering.
I would’ve recommended a wider ski for increased stability
i just watch Colin for my daily punk rock dose
Canada needs this !
Lol! The most aggressive lawn aeration I have ever seen. 🤣
Hey furze? Can you make a vehicle made for sand dunes! It gets hot in arizona! I really need some way to get around without melting! #furzona
Lost it on the snow dance! You rock Colin!
Jet powered scooter
man, your amazing !!
Speaking of irons how about you make your own iron Colin
Take me in as your student? (went to engg college but still dont know how to weld)
https://youtu.be/tCZRssu_11M
the furzemobile 5000  (and 1)
I love every single one of you videos. The montages, the music, the tie and suit, it’s all perfect. Keep it up man!
So awesome!!
Instead of a snow bike in Louisiana that would be a mud bike
Now make it float
195 sheep watched this video
Heck yea!
Needs carbides
Brilliant! What a blast you must have had...
And you can aerate your lawn with it 🤣
“And I just realised my shirt needs ironing” Next video: I Made A Jet Powered Iron
you are great
Can you blow up some dirty buds with wade from DankPods? Jet engines can’t be too hard. To send to ‘stralia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-lxUJOXLtE  Pretty cool.
Was there a video of Brundle riding the trike?
Would love to see you build ur own jet ski with a huge engine
can you make a snowmobile
you know what you should do with the ski drift trike you should put like tank tires on the back two wheels like a snowmobile and maybe extend the sides a bit
Pop the wheel back on in the summer and suddenly aerating my lawn sounds like a chore worth trying on.
Grass Tearer
What about... A sled powered by a pulse jet?
I would call that thing a "Winter Grass Aerator".
CAKE ! ! !
How well does the electric drift trike go without the pipe on the wheels?
Great job.Your motivating me to make something for the snow.
Some people buy motorcycles for a midlife crisis. Colin just embraces that raw energy regardless his age and it's awesome
Beloved, this Word, even every Volume to every Letter, is the Word of My glory which I have put forth once again; a testament of My love and sacrifice, the announcement of My coming, a proclamation of truth, revelation of who I really am - the Trumpet Call of God, so all those called and chosen may hear and come to Me in their proper time and season. Behold, it is also a strong correction for all those who have taken to themselves MY name and MY Word, to pollute it, a plumb line for this wicked generation. For this Word is a waving banner, an ensign to all nations! - A trumpet of alarm and war, the sound of recompense and judgment, which shall soon fall upon every nation!   For I AM WHO I AM!…  The Only Begotten of The Father, The One True God and Savior, The Mashiach!…   YAHUSHUA-YAHUWAH!  https://www.thevolumesoftruth.com/Know_That_Which_Has_Been_Poured_Out,_The_Word_of_God
Furze you madman
Instead of spiked wheels, put a small idler wheel in front of the normal wheels and put a skidoo style treds on the wheels
Yes exactly. I need one.
The snow dance got my "like"! And a sub if I wasn't already a follower!
It hurt me when he cut the ski
Love the video, it looks like alot if fun. Maybe think about a bigger skid plate and mud flaps? That way the spikes stay to the snow and ice more so than the mud? Just a thought.... Love the vid!
For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,  that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4   For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 2 Peter 1:16   And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. 1 John 5:20   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. Hebrews 12:2   If anyone acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them and they in God. 1 John 4:15   In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus. Philippians 2:5   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand. I and the Father are one. John 10:28-30   Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved. Acts 4:12   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. Isaiah 53:5   This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. 1 John 4:9   My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. John 15:12   If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9   But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect. 1 Peter 3:15   Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful. Colossians 3:15
I say I love watching ol furze never a bad video and im happy with all the success he's found to be able to keep producing such awesome content
Epic!
The #1 youtube channel in the world, easily!
Sheep whisperer
lol i love the music xD lthe music genre like im number one song xD
colin saying "it's quite simple really" is the equivalent of a woman saying she's fine.
Now use it and climb some hills, off road style hills. Remember to put the front tire on!
Yo this man right here is a fu$$$$ legend bro damnnn
amazing fun
That is some serious hold my beer and watch this shit!
Drifting is fun 🤗☃️
Snowboard ski and tracks would make that amazing
ColinFurzer da  uma  moralzinha pra nos do Brasil habilitando a legenda não custa nada e todo mundo ganha valeu.
Put TRACKS/PADDLES on the sleeves!  And a snow board for the ski!
Furzey admitted that it “Had Too Much Grip” .... and now penguins can fly
Would still like to see hover bike landspeeder combo.
Use skateboard for ski? Put fenders on for safety. Instead of bolt use half washers welded to outer steel?
What The porpus of the front damer? Its not doing anything? Is it?
Do a life sized Star Trek ship!
Bit posh that. 👌🏻
Take it to the next step and make a water trike. I don't know how but it would be pretty cool
I love all the music you play on your videos
sheep: oi quit playin with our food!
make a buggy that uses 4 x 3kw bike hub motors ,instant torque ! ( 3kw hubs can be overclocked to run at 9kw easily )
That precision is just beautiful
Snow
You should move to Florida.  You'd fit right in.
Alternate title: How to have fun and make the most of half an inch
can you make small (trike or bike size) snowmobile? could be used to get up slopes for skiers?
I'd like to see another drift trike but with a jet with vectoring.
you created multiple versions for land, one for snow, but what about one for the water? Like a jet ski, drift trike style!
These grips are metal af. Epic drift monster, throwing snow and mud everywhere. Absolutely metal.
The snow dance was epically funny original content
That thing on a frozen lake or pond would be so sick
Should've put snow tires on it Instead of those dumb bolt ones.
grass destroyer 6000
Beautifully insane as ever! Thought we were in for an A&E visit with those 'spikes' [sans mudguards/fenders].  Q. Do you take holidays or just offload your excess energy straight into the national grid?
Videos like this make me wish I got snow where I live
Love your stuff Colin
Almost clicked off the video because of that “snow dance”
A fast and easy mod to your ski, that will greatly improve your steering, would be to add a "Ski Carbide."  You could easily make one with some skinny round stock welded to small plates bolted to the ski bottom.  Basically a consumable item that can be replaced.  I have NO AFFILIATION with this channel, but they explain carbides well : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLXf2eYugQs .  Here in Western New York we get a lot of Lake effect snow.  Anything under 4 to 5" is a just a "Dusting" of snow.  Keep up the great work.
You should do a snowdog!!
This must be great having a drift trike, but its so cold, and afterwords, you gotta be so hungry.  You did it with the old car, now turn the drift trike into a drift tub, with bubbles and a heater, and put a grill on the back!!!hahaha
I just noticed the music at the beginning of the video is we are number one
That is the same snow dance I do
It's just not Furze unless it's lethal.
100% doing this to my 5.5hp drift trike when I get snow
Change that drift trike to take on mud pits.
You should make two tracks  for the back
Do you have any frozen lakes knocking about at the moment you could ride any of your vehicles on? What about jet-powered scooter on a frozen lake?
That thing needs paddle tires
I love how even as your channel has grown your videos have never stopped feeling like you.
damn luckey your leg didnt hit the wheel when you fell back on it
It’s that 20% I love! When you watch Colin flying round on his creations you can see there’s absolute joy and excitement in his face :D but there’s that 20% look of fear and terror ahahaha This could go soooo wrong but it’s soooo fun
Pi network crypto - invitation code Edviosas
I want one patent it sell it so i can buy one at walmart...plz
You should swap the ski out for a ice skate and keep your wheels with your trike
Bro youre snow dance screwed up canada the Hacksmith is sad now...
Worst part about this channel is the music.  I hate the music so much.
This guy is just straight up amazing from Philippines 🇵🇭
Well that’s one way to aerate a field.
In warm weather, put a spiky wheel on the front and rent it out as a ride-on lawn aerator.
"these spikes could rip my legs apart!" 7:04  they sure did come close to it
*HANDSOME SUPERSMART SUPERTALENT*
looks like great fun! you should try a paramotor car bonnet in the snow there great and you could chop your arms off if it went wrong proper furze style danger,   it would go well with your polini, we only had a solo 210  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNzLyoC1_Ic
Colin can do so much in his little shed never change Colin.
https://youtu.be/Sjo2D-3pbiQ
I have an Idea Colin! what about a Pogo stick that jumps extremely high?
Furzey makes super cool shit!  Fekkin love it.
your subscribers love you !!!!!!
Set the playback speed to 0.25 at the snow dance for a satanic ritual
Can you make like an off-road car that’d be littt
Build a iron man suit
You must know some very generous farmers the way you tear up those fields all the time...
Replace the spikes with flat bar to be like a mud tire.... that would eat up snow...
Modern Day Wallace
Love it ferze. Shame about the adds mid vid
Conceived, designed, and built before the snow melted from the majestic realm.   I am amazed once again.
All that grass getting torn up was pretty funny. Great job!
would a pulse jet add more speed for the drift trike
On ice same setup but a hockey skate instead of ski
Genius + insanity  = FURZE🤪
It’s also a great way to aerate your lawn.
Just ended up being a muck spreader really
Missing ure videos furzey!!! Need more posting
The pop music sucks
Colin didn't cheat death...  He beat it fair and square.
That looks like alot of fun. Cool build.
And YouTube fails to put this in my subscription feed.
Needed more weight on the front..... better steering
You need to put a snowmobile Scagg on the front ski. That should help with  turning
brilliant!
definitely just digging into the ground lol paddles on the wheels would have been cooler lets do it!
make tracks for it
So it’s a snowmobile?
+1 internet point.
it’s not a waste of time and money if it’s radical
May I ask why not make an tracked tank also. Is it not legal or is it just to experience?
I would have done lugs or cleats. Then putting a v on the ski like snowmobiles have. Now a better upgrade would to build some mini tracks for the drift trike. Pretty much this could be done by making a rubber belt with some cleats and building a sprocket that slips over the drive tire and a roller sprocket for the back axle. Rigid frame attaches to the rear of the trike and each of the back axles are independent and can be adjusted via a bolt to tighten the belt. The track its self can be made with a single rubber conveyor belt with hole cut in the right places and cleats attached in the right spot. Cleat design should be much like the ones used on snow cats. With this being a about 1 meter long you may need a boogie wheel as well. The ski in the front should be far wider as well. Doing it so that you can swap out between the two designs. One could also desgin a front end for 2 wheels and the rear could be swapped out for atv type tires and now you have a 4 wheeler type design. 3 in one fun for all seasons.
First God gave us light, it was pretty good.  Then he gave us beer. and it was great. But then he gave us Colin Furze.. and he's a fucking legend! Thanks God.
That was some vintage colinfurze
When you turn the epicness knob to 11 !
No one human being should be allowed to have that much fun.
Collin make a jet kayak or canoe 🛶
have you tried to use it on sand? it would be awesome!!
whoever knew that furze was a professional snow dancer
lazy townnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
Now do it in actual snow
3:57
Hey Furzey,  Why not go the whole hog and take the trike on ice! A frozen pond if you can find one ( or ice rink ) and get a blade for a front skid ala ice skates?
This is the thing to take on a Ski Holiday!!
Wow the no welder version is so good for backyard enthusiasts.  ❤️🇦🇺❤️✌️✌🏿✌🏻
i lost it when he pulled out the atomic ski, for the longest lime there has been a single atomic ski sitting at my grandmas house for no particular reason and ive always wondered what i could do with it
woooow amazing
How could you destroy that ski it's a retro ski you can tell because it has a wooden core
Do rocket powered skies
I bet he could make that gocar work on steam power
Next challenge, can you make one that drifts on ice? :D Or maybe a water-based one? So a get ski but way cooler
You’re a maniac Furze
Ooooooooo... New carpet!
show will show you are the best.
Hey Colin, what about ice?? Put a front tire with studs back on and take that out on a lake! Would be much better then snow!
Could you imagine living next to him? Between a 360 swing popping over the fence, watching him drive down the road in a beamer filled with water, to having the mailman running for his life after being shot at, I'd bet me and him would get along fine.   My last neighbor had a thing or two to say about me doing crazy stuff, so he ran off and a friend moved in, we haven't had a complaint since, except when we mix up our AR mags and ammo.😊
colin when are u gonna finish the jet scooter!
I remember in Colin's very early videos, he came across as a lunatic bodge artist. I have to say that these days, he may still seem to be a total lunatic, but his projects have now got a REALLY well engineered and thought out feel to them.  It's almost like the early "Toys" were only really made as a by-product to the primary goal of getting great video footage to upload as quick as he could. But now he's well established on YouTube, and knows that he's unlikely to need to fall back on the plumbing any time soon, he's confident enough to take a bit more time to get things as good as he can.  Considering that (As far as I know) all his workshop skills have been attained through just giving things a go, he's turned into quite a competent metal machinist.
Put some fenders on the wheels
The sheep 👀
I am not so sure, but maybe, just maybe, spikes are to long 😂
I got the puzzle for Christmas and I already did i twice
you should make a diesel drift trike with a 1:50 gear ratio
If I had the time and the space I'd love to build one of these. Probably works much better in the snow than my car does 😂
Don’t even ask me how many times I’ll be watching the snow dance... 4:06
2:00 furze is no.1
if you imbed little wheels into the spike it could be a snow/offroad trike and you don't have to wait for snow just some mud
Instead of doing the music you are doing do popular song example is dance monkey
Driving this on a frozen lake would be awesome
Can you make another hover bike but it has 4 engines like a quadcopter
Awesome machine, and if you wanted more turning grip in the front you needed to add a skag under the front ski, it’s the little medal bar that runs down the middle of a normal ski-doo ski for traction so the front end doesn’t slide around. Awesome but scary machine especially with nothing protecting you from those meat mincing spike wheel attachments, but it’s definitely the furze way !! Keep up the Great Work ! Stay and Play Safe !! 👊✌️
At the start you said your shirt needs ironing so why don’t you make some sort of shirt ironing machine! Like some sort of press that irons your shirt in one go or something like that
Watching those sheep come over to investigate and then tear a** running away was AWESOME!! Very entertaining Furze!
It's a SKIKE (ski +trike)!! Aaand I WANT ONE!
You cud make a homemade snow bike maybe even petrol powerd
I want to see some kind of boat or project
Wait, you said your shirt needs ironing? What's an ironing?
I just wanted to point out that apparently his shirt size has not changed in over 10 years :D
Getting “we are number one” vibes from the music
The dance at 4:08!
Idea an amphibious drift trike
Imagine being neighbor of this man HAHAHAHAA
Now create a waterscooter from it
Love the music of the first half.
is that we are number one but there’s no words in it in the backround for the music
You have petrol engine, electric motor, jet power but you don't have DIESEL .......
Funky looking horses...
Mint! What a life you have 😂
you would be good going on dragons den
The man is an utter lunatic but a pure genius. Love watching his videos.
Hairline, twat ideas from the what once ‘was’ a beautiful creator and YouTube pioneer. Title, thumbnail, content = stale af, sorry but this is not good content from you Colin!
Cake!
You need to take that up north on a frozen lake.
Furze has like every tool in the world
SCREWTANK WHEEL TRIKE
* snow tracks! *
Whoooo ! ! ! The Sheep From Forza Horizon 4 😄😋 ! ! !
Every time I see you on YouTube you remind me of one of the Weasley twins from the Harry Potter saga. I bet you would be the kind of guy to run a wizard wheezes shop
The only thing that I think that you should have changed was using your new branding kit to apply your logo to the front of the ski instead of a sticker.  Well done, sir.
take that thing ON ICE plz
Challenge: Do a solenoid engine powered drift trike
999, what's your emergency?  I've been turned into a hedgehog while using a motorized drift trike
how to till your field ready for spring plantings....
who would win: the indian guys who build mansions colinfurze
make a shopping trolley but motorized
Try the tuk tuk
Quite a few times here with your windswept hair in the snow you looked exactly like Alec Trevelyan - Sean Bean's character from James Bond - Goldeneye. (in particular @6:13) Awesome video
You’re a madman and I can’t get enough.
That's not a snow bike, that's a dirt bike!
My favorite loon, wish he was my neighbor...
Get the weight ratio right you could wheelie it
Can you please remake the Wall of Death? Please?
The happy Gordon Ramsey
Music is great!! Ski trike is crazy  cool!
the snow dance is some tf2 animation lvl stuff
Request from Chicago: I've currently got snow piled up at the end of the drive that is level with the hood of my car.  Any chance you can make a super powered snow thrower to get rid of the stuff, perhaps a turbo jet to sweep it away with hot air?  I realize I won't have it here, but it will be therapeutic to see snow being decisively defeated at least somewhere in the world.
Can I just say that I frickin love your content... to the point that I have the hover hoodie and book, and I did my english cba on you so you could say that I am a huge fan...
'Just realised my shirt needs ironing' after 15 years lol
Let’s be real, if we had Colin’s technical expertise we’d be doing the same thing
Would love to see that on a dense snow pack if you can manage it.
Colin u should make a Mega ironing machine where it can iron a bunch of clothes at once and make tea or coffee while u wait
👍👍👍👍❄️👍👑⛄️
Your creations are so EPIC!
I'm interested how his rain dance looks like 🤔🤔🤣🤣😂
Keep up the good vids
I have my best luck drifting in snow by using flat track or dirt track tires.
So many good parts in this episode. It was worth it for the snow dance alone, but then...  There were sheep, that sounded like horses. Lol What do you do with a drift ski and sheep?  You chase them of course!
This reminds me of the cars and cameras YouTube channel 👌
Almost lost his fucking calves at 7:05
The song in the beginning sound so much like "we are number one"
Next version: Add a wheelie bar and grippy tires so you can do 60mph wheelies all day long!
You are on form  as usual Colin! By the way! Loved my merch box thingy & the 2 T Shirts I bought! Good quality & decent price! Cheers!👍
i dare you to make a firework cannon like a autocannon but it shoots fire works instead of firebombs
How about a "monowheel" old Bean!?!?
Colin Furze: Terrorizing sheep since 2005. My cat's name is Mucky BTW, but he's never been that muddy.
... With that snow dance I'm getting some zim flashbacks. Also maybe a little of "MSI - Shut me up".
I feel like the Ski on the front made next to no difference to how it performed in the snow.
COLIN your need to buy OR BUILD your own surron
This music is weird but way better than before! 😂 During construction I mean. 😜
Definitely 1 of the best yet.  Handy you had a drift bike knocking around.. . Teach us all that Snow Dance some time...
Missed a good chance to put those wicked "bangles" on your arms and pretend you're a heavy metal fan :V
So I use my car if I want to drift in snow.
We haven't had any fireworks lately Colin. How about you make a ridiculously powerful ebike?
Yay new intro!
Someone also watches CboysTV
Colin should make a man sized trike same thing but on steroids? 🤔
HA! A viewer outsmarted colin! :D
I'm waiting for the day this genius makes something that doesn't work, please hurry up I'm 85 😁
the tires you were missing were sand-paddle-tires.
That thing was ripping id love one..it would also work on a beach ⛱ Colin
this is what l like abt him.he don’t give a shit abt nothin
Hi Colin!! your ideas are genius !! could you think of something for me to mess with?  I sent you a DM via Instagram ... I would be really cool if you want to make something for me!
"I just noticed my shirt need ironing." Me every Sunday.
I dont like the new intro
If you can you should put disc brakes on it make the stopping power so much better and God loves you guys and Jesus died for all of our sins.
I have a better idea everybody is making like tracked go karts and side by side I think u should put tracks on your car
How about you do  a v8 trike????
You know... if you made it front wheel drive it would always be drifting >:)  Might be interesting... (just in general)
Your would soul need a honda civic vtec,and put in rocket engine,and ffllyyyyyingg colin!!
that field is going to be very well airated
Hi Colin! Where do you buy all your parts? I've been looking for ages for those bearing blocks with a grub screw to fix a shaft.
ngl this thing likes like a crap ton of fun
Хоть нихрена не понимаю, но все понятно.
collab with sam pilgrim after lockbown
Is there no limit to this man's Furzeability?
dis de ole modern Furze
Can I just say that the camera work was exquisite?
Now you just need tank tracks for the back wheels, drift tank
Isn't about time you made a steam powered motorbike - there's been a few on the net recently? Seems a good mix of plumbing, rocket engine, danger and the possibility of a cup of tea.
you need to take that thing to somewhere with a frozen lake...or...or...an Ice Speedway circuit!!  You may need to make it a bit more dangerous by either adding a thin spiked front tyre or skating blade to the front though 🤔
Colin could you make some sort of machine with tracks plz love the vids keep up the good work 🙂🙃🙂🙃
1:32 Love this video's background music! It suits his channel so well! :D
After all that talk about dangerous nature of the ski trike, I expected Colin would be wearing some safety gear and shit. But nope! He Furzed it again hahaha
AHAAAA!  That's an idea for the next invention...  The Colin Furze Safety Shirt and Tie Light-Speed Press 10,000,000
yes! more drift trikes. 600cc engine next time?
Is that pure terror I see in his eyes? This thing is too insane.
I drool every time I see his shop equipment. :-)
A Ska beat montage can motivate someone to build anything .
Although the ski didn't give you the problem you thought it might, what about using a snow board? Even using one under the engine?
When is the shark bin vid
need to get that thing out onto the ice!!
He might have more control with treads, but now I'm just suggestion to him a snowmobile.
Those spike wheels need fenders eh?
The over engineering in this is beautiful
I would like to see you do an all terrain / off road drift trike  maybe even something in all wheel drive
Build a snow 6x6 with 4 wheels on the back that diff together  Spikes included and make it go kart like
What I love about Colin's garage is (apart from the amazing tools and inventions) he still has an old school TV in there
Wow! That's how they make crop circles!
4:07 - 418 Looks like a colin Furze meme coming on here!:)
'The Lincolnshire Shepard'. Love it😝
That thing looks so sketch! But man it looks so fun!!! HAHAHA
Wheelie trike next hahaha
Got to try some paddle tyres next
Love it!! would be more awesome with more snow. you were tearing that grass apart!
These are the sort of vids I love a miss from this channel, love your work keep it going
This is once again incredible!
You should make it even more furze...  Drive on a frozen lake and instead of the ski put a iceskating blade
4:06 Made me laugh out loud. I love this dude
I think paddle tires would work better.
I can see ppl screaming at colin for scareing the sheep
You get to have fun drifting around and as a bonus you get a healthy serving of grass!
Furze removing snow from the pasture so the hungry sheep can finally graze. It is so nice of you! :)
Tuk tuk in the snow
Legend.
Have you tried out your massive snowball launcher yet? I bet you could fling an entire snowman!
Grind Hard Plumbing Company. You're welcome.
Intro music is the best
That's begging for a seat back and some mud fenders
Music sounds like mad caddies
I wonder if he gets paid for plowing the field
Colin is the one you tuber who ‘s videos I never miss.
music in the style of goran bregovic
Hi Colin. I urge all to check the contents of this channel's prelude  video.  It's basic but the content is massive!   WW3 Agenda Anti virus  anti bacteria proposal
Idea for you jet powered sled.
Briliant.  Though your creations. Always have a Frankenstein element, they are always clean and really well built.
So his summer project is going to be a snowmobile transformed into a beach-buggy??
Careful, one ice chunk could dead stop it...
Need one of them for the frozen lakes around here.
You should make a proper off-road one and put suspension forks on it and suspension like a quad bike think it would be cool
Glad that fall didn't cause any damage to his leg.. need a bigger safety tie
That looks like a lot of fun.
Put it in deep snow
also ploughs the field for the farmer.  don't worry about the dogs, Colin will worry your sheep instead.
By watching this video, I take it you survived.. right?
Weld some 1/4" paddles on those rings!!!!! Nice job Colin!
🤘
First
thought I'd have a browse through your merch .. shouldn't your 'safety tie' at least be a clip on? y'know someones going to end up getting their face pulled into a lathe or something . . .
Wow great video
Honestly you never get old. You are doing the same awesome crazy sh!t that we all subscribed for when you started out and I love it.
inb4 the snow dance ends up as a fortnight emote.  if it already is... don't @ me... i dodged that bullet lol
"Local man terrorizes sheep on his tricycle."
Always love the soundtrack to your vids.
Hi Furze, what about building an ice-skater with a sail? I's love to see it. 🤘
I feel shafted that I wasn't notified of this when it came out. :-(
Ever thought about doing an episode with joerg sprave from the slingshot channel? He's gonna be in the UK for the next 8 weeks...!
😃 amazing
I think that it would be sick if you put flamethrowers and a snow plot on the screw tank!
That's a really nice meat grinder :)
Sheep come over, The sound that plays.... a Horse
Wicked looks great fun 👍🏻 😁 👍🏻
"It's simple really" Oh yes... simple, of course, obviously, yeah yeah
I think it would be better with some small trucks office a snowblower
Another great way to seriously hurt yourself! Truly great!!!
Can u make a turbo drift trike 😋
This video is amazing.
fenders/mudflaps!
Its the best thing ive ever seen. You have to put some tracks on it. Make the wood mower 2.0
Weld chains wheels, maybe to have enough grip in the snow but slick enough to slide more
What happened to the bunker and I live in the same place as you
Great job! How about a 2 seater for a sheep dog? And, do you ever let your hard-working team ride your toys?
Yo man build a bad ass hover craft!!!
Congrats 🎉🎊🎈🍾 on 10M subscribers
It literally just started snowing outside my house while Colin was snow dancing.  YouTube miracle.
6:19 When you pull the string on your See-N-Say and it makes a horse sound for a sheep.
This video is not brought to you by Atomic.
Number one are we
how about a flying drift bike with ground affect https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTM8rcA7c04
Nice lawn aerator!
Can you make a motorized bin
"My shirt needs a bit of ironing" -> Turbo charged iron confirmed
Googy goo dance colin next time make  a shield of ice
Wonderful I love it
Snowdance 😂
The sheep were even interested
Sheep botherer🤣🤣🤣
This guy deserves 100 mill subs not the stupid uncreative pewdiepie
He turned that thing into a beast!
Why does the Music when he's building the ski part of the trike sound like We're number one? Lol
I’m a big fan of your channel and want to get into this kind of stuff so can you please make a video on welding for beginners like me👏🥺
Colin-furze is the best builder ever
You needs tracks from a snowblower on that machine
You should build a deft sledge
I wanna see an inverted drift trike. Two in front, one in back.
Amazing amazing amazing
Behind The Press needs to play with it
“So why do you want to learn how to weld?”  Me : *thinking about the spikey drift trike* “just seems like a useful skill”
Colin, please don't get mad when I say this... You and I are just about just alike... We're both big kids at heart!!!   Love the builds Brother!!!
👍❤👍❤👍❤👍❤👍❤👍❤👍❤👍❤👍❤👍❤
Another great project. You working alone in your workshop are more productive than many bigger companies with few people working for them.
Awesome!
More like understeer trike.
It seems sheep are also afraid of Colin’s frightening genius.
I want to see mumbo do a documentary about his stuff
I’ve said it once and I’ll say it over again....  Mr Furze you are one crazy technological madman. What will you think of next.
Would absolutely love to see a project which utilizes a 2 stroke crosser engine!
Fantastic job well done so funny colin you the mad man.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
3:55 Given this is Colin we're talking about, I was 100% expecting him to accidentally rev the motor in the shed, & leave several gash marks in the floor with the tires.
Danger Will Robinson, Colin Furze approaching on his drift trike. Amazing, maybe some wheel guards.
LOL 😃😆 That sheep herd looks awesome
u should definitely try to make a drift trike that can go on the top of the water.
hello
You're crazy 👍
Meh, you're just running over the dirt
Awesome
that was epic..... next up . paddle wheels for mud?
Best show on YouTube.
I wonder if you could convert one of these bad boys to work on water......
snow dance worked
IT GONNA HAVE KET ENGINES
*Starts* *drifting* Suddenly I hear Eurobeat in my head.
Silly Colin you want to go faster have a bigger ski cause the fact is that the  mass is spread out far
i would defintley add mud guards next
Take it on ice!
0:24 Soooo...an automatic ironing thingy next time?
I bieng drifting my van today it was fun
Next build:today gonna build a drone   but with twist to it,
Craziest thing what I have ever seen...... Whaaaat a machineeee....
Before I clicked the video I am thinking those things float..
Who cares if your shirts wrinkled while you've got a safety tie? You need a dead man switch that kills the engine if you get shot off the back again.
Would love to see a video of your top 5 worst injuries and accidents from your time making! As an engineer I know no matter how careful you are, accidents are inevitable!
Now Mr Furze! As amazing as this is.. what we really wanted was a jet powered snowmobile!
It needs a wider ski and a frozen lake to drive it on. That would be just grand.
Colin you are the man!!! well done bet that’s a right buzz 👍🏻 I’m gonna make the trike 👍🏻
That man almost shredded his leg from too much grip
You should make a motorbike with drift wheels on it
Poggers for God..
Colin furze the creat British eccentric
Is this what they mean when they say snowdrift?
CAKE ! !  😂😁
This machine is furzy with spikes
Furze has always been, and continues to be, my spirit animal.
"I think that Furze fellow has built a plough this week."
I Love It!
Awesome 🤩👌
This guy knows what's up. Even good background music. Good work.
Sounds like what you need, Furze, is an automatic ironing device - such as a mannequin you put the shirt on, then it has a bunch of holes in it that blast steam through the shirt and iron it out.
As an avid skier that was painful to watch him saw through it
Never seen anything dives into water? Like a homemade submarine
so you've done a drift trike, now you have done a snow trike, (which both are amazing btw!) but do you think you can modify your trike to doing so on water? granted i know thats just a jet-ski but i wonder if its possible? Great video as always Colin! love your content!!
Great vehicle. To protect the elbows and other important parts of the body from the cleats, one could consider mudguards.
you should take the trike, put LARGE paddle track tires on, keep the ski,  and see if it can skip water.
ski go brrrrrrrrrr
Sick but I think you need wider wheels and a double ski
On clear ice will be more interesting
Well theres a problem.. make a auto shirt iron
So. When you taking it on ice?
Mate, I thought your right leg was a goner!
Its a sheep hunter;)
With all the snow and ice, little old nanas are going to be too afraid to go outside in case they slip and fall.   What's needed is a flame-spitting ear-splitting jet-powered snow-blower to save the day!
What we have learnt today is snowmobiles are too complicated
"I've just noticed my shirt needs ironing"  Haven't you made a furze shirt ironer
Its a soil aerator
drive it on pure ice!!
Driftski kinda like a Jetski. Nice work!
You should use your catapult to launch giant snow balls
Is there anything this guy can’t build 💪💪💪
😱😀👍👍👍
3:57 out of context
ITS A REVERSE SNOWMOBILE
Snow and dry land done, so now there's just the water drift trike yes?
Colin, where the hell can we see Martin Brundle on a drift trike?
Messing the crops of Harry's farm🤕
A must have for every winter shepherd!
Colin: i need to iron my shirt  Also Colin: i made a drift trike snow edition
Excellent. You need wider wheels mate.
Pulse jet bike....... Put it on a toboggan for more snow fun. Don't know how you'd steer, but would be brilliant and keep you warm after. Lol
BOOM! You've been watching Titan haven't you? (from Titans of CNC?)
Sehr cool👍
Funny idea, you should make a contraption that's powered by a steam engine and irons your white shirts for you. When its done the sound of the steam whistle WILL ALARM YOU! psssst make it LOUD...
Need to find a place with sufficiently frozen lakes, that you can take it onto ice! Of course, then you might need to replace the ski, with a large skate blade. Or a ski with a skate-blade "keel", so it works in both snow and ice.
Now this is the furze we been missin
I didn't think that the field needed ploughing.
Wow he came so close to getting his calf torn off. Made me cringe. Great video as always though!
please make an shirt ironing mashine colin furze stile
Make it more HP for power
Спасибо 👌😊
dat headangle doe
Gotta love all the grass and dirt flying everywhere!
I am bored just got a pizza. i think lets see if that British ADHD guy on steroids make some weird stuff....
Огонь, а что за группа играет??)))
Colin mentions that he has never been skiing.  Me (an Austrian): I feel a great disturbance in the force
Motorised Sheep herding to the “Furze” Max!
or, how to aerate your yard
Some day I’m gonna be just like Collin furze crazy nice amazing and a sycotic engineer
I wonder what happens when you snow dance to dubstep? Asking for a friend.
What snow? The wicked thing killed it all!
But it wasn't even running ON the snow, it was just digging in to the ground for tracktion. You need a few meters of snow to test it properly.
I was definitely concerned with the wheels tearing your legs up! Would hate to see you crippled/maimed from one of your awesome builds.
Very cool, Colin! I'm so glad you didn't extensively modify the trike....that one is my absolute favorite build you've done by a long shot!
Hi, Russian subtitles please
Just watching that gave me a back ache but bet ya bottom dollar I would travel half way round the country just to see it, maybe I could have a go 😁
with spikes this trike would do MUCH better on ice, spikes are not that good for snow tbh. what you want are "scoops" they give much better performance in snow
Uncovered spiked tyres? This is definitely some belt of knives level of danger. I love it!
You should make something to iron your shirt without taking it off
I only have one question: Can that thing drive in deep snow? If not, you may wanna try making one that can :D
You can't just brush over that  Martin Brundle have driven a drift trike. I can't find any videos of it
Just waiting for this man to make a battle bot
Would the steering be better or worse if you used a snow board instead of a ski?
I'V BEEN WATING FOR A VIDEO FOR AGES
Ice bike in the snow?
I was thinking you'd need track and field spikes on the tires to increase grip but that was not actually the problem now was it?
Cboystv
for more precise steering you should add a carbide to the bottom of the ski. look at a snowmobile ski for refference
Pretty sure you can sell thousand of these on amazon, maybe with some extra safety features, like a tie
When did he make the jet powered trike
This is amazing
We got snow here in London Arkansas two today
What a glorious achievement! Bravo Mr. Furze!!!!
Colin, this is one of my favorite channels, and though you will not see this comment I'd like to say that some of the most amazing things I've found on the internet were here. Keep it up.
Big badda boom!
Haha... Someone needs to make that snow dance into a gif.
That's just brilliant!
He is living our dream
You overdid your snow dance. We are getting snow down here it Texas today. I mean really! What the hell man? Where I live is on the same latitude line as Cairo! Be careful with that stuff!
ive been watching you bunker build more then a few times now if i email you some of my plans would you take a look and see if its looks safe and do able please
You should let  “Sam Pilgrim” get ahold of this would be epic !!!!!!!
love the  brilliant idea. you should put tracks on there and drive it in the snow!
Did you know in the 70’s there was a manufactured ski trike? It’s called the Allsport Trirod / Trisport. there were multiple versions of different size and capabilities. The ski part was an extra add on from the factory. I know all this because I have one!
What id love to see is a snowmobile with a race bike engine in it. Aka; snowmobile with gears. Great video!
4:11 That so caught me of guard!😂😂😂
´is grenzwertig für´n zwacken, Hindrich
Did you let Tom and Rick have a go?
Dirt & a little bit of snow/dirt drift trike (needs deeper snow, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zy5rkw4SeP4 worked better). I think a knobbly will give you year round fun, especially with a rain dance. So you need an Iron. How's that gonna work?
Colin! Y don't u make a makeshift ultralight plane?
It look as safe as sex without a condom with a prostitute... but I bet it's fun 👍
That's a pretty sweet snow trike you got there, Colin
Colin loved the tyre cover method, most bodgers would have just wacked the bolts through the tyre. I have just been building a unpowered snow bike that wouldnt steer, some kiteboard fins solved that.
Funny thing is that I never watch snow ❄️ in my entire life
That is not a Ski Trike that is now a tractor
91 sheep farmers "disloiked 'im scaring moi sheeps"
Bro;)         Love 💖 from Pakistan 🇵🇰
Can you turn it into a jets ski?
I should try the snow dance! _Just gets rain, because Florida._
Wher can buy something like this?
Colin, I suggested it on sam pilgrims channel, but you guys should definitely team up as he rides some crazy stuff too and if you made something bonkers, you could both ride it! random tandem style like martyn ashton! come on, how good would that colab be!?
you're a lune. Love it.
Ha ha and the government thought they could stop us having fun 🤣
im glad after all these years he hasn't changed and is still the maniac we know and love
what about skis that push you along so you don't have to carry poles!
RIP to that field
i showed my dad this and the first thing he said was that he wanted a shed like yours.
Ad a track to the ski trike like a snow mobile.
I'm kind of curious on how well that would work on mud.
I want you to become prime minister
Bloody crazy man absolutely love it 👊👊
this video wins the internet today. congrats Furze
Awesome!!!
Colin u are a genius idiot :D
Enjoyed the change of pace on the intro music and the music during the build. Good job on the trike!
Who needs a sheepdog when you've got that?! 😂
Me as a canadian: "That's not snow, thats a dusting"
Make a 2 stroke one like mine that rolls over and burns people! Actually maybe not!
How about an ultralight aircraft? Chase down the local pigeons.
I would honestly love to see a tracked bicycle going over snow built by the amazing you. I would like it to be an electric powered vehicle though.
try the ski trike in desert and the go kart reacción engine wicht skis
STOP  SNOW DANCING  !! its affecting us to much in northern Europe.
You should have a look at "Larven": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larven In Swedish: https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larven
You need a frosen lake to get some speed!
colin why didnt u use the electric drift trike?
I love how he edited a horse sound effect over the sheep
Think it needs some fenders to keep the chunks of dirt from throwing about😂
and the sheeps goes like "waaaats thaaat nooise?, oooooooh Nooooo is Fuuuurrrzz, Ruuuuun awaaaaay"
Just add snow
Colin Furze, "Right we have some snow will it work" as he sets off tearing up the field literally.  Big Thumbs Up from me   ;-)
His leg almost getting caught on the fall bloody hell
What a brilliant idea! I'm going to make one to drift on a frozen lake :)))
less of a drift trike, more of a sheep bothering device. i love it!
can you make a moter sledge please
We plough the fields and scatter (sheep) !
Could you possibly make a drift trike twice as big?
Sitting on a motorized tricycle with a fuel tank between you legs couldn’t get much more dangerous.  Some commenter: put spikes on the wheels Colin: thats brilliant, heres a build montage!
Epic video Colin! Love your insane inventions! Keep up the incredible work caus your the only thing that keeps me entertained during lockdown!
I'd love to see that field in the late spring. They'll either be trails of mud or weird lines of extra tall grass where the spikes turned over and aerated the soil.
Thank you Colin for your little snow dance. Thanks to that we finally got a little bit of winter in Europe after several consecutive years of almost no snow and above 0 temperatures <3
Alguien más habla español, dígamen  que no soy la única latina que ve estás locuras
FYI the ski is 40+ years old!
Just saw it on TikTok and came straight over
Will it go across water? If you need a hand I’m north lincs.
Can we all just appreciate Colin's honesty, this is just great all around, keep on rocking it dude, see you next Furzday
Kart cross could be good
Those wheels look lethal😂😂 I love it🤘😆🤘
How come you can touch the plasma cutter so soon after it cuts? Do you edit it out or is it relatively safe to touch?? It's been a question on my mind for ages!
Great video, Colin!!
Wow, 2 hours ago.
I been living in my house almost my entire life and only once have seen snow once
Lucky you didn't shred you leg when you came off. What a nutty trike.
awesome 😻also play more ska!
Ska music in 2021?  YES PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!
Im thinkin a Drift trike with two floors like a double decker bus? A drift unicycle? DRIFT SCREWTANK!! I dont even know how that would work hahaha
How to make aerating your grass fun! Or how to remove top soil either or
can you add proper differential?
That song is the best montage music ever! Well done.
When aloud you should Host a drift Bike day for people to bring theres have a little drive round and show off our creations.
Dude I copied your exact snow dance and haven't gotten any snow yet in southern california?!
Chúc mừng năm mới chúc anh năm mới dồi dào sức khỏe co nhiều video cho mọi người xem nhé
What about a motor sledge so you don't have to carry it back to the top of the hill and could go very fast down it, just a thought
its like Lazy Town, just beat never drops. always waiting.
Alright Colin, hear me out. Jet. Powered. Bobsled.
Haven't watched far enough yet but thinking those tires would be badass in the snow with some cat claws lining the tires in a regular distribution. For those unfamiliar, they look like cat paw cookie cutters about the size of your thumb. Bolt onto tires or treads to give them some bite icy snow.
Young Rick Sanchez
Get some (or build them) gokart tracks for those rear wheels, then you have proper snow traction.  Mud and sand too!
So much fun for just one man ,,,can I have a go Colin
I would love for you to make a go kart and take it to a track and see how it stacks up
If you were able to add an additional set of wheels on the back you could add tracks and make a snowmobile
So casual about nearly losing a leg
Next video will be. Making my drift trike into a jet and starting an airline called furzeair
Don't ever let them send you on a Health and Safety risk assessment course, it would be the end of your channel!
The music in this video reminds me of the robbie rotten songs
His Shirt may not be ironed but at least he still has his safety Tie on... next thing you know he would have converted his rickshaw for the snow
Why not just use chains instead of "spikes"? Ripping up the grass.
Colin, I think you should make a mud version of the drift -trike because that would be really cool.😎
maybe it is bether, if you put patles on the tyres and the bolts down!!!
I would love to see the Furze take on the Mountainboard. Electric boards are the new thing and are as safe as houses (30-40mph strapped to a plank with wheels on, whats not safe about that). What can you do to Furze them up a bit? Maybe get in touch with the guys at Trampa (UK based Mountainboard manufacturer and world leader in electric boards) for a collab?https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5EYFQqagKd2pCkXEIo_IRQ
Make a disel one ??
Steam powered trike next?! 🤯
What does a furze clothes iron look like? Black powder heated? Torso & arms-shaped balloon heated by jet engine?
Hell YEAH!!!!!
Colin that's a great soil aerator you built.
Wow! Furze is good!
You should add some metal tabs coming off the wheels like a snowmobile track
THE best Snow Dance EVER, you got it!!!😂🤣😂👍🏼😉👌🏼
Killing it as always and the music is on point as well.
with such bolts you need protection on the wheels.  take care of yourself
Ahh yes a dose of Colin furze insanity
We in northern sweden would love this machine!!!
What an absolute genius
Креосан такое уже давно Зделал
I've been here watching for 6 years (don't coment a lot if you are gonna check ) and this man has never worn anything except that it's like he doesn't own any other clothes
Oh my goodness, right as you did the snow dance (which was hilarious btw) it STARTED SNOWING HERE! I live in Washington State which means snow is pretty rare here. You do wonders Colin!
O Colin I love you!
Absolutely brilliant ✊
Furze engineering asmr
Look up grind hard plumbing the Barbie car is  amazing
"oh dear, we've snapped the chain"😂😂😂 love it Furze
👹☠👹☠😂🤣😂👍
It's Furzeday!
You need to make a hydrogen powered drift bike.
The opening music sounds like "We Are Number One!"
You could put suspension/chockabsorbers on the front forks and swap the wheels for snowmobile tracks. That way you could drive in even deeper snow, and it wouldn´t tear up the ground.
Very good choice of music And the video is also great
jet engine 🤘🤘🤘
As far as the shirt, those are just summer creases. Some are here and some are there.
You look like an Australian shepherd if Australia had snow.
6:09 Boris, is that you? xD
Here's a challenge for ya furzie.... picture a unique bike... the one with you sitting inside the wheel... but its wider say near a meter.. and with 2 tracks.... this way it can turn like a tank..... strap some rockets to it n call it a day!!! Yeh or nah?
Make a machine where you throw in a wrinkled shirt and it comes out ironed and maybe also on fire.
6:19 That's some weird looking horses you have in the UK ;-)
Colin!  it's not working well those spikes on the tires with that snow. it's better on ice! you should have set caterpillars for the snow like ski doo's
Does anyone know where you could actually ride a trike like this (or rather how it was before)?
Make one that goes on the water now with paddles on the back wheels and a wider front ski.
"We are number one" at the beginning almost made me not hate ska...Almost.
Imagine having a job that you have to rag round a field full throttle I know there’s editing and stuff but still sick job
What a hoot!  Loved it Furzey!!
Make one that flies now.  Oh wait, you already did that...
The first song ist just "We are number one" with different notes.
Needs to be on ice! :D
Plzz make a snow speeder from star wars🥰
Very cool music! 🤘🤘🤘
Your dance worked too well, because we are now on track to get 10-15 inches of snow in Oklahoma (US) O_O - Not a normal thing for us
The craziest man on the internet LOL
Definitely need to see you make a crazy bike for Sam Pilgrim that guy will ride anything will wheels
Colin where would one find Sir Brundle riding said trike?!   Love the work! Also nice neon, would like to know who made it as a neon glass bender myself.
If there is still snow, maybe you could make some type of snowball thrower
Watching Colin cut a ski up breaks my heart, but it's for a good cause
ar you crazy man
Hey Colin, you should soMe how make some paddle tires for it for in the deeper snow
Completely bonkers! Love it!
That's awesome
Petition to Make a pulse jet snowmobile!
Safety: *EXISTS*   Colin: We Don't Do That Here!!😁
YES!! COLIN IS BACKKK
Need a furz insta fast shirt press with a safety tie press attachment
first song sounds like a remix of that song 'we are nubmber one'
Best snow dance EU!! Oh wait, right.... brexit D:
your life, my dream
Colin Furze school of measuring, place parts to be cut in place....and just eye it.
I still think new Top Gear would have had a decent chance if they had hired this guy instead of any of the boring todgers they actually took.
Needs converting into a mini snowmobile!! Awesome video!
that's one way to plough a field
Brazil  Não sei oq vc fala mais acho doído seus. Vídeos ...
Why isn't this snow dance working here
Lol chasing them sheep horses 😂
Yoh I think you need to install some snow guards otherwise known as mudguards and snowfield otherwise known as windshield... Cool project though bro🤗
Make a hydraulic shirt press;)
Smashing good idea. I love it.  Well done Mr. Furze
Don't wear off
Yoyf Chanel ua very cool!!!
First song sounds like a 144p We are number one
When will you build xour rocket to mars???
For the re-make of Mad Max!       In Finland...   😆
HE SAID ITS DANGEROUS,  BUT DIDNT USE SAFETY GEAR,  HE FELL DIDNT HURT HIMSELF🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 does he have some disaster avoiding powers🙄😅🙂
Colin 100 points for the ska... Ska will never die... Pick up pick up....
A Collin Furze/Grind Hard Plumming Co. collab would be sick
Would be cool if u made one with tank/snowmobile treads 😂
Put a runner on the ski dude it will turn easier
Definitely need a V2 of this one!!
Now thats a thing i LOVED to have ago on !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Song at the start reminds me of we are number one... I CANT UNHEAR IT.
i wanna be rich too 🥺
eh. doesn't look as fun as the normal trike. seems like it's kind of slow in the snow/mud. Might be better with zig zag paddle type tires?
Snow aint deep enough and adding angle iron plates latteraly across the tyre surface would have been much more effective rather than bolts :(   EDIT (Ideally 20x20 and as close to touching each other as possible over the circumference.) Then a pity that more folks are likely to have a welder than a plasma cutter.... lol
YOU SHOULD COLLAB WITH THE SIDEMEN!!
Waren dat de Nederlandse schapen van Rutte?
Hilarious
My man uses Atomics on his tricycle. You've got style, I´ll give you that
You need to take that on the ice!
How about a hover drift.  Electric bike  front wheel  with a small hovercraft instead of rear wheels and lift provide by a furzejet
I dub thee "Shepherd Colin"
Hmmmm... Am I the only one who finds hard to understand his English 🙄🙄
You're not wearing a helmet mate !
I'd like to support your endeavors even more. Please design  a rather minimalist t shirt. Safety tie mini logo on the heart? Furze logo on the upper back? Don't mind if i do
That’s the nuts
So what if you put the jet pack on the back of instead of the motor?
Can I borrow it to aireate my lawn this summer.
Spoilt by awful noise
Slight modification to the rear tyres 20mm high  bolted on angle iron paddles   keep the ski = drift bike for the beach
Defunded because of 3:57 😂😂😂
Cue epic montage!!!🤩😎
Fantastic 😂🤣🤣🤣👍😁👌👌👌
this is really awesome.
Check out the video I made about colin’s world of invention puzzle !!
Fenders Colin, Fenders!
How do you do you make a drift trike electric without welder
You know... In a strange way, Colin, you've basically turned your drift trike into a homemade snowmobile. I mean, it's got a ski on the front that you control via the handlebars, and the wheels act like a snowmobile's track.
Awesome video,  but....... My 5 year old son asked "why isn't he wearing a helmet" 🤔 safety first, first aid last⛑️👍
Alright, you've presented a problem with wrinkly shirts and I hope there's a crazy solution for a step in clothes ironer coming someday in the future.
send that to my ski area in switzerland
Jet powered ski trike ha
Today where I live in Canada it’s -50c, wish me luck bois
The tea machine
Furz (german word) = flatulence
amazing
instructions were unclear a tire with spikes is now stuck around my neck
Should of put a ski rod in the middle of the ski like snowmobiles
THAT IS SICK BROOOO
Almost as cool as my Squealer..... lol On a side note I really wish I had that FAB SHOP!!! Yes I am JEALOUS!!!!
wow, i really want one to ski down a hill
Great. Was even nicer  if the 7daze runaway song was oj it
Epic
That thing still sounds like a stretched fart.
👍
You crazy SOB I love it 👨‍🏭
Best YouTuber
Peerrrrrfect music :)
Horse sound with sheep? 6:19
This is awesome! I'm definitely going to make a drift trike this summer
Have you tried making an aquaski Colin?
Just because of Colin I built myself a trike with my dad it is so awesome.
Down in Bishops Stortford, we got almost no snow but like a mile away got like 5 inches snow. Unbelievable :(
Oh man I missed colin
Cool now make the front end swap out so you can use it in the summer and winter with ease
Time to start saving up!
That snow dance helped a lot
Подзвучка группа "Ленинград"? ))
Sold my Trike Four weeks ago. That was a misstake 😅
First song sounds a lot like we are number 1 from lazy town 😂
Oh man i would have put some sort of protectors on the wheels... you've got some balls, colin
i think paddled wheels would be more effective than spiked wheels! probably safer too
We Engineers are mad
WHAT A MACHINE best quote ever
Ey Furze , why ya plowing ma field again mate?
6:20 lol  why the horse sound effect?
You need a snowmobile style ski on the front for more steering control and taller rear tires - then it will be a ripper.
I think a ski with Carbides would steer much better.... still awesome!
Nice. I like it. How about giving it tracks? More traction? Beef up the chain drive and ad a 2nd ski in the front suspension. Better stearing.
Where the hell does he put all the stuff he makes? I know for a fact that screw tank isn't getting into the bunker.
Boom and he's done it again the absolute madlad
Noice👌👍
The sheep seemed impressed 🐑😀
I love the sign in the background
I got your book for my birthday and I am going to build the milk bottle raft it is such a good book 👍👍👍
Can we just appreciate the fact that the music on Every. Single. Video. Is absolute fire
Ok, now do that with your pulse jet.
more front ski square? inches? mm?
Wear a helmet. If for no other reason than to set a good example for your younger viewers.
There is a problem --- Colin = solution😎
The music in this one is a perfect fit!
Colin: Its eazy Me: How?!
مقاطع ضحك وتحشيش😂 https://youtu.be/w3CBVLYY5NI
COLIN YOU LEGEND
Who else thought the background music was We are number one?
dang you make it look so easy
Skis and spikes wins every time 👍 Sweet video man!
God I wish I was your neighbour!!
Amazing
I'd like to make this but being in Australia I don't think there's much of a point
the fact he can make all of these from scratch is amazing.
Hey Collin where do you keep all your old projects?
Lmao the snow dance.
I’m the 1000 comment
Next time: Colin mounts a pulsjet to His Ski trike 😂
you call that "snow"? that could work on any ol field, but you need more than 5cm of powder snow to call it "snow"!! :P
good music
I knew with the snow that us brits got you would do something wacky
Whenever I see studded tires without any sort of guard, my brain immediately goes to picturing falling on these while driving :|
Colin you should take the wheels off a skateboard it’s so fun and it’s like snowboarding
Can’t wait to see your crazy modded wheelchair when you finally go too hard.
Colin you got to take this somewhere with deeper snow and give it a go
Good Job
The only thing I would do differently, would be to use part of a waterski instead
A Few Nth Yorks Farmers would invest for Herding
I want one....
Great vid. Snow is cool but this thing would shred on a frozen lake
Cool video 👌👍 You should make a jet powered snowboard 🏂
Cool video!  What’s nice is you do it proper by using correct tools and fabrication techniques!  Great demonstration of fabrication and machining
You should collaborate with Grind Hard Plumbing Co.
soooo nice...rock it...🌲🌲🌲🤙
Thx Colinfurze for the idea to spike the PVC pipe! What a easy on / off idea to ice stud any off road tire!  Atv - dirtbike - Car / truck !!! Just slip the slip the studded pipe over and inflate !
Call it the trikeski
انا معجب بأعمالك هل يمكنك تحويل دراجة هوائية عادية الى دراجة نارية بأسهل طريقة؟
6:20 Horse Sheep! (sheep horses?!) 😆  Sheep that sound like horses or horses that look like sheep? 🤔 Brilliant 👌🏼
Go with tank like treads on the back like a snow mobile. Sweet conversion though!
Jet bike =ski jet bike
Evil GENIUUUUS!!!
Забавный тип
5:07 what song its?
Why don't you make a ultimate shirt steamer? Never iron your shirt again!
LOOKS SOOO MUCH FUUUNN!!
Impressive dude,impressive
I reckon if you made that engine shield a bit lower to lift the rear wheels off the ground a bit you could lean to lower a wheel and turn then heave upright to slide on the shield and front ski. Go on, you know you want to! :-)
Top on YouTube 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Furze you're a mad man and I love it!
hahaa this think would be awesome without snow as well.
The world needs more Colin Furze!
Fåren kan bli skrämda av ljudet från Maskinen
👏👏👏👍👌🇳🇴😷
God I hope I never read these words.    Colin Furze .. head injury.  Put on a helmet.
Can you build a plane?
You should put a trigger like accelerator on that like motor quad ( or atv idk how they call them in UK ) so when you fall yo dont get stuck on the gas
Beautiful
Could you make a gyro car
If the Red coach where more like you in 1776 We The People would still be drinking Tea!
make automatic ironing machine
Where is the CR 250 engine?? Grettings for Spain!!
Now make it 600cc
that was awesome Colin
The most fun lawn aerator ever!!!
Its really nice..... you could also build a caterpillar drive instead of the wheels
https://youtu.be/pBSUAe2N2lE
pissing myself laughing .
Risktaker mobile 50/50 chance u live or die
Colin, number 1 💯💯💯💯💯💯👍❤️
Super cool
Every time The Algorithm shows me one of your videos I always end up thinking "how is he still alive or at the very least not grievously injured?". Today was no different.
Snow dance
I would enjoy seeing you craft a small submarine.
Therapist: Snow dance Colin isn’t real, he can’t hurt you  Snow dance Colin at 1.5x speed: 4:07
I'm loving the new intro
If there was a Ramp it will be more fun.
WAIUP
Nice!!!!!!!
What about a Mark Rober colab?
Great job. Just should have put a runner on the ski. (look up how snowmobiles do it)
Now load some huge snow balls on your trebuchet and go play a snowball battle. You know you have to do it.
You need to make one with tracks for rear wheels...
Why don't you make your drift trike with a toaster on the back. It would be great!!!!!!!
How about a hover trike, mini hovercraft on which you can drift anywhere you want.
Yo u should put tracks on the back and do something crazy
Physics
ive never clicked faster.
I today did a huge oopsie i did math All Day and now a friend told me that i was using the wrong tequnik all Day and i háve to do it all over But harder i want to die
Plz do more vids with the hilux
Wait until he finds out about snowmobiles 😂
AWESOME. :)
Me: *taking a test* My last brain cell: 4:07
SPARK SLEVES??
You need more POWER
sidemen vs colinfrze ?
This and Make it Extreme are my two best channels. Love the creations.
two dollars. Cash
I love that you still work in your humble shed.
one day I might be able to meet you thanks for your video work
EgonSorensen you genius
Best work ever - to create craaazy machines!😄😄😄
I’ve been watching this channel for over 30 years now and Colin hasn’t gotten any older! What’s going on here?
🤔 Put some kinda lil hull on it n some paddles on the wheels n hey-presto you can do that great stuff on plain old water (sea/lake/etc) anytime.. Oh..already invented - jet ski 😆.. 🤔 Actually, prob leave it as it is n give it a good thrashing on a sandy beach - similar summer fun maybe..? Keep it up the Mr Furze - you're a leg end no end 👌🏼
Give one of these to Sam Pilgrim, hell end up doing a backflip on trike lool
Epic!
What’s with the explicit songs all of a sudden, thought it was more of a family channel
2nd worst thing to be run over by
Next you have to take the bumper car in the snow
Ein Kommentar
Sickest Roto-Tiller on earth.
Aku suka bentuknya rasanya mau membuat sama
Need me one of those with a trailer to help get shopping from the delivery van to the door Got one spare Mr Furze? Can do pickup lol 😅
Great mods! One safer and probably more effective alternative would  have been paddle slats like snowmobile tracks. Looks like a blast! Good one Furze! You are an engineering marvel!
For a v2 I can see trying to use a cut down snowboard to replace the cut down ski, and using paddle tires in the rear.
Now THAT looked fun!
Snow is no place for a drift trike.. Ice on the other hand... Let's go!!!! Saw blades for tires perhaps???
4:10 Jajaja 😆😂 Buen Ritmo ☝🏽👉🏽👍🏽
@colinfurze. Thank you for the power of genius. Stay safe
0
Can you make a tandem drift trike please
Great Work ❣💪💪💪💪💪
Colin furze if you have frozen lakes, make a powered surfe board or something and and surf the frozen lake, or go into the water and use a powered surf board
Keep up the great work I've subscribed if your reading this you should Checkout my solo game dev channel I would truly appreciate your subscription
Heel nice
Best Youtube channel. Colin 🤘🏻
U should make a fire tornado in the snow
That thing needs some fenders. I was nervous one of the spikes was going to grab onto a pant leg or something.
Great thrift bike Colin 👍👍. But i have a challenge for you, build a quad copter you can ride in just like your hover bike.
Not to much grip NOT ENOUGH HORSE POWER!!
Colin may I suggest instead of bolts sticking out for grip. Use replacement cleats, the kind you would put on sneakers for field sports. Yes you would go through more of them, but would probably give you the right kind of traction. They should be fairly easy, if not easier, to replace then the bolts. All in all, jealous I couldn't ride that, looks like a blast.
That is the business! Many thanks.
you should try and make a jet ski that can go on land and water
6:17 Horse sounds hahahahaha
thank you for keeping ska alive :)
Put titanium in the plastic tire shells so they spark on the pavement
Hey Colin I just noticed u put the wrong sound effect in for the animals 6:19 😊
Drive it over a frozen lake
It's like watching the Grindhard Plumbing crew tear up, haha
"Safety" is a word that I'm sure Colin knows.  Not sure if it's application is understood though.  Live long and keep building.
this is the snow bike Sam Pilgrim wishes he could make
Mmmm... A mud bike..
a dirtbike to snowbike conversion (furze style) would be interresting as well
Every time I watch, I'm always glad I'm not the only one who still likes ska!  And we all know it came before reggae
Ska music and death spike trike. Furze time for everything.
The snow dance was mesmerising.
Should take it out on the tarmak at night get it sparking
I always look forward to your videos 🤙
When you don't have spikes just use screws
about the grip,  soft (not even frozen) ground with hardly any snow :D  of course it's gonna have some grip Colin.
Your videos are very good, but you should wear a helmet 😄
Surprised u didn’t build a pulse jet sled or something
You are just insane 😄😄😄
Yes the blade might did in and flip , Yes the skid plate might cut your leg off Yes the wheels might shred your skin and arms BUT THATS WHY SAFETY TIES WERE MADE FOR !!!!. Keep calm and put your official Furze safety tie on 🤪
Maybe put some  guards over the rear wheels?
If the snow was alive well NOW IT ISNT
This is old school Furze! Lots of danger and engineering. Simple.
6:21 That horse sound really got me😂
7:06 was terrifying. That's all.
1:32 I wanted to start singing we are number one
It's 12 in the morning, just about to sleep. Then my notifs goes and shows me this.
Like to see it on some more snow
Make an rc snowplow next!
Brilliant bit of ska on your video today.
Colin "sheep worrier" Furze  back at it again.
Nice one, Colin! Next will be with a wider ski and one short track in back plus more snow! :D
pulse jet powered sled
Only you will do this
Now you just need to make a hover trike.
Colinfurze, could you make a tank but with wheels instead of tracks from armoured warfare. Just look it up on google if you don't know what armoured warfare is.
You should make your lawnmower mow snow and spit snow balls
Видео топ
Next thing you know he will be making a rocket to mars
Я бы хотел себе такой агрегат
колесо могло нанести травму.
What a great way to aerate your lawn.
Furze why don't you put that ice wheel on this drift trike
You should try making a jet powered grit machine
👍🔥 Поднял настроение !)) well done, cheered me up !))
Add some snow, some wheel guards, longer central ski to prevent rolling and it will be perfect :)
It's time for Collin to go skiing! - Just come over to Switzerland once it's save again! ⛷
That is a bad ass little trike
Definitely is a “bit more Furze” now 😁
The best 4:07
I think SKA has to thank colin for bringing it back some.
I can imagine Colin and mark rober building a private space rocket
you're awesome mate!
Shirt needs ironing and tie needs binning.
Imagine what I thought when I looked down from heaven and saw a grown man shredding a field on a snow drifter.
So funny🤣🤩🥰so cool❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Looks fun but probably slow
You sir, are a bloody genius
Colin, I loved the music you used. Reminds me of Madness /Two-Step/Ska of the days I was very little
Those sheep thought snow was confusing.
Make pls a stearable bobsled for real men, like with jet or propeler drive
hey collin whens the wood fire powered bunker project will it ever get a look at?
Amazing bro 🎁💖🎁💖🎁💖🎁👍🎁👍
So your the person to blame for nearly a week full of snow 😂😂😂😂😂
I bet Colin is one big mid life crisis
Yay
Please try on Iced Lake!!
Geez Colin, I know you're protected with the Safety Tie but how about some wheel guards before you lose a leg! (probably build a new leg outta car suspension though) lol
Yeah, seems to work great^^
that has to be the greatest snow dance I've ever seen
:o)
Ska isn't dead!
Always amazed by your creation,🔥🔥🔥 I'll also be into fabricating my designs which I post in my YouTube, I'm always inspired by you bro❤️❤️
was starting to mis mr Furze
Nice
Spiked wheels are great for ice but for land you need paddle tires instead of bolts put angle iron on the tires with the point facing out
I like you kanal! I am you phanat!
Name it Triski!
Always entertained and learning from you fella. Don't go changing to please🥲🤌🏻
Coolinfurze.
100% a snow mobile needs to be made
If you put a keel on the front ski, you could use that on snow, sand dunes, or even a sandy beach!
Now That Is British Entertainment
farmer - “AAAY UP ... some nutter is chasing our sheep love ....... oh it’s ok it’s just FURZE “
Was planning on building myself a gas drift trike before I found your vids a while ago, every time I see you do one it adds to my idea, love your vids, keep inspiring!
What do you need that ski for? Colin: Just planning ahead  Also Colin: Who needs a ironed shirt?
Killing me with the snow dance(: good video
Fantastic idea and cool
You should be in Dr Who.
when colinfurze upload a video i know he will do a masterpiece
just and ideal before snow disappears for another 10 years, how about fitting the go kart with some grippy tyres and a beastly engine upgrade, the thing would handle a lot better and probably just as much fun to be had
Hey, I would like to see the following videos with you in the future - please use a helmet when you ride
Can you build a cool all-terrain vehicle without welding?
Can you make diy video on how to make tools or jig like that thing you use to cut the tube with hole saw. I know you can buy it but its not common in our area so i dont think i can buy it here.
💪💪💪💪
ХА ТЫ ПОЛНЫЙ ЛУЗЕР АХАХАХАХ
Now just to take it to some deeper snow . . .
Hier ist der Deutsche Kommentar den du suchst 🙏👌
The sheep 😂
Colin Furze: Inventor, Plumber, Shepherd
LOL 😆 I know the real reason those sheep were running so fast
You invented a riding garden tiller.
You have awaken my memories when i was 4 .
The legend has posted   # 🚗 🚘
So nice
What I love about this is that it's basically just bolts on to the trike frame itself.  You only have to build one trike and can change it up as the weather suits.
snow dance was hilarious, you should do the mobility scooter next
Brilliant video Colin! The trike had so much grip it was chucking dirt all over the place! It looks like you had a blast though, snow is very fun. I really liked the first rack you played, I will need to check it out. Thank you so much! 💛💛
Well now you need to put a jet engine on a snowmobile so you can have a literal jet ski!
Your son is gonna be the most popular kid at school ever 😅 Mini furze: Dad me and my mates are just taking the drift trikes out of a spin 🤣
HEY COLLIN HUGE FAN OF YOURS FROM INDIA.......IT WOULD MAKE MY DAY IF U ❤️ THIS ......... A LOTS AND LOTS OF LOVE.     I HAVE AN IDEA WHY DONT YOU MAKE A KITE CAR LIKE PARAGLIDER BUT WITH WHEELS....😀
Wish we had the amount of snow you did! We had buggerall down south!
NEXT UPDATE ! THE JET SKI TRIKE
Oh boy even more motorised trikes?
this was kind of like my suggestion, except it wasn't my comment you seen and I didn't think of the front mounted ski, although I did foresee the grip issue, should of known you would have had a plan Mr safety tie
Fun project
This reboot of "Mad Max" looks very British.
Who else remembers his assassins creed syndicate inspired grappling hook
what you got planned for easter? how about a easter egg gattling gun? or even a mechanical opening easter egg with a easter bunny inside it throwing easter eggs at people..?
O god here we go again...
3:14 I swear he said KEEMSTAR!
Hey colin, can you make a 10 hour version of the snow dance please!
Love everyone of your videos... WE NEED YOUR VIDEOS EVERY FURZEDAY where have you been?
Oh my god, I want a Front Wheel Drive version of that
Có ai việt nam ko  CHÚC MỪNG NĂM MỚI TẤT CẢ MỌI NGƯỜI
Imagine if you fell off onto that tire. Please be safer so you stay around doing this shit.
I was thinkin you dont wana come off on those long spikes... then you nearly did when you came off the back 😂 ...you need a way to retract the spikes when you get up to speed for the ultimate snow drift
You just turned over his field for free what a good friend
Alternative title: British man makes 2 wheeled snow scooter, and changes biome using a dance.
This man could literally build his own rocket if he wanted too...
you're easily the best content creator on this site
I swear If I asked him to make a spaceship, he could
Use tracks next time
Excellent video The Ski Trike, my respect from Venezuela.💯👍👊🤘
Seeing him do this makes me happy  Kinda like watching Bob Ross paint something
2:05 Toothed pipe eating a Toothless pipe.... AWESOME! 🦈
That's one hell of a sheepdog
Sweet   2x 👍
Those tires are so dangerous without any sort of covers. They would shred your skin into pieces.
Congratulations from Canada 🇨🇦 for inventing the worst skidoo! Caterpillars you see...
Possible future video: I know you made a bed that launches you out of it if you sleep to long. What about making a bed that is easier to fall asleep in? Maybe something that mimics the feeling that makes you sleepy on long car rides? Edit : not really the sounds but the vibrations? I don't know if it actually is the vibrations that make you sleepy though.
Pls make snow dance tutorial
Now make it float and go drift water skiing
Luckily your right leg didn't get chewed up when you fell off! :D
Snow bikes/trikes are a thing...if anyone wants to buy one.
"My shirt needs ironing" Colin make a pulse jet iron😂😂 or use the old transformer from the instant toast video and make a glowing red instant iron (I imagine the clothes won't hold up but still fun!)
It's awesome bro
Can you make your own submarine?
What about make a motorized little car
Farmers can shoot you for sheep worrying!  😜
I got a daft idea, a live steam locomotive (like ones you would run in your garden) powered by wood gas.
bri'ish moment
How painfull would it be if you just slid onto the spikes.
You should make something with tracks!! that would be epic!
You could make a automatic over the top ironing device
Hear me out,  drift trike with 2 PBS TJ100 sports grade mini jet engines
hey colin nice intro please can u make my bike videos they are my favorite
jsjssjjs
Furze, you should change out the skii with a snow mobile ski, they will give you more grip when you are turning
Could you please make a survival vehicle of some kind or a van conversion love your videos
This dude could probably take over the world with an army of robots   And after he would say “it’s pretty simple”
Awesome job! Just about had your leg grinded off too. Madness!!
now make a steam powered drift bike
Хорош
You make my day mate need to make a twin seat drift trike
can you build a ski and drift trike in 1
me: sees snow also me: yay snow day no school! school: only 5 inches of snow no snow day come to school me: * does snow dance * school: there are now magically 3 feet of snow wth * announces snow day * me :)
all im thinking while he's driving is: gas gas gasss
Damn bro this guy is explaining how he can get his feet cut off he is so excited about it
Oh Yeah!
Мозги не продул ?😊
Maybe build an automatic ironing device for your Shirts 😛👌
Next.. sea trike
Cool.
Colin is *the best!* !! With best regards Nico from Nico's Projects (tryin to be the German Colin Furze :-D )
Colinfurze I want to see if it’s possible to build a Electric modopogo that not just drives on the road but in the SNOW???
woooohooo this looks like a blast!
Next drift trike with a kite yay
4:00 So THAT'S why we got a good bit of snow this winter. Cheers Colin!
Now do the same with the tuk tuk
:)))
This is goddamn cool :D
Radical
👍super
Meow hello Colin furze I enjoyed the video
This is great
Now you need tracks on it now so it really will become one hell of a snow biter
I feel sorry for those animals, he scared the shoes out of them
I read it as the Tri strike
You should make kingsman's taxi with all its features.😃😃
SUPER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Colin Furze is the best thing to come out of Britain since Benedict Cumberbatch.  Change my mind.

Try an add tracks to the mr bean chair and trow. 998cc motorbike engine in it
Colin Furze  -always on the next level!
Brillant.  Love the idea and being in a Snow region state, this would be so brilliant...
Its only been 11 minutes and tons of people have liked and commented
While walking back from school, I thought about the idea of using some racket shoes ( the ones for snow) , and make them heat up. So it melts the ice and snow underneath!
shovel tires are better in snow then spike tires... spikes are for ice
He is the guy, whatever he is doing is having fun 😂
ello colin!
"oh yeah, this is a maaachine" -Colin furze 2021
Excellent work as always sir.. 🙂👍
Oh man! Wish we Indians had you! You'd be the most jugad engineer ever! Btw Nice snow dance lol
I am planning on moving to Alaska after I finish University. I will absolutely have to build one of these to make the Alaskan Winter more fun.
Love this man🥰
Those Lincolnshire sheep do sound a bit odd!
I bet those sheep were piste at Colin
Love from india good work
Boom
You should put the dune style tires on it for the snow. Or something along the lines of a snowmobile track with paddles. You should also try it as is on the ice. Those bolts would have perfect traction on some ice.
that field's gonna look like a ww1 battleground when the snow's gone XD
10k views in 7 minutes

I didn't know Tom was Welsh.
You should build a wood powered pickup truck like how you did with the lawn mower
Fogo no gelo.
Pure genius
Absolutely amazing! Great idea. Wish I was there to play.
Jesus his right leg looked very close to getting ripped off by the right rear wheel when fell off the back
Nobody, the camera man watching Collin have all the fun:
Swear for his next video he's gonna try to attach surfboards on it and get it on the water
RIP the field
snow dance was going mad
Yet another furze toy to put on my  “I just gotta have one “ list. At the top!!
He started with tyres... to cover them and remove the tyres... to turn them back into tyres...
Now Col's worried those sheep does he have to be put to sleep?
Hey Colin just wondering but when you do these videos do you give the other people your with a go on it or do they not want to?
Christmast party 4:09
Excellent music choice!
Instagram:omeryildz_
cant belive that my favourite Fart uploads again <3
Snow pleasures at full power.
Beautiful conversion, but might I suggest paddles instead of spikes? Seems like you're just gripping dirt through the snow, rather than the snow itself.  Might do for some wheel covers/cowls too.
Put tracks on the back!!!! Make some tracks
good idea
Ah yes, a new Colin Furze video. Never change my man your content is amazing.
It will be cool if you put snowmobilie tracks on the wheels
Snow thin w
Collins you have missed so many million subscriber fireworks
EPIC
Cool!
Great job on your videos! Keep up the great work!
Colin what a lad
4:07 im just only now realized this man is CRAZY
Nice
The tires were throwing more grass then snow lol
Lut some guards over the wheels
What cc is that engine
You are amazing, you are crazy
Super cool and I love your videos😀👍🏻
You desere a jet powered iron...
Do the hover bike
good idea

Make a full on homemade car
3:54 😂

A properly safe Furze modification!!
The snow dance is magnificent.
You should add med guard to the Tyre it might be safe
Now this is how I have fun in the snow, Nicely done 👍
