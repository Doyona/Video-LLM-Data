Peak movie
7:58 he crying / emotional and it’s so sweet. But the juxtaposition of the guy in the front lol
"you know that song ?" ,,,,,what "??
You guys have the best reaction to this trailer!! Love you two!! Granted I have seen this reaction 5 too many times!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
One of marvels best!!!
Your partner said he doh know this song shoot him
This ain’t a normal marvel movie. It seems like because it’s different, nobody likes it…???
This trailer still chokes me up....its crazy
This movie is pure beauty, I cried a lot it was so beautifully done
I was about to skip this video at the half because there was no real emotion but I decided to keep watching for the 2nd time you guys played the trailer, and when I saw the darker skin dude shedding a tear then I was like: “Aite, he felt that for real” and I subscribed at that point.
Chills 😅 we need at least 4 blk panthers they just greatest movies ever !!..
When the Queen says - her entire family is gone -- at that moment -- they were all gone! Beautiful speech.
One question: How the Fk has this dude never heard Bob Marley's track?! WTF
The movie is emotional 😥 an exciting. Some fans are wearing white to the movie to honor Chadwick. T'Challa wore white when he had a dream of his father. That's why they're wearing white in the movie to pay tribute to Chadwick.
🤣Had 👟👟so long 👟👟turned to flip flops....
They didn't need to kill off T'Challa though.
Cinematically, the Black Panther movies are head and shoulders above the rest of the Marvel universe. No shade to the other directors and cinematographers, but the look and feel are completely different.
he never heard of bob marley?
Man y’all Jeepers creepers 3 reaction about to be funny as hell. That mf is worst than the last one 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 Lord
2 of the funniest legends...fire...fire 🤣
They knew the message everyone needed about this movie. Without even knowing the plot, Ryan showed he's got this.
If Marvel takes things seriously then THEY FUCKING TAKE THINGS SERIOUSLY!
like for that cool intro guys!
19K Thumbs Up + Mine! 👍.  Thanks for the fun, digital video recording! 🎬 ✌️😎🖖  Note: I'm looking forward to it! 🎊🎉
we all know how folks get with black leads in the MCU and STAR WARS  ---- they gonna hate anyway
Apparently "whites" aren't allowed for opening weekend by the "in-crowd" 🙄
😢
Bob Marley No Woman No Cry: DAMN. It's going 2 b TUFF watching this film in Nov. Keep in mind: Namor came out in 1939, Aquman came outin '42.
Be honest lads...you watched this trailer beforehand?
Killmonger
This is gonna be an emotional rollercoaster for me but I'm all for it. R.I.P. Chadwick Boseman!
That trailer gets u hyped!
Anyone else kinda wish TChalla wasn’t dying? I feel like Chadwick wouldn’t have wanted the character to die with him idk that’s just me
The "guy" you're talking about was created in the comics BEFORE DC's Aquaman   AND FOR THE RECORD:  Bily Batson USES the word "SHAZAM" to transform INTO "Captain Marvel"!  THIS character PREDATES Marvel's Captain Mar-Vell!  Besides, what sense does it make for the characters name be the same as the command?   "Hey what's your name?" "Shazam" LIGHTNING BOLT!!!!! "Who the hell are you?" "Well golly, I'm Billy Batson."  Breaking News:  This idiot's career as a superhero is over!!  Death by dumb ass court decision!!!
This trailer makes me wanna watch The Black Panther movie again, for only the 14th time now..
they flip flops now got me
Was that an Aztec Pyramid in the beginning
who? Namor?
I love that you wore the necklace for this. Noble honor for this beloved hero. I read Black Panther comics way back when he wore that silly half cape, which they thankfully got rid of soon. Chadwick is T’Challa Black Panther. Forever.
This movie looks terrific and will no doubt be the highlight of "Phase 4" (at least I hope). But after reading a thorough post on the subject, which got me thinking- I kinda wish they would have recast T'Challa- .   I loved Chadwick Boseman and his body of work speaks for itself. However, T'challa is a big deal in the comics,  killing him off and not being able to fully tell his story I think long-term is a disservice to the character and to the black community.  It would be akin to killing off Tony Stark after Iron Man 2 if RDJ passed away.  Having said all that. This film is sure to pay homage to CB and will be full of emotion. Can't wait to see it.
I think the actual villain for this movie is not namor
With iron heart help I believe Shuri is the black Panther! Namor looks great and Namor is before Aquaman in books but of course on screen Aquaman first! This looks epic!
I cry when Angela Bassett started speaking about her family. Also check out the Woman King. Its about the Dahomey which are the original Dora Milaje.
Where the hell you guys been?
5:13 The look on Namor's face, he don't give NO fu@ks. 'Nuff said.
Simply: OOOOOOOSCAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRR!!!

Namor, Ironheart, the next Black Panther to Bob Marley's song. Bring it on!
Feel the same emotion... Cause what its mean to us as black people to see someone who looks like us as a superhero... It just...sighs.. Man Chadwick rest in peace man.. Damn this one got tear jerk
Looks like they're trying to colonize Wakanda, I saw that coming as soon as T'Challa decided to tell them about that vibranium.
The visuals in this trailer are beautiful 😭 bit of emotional but throw you for a loop, we don’t know if he passes in this movie through word of mouth or what idk what’s going on but this is Day 1. Some upset because they feel this isn’t doing him justice. Some might want that Fast 7 type vibe where Brian isn’t dead he’s just retired but the sad truth of them matter is he isn’t coming back💔 now yeah they could’ve done justice keeping him alive but we don’t know if that makes much sense to them. We’ll just have to see but give it a chance❤️‍🩹🖤
These dudes stay broke
Namor and Wakanda fighting together will be so epic…I just might cry the entire fight scenes!
This one looks more technically better than the first cg, cinematography looks really good
I hope disney give the studio enough time
Oohhh noooo it’s another feminist movie
Wakanda Forever vs Imperius Rex!  Only true marvel fans will understand 🔥
Rip Chadwick     Wakanda Forever
Got me all types of emotional watching this. This may take place during the 5 years of the decimation. If it is that may explain why he is dead and of course them explaining the earth quakes. It would be nice by the end of the movie they give us a glimpse of the new actor who will play Tchalla. I know a lot of people don’t want a replacement but you can’t get ride of the character itself. Either way I can’t wait for this! Wakanda Forever 🙅🏾‍♂️
If we pay attention to the burning water scene and how it is shown in the sequence of scenes, the trailer reveals that it was Shuri who became the new black panther
We gon be alright 👍
He said "You know that song?" Yo other people be knowin our history/culture better than us fr
Seeing Mexican pyramids in the background and Namor in Mexica armor (yes that's how you spell that) . Can't wait for this one!
Listen to this weeks Fatman Beyond , they had the man who made the trailer ( and many others )  on to discuss.
“SO,.. PO-WER-FULLL”. The Movie Hiding Behind This Trailer.,, IS TAKING ALL OF THE AWARDS… Starting with the Score. MARK MY WORDS. Phenomenal Trailer. GREAT REACTION... Very Heartfelt ❤️. Great job gentleman!!! Can’t wait. Tenoch Huerta THE MEXICAN 🇲🇽 Actor playing NEMOR,.. Is my favorite character in NARCOS MEXICO. That is where I first saw him,.. HE KILLED IT in NARCOS and he is going TO DESTROY IT as NEMOR. WAKANDA FOREVER BITCHES ✊🏽✊🏽. Peace ✌️ ☮️. VIVA 🇲🇽 MEXICO 🇲🇽 CABRONES!!!  🎵 “EVERYTHING 🎶 IS GONNA 🎶 BE ALLLRIGHT” 🎵 🎵
Crazy how much better this looks than DSMOM or Thor L&T
Marvel next level with their teaser trailers
I think it is Michael B Jordan because the Panther is  black and gold. (remember the first movie) He is Back!
Thats Power...FamiliePower,RespectPower,LovePower🙏🔥❤ ....do the world better for all🌱
The Church
And this is just the teaser trailer 🤯🤯
I can’t wait to see Namor and Riri Williams.
17k
It's as if the ancestors are whispering to us, on the title sequence. Straight goosebumps!
THIS is going to be another epic and truly emotional event!!! Ryan continues to surpass himself (at least this teaser makes it appear so). I still carry a heavy heart for Chadwick but I feel this will also be a celebration of the legacy of this great character. I am truly excited for the returning amazing cast and definitely hyped for the appearance of Namor and the Atlanteans!!  Love y'all!!
The fact that Angela Bassett is the only voice we hear in this trailer, they knew it was powerful
When dude in the red shirt didn't recognize Bob Marley's No Woman No Cry I almost shed a tear.
👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿
Cash grab vibes?? This doesn't feel right.
was here for your reaction for the first pb. i'm backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk.
Best marvel movie soundtrack is black panther follow by guardians of the galaxy. Super excited for this movie soundtrack!!!
Chadwick is the new James Dean. Taken far before they hit their acting peak. I'm excited for this movie.
The Black panther 1 trailer is what lead me to this channel, so I immediately thought of this channel when the BP2 teaser trailer came out.
Every Black person I know get emotional watching this,  because we got sooo much build up inside of us,
FYI, Namor was before Aquaman, so it's more accurate to say that Aquaman was DC's Sub-Mariner.
I still watch y’all initial reaction to the first BP movie and it still has me crying laughing 😂❤️
“Ive never heard this song before” bruuuuh put ur man’s on bro, I’m blaming you for his incompetence”
Just sent something to your IG DM fam. Hope you appreciate it. 🖤
I suspect we'll find out Doom did something to start this war and we'll see him in the end credits. Both FF and Secret Wars are coming, this would be the time to introduce him.
Chills everytime I see that trailer...
Let’s have a White Party opening weekend. Wherever you go see BP2, wear white to celebrate Chadwick.
Got chills watching this trailer 🤯
Namor was created 1st
its making me sad
Such a beautiful trailer
I'm soooooo ready for this 💯
I cant wait to see namor iron heart and shuri in the panther suit
Hell yeah. Namor is here
Black Panther.. core memory
awesome trailer...and love your reactions......thanks guys
Day 1. I’m wearing all white.
Billion plus dollar film. A+ trailer.
For real bro, some gringos in the comments thinks Mexico is in South America WTF. 🤣
Namor is truly a bad ass,, he beats the Hulks ass….
Namur…
Best trailer ever
Although the King of Wakanda died, everything is going to be alright. Wakanda Forever!
Fuck this grave robbing Public lynching where you all get to take a piece of the body and trauma home with you this is disgusting
I don't think I've ever rewatched a trailer so much. That shit is masterful.
Let's GO! 👏
IF only black people could act civil in the movie theater during this movie, it would be a fun watch. Sadly, and this is true so don't say it aint. But they're loud, they scream throughout the movie, act a fool.  Least thats what I witnessed in the 3 times I tried to see the first one.  It was mainly the females that acted stupid throughout the movie. "OMG Chad you so fine, OMG" Had to wait till it was on video to actually get a good viewing of the film.  I'm sure this one will be the same.
You guys know that the last shot of panther was a woman right?
Will flop
I just wonder if namor and the alantians is gonna team up with the wakondan army for a bigger villain because it seems like a bigger villain is coming in this one
The lady singing is Tems... a Nigerian musician 🇳🇬
🗣🇯🇲 HOLD THE FUK UP!. 🗣🇯🇲  Yeah I know I love you so I've been here here for a fucking minute.. 🗣🇯🇲 But I had to hit pause when he said he didn't know this Bob Marley song.. 🗣🇯🇲Mi nuh now BOI!!!! 🗣🇯🇲 You still have a Jamaican fan in me, My fath is a little shaken though .. 🗣🇯🇲 But we standing together. 🗣🇯🇲 Wakanda forever!🔥🔥 🗣🇯🇲  Bless up, From Jamroq!!
Boss
Been watching both you guys for years. with LOVE FROM UK
seeing Namor, gives me mad chills.  my favorite Marvel Antihero.
When bro notices the Kendrick mix at 5:09, I felt that too. I still feel that now. This one got us all feeling things.
I Popped huge when Namor walks out of the water
The fact that the Latin community is so excited by this because of Namor means this might be the biggest mcu movie in history. Box office will be insane
@07:40 take a closer look at struggle soldier
Aquman
We on the trending list baby keep up the great reactions and videos
My man said he didn't know a Bob Marley song. Uhhhhh
Good job on trending y’all
Let's gooo
Definitely going to see this movie. Never forget his legacy. But this was a great tribute!
I was here for the first teaser trailer reaction  for BP 1 and here we are again
Are they going to visit T’Challa in the Ancestral Plane?
Rest In Peace Chadwick Boseman
Wait, isn't that killmongers gold BP costume?
Imma see this so many times no matter what black Panther means more to me and some people then the world realizes
The church of marvel does it again  Repent now you sinners
I've watched a few reactions so far and I feel like collectively we have all been emotionally touched by this teaser trailer. It's amazing to see how many people have felt the same goosebumps and shed the same tears. RIP Chadwick. 🖤
RIP chadwick boseman,  THE GOAT
yooo where is your costumeeee
IRON HEART
Bro start reacting to Indian movie trailers your subscribers will start increasing faster than you think
Tenoch Huerta a a famous Mexican actor will be playing Namor, his character will be king of Atlantis his costume will be the Aztec jaguar god, it's a huge tribute to the native  Mexican community, this will unite black and brown community! This will be huge!
🔥
Y'all idiots gonna make another European richer again  SMH
NUMBER 23 ON TRENDING🔥
Could Angela Bassett be the new black panther
Yalls Channel is Really Good Really Like Yalls Reaction Videos Cause yall teach me stuff about the trailers
I’m gonna cry like a bitch I’m sure
Like RDJ was Iron Man.....Chadwick was Black Panther!
Trending.
Anger hate destruction killing drugs ... and all you want to do is destroy the youth. when is the black community going to get tired of this hate/death cycle? why do black hate and want to destroy all other blacks? why?
You should watch the women king trailer
Black Panther was the movie that helped you discover who you are? Seriously?
Been watching you guys for a while, congrats on Trending you earned it
And once again Ryan's designs team is doing that thing with the incorporating different Multicultural aspects for each races from different periods Aztec and Mayan for Namor peoples as well as some brilliant updates for the wakanda
They both trying to be strong, but they are emotional. Great review.💞
Bring your Kleenex
Folks are going to come dressed in African attire to represent at the movies to see this film.
It has to make $3B utmost
The first black panther reaction trailer was actually what introduced me to you guys. Ever since then I was hooked. I'm happy i get to keep continuing this journey and supporting y'all on Youtube/Patreon 💯
Seems like doctors doom gonna show up maybe
🙅🏾‍♂️
I'm man enough to say that I think this is  F up they just going to replace every man in this movie, we finally get a black superhero man and they're gonna use his death to make a political statement just like they did with captain Marvel and I'm just a Girl Theme song and all of that it's getting too much
Great things in the trailer:  Ryan coogler in It, Angela bassett looks amazing, and shes speaking tho? Omg  Namor looks Sick,  Iron heart is in it too,  The whole trailer looks Dope!  This Production is gonna be insane! Boseman always gonna be Watching Them acting as Great as They should be
NAMOR!!!!! Ironheart!! Great first trailer.  RIP Chadwick
This movie is gonna hurt me so much that I'm gonna love it
Uhhh! AND WHEN I WAKE UP!!!!
Flip-flops - lol
Idk if I can handle this movie without him
All these years later and this is the best Marvel teaser/trailer yet.
Bob Marley “No Woman No Cry!” 🇯🇲
this movie is what we needed after the mess of phase 4.
I heard that Dr Doom is secretly the main villain that’s playing Wakanda and Atlantis against each other. No matter what though, I am so hyped for this movie! 😭❤️
Chadwick did the acting all stunt and fight scenes were 3 guys Gui Desilva-Greene, Daniel Graham, and Anis Cheurfa
Nah, Aquaman is the DC Namor.
I think nakia is gonna be the next black panther!!!!!!
What a trailer!! Rest in Power Chadwick. WAKANDA FOREVER!
I know we on Namor...but i think its Attuma thats causing problems
Am I the only one who saw the extra clip at the end
This movie looks like it's going to be 🔥. And very deep emotional. I hope they don't tune down Namor  strength he supposed to be on par with the Hulk an Sentury in a fight.
Nakia will be the new black panther, if you have been following her instagram you will see that she is thick thick now lol. Shuri is to small
Can't wait.  Thank you MCU for making this.
you dont recognize him. He is the guy with the feathered helmet. the one who is raising from the water (the one with the moustache) We get a Mesoamerican Namor
I didn’t notice the wings on the ankles of the baby..
Ayyyy this is at number 18 on trending
YALL 18 ON TRENDING
I remember how emotional you two where with Black Panther. I’m excited for this reaction.
"No woman No Cry" - Bob Marley and the Wailers (cover) for those who don't know.
Box Office at a Billion easily
i wont even be disappointed if Black Panther isn’t in the movie for the most part, this movie seems very emotional and powerful. Just seeing the entire nation of Wakanda and Tchallas family fighting, even when Chadwick isnt here with us today, we know hes there in spirit. 🙏
Chadwick we love you always. Tenoch I trust you.
The fact that the song choice hits so hard “we gonna be alright” that’s to everyone that loved Chadwick that we’ll make it through this and we know what this man meant to you we are gonna give him justice “everything will be alright” dude just thinking about the lyrics gets me tearing up
Holy shit. Day one indeed. Was that Shuri getting her an Iron Man moment pounding on that steel like that? And she got sum Guns on her now!!
Chadwick Boseman was more than just a Legend. He Will Always Be Our KING 💜👑🙏🏽😇
That means NAMOR THE SUB MARINER
I still hope they find a way to bring TChalla back and recast the character. Letting him die off like this still doesn’t sit right with me.
Yaw beat me, I went 5 or 6 x's to the theater & bought the DVD/download. Damn... 😔  sad about Chad 😔
I will say something dumb maybe but : I am a white guy but still, i cried during this trailer... Heartbreaking
The villain that is gonna be in this movie is Namor. He has fought Black Panther in the comics and now he will be in the movie screens
Soundtrack epic
The cover of Bob Marley's No woman cry is simply beautiful 😥 mixed with the kenricks battle cry 'we gone be alright.' This is going to be emotional at the cinema 🎥.
A trailer that makes u cry and get absolutely hyped in the same minute. This is going to be amazing
This trailer hit all the notes Idk how the movie will be but the trailer had this big fight epic Avengers feel and personally thats how it should be
Black adam trailer next
I feel like this sequel is overkill. The first Black Panther movie was overrated and a bit offensive. I'll wait till it hits firestick lol
I'm right there with yall...
Namor descending onto his throne is the best part of this trailer.
For longest time, we Latinos had a few roles in the MCU. Now we got a whole-ass KINGDOM. SO hyped.
Those ankle wings.... 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is definitely going to be one of the MCU films that trigger the most feels. I can't wait. Also, congrats for making it on the trending page!
Namor, Atlantis, Riri Williams, a clear war... they're adding a ton in.
This film will win an Oscar for best picture as a Sci-Fi fantasy movie next year.
Recast T'challa this trailer was upsetting and yall drinking the kool-aid This is the End of Black Panther
Dressed in all white must mean a funeral for the king 😭
My cousin did the moto stunts that you see in this trailer, she filmed for 3 months and i was so excited when that scene popped up.
this is perfect timing for Dr. Doom to come in and be set up. Think about it, Doom sends those soldiers to Wakanda in search for Vinranium, manipulates Namor into thinking Wakanda is bad and was the reason his home was attacked/destroyed and finally starts a war between Atlantis and Wakanda. Eventually after this movie, it’ll set up Secret Wats which has already been announced as well as Fantastic 4
Highkey might be the greatest movie they make
The best trailer they've ever released imo, it flows so well
This film gonna do numbers I feel I got to be ready to be on presale ticket for theaters
Who would've thought a trailer, of all things, can reduce me to tears. An upcoming magnum opus already in my eyes.
Shazam, black adam trailer??
It will suck... like everything else marvel/Disney put out the last 3 years!  Don't get your hopes up boys
first time I seen black panthers movie trailer was on your reaction video, (the way yall was Vibing to the run the jewels beat had us lit lol)I watched it with my dad and we rarely hang out or get along so I wanna thank yall for bringing us closer, much love and respect from phoenix az, and rip Chadwick Boseman
Ryan Coogler is a great director this film looks beautiful for an mcu movie
This was a great video for a phenomenal trailer. I haven't seen a movie in theaters since 2019, but I am going to try to see this in one.
I've seen this trailer 6 or 7 times. And for whatever reason, it hit different watching it with you guys.
So who's the new Black Panther?
Atlantis?
notice how there wasnt a single joke in this trailer. ik this is gonna be an emotional movie but still the mcu should make more trailers like this.
this trailer is definitely if of the trailers ever released
“…and when I wake up…”   That line combined with the black panther reveal, AFTER telling us everything will be ok for the entire trailer. Man come on.   They got the audience through his passing and rebirth of the legacy in 4 min.   Come on man.
“…they flip flops now but.” 😂
I got a theory, angela bassett says her entire family is gone, but shuri is still there. So my theory is that shuri gets badly injured and some one else has to take over as black panther. Or she just meant t’chaka and t’challa are both gone.
Come on y'all, lets do the work and break the box office once again!
No Woman No Cry morphed into We Gonna Be Alright. GENIUS. Ready for this one. Fiege, Coogler and the amazing cast. Ms Angela Bassett showing why she is the Queen. The Mexican/Aztec origin for the Atlanteans. More representation. Let's go. Rest in Peace to the King, Chadwick Boseman. Wakanda Forever!
Sou Brasil, muito fã de vocês 👊🏻💙
The concerns about Aquaman Major comparisons can be put to rest now. I think Coogler handled that perfectly. I agree....It looks better than I thought it would
I’m so so happy and the luckiest girl that this movie is coming out on my birthday o can’t wait to see this movie
I’d bet all the money in my bank account angela basset gonna become storm. She’s adamant about being queen and white hair poking out her hat. It would work amazing her weather powers vs Namor sea abilities.
In the comics why were the Wakandans at war with the Atlantians?
Dude, I've watched this trailer a hundred times and every damn time, when the music builds up, I get chills. The beauty of the cinematography and the emotions put this movie above all other marvels in my humble opinion. RIP King.
WE GON BE ALRIGHT!
i really hope they worked with a reliable and good vfx company for this movie and onwards
BP fl
yeah I already know I will be watching this movie more than once!
Lupita sitting by Wil smith….👍🤣🤣
Why did they have to put mexicans in it? WE Cant have nothing for ourselves
A trailers broked us imagine what the movie will do
The queen mother's delivery, geeez! Heavy....
What a spiritual journey of a film! And Angela Bassetts speech 😳!!! Whole thing looks so powerful for a superhero film.  R.I.P. Mr. Boseman, still miss you 🙏🏾
S/O to Ludwig for the score …. Coogler’s cinematography is CRAZY!!
Wakanda Forever 🥺❤️💫
This is the one reaction I was looking most forwar to seeing.  I remeber yall doing the first one and the hype had me ready.  With the emotional weight in this one didn't disappoint.  the "lost me entire family line" just has so many feelings.
This is Chadwick Boseman's Legacy. RIP King! 👑
I'm excited to see your reactions i remember watching your reactions on the first teaser and i'm there with you on the hyped, damn time flies. I wish they will make Killmonger the new panther i know its supposed to be shuri but it's more interesting to see killmonger gain the trust of wakanda and redeem himself.
Can you do reaction to trailer shazam new
This movie is gone be big for all the children of the sun, black & brown
Love your reactions by d way. Love from Nigeria
The speech hit me right in the feels 😭😔
The real song was by bob Marley, but this cover was sang by TEMS of Nigeria and Kendrick Lamar
This will definitely be a mark for the MCU RIP Chadwick Boseman. Wakanda forever!
Has a trailer ever won an Oscar. This one is deserving. I have watched it 15 times.  How my man in red don't know Bob Marley btw!!!
This movie gonna be the best mcu movie to come out for this phase it’s so beautiful the trailer
I feel like at least 3 ugly crys are guaranteed... 1 when they cover whatever happens to T'challah, 2 during Angela Bassetts speech and 3 the end where there'll probably be some kind of tribute... My tear ducts ain't ready 😭
I'm calling the villain right now! Dr.Doom
I can't wait for this movie...I saw the first one over 20 times... Also, I'm new to the channel, are these two brothers and if so, who's the big brother?! My guess is the one on the right.
That was easily one of Marvels best trailers for a film ever
What a time to be a comic book fan. Never would I expected to see characters like Shuri like the new panther, Riri as Iron Hart, let alone Namor, in the big screen.
I personally think they should have a tournament to crown the new king. Call it, The Wakanda Cup. This looks beautiful tho. RIP Chadwick 👑👑👑
I hope the sebastian stan aka white wolf 🐺 be in black panther
I keep rewatching this trailer because I just wanna hear that INCREDIBLE music that they used. I don’t know who edited it all together, but they did an AMAZING job.
Marvel plz don't fuck this up
I'm Jewish and white and I cried watching the trailer, Black Panther was the first mcu movie I saw
You know for sure the actors in this movie were TRUE in their emotions this time around, they were performing for HIM, with genuine sincerity
Doom gonna be in this movie. I'm calling it here first. Either a hint or actual appearance.
Song? For the trailer?
I just had 😭. We will be destroyed by this movie. And I’m going to see it more than once. Lord help us. F cancer.
This will be an honour for me to watch. And I will definitely go to watch it in November
I think in just the first 20 mins of the movie, we might see the funeral of T'chala where all the other wakandans were wearing white!
they are feeling nigga  tingling
Best marvel trailer since Avengers
THE VILLAN IS NAMOR 🔥🔥🔥
Man. I remember how hilarious your reactions to the first movie’s trailers were. The fake as fuck “Black Panther” helmet and the excitement. We’ll all miss him of course, but this movie is one of the many things in honor of his memory.
The first notification I've had for months. But come on, BP wasn't all that, the villain was the best part of it. This looks okay but feathered blue Atlantiains, really? Feathers in the ocean 🙄.
Namor flooding Wakanda just like he did in the 'Avengers vs. X-Men'-comic. Namor was literally in the trailer 10 times. This along with a Shuri and Ironheart team up. I can't wait!
I have seen the trailer like fucking 50-60 times bro❤️
That first BP trailer is when I started following you all!
🔥
It's gonna be so Sick Namor With The Atlantis in It, Iron heart as well seems like What an Epic teaser! RIP boseman You always gonna make part of this, you're the Epic beginning of This amazing journey
This movie has the potential to be a top 3 Marvel Movie
Aquaman was "The Distinguished Competition's" answer to Marvel's Namor. Namor came first. 😉
No one is ready for this, no one
This trailer hit hard man. And I'm a prideful dude and don't like showing my emotions but this trailer right here? It was beautiful and it hurt at the same time. Rip chadwick boseman 🖤💜 miss u brotha
I wonder if maybe there wont exactly be a villain. Because Namor at first is a villain. But I think this is going to show the story of a Namor that didn't become a jerk until the US Government imposes on his kingdom then he has to defend his people from us because we wild, you already know. It showed military getting aggressive with some Wakandan people. So I think this is going to establish Namor and show him standing up for his people and him fighting back against basically us.
Oh! Boys , boys you've got core points ...😔🌸🎶🚀✨
Everything is going to be alright.
Incase yall didnt notice that baby had winged feet. Then it cuts to an underwater king. Later it shows a dark skinned child with pointy ears leaving the water into a grown man with pointy ears. That's Namor. This is going to be truly wild. When you see the big headdress or the green shorts, that's Namor. We got a good amount of footage of him.
And my entire family is gone LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S DYING AGAIN
I still watch your guy's Black Panther trailer reaction. I loved your excitement.
Maybe people who read the comics from when Neymor was introduced, but I was wondering if Wakanda was cloaked for a long time, why exactly would Atlantians have a problem with Wakanda?   Is there some century old feud that is being revisited because he is awakened now?  Did Ross order those soldiers into Wakanda to steal the Vibranium? Now that William Hurt is gone, does this mean that Martin will be taking his place as the leader of the Thunderbolts with Val?   I really hope they don't do Leticia dirty as the new Black Panther. It was in the comics, so she deserves her chance to be an action star too.  I'm thinking that if the heart shaped herb was grown in the wild in a certain location, other than the ones that were being grown in the ritual room, then they can harvest some and then regrow it whenever they have to leave Wakanda.   And will the herb work for anyone, or is there some mutated dna the Wakandans have because of their soil having centuries of Vibranium of which they've plowed and grown food from?  And will Bucky make a cameo appearance to help them fight or just give his respects to the royal family in person?
Here I am in the UK - a white woman and Marvel fan (from comics to movies & beyond)  This looks like the potential masterpiece of the MCU - honouring a wonderful man and actor.  I am am also very excited to again see the refreshingly rounded portrayals of strong/independent women in their own right. And Namor with the South American/Mexican influence ! It will be emotionally epic. Great reaction yet again guys.
Namor
Isn't the guy on the left with red shirt of Jamaican heritage and he has never heard of one of Bob Marley's most famous songs? I am now revoking his Jam-rock card.🤣
This is the THE best reaction and analysis and honest thoughts about this trailer. It is possibly the most beautiful trailer I have seen in my life. Everything is on point with what we wanted for a black panther 2 and what we didn’t even know we needed. UGH! I can’t wait to cry in the at imax theatre !
The emotion in Angela Bassett's voice is mind blowing when she says what she has lost.  I can't wait to see this, but also don't want to see it as we won't get to see Chadwick Boseman again.  :(
Best movie of Phase 4. Calling it now. All bets are off. Thank you and rest, Chadwick. I like how Namor is connected to Aztec/Mayan ancestry. Also, stoked for first cameo of Riri Williams aka Ironheart.
lupita's nakia acting like a whole widow this movie.  because she practically is.  😪
what a fucking trailer
Just role with me for a second... what if, just if... Nakia married Tchalla before his demise and is now going to be the next BP.... stew on that..
Man said he was wearing the same sneakers for 12 years and they flip flops now lol Idk how you didn't burst out laughing man cause I lost it. But hearing the tone in Angela's voice sent chills throughout my body. I can't wait for this movie
I saw the first Black Panther in the theater six times, and theater tickets are expensive AF in Japan. 😆 I'm seeing this a bunch too.
Tbh I was worried with all the Letitia Wright scandal and her alleged behavior on set, plus all the reshoots and whatnot, but this? This right here brings me peace. The trailer looks so emotionally charged, it hits ya in all the feels. Seeing Chadwick still, in some way, being a part of it just makes me wanna cry. My God, I can't believe he is truly gone forever... forever as in we will no longer be able to enjoy future scenes of him giving us that Chadwick charm as T'Challa or that powerful acting as Black Panther.  He was truly one of a kind as an actor, a human, a legend in the making. In your memory, I will honor your legacy. Rest in paradise King Chadwick. 🐈‍⬛
LESGOOOOOOOOOO
F I R E
Love the way they used bob marley’s no woman no cry. Everything about this trailer was legendary.
Cowboy Bebop reference Yass haha
I hope Marvel studio doesnt make a Disney fairytale
I think the storyline is going to be when he was gone for 5yrs.  I can't see his character dying again.....i mean he was gone for 5yrs...just to return and then die again?????
I am assuming the Black panther in the trailer and the teaser poster is Shuri, the frame looks way feminine than T'challa.
HARDSHIT 🙏💯🔥
Namor was a Marvel character older than Capt America. First appeared in the comics in 1939, Cap in 1940. Yep, Aquaman was a DC ripoff of the Submariner.
The queen says "...my entire family is GONE!".  Does this mean Shuri dies in this movie? :^o
If this remix isn't on the soundtrack I'll be so mad
Who is the actual black panther in this film?
Namor actually came out before Aquaman in the comics.
This movie and the GOTG vol3 (from the leaked teaser) has the more dramatic cinematography in the MCU
Waited all day on this reaction love you guys
That intro 🔥🔥🔥
Angela Bassett is an absolute Goddess. That women has incredible acting chops.
This with be the 'Empire strikes back' of a trilogy.
Knowing how trailers work, if this Trailer was this great, than the second trailer is going to knock us out, just slay us.
like u said...this is going to be a spectacle.
Marvel needs to give this guys a special screening pass the day this thing comes out for the press
BOB MARLEY , come on lads " never heard it " WWWWWWWHAT, , I forgive you, because your great ❤❤❤
I love that it ends with Shuri in her Panther suit with K Dot saying “And when I wake up”  Almost like it’s her awakening as Black Panther.
Rest in Power Chadwick Boseman  Wakanda Forever War of Kingdoms  Wakanda vs Atlantis We Want The Smoke
Oh yeah
🔥 🔥🔥
Lord let my heart last because I gotta be a part of this  Wakanda Forever
If Ryan Coogler could pull this off, this might end up a top 5 or 10 marvel movie
I think this movie is a parrarel like how namor will ascend to power, but as the bastard son/ half human pretty much like killmonger as half wakadanian.
your intro music source please
Namor is coming!
One more woke movie
Gents go back and watch again and zoom in on what Shuri is carrying where  you see Marvel Studios... Have tissues on deck yo
IRON HEART!
Bro they showed Namor like 5 times including an up close shot of his face. Lol. They dfinitely took a few liberties with his appearance. If you are looking for accuracy you have come to the wrong place. Lol
Damn I guess I gotta cry to another Chadwick B movie
Fire !!
😪😪😪😪😪😪😪🎬😪
Damn... you never heard Bob Marley's 'No Woman, No Cry'!?? 😕
I'm gonna be crying this whole movie.
Someone needs to put together (if they haven't) a ranking of MCU trailers. Just the trailers without trying to think about how the movie ended up being.  I'm having a really hard time thinking of one better than this one off the top of my head.
I mean, the dude you're referencing has always been an antihero. So I feel like, after Wanda, this guy is bringing rage and doom. Watching Wakanda plant themselves in the way, spears driven into the ground, will be absolutely epic.
Shout out to Struggle Panther
I don't think they realized that was actually Namor in the trailer... Don't blame them... I missed it too my first viewing... Lol
lets fuckin goooooo
I don't know how but want to see only one frame of the Legend, of the King, the hero Chadwick Boseman. ❤Wakanda Forever❤
Thank you for dropping this we needed it
“Mcu phase 4 is wack” said someone who shouldn’t have this much power over me.
Am going to lose my mind in the movie theater. Real Black Men Cry Tears.💯 Warrior To The End!!!!
I’m gonna see this movie when it comes out, i can already tell it’s gonna be rough
Am throwing this out their for a left feilder but could that be Angela bassett in the black panther suit and are we about to see the queen of wakanda go to WAR.
I'm a fan and love your reactions but that one spike activated my OCD. We still here though lol.
No Woman No Cry) by the legendr Bob Marley
This was nice
Watching everything unfold in the trailer and hearing Kendrick in the background repeat "We gon' be al-right" just hits so powerfully
I can only say ...... Wherever you are Chadwick Boseman .... Wakanda forever  🙏😭🙏
At 4:00 the Wakandan pillars that are in frame translate “inpower T’challa our hero. An honor forever”.. beautiful details
You didn't have to be still cryptic... Namor is in the trailer
The first half of this trailer manages to get you in your feels, then the second half gets you excited
I'm here cus I ain't ever forgetting your struggle panther reactions.
R.I.p chad
got me tearing up
I love how genuine you two are, just awesome. Gonna end Phase 4 with power and respect.
The black panther trailer reaction is when I discovered the struggle nation.
The climb from Marley’s song to Kendrick’s really gets the goose bumps going.
man im already gonna be emotional because of chadwick but now because of how namor is played by a mexican actor FINALLY some representation on the big screen and how there incorporating aztec culture into atlantis ..and then the emotion of brown and black fighting a marvel bad guy together!
This is how reactions should be done... you watch it in silence the first time... respect the art... and you watch it a second time... to make sure you capture the art. It got me too. Angela Bassett is a powerhouse... pure excellence of her craft!
Thor 4 shoulda HAD this TONE!!
This is the most emotional trailer I have ever seen. Eyes got watery when I saw this and this is all for Chadwick! As a human being, a warrior, a king! Wakanda forever!!!!!!!!
Being both black and Mexican I am so pumped for this movie. Love seeing my people in the spotlight!
the songs in trailers usually make the tone/mood its so perfect.
I can't wait to see this movie!! I enjoy y'all reaction as always!!
The beginning soundtrack is a sample of Bob Marley's No Woman no cry, which transitions to Kendrick Lamar.
That's Namor in the trailer boys...
This trailer is beautiful!
Of course we know. You can actually see him in the trailer multiple times ffs.
Yibambe
Well said fellas, well said.
You Dudes were the first reaction video I ever saw way back at 2018 's Black Panther Movie's trailer and I HAD to seek out you guys on this one ! Glad 2 see you guy still living and giving good!  Best Marvel Trailer/Teaser!!!
am i the onky one who has no clue what just happened in this trailer ?
This was a perfect trailer to me. I'm surprised we saw as much as they showed, it wasn't too much, but as a teaser, like the FIRST we're seeing of it, I'm really happy but also shocked this was so much. RIP Chadwick, Legend.
The trailer feels like the "Avatar: The Way of Water". It's so damn good.
Love y'alls passion. I've watched that trailer like 7 or 8 times and still get choked up (especially when Angela Bassett starts talking about "entire family being gone"). Thanks for sharing...
The first video I watched on your channel was the teaser trailer for the first black panther. Nice to have come full circle.
The transition into Kendrick’s “Alright” in the trailer was crazy!! Love it and both your reactions
Found this channel when the first Black Panther trailer was out *and them bopping to the cool music in that trailer, now we here !* It's fitting for me to see Black Panther 2 trailer from these two again (LOVE THIS CHANNEL TO BITS!)
Such a beautiful, powerful yet emotional trailer
“I’ve had the same shoes for 12 years…they flip flops now but” got me weak 😭
Namor Atlantis iron heart man this looks so good
Marvel should just use this trailer and nothing else, don't release  another trailer, leave it be
When I was in college I saw your guys' reaction to the original Black panther man times have changed since then and seeing this beings lot of memories
They should have just dropped the black panther title , killing Black People super hero in a fiction story is crazy recast Tchalla
This Trailer makes me very emotional. I cant even help it.
i feel really emotional as well for my culture is now on the superheroes now  ,,,,, MEXICO!!!
.                 Woke-kanda                         Forever                        She hulk      Carnt wait for superKAREN LOL Ya goofy m8te from Australia.
Did y’all see riri Williams (iron heart)
You need to be easier on the guy in the red, you're constantly ticking on him makes you both look less cohesive...let him speak and respect
Shout out to Ludwig Göransson! 🙌 He's gonna kill the music in this movie too.. I love what he's done in The Mandalorian and Creed, but Black Panther hits different.
To this day I can’t bring myself to watch black panther, but this is a celebration so let’s go!!!!
We up against namor and attuma.
Honestly i dont mind if they only show this teaser, dont need any more trailers.
When Angela says her line I burst into tears
this movie gonna make a billion
Gonna be a lot of tears and a lot of cheers in the theaters
So glad Namor is confirmed by the trailer
For the record, Namor debuted in 1939 and Aquaman came out in 1941.
The Trailer is amazing and I was feeling so emotional at the same time, RIP Mr Chadwick Boseman 😭🙏👍🌟
I choked the f**k up everytime i watch it
The reaction we all care about.
The debut of Prince Namor, "The Sub-Mariner", Ri Ri Williams (IronHeart), and Shuri takes up the Black Panther mantle.
This actually broke me down to tears, no cap... I just miss him. May he rest in peace
I loved his grand entrance in Civil War when he kicked Winter Soldier's ass!
I watched this trailer about 100 times and get choked up every time
"Damn, that's a gangster way to give birth" Definitely a sentence no other human being has said.
I am truly concerned that I will be tears this whole movie. Tears of sorrow, tears of excitement, tears of brotherhood, tears of joy. But there will be tears.
So looking forward to the movie after seeing the trailer, as well as the full Wakanda Forever Prologue track coming out on the 25th
Angela Bassett’s need an Oscar like when she spoke I got chill 😭😭 this movie will be movie of the year.
Namor came first. Aqua man is the copy.
Chadwick and his legacy will never cease to exist and he will always be greatly missed. And the coolest thing is to have Namor now as from the Aztec culture is the most amazing in representation of the diversities and cultures that will be seen more realistically in the sequel, for his traditions to both Africa and pre-Hispanic culture. And that the battle between Atlantis and Wakanda will be the best and also Riri Williams as Iron Heart... I can only say, that it will be the most fun and great along with Shuri.👍👍
Bob marley
I was watching the Comic-con coverage of the announcements through IGN and man when they showed the official trailer I got goosebumps and felt heartbroken that we no longer get to see Chadwick Boseman. Hearing Angela Basset speak about the loss of her entire family brought back the pain of that day finding out he had passed. I know this movie will be just as great as the first film, definitely will have to go see this one in the theater.
🔥 can’t wait for the movie
I loved the reaction to the first Black Panther trailer  I love this reaction, boys.
Peace and black and black power brothers♥️🖤💚
Damn the shots and the trailer music are beautiful ✨🔥
MCU Closure in November. RIP T'Challa, King Chadwick Boseman. You truly are amongst our Elders now. This movie is gonna hit different. I'm glad it's only just over 3 months away
I think the villain will be mami watta, my African people know her😄😄
ABOUT TIME I waited to long for you guys to react 🤣
This looks epic, can’t wait to see Ironheart and if she makes her suit in this movie
This hits hard. ❤️
I was there on opening day of the first Black Panther, I will never forget it
The sneak peek shows Namor the Submariner in the footage so let’s see if he is more anti-hero or villain. I believe T’Challa should have been recast due to his character’s importance. Chadwick Bozeman expected this I wish more of his interviews were seen regarding this matter. Ryan Coogler will do what he can and I’m sure the legacy will be honored.
You can definitely feel the heavy emotion from this trailer. I definitely started to tear up. I’m ready for it! RIP Chadwick Bossman 🕊 WAKANDA FOREVER 🙅🏾‍♀️
Us lacking
Movie looks great, what pressure on the actor playing Namor, Namor is ground zero for EVERYTHING marvel, there first superhero, hopefully they do him justice
I genuinely feel that Chadwick Boseman is to Black Panther, what Christopher Reeve is ti Superman.   No one will ever truly be capable of being "the real thing", except for them.   Boseman is THE Black Panther.
there's a wakanda forever prologue album dropping tomorrow pls God [July 25th], it should have the Tems version of Marley's "No Woman No Cry". i am loving the mix of tracks. here for Ms. Bassett. here for Mr. Tenoch Huerta and here for the tears behind my black panther mask.
I just remember one thing from your reaction of the first trailer "MEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOWW"
The Memorial to Chadwick, Sub-Mariner....Marvel just dropped the Mic ☯️
I’m sooo ready ❤
We Gon Be Alright indeed WAKANDA FOREVER!!!!!
I waited all day for you guys review. Do y'all think buckey as white wolf show up? love you guys.
That underwater birth was Namor—the baby had wings on his ankles.  They show multiple shots of sub-mariner in this. I’m sure you’ll get a hundred messages saying that.
Rest In Power
This film gonna hits us harder than we can ever imagined, especially it tributes to Chadwick Boseman. Rest In Peace legend & Wakanda Forever.🖤
Man, I was looking forward to the cat mask for the reaction. Still a great one. I was looking forward to tgis!
Wakanda Forever and rest in peace to Chadwick Boseman aka t'challa
WOW this is so real in the emotions and its beautiful, I really can't speak just gorgeous.
Bruh, I've teared up every time I watched this teaser. Every. Time.
This is ending phase 4
My brother said, Do you know this song?... lol Great reaction guys, November cant get here fast enough.
Yo how is dude gonna say he never heard that song before? Damn.
its gonna be fucking sick omg, it  looks awesome already. Namor and The antlantis in It,  with possibly a battle against wakanda People,, iron heart showing as well. Epic teaser Yo!  boseman always gonna make part of this! He Will never be forgotten
Get chills everytime I watch this trailer as you said Chad wick will always be black panther the love in this trailer is beyond words because of the dual meanings yes 🙌 2nd movie but also in the memory of Chadwick a soul taken from us too soon ~🖤~
One highlight: The LEGENDARY Angela Basset. Wow... Intense, powerful and emotional performance!
Finally ayee
That “we gonna be alright” hit me a good bit given the circumstances💯 Feels like the writers are really trying to inspire hope
Chadwick will forever be missed. Period. That being said, the Dore Malage are heavily featured in this trailer and I love it. I hope Okoye becomes the new Black Panther you see at the end of the trailer.
Church of Marvel got another one🔥🔥🔥🔥💯💯💯💯
As soon as I saw the trailer come out I ran to you guys
I was getting worried. I haven’t seen y’all in a minute or any Vidz
Day one.
i was gonna lock you up for your reaction. im no dummy, i can see and feel what BP means to many. im adjacent to that, still makes me cry cause its a good story arc and my mom raised me right, to feel what others feel. empathy. im going to struggle watching you react... here goes... yeah. the representation of wakanda is amazing. priceless. but, they also get in representation of aztec/maya/indigenous americas with namor. so double whammy. you got 6 k views and 5 k likes. who does that?
Never heard that song!? Ever heard of Bob Marley!?
What’s the name of the song
Yalls relationship makes me wish I had a brother😔
Looks SHITTTTT, literally nothing of value here
Blxck Excellence at its finest. I've seen this trailer a gang of times,  I cry EVERY single time!
Did he just say he never heard this song? 🤨🤔😒
Namor came before Aquaman
bringing a box of Kleenex into the theater for sure
I see this trailer in disbelief. As excited as I am for this Im holding my breath. When Chadwick passed, I wasn't okay for a week. The Black Panther is one of those heroes I was so excited to see brought to life and Chadwick did it beautifully. And every time I see this trailer, and I see that mural of his face, I keep getting emotional.   Whatever happens. Whoever takes the mantle of the Black Panther. They have my support and respect, so long as they honor Chadwick and everything, he has given us. Everything he was. Wakanda Forever ❤
Are you going to do a video about all of the other announcements?
It may be the best MCU trailer of all time. And there have been some bangers
ok ok im going admit something, i never liked iron heart. always thought her name should have been Iron maiden and thought she was a little lame. Her as a wakanden, trained by Shuri and we just skip her first 2 armors that dumb or boring and go straint into the black and pink one that absolutely styling on everyone else in the 616. Has got me so hyped!
I've used dawn to wash my clothes it really works 😁😊.  I love your guys reactions
The feels are going to be overwhelming watching this. The trailer is already cutting deep and the song was perfect. I need that remix.
5:01 a lot of people miss it but that was Iron Heart!!
recast asap
Reminds me of the Avatar Trailer
So I'll guess that powerful scene, with the acting queen Ms. Bassett take place after Infinity War when T'Challa and Shuri both Blip?
Def looks amazing. The visuals in the first one kept me captivated and this one looks to be just as good.  SN:  Yall looked mad familiar when I found your channel and just saw your PO Box is Philly. Born and raised 👋🏾👋🏾.
Seeing the Dora jumping off the side of that boat or whatever to engage the Atlanteans is amazing.
I just know this reaction bout to hit home
Wakanda forever Rest in peace Chadwick you'll always be our black panther
By the time we are going to see and hear Angela Bassett's monologue in the film, we will have no more tears left to cry.
That speech got me good!!! Can't wait to see this movie!!!!
And just think for a second how amazing this looks.  And it’s a freaking TEASER TRAILER
Angela Bassett's Acting Performance Will Be Sooooo Damn CAPTIVATING,MOTIVATING And A Very EMOTIONALLY FILLED! So Everyone Better Bring Their Tissues🧻. BecauseThis Is Going To Be An Absolute Great Movie🔥 "FAXXX!"💯!
Chills...caught shadows of y'alls first reaction to the original BP.  Great reaction as always, fellas! Can't wait for more reactions on this, then finally the review!
Bob Marley as the opening song Nice one, MARVEL
Man, Everything looks amazing. Even the meso-American influence of the Atlanteans is on point. And Tenoch Huerta already looks like he is going to kill it as Namor.
I have a feeling Ryan is gonna work his tail off to make something amazing for Chadwick.
*Day. One. We there.*
That song slaps so hard it even got my dog bobbing his head to the beat, I started to freak out thinking he was having some kind of seizure or something until I put 2 in 2 together
I know who that was to in the water manipulating Namor  Also on the street fighting okoye  Can't say his name cause of spoiling
This one is gonna do numbers again !! I’m going to bring the tissues 🤎🖤
The cinematography in the trailer is actually so good
This is the best trailer they’ve done in a WHILE. When No Woman No Cry came on I lost it
My man doesn't know "No Woman No Cry"? That's a shame.
Now See your mistake was you tried to watch this trailer without a box of tissues next to you. 🙂
Dawg I was crying last night watching the trailer, ha I already know imma be mess in the Movie theater.
I still remember watching your reaction to the OG Trailer!  First Video I ever saw of yours!  So happy to see how far youve come!!
New here. Just subscribed. Great job guys. I can't wait for this movie!
love the reaction .Song No Woman No Cry ,original BOB MARLEY !!!!
First three times watching we’re with tears….and then the song brought me through. AND NAMOR!!!!!!!!!
All I know is that I saw Wakanda flooded. WTF?!
Check out beast trailer with idris elba,  and the woman king trailer whenever y'all get a chance
Yalls reactions are the best
It is a beautiful trailer. I’m so torn. The whole recast TChalla has it’s point, but I can’t yet see anyone else in this role. I will be in the theater in November.
*Emotional as fuck.*
I love the way Namor's seen walking shirtless out of the water just like T'Challa walked shirtless into the water in the first Black Panther's teaser trailer. Like they're still connected, even if T'Challa isn't there.
Atlanteans flooding Wakanda and we are gonna see iron heart. Plus whoever is wearin the black panther suit
You're gonna carry that weight 💯💯💯 either Cowboy Bebop or Barrett from FF7  Remake
LETS FUCKING GOO!!!🔥❤️🔥
One of the few things to come out of my state to admire and be proud of. Wish you were still here, Chadwick. Fuck cancer, man. Takes far too much.
Tems rendition to bob marley  No woman No cry  My reggae spider sense was going haywire
Can't wait 🎥🍿👌🏾
My man seriously doesn’t know Bob Marley? 😅
I've seen this thing like 4 times already but watching you guys is like watching it brand new all over again.
Rest in power Chadwick 🖤 What a beautiful trailer 🤧
👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
We back baby 💪🏿💯
This is Ryan telling us "Everything is gonna be alright" He's got this, we're missing a HUGE HOLE but he's got us.  Perfect song choice.
WAKANDA FOREVER
This is gonna shutter box office records known and unknown 🙌🏾✊🏾
Excellent review!  As usual, ya'll are hilarious!  2:11 "Put the sh@# on right man!" "I'm trying. It's just my emotions everywhere." 🤣
Namor was foreshadowed in Endgame. It is time. Atlantis vs Wakanda, war of the hidden nations.
how soldier never heard no woman no cry lol
Mane………. I watch this trailer like 1000 times and every DAMNN time I got emotional. The music the Visual that speech Angela makes GOTTTTTTT DAMNNN! Okoye part when she was in the street getting push back but she hold her own was dope! Damnnn this trailer maneeeee. When this drops in movie theaters I’m b crying like a GOTTTT DAMNN BITCH straight up! 👏🏿👏🏿
Namor will be mad,furious and angry that he lost half of his people because of the snap,he will believe that Black Panther and Wakanda FAILED and then Hulk snapping his people back randomly when the survivors have moved on,yeah he gonna want a word Tribal Chief of Wakanda......so i think he has been gathering his forces during phase 4 and is picking his moment to attack.... Sidenote Chadwick knew he was going to die,so what if in secret he filmed a scene before he died to be included in this filmn where he passes the torch via a message to whoever will become Black Panther where he says "i choose you to be the protector of Wakanda,i choose you to keep my family and my people safe"...giving his blessing and passing on the mantle of Black Panther
The first time you see it you get dazzled by the colors. But the second time you watch you hear the love of a mom for her children. Then the tears flow when you remember that's how your mom feels about you.
YES Kendrick needs to do another soundtrack, he won a Grammy for King's Dead
Man im definitely gonna bring some tissues. This film is def gonna hit, and it really feels like a tribute to Chadwick, like a love letter, his legacy definitely lives on 🔥🖤.
The transition from the somber consoling "everything's gonna be alright" to the assuring, "we gon be alright" is masterful.
Also...much love for Chadwick, but in Civil War, any time Black Panther had the mask on, he was played by Gui DaSilva-Greene. He's the one rocking the cat fighting style and kicks and all that.
Namor.
This movie is gonna be better than the 1st one and I loved the first one
Movie introduces Namor and Atlantis. Looks like Wakanda and Atlantis will be at war.
Nahhh cinematography is on a different level with this one
I love y’all humanity. Thank y’all both. You got me through some bad times. Both of you guys   Thank you
Perfect song choice. Bob Marley wrote that song for his mother while he was dying of cancer. Perfect choice.
U guys must be the last reaction to this movie. U let us down today
November is going to take forever to come. Sheesh. I’m emotional
Namor was first ..looks dope
And WHEN I WAKE UP!
ANGELA IS A FUCKING TREASURE
Why don’t these two have their own sitcom yet??
Rubbing my hands like birdman like yeahhh y'all about get hit with feels like we all did
Killmonger has to come back and say that iconic line "Hey Aunty"
Gotta be one of my favorite cbm trailers ever. Up there with the Logan one that had “Hurt” playing over it
introducing  "Black Pantera"
This is one of best trailers I've ever seen. I've felt that phase 4 has been kinda mediocre, (Ms Marvel and Moon Knight weren't that great to me) but this has hyped me up a lot.
In Loving Memory Of Our King Chadwick Aaron Boseman (11/29/1976-8/28/2020)
WAKANDA FOREVER!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥💪💪💪
Amazing!
RiRi looks great. Casting has been flawless. I see our good sis Ruth Carter snapped again on costuming. Based on Angela's speech, I'd place it right after the Snap.  The funeral procession is gorgeous.  Chadwick's mural needs to be somewhere permanent.   Box of Kleenex,  check. And Namor came before Aquaman.
“We gon’ be alright” Ryan Coogler is saying he’s got this  Wakanda forever 🙅🏽‍♂️
i think teaser is enough we dont even need a real trailer
Struggle soldier don't know his Bob Marley!?!
Did you notice the music is done by the same guy who does the music for the Mandalorian
🔥🔥🔥😤😤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️🙅🏾‍♂️. This shit makes me proud to be BLACK! That’s powerful. Wakanda Forever!!!! 🙅🏾‍♂️
GIVE ME OKOYE AS THE NEXT BLACK PANTHER...plz
catmam and token have to admit that this second movie is pretty good.
This is gonna be HUGE
Let's go!! I have the tissues, already!
Chadwick should have Been able to retire from this role smh fuck cancer
Profound emotions from the trailer alone. I'm going to be an absolute mess in the movie theater.
Angela Basset line had to be said & felt.
"so we carry that weight."  FF7R Barrett reference i see what you did there niceeeee ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾
A little drop at 07:53 ¿Did you see? 😢
Once I saw the baby with wings on his ankles, I just smiled.  There's a lot of history in the comics that makes the character appearing in the film very sensible and it's already clear they're doing this film right.  Absolutely right.   November can't come too soon...
I'm stealing y'all boys quote Day 1 I'm There..............that shit gonna be 🔥🔥🔥
If Old Man Steve is still alive, I wouldn't be surprised if there is a small cameo of him at T'Challa's funeral.  Nothing major that would take away from the moment, just something small to add depth to their friendship.
My guys
I remember watching you guys starting up, sitting on yo couch messing with each other ...had to change my account and lost many of my followed channels. Happy to find you again!!!
We’re the jeepers creepers reborn reaction
brasil <3
It's definitely Namor!!! Atlantis vs Wakanda!!! Plus did you notice Riri Iron Heart?!!!!
No TChalla BP, Pass! Great looking trailer.
I'm considering watching Wakanda Forever just for the cinematography.
did he just say he's never heard that song?! STONE HIM IN THE STREETS RIGHT NOW.
This one is special.  And they did it right    Very right.   It’s one of the best MCU trailers and there are some great ones
it looks like they  basing  the atlanteans offa the aztecs...   and the actor who is playing namor i remember him from narcos : mexico  but some people might of seen him in that last purge movie ( forever purge).
ENOUGH SAID. This is the only trailer I need 💯
This will be the most emotional mcu movie of all time. RIP Chadwick Boseman, The Original Black Panther.
House of the dragon trailer
This movie is going to earn alot of money for sure for our king this is for you wakanda forever
Bro this movie must be good, it's a matter of respect
This film is going to be one giant tribute to Chadwick. It's hands down Marvel's most powerful trailer yet for any project.   In Coogler we trust.
Once again, Black Panther will be a cinematic masterpiece just like the first one. This will be one amazing and emotional ride.
Joe....Ya totally missing all the Namor Atlanteans water scenes and IronHeart.....
Most beautiful and artistic trailers I've seen from the MCU, high hopes for this one.
Buy multiple tickets AND Kleenex. Just watching different reactions got me leaking nonstop.
so we got riri williams( oh girl giving shuri dap in the tech lab) and  namor...   now  where are  these soldiers from ?? America ?? some other foreign country ??... maybe latveria   ??
dude...that sailor moon shirt omg.
this teaser is literally so amazing. better than amazing it's so powerful. had me crying man lmao
I'm just a Mexican-American guy. But my heart absolutely broke when Chadwick passed. Because I knew very well how much of an impact he had on "Black culture" and what he meant to my African-American brothers and sisters. So I will be with them come November celebrating Chadwick's triumph and legacy.  Rest in peace, Chadwick. We will carry on in your stead. Everything's gonna be alright.
This trailer did exactly what it needed to do: Assure the fans Chadwick will be remembered and honored as the story of Wakanda continues. I'll be taking plenty of Kleenex when I go see this.
Technically, Aquaman is the DC Namor.
KoP IMAX all the way!
This trailer got me emotional
if StruggleNation isn't routine viewing when Marvel trailers hit, I honestly question your life choices lol
This is where everyone is going to be emotionally because we lost a great man, leader and avenger
Great reaction boys
"I've had the same sneakers for 12 years...well, they flip flops now." 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I needed that laugh. I can't even say how many times I've watched this trailer. I cried heavy the first two times and it's getting easier with each watch. I just know to be prepared to bring my Kleenex in November. I hope my heart can take it.
Finally a serious marvel movie!!!!!!!!!!!
Probably the best MCU trailer. If the movie ends up being this good....my goodness...
I always wanted Angela Basset to play Storm back in the day.
As soon as I saw this trailer dropped. I've been looking forward to this reaction all day
The first movie gave us hope as a black community. Now, after watching this trailer, I feel that same hope!
This movie is gonna be emotional and lit at the same time.. this trailer had me so emotional it was so beautiful Omg
Yesssss. Black Panther has arrived!!!!!!!!!!!!

I think Namor will flood Wakanda. This is wild.
Marvel Studio with the white color shows that they are grieving too, like the people of wakanda Such a heart breaking trailer...
