norman isng betaing this devin Haney
Un welter peleando en ligero y no puede noquear a nadie y despues de esto robo la pelea contra Lomachenko y Ryan Garcia. Un boxeador aburrido y mediocre Haney.
Kambosos think he so tough dude your tier level c fighter haney whooped on yu 2x old loma whooped on yu an hitchens whooped on yu an yu talked so much crap to all of them yu lived off that one win yo entire career
I ain't gon lie haney ate on dis ho
best fight ive seen in a long time
These two have the ugliest and boring  styles!
Haney (just like Kambosas but not as bad) lacks that real power to knock out and hurt. It's a subtle thing/difference but it is what makes the best..... the top of the tree.
If Haney had power, he would be a superstar
Number one is there's no way you don't come up with the downstairs club little bar fight push block on an elementary Force of passage Because you decide winning weather we meet up or have sex or not   Number two you have to come up with the Chad Dawson Paul drive suplex That's all I really did to Bernard Hopkins I'm not saying you have to double leg the n**** I'm just saying in case he decides to get physical in case he gets hostile in other words why kambosas downstairs global pile drive suplex Devin Haney non negotiable forces of entry in boxing today once you get that down you can downstairs glove bar fight push block hold Andre Ward in one to place step block heart straight upstairs to the inside on the one condition you're already upstairs on the inside and are hung high enough around over top to box The only way to defeat an outside fighter that you don't have to step in order to step block hard straight up stairs to the inside   And this is on the one condition you're big enough and height that you don't have to duck in order to have hard left hook and that you're hung low enough that you don't I'm from underneath the box that you don't have to dark in order to dubstep hard left hook  And then you can James Tony only Vander holyfield Alex Lewis write a love heart love upstairs on the inside on the one condition you're already upstairs on the inside and are hungry enough that you don't have to step in order to step block hard straight up there to the inside  and then you can holyfield hook straight jab straight up stairs on the inside on George Foreman Now the gospel forces of entry in boxing today   Like Lenny's lowest do what I call push the envelope against that smaller outside fighter who was no more advantage for it  ginger boy and like that big dark hair boy who knocked him out remember if you see a ginger boy does something is just a reminder that it takes no size or strength at all to do this thing cuz gingers are not big and they're not strong   But the point I'm making by pushing the envelope I mean lyrics know what to do against the smaller outside fighter who was in every way disadvantaged And while letting slows in fact took him too disadvantaged or what some of you cause BKX where Mike Perry and Lorenzo Hunt married sister black heart straight up stairs to the inside on a size disadvantage person   But anyway enough about BKX back about it pretending to Linux Lewis and the big and small outside fighters size advantage enough inside Because remember thats the one condition is that your simply are upstairs on the inside already   Okay Lennox Lewis does what I call pushing the envelope envelope okay he knows He's still getting the smaller person out farther from the basket especially by hockey clinching him and walking backwards something you have to be hard really hung high to do because Atlantis Lewis is not only frontally advantage he's not really hung high or maybe 🤔 that's what it meant to be frontially advantage meant to be hung really high Because Chad's number North Hopkins their front to leave is but they're not how high like Darnell Boone and James Tony two people who stop stood and fought all their lives point proven   But anyways where do you get the smaller fighter to walk backwards whether you get the smaller fighter to trap himself out farther away from the defense of rebound And now negotiable premonition as the weather or not he stays on the floor okay it's only even affected it's only even advantages for the bigger outside fighter to step back inside with another two hook jabs jabs   Unless of course like Donovan Dennis Daniel dubois Chino hill demonte Robinson nagee West Ramsey vesey Floyd Mayweather Roy Jones Antonio tarver not at all South Porter or Campbell sauce or aerospace or Oscar joya Ganeddy galocavin and our hung high enough around over top the box that you don't have to duck in order to duck step hard left hook And hung low enough that you don't have to step in order to step black heart straight up stairs to the inside Play raymarks are on medics Lewis along with evander holyfield in their second fight which we can't say George forman and buster Douglas because he's not already upstairs on the inside 😔 but okay you are probably not going to force a passage of entry
Ryan Garcia ruined Haneys career.
Haney beat Loma too.
Took the hat off immediately at the end lmao
who’s hear after garcia sonned haney 😂
Im happy for Daney, but his dad needs to go somewhere. Get weird vibes from him. Especially after the ryann fight. Dude cares more about winning and press over his kid 😅smh
Haney looks bigger twice than kambosos 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Lopez-Kambosos rematch is a must!
Weight bully for sure.
They both suck
I think kambosos here is slow and weak, unlike his fight with lopez, he is full of energy
a domiate size advantage, Devon fighting all the smaller guys. I knew Ryan was gonna drop hi azz because hes never fought someone his own size. Look at the height, reach and frame Devon has over Cambosis, Loma he should be dropping these guys, Devon could put on 10 more lbs easy ....weak azz Devon got BEAT TF UP by RG LOL
kambosos would have won if haney weighed the same
George is not afraid of the size. George is GREEK! Good job Georgie!
Haney did not use these tactics with Ryan garcia .. idk what happen
here after ryan destroyed his career
Who's here after ryan garcia beating haney and dropping
Haney should have knocked this dude out. He has no power
Where was this Haney against Ryan?????
Way to go brother Haney! Respects from Indigenous Australians.
Undisputed means nothing unless you've beaten the best and Devin hasn't beaten Tank or Teo.
Devin haney beat George kambosos…He did what teofimo lopez could not do,if this doesn’t earn him the respect he deserves idk what will
Haney's weakness is that he doesnt know how to react to a pressure fighter and he always put himself in a more confortable position for him which is a distance fight where he can jab using his natural size advantage. Loma is not a pressure fighter but he throws combinations that Haney couldn't react, so if a pressure fighters like Tank or Pitbull faced him, I think Haney will have more problems dealing with them.
Devin allows fighters to land inside shots too much for me to have the confidence in Haney to defeat Tank. He better be careful with that backing up left hook Garcia likes to throw because it's power behind it
That big ahh slab of grease they slap on side of kambosos head 😂 I knew he lost after that
Can someone explain why they fought again back to back?
if Haney pushed just a bit more he could've KO'd Kambosos
Haney can't hurt a fly he's in trouble with prograis
Nobody in the comments mention the announcer saying United but Devin was undisputed and they need to put respect on his name
Looool the difference in comments before & after his fight v loma is so funny.. life is funny at times
5:40 Chinese Elon Musk just chilling between them
You never get the right decision in america😂😂😂
OVERATED ..... GOOD RUNNER THOUGH
Kambosos shouldn’t have never done a rematch
if he had ko power he would easily be best fighter so many of these combos should’ve dropped him.
This the same man that said he’d beat Bradley Martin 😂give me a break
Haney is boring as F to watch😂
Outstanding accuracy and evasion
No vi ese jab ni ese uno dos contra loma
How can commentary be so one sided.. @4:47 devin haney hits Kombozo in face 2x “woah nice body shot from Kambozo 🫨
David hanney,es un perdedor, para que inflar, un globo,loma ganó,7.a 5.ya van varias peleas que no dan el resultado como debe ser,que hacen no le dan vida al deporte,Sean serios.
Haney looked vs him but slow vs Loma interesting
Who said Haney never one. He Easley win. Get real
Devin will beat lomo
Had it been Gervonta Davis, George Kambo would have been out before the 7th round.
Devin and his daddy is both HO’s!
Definitely not Kambosos fighting style. He tried to be an aggressive fighter doing a LOMA like movement that only worked on the early rounds. Let see how Haney will perform against "THE MATRIX."
Kambosos not even putting up a high guard and let haney punch like dat 😅
Looks like Kom was drowning.. He got the chin, he ate so much Punch and still standing.. Big respect to Kombosos And Devin Haney really improved more and more..
Haney is not a boxer, a fighter,, just a clown like Gayweather, running like a chicken!
I woulda knocked that white dude out tryna put that hat on me
I dont appreciate the disrespect in constantly calling Dev unified when he’s really undisputed but they called that bum teo undisputed
Haney looked brilliant
Yo sabia k haney se lo ganaba muy rapido y buen boxeo el kamboso es buen boxeador.
This man don't has enougth skills to win against Lomachenko...
Haney sucks. He hold for 75% of the fight.  He can't punch for sht!
Why the corner of kambosos dont throw the towel ?
Lomachenko playing with Haney This fight is nothing
Tank is sleeping Haney. Haney isn’t as accurate as tank. And the shots he took from kam will be 100xs harder. He’s going to sleep bruh. Would definitely like to see him fight Shakur first tho.
Why do boxer keep they hand upppp haney ????? To protect the chin not under the chin tighten up
haney made this dude look so slow wth
I can see why some people are calling him pillow hands. Its incredibly rare to see that many hard looking shots lands and not get a knockdown.
This is ridiculous, like a giant 168 lb bobble head vs a midget, this dude call himself undisputed??? foh 😂
Haney is just overrated that's all, kambosos has no class, no good fundamentals, boxing skills is average, footwork not good and IQ low, haney found his rythm easy with Kam
Better fight than the first one. You can see Haney having a hard time on the early rounds but due to Kambosos moving a lot in the early rounds, he tire himself in the half and late rounds. Kambosos stamina failed him, moving a lot is a  hard task to do in the first place, not all boxers can do it all round
Hahahaha he moves good but how the heck is this guy beating Loma lol
Loma's sharp and unpredictable moves are gonna be a big problem for Haney
Loma win Haney
https://youtu.be/lhfxKDvTWck HANEY vs LOMA break down
Best boxer young too crazy
George was working his ass
Good lord, what a beating.
Devin too consistent
haney vs pitbull cruz lets make it happen
Tank will destroy Haney 😂
I thought this was a really exciting fight. Not everyone needs a KO just to win.🤷🏾‍♀️
Forgot about this
How can u be a muslim if u allow onlyfans to sponser you and have it written on your boxing shorts
Loma is on a different level from Kambosos
Let’s go pillow hands
ngl gervonta beats both easy
Haney doesn’t have a good chin , so really think tank will destroy him in a fight , don’t underestimate tanks speed either . He will catch up to him
Kambosos was fighting like rocky... Put you gloves up 👀
Skilled class act.  Doesn’t look for the knockout just takes it round by round to get the dub. Him and tank would be a good match only because tank is at his strongest when fighters get to confident looking for the knockout. Haney likes his jab ALLOT. Either way a fan of both. Time will tell🙏🏼
Tank will eat Haney alive he’s too slow for tank
Jesus loves you-!!
That bald dude at end😅
Wow. I'd rather be knocked out. That was a beating.
Tank would rock Haney to sleep in 5 rounds! Haney can't punch! No power. How would Haney deal with a killer like Tank in the ring?
Unanimous decision that's a bummer
Haney has no chin but a very accurate fighter
Haney is trash. Went to war with Kambosos. Looks like Kam threw this fight too to set up a Loma.
I'm sorry after watching this,  Tank is sleeping Haney, and pretty easily.
its like punch bag😂 haney huge bro
Fist of ☁️
Kam definitely would be way better if he practiced getting out the way moving to different sides if his opponent & was better with overall defense.
Can't wait for the Loma fight!
Don’t think Devin Haney even used a mouf guard 🤣
Haney has fast hands but no power. Wonder how that would do with Loma who has technique and great feet. Tank deff would have deff knocked out kamboose even maybe Ryan.
Tank is going killed pillow hands 😂😂😂
I think anyone would had trashed Kambosos...
Yep gervonta the tank Davis def got this guy
Kambossos was just whooped
Loma will win easily
100% he can beat tank with TKO
Haney is waaaay better than tank..
after watching shakur and tank last fights.. haney's performance here isnt that impressive. haney looks weak and lacks power!
Haney slow
I think Tank would drop Haney, he doesn’t have enough power to stop Tank. He will press forward and Tank will counter him and KO him.
He’s not fighting competition tho
I didn't see Haney throw one body punch. That is not good. All he does is head hunt. Otherwise, he has other good boxing qualities.
Tank Davis vs Devin Haney
Devin Haney has Only Fans on his shorts LMAO 3:47
Haney jab must hold some weight cause Kambosos ain’t a easy W
Tank would destrouy haney everytime he was touch by kambosos he wobbled imagine tank tank by ko r 8
garcia vs kambosos at 135 or 140
Tank sleeping this man
I wish Davis and Garcia fought like this
Haney vs tank  who wants to see this fight ?
Im ngl haney looked scary in there ngl.. hes so good
Let's have Tank vs Haney next in 2023 or 2024
Don’t none of em wanna fight shakur. He’s ELITE
I need Haney and tank after the loma fight. Haney lacks in power but has the IQ just like tank. Would love that fight.
Haney can't beat tank for sure
haney doesnt have power ..he just got the jab
Nice
Chef Devin Haney..."I don't use salt but, I sure do like to pepper!" Man, that jab and the one, two are dangerous.
For a jogger stand and bang boi
Tank gonna knock him clean out
Lomo gonna fuck Haney up
The wild thing is Haney been executing like this for awhile because he has no power y’all make it seem like he trash.
Honestly  haney is really overrated , he needs to fight tank or shakur to get exposed
Haney looked slow. Loma will eat next month
when the commentary it's made by tim bradley and andre' ward i am not interesting to watch anything with audio. i don't know how you guys don'trealize how biased are those comments.
How come all titles were on the line? Is it required to put all titles at stake whatever the boxer is holding?
he took that WBC hat off immediately lol
He really should have taken him out of there. Disappointing performance for Haney. When you have someone hurt take him out, or else you give him a chance of coming back and taking you out.
Ive seen haney figthing but for me this is the best fight of him a lot of potential.
They still doubting Haney
The problem with Kambossos is that he can't control distance nor timing. If he could, at least one of them, he would Become a much more dangerous fighter.
Dos boxeadores con mucho cardio sin pegada en ninguno momento en dos peleas uno riesho de nokao para ninguno de los dos k aburridos😮😮😮
Haney Speed 9 Agility 9 Stamina 9 Skill 9 Chin 7 Power 1.5
Haney is flat footed and pillow fisted
Respect to Kambosos , he gave it his best but Haney was on his A game. I would still love to watch Kambosos take on the other fighters with big names.
Nobody wanted to fight before he became champ and now they have no choice because they champ has a name and his name is Devinn Haney 👏🏾👌🏾
you gained a Fan Haney
Was hoping kambosos would come thru but Haney proved why he’s champ
Why did they say he was unified and not undisputed wtf
That hook tho 🥴
I see some things in Devs style that Loma could exploit. It will be a good fight tho.
Haney looked really dam good
congrats to my muslim brother haney
Excited to see in the future devin vs tank. I'm sure tank will come for you
Very competitive
Maybe a robot or human
Jinns helping them when you got Allah u win
Kambosos is just standing right in front Haney.  Almost no movement.  No change up or slipping.  If he would have moved in there to brawl, he may have had a better fight with Haney.
I see some flaws to Devin Haney's fight game. He fights like that against Tank, Tank will win hands down.
"Number of clinches initiated"   See this kind of stupidity is what killed HBO boxing. ESPN reenacting this same stupidity with these goofy commentators and cringe inducing p4p lists.  Devin shouldn't listen to these clowns and haters.  He got to beat Kambosos more brutally to prove a point, I get it. But he gave away most of his tools. These haters will never get satisfy on anything.  Eff sambo buck dancing Bradley, Kellerman and tessitore.
Haney is patient that's what makes him.
He can’t fuck with tank at all sloppy ass fight
Dude the Jab God
I think David is at the top of the division right now because he’s the most disciplined (besides Loma but that’s because Loma needed to help out his country. He’s very disciplined as well).
1.3M As in feb 14 2023
Good fight but honestly all that extra but he has no knock out power 💪  cus clearly the opponent is still active in responsive but nice  W
1:34 those dodges were SO SATISFYING
Haney ain’t got no power but he box good af !
OK, just to be clear Kambosos is very good. Haney, however, is next level.
Davis will knock Haney out
That “this is already a different fight” take, ages horrible
You should have knock him out.
الحمدلله
Lmao. Mr. Free TV (Haney)  #SOUTHPAWTV
ALHAMDULILLAH
Great fight Hanley dominated
If Devin and his dad think they can beat tank, they minus well keep " DREAMING"
Haney not fuckin wit tank
Kambosos a bum
Que putiza le dieron al australiano!
Dominant?
No way y’all think Haney beating Shakur fighting like this i’m sorry 😂😂 this nigga is overhyped
You mean the undisputed champion.
That's one bigass ring
First time seeing the highlights but did Haney really clinch 25 times by round 6?
Teofimo Lopez is extremely overrated. Lomachenko got caught up in Teo's power hype and lost the first part of their fight running scared.
Champ never got hurt. Made Kambosas look mediocre. A fight is won one round at a time. Challenger has to finish every round strong.
He is a great guy,no doubt,buh he can't stand Tank with this🤔🤔
147 reallyyyy
Look ill be honest he so thin at that wait bro, ofc he cant hit, i wanna see haney at 140
Every single Kambosos fight is fantastic. Haney showed everything, he is getting better year by year....
Loma would wash hani easily
watching him and watching Tank there's a different skill level for sure he doesn't have good balance always seems to load up for one shot  I think he gets KO'd vs  Tank
Im coming for you Haney, i put this on everything 😑 wait 💯
The thing about Kambosos' style is that if you fight toe to toe with him he'll probably win, he's a pressure type fighter, tailor made style for a skill oriented haney
Tank will beat the breaks off of hainey
hum ... davis will destroy him!!!
whenever a black fighter fights a white or Spanish fighter the announcers only get excited when the non black fighter does anything... and only talks about the white fighter and they are super silent if the black fighter wins.. boxing is crazy!  They deff dont want the black fighter to win ever lol sad
beating a limited fighter twice doesn't mean anything
devin haney reminds me of mayweather
Vasyl Lomachenko is always punching and offensively aggressive. Haney has his work cut out for him.
but with no knockout.
Tank easily beat both these dudes in one 10. round fight
I think If Dev had a body attack in this fight he would’ve stopped him
Devin did good, but he gotta get more endurance and stamina. I did think he could take too many of tanks punches if it went the distance.
Mann tank is different ,but i cant explain how
Haney looks good but the guy he is fighting is not that good.
Boring 🥱
Ryan can pop haney
Felicitaciones campeón
Made George look average again... !!!
Haney é muito foda mano!!!!
Kambosos has footwork stamina IQ and speed. Maybe its just the style that I think is the factor. I would love to see Loma vs Haney. And Pitbull vs Haney.
watch the tenth round in slow motion... Kambosos took a brutal beating, Haney is such a robot
I came to this fight when haney said tank was ducking him, I now realize it's the complete opposite 💀
What's funny is after watching this mediocre performance by Haney people out here still think he has a chance vs Tank , Shakur or Ryan Garcia 🤣🤣🤣. He can't allow himself to get tagged like George was doing to him here. These same punches from tank would put Haney on the canvas
George Malaka Kambosos
The fact onlyfans is a sponsor
Paid fight.
Undisputed not just unified. George Kambosos:corner should have stopped this fight.
Whole weight class is ridiculous. Boxing is a joke and has been for decades now
Haney better never trade punches like this again, against a big puncher he’s getting dropped fighting like this, got hit way too much luckily Kambosos ain’t got no power
Devin Haney is the best as far as boxing I just don't know if he can take a real punch from tank, Frank, shekur, or Ortiz but it might end the same way I just wish everyone wasn't worried about being undefeated we know who the best are and your obviously one of those
Kambosos can now say he sparred the Dream Devin Haney twice, instead of Pac-Man.
Shit weak asf not even a knockdown in either fights
Very beautiful over Muslim brother power of God is with Muslim Islam is a powerful Religion God help of your May you Live long From Pakistan powerful Muslim country
I didn't even know no power noodle arms; Devin fought this wack rematch until tonight. You will NEVER have the star power as Tank.
toucha gloves
This was a great fight because Kambosos didn't make it easy.
Haney was so drained, and he's gonna do it again with Loma one last time. I hope he does move to become undisputed at 140.
I'm new to you but that commentator was bias to George to no avail
No need to argue, George is small compare to Davin, however they’re both great fighters!
Haney looks like Mayweather Jr but worse
DEVIN  REALLY NEED TO L STEP ESCPECIALLY WHEN HE THROW THAT RIGHT HOOK
if devin just spammed L step and framing he would beat anybody
This Nigga is garbage 😂😂I try to like him I really do but I can’t he think he Floyd but he nothing like em defense ain’t even fluid enough he got a good jab tho . Nice lil one two
Haney the only one calling out and fighting all these dudes right now
Good not all the racism just get in the ring and take your beating like a man😀🤣🥲
Nah if haney ever get some “POWER” it might get scary 🤯
Haney is good, but not ready for tank
When Kambosos beat Teo he said “I’m the emperor” “Because I go to everyone’s country and take them out” I guess Haney’s the emperor now. 🐐
Haney is skilled, wise, calm and patient. Very good traits to have. And hard to beat.
HANEY TIME 🥳🔥🥳🔥💯
Kambosos threw less punches in this fight compared to vs Lopez smh
Haney and Tank will be a great Fight worth Millions
He becomes really strong. Such improvement.  How great it was His angles are great His faints all good.  His balance throwing those punches.  This prime fighter  With style,power and foot work  And still very young age 135
He moves like prime Mayweather
It's very hard to see 2 of you're favourite lightweights punch each other in the face
I didn't even see the first fight n the second one is over wow must of been a good one then wow .
Masterclass .. Damn!
Haney has the hands and feet. But his upper body doesn’t move enough. As he grows and learns from Mayweather he will be a beast. Edit: just watched some of his other fights. His upper body was moving smoothly. This kid is a beast.
Devin with his big nose
Great fight Devin need to work on power punches too close the fight out but he a good fighter fr
Devin Haney is endorsed by onlyfans??
Alhamdullilah!!! Congrats to my champ akh
congrats champ. Incredible performance  ..all the sh!t talkers ..Stand The Fck down
India done gave this man super powers
Easy work for shakur Stevenson
Haney can't fight to save his life. Smh. A cherry picking bum with horrible pinch technique, sloppy footwork, no active guard, feints, nothing! He's going to sleep when he fights a top fighter.
Haney beat the old Kambosos and dealt with the new one too. A true champ. Hats off to him. The dream 🎉🎉🎉
Haney vs García next😡🔥🔥
Damn yo she bhad 🫡we taking over every sport every business every aspect of life ✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾✊🏾we matter lemme get sum followers check my music n streams out
Haney is the best runner in boxing!! This kid is a fricken joke.. boxing is going downhill. The sports a joke now
Boring as hell, he ain't it, no it factor.
Amazing Fight 🇺🇸
Kambosos should’ve never got a rematch after Haney manhandled him in the first fight. That’s like Tank fighting Rollie again…. For what. Fight someone else like Tank and stop talking ish. I remember when the best fighters fought each other and today it’s about rack up the money before you take a risk. BS
Bruh Haney the most awkward technical af fighter how do u even deal w that. Shots comin from who tf knows where twitchy af duckin weaving countering. Straight nightmare
Dev dad just awesome man. Never been a fan of the dad son duos because they always toxic and detrimental to the fighter but w dev it's the opposite. Blessed to have each other fr
Can't wait to see Hanney vs Lomo
George beautifully blocked almost every single punch with his face.
Haney is no pound for pound type fighter, the first man he runs into with power and a good chin is going to stop him, his simply does not have the type of power to survive a true firefight.
Loma is not easy to hit like Kambosos. The only way Haney could win the fight against THE MATRIX is to run as fast as he could around the ring while jabbing, using his reach and size advantage. But still, Loma for the knockout for sure.
The announcer got it wrong, he is Undisputed not just unified. Many have unified, only the few become Undisputed.
This outcome was obvious. A much buttered version of KAMBOSOS
👏👏👏 Respect to Haney for making the fights the fans want to see. Lomachenko next will be a hell of alot trickier. Looking forward to seeing that match up.
what was kambosos doing tryng to change stances and always got hit while doing so! bruh! and the there was Shakur and tank and garcia lolol
Haney post fight interview
Devin no power Haney
Haney is definitely going to eat body shots from loma... 🦆🦆
The fight nobody wanted
No one beats haney at 135💯
Kam has t rex arms
Loma is going to maul Haney. Haney is fundamental boxer with decent speed and predictable traditional combinations, Taylor made for Loma's style. He catches and shoots, telegraphs and doubles up on the ones and throws a predictable two and three left hook. Haney has low power and would be a perfect target for Loma's body attack and straight lefts in the pocket. Loma's gonna fuck him up bad. Haney better stay away from Tank Davis and Teofimo too, too much power for him to handle. The Argentinian almost knocked Haney out with a right cross from an awkward low power stance, imagine what a left from Loma, Haney, or Davis would do to Haney. He's good, but unfortunately has little power and is too predictable.
Is that two different weights?
Haney is gonna rock Loma. Way too big for him
Unified? Dont be disrespectful
Man Devin Haney is a biggg lightweight
🤣Haney will be the second Mayweather (RUN😛) 🤣
Tank would ko both
f he had fought like he fought against george and teofimo, he would have won the match comfortably!….
Devin is a tremendous fighter but I have to be honest. I don’t see him beating a in shape & sharp tank Davis . Gonna be way harder to hit tank & tank packs double the power kam had in this fight.
devin is 🗑️
Shame you lost but you gave your best on the night kambosos we love you mate keep your head up bro
Haney is a fantastic boxer but man his power is not there this fight should've ended in the 10 for sure
Jermaaine ortiz will get beat up by heaney
did his shorts say #onlyfans ? what has this world come to smh even in boxing
Devin Haney Beats everybody at 135-140 not even close dude is too slick as a boxer and can brawl with the punchers
Gervonte davis can beat him
When theirs blood in water gotta go for the kill. Great fight
Daven THE RUNINGMAN haney
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Mayweather style running man..haney
Like the first fight Haney fought ko like a Taller Version of RUNNYWEATHER!  Fast, graceful but weak hands.
Kambosous’ brain will be scrambled eggs by the end of his career if he continues to fight like this
George got hella heart made a fan out of me but I mess with d Haney
This guy ducking people now come on.
Let me guess Kambosos, it was deception The Art of War 🤔 Lol.
Devin is like Mayweather but he needs more movement...
Esau George Kambosos got beatings
Shakur Stevenson gonna mop cuz😂
A fight
Haney Beat Kam too easy
Devin got the dog in him that man is to good
Great
This version of Haney would get eaten by Davis real quick
Man Haney definitely looked sharp kambosis face was gushing , Haney got hit multiple times by kambosis and it didn’t hurt him 💯
At 23 look at what he's accomplished and he's just getting better it might be 3 years before he enters his prime and he's already undisputed it would not surprise me to see more KOs as he goes up in weight. Even if he doesn't put guys out cold he's so good he could just start stepping up his volume and batter guys into submission
good fight haney did win but george exposed haneys weaknesses. if haney fights someone with a more power than kambosos and gets hit with the same shots it would be a different outcome
This was like a kid getting disciplined by his dad lol 😂 bro had no chance
This is why Teo don't want no parts of Devin Haney
Massive respect to both fighters.  I just felt Haney clearly won the first fight didn't need another went as expected but massive respect.
Haney coulda stayed on the outside and jabbed again all night but he forced action this time 👌🏽.  He need his P4P respect ‼️
And still, lets go boy💯
An to the fact that the world thinks Haney is a boring fighter 😂 naaa he a smart fighter 💯
Haney beat the brakes off that boy!
Haney took more risks but he knew he could win, probably should rematch more fights.
True Champion, Hands Down. Definitely will like to see Haney v. Davis. Or Haney V. Stevenson before Haney move up in weight!!
Kambosos has no footwork and head movements at all that's why he loss. He is always hit by those jabs and 1,2 combinations of Haney.
Devin looks good
Ryan and tank are trash.  This kid is a beast and they will avoid him at all cost.
Kambosos displayed poor timing when switching stances and Haney exposed that
Devin FREE SMOKE HANEY  💯 nobody wants the work him and Shakur up next
Best fight I seen him preform
Now stop playing and fight a real fighter that what we want to see
Menuda batalla
Dos tíos muy profesionales
Que pelea más guapa
Rushen- taulo ＨＡＨＡ
This was a snooze fest 😂
Man where was the promotion for this fight 😆
Kambosos has no defense
What fight are these announcers looking at? He beat Kambosos into a bloody pulp
Tim Bradley is the biggest fraud in boxing next to Rolly Romero
Lol I didn't even know this fight happened.....to guys that can't punch out of a wet paper bag. 🥱
To constantly switch stances with a fighter that's good with both hands is not a good idea....
Haney sucks his resume sucks bad !!!!!!!!!!!  I mean I can whoop kambosas
Deserved it.  Twice!! on the road.  Undisputed!!!
Loma would destroy Devin
Even the highlights boring !!
If he had any power whatsoever any power this fight would have been over in the 3rd…Haney is straight up pillow hands and a boring fighter! He will never never get a knockout the rest of his career
they were really promoting onlyfans lmao.
easy 😮‍💨⚡️🥷🏾
Don't be fooled when Greeks 🇬🇷 are bleading haha I've cut myself plenty times skating n just carried on haha
No rematch great heart!
Kambosos its like a pig
Dominated dude
Pitbull vs Kambosos
True Warriors
Same result.... Haney vs Garcia or Davis will be a good fight
The best
Devin pillow hands Haney still can’t beat tank davis
Congrats to Devin Haney, but what was George Kambosos expecting? He got beat the first time clean, was he injure?  is that why he wanted the rematch right away? if anything he should of waited on the rematch to try to get better first.
I dont know if it is just me or does Haney lack a bit of a body assault? He would have gotten Kambo out during 10 had he worked the body some in the fight.
There’s only two ppl at 135 that I can see beating Haney. 1. Vasyl Lomachenko as long as he doesn’t start to damn late. And 2. Ryan Garcia if he was to drop back down to 135 but he’s said he doesn’t want to ever again bc it’s hard on his body but even if he does he definitely has the speed factor against Haney but to truly beat Haney he has to bring a lot of volume and power with that speed Ryan throws a lot of shots but he’s gotta make them count and land
When are we gonna get tank vs devin?
Total asssssssss whooopppiinnnggg mate
Dat fukn pard undisputed again
I had no idea they were fighting again
The commentary!! Says nothing when Kambosa gets 10 shots to the head but when he gets in one punch they lose their cool! "Nice punch from Kambosa " 🤣🤣
Haney is the 🐐
Devin the Dodger Haney
Kambosis is like an actual c fighter and wanna be Floyd had a hard time 🤪
Haney is a copy and paste of May jr 😅
when was this
Kambosos has no defense,  needs to keeps his hands up
a very boring fight 🥱🙄
This just shows how much of a fluke Lopez vs kambosos was...
Powder puff punches from Haney
I think if Ryan and Devin meet it's a very good chance Devin will lose by ko. I believe Ryan would have put kambo down. I'm black too before y'all start talking crazy racist stuff
Congratulations to Devin Haney on his second win over George Kambosos ! Devin Haney is a True champion and he has a very bright future ahead of him . He's very different from the other accomplished fighters in the division because he's willing to fight anyone and is not at all intimidated by them.         As one of Devin's boxing fans , I really appreciate him a lot because he is eager to fight the best boxers in his division . I'm talking about Gervonta 'Tank' Davis, Vasily Lomachenko, and all the others! Unfortunately though,  it sounds like Devin may not be around long enough to fight them all because he will have trouble making the weight. Anyway, he has been willing to fight them all up to this point.       Way to go Devin ! You're a TRUE CHAMP !!!!     JimT.
DEVIN HANEY ** MY MAN ** PROVED THAT THE FIRST WIN OF KAMBOSOS WAS NOT A FLUKE, KAMBOSOUS CAME OVERLY PREPARED AND BEAT  TEOFIMO LOPEZ FAIR AND SQUARED, WE HAVE TO GIVE TO DEVIN A  TREMENDOUS CONGRATULATION FOR GOING TO THE LAND UNDER AND SHOWING THE GREATNESS OF HIS SKILLS AND HOW GREAT OF A   PROFESSIONAL HE IS FOR  HAVING BROUGHT  THOSE BELTS THAT BELONG IN AMERICAN SOIL, HE HAS PROOF ONCE AGAIN THAT HE IS A TRUE CHAMPION AND,  WE WISH HIM THE VERY BEST IN HIS FUTURE ENDEAVORS
Haney took over later in the fight.  Good fight and good win.
Nobody's out classing haney right now in his division 😤
I called it for George to have won he would of needed to fight and be Roberto Duran… he couldn’t
Can't wait to see Lomachenko vs Haney.
Davis or Lomachenko next?
I feel sorry for kambos ex-coach dude ain't ever getting paid.
Shakur Stevenson is the best right now hands down
El hamdulliah
And still, the unified champion of the world
Haney should go for a legacy fight with Lomachenko... Skills vs Skills
He just can't beat Devin Haney 🤷‍♂️
😴
Haney can’t do nothing with tank sorry but not sorry
Please put some respect on the best fighter at 135 Haney is everything you want in a boxer the prettiest 1,2 punches I’ve ever seen nobody can beat him i promise 💯
That boy beat the fuck outta george
Why the hell did he have to go to Australia, twice ?
It's time for Haney to fight a more talented guy. I can definitely see Stevenson dominating the lightweight division.
Thanks for sharing.
Definitely Undisputed! I don’t know what the announcer was talking about. 😒
Que pelea para más aburrida
I'm a fan of the Queensberrie rules ,Haney  for my observation lacks a bit on the power aspect of he's skills, but that can be fixed by choosing the right opponents,  he has that privilege becse he's undisputed Champ.Good luck Haney. I just love to be a fan of this Era fighters. Haney vs Shakur Stevenson that will be  barn burner.Or Lil giant Davis wao!!!!⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡🌟
Teofimo will win to fight with devin
Wheres loma
When did this fight happen
Thank you Top Rank, about time you stepped up your highlights game
Tank gone kill Devin
This fight never should of happened George didn’t earn a rematch.
Every time Kambosas does anything, the commentary “Oh good fight/left by Kambosas”
Much respect to Dev. He did what he had to do. Now he should take his time and cherish those belts bc they have a timer on them and the countdown starts as soon as he agrees to fight Tank.
this mans sponsored by only fans what the fuck world are we living in.
What next for haney???
Kambosos did better this fight. I dont know much about skill. But i havent seen the humble man lose. Ever
Devin was basically trying to make Mayweather movements.
He made me a believer after the last fight, this left me super-impressed. He really broke him down, outclassed him here.
LATINOS UNIDOS LATINOS THE STRONGEST: Excellent by Devin Haney his Defensive Arsenal blocking counter striking and tactical repetitive combination off the jabs especially with timing movements with angles and accurate precision execution was Superior. George Kambossos showed heart and determination but was clearly out punched out maneuvered and out boxed by Devin Haney.
1 more round and Haney will KO/TKO Kambosos
"Devin the HOLD Haney"
If Tank landed the shots Kambosass did land they would actually hurt Haney and TANK would land much harder than Kambosass 💯💯💯
Haney fights usually put me to sleep but this one got my attention
Anyone who thought Kambosos would win this or the first fight have to be Australian
He do that shit against tank he going to sleep
I want to see loma vs haney
the blatantly biased commentary by total shills for Haney is laughable. (no skin tin the game for either guy here btw)
He should fight Canelo. Undisputed vs undisputed
Shakur will beat Haney
Haney fought beautifully at a distance and using his reach to his advantage. Kambosos needs more head movement when trying to get inside so he doesn’t get hit. Both fights he was too predictable. But that’s also credit to how well Haney executed his game plan.
What kind of fight was that ! Kambosos obiously through the fight wow !!! I have seen some sell out fights but this is one of the worse ones . How much did you pay him Haney?!?!?
boring.
Nahhhh Haney look like he can take tank out
Tank is better
Kam caught Haney with that same over hand right he caught teo with and the dream ate it while teofemale  hit the canvas
Kambosso left jaw was unprotected all tru d night
its incredible that jo jo diaz gave haney his toughest fught so far.
Boring fight 😴
Just accept it.. Haney is actually good
Looks like Haney simply neutralized every possible weapon Kambosos had available...and then just took it across the finish line.
THEY NEED TO GET RID OF WARD HES FOR ALL THE BLACK FIGHTERS,,,,
Devin not having power it's a tragedy for boxing.
Great work by Devin. He’s the future of boxing along side of shakur
Haney is like that!!! Fuck all the HATE?? He is my favorite!!!
MANNY PACQUIAO vs DAVIN 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
Now Haney judging from this fight, Lomachecko has a high chance of beating Haney
Kambosos had no answer to that overhand right over and over trhoughout the fight. Its time for Haney to move on with Loma for his next defense. There will be no excuses.
Mr.Pillow hands win the W 💪🏽
Australia is notorious for getting big fights and losing embarrassing shameful
I think they gave the belts to kambosas so more people fell in love for the sport and make more people watch the sport ... :) i know he deserv the win with teofimo lopez but after that fight he just look a avrage boxer , maybe the faim and all of that was to much for him
Παμε δυνατα...
Australia your hero is getting a beat down.  My goodness......🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Okay champ !!! keep your head up!!!
Thank you davin for saying Alhamdulillah
Has kambosos ever heard of the concept "keep your hands up"?  Jesus christ he had his left down the whole fight and just ate right hand after right hand from Haney.  Kambosos must have some shitty trainers if they let him fight like that with his hands down while Haney just tees off on him over and over again.
Don’t let pitbull cruz in the pic👹
Cambusos too short  and was too confident about he can take punches from Haney that later wear him down.
My vision is ass can someone confirm for me, was Devin Haney timing when Kambosos switches stances to go on the offensive?
Kambosos is blocking all the punches using his head. 🤣🤣🤣
Devin "Clinching Ass" Hayne
Devin vs Ryan please!!!
More biased commentary ever
I shit u not I was singing "u can hate me now" ALL WEEK before this fight 🤣
This fight better than last boring one. Haney won clear.
Haney needed more combos fr
Haney could have finished him in the 10th he didn't turn up the gas on him but aye I can't be mad at him tbh he was in someone elses homeland no point of risking a KO
Kambosos pucnh always come from behind so the acceleration of speed is getting low
This was a boring fight kambosos fought better in the first fight oh well at least the belts are staying in the US where they belong
Love it when Aussie bogans get beaten in front of their feral fans.
Now this fight for me it proves that Ryan Garcia has no chance of winning the Haney!!
Highlights were trash
Pointless rematch...Haney had already shown he was a class above Kambosos. The latter decided he wanted one more big (maybe his last) paycheck.
Haney needs to prove himself against bigger names to be considered in any conversation.
As well as Haney did, I don't like the media pushing this "undisputed" narrative on him...he needs to fight either Loma or Lopez then we'll see.
I think kambosos fighting style getting changed the overhand when he fight lopez is gone 🤔🤔🤔 did they change it because it easy to dodge
Fight’s a lot more entertaining to say the least, but everyone knew who was gonna win, it’s just that he had to do the work again. Haney’s the real deal of 135 👊
Kambozo got masterclassed
Mf it’s UN-DIS-PU-TED. All the belts are his. Announcer played Dev.
That's my fuckin dawg let's go Devin good W great aggressiveness an transition amazing poise masterclass jab
Pitbull put both of theses 🤡 🤡’s on there back pockets while there old lady giving pitbull 🧠
Did he say unified? I think he meant undisputed #TheDream
Haney going to get knocked out. Watch. Good fight. Good win.
Guarantee he will not take the Loma fight
With that style he think he Gon be tank you crazy this dude only one thing jab hook jab hook tank Gon knock him clean out
I hope Devin Haney is more legendary than Mike Tyson or Manny Pacquiao  💪💪💪
Kamboso's win over Lopez was a fluky but good win..but he goes downhill from here..bro had toooooo much talking smack energy,  but couldn't move nothing
Devin is a beast..... he beats all at 135 until shakur comes up
Blessings, John 3:16.  Jesus loves you.
Bendiciones, Juan 3:16.  Jesus te ama.
Kambosos got rocked! Haney made him look like a rookie.
I guess Kambosos game plan was to fight dirty. Clinch, headbutt, and thigh punching lol. He’s forsure fighting like the great Mexicans now
Clinch fest. Weak ass fights. True when they say styles make fights. Snooze fest
Uncle ward and uncle Bradley smh. Shame on them
Kambosos kept switching from left to right ...but wasn't doing anything to his advantage with it ...
World champ right here..
too black too slick
Devin the truth💪
Why they calling him unified  The disrespect American fighters get in these other countries
Awesome 👍
BORING - crouching below the waist and grabbing headlocking instead of fighting
Devin isn’t even prime yet
Haney ain't all that
This fight was much more fun than the 1st. Haney took some decent shots too, but ultimately outclassed Kambosos again
He definitely won but what stuck out to me watching this video is how "hittable" Haney is. Footwork looked good but he didn't seem super "slick", can definitely be touched and if it's the right person throwing those punches then he's in trouble
U use to think Haney had a lot of holes in his game but it I was wrong he can fight congrats became one of my favs after this fight
Devin is accurate with those shots
I can't front Devin killed him lol I Still Say Teofimo Should of been Undisputed, Don't give a fuck What Anyone Say Period
Boring...
If u still doubting Dev now, u just don’t like boxing.  Dude is the TRUTH and he’s only getting better.  Best lightweight in the world, period.
Devon starting to put the right hand in his arsenal Aw shyt
Haney reminds me of sugar ray
He's just too big for boy George.
cool
You definitely can tell haney is from the Mayweather gym. So similar. That straight right and footwork
After watching this game, I can now tell that Haney can't beat Tank Davis.
Devin haney stick with his game play like how he did with the first fight throw the jab
Haney vs Loma = Dream fight
Man I wanna see Haney & Shakur fight
Haney NO POWER PUNCHER
This fight shows me two things Haney can take a punch. Also I need Haney vs tank cause taking a tank punch different . Other than that Devin using angles with a high punching output hard to beat .
Old Linares gave more competitive fight for Haney than prime Cambosos....
Oh this was one of those fights lol. The favorite got beat tf up, and everyone wants to call him a warrior.
I didn’t even kno this had happened
Good fight,  overrated by calling it " dominated fight".
PUT HIM IN WITH TEO AND SEEWHAT HAPPENS..
No pegan ni con tierra ninguno de los dos!!
If you don’t keep your hands up you better keep your head out of the way and off that line. For some reason Kambosos wasn’t doing either 🤷‍♂️
Haney Haters acting like ghost now. Manz walked kambosos down and showed a difference in skill level, we also saw kambosos do the hugging, funny how he isn't getting the same treatment Haney got. props to Kambosos for bringing the heat.
Devin is nice AF but I do think ever since he got his chin touched against and lost his legs a little against Lenaries, (a fight he fought well in besides that) he has a tendency to tie up more quickly when an exchange is about to happen.
So much disrespect for calling Devin Haney the unified champion on multiple occasions. Never referred to him as undisputed champion
Great game plan & great execution from the youngest undisputed champion.
Haney is too big period!!!!! I will give him all the credits in the world when he fights guys who are bigger and taller than him and remains undisputed
Haney won. Kambosos should learn defense
Devin beat tf out that kid, wasn’t even close. had the kids whole face red 😂
Haney was popping his ass
Commentator is dumb
Love the Haneys respectful people ! Raza !
After watching this fight I'm 1000% sure now that Loma kicks Haney's ass...
After a performance like that and they still won't give him his credit...He's undisputed not unified
Gayweather 2.0
Kambosos whole team are racist
Boring
haney has no knock out power
Man i ain't even know they were going to rematch ain't that some sh*t, i guess this fight didn't get that much promotion like the 1st and also seems like it was too soon from the 1st fight
Nice win is time for pit bull Cruz let's see what he can do
Now Haney fan!!!
Deym, kambosos kept his head as an open target for haney.
Whenever you see the word "equity," you know that you are dealing with evil Communist monsters.  Promoting "Equity" is literally just an excuse that Communists have used throughout history to seize citizen's private property and all of the farmland in order to #1 enrich the elite ruling class, #2 establish more tyrannical control over the people, and #3 discourage population growth.  Take a good look at what "equity" did to Zimbabwe.  Mugabe brutally murdered all of the white farmers and seized their land, then the economy completely collapsed, and now China controls the land and black people didn't get FUCKING SHIT (similar to how BLM didn't do a single fucking thing to help black people).  IT'S STRAIGHT OUT OF THE COMMUNIST MANIFESTO.  FIGHT FOR FREEDOM; FIGHT COMMUNISM!.....vvgyy
Devin was aggressive like never before, people can't stop doubting this kid now.
Haney smoked him from the outside. You wanna beat Haney you need great punching power, pressure, and a solid chin because you'll most likely eat something to get inside
HANEY VS CRAWFORD NEXT FIGHT?
No knockdown.. Matibay talaga c gambosos
Sad to watch. It was a proper beating
💤 😴
Damn, what caused that gash on the back of Kams head? Unusual spot to be bleeding.
Congrats Devin. This was amazing fight to watch.
Haney gave that boy a "Project beatdown"💪👊💪🤣🤣🤣
For me if kambosos he use they same style of manny 2-3 punch  then side steps think it very useful especially he always open his face without cover.
Haney Schooled Kambosos
Haney vs Loma lets go!
Stay motivated and move on.  The world is not doing well. #pemerhatiamatir
WATCH !This will make you comfortable https://m.youtube.com/shorts/DU6l-qBJyX0
Haney a dog, completely over took kambosas like he was an amateur
Haney is just too good for Kambosos 😂 maybe he’s to good for anyone in that division
Haney is just too quick excellent foot work and great jabs. Congratulations to him. Taiwo watching from Nigeria 🇳🇬👍🏿
I'm wondering if Tank can match Devin.
He beat him.bad
I’m glad to see devin Haney start to box more throw more punches instead of the mayweather style. They going at this time💪🏾
these guys look SO mediocre compared to Loma. Loma makes short work of both.
I dont know what Kambosos was doing. With the movement that he had, and the hooks he was throwing I think it would have been good to study Edwin Rosario. To find himself inside and land those hooks especially to the body. He did a great deal of moving around in the early rounds, but he didn't throw nearly enough punches throughout the fight. You could see Haney frazzled a bit in the first few rounds by his movement, and roughness, so you could see he was working somewhat in the right direction, but he was not nearly good enough to take home the W. And sidenote: honestly I think he needs to work on his jab, cause it kinda stinks. Good win for Haney, I'm excited to see how he handles under more pressure and against someone like Gervonta, who I think won't be so easily defeated by a simple jab, he has good defense and hes rough and tough and has powerful, and precise punches. So if he's gonna be the best guy around at those lower weights, that's who he's gotta beat. I know people are talking about a Loma fight, but honestly I think he's nearing past his prime, and I am much more excited to see a Davis fight hopefully within the next 1 or 2 years
Thank you Devin, you made me $500
Kambosos has to learn to move his head, I'm sure Loma will cause trouble for Haney. Kambosos is not a very skilled Lomachenko, agile, and good hitting accuracy
That dude is built differently his 🧬 is strong
Good fight..but Stevenson smokes him
Haney is the truth, I want to put Davis up there with the likes of Crawford, Spence, Shakur and Haney but until he gets some W’s against one of these guys I think he’ll always be under them. Hopefully his promoters can at least get Davis a Lomo fight, then Haney. I’d love to see it!
I think Ryan VS Haney would be a good match
💪🏿💪🏿
https://youtu.be/nbH52DzKKQM
If I was Haney I would get in the gym ASAP. He makes good decisions throwing punches but his power is suspect to be in light heavy! Do some weighted calisthenics my boy 💪🏾💪🏾
Wow they were both hard
Dam good fight
The name Kambosos is one us Aussie are going to want to forget in a hurry. I know he came up against a better fighter but it's still an embarrassing situation.
I dont know what Kambosos was doing. With the movement that he had, and the hooks he was throwing I think it would have been good to study Edwin Rosario.

Should have been deducted points for excessive clinching!  Pitbull will break devin Stankeys ribs
Kambosas has always been trash only reason he became relevant is cause he beat lopez and that was just luck other then that he’s always been trashhhhhh and now he is washed 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
bro yall saying devin got no power and kambo is buckling at EVERY punch literally
If haney fight like this he would sell more ticket in the future. He is now more offensive than defense.
Kambosos fighting super dirty with them leg punches, bum doesn’t deserve to be called champion.
are we supposed to be impressed by haney the hugger? still couldnt even hurt kambosos 😑 I have loma beating this dude pillar to post before haney sr. throws the towl into the ring, making him quit in between rounds, or outright knocking haney out cold
What no hoe in the middle???
Hello
He not ready for tank 😂 good fight tho
Oh look Asian shape shifting Elon musk is the ref.
I hate  to watch fight y people would giv up their health for money look at those hard hit he got in his head n face those thing damage ur nerve n brain 🧠 😤 😒
Tay k
Using the eye test, and your eyes do t lie to you, it’s obvious Haney is a class above Kambosos. Respect to George though.
You would think you would get your left up if you're getting tagged with rights all day..wow!! zero adjustments..soo basic.
Real Dog💪🥊
Timothy Bradley is the biggest hater in boxing..... dude has no credibility
Make Haney vs Lomachenko! Let Haney retire him!!
Kambosos is terrible
I’ve been the biggest fan of this kid since his first fight in America …So happy to see him at the top of this boxing shit and the top of his game … now i see every once else coming along …No he’s not a heavy power puncher he just gone beat you up for 12 rd’s straight!!
Now let's see him against another top notch fighter to see how good he really is. Shakur Stevenson should be next for him. But I guess we are never gonna see that fight. Simply because those top fighters do not want to fight one another for real. They gonna keep ducking each other till they turn 35 years old like Floyd bitch used to do. Floyd used to wait for top fighters to get old then fight them. Like he did for Shane Mosley and Pacquiao.
Unified?!?!?
*The comments by the NON Black people against Haney are so hilarious! When Fury wins we applaud him, yall should try it* 😂😂😂
No Pretty but Effective! Congrats to Haney once again, one to bigger and better things
I've never seen a fighter swing so fast but hit so soft . . . . It's perplexing to be honest lol
Boy o' Boy does this make Teofimo Lopez look bad.  :(
Devin "the boring" Haney, undisputed runner "boxer"
Good fight from these two warriors god bless them both.
A perfect result when u work har and are consistent on it u well see the rewards ,blessing to Devin..
Can't wait to watch the UNDISPUTED Social Media CHAMP Vs Tank! But probably the biggest show down in all history will be Crawford vs Spence!!!
Haney is the champ. Great fight by both. As a Aussie I love kamposas  . Regroup. Get some wins . Your time will come . Don’t let success get to your head . Don’t let setbacks get to your heart
The difference of level was just beyond "way to much". A real beating to say the least. Love how laser focus was Haney throughout the whole fight.
Dominant*
El tipico negro
GEORGE KAMBOSOS IS A HELLENIC GUN!!!!! 😇🙏👏👏✊💪👊🥊✝️🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷
I always knew Haney would’ve took the dub, the discipline and how technical he is with his fighting shows how good he really is. Although I admired Kambosos’s spartan mentality. I respected the fact how much heart he had and how eager he was to stop Haney even implementing head movement. At the end of the day Haney was the better man. Respect to Kambosos tho for sure
Haney and kambosos both gave it everything. Maybe less defending with the face would’ve been good. So, when is that lucky bum teofimo rematching loma? The bum got a lucky W due to a severe shoulder injury and is now running so hard he has gotten irrelevant again.
Prime Pacman could fight them both in one night.
Teofimo Lopez destroys both these clowns .
OK so did this fight get the attention it deserved  NO!!!!!!!!!!
Spartan my a$$ , no one told him theTruth that the real spartan were very dark skinned ppl.
This time  Haney  fought a good fight.
At one point Haney was walking him down! Excited to see him at 140 and potentially welter!
I fall asleep when the fights start.when I woke up,I fall asleep again.y?
Ma sha Allah. He says Alhamdulillah when the ref raised his hand.
Why are this Australian keep saying unified instead of undisputed champion? That is exactly what the announcer said.. Wat rubbish
boxing fans ☠
I think tank still beats Haney.
another shut out
Just keep tank name out your mouth !
The announcer meant to say the “Undisputed Lightweight Champion” not unified.
Good fighting from Haney💯 I can tell practice pays off💪🏾 nice way throwing that jab!
WTF is this “initiated clinch” bs?🙁
My power c haney matibay lng tlga ung kambosos
Loma is the key 🔑
kambosos forgot the basics.protect yourself at all time.forgot to defend just because haney was not a power puncher
I see they still disrespectful calling Devin the unified champion, and not the undisputed champion...SMDH
They ain’t like just the jab so he had to show y’all he had combos too😂🤷🏽‍♂️
rolly romero maybe have the skill to beat haney
Are mfs gonna stop playing with him now?🤷🏽‍♂️
Haney showed he can not only fight on the outside but mix it up. What a champ 👊🥊
Now time for Tank 😬🔥🔥🔥
Kambosos came out emotional. Devin stayed composed and sticked to the jab.
I jus don’t see what everyone else see …. Davis will knock him out
Tank still fucks him don’t care what anyone says
Glad  this is all over for Devin, got the belts & took a horrible 2 fight deal, flying all across the world twice, mandorty rematch & the money wasn't even great. Onwards to better things
Thumbs up to both fighters; especially Haney. Teofimo lost to Kambosos bcoz he was way too angry; he wasn't thinking right in that fight
Showed some great skills tonight Haney top dog fr 💪🏻
Devin Haney is a weight bully, hes big as shit and has no power. When he moves up weight hes gonna have some problems.
I don't think anyone can beat Haney at 135. Maybe Shakur Stevenson if he moves up
Truck shakur or tank would hurt him bad
Bully beat down from haney!!!!
Never heard of this Devin.
kambosos is a bum, he can't beat anybody in the top tier.  Teofimo was a loudmouth who believed his own hype, (talking about the "Takeover") ridiculous.  Devin will lose against:  Ryan, Shakur, and Definitely Tank, he might beat Lomochencko.
Loma vs haney needs to happen next.
Haney cheated and im black
No credit. Boxers are glorified for beating average boxers nowadays. Have him fight someone that can actually hurt him and it will be a different outcome. Haney chin is questionable and beating average boxers doesn't make u great. Chavez in his prime would've demolished this kid.
They fought again? Its boxing. Who cares
This was like a mixture of fight 1 and the Linares fight where he stood his ground more.
George Thrombosis again
Forza e onore!
Man… kambo would’ve done better leaving it at one fight. The speed, the defense…This fight seemed to Clearly expose that they are actually on 2 diff levels if there was any doubt. I would say this is similar to wilder fury except that wilder has maybe a top 3 right hand power all time if he connects so he at least has a punchers chance. Outside of the first round and all the physical aggression, Kambo looked the same by the 3rd. Haneys speed almost seems like it went up a notch. Those 1,2 combos to kambos head were blurry. He’s a scary dude.
I’m pretty sure everyone knew this was the outcome.
Can’t wait to see Devin move up to 140 and take over there
These 2 didn't have a clue what the ref was saying in the beginning. Facts
Floyd will smoke this two fools
Say what you won’t about his power he’s still a champ
Boxing masterclass by Devin Haney 🥊. I just laugh at the casuals and haters picking Kambosos. He never stood a chance against Haney who eats, sleeps and shits boxing.
Dang
comes down to boxing smarts. You can be the hardest worker in the gym but if you don't have the smarts your head takes more hits than the other person.
Kambo is a tough fighter with a solid chin, but Haney is just too much.
Devin can definitely power punch if he wanted to. If you look, he rotates his hips very little compared to all of the power punchers out there. If he worked some squats/deadlifts for strength, and focused on turning his hips into his shots, he'd generate a ton of power when he wants to. It's literally the only missing piece to this absolute master of the fight game. Some Olympic lifts could help him with this kinetic chain as well. Those who can't power punch are either small or don't generate enough power from the ground. Devin is definitely not small- He's athletic as hell. I literally can't find one punch where he turns his hips more than maybe 30 degrees tops. Devin should consider incorporating some peekaboo style to get the feel of it. It also would only help his inside game.
I had kambosos winning 10 of 12 rounds robbery! what were these judges watching?
Kambosos so much waisted energy
Only 23 and he dominating
This time it wasn't just a defeat by a good Jab. This time Devin put in solid statement by being aggressive and a lot of them top guys will think twice before signing to fight Devin
PILLOW HANDS DONE IT AGAIN
The amount of hits George took is crazy 🤣
Great Fight boys amazing display of heart blood sweat in skills nPatience u put on💪
Haney superiol punches and nice style
Great fight between Mr Kambosos and Devin. At 140 0r 147, both fighters can't compete with Shakur.
Haney is a badman, respect to him 💯
Feels like I’m watching an early Golovkin fight. Haney is a beast!
"the unified"???? 🤔
What a shit of fight
Champ devin Haney p4p
Haney could’ve fought like that the 1st fight but he did what he had to, then everyone complained that it was boring then look what happens 😂 levels to this game
They Dont have ,,power punch
All he do is grab
Congratulation champ 🏆
Kambusta
nice work
Kambosos con Mucho corazón cero técnica, apostó por un solo golpe para ganar , Haney le tomó la medida con contragolpeo excelente
Haney is that big boss hard on that boxing stage Kambosas can't get passed
I don't give a shit what anyone says, but just going off of what we've seen from George lately and probably throughout his entirety in boxing, he doesn't know how to box. He doesn't have the fundamentals or basic skills just analyzing him when he's sparring or boxing. He's emotional. Reactive for no reason, flinches unnecessarily, he's all posturing and false bravado which makes him who he is, a shitty boxer. He thinks he's better than what he is, and it shows that he's not good, at all. Just a "punchers chance", like deontay.
Oh yea I like Haney he really did improve this fight and he fights with balls like with Mexican style rare to see that in a black fighter especially sense he trained with mayweather he reminds me of a pretty boy Floyd style
Great work king devin Haney is a beast 💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾🤛🏾🤜🏾🤛🏾🤜🏾✊🏾🤜🏾🤜🏾✊🏾
Very good fight I like GK better then Haney but atleast this time Haney came to fight unlike fight 1 . Very good fight from both men well done .
Con Gervonta lo quisiera ver ho con loma al negrito
Remember this!  Haney will be mayweather part 2! He’s too smart defensively.
Loma next My man needs to get his belt back ASAP
Kambosos never beated Teofimo  he was awarded that fight, Is a weak champ not elite.
Pillow hands can’t even do real damage to an average B class fighter. Confirms why he will always be the e-mail champion. 😂
the kid is good.
Haney is weak sauce🥳
Commentators were Australian for sure
That was great! Respect to both as Kambosos is clearly tough af but Haney's skills are on a different level. Great fight 👏🏾
Great fight, Devin, broke out his combinations and made it a bloody unimous slugfest. Hats off to the young undisputed lightweight champ of the world!
devin is good,,, he’s not great though.
Haney gonna be a problem
Devine "the clincher" Haney... garbage boring boxer...
I like this Haney win, hoping to like him more going forward. Right now I still FFWD his fights (even highlights)
Pitbull Cruz 🥊
brutal
ESPN too rank still calling him still unified light weight champion. They just hate to call him what he is undefeated undisputed light weight champion
Kambosos para todo con la cara!
What did they expect was gonna happen? This should've never been a rematch
It’s crazy how much experience Haney got from these 2 fights !! He’s leveled way up !! Gonna be hard to beat him !! Let’s go Haney !!
By round 10 Kambosos is so tired he can't even defend his face. His corner should've thrown the towel in. Luckily Devin isn't that hard of a puncher but still.. smfh.
KamBosas thought because he came with a different style  it was going to work. 💯🥊
Looks like Kambosos burned his stamina up with all that awkward movement. By the 6 round he was just trying to make it.
Domina*N*t. Not dominate. The word is domina*N*t, With an N. Not dominate. Dominant. I want you filthy illiterates to start getting the basics.
Kambrosos no tuvo nada que ofrecer se le acabo el reinado dos veces lo derrotó denin haney segunda pela en su propia tierra
Haney, Shield,Wilder, Baumgardner. All Major win last night. 🥊🎱♠️♠️♠️♠️
Damn that's cold ❄ 🥶  They called him the Unified. He's Undisputed. Unified is when you have either 2 or 3 belts. Undisputed is when you have all 4 🏆🏆🏆🏆. Devin has all 4 except for the WBCs Franchize Championship title in which he delined to own. The same belt that GK and TL thought that made them UNDISPUTED. But it's not universally recognized by the other 3 sanctioning bodies (ibf, wbo, wba)
"Dominate performance"
🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣 🤣  My man whooped Kambosis azz badly. Punished him every round.......
I like Devin and hes legit but lets also put things in perspective. Kambosos is a guy that beat an unfocused Teo and thats his claim to fame. Hes not a high level boxer, isnt a big puncher and isnt fast. Haney got tagged several times in this fight with shots that if he got hit by someone like Tank he`d be in serious trouble.
Kambosas fought like teo did when they fought
Stop giving Haney too much props. He should have Knocked him out. Its not just about winning its how you win. Kambosos was one of those fighters he should have knocked out.
Kambosas has zero foot work and zero defense, he's doing the wilder thing and relying on power only it doesn't work when you fight an elite boxer.
Does that say onlyfans on the back of Haney's shorts?
*Dominant
If Haney fights the other top 3 he will lose his next fight.
He did not look sharp like he did against Linares or Díaz. Tank will end up on top at the end of the day
Tht was a Damm good fight! But Devin wasn't bout 2 loose 2 him 😂😂😂😂
Title says “dominate” not “dominant” 😅
Lol not surprised with the outcome, kambosos was never a good fighter but will be remembered as one of the biggest upsets with his fight with teo. Haney doing a good job but won’t be able to keep them belts in this division.
Devin has Made old BOB Arum a happy man, he met his contract obligations with ESPN KKK media network and is about to make a ton of money with the Loma fight and we'll see if by chance Devin hangs with Top Rank a little longer.
Kamboses must have a strong face or neck or both cos he’s getting punched in the face but not falling, or Haney don’t have power in hes punches?
Still unified??lol undisputed racist pigs 🐖
Haney looks like Margarito with those gloves
Pitbull Cruz k.o a haney
That was a good fight edge of my seat every round Devin can go toe to toe he showed what he can do adapted great fight
Pillow hands with another boring fight
It's funny seemed like haney was losing energy but then remained consistent the rest of the rounds and near the end got some kind of energy boost. Definitely was beating the other guy good
Kambosis will be the new gatekeeper for lightweight.  Guy has so much heart, but haney is a legend in the making.  DH best in lightweight. Don't care what anyone says.  DH vs Tank would be such an amazing fight.  Up there with bud Crawford and Spence.  Love Kambosis.  You'll always be a champ! Keep moving forward!  I wish Loma didn't have so much bad shit going on.  He's starting to fade away from the division.  Plus,  he's only getting older.  Such a damn shame
Kambosos had WAY more moments in this fight, offensively he was much better, but his defense was terrible. Dropping his hands, throwing then not coming back home… really killed him.  As for Devin, this actually looked like a fun fight to watch, plenty of action. Thats the main issue with his older fights but they’re getting more entertaining recently
Kamboses didn't do anything different but stand their like a punching bag in front of all his home country people pathetic, he did nothing like the way he should up to fight Teo,  like he was a scared little kid, I could have done better than that, there's nothing to me to brag to much about Haney i still don't see anything great about him, Kamboses you just didn't throw and all that bobbing abs moving around like some idiot was stupid, the whole thing about boxing is let them hands go.
Haney is not a bad fighter think he needs to work on his foot work tho can be a problem against quicker fighters
Haney is to much for Kambosos. Congr Champ
I found it DISRESPECTFUL That they announced Devin as the UNIFIED Champion. Devin Haney is THEE UNDEFEATED AND UNDISPUTED LIGHTWEIGHT CHAMPION!!! Highly disrespectful
Garbage. boring . no power . Looks like Fraudweather and smelerbe had a love child . No wonder this crap was a free fight. Would never pay for a Haney fight
Haney shut his azz up
My apologies, I’m not impressed with this dude. I think 🤔 he is overrated#100
Haney on my number 2 list of P4P
All I heard kambososes corner was faint some more, go in there and faint that's all I heard not an actual game plan or words of inspiration you need from your corner even though you're the one in the fight it makes a big difference hearing the right words from your corner his corners a disgrace take him to America
All that talk for nothing lmao GEORGYYYYYYY
Really…. Lol wat did y’all expect? Haney to lose? 😂😂😂
Tank and Shakur beats haney
Kambiso no es piensa nosé ni como le ganó a el hondureño  cualquier cambion le gana
I think everyone in the 🌎 knew the outcome of this fight George fought better this time I will say that but it wasn't enough good fight much respect to the both of them especially George for having the heart to fight him again
For once top rank coming thru with some good highlights 🔥
Beat the dog shit out that boy twice in Australia
He’s got the best jab on the scene at the moment
It’s crazy I didn’t even know this fight happened
Haney, Shakur > Tank
If you saw the first fight you knew this was going to happen.
I still need to see this Haney guy in the ring with someone with power. He got the win kudos
😶‍🌫️😶‍🌫️
HANEY VS LOMA
Great performance for haney but too far for shakur
cambosos bad boxin bad bad bad
Thats how you F!!! Box !!!!!!!!
Haney put a fat cut on his eye.
Kambosos bisa kena one two terus napa yak
Great fight for Devin but I see a lot of concerning things. Devon’s lack of power and body attack means he will have issue with power punchers at 135 and most top fighters at 140
Kambosos.un boxeador de clase b.no entiendo como le ganó a .teórico.enjundioso pero nadamos. y pitbul lleven lo despacio.2 o 3 peleas más. Y la neta q le mete un susto te a haney.y al q sea
Mahina pala suntok ni Haney,
good fight  d got hands fs
If Haney builds his legs and core more that knockout power would be there! Hell of a performance! It’s good to see him actually sit down on his punches. Linares told him if he followed his 1,2 combo with a 3 or 4 it would be a knock out. He’s turning that corner and is gonna need power to beat Davis!!!!
Good fight with a predictable outcome... At least we were spared the whole "Spartan Warrior"  bullshit that we had to endure after the Lopez fight.. Kambosos knew the outcome before he stepped into the ring.. So did we...😉
He beat Kambosos so bad in last few rounds I thought blood was leaking out his ears for a minute. Good fight.
I notice Haney doesn’t have a left hook. It was there all night but he couldn’t use it!
Whyd the announcer say 'Unified' lightweight champion?
Pacman vs haney... That was interesting fight if haney not run and hug like what mayweather did... Pacman can knockout haney in first round!
Devin's reach is what makes him. Lomachenko will reclaim his belts soon enough.
Never seen a stat for initiated clinches displayed during a fight 🤣. Reaching much?
Denle la despedida a haney cuando se tope con el pitbul 🇲🇽😎
Feed him to Cruz.
Haney fights with his mouth open the whole fight if a puncher ever catches him clean he’d be high risk for a broken jaw. Kambosos fights with his hands down and doesn’t move his head. He learned nothing from the 1st fight.
The only reason he won was due to all the illegal punches behind the Ear...
If Haney attacks the body... knockout for sure
Haney vs Lomachenko 👀
This was the best competition, from both fighters congratulations 🇳🇦👏🥊
Town Bidnizz in rare form!
I see alot of Floyd in Devin. Intense fight respect to both.
Unified? He's undisputed champ
Dominant*****
Wtf was this 😭😭😭😭
Gervonta ko Devin
F.... All this mayweather stylo boring fighters
Great fight for Haney just wish he had more power
Haney look impressive here
The Monster will K.O both of these slow boxers.
Haney is a boring fighter, nothing amazing, jab and move jab and hold. Mayweather at that age was K.O'ing fools. Not hugging them.
Was a dirty tactic that won him the fight.
Good fight, great fights ahead for Haney. Gotta take them though!
He got punished twice he jus can’t beat Haney!!
Outstanding performance from both men!!!
ayy
🥊 Devin Haney Lets go!!!
Kambosos is tough as nails, but Haney's reach advantage and exceptional technique were too much for him. Good fight, tho.
Real shit, Kambosos looked lost AF. Almost as if he was unaware of the pocket. Kept coming to a stop after evading a single punch, but still in the pocket!! Hands down far too much to a faster, more accurate  puncher. Been saying this for a couple years now..Haney/Loma only fight I wanna see. God, I cannot get over how sloppy George looked. Just trash, honestly. Solid chin. If Haney put more punches together, or had legit power, this dont go past 3.
Look he say Alhamdulillah after winning
Shakur would school haney
No one gonna mention the 50+ clinches he initiated in the fight? I like Haney but he does hold  A LOT ever since getting hurt from Linares. I dont see him beating Shakur or Tank and even Loma imo
I stand by what I said I got Haney beating everyone in his division he's just too good!
El mismo estilo de maywrther,de no pelear.
lol
And Still the Undisputed Lightweight champion of the world 🌎 Devin The Dream Haney Alhamdulillah 🤲🏻♥️
Why the boxing is jab , run , and hug and score ! The boxing worlds is so boring to watch this generation no knockdown and no knocked out unliked mma sports and days when mike tyson , mexicans and Philippines rise like brawl to brawl. Its okay to watch because of skills and tactics to fight but nothing to compare about toe to toe fight like Pacquiao and marques , barrera., And morales
TANK WOULD STOP NO POWER DEVIN
ese kamboso es el titere de esa división nunca sube las manos siempre entra con la guardia a bajo intenta cambiar de guardia y siempre recibiendo está cerca su retiro tanto golpe no son buenos
Respect to Haney but if he wants to be exciting to watch hes gonna have to find sum power i cant tecall ONE devin haney ko NOT ONE hes gonna have to hurt ppl Terence Crawford for all his Technical brilliance has the power an tenacity to hurt and ko ppl most of Crawford's fights are stopped by tko or he knockin sumbody out so devin gonna have to figure out if he wants to be a huge attraction
Great fight
Let me get this straight… when Kambosos beat Teofimo they called it a huge shocking upset. Meaning the consensus was that Kambosos is good, but not at the elite level the top guys are.  Haney has been called one of the top 3 in the division and is most likely in most pundits current p4p rankings, meaning generally people view him as elite and a level or 2 above Kambosos.  So he beats Kambosos twice, like he is supposed to do, and now he’s a prodigy that’ll be an all time great? Recency bias is wild.
Total miss match with size and weight!! Boxing seems to have a fair few weight bullies also
Outclassed that man twice in his own backyard 💪💪
Considering the number of clean punches he connected with, If Haney had any power whatsoever, Kambosos would've gone night night
Haney did a damn good job
Great performance by haney I just feel as tho he definitely needs to get stronger he doesn’t seem to have the power to finish
Haney is a good boxer...not powerful but well disciplined 🥊
If Loma doesn't call out Haney if he wins, that makes Haney scarier than Putin...😂😂😂😂 ...
Credit to Haney he’s been training hard and been improving a lot and credit to kambosos he gave his best
After the fight that racist announcer calling Devin Haney the unified champ when he is the Undisputed King of the ring. So much disrespect
Devin almost got the stoppage, bring on Loma and Tank or move up 💯
sooo they dont warn them for clinching anymore ??? dude clinched over 30 times , he is a talented boxer buuut honestly kind of wild how much they let them hug these days . they used to get warned and fined for that amount of clinching not to long ago lol or is it only a factor when a boxer is facing a mma guy because in those instances they are crazy quick to stop the clinching .
I ain't going to  lie they was both throwing those hands 💯💯💯💯💯💯
605
devin haney outclassed kambosos for 2nd time ... if devin had more pop in his punches he would be a superstar
Haney is incredible guy could really box 💯💯💯💯
Kambosos literally robbed the bank on both these fights. Respect to him. Set himself & family up for life. Haney v Loma is gonna interesting
Haney made it look easy , makes me wonder how kambo beat Teo and how teo beat Loma , i don’t wanna hear they makes no more
Great win by Haney, but don't see him beating Loma, Tank, Garcia, Steveson, or Lopez anytime soon or in the future by KO. By points only. He got more than 20 power clean shot at Kambosos chin all night and can't even drop him. Very talented boxer but no power. Only way he can win against top 5 is by points.
Clear to say he knew why he took the rematch kambosas sucks he got lucky to beat Lopez dudes Australian ass juice
Clear to say he knew why he took the rematch kambosas sucks he got lucky to beat Lopez dudes Australian ass juice
The longer this Haney vs Loma is held off the better for Haney and worse for Loma one is moving toward his prime and one is just getting older and closer to retirement don't wanna sound like a hater cause I'm not I'm just calling it how it is
0:44 1:14 3:40 4:54 2:41 2:51 3:02 3:18
Good fight foesho Haney, the shots that was landing was great shots, the difference is, if any way that Gevonta Davis lands any of those punches, The fight would’ve been over. Haney lacks power! Name any fighter, Spence, Bud, Davis, they would have flushed him easily. That’s the Difference! Facts
Boring
After Kambosos defeat he is still handsome in and out even genetically .
The announcer making a big deal out of kambosas every now and then lucky shots but not a word about Haneys multiple big shots in the same round 🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️🤷🏽‍♀️
The winner didn't want to KO the opponent .Just wanted to win. I hate to watch today's young boxers. Afraid to lose that O. Boring
I’m surprised they fought again so soon. The first fight was just in June I thought the rematch would be at least early next year lol
I love what I am seeing from Haney.
Great fight 👏, but I think Loma got this
Shakur would beat the shit out of Haney
Devin is 10 x better than Mayweather
That Was A Boring Ass Fight
Haney is great and imo would love to see him tested at 140. 135 is looking too easy for him. Loma will be the big test but I can see him giving loma some trouble.
Haney should go to Ukraine and take down loma then Honduras to take down Lopez pulling up in fools backyards straight bullying em. Young goat for sure
Shakur vs Haney that’s the fight that we want now
The Aussie has a chin, he’s getting touched! Damn!
the best highlight reel i've seen from top rank and shouts out to kambosos with his ferocious chin cause i thought he was gonna go down but he made it to the end like a warrior. Everyone knew Haney was gonna school him again for the rematch
Never seen so many 1 2’s landed sheesh
After seeing this u gotta think about how hard Tank hit
Haney still has more to prove because Kambosos is not a great puncher.. Lacking and wild.. Davis is my #1 Lightweight, coming up Stevenson, Ryan Garcia beats Haney also.. and what about Loma? I just do not see Haney as best Lightweight in the World
CJ Ross had Haney losing
Beat the breaks off that kid.  Luckily he got paid and take some time off
Is it.what is it!..Congrats Haney..Respect Kambosos...
Muy buena comtienda ,muy buen trabajo de haney
The kid is solid
Much clearer than in the first fight. The changing of styles didn't serve K. anything
I think that if Devon Haney go to the body he will get it knocked out
Ok I was a Haney hater, but this guy fought nasty yesterday damn he messed George up reminded me of Floyd. Haney doesn’t run like Floyd he boxes he doesn’t get hit. Only thing Haney is not my favorite boxer is cause he don’t have power and I’m a bigger Virgil fan
Try lopez vs haney.
I thought the first fight was better, too many hugs by Haney at first and throughout the fight. Tell me all you like it's my opinion, but Haney just felt a good punch and grabbed kambosos call it smart for me it is not!!! he grabbed kambosos hands and hit him but again it's my opinion and he's still champion so congrats!!!
Ima say and keep saying it can't no light weight last 12 rd with tank when he's fully focused and if you get hits with those bombs he calls hands yo ass is going to sleep
Devon Haney is going to close he need to stay outside
4:38 -- Devin is constantly proving everybody wrong. For those that think he doesn't have a chin. Put it in slow motion. George caught him flush on his chin.
I don't like the coward boxers like Gayweather Haney Stevenson and tank
Uuu u u
People keep talkin about haney has pillow fists. I find quite satisfying when a guy is getting hit, and leaking blood. That's as good as a knockout to me.
Devin haney, fights never really like got me excited but wow his skills are insane.
Yeaaahh, where’s that cop that issued an open challenge boxing match with ppl that were BLM n Haney responded? Great fight Haney👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿✊🏾✌🏾
And the Academy award for best actor go,s to george kambosos jr followed by best surporting actor kambosoa sr  best picture go,s to devin haney ,  george pretending to be a diffrent fighter only to be the same fighter and his father saying devin was raddled.  and for not really quiting the fight game  as he said  he would if he losted in this do or die fight.  tryed hard to get into haneys head like he did by pushing at the weighting . nice try like he did  by getting lopez mad before the fight didn,t work with haney. last pretending not to cry at the end of the fight and not showing up for the post fight interview for this george you get the oscar . you didn,t fool anyone but yourself .
Haney did a wonderful job with the jab🔥🔥
Can’t wait to see who Haney fights next! He can no longer fight no name boxers. I say he calls out Ryan Garcia just to shut him up as well lol I like Ryan too
Haney got that Philly Shell defense on lock!
When will we get Stevenson, Garcia, Haney, or Tank against each other.  It’s clear they are all top dogs around the same weight. Boxers are so scared to take a L
this is why Teofimo always ducked the Haney fight lmaoooooo
🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🇬🇷🦾🦾🦾🦾🦾
🔥
😅🤣😅🤣.... Devin trash... I don't know what fight u weirdos were watching... that was a draw at best... Kam-bozo came to fight and made it a competitive fight... Devin has NO power and he's in trouble and I'm still trying to figure out where this great defense is... he gets hit by everything... Kambosos is a average fighter at best and gave Devin all he wanted... Devin is really in trouble... thats the best Devin can do and that fight was a draw... if he fought Tank...Shakur... Frank Martin... or even Keyshawn Davis like that he's gettin slept...and honestly hes probably gonna get beat by Lomo....truth is he looked horrible at the weigh in... so he definitely only has one more fight at 135... and who he gonna beat at 140...😅🤣😅... those lil powder punches can't keep nobody at 140 off him... lol...dude has no where to go....
LFG !! 🎉 Haney
“Dominant” not dominate
Haney has great skill. Wish he had the knockout power, this fight could have ended quick. Don’t thing they needed to fight again.
HANDS! he beat him up!
Shakur is next?? ? Come on somebody!
If Tank doesn’t knock Haney out… Tank loses by decision.
You could’ve shot George in the head with a pistol and Haney still wouldn’t press forward and fight for a ko
Is Haney ready for Loma?
Lets go Tank.  You already know your losing.  Garcia knows he loses decision.  Nobody wants this fight.  Shakur?  Lomo?
Love him or hate him, get used to hearing “AND STILL” kids the truth
Good highlights.
Please retire George!! You aren't a sportsman. All the tricks your team tried to use to your advantage the first time, only to spew racist comments on the second meeting. Team Cambosas is yellow!!! Scared to come to the states and get beat up.!!!!
When haney faces a pressure fighter with power he will lose Kambosas is trash 🗑 😒
kambosos should of stayed on the southpaw stand..
Hamdoulillah 👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
The ref said Toucha gloves😂
Ya gonna learn black people go through the most in life because we're the toughest people to ever live the word called life. Dealing with us will never be a easy fight why you think canelo been hiding he know better
Fight Tank Davis and stop fighting people that nobody wants to watch  🎉
Tank still ❤the goat
If anyone could have knockout power in their hands...it was over right there.
Salute to both these gentlemen! Devin Haney congrats on going to Australia and getting the win
Haney looked like a weight drained ghost or  zombie on the weigh ins Friday night, then does this to kambosos Saturday night lol.
This has to go down as one of the most boring useless ass rematch fight
Not taking anything away from Haney like his style. If he had the power to go with it man this kid be no Joke. Sorry but when he fights a real fighter like Davis he getting knocked out. I belive Garcia and Teo knocking Haney out. These are fighters with power like no other. Haney I belive its time for you to really prove you the man and make a real fight happen. Kam is an okay boxer taking nothing from him at all but that whole him beating Teo was a surprise win belive he got lucky. But I bet he fight Teo at Teo weight class right now and with how focus Teo is Teo beating him with no problems at all.
Who bet on kombosos 😂💀
undisputed not unified
Damn i george!
Damn I knew he would outbox Kam but I didn’t expect Devin Onlyfans Haney to outclass him this bad. Great performance.
Haney showed a tremendous amount of skill in this fight, kambosos has one heck of a chin though geesh!
Kambosos was always a fluke, man. Teo kos him in a rematch.
Haney is so skilled I love his game! With that being said, I am now 100% sure Tank would beat him. The things that Haney DOES excel in (Speed, IQ, Footwork, Defense) Tank also excels in. The 1 thing that Haney DOES NOT excel in (Power) Tank does excel in. And this is why I am now for certain Tank would beat him. Kambosos ate SO MANY clean shots from Devin. If Tank lands those clean shots, the opponent is going down!
And STILL
10th round could've been stopped.   (37 punches landed by Haney to Kambosos 1 punch)  Haney made Kambosos look like an amateur again.  Yet Kambosos beat the guy that beat the guy, that is ranked in p4p...  🤣  How does that make sense lol🤔🤔
Damn Haney is just something else. You could tell kambosos was trying everything
Teofimo vs Haney next please
Alhamdulillah
Comatose-kambodos!
the highlights are always better in boxing.
Its a shame for Kambosis trying to switch from Orthodox to Southpaw, it showed that he faced a different kind of fish than he did previously
Top Rank get rid of this announcer.   He biggest hater.     He has no idea what he talking about.    Hanny dominated this fight.
tank will beat haney ass! i hope isaac cruz will get a shot at haney if he surpass isaac cruz he is ready for Tank.
Haney is too big for these guys...#pause...but really tho
If Haney fights like this vs Davis, then Davis kos him
Kambosos took some lessons from jeff horn 🤣🤣🤣
Haney has a strong will.  He never backed down in Australia.   He owned the ring.  George is retired,  not going to beat anybody now.
can someone remind me why did devin haney convert to islam again?
Kambosos flinches a lot
Liked how they played that Nas hate me now at the end. Great win again Haney
When Haney attacked Kambosos, I was having Sugar Ray Leonard flashbacks.  He looked very good when he went on the offensive.
We already saw this we didn't need to see it again 😂😂
I believe that tank would’ve got him out a lil faster, no disrespect to the champ….
🫣😂😂😂😂
Both of them much much much better than mayweather 😃👍👍👍
believe me Haney is a great fighter, but inoue will ko a lot of these fighters
In Arabic, we have a phrase. It's *"karackaka, karackaka"* It means, *"ayo, kambo, you fuckin suck!"*
Dirty fighter, Haney wom because the ref allowed him to hit behind the head, clinch, throwing elbows and shoving Kambosos down throughout the fight. Dirty fighter.
That's Floyd 2.0
Who didn't see this coming. In fact, this was an easier fight for Haney the 2nd time around. Kambosos needs to fight Lopez again.
Nothing but a bright future ahead for Devin. Took all the belts and beat him twice in his country. Respect to both but especially Haney for being a class act with tons of youth on his side.
I'm sorry Curious George Kambosos is not a Champ,  I  mean he is not built right,  he keeps his guards low,  meaning he is not a natural fighter because he is not learning the fundamentals of the game,  Kambosos got about 3 good shot,  out of 12 rounds and out of the nature of a nonmelanated crowd they were just hollering out of hate,  because out of the 12 rounds, Kambosos didn't stand a chance, and seriously I hope this one trick pony is never heard of again, is the reason the fight was held in Australia because if it was held in America,  they probably would of sold about 3 tickets Max, Kambosos is as boring as nausea day,  nobody wants it,  he is actually a waist of digital film,  letting a man come were your wife and children lives and get your A.... whipp twice. I pretty sure in privacy if Devin would of ask of Kambosos lunch money he understands to hand it over without a bark,  by now,  woos cookie,  with all those Satanic markings tatted on his body,  man we are so close to Armageddon,  Satan power is down spiraling,  just as sure dishwater release itself as soon as you remove the stopper.
Damn thanks for telling us who’s going to win before we watch 🙄
He ain't like Tank hits hard
Good win for Haney I think he would outbox tank Davis easily after seeing this performance it’s no doubt in my mind he has some god given talent
Kambosis should never have fought Haney... Should never have fought rematch... But his ego got the better of him. His handlers did not advice him well.🔥🔥🔥🔥 Had he followed the strategy of Mayweather he could have gone far without losing.🔥🔥🔥🔥
black man the best 😂
Kambosos got his two paydays
Haney vs Loma classic fight
Devin Haney is the Smallest Boxer😎😎😎😎 You Want to Big Fight or Your Loser!
Same as last fight, all jabs
We all knew the outcome to this one since the last one 😂😂😂
Los dos Han hablado muchísimo 😂😂😂
Loma is definitely past his best but I simply cannot see haney beating him. Don't get me wrong he's proved to be very good but I think a big hitter will stop him no problem at all.   Just my opinion I'm definitely not always correct lol
Kambosos sucks
I can't believe George's team thought fake stance switching was the adjustment they needed to make smh. I didn't think he'd win either way but with that shit, he clearly had no chance. Him and his team were just grasping at straws. Didn't phase Devin one bit with that wasted energy.
And hats off to kambosos for taking his loss like a man, he is a true warrior and a good guy
Dude gets beat easily by tank or Ryan
It was better then the first fight!! Kambosos is done!! But Haney it's going to have a thought time at 140 he is a master boxers but no power he should have taken kambosos out in the 11 round!
Boy the 🌍 gotta hate niggas🤣🤣
All that spartin talk they over exaggerating how tough this dude is cut east didn’t do shi go sit down somewhere your top 10 maybe in the division far from top 5 though one trick pony. And still with no peda no cheating devin the dream Haney BOYYYYYY 😊 flava flav voice
His corner shoulda been threw the towel in 🤦
No one can doubt devin again, he showed how versatile he can be, he actually let his hands go and used combinations, and looked great doing it, devin is going to be a great watch, master class performance once again
Respect to both fighters. Done him with the 1 the first time around. The 1 - 2 the second time around. Different levels
This is what happens when you get power hungry and just want to take their head off look at Devin Haney what did he do all night? JAB STIFF JABS NOTHING BUT JABS SOMETHING KAMBOSOS FORGOT ABOUT WHERE IS YOUR JAB SON ?
Not hating at all but not impress at all...that wasn't a hard fight for him in any way first fight same way,then to defence again to the same person a ran through like nothing first fight same shot second fight we all new that so not impress at all until he fight one of the top dogs and we all know all the top dogs lets make a real fight
Man Kambosos has great Stamina to be moving like that and he really knows how to get inside he could’ve hurt Haney but Haneys Defense and Blows are pretty devastating being that he’s way bigger
The decision streak continues 😯
Heney fought a lil dirty on this fight and every time kamboso would hurt him a lil he hold him quick😂😂
Tank would have knocked him out
Definitivamente yo creo que el Tank si le gana a Haney, hasta es posible por nokaut
Kambosos defeating Teo was the greatest fluke in boxing history, right next to Buster Douglas defeating Mike Tyson. He had no business having those belts, not even for a minute.
We all know kambosos is a bum. Ppl  just remember his teofimo victory and have him classified as a good boxer. He never was a recognized contender in the division. All these new "undisputed" boxers need to start Fighting the best of the best to qualify as the best In the division.
Haney is weak.. Kambuso is a little guy. HANEY cant even knock him out..
I don’t want to hear anyone say haney ran this fight. He was in front of Kambosos all night not just outboxed him but out worked him too
I would have had George in high guard instead of that switching stuff. Stay on top of Devin. Maybe that was outside his comfort zone. Devin's a beautiful boxer. Distance on his terms. Next level.
Can we Atleast here the fucking scorecards next time !!
Crips and Precise Kevin Haney is.
great fighter, just wish he’d chase the KO more when the opportunity is there lol there was at least three times in this fight he coulda knocked kambosos out cold
I think Kambosos has to stop twitching so much, he's wasting way too much energy and looks really uncomfortable.
Man Kamboso got cooked!  Great fight! Salute to both men!
just using 1-2 very effectively
Dominant is the term. Thanks for the upload.
Very pointless fight. The result was obvious the first time around. Congratulations to Haney whose indisputably undisputed 😂
DEVIN HANEY IS COMING INTO HIS MAN STRENGTH!
Top rank is da real MVP here wit much better highlights!
Devins eyes still look sunken in. This should be his last fight at 135
Gay sss fight!! Fight pitbull Cruz!!!!!💪💪💪💯
Wow, this was a gr8 fight. I am glad that there was a rematch clause it was a great sequel.
The More I watch Haney, the more I’m intrigued in him. But for some reason his style to Box and not go for finishes bothers me. He’s definitely the best Pure Boxer in his Class though & I Can’t wait to see him fight Tank, Loma, and Shakur.
Didn't even know they was fighting. Two irrelevant fighters sorry.
DH just gotta time that uppercut better. Power is coming.
Kambosos looks small
Devin haney is so good so composed he has a great boxing style like Floyd and if he can madter it he’s gonna be one of the best and he might retire undefeated
He did his job. Haney has a good style. Kambosos is too old school. Styles make fights
Pure boxer...once he learns to incorporate more body shots; you'll see his K.O go up!
Haney looked huge. Time to go up to 140
Kambosos was like rocky just taking punishment  punching bag🤕😵‍💫
Devin beat this dude backside again 😂😂😂😂😂
Boring
No one wanted this rematch..
Devin pillows hands haney
That Crowd sounds like The Classic Boxing Scene with Jack Jenkins VS. The White Guy, every time Kambosos puts together any combination….Haney Is Supreme, Congrats to these Amazing Boxers, Whether Wins or takes a Defeat, it takes courage to get in the ring….&’Still…..This Isn’t Professional Wrestling, Listen to the crowd, You Can’t watch Boxing with Emotion, It’s about Logic…When You Know Boxing it’s not about The Ohh’s And Ahh’s…You can easily hear who the crowd had and lost their $’On
I don’t think I ever gave this kid his due but he looked incredible tonight. Devin stayed poised in hostile territory again and outdid his last performance. Congrats champ!
This isn’t a talked about combo but if Dev could have thrown a double jab followed by a left upper cut he would have slept Kambosis
For the meanwhile teofimo can hold this L
👊🏾 👊🏾 👊🏾
Tomatoe cans 😂 let’s be honest kambosos is a c level fighter I want to see good fights not no one way fight like this one #facts
As boring as Haney is. He did his thang
If this fight don’t tell you that Devin Haney is baby Floyd then idk what to tell you
Haney is one of the most skilled boxers ever, but if tanks lands any of those shots that he lets kambosos land it’s gonna be a rough night 👀
And still no power from Haney 💤
So now we know tank scared or the pit bull haney gave the rematch lolwhy not tank scared very muchlol
He took kambosos to school HANEY💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾💪🏾
Good fight
what a boring fight....
The way rematch clauses should be written in contracts. Eligible for rematch if the first fight is close enough to justify it. This fight was just a continuation of the Aussie getting outclassed again.. in fact Haney had him bloody this go around
I have never been sold on Haney but this time i saw a stronger chin by Haney and more agressive. He didnt get the KO but at least he went for it. Thats what fans want to see
Thing is, Tank would’ve knocked Kambosos out
Kambosos people pretty quiet.
No defence for kambobosus... Haney vs Loma is much sprakin sprakin
The expected outcome, Haney dominated yet again. He fought so we'll!!! He definitely deserves the titles!!! No  doubt!!!!
Well looks like George got what he asked for
Lol what’s the excuse now 👀
Haney giving out combos like it's Tekken
Haney is proving fight by fight why he is the real champion. Idk if Tank wants the smoke. Kambosas is a warrior for finishing the fight. You can tell those head injuries hurt him bad. Great fight! Good shit Haney!
devin hit George with everything other than the kicthen sink
Because clinch and run is a gameplan to win the fight.
Devin totally dominated this fight
Waste of our time......kambozo is trash
Haney can't stand against Teo Lopez for sure
Haney vs Tank, cmon for the love of God
Todos sabíamos q sería lo mismo de la primera !! Kambosos no es un boxeador de élite!! Me gustaría ver Haney vs Garcia esa si estaría muy buena
Haney Beat dat dude ass lmao....dude wasn't doin shyt
Kambosos got robbed 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
Kambosos is just another big mouth, Haney gave him the beat down he deserved. 👏🏼
Boxing promo can really phuck up your fight cause I didn't know the exact date but I'm glad a clean reel of the highlights are up already. Haney really did it with this one, if there were doubts they surely should be expelled with how clinical and disciplined this performance was.
Switching trainers won't make up for skill george
Man it is sad that this dude has no power where are you going to survive against any elite fighter with pressure and what boxing skills they're not going to respect your power you don't have trouble with somebody that's going to walk them down I got some head movement
Kambosos' boxing style will never be successfull on haney's style.. but i'm telling you all,, a maidana style boxer will destroy haney..
he's good but boring to watch
dominant win
Kamboses is C level. Devin does not get P4P status’s for beating this bum. He needs to meat guys like shakur or Loma to make it to the P4P.
Haney the champion takes the pressure to kambosos
Great fighter, but never ever pay per view, style to boring for the average person watching boxing, peck peck peck, knockouts get people excited, that’s ufc so popular, and boxing is died
Devin man is great
With the right hand added to his offense … Now he’s fighting like a young Floyd. Still NOT Floyd tho. Floyd had more power and a little better defense. But he’s getting close.
Kambosos LOSE HAHAHA.
Fucked him in his own yard lol 🏆
Didnt even know this fight was happening already. Horrible promoting toprank
Loma's gonna teach you a lesson.
dapat nguso ni haney ang pinuntirya ni kambosos
Devin hit hard but doesn't get the knock down boring 😒
i admit haney did win but holy shit this commentary was bias, they were saying nice punches by haney and he was off by a mile
Whooped that white boy a$$🤣😂🥊👊
Flamboastin
Idk why they even had a second fight it was clear as day in the first fight Kamboso can’t beat Haney or a fighter with Haney style. He needs to go fight them fighters that’s impatient!
He's not ready for Tank. 🤷🏾‍♂️
The culture went 4-0 on the night I'm happy
Gotta give it to Haney he has gotten better every fight
Devin wom but he need to put some power in his hands he xouldnt Even knockdown kamboso i don't see him beating tank
I like George’s adjustments to Haney’s jab. Those movements helped but it also opened up Haney’s arsenal. You take one thing away you get to see what a fighter has and Dev has the goods!
DH took that hat off asap 🤣🤣🤣
Still not ready for tank just my opinion
Haney not fighting Loma… watch!
Haney did What he was suspended to do !!!
Spectacular performance. Mangled that mans face and outlanded him 37 to 1 in the 10th! Haney boxes the ears off Davis and is too big for Loma. I dont see anyone outboxing what is the best jab in boxing and that straight right hand. Star in the making.
Haney should have been able to put George away. Great performance by Haney but his lack of power is troubling.
Haney looked razor sharp and only improved as the fight went on. Well done. Who's next for him?
All Haney got is a jab no power
Le falta boxeo y técnica a ese kambosos vale 🧀cómo no tengo una oportunidad para enseñarles como se hace 😵😎
Devin makes it look so easy
Great heart from Kambossos, but a master class lesson by Haney.
Kambosos ran out of Gas. Haney turned it up as the fight went on. Haney wins of skill and never stopped working. You can tell Haney was hurting Kambosos more than he expected.
time to lomachenko devin
Wao!. Que semejantes bombazos. Creo que con esto, se le acorta la carrera a Kambosos. Tremenda pelea.
Congratulations to Devin Haney 👏 on you win 🏆 against Kambosa .   However he had several opportunities to ko kambosa but couldn't capitalise on them.  I think Shakur Stephenson have more boxing skill than Haney imho🤔 .
I like Haney but i don't see him beating Tank.
Davis has 2 much power for Haney,Don't have enough power but he one of the best!Kam wudnt go the distance with Davis!!
I'm the only one who thinks that maybe the pitbull cruz can give a good fight to haney? I mean he has the  style that kambosos missed tonight
If ur "EMPEROR" was too small then he should've got the fuck out that sand box. HE HAD THE EXACT SAME OPTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS AND STRATEGIES to take n camp as the real KING did but AGAIN failed miserably to do so. This is what happens when you STUNT and FRONT on any soil Fanboy, u get plastered..pounded..and soon 2b stopped..give me this fuckin belt, and get that ass back n ur sandbox. NONE OF Y'ALL IS SKILLED ENOUGH. Fury had to cheat, but that's ok..we ain't Makin no excuses, now we comin harder than ever, and we're completely dominating all of u name by name on ur soil and we takin all ur marbles and ur bitches and leaving u in the sandbox with all of  ur if I could've would've war stories while the true KING is on 2 the next one. U ARE WHAT U ARE N THIS WORLD 🌎 FUCKBOYS AND THAT CAN ONLY MEAN BUT 2 THINGS, EITHER U SOMEBODY KAMBOSAS, OR U NOBODY. U had 2 chances to PROVE that. REMEMBER..AINT NO FUTURE N FRONTIN.  BYE 👋
Haney good boxer no comment # 1
Congratulation Devin!! You went in his backyard and dominated. Must respect for you man!! Good luck champ!!
Wait who says look @ me in the stare off 🤔
Haney vs. Lopez or Loma would be great!!!
Thats what happens when you don't out your hands up. He used his face as the shield.
I truly think Bradley a African American hater
It is time to put respect on Haney's name. To do it twice in Australia is commendable while his contemporaries are on twitter doing their fighting and avoiding the ring like a plague
Haney luck of power,if kambosos let hand here go start 1 round.i think he won
Great performance, but I still think he needed the KO.
That boy kambosos need to find another apponent. He ain't no match for devin haney. Congrats champ 🥊
El nuevo negrito correton
Damn Devin Haney beat the brakes off this guy.
Allahumdillah
Kambosos did make improvements but it just wasn’t enough. Haney just in another class.
*dominant
Haney just too good. But he is not unbeatable
I didnt even know about this
The black guy run at end lmao
Kambosos looked stiff af
He beat the break off kambosas he didn’t knock him out but def broke him
CLEAN FOCUSED CONVINCING👌👌 Missing power&showmanship  CONGRATS CHAMP🤴🏾 ARE YOU READY FOR LOMA???
at only 23 years old Devin haney is the only boxer that can deal with any style you throw at him. hes not the fastest or the most powerful, but he's gets all As across the board from his timing, adjusting, footwork, ability to counter, distance control, fighting inside, clinch control, and the way he avoids body shots and fires back with a job blows my mind. he's could be a legend
Haney is tough, that's a bad boy 💪💪💪
Feels like Haney is tryna be like shakur demeanor wise, from the cursing during face off to the ignoring opponents right after end of 12th round. Shakur still beats him tho
Отбегал негр как обычно
Kambosos tried to bring a different look so I can appreciate that but Haney is just levels above him in terms of skill. I don't think Kambosos should retire tho
David Haney Boring boxing ,  Manny Pacquiao da best boxing
Highlights are not the way to look at a fight. If you've seen the whole fight and then look at what someone has posted as highlights that's fine but to look at the highlights and retell the fight based on them you're not going to give an accurate depiction.
Haney beat him worst the second fight lol should have never been a second fight
Devin Haney will be the next Floyd Mayweather. His style and defense might be boring but is on point. Perfect execution of hit and not get hit
Haney spent the last 10 seconds of the fight running kinda reflect his personality.
Haney Vs Stevenson would be a boxing purest dream fight! High IQ & cat like reflexes. Got Toney Vs McCallum vibes written all over it
Lmaoooooo Top Rank really made the highlights look competitive. when you actually watched the fight, Devin dominated for 12 rounds. Congrats Dev.
Haney vs lomachinco thats good fight if happens
And STILL
This was actually a great fight. They actually threw punches. Salute to both fighters.  Great job!💪🏿
The clinch count on Haney was a lame move by the network insinuating it's how Haney won the first fight. They consciously ignored how Kambosos fights as if he doesn't charge straight in head down with no finesse causing a clash which 90% ends in a unprovoked clinch by Haney.
blocked all those punches with his face
Not ready for the real man MIKE TYSON VOICE 🤣
Much better fight than than the Wilder slaughter…
This fight was just more of Haney ain’t no doubt about Haney now that’s out of the way it’s on to bigger fights good win
Kambosos too small for Haney.
If Devin ever unlocks his power he’s unstoppable, he could easily land but nothing hard enough.
Where are the typical  suspect races talking trash about this guy now?
*Dominant*  I can't believe how many people struggle with this.
Kambosos cant win with home advantage twice... He should find easier opponents, haney out of his league
GERVONTA VS DEVIN
Haney vs Lopez Go.
Kambosos no slouch,  but the other guy is just one of the best in boxing.
Haney backed up kambosos that's real champion congrats 👏👏
Haney what a fighter
What a smooth win, DH.👍🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊. lol lol lol.  He's a great champion.🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲. FREE artist: FAT PAT.
Is Haney great boxer?? Bla..bla..bla..??? NO..!! he just another BORR Maywheather wanna be 😴😴🥱🥱
Devin could have stopped George but choose not 2 deffently.....
Be smart kambosos, chase teofilo and be champ one more time, he is a piece of cake for you!!!
Nabs
Devin "Hugs" Haney. 2 piece then a hug. 🤦🏾‍♂️ But that right was snappin his head back all night too. Devin not doin shit in 140 with that.
If Devin would have went to the body he would have got the knock out
amazing fight both fought to a bloody end
Haney too great 🧐
I walk the line Johnny cash dedicated to Devin Haney https://youtu.be/J-6fW66IUY4
THAT CHANGE OF WEIGHT AND FIGTH VERSUS TEOFILO AGAIN, SURE WIN AND IN CHAMP ONE MORE TIME, DO IT KAMBOSOS!!!!
Like I said.. another win for Haney kamboses should have dodged him like everyone else is so he could have e joked his reign a bit more.. tank stop dodging Haney he's the real deal
If Kambosos decides to quit boxing, he may have a bright future in break dancing.
Lomachenko 👊👊👊👊
Lomachenko 👊👊👊👊👊
Lomachenko 👊👊👊👊
Kambosos tried to fight a dirty fight. Lots of head butts. Ref didn't say anything. But in the end it didn't matter. Haney beat that boy like he owned him money.
Tank will beat both of these guys
Nomaschenko esta listo! C'mon Hi Tech
Great fight. Haney was faster and stronger. He looks about a weight class bigger, too. Weren't all US fighters ducking Haney? Maybe Kambosos deserves respect for fighting Haney at all. I'd like to see more restrictions on that grabbing and locking the arm technique MW Jr. used, too, and a lot less pushing down on the backs of fighters or rabbit punching in the clinch. That could hurt an elbow and seems illegal. Clinch arm and turn?
*dominant please
Who is paying the announcer that never gives Devin Haney any credit for his punches?
Lomachenko vs haney next fight. Haney k.o in 10 round. Lomachenko the best fighter👍👍👍👍
Haney  winning is awesome, his boxing career is going to be something very special and for kambosos you got to give it to him, he fought Devon Haney right away and he took some big shots and still stood there. But Haney is just on another level right now and will only get better, with his skill he could easily go down pound for pound as one of the best boxers in are history. He still has work to do.
Devin Haney is so sloppy.. call a spade a spade.  At least he has speed and timing
Said it Devin was gonna lay an ass whoopin on that boy. Took George to class and George flunked out.
Kambo looked like the local crackhead 😂😂
No head movement from kambo. Easy target for haney.
*ALL HAIL KING HANEY!!!!* TOLD YA’LL HE’D DOMINATE AGAIN!!! KAMBOZO BEAT DOWN!!! WE RUN AUSTRALIA!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸. Bye Haters!!!
Great win by Devin but he will loose to  tank. He has no power only movement
Janet’s good but I’ll never stay up to watch him fight I’ll wait for the YouTube highlights boring
I watched the fight without commentary as I usually do, now watching these highlights the one announcer was biased AF towards Kambosos! Haney would put together a combination and there's almost silence, then George had one good punch and he was all energetic, FUCK HIM!!
Better by Kambosos but Haney is just too good.  That 1-2 combo is the cleanest thing in boxing or any other sport.
devin has skills just no power or chin.. gervonta davis and ryan would knock him out
You KNOW you’re good when someone with a good fight eye laughs at how slick you are
Who's got pillowhands now?! He busted Kambosos up bad!
Davin looking just like his daddy in the ring
Kambosos is a journeyman who got very lucky against Lopez….
Haney is clearly one of the most if not the most skillful boxers full stop , he's not massively exciting but by God that jab is like a piston , I don't think anyone gets close to beating him at lightweight
Different level.. the brother a smart fighter .. smashed him
I would love to see haney a teo that would be a good fight
Highlights seems one sided. If fight was like that fr why let the man get battered
Haney's good but jesus christ if I was going to watch this fight I'd fall asleep again.
Ok now we gotta see Haney vs Shakur (winner gets loma), Kambosos vs Pitbull, Tank vs Garcia
Lack of pressure and volume punches for george thats why he lost...  anyways, still a great former champ.
George has nothing for Devin
Anytime I see Haney fight. I always remember TBE. #FLOYDMAYWEATHER
Sick and tired of the culturally biased commentary from Andre and Tim...
Switching stance of kambosos is effective only in early rounds
Yeah, Ferocious took more punishment this fight, compared to the first one. Devin being Devin.
I took a L last night at my fight, good job Haney 👏
I love the fight blow by bloe
Радий за Хейні!
The results were expected. Haney dictated and controlled the pace, distance, and clinching game. I was expecting Haney to do more damage, but credit to Kambosos, he is tough. Kambosos did what he must, be more aggressive and try to close the distance, try to get inside and throw uppercuts or attack the body. He could not do it effectively though for lack of skill, speed, and footwork. He was taking multiple shots just to land one. That might work if he has serious knock out power in both hands.
To the mfs that said Haney don’t got a chin??? What y’all got to say now?
Was this a shitty boxing march again
Boxing weird as hell now. You have to many boxers in the same weight class  saying they're the best. They must fight like back in the day. Just talk talk talk
You white dudes need to step down and be quiet ..if you’re not gonna give credit to Haney for beating this BOY twice then you should remain silent ..kam had two times to show us Haney is overrated and a bum.Some of you will give any excuse to fuel your racial pride…Haney displayed levels …congratulations
That dam boxing kangaroo kambozo can't punch very laughable
Haney still get his gloves custom made by the *My Pillow guy I see
Kambosas said in his first press conference that if loses this rematch he was going to retire. Well, he lost.
Wait until he fights PIT BULL Cruz there is not body that can’t beat Cruz . Haney  or Davis No body Cruz will own the belts by 2024
Wow, Haney actually fought like a man for a change? Ok.
Haney is a boring fighter
Better fight than the first. Haney is going to be a hard man to beat by anyone. Hope Kambosos can accept his loss and read the art of war one more time before next fight. 😅
I see weakness on Kambosos fighting style. He's just relying in his solid right cross. No lateral movements and an easy target for Haney.
Good fight by both gentlemen, but wow Haney really fucked him up towards the end. Woww congrats champ 👏🏽. Now I gotta see Haney vs Stevenson or Davis! A big name 🙏🏽
Haney looked like a welterweight in there. Too big and strong. Fast too
Devin Haney has no power
Damn, Haney, did kambosos kill your dog.  “Devin wick Haney”
TANK!!!
Damn Haney 🥊beat KAMBOSOS BLOODY!✌️
Devin was looking mean before the fight I thought he'd actually have some pop in his punch this time but.... 🤷🏾‍♂️
Haney tuff
Devin "the Dream" Haney humbled Skambosos
Never thought a rematch was needed here. I never knew this fight was even happening. The best need to fight the best this guy was outclassed the 1st time smh. dumb fight
I see a young Mayweather on Haney good working
KAMBOSIS WAS LOOKING LIKE A " BOBBLEHEAD "
I wonder who thought Kambosas was gonna win
This kid is NOT great. He’s beating easy non dangerous fighters. He’s nothing compared to Tank Davis
Kamboso defense was great this fight. His jaw stopped all of those left jabs.
GK just doesn’t have the skill set or power to beat Haney. Good win for the champ. But! I think he loses to Loma
Pelea dura. Una pelea por un título como dios manda, al más puro estilo de los 89/90
Champ Haney 👏🏽👌🏽👊🏽💯🔥
Daven Haney like may wayther .not exciting so tired.
الحمد لله ☝️
Haney looks a division or two bigger!
Haney is a great boxer but he seems not to have the finish instinct that you see in Shakur or tank.
Devin right hand was landing all day, horrible defense of George
Haney was just beating the hell out of him, beat him with timing and accuracy Kam couldn’t get away from that jab and right hand, Devin was just too good.
The emperor will return.
Unbelievable to fight like that for 12 rounds. What an amazing fight. Props to both fighters, I don't understand how kambosos took all those shots, lmao.
Top Rank or Top Racist commentary.
ABSOLUTE ZERO DOG IN HANEY 😂😂😂😂😂
Devin's gots speed and skills but no power and likes to hold to to much . NOW for L Chenko , Ryan, T. LOPEZ,  Devin  needs to gain wait or something cause as many punches Devin threw, fight should of been over early.  I ain't going to lie I was falling asleep . Now for Caleb Plant and Wilder that was amazing boxing
TWO TRASH FIGHTERS CMON I WANT A SEE A REAL FIGHT!
Haney fans so stupid lol. Like if he can beat Cambosos, than he's a unbeatable)) lol
I love how certain people here refuse to give Kambosas any credit, but cry racism the moment someone doesn’t praise Haney. The true racists don’t see they’re the problems.
mma is better
We did not need a second fight 🤦
I thought Haney was gonna lose this one was wrong Haney is getting better
Haney vs Pitbull 💪💪
All you tank fans come on yo get it
Haney listens to his father and that’s why he is deadly boxer great for USA but kambosa is a warrior and exposed Haney some times but great fight. I don’t know why people go to the body with Haney it doesn’t work with him he just picks you apart when you try and hit his body.. only style I can see beating him is a PAC man style that is very quick in and out… maybe Loma would be a good fight..
Haney boxing skills are off the charts, Lack of power may be an issue with top opponents
Combination on point 😎
Haney is tops by a mile.
Hugging and Running.. i thought mayweather already retired..
Man I’m a say it, Kambosos did all this jumping around but boxing wise man he had no business beating Tio.
Kambosos took sum hard shots I would threw in the towel
Bigger faster and also the better boxer there wasn't much kambosos could do to beat him
He’s amazing ماشاءالله 👍
the best top rank highlights of all time
Kambosos was 🗑
Ksmbosos you went in there and fought him I salute you
Clean shots, respect to both warriors.
It's high time Devin starts fighting dirty... I mean this Olympic style of war would soon be cracked. Kambosos is overated and Teo just had a bad day in office. Now it's high time someone tell Devin the truth about what awaits him next!
Haney gets hit too much... he'll eventually lose
Alhamdulliah Haney my boy
This is the way it should be when a competitive first fight" rematch" Cruz vs Davis should be mandatory.
Mark my Words Haney is gonna becomme a Legend he fights so smart love to c That  & nothing but Respect for Kambosos he is great also too he just lost by a better Men no shame for that
Devin Haney is just so superior. They are clearly not the same levels. George showed heart by fighting this guy 2ce. He knew this was an impossible task before the 1st fight.
This fight was below average good win but nothing stuck out.
My Muslim brother is like fighting a junkie homeless drugs addicted clown 🤡  Bless my Muslim brother true champ.....
So a decision.
Useless
I see kambozo got his fighting style for this fight from Jim Carrey in the movie Me Myself and Irene
nuncaaaa pudoooo sobrepasar el alcanse de haneyyyy eso fue claveeee y mas pegada tambienn haney. mas fuerte
El Pitbull oh Lomachenko son los que le pueden quitar los cinturones a haney
devin is next Mayweather
Haney all spent in the 12th round running scared..
If there is a really slick counterpuncher in the division, Haney has a tell. If timed right he could be caught.
Haney vs Tank!!!!!
And he takes off that wbc hat .....My dude 👍👍👍
sky sports your a joke i wanted to pay for this but couldnt find for weeks, and you say its ppv box office in uk. It wasnt, i will delete sky and im glad i didnt pay them.  HOW DID PEOPLE FROM UK WATCH THIS THANKS
Devin is the man at 135, but he better stay away from Tank because he has no power to keep tank off him. Devin also will need more practice going to the body. Good fight.
Email champion my ass he beat that dude on his own porch
Haney beats teo and loma. Period
This announcer must be a hater. Be specific, he’s the “UNDISPUTED” lightweight champion of the world !!!
Both garbage
I had croissants for breakfast today
Should be Devin "pillow hands" Haney
He whipped him
Kambosos got lucky once against a guy who would kill him in a rematch. Guy deserves to be at the bottom of the barrel..
Devin the boring Haney 🤣
Haney is "the future* and a "prodigy" by beating kambosos? Tell me FANGIRLS, who is Haney's best win?
Devin Heney was way more aggressive in the 2nd fight for sure.
Alright, now give the undisputed fight to the one that hunt all those belts down. Loma would take Haney to clap city!
People can say what they want about Haney but he’s a sound fighter he can box frfr
the gap in skills and speed, and height/reach to a lesser extent, imo,  is too wide between these two to be a competitive fight.  I still think Haney is keeping the belts warm for someone else.
Hey Top Rank, Loma vs Haney to open the new year?
Haney is proving to be the best of these young guys.
The people's champ, the undisputed, the Dream ❤️ May Allah assisst you in all of your life's challenges and matches 🤲
I like Devin but he need work on his power and work in the inside game
Haney vs Loma nxt pls
Haney's overrated! Kambosos is a very limited pugilist and still went the distance.
Not ever paying money to see Haney fight ............to boring .
Because Kambosos is a flat footed and can’t quickly come close to Haney. But Kambosos exposed the weakness of Haney and Loma will take it as advantage.
LOMA № 1
Devin looked so God damn good the 10th round
Haney V Loma  Shakur Stevenson V Pitbull Cruz 👿 Winner fights the winner for the 135 👑
Pure boxing skills man... Technical/Outboxers are the purest tbh..
Last night was a W for Boxing
Yeah I need to start telling the truth his fights are boring
I tank stopping haney inside them exchanges
He ain't got power Like I thought he did Boi should of got knocked out
Haney has never been in a real fight. Always slipping from fighting Tank. Even Loma will expose him.
DH is a good boxer. I hope he stays in the lightweight division. Good young man as well.
Mane DH taking thus rematch not slick to me. Bruh you could fight Lemo , Tank , Ryan plenty more folks  you wanna take the easy fight
He asked for more action lmao that didn't work out for him at home 👀
Kambosas got robbed
BEAT THAT AZZ!!!
The art of war kambosa
Kambosos Vs Liam Paro 🔥
Haney needs more power if he wanna beat tank by KO
I would love to see Kambosos become champion once again after these guys move up to 140
Not impressed
Why theses white ppl be looking like androids 👀
Eat their hearts
Even the title makes no sense. Top Rank is a joke
Skills pay the bills
Kamboses got away with 20 million dollars so i wouldnt consider this an L for him
Don't looks like he really won.
Kambosas shouldn't be fighting elite fighter anymore. Dude sorry
This was a high quality fight. Totally different to first one. Both fighters made adjustments. Haney won outright but kambosos had his moments. Haney’s reflexes are out of this world. Kambosos earned the respect.
Respect, room for growth.
This performance I doubt Haney beats loma
Haney VS Shakur Please now now
Handy beat dat boy to sleep... I love seeing a Racist getting his azz tore out the frame ‼️😂
Man Haney beat the brakes off Kambosos.
ahki Devin Haney went from being a boxer to a fighter!!!!!
Alhamdulillah,congrat for haney
Haney esta a otro nivel kambosos no tiene nada que buscar con el si haney pegara mas fuerte lo podia hasta noquear 👍🇵🇷
Welp his career is done
Kambosos was never in his league to begin with
Boring fight
Congratulations to Sir David Haney but Shakur is more talented for me than Haney in boxing After Haney Vs Loma,it Shakur should be next😅
Devin beat him hands down what a performance, Devin is getting great after each fight
BORING 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😵‍💫🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴🥴
Sent that lil goofy boy to the desert no.mas 🏜 lol
Got his ass beat again  😏  Money Team 💰
Devin haney coward😂😂😂
this was just another day in 'practice' for devin and he sent george back to australia to practice amongst the two legged kangeroos....lol..🤣
Champ 🏆
Alhamdulillah Allahuakbar ❤️
Cruz is his kryptonite mark my words
They called him the unified instead of undisputed SMFH
Haney vs Ryan Garcia Next!
If devin didn’t gas out in the 10th round he would have stopped kambosos
Another boring fight 😴
Devin just started walking his ass down smfh
Allhamdulliah victory devin haney
George fought like a mad man, but David is just on a level of his own atm. Great fight!
Kambosos is just garbage as fuck
Haney looks great
I’m telling you right now shakur will wash devin ass I see way to much holes that shakur will exploit at will
"dominating performance" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who's that Haney. Soft boxer!
Who's that Haney. Soft boxer!
Wow Haney was on another level. Kambosos is a tough ombre though. Credit to him for not backing down tough fights
Right now the best division in boxing.
Now i want shakur next. I think shakur will defeat him. It is going to be a great pillow fight
the world fed up doping boxer
D Haney a good Fighter....... He gotta.get better D Fence tho
Haney is him
announcers were so lame. they were all for kambosas.  every shot was super exciting but for Haney who smoked him would get like boos from the announcer..
boxer make doping champion..lol.
Feel bad for George. Wish his team had managed him better after the first fight. I understand activating a rematch clause after a close or controversial fight but to go into this particular rematch after a 12 round shutout last time….he was never going to win this. And now he has went from being world champion to 0-2 since winning against Teo. Unfortunate and hopefully he can make a good comeback from this. As for Devin… what a fighter! One of the best out there right now. Super!
stop spoiling the outcome in the title! (there are people from different tiemszones who havent seen the fight yet and see all these title when they go online)
Haney has no power but that speed and accuracy make up for it.   Excelente trabajo warriors.  🇦🇬✊🏾🇵🇷
It's 'dominant', not 'dominate'.
We want to see Loma vs Haney. Let's  do it...
Boring
If kambosos controlled the ring he could've slept Haney call me crazy he had solid counters that connected beautifully and he actually adjusted very well. Haney's was just to quick and got in his head early
All that talk about he made changes..lmfao you looked more pathetic than the first time...140 is weaker George..go up to that weight...135 to much skill for your sorry subpar boxing skill ass kid 😂
Devin did it again lets go
Wonder what kambosos next excuse will be when trys for the third rematch 🤣
Lakas talaga ni haney congrats
All these belts going about is a fucking joke, some of them need to be dissolved, then we can see who are real champions instead of all these guys running their mouth sayin they the best. Boxing is a joke. The best don’t fight the best. A lot of shit talking
Beat da dog shit out of him
Devin "pillow hands" haney,boring,basic, easy to see why people don't really like him
Haney was beating his ass😂😂😂
Devin getting bigger he's going to be a problem
Kambosos wasn't ready for the dream, haney wake him up!
Not sure the Philly shell guard works for Kambosos.
Kambpzs@sos is a doggg
The Dream delivered a nightmare to GKJ. Great fight Devin. Now let's see him in there with SS.
great fight , kambosos did well but was out boxed
Devin looked worse in this fight. Devin was punching over his feet, off balance and didn't stay in the pocket qhen throwing. This version of Devin couldn't beat Tank, or Stevenson or Ryan.
Haney is a BOAT #BoredfighterOfAllTime
Devin Haney you the man Brother 💪🏿✊🏿
This Bum , Kambosos did not bring anything new to the table..still the same old style..All the talk is over
Lotta clinching but still a ass whooping😂
Devin is money Mayweather Jr I like these highlights
Pablo Picasso
He still got the FloydBlood
David haney is boring fighter, haney and Mayweather is the same
Dirty and technical  devin is going to beat tank and garcia
Devin is artist good boxing
I don't like what I saw out of Haney! First his legs, he use to be more springy rock like Roy Jones didn't see it this fight, he was more fluid shoulder roll slip game, he head hunted the whole night, now he's turning into the basic boxer!! So boo on his performance even though it's a clean win!
These comentators don’t give kambosos the praise he deserves. He fought a great fight it’s lovely to watch him. Haney is the true champ! Let him go up in weight
I think kambosos is exactly correct devin will move up immediately big 23 years old devin
What a bore fest
He make Australian boxers look like shit
*Dominant
Was another great fight !! Wow we got a lot talented young fighters coming up !!
Haney was trying to knock him out ....awesome boxing great fight better then the first one Haney is young making his way up
That boy going run into a lot of trouble at 140 oh and he better stay away from Tank and Shakur
Haney is just a terrible style matchup for Kambosos. Everything he does well Haney does better.
Wow So proud of him
If Devin ever fight like that with Tank, he definitely going to sleep
I thinking of standing k.o,great fight for the same prime fighter's.
The best all ways beats shit
Yeah none of them is standing toe to toe with tank lol
The first fight was close. This fight was an ass whooping
I love guys like boso that b extra tough for no reason then get they a* whooped.
Devin looked like he went to a Wedding not a fight .. the dude is SO DAMN GOOD… absolutely astonishing- great footwork.. needs to work on his uppercut otherwise he’s my fav fighter the kids a STALLION
Sensacional sensational.
Is there a black person in every sport holding 5-6 belt male and female? This needs to be documented!!! It's probably been 100-150 yrs.
Boring fight..
…and Kambosos head-wound patch ended up on Devin Haney’s head?😂
DOMINANT performance, how does a 1.8 million subscriber page not have a literate proof reader?
Bozo lucky that his head didn’t come off. Great performance by Haney.
Just two of the best guys going at it.
Kam definitely  know he can't beat  Haney the fare way with all the sneak hits and holding.
Neither fighter isnt as good  as I thought they were.
Absolutely beautiful balanced and intelligent boxer...Haney
Tankmouth don't want any of that smoke!!! Once again, The Dream beat the man, who beat the man, who beat the man! Tankmouth beat Romero! LOL!
CONGRATS HANEY, AND RESPECT KAMBOSOS. SHOUT OUT TO OUR AUSSIES OUT THERE FROM THE U.S. 🇺🇲👍✌️GOOD LUCK BOTH CAREERS!
And u think u can beat tank? 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good win but Tank and shakur g fuck yo devin up 😂😂
Haney vs pitbull, vs tank, vs Garcia, vs lomachenko, vs Shakur Stevenson
George just does nothing want to put his hands up 🤦‍♂️.. he should have brought manny in for a sparring partners😅
Too strong too fast too accurate..
Dominant
Haney is too quick for Kambosos
Yes kambosis was outboxed but Haney and the holding was just diabolical at times. Well done Haney but stop the holding man it ain’t right and it really discredits you at times.
David outbox kambosos
Boast commentary for kamboses.
People say haney don’t have one punch knock out power but I feel like he could def knock someone out.. either way he boxes really smart.. but Everytime he takes a body shot It looks like he gets hurt.. but he does remind me of mayweather a lot but I haven’t seen him execute the shoulder roll like mayweather did.. def reminiscent of a young Floyd tho imo.
someone taught top rank how to make highlights finally
I don’t understand why kembosis chose the range fight why he didn’t get into the in fights and stay there Haney footwork and jab he can’t match and yet he goes inside with a roll or a slip didn’t exploit the opportunity but just went back to the long range fighting distance he should’ve stayed inside Haney work the body to set up the head and slow down his superior footwork
man said Kambosos had a punchers chance.. haha.. the disrespect.. a punchers chance is a polite way say your trash.. not worth 1 quarter in Mexican/African money ,and we all know both CONTINENTS DON'T make those..sheesh..😁😁
Haney is so disciplined, he will not rush in for the kill no matter what.
Gervonta knocks Haney out cold!!!
Back to back , good job by Haney
Next match : Ryan Garcia vs Devin hanya 🔥
Like to see Haney fight teofimo! Don't see Haney lasting more than 8 rounds with teofimo
Devin Haney looks like he is going into his Man weight or what ever is called. He’s going to be great as he moves up
haney came out and show him why he shouldn’t never put that rematch on the contract
That was a lot of pointless stance changing
Ryan and tank both ko Haney
A much better performance this time, came to do damage and did just that  Now fight loma, easy fight to make
I'm trying to figure out why they called him unified when he's undisputed. Give the Man his just dues and respect already
Black Americans run everything we touch
Kamb  got schooled!!!!
Devin that was amazing boxing coming from a Tank fan.
Devin haney has no power and is very jittery...
Barely noticed how basic Kambasos footwork is
Haney kicked that boys ass
Devin dad get on ma nervous fr
Loma watching and laughing hahahhahah
When are yall gonna realize haney is too big for this division, I'm not taking nuffin from his skills but he needs to move up and start fighting better competition 🤔
Loma will stop Haney, no other fo this moment
Much better from Haney but how good is Kambosos he got a lucky ticket on Teos worst night like any Ruiz agaist AJ but fair play the Haney good win
Masallah to the Brother Haney he makes a great Job ❤
هاني قال (الحمد لله)
I don't know why Hayne didn't finish him on round 10. Great performance by the undisputed Champ.
ElhamduliAllah 💪
My grandma spanks harder than both of these clowns
Congrats Devon nuff love from The UK
What a world champion should be he will go anywhere in the world it dont matter to him a world champion travels the world and dominates class act by haney
Great fight from both men!! 👏
Haney will get chewed up when he moves up in weight. He’s a big lightweight with no power
Dominant**
Only American fighter I'd support vs a brittish one he's absolute class can take hits and has brilliant skills he's quality 👌
This fight was way better than the first  fight
細川バレンタインの動画観てる人いますか？
Haney vs Stevenson
kamboso style is shit
Haney best running man🤣🤣like regondox
Nice way to spoil the content with the title.
i know devin is fast, but george looked slower this time around.
Great work 🏆
Such a pointless rematch, but atleast Haney can move on now
But no knockout...No...you the best in the world.
Lamb is as is a quality fighter but Heaney is different gravy. Hope he faces the other big names in the division soon
The ref looks like a korean elon musk bruh 😂😂💀💀💀
Told y’all KamBOZO was overrated 🤣 I can KO that bum myself! Great job Haney!
Good night, good fight, poor ref lol
Only fucking 12k views are you serious  Mfers really be trying to play devin. He is a boxer I can’t wait until he start catching more knockouts  Knockouts catch eyes and fill seats It’s weird Af people would want to pay crazy amounts to attend or watch a 2 round fight  Instead of being able to watch rounds of great boxing
Now drop your nuts and fight Davis now
Haney ups his overall punch output by an abysmal 5-10% and he’ll be stopping most people he fights
Beat the sleeves out kambosos….
Not a dominance, but whatever
Haney with the master class!
Top rank should do wilder & plant highlights because PBC fox had horrible highlights smh!!
Kam couldn’t keep his hands up for shit.
Top Elite American Counter attact is the Krypton for Pac man fighting style.. Mayweather beat Pac man, and Kombosos spar so many rounds with Pac man and got schooled by American Top Elite Counter Puncher aka Mayweather Fighting Style..
Just not interested in all the 🗣🗣🗣about tank and Ryan any more.Look at what fighters have DONE.Look what undisputed Devin has DONE.Devin ,teo ,Loma,kambosas they’ve all been in the mix with each other and they’ve all fought quality.
What a performance by Haney! Wow!!!  Great job well done! Congrats Haney!!!👍
dari segi tehknik dan stamina unggul  haney...
Boxing clinic by the youngest undisputed and undefeated fighter - Devon “The Dream” Haney🥊👊🏿
Haney got hit a lot. His biggest flaw is not being able to handle pressure volume punching. Loma will exploit that
Devin Haney can box. He just no power.
Lot of clinching boring.
The ending mc said unified?? Wtf he is undisputed
Sorry bosos
Some of those hits he took tonight he not gone be able to take a hit like that vs a tank if he try to prove he can fight with tank he better stay on that outside and use that jab all night long and keep that distance
Certified
George fought a horrible fight but if he managed to get a cut and make Haney bleed from his mouth and mind you George was scared to throw …. Please tell me what you think gervonta Davis will do ?
After watching this fight I first thought devin Haney was the best but I see some flaws good fun and dominate win vs a opponent he should dominate but I don’t think he gone be Able to out box nor fight better on the inside than shakur but it’s very close though
Unified?
ITS ALL AMAZING HOW HANEY,TANK,CHARLO AND ANDRE NOT P4P LIST YET MINOR INOU IS NOW RANKED #1 😂😂😂😂 WAT CRITIREA DO THEY FOLLOW. EVEN BUD &TRUTH IS NOLONGER #1 😂 IMAOO
Looks like a different fight..... yeah right, same results
You mean 'dominant,' not 'dominate.' Fire the immigrant and get an English speaker uploading the videos pronto.
I hope Kambosos cashout this 2 fights good, cause thats hist last prime moment in career.
King of 135 devin haney
10 - 2 for haney at worst, for many people point of View might be 11-1.. Lets be generous for Kombosos let it be 10 -2 or 9 - 3.. Haney beat him more than first fight..
Loma vs haney Garcia vs tank
the announcer said unifed?undisputed goofy! don't know undisputed and unified are two different illusions like teo 😂
this time Haney deserves some respect👍
Haney vs Tank Davis..
Let me guess these people under paid Devin 🤣
kombosos vs teofimo better x10000 to this shit 😑
The one basic one two combo doing the heavy lifting
why Kambosos 2, why haney dosen't fight 28-0 lemos?
So is Haney gonna fight Tank, Loma, Lopez, and Garcia or are they all just gonna call each other out for social media clicks
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 wheres the shrimp on the barbie mate !??
I'm still not convinced by The Dream. I think Loma and Tank school him. Haney just isn't elite.
Does this mean kambosas is going to retire like he said he would?
Congratulations to both fighters Excellent win By Haney.
Phenomenal performance.
Haney got pillows for hands man, needs to work on his power punches dude would be unstoppable
Dont why he said and still unified when he ment to be undisputed
Thing about haney is he has a mature head for a young guy, he knows maybe he don't have the power so just keeps racking up the points.... Boxing 101
They tried putting the wbc hat on Devin after the win 😂 took it right off
Dominant tho innit.
They look so small😂
You will all say that you hate these pretty black fighters. Lace them up then. Get in the ring for more than a couple of rounds. Being smart will seem like a good idea
Haney no power, but outboxes kambosos, when Haney gets hit he is always clinching
If Haney had more power I could've seen Kambosos going down several times in this fight.
Lol
what if haney vs davia or garcia..haney is a hoax champion.
Why you putting the result in the title??  Thtat's messed up
Haney looks to big 🤣
Boring azz fight no doubt about it
They can't compete with us
Devin Haney vs Teofimo Lopez
why he didn't knock it out..
Devin sooooo uncomfortable throwing combos. I wonder why he’s so scared to throw the 123 right after one another. He throws a 12 and hold, the the hook. He fights like he ain’t got a lick of power in him
A Haney hay que robarle la bicicleta antes de la pelea
😳✊In the fight there is always theft as always!!! always corruption!!! ROBBERY again!!! Gamboso WON the first and the second!!! Haney lost twice🐀🐀!!!. JUSTICE!!! no more corruption!!!. punish corrupt judges🐀🐀!!!.
Simply the best !!! Loved watching DH these past few years now get back to matchroom and DAZN and get that dollar 💵
You deserve it waynto go champ
Different class and huge effort coming to Australia twice and winning easily on both occasions.
amazing fight
Kambosos lost that title so quick lmao 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Its time for Haney vs Loma next !!!
If you can't give respect to Haney than you are not a real boxing fan.
Is it me or does Devin look way bigger than Kambosos? Haney will need to move up eventually cuts so much staying at 35.
Is it me or does Devin look way bigger than Kambosos? Haney will need to move up eventually cuts so much staying at 35.
Shield, Haney, Wilder. This Americans just keep winning u can't help but love them, they are born to win.
Damn I guess kambosas silent treatment didn’t really work 😅
Glad Devin won this sequel against Kambosos. However, if he fights Tank, Devin has nothing to keep Tank off of him and Tank will destroy him before the 6th round. Team Tank!
pacquiao kid vs mayweather kid
Haney is a great boxer, great defense, offense, fast combinations but lacks power big time. The commentators comparing him to pretty boy Floyd I get it because of his speed and accuracy but floyd was whooping ass in his younger days stopping fighters. Haney just doesn’t seem to be able to drop and stop these guys when they’re there for the taking.
Booooo 🍅, of course you'd win fighting against that trash, duh 🙄
25 clinched in just round 6 wtf mayweather
Loma stops Haney after this performance
Love to see Elon Musk as a referee
Belts everywhere...which division is this one again...?
Kambosos is a disgrace for losing two flights
Haney did his job, but still have more questions than answers. Obviously Kambosos is not elite lightweight. He is nowhere close to Garcia, Davis, Lomachenko
Honestly devin fight are fukking boring.
La verdad haney no tiene pegada de otra manera sale en camilla el australiano
George hits better this fight and also got hit worst than last time. Congrats to Devin “35 million clinch per fight”Haney.
We need to see haney loma next 👊🏿
Thanks for uploading highlights for once, top rank
They can not beat loma in this div!
Clear win
Anyone of em fight loma it b a drop!
After this fight the lightWeight ranking should be...  1-haney 2 Davis 3 loma 4 issac Cruz 5 Kamo
Pitbull Will stop devin haney ,u guys Will see
meh. Boring fight tbh. So disrespectful to call this kid the next Mayweather because he doesn't have the same sting to his shots. Shakur is the closest to him, but still not nearly as good.
Issac pitbull cruz will beat devin haney
Piece of crop! Fight loma!
Congrats to Devin, Fair play to George he never stopped trying. Don't give up mate
King Haney
Do he have any kos
Shakur or loam next. Let Ryan and tank play hanky panky with each other
if loma beats Jamaine Ortiz then Loma vs Haney title Fight or Loma could go after Lopez and then fight haney either way it be great. But i think Loma vs haney and then lopez..
This just proves Kambosos got lucky when he "beat" Teo
It's the time of pitbull if you wanna be great.
Kamboses go PAY your coach 😭😭😭😭😭
Kambosas beat teofimo cuz he underestimated him & got too cocky in all reality he’s no where near as talented as Haney , Tank , Ryan Garcia  or teofimo
Wish Kam came in with a different game plan. Devin is a great fighter and you'll need a REAL plan if you're someone like George fighting up to that calibre. Good fight
Haney reminds me of Floyd in this fight, what a performance. I wanna see Haney v Tank
Boring Fighters
Hood boy is good still love GK though
Impeccable display of dominance! Haney put on a clinic tonight against Kambosos
nice, they had Elon Musk  as the referee
Kambossos management should be embarrassed they took this rematch
My respect for both Fighters it was a hell of a fight much respect that's the kind of fight we looking for Never Back Down shout out to Mexico shout out to family Rodriguez we love boxing shout out to everybody loves boxing my respect Viva México cabrones 🇲🇽😎🇲🇽
Haney a good fighter but he has a long way to go before he think he can fuck with Tank. Tank Davis a rare breed
Haney is making Australia his second home lol.😂
Hahahahahha nanalo nga boring ka haney...walang gana panoorin..
Although Haney is very talented, my fav fighter is still Tank. I hope he starts taking the big name fights soon. If he can KO the likes of Haney, Loma, or even IG superstar Garcia. Come on Tank make them happen 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥
I dislike that he took off the 12th round but great fight
Put them paws on Bozo. #DreamTeam 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸💪🏿💪🏿💪🏿🫡
He beat the brakes of Kambosos.
Took him to school, once again. 🙏💪🏼💯
Kambosos is not ferocious against the American.
Even with better highlights, no interest could be generated. Lmao
Even with better highlights, no interest could be generated. Lmao
Kam needs to work on his defense… He stopped too many punches with his head… Stop looking for the 1-punch knockout… Punch the body and the head will follow…
I think my Gran has more power than Haney. Even now - at 96 sat in a care home.
Alhamdulillah,,Allahuakbar,,!!!!
LORD HANEY THE KING OF LIGHTWEIGHTS 🌎💯💰🇺🇸💧🥊
Kambosos losser😅😢😂
Haney punches Kambosas in the face 10 times … ESPN: “ohhhh nice shot from Kambosas!!”…….😅
Haney just got that class
Kambosas is a beast
The Dream is for real. Against a fighter like him I'd keep the jab going no matter what. What else could've he done?
Tremendous fight by Devin Haney, he outbox kambosos twice in Australia and got the Win
Kambosos a great fighter but styles make fights he'll never beat Devin
Kambosas is a taxi driver
Alhamdulliah Bro Haney shows his skills
Haney is a gay
Who hired the fucking ridiculous Chinese referee 🤦🏻‍♂️
Haney is good. Timing near to perfect, power and gas tank on the high level as well. Loma vs Haney 60\40. Haney have good chances to win 40% is big possibility.
Shakur walk Haney down easily for the dub.
Kamboses should have went to the body more cause haney did look drained at the weigh in!! Great performance though by haney can't wait to see him n Loma or him and Shakur. If he fights Shakur I'd like to see the winner of that fight the winner of tank and Ryan if they fight!!!
One sided American commentary spoiled my appreciation of a good win by Haney
Haney is like floyd
After seeing this fight I don't think Tank or Rolly want it with Devin Haney. I could be wrong but I think Shakur maybe the only one that can give Haney a challenge. 🤔
Haney whooped his ass dawg damm 😂😂
He not ready for Tank, I don't even think he can beat Ryan
NO POWER!
Devin fights like  mayweather
Check that boy eardrum
Teofimo Lopez no comment hahahaahahaha...
Undisputed! The one true real king
Devin "Pillow Fist" Haney
He's not ready for Loma or Tank!! And bring him to Isac Cruz!!
The Best in the world 🌎
I would hate to box against a haney.. Very tricky to hit, counter punching is on point, There's no doubt the kid is class, and is going to rule at this weight. But come on man 25 Clinches  by round 6.. Literally grabs his opponent when they attack..
Isaac "Pitbull" Cruz v Kamb will be interesting for me in the future
It's a Cliche but in Boxing there's levels George found his it was Called Devon Haney!!
he had to see what wbc belt they put around him😂😂😂
The Vampires,are mad.
Haney too big after hydrating
Watch only racist white people start talking that Devine boring racist crap
Devin 🥇👑
Devin is Awesome,  Great Job!
DH🥊👑💯
There you go, Kambo almost goes down on the 10th. I can't get it why he beat Teofimo in the first place. Devin can actually knock him out if he wanted it.
If Haney stops head hunting so much, attacks the body more  and throws more combinations at times, he can start getting those KO's again. He has the power, just not setting up his offense well enough to get KO's. That said, great performance overall. Would live to see him get that Loma fight and try to put that first big name on his resume.
Didn’t even watch it was it better than the first?
*dominant
It's impressive, Haney became undisputed in the easy way, without fighting top tiers, basically all his opponents have been b class boxers.
1.Tank 2.Devin 3.Shakur 4. Teofimo 5. Ryan
Teofimo didnt want none of this. Dodged  Haney and moved up in weight.
Haney hasn't even reached his prime yet..what a prodigy!!
Lightning had speed like that,hard to win against. 1,2 there all night
Knew Kam was going to lose by the 6 round but later on in the rounds especially 11-12 your hands are down your not pushing the pace but trying to match it. Haney great win Kam almost got himself knocked out smh hands down and he's tearing your face apart, I was so confused because after cutting Haney he should've tightened up on defence but needed to throw more so it was a give in take.
HANEY IS HIM
Great Highlights, much better than the typical Top Rank highlights.
Great Highlights
Haney can box but mans got noooo power :/
Haney got the job done again but it was a better fight than the last
Haney vs Shakur next
This is one of the most comprehensive beat downs at championship level boxing I have seen.  Haney beat the breaks out of Kambosos. In fact, this kind of beat down is worse than a knockout. This is the kinda beat down that makes dudes retire.  Back to back masterclass performances from Haney.  Make no mistake, Haney has crazy power, that's why his fights against Kambosos are so one sided. Kambosos is too afraid to dog it out, otherwise haney would have got the KO.
Work on dem legs Haney! When You start gettin in n outta der a lot quicker n start spinning yo opponents around on some AB foot work type shit you gone be unstoppable! Work out dem legs mane!😈🐐🙏🏿👑🏆
Schooled him
Want to see Haney vs the "elites" of 135. Davis, Loma, Ryan, Shakur. Hope i didn't miss anyone.
The Dream...literally 😪😴💤
Went out there across the pond twice and got it done! Let’s go!
😁👑🏆😈🐐
It's more fun to watch Wilder's 2:57 seconds fight than haney's 12 round fight
Комбосос воин!
i see nothing special about Haney. Loma will whoop his ass. mark my words
Haney vs crawford who win bros??
Give the kid his credit. He beat Kambosas worse than the first fight. Could’ve stopped him at one point but great performance from both guys.
I mean this kid looks like the next  Floyd Mayweather by far !!!!  He makes weight,stays in the gym, Has his own promotional company ..  And is already the youngest undisputed boxer in history 💯💯💯  Not even Stevenson or Ryan can say that !!!  But now the real fights start Devin, Destroy Loma and than move up to 140 lbs 🤲
David Haney with his mouth open and top lip sticking out, reminds me of our ancestors.
Top dawg Alhamdoulillah you showed man dem ya class
dh - no power but has timing .weak body gk - has power but lacks volume and follow ups
Great work Haney!
All the talk about he spent a lot of time in the gym working on new tactics well I didn't see any from GK he reverted to his old self when the going got tough
Easy work
Thats a wild pillow fist
Al Hamdoulilah 🥰🤲🏾💯
Haney vs Gervonta next fight
Andrea ward and Tim Bradley have got to be some of the worst announcers in boxing, just terrible!
Davin Haney is a boring boxer 🤣🤣🤣 not entertaining at all..
Haney Upped the pressure, made Kams face red like a tomato, defended the undisputed belts and gave an amazing performance and still will be disrespected. This man is only 23 and is doing more then 90% of boxing is today, Hes the Future
Congrats to Haney, he's a good boxer but he just isn't exciting to watch.
😎😎💣💣💣❤❤❤❤
Haney need to go for the kill more sometimes
Respect to George stayed on his feet, but Haney is just special.
I forgot this fight was today 🤣

Haney is boring king  of the clinch
Damn kamboses got fucked up

Ref 's AND  TRAINERS HAD NOTHING 2 DO IN DA 1ST O 2ND FIGHT BRO🥊🥊🥊🙋

Man R9 and R10 was Epic #TeamHaney #TheDream 👊😤
Haney is just too good for Kambosos. It’s gonna take someone like Shakur or tank Davis to beat him 🤷🏻‍♂️
