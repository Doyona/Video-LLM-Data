Some evs that slipped through. Poverty. Wor. Sxsm. You is a late glitch. Right guys. And we already in the future ready to go. So here you go going down.
I have not been this captivated since Missy Elliot 🎶🎶 amazing artist with MAJOR RANGE... Been listening to Doechii for a while now.
That was two awesome ❤❤❤
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Girly voice, vulgar person.
👨 in the name of Jesus, I decree and 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 📜 THAT ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ That my spirit 👨 🧍‍♂️ is clad with the armour of the Lord and the armour of light.  That your kingdom is my priority and Your assignment is my pleasure.  Let Your Kingdom come and Your will be done on the earth as it is in heaven.  I function and conduct my life’s affairs according to Your original plan and purpose for me.  I walk in Your timing.  You are the one true God, who makes everything work together and who works all things for good through your most excellent harmonies.  Cause my will to work in perfect harmony with yours.  Evil shall not come near my dwelling, since I dwell in the secret place of the Most High God and dwell under the shadow of the Almighty.  I cause demonic, destiny-altering activities to cease.  I take hold of the ends of the earth and shake evil out of its place.  I break evil and inappropriate thought patterns in my mind.  I speak peace into my life, relationships, ministry, work place and business.  Everything that is misaligned I command to come into divine alignment.  I have the mind of Christ and therefore seek things above and not beneath.  I ascend into new realms of power and authority and access new dimensions of divine revelation.  I will not backslide or look back into old ways, old methodologies, or old strategies unless directed by you to do so.   I wear the helmet of salvation to protect my mind from negative thoughts that would derail your purposes and plans for me.  Truth protects my integrity, righteousness protects my reputation, the gospel of peace guides my every step, the shield of faith secures my future and destiny, and the sword of the Spirit grants me dominion and authority.  I decree and declare a prophetic upgrading of my thought life.  I cancel the effect of negative, self-defeating thought processes and patterns and put them under my feet. I possess a kingdom paradigm, which grants me new ways of thinking, new ways of working, and new ways of living.  New cycles of victory, success, and prosperity will replace old cycles of failure, poverty, and death in my life.  I now have a new, refreshed, cutting-edge kingdom mentality.  At Your Word, as a kingdom trailblazer, I pioneer new territory.  Everything that pertains to my life and godliness and everything prepared for me before the foundation of the world must be released in its correct time and season.  I command everything to be released in Jesus’ Name.  I declare that there will be no substitutes, setbacks, holdups and no delays.  Your Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path, I shall neither stumble nor fall.  I am excited; my spirit is ignited; I walk in favour with God and man.  I am a success- oriented individual, and everything I touch turns to prophetic gold.  I am a successful business owner- and entrepreneur who provides good jobs to others.  Today I am blessed, there is no lack, all my needs are met, I am out of debt, and I have more than enough to give over and above all my needs.  All financial doors are opened, and financial channels are free.  Endless bounty comes to me.  Sufficient is Your provision for today.  I am healed and Spirit filled; sickness and disease are far from me.  I have buying power on my dollar, and I live in prosperity.  I confess that I only progress; I experience no setbacks and live a life filled with success.  I will persist until I succeed.  I walk in dominion and authority.  My life is characterized by liberty.  There is no slackness in my hand.  Where I stand, God gives me the land.  The blessings of the Lord make me rich, and I am daily loaded with benefits.  I am living my most blessed and best days now.  I am crowned with God’s love and mercy.  With all good things He satisfies me.  My home is a haven of peace.  I do my work unto the Lord with diligence and in the spirit of excellence.  My home, business, departments, and ministries function smoothly and efficiently.  The Lord gives me wisdom, knowledge, and understanding as to how to do my work more effectively, professionally, and accurately.  The Lord gives me all the right people to work with and for me.  Together we work as unto the Lord.  Relationships will come to me that are assigned to enhance my life and ministry for this season.  I call forth every individual and resource assigned to assist me in the fulfillment of my kingdom assignment during this season. I attract only the things, thoughts, people, and resources suitable to undergird and facilitate God’s original plan and purpose for my life. I am favoured by all who know me, meet me, work with me, and have any kind of formal or informal relationship with me......OVERCOMER YESHUA I AM UNBOTHERED BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS CHRIST.I AM 😇 🙏 ☺️ 😊 🙌 😇 🙏 ☺️ 😊 🙌 😇 🙏 ☺️ 😊 🙌 😇 🙏 ☺️ 😊 🙌 😇 🙏 ☺️ 😊 🙌 😇 🙏 ☺️ 😊 🙌 BLESSED TO BE A 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 🙌 GOD 🙌 I HAVE NOT EVER NOT THE NOT I HAVE EVER NOT SEEN IN AND IN NAME THE NAME NAME CHRIST CHRIST AND AND THE LIFE LORD AND CHRIST.I OF ALMIGHTY THE WILL IS THEM US YOU THIS IS OUR PROTECTOR CANNABIS-INFUSED AND THE HAVE THE BE A CARE THE IS PRAYER TO IS THOSE IT NAME THE THE CROSS MY EYES AS WELL NOT PART AS THE ETERNAL LIFE AND OF THE IN AND IN AND AND THE I NAME OF AND HOLY THE LORD JESUS OF CHRIST THOUGHTS OF GOD ALMIGHTY IS THEM AND GOD I HAVE WILL YOU WHO YOU THE ALREADY BLESS GOD FOR AND YOU LIFE SOUL AND OF PEOPLE WHO THAT HAVE THE ME INTO HAVE MY BE SATISFIED AN HOUR AGO I BUT THE LOVE ONE OF MY 27TH YEAR NAME WAS PROPHESIED VIRTUOUS MEMBER IN KNOWN WAY TO THE AND AND OF AND BOOK OF THE TRIBE COLLECTIVE OF THE IN AND IN I WILL LOVE ABOUT IT YOUR IT AM BE A PRAYER BLESSING THE AND 😅NOT BE ABLE ME THE THESE THE OF IN THE IN OUTSIDE BACK THE IT OF COLLECTIVE AND TRIBE WITHOUT TO OR GO OUT IN TO NAME WORLD AND NAME YOU'RE WOULD NOT DEPRESSING ON BE ME AN AND IN IN THE AND THE IS THE ALL AND AND YOU DREAM IT AIN'T AND THE NAME OF JESUS IS JESUS THE IS CHRIST YOUR WHITE FATHER THE THE LIES THEM OF ME CAN BE YOU YOU IN UNKNOWN PLACES WITHOUT YOU AND IT'S THE WITH 1AND WHO IS HE FEARLESS NOBODY WASN’T WILL IS ACTUALLY WHO A PRINCIPLES THE FUCK THE FUCK 8TH 8 3RD 7WORLD WILL 88 3RD 88TH 8 3RD ANOTHER DAY NAME DAY NAME FOR AND TO THE IN 2OF 28TH IF IN YOU'RE WASNT HE WILL THE YOU AND THE LOBBYING 15AND AND IN THE IN WAY IN THE SUBCONSCIOUS IN THE NAME THINGS THE HOLY FATHER HOLY SPIRIT HOLY HOLY SPIRIT HOLY SPIRIT HOLY SPIRIT HOLY SPIRIT HOLY SPIRIT HOLY SPIRIT JOHNSON IS THE ALL PRINCE TOOLS GOD 🤴 🤴 AND BE THE IN MY SERVICE OWN BELIEF LIFE AND I WALK HAVE NO TO TO FOR SOMETHING TO MAKE SENSE TO AND TO THE ALL REPUBLIC GOD TOOLS YOU THAT 🔧 🔨 AND THE NAME LIFE OF THAT CHAPTER OF LIFE AND IN AND WAY NAME ABOVE EVERY OTHER NAME NAMES THE JESUS OF JESUS 🤨 JESUS 🤨 AND IN I I IN I THE NOT FOR YOU'RE SO MAKE HAVE AIN'T EVEN THAT LOVE A UNDENIABLE ❤️ 😍 💖 SO IT'S I TRUTHFUL.THEN TO ME AND A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM THE AN AND IN ALL IS IN THE IS IN INSTEAD 8 3RD ONE NAME 8 3RD NAME IN IN IS IN IS IN IT THE GOD’S GOD YOUR DEMONS 22AND ? 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌 😌 ✨️ ☺️ 😊 🙏 🙌

Вона секс.................
This my first time hearing this song 😂😂😂😂
The song alright too me . Even though ion know what they talking about.
Good song and i enjoy the cinematography of the video but im getting tired of the obscene sexuality that all of these talented female artists have to perform. I love Denial is a river, broken clocks, and supermodel mvs. I dont want to see a close up of these women's crotches. I want to see them respected for their talent and creativity. No problem with being sexy obv. It just feels like the same thing that every female artist is required to perform and it is stale.
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Timeless classic 2025
❤❤❤❤❤😮
This needed a bomb harmonic bridge
Underrated gold ❤
You can TELL they had so much fun making this.
SZA has such a uniquely beautiful voice.  I know it when I hear it❤ 🎶

AnXiTeNtY iS bEtTeR tHeN tHiS sOnG !😜!😜
how did this flop
Great sound and creative talent but the video is too "strippery" and oversexualized for my taste.
I always thought these two celebrities look alike
frrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
2025 anyone?
I feel crazy after listening to sooooo many songs from Doechi and loving them but had no ideas who she was nor how she looked until today. I just randomly thought 💭 hmmmm who is that chick that won a Grammy for her rap album and come to find out, all of the songs I’ve been listening to were from her 🤦🏽‍♂️
I am glad I know her from this song
THE TOP COMMENT PREDICTED DOECHIIS FAME❤❤
why does she look so different
This video was everything!!!

❤❤❤
I BREATHE FOR THIS
It’s giving Estelle “American Boy” vibes

Doechii simultaneously exists on the other side of limitations and is impossible.
I never knew this was Doechii’s song. Yo shorty got range 🔥🔥🔥
Persuasive
Can’t believe this is my first time listening to this! 😍
I came here to manifest she sing this when she open for SZA at the Grand National Tour. 🧘🏿‍♀️
Yes!!! Go Doechii!!!
No one's said it, but yall...what about SZA hitting the splits so effortlessly on a cold ass g wagon at 1:47

She must be spending a fortune on  these videos. I don’t understand how a new artist could afford all this, but I’m glad to see it! They’re Y2K MTV quality. She’s spoiling us with all this art.
This is beautiful I'm dancing in the bathroom crying happy tears❤
Women are art 🖤

LORD GOD 😍😍😍😍 IM LATE but I'm here now WOW 🤓
🤩🤩💜💜💞💞🧜🏾‍♀️🧜🏾‍♀️🎶🎶
2:20 should've just been the hook that repeated and should've came in from like a minute into the song. it took too long to get to that part imo. i was waiting....and waiting 😒.....and waiting for that part. Better song structure would've set this set this song off so differently
I just listened to all her albums. What the fuck. She’s so captivating, and her voice hypnotizing. Damn👌
Tde don’t missssss
Why song underrated 😢
This my shiii❤❤❤
I was vibing to a german song and I knew I heard the melody before, he totally stole it from Doechii lmaoo Mark Forster - Alles Toxisch
All this Chocolate and Talent on one song 😢🤤
This song is soooo underrated. When spotify suggested me this song, I thought the mv would be 100+ mil views.
i still wish they kept Doechii’s second verse for the remix
Doechi is so underrated.  She's a great rapper and deserves more fr fr fr
Crazy Persuasive  Swamp bitches Alter ego MPH Rocket
Why is no one talking about the pool tricks underwater ? Nah we don’t deserve the woman. I’m in absolute awe
Just discovering this home girl. Where have I been?  ❤

I am a fan of jazz and saoul musique but still gravitate toward those two artists, one things I have to admit is that  Doechii is so black is beautiful she  has been a revelation for me made me realise how much I love black woman wish her a lot of success !
Look at the flower of life

Ik she in her own lane but she definitely got Beyonce capability. She sing raps, gives visual and dance. the mic is always on too.
Why do our videos as black women/musicians have to be so overly sexualised? The white women don't have to do this to sell or get attention. Its such a double standard. The music industry is so very racist.
❤❤❤❤❤
Can we get a round of applause for the creative queen, Doechii with two I's? So stunning as well. Show stopping
This is a masterpiece
ICONICCCCC!

Underwater twerking???? WHAT???? I'm new to doechii but I'm loving everything so far, her voice is so soothing (also kinda reminds me of Ari Lennox??) also her lyricism is so solid
it might as wll be porn . this is what became of black women and their talent.
sza is married to that pole I swear lol..the water thing was dope and doechii takes me back..90s vibe
What an incredible collaboration. This will go down as one of the BEST female collabs of all time. Mark my words ❤
Real music....real art...real quality visuals...real creativity
💃🏽❤❤❤
so... no one's gonna talk about how the song is about mary huangela the pot ??? or im just too high?
Doechii e sza entregaram muito!! Esse hino merecia mais reconhecimento!!
She reminded me of doja cat a bit not a lot tho.
Why do parts of ciara & summer's video remind you of this?..
Was sza on a damn pole in water wow lol ????
I almost like this more than the original both are a vibe.

SZA So damn fine
SZA is so corny. Tries too hard. She still hasn’t figured it out that being herself is fine
Doechii is the cool ocean water, Sza is the rising sun

This is screaming  sex appeal and I fucking love it🎉. It’s the art for me.
Solaaaaannaaaaasa

I know the queen's in the ballroom go off to this one...
That scene with SZA pole dancing has to be one of the most ethereal things I've ever seen.. 😭😩
SZA so fine 😍😍😍
Sza is so damn thick!!! 🔥 😁👍🏽👌😍🥰🤤
By my opinion I prefer the original version one
So glad there’s captains because I still can’t understand Sza’s cursive
Can you imagine Doechii working with Doja Cat
1:37 it’s giving FKA Twigz - Tears in the club
That "How does it feel to be You?" turns me on everytime. Am I weird for that?
SHE SO PERSUASIVE 😍 I’m in love with this song
WHY is it impossible for (black) female singers to make classy music videos!!???! WHY !???!  Im cant be the only one tired of the nakedness and softporn!!!
That underwater stripping was epic
Reminds me of down on my luck by vic mensa
But she is amazing tho 😍
Nah cus when she said 3am it 3:02 here
Am I rude for saying this track did not need sza? I love sza don’t get me wrong!
this was gorgeous 🔥🔥🔥
😍😍
Creativity is everything!! 😍😍😍✨✨😍💅🏽
Damn 🔥 🔥
The stripper pole underwater?!?! COME ON NOW👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽

Chocolate everywhere! 🍫🍫🍫🍫🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
We love stripper mermaids. This needs more views ASAP!
this whole vibe and SZA infamous runs remind me of the ending of that SHATTERED HEART song off of Brandy HUMAN album circa 2008 i am loving this vibe!
If I ever got in the industry I'm goin at SZA
The way this song got me in a chokehold ❤️❤️ you did your big one with this

👑No.1 Japanese RAP SONG! https://youtu.be/XJCW_mj-DYU
2 Words: Use Headphones
♥️
Love
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥💗💕💓
They look good in that gold outfit🥰🥰
This artist is so amazing. It's too bad she got rid of a paying customer who will never buy a single record just for pushing political ideology in her album title. Equality doesn't mean demanding others treat a particular class a certain way. Log off the internet and see what the real world is like.
How did I miss this 🖤
🔥🔥
Woooowwwwww
Love
💜❤️💜❤️💜
Love
i’m glad this song is finally getting the love it deserved😵‍💫
black excellence fr

Repeat repeat repeat 🔁
First time I heard Doechi I knew she belonged with TDE.. this feature was not a surprise but still 🤯 they're giving me the good and bad sides of a Gemini
Music at it's finesse
wow mother
The Visuals and the vocals just wow 🤩❤️💕🤞🏾
This reminds me of an Anderson .Paak song
i'm not going to lie .. when i first heard this i wasn't loving sza part on this song... but its the way i came back 1 week later and why WAS THIS A BOMB ASS FEATURE !! yeah she ate that lol
I really like this vibe, the music is so nice, but has anyone else got a little deja vu when watching the video? it is similar to FKA twigs' 'Tears In The Club' - underwater pole dancing, even the beats ad, am I the only one who has this feeling? I scrolled through the comments, but didn't see anyone else notice that 'inspiration' from FKA
Likeeeeee this is everything I never knew I needed.
Sza look df good
Kinda sounds like something greentea peng would make
AYEEE DOECHII PUTTING ON FOR TAMPA!!!! HOMETOWN PROUD OF YOU ❤️

It is so sad we have all of these extraordinary new up and coming artists music artists and there's nowhere to get to know them all the talk shows talk about our negativity like TMZ but they don't interview the artist or you have to stay up late at night unless some I'm not even going to be negative interview are people it is so sad that there's nowhere we used to have soul train there's nowhere we used to have jet magazine there's nowhere to get to know these artists in a positive light but America's not after our young black people know of course they're not
Doechii is incredible and SZA was the perfect artist for this remix
🔥🔥
Poor copy of Azealia Banks ..we all know it
Did I miss something or are they actually singing about weed? Love the beat and the vocals but... marijuana? huh?

Soy latino me gusta R&B❤️👌
SzA❤️
SZA makes everything better
TDE has fallen off big time, this is wack. Song was decent without SZA on it but now clearly Top has tried to boost hits by adding SZAs pop factor to it. TDE has gone downhill and SZA has lost what made her so unique
THIS IS HOW MUSIC VIDEOS SHOULD BE ITS SO CREATIVE AND YOU CAN SEE EVERYTHING SLOWLY AND SURELY NOT FLASHING A DIFFERENT SCENE EVERY SECOND
These ladies are indeed so persuasives 😁😁
Such a vibeee
Omg u ateee dis is talent frl
God this music video is stunning. Doechii and SZA go so well together
I love women.
I like the original, SZA ruined the song…
She is giving me an Estelle vibe 😍
This is a Hot Record.... Bravo..

This is giving me clean the house on Sunday vybezzzz 🧹🛴🪣💕
Don't know if this person is a woman or a man...but I'm not watching any further to figure it out.
That bass line towards the last chorus is so addictive. Its giving filter house 90s vibes. Its so addictive 😭
Is it just me or this has the same vibe as Superlove? I love it

POT FARMER DANCE SONG $$ I got out my pipe stuffed it with pot You better believe it held a whole lot. I whipped out a lighter thumbed up a flame Sucked down that smoke which comforts my brain.  I tried alcohol smoked cigarettes They did nothing but give me regrets. My mom had arthritis could not walk around I rolled her a joint she danced on the ground.  I thought I was losing my lovemaking knack After I smoked some to me it came back. Soon I decided prices were high I searched for some ground I wouldn't have to buy.  I bargained for seeds from smokers all around  Got in my truck and drove out of town. I walked through the woods where wild birds nest  Found me the meadow I thought was the best.  I dug up the ground sowed all my seeds Said a small prayer for strong, healthy weeds. I watered at night with a five-gallon pail  Mosquitoes went hungry for I wore a veil.  Seven months went by; I thought I would die Till the Halloween moon was high in the sky. At night I went out, in a camouflage suit  Used my corn knife to chop down the loot.  I hung it up to dry where it couldn’t be found. Came back and got it, when it had turned brown. I trimmed off the buds, stuffed them in bags Called all my friends and passed out free drags.  In less than a week my crop was gone  I flew to St. Thomas with a love hungry blonde!!  By Kansas City Poet Tom Zart Google = Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share! Google = George Bush Tom Zart Google = Pot Farmer Poem
BODY HEAT 1O5 %% We drank several glasses of champagne In the living room of her house. Around 9: 30 that evening I found myself in her blouse.  I fondled and kissed her so gently Like the soft footsteps of a mouse. To my surprise, she opened her eyes And said, “look, we're not going to play house.”  I right away replaced her clothing And buttoned her blouse once more. There was no doubt of my defeat As I lay there upon the floor.  She said, “tell the truth, are you angry?” I answered, by far I was not "It's more important what you think of me Than what I may not have got."  She wiped away a tear from both eyes And said, "you're my kind of man." At that point, she did arise And to me she held out her hand  She led me away like a blind man Who had somehow lost his cane. When we reached her bedroom door I thought I'd gone insane.  Twenty fingers searched all the forbidden places As our body heats reached 105. If love's relief had not been achieved I doubt if we'd still be alive.  THANK YOU FOR WHO YOU ARE IN YOUR HEART ! By Tom Zart Most Published Poet On The Web Tom’s 1,650 Poems Are Free To Share! Google = Most Published Poet Google = George Bush Tom Zart Google =  Most Published Poet  Google = Pot Farmer Poem

Nice Collab❤️❤️❤️❤️when did SZA get so thickalicious 🤪
New theme song to my life
It feels damn good 🎵🎵👏🏾💕💕🤭💕
Honestly SZA is the only one who could have done this remix

YEAAAAAA this is a show stopper 😩
This sounds like a Doja cat song to me, she should’ve been in this collaboration
Yooooo 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾🎊🎉❤️🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾💃🏾💃🏾
Don't change your nose, complexion, or body. You're perfect.
looking good Girls
I want her and doja to do a song so baddd
Doechii is so exquisite. I would love to see her and Doja cook up too🔥🔥🔥
Great collab..... but the original is still superior tho
😍😍
I liked the other video but the underwater pole dancing was dope
Amazing, want to smoke weed and make out with them both... SZA never fails though.
I love this 😍
I’ve been so obsessed with this SZA version and now I’m even more so with these visuals, doechii is a true artist
1000th comment, song fire🔥🔥
Sza worst verse we needed Bree runway or doja on persuasive but love you doechii
i am so obsessed with the underwater pole shots
I love this! I wish all these amazing women would stop with the bbls though. We are not decorations or made from the same mold. I hate that the media tries to make us believe that all black women have the same body.
ICONIC💖💖💖💝💝💝
It's somebody about how they mix SZA's vocals that's off
Absolutely devoured
She sounds like Estelle 😎😎😎😎
This creativity!!!👏🏿✨🌟 Love seeing artists' creative brains. The underwater scenes were 🤌🏿
These VISUALS!!!
One thing about sza…she gon utilize a pole I mean damn…I done seen her pole in a gas station, a library, and now the damn ocean?! Woo her mind!!
YOUTUBE: BORN GOD: CLONE, CHECK IT OUT!!
UNDER WATER POLE DANCING?!?!?! Innovation. Don’t play with Doechii
Who pole dances underwater? Doechii is that b*tch and too many people are sleeping on her.
SZAs voice is so unique, I’m ready for the 2nd album.
Congrats Doechii !!!!!!!!!!! You are going far
Sza loves a pole! And I love it for her. The bass man went off.
💖💜
wow 😍 the lyrics, colours, production 💯✨
I love this song. But i wonder how it would’ve been with Doja instead.
Hi❤iT
Sza at 2:50 🤭😍
Doechii is literally is giving you EVERYTHING, I can't help but continue to be blown away each and every time I have the pleasure of just watching her, the flow, the energy. She inspires me to open up to myself and really chase what I've been searching for.
I honestly like the original better
Girl I'm so happy for you!!! You go girl!!
i love that Doechii has some money behind her to make beautiful and interesting videoes for her music. im obsessed with her & can’t wait to see what else she creates through her career
i think your type like anderson paak
Why is this song giving me an Apple commercial vibes.
She has the momentum. Doja is not kidding the moment she mentioned about her name.
I'm here before this mv get 100M
Wow interesting visuals ... very creative 👌  I like 👍
This didn't need sza on it, it was great on its own.
Nice, nice, nice !!!!

And this ladies and gentlemen, is what we call ART!
You look gorgeous. Good song.
I like the original video and sound better. Doechii please don't let them change you or your sound.
SHES A HARD WORKER 😍😍😍😍😍😍👑👑👑👑👑👑

How can you not be an instant fan the way they ate this video down and then the pole in the water 🤯 omg loveeee the melanin
This remix with chlöe would be sooo good!.
This is a jam!! Yall did that!!!!!
While I love his song, they’re really wasting SZA’s time with this! It’s been years since her last album & they have her making videos for remixes.   Tf is happening at TDE
the pole underwater is giving fka twigs in the tears in the club video… anyways doechii slapped
Love this but why does SZA sounds like she’s recording in a water bottle 😫
This is the collaboration we all needed
las amo 💟
loooovve this Doechii is so talented! I wish her rap verse from the original was still on the song. love it
This video is art😫🫶🏾
Rainhas💅👑💃
The ad placements always make me chuckle 🤭
Sza was not necessary on this song. It is just so perfect. Her energy just didn't mesh with Doechii Love the video.
Ommmg
WHERES THE ALBUM SZA???
Absolute perfection. The budget … the aesthetic… YES
The Track is a Banger
Doechii ate this up but I still can't understand Szanese but I'm learning to speak and understand it...
THESE VISUALS YES
Now docheii u ate this to the MAXXX
Yazzzzzz a video💃💃💯💯🤜🤛
🔥
Makin it clap inna water is crazyyyy
Damn...Doechii went from feeding us to feeding the whole world in the blink of an eye, and she looks hella fine doing it. Thank you mama!!
I would love to see a collab between Doechii and Bree runway.
SHES A HARD WORKER🤍
Can't wait for Doe to win a damn Grammy.

I actually love this song without Sza.... no offense
Visually STUNNING! 🥵💚🥰 They couldn't give us at least one 8 count tho? 🤧
although I was excited for the remix I don't think it was needed. I absolutely loved the original 💕
I’m over the vougue music it sounds safe beautiful visuals & voices tho🤩
Sza I’ll be taking all the features you could give me 😍 I’m not here to rush your creative process sis! Love this song ! Shoutouts to the both of you!

I still can't believe SZA is a Muslim woman 😃
I'm sorry but SZA literally ruined the song 🗿1:34 and 2:41 just sounded so fucking out of tune to the actual song man and the autotune??? The song was already good by itself. The video is amazing but man 😭
Love this!! 😍

Doechii does it AGAIN! <3
Amazing
THIS IS EVERYTHING

Jesus is coming soon; please repent of your sin and turn to him.  Jesus was crucified, died on the cross, was buried, and God raised him from the dead on the third day, in fulfillment of the scriptures.  He loves you and wishes that none should perish.  He died so that we may have life, eternal life in heaven.  Read Romans 10:9-13 for starters.  Believe in your heart who Jesus is and what he did for you.  Are you paying attention to what is happening in the world??  We are at the end, Jesus is coming.

I really LOVE this video !!😍😍
Yess
this is your best music video!
So happy to support her along her journey. The come up is going to be huge
Her and fka twigs love to be strippers under water lol
Doechii and SZA have such complimentary flows and deliveries. They are both great in their own ways too but hearing them work together is always a treat. I think the fanbases are generally really similar too which is nice to see likeminded people collide every time they collab. I hope someday I can gather even a tenth of the amount of fans with the perspectives that theses two fan bases have for my own music. Truly unmatched energy🔥
THIS REMIX IS A MASTERPIECE
Wow adding sza gave this a totally different vibe
Oh hell yeah!!! Love the vibessssssssss AHHHH
Take my wig please 💇🏾‍♀️👌Here, just have it!!
Omg Doechii and SZA … i love it … it’s the synchronisation for me … amazing job
I like better without Sza, but it’s okay

There’s no way you don’t feel like the ish when you listen to this.
Can we please acknowledge the LOOKS Doechii gives us!!!! Each one is so unique and not what any of the other girls are giving. Truly one of one!! 🫶🏾🫶🏾🫶🏾
They diiiid THAT!!!
Flying solo is so good
the type of vocals that make you feel like you're floating on a cloud 💞
Well, goddamn. My gay is showing 🔥😂❤️💅💕🥰
S T U R N 💖💅🇧🇷
love it !!!!! 🙌🏾
I love these two together! Was sis actually pole dancing underwater though?! Wow!
SOOOLAAAAANAAAAAAAAA!!!! 😫😫😫😫😫😫
THIS SONGGGGG IS TOO GOOD😭😭 I knew it was gonna be a BANGER as soon as I heard the start
im now szasexual. feel free to join the club
Video is good but not needed cause You already did a great video for this song already! Sza in General wasn't needed on this track and she didn't add much! Also SZA WHERE IS THAT DAMN ALBUM? 😑😑😑😑😑😑 stop shaking you're ass and drop you're OWN music! Damn! Its been like what? 5 or 6 years since your last album? SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE!
This better BLOW UPP
Wowww🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I’m gagged
Sza Sza Sza🤤🤤 thick as fuck
Underwater twerking 💦 😎 This is an iconic video, I hope it surpasses over FAR over 1 million views because it’s an amazing song. Doechii is up next, and I can’t wait to see her take over the world. And SZA…whew, she is freaking amazing❤️❤️❤️ I’m rooting for these queens 👑
Only here for sza
I keep hearing this in my head. This has blown up. This is highly creative and I expected that from Doechii and expect that from anything including SZA.
SO HAPPY. LOVE THIS🤎🤎🤎
Go Black Girl Magic🪄✨👑👑
This needs to be trending 🔥🔥 doja needs to be on here
Should’ve had Doja on this fr
*Screaming* stripper pole…. UNDERWATER!  🐐🔥
Wow .. I need Bree Runway Doja Doechii and Rico Nasty to do a song together. Please lord have mercy make this happen

Meu deus serviram TANTO 🥹😮‍💨🔥❤️
The under water pole dancing is such spectacular 😍😍 I’m in awe 🤤🫶🏾✨

two game-changers, one video
🔥🔥🔥🔥🤞💪❤💯💎
Damn some hot remix 🔥🔥🔥🎧🎵🎤
they're both so beautifull
This is everything
Nothing but love for both artists and this is a cute video. Although, the underwater pole dancing makes me think of FKA Twigs - Tears in the Club. I personally prefer the original but glad they came together to create a cool remix.
QUEEEEN OF MY LIFE
This is amazing. I hope copyright lets me add this to a playlist 👑✨💖
YASS QUEEN
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
SZAAAAA!!! 🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️🔥🔥
Ever notice sza always on too of a truck. This video, the video with Kali Uchis as well. Wonder what thats about
She's a fucking star... Just... That's honestly all I have to say. 🔥💚🔥
This is a Megan x Beyonce Moment
This song is flawless in every way, Doechii is absolutely flawless as well and sza on this track is a chefs kiss
she really came out swinging out the gate,whew😍!
Captivating
Doechii showing all her creativity she is going to be phenomenal from years to come from now and both of y’all looking like a Nubian Queens and Egypt goddess in this and SZA we miss you 🥰
Black girl magic ! 🪄
Get em Doechii‼️💙❤️‍🔥✨️😍
Okay, this is giving everything! Yasss
Yo that underwater twerk went crazy 💯
Lovely 🔥
❤️❤️❤️
there may be some more daring scenes in the clips. It's like transparent clothes... Let white-skinned women play in the clips. the clips are so suffocating and dark... doechii please..
OMGG YALL LOOK SO GOOD THIS IS AMAZING <3333
🙄 more black chick's shaking their ass'. How Original..SHOCKER 🙄
Im so so happy to see Sza’s after baby body. The cellulite is so refreshing 🙂❤️
She so Persuasive ooooh
Pelamor de Deus sza vem pro Brasil fazer um show, ajude nós os esquecidos
the remix nobody asked for
Absolutely love this yesssss
😍😍😍
Doechii and SZA are lyrical goddesses and always make sense in their songs and narratives. It’s so good to see both of you collaborate in this visually powerful way. TDE, keep it going!
Black Girls are up 3000 the queens are boosting our heads up this Friday
BITCH YES. THANK YOU PLS COME TF AGAIN.
The original song whit out sza it's 1000 better
Doechii is a star.
I thought the original clip couldn't get any better, and look at this version it turned out amazing.🖤✨
❤️❤️
🔥🔥
Perfect pairing!
ART
I wish I had the intelligence to write a dissertation about just the visual elements of this video. 😔 Like the concepts are so good??? Pole dancing in water making it look like some Venus/Pour it Up Botticelli type beat with some Ophelia vibes really hit.
We are in our feminine energy 🔥😌😜
👸🎀👸
doechii is the moment
Beautiful 🥲❤
to the moon ho!
Go Doechii Go!
Underwater pole dancing, work bitch
Love love love! 😍
im cryingggg this is ittttt

A T E .
Yooo!! I literally just discovered the song the other day and I was like wow don't you should really drop this as a single and here it is I'm so excited I love this shit.
How could they possibly top the original aesthetic?? Which is phenomenal in itself 🤭
Doechii is TAKING it! She is comfortable in that skin
❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love this song so much 😍💖👏
just... WOW. amazing.
Love to see them shine together <3
Did Doechii just audition for P-Valley in front  of all of us??
The Aesthetics, the visuals are top tier❗ 🔥🔥🔥

I've been listening to your music for over a year now... just waiting for you to get the recognition you deserve.
She’s just different!
You artistry is out of this world. PERIOD.
Hammer an Sza mich das Lied erinnern und jetzt ist sie dabei !  Wow  Hammer dieses Lied !
This is dope 🔥 everything was A1 the underwater pole dancing 😮‍💨🔥 first time I ever seen this ever in a video great idea.
1:07 is giving me Lolita Leopard's 'Crossove'  vibes. However as a Gen Xer I'm here for Doechii and other Late Millennial/Gen Z artists! and especially the cis gendered Women and LGBTQ artists cuz the music has become fresh and inspiring! I hope She takes over the world!
I love it!!!!
BLACK WOMAN POLE DANCING UNDERWATER.  My day has been made! Thank you Doechii and SZA <3

I see FKA Twigs, I see Bree Runway, hell I even see Azelia Banks but I don’t see Doechii in this. Maybe I’m being to hard on the visuals but I was expecting something different for this song I guess.
This collaboration!!!!!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 we need more for sure they complement each other well
The creativity is so cool in this video ,the way the light compliments their skin is beautiful.  Doechii is such a breath of fresh air and has star power ,Sza was great for this track 🤩🤩

(Keep it goin')  Feel like the feeling of a silk press Feel like I feel like I got new breasts Feel like I feel like I needed rest (Go grow) Feel it's the season I should let go And that's the reason I'ma buy more Feel it's the season I should fly solo (Doechii, hey)  I'm so sedated And she so persuasive This isolation So sweet, you could taste it (Brrrt) Wake, bake in the mornin' Moonlight, y'all be yawnin', it's 3:00 in the mornin' And I'm still performin'  She's so persuasive (So, so, so) That marijuana (Marijuan-) She's so flirtatious (She's so flirty) How does it feel to be you? (How does she smoke that marijuana?) So persuasive (So persuasive) That marijuana (Marijuan-) She's so flirtatious (She's so per-per-per-) How does it feel to be you? (Keep it goin')  How does it feel to be alive? Lemme break it down till it feel right How does it feel? I'm so aligned and it's so Devil himself can't kill the vibe I would hate me too, better get in line I can't control, it's the flow  It's hard, can't tell when to stop When I'm on one, oh How does it feel? I be the boss, I paid the price (Price) Get up off my balls, I said it nice Get up off that wall and change your life Take you to paradise  She's so persuasive (She's so persuasive) That marijuana (That marijuana) She's so flirtatious (So flirtatious) How does it feel to be you? So persuasive (So persua-) That marijuana (Marijuan-) She's so flirtatious (Oh, she's so flirty) How does it feel to be you? (Keep it goin')  How does it feel to be you, you? How does it feel to be you? How does it feel to be you, you? How does it feel to be you?  How does it feel to be th-that bitch? How does it feel to be th-that bitch? How does it feel to be th-that bitch? How does it feel to let, le-let go? How does it feel to let, le-let go? How does it feel to let, le-let go?  (She's a hard worker) She's so persuasive (So persuasive) That marijuana (Marijuana) She's so flirtatious (Flirtatious) How does it feel to be you?

How does it feel to be the bad bitch
Doechii is a star!!!
Doechiiiiiii
sza scene gives "no love" vibes
the beats plug is so unnatural and obvious at this point just leave it out it ruined the whole fuckin thing work of art otherwise
Sza continues to prove I do not mind her on any feature as long as I get to hear her and see her some where I am still a stan. Then, I mean at this point it’s not about the rise of Doechii it’s about who’s gonna stop her…cause move out the way, is what it’s giving💥🚀❤️‍🔥👏🏿💯🦾
