Benn finishes Eubank Jr in AO arena for Eubank jr vs Benn|||
Years from now we all will look back on what has happened to Conner cos I believe he will rise hi in the boxing world & he WILL win a belt or two unlike his peer Eubank
Wonder how much juice he was on in this one 😉🤔
Juiced up
Like trying to fight a lion.
Here after van heerden egg joke
Absolutely disgusting getting juiced up to knock someone out like that , ban him
That is not the same Conor Benn that was getting bounced off the canvas by Peynoud// is he on something i wonder.
Now we know why.
Could he have been on the drug here?
He had us all fooled🤦
Chris van Heerden described Benn as being "angry and emotional." I wonder why 🤔
Orange JUICE!!
Hes very fast this boy, hitting with a lot more  power too??????  Wonder why
Just watched Van Heerdens interview on the Spencer tunde show after Conor failed the drug test and I came to watch this fight again and its hard not to look at Conor with suspicious eyes.
🤔🧐
Look at Ben the little pumped up roid head, so obvious now. Chris van Heerden has only been stopped once in his whole career against one of the greatest in the division Errol Spence and then this little roid head comes along and blasts him away in 2 rounds. Just shows why drugs cheats should be banned for life.
💉
Cant help to think its the steroids
We now wonder if he was clean on this fight 🤷‍♂️
But was he on roids though?
Can see the cheat through this kid
Cheating rat
Juiced up cheat
when you look at this now he seems enhanced
Steroids.
Was he drugged up here too?
Now this guy is saying mayb benn was on the juice here wen they fought?
Benn.could.take his shots all night....I think this Eubank fights gonna be epic...Benn wins
A young mike tyson comes to mind
The 'not as dark as his dad' destroyer
Why are both boxers wearing women's skirts? Bloody pansies
Reminds me of a boxer called eubank jr
He is only getting better with each opponent he meets. Most fighters wait a few rounds to feel out the other guys skillset. Connor Benn unreal hunger and confidence to go in and get the job done as quick as possible. Chris Eubank will have a challenge on his hands for sure and he is doing great since he has changed trainers but Connor Benn/Eubank will be a great contest indeed i cannot wait. Well done Chris on this quick finish pal.
Yup the Ben
Like watching his dad back in the day same power unreal
Benn was really 170lbs on the night???? No way 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Who's here after Eubank fight announced
Benn will get KO’d he’s short and has small arms, is reckless and his power is not tested in the higher weight.
Give him Broner or Thurman.
Conor has the power & skills! Really love the way he goes charging in & his movement is very unpredictable which is why he is dangerous.  Dark Destroyer legacy upgrade!
Love ❤️ x
brilliant finish he hunts doesn't follow great cultured pressure cutting the ring off and forcing a pace the opponent doesn't want! He earned that knockout skilfully, he's much more than just a sharp puncher!
Been watching him since day one and can’t wait to see more 👊🏻 🔥
Step him up or the fans will get bored
First time seeing CB fight. Wow. Elasticity. Form. Sharp. A new style in the ring. Beautifully debut for me to watch. Appreciate the upload DAZN 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊
I swear this guy only fights unheard 9ff bums
......what a joke , talk about mismatch of a fight, like it seems most of benn's fights these days whilst under Edwina hearne
his dad would agree
wear a belt
u just crush ppl respect
badass mfer love it
whole uk with u bro do it
dad mad pwer but hes better bxer i feel
fists like his dad bam bam
this guy deserves world title shot
Love Connor's energy and really enjoy watching him fight 👊💪🏆
once ben learns to be more composed in his shots he will be dangerous, he already is but he will take everyone by storm
I agree needs a few more testing fights and then 2 yrs hel be unstoppable
Definately chip off the old block like watching dad in the 90,s
To many ppl discrediting Van heerden. 2 years out of the ring and 34 years old... fair enough. The only thing inactivity affects is ring rust and he is an x world champion so just pack it in.  For all of those saying he stopped him sooner than Spence, completely different fighters. Spence isnt ruthless and relentless like Conor.. he is a classier boxer quite probably a harder hitter but he starts slower. Benn just ripped the will out of Van heerden thats all, and he will keep doing it to fighters like Van heerdens... he will do it to Brooks, Broners... Garcia's but the likely hood of him doing it to Spence, Crawford, Ennis and so on is very slim.
He trains like an animal well deserved man with a dad like his you can’t slack too much lion pride
when is this dosser going to fight a live a opponent
Conor benns on heat atm, not many boxing will be queuing up to fight him
His punched sound like ggg
Hes not ready for brook hel get iced! hes very wild . Exciting as anything but hel have  losses as he as steps uo against top opp
Would love to see Conor in the gym with Mike Tyson. Those hooks and jump hooks are brutal, Mike could show him a few more things for sure
Chip off the old block just like his dad pure fighting machine
all those tats look a mess 🤢
Benn is next level.  You could see van Heerden's body language change after 2mins of the first round.  He literally came out of his corner leaning backwards for the second round.  He was defeated in his head long before Benn sparked him.
What a fighter!
Looks great.. stick him in with errol Spence suddenly not so great..
Fun to watch
Could even be nastier than his dad.
He reminds me of Tyson
Conor, looking very Mike Tyson esk.
This other guy isn’t in Benns league. Was an unfair fight tbh
Connor Benn Reminds me of his father.  I sparred with Nigel Benn once in the UK.   He was a pressure fighter and could really bang.  Connor Benn has followed in the footsteps of his father and can really bang too.   What a great performance Wow!  What a KO! well done Connor
mini Tyson
His dad was the same taking out everybody but then got stopped😉 i’d say history will repeat itself..
I like the kid but I don't think that was an amazing performance throughout, yeah he knocked him out great but I think when he moves up in opposition he'll get exposed, his foot work isn't amazing either. I know he's still young and improving and I hope he makes the improvements he needs to make.
haters?  what is there not to love about conor?? hes exciting, aggressive, spiteful.  He wants to knock people out not prance around a ring and take split decisions.  He might well get beat eventually but like his dad, hes a warrior and will just come again.
Awesome just a matter of time until he will be world champion 🏆
He’s high level now no one can deny he’s come leaps and bounds
I've not watched Connor enough to comment.
Absolute animal!
Beautiful shot, bad-man-Ben
Well done conor won't be the only one who had there doubts after the peynaud fights but since then particularly since the formella fight the last 5 have been consistent level performances at a similar level still learning on the job and his age I don't mind him fleshing out his record abit learning no rush look at ricky Hatton he had something like 38 fights before fighting tsyzu for World title and was 27 at the time think conor not going the traditional route is hard to gauge where he is at he's above British and at European level now for me and still improving think a josesito Lopez fight would be another learning type fight if you wanted to push him I'd go avanesyan or Brook stear clear of Danny garcia mikey may not be a bad shout
Next fight for Benn really needs to be a step up, someone with pedigree.
Benn looks very small compared to a Spence, or Crawford, Porter, or Thurman.
Well done . Beat another nobody but little steps I guess
Lets hope his run continues, as opponents are more skilled. Remember AJ was invincible when he was fighting bums.
Like a mini Mike Tyson 😍
In Benn we trust,oi oi.
Nope.  Eddie Hearn is having a laugh.  I'm not impressed.
Wanna see benn and gervonta
Wow he is something else
Booooooooooooooooo
Benn won’t last 5 minutes against someone world class
How come benn and eubank haven't fight anyone decent yet! Can only fight what put in front of u like
4:16 why does he refrain from punching?
Seen better in Tesco car park...
Who is his opponent though? Absolute nobody - fell over. Sorry, but Benn  will be exposed as soon as he fights a credible opponent - a contender. Crawford would make mince meat of him. I guess the plan from Eddie is to wait until those guys retire
It's about time Connor faced a fellow undefeated fighter, instead of these washed up old names. Van heerdon was on his way to getting blitzed in his last fight with Boots Ennis, prior to the clash of heads. What little confidence he had left Boots took away from him
The ferocious punches remind me of Mike Tyson
One of my favourite fighters. Needs a proper fight though! That was lamb to slaughter!!
Van heerden here shows he its not a real  boxer but amateur boxer . He is  looks just tired that's it .
Another matchroom hype job, fighting old men and b class opposition. Shame, as his father was one of my favorite fighters of all time. Fought everyone. Conor needs to do the same.
Van heerden got Van hurten
I don't understand why all Connor Benn fights are with old guys at the end of there careers
Really like connors aggression although it does put in trouble at times he throws everything to hurt makes him exciting to watch
Com on Benn
I check for benn but he is so open for the over hand left and body shot.he keeps dipping to his right also.can be easily read.real talk but hope he goes far jus gotta use his stamina properly 😉
Conor needs a top name to cement him in the big time. Bags of ability, just has to prove himself on the big stage now. I think he is ready
Benn would be easy work for any top 20 welter. You just have to stop him getting his shots off with straight punches
Naseem Hamed was better
Benn is a total fraud in the game - big win streak against mainly relative no-ones. He'll always run from Florian Marku because he knows when that day comes he's going to get found out. Benn just another British media hype job
Is this the van heerden that was in McGregor camp for Mayweather
Has Benn had his chin tested yet? If not he will get found out by a better boxer soon.
Ah the Eddie Hearn fan club in the comments as per. Van Heerden has fought nobodies and his box rec record shows it and yet you all praise CB? Oh dear.
you can only beat what is in front of you, he will give any fighter a tough night, but let's be realistic, Spence and especially Crawford are way out of his capabilities. Both Garcia's could be too much for him, but he has a chance against them.
Chip off the old block ....well done conner ...I remember seeing ya dad in South London a few times....allways liked him...legend ..
Congratulations,  another great display. Such an enjoyable and exciting fighter to watch.
Its about time Benn start fighting some top welterweight. Van Heerden is not top level I expected him to win this.
Doesn’t his dad come to see his fights?
He’s a beast just like his dad!
Nothing impressive in the slightest. A paid punching bag for an overhyped fighter.
Reminds me of a young Amir Kahn in the sense that he goes looking to inflict damage on his opponent but take shots in the process. Coming up against the top fighters he could get hurt due to that.
Statement win by Conor in the 2nd  Big big nights to follow
Benn was clinical can now move onto world class opposition  Eddie said he will let off his shackles if he came through this one. And boy did he do that 🥊🥊
Happy Easter dazn thanks for quick upload of Saturdays action
Why doesn’t he fight gervota Davies?
His old man was one of my favourite fighters of all time. And this dude its becoming one too truly amazing how far hes come
When did Ben fight someone on the way up and not down
What a lousy ring announcer.
Sick of seeing benn fighting people who's like 8 years past either in 40s or pushing it should be fighting fighters who's young and hungry
How about stepping up to someone worthy now!
Marku 🇦🇱
Gotta be close to a title shot…electric
Conor is fighting beyond his peers. He's like a Mike Tyson in his weight class. He's well on his way to collect all the belts from the top guys with performances like this 👏🏾
Connor is magnificent  magical  and l love  ❤  every  bone in his body my kids laugh  at me they say you only  love him because  you absolutely  adored  his DAD  YES  SO WHAT
Is it just me or did anyone else get Mike Tyson vibes in this fight, not the power but overall movement from Conor
Benn is a Lil crybaby still in his nappies 🇬🇧🇨🇦🇺🇲🇪🇺💯
He's boxing wash-up boxers 💯🇪🇺🇺🇲🇨🇦🇬🇧
Amazing
Zero challenge
Ha ha he’s so like his dad ! . Wouldn’t surprise me if this lad goes all the way . He’s a warrior . Also think that he will become more dangerous when he gets hurt ! .
Connor is a warrior like his dad
Well done Connor benn but you could see heeden didn't wan t it by the end of the first
"Ilford... Essex"   Excuse me?
Punch bags.
Benn definitely has to calm himself down a lot.  He's got what it takes but must take more time and care.
DANGEROUS
Van Heerden had no intention of carrying on.None of Benn's shots were heavy handed.
Stay away from  Spence jr  Crawford  Boots Ennis  Keith Thurman  Can be a long night!
Like mini tyson hunger fast combo with lots of aggression 😊 he will be world champion  but key is patience
How you gonna fight this dude seriously with DAD pants. 🤣
He's only fighting bums like he's dad get destroyed when he meets a proper boxer .
Smaller version of his dad but doesn't load up on every single punch first time I have seen him hope he's not as chinny as his dad bless him thanks Nigel for all those exciting fight's
Just like his old man
Big difference in him and jaron Ennis, Conner benn fighting bums
Benn is another  English  Boxer  who will really  be Exposed when he fights  a Top Class  Opponent...
reminded me of mike tyson tonight just smaller,
What a JOKE of a so called fight!? 🤣 The same kinda erm...boxer his dad was calling Mexican roadsweepers/unemployed shepherd's!!! Hes now 20 fights in and even Nigel had done more with his career, sadly he's another typical 21st century fighter....cash cow for that ***** Hearn. Sad as I thought this kid would move with class and  stop fighting 🍅 can's .but it's all about the🤑💰with  this modern lot.
Benn is literally a little monster Mike Tyson.
Connor Benn is a brillant boxer and he shouldn't fight amir khan it wouldn't be close whatsoever walk over imo Benn needs to have more fights like this then he can begin to fight even bigger fighters
Future goat
When they stop cherrypicking Benn’s opponents & put him in with someone who’s going to test him only then will we see what’s he all about.
Let's see him against the elite
Still not ready to step up but looking better and better
Benn is naughty 👏🏾
Very exciting fighter always like watching him. He’s been watching Tyson videos and implementing the peak a boo! 💪👌
He strikes with such power he's definitely like his dad, let's hope he keeps on the right path to greatness
Marku beats Benn
You could tell straight away Conor was too much for him. Fighting is best form of defence.
Sorry but this kids going to get exposed soon
Still digging up inactive,shot,old fighters who can’t punch and serving them up to the young hungry athletic Benn ,, if you know anything about boxing the you know that this result was always going to happen as that’s what Van Herran was bought over for! There’s nothing to be excited  about here until Benn fights a ranked fighter! So to call him “World level”as Hearn does is wrong without Benn beating anyone that YOU’ve heard of …
Congratulations Conor....nice to see you adapt your game ....southpaws can be a nightmare for the best boxers...gotta a fan here.
Connor benn amazing fighter well done
Absolute beast. No one will cope with these bombs, Conor's going straight to the top and staying there, watch.
Whys he wearing  a skirt
Let's see eubank vs benn would love it
Connor entertaining fighter hope he takes to the top 🙌🏾🙌🏾
enjoy watching him as much as I did watching his dad, means business every time.
Could have told the out come two weeks ago. No more stooges give him a proper test.
His punch choice is better je woul pick brook apart 3 rounds
Conor benn vs eubank JR  Book it!!!!
His prey for Benn
Kell Brook should stay well away from Benn this kid is on the way up I'd love to see him up against ggg or someone of that caliber.
Looks like they need to find Benn some more worthy opponents...
Benn’s sloppy, will get caught eventually if he doesn’t adjust.
Why was this a step down to previous fights ? Broner next or a shot at the european title ?
Conor Ben reminds me of Mike tyson every time I see him fight
His da is my favourite non heavyweight of all time and the boy is entertaining!
You know the "I SAID THE TIME HAS COME"  surely that's a rip from DX and triple H? mind you the amount boxing takes from wrestling is massive, as is the opposite way...
Why put 3 minutes of ring announcements in a highlight video?
The destroyer is better than the dark destroyer and that’s saying something. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Conor awesome fight.
Benn smashes eubank easily
I was a big fan of Nigel Benn.  Hard as nails with a big heart. The more Coner progresses, the more he shows that not only can we compare him to his dad, he his showing signs he can exceeds his dad’s achievements. I honestly believe Coner will be world champion, as he has all the attributes to become one.  That was an impressive finish!
Florian Marku can give you lessons
Benn is a bit like Conor McGregor, he likes to beat on old men .
Like his old man before him, his aggression will be an asset and a curse,stay safe
Do enjoy Connor Benn fights. Always at full tilt. Would like to see if he can adapt and box clever with better opponents. Still these easier fights are so entertaining. He does remind me of his father who was also a real "Destroyer" on his rise through the ranks.
Benn vs Spence
Could Van Heerden have held his chin up any higher.
Nice editing speeding up and slowing down the fight!
Nice one Conor.
what's the crackle on audio so annoying
Thought he  wanted to fight the best in America
Highlights. LOL. Glad it made the second round though, the ring card girl was wooooooooooooo!!
Benn is a phenomenal fighter. Deserves every chance.
Mismatch.
He’ll be schooled big time by the Spence’ & Crawfords of this world, all hype
grew up watch nigel benn  idolised him  his son  gonna exceed him  im sure nigel  be proud
conor looks way more brutal than  his father u see the weavin  but power something else just better boxwe than nigel  soz  bro  i love u soooooooooo
"Highlights" 😂😂 Full Ring intros and full fight in 8 minutes lol
Let's all make out we know who Van Heerdan is just like the promoters want us to.
Benns corner: go out there and pretend it's your gf
He's doing g a lot more,and better than eubank,who at this rate will be 97 by the time he finally fights for a world title.
Benn is flat footed and drags himself across the canvas, his torso movement is limited and I'm afraid he's gonna fail at the highest levels
Impressed - Connor looked really hungry in this one. Well done pal.
Fraud needs to fight someone people have heard of and under 30 not even 10 percent the fighter his dad was even the names there talking all over 30 just Eddie protecting his only cash cow absolute joke
Conor is on the way to becoming an all time top pound for pound boxer.
Just another disgraceful mismatch put him with the real  top 5 boxers in the world and let the skills do the talking not the manufactured hype of the promoters just to make money
He’s not ready for the top dogs honesty he’s not,technically he’s awful
Just like there father's,Benn goes about his work quietly,Eubank runs around like he's the best.eubank senior was always present, Benn senior just in the background.
The true son of his father. I see everything in him I saw in Nigel.
Needs a step up in opposition now, Ortiz jr or Ennis 😎
Conor Benn v David Avanesyan would be a great fight 2022 💥🥊
Conor Benn is destroying his opponents like IRON MIKE every punch is thrown with ferocity and viciousness I like this boxing been missing spark like this since IRON MIKE TYSON
His dad was fireworks from the first bell, and Connor the same, he could do with some rounds but if you can spark em out early then why not....
Conor benn beats most in this division however when he comes up against a true world class boxer i think he will struggle with a plan B when he cant knock them out. I may be wrong but he needs another 2-3 fights before that..
Not sure if he’ll get to the pinnacle of the sport like his old man but there’s no denying his all action style is brilliant to watch…..
Why he avoid Florian Marku when he thinks is the best????
Keeps getting better and better. Go on conor🥊 Big salute from🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Little Benn strikes again... Super star🌟... 🇬🇧👏👏👏👏👏
Jaron Ennis vs benn would be great!
Fighter thesedays just bail as soon as they're hit... It's all about the💰💰💰
Conor Benn is one of the best
Conor is very impressive.  Great power in both hands and has learned the skills to go with it.  Will be a massive star attraction very soon
He goes in hard and leaves himself open.  He needs to learn to be more patient as if he doesn't get them out of there quick i think he may blow out.. Tibbs ain't a great trainer... time to move on Connor.
will be interesting who he faces next, i think he will need to travel and fight in the US. The top US fighters wont trust UK Ref or Judges, not a chance
Yet to fight some fresh top quality opposition.
Benn is an animal in the ring but id love to see him up against DA
Is this not the boy McGregor had in for sparring when he fought Mayweather?
Why do black dudes get tattoos? What’s the point.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree
Looks like a mini Tyson at times. Big fan.
he needs a big fight now
Decent fight. Stop fighting nobodies and start fighting some decent fighters. 20 fights and not a decent name on ur record.
From a boxing point of view, Conor is a con, but from  a business point of view, he is making the right moves.
Conor Benn v David Avanesyan would be a great fight 2022 💥🥊
When is he gonna fight a brother then 🤷 Loves beating up on ageing white boys
is there any welter weight with as much power as Connor Benn?
Devastating finisher.
😂🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Easy money 💷
Conner can't rat shiys like that when he steps up, looks exciting and Impressive l, but he won't get away with that defence against better aponents
Conner Ben what a beast he's got the tec and the power
Conor choose The most weakest opponent
Chris can Derheeren fair do's, he came out for the 2nd round at least!
kels will school him
Conor Benn is sweet as a nut
Conor Benn ducks and weaves like a mini iron mike tyson
Did any1 else see a young mike Tyson in that ring? That was impressive
Impressive.. but I'd like to see him fight better quality boxers now. Time to step it up.
Young lion vs old  lion.  🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
I love to watch Conor fight 🥊🥊
Eddie hearn conning the public again when is Benn actually going to fight a fighter and not has beens
Conor gonna eat everyone at his weight for breakfast
Chip off the old block
I said he wouldn't go 2 rounds ...
As soon as he steps up to British level, I think he gets found out, I’m a huge fan but we can’t get hyped by Connor knocking over someone who has been retired for two years
Benn is roofless. Fair play
Make him fight a decent fighter
Benn is so open especially on the inside . Top fights will connect. How ever he's a great watch a bit like Hatton.
Conor is Wild - like a mini Tyson.
Very awkward looking apponent but he keeps blowing them away
Benn vs Broner in the UK. Now that is a fight I would be going to.
I wanna see conor benn smash jake paul
He's 25. Let's just enjoy his career.
Can we have a live opponent next time please
Nice
6 years a pro and still not boxed for  ANY title. British Commonwealth European never mentioned 😯😲
I cnt lied he change my Mind he gonan be better den he’s dad he got he dad natural raw power and ability but Conor got the better skill set
Every punch thrown by Benn is packed with bad intentions — like father, like son!  Thankfully, there's been no signs of Conor needing the same powers of recovery Nigel showed, getting so many wins after first getting wobbled himself.
He seems to be copying his dads style a lot more nowadays, same type movement in the ring and hard fast hooks, worryingly he also has his lack of defence as well, something he needs to work on, the big hitters will hurt him when he fights the big boys.
I can see Conor going far in his career such a talented young man
CONER ONE BANGS AVANESYAN - THAT FIGHT IS A MISSMATCH
Connor is a monster 👹
DAZN SHOULD DO KAHN VS BRONER - WINNER FIGHTS BENN
A lot of empty seats here
I heard eddies his next opponent
No hate but aside from throwing big bombs, Benn was getting outboxed. Sure it didn't last but better fighters won't go so easily. Glad he won though but I really wish he'd have a word with Jason Pirillo about managing his emotions.
Wants amid Khan next, it's getting embarrassing, absolutely ducking ava
Give him Ortiz or marku let’s see what he got
He needs to move up and fight the best, he is ready.
hes got florian marku thinking twice about fighting him
Was Chris there to be knocked out?
Surely Benn needs a world title fight. How long will it take
Benn is a bit too wild. Against a measured opponent, he may come unstuck.
He’s on he way to becoming Englands pound for pound number 1 fighter 👏🏾👏🏾
A problem for anyone
To much power in them hands!
ONLY 1 CONNOR 💯 🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊🥊 TEAM BENN ALL THE WAY
You can just see that familiarity of his old man in him at some points, when he's dodging especially,  looking forward to what's next for him.
Love this guy
Well done Conor amazing again
Even the commentators are in on the hype, this is getting kind of silly now,  people who really know boxing will know this is a farce, before you say anything boxed as an amateur from 11 to 25 years old and watched boxing all my life. Whoever thinks he isn't over hyped need to research about levels in boxing. He is fighting way below his current level. Milking it from the fans who don't really know much but like to see one sided beat downs.
Respect to the guy for showing fair play at the end
The time has cume 4 a total mismatch sack that man
Think this van heerdan guy is not telling his real age 🤔
absolutely fantastic connor your going all the way bro 💯 % well done congrats
Shouldn’t be fighting on main events fighting washed fighters and be fighting another on next in Broner or Khan past it and both in wrong weight devision it’s crazy fight Marku adasayan Ennis Thurman Garcia josh kelly even Chris Kongo 😂
David Avanesyan should be his next opponent but Eddie is to scared .David has a history of destroying Brits .
I think old man brook beats him easily.
He fights like this guy just ran his dog over so spiteful.  Amazing.
Hes wild and takes too many punches to go up to the next level for me, but you never know.
Another nobody defeated to further pad out his record, he needs to stop fighting old men and no bodies.
Composed? Wildly swigging with poor footwork. He will stand a chance against brook. His a power puncher I’ll give him that but when he starts fighting higher level he will get found out.
You can only beat what's put in front of you, but this guy has been inactive for 2 years,  he fought Mathew Hatton nearly a decade ago. Benn is an exciting fighter but it's time to step up imo.
Benn vs Boots - best of the prospects would like to see that
Connor was taking shots in the first round, very sloppy. He'd have been hurt if that was a world level opponent, love the guy but still work to be done.
As expected when are u going to fight someone
Just a sham of a fight, benn fighting nobodies
People will always criticise and knit pick flaws, “he’s coming in with his chin exposed”. “He’s too erratic”. Why not praise his strengths.. speed, accuracy and power. On top of that he entertains and I think he’ll be a very tough guy to beat for anyone. Errol Spense, Crawford finally have some serious competition. Exciting times.
brutalizing these dudes;  connor is the real deal lotta critics need to be more perceptive
I wanna see some proper fight, this is as boring. Conor benn vs Gervonta Davis next
I wonder if people will start putting more respect on the kids name now
Conor deffo isn’t beating any Legit world champs at welterweight.
Van heerden been over the hill a long time what a joke 🤦🏼‍♂️
Wow another KO over another non puncher. Where will this llllllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnngggggggggg journey take ud
Slugger Benn - like his dad!
Conor is a beast.
he went down to early to me didnt even touch him hardly
Boring fight, Coner Ben only fight under his level.
Absolute pathetic giving this kid a string of washed up fighters. The day he fights someone elite who is at their peak he will walk onto shots with this wild style.
some say the army use benn branded missiles
Loved watching his dad, wondered how Conor’s career would pan out. Going well, very entertaining.
4 corners of the world 🤣🤣🤣🤣
19th December 2020 was van Heerden's last fight, he's 34 yrs old, looked 44 tbh, and this was the best they could get for Benn? What a farce, I'm all for looking after up and coming fighters, but even Benn must be frustrated with the quality of the opposition that his team are putting in front of him. Personally, I'm disappointed, Benn deserves to be in a ring with opponents who are at least in the top 20. He needs to be tested.
Wow
Champ 🏆
The destroyer
Embarrassing opponent
Conor benn is sharp as his fade
Props to whoever is doing the “highlights”. Also we’ll done to Conor, it was clear what his intention was as soon as the second round started, it’s an absolute peach of tactic, just jab low until to right to the head presents itself. Was so clear I’m surprised it wasn’t noticed. But another great finish of the next step up in competition. I think we have now arrived at big boy time. Conor is at world level now, he might not be the best, but he’s up at that level and only time will tell
Gotta be one of the most entertaining fighters out of the UK right now!!👊🏾🔥🇬🇧
Conor Benn will be a world champion.
Never heard of Benn's opponent, he's been boxing for 16 years and I've never heard of the guy!  So another "top class" opponent for Connor!  And can someone please tell the ring announcer to stop saying the fighters name twice!
Benn is going to get brutally knockout out coming in like that
Yea fighting a old man ya coward
Great fight again! Deserves a lot more credit and less hate! Keep going champ 🥊
Can't fault him. He's getting in fights against experienced guys whilst he is still young (25) and inexperienced compared to the guys at the top.   Kell Brook would be another step up. That'll be a great fight to make.
What’s the song playing in between rounds?
Amazing performance. I'd love to see him fight David Avanesyan next.
Seems red shorts wasn't a worthy opponent
CB is the most exciting fighter at present. love his style
It is history in making that we will witness the Benn&Eubank mark2  in the near Future... 🥊🥊
So Eddie has a laugh at Frank Warren for putting on a poor show for the fury whyte fight and his got one of his main fighters beating up  34year old bums that ain't had a fight in almost 2 years 🤔
Great performance.... Like this lad
Connor is learning as fighter. You could see the intention of footwork in this
Inspired by his late father. Commentator needs to choose his words more carefully mind
Round ones a WAR!!!!!
Mismatch
Powerful man
Caught to head multiple times, that would be punished by a harder hitter or better fighter. Great win however
I really enjoy what I've seen from Benn and hope to see his development continue. It will be very necessary at the higher levels as there are some  welterweights that are dangerous on the back foot and will exploit his open offensive attacks.
Come on Dazn; that was the full fight "fight highlights" - too modest 😎
Needs to step up the competition now, we know he can look like a monster against these unknowns. Let’s see him fight at European level.
Conor can never win 😂 flattens people in 2 rounds or goes the distance yet people still slate him. this geezer is going places enjoy the moment man 👍🏻
Easy money for the south African. Take the fall 🤣
Conor has improved a lot.
Hype job
Fight of the year in my opinion.
He HAS to fight a live opponent next. I know the game of building a fighter up but he’s fought enough of this calibre of fighter now.
After Tyson Fury Possibly the best British fighter outheir…we’ve got our own Mike Tyson 🇬🇧
Benn is a dangerous, powerful guy.
Cabbages
Any chance of matching Benn with someone whos not over the hill anytime soon ??they talkin Broner next 😫😡😡 Avanesyan is a perfect fight for him ,likely win but hard hard nights work
Definitely going to be the dark horse of the division. A few of the other stars you’d say are better technically than Conor but you can’t deny that power. That changes the landscape in all of his upcoming fights against these guys
Give him ave next then? It’ll sell, Eddie sold this fight and the others where the opponent was a tomato can ffs. He knows Benn doesn’t want the work, it’s a Shame because Benn wants them all and Eddie wants to protect his 0.
He's being very carefully matched. You just know he's going to get sparked out as soon as he moves up in class.
What a fighter Connor has turned into. Very exciting to watch
People saying about him stepping up to elite level etc. Going off Connor. I don't think it's him that doesn't want that to happen. He would of done that in his first fight if he was allowed to lol. He's an angry and aggressive little man. That just wants to scrap and he'll scrap anyone. Which is what you want from a boxer. He's exciting to watch. Nobody can disagree with that. Even the ones saying he will come unstuck against the next level of fighters. You still love to watch him as well. Yeh he gets caught every now and then but so does every single Elite fighter too if you watch them. Against opponents that respect them way too much because of their status. So they pull their punches unlike Benn would. He doesn't care if you new, washed up or in your prime. He's coming at you. Which is exciting but no doubt intimidating for his opponents.
That reminded me of his dad
wow he has an incredible career ahead of him the rest of the division should be worried very worried he is clearly in a class of his own Mark my words he is going to knock them all out he is special..
Oh wow he beat a nobody what a result and then him and Eubank talk about fighting Brook an over the hill boxer these 2 are an embarrassment to there fathers
It’s time for him to face the Albanian   See where he’s at
Would be great to see the legacy live on in these two offsprings of benn and eubank start from where their fathers left off.
Him being the same as his father will be his downfall.... I love nigel benn and yes connor is also exciting... but someone with more skills and heavy hands will expose him
A throwback of tge 90s trip down memory lane of his dad
Benn needs better opponents. Let’s not AJ him
We all want a trilogy of benn vs eubank junior
Even Errol Spence took 8 rounds to get a younger Van Heerden out of there!! Big fan of Benn
Average fighter too wild would get punished by the fighters at the top of the division
Another bin man beat up
Pleased for him that he doesn't now have to live in his dad's shadow. He's wreckless but not as wreckless as his dad, he hits fairly hard but not concussive like his dad so he'll get some success in his career, just stay away from the American slicksters they'll eat you up like they ate his dad.
He’s dad would be disgusted he got beat like that
Benn is so quick, looks as though he’s in fast forward.
Absolute tank 👊
Typical British hype hand picked apponent
Now go and put that Albanian out of his misery conor. He won't stand 6 rounds with you.
Overhyped against past it fighters will get run over by a real world level operator no problem.
Great win for Conor, however, think he needs a big name in his division next, and then he's the real deal.
Seemed like a fix
He needs a few more before I’m convinced…😂
Wonder where Harley Benn disappeared to?
Time to step up please!! They keep talking about a higher calibur of oppenents but it hasn't happened yet.
Connor been fights exactly like his dad his bobbing and weaving his footwork and his punches if i never knew it was his son i would be able to tell by the way he fights
All tin can fighters and we all know it
Crazy first round and it looked like van Heerden was having some success by anticipating Benns bobbing and ducking - throwing short uppercuts to catch him as he came in.  However, Benn looked a lot more measures in the 2nd and picked his shots better.  Great fight.
Hearn's hype of Benn shows his plot, loss he says; 'Benn is an elite Welterweight.' He isnt even the best in the UK. Hes a domestic level fighter. Thats all his record shows. He needs to fight someone who can punch and win the fight then we will see his level.
The Americans are aware of Benn. So he's making it on to their radar. He's doing what he's asked to do..we'll see how it pans out.
I’m so happy to hear david diamante’s voice again
Benn is very wild, potential to be great
Ok I’m convinced, Benn’s ready for southern area 🙄
I didn't see one clean punch landed In the finishing sequence all glancing blows van heerdens reaction was over the top seemed to false to me
Fight Boots or Ortiz then……
Thought this would be a tougher test than it was, credit where it’s due to Benn. He’s doing it
Ben looking very sharp
The difference between Connor and Eubank JR is night and day. I can get behind Connor anytime. I hope they fight. It will be something to watch.
I've never seen Benn punch with this level of power. Also bobbin weaving on entry ala Mike Tyson, working beautifully
He didn’t want to know
Nice performance, he's a bit of a handful.
Like a mini Mike Tyson 👊🏿
Very impressed with the finish by Connor Benn in that fight. Not easy fighting a southpaw. He's still improving and proving the doubters wrong. You can only fight what's put in front of you. A future world champion  in the making. Well done Connor. Love it.
Connors a lovely lad his dad was a British legend in boxing and a excellent fighter........but I keep on getting the feeling when I watch him fight....that If he steps into the top 5-6 in his division.....he's gonna struggle......but still decent fighter nonetheless......
Still wild but getting better.
Excellent stoppage. He has the power like his dad but more skill. For all the haters, he is getting looked after and so he should be. He is young and still learning and getting more n more experience and then moving to fight more seasoned and challenging opponents as it should be. I hope in next two years he has a legit title shot after a few more proper tests. Wish the guy all the look as deserves it
can you pls find connor a proper opponent!
Taught i was watching Tyson
Benn can only beat what’s in front of him which he’s doing but let’s be honest he’s fought nobody as yet. Yes he’s improving and exciting but until he goes toe to toe with a proven fighter then we will know all about him Errol Spence Jnr and Terrence Crawford would destroy Benn and that’s who he has to try and fight not a old Kell Brooke ffs 🥊🥊🥊🥊
He’s getting better yes but as soon as he gets up among the top guys in the welterweight he will come up short. I am talking Spence Crawford Jarron Eunnis etc
Getting better an more devastating every fight, can only wish him well
All the armchair experts 😂 pretty sure his management and trainers and dad know what the are doing.
He'll be world champ, no doubt, speed, power and it looks like he can take a punch as well
Didn’t respect van heerden in the first round and got caught wayy too much but as soon as he did, absolutely sensational. For me the most exciting Brit fighter now
Yes Connor!! Coyi!!!!!
Mr Ben C is definitely a force at 147. However, I want him to be a gentleman as he has always been and staying patient and kind in the profession so as to increase in strength and insight about life, boxing and family life. Without mothers and women in life there is no us. We are the living bible with grace and truth in every on being. I love this win and he deserves a shot at the title if he needs it. Being a true brit, I don't want him to be rushed because boxing is a science however life is the science one must understand first. There are levels to enhancing your physical tools and it definitely requires patience and hours in any 12 hour period to ascertain.
Conor is looking dangerous, he's improved so much. My personal favorite at the moment he practices what he preaches.
Benn looks like he is improving!
This is literally where the term 'goes in head first' came from.
It's time, he needs to fight an elite fighter or go for a World Title!!
Benn is clinical!!! Can only beat what’s put in front of you and every time it’s been convincing!!!
Has this video been very slighty sped up?
Elite level? Haha. Ffs. Imagine this guy in with Spence? The fight wouldn't go 5 rounds.
Definitely an entertainer like his dad
Power in them hands is scary
Benn is getting better for sure hopefully he meets someone who can take the heat and can ice Benn if he makes mistakes.
Barely any amateur fights under Connor and he is doing us proud 🇬🇧
Who's next the bin man, road sweeper or Ricky fatton .. e.hearn is a disgrace making excuses for not fighting David An
Dad will be proud 💯 lovin the benn movement! Awsome , exciting and explosive 🧨
These pundits saying benn has to be carefull not with a chin like ke he has and power he has
Needs to step up and get in with quality fighters not these punching bag fighters
So many ex world champions giving their view. We are so lucky to have them.
AJs wheels have come off and Dazn need a new hype job. Dazn can't afford Canelo anymore
All them hard learnt lessons have really put benn in a nice position! All the stick he got was justified and he took in on board like a absolute class act. CMON BENN 💙💙💙
The guys relentless
I like Conor Benn, hopefully he makes it all the way.
Conner is a credit to his dad and a excellent, exciting fighter. I'm not sure he can beat the top 6 in this very strong division  but can't wait to see him try.
Content looks sped up
Connor Ben is like a young Mike Tyson 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Benn is getting better for sure!! He does need to cover up more though as better fighters would punish him coming in recklessly....but he can improve that
Seriously certain boxing fans are just arseholes. Every single fighter follows the same path to a World Title, they fight whoever they can until they get a title fight and that's when the hard fights come. It's a career and if any one of us were capable of doing what they do, we would take the path that led to the most money over risking our health over a load of strangers idea of what makes a great Boxer.
mismatch for mug punter money.
Benn lighting fast
Fights like his dad , but doesnt try to be his dad like that beaut eubank jr
This is the first boxer that is getting more and more dangerous in every fight’ WOW
The amount of people getting carried away is a JOKE! He hasn’t fought one decent fighter, let alone European level, or even the likes of Virgil Ortiz. Forget about Thurman, Ugas and Garcia 😂 oh and he wont achieve 50% of what Khan did in his career
Benn was awfull mhe was slow on his feet flat footed had his feet too far apart. He was rushing his work his punches were all predictive because he was loading up. This was a soft knockout and the opponent was a binman
If he keeps increasing his knock out ratio like this, then he’ll automatically get exposure for the big times , was a huge fan of his dads.. he has the fire in him too
Why dont they give him someone who can punch hard
anyone who thinks he's going to have it that easy against the likes of Danny Garcia,   Keith Thurman, Erroll Spence Jr or Terence Crawford are delusional. They want Khan next who looked terrible in his last fight !
While benn is a talented fighter and very exciting to watch, unfortunately for him he is in a stacked welterweight division which is full of elite world class fighters. That aggressive come forward style will not work against the likes of Bud and spence they would pick him apart, and Ortiz would simply outgun him. That being said, I only ever thought he'd make it to British level and he proved me wrong! so maybe he will again.
Benns got sone scary power. Bone crunching hands 😎👍🥊
David Avanesyan is waiting for Benn
Once he fights better competition he's not winning 🤣. Their going to bulid benn up fighting bums
It's time to step up now for conor...I recon he will beat the top of the top in his devision but not without a struggle
Be nice to see him face some stiff competition
He might actually step up one day instead of fighting worn out fighter's
Benn is just like his dad. Never in a boring fight. But you just know there is a chris eubank out there who will punish his wild shots in the later rounds. But to be fair nigel got better after he lost and connor seems like he would learn and be like his dad
I'm gonna put it out there I think he's gonna be better than his dad, felt he rushed it there at times swinging abit but hey the just my opinion and I'm not a boxer but he's one of my favourite fighters, love his confidence and style
All the fan boys here. Benn leaves himself open a lot. He took a lot of hits in his first round, but congratulations.
He was a tad desperate for a KO, I was shouting establish the jab and after he did that, it all came naturally.  Anyway, he needs top tier competition enough of these bums they are there to increase his 0, Hearn do your job.
I like boxing, but why is Benn wearing that ridiculous skirt type thing ?😂😂
who
Like benn but at end what punch did the damage once its slowed down
Everyone saying the level of competition is trash, did Spence Jr not go 8-9 rounds with this same guy at around the same age as Benn is now? Ok, Heerden is a bit older now but still. Benn is 20 something fights in and 25 years old, still growing.
Why you think your fighting in Manchester for ? Campbell Hatton got big fans they too the crowd you couldn’t fill York hall unless ya dad was there
Connor wake up ya been used to make money ffs
Mis match of the year
Mike tyson prodigy  lol absalute killer well  done Connor 👏 ✔ 👍
Tell u what,if Connor Benn catches any of the top fighters clean he'll deck any of them. He is a machine
Another tomato can
Need to see him fight Brook or Avenesyan next, the ways he’s been blasting guys out recently he’s definitely ready for the next level..
Is definitely Nigel son alright
Wow, congrats Conor. Onwards and upwards, and ignore all the haters.
Started to fight more like his old man!
Man said give me any opening and I will make you pay BOOM! destroyed.
Lol commentators
Well done Conor son 🥊
I still think Brook would beat him
We’ve seen this storyline before , a matchroom hype job that gets exposed
I think some people refuse to give Conor the credit he deserves. That was clinical!.. absolutely destroyed him.
Conor need sirius boxer this boxer is joke
No wonder Hearns is keeping him far away from Avenesian,he will blow him away.
Top top fighter!!
That commentator is amazing “I SAID THE TIME HAS COME”
Nigel Benn was exciting and a bit wild to watch. Young Conor is developing the same style. Great fight and finish  Benn needs better quality opponents now, time to move up the ranks and take on the serious challengers.
Well done Connor fantastic performance
He is ready for a title shot
From the beginning I’ve enjoyed his fights. Different level of energy, the guy is 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
All of a sudden a shopkeeper appeared
No nonsense, get the job done.
What an absolute beast
21-0 now so it’s about time he fight a young contender
News flash!!!! Conor benn just called out felix trinidad for the o.a.p silver belt 🤣
Chris van is suppose to be that homeless guy but he’s out here mixing it with the best. Respect
This is becoming a joke now!! Fighting these washed up nobody's and acting like he's just knocked a prime pac man out, connor you've been turned into a cash cow and made to look a fool by the biggest 🛎🔚 in boxing, EDDIE HEARN. Do yourself a favour and get a new promoter
Dosser
Looks fixed to me, he took a dive...
Explosive..
Not a lemon please 🤪
Another fight Hearn saying it will be close then benn winning easy, find a half decent opponent
HE IS A BETTER STYLE FIGHTER THAN HIS DAD.............LIKE TO SEE HIM FIGHTING EUBANKS JUNIOR>>HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF......
34 year old with 12 kos from 28 wins,  no power etc, east win, id win that fight too, give us a proper fight, not Journey men
Benn is doing what he has to do. I don't respect how his team are not putting him with proper competition. This guy he fought was pouring his Jab yet alone head straight up in the air and easy to hit. How can you be top 10 if you haven't even fought for a European or commonwealth title. Yet alone fight veterans way out of their prime or early stoppages. Its not going to go well if he loses up the next level. At least josh kelly fought David and lost and we know where his level is. Benn needs to stop kidding himself as he's just beat old fighters atm. I don't blame him entirely as I know how difficult boxing promotions are these days to make fights because fighters get locked into contracts of who they can and can't fight. I think everyone is just frustrated we just want to see him fight someone near his age in their prime in the top ranks. That's when he will get creditability.
When's conor going to get , serious fight    🤔  think its about time ..
Almost that tyson peak a boo style 👌
Fight highlights? You mean full fight 🤦‍♂️
Loved his dad and can see bits in him though he looks like a scrappy fighter. Up against paper weights he can blast out. Slams his feet down to plant them and any top boxer would pick up on this. Bit of a brawler. Hatton was a brawler but with technique. This just looks like confidence building and money making and can't see him getting to the top as much as I don't want to say it.
Whys everyone tryna hate on Khan lol the guy was an absolute beast in his prime and tbh he should have a retirement fight then call it a day.
Exciting fighter.... his confidence is up... loves to finish.... the tops bots beat him. Spence, Crawford, Ennis, D Garcia
Hearn is absolutely having a laugh at all of us
Enough with the bums now, give him a proper challenge, and that aint Khan lol, Brooke maybe... but still...
Gutted
There's no pleasing some, if he  boxed clean and tidy and went the distance he'd be boring and criticized.... He's doing well...give the guy a pat on the back. 👊👊
Benn V's Eubank I wouldn't mind watching,
Give him a pope fightr and he would be on the canvas ... no skill!
Can’t stand Ben
Love the Benns but this is a joke lol
Needs to be more disciplined, the knockouts will come eventually.
Conor Benn should go to the world title fight.
Where's the British title? Commonwealth? Even European title dat I watch most fighters collecting on their way to world title,I like benn but how r we supposed to know his level wen these r his opponents
great stuff Conor!!!!
The dark tomato can destroyer does it again.ffs👎
'The Destroyer' Is Right, Conor's not messing around is he!!! 👊👊💯
Talk about walking into shots. However, on to the next.
How about you put him in with someone with a pulse?  Tin can killer.... He'd be flattended by danny garcia
Conor's definitely a crowd pleaser like his old man. Fights like him to. Wish him the best on his journey. He puts in the hardwork and takes the sport seriously unlike some.
I found the inevitability quite unappealing tbh.
Serious power. Want him to do well but looks like he could be out boxed with how open he is
All he can do is bang. Once Eddie dares to step Benn up he will get destroyed.
Let's see him fight against Adam aziz
Looked like a tricky night for Connor but then he connected. BOOOOM.
What did that man do to Conor!?🤣
Pointless fight
Amir would get killed by Benn at this stage Brook to but he’s wild still not top level no way but he is a crowd puller yes.
Benn did enough, but that's not a world title shot,  there is much more work to be  done if he wants to be a top man, like his old man !
Dazn always come with the quick quality highlights 👏🏻 And Benn is a beast💪🏻
When Conor batters people is proper entertainment 🤣👌....mad anger when he Explodes 💥🤛🔥💨💨💨💨💨
The way he stand and throws a punch if top 5 hits him his legs r gone
Don't hate congratulate well done Connor smashed it and beat him up🥊🥊🥊
Certainly can bang like the old man
What an absolute animal
Milk  the hype job.
I knew Ben would blast him in early rounds.  He seriously needs to step it up Mikey Garcia, Brook, Danny Garcia one of these guys will actually test him.
A dive come on man ?
Can’t wait to see how Benn handles a real opponent. Another tomato can down!
If you wanna watch real welterweight upcoming talent watch Stanionis vs Butaev, Ben is a joke who fights old boxers, that lad doesn't want real smoke
What a joke of an opponent Benn did well but only because he was fighting the energiser bunny, guy was hopping about like he was plugged in lol
Fk me am I watching Tyson savidggggjjj
He’s exciting and like his dad, he’s either gonna knock ‘em out or get knocked out but he’ll  be fun to watch
Mike bennson tonight
K nuff nonsense now. Bring on Avanesyan
This lad is intense and is heading to the top
A slick boxer puncher would do Conor in beating an over the hill van heerden and calling it ‘easy work’ thinking you’ve done something is nonsense go fight someone who’s on a winning streak atleast
conor fights so much like tyson throwing wild. no guard . Hes asking for someone to knock him sparko ,  dont get me wrong but he will get found out with a proper opponent
Am I missing something or does Coner walk into things with his head far too exposed?
Benn is too active for Kell Brook..
Knocked him out faster than this upload 🤣
Benn Needs to be tighter next fight. Too wild. Took couple of steps back in this one in my opinion. At this level that will get him caught.
A nightmare of intensity for anyone
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 S/O DAZN for the quick upload! .. Appreciated … That boy Conor reminds me so much of his dad … boy could they both have a tear up … fast becoming one of my favourite fighters
Aint helping him if he’s getting no punches thrown at him , Virgil Ortiz can bang!
Against anyone decent Benn gets schooled. He will blow himself out and get clipped often
Big up to the Benn family
I like my highlights like I like my knockouts.  Sharpish
Great work thanks
Great accuracy and footwork from benn he just keeps getting better
Never even knew this fight was happening
Say what you want, Benn is getting better with every fight. A lot of people are going to have a dry mouth when he has a title belt around his waist.
Conner is a savage!! I want him to take out them charlo clowns next, would make my year!
Dangerous puncher but still a bit wild and needs to tighten up defence against the top guys counters.
Why am I paying money to DAZN when everyone gets this for free 🤣🤣
Benn, defensive offense, head movement, throw power shots once you’re closer inside the pocket. Periodically work behind the jab. Lacking these things are gonna hurt at higher levels. Keep that 0 with realistic foresight ✌️👏🏻🥊
The way Benn was throwing wild shots he will be out of gas after a few rounds if he does that against a top name he will be the one getting ironed out
The fight Vs khan should be boycotted by the fans. That fight is a waste of everyone's time
Van heerden looks like pulevs son 😂
Embarrassing opponent. 20 seconds in a ring in 3 years. Stop ducking Avanysan Marku and Mckinson. They are all there for you to fight in the UK and known so stop making excuses they don't generate enoguh when you are fighting Van Heerden ffs. Instead we'll get shot to bits Danny Garcia, Kahn or Adrian Broner. Hearns new Golden goose 21 fights and completely swerved the British, Commenwealth and European titles. Give it a couple more walkovers and a vacant title will pop up.
Avenesyan next the boxing public have been wanting that fight for a while now. Nobody wants to see Amir Khan after his last performance Conor will smoke him easy
come on no more bin men please this would was at least 200 years old lol i give up.
Looks just like his old man in attack mode. !!!
Thank you dazn
Hearn doesn’t want to give Benn a serious test loool, calling Khan washed then saying he’s a possible opponent for Benn next.
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
Wen him ponce promoter gonna put imm in a real fight?
A killer
Pay for it, or watch it on Dazn's Twitter ten minutes later, or YouTube an hour later.
Typical matchroom stoppage. Just count the ten. All waving the fight off stuff is nonsense. Reminds me of when AJ was coming up n refs used to wave his fights off at the 1st chance
Bling boy Benn,with the gold medalion
Congratulations Harvey Price
Double quick
go on fight actual competetion bro. stop fighting uber drivers
fair play for quick uploading of highlights
Too easy time for bro to level up
