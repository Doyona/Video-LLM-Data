Something like "greenhouse gassess" doesn't even exist...this is a FASHION not a real science! By using *PV=nRT* we can calculate that CO2 add only *0.06°C* to the atmospheric budget. Wish i could talk to **@kurzgesagt** and teached him the TRUTH! He could make GREAT video!
I was a vegetarian for 8 years and just recently started eating meat again. I don't judge anyone for eating meat, as the mistreatment of animals and CO2 emissions are more a product of the systems we live under than individual choices.   However, I can say that there are trade offs for eating meat vs. not eating it. I felt like a burden as the only veggie in most social gatherings and I would have to either bring my own food or they would make something separate for me. I also was missing out on a lot of food I really enjoyed, though the social aspect was by far the hardest and the reason I quit. On the other hand, eating meat makes me feel sluggish and gassy and it's much more expensive. I also feel less guilty when I abstain from meat since I dont have to worry as much about how my choices are harming other creatures and supporting a predatory system.  In the end, I decided to eat veggie at home and eat meat when I'm out with people or if I'm just especially craving it. I probably only eat meat 2-3 times a week now as opposed to some people who have it for every meal (though I tend to eat more meat when Im visiting family). I think the hardest part about being vegetarian is how strict it is. It's very much an all or nothing lifestyle, and I think that instead of pushing that we should push meat reduction. Because even if you have one less meal with meat each week, if more people did that it would have a huge impact.
It's already been told climate change load of bollox one min it's getting to cold then too hot then cold now we are in the too hot stage 🤣   Live the life excaust resources for and repeat   Also all the renewabyenergy needs oil 🤣
Who is watching this in 2025
Get lost, bugs for your guys and meat for us, not the opposite.
As a 21 years vegetarian, I wonder how much emissions I've negated going into the atmosphere by not eating cows. *Does some quick math. Wow, about 20,000 pounds of emissions were not put into the atmosphere because of me. That's pretty neat.
What to eat that's not the key problem, the population is. Just simply reduce the population.  You can eat 1000kg of ribeye per year and it won't generate any emissions.
I thought it said "meth"
IT'S TEXAS'S FAULT
even if you guys are not personally bias, most studies are incomplete and are made to shape a narrative a certain way for profiteering reasons. Values can change drastically depending on multiple factors and cannot be easily quantified. They can definitely be misconstrued without difficulty. Without proper full transparency and scrutiny, they cannot be trusted
A couple things with this video. Firstly, while a lot of food goes into feeding animals, especially for animals like cattle and sheep a good portion of that is waste, stuff like wheat chaff that us humans can't digest anyway. So either it goes to waste and decompose, or it's fed to animals. Most animal food which humans can eat, thus is actually taking up dedicated space, is fed to non ruminants like pigs and chickens.  However more importantly, while the destruction of land for cattle raising is bad, and obviously something to be opposed to: the CO2 released cattle was literally already in the atmosphere: plants sequester CO2 turning it into glucose, cellulose etc., which is then eaten and processed by animals, turning it into CO2 or methane. Even then, not all of it, as some of it just goes into the animal's own biomass. And while yes methane is worse, as you mentioned this is solvable by feeding cattle better diets.  People often hail biofuels as a carbon neutral, renewable energy source, despite essentially following the exact same process but with combustion rather than respiration. Every gram of CO2 released by biofuels and animals was in the atmosphere originally anyway less than a few months beforehand: compare that with fossil fuels where we're adding it directly to the atmosphere from underground reserves.  So, the only CO2 equivalent actually added to the atmosphere due to meat production is due to poor standards and poor land protection, not due to meat having some inheritant issue.
It almost sounds like there are too many humans on the planet who have to be fed.
All this made me hungry 😅😅😅

Not gonna stop eating meat 🍖
Go vegan ❤!!
Meat is as bad as veg and just as good.  We are omnivores. This means we need both for a healthy diet. Meat provides the proteins that veg/plant based doesn't, and vice versa.  It's why vegans really annoy me, acting like their morally superior. You are just unhealthy weirdos who need supplements from man made "plant based" products to stay healthy. (By the what "plant based" doesn't mean it contains any plant materials what so ever it just means vegan friendly, which means it contains no meat, it's more slogan than fact)   I'll sit here, eat my lamb Sunday roast veg included, and live a long prosperous life.... while you vegans wallow in a boring life eating crap nobody actually likes and thats why you copy meat based like "vegans bacon" 😂🤦‍♂️ pathetic.   But seriously get a life. Just because we eat meat to stay healthy doesn't mean we don't feel bad. But im not putting man made garbage in my body.
I believe we should go vegan. But it's a process!!!! First try taking a few meat free days. then if you want, go vegetarian. then, if you want, phase out dairy. then eggs. But it's alright, you can still be a vegan even if you eat honey.
What if we created the cows with a air filtering sistem that suck the metane produced and trowed it at the space with magnet launched spacecrafts
i watched this video 2-3 years ago and just read a book about this topic yesterday so i rewatched this again and damn , its true
Could you make 1 sponsored add instead of 2 togeather or at the least spread them apart? Former is less painful to watch whole.
The only solution is GO VEGAN 🌱
Things die and us eating it or other animal eating another, is preventing waste and a good use of energy.
There was a chemical that when added to cow’s feed significantly reduce methane production, can you also do a video on agroforestry? Seems cool but i dont see how it wouldnt massively impact productivity
thankfully, India is 0% beef production🥳
ive been vegan for 7 years
Ahh fresh meat
In Nigeria farmers are killed by herders with guns over land for grazing
Mee thane
The vegan agenda certainly used that as "proof" of their surperiority, still missing the point that humans have always been omnivores.
I feel like this information proves that it really doesn’t matter what you do because you’re still only one person out of 8 billion
In summary: Humanity is totally on the wrong track. The worst thing is that while our mistakes and bad solutions are obvious, we can still ignore anything for our short-term interests. Is that really all we can do? Unfortunately, yes.
I am vegetarian 🎉Well I always was

"We're NOT a globalist billionaire mouthpiece!" Then you relrease a video like this. Stay classy Globohomogesagt.
It’s not bad you’re all funded by the Jews and mossad agents who hate the society
We becoming fully carnivores this is one 🔥🔥🔥
but if we kill the cows why is there more methane
Does anyone else notice that the monkey in the jungle in the intro on the left side of the screen is always holding something different. Such a cool Easter egg.
Bad video, most arable crops goto feed animals, comparing nutrient density to potatoes rather than broccoli or spinach, there is no defending the horrors of the meat Industry.
Vegan teacher after seeing this What du hell you use animals for to
I'm sorry, but I can only feel frustrated when I hear discussions about what I should or shouldn’t eat, while at the same time we see massive forests being burned down with no immediate action to replant and grow trees that could trap carbon over time.  All this effort seems to focus on pushing people to eat, drive, and live as others dictate. Instead, I would love to see science provide real solutions, like carbon trapping and reuse. (I think Porsche once worked on an e-fuel project, but they gave it up due to cost efficiency—again, money being the problem.)  We need to set our priorities straight and start working toward real solutions without first taxing the little guy—you and me—for something beyond our individual control.  I could give up meat for life, and yet someone like a Kardashian can fly to Paris and back in a private jet just to eat a baguette. The CO₂ emissions from that single trip would offset not just my family’s lifestyle changes, but probably those of many others too.  We should start with the 1% at the top, not the other way around!
One thing you missed is the majority of crops used for animal products is that they mostly consume the parts of the crops we can't eat anyway. We take the seeds from grains, and feed them the remainder.
No. In fact it is good. Next question.
No way I’m stopping eating beef for only 16%
I'll stick to my hyper nutritious meat based diet thanks
Whatever you're doing, start it in America because y'all consume the most
I think if we didint rely on proced food so much and grow and harvest our food it would be much better right?
people still eat meat? let alone food? just photosynthesize like me bro 🤦
meat for life
0:04 gooning 🥰
I don't care about what anyone says the fact of the matter is is that I like me some gooood meat
everyone just start eating Chicken and potatoes
But, vegetables and fruits also need land and farms right? So they also contribute to the co2 released from flora, and cutting down forrests?
Dear Kurzgesagt Team, could you maybe make a video focused more on the cruelty of factory farming? 💓💓
0:02 the birds liking chicken/turkey and meat 💀
I went vegetarian, in Jr. High become of much harm the crops we grow for animal meat causes by destroying habitats and what thoses corps create.  I know in the US we love corn, but the corn sweat we're doing with isn't worth a chicken nugget to me. I know in the future we would need a better way of managing our food, but reducing unnecessary food growth is a good step for now.  Also, I've had people worry about my health after finding out I'm vegetarian, I've had blood work done and given blood more than once my doctors say all nutrient are literally perfect. I also don't normally eat fake meat, the only thing that changed is I now make my meals with more seasonings and zero meat.
Please avoid background sound
Great video! The meat question is such an interesting debate that can be tackled from so many different angles. Always important to remember that facts are worth more than opinions, no matter how strongly held they are
still eating meat no  matter what
1:14 Cutting down trees is unnecessary.
I don't think the farts really matter the way toxic emissions do.
*mad cow disease*
Someone is a militant vegan
I'm still gonna eat beef. At least 90% of the beef I eat is grass-fed. I know this because I help care for the cows I eat, and every single one of them eat grass and milk from birth to butcher. Also, at least part of the property is unsuitable for crop lands without terraforming which is expensive.
😮
Nobody is talking about trying to grow stake in a Lab...
4:45 And these avocados, I suppose, will just teleport themselves to the store later, or do they also need to be delivered by an internal combustion engine vehicle? After all, in most cases, the local producer is much closer than the international port.
What about fish?
Support veganism, heck promote it. It keeps meat prices low and they dont live as long, that's good social programming.
0:04 Me justifying gooning:
What do you know about carbon budget?  Where did you get your science degree?
What is rapid climate change?  Best  way to fight climate change is to get educated.  Climate is over millions of years.  Now what you just noticed in the last thousand years.  Stop promoting this false narrative.
Why is fish is missing in this?? Is it not considered meat?
In most countries, crops that are consumed by animals are heavily subsidised by governments while crops feed to humans are not.  Back in 1985, Bob Geldof of Band-Aid found this out the hard way. He had to pay the full un-subsidised  cost of grains that was going to feed animals to feed starving humans. He tried passing off a starving  human child in Ethiopia as a cow or chicken but it did not work.
lab grown meat is the solution
Meat is actually good for you humans are built to eat meat not plants there's a reason why they taste bitter plants don't want to eat them
‘That bad’ you can’t get any healthier than meat
Continue eating all the tasty REAL meat, the cows are inferior beings and are food
Shut Up!
if people stop eating beef and dairy it would contribute to a lot
Most of natural ecosystems (except for Antarctic, Australia and some islands) have ruminant-dominated terrestrial megafauna.  In the past population density was ever higher, than now. Wild ruminants emit same gases like domestic cattle
Try every type of diet, give it time (at least 3-4 months when you switch), then pick what works the best for you. Don't forget to change the dishes you go for from time to time, one master ingredient and a lot of varieties for the rest is key, and cook your meals yourself as much as possible.
What if we genetically engineer a plant to suck up an extremely high amount of carbon from the atomosphere. It could be the equivalent of tens of trees or simply use less land. We could also use it for potential space programs.
Did you just compare the emissions from local beef to the shipping cost of avacados, also setting aside the rest of transportation costs, while only expressing co2 numbers?
Cow is god who eat god
Send this to the vegen teacher
does 3-NOP (3-Nitrooxypropanol) works ????????????????????????????????
W video
The global population will never sway more towards a vegan diet but im guessing this video is to atleast sway some people, even if its 0.001% it makes a difference.  I however, will never give up eating beef or any other meat, because I know that it cant be stopped anyway so best to live my life to the fullest. Either way we look at it, the global warming is for the future to deal with and it cant be avoided, people will survive just like humans survived the last ice age and in time things will change.
If you think grass fed, grazed meat (not mass produced, pumped with ridiculous hormones meat) is unhealthy, you're an actual idiot
why is it free for everyone?? it deserves at least 10 dollars per a watch
All of your videos talking about meat are so one-sided. It is SUPER CLEAR that this is made with a specific theory or agenda in mind at the start. You tend to say that red meat is bad, or causes this or that, BUT this or that. You ALWAYS come up with a way to annihilate your original argument. I can't understand how any rational human being can watch your videos and say: "oh wow, well, that sounds credible". People need to always double-check, otherwise they end up as subscribers to your channel and agenda.
If you honestly think it’s worth 3 billion hectares of land to eat animal products how can you say you care about the environment?
It is beyond unnecessary to kill animals for food. If you eat animals, you’re essentially sponsoring their torture. If you say that it is more complicated than that, you are kidding yourself. Go vegan.

"It's the only thing that gets enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old"😶
Hopefully animal rights is a thing for cows and chickens too in the future :(
So we should drive the cows to extinction?
But protein in meat and animal products is more digestible. It has to be taken into account. Meat may have more benefits, for example, it has more digestible iron, which is really important for people with anemia.
still going to eat meat the world is going to kill each other anyways
The easiest way I’ve found to stop or at very least reduce eating meat is to imagine being the animal you plan to exploit and kill with your dollar, and realize they are not inanimate ooh era to be acted upon, but beings in their own right 😊
Such great info, thank you!
Left out the fact that methane breaks down to CO2 when it degrades, compounding the issue
What about fish
kurzgesagt 5 years ago; is meat bad for you? is meat unhealthy? kurzgesagt 3 years ago; is meat *really* that bad?
I LOVE MEAT♤♡♡♡
Eating meat is wrong because it takes the life of other sentient beings. The word animal comes from anima which means spirit. We're all fellow spirits ✨️
Fish meat?
listo eliminamos el 90 % de las vaca y el 90 % de galiinas , por que son tan comunistas ? siempre fueron pobres ? o son la izquierda feliz ?
This is such a well explained video
Go vegan
I am gonna eat beef ❤
Would be great to listen about negative and positive consequences on people’s health
Where did the background music come from in this video?
I don’t know but that post club honey butter chicken tasted pretty good to me
erm, the litly hod of cancer  is increst by veganisom
Yet beef is the most efficient food as for protein (surprise, plant based protein is not the same) and as a bodybuilder it’s not like I have a choice (and it’s delicious) so good luck
if an animal needs a balanced diet why not us
climate change isnt a problem. look at how fast we progress technologically.
This is what the vegan teacher should be talking about instead of calling us the same as H*tler for eating meat and eggs
solution: less meat animals produced and a law saying to buy meat only on Fridays and eat it only on weekends while mondays being completely vegan.
Hmm cool but*still eatis meat*
Me seeing this while gobbling on meat
bro is the vegan teachers best friend💀💀💀
we already eat too much red meat and its not even the entire world that has access to it. i know western society loves their burgers and other greasy gross shit, but just eating less of it won't only not kill you, itll be actively good for you
Instead of pressuring people to give up meat- why don’t people give up soda or wear clothes longer instead of getting into fast fashion? Meat is good for you
The co2 per 100 grams of proteins it's really interesting   For  potatoes if it like 1.5 - 2 grams per 100  And if you need like 50 kg of potatoes to reach 1kg of proteins At 0.5kg of CO2 per kg of potatoes that means  25 kg of CO2 per each kg of potatoes protein   While Chicken on the low end is like 20% protein per 100 grams. So 1 kg of chicken protein takes at least 5 kg of chicken which means 50kg of co2  That's twice the CO2 of potatoes but 5 times less biomass and I'm sure that we should factor in the associated cost of digestion and water treatment if you catch my drift 😂
In morroco and other Muslim contries we kill a lamb for a holiday
It's a bit out of touch to reality to blame animals while the main reason is definitly the eat shit sleep and die people they have to feed unwillingly!!!
Eating less meat can protect human health and prevent climate warming.
Humans survived centuries with farming, probably will survive many more to come.
9:45 *sees the T-Cell on the table (bottom left)*   AY WHAT YOU DOIN THERE? YOUR NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THERE!!
what about the addicts of the world there is going to be people that cant stop eating meat  and then there are the people that live off of the addicts that will cause conflicts then we end up with the dumbass peckerhead trumps of the world that live off of everybody :::: humans are the stupidest animals on the planet ::::::: and because of dumbass perkerheads it will never change 😊
How about… we don’t deforest land and let cattle graze in wild lands
they used stonks 🤣🤣

EAT THE MEAT
SAVE THE MEAT
1:04 these 3 tractors are discing up the field, normally the discs would be bigger.
I suspect this one will not age well, but future humans will be very understanding I believe, since it's from before the time when most people still hadn't woken up yet.  A lot has changed since Nov 2021, and lots of scientists have bravely spilled the beans, the fear and oppression has been significantly lifted for them.
I don't think you can really address the question on whether or not eating meat is wrong whilst excluding the moral argument. As it stands, the takeaway is 'yeah I guess it's alright in moderation, especially if we stick to battery farms'. It's an incomplete picture.
being vegan is bad
I hate that even when presented with scientific fact people STILL try to excuse it away and put their greed for meat above the rights and welfare of animals and the health of the planet. Just stop eating meat. It really isn't difficult
But i like my homemade burgers that are actually healthy
We need meat for Iron and Protein. Lack of Iron can lead to Anaemia and lack of Protein will not help your injuries, so no. We shouldn't stop eating meat.    (Not that I disrespect vegetarians)
you forgot: grasshopper, roaches, crickets, superworms, mealworms, solider flys, waterbugs, bamboo worms, earth worms, silkworms
9:05 so what you just showed was that being vegan is worse for the environment then eating meat so that means people that eat meat are less damaging then vegans.
u know mark rober has a video about a 100% vegan burger that taste exactly ike a normal burger
Thats a shame that 19% of soy globally goes to humans, we should make it 0%
Framing everything via climate issues when climate is an extreme debated topic is very annoying. Probably my biggest issue with the channel is when they do this, there is more to meat, food, and such than climate.
if the whole world goes vegan tomorrow, will it be a solution? we will still need to feed those billions of people with vegan products and probably this will cause another side of industrialization on agriculture. currently @1:30 it says the food causes 26% of the total green gas emission, will it reduce to 5% when we all go vegan?  I support going vegan but not sure if this is enough for slowing down the global warming. I wonder the effect of textile, technology or transportation in the total emissions... maybe limiting number of screens at home (tv monitor phone tablet) will cover more emissions. or a limit on the distance you can drive your own car.
not enough people take accountability for humanity and how damaging we are, BE MORE SUSTAINABLE
It’s becoming unbearable to live in Brazil. The air is heavily polluted with smoke from fires burning in distant states, hundreds of miles away. The drought was historic, lasting 164 days. The temperatures were also record-breaking, with Brasília experiencing extreme heat for three consecutive days in October, and Rio de Janeiro reaching 39.9°C in October and a "feels like" temperature of 62.3°C in March.
Carbon footprint is bs. Companies made it up to blame people for their environmental damage.
this and the phylosphoca aspects of meat is the reason why i became vegeterain and opt to consume as little animal products.
@spacewar It's your life. Stuff yourself with cadavers all you want.
Amazing video!
Waching this while eating beef
I want to be a vegetarian, but I wouldn't force it on people.
5:00 Methane released from cows is methane that was ALREADY present in the environment. Cows themselves cannot add more emissions, only burning fuel buried underground can release new CO2 in the atmosphere, because it wasn't already part of the environment, we put it there. Cows in the other end? How can they add more? Eating grass? Grass that was already part of the environment? Nah that's bullshit
❤
Before over hunting in the 1800s and 1900s, 30 to 100 million bison roamed North America.  Those numbers were reduced to less than several thousand at one point.  So taken as true, it seems highly likely to me that blaming cows for emissions is possibly a trick being played in the public by the companies actually causing the most problems, and they have no intention of stopping.  Subterfuge and obfuscation to achieve whatever ends.
See, people overcomplicate it. Just eat both in a balanced amount😭🙏
just go vegetarian, if you stop eating meat there'll be less of a demand for it, when there's less of a demand people will stop feeding the animals it & more of that 77% of soy plants will go to us for soy meat (which tastes just as good BTW) I'm not saying you have to, I'm no disciple of the vegan teacher but I'm just saying, when you have kids or if you have kids, don't you want them to live in climate change safe world I mean we're actively killing millions if we don't change
Food is arguably the best thing about being alive😞
4:30 ever heard about the panama canal? why did the animators cut off a big chunk from panama?
Soooo, I guess fish is fair game 😅
6:30 unethical but efficient
>Is Meat Really that Bad? It's mostly beef. If you remove cows from equation, full veganism would not be so drastically better compared to an omnivore diet. And we don't even talk about sustainability. Pigs and poultry can live on human food waste. Society should embrace more different types of meat: sheep, goats, etc.
This is such a great video

Palihug basaha kini nga review. Magamit nato ang methane gas nga gipagawas sa atmospera isip tinubdan sa enerhiya pinaagi sa pagkolekta niini gikan sa atmospera ug pagtipig niini. Oo, nahibal-an ko nga ang methane gas adunay 23 ka beses nga mas taas nga kapasidad sa pagpadayon sa kainit kaysa sa carbon dioxide gas, apan ang usa ka dako nga bahin sa natural nga gas naglangkob sa methane gas ug kini nagpasabut nga magamit naton ang methane gas nga gipagawas sa atmospera ingon natural nga gas gamiton usab kini nga gas isip sugnod sa mga thermal power plant aron makagama og elektrisidad ug sa ingon mamenosan ang kadaot nga atong mabuhat sa kinaiyahan ⚡🌳🌲😊
Пожалуйста, прочитайте этот обзор. Мы можем использовать метан, выбрасываемый в атмосферу, в качестве источника энергии, собирая его из атмосферы и сохраняя. Да, я знаю, что метан обладает в 23 раза большей теплоемкостью, чем углекислый газ, но большая часть природного газа состоит из метана, и это означает, что мы можем использовать метан, выбрасываемый в атмосферу, в качестве природного газа. также использовать этот газ в качестве топлива на тепловых электростанциях для производства электроэнергии и тем самым уменьшить ущерб, который мы наносим природе. 🌳⚡🌲😊
Por favor, leia esta revisão. Podemos usar o gás metano liberado na atmosfera como fonte de energia, coletando-o da atmosfera e armazenando-o. Sim, eu sei que o gás metano tem 23 vezes mais capacidade de retenção de calor do que o gás dióxido de carbono, mas uma grande parte do gás natural consiste em gás metano e isso significa que podemos utilizar o gás metano libertado na atmosfera como gás natural. também usaremos esse gás como combustível em usinas termelétricas para produzir eletricidade e assim reduziremos os danos que causamos à natureza. ⚡🌳🌲😊

Vennligst les denne anmeldelsen. Vi kan bruke metangass som slippes ut i atmosfæren som energikilde ved å samle den opp fra atmosfæren og lagre den. Ja, jeg vet at metangass har 23 ganger mer varmelagringsevne enn karbondioksidgass, men en stor del av naturgassen består av metangass og det betyr at vi kan bruke metangassen som slippes ut i atmosfæren som naturgass også bruke denne gassen som drivstoff i termiske kraftverk for å produsere elektrisitet og dermed redusere skadene vi gjør på naturen 🌲⚡🌳😊

Sila baca ulasan ini. Kita boleh menggunakan gas metana yang dibebaskan ke atmosfera sebagai sumber tenaga dengan mengumpulnya dari atmosfera dan menyimpannya. Ya, saya tahu bahawa gas metana mempunyai kapasiti pengekalan haba 23 kali ganda daripada gas karbon dioksida, tetapi sebahagian besar gas asli terdiri daripada gas metana dan ini bermakna kita boleh menggunakan gas metana yang dilepaskan ke atmosfera sebagai gas asli juga menggunakan gas ini sebagai bahan api dalam loji kuasa haba untuk menghasilkan elektrik dan dengan itu mengurangkan kerosakan yang kita lakukan kepada alam semula jadi kita akan mengurangkan 🌳🌲⚡😊
Ве молиме прочитајте го овој преглед. Можеме да користиме гас метан ослободен во атмосферата како извор на енергија со тоа што ќе го собереме од атмосферата и ќе го складираме. Да, знам дека гасот метан има 23 пати поголем капацитет за задржување топлина од гасот на јаглерод диоксид, но голем дел од природниот гас се состои од гас метан и тоа значи дека можеме да го користиме гасот метан што се ослободува во атмосферата како природен гас исто така користете го овој гас како гориво во термоелектраните за производство на електрична енергија и на тој начин ќе ја намалиме штетата што ја правиме на природата 🌳🌲⚡😊

Kérjük, olvassa el ezt az ismertetőt. A légkörbe kerülő metángázt a légkörből összegyűjtve és tárolva energiaforrásként használhatjuk fel. Igen, tudom, hogy a metángáz 23-szor nagyobb hőmegtartó képességgel rendelkezik, mint a szén-dioxid, de a földgáz nagy része metángázból áll, és ez azt jelenti, hogy a légkörbe kerülő metángázt földgázként tudjuk hasznosítani ezt a gázt hőerőművekben is használjuk tüzelőanyagként villamos energia előállítására, és ezzel csökkentjük a természetben okozott károkat 🌳🌲⚡😊

Proszę przeczytać tę recenzję. Gazowy metan uwalniany do atmosfery możemy wykorzystać jako źródło energii, pozyskując go z atmosfery i przechowując. Tak, wiem, że metan ma 23 razy większą zdolność zatrzymywania ciepła niż dwutlenek węgla, ale duża część gazu ziemnego składa się z metanu, co oznacza, że ​​możemy wykorzystać metan uwalniany do atmosfery tak samo jak gaz ziemny wykorzystywać ten gaz jako paliwo w elektrowniach cieplnych do produkcji energii elektrycznej, zmniejszając w ten sposób szkody, jakie wyrządzamy przyrodzie ⚡🌲🌳😊

이 리뷰를 읽어보시기 바랍니다. 대기 중으로 방출된 메탄가스를 대기로부터 수집하여 저장함으로써 에너지원으로 활용할 수 있습니다. 네, 메탄가스가 이산화탄소가스보다 보온능력이 23배나 높은 것으로 알고 있습니다. 하지만 천연가스의 상당 부분이 메탄가스로 구성되어 있어 대기 중에 배출되는 메탄가스를 천연가스로 활용할 수 있다는 뜻입니다. 또한 이 가스를 화력 발전소의 연료로 사용하여 전기를 생산함으로써 자연에 미치는 피해를 줄일 것입니다. ⚡🌳🌲😊

Si us plau, llegiu aquesta ressenya. Podem utilitzar el gas metà alliberat a l'atmosfera com a font d'energia recollint-lo de l'atmosfera i emmagatzemant-lo. Sí, sé que el gas metà té 23 vegades més capacitat de retenció de calor que el gas diòxid de carboni, però una gran part del gas natural està format per gas metà i això vol dir que podem utilitzar el gas metà alliberat a l'atmosfera com a gas natural també utilitzar aquest gas com a combustible a les centrals tèrmiques per produir electricitat i així reduir el dany que fem a la natura 🌳⚡⚡😊
ದಯವಿಟ್ಟು ಈ ವಿಮರ್ಶೆಯನ್ನು ಓದಿ. ವಾತಾವರಣಕ್ಕೆ ಬಿಡುಗಡೆಯಾಗುವ ಮೀಥೇನ್ ಅನಿಲವನ್ನು ನಾವು ವಾತಾವರಣದಿಂದ ಸಂಗ್ರಹಿಸಿ ಅದನ್ನು ಸಂಗ್ರಹಿಸುವ ಮೂಲಕ ಶಕ್ತಿಯ ಮೂಲವಾಗಿ ಬಳಸಬಹುದು. ಹೌದು, ಮೀಥೇನ್ ಅನಿಲವು ಇಂಗಾಲದ ಡೈಆಕ್ಸೈಡ್ ಅನಿಲಕ್ಕಿಂತ 23 ಪಟ್ಟು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಶಾಖ ಧಾರಣ ಸಾಮರ್ಥ್ಯವನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿದೆ ಎಂದು ನನಗೆ ತಿಳಿದಿದೆ, ಆದರೆ ನೈಸರ್ಗಿಕ ಅನಿಲದ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಭಾಗವು ಮೀಥೇನ್ ಅನಿಲವನ್ನು ಹೊಂದಿರುತ್ತದೆ ಮತ್ತು ಇದರರ್ಥ ನಾವು ವಾತಾವರಣಕ್ಕೆ ಬಿಡುಗಡೆಯಾಗುವ ಮೀಥೇನ್ ಅನಿಲವನ್ನು ನಾವು ನೈಸರ್ಗಿಕ ಅನಿಲವಾಗಿ ಬಳಸಬಹುದು ಈ ಅನಿಲವನ್ನು ಥರ್ಮಲ್ ಪವರ್ ಪ್ಲಾಂಟ್‌ಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಇಂಧನವಾಗಿ ಬಳಸಿ ವಿದ್ಯುಚ್ಛಕ್ತಿಯನ್ನು ಉತ್ಪಾದಿಸುತ್ತೇವೆ ಮತ್ತು ನಾವು ಪ್ರಕೃತಿಗೆ ಮಾಡುವ ಹಾನಿಯನ್ನು ಕಡಿಮೆ ಮಾಡುತ್ತೇವೆ 🌳🌲⚡😊
このレビューを読んでください。大気中に放出されたメタンガスを大気中から回収し、貯蔵することでエネルギー源として利用することができます。はい、メタンガスは炭酸ガスの23倍の保温力があることは知っていますが、天然ガスの大部分はメタンガスで構成されており、大気中に放出されたメタンガスを天然ガスとして利用できるということになります。また、このガスを火力発電所の燃料として使用して電気を生成し、自然へのダメージを軽減します。 🌳🌲⚡😊
Vinsamlegast lestu þessa umsögn. Við getum notað metangas sem losnar út í andrúmsloftið sem orkugjafa með því að safna því upp úr andrúmsloftinu og geyma það. Já, ég veit að metangas hefur 23 sinnum meiri hitageymslugetu en koltvísýringsgas, en stór hluti jarðgass samanstendur af metangasi og það þýðir að við getum notað metangasið sem losnar út í andrúmsloftið sem jarðgas nota þetta gas líka sem eldsneyti í varmaorkuverum til að framleiða rafmagn og draga þannig úr skaðanum sem við gerum á náttúrunni 🌲🌳⚡😊
Si prega di leggere questa recensione. Possiamo utilizzare il gas metano rilasciato nell'atmosfera come fonte di energia raccogliendolo dall'atmosfera e immagazzinandolo. Sì, lo so, il gas metano ha una capacità di ritenzione del calore 23 volte maggiore rispetto al gas anidride carbonica, ma gran parte del gas naturale è costituito da gas metano e questo significa che possiamo utilizzare il gas metano rilasciato nell'atmosfera come gas naturale Inoltre utilizzeremo questo gas come combustibile nelle centrali termoelettriche per produrre elettricità e così ridurremo i danni che arrechiamo alla natura 🌲🌳⚡😊
Vänligen läs denna recension. Vi kan använda metangas som släpps ut i atmosfären som energikälla genom att samla upp den från atmosfären och lagra den. Ja, jag vet att metangas har 23 gånger mer värmelagringsförmåga än koldioxidgas, men en stor del av naturgasen består av metangas och det gör att vi kan använda den metangas som släpps ut i atmosfären som naturgas även använda denna gas som bränsle i värmekraftverk för att producera el och därmed minska skadorna vi gör på naturen 🌲🌳⚡😊

אנא קרא את הביקורת הזו. אנו יכולים להשתמש בגז מתאן המשתחרר לאטמוספירה כמקור אנרגיה על ידי איסוף מהאטמוספירה ואגירתו. כן, אני יודע שלגז מתאן יש פי 23 יותר יכולת שימור חום מגז פחמן דו חמצני, אבל חלק גדול מהגז הטבעי מורכב מגז מתאן וזה אומר שאנחנו יכולים להשתמש בגז המתאן המשתחרר לאטמוספירה כגז טבעי גם להשתמש בגז הזה כדלק בתחנות כוח תרמיות לייצור חשמל ובכך להפחית את הנזק שאנו גורמים לטבע 🌳🌲⚡😊

Mangyaring basahin ang pagsusuri na ito. Magagamit natin ang methane gas na inilabas sa atmospera bilang pinagmumulan ng enerhiya sa pamamagitan ng pagkolekta nito mula sa atmospera at pag-iimbak nito. Oo, alam ko na ang methane gas ay may 23 beses na mas maraming kapasidad sa pagpapanatili ng init kaysa sa carbon dioxide gas, ngunit ang malaking bahagi ng natural na gas ay binubuo ng methane gas at nangangahulugan ito na magagamit natin ang methane gas na inilabas sa atmospera bilang natural na gas gamitin din ang gas na ito bilang panggatong sa mga thermal power plant para makagawa ng kuryente at sa gayon ay mabawasan ang pinsalang nagagawa natin sa kalikasan 🌲🌳⚡

এই পর্যালোচনা পড়ুন. আমরা বায়ুমণ্ডলে নির্গত মিথেন গ্যাসকে বায়ুমণ্ডল থেকে সংগ্রহ করে সংরক্ষণ করে শক্তির উৎস হিসেবে ব্যবহার করতে পারি। হ্যাঁ, আমি জানি যে মিথেন গ্যাসের কার্বন ডাই অক্সাইড গ্যাসের চেয়ে 23 গুণ বেশি তাপ ধারণ ক্ষমতা রয়েছে, তবে প্রাকৃতিক গ্যাসের একটি বড় অংশ মিথেন গ্যাস নিয়ে গঠিত এবং এর মানে হল যে আমরা প্রাকৃতিক গ্যাস হিসাবে বায়ুমণ্ডলে নির্গত মিথেন গ্যাস ব্যবহার করতে পারি তাপবিদ্যুৎ কেন্দ্রে জ্বালানি হিসেবেও এই গ্যাস ব্যবহার করে বিদ্যুৎ উৎপাদন করে আমরা প্রকৃতির যে ক্ষতি করি তা কমিয়ে আনব 🌳🌲⚡
Калі ласка, прачытайце гэты агляд. Мы можам выкарыстоўваць метан, які выкідваецца ў атмасферу, у якасці крыніцы энергіі, збіраючы яго з атмасферы і захоўваючы. Так, я ведаю, што метан мае ў 23 разы большую здольнасць утрымліваць цяпло, чым вуглякіслы газ, але вялікая частка прыроднага газу складаецца з метану, і гэта азначае, што мы можам выкарыстоўваць метан, які выкідваецца ў атмасферу, як прыродны газ таксама выкарыстоўваць гэты газ у якасці паліва на цеплавых электрастанцыях для вытворчасці электраэнергіі і, такім чынам, паменшыць шкоду, якую мы наносім прыродзе 🌲🌳⚡

Lees asseblief hierdie resensie. Ons kan metaangas wat in die atmosfeer vrygestel word as 'n energiebron gebruik deur dit uit die atmosfeer te versamel en te stoor.

Please read this review. We can use methane gas released into the atmosphere as an energy source by collecting it from the atmosphere and storing it. Yes, I know that methane gas has 23 times more heat retention capacity than carbon dioxide gas, but a large part of natural gas consists of methane gas and this means that we can use the methane gas released into the atmosphere as natural gas. We can also use this gas as fuel in thermal power plants to produce electricity and thus reduce the damage we do to nature. we will reduce 🌲🌳⚡
Lütfen bu yorumu okuyun. Atmosfere salınan metan gazını atmosferden toplayıp depolayarak bir enerji kaynağı olararak kullanabiliriz. Evet biliyorum metan gazı karbondioksit gazından 23 kat daha fazla ısı tutma kapasitesine sahip ama doğalgazın büyük bir bölümü metan gazından oluşuyor ve bu bizim atmosfere salınan metan gazını doğalgaz olarak kullanabileceğimiz anlamına geliyor.Ayrıca bu gazı termik santrallerde yakıt olarak kullanıp elektrik üretebiliriz ve böylece doğaya verdiğimiz zararı azaltmış oluruz 🌲🌳⚡
I'm sorry, but you don't understand climate change! This video is wrong in its core. How can you say that eating local, grass-fed beef contributes to climate change? Because they burp and fart? Are you serious? 😂

I will bet that climate change happens wether or not we lower our emmisions. Its only a matter of postponing it. Hell, we will probably destroy ourselves with nukes before the climate does.
The thumbnail text is crazy
PLS READ One thing I see people overlook is that OK only 48% of our crop goes to humans but are we experiencing a food shortage. No! And aswell the US is experiencing an oversupply. So let's take cows out of the equation Suddenly millions of farmers have lost land or gob bankrupt because I'd they only produce human product grain due to its high supply they would make little to no money and without  farmers we have no food at all
The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated.
As a person chasing a career climate change policy, I humbly, humbly thank you for this video. I cried so hard.
if we talk meat...about 20 years before, there was H1N1 in china at that time, no one dare to eat chicken, so chicken related meals were extramly cheap, such as KFC, I ate a lot every day, with a deadly low cost, that's amazing 😂
The emissions argument is secondary. The main thing is simply not to make sentient beings suffer unnecessarily. What are you trying to do anyway? Try to innocently raise awareness of how bad meat is? We all know that. The only thing that could be done is to deal with the issue from a political perspective and restrict it with strict laws. There is nothing else to be done.
The argument of veganism is not emissions, its about being a good person who doesn’t support slaughtering the defenseless and vulnerable for consumption, clothing, and worse entertainment when it's not needed at all. Pain is real as the strongest we shouldn't add unnecessary burderns to innocent lambs and cattle. Good shepards dont slaughter their flock. Evil ones do.
oh
Get co2 back from the sky .... is the only solution . that needs to be figured out. fighting over cows only slows the solution coming
But let's ignore big conflict-industrial complexes that churn out more pollution than all of us combined times seven. :/

It's impossible for greenhouse gas behavior to cause global warming.  This video has the United Nations Climate Change disclaimer.   Global warming was officially stated at 1.1°C in 1991 and 1.06°C in 2022.  There is no mechanism that would allow greenhouse gas behavior to cause global warming.     The back of the United Nation's IPCC science report states it took its greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude where it is common high school level knowledge there is no greenhouse radiant energy.  This is typical practice for deceptive marketing to state legal data transparency protecting the perpetrators from fraud prosecution.   The IPCC has been transparent with its data acknowledging it is not dealing with active greenhouse gases.    Earth's greenhouse effect is frequently used as a primary example to high school students of a system always in saturation from the strong greenhouse gas water vapor absorbing all the greenhouse radiant energy from the earth with greenhouse gases within 20 meters of the surface that is all around us everyday and can't have its overall effect changed.  There is no further greenhouse radiant energy to interact with greenhouse gases.  At 1% average tropospheric water vapor over 99% of earth’s greenhouse effect is from water vapor.  Water vapor would hold earth's greenhouse effect in saturation if it were the only greenhouse gas in the atmosphere.  Arctic warming is taking place with the proving mechanism being warm Atlantic Ocean waters migrating deeper and more frequently into the Arctic Ocean warming it and the region.   That warmer water is causing a few weeks less of reflective snow and ice coverage resulting in more solar heat gain to the Arctic region surface.  Atmospheric CO2 levels of 1200 ppm about three times what they are today would greatly invigorate C3 plants the majority of plant life on earth greatly greening the planet.   0.4% of the atmosphere is CO2 and on average 1% is H20 water vapor.   (1% H20)/(0.4% CO2) = 25.  Water vapor is 25 times more present in the atmosphere on average than CO2.   Water vapor has an CO2e of 18,  18 X 25 = 450 CO2e total for water vapor to 1 CO2e for CO2.   The Earth’s oceans have 3-1/2 million sea floor volcanic vents warming the water and changing it’s chemistry that have not been systematically accounted for.

Hello @kurzesagt - I am curious. How has sleep changed over human history? Would love to see a video about sleep! It feels people get less quality sleep these days thanks to screens. Or is that not necessarily true? Is it better than the thousands of years human spent living on the ground?
Meat is murder. Its also suicide.
Meat is pretty varied.  Like all food, you want to buy what takes less space, the least amount of resources, and preferably is best for the livestock or plants,
Can someone recommend similar videos?
Funny how the meat commercials are so well placed 🥓🍔🍗🥩
You'll eat ze bugs!
Very interesting
Nah id eat
8:49 why he say it like that
9:46 its the immune system 2 cell!
Great video, didn't push one way or another politically and just openly talked about it about data, rare sight now a days. Keep up the great videos  The issue right now with going into all plant is there are some studies and research going on with some evidence that our food is losing nutritional value, I believe this is the same case for meat but still it is a factor. Moderation and not over consuming one type of food is better and improving and reversing damage to the nutritional value will also help. Having many options for what diet you eat based on your needs, be it medical or activity wise is a great idea and something not often consider anymore.   Steak and Potato diet as an example is great for people who burn a lot of calories and needs that nutrient dense food to be able to do hard labor jobs like a lot of blue collar work, from construction and oil rig or even road work. And having that type of meal now and again for everyone else isn't harmful either. But primarily having that when you have low physical activity can lead one to gaining more weight and in a way using up more food than they need to to get the amount of energy needed. Moderation and figuring out better methods for all types of food production is far better than simply banning one type of food or try to strangle that industry out like we see lately.  Earth has been very hot before with higher CO2, life was around then, life will continue. If we want to survive as a species or make ours and the wildlife ability to survive change easier, we have to do more about adapting and evolving our means of production rather than arguing about what to ban or get rid of for the sake of the environment when it comes to food. I doubt the world will unite behind getting rid of say beef, but people can join together getting behind better and cleaner means of production that isn't cruel either and we can make people want to eat healthier if we make it more of a willing choice with knowledge, rather than fear and shaming.
They say anymore just breathing the air is bad for you.
Maybe because beef is so popular
WHO REMEMBERS THE MASSIVE ARGUMENT ON THIS VIDEO
Rarely eating beef isn’t difficult
To be fair, most land used for animals is not arable and the food we feed animals is fed to *animals* and not us for a reason. Factory farms still suck though.
Sorry, Earth, I have to emmit more methane by eating Rice, because it's a staple
No.
I ate meat when watching this video
I DON'T CARE. I WILL EAT MEAT NO MATTER WHAT!!!
I typically ate meat 3 times a day until I "saw the light" Once I connected that activity with the suffering it creates on multiple levels, I stopped. And never looked back. Fruits, seeds, vegetables, nuts, grains, grasses, roots, herbs, and berries offer plenty of options. Dairy and eggs are more of a challenge to produce without killing, but some farms do just that. I believe the production of both is less damaging to the environment. I haven't eaten an animal (or parts thereof) for over 50 years. For me, it was easy. I wish the same for you.
better eat chicken
Vegan food has to be grown too
I'm vegetarian you can see because of my pfp
Avocados fr
I don’t even have to watch the video. I know for a fact that this video is going to bash meat and say it’s terrible don’t eat meat. It’s all propaganda. They just don’t want to feed us good anymore. Get ready to start eating the bugs people.
Eating hamburgers while watching this. 👍👍
Kurzkesagst forgot to say but the total calculations say that going on a vegan diet will reduce 43% carbon emmisons and we will be able to feed 3.5 billion more people!
I whould go vegan if  there were actual good beef / meat in general alternatives, pea patties just dont taste good, and so most other things i tried
I think every woman ever would disagr- nvm
Lasty and probably the most important thing to know about climate change is that it's overblown and chalk full of political power grabs, so eat your steak, he'll eat two just to make sure that vegan that thinks he's doing something isn't.
i never ate beef or lamb in my entire life
But how can you tell a veggie patty is not just a product advertised as is by marketing g campaign as well? These might be just as terrible CO2 wise as your regular patty. I fear there is little we consumers can do and more can be done by governing bodies. Unfortunately the latter usually becomes too political without any actual intuitive result in the long run.
Being vegan just wouldn't be worth it for me. Only 26% of emissions is on food, whatever I do to fix that and the small percentages of other things my miniscule life effects on the emissions isnt worth the live changing alterations I would have to make when its all gonna fail in the end anyway. You don't realize how much effort I would have to put into to change my life style in such a drastic way. I dont want to be Vegan cause I dont want to give up the little comforts I do have in life. Theres no moral or ethical argument that can out way the loss of the food I love.
As much as I want the Earth to be better, I'm not necessarily ready to sacrafice my diet. The attitude i have is the reason that climate change is still the threay that it is. That being said, I eat mostly chicken, eggs, fish, and occasionally sausage or steak.
Dont forget. Bill Gates holds a share of this channel. Do your own independent research on the matter - bill gates n the anti beef agenda
Ban meat
I've always been annoyed by the fact that people like to talk about methane emissions but don't know anything about the methane recycling process
Says the ex vegan. Rico Fresquez
Can you make a bideo of wat is the scale of bacteria 😮
One aspect of the food debate I do not see mentioned much is the issue of trust and cooperation between countries. If we as a species all shared and shared alike our resources most of every problem with vegetarian food would indeed be emotional, a matter of taste. But fact is, we do not share alike. Water scarcity all over our blue planet is a very very clear example of this.  I am from sweden, and we are a relatively rich country these days, able to buy an ever increasing percentage of food from other countries. And sweden got rich mostly from trade of natural resources. With truly reliable global trade we could very well make the switch to a plant based diet. But cold facts is that global food trade is in no way guaranteed and that my country just cannot grow a sufficient volume of nutrient dense vegetation to feed our population. At best we could supplement protein from animal husbandry. Our growth season is just too short and too cold. Only on the very most southern part is farming of legumes a feasible option. Even wheat is an uncertain crop for the northen half of our country. GMO crops migth be able to solve this eventually, but rigth now (and 2 years ago) a vegetarian diet would be a truly dumb strategic choice. Food production is a complex issue and very location dependent, so I find this simplification factually true but also misguided.  I recommend doing a video on the effects of fast fashion on the enviroment if you are looking for a personal choices that could make a difference. Overconsumption of clothing is far more optional than food and the industry has a truly absurd footprint.
I know this isnt involved but i love the emo cow lmao 😂
Meat to be transported from a farm to the store makes emissions A avocado to be shipped from one country to another makes 0.20kg emissions  So what? The freighters transport directly to the store or we gonna ignore the fact that those avocadoes also need to be transported the same distance and way as the beef to reach the stores...
Local food doesn't matter
I would eat all these food
pEople who are vegan/vegetarian but still clicked on this video

Ohhh bet this propaganda video isn't going to age well in a few years, have not seen such bias in a while. Theories and hypothesis are better discussed in an appropriate manner not laid out as facts to deceive people
All of this research is absolutely pointless without the realisation of lobbying, corruption and what role politics play in such issues. And of course the realisation of civil unrest. You decide what you do with this information and how you interpret it.
Nah nothing making me stop eating meat
There's a food panda add below me 🤤
I saw this video and was like "please don't be carnist propaganda, i love kurgezagt, don't make me unsubscribe" and now that I've seen this video i just want to say: I don't know if the team is vegan, and i honestly don't care. But i just want to say, thank you. Thank you for saying the truth and not being wavered by the industry or angry meat eaters. Remember y'all, this is only the effect on the environment. The effect on the welfare of animals is on a completely different scale
In brazil, meat is fairly cheap compared to other things, but it’s still very expensive in a vacuum. We usually just keep bovine meat for special occasions or when we are sick. Most of our protein is milk, eggs and chicken.
You forgot something important: NUTRITION
The vigan teacher needs to see this
damn why is beef so good
It's a shame that the best foods produce the worst emissions.
But CO2 makes trees grow.
Being a Karen over other ppl's diets won't solve anything.
Bro forgot to mention that animals  consume vegetation but most is the scraps from our crop like corn leaves and hay etc. Thus keeping the scraps from causing environmental damage
The monkey was eating a cow in the intro
guys! you don't have to go vegetarian or vegan! you can just eat less often or smaller amounts of meat or just get rid of cows meat and eat other animals! it all counts and will be appreciated
Meat is not that bad becasue I like chikn nuget.
There is also beef branded as carbon neutral which wasn't mentioned in the video. How does that work?
Yeahhhh im never giving up being a meat eater. Tastes fuckin amazing, most of the most prestigious dishes involve meat, good source of protein, yeah not giving it up.
Ah, another quality video for all the bobble head idiots that have no idea that they are, indeed, idiots. The people who wish to feel and appear smart, so they delegate their thinking out to others who are recognized as smart and scientific, and then enthusiastically agree with the rest of the idiotic chorus about whatever biased nonsense was just spewed out by that source.
Could you do one about how much different species of plants and algae use the carbon and nitrogen in our atmosphere to grow? I really didn't understand it when I went to school and I love your videos.
Now I'm gana double my.meat intake
I mean, BB and airsoft guns sometimes use greenhouse gas so why don’t farmers try to trap that greenhouse gas so that people can use that in airsoft because first of all they would let even more people have more fun with airsoft and that would also let us use less or less greenhouse gas into the atmosphere
Meat love is different at womans💀💀💀
You guys are getting lame. Getting really tired of these bullshit worn out climate change paranoia bits. Methane from cows is not a fucking problem.
This is a well researched video. One point I would like to raise is that a whole bunch of the cereal crops that would be used for humans get rained on or otherwise degraded in value and can’t be used for humans as per local laws and these are partially what we use for animals. For example if wheat gets rain whilst it is ripening it will often go from the grade used for bread down to a grade for beer and then its either replanting seed or animal feed as far as I understand it. Of course crops like sorghum are largely animal feed so your point is valid. It’s just a small adjustment of numbers is all. Love this channel. Keep doing good work 😊
I genuinely always have a double burger just to ensure I counter a vegan
This video is solely about climate change and doesn't really acknowledge the incredible suffering of billions of animals. I wish this was more the main topic of the video because the suffering of the victims really is the main thing to be worried about when talking about murder.
hi, I work with cows, and I know that there is much more risk for methane and co2 emissions when working with cows. but if we store all of the co2 and methane in the bottom under the sea, it may be that we can live on earth much longer without giving up meat and beef.
can you do a video on keto diet?
기후 온난화를 탄소 문재로 몰고가는 것은 잘 못된  생각이다 기후 온난는 과거에도 있었으나 시간이 문제지 온도가 문제가 아니다 과거에는 이것보다 더 춥고 더 더웠다 그러나 시간이 길면 적응하는 시간이 있어 피해를 줄일수 있으나 갑작스런 변화는 적응하기 힘들다
We need factory production of meet!
Dear Kurtzgesagt team,   I didn’t know how I could contact you, so I hope you read the comments: Could you please make a video that explains how you can get enough nutritions when you (daily or not daily) eat vegetarian? I’ve been trying to find reliable information on the internet and in the libary but the things I find often only show how good/bad it is to eat vegitarian, and not how to actually change your diet ( just a regular diet but without meat obviously does not provide everything you need to be healthy). The impartial websites I did found where often vague about how much of something ( for example beans or nuts) I shoud eat. I want to change my diet, mayby just for one day in the week, but if I do it I want to do it right ( and not completely wrong). Because it allready is a big change. Could you please help me, and with me all the people that want to change their diet the right way?  Thank you really much, and if you listen to this request or not, Kurtzgesagt is still my favorite YouTube channel! 🫶  P.S: English isn’t my first language ( Dutch is) ,if you have any tips to improve my English, please let me know!
I eat to stay alive so that information didn't affect me much. I am already a vegetarian but that is due to upbringing. Soo. We will reach an equilibrium where the more intellectually inclined people will not eat meat and vice versa bringing down demand and thus emissions. That was how it was in ancient India.
IDC i love meat especially beef and as he said its the best part about being alive i wont live forever so i will eat is while i still can
Just my thoughts and views after watching this video.  1) So the point is even after hypothetical transformation of all world to Vegan. Co2 emissions from food would reduce by roughly only 20% .  And let's even ignore that this estimate doesn't include many other tech factors, and other non tech factors like ethical bias, religious, economic and cultural and social bias... Would not this still be better... Coz 20% reduction in a long run will have compounding effect... It's not just linear impact.  2) I believe By eating farm grown meat will have significant bad impact on health more than eating a chemical fertilizer added crop food. Idk how true this is... Just an high level analysis  3) Also by letting these animals eat up human useless grasslands how can you guarantee these animals won't pick up any life threatening viruses or bacteria that humans have never seen before..  4) I know farming results in clearing of forests... Problem with current cultivation is the farmers are just exploiting the land and once it becomes barren or useless for them they abandon n move on. This is wrong, sustainable farming is the need of hour... If you do achieve that, at some near point in future, you won't need anymore new agri lands... But to achieve this global leaders and policy makers should educate and subsidise farmers, but reality is exactly opposite the farmers suffer and oligarchs prosper
What about fish meat, wasn't it also a big food market. Even if we doesn't really rear them that much
You're lying Vegetables is specially the most Corn Is bad for your health
I don't eat vegetable Instead I eat meat
The best beef is Better Worst plant
Guys is thair anyone who don't eat beef like me ??
I really want someone to show this video to that bloke on the Joe Rogan podcast
This channel is talented
From 2024, yeah meat might cause some issues with industrial farming but we dont eat meat for like every meal, not even every couple of meals so people can go a couple days without eating meat and it’s perfectly normal. Its not like im contributing any more or less for getting a burger one day or cooking myself a steak, thats ultimately a problem of the people in charge and the massive corps who’ve driven the planet into climate crisis with other industries.   Just my perspective
“Eat ze bugs” No thanks I’ll take beef any day
There seems to be a logical flaw in the reasoning in the last part of the video regarding the vegan diet: as stated at the beginning of the video, a kilo of potatoes will feed a person for less time than a kilo of meat. So to replace all the meat in the diet, would we still need to plant replacement plants? This is not quite getting rid of half of the problems, maybe a third, a quarter, but not half. And we will still need to use plant parts that are inedible to humans
meat is not food, its a dead animal
As someone who has went vegan and vegitarian in there life. I can say from my experiance that it was fairly difficult to get the correct amount of vitamins such as iron or zinc from plants alone. I became very iron deficiant in just a year of being vegan because I didn't realize I needed to take iron pills to keep up. I don't know if I just simply didn't have the money or resources to get the proper vegitables to help my iron levels in my diet or what. But it was incredibly difficult to do so, for me. I think a good balance between the occasional meat intake and vegitables/fruits is the best course of action for myself. If you can go fill vegan and sustain yourself on that, power to you! But keep in mind some people simply don't have the resources to be able to do this as a life style without risking there own health.
I still eat meat but I skip breakfast for intermitten fasting and try to refrain from snack during the days so I guess I am contributing to stop climate change in my own way lol.  Well, most of this is for my health though. I learned that most of our health problem come from eating habits and in our era, it is often problem of eating too much more than eating less.
And this was only on carbon emissions, there's so many other benefits, specially not having to take away lifes for food
In the stat a duck eating a chicken.. is that crazy
I MEAN IF YOU ARE VEGAN
If we stop eating meat then that farmland that was used to grain feed animals would still be needed to feed people. And require pesticides and herbicides.
0:00 - 0:15 out of context is crazy 💀
This was a great video, showing how a plant based diet is good for the environment. But, I really wish you had shared information about the well being of the animals raised in factory farms. Even if we were to say that factory farms are better for the environment, it is surely NOT better for the animals. Let's just talk about cows, since you focused on beef, they are social animals that care about members of their heard. Not ever being given a chance to live their natural way of being is disgusting, not to mention the living conditions of these beautiful animals, which is appalling. I urge you to read the book...'why we  love dogs, eat pigs, and wear cows' by Melanie Joy.
i was eating beef while im watching this
Pure propaganda how you gonna compare shipping vegetables with local beef, if you shipped the beef it's the same difference, 1 of many lies in this video can't be objective have to be political, waste of a channel
f the environment i will eat meat.
I have watched this. And i must have made a comment. But why there isnt? ...... sad
I never know how I should feel about those topics. While I do not object to the truth about the arguments made I see a big problem in responsibility, basically shifting the focus on enormous lifestyle changes. The big changes must be made in changes of economy and legislation. It is crazy to further this narrative of every human being having to drastically change his diet for the climate.
Well Ch4 (Methane) is 1 carbon and 4 hydrogen. Cows don't make this carbon, they eat it. The problem is that we have so many cows that the methane produced so a lot. Also, the corn we eat comes with corn husks, oats have shells, and soybeans have stems. All of which you can't eat. Most of the human food is unable to be eaten, but cows can. Also, it's 2/3 of land is unable to be farmable. Cows can use that land and the human food we can't eat to make food we can eat. While going meat free for one day can help our climate, many people tend to exaggerate the number like "by not eating meat for one day, you can save 6 months worth of Co2" (yes someone said this). Over all, I think that this video was good and highlighted points people needed to hear like animal cruelty and Co2 emissions caused by meat. It's so much easier to transport plants because they can stay good for longer.
meat is not bad that much you think it is the main food in our life
I have tried going vegan (during a period of three years) with occasional meat/fish meal now and then, and it's weakened my immune system badly and my energy levels were really low and fluctuating crazily during the day. I was really careful about the nutrients but i guess veganism is not for everybody
climate...? lmao
"no other bodily function is done multiple times a day and doesnt get old" ahem...... yeah... nothing else... nope. none. nothing. cough.
Most of this is a critique of capitalism, which is the driving force behind most of these problems. You simply won't "make better individual decisions" into fixing these problems. You need state power to impose restrictions on capital, and to get there, you need to organize politically to remove money power from government.
I only eat 🥩
Ahahaaaaaaa buss b karo❤
i like how the monkey eats a cow in the intro
Vietnamese pls 🇻🇳
its all those vegans just hating on eating animals
Hello! Could we get Spanish subtitles for this please? So important to share this to my Latin-american friends :(
just dont eat goat and beef
why not just do every bit possible (Local, good geo-no forest chopping- and so on?)
Epic video! ❤ hey kurgastonk did you read the new jjk chapter?
i gave you another chance and yet, you still double down on meat hate and the way people live. if you care so much about the world, you know what we should regulate? human population
Mmm delicious 😋
I don’t care how bad the climate gets, I’m gonna eat a dang steak
I eat to live, I live to eat.
who owns the sience and when you understand its all biased bullshit this information i will keep eating beef becus i want to be healthy
Tbh the only risk of eating meat is getting CJD
go vegan 🌱💚
Go vegan
9:45 ah yes, my favorite dish. Local, homegrown, 100% organic T Cells
And once again, the true issue is human overpopulation. There were times when billions of buffalo roamed the US, not that much of a problem for the climate. But we have since then far exceeded the amount of humans the earth can handle. We try to put the blame on food choice and production, when the actual issue is the ones who consume. In nature, if food sorces are plenty and adversaries low, populations increase exponentially, until they overpower their habitat. Then they either swarm, or die out. We already did the swarming and inhabit pretty much all of earth we can use. While birth rates have started to drop for most of the world, we still overconsume, no matter what. For earth and the climate, dropping numbers in humans is favourable. To our society, it's not, because as explained in another video, our societies are built on the concept of many young sustaining a few old. Since this is being flipped on the head, and so many are striving to become even older (what for??), there needs to be a global change of thinking and building society. So, basically, there is no nice solution for the problem, as human society is at odds with the rules of the universe.
Kurzgesat what if we theoretically try to geneticly modify cows so that they would Emmitt less gas ? And 1st of all  how hard would it be and 2nd of all how much less global warming would that produce ?
2:26
What is AMAZING is all the "CO2 Budget" concept like if was a solid proven law of physics. Global warming issues are FAR from being pacified. I understand Kurzgesagt had to build the story around something but not having the contradictory makes me think it has a progressist bias.
this video has 389k likes and 16k dislike btw
I think that reducing meat instead of cutting it out is a better solution aspecialy red meat
Vegans are so fake bro i cant beleife that someone would willingly give up meat
Some has forgot sex
I am Vegitarian and I want to stay same all life.
I am veg
Hmmm I smell “xtreme” Vegan bias here!  I did like how it explained the pros of going vegan and cons of remaining omnivores… but here’s the problem… it ONLY shows one side, that side is pro veganism… it ONLY showed the cons of meat and it ONLY showed the pros of vegan diets  I would like the video more if it showed BOTH sides, show some of the cons of veganism, show some of the pros of omnivorous diets.   Let us decide after we saw both sides of the argument, not just one side!  Teh! Vegans these days…
9:00 Such a strange sentence. Of course land without food crops is not ecologically useless! And it's not just because WE can use it to capture carbon, but because letting land to wild nature or letting it rewild fosters biodiversity and, yes, ultimately also provides ecological services to us (which is all that matters apparently)
Humans need meat to stay healthy. How about we stop overconsuming to the point of obesity, then we wont need so much food, problem solved.
Could you also make a video about what vegan diet actually is? How to make it balanced etc... That would be a great help to start changes
That Vegan Kurzgesagt be like:
Earth: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Methane: HEHE I DONUT CARE HEHEHEHEHE
On 8:17 we can see the stonks meme
I will never stop eating meat. I don't give a fuck about the planet.
Wacky idea guys, what if, and i know this is wild but, we limit our meat consumption and genetically modify what we do eat to reduce it output. But also kurzgesagt is what got me into science.
I absolutely love this video and love the logic behind it. However it's missing one argument. If we don't eat them, what happens to all the cows? (Or any animal/plant for that matter) They reproduce and take up land either way. This video only focuses on emissions but not the broader logic of what else we could do. It may limit our push for forced reproduction of animals to go vegan or vegetarian, but as someone in an agricultural area I see firsthand that animals can be crueler and more destructive than we think. If we don't eat them they have to go SOMEWHERE. I hope this channel can make a video focusing on that side of the argument too.
5:00 This is probably the biggest piece of disinfo Kurzgesagt has published.  1 Natural greenhouse gasses, gasses that are released by the circle of life are eventually returned into the ecosystem. The problem has, and will always be emitting non-natural gases from permanent storage. For this the beef c02 calculation is majorly off as it includes methane production of the cattle. 2 The pre-colonial ruminant herds and modern north American cattle herds are roughly equivalent in methane production. Meaning giving back this land to nature will certainly, not magically grow trees but be returned to bison and elk to repeat the supposed methane problem. 3 Cows turn garbage into food. The north American cattle herd eats 70% human inedible food. This also ignores how the supposed bounties of plants we give them, even when edible is still extremely low quality and would be thrown out by most Americans.  8:54 This is wholeheartedly dishonest. The majority of feed is again, human inedible. By saying (insert percent) is used by animals ignoring that these parts are low quality, not fit for human consumption as if they have dedicated plots of soybeans with signs declaring them animal only.   No, eating leafs won't bring us harmoniously with nature all it will do is give you nutritional deficiencies. The problem has, and always will be burning fossil fuels. This video is an anti-human reductionist smear campaign.
Best way to not get cancelled 😅 Biased opinion for obvious....
this thumbnail is wild, a cow with hearts in its eyes? cows don't eat meat. a cow with terror in its eyes would fit.
Nuh uh
Soylent green is a good compromise for climate activists and meat eaters.
Is it that bad? It was for me! I had child asthma, never diagnosed, carried over to adulthood without knowing. There were better and worse months or years. When I was 26 years old, I permanently left Poland when I was born and settled in the UK. WIthin the next 5 years my health went into the dith=ch. My allergies were rampant, I was crawling from antihistamine to antihistamine, never free from debilitating symptoms, my asthma was horrible, I couldn't stop wheezing and coughing. By the time I was 36 I was a wreck. Until the GP I was working for asked my why I was not on asthma meds, that's when I found out it was asthma triggered by allergic reaction to everything. I was on meds until I was 40 when by a happenstance I tried vegetarian diet... and within 6 months I was symptoms free, within 9 months I was meds free. I'm 46 next year, still a vegetarian, without ANY symptoms since 2018. I lost 25 kilograms without any effort, dropped from size 18 to size 10 in a year. My life has changed, because I stopped eating any meat. My GP, the same as back then said I might have had an allergic reaction to everything that IS IN meat- antibiotics, hormones, accumulated chemicals... and my body was recejting it so strongly because I grew up on much more natural diet in Central Europe. The UK highly processed food was killing me. So- happy, slim, healthy, full of life, I say- yes- IT IS THAT BAD. For ME :)
Is here a limit  To. How bad global warming is
What about animal cruelty? lol nobody seems to want to approach that side of things - it's always about agriculture and 'health'. Never about torturing animals.
Short answer: yes it is, together with animal derivatives
the best thing we can do for the environment is not being 8billion people
My God the opening question:  does our diet really play a role in climate change?  The inquisitors are alerted.
abi et yiyelimmi simdi amk
Well depolutation is here so no need to worry 😂
the cows arent actually bad, WE ARE  THE EVIL
What a perfect video.
This is one of the most poultry videos you've ever made.
I’ve been a strict vegetarian since 1968.
No, it is not. And do not let Klaus, Greta or Gates tell you it is.
Well that's that decided. As soon as I'm paying for my own food and can afford it I'll be going vegetarian! It's scary, how little people pay attention to the impact of their food
poultry my favorite
Trees.
Garbage dumps/ wasted food produces more methane than cows. Fact.
I'm never going to stop eating meat unless alternatives are cheaper and better tasting.
Just think about it. An animal needs as many plants as you do to survive. You eat the whole in one meal. You are literally eating 10 years worth of food in one meal.
"Could that title BE any longer?" ... Loved that
Kurz "Eat the Bugs" Gesagt
If this video is going to be about climate change  I'm blaming it on all the water which isn't out in the world. Mass amounts of water just sitting in bottles Not contributing to much else than keeping people's peace of mind
just everyone eat fish
Eat vege-meat, guys! Me? I eat beef.
if quitting meat can save the environment............i still aint gonna do it .cause they taste amazing
Fun fact: growing soy kills more animals that beef, because to grow it almost all animals around will try to eat it, so the soy farmers will kill any animals that try to eat the soy
im glad you brought up the damage being caused for soy so many people glance over that like it doesnt exist
Well we could use methane capture in factory farms to produce methane which is a valuable resource so It reduces emissions and increases profits but it would have to be in a vacuum sealed building with oxygen pumped in but it would decrease beef emissions and allow us to have more methane gas.
I really would like an explanation for why we don't only ship food with ships, as you mentioned it was way more energy-efficient.
9:45 is nobody talking about the fact they’re eating T-CELLS! THAT ARE LIKE 2CM LARGE
Me-thane  You-thane   Mass effects-thane   However you say it know if it isn’t   Meth-ane then it’s just incorrectly pronounced
“Agolf shmitler” and Henry Ford were both against eating meat   Both were vegetarians. Point made.
Too many humans is the actual issue.
why do I see a t cell on a plate
smh people should actually listen for once. we as a society need to slowly stop eating meat by finding alternate solutions
atleast im a vegetarian
there is a Helper T-cell in a plate at 9:46
A cow polutes more than a car? That doesn't sound right
9:45 eating helper T cell???
There's a lot of cherry picking going on that people aren't picking up on... They talked about how all land used for grazing isn't necessarily suitable for other uses, but don't mention that feed used in animals isn't necessarily edible for humans?... The reason why I ask this is that animals have always been and will always be better than humans at processing raw foot materials because they have entire bodily systems to do so for them, whereas us humans literally just use fire.  Let's not mention the lack of in depth look into how veggie patties may affect us compared to meat patties. I'll stick to eating a piece of a cow anyday than stuff something as heavily processed as a beyond meat patty.
I just wamnt hamborger
This shouldn’t be a question and future generations will look back and say, those primitive humans ate meat. Meat is NOT food. There ‘s a ton of scientific evidence (not sponsored by those who gain from it) that the consumption of any animal is detrimental to human health and shortens lifespan. It is responsible for any major chronic illness. You can ignore this and love the good news about your bad habit but your body is never not looking, it needs to deal with what you put in your mouth and remember that it will come back at you. The meat industry is no different from the tobacco industry. Any news in this video, and I didn’t watch it, that claims different is simply incorrect and badly researched.
Really great video! Thanks for it!
when i was 12 i watched this video. im vegeterian since then :)
Easter egg: There's a T Immune Cell on a plate 9:45
I want other to be vegan because I love meet
Climate change hoax
Woke
Meat is not complicated. Killing animals to eat them is not evil. That's it and has been it since the dawn of time. Animals know this, they'd kill you and eat you. Not eating meat leads to death. Your body needs meat. CO2 isn't something we can solve with abstinence, it must be solved in another way.
The monkey 🐒 has EVERYTHING
Where are the other 4 percent of the tofu going? Car production? No, but fr, 4% is quite a lot, globally speaking. Whats it used for?
still eating meat
We are humans, we are never going to have zero effect on things, just accept this
I eat much less meat than americans I eat all that in like a week, not a day And I just don't think I will eat less, I just love meat so much!
Share files and links with Android devices near you
i am from vietnam thank you very much
The thing is you know those rich fuckers are gonna keep eating meat even if they make us stop.
still eating my burgers
That one bird's face was like:  👁👄👁
Climate change is driven by changes in earth's orbit and tilt, solar and volcanic activity and (on longer scale) tectonics, not by CO2 fluctuations. In fact, based on ice core records, CO2 LAGS the temp, meaning temp changes first, CO2 follows. Besides, human contribution to the natural carbon cycle is sub%3 of the total turn-over, it's irrelevant. However, CO2 being plants `food` ,is entirely beneficial to all life forms and it's increase should be celebrated. As for meat, humans have evolved to be a hyper-carnivorous species, based on human anatomy, biology, metabolism and evolutionary history we're not meant to consume plants (except for ripe fruit at times).
Lies and propaganda to make everybody vegan and unhealthy.
A BK ad came when I clicked on the video 💀
Love your videos, this is a point of view that was created to stop factory farming  We Have dramatically shifted from factory farming Thanks to the Humane Society of the United States pressuring all restaurants yes  I was a vegan for this reason for years, now I’ve taken a 180 and eat an all meat an egg and cheese diet I’m healthier than ever before  A lot comes from the sugar companies pulling what the cigarette companies did as far as influencing doctors to smoke cigarettes and sugar got doctors to demonize meat because they had to point the finger at something  so they told you you would get high cholesterol if you ate lots of eggs and meat, and actuality that was just a scare tactic   We need to convert lots of plant farming for animal farming  Bread and sugar plantations  Animal pollution is natural, what is it natural is airplanes cars I get it we need to get around we’re in the middle of shifting over to clean cars and planes    We’re in the middle of another industrial revolution  The details are super nuanced as far as how much food goes directly to humans versus animals and how grasslands where animals grays cleans the air and gives us more animals space  Crop rotation without animals on the land just rotating vegetable crap after vegetable crop depletes the soil  Meats and eggs and cheeses and creams are the healthiest foods on the planet especially those dealing with disease or disorder
Instructions unclear: I am now a persistence hunter in east Africa and creating 0 carbon footprint
The privilege of eating steak, burgers, beef tacos, roast beef subs, and the rest, is way more important than "reducing carbon emissions". Climate alarmists are so misanthropic.
Meat is the most important thing to ever exist
How about fish? How eco-friendly is seafood compared to plants? A video about it would be nice
Brilliant, Thank you
The closer we get to a vegan world the better for the animals and the better for us humans. Never too late to make the switch.🌱🌱
According to NASA "A quarter to half of Earth’s vegetated lands has shown significant greening over the last 35 years." That is the Eartha attempt at homeostasis. No matter where you fall on the climate debate that's pretty cool. (pun intended) The Physics of Atmospheres, 3rd edition,’ Cambridge University Press, 2002. says "“Water vapor accounts for about 97 percent of the total (natural plus man-emitted) greenhouse warming of the planet" At first glancew this seems like enough to debunk man-made global warming (or cooling) but an article I read says "water vapor is often omitted from reports about global warming -– mostly because it is more of a symptom than a cause" so I don't know. I'll always be on the fence about how much man contributes to climate change. Earth has had severe hot and cold periods that lasted for a very long time without any technology at all and far less people so I don't know if we contribute to it or if it is just going to happen anyway. I have seen solid science on both sides of this debate. For every fact someone presents supporting thier belief there is another fact against it just waiting. I do support stopping pollution though and stopping air pollution would also stop a lot of carbon. I also don't like microplastics in the water but that's a different story.
Why was there a helper t-cell on the table?
You missed an important factor which is seafood we kill 120 Billion sea life every year of which a lot of it is fed back to the animals. The ocean is currently dying due to ocean dead zones caused by animal farming and the huge demand for sea food. at the current rate all sea life will be gone by 2040 and given the 2/3rds of the air we breathe comes from the ocean, when the sea life goes so too does 2/3rds of the air we breathe.  When this happens billions of people will die thanks to our greed.
bro made my stomach rumble
If destroying forest for farm land is bad imagine how much land you need to grow y'all veggies
Easy we evolved eating meat so it's something we actually need I mean their isn't a single vegan that's lived their whole life eating only plants plus more animals are killed growing crops then slaughter houses by a lot
Proud vegetarian. Not just me but my family, and my forefathers for hundreds of years have not touched meat.  We are Jains. The most non violent people on the planet.
Bro these arguments make 0 fucking sense, how the fuck does a truck driving from point a to point b in a neighborhood have almost 10x the emission rate of a fucking freighter moving one side of the Atlantic to the other??? Wheres the logic???? I normally trust this channels as the word of god but this is obviously not true
Yeah co2 and methane… thats enough for me, theres too much bullshit
nah did vegan teacher hack his channel
Woah stats can be misleading
This video is amazing!  Well done!  Incredible and fun way to communicate a very complicated topic

I know exactly what needs to be done. 1) To have every single person happy in this world and to have everything what these people want in their life, not to have them save or change their life because of the shortage of resources is a value. 2) To have as many people in this world as it is possible, but with the life where everything you have to save and resources are very limitted for everyone is NOT a value. CONCLOSION: Eat what you want, do what you want, drive diesel cars, fly with jet planes, but DO NOT MULTIPLY as fast as it is now. We have to have less children for their sake. For me it is better to have one children which will have better life with no resource shortage, than to have  many children, but they will have to starve and will have to save every resource in their bad life. It is better to have 1000 000 000 people in the world but not to have any problems with polution, waiste and resource shortages.
The vegan teacher should watch this video
I think the big thing people are forgetting about is the actual nutrition of the food, vegi foods just don't have all the nutritions we need, and its very easy to see this when you look at a vegan that doesn't take supplements, and those supplements are that great either, I think what we should do is focus on finding a humane, low carbon meat production, amd it probably won't be beef, but chickens produce substantially less co2 and we could innovate new things to make it have even less of an impact on the environment
wouldn't a vegan diet quadruple-10x most peoples methane emissions?
I'm glad this video does a better job at explaining why it's okay to cut beef out your diet instead of a vegan yelling "MEAT IS MURDER" in your face
I turn grass into poop by eating it then pooping it out.
I think a reasonable "goal" would be to cut out meat, especially beef, by 20%. It's not catastrophic like asking everyone to stop eating meat, but it would be a very good step.
So we should put a little flame behind cows butts to burn the methane they fart 😅
Poverty saved me from all the downsides of  beef. And meat in general.
Guess the best way we can fight the climate crisis as individuals is becoming vegan. Good that there is so much information out there about nutrition, recipes and many places already serving plant-based food. The best of all, I think is that we won't be exploiting, torturing and killing animals anymore because now we know well about the alternatives we have.
For me to be healthy doesn't seem fair when everything suffers for it.
WE EAT MEAT NOT
I am glad i live in a state where 74% peoples are vegetarian
“Dont cows” :skull:
I love meat so much
can I instead not give a crap and go to kfc because well it's delicious...
Are emissions this bad? What are playing breathing with no emissions?
Best beef < worst plant this proves why I am vegan
80% of amazon rainforest is cut down due to only meat consumption.... The industry is pure torture.  Sure grass feed cows locally is ok, but im not starting to eat meats after 32 years without.  Ex competitor bodybuilder on a vegan diet, but today im vegetarian.  Peace!
Just sayin’, Omnivorism FTW. Gimme Brussels Sprouts, Broccoli, Asparagus, Cabbage, etc as a side with some BBQ with a nice potato or pasta salad, and I’m good! I kind of like tomatoes more than meat. I’ll cut up a tomato and just eat the slices with some seasoning salt, pepper, lemon/lime, and/or tajin. Vinegar goes good on them as well. Pair them with cucumber and vinegar and that’s a healthy snack.
Green propaganda. Fk me
No meat isn't bad for you
2:33 Me, who prefers chicken: _I see this as an absolute win!_
if people were to switch to local foods and ignore big industries for most small to medium cities we coulr spread it out alot plus make town selfseffient. this way towns can eat only what they eed reducing waste and promoting local farming instead of mass.
Everytime in intro the monkey is eating something else
Hey hello anyway we can still meat its a part of evoluton
Bunch of bullshits.
We all know where most emissions come from, and thats not the average working-class citizen eating beef twice a month...
You can't be an environmentalist if you actively eat animal products every day, prove me wrong.  Why do I believe that? 1. Social change requires agency and actively living your values has the potential to express itself in elections and future generations. 2. There are endless amounts of peer reviewed research stating that reduction of animal products is the most impactful action an individual can take and it's not about where or how the food is obtained, but what food is chosen. 3. Companies will only update what they supply if the demand changes and politicians would be quickly voted out if they updated agriculture funding or laws without public support.  Most environmental solutions do not start with individuals, but this one does ( especially in western countries with large food diversity) We should aspire for a world of imperfect vegans.
EAT ZE BUGZ AND BE HAPPY
7:20 got me laughing the bird said, "could this title be any longer?"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣!
beef
for the next video can we have a seafood one about like octopus, fish, and squid?
I'm a MSc student in Resilient Farming and Food Systems (BSc in Animal Sciences), happy to say the content of this video matches the many papers and lectures I have read. Although, I am starting to realize that this video is already a bit outdated in some details! Things are moving quickly...  Would be interested to see a follow-up that takes into consideration things like the EAT Lancet Planetary Diet, discussion over the applications of Life Cycle Assessment, and protein equivalents in comparing between species. Something else at play here is also the three narratives around environmental solutions: production narrative, consumption narrative, and circular narrative.  I also wish this video incorporated more detail about local as well. In my opinion, "local" was simplified here to emissions. A focus on emissions isn't what brings about the social change. Crafting local food systems is a major part of creating more mindful people with healthy habits and stable communities. That is definitely where the consumption narrative to eat less meat and have a healthy relationship with food starts. A bit bummed that those aspects could easily be disregarded in lieu of "comparatively high" emissions. Of course, on a ship that carries millions of kgs of freight, emissions per product (or kg) will be lower. Doesn't really change the fact that the ship still guzzles all that fossil fuel regardless. Hence, why I would like to see an expansion on the application of the Life Cycle Assessment.   However, in the context of a video that will reach millions, I understand a conclusion leaning toward vegan/vegetarian -- it's a (easy) step to already reduce. But be aware that a little bit of meat in the diet is very well known to have less of an emissions impact than a vegan diet, when that meat is from animals that have up-cycled marginal lands and recycled our food waste. <3  Just things I wish more people knew about, and I admire Kurzgesagt's ability to make it palatable in 10-12 minute tidbits ;-) Hope to see more about this!
When you said "especially in Brazil", as a Brazilian, I wanted to cry. We have this really nice and important forest and we are burning it down, wtf
There have always been farting animals. It isn't clearly causing the recent climate change. The reason is that we are pumping oil to make devices, that have been engineered to break up in a few years generating over three times the carbon footprint just so consumerism can continue. Kurzgesagt is not going to talk about that, because a big part of their revenue is donations from billioniares. Blaming climatechange to animals so that these people can get away with that.
Demographic decline of young people
Animal products are NOT AT ALL nutritious, that is a myth. Nutrition goes further than protein (and other macronutrients), in fact eating a lot of protein is detrimental for your health. A human only needs about 35g up to max 50g per day and NOBODY in the western world is lining up at the protein deficiency line in the hospital. They’re at the CHD and cancer line, both a direct result of excess fat and animal protein. Meat production, or turning non digestible materials into meat, it the MOST inefficient process that exists. Eating the plants directly and cutting out the middle cow would not only make the process much more efficient, we would safe an incredible amount of land, avoid soil erosion, destruction of habitats, pollution of groundwater and water streams, yes even avoid world hunger (each piece of meat is a slab in the face of a hungry child, nobody is aware, it’s disgusting). I could go on like this. One acre of land can feed much more people from plant products than from meat. There’s a lot at stake for the meat mafia so misinformation is spread so people wouldn’t care. Vastly most chronic diseases are a direct result of eating a meat based diet, pharmaceutical companies and the health sector are benefiting from this. 3 times a day injuring the body with a devastating western diet makes the body send out signs that we do something wrong, we call them diseases and silence the body with medication until it escalates into a chronic condition. This is when medical procedures come in place, very beneficial. Most health issues go away when we listen to the bodily SOS screams that we call symptoms and divert our diet towards a whole food plant based lifestyle. The meat industry is a disgusting highly profitable business (because it is highly subsidized) that kills the animal in a horrible way, the planet and the consumer. Run away from it and look into whole food plant based lifestyle!
I think hunting for food might be better
Is this WEF funded or what? Psyopsing the agenda into people, how about you scientist pull out how much impact one single vulcano eruption has on our climate? As we have had some in recent times, I'd imagine it absolutely stomps cows and everything we humans can produce. People be wary of these channels even if they have some gold nuggets
Dont shipped veggies get short transport to end destinations as well? The locally sourced argument doesnt make sense. 😮
Thank’s
Plants absorb carbon and produce oxygen. Team 🅱️eef
Too bad that veggie patty tastes like a cow patty.
9:06 but still, even though if everyone, in a city did a beef-free or vegan diet, the local butcher will still be producing meat for exporting. You see the 3 billion/2 billion hectares is going to be used for industry or new cities and building anyways, no one would want to plant trees nowadays :/
I dont get it, yes using ship is efficient but didn't you still need to send those avocados from port to market or buyer house using same method like meat?
2:51 POTATO ATTACK
0:03 I can think of one thing
I wonder how much meat is wasted each year and how that affects meat production. If people were to cut down on waste especially meat, would that have a sizable impact? And what numbers of waste is lost from both the people selling the meat and the people buying it.
(Sees that beef is bad for the environment)  Oh no! (Takes a bite out of burger) Anyway.
I think the large carbon footprint of the food we eat is that large because we need to feed a lot of people. The problem isn't what we eat, it's overpopulation.
Being vegan is a choice, not a solution!
You lost me at climate change
The thing is that 70% of the world’s oxygen comes from the sea so wouldn’t it be more effective to target the sea if you want to less co2?
lots of beef going on here
one thing the comparison at the start doesn't take into account, when comparing emissions per gram of protein, it is becoming very clear to diet sciences that meat protein is far better for you, more easily absorb, than vegetable protein. So it's not even an equivalent comparison comparing protein grams to protein grams.
Animal proteins, such as meat, are considered complete proteins because they contain all essential amino acids. They are typically easier for our bodies to digest because they're more similar to the proteins in our own bodies. This is reflected in their high biological value (BV) - a measure of the proportion of absorbed protein from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the body.  On the other hand, plant proteins are usually more difficult to digest. They often lack one or more of the essential amino acids, making them 'incomplete' proteins. Additionally, the presence of other compounds like fiber, phytates, and tannins in plant foods can inhibit protein digestion and absorption.  Earth didn't come into existence for sole purpose of sustaining any form of life. It's a coincidence. Earth doesn't have feelings. It's just a "rock" in space that we just happen to be stuck on for now. Instead of just pushing vegetarianism and veganism why not also provide temporary and alternative solutions. Why not make those solutions more palatable. But no, hur dur beef and dairy bad, but you go eat meat if you are evil.
Well, if we are to lower our food consumption we could turn to alcoholism and chronic smoking. It would help us lower food consumption and look lean without exercise.
bill gates payed you alot of cash for this vide 🤑🤑🤑🤑🤑
You can decide what do with this information: me: goes to Carl's Jr
This is why technoblade havr 500M potatos in minecarft :)
merci
5:05
so let me get this straight, methane is only a problem if the plant matter first goes through a cow, right? if it just decomposes on its own once the plant dies, the "natural" way, the way mother Gaia intended, it magically is not a greenhouse gas anymore?
9:45 killer T cell served hot
Great video ❤ What about doing a follow up about cultivated meat?
Love it!!🎉❤❤❤
Fun fact: eggs is also considered meat
Climate change won’t stop me
it has 16k dislikes on 2nd june
That Vegan Teacher wants to know your location.
most nature friendly food is not vegetable, human feed.
as someone on true carnivore diet, avoiding carbs lowers my appetite, as well as prevents numerous issues of carb based lifestyle. in the short term, supporters of plant diet will deflect carbon emissions towards meat, but i think in the long term, people will have ulterior issues when it comes to plant based diet. think of meat as nutrition gold (and i mean, we are made of meat. meat is a complete food, deal with it). eating plants will have consequential effects of deflated nutrition, aka empty calories in excess carbs/calories and/or toxic chemicals from heavily eating plants.  right now i can comfortably eat 1lb of meat a day, 2 if i'm active. seriously. in terms of a cow, that's one cow every two years (one year if active). the bad press of meat eaters come from people that are eating meat along WITH carbs. like eating hamburgers/hotdogs with buns, plus fries, plus soda, plus barbecue sauce. eat a pure carnivore diet without all of the "luxury" of carbs and you will find you don't overconsume on protein/fat. people think meat eaters eat it and will die from excess fat. yes, the fat tastes good, but it only tastes good in the beginning, when the body says you are hungry. you will find you will stop eating fat once you've had your fill, same for protein. it's really not easy to overconsume on pure meat. only when you had your flavorings and sauces or eat with bread and ketchup and shit, is where the overeating occurs. carbs stimulate appetite.  seasoning is one of the biggest scams of judging good food, and once you add sugar in the mix, you have a recipe of overeating, no matter what you eat. i sympathize now with people that "don't season their food". they eat the food the way it is and tastes the way it should taste.  we talk about carbon emissions, but what about unnecessary carbon storage in the form of fat? tackle obesity before the meat eating. and we tackle obesity by reducing carbs, promoting keto. so there is a biggest problem in the sense that we are not promoting co2 consumers, but instead we are just inflating the human population. we are trying to reduce emissions by changing the diet, but only to balance the emissions for industry growth. which is ultimately the problem of this propaganda. we're not reducing overall emissions, just making room for ever increasing industry.
Namaste 🙏
"Food is the best thing in life, no other bodily pleasure is that good and never gets old" Me: "Well there is another...."
Meat has better quality protein tho
…And some airliners 100 kg.
Awesome information, the only thing I find was missing was the impact of growing vegetables using pesticides and so killing billions of insects and rodents and snakes in the process.   Overall moderation is the best policy i think
Anyone telling you to do the exact same diet s as them, is misinformed
if everyone became vegan and we didn't cut forests food is ok
Climate change can happen during holiday.
Maybe... we can storace the methan gas instead of decreasing the meat consuption.
Whatever... I am still on the idea of eating meat in same amount.
I feel like eating meat just one time a month will help SO much in pollution, not even become vegan. Just not consume huge portions of meat each day as it is unhealthy too.
Take that best practice 9kg CO2 for beef and adjust *that* for nutrient density and environmentally meat is starting to look pretty good ...
meat contains alot of vitamins proteins iron and thing that boost your stregth so meat is not that  bad take fish for example its a very healthy meat
One thing to keep in mind is that a vegan diet is actually unhealthy because we need to meet
did anyone notice the T cell at 9:45?
You left out a huge factor...we would need 800 times the crops to move society to a vegetable diet(also start calling it that freak name, those fascist vegans)
As a meat lover: Y'all! Vegans are good people. We can't hate on people who are trying to save the planet. Ofc most of them didn't know about emissions but now that WE, meat lovers know, we could really eat less meat and be more "Plant based diet" societies. We really don't want this planet gone and we do want it healthy right? So we can stop eating meat or at least, eat less meat. meat is good I know but, sometimes you have to do something you don't like to make someone else happier. We could all eat less and less meat and stuff. We can't STOP eating meat I know but, we can start changeing slowly so future us can eat less and less. Thanks for reading! W or L ?
Meat (specially pasture raised) is so health for our health, very important for kids brain development… I love meat and how good it makes to me body, it’s wonderful for my muscles, and makes me satisfied for longer. Everything in a cow is so good, bones, collagen, organs…  My kids and I are a meat lover!!
Carbon budget is an artificial limitation placed for political reasons. The reason why you can't make steel indestructible by adding more carbon, more CO2 brings diminishing results in warming.
Let everyone eat what they want and that's it. It's beautiful that everyone should have a choice, that's why democracy exists
oh no! eating meat is bad! anyways im gonna eat my KFC
What’s not mentioned is that the pasture lands we use have over the years become accustomed to cattle raising, they’re not going to turn back into forests and they can’t grow human crops, the only thing you could do with them is put buildings on them. A further point not discussed, is that the amount of greenhouse gases produced from livestock is significantly less in developed countries than developing countries. That’s because we have more environmentally friendly practices and so on, so their impact on the environment is not that significant. Where they produce way more greenhouse gases is in poorer countries, that’s the real impact, but at the same time they’re not going to change their diet or adopt cleaner methods. So in reality, beef consumption can be reduced although it won’t be as impactful as you might think in the West, developing nations where it would be more impactful are less likely to stop, and greenhouse gases from people, travel, and industry are far more abundant in the West.
no, meat isnt bad. its actually the perfect food for us humans. what is bad however is vegetarianism and veganism since humans, from day 1, were designed to be meat eaters, and not to eat leaves and grass like sheep. Like 90% of vegans quit the diet. most of them also develop lots of health problems and deficiencies that go away once they start eating meat again. Humans werent designed to eat this much plant. thats literally why it helps us crap, cuz the fibre is made of mostly cellulose polymers from Beta-glucose monomers which we dont have the enzymes for to break down so it just passes through us. it also can reduce nutrient absorption.
So which beef is the best, an which is the worst, and where can I buy the best beef?
Now make a video exclusively about C02 and the evidence around its role both positive and negative for the planet and for humans
Is Meat Really that Bad?
No thanks guys, I am not going vegan.
Stop the cap
@WhatIveLearned check this out
I watched this while eating a humburger
Honestly, veggie patties are delicious, it would have affects on us BUT, the idea isn’t that bad (in my opinion), to go vegetarian or vegan-.
I usually like Kurzgesagt videos but this one is full of half-truths and misinformation. just a few examples, local transportation costs apply on both local produce and international because your avocado needs a lift from the dock to the supermarket. another one is that we can use less space for growing tofu. animal protein is much denser, and you need less of it to get the same protein level, per 100gr beans or tofu have 8-9gr of protein and beef has around 26-30 gr so you need to eat more plant-based foods, that takes area to grow. Not talked about are the effects of single type of growth on land, pests and pesticides and many other things. Real change should start with reducing waste and consumption. the amount of food that we grow and throw (plant and animal) is a real problem. we need to waste less
2:40 “don’t let them know your next move” Eats freshly caught fish, 0 emissions(assuming your using a lure to catch them and not worms that I am sure are grown at an industrial scale)
Yes.
Y'all crushed this video. Super well done.
oh my god i've never seen such beautiful animation on a science video
How much of the atmosphere is CO2? .04% at .02% plants don't grow. Also didn't need 12 minutes to say, "NO IT ISN'T".
9:44 anyone else see the t cell?
Not quite accurate.
The Loveliest Lies Of All
Not having children is going to benefit the environment more than becoming a vegan.
it worked for billions of years, it can still work for millions more
The carbon footprint on Lamb from New Zealand sold in the UK including the travel was still less than UK Lamb, a few years ago. Farming emissions vary from country to country. We've been told New Zealand with 5million population grows food that feeds 40million people, but the carbon footprint stays with NZ, I don't think that's fair. NZ has more carbon efficient farming and it's getting more efficient by the year.
I eat burger
So trucks aren't used to ship plants from the harbor to stores? Very biased video
EAT LESS MEAT AND STOP IT. I have heard many people who go vegan or vegetrainian are having no health troubles and living happy guilt free life. MEAT IS HARMFUL FOR YOU AND OUR WORLD. AND ANIAML CRUILITY☹☹☹😷😷🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲😩😩😩😱😱😱
Regenerative Ag tells a different story.  Look up "Carbon Footprint Evaluation of Regenerative Grazing at White Oak Pastures" for another point of view.
I changed my diet into vegetarian after looking into this more, will try my best :D
Beef stonks go down😂
Did the clickbate or is it only me like before its meat hate now lov
I'm sold. Kill off all the cows and enjoy pork and chicken.
I will eat meat forever. No one can stop me. 😁
No meat is awesome. I’d eat only beef if I could
There is no such thing as neutrality in science. It starts with a false premise that is inevitable to feed people without emissions. The conventional way to produce food such as monoculture is more profitable and no farmers so they will keep emitting. The production of meat will destroy our society faster because we use a lot o water. About 50% of the drinkable water in USA and 70% in Brazil. The emotion methane of this cattle is even worse than carbon monoxide and dioxide. Basically we need to stop eating meat and only eat organic food or we will face our end as society soon.
Only ogs know that the original thumbnail was meat hate
I think everyone should lessen their meat consumption. You don't have to be vegetarian or vegan, it's not all or nothing. and most rational people would understand you not wanting to change everything about your diet. Even going for chicken instead of beef is a win! Having meat only once or twice a week does a lot already. I still eat meat if it's offered to me, or I'm at a restaurant. But i don't buy red meat to my home, and only eat meat a few times a week if even that. And it's better than nothing. Little things count, not only for the planet, but for your personal health
I hate this evil wokester channel. It does so much harm to the culture of scientific inquiry by politicizing it.  That said anything that will stop or lessen the cruelty of slaughtering animals for pleasure is good.  Even this vile channel
Eat the bugs!  - Brought to you by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation!
The argument about methane seems to be wrong. The amount of methane in the atmosphere is determined by the current amount of animals living. It does not keep adding methane like CO2 emissions from fossel fuels (which is not normally available in the carbon cycle).
5:32 ah, yes, the Fart-o-Meter!
1:53 falling bull incoming.
Wonderful topic and coverage on this video! Thank you for including your sources document as well, wonderful for future reading. Cheers!
what about sea food???
What about animals turning things we can’t eat into food? I wanted to know more about that topic
8:18 Im still quite angered this piece music wasn't released yet!
This author probably vegan. 💁🏻‍♂️
I, as a vegetarian, personally believe that there is nothing wrong with eating meat, in fact, quite the opposite. Animals emit CO2 from breathing and methane from waste, both of which heat  up out planet. So you should feel good the next time you eat a big mac or something, I just personally don't like the taste
So go vegan or doom the planet maybe. . . time to order another burger
Hmmmmm,so,one way to minimize global warming is killing more cows...sounds delicious as hell
It’s not farts but burps that emits most methane from ruminants !
👍👍
Do you drink almond milk
no
the answer to the title is 🚫
Without flesh man no longer evolved as he is today😄
The video looks amazing as always, but this video is spreading some misinformation.  The claim that cows would take in human grade food and add methane in the atmosphere is very misleading.   Cows eat very little human grade food from crops.  And cows don’t “add” methane to the athmospehere. It’s a circular system, meaning methane gets broken down in a decade or more.   The amount of livestock has been around the same in the west for a long time now, so this claim is absolutely misleading.
0:03 bro has not heard of his mom
I wish to cause harm and dismay to the future generations. What's the most non eco friendly type of meat?
U are cruel
No meat
Metro.
I’m going out to dinner 🍽 tonight with my mom 👩🏻 and dad 👨🏻 and my
This doesn't account for the increase in crop production to make up for a calorie deficit from giving up meat. Growing enough plants to feed everyone the same amount of protein in plant alternatives. There would still be a net benefit, but probably not as much as the video estimates. It's arguably better to deal with methane because even though it's a worse greenhouse gas, it's short term compared to the heavy tax of carbon. Also, a surprising amount of people don't know this, but feed crops are not the same as edible crops. Most of the grain grown for cattle feed is not edible by humans, and changing to human edible crops would be extremely labor intensive and very expensive. Good luck convincing farmers to give up the profitability of meat production and switch entirely to less profitable types of crops. Damaging the food industry would be a  dangerous move when we are in the middle of a massive diet transition. Overall, the benefit to the climate of eliminating meat production would be similar to the benefit of changing the rules of meat production, and eating slightly less of it.
Yes
Ufff This video was excellent for me, and I was beginning to realize that eating meat in the end wasn't that bad either.
I liked this video and I was surprised to see it differentiated the numbers on local vs factory beef at all because many don’t seem to know there’s even a difference. I’d love to see a second video going more in depth on local food because I actually thought grass fed cows produced way less methane then factory cows. I’d really love to see numbers on local food also that wasn’t shipped anywhere and instead just purchased from the farm. My last numbers request is on permaculture methods and other extended organic growing methods that claim to be carbon negative, I’d be so excited to see a video on permaculture food forests animated in this video style. Thanks for making this video open to all sides, I’m personally a big fan of taking any little steps to lower carbon emissions and improve animal welfare.
but hey atleast 0% is from bull penises
What about the hypoglyciemic?
Wow. Just omitting facts like soy farming erodes the soil, making future crops near impossible to grow. And the fact that vegan diets are inherently unhealthy and lead to far more disorders and diseases. 😂. Good try tho.
There is lab fish meat, Kurzgesagt
Non veg always fk veggies and vegans.
I have a tooth ache right now. So there goes whatever pleasure I’m supposed to have 3 x a day. 🤔
7:13 woah mongolian gers look so neat
As an intelligent species that is empathic. We need to progres as a society to stop killing others animals when we can live without it.
Third of worlds bovines live in India. 300 million. Which don't emit at all do they? 🤔  Would we kill all cattle in the west if they weren't for food? We would need to make them not exist anymore not to release methane.
Your channel is now influenced too much. so goodbye
I have never and am never eating meat in my life. I will also  reduce my dairy consumption. I can afford to do it. So I will make that choice.
So, in summary, if eating meat (which is an ethical consideration in itself) there is also an ethical sub-decision between animal welfare and climate impact where they are at odds. From an ethical perspective eating free-range meat raised on grasslands that couldn't support crops or carbon capture but only doing so occasionally because of sustainable production capacity seem like a potential good option if you're OK with consuming other animals. Not commented here, probably because of volumes, is also eating native game meat shot in a sustainable manner for population control, which may be the most ethical option. Because humans hunted down predators to avoid threats, prey populations are a potential problem if not managed both from an environment and the individual animals perspective (overpopulation can lead to boom-crash population cycles where lots of animals suffer), and the by-product of that population control is probably the most ethical meat you'll get.
I have a lot of respect for vegans but NOT when they use misinformation to get what they want. Props to people like this creator who don’t do that
One of the main problems that you're dealing with by researching this is everybody's body deals with things differently. Things that hurt someone might not hurt someone else that's why the testing comes out the way it does
Sounds to me like we'd be better served by researching ways to strip methane out of the atmosphere, than by advocating for dietary changes.
0:01 well there is something else coming to mind.
That’s kind of funny I always have a veggie patty. And to meat lovers it tastes just like a normal meat patty!
Lo tuve que ver subtitulado, y lo vi después de ver el vídeo de hace 4 años en el canal en español, el cuál me dejó algo triste por ni siquiera mencionar el veganismo cómo opción, este vídeo definitivamente rectificó eso, y me hace admirar más este canal, es increíble.
Climate will always change. We’ll adapt or we won’t.
Wait wait… did i get this right? If  we where to take 1ton of potatoes and 1ton if beef and transport it 20km away, somehow transporting beef would produce more carbon?  thats to me sounds like “1kg if metal is heavier then 1kg of feathers”…. Doesnt make sense. And now second, even if we did not make beef, cows and animals would still exist and produce same if not more waist, cause we would not be controlling it… so it doesnt make sense to say its bad. And third, so even if we did not produce meat, carbon output would still be more then what we would save… so it doesnt change a thing. So in reality, choose whatever you wanna eat, but one isnt better then the other, dont feel like you are better then other people just because you dont eat meat people
i dont eat meat ..but nothing wrong with meat what is wrong is cruelty to animals and suffering animals and factory farms that need to be closed down...better to ethically hunt , buy ethical natural and eat roadkill/carrion.

fuck vegans, eat meat if you want
Even if Veganism could cure cancer, there will always be people like Pears Moregum who'd find flaws with it. Nobody is forcing anybody and yet the meat eaters are so against veganism. "I don't eat food unless there are 3 dead animals in it" is the funniest joke in my work place well... funniest after fart and burp jokes.
The long-distance (ship) transport of plant-based food compared to the short-distance (truck) transport of meat does not appear to be an apples-to-apples comparison..  The container ship with my avocado onboard does not pull up to my supermarket.  Both require truck transport at some point in production/distribution.  Did I miss a statement addressing this?    I've seen a lot of information (some misguided) about bias due to sponsorship, but I still like/trust these videos.  However, when the more detailed comparisons (like this one on transport) appear lopsided, it make listeners question objectivity of the meta-analysis (which is really the bottom-line of this video, and many others).
Vegan is the tight way to go
9:44 why was someone eating a T cell
Thanks for the video. I will still eat the same amount of meat as much as I can. I am happy this way, and it's my life. So don't come here to annoy me.😁
People are saying that kurzgesagt is lieing cuz rich people are donating money to them stupid
I could live without beef, I guess... I already eat it once a week at best...
i wonder if the beef protein/vitamins are digested easier than plant-based
this is complete horeshit! all lies, raisnig free range/grass grazing cattle woul'd be a negative carbon emmision, stacking cows on top of eachother in a tiny warehouse and trucking food to them is very carbon positive and bad for the cows and in turn who consumes the cow. switching to grass fed grazing cows would hurt monsanto and the corn monopoly not the beef industry and would boost organic materials levels in those grazing areas witch would help pull even more carbon out of the ground and air.
🐔💉🍗 😷😴 💊this explains all the process by chicken industry
So many religions about these days:  Mother nature=good.  Man= bad or sinner. Cows are a product of man. Therefore cows=bad Wilder beasts and buffaloes are natures work. Therefore wilder beasts and buffaloes = good.
The avocado also needs to be locally distributed.
Did they take into account that the feed for cows are the rejected stuff from the humans? Like when a farmer grows oats, the good quality oats are sold to the supermarkets for human consumption. Then there are "feed oats" the lower quality oats. Still perfectly safe to eat, but not nearly as desirable. That stuff is fed to the animals. What would the cost of food be if we didn't have animals to feed the reject stuff to? Who would the farmer sell it to? As a farmer, if I have a bad year (for ex: drought..most farmers do not irrigate..or too much rain and much of the crop drowns out) then we have lower quality crops. Without the animal market, we would be out of business so fast, it's ridiculous (you'd be surprised how much grain is sold as feed quality).   Without a secondary market to sell to, the cost of food will increase exponentially to make up for the losses. Then we'll have nothing but the big factory farms (more control over our food supply, which is what "they" want...ahem...mr. gates).
We have to remember there is a HUGE money trail in the vegan movement. There is a lot more profit for the big guys in selling soy than in beef. My great grandpa was almost 110 years old when he died, he had a meat heavy diet, all raised on his own farm. Never spent a day in the hospital due to sickness. Beware of biased studies (as most are these days, no matter what the subject is). As a farmer, I'm pretty sure we destroy a lot more birds nests on the ground with spring seeding that the cows destroy from grazing in pasture lands. Here in Canada, we're also not clearing bushland to feed the cows because they love to eat leaves as well as grass. I do see farmers clearing any kind of tree to get that little extra land for their crop. Rows of windbreaker trees are constantly being destroyed for that extra land. It drives me nuts. Pasture lands support local wildlife a lot more than fields of soy or other crops.
You know that methane has a natural cycle that is one to one with the animals so it is different form adding new carbon to the air
I feel so bad for people who watched the video made by 'what ive learned' and thought this video was wrong 💀
wait a second... in the very beginning not the intro (pre intro i guess) there was a cooked turkey on the table... then there are other birds...
So, obviously we can't produce meat for 8 billions people in a sustainable way. The good thing is that we don't need meat! :)
smart for everyone to eat at least a little less meat
Pure propaganda paid for by billionaires
Would eating insect be a sort of solution? Fewer emissions plus you still get the protein.
where is your proof or just a mic?
Well yes but humans are supposed to eat meat we have eaten meat for the time humans have existed and its much rarer to get an allergie against meat compared to nuts or fruit.
no.
Glad to see acknowledged that a vegan diet is necessary for the pressing climate crisis.
Kurzgesagt has been hacked by That Vegan Teacher
I eat chicken for lunch at home and go for vegan options for at dinner or when eating out
IMO It's very sad that this video doesn't go into the ethical side of it.  I know, it's a Science channel, but how we treat life around us is observable, studiable, and have objective ramifications on those around us.    There are metrics we can observe and point out regarding meat's treatment of animals, without going too hard into philosophy, that are missing out in this video.
No
Doesn't methane get re-absorbed into the biosphere ?
Chicken are decent people.
I love how the beginning of the video tries to make us believe it is going to treat both plant-based food and meat equally and then the video starts by saying "Ok now, I am going to oppose 3 arguments against meat.  But not against plants? this is biased and biasing.
“There are all sorts of ways to rear cattle.” 99% of farmed animals in the US (sentienceinstitute) and 70% of farmed animals in Europe (foodingredientsfirst) live in CAFOs. It’s a bit disingenuous not mentioning this when most people—who will vehemently say they love animals—have never thought of where it comes from. And how it’s so cheap.
0:00 unless ur bf fnf
You didn't even mention lab grown meat
Definitely not sponsored by Bill Gates foundation
Meat is bad
Hi! I have a concerning problem with interpreting the sources that are used in this video. More specifically the use of sources that are clearly linked to "scientific research" from your sponsor themself. I hope you can understand that I can't help but seriously question your impartiality and independence on a heated topic like this one.  I think mentioning your sponsors in the beginning of the video and stating your dependence on them should be an obvious one, as you are reaching a lot of young watchers who like to believe that your content is scientifically correct.   Don't get me wrong. The way this is presented is fun to watch and learn! I see however a lot of red flags in what information is specifically chosen for this video, and the way it is obviously linked to your sponsor...
💀
Your torah is showing
One reason I don't trust you is that you advocate for more trucks and not trains, which if you look at one trucks emissions vs one trains emissions, the truck even if its a electric truck, will produce over 100 times the amount of emissions per kg as one train does. So stop advocating for more trucks, and tell people to ask their local politicians to invest in more trains and train infrastructure. and to advocate to stop lithium production since it uses Child slave labor and it produces more emissions then 5 diesel trucks do in there lifetime.   If I made any mistakes in my grammar or spelling please tell me.  Thank you.
So far, I've learned that flying a cow is worse than flying an airplane, and I can put grass fed on anything despite it not being grass fed. I'm going to use a grass fed keyboard to type this and there is physically nothing you can do to tstop me.
I think we should addmit now that developed countries just produce way more carbon emmissions than developing countries and americans and europeans should really cut down on its meat I mean it will make both them and the world healthier
propoganda
İn the 9:44 of video in left-down you can see a T cell
I think that beef is not have large impact on emission when we compare it with Factories
I eat mostly beef on my carnivore diet and this video makes me feel 10x better about eating beef knowing it's an insult to you climate activist idiots
Gatesgesagt
Everything changes when you find out these videos are paid for by Bill Gates foundation
Only one thing could impact on Climate change is.  "Change yourself and your diet to (atleast) vegetarian"
Watch "How Kurzgesagt Cooks Propaganda For Billionaires" and thank me later!
Propaganda
If the best beef is twice as bad as the worst plants, then there must be meat that can be grown (not bugs) that is on par with plants. Also people don't seem to be factoring in that you need to grow plants to feed animals. Also, also, carbon emissions don't really drive climate change, it has diminishing returns on heat after a certain point and we are way past that.
cows are carbon neutral like every metabolism. this is just the carbon cycle.  crude oli never reaches this. we use billions of gallons a day, says Statista.  the sewage, the digestion under the town, is full of methane, caused by vegans. fiber cause methanogenesis. meateaters won't cause methanogenesis, in meat is no fiber.  (we use meat and animal fat, milk, cheese for energy, energy means CO2 /O2 excange = no methanogenesis is possible)  eat more grass finished meat. stop corn finished meat.  Corn-fed animals taste better (see popcorn) and are unhealthier (Omega6 Omega 3 ratio and so on)  🙂😄And vegans cause more toilet paper, toilet paper causes more methane in the wastewater. Totally undigested cellulose, digested by microbes to produce methane. There is almost no oxygen under the city, because CO2 in the air is heavier than oxygen. No oxygen means methanogenesis. Look up methanogenesis.  Look up sewer gas, landfill gas, sewage treatment gas.
Cant believe I used to believe this bill gates propaganda channel. So gross you say you are 'mostly' viewer funded. That's not even true in a relative sense.
How about we play a game, show me your sources, and I’ll show you mine. Not to change opinions, but to get a perspective that is of the outgroup rather than the ingroup. I utilized the kurzgesagt’s website to find their opinions on the topic, as well as their sources which include various different studies and expert opinions. As well as in depth research discussions that account for all of the different variables that go into the agricultural field of carbon emissions. An example being on how farmers in South America are burning down the Amazon, to increase range for their livestock because it is way more profitable than the alternative. Which is killing the rainforest, and releasing a bunch of carbon, as well as increasing emissions from the animals that they have placed on that land. Now it’s your turn, Give me some sources. And they can be fairly vague or as specific as you wish.
It's worth noting that native grassland and prairie is actually one of the fastest disappearing and rarest biomes on earth these days, and pasturing ruminants on it is a good way to maintain that land's biodiversity. This is why my dad and I pasture horses on our land. Also, native grasslands and prairies are carbon sinks themselves.
Vegans forget that you grind up the same animal life as a field is tilled. You degrade the topsoil if a till cycle is not observed, making the environment even less nutrient dense for other competeing or coexisting life. Cow methane can and does have solutions but they are expensive. The majority of off gassing comes from the decay cyle of feces. There are serval proven ways to harvest that methane as fuel. Methane can be used as a fuel if sequestered. Its not black and white and if you virtue signal then you are evil for demonizing anothers survival.
"Is Complicated", well it look prettyu simple for me ...
the answer is meat is bad plant is good lol your questions are the below average mouth breather default go-to questions... 1) The amount of crop land used to feed animals would feed the entire earth 3x over. no need for more space at all. 2) where do you think the animals get their nutrients man? they dont naturally generate them, they get them from the crops which they digest then meat eaters eat (So youre eating 2nd hand nutrients when you could just cut out the middle man)
And who paid for this video? 🙃🙃
Just use selective methane extracter powered by solar energy in grazing areas by enclosing it in a green house then burn tge methane or just extract hydrogen and leave carbon to make polymer or fires and use it
But, more people going vegan wouldn't mean expanding crop lands to balance the energetic value of 1 beef per person?
I don’t give a SHIT about my beefs “carbon hoofprint”.  😮😮 Cows fart! Duh!
We must not forget that it is meat-eating that has allowed the human brain to evolve to such an advanced state.  And our brains still require nutrients that are almost exclusively supplied by meat eating. Arachidonic acid is a fatty acid found almost exclusively in meat,  and vegans need to accept the fact that this chronic deficiency causes dementia to progress faster.  It pains me to hear of the devastation of domestic animals,  but that does not mean we can go back to the days of the apes  at the cost of our lives and the intelligence of our descendants!
Why would you feed pigs exclusively feed crops? You could literally feed them garbage and they'd be fine
Ima keep eating beef and other meats. But to help I'll make my experimental energy source
you vill eat ze bugs
Animal agriculture is the #1 source of deforestation. Not to mention famine , drought , and disease. I know it sounds ironic that its a large contributor to famine, but think of it this way, we use over 60% of our crops to feed animals. We feed 70 billion livestock a year, why can't we feed 8 billion humans? This food for our food requires a lot of water and of land. 56% of U.S water actually goes to animal *feed alone*. If eating meat was about survival, its in our best survival to stop now, unless we wanna die of drought and famine. Also for the record, animal farming (because it requires monocropping to feed these billions of animals for food) damage the soil and deplete it of natural b12. This isn't sustainable. Our demand is too high and red meat is linked to cancer and many diseases.
Woketarded channel
Thnx
11:36 hey psst there still a few extra shiny calendars left
basically we are overpopulated
Meat or veggies?
A few questions remains for me that is still unanswered. What if we stop with meat production and go full plantbased foods how much land do we end on using for that? And what is the nutrition rate for meat and plantbased on like 100 people? Then how much land we need to get the same nutrition from meat or vice versa.  Normally I find these videos very informative and well above average. This one though very very below average, because it is very one sided (meat is bad, plant is good) and therefore very subjective.
Stop saying Brazilian Amazon is being destroyed, only who lives here know the truth.
I have a doubt at the moment 4:46, it is said that it is more efficient to ship internationally than locally, is that true? In the end the international shipment by ship has to be taken to warehouses and for that trucks are used. 🤔
Crazy to think that this whole channel is Bill Gates propaganda 🤔🤔
global food surply is mainly a logistical problem. we produce enough food atm to feed 12 billion people. With a population of 8 billion, this means 33% of our agricultural potential is completely wasted. and if I calculate correctly, getting this logistical problem under control, would yield in about as much land saved as a fully vegitarian diet for all of us. and all that with just a bit more planning and predictability.  if you could know what and how much food you will probably need, add 20% to everything and then plan global production around that, you could do a lot and with a lot less complaint from people.
I watch your videos at home and school for information about things. My teacher says its very useful for my Country Championship. Lets hope it works... 🤞
All bs, watch WILs video, debunks everything
Meat is the best thing you can eat. It's that simple. Like and subscribe.
methane vs co2 5:19
Most of this video is complete nonsense.   CO2 and methane are not a problem. The true cause of CC is ice-sheet albedo. Read paper:  ‘Modulation of Ice Ages by Dust and Albedo’.  And this dust feedback works as well in the modern era (dust from China), as it did during the ice ages.  Do note that CO2 is INCREASING agricultural production, allowing poor countries to feed their populations.  Plus tornado and hurricane numbers have been reducing for 70 years.  See data from NOAA and Dr Ryan Maue.  Ralph.
A better alternative IMO is to limit the human population and not allow it to grow anymore. Much better if we can reduce it to 50% or more.
YES EATING CORPSES OF A SENTIENT BEING THAT CAUSES PANDEMICS, AND ENVIRONMENT DESTRUCTION IS BAD
I love how cherry picked this is. Growing vegetables they did not list one negative side to it but numerous on farm animals. So I guess I will soil degradation, artificial fretziler that contains toxic metals, pesticides and the run off of these the farm's having a huge impact on water sources and the fish that live in the water the list goes on look it up yourself. They said the only good farm animals are grass feed but they make a small portion of the meet but the same thing can be said about growing vegetables  organically. Going vegan isnt going to solve anything for us think about this logically and what good does putting so many regulations and stripping away things in the name of climate change for one country just so the other country can continue to do as they please we share this planet one or two countries aren't going to go so green that makes for all the others. You want something to blame that will make you sound more intelligent than blaming cows blame manufacturing this world is full of useless crap that we really could of went without
Beyond meat: Lab grown meat: Soylent green wai-
I appreciate your devotion to this mission and your hesitation to take sides. Because it is well-organized and completely covers major component of the meat diet and vegan diet, this documentary will irritate even large meat cooperatives.
Chicken and pigs don't exclusively eat feed crops. Peasants have been feeding both these animals on household garbage/leftovers for thousands of years.
It makes me so happy that I've never liked meat since I was a child! I've been intrinsically helping the environment without needing to change my habits! :)
just eat chicken
This is a very important topic, i suggest you to add German, Spanish, French and Italian subtitles to be able to reach most people as possible, here in Italy there's not so much people that know english, to me doesn't even make sense to post it on social media 'cause as i already said there's not so much people that understand english so it will not reach so much people here. If it's not to much trouble please please add some more subs, thank you in advance :)
But you didn't talk about the nutritional value of meat or chicken, the protein is of better quality, the iron and zinc, what about vitamin B12 I'm in favor of reducing meat because people eat too much, but it's not right to give it up completely. Besides, it is more important that a lot of food is thrown away both in homes and in shops and restaurants You suggest that breeding in cages is more efficient than grass pasture, but what about disease outbreaks? Not long ago, millions of chickens were destroyed because of this. And who can think that in the name of ecology we chose the more cruel option for the animals?

This was entertaining and informative I love the graphics and the animation
Fun Fact:Potatoes Actually Saved The World
untrueee
just wait til you learn about BSE
Humans need animal products.. ?  Yes therefore: It's the cholesterol. We, humans, need at least a small amount of cholesterol in our diet. Not every day?  Mainly it is like this:  Great apes eat all kinds of animals. Chimps are hunting. Cognition had something to do with nutrients.  Compared to us, chimpanzees are the best at cognition. There is cholesterol in breast milk. In every mammalian milk..  Great apes feed their offspring with milk for a long time, orangutans up to 8 years, until the babys are adults..?  Do not feed babies plant milk, Powdered milk isn't good either, but it's about survival!    Plants lower cholesterol in different ways. Some herbal ingredients are like statins. (tocotrienols, sulphides, isoflavones, phytosterols, phytos t a n o l s) Each type of fiber lowers cholesterol levels. Fiber absorbs it. Lignin very much. Phytosterols compete with the cholesterol molecule for reabsorption in the small intestine. Phytosterols also lower cholesterol levels. Other herbal ingredients act like phytosterols and lower cholesterol levels..  Beta-Glucan, Mycosterin..  Statins harm healthy people, those who  are still eating animal food!  Low cholesterol, means lack of cholesterol, this harms in multiple ways: .. low bile acids, poor fat digestion .. low vitamin D, poor immune system, poor calcium storage, other deficiencies due to interactions .. damages in the brain and nerv tracts .. low hormones.. fertility?  .. damages in cell membranes, changes  permeability of membranes, damages in organelles membran.. increasing day by day .. low Q10 enzyme, Q10 is an intermediate product in cholesterol synthesis, low energie.  Not only is the lack of cholesterol harmful, the accumulation of precursors that are not further converted is also harmful. This connection is known from the studies on SLO.  Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome.  A cholesterol deficiency syndrome.  SLO shows that nobody can seriously say what damage exactly is caused by which cholesterol level. This is a truth we must accept.  But! people with very high cholesterol levels are well advised to adopt a vegan diet until their levels drop. But this diet also includes cutting back on saturated fats, sugars, less fruit, and less white flour to lower triglycerides, which are cholesterol transporters. When the triglycerides are high, the liver suffers from obesity. High triglycerides cause the bad LDL type B!  'Animal' cholesterol causes good LDL type A!  We know the reason for atherosclerosis nowadays.   And some people with a genetic disease do very well at 'plant based' if they are perfectly consuming all the nutrients necessary for humans. According to my source, there are 1 in 500 people with this genetic makeup. This disease is called hypercholesterolemia, familial.  Ok, about LDL type B:  LDL type B causes oxidized cholesterol. Oxidized cholesterol comes from oxidation. Oxidation kills us. This type of oxidized LDL cholesterol cannot be taken up by cell receptors, it is deposited. Plaques form. This is the state of knowledge today. 🙂  And edit: vitamin B12 we need in small amounts, nearly every meal. Next subject. 🙂👍 If we eat natural food, we can trust our body's 'speech'. Eating pills - our body is speechless!  Don't swallow too much pills a day. Don't eat denaturated meals.
Bee science,  One of the holy grails of gmo farming is carbon capture. I think you know about hoods.
Lie to me, i will believe everything. JK! I am not stupid to believe this agenda, made by these demoNcrats, satanistic, globalist rulers.
Go to 2:49 and you will see how they trolled the entitled vegans out there
beef
In my area we plow down forests to grow food for humans, cattle farms have no use to plow down forests as they are great for pasture land as is. Also the USDA say livestock farming produce only 3% of all greenhouse gas prices emissions in the unites states. So I feel that there wasn’t enough research done before this video was produced
"One of the most delicious foods, meat..."  I think you're falling into a common trap there. What makes meats delicious is the sauces, spices, marinades etc they're prepared with. You can still enjoy all of those things without meat.
In France, some of our breeding farms keep pigs in... oak tree forests! The pigs eat the acorns that we can't, no deforestation, rarely any cereal input, a happy life! Quality meat and healthy trees benefiting from pig poop.
Wow, awesome info, I think I'll stick with the meat.
your channel really did disappointed me in this video .. meat is bad for ur health plzz back up science with the stuff u say to ppl ..
🎉👏👏👏🎉
Yea iam still not eating bugs
The Vegan Teacher is gonna hate this
Everything in this video is wrong
Eat air 🤔🤔🤔
how come in the last part of the video it shows a t cell an the table?
By pure coincidence, many studies end up producing the results that their funders wished for. Personally I'd be wary of studies showing meat is bad for you, given the vast amount of money being spent on the promotion of Net Zero and the reduction of CO2 emissions. Meat on the whole is very good for you, and its consumption should not be discouraged.
If you toss an apple into the woods, it's no problem. Pile a million apples together in an anaerobic environment, big problem. I eat with this in mind. I grow my own veggies, grains, and fruit. I also eat all of my meat from wild game. Of course, if everyone did this we're back to the million apples.
I comment to help statistics
All that for only 16% if we cut every single expense when it comes to meat. Sounds like a better option, or really the only realistic option is to find ways to suck emissions out of the atmosphere.   That, or we start reducing the population
Would be great if you guys also did a video on overfishing and seafood. Exploitation of fish stocks is a much larger issue than plastic pollution, but the media never cover it. I'm a marine biology undergraduate and I feel this is a super important topic for people to know about alongside this! How cutting down on the consumption of unsustainable seafood (and what that means) compares to farmed meat would be be perfect for a Kurzgesagt video!  Edit: Also important to consider why this is such a difficult problem - due to the fishing industry being highly corporate and lucrative, while having a black market too. Not only this, but along with the health benefits of some seafood (e.g. omega 3 in oily fish), many countries (particularly poor island nations) rely on seafood as their main protein source.  Sustainability is the ultimate goal and I'd love to see how kurzgesagt suggest we reach it! :)
The world wasn't designed for humans to be eating the amount of meat we do.
I like how those cows don’t even realize that that bird is eating one of their own kind lol
Didn't millions or billions of dinosaurs living for 150 million years farts methane and breathe Co2 as well?
Should we all eat only locally produced vegetables and fruit in order to reduce the carbon footprint even more? We could grow our own avocado trees. The same goes for cocoa so we can continue enjoying chocolate.
Wow there is so much false information in this video.  How about you speak with White OaK Pastures about their regenerative farming process?  ACTUALLY do your homework.  As of this video, your integrity is gone and I'm done watching these.  You completely ignored the carbon consumed by properly maintained soil composition.  You should be promoting the compete removal of any *cides being used (pesticide, herbicide, etc...).   You were right, I was one horrible video of yours away from making a change, bye.
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old.”.  Me gonna beat my meat for the 20th time today and feel that sweet, sweet dopamine getting released into my noggin, knowing that my addiction to it won’t stop anytime soon.
The processed ones are bad
Im vegetarian and I don't like to eat meat but nice video
I want point out that slot of what cows eat is crop byproduct like corn stalk
I have a question for Kurzgesagt... You said rice emits methane, so how much of that 23-40% methane driven climate change is caused by rice? Or other sources of human-made methane?  I'm guessing the decomposition of plants could also release methane, so how much methane is produced there?  Just in case, I'm just asking this out of sheer curiosity, It kinda shocked me that you said "rice produces methane", then "cows produce methane", then "methane is bad", and then start talking about how cows produce methane without assessing which are the sources of methane...  Edit: in the end you actually say that meat is bad...
With the context from here 3:55 which leads to the following statement:  4:18  This point is nice but, the avocados would have to be transported in trucks for regional travel anyway right?  They have to get from the coast to the main cities in trucks.  What's the overall "extra" carbon footprint impact of buying avocados from South America in Europe rather than local beef for a regular consumer? What if, for example, all ships get to Spain with the avocados and then have to get to neighbor countries by road? They would do a lot more road in trucks than 1kg of local beef would do right? What's the extra carbon cost of transporting 1kg of avocados from their arrival point to, say, the UK at a main city?  Is the argument "From the total 23kg of CO2, only 3kg come from transporting avocados between Mexico and Spain so these extra 3kg are insignificant" ? If it is, it seems to not take into account the fact that avocados still need to get places when they get to Europe, and I'm guessing this is a considerable amount of CO2 being generated.  I'm a pro-vegan myself, just wondering why the "avocados still have to get from the coast to the main cities" part was ignored, this should be looked at more closely I think.
Isn't there still parts of crops we can't eat. I'm not exactly thrilled at the idea of eating the parts of corn that aren't...well corn. The leafs, stocks and other rubbish that gets created when you harvest a large amount of corn or other plant material...
I think because people can be vegan or carnivore this proves we are omnivores. Checkmate vegan teacher.
"..For Kurzgesagt sponsorships are an important part of our yearly budget, representing about 20% of our income last year.  But they also can make creators nervous:  There is always the suspicion that sponsorships compromise the creator. Do they sell out their influence? To be fair this certainly has happened but I assume it is the exception — especially in the education scene, which people do not typically enter to sell out (much easier fields to do that in).  But it is still a fair question to ask. Since we make educational/knowledge based content — can you pay us to make something look good or bad? We have a non-trivial influence over the opinion of many people after all.  So. How does Kurzgesagt do sponsorships?  Usually potential sponsors get in touch with us after seeing one of our videos they particularly liked or that is related to what they do. We start a discussion about what they are looking for and whether we can work together.  Kurzgesagt is mostly looking for a good fit that does not feel weird on the channel. Does the sponsor look for a video about a certain topic? Do they want a shoutout? Do they want to promote a product that would feel totally random? Have we been planning to do a video about their field anyway at some point in the future?  The better the sponsor aligns with us the higher the chances are they want to work with us and vice versa. Which is also one of the reasons we want to talk first and get to know the person responsible on the other side, as well as give them a chance to get to know us. After agreeing to the ground rules and a fee we are getting into the contract work.  We sign a contract that, among other things, states that Kurzgesagt has the last word on the content of the video and especially the script..." endless regrets

cows only produce 3% of total methane emissions. and recent scientific data suggests that it is even less.
What if you are vegetarian?
100% globalist bullshit mixed with politically motivated pseudoscience here
Quite a lot of forests were cut down just to make more room for cocoa trees because chocolate is so popular. Now imagine all the crop fields if everyone on this planet decided to become a vegan. But try tellng that to people like TheVeganTeacher.
Lil correction, tell me if im wrong but- buying local fod is more efficient than being shipped in a boat. Since in boat its arround 2 kg and car is 18- you would think that the boat is more efficient. But since the meat from the boat is first transported from car +18 then boat +2 the  car again to get to your meat shop, you get +18. Which totals arround 38 kg of carbon dioxide compared to the original 18 of the car.
It's just an addiction... your brain reacts good to it because it can't live without food...
Beef stonks
A great video, but useless. I'm watching it while panfrying my ribeye and I got no regrets after my first bite
Stop feeding cows grains and glyphosate filled food, then their gut lining will be better and they won't fart as much.
Hey, can I have some bill gates' money too? Hello Bill?
Klaus Schwab is evil and here you promote his World Economic Forum PROPAGANDA. Who is funding these lies? Ahh Evil Bill Gates. Yea he was so helpful with the china flu policy. Y’all are Commies. Stop making cartoons full of PROPAGANDA.
Lying bastards
Better has cheap meat than those expensive tasteless vegan products. If you want to reduce global warming how about cutting down anything that is not public, logistic,.. traffic
“This is brought to you by bill gates and the great reset. Next weeks video, why we should eat bugs”
F this globalist shit
Keep in mind this channel took half a million dollar donation from Bill Gates, who is pretty vocal about humans switching away from meat. Yes let’s consume insects and vege substitutes filled with 3 dozen ingredients and vegetable oils. After all Bill Gates is the picture perfect representation of good health.
that $570,000 from Bill Gates would have been much more useful elsewhere rather than for this video
This is what youtube is for....
Can I like sponcer an ad for this video?? I love this video so much <3 Very good word
So in short my opinion is information. Do what you want with it.
This is crap, pop science. The channel "What I've Learned" gives a solid takedown of this propaganda.
Some guy must be funding you to say these things. I wonder who. 🤔
propaganda
Methane  It's not a fart in gas and there's no global  Warming in carbon dioxide is not a blueton it's upload in if it were then carbon dioxide which is the gasoline X hail will big trains will not be transparent or invisible in color invisible in color and it would be illegal to exhale which could have which could lead to death and before that serious health consequences and and we need to do emissions otherwise we wouldn't even have sufficient  Quantities of food electricity and for transportation
Bozo
the debate is between those who believe the authorites without self research and those who dont accept authorites without self research. Me An example  Just go in UN ipcc documents , look up SSP CHARTS , the rate we polluting the earth is SSP2.5 but ipcc designed more scenarios to predict the damage and what to do to tackle them with ssp2.5 they found NO DANGER ! with SSP8.5 (WORST CASE SCENARIO, where the world pollute 7 times more!!!) We will have 2-3 degree temprature raise and its for the next 200 yrs !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Which is absolutely ridiculous ! Due to tech progresses it might be even impossible to happen !!! We are literally getting taxed and suppressed for SOMETHING THAT IS NOT HAPPENED YET AND MIGHT NEVER HAPPEN EVEN IF WE CARE 0 ABOUT POLLUTION !!! i was active, but not anymore thnx to a couple of hours of research Please watch this video "A NEW SOCIAL CREDIT SCORE!? YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT'S COMING!!" from the channel "COIN BUREAU"  watch how BIRITISH PETROLEUM is trying to maximize profit thru these propagandas
Imagine believing this propaganda lmfao
dislike
World Economic Forum and globalist propaganda
Propagandaaaaaaahhh
Grass/Cows are actually a small % of these issues grass/cows are renewed -  INDUSTRY is the problem. No more propaganda.   Can't believe how mislead humans get - Industry is the single biggest contributor and propaganda/power control is sourced from industry
9:45 why are they eating helper T cells
L propaganda
Oh you fucked up. There’s so much misinformation and blatant negligence of science in this video - like in no other Kurzgesagt video. Way to make it obvious what your political agenda is. When you’re no longer capable of presenting facts reliably that’s when you know that you got hit by ideology and brain rot. Unsubbed and gonna order steak.
Don't buy into bullshit! Meat heals! 🥩♥️
Meat is good for you and climate change is a myth.
This doesn't include the larger vegetable farming that is required to get the same nutrients you find in beef.  Also the water consumption of tofu, almonds and cashews is much higher than beef.  What about the larger Buffalo herds that existed before.  Buffalo produce much more methane than beef and the beef herds haven't grown in significant size in the last 70 years.
Bullshit propaganda at its finest. How much did you get paid to do this video? Cow..ard.
It’s been known for a while that meat is more damaging for the environment, and don’t forget the ethical standpoint most meat eaters Ignore due to their societal pressures
Sweet potatoes are quite efficient as they contain high nutrient amounts,and the boiled potato is the most satisfactory of all foods.
Propaganda. Eat your bugs, shutup, and live in a pod.
There is a missing thing about grasslands. Currently without livestock. We removed big herd herbivore mammals from grasslands, which were probably the key species for these biomes through hunting and domestication. There is evidence by Allan Savory that indices that trampling by large herds of herbivores was a key element in the growing process. So probably now we need to feed cows on grasslands in order to prevent desertification
Wrong
If you don't wanna eat tha bugz come to Argentina, we have extremely good meat at ridiculously cheap prices.
A shame that such a usually good channel that does its impartial research, in this video, is clearly biased, the editors clearly like meat, because the scientific data is more than abundantly and proved that the meat industry is one of the worst emissions makers causing climate change, no room to argue here unless of course, you are biased and clearly like eating meat.
As a New Zealander there isn’t really an option about buying local meat- you have to anyway
Great video but why the strange cartoon screen shot? 🤢
I'm satisfied with chicken
99 names
I still don't understand one thing. Why is meat emitting co2 when it's all organic? Whatever co2 meat production emits, it should be re-absorbed by the crops those animal eats in a circle. So it should be a 0 emissioni business. By intuition I would say that the actual issues are the non circular practices, like the destruction of co2 rich forests for building farmland  and the massive usage of artificial fertilizers in the crop industry (that are produced out of fossils). Not the meat per se. Shouldn't these be the real target of our sensibilization efforts? Granted without those we will produce way less meat (because we will produce dramatically less vegetables overall too), but I fail to see how an agriculture without animals (and the natural fertilizers they provide) can really be circular and sustainable. Can someone explain?
I think we should eat less meat and treat it kinda like a treat. We don’t have to go fully vegetarian or vegan but we can make an effort to try reduce our consumption
I prefer to go vegan. It makes me a better person.
No matter what I’ll keep eating meat
80% of you have got to go.  - Bill Burr
0:04 I can think of one more…
Suprising how cow farts play a role in global warming.
The truth is no method is going to be both sustainable & ethical with the current level of demand. The amount of meat/animal-product consumption today is drastically higher than just decades ago. We're living in a culture of excess. One thing the video didn't clarify is that a beef-free diet will save 2 bil hectares, but it didn't take into account alternative cattle taking on the burden. If we all ditch beef but still insist on eating meat daily there won't be enough improvement. Meat has to return into being a luxury or a treat, because it genuinely is! I don't think there is a food more precious than the kind where a life a sacrificed. In hindsight it's lowkey disrespectful to get a burger for just a few dollars.    eating meat by itself is may be natural, but what's not natural is the level of meat we eat today compared to our ancestors
Ahora es fit
i too love meat
9:41 who slices fish like that
Amazing video! Please do a video of the effects the fish industry has on the environment 🫶🏽
What about all the land for abandoned parking lots and strip malls for forests. It's just too expensive to remove concrete and asphalt I guess
Yall need to get that if unless youre a very trained person in meat, you cant tell the difference between plant-based meat imitators and actual meat, Ive had it like 4 or 5 times, really enjoyed it, went to ask where they got the beef and whoop, turns out its a veggie patty.
if vegan food was cheaper, more people would buy it. cost is the biggest driver in whether people do alternative or greener options. the ironic thing is, the more people do green options, the more would have to be produced and the cheaper it would be overall
This all assumes that CO2 emissions are bad which a growing number of people don't agree with.  So I will keep eating meat and dairy products no matter what the science priests / experts are telling me.
You will eat the bugs. You will watch the cartoon propaganda videos. You will live in the pod. You will own nothing. And you will be happy.
That was as biased as you can get
oh my god  cow farts cause global warming
I can wrap my head around Global Warming and other horrible crises, but for some reason, the solution for meat doesn’t seem at all apparent. My best idea would be to try and eat less meat until lab meat becomes viable and preferably tasty, then that’ll probably help. It’s very odd, still, to say the least.
"It's complicated". From this video it seems really simple to me, we need to dramatically reduce meat consumption.
I cant wait for the day we can grow steak directly, instead of growing a cow and cutting the stake out of it.
oh no buffalo emit methane KILL THE BUFFALO
You dind't talk about the different types of water used
Not meat, but over production and consumption are the bad one
No. Next dumb queston!
I will eat 10x times the meat so your stupid "carbon footprint" doesn't matter, i won't eat bugs, i won't live in a pod
Uncivilised people eat meat
You earned my like.  Glad you were able to stay descriptive instead of being political/prescriptive and preachy/dire/doomsaying.  Good on ya'll.
Me, after eating yet another 1.5 lbs of ground beef:  Interesting.
If only we could create artificial tree towers that could counterbalance the CO2 emissions.
steak mmmmm
My solution is ... keep the meat, but get rid of the Internet ... and Flying .... surely a more favourable Carbon Footprint 🤣🤣
اشهد ان لا اله الا الله و اشهد ان محمد رسول الله
I made a serious change in my eating of meat; in that I only eat meat that I kill myself from the measured management of wildlife via DWR in Virginia.
my lord why do you guys lie? 8:30 do you know that cows can and do eat a lot of non edible food byproducts? This is where we see theres a difference in reality ; between those comfortably between their research desks only looking at current data, and people going onto fields, farms, and talking to the actual people producing.
One of your worst videos for sure.. The entire premise revolves around cows magically creating methane out of thin air, which is simply not true. Plants absorb CO2 from atmosphere and turn it into cellulose, cow eat plant, cow transforms cellulose in methane, cow fart, methane enters atmosphere and is then transformed into CO2, CO2 is absorbed by plant, cycle is complete. There is literally zero CO2 or methane created in this process; only recycled carbon. If we instead do as you suggest, and take 70-80% of the corn- and soy-plant and throw it on landfills (instead of feeding it to cows), the cellulose will still break down, in large part into methane. And no, we humans CANNOT eat cellulose properly, we cannot eat soy-cake, we cannot eat the leaves or stems of a corn plant, not even die-hard vegans with purple hair can eat it. So instead we use this trash, the leftovers, the by-products, and we give them to cows (IE Recycling) and turn it into human food.
8:54 the soy that is being used to feed animals is completely inedible for human consumption and is a byproduct of other crops
How does 1kg of beef emit 71 kg of CO2? 😲
Short answer: big yes (it's not complicated at all and you demonstrated this without even going below the surface).  Land we can't go crops on needs turning into forests - not wasted or used for agriculture.  And this short video did not even factor in how bad meat is FOR you: red meat is especially carcinogenic for example.  Even if the environmental and health issues were solved I'd still not touch meat because I don't want to incentivise animal suffering.
so, it's just no but actually yes
Check the What i've learned video about meat. Your video seems a little bit manipulative with the statistics.
That vegan teacher is going to harass you now😂
Eating less meat (or no meat at all) helps the world more than we imagine.
8:49 That is not how you say tofu
Yeah all this makes me want to go is eat a very big steak!
What about water consuption on beef production? Doesn't that also contribuite to climate change?
Who comes up with the carbon budget numbers?
If you ever feel useless, just remember you can hate this video.
Kerzgesagt is why I went vegan 👍
Are you aware that just because plains have grass in it, it does not make the land arable?   livestock animals, especially cows and lamb, eat mostly food waste, like corn stalks and nut shells. Not even all arable land can grow the same or similar crops.   Like do you think farmers only constraint is how much money they stand to make? Do you not think that multiple factors involving soil type, chemistry, climate, irrigation and other factors are more of a demanding factor than simply choosing a crop or livestock that has the highest profit ratio? Most farmers are not Bill Gates and Monsanto.   You would think that farming, the source of literally all our food on the planet that keeps every human alive, would have a little more thought put into it than a 12 minute video. It's extremely disingenuous and reaches far into the edutainment zone.
Lamb is a big problem since not just emit carbon dioxide but is a religious food so it is no choice if you can have it or not  Note this is only for Jews not other religions
Let's be very clear, there are many people who would starve without eating meat.  And in countries where food is plenty? They're all fat because they eat too much sugar, and carbs in general, and not enough good fat and protein.
Now vote, buying different isn't going to do much
The footprint of cows has been exagerated and the research done by biased scientists.
Why don't we eat bugs?
There are some errors in this video. Its a very surface level analysis .
I love this video, it doesn't talk down on anyone or judge. Pure information. I have a fairly good idea of the food chain and have no qualms eating dead animals. I am shocked by the stark difference between beef and chicken though. I have been thinking recently, I don't really enjoy beef that much. The flavour is just not that enticing. I've been wondering how to cook it better to have more flavour, but I think I may just cut it altogether.  I just wish it wasn't such a prominent part of burgers. I'm not keen on 100% veggie burgers, but I have wanted a mix for a long time. Why can't they make burgers that are 25% good meat and 75% good veggies?
Humans cannot survive on a vegan diet. Most of the grains used for animals are the portions of the plant that humans can't eat.  The data about beef being higher carbon than an avocado is absolute nonsense.
although entirely grass fed beef only makes up 13 percent of beef production most food given to cows are made from agriculture byproducts that cant be eaten by humans such as corn cobs cashew husks and straw.
This is an extremely manipulative and misleading video. None of these stats are relevant or fully telling the truth
8:25 but that isn't the only way?  we can use leftover parts that we can't eat from crops we grow for humans, or we can just use leftover food about to go bad. You made it seem like we HAD to grow them food
From what I've read... you're pretty much wrong in this video as Food Waste from Plants such as Fruits and Veg produce 10x the Emissions than Cattle does, and the water thing, 97% of it comes from RAIN WATER.  Love you guys but this video is very misleading
Damn they actually made an uncorrect video... still love em... just they jumped on the veganism scare statistics wagon....
In my opinion, it misses nuance because not all protein is equal, breakdown of protein we can't use makes US produce methane, nuts aren't healthy for us and therefore isn't a viable source for protein or anything really and cows deserve to live as well. They're awesome animals and live lives that aren't really that bad if they're taken care of in a proper way, they probably live better lives than us humans in some aspects.
Very cool thank you for the misinformation
No it’s not that bad cows are more helpful to humans than they are bad and most of the green house gas they “produce” from burps was originally there so there not really making any green house gases. They also aren’t drinking and wasting water because most of that is rain water and then the water goes through there system then it gets evaporated then it gets turned into rain and the it happens again. They also aren’t eating are food most of that is non edible and if the cows didn’t eat that it would be turned into a bunch of green house gases the little edible food they eat is mostly wasted food, and on top of that more fruit and vegetables get wasted than meat and fruits and vegetables also produce more green house gases. Also 2 thirds of the land they “use up” for fruits and vegetables would not be used because you can’t grow anything but grass there so live stock doesn’t really take up land.
One thing that bothers me is that Vegan arguments tend to focus in on a few specific areas of contention and exaggerates the actual impact of those areas. All the pro meat sides I've seen, tend to take a much more widespread and practical stance on the topic. The actual biggest food waste is spoiled food. Not Beef. In fact 80 percent of spoiled food are plant based. That aside beef does make up a good chunk of emissions. 80% of those emissions come from developing countries. Punishing developing countries is bad. Stuff like that can feel as if the Promeat side are just deflecting, but that doesn't mean they are flat out wrong or misguided. Most informed meatmans actually think we should make changes. They just also look at the data and reason that going all Vegan would make things worse. That's probably super frustrating for the hopelessly optimistic guys at Kurzesagt.  All that said, there is an undisputable Vegan argument. The personal level Moral one. If you feel bad eating animals, don't eat animals.
So, water had to be debunked by some YouTuber who put the one researcher researching about all of this. Now with CO2 emissions, do we need another random half assed youtuber to say it's also disingenuous and unfair? You even said "Best Beef" and that comparison, as you have also shown, completely blows plant based meals out of the water per 100kcal or 100g of protein, or vitamins in general, or anything really.  Also, reminder almond milk is sold as an alternative to diary milk and it's way more environmental impactful.  EDIT: Methane was also debunked. The "they eat our grown food" meme is also debunked, as they eat the leftovers. What the hell is this video?
insane too see how much we stuffed up the world lol
1. All agriculture is 100% carbon neutral. In fact, all forms of carbon that come from living things is carbon neutral carbon. This is because all carbon involved in the lifecycles of Earth is RECYCLED. There's no way to exceed the carbon budget with agriculture because the carbon put into the air by agriculture is eventually reabsorbed by said agriculture. Atmospheric methane has a half-life if 9.1 years, meaning half the methane from cows from 9 years ago is gone already. It's sitting at steady levels. It is not increasing. Also, the wild bison of North America produced nearly 90% the methane of cows today. They did so for MILLIONS of years.  3. Not only do cows eat the grass that we cannot eat, they eat the grains unfit for human consumption (bugs, etc...), and the bits of food we do not eat. The corn stalks. The stalks of soybeans, etc... Also, crop rotation may produce an excess of certain crops. Soybeans are good for repairing soil, so they are often grown as a trash crop for next year's corn. Sure, SOME land that could be used for human food is used for cattle, but it's not nearly as much as you think it is.  Overall, terrible propaganda video. Meat haters are so biased it is insane. Take your religious fanaticism elsewhere.
Just looking at figures won't give a complete picture. How these figures are calculated and how they impact climate change needs to be taken into consideration. Like ruminant animals mostly eat farming by-products otherwise going to waste. Drinks mostly green water(rain). Creating methane whose carbon is from grass and part of the cycle in nature unlike fossil fuel emissions. So mere numbers won't give the full picture.
Rice doesn't produce methane. When grown in anaerobic conditions,  aka paddies which they are typically seen being grown, the bacteria living in that environment is producing the methane. Which is inevitably taken up by the rice plants and then at that point the rice "emits methane". However, just because rice can be grown in paddies doesn't mean it has to be. Therefore rice not grown in standing water would not produce methane. That is a huge statement of misinformation regarding rice that was said in the beginning.  Rice is grown in paddies because it helps with weed prevention since rice CAN be grown in paddies preventing other plants from being able to grow, especially during seedling stage. So it's the bacteria in the traditional rice growing process producing methane, not the rice itself. Reference is I work with rice and the microbiome associated with it.
ya but meet is yummy
this video makes me want to try more lamb lol
Turns out when you go to the research, if 30 millions people went vegan, the impact wouldn't even be measurable in terms of the environment.
My family farm cattle and meat poultry. I'd love to be environmental but the government isn't fair as they make you do intensive farming and even tho we r gonna plant acres of trees we won't get a penny. Intensive farming is the killer. Stop wasting food. I don't like having to see chickens cramped in a tiny shed. I even asked dad about it and he said the government would put him in deep trouble if he tried free range as they won't allow that. Then there is the fact the government Is scarce for grazing ground as everywhere has houses on it where kids could get trampled but livestock in fields thanks to lazy parents or them not liking the fact we work hard asf. Northern ireland is more intensive at farming than anywhere in Europe like the amount of fertiliser we use is bananas as we r sooo small.... but nope we gotta feed fat, lazy people .
I know Some people don't know This but sometimes You have to do crop rotations between growing crops and Pasture land because after a Couple Years you have to since the land is lacking some nutrients and using in for hay allows it to grow back.
The argument is very convincing, But us humans cannot live off Plants, We need the Protein to be fully healthy, You could of added this and advocate for simply a more balanced diet
I liked the video, but I strongly believe the title should be "Is meat really that bad for climate change", since it barely addresses other environmental factors like permaculture as one commenter mentioned and it doesnt address the ethical discussion at all. That's fine since it would be too much for one video, but I think it should be indicated, otherwise it seems like CO2 is the only factor thats criticised.
Idc im still eating meat
I think one issue with going vegan that isn't talked about often is - we don't actually have a perfect break down of what a human body needs.  Science isn't quite there yet.  Plus the human diet is attributed with our intelligence so if our stomachs have to become more complex on an evolutionary scale we may be causing our intelligence to move back down.    I have noticed that the vast majority of vegans don't look healthy.  Their muscles hang from their bones differently, their skin complexion is a little different in tone, and when speaking to them they seem to have a harder time with sustaining longer logical threads (this could just be due to emotions about their favorite topics).     I have no doubt that some day humans will stop eating meat; science will figure out the perfect nutrition for longevity, costs to create food will favor a shift from current production techniques, people will continue to find it distasteful to kill other creatures to survive (there is a trend in this direction and a disconnect between food and it's production), and/or scarcity will make changing our food a necessity.  Personally if I could eat a ration pellet that extended my life and never had to worry about food again I would.  I like eating as much as anyone and make some very delicious foods, but it takes a lot of time that I could put to other enjoyable things in life.  Right now we favor food gatherings but that is mostly because we are highly controlled right now.  We are constantly told the best thing to do is go out to eat, have a bbq, gather family to eat.  As long as this is the way we are nothing will change, but it will change, everything changes eventually.  I'm just not so sure that we will survive with our emotionally charged unwillingness to change.  I hear crows are having their own version of the stone age, maybe they will evolve next and do better.
Yes. Saved you 12 mins - your welcome.
You apes are grossly underestimating the planet you live on. Nature has an uncanny ability to adapt to change. Stop treating the planet as a child that can't do anything by itself or have you forgotten what made it possible for you to exist?
The transport emissions comparison is not correct: the shipped plant based food will also have to be transported from the harbour to the local areas/stores: doesn’t that have to be added? Otherwise great video 👍
What do you think about the video made by "what I learned"
Für Vegetarier die nicht kochen wh. das Werl des Bösen ! Für kranke Comic - Gehirne wh eine weitere Überättigung an Pokermon "aber hne konkrete Tipps zum Abnehmen und ohne  inhalt" Nur negative gesellshaftliche Verkrüpfungen , durch Sensationsmedien erzeugt in noch nie dagewesener Verdummungsform !
Thumbnail is mega cringe
Even if it was comparibly not so harming for the environment in the sense of climate change and endangered ecosystems - this video totally cut out, that eating meat means needlesly killing a sentious being. It means taking the life of someone who doesn't whish to die.
Bro went from meat is the worst food in the world to meat is not that bad
1:18 we could fix these problems. For rice I suppose GMOs could work and for the fertilizer we could find a better item for it. but maybe its more complicated
2:41 I'm telling ya I can survive on potatoes if needed
Grow your own veg lower suffering and no co2
what about the factories that produce vegan meat?
i'm always curious about how it works with hunted meet
1 Child policy a forever answer.
I eat a lot of beef
Your video is researched but I  think is also quite incomple. If we only consider the factor of their emissions you also must count how it would affect the food chain as their niche would be different.  If we stop eating beef, lamb, pork and chicken: -what would happen with those animals? Would they become wild or would we still use them to obtain milk, eggs, etc...? -Would they be freed somewhere or would they remain in farms but free? -How would it affect an animal to be left free after being depending on humans for feeding and protection for such a long time? Would they actually survive on their own? Let's not forget that actually, the fact of living with humans, protects them from predators like wolfs, lynx, bears, lions, panthers, tigers, cheetah... just to name a few... -wouldn't stop eating beef, lamb, pork and chicken increase the population of those animals, increasing their eating of plants, seeds or whatever they feed with?  - Would an increase of the cow population increase their methane emissions as well? -Wouldn't an increase in cows, lambs, pigs and chickens make them a target for other predators? (which would actually be bad for humans, because the population of those predators would increase as well?) Those are just a few questions, I have much more. As you said, it is a complex subject but all humanity becoming vegan would bring a whole set of issues that vegans don't seem to care about.
If only steak wasn't so damn tasty am i right
Nah. We don't produce what we don't consume, well, mostly. Modern economics with modern communication systems assure this relatively efficiently. If we don't use animals in food production, we should replace them with something else. So start growing less-wield crops suitable for human and do that more, excluding some areas which already used and all that facing food crisis and continuous starving. Starving is still an issue. Yes, its immediate danger for the poorest of us, but we still don't have enough calories for everybody. Modern economics just tweak how those calories spread so for some people starving is an major issue and for other its being overweight.  Guided by such agenda we will face even more severe deforestation while making food crisis worse.
climate change bla bla bla, once a big enough volcano erupts, the global temparatures will drop significantly....after all, humans cant beat nature in its destructivness.
a kg of potatos ..... how the hell do you explain the giant freaks roaming eastern Europe on a 50% potato diet ... im 175 and im short ... for reference, not to mention their hands are actual shovels, and the size and strength of a freaking bear
MMMmmmmmmm000000000000
Who is else is eating food while watching?
No, it's not as bad as the crazies want you to believe.
What about killing a living being that didn’t have to die at all
I recommend what I’ve learned eating meat won’t save the planet for a different perspective
Honestly I’m not a vegetarian or vegan and I don’t want to be but I would definitely go vegetarian at least to save the environment
What vegans won't understand is that this video is not about freeing the animals, but about killing them all instead
Yeah
For those interested in this topic. In reality it is wwaaaaaay more complicated than in this video. When I first read all these facts, I became vegan.

Wow some serious propaganda going on here I guarantee all the globalists behind all this nonsense will be eating plenty of meat while they gotta's trying to eat insect
How about donuts
Question, the long transport in ships may be efficient, but corps aren't grown and consumed in a harbour. Doesn't trasport to and from the harbours and distribution centres and then more local transport to supermarkets add up to more CO2 than just locally produced foods?
People trying to ban impossible burger is the most hilarious thing ever.
Renewable energy or not is utterly irrelevant. It's nothing but a misleading marketing term like all natural or chemical free.
"How to lie with statistics"
Why is the channel name German and the video(s) English?
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old."  Lol... Well... There is other things.
How much extra farm land would you need to grow all of the food?
So animals will stop farting when we stop raising animals for meat? Cows, pigs, deer ect will still exist.
We have proof that climate change is naturally occurring. Analyzing ice rods from Polar caps tells us so. Temperatures go up and down with or without us. From ice age to scorched Earth. We also know that kids today will be the biggest polluters ever. Batteries everywhere.
If animals didn't want to be eaten. Why do they made out of food?
@7:00 THANK YOU!  As a West Aussie, I have had this argument so many time with people telling me that as an environmentalist I should be a vegan.  Our state has thousands of square kilometres that can support cattle but not crops.
I can't wait to be Vegan
Carnivore diet is the way to go
Meat should be avoided completely just for one reason. Animals have as much right to life as humans. Period. The rest of the arguments are spurious and looking only from the point of humans. Civilised evolved beings mean compassion to all living creatures. Meat eating degrades humans to that of barbaric savages.  Btw, nobody dies of eating too many veggies. Meat on the other hand is carcinogen.
Dont worry about it. A lot of vegans have kids, and as soon as you have more than one child, you show you REALLY dont care about animals.
how can u put hearts in a cows eyes to represent meat. animals go through horrifying thing for you to eat them not one animal want to be eating. and also yes meat is that bad for health
burgers still taste good, so im gonna stick with meat
Meat isn’t bad and the one that inspired me is your mom’s meat😏
*sad carnivores noise
What if the vegans just feed themselves directly to the cattle?
I'd like to speak to the planetary sustainability expert who lead this investigation.
Have you considered that beef is the most healthy food on the planet, and people have survived by only consuming beef salt and water.
bad video try eating feed quality grain se how you feel after. we feed cows literal garbage bro, nobody would eat that shit.
8:39 A very important point to make here is that ingredients that go into feed cannot be digested by humans. Basically all the fibery stuff that is too tough for us is put into feed.
I have been vegan and vegetarian a few times before and became anemic one of the times because I wasn't taking iron & B12. I rarely ever eat beef now. Many days I'll eat some beans for protein partly because of food prices. If I cook at home I eat chicken mostly and have stopped getting sushi except when I visit a friend and go for a meal. You don't have to quit eating meat completely to help the environment you can cut down and eat less especially sea food and beef. What they are doing to the oceans is horrific dragging them and killing all types of sharks etc.
Sigh our family carbon emission on food is larger cause my dad don't like pork
I was a long term subscriber, but with this bullshit easy vegan propaganda Im out.
I love beef. Even though the news sucks I'm glad you're guys doing a nonbias analysis. That's science at it's purest.
Disingenuously framing this as something someone could have a non-negligible effect on as an individual citizen. You know this kurzgesagt if someone stops eating the meat then it will either rot or go to someone who will eat it. Youre implying that its possible that people as a mass will swap over to veganism and thats just not going to happen. Legislation needs to gut businesses killing the environment simple and shut
9:45 Yes I love eating helper t cells
I don’t think I’ll ever stop eating meet (especially beef) in its entirety but I’d hope everyone would be willing to at the very least reduce the amount of beef they consume in order to make it more sustainable than it currently is.
Basically: "Is Meat Really that Bad?" "Yes, yes they are."
But methane release in a green grass crop is close to 0, total carbon sequestration in grass areas is 18 tons vs 23 tons by forests... at the end of the day, stop eating meat doesn't changes much (exception the diary and the need to produce algie, agar agar...). Shifts from beef to aquaculture are likely to be more sustainable and energy efficient and u still gain the essential amino acids with great absorption (aparently people forgets abouth what is realy important to nutricion when politics enter in debate)
Awesome to see such a big channel spread this message, though I wish it had a little more on the morality of eating animals.
Queue the woke, marxist and postmodernist comments. And yes, I eat a lot of meat. Not just because I like it, but I love pissing environmentalists & vegans off.
Humans have evolved to eat meat. People who think it's bad for health are daft. If they think it affects the climate they are even more daft. Balance exists in everything. It has nothing to do with the act itself.
The music, 9 minutes in... I noticed. Gerudo Valley theme. I love it.
But I like da burger :(
I too love putting meat in my mouth👍
Other thing to remember is... is that lithium for batterys in electric cars is even harmfull for the climate. Whole Chili has been layed dry for farming lithium. Now they are targeting the ocean cor lithium production. It is even worse then eating meat.
The problem is that not all environments are habitable for agriculture. That’s something I’m surprised you didn’t touch on. Simply if everyone on earth swapped to vegan diets, there wouldn’t be enough to go around. Either that or we would cause even more deforestation. Thus the problem remains the same. What we need to focus on is more efficient food farming, and that can come from people getting over their fears and accepting insects and rodents as a valuable source of food. Especially locust. Densely nutrient, and easily farmable. If we could just get people to get over these bias then the world would indeed become a better place.
no, it's delicious
no
Eat a lot of meat and vegetables at every meal, ditch the sugar and fastfood. You'll feel better
What about chicken?
I'm hearing a lot of "eat less meat" but not enough "100 big global companies emit 71% of all greenhouse gases"
I'm curious on what is considered "CO2 equivalents"? Does that included methane? I've heard that methane has a life cycle of only 12 years and it's not like methane was never produced before the industrial era, it's a natural byproduct of organic life. Most of the CO2 emissions on the other hand has been trapped in the ground for millions of years before we came along and started pumping it into the atmosphere.
The problem with meat production is the same as the problem with fossil fuel pollution. Most of it is done in developing countries with terribly inefficient processes.
i fkin love meat
I'm a meat eater. I love steaks, burgers, hot dogs and bacon. If we're gonna go out we might as well go out with a feast. They've been saying this for years though, and there are industrialized nations doing more harm than all the cows in the world.
How about seafood and insects?
There are 15k dislikes. download an extension. Ive noticed because you cannot see likes/ dislikes  especially   dislikes are way lower. Videos with 30k views will have two
Insect sourced nutrition is in our near future, especially once we start designing bugs specifically for human/ livestock consumption.
Fascinating stuff my next burger shall be devoured in remorse. Just a little remorse I am human after all.
Has anyone suggested capturing cow farts and compressing it into a liquid? Why are we letting it out into the atmosphere when we could be using it as a liquid propellant? Probably.
Best idea. We eat all of the vegans. Less people AND we stay fed.
we just need to thanos snap the world to cut the amount of food required.
But this still twists a global problem ultimately driven by rabid capitalist businesses into the idea that it's the responsibility of individual consumers to learn a vast amount of complex science, all about infrastructure and logistics of these businesses and to buy special products that are often way more expensive (thanks to these same businesses and systems of society). All of this is in fact the responsibility of governments and the businesses they're in bed with to change how they operate, and to demonstrate and set an example to society. Nothing will change if the consumers are lead to feel they're the ones to blame and it's their responsibility to keep figuring out what to buy, where to buy it, how to make more money to be able to afford it all...   It's completely backwards thinking that is encouraged by big business, because it gets them off scott free from their actual responsibility to stop destroying our environment and our societies with their mindless greed. It's exactly the same with pollution in general, it's not our responsibility to watch our personal carbon footprints and all that, it's the responsibility of all the big businesses that are making the damage through continuing to suppress new fuels, new technologies to replace their enormous fossil fuel profits, and continuing to sell petrol powered cars, pumping these gases out on industrial scales (especially places like Russia and China which will never listen to any of this in the slightest) churning out plastic packaging in vast vast quantities and so on and so on.  We need to radically force fundamental changes in our society, in our governments and in the big businesses that they're in bed with profiting enormously from destruction of our living environment and society in general. If your house is flooding because of burst pipes, you don't just start telling everyone in the family it's their own personal responsibility to grab a bucket and start bailing water out the windows more and more...that would be a pointless task, only slightly delaying the inevitable. You HAVE to go to the source of the problem and patch up the leaks quickly while you then start working on replacing them fully.
according to you with meat were all dead within a hundred years... so with everything else what...? 1-2 years...? quit making up shit kid
This makes me even more glad I'm vegetarian
Let's set the climate aside and look at food production. Let's say food demand gets above supply, too get a pound of meat you use many pounds of grain. At scale we can't all eat meat like an American, there's not enough land of earth.
No, no, no. I will forever keep eating real beef at the same portions, even if it means the end of humanity.
why does meat love sound wrong
Oh no
If we all turn vegan tomorrow and the human population continues to grow as it does now and, say it doubles in the next 100 years, aren't we gona face the same problem again? And what next, should we stop eating all together? i guess it will help for sure)
Even the desert can be converted to crop planting land just saying....
Many (EXTREMEST) vegans don't put into account that being vegan isn't something everyone can afford
I wonder how DIAAS would influence footprints 🤔.
well being vegan is just not eating meat but the cows are already getting kill so whats the point not eat meat isnt gonna do anything .
Humans are herbivores. Yes ALL processed meat is very bad for your health. and meat production is KILLING the planet emissions wise. be vegan. its 100% human
Meat is good, it gives you the most "bang for buck" in terms of nutrients, you will (probably) enjoy the taste too. People who don't like eating meat because of animal cruelty are idiots. People who don't eat meat because of climate change and pollution are not. Look at yourself right now, what do you really want? To sacrifice to decrease climate change or to live life at it's fullest while it lasts? Me personally would rather enjoy meat. I do account for these added emissions by saving electricity, water, reduce reuse recycle all that shit so that my kids will live a life like I did. I want them to enjoy life while not suffering from the mistakes in our generation and prior. Life is only survival if you do not have enjoyment, you must indulge yourself once in a while.
Its ironic that we are talking about caws and ignoring cats and dogs environmental impact which is much much dangerous and damiging to the planet, maybe its becouse we just love our pets so much that we dont really give a dam
That's why we don't consume beef and also minimized consumption of other forms of meat. Proud to be Indian 🇮🇳
You admit a grtass-fed diet for cattle uses immensely more land but leave out that a vegetarian or vegan diet for humans would require much the same in order to meet nutritional requirements. Any chance you can do a video on this too?
Hmmm yummy beef burger oh God
Adding a 1 before the year 2022 to make it 12022 is equivalent to adding solar system, Earth to your address in Ontario, Canada  It's technically more informative, but almost always useless.
its very easy to manipulate statistics
Eating meat is perfectly fine, as long as it is human meat and not animal meat.
beef stonks :)
This video is one of the more balanced videos about the impacts of eating meat(beef). You deserve the 6M views it's got. I would like to point out that a lot of it is isolated facts. For example a lot of the worst offenders that skew the average comes from slash and burn methods in places like South America. This can be overcome by eating home grown beef(except for those living in the areas of the worst offenders of course). Also some of the figures are hiding some not mentioned underlying facts. For example cows are part of the natural cycles. If you don't eat beef it doesn't mean the emissions are 0, because you still need to eat something. Similarly the cows turn grass into fertilizer(cow pat). If we remove all of the cows will we not have sheep, horses or something else that is part of the natural cycles taking it's place to turn that grass into fertilizer? how much of the methane output from normal activities will be reduced if we remove the cows? composting requires energy and that in turn releases greenhouse gases. But it's all in a much larger natural cycle that I believe should be excluded from man made greenhouse gases. What I'm saying is that the figures look bad for cows mostly due to it's position in the natural cycles, but replacement in those positions will have equally bad looking figures.
CO2 equivalent is one of the most misleading things in the world of emissions.
Personally I believe switching to 100% grass fed would be better since the amount of meat we waste is more than we actually consume
0:54 SHEESH is nobody going to mention how clean these title cards look?
Forgot to take into account the unedible byproducts of pretty much all crops. Which cattle eat. Most of which has no other use other than cattle feed.  Forgot to take into account food waste which, for plant-based foods, is (just as meat is in terms of emissions) far worse than meat.
What you don't explain is that a lot of animal feed comes from the waste generated from human food production which otherwise would be thrown away. You're only using the calorific content of meat, what about all the by-products too. They should also be within your calculations. I know I'd rather eat organic, free range meat than something made in a lab.
2:26 Now I have a reason to have beef with beef.
WEF propaganda. And ppl believe this BS.
No
Reasons why you should not eat animal products: - It's environmentally unfriendly - It's expensive - It's cruel - There is a higher chance you will get food poisoned - Lead to health issues relate to saturated fat. - It's harder to sh*t  Reason to eat animal products:  - It tastes good  (Edit: I know that some of you will come and add reasons to eat meat, something like animal products offer more energy and protein. Well, too bad for you my friends. You have not eaten enough vegetable to know more about it.)
Even though I’m very VERY young to know this stuff,it’s to interesting to know
A vegan diet is not sustainable fir a human being. I know from experience since i have low iron and even only eating chicken my iron levels have crashed only after increasing my beef consumption have i increased my iron levels without needing supplements.
Every Kurzgesagt video I watch I almost always go "So we are fucked huh"
Ik this would be terrible but one of the only ways lower human population is by making it so only 25% of people can have kids
All the other man-apes in the group had stopped to watch, and now they crowded round Moon-Watcher and his victim with admiring wonder. Presently one of them picked up the blood-stained weapon, and began to pound the dead pig. Others joined in with any sticks and stones that they could gather, until their target began a messy disintegration. Then they became bored; some wandered off, while others stood hesitantly around the unrecognizable corpse - the future of a world waiting upon their decision. It was a surprisingly long time before one of the nursing females began to lick the gory stone she was holding in her paws. And it was longer still before Moon-Watcher, despite all that he had been shown, really understood that he need never be hungry again
We couldnt use that land because of all the animals that are currently alive and we are unable to kill anymore
The problem is that there's massive negatives to both sides of the aisle. Vegans, and Carnivores. What gets glossed over by many vegans is monocropping and how horrible it is for the planet. I'll take a farm full of cows over a soy farm any day of the week when it comes to the impact on our future. The reason is soil depletion. Monocropping does this at an extreme rate and is leading to a rapid, potentially catastrophic loss of usable farmland. Compared to cattle, which, while bad, does not compare. While yes, most of the soy is used for cattle, if you nixed cattle all together, you would still run into the problem of those remaining monocrops destroying the soil and when they have to move to the lands that were spared due to not being used by cattle, you still run into the same issue you started with. Only difference is that there will be less methane but instead of greenhouse gas issues you now have a starving population. Let's not get started on the animal rights activists claiming that vegan diets involve less death. Those people have clearly never stepped foot on one of these farms to see the ridiculous death toll of smaller creatures killed during the crop harvesting process. Again, this isn't a pro meat/anti vegan argument. Simply to say that unless we figure out a way to speed up the process of soil turnover, monocropping will almost certainly do far more damage to our ability to live on this planet then factory farming will. The goal should be to figure out how to eliminate as much negative from both while also preserving both. I personally don't trust lab grown meat, there's just way too many variables that go into the life cycle of a creature that eventually winds up on your plate, mainly from a nutritional standpoint, for me to trust that a lab grown burger will have the same nutritional profile as a grass fed burger does.
I like you guys, but the claim about brazil rainforest e missleading, it's a major propaganda against our most efficient exporting sector, we have one of the most advanced legislations on presevation of native flora... i will send to you guys more information about Brazil and our agriculture.
I don’t eat meat I suck it
this is easily one of the coolest and most interesting channels on the internet
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive"  Me, eating food right now: I couldn't agree more
I think everyone is forgetting, if we stop eating this or that completely, then whatever we stopped eating will grow out of control. This goes for both animals and plants. Moreso for animals, however. This is why all (or a very large majority) of schools and nutritionists emphasise a balanced diet of both vegetables and meats.
Go vegan
I heard eating meat is better then eating vegetables
So wild cows wouldn't emit any methane then? Would slaughtering all cows so they stop farting please the green gurus?
If meat was that horrible, humans would've starved before agriculture 🤣
methane from animals is not new methane or additional methane that was already in the air and ground. animals are just part of the the methane ecycle
Interesting video, I find the info pretty useful!
I feel like something you're forgetting is dairy you don't farm beef you farm cows same with lamb and especially chickens  milk cheese and eggs are ultimately the main course with meat coming as a nice extra it's true that not all farms work at max efficiency but still it's inconciderate to just not mention that  also wish to mention the manure from earlier I'm unsure what exact efect that has but wouldn't lowering meat production lead to lower overall food production?  Overall this video is great in pure information but I feel it's too hyper-focused on meat alone even though animals produse far more not to say it's wrong just limited
Something that vegans dont understand is that the amount of meat produced wont decrease,only amount of buyers will.
This channel is supported by politics. I won't be vegetarian never! I will stop eating unhealthy food like sugar and carbs. But meet  chickens eggs are full of proteins.
Name 1 time you saw a vegan with muscle’s
This is such a stupid argument when you are ignoring the fact that the emission from food sources ultimately came from the existing environment to begin with.  It's another cycle being the carbon cycle just like the water cycle is be damned if you climate alarmists ever are going to point that out for the sheeple morons to grasp!!! UNSUBSCRIBED FOREVER!!!
Thank you for this information, I know being vegan is good for the environment,  but It was very hard for me to be vegan because I still cant let go of meat and its kinda expensive. So I was very happy that going beef free also a good alternatife, to change our diet for better environment, thank you XOXO
But this isn’t about the environment. Meat is not an environmental issue as much as it is a pressing ethical issue. Even if eating meat did not at all negatively impact the climate actually, one would still have a moral imperative as far as possible and practicable to desist their consumption of animals for food, fashion, cosmetics and entertainment by mere virtue of animals existing for their own purpose. Animals’ bodies are not ours. We have commodified them for profit because they are vulnerable, and erroneously believe that we can do with them as we please due to our speciesist bias (which is completely arbitrary and absurd). A cow is a pig is a chicken is a dog. There is no meaningful distinction among sentient beings that entitle us to regard some with care and support the brutalization of others. As philosopher Peter Singer puts it, “All arguments to prove man’s superiority cannot shatter this hard fact: in suffering the animals are our equals.” Which is the only characteristic that is worthy of consideration when it comes to our assignment of moral worth to animals (the ability to feel pain; which all animals raised for food unequivocally possess). With this in mind, it is therefore unjustifiable to promote, in this case the eating of animals, if one has the means not to. The practice of killing animals is unnecessary and therefore is a moral atrocity and injustice. In short: animals are not human resources and do not go willingly to their execution, no matter how they are “raised” or treated. All exploiting and killing of animals invokes violence and bloodshed, and is done through a lens of impunity and dominion.
You can't always listen to others! listen to your brain.   unless you are going to have health issues from meat. 😀
Why did the not talk about regenerative farming? Its the way we originally raised animals and it completely eliminates the use of fertilizer.
I really really don’t like this video because beef is one of my favorite foods
How come you guys didnt tell us about 96% of the water to produce meat comes form rain water. feels like u guys are pushing a certain agenda.
Meat is good for your health. Humans are Omnivores not herbivores. That's why the majority of humans eat meat and vegetables both.
Morally, it is good eating meat. It is a nutritious food that is very essential to a human diet. The environment itself is not something of value to a human life over and above human life and is thus not a concern in any of our dieting decisions. Eat meat, it is good and healthy for you. A vegan diet is not good for you as a normal thing. It’s great in small intervals but deadly as a lifestyle.
Cringe. Meat IS BAD because it requires the exploitation and murder of SENTIENT BEINGS And so is bad all other animal products for teh same reason.  The environment hazard from consuming animal products is karma for being horrible towards animals. That's what we deserve as the most evil specie on Earth.
Or scientists make lab meat from the DNA so no carbon and meat all around
I'd be happy to switch to a vegan diet if it wasn't for the fact that all of them are nutritionally deficient. Vegetal proteins are not PDCAAS complete, and vegan diets are notoriously lacking in Vitamin B12, B9 (folates) and iron. You could supplement with a multivitamin, but the evidence that vitamin/mineral supplements have any effect is still highly debated, so you might not be getting what you need in the end. Not an easy nut to crack.
we gotta eat yk
POV:peta is watching this
Interesting video. The title is misleading, though. The badness of meat does not only depend on the degree to which it contributes to climate change. There are some other issues which determine that meat eating is bad. One is the question of how morally right it is to inflict suffering on animals and kill them when we do not need meat for survival (as is generally the case). Another is the question of how moral it is to use plants to feed animals which we then eat, while we could also have used those plants to feed humans and solve the problem of world hunger. Yet another is the role of meat eating and the increased risk of pandemics. There are more examples of issues determining the badness of meat eating. So I would say: meat is bad for many reasons.
I love the balance of objectivity in representation contrasting with personal passion and ideology that drives your work. You make the reality of things easy to digest, provide motivation to work on not being perfect, but being better than your past self. Sharing the realization that we as individuals can shape our future, and providing a platform for us to engage with a community willing to accept gaps in knowledge, intent with being proven wrong, humble enough to say so, and driven enough to act with humanity beyond the standard of short term economically stubborn and traditional forms of action that have taken place beyond historical record nation to nation. You help alleviate the loneliness of self and constitutional segregation by speaking up for those ashamed and scared to state their age old observations. I appreciate nothing more than uninhibited understanding of what good we've done that brought us here, made me who I am, while pondering on our failures, learning, correcting, and invisioning a future free from predatory pride in preconcieved lies, conceited victory born of slander and bribes, comfortable conformation, over freedom for fear of loss, blinders on, a prison in a disguise.  Thanks 😊
The way the food is animated is so beautiful
Of course in difficult times time to say that meat is bad lol 😂 😆 😝
I have met someone today telling me eating quinoa grains was harmful to the environment while putting chunks of hams in her sandwich, i was just proposing the salad without saying anything on what she eats, i really could not care less. I really think the most harmful to the cause, are people that makes judgement on what you are consuming without checking their own.
Thank you for that kind of quality and informative videos
Okay, so lets genetically engineer livestick that emits far less carbon.  Better yet, remove their brains so they cant suffer.
Me watching this while eating meat:
Can I just say that I love the kind of people that these Kurzgesagt videos bring together? Even in disagreement, most of the conversations in the comments are open-minded and respectful. It really gives me hope.
1:40 Ah yes, as if billions of animals haven't been eating on this Earth for billions of years
Brought to you by NWO policy’s
Brought to you by the WTF
You forgot perhaps the most important part! How healthy and efficiently could the body live with limited or lack of meat products, taking into account how much easier it is to get certain nutrients and amino acids from specific foods. Keeping in mind deficiencies etc.
Climate change is happening, has been happening and will go on to happen when humans are long long gone, so its just a scaremongering tactic made up by a cabal of multi billionaires to control the human population so they can ultimately murder 95% of us and keep the planet for themselves! We have been terraforming the planet since day the day we learned how to light fire and we've been doing it to our benefit, so yeah we do release certain amount of pollution and whatnot into the earth and water and atmosphere, but again the climate is the least of our problems. Food shortages are 100x bigger problem, polluted waters are a 1000x bigger problem than scammade global warming, housing shortages, water shortages, electricity shortages, rare earth minerals shortages, unfertile land, etc... are literally 1000's and 100k thousands bigger issues than scammade climate change!

meat is good but it comes at a cost. Think I'll eat less fried chicken from now on, but I can't go entirely without it, literally impossible
Kurban kesmek en iyisi o zaman

As someone who likes veggies and fruits a whole lot more then meat and then chicken more then pork and beef, I’m happy that my carbon foot print from food is as small as it can be without being on any diet.

Please make video on Oppenheimer. as we got first look at Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer people are wanting to know more about who's Oppenheimer?
You know awareness is the best solution for example if we start growing small plant in the small space in homes like spinach or chickens for the middle class that have houses it reduces carbon foot print also it may not work for farms but at homes small steps for fertilisation produce better results
go watch the movie snowpiercer if you want to see what they really want for the human race
It's "bad" because you cannot afford it anymore because of Bidenomics
!!!!

I'm okay with that.
just go vegan for your own sake!
Me who loves potatoes and hates …most meat.:
I thought you’d be creditable. But you somehow forgot what part of a whole wheat plant humans can eat, what do you do with the rest? Cows can eat that, humans can’t. You can waste it and generate more carbon for nothing, or you can feed it to livestock for more food. The choice is yours.  I guess you’re not creditable then.
i ate a burger while i watched haha
Don't worms help soil become healthy
Climate is a selfish reason not to eat meat. What about the suffering of animals? That’s a really altruistic reason. And solely reducing does not solve that problem. We can and should stop eating them, not reducing our consumption
The only problem here is that we have too many human on earth
always remember: whether someone is or not a hypocrite is irrelevant to the discussion of whether humans should or should not eat animal products. whether someone fits the definition of vegan or not is irrelevant to the discussion of whether humans should or should not eat animal products.
Lots of trolls in this comments section trying to bring up topics that are completely irrelevant to the core discussion just because they feel bad about themselves. Sad cognitive dissonance in action
Climate is a selfish reason not to eat meat. What about the suffering of animals? That’s a really altruistic reason. And solely reducing does not solve that problem. We can and should stop eating them, not reducing our consumption
I think the question is simple, "do you want a living feeling being that has babies and can form a family to die for your pleasure?" If the answer's no, you are ethical. if the answer's yes, depending on your level access to other forms of healthy and nutritious food, you are either selfish or have no better options than to eat meat.   So if you can afford to buy food that is largely vegetarian and you still eat meat every day, I'm sorry but you are selfish and irresponsible.
Excellent video - the truth about animal foods
Diet doesn't effect climate change. It effects the enivmorent. Enviorment= Climate they go hand I hand. Beef realseases gmg emissions which doesn't effect the climate bad. The amount of people that eat cow it wouldn't effect atmosphere hardly at all.
Vegan would use even more land because the replace products
.
We Indians knew this 4000 years ago
Okay, counterargument: blow it out your ass
You shall only kill if it is necessary. Meat production is wrong. Every animal should ne free unless theyre a threat or are dependsble on humans. Only hunted if meats needed. Today its overproduced. Everyone should get a limit.
We have enough space left for tons of trees its just nobody does something about it
Clearly indicating that we need to drastically reduce our population.
It is not a given that more CO2 is bad for the Earth. It does give more plants and probably more biodiversity.
I still can’t believe baby male chickens get shredded
The kind of foods people eat cannot be enforced by law. There is an element personal choice. The issue is cruelty to animals and one another. We don’t share food as we could But beside turning a blind eye to starvation, we justify gluttony and capitalize on it. Nutrition does impact health, but animals are are treated, grown, fed, and slaughtered in unspeakable ways. Many people don’t care and do not want to learn, ask questions or know. Industries become wealthy using this to monetary advantage. So, animals and people are used to personal advantage.
10:08 i mean those fake beef paties are very bad for health
This was first called “MEAT HATE” and now it’s “MEAT LOVE”
Even the science PROVES that eating meat is unsustainable.
The "Beyond" Meat Company should sponsor you.
the vegan teacher's favorite video lol
I find people tend to look at things with an all or nothing mentality. Making changes in moderation tend to have a longest lasting effects. My family used to eat meat almost daily - mostly poultry & fish, but on occasion, beef or lamb. But when my wife became a vegetarian, our son, who's an even bigger meat lover than me, and I started sampling the vegetarian dishes she initially made for herself. The plant based dishes were so tasty that our son & I just started eating whatever she made. I was surprised to realize I didn't miss meat. However, once-in-a-while my son or I might crave a steak or burger or chicken wings or sashimi, but not often. My son and I probably have meat about once a month now ‐ and that's us not setting out to reduce our meat intake. I'm not saying it will be this easy for everyone, but it's really not as difficult as you would think, especially with all the impressive alternatives that are available today.
One thing I can’t help but wonder, is what was the source of food like before we industrialized and farmed them? And what was the state of carbon and methane emissions at the time?  You’d figure methane would still be an issue with buffalos, woolly mammoths, and wild cows roaming around freely without human interference. Is global warming a new issue, or has it always been a thing and only accelerated fairly recently?
Collect the carbon from a factory,put a methane tent over a field,use a nuclear fusion reactor to create iron
Watching this for the first time in July 2022 and when bro said "there are a few shiny calendars left" I was like BRUH they didn't sell out of these? Then I realized how far behind I am in the Kurzgesagt world.
Cows literally benefit carbon cycles. You aren’t calculating the amount of carbon they turn into dirt
You guys have never been on a farm and it shows. The beef  get most of there water from the green they eat and on top of that the cow eats up alot of inedible plant byproduct that we can't consume. I wish yall actually get out there and see. Also places like Chile and California where almonds grown in California is causing a bigger drought because all the ground water they take up and same goes in Chile with the avocados. I really feel like channels like these just take all the evidence of 1 side and not enough from the other. Also put in to account that most of the gastric bypass surgical procedures are done on primarily vegans. We can definitely argue that to have a mixed diet but to blame livestock is just ridiculous. Also not to mention livestock also fertilize the ground aswell
Music fits the description of food at the start tho
Im having a meat feast pizza watching this so ill say meat isnt bad at all
I am glad that they acknowledged the useless land.  I know that near where I live we have hundreds of square miles of useless desert that is designated as “cattle land”, even though it’s rarely used for grazing.
Ow much is fish fo co2.
As a gaucho, meat is one of the most important parts of my culture
Disappointed that they completely left out the amazing impact of regenerative farming/ranching techniques that sequester incredible amounts of CO2.  If you don’t know about regenerative farming give it a look!  It so hopeful!!!
the only solution to this problem. it would simply stop having children every 30 years. less people on the planet less resources less less pollution. It's quite simple but that won't happen
Honestly, ill go vegan as soon as vegan meat will be easy for me to access
"Land used that is used to grow food for live stocks will instead be used to grow forests"  LOL NO you naive f  It will be used to grow more crops to feed even more people. Don't believe? Just look at populations of vegan countries like India  More population will cause so much more problem in other resources, energy, or water use  You should instead be thankful that meat consumption is keeping developed countries birth rate low
surprised at the lack of health benefits to a plant-based lifestyle discussed in this video

I love how he keeps changing the thumbnail
Who the fuck even said that meat was bad for you in the first place. Meat is muscle, we have muscle. Do the fucking math.
The comments over here inspire hope.
Had no idea freight ships were so efficient
So the actual problem is that the world is overpopulated.
I've never had anyone tell me I can decide for myself.
i hate that people r having a opinion here, u cant disagree with facts. if u like meat  and meat is bad then u cant disagree that it is bad. its like saying that 1+1 isnt 2 and ween somebody gives u a clear explanation that it is 2 you say i dont think so
Ecologically there needs to be dung beetles taking the dung back into the earth. There are successful breeding programs in New Zealand and the impact on the soil is often profound.
Food CO2:don’t do it
Thank you for this super interesting video . I was thinking tho that maybe it might be relevant to also include the good effect that cows also have on the environment.  Plants that cows eat secastrate carbon in the ground and the cows eat that carbon and transforme it in something else .so i was wondering ,if it Would be fair to also deduct the carbon they produce by the carbon they remove by eating plants ? Maybe worth investigating more .
00:45 i never notice but the ape from the starting point eat cow! I think the kurzgesagt hid this kind of easter egg all over their videos!!!!
when u guys do face raval
Well then lab meat is a good news, and now there is a restaurant in Singapore that sells lab made chicken. PS, don't free up dairy land.
My compromise is eat about 80% native animals, in my case its kangaroo that eat a wider variety of plants in the wild, I have a beef steak about once a month. hopefully lab grown meat becomes a viable choice in the near future.
9:46 Who eats a dendritic cell
Comparing cargo ships and cars that are used to transport different types of food implies that these avocados are not transported by car from port, which is, if you turn your brain, not true.
I’d like to hear something about lab grown meat and fish.
for those that cant se the dislike count: 14k
day 29 watching this while eating meat

Pigs and chicken do not really eat only grain or corn. Trust me. I am living in romania and my chicken eat even cherrys if you give them  cherrys. Pigs also eat qlmost everything you give them. Gras, rotten vegetables, some kind of leaves and many other things make up a good portion of a chickens menu.
Nature knows best if we all went vegan where are we going to plant all those crops and what about soil health and quality isn't that important and what about maintaining grasslands which are major carbon sinks. Just use all the land for giant crop farms i suppose
This channel is a parasite for humanity...
Stop breeding, stop using animal products buy seed bearing products. Decriminalize all drugs tax their sale use the taxes for clean drinking water for the world and few healthcare and scientific college degrees. Pool the profits salaries wages and split them evenly. Develop voting software for phones computers and tablets.
you guys should do electric cars, they say batteries are worse for extracting it and it's bad for the environment than gas in the long run
There is a big point missing, when the things we feed to beef decompose, they emmit carbon dioxide too. So technicaly that carbon would anyway end up beeing released as methane. On the other hand fossil fuels not being burned does not emmit carbon, so the real avoidable carbon comes from fossil fuel burning, for energy generation and transportation. This days a ton of the informative videos about this topic use as baseline some studies that are biased by not looking at the big picture of where does that carbon come from. Food waste for example is a big offender in terms of carbon emmision but no one is caring. This is just a big campaign to make money of.
Hey, if a medieval Irish man can live off of mashed potatoes 3 times a day, then so can we
what if u genetically modify all ruminants, pigs, and poultry to the point that they only consume grass, utilize 100% of the nutrients and make them grow detachable limbs and organs (excess)
Meat is still gonna be in my belly
Animal products are healthiest foods
Interesting, still gonna eat meat and do whatever I want until I die, after all Whats the point in living if I don’t enjoy it to my own desires, the worlds gonna die eventually anyways, for all I care half the planet could blow up tomorrow, I can only live close to a century anyways and then I will be rotting underground or some ashes in an Urn. I have zero Logical reason to care about the planet dying, plus I honestly think life will find a way anyways. That’s my Take, Nihilistic and Darwinistic for me.
There’s an undeniable ethical problem with eating animals in western countries. But people love to hear what exemptes them from any accountability.  I love this channel but not every topic has a gray area. Sometimes things are black and white. Just because many people do the wrong thing does not make it right and I wish this channel faced controversial yet very clear facts about the ethics of animal agriculture, but I guess they’ll keep beating around the bush to not upset a lot of people with the inconvenient truth about our current mistreatment of animals. Too “political” for them maybe
In our hindu religion it is mentioned that the people who eat meat are very angry and merciless. That's why we Hindus eat veg 100%. Muslims eat a lot of beef that's why their religion is very angry and merciless towards others.
'What about lab grown meat' is the exact that copium huffing tripe that motivates takes like 'We'll just science our way out of climate change' The are real solutions that actually exist. Vegan diets are bloody hard and expensive but anyone can go vegetarian its so fucking easy.
What about other aspects of product-consuming society ? Buying new iphone every few years. buying all this tesla's and other "cool" stuff make also significant impact.
Kurzgesagt : Terraforming Venus is easy  Also Kurzgesagt : Meat …. Is Complicated
Imagine if That Vegan Teacher saw this….dang bro she be ranting on and on
When I heard the use poo to grow food  *vomit*
When food gets taken away from me *nuclear war happens*
Gonna eat a big steak and watch this video.
I would really love to see regenerative farming and permaculture beef discussed in this video as well, where plants and animals are grown/raised on the same farm in a compatible way. I know this makes WAY less beef, but it would be interesting to learn about since some beef from regenerative farms claims to be carbon negative.

Prohibit Meat
7:21 this little guy in the corner speaks out exactly what I was thinking. So much detail in these videos! Thank you!
Every person in the world should see this. In the headlines and news we only hear about how bad Diesel and gasoline is for our climate, so that we think Electro cars will safe our planet. In reality the food we eat makes a much biger impact
I’ve watched all videos in this channel EXCEPT this one….
I think something that wasn't mentioned is the methane argument really doesn't make sense. Methane only lasts for about 10-12 years. So long as we don't increase the population of cows on the planet, methane is not a problem. Methane has only been linked to cows because our beef intake has increased drastically in the last 2 centuries. However, as long as it doesn't keep on increasing, our methane footprint won't change
In short?   YES!! Bad for your health and bad for our environment
I guess they forgot to mention that the amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere by pastures usually compensates for the CO2 released by machinery and the cows feeding on said pasture. Of course, there are many different variables at play (kind of pasture system, number of animals per acre and location - to mention a few), but more often than not, the production of grass-fed beef will remove more CO2 than it releases.
Thank you for addressing some of the most widespread myths about food emissions and the ethical problems associated with animal agriculture—meat-eating drives global warming, biodiversity loss, pandemic risks, and animal exploitation. Instead of swapping beef for other animal products, people need to be encouraged to choose plant-based alternatives.
What about a season diet base. Consumerism is the problem we need to change our diet according to cycles of our planet we still have industrial crops that have a big impacto that eventually with our consumist nature will create another problem even if every human is vegan tomorrow.
Did Bill Gates sponsor this video?
S
This video changed my life by the way.
You need a 12 minutes and 7 Second video to say "yes" or "no"
Tbh knowing that a beef free diet would free up 2 billion hectares I think I can accept not eating beef
Why didn't you make a video about ... cultured meat?
it isnt the meat itself thats bad, its just how we produce the meat that's screwing us over
In my defense, the meat that i eat come from animals who eat vegetables and fruits.
Meat is bad in general
It is very hard to see Brazil being portrayed like this, it is true though. Our government basically doesn't give a f*ck about us, we definitely need a better educational system, let's hope we can change that! Thank you Kurzgesagt for the amazing video and the explanation.
I kept thinking about this video and the points it misses?  One thing that bugged me for so long, to the point that I returned to actually write this, is the argument of transport pollution the video offers. They state that the ships are much more efficient and so on but, once shipped, the cargo still gets transported around the very same way as the locally produced meat and veggies? So in total, wouldn't it be more pollution to import the veggies and grain? Furthermore, I'd still need more research, but isn't it more ethical to buy local? As usually the import of cheap mass goods is driven by cheaper foreign workforce under straining conditions?
Why are they eating helper t cells?
really hoping one day we can finally crack the code to perfect meat alternatives that taste the exact same. No denying that a vegetarian diet would help the climate so much, i still think dairy products and eggs should stay though. If theres no factory farming it would be extremely humane and sustainable
Ok Mr Bill Gates, what’s for dinner?  Modified soy, update 42069 again?  Oh joy
If making meat is so devastating why don't we make vegetables taste like meat???
So let's say the world goes vegetarian:   - 4% of total human greenhouse gas emissions are neutralized.   - Dairy production increases to meet demand for quality fat and protein - Emissions from dairy sector significantly rise.   - Demand for eggs increases for the reasons as dairy - Emissions from poultry don't go as far down as anticipated.   - 250 calories per day per person is no longer meat, but plant products.  Plant based food production for humans goes up 10%, with associated emissions.   - Small leather producers are put out of business as a wave of cheap cow skin hits the market.  The consolidation of leather producers reduces competition and the prices eventually go up.  Global use of pleather and other petroleum based products increases to compensate.  Emissions- blah blah you get it.   - Wool prices drastically increase, as income from lamb and mutton production disappear.  Petroleum-based synthetics take over, as above.   - Asian goat herders, no longer able to food themselves, sell their herds to industrial fabric producers.  Carbon footprint of Cashmere and Mohair industries increases.   - Grasslands all over the world once occupied by domesticated ruminants are now occupied by naturally occurring ruminants, which have increased by an unprecedented tens of millions.  They eat and fart just as much as the domesticated animals that used the land before them.   - Some unexpected demand for farm land for animal feed arises, as all the calories previously supplied by meat industry byproducts have to be provided by plants.  This includes foods for pets and work animals that are not exclusively carnivore.  All dogs are now vegetarian.    - Demand for flattened rainforest and associated local labour drops, causing the governments of those countries to further subsidize the sector.  Another industry takes beef's place, saving money for consumers all around the world, but increasing the carbon footprint for that product.   - Burned and rotting rainforest continues to release the same about of C02 and methane as it did before.   - Ancient cultures around the world see a massive exodus, as traditional farming methods fail to produce enough calories for the tribes at their current populations.  They adapt into some kind of city life, with an associated increased carbon footprint.  Are we still confident we can even get that 4% reduction?!?!?  Ignoring all of the above, within two years, human emissions are back to where they were before we went vegetarian.  Human increases of greenhouse gasses has been going up 3% on average every year since the 1940s.  Removing 4% of that increase rate won't slow it down by any significant amount.  Also: Total annual methane has gone up about 10% in the past ten years, yet total number of beef has remained the same (about 1 billion).    So I guess the question is.... how  is targeting the meat industry an efficient use of time in any conceivable manner?  If we're going to solve global warming, we need a fundamental shift.  Not a plan that *at best* *might* get a 4% reduction, with significant caveats.  It just seems intellectually and emotionally lazy.  There's actual hard and important work to do and think about.  Go go and think about those things.
Much of the food produced gets thrown in the garbage since food is not a targeted source like it was when humans were hunting for local interests. Now we have 1 person who owns a fried chicken franchise that thinks he needs to produce a million chickens not to feed people but to create inventory to make money. Same for the burger and seafood people. They also will throw any packaged food in the garbage that a customer didn't pick up or rejected. Also ask yourself if all that produce and meat you see in the supermarket is gonna get sold and consumed? I wouldn't say the non optional need to eat is as represented or at least it shouldn't be.
90% of what we feed to ruminant livestock is human-inedible byproducts of agriculture, like corn stalks and husks and almond shells. 94% of water consumed by cattle in the United States is from rainwater that would have fallen on that location anyway, and that water is later urinated out in the same area. It doesn't just sit in the cow forever. The cattle are turning all of this waste into edible meat products for us.
Why the fuck is everything that is amazing in this world so bad for existence of this world?! Who put all these temptations around us knowing the selfishness and careless nature would doom us… fuck!!! I’m thawing two NY strips to grill over a fire… it’s too damn good.
There’s the beyond meat meat that is a veggie that looks, smells and tastes like a regular meat burger
I'm curious what role sea food could play in all this. (I'm woefully undereducated on these issues unfortunately. 😅 If anyone who knows stuff has any advice, I'd appreciate a link or two at least.)
U can live with 1 kg of beef for atleast 2 days with no problem but u need 2 kg of potatos for 2 days and have a lot of problems
I just wish we would lower our meat production by 20-30%, as studies have shown that would cut out a little over half of the emissions related to meat, due to exactly how livestock and specifically cattle emit greenhouse gases- hint: almost all of it isn't in their farts.
You can decide what you want to do with this information. Decide wisely, please.
In a nutshell videos in a nutshell: Hello lets get into the video Were all going to die Maybe not all of us are going to die
But what do you do when COVID has ruined your taste and still Hasent came back for a year and you barrely like anything
Ok, i can be withnout beef, BUT DONT EVEN TRY TO TAKE POLUTRY AWAY FROM ME
Hey how did the avocados get to the ships?  It must have been those non-local trucks, huh.
The world cannot subsist on plants. Consider fertilizers
What crop can convert the scrub grass of the western US into usable nutrition like cattle ranching?   None.
Have you ever thought about dub the videos in other languages, like Portuguese Brazil?
A kilogram of beef would keep u alive much longer than a kilogram of potatoes.  As a potato lover i was shocked to know it
“thats why it hits our special nerve” i 100 percent agree with u but if theres no solution then the climate change cant be eradicated
大型畜牧業確實需要轉型!
Maybe
here's a factor you forgot to include in your research; waste. it doesn't matter if i personally eat less meat or that i buy it locally to save on emissions on transport. the producers of said product will produce it and transport it all the same, and the stuff they don't sell simply gets thrown out. a significant amount of people need to adopt the same logic and stick to it, for this to even remotely have an impact, and while that might reduce the carbon footprint locally, you need to remember that these are businesses, they'll simply find a customer elsewhere to buy what they can't sell to my community, be it at reduced price or not. it doesn't matter, the same amount of product will be produced and sold.
scream and shout all you want, i ain't going vegan. it doesn't matter if the plant-'meat' "taste just like real meat" its not the real deal and its probably full of all sorts of chemicals as well as having less nutritional value.
Nothing about this is science.
I'm actually flabbergasted by just how stupid this video is, and that people are lapping it up.    Methane (carbon + hydrogen) released by cows came from the plants they ate, which absorbed it from the air.  It's a cycle - no new carbon is created or removed.    Carbon released from burning fuel which was pumped from underground carbon sinks, is releasing carbon into the air that otherwise wouldn't have been there.    See the difference???
hey how did the avocados get on the ships?  I guess those trucks weren't local or something.
change your diet and be malnourished to fight climate change because global commerce doesn't care.  how much of a god complex does somebody need to take this seriously?  fuckouttahere
Bro I apologize for deleting my comment cuz it was about BORING stuff.
Yeaaaa, I'm still eating beef and meat. Veggie patties are gross af.
5:00 - Everyone focuses upon CO2 emissions and yet they don't think about other environmental costs, and these costs have knock-on effects to CO2.   Avocados are a great example of this and it's why I chose this timestamp. Avocados require a ridiculous amount of water and the wests demand for it has resulted in poor water management in many South-American nations. This has caused droughts and crop failures which increase CO2 output as other crops have to be shipped in or water has to be pumped away from the rivers which supply rainforests.   As always the people who claim to be solving things are often incapable of understanding how the world is far more complex than they believe it is.
The reality is, changing our diets to meat free (specifically beef) is the easiest change and choice we can make to help our planet.
2 Vegans are arguing, and are now mad at each other, do you still call it a beef?
All of our problems would be solved if we followed one child per family policy
Still going to eat beef
Not to mention the damage animal products do to human health and athletic performance
So what about agricultural land that is not suitable for raising crops, that is currently used for raising sheep etc?
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old” oh I beg to differ
The important thing is with this stuff is to just do what YOU can and use common sense   if you can replace beef with chicken ect great if you can’t or simply do it someTimes that’s also fine  You don’t need to be drinking “organic nongmo Keto friendly vegan Kosher Cleansing diet replacement shakes” (Which tend to be be scams and or Bullocks anyway) For every meal of the day    Also responsibly farmed beef Straight up tastes better and his less fatty But  is also so much more expensive So don’t feel bad if you Aren’t exclusively eating that type of beef it’s just good to know so you can make smart choices and do what YOU can
I DONT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE CLIMATE
I used to eat a lot of meat, until I started raising my own livestock. I realized they have personalities, and I can't abide the way they're treated industrially. I still eat some, but overall I eat far less meat than before, and the only chicken I eat is to control my flock.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day, & never gets old." Not if i can do somethiny about it
The real problem is corporations, not us. Even if most of us ate no meat at all, we’d still have insane carbon emissions. Saving our planet starts with enacting legislation to limit corporations and fossil fuels.
Bro that chimpanzee in the beginning always tells us the topic😂😂😂😂
Miniature cow
Food is a pleasure allright but have ever needed the bathroom for hours and been finally been able to use it?
The only meat I used to eat is bacon because my taste was weird and now my taste is fucked up and I can barely eat anything and now bacon tastes bad so technically I’m vegan I spose
Everything here in the comment section is so heated. Can't we all just agree that you can eat whatever you want?
Or better yet.. Carbon capture technology. If needed. More carbon would be a good thing for plants as history has shown those of us without an agenda.
tvt would be not happy :I
I am vegetarian from birth
食卓にある食べ物を残さない事がエコにつながるとも思う
If we all go vegan wouldn’t we need more land to grow vegetables and fruit?
Admittedly this video is in line with the world economic forum declaring we're going to eat a lot less meat 🍖🥓
We need Legislation to place a cap on Cow & other meat production animal Herd population Numbers 🔢 so that corporations can not have feed Lot's with tens of thousands of cows in one Place
Beans Beans are good for your Heart ❤️ The more we eat! The More we Fart. Kangaroos emit less polluting methane than beef
Let’s all just eat potatoes. You’ve seen The Martian. Potatoes are universal asf. French fries, Chips, mashed potatoes, potato soup, potato salad ECT. Plus you just cut the mfs in half or quarters, plant em and bam… potato plant.
What about regenerative agriculture with the use of livestock? This agricultural practice has a negative CO2 emission
Just plant more trees and we wouldn’t have to worry about how much emissions our food makes.
I think it says it all that whenever there is a meat ad there is always a SMILING and laughing animal......which is about to be slaughtered and eaten.
3D printed meat made from plant based cartridges is environment friendly so it’s artificial meat so no harm to wild life
How about we move to the moon? Moon farming and colonization
Fun fact: In the US, Plant agriculture causes more emissions than animal agriculture. And if you want to talk about methane, don't forget that grass that goes to feeding cattle traps some CO2 from the atmosphere, creating a cycle of methane emission and consumption so technically, while cattle does emmit methane, the amount of methane in the atmosphere stays the same if we keep the same numbers of cattle from year to year.
Meat is the best food in the world.
I find it funny how people take 1 aspect of something and demonize the whole thing. The biggest contributor of methane is humans. Humans contribute approximately 60% of methane emissions. So are we saying we should go on a human free world instead of beef free diet? Stupid reasoning
My question is: should the choice lie on citizens or on governments?
Recently, in Australia, a genus of native seaweed was found to actually negate cow methane production by about 95%! Apparently, it also makes the cow grow a little bit faster as well. So potentially we could have our beef and eat it too.
meat a week is kinda okay
0:33 we all need a Kurzgesagt button in our lives
There's no point at defending eating corpses of sentient beings.
I'm still eating meat. Not eating meat (or reducing consumption) is simply unacceptable. You don't solve problems by cutting back, by degrading your standard of life. The best solution in my opinion is to develop the technology to make synthetic food. That is food that is just as tasty and nutritious as organically produced food but created in chemical factories. For example creating simple carbohydrates using artificial photosynthesis and then making more complex ones with another method. Then you could use those carbs to feed us and also to feed artificial animal cell cultures that get turned into meat cuts. That way you have the meat we all love without degrading the environment and harming animals. We need to invest into daring, revolutionary technology in order to solve climate change, our current methods and near future technology won't be enough.
i don't care, I'll be dead before the world falls apart!!! beef yummy yummy!!!
Tl;dw *YES, YES IT IS.* (Beef especially)
Propaganda
the problem is not eating beef, it's population size. having less than 2 children is an extremely better contribution to the environment than going vegan. food is a small portion of the impact, which goes beyond carbon emissions.
Bro I'm Indian and I am vegan for my whole life because junk food here is veagan
i have a question. how much does one person make in his/her carbon footprint and if he or she changes to a vegan diet how much carbon do they save from the environment
Did y’all see the giant T cell on the table??  At  9:45
In other words: yes.  Going vegan, vegetarian or simply just reducing meat in your diet will do a lot. Animals should never be treated so badly. They should roam freely outside.
I get 70% of my protein from meat 🍖 😋
i have not found a single coment about the fact that the monkey in the intro is always holding sonething diferent related to the video
Does anyone have any information on how to reduce meat production? I’ve thought that even if I didn’t buy beef, it would either spoil and be thrown away and the total amount produced would not change due to the demand. If a large amount of people stopped buying meat, would the production drop because less demand or do grocery stores just continually stock up regardless
Japan: Eats meat. Also Japan: Longest lifespans globally.   Veganism in the West has been blind to the fact it’s to do with what sort of meat you eat, how often and of course the way it’s prepared.
does any country other than the USA actually eat all that much beef ? beef around here is rare because it's expensive and tough, i don't think my family has ever bought beef.
YEESSS!!!! KURZGESAGT IS DISSING THATVEGANTEACHER!!!!!!  edit: the monkey in the intro is eating a cow lol
*andyoudidnttalkabouttheethics*
I changed almost all my food to vegetarian food. Because it's cute that people don't eat dogs and cats. But one day, I started to look cute with fish, pigs, and chickens. I don't want to eat something cute. And I don't want animals to be in pain on the farm. It's too hard to be a complete vegetarian. There's pork in the snack, too. It's hard to avoid. I'm just eating a lot less meat.
we are humans are not only causing carbon emissions but cruelly killing billions of animals each year
plus humans kill billion animals cruely per year
As a pescatarian, I would have loved to see how fish stacked up compared to other meats.
Someone send this to the vegan teacher
Cool vid :D I am going for a steak for dinner tonight.
You missed 0art that natural manure plays in rejuvenation of soil. Some scientists say we have around 20 years of top soil usability left.
Far as I'm concerned, so long as the meat isn't packed with preservatives, it's perfectly fine to eat. (As well as fresh obviously.😑)  Unfortunately, there is such thing as eating too much. Which I certainly do.
OK so like ummm, I made my decision. I'll stick with grass-fed beef.
It is true, we can't rely on grass-fed beef to meet human consumption because of its inefficiency. This does not mean we need to grow grains to feed beef cattle. We can divert high energy food waste that would have ended up in landfill because of poor rating for not meeting consumer demands to replace the grains in cattle feed. Consequently, the food waste, which is now cattle feed would reduce landfill emissions and spare land used for grains. This is what we should do!
There are controversies in methane from cattle contributing to man made emissions but the author of this video doesn't want to dive deep into it. This shows that there's a hidden agenda... apart from cow, man made methane emissions come from many sources including, Paddy rice production, organic and food waste decomposition on landfill sites, and ancient stored carbon removed thru fossil fuel production (which when you want to do proper LCA of transportation, you would see how much this sector contributes to greenhouse gas emissions). Anaerobic process by microbes in the ocean, glaciers, and termites are natural sources that also contribute to methane released into the atmosphere. Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) used in estimating the carbon footprint from the beginning to the end of a product, usually use a 100 yr global warming potential to standardize non-CO2 greenhouse gases (e.g. methane and nitrous oxide) emissions to that of CO2 for calculations. However, methane does not stay in the atmosphere for 100 yrs like CO2 but 10yrs and is gone. So this video contains half truth...but I like the animation though 🤔
i absolutely loathe how in food shops i can now see baggies of dried insects marketed "help save the earth" - yeah? what about all that shipping from thailand and other countries going half the world to reach my countries, where there are no scorpions, but plenty of cows? the hypocrisy is just so obvious - it's not about the earth, it's about the profit. regardless, it's not in my culture to eat insects, so i won't. i also won't include insects in my carnivore oets diets because it's not good for them. omnivore pets (like dogs) can handle it, but carnivore oets (like cats) absolutely can't, shouldn't, and it should be categorized as animal abuse imho tbh. i am omnivore (just like nature intended) - can't live on grass alone. can't live on meat alone. tried both, and a healthy balance is the key 🔑 but please, no insects in my diet, and none of that lab grown meat which is almost (or totally?) void of minerals, nutrients and life experience.
Nikocado avocado be like:
OR SIMPLY STOP DEFENDING ANIMAL EXPLOITATION
We can use cow methane we a power source maybe
But what about if EVERYBODY is going to eat soya products? Doesn’t make the % much higher and practically the same as meat is now?
This is complete crap.  Methane poses no threat.  According to IPCC data it will take about 400 years to double and according to good science it will cause less than 0.2 C warming.   Now do you really think that is worth making much effort about when there are far more serious problems in the world?
I have reduced my meat consumption, but tbh I don't do it for environmental reasons. I do it to cut costs and for health reasons. I see nearly 0 impact that individuals can make a difference. One would need to stop subsidizing meat production and ban imports to make a serious change happen. And I don't see that happening. One would need to make meat a luxury item again, as it once was. I for one would be fine with that...as long as there were a commensurate decrease in price for other products.
I have an better idea of reducing pollution. Why not to make farms on rooftops of skyscrapers? This will reduce carbon emissions because no longer forests will cut down.
Please translate this video to spanish!
Hamburgers till I die.
I don't see how carbon emissions from food quadruple by 2100, if we need to make a change for climate how about stop fucking breeding
a lot of the crops used as animal feed aren't suitable for human food anyway, agriculture isn't some 100% efficient system
its not so much that everyone needs to go vegan.. even cutting down our consumption of meat to 1-2 times a week would drastically change things. Make it a treat again, not a staple.
Some other important aspects of this issue are water consumption and animal waste especially in CA. local grass fed beef uses less water and the cow waste is able to be processed by the soil. CAFOs (with cows eating farmed plants) use swimming pools of water for a couple servings of beef and the cows waste is often dumped into water systems where it causes pollution and even toxic algae blooms
I've never so much from literal ducks
I am sending this video to both my children: "Hi Jessica and Adrian!"
2:36 is a bit Zipfy
Ok so... a fact that you guys didnt go over is lab grown meat, which has developed recently. Its more healthy, tastier, ethical, nutritious, and doesnt emit carbon while cloning the healthy muscle cells.
Idea: Collect the methane produced by cows Methane is flammable and is the main component of natural gas This means it can be used to generate power Power the farm purely on the by-products of the cows       Sike, that'll release CO2
beef  but what about pig meat?
Vegan propaganda
I went vegan 8 years ago and it remains one of the best life decisions I’ve ever made. I’m so much healthier, and so much happier knowing I’m no longer contributing to unnecessary suffering, nor unnecessary extra environmental damage. I’m not preaching to anyone, just putting it out there that going vegan improved my life dramatically and can do the same for you should you choose to pursue it. ☺️✌🏻
So Indians dont eat beef for a reason very well known to them from millenniums, but no one listened.
This is why I went vegetarian. The environmental impact of animal products is too high which had left me feeling really guilty. I'm not vegan as I do occasionally eat eggs but I cut out meat and dairy. More people need to reduce or eliminate animal products.
You guys should make a video about the benefits towards climate change farming bugs has
I will actually continue eating meat not some shitty "meat".
Hi getting new
Ok, Let's eat Big Mac.
I like how the monkey at the intro (0:46) is always holding something different
i love me some motherfucking steak
But aren't the cereals fed to cows and other livestock consist of the parts that are indigestible to humans?
Goood you guys stop eating meat, and there´ll be more for me.
This is like the 7th "climate crisis" in the last 100 years
Something that I feel isn't mentioned, and why personally I can't cut down meat, is allergies or intolerances. I'm gluten intolerant. Cutting meat, AND wheat makes a diet that it's too time expensive to cook. For example, you can find pizzas that are gluten free. And vegan pizzas. Finding gluten free, vegan pizzas? Not a single one. I do cut down in beef, since I don't like it that much anyway, but there isn't much I can do. And also, every human needs to socialize. Not eating gluten already makes it so much harder for me to go and eat somewhere, and I still have to sometimes eat some anyway, and bear with the consequences later. If I was vegan too I wouldn't be able to eat outside, period.  My hopes are in (affordable) meat substitutes. Burgers are the only beef I cook, and I always try new vegan alternatives if I see them. When I see some that taste good, I'll change it from buying beef, since it's also healthier for me anyway.
Only Imam Al-Mahdi can solve the meat problem.
Thinking about how chickens are fed plants which could feed us. Why did people domesticate chicken, besides the fact it's a cute animal and excellent pet?  I am curious why people eat chicken and other meat products if it uses up plant based foods. After all, people used to be poor. I understand why people eat cows. Adam Smith saays that as society is less developed and there is more grass, beef is cheaper. But the more the society develops, the more expensive beef gets since fewer people let their coes run amok grazing everywhere. But chicken eats plant. Poor people eat chicken instead of chicken feed. Do worms comprise enough of a chicken's diet to make it profitable or add missing nutrients? This is an interesting question.
In Australia only 8% of land is suitable for cropping and about 98% of our meat is grass fed. Also, grazing plants stimulates more plant growth, which accelerates the absorption of carbon dioxide from air into plants and soil. Also, in a recent study, red seaweed given as an additive reduces methane by 98%. Our red meat industry has halved GHG since 2005 and are on track to be carbon neutral by 2030
I'm okay with beef being much less and being rationed if we make it 100% grass fed.
Brazil is my least favourite country for these reasons: . Burning rainforest . Sinful carnaval of indecency . General third world corruption and crime and social disorder, but it seems worse than the Middle East
The thing which I thing humanity depends on for raising cattle is feeding cattle Mootral, a mix of garlic and orange, to reduce methane, and pink Australian seaweed to reduce burping.
Taking a good crap is enjoyable also.
hey I just wanted to say that the Netherlands is realy doing great job at reduccing emisions in agriculture we produce a lot off products with the least emision and are still looking for better ways. But we went en going through a hard time because al these changes are expensive and most can almost not afford it. so we are doing as best as we can and still get a lot of blame. I just want you guys know this and know that is been hard and we do al we can to reduce emisions but stil make a living.(almost all farmers here have a second job just to get food on the table)
Meat isn't bad. It's the vegan activists that are.
*Glad to be vegitarian and an Indian.*
thanks kurzgesagt.. that i am allowed to say the truth.. all the days i have been here.

"Rice emits methane" *eyes package of rice in the pantry with suspicion*
Important Message, interresting, family friendly, love
fake news
Fuck the emissions. When the ‘elites’ stop jetting everywhere in their private planes etc then I’ll cut back on my ethical locally sourced meant intake. I wont eat meat that’s led a life of misery and torture and been fed unnatural garbage, ever.
Are alive is horrible.
The planet will out live me, pass the steak!
*Watches while eating a beef burger from Burger King*

I'd eat plant-based alternatives, but it turns out they aren't cheap! Govts should take a step and subsidize the low carbon alternatives. Same goes for electric car batteries which are the limiting factor when buying one. It only gets cheaper at the end of its life, most people don't have enough money to invest on it prior to its use.
i ain’t giving up meat i need dat chickn nugge
Ok, this is driving me crazy, so I have to say something. Excepting the 'burning down the rainforest' bit (which is bad), everything being described here is JUST the carbon cycle. All agriculture is. In short: CO2 is taken from the atmosphere by the plant and made into hydrocarbons (100%ish of carbon in a plant comes from CO2). Plant dies or gets eaten. Hydrocarbons are broken down into CO2 by an animal or methane by bacteria- and yes, cows (and many other animals) make methane because they have bacteria in their guts. If those plants die without an animal eating them they wind up turning to methane and CO2 anyway, and methane breaks down into CO2 and water. Of course, it takes longer and the proportions are different depending on environmental factors ect., but that's really beside the point.  The point is that ALL the carbon involved in the process comes from the atmosphere. Your WORST case scenario here is agriculture (including cows) has no effect on atmospheric carbon at all. That isn't likely, since some carbohydrates (cellulose in particular) take a very long time to break down completely unless burned. A varying proportion of the cellulose will wind up in the dirt or underground and be there for the next 100 years. So most of the time agriculture has a net REDUCTION of atmospheric carbon.  So what I got from this isn't that we shouldn't eat meat, just that we shouldn't be buying it from Brazil.
Carbon footprint aside, I refuse a vegan or vegetarian lifestyle because I'd rather contribute to the destruction of the planet than get polluted with estrogen from soy.
I just want that animal should become as conscious as human then after this I want to see that how many human even think to eat meat, we have the tendancy to oppress or kill someone who are weaker than us ,and some people still think that humans are good creature but we know the reality.
U r not a human if u eat it
Took me this long..but isn't the thumbnail cowhead is based onf Cyriak's "Moo" animation
If buying locally only had the transportation effect taken into account as the trade off, then the CO2 cost of cutting/burning forests should not have been included. If I buy locally grown beef, it did not come from a burned forest in Brazil. TBH seeing this was a pretty disappointing display of bias that is not usually present on this channel.
I feel like Kurzgesagt are constantly pushing for people to stop eating meat. And I really don’t know how to feel about it
No.
The world is just so complex !! Everything is affected by everything, who would have thought how much complicated meat can be
did u know this channel is german
Lovelly soundtrack. Great work epic mountain friends!
Id really like to see a video regarding where all the meat gose to in terms of percentages, Ive tried to find data about how much beef is used in fast food alone and how much emmissions could be spared if we cut out fast food or convert fastfood with synthetic meats.
Yup I’m sticking to my same diet after getting this information.  40% meat 30% vegetables 15% grains 15% fruit
sadly the only real way to reduce the amount of emissions from food production is to reduce the amount of people on the planet that need to be fed. but theres really no way to do that without restricting basic human rights and limiting the amount of children a family can have which again is not going to sit well, so short of migrating a portion of the population off-planet its not gonna happen.
A: Yes, it is.
A plant based diet isn’t healthy. Continue to starve yourself. I’ll stick to my red meat , fish, and greens. Meat expands life and raises IQ in third world country. The reason why we don’t see this effect in first world country is because we over consume especially with sugary and hyper caloric food. You’re spreading a very dangerous and anti-human message.
Of all science groups, Kruzgesagt.....you really believe in this "Climate Change??" LOL
There is one.....                *Beijing corn*
What if we use caravans pulled by horses to lower emissions
What about fish🤔
I like how you just grazed (no pun intended) over the massive advantage of nutrient density that beef has over almost all other foods. You also skimmed over the nutrients you can get in beef that you can't get from vegetables. You blipped the nutrients quickly on the screen and didn't even explain why. I guess your Bill and Melinda Gates and NWO supporters didn't want you actually educating us. They wanted you to drive us closer to being weak bodied and minded vegetarians.
hi
I'm sad meat is bad for the worls
0:30 ngl I want a burger now XD
Here comes That Vegan Teacher
I have never eaten any meat in my life before. After watching this I'm somewhat proud.
Make a video about exercise and it's benefits! Or something relevant
Are batteries deadly...how do we get the materials for rechargeable batteries....
I tried being vegan, couldnt do it.
How dare you put a cow in the thumbnail? You could've put a dumb goat but you put a cow this is a direct attack against Indians
Well, agriculture without livestock will simply destroy the fertile soil.
I wish the video had included the massive leaps animal farming has seen in the last 50 years. The most advanced agriculture has seen a massive drop in emissions while still increasing food yield. Honestly I think it should be more important to focus on globalization of that technology because you're never going to convince many cultures to go veg 🤷‍♀️
i would love to see another video with an economic point of view
Meat is good, it's in the Bible. The Lord said to Noah, take two of each animal. And it was good.

Vegan diet requires a lot of supliments in order to work. Cause there's no way you can consume the needed amount in veggies to be healthy. Also something like impossible burger is first of all, not healthy, way worse than meat cause it's full of shit, but also wastes a lot of energy to be produced. Raw veggies from your garden and your own grown meat. That's what we should do. How? Well cities are our problem....
Only skinned carcasses in butcher shops. However, no, I saw one at the zoo, a long time ago, in childhood. Big, ugly, evil. I got scared then.
Proud to be hindu 🕉️🧘‍♀️
Interesting to note that  at 3.01 poultry and tofu have a similar ratio of emissions to calorie and protein. Bearing in mind that poultry has a better protein profile than tofu it might be argued from an environmental point of view that poultry is preferable. Animal well fare to one side I think we should focus on curtailing climate change and human suffering before extending that courtesy to animals if it is better to keep animals in bondage to solve the first two problems.
Just eat dogs. Problem solved.
What is the name of this software used for making this video pls ?
As much as you guys might not like this... buying less meat isn't going to change the emissions they make because it's so monopolized and everyone and their mom eats meat.
I hate how these ethical dilemmas always needs me to make the decision. Should those wanting to the right thing be the ones paying? While those that have no interest in the well-being of our planet can just not care without paying anything at all. Why should the right choice be taxed, and not the wrong one?
My ex girl friend says youre wrong
Why do I keep watching this vid btw I ❤️ your vids how much work you and your team put into them! Top 5 five fave YouTubers No.2 for me
The CO2 equivalence argument is deeply flawed, as the methane produced from ruminants are part of the natural atmospheric cycle. Before the Europeans arrived in North America, there were estimates approaching 50 million bison roaming the plains.   Animals aren’t the problem. They’re necessary in ways most don’t realize. Our management of them is the crucial element.
9:50 make laugh
Why does the thumbnail keep changing? First it said meat love, then meat hate, then meat love again!
Dead soil?  Water pollution?  Carbon emissions seem only a slice of the problems regenerative farming seeks to address.  Properly done, regenerative farming uses plants and animals, just like nature.  It seems to me that either extreme - approaching plants only or approaching animals only - is not truly sustainable in the long term.  On a related note, what kind of research is there into the effects of the Haber-Bosch process (and its successors which I assume exist) on climate change?  Reducing the addition of carbon while increasing the removal of nitrogen from our atmosphere sounds like it could produce the same greenhouse gas concentrations at some point, while magnifying the effects of other gasses in the atmosphere with unforeseen (largely due to being unstudied) consequences.
I understand the carbon footprint your talking about, but I believe you a missed a few parts. The blame that is put on cow, and other modern meats for the carbon foot print is I feel over stated. For explanation, before we mass produced cattle, the were around 60 million bison, 45 million antelope, 40 million white tail deer, 10 million mule deer, 10 million elk, 2 million big hope sheep, 1 million mouse and around 1 million wolfs, and that only North America, and I couldn't find number for animals such as bears ,mountain lions, and other large animals. Not even counting the vast number of large birds such as ducks and geese, that would also be there. All the billions of creatures, would have been putting out a massive carbon footprint before humans killed off the vast majority of them and started farms and ranches, that are producing the same carbon footprint. Now I'm not saying that we're not having a impact, but the impact is from deforestation, not because the food we eat, plant based foods and growing crops account for just as much if not more Deforestation as cattle. Speaking for North America that is, place like Brazil wiping out mass areas of rain forest for cattle is leaving a massive carbon footprint, that if we changed our way today would still take decades to fix.  So the 26% carbon footprint that is from food, can really be cut down to a much smaller number.  I would like to see you account for all that in a video.
"Which is unfortunate, since food is not optional" Stalin: YES BUT ACTUALLY NO
I LOVE MEAT❤❤🍖🥩 I LOVE LEAN💜💜🥛💜
I love the art and animation❤❤
I love red meat. But I eat it sparely (once a month at most) and I choose the best quality. Not because of any moral qualms but because that's how my diet happens to be.    The whole obsession with climate change is (in my estimation) sometimes is a dumb one: the domino already has fallen and the effects are already very hard to counter (and there is no serious study that can assert, scientifically and with acceptable accuracy, that the best efforts will stop whatever the consequences that are in the horizon) .When politics intervene, the whole issue goes beyond reasonable to become the most fashionable (and even "sacred") form of pseudoscience: as an example of many, countries depriving themselves of some forms of energy (see Europe's conundrum now) only to allow other (huge) countries to mess the planet without containment.   Ecological sustainable efforts are laudable though and I encourage those. Our technology is improving so much that (as the video says) even some almost sterile lands can turn adequate for farming.    The world population is about to peak: it's not about sheer numbers but the shape of they population pyramid. And the world is (statistically) aging, even if some countries (and particularly one continent) still is relatively "young" (that is, they still have more children than old people). All in all this mean that there will be less people and less people will bring both problems (as economies are built for growth, etc.) and blessings (depopulation, less environmental stress, etc.).   The best scenario would be that of lesson for the future, whatever it is (and if we survive Nuclear Wars or whatever): stabilizing the world population at a respectable number (they played with the idea that an ideal number was reached in the 1900's at 2 billion) while enjoying a better technology and knowledge of all things ecological and biological. But that's just a utopian dream. Reality don't take sides: only applies consequences.
"food is the best part of being alive"  me, an anorexic:  -_-
"What I've Learned" channel  made a video on why eating less meat wont save the planet and is debunking your video Kurzgesagt!
Anybody else notice that the chimpanzee in the intro theme is earing a cow instead of a fruit?
U tell in very complicated way can't fully understand
From deli to belly.
So does a country like India, that does not consume beef or pork (exports it though), stand better at saving the environment than others??
I've done 3 days worth of vegetarian or vegan recipes each week. This is as far as I am willing to go.  I'm doing it for healthy intake not the environment...  I agree that if we all at the very least, cut back on our meat consumption that it will help with pollution.  And it's a very good compromise to someone being forced towards all or nothing!  I would like to see animal consumption decline enough to reduce industrial sized farms.  The idea of having local farmers, supplying all our food needs, is very attractive to me. While I know this is not good enough for the climate change dooms dayer.  I hope that it's at least appreciated to see a compromise at all... The best way would be a collaboration between these two food and environment ideologies.  Be hopeful for that someday. But the compromise is a great start.  And trying to push for zero, and fight for progress even after a compromise or collaborative set goal effort - where everyone wins at least something to be happy - that will absolutely kill all progress, and we'll see a major relapse that we may never come back from....  Being realistic, understanding, compassionate, and empathetic to your opposition goes a very long way.  I hope we get there someday.
I'd like to see a similar analysis for more than just meat.  Like cattle aren't just steaks with legs, so evaluating "output" including meat, leather, etc. and similar for the other animals Both the ideal where there is no waste, and the reality where I'm sure there is
We need less humans.
I feel like the topic of changing DNA is not often brought up. I have no knowledge about the topic but isn't making cows more eco friendly by changing their DNA possible?
I tried to make this study myself and I am surprised that I arrived at similar numbers and conclusions reported in  this video. I assume that we used similar sources. When I was seeing emissions reported per kg In some random article I was just mad. Another thing is that veggies contribute way more to food waste compared to meat and this levels out even more, although veggies still wins over beef meat…this agrees with the old thermodynamic principle of “no free lunch”, which particularly suits this situation.
vegan isnt healfy
This video is so biased towards a vegan diet it isn't even funny...
so meat is the best worst thing in this world
Very disappointing for a video that claimed the issue is complicated. No mention at all about regenerative agriculture or rotational grazing. Also almost half of livestock feed is made of crop residues and by-products that are not edible by humans, so if we got rid of livestock those residues would need to be burned or left to rot. The comparison made on nutrient density is also off, it was a net comparison on how many nutrients are present in food, but it doesn't take into account that although plants may have nutrients, it is very hard for our bodies to extract those nutrients. You will poop out most of the nutrients in plants, whilst your body is able to absorb pretty much everything in meat. Meat is a superior food by far, but this is not recognized because the dominant narrative has become so biased against it. There are also essential nutrients we can only get from meat. And where will we get our "organic fertilizers" if we got rid of livestock too? This felt like the common propaganda that is already common out there, not a real investigation or nuanced view.
Something that was not covered here is the sequestered carbon from regenerative agriculture with grass-fed ruminants. Although it may not be a huge portion it's certainly important to mention with this topic as well as an important calculation to offset some of the beef emissions from factory beef/ruminants.
Not eating much beef myself, but I lots and lots and lots of chicken and that wont ever stop, thats my personal decision on this topic! But I like vegan food its tasty!
I think the best and safe meat are chicken and fish .
Why didn't you address who much water each diet (meat, vegetarian, vegan) uses????? Wtf?
Serious question: What happens if we stop "farming" cows? Do we let them all go free into the wild where they still produce the same amount of methane, possibly more as they breed unrestricted and populate without us cutting their population? That doesn't seem to solve anything, just make it worse (unless there's something I'm missing there). Or do we go the other route and just wipe out the species for the sake of global warming (which now brings up other ethical issues)?
I had five guys yday v nice
meat hate image - meat love image
Excellent video. And, on top of all the other reasons discussed regarding meat's environmental footprint, let's also acknowledge the suffering meted out to animals on account of this diet.
Still an interesting video but I was kinda hoping they would talk a bit more about the morality of eating meat not just it's environmental impact
Video Suggestion: A video on insect diets, and what would happen if it became culturally popular to eat and produce insects in the west
You can say you wanna be a vegan or vegetarian because it’s cruel to eat animals or just wanna be healthier or whatever. But u say it’s good for environment? Come on ….
Is meat really that bad? This is a type of vegan questions     This is not a insult btw
Even though I love kurzgesagt, ima gonna have to stick with my beef and chicken as it just tastes so good, while tofu and substitutes just don’t cut it. Also the cheese and milk just can be beat, same with eggs in the morning
maybe we wouldn't need such an astronomical amount of meat if we weren't trying to sustain 7.5 billion people?
Im going full carnivore one day
Anyone who tells you you need to stop eating meat to battle “climate change” is not somebody you should trust about anything. “Climate change” is pure hysteria meant to gain people power over you. Even if it’s not, there are realistic solutions, none of them are championed by climate change alarmists.
I would have liked it if you had looked at meat production issue with more than just the Climate Change angle. Ethics is sadly a rare topic when it comes to farming and food consumption.
I love 🍖 and your animation
Maybe you should talk about how the effects of being vegan can impact the body and how not everyone can do it because either way, we'll all still need crops to eat so all of that land for "trees and other plant life that consume Carbon dioxide from the air, won't actually be plausible because we will still need that land to grow crops to sustain our own population of people. please make a video that covers ALL the facts about BOTH sides here if you wish to call your stuff "informational" and not biased towards one side. Thanks
Growing plants can cost us a huge amount of water and more land space💧 however the cow drinks water and it goes back to the earth as urine and makes the place fertile. Also, cows can eat the agricultural leftover cause they can digest fiber more than any livestock   This weather it's animal or plant base its gonna hurt affect the environment
Beef stoonks
It's also important to know that cows and farm animals are prey. They wouldn't exist in such large numbers if we weren't factory-farming them, so there would be way less methane. That plus the new land for forests would help so much.
There’s a few ambiguous data points that are pretty important are clarified. For crop and soy how are those percentages determined? Is that number based on weight of product to include crop residue as well? I looked through the sources but did not find a definite answer, there was mention of usage for the soy bean regarding feed cake and oils however in my understanding that was specifically for the beans used to produce oils, additionally the sources did mention protein quality, however adjusted numbers to account for nutrition vs carbon was not stated, only metrics simply based on caloric content which is problematic in a pragmatic sense towards what would the numbers need to look like to feed everyone healthily. I cannot say that a vegetarian or vegan diet wouldn’t still be better for the environment however I believe more complex metrics and quantitative data are required. While I am not disagreeing with the overall skew on the points of the topic covered, I do not feel as if enough questions and details were covered in this video.
Every time the idea of climate change comes up and the causes of it I get the impression that it simply isn't possible to be eco-friendly ENOUGH. When it comes to solutions, there just doesn't seem to be any reasonable and feasible options that nations today would actually agree to enforce. So it makes me feel like this - defeated. Might as well enjoy life as it is now because the future is so FUBAR'd that it is already game over, essentially.
it would be kool to see this updated to include the new trend of "factory meat" that is grown in labs rather than from livestock. Would this alternative have a better carbon footprint, or worse?
Vegan diet just to SAVE some co2 emissions? It wouldve made more sense if veganism reverses co2 emissions.   Good food is the key to happiness, but if Id have to sacrifice that just for some CO2, then we must try the easy alternative route.  Nothing saves more CO2 emmissions than a nuclear war, imagine the positive impacts on the climate and mother nature.
First of all, congratulations on the excellent and "non-preachy" approach to this video. However, in regard to methane production, I have a question - Wouldn't the increase in consumption of veggies also increase the production of methane gas by humans?
Speaking from a health perspective. I’d eat more plant based food if it didn’t taste so horrible.
And the spanish sub?
Ever notice that if you eat only meat for a few days, your farts stop stinking ? Ever wonder why ?    While humans are indeed omnivores, their GI system is most efficient at digesting meat.  If you simply must have stinky farts, just add some veggies back into you diet, and the stink will return ...
So... I should stop eating beef? Alright.. I prefer chicken anyways
They lit the fucking ocean on fire. We are so fucked, and you want me to spend the last days that we have here on earth eating tofu? Not a chance.
Thumbnail 1: meat love Thumbnail 2: meat hate Thumbnail 3: meat love
love how you did not give any subjective opinion and instead let people decide for themselves what they will do with the information. Thanks for being such a great channel and always keep things opinion free and simple!
Please Kurzgesagt make a video about the boltzmann brain, is such an interesting mind bending topic
While I agree that meat is less than optimal for the environment, it's worth noting that there's a lot of people (including me) who can't survive on a vegan diet due to being allergic to protein-containing plants like soy and peanuts.
So every time I eat a steak I’m removing a cow and thus it’s methane. Happy to help.
My meat isnt too bad.

Video request-WHAT HAPENS WEN YOU DIE
In the beginning of the video you said 26% of Greenhouse Gas Emissions comes form ALL FOOD production. Then you spend half of the video talking about emissions from MEAT production. And you haven't mentioned how much of the CO2 emission that can actually be recycled, since CO2 can be taken in by plants as well. You use numbers like a smokescreen.
What happened with subtitles in Spanish?
This video was very informative, and I would also love to see not only the CO2 emissions but also the impacts of water usage in agriculture, plastic waste, and as somebody else said, the impacts of fish    I would also like to know the effects that would come if we started feeding more humans instead of cows. Could we save a world hunger then?
the problem is we need 'animal' so we have to manage it. Cows, humans, plants with decay are carbon neutral. But there are many wrong developments. We need animal products, especially pregnant women, breastfeeding women, children, the sick, hard workers, men, women, old, young ..  I am German. In Germany there is another way of thinking about vegan. We, a friend of mine and me, found an important point, which causes problems with vegan diets.. Here  the reason why humans need animal products.. it is because of cholesterol.  We need a little amount of cholesterol in our nutrition. It is like this:  Great apes, all eat kinds of animals. Chimps are hunting. Cognition had something to do with nutrients.. Chimps are the best, compared to us, in cognition.  In breastmilk is cholesterol. In each  mammalian milk. Great apes feed their offspring with milk for a long time, orang utan until 8 years, until they are grown up..?   Plants are lowering cholesterol in different ways. Some plant ingredients are like statins. ( Tocotrienoles, sulfides, isoflavones, phytos t a n o l s)  Every kind of fiber lower cholesterol. Fiber absorbs it. Lignin very much.  Phytosterins compete with the cholesterol molecule for reabsorption, so phytosterins lower it to.  Other plants ingredients work like phytosterins and lower cholesterol.. beta glucan, mycosterins.   Statins harm healthy people. Low cholesterol, means lack of cholesterol, this harms in multiple ways: .. low bile acids, poor fat digestion .. low vitamin D, poor immune system, poor calcium storage, other deficiencies due to interactions .. damages in the brain and nerv tracts .. low hormones.. fertility?  .. damages in cell membranes, chance permeability of membranes, damages in organelles membran.. increasing .. low Q10 enzyme, Q10 is an intermediate product in cholesterol synthesis, low energie.   Not only the lack of cholesterol harms, in addition, the enrichment of the precursors, which are not further converted, is harmful. This connection is known from the studies on SLO. Smith-Lemli-Opitz-Syndrome.  SLO shows that nobody can seriously say, which damage exactly will be caused by what cholesterol level. Thats a truth, we have to accept.   And people with very high cholesterol levels are well advised to eat vegan until their levels drop.  But this diet includes also watch out for saturated fats, types of sugar, little fruit, little white flour to lower triglycerides if they are high.  And some people, with a genetical disease, are very good in vegan if the eat perfectly all the necessary nutrients for humans.  According to my source, there is 1 in 500 people with this genetic makeup.  .. What do you think?  Ive forgot  to mention oxidized cholesterol. The real problem for our vessels is the oxidized LDL-cholesterol. It can no longer be absorbed by cell receptors. One can't get it by lowering one's cholesterol either.  Phytosterols also oxidize, same problem...  We are not scientists, just pioneers in thinking and have brought the different sides together.
just go to space bruh  make earth ur home not ur garage while make make the whole solar system ur workplace. Done simple!!! Environment climate change controlled. GG
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day"   You underestimate me
It's important to remember that while cows feeding on land that can't be used for producing other types of food IS efficient purely from the perspective of producing food, they STILL produce a lot of methane. And, bottom line, a lot of cows means a lot of methane very efficiently produced.
If this does not screams overpopulation, i dont know what does. The solution is in front of us, 7+B humans is not sustainable.
putin go home, ok.. wrong movie (am german)
Calories is useless because plants don't give humans every nutrient they need, meat does.
I heard methane as beefthane and I was balling with laughter.
Did the Meat Hate video get taken down??
Full of lies.
We could always light candels on cow butts to convert methan to co2 wich is not that bad for the environment. ;)

Why there is no Spanish subtitles?
The only thing you missed out is mentioning that all protein is not the same. Animal protein is different to veggies. Big difference between 20g of beef protein or 20g of bean protein.
Great video but I can't stop eating non-veg food , although I would try to reduce it after this
I don't believe the hype about the "cow-farts". Have you seen what, at this verymoment, five active volcanoes create?
I love vegetables as much as I like meat, idk what to say
Put butt plugs in every single beef cow. Problem solved
and fishing?
On minute 9 onward the image for 2 billion hectares and 3 billion hectares if I understood correctly is misleading. It gives the idea that with vegan dient we have much less land to use for reducing or carbon print.
So, just switching from beef to pork/chicken is enough of an impact. Because getting rid of all meat is going to result in a lot of very, very aggravated unhappy people. Which means war. Oh yes, people absolutely WILL go to war for food. And the environmental impact of even just one battle is MUCH worse than any other industry we know. As for beef --- Give our engineers a raise and make them find out ways to make use of methane as fuel. If the stake at hand is whether they'd be able to have steaks in their hands, oh trust me, they'll work their butt off and we'd witness miracles.
So is it sustainable or even possible to exist without meat production? How much soy beans would we need if it should substitute for meat? How much CO2 would it take to produce crops and veggies for everyone without animal based fertilizers? Also we don't only eat meat, we use other stuff from animals too, for medicine, technology, chemistry... Is it really possible to not to? If the biggest problem of animals are farts from eating veggie, wouldn't all humans fart more because of it so the problem would remain the same? So far I got into feeling that all the creatures on Earth are producing CO2 and all I get from "stop eating meat" topic is that we must reduce population of other species  to make more space for human race, which somehow doesn't sound right to me.
nice
Yes, it is very bad, in so many different ways. For the planet, for your body and for the collective ego, because it says humans don't care about committing acts of violence if it gives them seconds of sensorial pleasure, it's completely absurd. Science says we don't need meat to thrive.
Please help  Here i go: since i remember eating i always hated vegetables for some reason whenever i eat one my stomach refuses to digest it and i just vomit it out and this makes me scared so much so i don't eat vegetables please help me
オッツー
Kurzgesagt, That Vegan Teacher Is GOING AFTER YOU!
Damnit, you guys are making me adjust my opinions because of data I wasn’t aware of. Thank you, but I’m still upset.
Always enjoy your videos - I become much more educated and I feel like I can add more information with these kind of discussions due to your videos!
I love so much that Kurzgesagt is concious in choosing their video titles.  Their goal isn't to attract vegans and repeat the talking points they use.
i like how kurzgesagt uses memes to represent the script, so creative, literally!
Did no one notice the change in thumbnail?
You forgot about "protein quality" and "protein absorption". 1kg of beef protein is far higher quality and much more efficient to absorb  than say, tofu. Plus cow eats wasted food and reduce methane from that source.
I saw this video at school a few days ago
Why are emmisions so bad? Do they really hurt us that bad?
What about fish?
y
And people would still call vegans and vegetarians idiots or people who do it for the sake of attention or whatever stupid reason they can put on anyone but themselves, eating meat is bad and that’s it there’s no other truth to it and we definitely have to something about it, I would gladly eat the same food everyday forever if it helps us have a better world why can’t everyone else even to a lesser extent do this? Weak meat eaters
tl;dr if you want to eat meat and think about cllimate at the same time, you need to be cruel to cows. We're fucked guys
The o ly thing that wasn't mentioned in this video (and the only reason  why I still eat meat) is that: we cannot live without meat, simply that.  You will never found an article that shows that veganism is healthy without supplements, for instance. The most affordable diet is a diet that uses meat and even when you have a balanced vegan diet, where you eat all kinds of plants, you will have to supplement vitamin B 12 that is only found in meat and the lack of it is associated with dementia.  Its deplorable that we still can't figure out a better way to raise animals for consumption, but we can't live without it, simply.
7:11 KURGESAGT DREW GER FROM MONGOLIA WHERE I LIVE
What if we could create a cow with no intelligence the problem is that the least happy animals are most efficient and dont waste energy but its wrong because they are so intelligent that they suffer way too much but if we created a cow with the intelligence of a earthworm it wouldnt matter that much
Antscanada: Ant love forever Kurzgesagt: Meat love forever
Meat is fine, but ranchers are assholes. Bring back the bison
Kurzgesagt do you know what you have done you have made a war with vegans  RUN BEFORE THEY MAKE IT TO THE COMMENT SECTION
So hear me out. We start eating Wild beavers. They won’t eat more trees and we won’t farm them cause we Hunt the Wild ones
Hindus/Jews: *Ya know, I'm something of an environmentalist myself*
5:44 WHO SAID THAT CHU
There's an evident solution. Illegalize selling meat. No more problem. You can still produce and consume your own meat (for people that are unwilling to stop, and medicinal use for the very very few people who need meat to survive). Why we still consume meat is something that astonishes me everyday. It's literally destroying the world.
I thought you were going to answer the question "Is Meat Really that Bad?" as if it's bad for our organisms. Not talking about global warming. Who cares about it, we're all going to die anyway. Nothing lives forever, and everything goes extinct at some point, whether we tried to save the planet or not.
Look, mark rober made a video about meat made from vegetables, it works flawlessly, and there are companies making it for a living, check it out bois
All i can add, that this video forgot to mention is Biodigesters, wich use Methane, when i was in Vet school our university had one of those, since the main economy in the sorrounding areas is Dairy products. It basically consists in using methane to produce energy therefore lowering the emission to the atmosphere and making it a more eco-friendly way of meat producing, since i work mainly with small animals i don't really have the full knowledge of them, and it has been 13 years since i was in college, so i don't remembre much of how it works really. there is still a long way to go in that topic, but every 10,000 steps trail starts with one. Anyways an amazing video.
the cow animations are so cute
Well, I'll be vegan when adult.
요약: 육식은 환경오염에 영향을 많이 준다. 채식도 환경오염을 야기하지만 육식에 비할바가 못된다. 이 모든 근거들을 듣고 어찌 행동할지는 당신 자유다.
To prove the point of the intro, I read the title and actively avoided watching for this long cuz I wasn't ready for these truths lol
Well said, kurg ❤️🩸
propaganda.
For you who is wondering what this video's trying to tell you:  9:32 We could reduced about *16%* of CO2 released to the atmosphere per year, if we annihilate all farm cows altogether and then all population of the world, literally 7.7 billion human, stop eating meat starting from now. Which is pretty impossible. This video is not a propaganda. It's just to show you some facts that you shouldn't focus too much on meaningless things
Summary: Go Vegan
Come on guys, all we gotta do is to just not eat beef. There's so much other tasty things to eat other than beef!
Something I should point out should anyone care to read this...  Poultry and pigs do not exclusively eat feed crops. They're all foragers who will get whatever they can from the land.  With appropriate stocking density in a leader follower system, Pigs, Poultry, Cattle and Sheep (and perhaps goats, if you include a healthy shrub layer into the treelines, but make sure the sheep are infront of the goats {ideally with poultry between} to protect the sheep from parasites. The goats eat high, so long as they have enough food they should be safe) can all graze the exact same silvopastural system with a huge net increase in overall animal carrying capacity (though the number of animals of each species will go down.)  How do the pigs and geese fatten? That's what the tree layer in the Silvo (meaning forest) layer is for. You load the treelines on each side of each pasture with nut trees that produce through the autumn, culminating in the natural temperate pork harvest period around November-Decemer.  This also tempers the video's obsession with cattle methane by diversifying the meat products.
lab grown meat: am i a joke to you?
kurzgesagt uses meme?!?!?!?!??!? I'm so proud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if  animals dont want to get eaten the nwhy do they taste so good
To me: ban lamb, cows, and similar stuff and go everything in pork and chicken
I am 100% supportive of the ending of eating all meat, but what a lot of people don't think about is how many jobs that would effect. If we ended all cattle, pig, poultry, etc. that would put a lot of the farmers out of business. Just a thought.
This video must be something everyone can agree on because it has no dislikes.
In modern world? Yes it is. If you eat a lot. I eat max twice per week meat , i know people who eat   it everyday .
Watch: why eating meat won't save the world. This guy is leaving out essential details.
Can you do one of these about holistic planned grazing and how that effects the environment?
Hey so when the americans almost wiped out the bison population they were just doing it for the environment x)
A thousand years ago there where more wild bovine roaming north america northern europe and africa millions more than there are now by a long way. The climate was fine. Human caused climate change is a lie.
My question is whether plant-based diets would be better if farming were impossible thanks to increased emissions. It would make it more expensive to eat overall and it would possibly bankrupt some world governments to produce food on the same scale as we do now, which could mean that many people die as a result of banning farming since they would not be able to afford the food that is in greater demand, but in shorter supply.
thats a nice detail changing the thumbnail for valentines
spoiler: yes
"you can decide for yourself what to do with this information" aka become vegan, since we told you all the pros of that decision. Straight up propaganda. Meat is still tasty, so i don't care.
I am curious, what is the carbon footprint of a beyond meet burger compared to a regular one?
Cartoon propaganda that’s completely false
we eat them, they dont eat us. very simple rules
I'm anemic a meat is a must or else *faints
Libs🤣
video aside. whats with that dude wearing cow suit over and over again?
I just stopped eating meat every single day, you don't need to eat vegan or vegetarian just one meatless day is already better than no change at all.
7:12 Oh yes Mongolia again (weird country that have worse air) Asia
I guess I’m living off of fish now
Watching this while eating Chicken Fingers. Yum
No, im going to eat beef
Mmm Idk, ima carnivore. Gives me energy. Leaves don't do that
Killing sentient animals is not good, it's very complicated
Except crops actually absorb more carbon than forests. Forests are just better for biodiversity.
Meat diet all the way BAYBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEH
the new thumbnail sucks.
The best reason for veganism is not saving the fucking environment, its stopping the torture we inflict on the animals involved in the industry. There is no stopping climate change; this planet is doomed, fortunately.
If we could regenerate mammoth steppe ecosystem I wonder how much that can be used to feed humans and what reduction of CO2 emissions that van provide.
Let's try to eat less meat and more vegetables we can eat 40% meat and 60% vegetables if you can't leave meat unless you have some nutritious problems
Look up what meat does to your endothhelial cells in your circulation system linings.Eating no meat repairs them over time.Meat and cancer links in U.S. diet compared to China, and other countries with no fast food eating.T.Colin Cambell videos and research.
Why not genetically modify cow so their gas are even heavier than methane, we could get a solution
My take away from this video is that all of us will probably need to go vegan in order to decrease CO2 emissions by an effective margin
I really want to know if growing meat in vats would solve anything. That way, we'd be able to eat delicious, real meat, without the harmful effects of feeding or containing or killing large numbers of animals. I know it's possible, and it's being done, but I want to see it catch on! I would buy it exclusively if I knew where to find it.
Beaf meat lovers:Is eating meat bad? Internet:Gives an endless amount of informations about it being bad* Beat lovers:.....i don't like this,so i will just assume you missed a fact somewhere and stay in denial!
Now I´m hungry...  Time to get some hamburgers...
i just realized in every intro the monkey holds something related to whatever the video is
I've tried going vegan a couple times in the past, but it is just so hard to leave meat behind :(
Bring on the Vat Beef!
To me, expressing this from the left viewpoint, shows the bias of the article.  No matter how you make comments, it will show your bias.  Even eating nothing but vegan food is not good for a person.   Anything in excess is bad.  You can't define the line on excess. Having sex causes cancer.   Doing anything causes us to get closer to death.  Nothing you can do to live healthy.  NOTHING........
Imangine if the Vegan teacher watched this
Well all this info just fell out my head cus am eating a nice steak right now.
tl;dr version: Yes.
we have beyond meat now
Some of these videos are interesting others seem to have little research done and leave out other facts. Half truths are the worlds new currency so not much to do....
Don’t care
Eat less meat, witless pricks
"You can decide for yourself what to do with this information" cynical and pretentious as always.
I wish this channel would dive deeper into climate change alarmism. Just by studying greenhouse gas emissions that occur naturally when volcanic eruptions happen compared to manmade ones will open your eyes.
Honestly I was a little underwhelmed by this. This wasn't a discussion about meat, it was exclusively about beef. Barely a mention of things like chicken, nor explaining consequences of animals raised for other purposes, like eggs, wool or cheese (not just cow, but goat for inatance). Would hope to perhaps see a video that goes a little further in exploring the implications of these.
No it isn't, it's why we're omnivores. The only reason 'they' are trying to brainwash you into thinking meat is bad is so that you all eat their over processed, chemically changed plants and other crap that they have a ton of, it's easier to feed the masses with cheap chemicals than it is raising animals for slaughter, plus the added bonus is you all get sick and buy more chemicals to try and 'fix' yourselves. In the future, the 'normal' people will be eating insects and plants and dying early whilst the rich eat veal and caviar.
But when the plant food is delivered on a ship it still is going by a car so its not different to a meat
And with this video, I shall now enjoy my McDonald's double quarter pounder with cheese. :)
Nice try, I'll never stop eating locally-sourced grass-grazed beef.
You aren't living if you aren't even eating proper good food aka meats.
8:12 When we think about it, almost 100kg of meat per year means like a piece of meat for 2 or 3 meal each day...  So would it be THAT crazy to enjoy 100g meat just once a day to reduce by 2/3 our consommation ? Well if that's only include red meat then it wouldn't be that difficult at all.  Keeping telling people to become vegan will never work on much people, but becoming at least half-vegetarian is quickly reachable for everyone.  Meat is not bad, it's a luxury.
About CO2 emissions: By even watching this you are contributing it.  For instance, travelling by air couple of times a year is equivalent of whole year meat consumption. Also, when it comes to food, you also have to consider the CO2 produced for each processed vegan product, which seems like ignored.  In short, move to Alaska and stay the fuck where you are to contribute CO2 initiative, rather than chunking those processed food.
Meat is murder. That’s all.
10:24 really? How does something like that go right past the eyes of the editors?
It angers me that people thinks saving the earth is as easy as no longer eating meat and ignore water pollution. We are literally running out of drinkable water due to pollution and stopping eating meat WON'T solve the problem.
Hearing that we will use our entire carbon budget on food alone by 2100 hit me hard… We’re doomed.
Great, but meat just too good to refuse
I love eating meat
ae old thumbnail is back bois
I love food but I wish we didn’t need it. At some point, everything we eat was a living thing.
Food isn’t the only pleasure that you can receive multiple times a day
The final straw for becoming veggie for me, was the raw maths of it all. The amount of crops needed to feed livestock that produce waaaaaay less of a food yield than if we had just grown edible crops in the first place instead.
Dude you still talking about meat ? Dude are you still learning or you just feeding us lies ? Huamn population keep growing so for sure we will consume more and keep in mind these farts will return to the earth if we didn’t cut the trees that rescued co2 so it’s a close chain AKA the cows doesn’t introduce new co2 to the environment so ? You should be focus on burning oil because this introducte new co2 to the environment 😒 really man I will not watch your channel again
I only eat beef four days a week. I don’t think I can cut back any further.
MEAT LOVE!!!!!!!
Worst Meat 71 Kg, Worst Vegie 3.5 Kg. Therefore Meat worse, this is very deceptive. Logically you can see that Beef is higher, but no where do they show that Vegtables are produced at magnitudes higher per pound. The Same Transport has to be done local by both vegetables and meat. Imported Food just have the ADDITIONAL cost of transport, also cost per distance not factoring in that the longer the journey the more food that don't make it and thrown out, which effectively would increase the C02 per lb fairly significantly. Also larger countries like USA and Canada or inland countries need the extra transport cost from the port to the inland States and provinces. Saying that Farts would have anymore then the species that they replaced by land cost is incredibly silly.  Especially when saying that transport costs are a non starter. Believe what you want, but things were missed. Sure more then this was missed as well. But even if this was completely accurate, least this would only effect City slickers for the most part, growing up on a farm and around farmers, never met a single vegan / vegetarian farmer.
It'd be interesting to know how much freeing up of land there'd be, if we all went vegetarian or vegan, given that we have to get those calories from somewhere, so we'd need to plant many more food crops to offset the meat currently eaten. It'd also be interesting to know the lifecycle of the carbon and hydrogen atoms bonded in the methane, and how these atoms would effect the climate assuming they were retaied as water and CO2.
The takeaway? How should you chose to use this information?  You should chose to develop carbon sequestration technology.
Go vegan
7;22 Bullsheet
7:22 Bullshit
I mostly stopped eating beef 8 months ago when i moved into a small town to do my medical internship. Beef was really expensive in the local market and i couldn’t afford it. After watching this  i think i’ll just quit beef, lamb and pork for good and stick to fish and poultry a couple times a week for essential amino acids and vitamins. Beef just doesn’t feel worthwhile after learning the environmental cost
Meet bad for childrens steands up for the vagan tacher
Que absurdo. Os americanos distorcem a realidade das áreas preservadas no Brasil. SÃO  ENORMES. As aéreas “preservadas”  no EUA são DESERTOS.
No other bodily pleasure can be enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old.    Coomers:  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
It's one thing to become informed through these types of videos, it's another thing to heed the wise advice and make meaningful changes in your life.  For the benefit of your health and the survival of our planet & species, 2022 is the time to Go Vegan.
On a mostly meat diet right now, though I treat beef as more of a treat meat only eaten on rare occasion. Mostly, I do bird and pig meat at about 80/20. Mushroom and diet friendly veg soups for snacks. Would be absolutely fine seeing beef production go down through the purely grass fed way.
I think that financially, a vegan diet is just not really an option for people with lower incomes. anything that has the word vegan or organic on it is so much more expensive than the regular foods that it stops people from buying it. if we made vegan food more accessible, I'm sure a lot more people would be willing to try it
I stopped eating meat 5 years ago, and after a while the idea of it becomes repulsive, what I used to consider “delicious” I now wouldn’t eat if you paid me  The point being that perspectives and opinions can change  Going plant-based is one of the best decisions I have made for myself and if you told me 10 years ago that I would stop eating meat I would’ve laughed you out the room  Most of (if not nearly all) my friends, family and people I know eat meat, I don’t tell them what to eat, I still like and respect them as always, I encourage we show decency and respect towards others
but what about the other 74% food consumption alone isn't the thing that's driving Earth to global warming. if they want to talk about the issue they should talk about the whole thing
The thumbnail changed again
Still mankind will invent something that purify the air.....sooner or later this gonna be overcome....
Hey, the thumbnail changed back again!
P.S. you misspelled tones, you accidently wrote tonnes on your vid.
We need an alternative for beef burgers, and we should treat beef as a luxury item. More chicken sandwiches instead.  Or we just have less people. We are kind of a problem
I love your videos so much! They feel unbiased and well-researched and the animation is great. I got the 12,022 calendar, I love it so much 🦕❤️ On this topic, what I have gone back and forth with myself is the health of the biosphere and health of humans. I want to make environment-conscious decisions on my food consumption but I don’t know a lot about what is healthy for the human body. Not having a healthy biosphere means lower quality of life for humans, that’s the whole point of ecological conservation, so I get in the grand scheme of things that it’s super important to tackle this meat production issue or else we’ll cause a lot more suffering from climate change in the future. But, for instance, being vegan for a long time can lead to the development of dental issues and certain vitamin deficiencies. Yet it helps prevent/ cure (?) diabetes and cholesterol-related diseases, etc. Obviously there’s health risks and benefits to eating a lot meat as well…so is it worth cutting out meat completely from our diets and then having the associated health risks? Is there even a real risk as long as people take supplements? Is eating meat once a month a good balance of bodily necessities and being environmentally-friendly? Is hunting a good, sustainable alternative for people who wish to keep meat in their diets? I have many questions!
The sad part is that millions of people will watch this and completely ignore it
send this to that vegan teacher
70 billion cows are being captured for milk, mik in asia has gotten under the price of water leading to milk-supporting and expanding the milk industry. The cows are treated so poorly that the milk isnt even healthy anymore. Cows get forcibelly impregnanted, adn when the baby is born, its stolen from the mother to get the milk production going. all the industry animals are treted this way before put to death, so every animal that has ever existed instead of the 6% of the freeland animals. THE HOLOCAUST HAS NOT ENDED   sorry for my english
I had to eat a steak after this. LOL
Lab-grown beef
You covered only a few out of dozens of factors to consider when measuring climate change.  Worst video yet?
I only really have beef when I eat burgers and I tried a vegan burger once but it tasted horrible. If some really good vegan burger is made, I might switch over to vegan burgers.
i cant believe the best ecological solution came from Mad max from 1985 animals are raised underground  the methane gas gets used as fuel for cars
If people could buy a liter of a peaceful opioide drink to go to sleep forever at a local health food store we wouldn't have to still be here, and 45 percent of the world would take a drink and say thanks instead of people going a virus or vacks does it to whoever, probably the half that actually want to be here will die or get ill health. With aerosol vsrus weapon/trojan horse vacks you might not have a military in six months or two years  Imagine a different world where everyone who didn't want to exist didn't have to be here. 1/3 of the world starving to death, so a grandmother with a broken back can only get food as comfort until she dies of pain, so a malnourished child will wind up with the same thing deficiency and wine up like her grandmother too. 5 prevent of the world are terminally ill, another 5 percent need bionic body parts they can't or don't want to get, another 5 percent need an organ replaced they can't or don't want to get replaced. Another 5 percent live in chronic pain. Another 5-10 percent never wanted to be born anyway. You can kill an unborn or partially delivered child but you're sick and need help if you want to leave the planet yourself. Legalize a peaceful opioide euthanasia drink and 50-60 percent of the world will be fine through compassion, the 50-60 percent that doesn't want to be here, not like avrus blindly killing whoever does and only taking it a 1 percent. Dumbp C0VID for agn d twenty 1, half of the world was supposed to be gone by 2030, their goal should be compassion and it will surpass all goals. You could grow food and a peaceful poppy with indoor farming for the whole world, imagine a world full of people, about half, who actually want to be here.  We live in a world where abortion is legal but not euthnasia. You have a right to kill but not to exit life when you want, how you want. You don't have a right to live not a right to die. No one chooses to be born, and there is no peaceful pill that puts you to sleep forever. We're overpopulated because it is financially beneficial for someone to have a child then take half of everything, then 60 percent of a paycheck, then if the next guy doesn't do it for then anymore they get another 20-32 percent. I knew a guy who told me "I love my daughter but she's a professional con artist, she had kids with three guys and is making almost six figures off of coke support and took half of their assets"  No matter what kind of life one had, in the thrall of death, and I've been there more than once, it doesn't matter and you wish you never had been. The only way to go in my opinion is a peaceful opioide drink and go to sleep. Never try to go with a stimulant or pills that might just make you puke and you'll think it was bleach in there. Death is there one thing in life that'll get you at the end, from being born in the hunting grounds of dinosaurs and snakes or a nice mansion, if you don't make sure it's nice for you at the end you'll probably wish more than anything at that moment that you had spent't your life better making sure you did and didn't fall yourself at the end, cruel and unthoughtful... Those who do not legislate to make it available to others will probably not have it for themselves either  In life do one think well, die right. You'll be thankful you forgot and slipped into the best sleep of your life. You could be eaten alive by a dinosaur on this planet, was a wonderful dream I had last night, felt great too, they were hatched and fell from the sky.  Let your hard work and good luck surviving on this planet get you a peaceful rest at the end, you owe it to yourself  Before electricity was sent through power lines it was never dumped into the ground through 8' electrodes energizing ground water at every home and business.  Storm clouds of higher charge send heat lightening and charge of higher electron charge move to clouds of lower electron charge to stabilize the electron balance in the atmosphere. We're energizing ground water tables with positive electron charge and telling storms not to come here, and with electron to magnetic earth ground charge a low depression stir where h20 reaches ground and which replenishes water like it should rarely happens, so it just evaps off, that's why lightening is more likely to hit the lone farm house rather than the neighborhood. With a fourth insulated conductor taking the returning current from each homes neutral bar back to the grid to power extra street lamps, etc, instead of energizing ground water tables which is a conductor, maybe we'll get more rainfall  It costs the same to print welfare as it does US Currency, for the cost of bringing in people from another country and giving then citizenship, when we're already out of jobs, even with people sitting on degrees and college debt working at retail stores and looking for other jobs, with skilled trade wages maintaining what they paid before gas more than doubled and everything went up) why don't we pay people to go to other countries and build indoor farming, from fish to every kind of crop, so everywhere is a good home with food and jobs. And with more jobs everywhere, everyone will have more for each other and dollars will go further everywhere. All the kids playing on dad's monopoly game will have a fun life and get back to serving one another. One kid will sell ice cream cones again because the other one is hired to paint houses, so he hires someone else to work on theirs, and people can build boats and people can go on boat rides again, with more people working more people can actually get a paid vacation and start saving for retirement (I'll take a retirement pll), but with everything shut down, it's a game of who wants to buy it all up for paper when it floods and collapses  Grow too much food so when the food truck is empty, it takes back the extra food with blemishes for fertilzer on indoor crops where there's no need for pestcde as there no bugs indoors, you can grow any crop with with above  or below ground (mirrored clay wall) vertical farms, magnifying glass panels at ground level, solar 24/7/365 growing seasons, indoor fresh water fish farms, indoor whaling, grow grass and put cows and chickens on it all year round (won't even stink up a metropolitan city in a high rise) plant dirt and grass and cows where torn down factories left concrete waste slabs) in a building grass can be grown in many floor to ceiling returnable plats on a conveyer, that's takes it up to the dairy floors for food where the cows eat it at 3' above the floor, the floor has a squeegee system and the cows are herded from one half of the floor to the other for cleaning: an automated squeege cleans the floor and empties it into a special for drain: the cow manure goes back down in a pipe for fertilizer : ) the floor has a floor washer, like a car wash, but with clean spayed water on the floor and a squeegee system : ) So good   Salt water can be separated with oxygen being released like a rain forest to the outside air while the electricity generated disinfects waste water as it makes energy (NASA does this to make cabin oxygen while it releases everything else to space) Everyone uses a small steam distiller to disinfect and remove salt at the sink for drinking and cooking, everyone gets soft water to their house from the ocean, (already has natural salt in it) drag pipelines to every continent, more jobs, and divert river system maybe to deserts to take sea water rise from melting ice caps and maybe restock what used to be an ocean, natural sand filter at least, just don't put sharks in there and you can surf : )   NASA uses electrolysis to make cabin oxygen from water and they release the hydrogen gas to outer space, you could use the h as clean energy and release the oxygen to the planet as a rain forest (the problem is carbon likes to bond to oxygen, we need more oxygen sunlight in the atmosphere busts CO2 up into noxious o1 ozone, plants with electric photosynthesis separate the carbon and release the o2 again.). drag ocean soft water to municipalities, they use a small steam distiller at the sink for drinking water, everyone's off toilet to tap, and you use electrolysis to disinfect the waste water and make energy. You split the ocean stream for indoor fresh water and salt water fish farming. You build or convert 40 story buildings for indoor farming. Every acre under roof is an 80-120 acre farm, but instead of 12 hours of light, there's solar glass panels and you have 24 hours of light, 12 months of growing instead of 6, so maybe an 80 acre indoors is like 320. You grow too much food so the empty good truck picks up the blemished felt and vegetables for fertilizer. You can have a cow floor, a dairy farm and a chicken floor in what was an office building. One person drives an hour with gas and clogs tollways to drive to a city where someone else has to drive an hour to his town to work. Now they both work from home, they can get paid more and write off an office in their home, empty office building can be converted to indoor farms, and the sprinkler system can be used for irrigation. You can grow every crop in the world, everywhere, indoor, with every climate and 24/7/365 agriculture, and not even smell farm animals in a building   For what it costs to build housing here and grow food on welfare, we can pay people who want to go to another country and build indoor farms and drag ocean lines and build clean energy waste water stations. Who wants to get paid to go to south America and maybe even live there? Whether you were from there, want to get paid to go on a humanitarian effort, or maybe move there : )  With today's technology and the skilled people who came here to learn skills, maybe they would love to develop their home turns and make it great, with more than enough food and water and electricity for everyone, everywhere  People work for each other for paper and out of an overflow they trade. Everywhere will be a good home for ev
It's bad if it didn't come from an animal, but it's hgh and then you'll think it was G8tes lab grown meant, sold as such  Why not lab grown beef Because they were going to continue to grind up abortion meat, prisoners, still cold etc  The gravity of the moon is weak, the tides are from the world turning on an axis, run across a field with a glass of water  Make a peaceful opioide euthanasia available to all who want to go and 45-65 percent of the planet would say thanks, have the best night and best sleep is their life, and world say thanks and about f'ing time  A peaceful death in your sleep, the best way to go, is to suffocate for 13 minutes   Imagine a world of only people on it who want to be on it  It's just another day on this prison planet  The world is too retarted to have not done that by the year 2022, I would never come to this planet  Most CO2 is from cloud seeding, when you spray o2, or energy stations using elecktrolysis would release it to the planet for carbon to bond to, the real problem: not enough oxygen for carbon to bond to and enough plants to separate the carbon, the sun will make 02 into o1  Instead we're dumpling carbon and alumn in the skies  Cows are being blamed for dpopulation flights  Send learn mower clippings to feed cows, Uncle Sam city jobetc, trucks pick up fresh chemical free lawn clippings to go to warehouses, land with or without grass to feed cows  Need a flash freezer for the grass, cows, and fish on new indoor fish farms and people making 9$ hr at petstores rubbing fishing equipment can make 90k a year tonight indoor salt and fresh water fish farms feeding the people, he can spend his money on 3 months of vacations a year
People hate hearing the truth that's why they want to dislike back.
Where did the 44% of beef is dairy cows number come from?
The narrator could litterly be the next David Attenborough
Climate change is cyclical, most of it comes from the Sun. So relax and eat a good stake or burger from time to time! You can plant some trees meanwhile, not just because they absorb some CO2 but because they look nice, they clean the air from dust, all the car emissions, create a habit for animals and relax us! Stay healthy and don't waste more than you have too(food, heat, money, petrol etc).
There is one pleasure that is done many times a day
Long time viewer, was here since the very beginning of Kurzgesagt (about few hundred thousands subs). Decided to buy Calendar 12022 from kurzgesagt shop last October, haven't arrived yet. Always "on the way". Now I can not even track it using UPS store tracking code any more. Sent an email for help for 3 weeks now, no reply since. Very "professional" !!!
That vegan teacher now has a new student
Something to note is that if everyone started only eating vegan food is the livestock would need more land because they would just breed naturally and eventually we would just need to go on an animal murdering massacre
9:45 why is someone eating a ridiculously huge helper T cell?
With this information, i will eat meat
What does it mean when on food labels it says “contains bio engineered food ingredients”?
I saved this to my watch later because I thought we would get the science on the health of eating meat. But no... climate change. 😑 bye
How about fishing and hunting on a personal scale, not commercial?
I am a minute in and I already know he is gonna have *beef*  with at least one community. Get it? No? The joke sucked anyway…
We could also use the extra land to build more houses we dont need but want.
Lesson learnt, it is best to lock everyone including cows and chickens in like they did for covid19.
If all living animals seized to exist then earth will not be facing much greenhouse issues other than occasional volcano erruptions.
That's why I am mostly vegan🥱
Idk
The reality is, you don't need something on your plate that comes from an animal that isn't alive anymore to every single meal you eat. You simply dont
The land that most of these animals exist on is usually land that can't be farmed with crops, these animals usually eat foods we can't. And per pound meat is extremely more nutrient dense then vegetables. So fuck off with eat less meat bullshit. Also have any of you seen what's in those veggies burgers? Talk about a lab grown food Jesus.
Why can not plant meat
does anyone remember when the thumbnail said "meat hate" for a little bit?
Yes meat from mammals is bad because it causes more chances of cancer
birds eating chickens
Eat meat, drink milk and lift weights if you want to be healthy and happy. Eat vegan processed junk, drink soymilk and do crossfit if you want to be unhealthy and depressed.
I see the original thumbnail is back...
Red meat is not bad for you.  …fuzzy green meat is bad for you.
Wait, why did it change from meat love to meat hate to meat love again?
The thumbnail changed from meat hate to meat love. I genuinely wonder why?  Is it tvt at her antics again?
too bad it tastes amazing
Is it just me or the thumbnail is changing ones in a while.
I mean hey as a vegetarian who loved chicken that fake stuff ain’t bad lol
Just as vegetarians , vegans  get hate in USA & Europe Meat eaters get hate in India & Israel
This was very informative!! I have always wondered about the questions raised in here..... Everyone should see this!
Two months later.. thumbnail changes from "Meat hate" to "Meat love"
Birds: talking about issues meats, vegetable, fruit, animals in farms and Climate change  Also birds: face to face turning blind to cannibalism, speciesism, ignore animal rights and chicken dying in cage of farms
I like how the thumbnail went from "meat hate" to "meat love".
Puting aside everything else, meat is TERMINALLY BAD for cows, pigs, sheep, chickens and every kind of poor animal people kill and eat.
food good&bad
9:43 inmune sistem easter egg
9:43
Great video for the environmental benefits of going plant-based! I was surprised there was no mention of fish and the devastating effects of over-fishing, eutrophication and ocean acidification, but overall, it was explained very well.
Is it just me or the thumbnail was changed
How does this video have two different thumbnail at once
First of all why don't you love animals is the bigger issue
If only there was a way to make the price of goods and services reflect the cost they have on the environment...
Did kruzegast change the image again??
Why did u change the Thumbnail?
What happened to Meat Hate thumbnail? :(
The thumbnail of this video keeps changing!
I noticed first the thumbnail was meat love, then meat hate than meat love again :)
Vegan for health, planet, and animals.
This is a FANTASTIC video that crams so much good information into a digestible package (pardon the pun) and answers a number of questions!
Vegans and other people keep saying that we shouldn't eat animals since they're friends and a part of nature but the problem is that eating animals is also a part of nature...
This was meat hate  Now it’s meat love
wait hol up he changed the thumbnail and thats sign of new vid
Thought it was about meat effects on our bodies 2.0
are you a vegan?
THANK YOU for bringing up this topic. Not a lot of people realize how much vegan diet can change
So basically: Meat by itself isn't bad, what makes it bad is human greed and unwillingness to change for the greater good (the environment).
"No matter how we twist and turn it..." Food is a large part of the human contribution to carbon dioxide emissions, which itself is a small overall part of global, natural carbon dioxide emissions. But is it a driver of climate change? IPCC reports list human activity as responsible for around 3-5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and even if humans ceased to exist tomorrow, carbon dioxide would be produced by other processes, and at best, we can only modulate that 3-5%. I understand "lies to children" and all, but please tell more of the whole truth. Human activities emit 40 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, and that's on the high side. Natural processes emit 760 billion tonnes annually. Of the total emission, food production is a small sliver. But a portion of mankind will continue to regret its own existence and progress as long as man exists.
The problem is not meat,  the problem is overpopulation.
You WILL consume the soy protein
The premise is false: CO2 is bad. The gas is essential for life on Earth, the more we produce the better the environment grows. Consequently, meat is the best food because it produces the most CO2. Carbon-monoxide CO, on the other hand, is a poison that isn't produced by meat, but is used in packaging to preserve its colour. Cattle ranching doesn't destroy wildlife as much as crop farming does. Water vapour is by far the largest greenhouse gas contributor, but those stats are buried in favour of the climate change agenda.
Food transported from overseas also needs to be distributed locally using vehicles, you dishonest lefty.
It's bad mostly because it tastes/looks/smells/feels(texturally) bad xd
Very good video! Very eye-opening!! I would love it if it had subtitles in Spanish though, so I could share it with my family ‘cause they don’t speak English.
Anything to push depopulation while the elite eat kobe steak on their private jets
I LOVE THE STYLE OF ANIMATION THAT IS USED HOLY-
I'm surprised at the fact no one in the comments is talking about the fact that our body's are made for a omnivorous diet, it's such a interesting topic and I wish people would be more open to talking about it more
The solution to global warming is if we get all cows to burp in one direction at the same time, we can shift the earth away from the sun.
meat is based

I would like to point out that the part of cereal crops that livestock eat tend to be the stalks and leaves.... all things that humans don’t eat
I've always believed a balance was necessary. Focusing too hard on veggies or meat exclusively changes the environment too much and does exactly what we tried to avoid. (like deforestation for crops or farms both)  Also herds can help fight desertification, and does already in Africa, since the animal waste helps fertilize nutrient dry soil and areas turning to sand.  Have you done anything on desertification?
The only purpose of this video! Veggie Meat ( Artificially processed in Lab by human beings with limited knowledge n senses, having greed for money n no interest in human health)                          Vs  Organic Meat ( Natural food aligned to human stomach n easy to digest naturally n made by the God for human health, Balancing the Eco system )  Human greed for money will never end even at the stake of human health. Cows are vital part of our eco system!  Some greedy business men wanna sell lab prepared unhealthy artificial meat in the world. Also they have prepared the milk too! So avoid this carbon dioxide propaganda ... real goal is to sell artificially preapared lab meat.
One of the things not discussed here is how cattle can eat byproducts of the food we grow for us. We can only eat ears of corn, they can eat the rest. Cotton plants, they eat the seeds, and so on. Those would go to waste without cattle
About 25% of US households have cats. No one that keeps cats has any legitimate right to proselytize a vegan diet.
It’s strange this is a hot topic. It really comes down to facts and that is that meat takes a ton of resources for less amount of energy for consumption. The messaging shouldn’t be to go full vegetarian it is to eat less meat per week. Replace meat slowly with chicken or pork.
This is a very touchy topic to cover, the ethicality of slaughtering animals for food is a heated debate. This was presented very well and only said it factually. I applaud the efforts, good job Kurzgesagt!
Alternative title: Is Meat Really that Bad According to the Leftist Pro-Vegan Approach
Well, what about the effects of photosynthesis? I mean, cows don't magically conjure methane out of nothing, it has to come from somewhere. And where does it come from? The atmosphere! With the help of the sun, carbon dioxide and oxygen is converted to carbon hydrates in crops, inluding grass. When cows eat this, they are simply part of a circular ecosystem, which has existed for billions of years. Why would this system suddenly be broken to produce more carbon than was put in?
Talks about methane when linking source that talks about CO2 equivalents. So the point about methain is compleatly irrelavent since it's already have been calculated to effects of CO2. Same source points out how forest burning accounts for 2% of GHG. Which is a mute point, because a study from 2018 shows we actually have more trees then we had in 1982.  Crops for animal feeder emits 6% GHG. Crops for people emit 21%. About 3kg of crops is needed to produce 1kg of meat. So we gain 4% from crop farming just for people assuming we want to have about the same amount of food in mass. 4% of 26% all food emitions is 1% total.  40% of livestock emissions are from farts. I'm not gonna include manouer because we will still need to fertilize the fields with something. Not gonna include land changes, because again, it is false that we have less trees today.  To recap. 26% is all food emitions. 30% of that is from all livestock. And 40% of that is from farts. So 40% of 30% of 26% is 3.1% of total. Add to it 1% that we save no longer needing to feed animals and we have at best 4.1% reduction in GHG in CO2 equivalents if you go vegan.   Since according to the video about 60% of livestock emitions come from beef and half of beef is used for meat consumption, if you just quit eating beef that's 1.4% reduction in total emissions.  When people talk about quiting meat, they really seem to forget that we still need to produce, process, package, transport store and refrigerate all the new food substitutes, as well as fertilize the fields and do something with waste. Waste that will produce methane.  Obviously 4.1% is not nothing. But transport (just cars) depending on source contribute 8-15% and by moving to solar we can reduce emitions by about 25% (by my calculations). And the thing is, at least with energy, it requires absolutely zero compromises from people. And governments are already subsidising solars. Then there's the fact that technological improvements increase efficiency, reducing GHG emitions. US for example houses 6% of world beef population but is producing 28% of world's beef (did not verify this myself).  It's also interesting how they are talking about deforestation of rain forests, but it's not like africa or south america are exporting beef to the US. Even in central and south america malnutrition is an issue. Not as bad as africa, but still. Should they stop cutting down trees and just starve? Not that the deforestation is an issue, as mentioned earlier. But even if it was, what would they offer as a solution to those people that don't have enough to eat? I didn't read much to it, but I found an article talking how land gained from burning down rainforests is used for poeple crops and only after the soil is no longer viable it's transformed for ruminant animals. So it's not like they burn it for animal farming.
also interested how it affects the human body
My opinion: you don't have to be a hardcore vegetarian or vegan. You can still enjoy your stroganoff and tartare, go ahead but not too much. Balanced diet is a must. Eat your veggies, less processed meats. And being a Catholic I learn about substitution and creativity when it comes to healthy yet delicious meal.
I’m 23 and have never eaten meat in my life.
Forget vegan and non-veg.        *Return to cannibalism*
I didn’t expect to see birds cosplaying as cows..
I’m curious about the carbon footprint of fish.
In most food I feel like I can replace beef with something more environmentally friendly, so I do it. BUT in my honest opinion nothing beats a good steak. It's not like I eat steak every day, so I don't have to feel guilty for my occasional luxury.
Me eating a steak while watching this: 😳
i don't eat meat like beef
Simple fact there is really good example for complete non meat diet in history Look at Japan 675 ~ 1868 Land Meat is Illegal for 1200 year Overall man and woman height got shortened a lot  Sick people eating wild animals for 'Medicine'  No bullshit for once in a month meat vegan or non meat diet muscle growth bullshit And specially No EGG  Complete modern 'vegan' diet for 1200 year result looks really not good
"Use up our entire carbon budget..." If only there was something on this planet that could pull carbon dioxide out of the air, so it wasn't almost 0.05% of the atmosphere!  When will science invent such a device?
Solution: You don't need to quit beef, but when you have kids, don't make it a part of their diet.  I'm a non-vegetarian living in India, I absolutely love eating non-veg, but since cow meat isn't popular here (partly due to cost since we're not the richest country and partly due to religious beliefs), I never had it as a child or grew the taste for it. Recently I went to America and tried it for the first time and it tasted like shit (no offense beef lovers).  I suddenly got a glimpse of born and raised vegetarians: If you dont raise a child on meat, they're less likely to develop a taste for it. (I do not encourage forcing anything on your child, just don't make it easily accessible as their daily meals, but when they themselves grow curious and ask to taste it, give them the freedom to do so at their own expense)

I HATE BILL GATES/ANTICHRIST
humans are animals 8:36
I believe this study was just leveraged off the global warming fear monger. Didn't talk about how many health problems will be avoided by slowing down your animal proteins. Do some more research than just this 🙏 - good information here but I see it defending our current farming methods
Thanos was right
Go Vegan for better life
Human made pollution is like only 0.00001 percent of greenhouse gas. Water vapor is more than 60 percent. Was it 99? Anyways, NASA says that this 'climate change' is a natural cycle, and we humans have nothing to do with it.
@Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell ---> *This video contains many fundamental inaccuracies* that could be perceived as spreading non-factual information. Therefore, I studied your Sources & further reading. Unfortunately, I have to say that I have encountered severe shortcomings, whether in your interpretation or in the sources noted.  Example No.1: at 00:01:24 _"Worldwide food production is responsible for about 26% of all human-made GHG."_ Your source: Poore & Nemecek 2018  My finding: 1. Nowhere is an exact citation of the source. But I helped myself because this author team published only one document in 2018 entitled _"Reducing food's environmental impacts through producers and consumers"._ 2. This document *contains literally only one sentence:* _"Today's food supply chain creates ~ 13.7 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq), 26% of anthropogenic GHG emissions._ *3. No research, no given source. Nothing.* 4. To date, there is no scientific work to confirm this figure exactly. Only a lot in the form of an estimate. And, if we agree - estimation is not an exact science.  And this is one of the many examples your video is based on. So from the point of view of responsibility for disseminating unverified facts, you should consider withdrawing it.  If you are really interested in spreading the facts, you can contact me directly. I have been doing this part of science for a long time. I am in favor of reducing emissions, but scientifically and not populist. This is more suitable for politics or people who have other interests in it = and such approach will not save this planet.
I did a calculation:  Beef has 70% more calories than potatoes.  But... there's complications.  That 70% longer time alive wouldn't go higher due to higher protien in beef becuse the body can't use all that. Potatoes have all you need.  Beef's extra protein would be converted into glucose (that conversion used up calories).  So the 70% goes down lets say to 65%.  THEN... you could factor in the health risks of beef.
I wish you mentioned the percentage of meat trashed every year.
nobody, me 5 seconds into the video: tell that to Africa
While the effect on the climate is important, what's most important and completely missing from this video is the fact that, you're consuming what was, a living breathing loving feeling sentient creature, and because you are disconnected from the source of where it comes from (slaughterhouses) you did not hear its cries of anguish, you did not witness its tortured existence in a cage, you in no point felt responsible at all for the precious life you took, not because you needed it, it wasn't necessary to your survival, but simply because you found it pleasurable, which is fucking sick.  This planet is fucking sick, you're all fucking sick, brainwashed zombies, so if we truly are in the middle of the next great extinction, good riddance, fuck humanity, this video and comment section is evidence were a fucking cancer that should die out.
Horse's and Cows are 100% vegetarian and have a powerful rod and are seldom sick. Now don't u see the advantages.
Indians are vegetarian
LUDWIG GOT BANNED 😣
there are people in the world who will never touch meat in their entire lives, that are dying from hunger, and we don't talk about it
came here so i can watch the rest after ludwig was banned
Je suis Ludwig
Most days, I am vegetarian. Just by accident.   Fairly shocked at how biased - but pretending to be factual - this video is. They 100% ran into high quality research the counters some of the data based points they made in this video, deliberately ignored it, and stuck to a very specific narrative. I would feel terrible if I made a video this dishonest. Quite a few people make these videos so a ton of folks had to be onboard with this.
dont like the meat or you dont wanna eat it? put it on my plate, ill take care of it for you!!!!
i dont think "what i've learned"'s main point was that meat wasn't bad for the environment; he states many times that meat has a negative environmental effect. **rather, his video was a response to the growing narrative that meat was absolutely the worst thing for the environment and that we could save the planet and solve our problems simply by cutting meat out of our diet.** he objected to this narrative because it was beginning to distract from the massive harm that fossil fuels had on the environment--his implication is that cutting meat out of our diet will be next to useless unless we do something about fossil fuels, which are exponentially more harmful.   there are two discourses around meat-eating: ethical and environmental. "what i've learned" is not concerned with ethics of meat-eating, but with saving the environment. there are people who are largely concerned with the ethics of meat consumption, and they seem less concerned with the environment than they are with stopping meat-eating. they will overblow the environmental effects of meat-eating in order to artificially bolster their ethical argument. (i doubt they're aware they are doing this, i dont think they would intentionally push arguments that would harm the environment). "what i've learned"s main mission is to undo these misconceptions. people are misinterpreting his video as an (ethical) defense of meat-eating. his video is not a defense of meat-eating, it's a defense of the environment.  what i've said is not a comment on the facts of the matter. i don't pretend to know, and it's a complicated subject: for instance, "what i've learned" states that cows dont add more methane to the system, while fossil fuels do add extra carbon dioxide that otherwise would have been trapped underground--this is true. kurzgesagt says that methane, while existing in smaller quantites than carbon dioxide, is quantitatively more harmful to the environment than carbon dioxide--this is also probably true. neither of these facts refute the other, they're both relevant. i don't know if fossils fuels are really way worse than meat for the environment, or vice versa, or if it's about even, or whatever.  what IS important is to clarify the intentions and biases of both sides of this discussion. humans dont judge arguments purely by their logic, they also judge by assuming intentions of the people presenting the argument. many people are ethically biased against meat-eating, and this is likely to skew their logic. "what i've learned"s channel also seems to be biased towards meat consumption, so he's not exactly bias-free either. as for kurzgesagt i can't tell; they present their arguments in a cold and neutral way, but an ostensibly neutral presentation can still mask deep biases. but kurzgesagt's video APPEARS to refute "what i've learned"s video WITHOUT actually engaging with his actual argument, and this is a dangerous (and probably unintentional) misdirection.  i will say that different people have differing levels of susceptibility to their biases; some people are less likely to warp their logic according to their biases. according to my own judgement, "what i've learned" seems to be relatively (emphasis on relatively) impervious to bias-distortion. but this is a purely subjective judgement on my part.   a quote from Anna Karenina: "Levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts, and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words, the disputants finally arrived at being aware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago, from the beginning of the argument, been known to both, but that they liked different things, and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked. He had often had the experience of suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too, and immediately he found himself agreeing, and then all arguments fell away as useless."  and an interesting tidbit that i learned from vsauce: evolutionarily speaking, people don't use logic to arrive at conclusions. they use conclusions to arrive at logic. logic is a social behavior used to convince others of their conclusions.  so one must ask: if it wasn't logic, how did they arrive at their conclusions?
Who's here after Ludwig got banned?
U GOT LUDWIG BANNED
not in this car kekw

you likely won't, but a look into fake meat would be nice - some of that stuff tastes really good (and if told people it was actually meat, but seasoned, they would believe you)
Well hold on a minute, transportation of the avocados doesn't end when they reach the dock.  They have to be shipped throughout the country by truck, no different than meat.
the first sentence caused me to reconsider my life choices
The only interesting part of the video was the one where you said "it is complicated...". It is complicated, yes. Many of the calculations have high uncertainty, this is never included because we do not understand EVERYTHING.
Ok i watched it and i understand. Now it's time for meat for dinner :)
Warning:Never EAT PORK! ITS WRITTEN IN QURAN AND ISLAM AND I AM A MUSLIM!
Meat is not really bad but u are really bad lol kidding 🤣🤣
Honestly, if I could just not eat anymore and continue being healthy, I'd choose it in a heartbeat. The amount of time, effort and money spent on food is ridiculous.
30 million people dying every year of hunger and europe talking about reducing food production  because it may influence in some questionable climate change global agenda. More food production = cheaper food. Doesn't those 30 million lives / year matter? Letting they die will help fight climate change? How evil is that?
Someone claimed that you don't have to go 100% vegan. For climate, yes you don't have to. However, you must go 100% vegan for animals. Causing someone pain without any need is not ethical anyway. This video is a very good summary in relation to ecology. But we have to consider fundamental animal rights as well. Or else, our concern would only be anthropocentric.
One Thing I have Noticed In Both Extreme Sides ( Vegan And Non Vegetarian) : Both Use Studies Which  favours them ( no neutral information)  Vegan : Look Meat and milk is killing You .we have studies to prove it Meat Lover : Deer eat grass not humans .Veges Has no nutrition.Veganism is bad
I dont see a debate - we will never be able to stop climate change
If every one else turns to vegan I will.
I can't help but wonder, what if would happen all other carnivores were eliminated but us?
Living in Brazil, as an ordinary citizen who needs to worry about the bills to pay. What could I do to save the Amazon rainforest?
Beef=Extra Sex Power  Henceforth, I'm sticking with eating cows!!! @52 Still going strong with my  *Third Leg* , still scoring, still hearing my name when I ask the Q "Whose your daddy?", I love those screams..... Ohhhhh yeah.... Go ahead be a vegan, it's your call, your life, your decisions, I totally respect that...... but..... next time...... you might hear my name in your dames groans.... LoL!!!!!!!!!!
Nice vdo, made me hungry, I think I'll go and have some Wagyu Beef RibEye Steak.... YUM!!!!!!!
I don't think we are gonna eat less beef..  But we can grow more trees..
so the answer is yes... veganism is good for the environment.  question is, do I care about the environment?
Fuck the planet.  I want burgers.  It all returns to dust anyways.
the meat industry is horrible, all meat eaters should feel guilty
*laughs in Indian*
In India, the ancient Hindu culture for centuries has advised to eat vegetarian food, for the need for meat consumption was surpassed once humans invented farming. Meat harvesting is unnecessarily cruel and is bad for the environment in general as we know now. Eating meat is not the same as eating plants because eating plants does not involve harm and pain to an animal with a conscious mind.
Yeah.. no🤦‍♂️🤣 This is really poor logic
Do one about how plastic is not the biggest killer of the ocean
What about limiting humans on planet ? Maybe 2 childs per family ?
Is meat really that bad?  Nope.   Now, what to do for the next 12mins?
Beyond protein quality, we don't eat meat just because of protein. Thinking in these terms, eating anything else than vegetable oil for caloric intake is terribly wasteful.
So this ignores the evidence that regenerative farming, grass fed beef included, can actually sequester carbon at a significant rate. According to calculations by Joel Salatin of Ployface Farm, if everyone farmed cattle the way he does, we could sequester all the CO2 produced by humans since the start of the industrial revolution in about 10 years. I realise this wasn't part of the video, but it also ignores the massive animal death count from conventional monoculture farming.  Here in Australia, our largest pea growing farm shoots hundreds of animals (including native animals) per season to prevent crop damage. Not to mention that those animals still living are deprived of access to that land. In regenerative cattle growing for example, there is still food and habitat for native animals, albeit less than native forest, but surely still significantly better than nothing.
what im gonna do with this information you ask? attacking McD and their consumer off course!
You will literally have to kill me to make me stop eating meat.
Quite dissapointed. I wanted to hear if met is actually bad/good for my health . Not about Co2 emissions.
The day we decide to take a step back and literally let go of Earth, let it live on its own as she always has, the day we decide to stop seeing the world as ressources to poach and use for our own gain, we will finally live in peace inside and outside, all together as one big living organism.
Lütfen Türkçe altyazı gelsin
Damn Brazil shame on us
Saw nothing on sea food..which is meat also..why not.. biased 😂
The Answer as so often is the Middle Way. 1.  Put Preference to the Carbon Low Meat Production. Even if that means scrapping some Animal Wellfare.  This alone will already Tremendously reduce CO2 Emissions.  2.  Slightly Reduce Meat Eating in General. Maybe by 1/3 or if you are Ambitious by 1/2 so Meat becomes a bit more Special but not to the Point where its a Luxury.  Again this will massively Reduce CO2 Emissions.  3. Change Meat usage of different Animals. Promote Meat from less Carbon Intensive Animals and Disadvantage Meat from Carbon Heavy Animals.  This also would Help alot.   And now you look at me. Oh Yeah nice Smartass. How do we do that ? Its really Simple.  Subsidice Vegetable Farming for Human Food. Meaning that Farmland used to Feed Humans earns way more Money.  This results in 3 Effects at once.  A.  Vegetable Food becomes Cheaper therefore becoming more Attractive to People thus Promoting a higher Ratio of Vegetables in the Diet.  B.  Farmland used for Human Food becomes more Profitable therefore causing more Farmers with Suitable Farmland to Produce Human Food directly which will reduce such Farmland being used for Animal Food.  C.  Food Prices except Meat will drop thus improving Living Standards for People.
When people tell you they get meat directly from a local farmer, but drive 10km each way just to pick up a small amount.
eating a steak while I watch this
Thank you!
I agree that its clear that beef is bad for the environment, but can we talk about how bad a vegan diet is for you, especially when it includes the processed meat alternatives.
0:30 let the baby eat the burger 😭😭😭
Plz turkish
All the meat I eat comes from animals raised within a half mile of my house. The beef and lamb are grass-fed on intensive grazing, which is a good carbon sink. I realize these videos have time constraints, but I would've enjoyed a comparison of intensive grazing with other farming methods.
Please make a video on rocket science, current realistic rocket design, and possibility of nuclear rocket engines in order to colonize our solar system.
It would be unusually very one sided of you if you didnt make a video with a title ''Is Vegetables Really that Good?''
To sum up: Become vegan. Is not that difficult and it would return in a better climate conditions to the planet and we can help useless animal suffering
I just don't see the point in eating animal products if I'm honest. My vegan burger be bussin
So in summary.. absolutely. This doesn't even begin to touch upon ethical arguments or the delusion of egocentrism, either.
They have talked about it
A lot of people seem to think that vegetarian food is bland and tasteless, which is not true. For veg recipes you all should see Indian recipes which can help you add more veggies to your diet.  This comment was made by an Indian kid.

Beef feed from soy and cereal is made from the part that humans can't eat. This is disgraceful propaganda.
If you want to see another opinion check out the video on meat from What I've Learned. That video actually has numbers attached to the arguments unlike this piece of propaganda.
4:42 this 18kg figure for the beef is very suspect, and yea I did read the sources. 1 cow yields 500lbs meat. Assume you transport just that to the butcher in a truck. Truck gets 3 kpl. Farm is 50km away, 100km round trip. 1l gas is 2.3kg CO2. So the number is 2.3*(100/3)/(226) = 0.34 kg CO2/kg beef
Seems like we just need to science some stuff out, honestly. But that's probably with everything.
Everyone has secret human right to eat what ever you want   Some one telling you what to eat IS dictatorship and no better Than stalinism or natzismism  Thats right cultist  vegans this means all of you
After watching this video I felt very proud of being vegetarian.
I think my disagreement with this video assumes 100% lack of self sustainability (homesteading, more or less) which means I'm not shipping anything for my sustainance. I feed animals from what we grow, they feed me. I think the video has sound logic, but only applies on this magnitude to folks who live in urban areas and rely 100% on others to provide their food.
Spanish subtitles please🥺🥺
stop speciesm, go vegan
Beef stonks
Actually if given the chance chicken get a half grass diet ,pigs also can get grass,roots and others in theyr diet as 25%
The more I learn about climate change the more it's clear we need to cut human reproduction way down and keep it low. Even if we do everything feasible to fight climate change, we will lose the fight eventually.
You forgot something. These animals are sentient living beings like me and you and want to live!!
I just had a really great beef 🍔
.
Well i guess we should get working on getting those startrek replicators to work.
One flaw of the data is that while cows will emit more greenhouses gasses, you can't see how much greenhouse gasses are absorbed by the plants that feed the cows, because many cows used imported food from other country's or area's. Like Mais or Soja. So if you want to have a precise data, You need to look at the greenhouse gasses from those area's where the soja plants are grown as well and compare it with eachother.
Grass that are grown to feed cows will absorb much more greenhouse gasses than for example potatoes. Grass grows very fast. It is build from the greenhouse gasses. While cows will cause more greenhouse gasses, the grass will absorb it again. Just look at the satelite maps that has the most cows that are feed with their own grass. (No import food) Those area's. The greenhouse gasses are very low. So you have been brainwashed all the time.
We can get rid of all plants and animals of the world and live without atmosphere. For climate activists this seem the ideal goal. Just a cold planet without life. Animals are bad and nature has to move so we can build solar panel parks and windmills all over the place. Climate activitist want to get ridd of nature. My advice is if you love nature and animals. Keep eating meat! It brings more life to the planet. It is a part of the life circle.
Also plants have much more waste we can't eat. So it will rot or going in the sewer and you have more poop, because the body can't digest plant cells very good. More waste that turns into greenhouse gas eventually. Where are those numbers? Compare that with meat?
If you compare a kilo meat with a kilo bread. You are super stupid. Meat includes all essential nutritions you need, except vitamine C when you don't eat organ parts. So if you eat meat, you need less vegetables and other stuff. Because all the nutrinions already in there. If you eat bread or rice, that needs less land/water to grow. You still need to grow a lot of other plants to get your nutritions. Instead of 4 kilo food. You need about 3 times as much food for the same nutritions. I want to see that in the numbers.
Greenhouse Gas emission from food is 0%. All the plants that are grown for the food will absorb the emission back. But there is a flaw in the data, so you don't see it back in the data. Biggest brainwashing of the time.
Why does this channel have such a horribly forgettable and unpronounceable name!!?? First time on this channel. Have been eating no meat this month, so pleased to see it's good for more than just my heath and budget.
Restoring grasslands is a great idea, but grasslands require grazing animals for restoration.
“Casually munching into a burger whilst watching this video 👍🏻”
There's decades-long studies by people who literally work to make the food industry efficient that I kinda wish were sourced in this video, but I guess that's just a testament to how many there are.
Summary of the Video: In order to slow climate change, we need space travel or genocide.
Meat gets this rap because media. The best thing to do at this time of life? Ignore media, and turn off all social media. The world existed and was a better place before social media.
What’s funny is the lack of showing the whole picture. Farming causes more destruction to natural animal habitats than large ranches do as farms have to support everything from food for humans and animals to even fuel.     You have to tear down entire forests to have a sustainable large scale farm.
Cow eat grass and we eat cows, so we are vegan by eating a cow that eat grass. Lol You have one life eat whatever you want!
Don't care about climate change.
Excellent video folks. Proud to be acting on this information
There is no vegan god, but a calf.
Why should I care about useless animal s
I can't stop eating meat at all. but I think I can handle myself without beef. I can eat that like twice in a year.
0:33 CANIBALISSM! lol
topic request : ww2 or thing about world war 2
did all of these 90 year olds in the comments forget how to write? whats with the ellipses?!
You me as a dislike button👎
hi :)
🍔🌭🥓🍖🍗🥩🍤🍟🍣 these are all meat, and they taste good
I'd rather eat bill gates at this point.
I'm surprised more people don't know about rotational pasture grazing programs that are designed to reduce carbon! That's partially the role of most grazing animals in the wild. It is also getting more popular to do "sylvopastures" which is rotating your herds through forestland as well to regenerate healthier soil. (For context, I never eat beef or pork anyway)
And eating beef and meat, also do  harm our mental health. Just think about it, what their mental state would have been when they are kept in the slaughter houses, FEAR OF BEING KILLED, ANXIETY,ANGER,FRUSTRATION and what not. When we eat their meat, that enery and vibration enters our body too, and effect our mind body and soul.Its a spiritual aspect of it !
But now the big question, is a vegan diet better for the human body then when you eat meat. As caveman we all eat meat so looks like our bodies need meat. The biggest problem is there are way to many ppl that need to eat, and the planet can't provide it for all of us. So i guess something bad needs to happen so there are alot less ppl to feed which is better for the food and the planet.
I continue to be impressed with how clearly and relatively objectively your channel communicates even contentious issues.   We're learning good ideas from you for any similar work: Like systematically going through points, figures putting various factors in context, opinions of all sides, impact to us in the short and long term, giving a summary at the end.  Your clear presentation style will continue to be helpful to other communicators (e.g., educators, news, writers).
All those packages just do not sit at the docks, there would have to be transports to continue the trip. In conclusion there is just way too many of us living a high standard of living. We have food, gadgets, clothing etc... all coming from around the world by ships and planes using paved roads. Construction takes away our trees for buildings. Concrete too is bad for the environment. When there was nothing but foot paths and wagon paths, nobody complained.  I was totally disappointed when I went a few months back to my small hometown. On top of this one hill, that I lived beneath, I used to dream of putting my house up there, surrounded by the woods. I thought I would still allow the local children to toboggan down it and cross country ski.  To my disappointment there is now a series of roads, many much larger houses then the older locals homes, many missing trees and the woods taken away. By no means was my home small it had a living room, basement, dining room 4 bedrooms and 1 bathroom. These homes that were put there were massive. It seems we are wanting more than what is needed. Seven children grew up on my old home and it was enough. With all that we learn today, we are still much more wasteful of our resources than need be.
1:22 to 1:48 says it all.
Short answer: Yes  Long answer: Yes please stop eating it
Im not earth haters, most of my dish consist of vege and fish...
stop eating beef ..............be vegan
Global warming is future generations’ issue anyways not ours 🐂🍔🍖😋
Full disclosure, this organization receives $500,000 a year annually from the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation.  This organization has a particular bias against meat production, just so happens to be the exact same topic of this video.  Who am I kidding, never bite the hand that feeds you.
Humans: enjoying meat diet for eons of years Modern media: meat bad, eat industrial waste instead
So in summary: Meat is bad, but also Vegans are bad for promoting the same behavior but using plants instead... both, both are bad.  And even if you switch to tofu: that tofu is still fed to animals which eventually ends on someone's plate... so: you're not doing anything by changing your diet. Someone will eat that meat and even if we stopped eating animals... those animals would produce more methane... and so no matter how I look at this, there is no right answer because both damage the environment. Humans are the worst. But also animals are bad and also plants... kill them all and we solve all the problems. Robots are the future.
Yes
tbh i dont care if its bad or not. we are on top of the foodchain. we consume others. if you dont want to eat meat by choice well bravo keep it to yourself stop trying to force me into your vegan save the world BS. if humanity really wanted to save the world we would tackle the big oil lobbyists which we are doing but with on a dumb delayed rate.
If everybody switches to plants then soy production will go up anyways, since everyone will drink soy over real milk. The grazing land that we save will be used to grow plants anyways because we’ll still be hungry just not for meat lol. And I can only assume it’s a bigger carbon footprint to drive a tractor over acres upon acres to harvest crop to make up for not filling up on meat. It’s a stupid debate, let’s improve our transportation carbon footprint and stop deforestation
Whether you eat beef or potatoes is the window dressing on the Titanic. You could snap your fingers and take away all meat from human diets immediately, and we would still have the same problem, just a few years later. The issue is all of the food EATERS (humans) are skyrocketing in population. If they are making ANY CO2 at all, it's too much if you have 50 billion people. So, if you have a kid, don't talk to me about steak. You just created more pollution with that kid (and all of their kids that follow from that one) than anything environmentally conscious you do in your whole life. At some point we are going to have to curtail baby-making and balance the population growth. At least until we have massive CO2 processors that can handle the load. Oh, by the way, someone give the Pope a hint: to say that making babies is 'not a priority' is a gross understatement.
this video has the most secrative thing they have ever said to us in a thousand years!
Ok, but for the meat is the amount of CO2 produced per kg also include what the animal eats? Like if we didn't have any cows to feed in the first place we could be eating that produce.
get woke  go broke
You kinda skip the fact that humans can't eat everything from grains, only corns are edible. The rest can then be fed to cattle. All in all I think the calculations used here skip over a lot of points and give meatproduction the fault for many things which realy aren't it's fault, like the destruction of jungles. This is much more an economic and political problem, that wouldn't be solved by simply turning vegan.
Meat is not as bad as is sold to us by the powers that be. Food waste is as much if not more of a source of methane in the environment than cows burps. Plus cows aren't eating food that humans eat - 85% of the food that cows eat is not fit for human consumption. The amount of methane a cow pumps into the air pails in comparison to the amount of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere by energy companies and cars. We need an honest debate on this topic to help clear the air because the vegans are wrong.

Irony: When a self-avowed vegan pulls up to the Global Warming symposium in a petrol-powered Cadillac Escalade ...
Thanks for the video!
The matter is the overexploited purging capacity of the planet. This is a fact that we have to deal with if we want to preserve our planet. The problem is that the consequences from such activities won't show up until we find ourselves in an irreversible situation. Science is out there telling us about the dangerous effects behind global warming and we, humanity, are still not caring enough. I don't advocate for vegan diets or other minor lifestyle changes as solutions, but for more environmental responsibility from the most powerful entities that are currently prioritizing profit.
Haha this won't gonna happen STUPIDS WILL NOT GONNA AGEEE UPON RENOUNCING OR REDUCING THEIR MEAT DIET 😹   Part of survival has now become matter of taste for them
This is such an amazing objective neutral learning channel! Amazing how you present so well the facts about subjects! Keep up the great work!
one thing that wasnt mentioned was the fact that crops used to feed cattle doesent necessarily mean food not used by people. corn as an example, a very popular crop used by various industries can be, and often is used to feed both cattle and people, the human edible part of corn is actually very small in comparrison to the rest of the plant which is actually edible to cattle so only the byproduct of growing corn goes to cattle. this is very common on dairy farms. I'd also like to see this expanded to include fish and how that stacks up i imagine its probably on a similar level to poultry but id like to see.
Big oil is smoking up the planet — not the cows.
There is no carbon budget.
Never eat red meat and processed meat
vegan prophaganda
Yes meat 🍖 is bad
Choose chicken, pork and veg ... in future our planet will get better
just reduce the world population, let's go to the third world war
Let me answer this. Yes meat is really bad, both for you and for the planet. Wether you want to eat it or not however is up to you.
Good video (343K likes and only 14K dislikes). I wish you would have included the risk of viral pandemics, like birdflu, where mass animal farming is a perfect breeding ground for viral infections.  I also wish you would have included lab grown meat at the end, to show an alternative which allows people to eat meat & animal products without abusing animals and damaging the climate & environment.  Isreal and Singapore for example are already selling them publicly in select restaurants and they will replace "traditional" animal industry soon, simply because we cannot any longer afford an animal industry.  But all in all a good, well researched video, thank you for that !
please DO NOT buy meat from brazil. By doing so you're helping to finance the destruction of the amazon. This comes from a brazilian
I call bullshit. 15 cargo ships produce as much pollution as every car on the planet combined.  All of the emissions that are released could be reduced by growing your own garden
you want an actual fucking solution? Eat meat and enjoy. And then destroy any politician who gives the oil industry subsidies on your instagram or youtube page. Videos like these promote the fossil fuel industry's agenda, namely blaming individual people instead focusing our efforts on attacking congressmen who subsidize the oil industry which produces most of the emissions. The reason personal responsibility ideas for climate change is popular is when it started with an ad campaign by...BP promoting green ideas for people and shifting the massive resposibility from them. If we stopped blaming people for eating food which accounts for almost nothing in comparison and is controversial and difficult to change for obvious reasons, including millions of years of biology, we could focus on the real enemy, politicians who support the fossil fuel industry with no blowback. If all our efforts were directed to blocking subsidies for oil and fake biodiesel subsidies, the alternative energy industry would actually become profitable and the fossil fuel industry would be considered the alternative energy. A fossil industry.
An honest idea: grass fed beef is well known to be better for the environment, but could we have a sealed factory farm, to which air is supplied through tubes so both input and output is controlled. And somehow filter out the methane? Maybe even use it to generate power towards the circulator system which would still produce co2, but at least it would not be methane. Or just use it towards other applications, point is: controlling where the released methane goes so it's not into the environment but into controlled tanks or facilities. It would be against animal rights so I see that problem, but I'm purely focusing on the climate effect of it with this idea.
Why do meat discussions always avoid the psychological aspect?  Meat is aspirational, it is a triumph of modernity and the staple middle class item. One of the ultimate rewards that capitalism has given us. You privileged 1st world people take everything for granted but as someone who grew up poor, eating meat regularly means a lot to me., it means I defeated poverty.   Good luck telling Africa as they are finally developing that their new middle class can't eat meat because "muh global warming"
What a load of shite!!!!!!! Get some facts correct before publishing
I like beef, but I also like the planet. Why is being good so bad?
So basically beef is the worst offender and yet the only solution people come up with is stopping all meat production and consumption? Pork and poultry is a viable option.
I LIKE TURTLES  🐢
You should've included the forests that are cut to Produce food for the animals which are being born forcefully. We can't ignore the fact that these animals should not even have born. Humans are making the animals reproduce more just so that they are eat them, which is wrong on so many levels.
i realise the thhing gorilla holds is always diffrent bc of the topic
Gpo
this channel is too pozzed when it comes to woke topics.
Still, we gotta stop farming so much beef or there won't be any polar ice...
That reminds me - I need to go get some brisket rub and maybe a bit more pecan for smoking.
Fine, I will go for chicken
Never met a vegan that didn't display negative mental health issues.
“The reality… well… it’s complicated” Even out of context, this is true
Good thing "man made" climate change is a joke
After all the research I’ve done, this video just adds to the truth. 👏🏽 well done, I hope to see more on veganism and bettering ourselves and the planet.
We just need to be smarter with how we produce food
I am vegetarian , and I am helping the planet
ummmm is nobody gonna mention the thumbnail change? When the video first dropped the cow had hearts for eyes and it said "meat love". Now look at it. Wtf? Weird level of clickbait
I love your work on every subject except emissions and climate change.  It is so cursory and fundamentally flawed. I would love for you to dive in deep and see how many BTU’s are actually created as a thermal increase of the climate by 1Ton of CO2. I promise you will be surprised and it is truly he only measure of ‘how bad’ meat or CO2 even is.  Because an entirely absurd and abstract measure of ‘emissions’ only serves to confuse and fear-monger to different industries that have cleverly disguised their emissions but not necessarily their impact on the climate when measured less abstractly.  Having watched for years I know you’re up for a challenge, I look forward to see what you find.
I'm going to eat beef anyway, because I like it.
Read the book, Apocalypse Never, a good book that sites their sources.
“Production will drop by 70%.” Me: s t o n k s
Disliked!
Why shy away from concluding when data was obvious...
We should give up the  Burger 🍔
Okay now let's talk about what do you do with billions of cows that are still alive. You'd have to cull them because anything else would be extremely cruel and counter productive. Lowering the amount of carbon we produce is great but is useless unless we figure out how to mechanically separate carbon from the atmosphere.
Very interesting information on production and methane. With this information we as consumers can think more critically about it.  That being said, I wont stop eating meat, nor will I change my diet for any reason other than personal health concerns. My fitness trainer said I need to eat 50% more meat, so that's what I will be doing.  Humans are great, we can adapt the environment to suit our needs. I do not understand why we're trying to force mother nature to solve the climate crisis. Build CO2 capture towers, methane scrubbers, or other systems to offset our desires makes far more sense. There's tons of ways to solve this that don't rely on humans kneecapping themselves.
Food is overrated.
I would like to see a video breaking down the nutrition values of vegan vs regular (omnivore) diet
That's why hidmums is only truth 🕉️ 😎 🇮🇳
only satan doesn't use the pill only diet
Thought that cows fart much is debunked, they burp out Methane mostly. Then it’s contradicting itself that factory farming animals needs less land, ergo less climate impact. How much land and CO2 emissions do those feed crops use/cause? I like this channel but it simplifies too much with it’s own agenda.
Only pos humans who think they're above others will continue to consume meat without regard, while those who are conscious of others will likely be vegan, vegetarian, or even some people who eat meat sparingly.
I raise a small beef herd and agree with pretty much all of this.  We've left over 40% of our property as forested land and kept all the grass and forage native instead of planting invasives as an attempt to compensate.  As time moves forward I want an electric skidsteer, tractor, utv, and four wheeler.  We're working on powering the whole farmstead on solar panels within the next three years as well.  I understand that we'll never be as carbon friendly as veggies, however if more beef operations did what we are doing vs whats going on now it would be a non-argument.  It's crazy how even mentioning electric equipment will get me cussed out vs diesel engines.  It's technology, it's not supposed to be political, it's supposed to be a solution.  I think as genetics improve and more understanding of the rumen (adding things like seaweed to diets to reduce methane) will assist in making beef a viable good source for awhile, or at least I hope so.  Great video!
*"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times everyday"* speak for yourself cartoon bird man
I vow to double steak consumption for a month for every vegan loser I encounter in my life 🥩
0:04 speak for yourself...
This video is only concerned with carbon gas emissions though. Torture and slaughter would still be bad even if livestock were somehow not a factor in climate change at all. When you consider the sentience harm angle instead; the production of eggs, dairy, chicken and fish products causes much more harm than beef does, because you make much more bodies suffer to produce the same amount of food since each of those bodies is so much smaller than an adult bovine. If you want to go vegan for ethical reasons but still don't want to cut all animal products in one go; consider cutting fish and eggs/chicken first. Then pork, then dairy/beef; in order of most suffering to the least suffering directly caused by torture and slaughter. Similarly, hunting smaller game is worse than hunting bigger game; because you have to kill so much more in order to get as much food; and sentience is very much _not_ proportional to body size.
More ant videos!
Please help french people to get smarter by adding french subtitles to your videos ! Love them by the way (a French Guy)
9:25 subtitle inconsistency causes a 798 billion difference... Plus hectares and methane are pronounced so weirdly...
Can we reverse the effects of methane?
Science can't give you an answer about how things _should_ be. That would be a naturalistic fallacy. Science studies what _is,_ not what _should_ be. What _should_ be is the purview of Ethics.
This only accounts to ecological aspect of "is meat that bad ?" question. I think it is a great safe aspect to consider and just gives people straight facts people can't argue with. More emotional aspects like  the health issues and moral aspect of the conditions these animals live and die is a wider topic and worth considering d as well. Also how farming and farms influence and worsen living conditions of the poorer part of society that is forced to live near those farms and gets cancer from the waste and pesticides, no clean water and the smell of shit in the air constantly. Fork over knives, what the health, got facts about milk ?, the game changer < those are just some of the documentries you can watch ! Happy veganuary everybody !
Concusion: Meat is bad
I love your vids
They say that by the time we die, we each have about 5 lbs of undigsted red meat in our intestines.  I heard that.  I think I have more than that cause I got wicked cramps.  Yowee!
I don't really get what's wrong about reducing the suffering of living beings, while maintaining ecological and economical balance. I pity people who buy low quality meat on sales or freeze KFC nuggets out of pure meat obsession, if the plant based or artificial food become equally decent in both taste and nutrition then why not pursue this idea?
I eat what I can because I'm poor
since one week carnivore - I feel great and lost 2kg
didnt know cow's fart were too powerful
Which is why older civilizations such as India have been following a "Vegetarian" diet.. after years of evolving and understanding scientifically the upside effects of meat consumption.. also aligning it spiritually so people stay away more so.. !
Bottom line: the best way to save the planet is to reduce the human population. Let's start there, but unfortunately still taboo.
Hmm it's all about balance
But, eating beef can reduce the length of your life. And, being dead significantly reduces your carbon footprint; Especially if your body is used for fertilizer or pig-feed.
I don't really care about the environment when it comes to why I'm vegan. It's really all about not letting animals suffer.   It's very convenient for people to forget that cows and pigs are species that have sophisticated emotions and social interactions, that egg farms keep chickens in tight cages as they develop leg- and other growth-related problems (there's tons of pictures and video), and that male baby chicks are killed because they can't lay eggs or be used for meat as they don't produce enough meat for it to be "worth it". Fish suffocate and die painfully from the lack of pressure when taken out of water, obviously.    There is no in-between, you are either vegan or you support _some_ level of animal suffering because you want to indulge yourself with animal products. It's really that simple.
Pretty well done video. However I was disappointed in coverage of the methane issue which is routinely misrepresented just about everywhere. Pound for pound, the methane emissions of all animals is roughly the same. The difference is at what point we emit methane. Ruminants emit the most while digesting. Other animals emit from their feces. Cow manure emits very little methane. Manure of pigs and chickens (and humans) emits a lot.  Pound for pound, anything that eats is going to produce about the same amount of methane while digesting or through excretion. Keep telling vegans that arguments for reduced meat consumption are very strong but arguments for complete abstinence are very weak and counter productive. Of course, once one admits that reduced consumption of beef is the stronger argument, one comes perilously close to acknowledging that reduced consumption of everything is in order and that the degrowthers have got it right.
Great video with plenty of balanced perspectives and real data! Love this
thanks, this was great
nice vegan proaganda. How much it cost?
Watching this while fried is like watching a documentary on life and real problems everything this guy says is real I can tell easily
9:46 thats a pretty big t-cell
I really think you should also talk about the water usage when mentioning meat. Water scarcity in general is going to become a HUGE Problem for everyone, as climate change is exasperating it a lot.  Rich countries are just used to have drinkable unlimited tap water running in every building at every time, and take it for granted. But it isn't. Water is going to run out and we'll all have to experience the real results of no water. People who lived in droughts periods knows what I'm talking about: showering 1/2 times a week, flushing the toilet only for number 2, having hours where water just won't come out.   This isn't a joke, or an exaggeration. Please Kurzgesagt talk about this, the majority of people are completely unaware of this problem
The amount of meat that is processed and then ends up in the bin is ridiculous. Meat does not have a very long shelf life. What isn't purchased gets thrown out. Do the math on a world wide level each year. Insanity.
No ones gonna comment about how the birds on the start were eating chicken???????????
You try to be objective but you are not. All the adjustment from a human standpoint. Not good for ecology.
I’m not vegetarian nor do I know if I ever will be definitively, but i met this one kid whose reasoning I could get behind. He eats vegetarian most of the time because it’s cheaper and healthy for him and environmentally sustainable and what not, but he won’t say no to food with meat if someone is about to throw it out. Like he still enjoys steak, but would most often pass it up even if it’s already been cooked (because he knows that somebody else could eat it now or the next day and that would save one extra meal with meat) but he’ll finish somebody’s plate once they start eating. I think that’s what Imma move towards
I can think of one thing I enjoy multiple times a day and that never gets old.
Thanks for the video, but I will keep eating beef everyday!
I absolutely love meat: chicken, pork, beef, others.  Life wouldn’t be joyful without a 🍖
I will stop eating meat when the rich do thats my take on it
Please put subtitles if possible. i liked your content.
So in a nutshell Americans should stop eating so much damn food
Please make a hummingbird video.
lol humans. instead of fucking birth control, lets grow meat in labs to feed everyone! meanwhile all other overpopulated animals get a hunting season and routine culls with helicopters.
Pro Tip: buy some land and be a steward of your own little portion of spaceship Earth
I would suggest that beef and lamb be banned and chicken and pork to be sold and slightly replacing it for taste seekers.
I've been working in a fastfood for a month some years ago  the ratio of thrown away meat to the selling one is roughly 60:1
Climate is important, hella important, but meat is borderline unhealthy for humans, which is an enormous reason to quit meat regardless of climate. I just think you should talk about that also.
Let me tell you some thing If we are going to stop eating meat and convert to vegan foods then our coming generations are eventually going to evolve and we are going to forget how to eat meat then 100 years from now animals are going to out growth humans and this is very bery bad for the survival of humman bieng so please stop this bull shit and let's all make a promise to eat 50% meat and 50% vegan.
2000 year's ago during the Roman empire the global average temperature was 2° warmer than today. Using cow's as an excuse for climate change. STFU. Earth goes through cycle's we still don't understand fully. Next year could be the start of a new ice age. Sweet F A we could do about it.
Non-vegetarian stupids still won't change. They don't care. They have the attitude of 'lets see what happens. Meanwhile let's enjoy our beef'. I know going vegan is also not easy but at least we can become vegetarian and contribute a little to world.
2:53. A kilogram of beef will keep you alive longer than a kilogram of potato’s? Are you effin kidding me? Never heard something that was such nonsense in my life. I feel bad for the idiots who actually believe that bs
Great Video as always but is it fair to discuss nutritional values without discussing quality?. I.e presence of essential amino acids
meat is NOT  delicious.
If it is china eating meat, then it is "global warming"
Heroine begs to differ.
I’m vegetarian and hate the taste of meat but i don’t care about meat eaters like do what you want lol
Meat is delicious, it really is, but at some point we have to realize we have to reduce it. I honestly hate that we have to, I really love meat, and we don't have to fully remove it, but we certainly have to reduce it. Go vegetarian or at least lower your meat consumption if you can, we need to get the industry to slow down.
8:13 I can't beleive Kurzgesagt made their own stonks meme.
Athletes go vegan because it makes them perform better. Meat being what makes you strong is nonsense
TÜRKÇE ALT YAZI GETİREBILIR MISINIZ LUTFENN!!!
👎 Dislike
some nicely animated propaganda u got here
No matter how well presented, accurate and engaging the data, humanity isn't changing until something terrible happens. It's an awful thing. It's a horrifying thing in it's implication, but it needs said: The most crucial element in saving ourselves is by stopping and reversing our population rise.
So what i'm hearing is that it's better to kill and eat the cows cause they produce so much greenhouse gas... If we went vegan, and let the cows live... Wouldn't that just mean more cows living longer and producing gas?... Either that, or we just kill all cows and go vegan lmao
@Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell Could you guys do a video in the near future about logical fallacies, specifically regarding the arguments that people have made against this video?  In this comment section there are a tone of examples of Appeals to futility, Appeals to nature, Appeals to majority, Appeals to tradition, Ad hominem fallacies etc. I think it'd be productive to go through them for your audience.
I love meat, I eat an extra steak everyday to cancel out a vegan
Can you do one video of cigarettes vs vaping pls, I really can't say by my self or with the info in the internet if vaping (with or without nicotine) is safe for the brain and/or lungs
Is 16% even enough to save us in the long term?
Get rid of cheap McDonald's burgers and millions starve
14k dislikes, just fyi
I can just see that vegan teacher using this video
Whoever doesnt want to eat meat has my full support, I will however eat meat in different forms every single day.
But how about water consumption for those plant based diets, that can't be good either 🤔
It's the great irony of dietary evolution: we needed meat to grow big brains, but we cannot sustain our existence while eating meat. I love meat. I don't want to live without it, but we have to give it up if we want to stay on the earth for another several thousand years
Have cattle graze in forests and occasionally catch them for dairy or beef
I need my beef and no one can stop me.
Please Korean
Globalement très chouette!! Mais gros bémol sur l'histoire de la distance qui ne change pas les émissions... C'est peut-être correct pour cet exemple avec les avocats. Mais pour la plupart des aliments, il faut les conserver durant les semaines de trajets ce qui n'est pas le cas des circuits cours. Conservation veut dire : congélation (très cher en énergie) ou agents conservateurs (de l'industrie chimique qui vient de partout dans le monde, gourmand en énergie). De plus, les courtes distances permettent plus facilement d'utiliser à terme des moyens de transports pauvres en énergie (solaire, électrique, force musculaire), qui sont impensable pour les longues distances. Il ne suffit pas de calculer les émissions de Co2 de la combustion des moteurs, il faut penser avec un spectre bien plus large...
Go vegan
If you drive a Tesla, you’ve done your part. Eat all the beef you want !
Where does fish land in all of this?
Do you guys know about the James Webb space telescope kind of cool search it up me thinking that kurzgesagt will do vid of it
Imagine if people could cut just half of the meat... it would be such a huge impact already. But, unfortunately, people hate their grandsons.
También nos van a decir lo que tenemos que comer, estamos perdiendo toda nuestra libertad.
That’s the point. You only have the comments to assessment
Flexitarian: be aware, never b/w.
As a plant based vegan, I admittedly struggled to enter this with an open mind due to the title and having researched this topic heavily over the last decade. I'm pleased to say this is a very well made video that hit most of the notable points people should know.
This video doesn't even attempt to touch upon the health consequences of carnivore diet, let alone the ethical implications of torturing other conscious beings. To learn more for the former, I suggest you check Dr. Greger's YouTube videos
unfortunately grasslands get overgrown and dry out if nothing eats it or steps on it, making a huge kindling for enormous fires. Fencing and the decrease of animals on land is the reason for decreased carbon sinking. We need more wild bison, more wild horses. Wild hogs are filling the niche that was once held by bison, but if we stop fencing  animals can freely cross into different areas which they can graze. Soy, corn, and wheat are NOT REAL and they are not human food. Cereal is addictive and so is corn and soy!
Me being an Indian doesn't feel bad as it eat mostly plants ❤️🤣
You forgot to mention that feeding tha animals with see weed will cut the farting with 99% and  it is only need d 1% of there food.   And 3ml seaweed will grow to 3m in 200 days and bind more carbon than anything else on earth. So this time you should have done better hmm no more extensive research:)
0:06 well, there's one
I love meats yeahhhhhhhhhhh
Thank you so much for going through the numbers like this. The amount of effort and time is insane.   Also, thank you for even being a voice of reason for the people with doubts and trying to explain in a "human" way.   Shortly said, you represent a true human in todays society.   You should be really proud of that.  Thanks for existing ✨
Can we not expect that the local transport will become more and more carbon neutral though? Much easier there than with transatlantic shipping
Here is a big outlier though, most people who want vegan diets don’t want the animals to die. So we would either have to kill 99 percent of them to stop overpopulation and unnecessary methane emissions of animals that do not need to be in existence because every are not using them for food anymore. The animals will continue to breed if we do not intervene. It would completely counteract the whole effort because we are not doing anything with them and they will continue to burp and fart
Be like :Ads and Peoples Meat NO Sugar NO Egg NO Coffee NO Smoke NO Code NO Computer NO Screen NO Game video play NO Work office NO Youtube To watch NO Email NO DISCORD NO UNDERTALE NO TERRARIA NO ROBLOX NO MINECRAFT NO SLIME RANCHER NO FORTNITE NO KIRBY NO MARIO NO HELLO NEIGHBOR NO FNF NO AMONG US NO TV WATCH TITANIC NO  Be like : your breaks heart BOOKS READ YES EATS VEGETABLES YES - VOMIT😫🤮🤮 BE CHILD YES - #### I Have 23 years SMILE YES BE COMMON YES BE POOR YES BE FUN YES  I HATE THIS
I eat. Yum
Vegan isn’t healthy. Vegetarian is better but the best is a high quality organic meat and vegetables based diet (basically paleo)  We shouldn’t “save the earth” by making humans unhealthy
@Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell There are at least 4 Lobbies try to control the Earth and one of them is the "Vegan Lobby". The last 21-22 Years they do what ever they can to destroy everything by saying that what they are doing is the Right Choice... So we get new kind of diseases and new kind of problems from there experiments and the obsession...
Why u use birds?
Damn...   Well I always liked fish and chickens!    I will eat beef less and less...
I just feel like none of this actually applies to me, living in a country where it's common to keep chickens, rabbits and pigs in your yard and those animals essentially live off of leftovers lol
Wow what a wonderful shit. This is senseless.  You probably don't know this topic
So, ALL mammals need to be eliminated to save the planet?
So we either have to go Vegan, become Monke, or put cows in farms that capture the methane released by cows (for fuel or other uses)
Most degenerative diseases come from meat eating. If you do not want to live a low quality life or even worse die prematurely, then don't eat meat.
I ate more meat than usually today after watching this video lol Doing my part.
Thank God for GMOs
I don't like how incline this video is to say that a vegan diet is the way to go. I think the topic was oversimplified: It doesn't consider the nutritional value of meat compare to vegan food like rice, soy, and others, which we would need to eat in higher amounts to satiate our hunger, or where does the water consumed by livestock comes from (it mainly comes from rain). This video should be a two-parter, at the very least.   This comment doesn't even began to cover all the information neccessary to clarify how incomplete this video is.
Food is the worst part of being alive. You have to do it constantly. All the prep and clean are tedious. With eating, you can’t procrastinate or get your work done early either. It just never ends.
i love learning about things like this and seeing topics like this that get thrown around a lot, but i also wish that there were more educational and accessible videos about how much military impacts both our infrastructure, economics, and environment as just the production of guns, tanks, jets, etc all are hugely wasteful and create a huge footprint alone.
Any good book on this topic you can advice ?
In Islam it’s haram to keep animals in the best life you can, with biggest space, and best food.
Don’t those idiotic vegans see that the GHG levels fell with the Covid pandemic ?  Cattle numbers didn’t fall. Chicken, pig, and fish numbers didn’t fall. People didn’t stop eating. THEY STOPPED TRAVELING !!  Now just what does that tell you? Even a vegan can’t be stupid enough to miss the correlation ...
Pls translate to arbic
Live in the pod, eat the Soylent, the sooner “science “video told me too
Looks like it's time to eat more steaks.
There is no doubt it is tough on the environment. But it also isn't so bad that it needs to be fully stopped. That would be asking to much. There are a lot of changes that can be made that would help and reduce it a ton. And if we actually make progress in other areas too, we could actually do something to fix this. But sadly, we can't even get everyone to agree to the undeniable objective fact that man made climate change is real, and a huge issue. So fixing it won't happen anytime soon sadly.
I haven’t fully watched the video yet but I would like to say that I try to eat twice as much meat as usual so that there’s a vegan out there who’s technically doing nothing 😂😂
I hate factory farming and think meat is bad for us, but why do you not mention how only 100 companies produce 71% of greenhouse gases? Like that DWARFS the 16% of meat emissions.
You buy beef cause it is tasty. I buy beef cause I want to sink the coastline so my property becomes beachfront. We are not the same.
7:19 Chandler Bing has entered the chat
Anything that has emotions and you are having that .... Then probably you will be called as a murderer... Cow for us are sacred..
Governments should make birth control free ...  And instead of shipping boatloads of food to populations that are reproducing like rabbits, they should be provided with boatloads of free condoms.
Cows are not the demon here the real demon is human.
Sometime these logics sicken me, it's like suggesting that the best course of action to combat climate change is to kill all humans as their introduction and development in this world was the primary contributor.  Logic alone won't work or do you want it to work?
What about the other side of the Earth
Vegan meat patties: $9.68 per lb. Ground chuck: $4.38 per lb. Well, that works.
I´d love to see a followup video on a comparisson between all protein sources, such as beef, birds, fish, and insects.
UN shills.  They can't even tell you what the temperature *should* be, yet have the audacity to say that agriculture is a certain percentage of human global warming.  If you know the percentages, then you know the numbers enough. Please tell us all what the temperature of the planet should be.
Summary!  Does meat have a negative impact on our environment? YES😷 Will people (including me) stop eating meat because of that- HELL NO🤤 So is it worth giving a second thought? NO ( don't stress over things you are sure you cannot change)🤙 great vid btw
1:02 "Zero-carbon tractors, refrigerators, and cookers running on renewable energy, and electric trucks"  This was probably on purpose, but I'd just like to underline the wrong, short-sighted, frame of thinking that all these techno-solutions seem to stem from.  Let's take electric trucks. We *already* have a more carbon-efficient solution for freight transport on land over long distances: Trains. (Even non-electric ones.)  We have to stop thinking in terms of "How could we make X 0-carbon?", and start thinking in terms of "How can we structure society differently to reduce carbon emissions *right now*?".  This is what I mean by "short-sighted". Paradoxically, by trying to invent new and shiny solutions that rely on technological advances, we fail to see the bigger picture, and we close our eyes to the real, concrete solutions that are *already* available and that can *already* have a meaningful impact. All because - I think - they usually mean compromising our comfort in some way or an other.  Like reducing our meat consumption for example... Or our consumption of anything, really. Or, even more radical, trying to gradually reduce the global population. Because if we fail to do so, there will be a point when it *will* reduce. And it won't be gradual.  So thank you, Kurzgesagt, for educating people. The work that you're doing here is essential.
the way it is calculated is faulty as it does not take into account it is part of the carbon cycle, a cow eats carbon which is then omitted and reabsorbed, in whole or in part, it is mainly the way fossil fuels are used in production it is a problem . Otherwise, even trees make greenhouse gases at night when there is no sun.....
0:19 legit could be talking about s*x the whole time until he said climate change 😂😂😂😂😂
But if we get rid of all carbon we would die right bc sun rays will kill us?
"Well, its complicated..." - one love people, one love!
Ok... now tell me, why can I buy 2 full grown chickens for price of 200g of tofu? And who on earh would play for my 100g daily protein intake as tofu is 8g/100g compared to chicken which is 24... I maybe do not know how agriculture works, but I do how economy works, and that price disparity is there fore some reason.... One other point, what i learned from your vid, if you eat poultry or pork, you are almost as much environmentally friendly as vegan. Morale of your story, not all meat is created equal, nor are greenhouse gases, if we would just quit beef, we would instantly solved 60-70% of issue without anyone having to quit meat products. Now, explain that to Americans, Canadians and Australians who are top beef consumers and by far in front of any other countries...
9:26 Wow, I see that you changed that part! =)
Where does waste of food fit into this? Where does over consumption fit in? I think everyone is already almost a vegetarian. My kechup bottle and bag of fries don't have meat in them.
In a nutshell: maybe
I’m fine with vegans just not vegans that are like: If you eat meat or you’re going to hell
You guys DO realize that you create a lot of videos that are both informative, but also, specifically designed to have your viewers act exactly the same way the next day as they did that same day that they viewed your videos - or the days before!?!  Please, start creating videos where you show yourselves, without animation, and tell us how YOU have all acted differently - by making different choices - due to what you have learned from making your own videos!!!  Convince ME/US that you did not realize that you were facilitating the status-quo in this very flawed and deceitful memetic-manner?!?  Or, as your plan been to ignore the most basic math of your own videos all along...which state that the end of things (still believed to be "civilized") as they are now, are coming to an end - but with simply a bit more clarity from the 99.7% of the people-primates who act as automatons unconsciously domesticated only to crash the Earth's various age-old systems?!?  OK then...in helping to simplify this past paragraph for you, let me just ask this: "What ARE your TRUE motives as a YouTube Channel?!?  Thank you very kindly!  Signed, THE Professor of Sociocybernetics.
I love the work you guys do but I couldn't help but notice the graphic at 9:35 is a little misleading with CO2 removed showing tonnes removed in 100 years being compared to the CO2 emitted in just 1 year. I know why the amount removed has to be considered over a century as it is wildlife restoration and that CO2 emitted cannot be reasonably projected for the next century assuming this were to happen but displaying them on the same scale makes it seem like a lot more CO2 would be removed per year. Where as if they were both on a per year scale emissions would be over 6 times greater.
not me watching this while eating a burger
anti-meat-person : its not about science its about our feeling
Rip in a nutshell vegan teacher   is coming for you
"It's up to you what you'll do with this information"  Gonna have 5 kilos ham with family this Christmas, thanks.
wow a virus
I'd be interested to hear where in the CO2 game burgers made from cloned meat lie, and how that may change in the future - I'm trying to reduce my meat intake, but at the same time there are some vitamins and nutrients that are most easily gotten from meat that I would sure miss if we had to go full veggie!
Nice video.
Dear Kurzgesagt, isn't there any scientist opposing the "2 and 3 billion" info from J. Poore and T. Nemecek (2018) article?
Or, since we don't know if we, as species, still need meat for the brain, can just tackle the issue of over-population and keep our natural habits until we know. We can solve multiple problems by just thinking about; how we use the genitals.
Methane is truly powerful
India has the largest vegitarian population in world.
There are many environmental factors, but a lot of people ignore the health element. Meat is full of cholesterol and humans aren’t supposed to eat meat. For example, we have blunt teeth, long digestive systems, have fingers and not claws and have to cook the meat to make it safe to eat. You also have to season it well with vegan spices. Also, the animals are tortured. They don’t have a choice. It’s so sad because their lives are ended needlessly.
MEAT IS AWESOME! And good for us. Who said it's bad??? WOKE leftists? HA HA HA! Sheep and beef and pork meat is GREAT!
I would rather change the climate than eat soybeans and vegan patties my entire life yea no
MMM MMMMMM MMM meat!
so youre saying the problem is overpopulation?
I will just eat more beef
This video made my hungry for some meat
Beef is bad, but how do other meats compare? How are different diets good/bad/irrelevant? Like, is veganism the true way to go? Is being pescetarian or vegetarian enough? This is such an interesting topic because also it's a really good way to kind of collect the information to apply to my own life like gosh watching this video makes me never want to eat beef, but I also already don't really do that because I dont even enjoy it most of the time. Environmentalism is just like one of the most immediate application kinds of science which makes it so interesting!
So dino-farts were never a thing... ?
Climate change is very important, but it's not the only basis on which to evaluate meat... or anything else.
CH4 emissions from cattle are from burps (and manure in some manure-management systems), not farts.  Also, GHG emissions from agriculture, including meat production, are part of the short carbon cycle.  That is, agricultural production moves around carbon already in the atmosphere and biosphere.  Conversely, fossil fuels add carbon from the long cycle to the short cycle.  Treating agricultural emissions as equivalent to fossil-fuel emissions is inaccurate and unhelpful.
I am also following veganism for a long time and hopefully it will go longer till the end 😉✌️🇮🇳❤️
Alright, but what if we just eat all the sheep I Australia that are causing climate change with their farts
While I do feel bad for how it effects our planet I’m also not giving up beef. It’s a very important part of my life and I have a lot of good memories tied to it.
meat hate? that's pretty meatphobic bro.
The only real problem is that there are about seven billion people too many on this planet
OHHH NOOOOOO... SO I MUST REDUCE MY CARBON FOOTFPRINT THUS I MUST NOT EAT ANYMORE?.... OKAY .. `proceeds to eat beef burger and eat locally sourced farm beef`
Look Humans are animals after all. An scientifically they are omnivorous so they can eat meat. Not only humans many animals also eat meat. But have you ever wondered by Deer populations never go down even if lions hunt them ? Humans have to limit their habits. Many animals in the world have went extinct and are on the verge of being extinct. So it is time we protect animals. I don't mean to say to turn vegetarian. it is your choice .
Well so long as i can always have my juicy stake then idc lol
Based on the graph in the first part, I got that brutally murderering chickens is better for the environment
The answe is no, we evolved thanks to protein consumption readily available in meat. Lipids are also associated to protein (meat has fat) which demonstrates the fundamental relation between muscle structure and hormones.
For 30 years now I've had Alpha-Gal. Bitten by a tick where whelps cover every inch of my skin within half an hour of eating any mammal. I can eat fish or bird's but not that often. When I do it's much less than I was taught. The first year I went from a 40 inch waist to 32. That's why I don't think humans can process other mammals efficiently. Especially after age 40. I still crave those 2 inch thick cuts of tenderloin, but I'm happy when I get my blood work back now vs. then. Before no medication could control my triglycerides, but it did control my high cholesterol. Now I don't need either and those reports are amazing compared to before. You don't have to give up meat. Quantity means a lot. But I'd think twice being a mammal eating other mammals. Unless you like being full of 💩.
Who is here after abhi and niyu
Better title would be Is meat really that good
The world would be better if we lived in a society where lactating women could get jobs selling their breast milk as an alternative to cow milk. Just think about it, human breast milk is healthier for humans than cows milk, and we could reduce the amount of cows in factory farms; reduce the amount of cows in general, which would reduce the amount of methane going into the atmosphere and have less of an affect  on climate change. Women could unionize to have good working conditions with decent pay and benefits, which would actually make the milk taste better if they were under less stress. Although it will be mandatory to be drug free, and maybe have regular drug tests to insure the duality of milk, that might actually motivate struggling women to quit drugs and get off the streets by selling breast milk. Women with hvperlactation would have an outlet for their  excess milk production and be compensated for all the milk they sell, while women who under produce could easily buy the amount of breast milk they need from the grocery store. Just imagine having an omelet, cheesy pasta, or chocolate milk but made  with human breast milk; that would be pretty wild by todays standards.
I am curious why you guys don´t touch the animal suffering in this video  and only the carbon footprint. Hmm Anyways....
It might be 0.3kg from a ship but then it has to get on a truck.
Read the book of Daniel in the bible. Will change how you feel about eating meat!
I usually don't dislike this guy's videos... but regardless of how you feel no 'make your own decision' remark at the end is going to change anything.  The facts are certainly not wrong, but this really just felt like him telling me to "go vegan you fat pig".  People tell me "going vegan or vegetarian isn't hard" but that's their experience, for me meat is a comfort food in a lot of ways and without it I feel like I'm just eating to fucking survive and not something that I genuinely enjoy.  I don't scarf it down my gullet every single day but when I just feel like I need to eat something I know I'll like I tend to rely on it.
Meat is good,  YouTube has done away with the dislikes so I'll put it here ("dislike") lol
for a minute keep aside the  environment and other bla bla things ...Being vegetarian is the best thing you could do for yourself...
0:03  K: No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times everyday and never gets old Boyz: Awww…           Girls: Sure ;)   Boyz: JK ;)
*Is Meat Really that Bad?* Vegan Teacher: Yes it is
Honestly, one of the biggest environmental changes can be made by regulating how much food (meat and produce) commercial farms make. They produce much more than we consume, therefore creating a lot of food waste and larger carbon footprint.  However we're still trying to change people's eating habits which would not make that much of an environmental change, as it is the production and distribution of goods that causes the most pollution.
I'm still gonna eat meat. In eating meat as we speak. A chicken  burrito. Anyone don't like. 1 not my problem anyone got a problem with it. 2 fuck off you can make me stop eating meat over my dead body.
I don't care. Meat is way too good to stop eating lol.
Curious why it wasn't mentioned that we need meat to function properly. We don't get enough nutrients and protein from plants alone to support our hungry brains. We are here as Homo Sapient because we started eating cooked meat.
Meat arent bad itself, we are evolved to this level mostly because we are primarly predators and when we do not have meat we can eat other things. The way the meat are produced is the problem not meat itself.
Epic Mountain makes great music for this channel, it makes this videos even more enjoyable.
You need to make a video to talk about what's the best food when it concerns climate change, which is apparently peanuts after some searching. It has the best CO2 emission to calorie ratio and low water consumption on top. But you cant survive just on peanut butter or peanuts so seems like potatoes which come close in CO2 emission per calorie have to be part of the diet.
Talking about nutrient density is an oversimplification. Our body needs several low nutrient density foods that are necessary because of important micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). And something worth mentioning is that exchanging a life for a meal is devilish. I went vegan 6 years ago and I am never looking back. Please consider eating less animal based products, for your health and the future of our planet.
Most informative thank you
I watched this eating a double Big Mac
Beef taste good
Maybe give cows space to live?
한국어 자막 없나요ㅠㅡㅠ
Cool video, but I’m not gonna stop eating meat
How about… be normal and eat both vegetables and meat, for both energy, your own good and nature’s good
It is not just environmental concern but about compassion for the voiceless.
Electric trucks will help the efficiency of local transporting for sure. I will definitely be eating beef/steak until I die but you guys can eat plants and bugs if you'd like.
"Is Meat Really that Bad?" *completely ignoring the horrific treatment of animals and workers
The problem is not having meat means more land would be needed for plants.
What about plant based meat? We could use the land used to made meat to grow plants to make even more meat.
Gimm a steak idc idc
Thank you for always presenting information so objectively! (Subconscious) insecurity around meat eating leads to a lot of conflict so it's great to see the pure facts without pride getting in the way.
What happened to the "Meat Love" thumbnail that showed when the video was first released??? bit sketch if you ask me
Türkçe olmadığı için Azerbaycanca izledim, çoğunu anladım.
Screw soy...I'm sticking with beef. Fly less private jets to save the world. Steaks forever!!!!!
In conclusion. Eat less meat.
I don't care, even if eating meat was pure evil or w/e, I don't have that much time on this earth left all things considered, so I intend to eat all the meat that I can, before I kick the bucket.
the weirdest thing ever is that in my APES class we learned about this, and then when we got home, there was a video on the exact same topic uploaded. by none other than you guys. Psychic!!
It's funny because my country is going through an environmental crisis due to deforestation and environmental destruction caused by the plant food industry, especially avocado. in my region there are not even edible vegetables all year round, only a few berries in spring, nor do imported vegetables or fruits arrive in good condition in this area, There is only fish and guanaco to eat.
There are a lot of other factors which just looking at Carbon footprint per Kg couldn't cover them. For example, there is a series of studies that show eating meat leads to a smaller stomach, less nutrition requirement, and a bigger brain. Each one of these three could open a whole debate. Or for example, you are discussing the footprint of Soy production for meat, but you don't discuss the footprint of non-animal-based fertilizer in farming. Or you discuss optimization of land used for meat production and in a paradox your ideal way is to dedicate that land to "regrow jungle" for the "unlimited growing human population". Or water problem or land needed per nutrition for each food source and much more... .  I can say for the first time you made an almost-shallow video which doesn't cover a lot of aspects of the topic (and a bit biased).
So Thanos was right then?
Can't we just make artificial tree??
Stop lying about Brazil, we have one of the highest native forest of the world, while you fuckers chopped down most of your own.
Americans have gifted us so many documentaries. You guyz are awesome. If possible watch "Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret". I agree with "Kurzgesagt' as I have watched the documentary.
Why not figure out ways to scrub CO2 in a massive way and keep the beef?
It's better not to kill animals for just pleasure of taste bud and talking about the ecosystem balance we shouldn't kill animals for that reason if earth has to get doomed it will and to inflict pain and death to animals and only pure carnivorous may consume mainly meat only big cats and maybe pure meat eaters may have right to consume
You need to do a video on artificial sugars. It’s so hard to find information and have any confidence that it’s not been tainted by sugar lobbies promoting their sugar free products
Wow
This video is vegan teacher's Haven.
Thus channel is funded by Gates
Question is how much do humans contribute to all greenhouse gas emission?
Cows. Killing us with their farts. I knew it.
I am vegan and i am proud of that😁👍
Will you give this video Spanish subtitles in the near future? I would love to share it with my friends and family.
This topic is very controversial. One thing I will say is putting global warming on the average person is unfair when a big driver of these issues are huge companies. For instance I saw a stat that said if one person stopped their energy usage for their entire life they would only stop Global Carbon emissions for 1sec. Big corporations need to make the change but I mean. This is a huge fight and where do you even start. Almost everything we use is bad for the environment.
The soy bean argument... Animal Feed is made from what is left after the oil production. If it werent for the oil i don't think it would be worth it to grow soy beans for animal food...
Id love to hear your thoughts on permaculture food raising. You use the same bit of land to raise tree and shrub produce as well as annual crops beneath those and use animals to graze that down and keep limbs high on trees. That keeps disease down in the plants and the grazing helps fertilize the soil. By rotating the animals (beef or otherwise) you keep over grazing down and using multiple kinds of animals helps to keep grazing even so no one kind of plant gets over eaten. This method stops tilling, which keeps erosion down. All the trees (if mixed and not in monoculture rows) helps boost diversity and encourages insect and wildlife. This means almost no need for fertilizing or pesticides. That means no toxic run off and the soil grows dark and healthy as it catchs lots of carbon.
What about the carbon footprint of seafood? Fish, squid, prawns and the like. Curious about how they compare with other meats.
Please can you explore animal suffering and why a dog is morally different from a pig.
Superb - well done kurzgesadgt! 👏
I immediately came to this video after watching What Ive Learned Meat video
This scarcely matters. We reproduce like lemmings when we no longer need to. We evolved eating anything we could to survive. You overfill the terrarium, lots of frogs will be recycled. We can't feed this growing mass on nature. Get fixed and have fun.
I'd still eat meat
Is that how methane is actually pronounced? Lol
No meat is not bad for you.  Ok now I’ll watch the video.
I don’t understand anything with all these statistics about soy and food for animals the explanation does not say if its clearly bad or not or how all these pieces fit together. You can improve the quality of this explanation, specially being such an important topic.
Still not eating the bugs or living in the pod.
how stupid of course it is.
I would like to see a video like this challenging the  hysteria and junk science surrounding global warming
When did Kurzgesagt become a source of misinformation?
Too much of anything is always bad...just eat what you like ....
TREES TREES TREES
Meat isn’t inherently environmentally damaging. Buying non-local meat shipped from factory farms which consume grain is environmentally destructive. Soy avacado etc farms are objectively environmentally harmful, and are often necessary for vegan lifestyles to remain healthy. Your backyard goats consuming trees bushes grass and pooping out exactly the right fertilizer and the same amount of surface water they put in is far more ethical than buying shit made and shipped to you from across the world, that was grown with slave wages.
I refuse to eat overly processed, artificial, veggie “meat’
Wouldn't it be the most logical to compare meat and veggie in terms of CO2/Calory and not CO2/ kg Food? You mentioned that meat is a lot of more Calory dense, but i would be very interested how it would change the argument.
I cannot see the dislike count. So I leave this comment that I have dislike this video.
I will never stop eating meat. I have gone so far as to have my own chickens and am working on raising my own cattle. You'll never tell me that I can't have what I want to eat just because you want to change climate yourself
The thing is vegans think most of what we eat is meat, like na, like 1/3 or 2/5 of the plate is vegetables- Plus a lot of us workout and etc and need the meat and then they bring out a random vegetarian that made it as if we all have the same genetics and just etc  (Edit) and if you’re fat and your meal is more than half of your meal you need to check yourself bud.  Plus not only that hi were very new to this whole science thing and I highly doubt even on paper some vegetarian thing has the same nutrition value as meat it really does the same. Idk bout y’all but sometimes meat gives me energy.
I would rather the world explode then give up meat!
sadly meat isn't optional either
It sucks that animals have to suffer becouse a lot of people eat meat.
Me watching this video while eating kfc......💀
Green pill or red pill? Eat grass you whole life or eat meat cooked on the grill, ribs, fajitas, sirloin, rib eye, brisket with BBQ sauce on a Sunday mmmm 😋😋
Biased arguments and 40% wrong
Kgf 2 teaser out now
I think the change can really start by making meat a luxury instead of a commodity.
8:17 THE *STONKS* MEME
Again, an absolutely great video, thank you very much!
0:04 you sure bout that m8?
Meat is good. Vegan is Evil.
Short answer: yes
9:20 Well, that seems like a misleading "perspective" to give. 800 billion tonnes of CO2 removed over 100 years vs current 50 billion tonnes of CO2 emitted per year currently.  Comparing them side by side like that makes it look like the C02 removed would easily make up for our current emissions, which contradicts what you actually say. Why not compare them both on the same time scale? Average of 8 billion tonnes removed per year vs 50 billion tonnes emitted per year?
Yes… yes it is
Paneer ya chaap khao bro zyada man kare
Does eating and buying it or not matter anyway? ...they already made it and shipped it to shops, we really do nothing by not eating it because big companies keep making money out of it and producing it, and it would need most of the population to stop buying meat, not a small group or even a single person to make meat obsolete to make as its not making money in change. To achieve this we would need a coordination greater than a highly trained army fighting a serious war wich means coordination or nothing.
The issue isn't meat. The issue is the environmental impact of industrial farming and the health impact of the artificial overabundance of certain foods (meat, sugar, etc.) that it creates.
dislike.  Missing a lot of arguments against veganism.  Come on Kurzgesagt, sind sie unparteiisch oder?
Am I the only one who takes issue with Kurzgesagt focusing on beef as a stand in for all meat, despite saying beef is an outlier? I believe that chicken and pork are together more popular and more widely consumed meats worldwide, no? Why not focus on their emissions vs plants?  But let's assume beef was the only meat consumed by humans. Considering the methane produced by cows, of course beef will look much worse than plants in terms of emissions. But methane from cows can be reduced by altering cattle diet (e.g. putting a little seaweed in their food) or capturing it at the source (helmets and bags for cow burps and farts). Those changes would likely alter the emissions calculus significantly, and those solutions are being tested right now, but there was no mention of them in despite this video focusing heavily on beef.   Also, even if cattle and other animals eat more than non arable grassland and eat from feed crops, isn't it possible farmers are actually giving those animals the ^waste^ from feed crops? Humans only eat certain fruits, seeds, and roots of any given food crop. That isn't much of the plant mass on the average crop that humans consume. Considering how often farmers have been caught reusing and recycling waste products to increase production in other instances, it's a strong possibility that the wasted plant mass from feed crops is what's really fed to farm animals meant for slaughter. If true, it's a bit misleading to just say farm animals "mostly eat feed crops" as if they eat the same parts of feed crops that humans do.
Ddd
On the contrary, meat is very delicious.
Thank you to the white man almost causing the extinction of buffalo.. all that methane prevented!
Sooo how much carbon footprint are there in krabby patty?
Stonks reference
Casting my opinion on the ethical side of the question; Throughout history humans have done truly horrible things. We can look back at all these now and think of ourselves as better people, which is completely true. Hindsight is a great thing. The other side of the coin is that a lot of stuff we're doing now will probably be frowned upon in the future, eating meat probably being one of them.  Cheers.
So the solution is to reduce the human population so that our consumption needs are lower.  How ironic that one of the best and easiest solutions to humanity's problems is to kill a considerable percentage of humanity.
Don’t forget that cows can also feed on plants grown for human consumption but be eating the non consumable parts like the stalk of wheat and the husk and stalks of corn
Clearly you did not take my advice on researching Man made climate change as it is very clearly promoted here and even seen as rapid??? As we have been getting the 5/10/15 years to extinction message since Greenpeace's original in 1989 I think we can take "rapid" with a grain of salt. I have to assume that while you may be (1) generally following scientific and philosophical principals on non "hot button" issues you are also (2) the typically soft minded liberal "scientists" when it comes to issues that are popular...you know, the ones that get funding and vacuous acclaim. I believe that the INFLEXIBLE rules of the scientific method should be applied to everything - or else they apply to nothing. You clearly believe otherwise...or at least act otherwise. Perhaps we will meet again in 20 or so years when "everybody" moves on from M.M.G.W. since (sadly) I suspect that is what will be required.
VEGANS UNITE!!!!!
westerners eat too much meat it's not about meat being bad, it's about it being too cheap that people literraly get themselves sick from eating too much meat grass fed meat was healthier and more expensive, which means people can't eat too much of it in the past, people only got to eat meat once a month, not everyday or every week like nowadays plus nomads living in half desert enviroment relied to animals to turn wild herbs and plants that grows in places where any farming wasnt possible into milk products, fats that had calories and meat and bc they were always barely able to eat much, so fats didn't hurt them and that was their only source of calories, unlike today where people get lot of sugars and starch
The comments on this video, would give you a very grim impression of what humans are like.
I love this channel
I tricked a vegetarian into eating meat once.
Basically *"We are f*cked"*
Veggie bird loves vegan diet at 9:07
The main problem of beef is actually that its a low profit product that requires a lot of time and resources from manufactures before it can be sold. Modern corporations require that any mass product must be manufactured as cheap and fast and possible so growing cattle for several years just to sell it for an ordinary person lunch seems like a real waste of opportunities. Selling to that person some lab grown or soy based product is much more efficient. Thats all you need to know about the modern day anti-meat media craze.
Vegan’s are gonna be watching this 😂
We just need to become cyborgs that don’t need food, easy 🙂
Ofc meat is bad, just alone for the fact, that feeling, living beings suffer and die for that
Sounds like if environmentalists want to save the world there just going to have to slaughter billions of animals. Genius.....
lol dude you shouldnt compare beef to potatos, more like quinoa and shit, that stuff is loaded with nutrients
Who cares, people were trapped and ate humans, when you hungry you eat, I have eaten meat all my life and still alive, beside you were designed to die anyway, just eat and shut the hell up
Legend has it ( 😉) that Lent was devised by the Catholic church to boost the Italian fishing industry.  And it worked.  While I wish it weren’t so, it appears even today that if you use an abstract idea, like organized religion or nationalism (vs a material reality or collective goal)  you can motivate people to do things you can’t otherwise..    ijs. 😉
Ironically, everybody dislikes that the "dislike count" disappeared.
We don't have enough food to feed 7 billion people and end world hunger, yet at the same time we have enough grain ( corn, wheat, soy, ext) to feed 70 billion livestock a year on Average 🤷‍♀️ priorities I guess
Yes. Next question please.
AND THAT'S THE TRUTH.  You disingenuous gluttony fed, real villains.
I won't stop eating meat. Gonna have some tonight. Yum.
5:18 🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Is the meat diet?
Cut short the 12minute video to just 1 word with 2 letters, no.
well we wouldnt have your mum right?
Your video made me hungry so I made myself a hamburger.  Thanks!
Still waiting for lab meat to get really good and for McDonalds to replace all their meat with it. That's a massive step waiting to happen. I also had a few Impossible burgers, and WOW does that does taste like straight up meat. If fast food places started using really good fake meat instead, to their specifications, as far as beef patty burgers go, I don't see why that wouldn't work. These are very large scale changes that would help a lot, rather than individuals needing to make their lives harder in some way (though cool if they do). We really need to direct the pressure onto the system and how corporations do their business, rather than shaming individuals who exist in a normalised system, alienated from the harm due their degree of separation. They are a drop in the ocean, and it hinders progress since they get defensive and stubborn and care less to ally with you against the offenders who are doing the real damage. MANY people who eat meat are very on board with systemic change in this regard. Same goes with the climate and their individual choices like driving a car and stuff.
Meat could literally be setting the air on fire and i wouldn't stop eating meat
Sokka: Come on aang everyone eats meat here even the meat
Not all calories are created equal
plz korean sub ㅠㅠ
What a poorly researched video that takes all of it's data from American factory farm statistics:  Research "Regenerative Farming"   Tony Coote and Peter Andrews, Australian farmers who have solved the majority of these issues.
I was really disappointed by this video. I thought they would go through health and nutrition of meat vs plants. Instead it was just green house gas emissions stuff.
Hmmm... this makes me feel good about the fact I don't eat alot of beef. Just cannot digest it. Eat alot of chicken instead.
I'm still gonna consume beef 🍖
without watching the answer is yes. just go vegan.
What do you mean by "that bad?" We literally need it.
Why is last mile transport of meat so much more emitting than plants. That makes no sense to me, do plants teleport into my belly?
Lab grown meat…that’s the answer
Plants dont feel pain this girl is on cocain her tiktoks hurt my brain she needs to find her brain

9:45 Why is someone eating a helper T cell?
With new plant-based meat alternatives, like the Impossible Burger, getting better, it’s possible that a lot of people might switch over. But, there’s still going to be that large portion of people that feel like plant-based just isn’t the same. So even with the plant-based alternatives having a huge reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, it’s still going to be hard to convert to something like this.
This video got me hungry for some tasty meat!
Huge disappointment from this video that doesn't touch the morality of eating meat...
This videos are great, the animations really puts you on the place.
Or hear me out, we could just not care. :)
Go vegan, save your children
THIS IS SO GOOOOD
Grass fed beef can sequester carbon in the soil of done right
So there are all kinds of people.. criminal, innocents, selfish, caring, kind, hypocrites, empaths etc..etc..  Its all mental psychology of people.. just imagine why some people do crimes and why their r prisons for them... Some regret doing crime and later turn out to be a good person..other just don't care and come out to do the crime again... World is not a utopian.. There will always be some way or means where ignition for destruction will always be burning..we can't protect it no matter how much we try... Not 100 percent of the population can be environmentalists, caring, selfless, empathetic, rational or logical...  If that was the case there would have been no problem on this planet.. But 100 percent of population is not like that... Some people learn other don't give a damn.. so that means we will die anyway..may be we buy sometime by the selfless efforts of good humans... Anyway i m giving my selfless contribution for the planet as much as possible... I can't tell for others...
I like the fact that the "Science button" has Kurzgesagt logo
I eat chicken or fish only once a week and the rest days I eat Vegetarian food. In India there are Shit ton of vegetarian food options so I never get bored. I think Americans should try this cause Americans eat a lot of meat every week
Could we please, please, please stop focusing on specific issues and instead focus on teaching unbiased crital thinking skills? ALL of our issues stem from the exact same thing, idiots who believe everything they're told.
Just in case you are wondering, as of 18-Dec-2021, this video has 331k likes and 13k dislikes (dislikes retrieved using return youtube dislikes add-on in chrome).
I fucking hate meat so much that I eat all of them so they disappear from my sight.
This vid is so informative and condensed, I'm so glad it exists🔥🔥
I still eat beef and will not quit I'm open to lab grown meat if it good as real meat.
It's pretty hard to find this information on your own, both sides have obvious biases and both are guilty of supressing information for their own reasons. So it's good to have the facts but I already cut beef out of my diet long ago (except for special occassions or if it's about to be thrown out by the store, better that I eat it than the trashcan).
The Brazilian situation is nonsense   Amazon land is CHEAP and lobbies from Amazonian states keep it that way.   Brazil could INCREASE beef and soy production without destroying the Amazon. Plenty of arable land and pastures south of it
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old"  only true during november
Lots of lies and fake news there. Brazil does not grow cows in the rain forest, which is 84% preserved. Compare that with developed countries original forest preservation. The vast majority of the Cows in Brazil are grown in the middle part of Brazil. Not in Amazon. How can so many fake facts be presented freely? Come to Brazil and check yourself. This is just developed countries propaganda. This is disgusting. Come and check yourself. It's a crime to divulge lies like that
Vegans are great people. They sacrifice their bodies so real humans can enjoy delicious meat.
almost 14k dislikes, but i know it would be more if they allowed people to see it.  You can download a YT dislike extension for Chrome.
If you can not stop... reduce
I follow a doctor who is currently on the carnivore diet with his wife and he is very happy and healthy.
It's a shame to have omitted 2 points: -what meat brings into diet and can hardly be found elsewhere ; this would give an interesting estimate of the proportion of consommation that is a need and what is a luxury  -quantification of agricultural byproducts/waste that can be consumed by cattle and of no use to humans ; this would slightly modify the carbon (and water) cost estimate
We can eat only meat and the lies will still be lies. Meat is better than plants.
I have doubts about the statement that 65% of land used for Beef is not useful for growing crops. There are many ways to Terra-form land so it becomes useful for crops. Aztecs grew crops on floating man made islands, and fed thousands. Greenhouses can allow the growth of many crops in colder climates. The Inca grew many crops on man-made stone, and earth steps built on steep hills, and mountain slopes. Algae, and fish can be grown in large metal, or plastic tanks of water. I think your statistics are based on land that factory farms can quickly till, seed, fertilize with chemicals, and harvest (low labor) with mechanical machines. Factory farms can produce large quantities of certain foodstuffs, but at a substantial environmental cost that isn't taken into account by our capitalist system unless maintaining high production on the land is important for future profits. Otherwise these people could care less about the land, water, and air where crops are produced--- that's someone else's problem, like the locals who live there. We just want to make a profit, and don't give a damn whether the locals suffer or not. Disgusting self-centered people, borderline criminals. That's why family farms were better although possibly less efficient of producing massive quantities of certain foods, but more environmentally friendly because they lived on the land, and many grew varieties of fruits, vegetables, and farm animals for themselves, and to sell locally.
I have to disagree with you on something...which is a rarity...the part where you talk about the shipping costs of plants overseas vs eating locally. While its true that the shipping containers are more fuel-efficient, you also have to ship them directly to the stores in the same manner that a local ships their food...in the end, you are producing more CO2 by buying outsourced food, meat, or otherwise, than buying locally grown meat. In all honesty, if you want to compare apples to apples, buying locally as a vegetarian is a lot more planet safe than buying imported plants and plant products...its the same as buying meat locally vs buying meat products and imported meat. You run into fallacies when you try to compare locally produced meat vs imported veggies.  When you don't buy locally, you commit to buying foods that you arent 100% sure where they are coming from and how the food is produced...massive farms that produce veggies do produce less CO2 emissions but can destroy local ecosystems just as bad or even more than cattle by killing the local vegetation and animals in the ground.  Lastely, I feel that this vid was more of a social experiment because you are usually more thorough in your videos when it comes to research and take more of a middle stance on things like this...similar to your older meat and dairy video you did before.  Even though I disagree, I still love your content. Keep up the good work otherwise  :)
Korean subs plz
The entire world turns vegan.   What exactly will happen to all the cattle?
Hunt or fish for yourself... Or are there too many people on the planet for that
no its not ? i aint eating fkn grass u can grow and develop wihtout meats ??stupid topic af
You will own nothing and be happy.  Just eat the bugs, join the Metaverse, and die.
STOP EATING NON VEG OTHERWISE PREPARE YOUR KIDS TO WEAR MASK FOR ALL THEIR LIFES.
This sounds sponsored by 'Big Beef'
See that's the thing. "Factory Farming", as people call it, is what we call a feed lot. They don't stay inside the small sheet metal corridors that they show in those commercials. They're only in there during feeding time. The rest of the time, they ARE out in a field. Don't be naive, people. Do your research.
09:32 that graph is misleading. It would be more honest to show the data comparing over a same period of time. The reality is that it would only remove 8billion tonnes of CO2 over a year vs 50billion tonnes of emitted CO2 over a year. Showing it like in the video only makes people think that the CO2 that could be removed by planting trees is much more that we produce so the logical solution is to just plant the "spare" 3 billion hectares of land. And by misleading the public the uninformed masses will vote on repressive laws that take lands from owners to plant trees and that would be a sustainable solution, It will only hurt the economy. But that's a trend we will be seeing because of politicalization of everything.
I *love* your videos and I subscribed to your channel. Nevertheless, as a progressist and a scientist, I must in good conscience say that this clip is a misleading oversimplification: a badly flawed one, for that matter. I am not saying that it is intentionally so... however, truth be told, it is impossible to list here all the obvious problems that a simple rational analysis can find in this video! At any rate, a vegan diet is among the most innatural and harmful nutritional choices we could ever make! We are OMNIVORE mammalian primates: we have been hunters-gatherers to begin with, and only in relatively recent times we began cultivating crops. We are supposed to eat anything that is edible for us, not just plants! (Vegans can cherry-pick pseudo-scientific studies all they want, but this is a simple, solid FACT!) Moreover, if we hypothetically managed to switch the world to veganism (I'd be joining Elon Musk on Mars, in that case :) the Big Food Corporations would also switch to whatever intensive/extensive cultivation systems could afford them the highest profits, regardless of pollution, sustainability, carbon footprint, pesticides, etc.: you can bet you airbags that we would have even worse problems than we have now. Think! "It ain't the oil, it's cows' farts" benefits whom? ;)
“Cow burps are full of the powerful planet-warming gas methane, but new research finds that adding seaweed to beef cow diets can reduce their methane emissions by as much as 82 percent, reports Oliver Milman for the Guardian.”  So do this, and stop that damned fracking, and methane is no longer an issue.  Next !!
Going Vegan will cut emissions for the time being, until the population continues to grow to such a point that even the land savings don't matter. The problem is neo-liberalism with the emphasis on infinite growth. Meat has nothing to do with this issue.
This makes me want to eat a hamburger.
In Hinduism, we already have cultural values to not eat animals especially cows and beef-eating is a sin for Hindus. I feel amazed that the world is awakening now and recommending avoiding beef and eating a vegetarian diet.😃🤟
This channel talks "we could do this, we could do that, we could use land like this or like that" like the economy was a video game save managed by a single person. They talk like land wasn't owned by thousands or even millions of individuals that decide for themselves what they are going to grow in there. You can't just go to someone else's farm and say "Hey Joe, look, we decided that we are growing food more efficiently so you should grow carrots instead of raising these animals in your property". All we can do is change as consumers to try to influence the market, but people don't want to do that and they also don't want to be told what they should do with the property they own. So what are you going to do? Point a gun to their heads? If that is your solution, forcing people to do what you think is best then you are part of a bigger problem than human emissions.
Reduction on Climate impact is needed not to destroy local ecosystems.  But stopping climate change is a usless endeavour. Climate always changesa lways has always will.  It is us who need to adapt without destruction.
Only 13k dislikes on a video arguing for meat? I'm impressed
No talk about regenerative agriculture and how cows can be carbon negative, by sequestering carbon into the soil. These arguments put forward are old and outdated. Percentage of emissions is wrong, too? It’s not 26%, it’s 14-18% and a lot of that is transport. Vegan bias in this one?
The really interesting thing about confronting the Vegan argument is, if you come at it totally even handed, with your morals totally exposed, you have no choice but to agree and change your life. It's simply unarguable. Imagine that: the last time a choice for you that was so personally confronting, yet completely life altering, that you leapt in feet first and trusted the truth before you that was inevitable, stripping away your fear and believing in the process & change that millions and billions before you have also made. A lot like falling in love actually.... 🌱
I will always eat meat 🍖😋
The amount of food we feed to food, just to have nearly a billion people starving like
12 minutes video summed up in one sentence,  "Yes, meat is really THAT BAD"
Great video. But not gonna change my diet. Meat is still the best food. Although my meat intake is usually 2-3 times on average a week.
MEAT IS GUD.
13k dislikes as of now, just you guys know.
Ask the animals that are being regularly abused, tortured, get no medical help when needed from anyone because one needs to maximize their income trough other's suffering if meat is any good.
Our ancestors were do intelligent
I so wish I wasn’t gaymanorexic food to me is not life, it is fear.
Haven’t watched the vid.   The title caught my eye,   I’d have to say if you’re a cow, pig, chicken…..then meat is DEFINITELY not good.  Just sayin.
Dislike
Disappointing to see people fall for this propaganda, the US military produces as much pollution as 140 countries.  Talking about the poor eating less meat, and it will be the poor, the wealthy's diets wont change when there are industries and organisations that pollute at staggering levels without comment is very disappointing
The real question is, could we offset our emissions from eating meat if we considered eating people instead?
it bugz
* continues eating my steak fajitas *
this film is very good, I am happy with the unique story, hopefully this film will continue to be new
No, methane is not a CO2 equivalent.
I’m actually interested for marine farming as well!!!
For the fact that teacher reacted to you made my day worse
Thought provoking statement: all vitamin B supplements that vegans HAVE TO TAKE come from animals.
0:03 what about your mom  kill me
Wasn't there another video that was Pro Meat? I can't find it anywhere :/
This, in my take on the situation, is a byproduct of money hungry governments and corporations, just like everything else in the mass consumer society I was born into, and have very little say in, have been force fed mass produced future garbage mostly made by sweatshop slaves, and factory meats that have little regard to the animal or the environment. Now the world governments are going to punish the average tax payer through more regulation and tax. It’s the most perfect Ponzi scheme ever.
Eating meat while waiting for the answer
The best argument for not eating meat is not ecological but ethical. If you would not treat an animal cruelly or kill it yourself, you are not absolved from that by paying someone else to do it for you.
"No other bodily pleasure is experienced multiple times a day and never gets old " hmmm
This video appears to be full of a lot of misinformation.  Most Soy does not go to Humans because Humans are not capable of digesting it (it is mostly dietary fibre), it is a waste product that is going to release CO2 anyway to burn it but animals like Cows which have much stronger digestive systems than we do are capable of consuming it. The primary driver for Soy still remains human consumption, not animal consumption and just goes to show how wasteful things for humans actually get. Generally speaking, Humans pay more for Soy than farmers pay for animal feed, you'd be a fool to sell even 1 gram of human consumable soy to intentionally instead go towards animal consumption.  But there is just a massive issue that is straight up ignored, this is just comparing carbon but soil degradation is another issue which is very much as relevant, most crop farming has left much of the ground dirt infertile for plant life. We could be looking at most farmland today lasting only between another 50-100 harvests. There are however ways to improve soil quality, such as mixed farming which is where you rotate around what you grow on the land, you also rest the land AND graze animals on the land. While climate change does need to be delayed and slowed as much as possible, destroying most of our arable land is equally if not a potentially worse situation which is just ignored.
0:04 I could think of one
I will always eat meat no plant based diet or nothing it’s nasty and I get a headaches from not eating meat foods
I'm still not entirely convinced but when it comes to burning down forests for cattle, really, I can't ever agree with that.
It's not meat it's people. Sure, new iPhone cool, but we also are the ones who pump metric fuck tons of CO2 and Methane into the air. So my solution is the Hunger games and Squid Game being inducted into real life to get the population down to about 4 billion, less people, less food required, less carbon and methane emissions and the problem is solved.
Imagine telling ppl to change their diet while the US military pollutes more than 170 countries combined.
I clicked on this video thinking it would talk about the health implications. You should make one! Nutrition is difficult
I have such horrible food allergies that it's to the point where I can only eat meat, eggs and some cheeses.   I so dearly miss pasta, rice, and potatoes  :(
Moderation. It's that simple.
One thing I don't understand is... I see people going vegan with the intent to save the planet then Don't use cycles as a medium for transportation ... Carbon dioxide released from vehicals are far MORE dangerous than ...eating meat  And also FOOD WASTE is a huge problem as well ...   I feel like these should be highlighted more than trying to put a smoke screen on it and highlighting the people who eat meat
The title ?  I thought the video is gonna have info about how meat is harmful for human consumption
What about synthesised meats ie lab growth meats? The animal was never really alive to begin with and never needed pastures
9:23 here you compare the carbon cleaning capabilities of 3 billion hectares of land over 100 years compared to the amount of CO2 produced in one year. Not an equal comparison, this is lying with statistics. If we annualized both, the 3 billion hectares would only clean 8 billion tons of CO2 a year, about 16% of the CO2 produced in a year. So if everyone in the world went vegan and if we used the 3 billion hectacres solely for carbon cleaning, we'd still barely make a dent.  We need to focus on taxing carbon emissions instead of pressuring individuals to change their eating habits. The majority of carbon emissions are from big corporations, let's fix that first since it will have the most impact. They're the reason, they are the problem, going after them is the solution.
I wish YouTube still had the dislike button.
You will never steal my meat, otherwise i will start eating YOU
Food is a necessity but a key driver in global emissions. If you can't stop eating meat, then the next best thing to do is to reduce the quantity you consume. Reduce the consumption meat from a daily basis to maybe twice a week. That would help the planet immensely. Governments should also go after the fast food restaurants which are the main players in environment pollution and also causing a lot of people to become obese and end up eating more food than the necessary calories required. All it takes is for one human to have a realisation and change his/her habits.
I feel that maybe if Beef Cows were given the same feed as Dairy Cows it may lower the Carbon footprint. But I feel that Free Range is necessary for the animal's sake.
B3, B6, B12 ; im joke to you ?
The Vegan Teacher when she sees this: It’s my time to shine
What happened to synthetic meat grown with stem cells in a lab, I remember that being a big thing at some point in the early 2000s
Depends on how you cook the meat, well done steak is said to be trash, but medium rare is where it at.
I lost it at -70% Beef Stonks 😂
Kurzgesagt talking about food: "No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old"  People who have sex: LOL!
Español porfavor
Plant diet + Dairy and egg is sustainable. Vegan is bullshit and will cause a lot of health problems in long run. Meat is not compulsory to maintain health as some meat eaters claim.
Me: *watches this while eating beef* Also me: I see.
This convinced me. I'm going on an all beef diet
Nunca imaginei que esse canal seria contaminado por narrativas radicais e argumentos tão pífios pra defender agendas globais. Fiquei feliz por vê-lo discutir de maneira sóbria a questão dos plásticos, de Deus, mas nada é perfeito e até o Kursgesagt se corrompeu culpando o peido das vacas pelas mudanças climáticas... Pelo vídeo, parece até que, extinguindo a produção de carne, manteríamos o mesmo consumo de vegetais, ainda que o próprio vídeo declare que 1kg de batata não satisfaz nutricionalmente como 1kg de carne. Defende a agricultura local como possibilidade de solução. Claro! Por que nunca pensamos nisso antes? Vamos fazer sítios pra produtores familiares se instalarem em torno de São Paulo, Beijin, Nova Iorque e Londres pra alimentarmos essas megalópoles. Vai dar suuuuper certo...  Nunca pensei que um dia deixaria um deslike pra esse canal, massss...
Watching this while eating the most delicious beef I've had in months. Still liked the video tho. No I ain't changing my diet for you who's reading this.
Surprised how good I found this video from what I expected from the title. Like, the more animals suffer the better they are for the environment, glad that you brought that up and don't completely ignore the fact that ethics and animal welfare don't always go hand in hand with what is best for the climate/environment. I still don't like the title because I think meat is in fact bad (or at least the relationship the majority of people have with meat in the modern world is bad and destructive) and I think there are so many things that would be possible when it comes to evolving the plantbased diet to be more nutritious and mimicking meat etc. I also think cows and other animals can have a good impact on the soil and biodiversity, whether or not we eat them at some point, and I can perhaps see the point in people eating animals that would otherwise still be killed because they are considered pests and problematic when it comes to the ecosystem they are a part of. There are many practical and ethical aspects, and I don't think it's always as black and white as just being vegan vs. meat eater.
I am an vegetarian
"Food" isn't the "huge driver of emissions".  "Overpopulation" is the "huge driver of emissions". In 1920 the Earth's population was around 2 billion. Now, we're pushing 8 billion with a short stick, with most of that increase coming from the third world and east Asia. Get real.
I was surprised that the environmental repercussions of eating fish wasn’t discussed also. I’m genuinely curious!
Environmental crazies want us all to live miserable lives, but they have no problem with third world s******** doubling their population every couple of generations.
I eat meat about 12 times a year ... Sometimes it maxes out to 50. Mostly poultry. 🙃 🐔
No, I didnt even need to watch the video to know the answer.
As a vegan, I watched this video ready to be bitter and angry at the misinformation and misrepresentation of facts. I am not bitter, I am pleasantly surprised! You really hit all the relevant data points in a concise and honest way. The important thing to remember with this information is that there is no biological necessity to eat meat. It’s 100% a choice we all make. Thanks for your hard work, I’m going to resubscribe.
Cows do not burn fossil fuels. Their carbon comes from the air via plants!
An important argument has been omitted,  red meat increases cancer risks, this has been identified by several studies now.
I find it very funny that in the comment section, a bunch of meat eaters are pondering ways in which they could reduce their meat consumption, but under almost every one, I see a militant vegan telling them that it's not enough and that they are terrible people. Guys, do you not see how counter-productive this is? I've been a strict vegetarian since I was 8 years old, and even for me, these comments make me want to go buy chicken nuggets out of spite.  To all the meat-eaters who are thinking about limiting their beef consumption to once a week, or about deciding to only eat meat once a day, or about doing meat-less Mondays, or about only eating meat at restaurants and not at home,... you're doing good. Thank you for considering this change! It will be good for the planet. Another thing you could do is support any requests for your work/school cafeteria to have a day without meat or a vegetarian option available every day, this could encourage so many people at your institution to make a good choice for the environment withou even realizing it.
I mean if the cows eat meat then not really
Their mercy is so high quality. I love it :)
What about the part where you have to murder an animal to get the meat. Isn’t that bad?
Linus be like: 5:36
Tygo be like: 7:22
ha ..... joke is on you ....im in a developing country ....i cant afford beef
I will continue eat meat.
8:27 ...CANNIBALISM!!
*When scowling teenagers wearing $1000 shoes, who upgrade their smart phones every year, and that have never worked a day in their lives shriek at my parents generation, who grow and tend their own gardens, and that knit their own clothes, and tell them its all 'their fault'*
Humans are such animals they have little to no concept for the level of torture actual trillions of bodies they put their fellow animals without vocal chords thru. Black, black planet. Human's having higher intelligence than animals or being superior is an illusion given how big and bad this problem is. Actual horror movie.
If we're asking the viewers to decide for themselves what to do with the provided information, for the sake of honesty and potentially even their health, we should perhaps also say that NOT ALL PROTEINS ARE CREATED EQUAL.   "In general, animal proteins have higher protein digestibility and a better essential amino acid profile relative to dietary requirements.  These measures of protein quality indicate that animal proteins can more readily provide the daily requirement of essential amino acids than plant protein. [...]  Overall, animal-based protein food sources elicited greater anabolic responses than plant-based protein food sources. The improvement in whole-body net protein balance was due to an increase in protein synthesis with all the animal protein sources."
Meat is awesome but people eat too much of it. Also there's too many people for our richest people's lifestyle.  Please normalize pea soup again, folks.
Rubbish. You freaks have lost a mans respect. Unsubbed.
Meat is 'a marketing lie' but you talk about CO2 as though it is negative when the 'climate change' lie is the biggest since 1945!!!! Incredible.
As an orthodox Christian, we have fasting days every week (wednesday and friday) and 4 larger fasting periods (before Christmas, easter etc). I just realised a few months ago that by doing this, I'm basically vegan for more than half of the year. Guess Christians kinda had it right this time
yea but one whole cow can feed a family for a couple of weeks to a month. you need a lot more veggies to be able to match that, which could possibly require more land if the whole world went vegan.
I also wanna say, renewable energy isn’t always the best idea when it comes to the world’s alternative. The production of windmills and solar panels produces a lot of waste and pollution. You can’t power the whole world with renewable energy. Not the whole world is sunny and windy. It’s wonderful for smaller scales, but isn’t a catch all. Fun fact: Germany stopped oil and fossil fuel production, but now just imports it from nearby countries :/ Do additional research, cause I can’t explain everything here!
Two word :- Balance Diet
This video is so full of false information and wrong comparisons that I don't even know where to get started. This is sufficient to trick some kids from big cities who have never been on a farm, but everybody who has ever been on one once can see right through the bullshit. Humans cannot eat most of the parts of a soy plant but they are perfectly to feed cows. And do Avocados fly from the port into your mouth, while beef needs to be transported by truck? Have you ever been in nature and seen a natural forest where half of the trees are dead and rotting while giving their stored CO2 back into the atmosphere. CO2 from fossil fuels is the elephant in the room and not the cycle of nature.
Bring back dislikes, YouTube... I want to see the veggies cope.
Carnivore for life. I value my health ;)
thats our indian ancestors told not to eat this beef shit.  our ancestors only told us to be  vegetarian, how great they were.
Okay so kill the cows and plant trees.
Humans are omnivores and to eat vegetables and meat. That being said, I do agree on we need a new source of healthy food!
When environmentalism leads to conclusions that are obviously inhumane (like favoring factory farms over free range), we should question the "environmentalism".
A calorie of beef does not equal a calorie of potatoes.  Protein, fat, and carbs have drastically different nutritional values.  Also, CO2 is not a pollutant.  It is to plants what 02 is to animals.  We like plants, right?
You are free to eat whatever you want. Nobody can ever tax your mind.
When ever there is problem summon our gloriously smart leader Kurzgesagt
Great Channel, awesome videos as always, education making it fun compact and simple to understand with a balanced view 👍
Some of this is 'bullshit' eg at 6.40 it outright says that crueller farming practices can 'sometimes' be less destructive for the planet, but it just exaggerated that for effect. Factory fed cows produce waaay more carbon emissions than grass fed beef. The less cruel farming practice *is* the better practice for carbon emissions. In other words, eat grass fed beef if you're going to have beef.
The quality of meat has been dropping for the last several years and it got to a point where one night I had really bad Texas BBQ and I gave up meat the next day. Haven't looked back since and I haven't craved meat for many years now, especially with modern meat alternatives. I think people would be surprised with how fast their tastes and preferences can adjust. I personally have also found many more creative ways to eat and enjoy food without meat. I hope people don't get hung up on worrying if they'll miss their childhood favorites, and I understand it's difficult to switch your whole diet and lifestyle around (trust me because I did it) and it's really not that bad at all.   I also appreciate the scholarly sources listed for every video on this channel.
Beef patty and emissions  or vegetable patty and high oxidization and a correlation with increased heart disease.
This is not the point. Would you eat your dog or cat? Why then eat a cow? It takes an insane amount of food and water to feed a cow before it becomes beef. It will take so much pressure of the earth if people ate only plant based foods...
Guys... just enjoy your lives and eat what you want. When the situation actually gets serious everything that pollutes and isn't 100% necessary will be fucking illegal. Then when we all have to stop at once we might even make a change. So go out there and enjoy a good stake while you still can, go drive a huge ass tractor from the 1960's while you still can!
My proposal: lower the global population of humans. We don't need to exist in every corner of the globe...
With how expensive beef has been getting lately isn't as hard a switch these days...
This is all pretty interesting to know! But nothing is going to make that dead cow any less tasty so imma eat it😋
i hate my life :D
Sorry for bringing doom to our planet, but I like meat
Feeding cows seaweed could cut their methane emissions by 82%, scientists say. ... Researchers who put a small amount of seaweed into the feed of cattle over the course of five months found that the new diet caused the bovines to belch out 82% less methane...
Who knows this video has 1 million dislikes. Lol, you wouldn't know.
Lol, the only people telling you that meat is bad for you are millionaire, and billionaire elites like me, who want you to eat bugs, live in a pod, and live in the metaverse. Also the blue hair people who claim 15 other genders are saying that too. All in an attempt for us to be able to horde the meat for ourselves, while you suffer. Lol
"Vegans have never been able to define or measure that their diet causes less deaths/suffering than an omnivorous one. They are ignorantly contributing to an absolute bloodbath of trillions of zooplankton, mites, worms, crickets, grasshoppers, snails, frogs, turtles, rats, squirrels, possum, raccoons, moles, rabbits, boars, deer, 75% of insect biomass, half of all bird species and 20,000 humans per year. Two grass-fed cows are enough to feed someone for a year and, if managed properly, can restore biodiversity.  Vegans likely exploit more animals than the average person. The Vegan Society officially rejects beekeeping, but many commercial crops require to be pollinated by domestic bees that are forced to breed, shipped around and then worked to death. It's principally impossible to have a nutritionally complete vegan diet without forced pollination, but fodder crops do not exploit bees. As a result, human food crops kill five times as many bees as all livestock slaughter combined and directly support honey production (taking excess honey is necessary for colony health).   Since vegans somehow manage to justify systematically poisoning and torturing insects by arbitrarily declaring that they can't suffer ("sentience"), they might aswell consider eating them. The same goes for bivalves, since there's about as much evidence that they feel pain as there is for plants."  (This is obviously about the ethical aspect rather than environmental)
👎
Great video, learnt a lot!
So the answer is yes but it's cowardice to not say so
What about cultured meat?
muh emissions I'm not going vegan because of cow farts...
great, we all kind of knew that beef was bad for emissions, but it's not even relevant to discuss, because the world will never come together and stop eating meat.
I will not eat the bugs, I will not live in the pod.
so ur saying just a beef free diet could free up 2 billion hecctares but we could still eat chicken and lamb and pork?
This video made me hungry imma get some stakes
Nothing changes, the rich will afford to eat meat and fish, the poor will make do with what they can afford. We are running out of fish and phosphorus anyway so sooner or later the world population must reduce or change diet.
You forgot about amino acids, protein isnt equal, meat has much better protein profile than any plant based one, best way to reduce co2 emissions is if we use hempcrete and wood to build houses because it helps store co2 in the buildings walls.
If there was an alien creature made of plants. They will look at vegan as mass murderers.
What they don't teach anymore in schools is the importance of taking into account the biases of your author(s)'s when taking in information. Who is this channel's authors? What do we know about their biases. Because we know that for sure everyone has biases. I think it's safe to say the person paying the most money in the company is the one calling the shots about what information and topics gets picked. In this case this channel is fully funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Recently came out that Bill gave 137 million dollars to news outlets, so I'm gonna go ahead and say he's probably not politically neutral but has a very extreme opinions on global warming if he's willing to pay news outlets. And at such a high cost! Not to mention he had said in an early 2020 interview that Covid was a good thing to happen to us and thought that reducing the population was encouraged. I love how these billionaires like bill, Zuckerberg, Bezos, and others who's names are not as popular,  think that they know what's best for the rest of the world and that they can call the shots because they have money. I guess when you. have that much money you start to believe you are special. So arrogant... As if the capitalist system is a valuable tool for measuring of a person's sound humanitarian judgement. Whose to say the population SHOULD be reduced? Personally if there is one billionaire I like it's Elon, his views are much more logical than 'lets kill off portions of our species', we should just keep populating normally and become a multi-planetary species. I always wondered how humans  even began existing on this planet. Because we are fairly new to this world and a young species compared to the age of the planet. Maybe the first humans were like seeds being planted in a new world by another more advanced human species from another planet. But I think I'm getting a bit too science fiction-y now so I'll stop lol
It's interesting to me that with a thorough investigation of the research done on nutrition, the more healthful diet option is a high fat low carbohydrate (HFLC) way of eating that is full of animal products. To me, an approach to improve or resolve these climate related issues within our food systems must include increasing the amount of animal products in our diets while decreasing the amount of non-animal products in our diets. Otherwise, what's the point?? You'd only be encouraging the health crisis issues sweeping the globe right now to worsen. Remember, do no harm. And it's beef that is the solution to that problem. So this video seems lopsided to me. Incomplete.  That being said, I do still love the channel. I have your poster on my wall!
What about fishes?
atm 327k likes and 13k dislikes, which is pretty positive. install the extension to bring the dislike back.
my mom made me go vegetarian. i don’t have any other choice. when i’m old enough, i’ll finally be able to eat how i want. i miss chicken.
do trees not consume the co2 to live?
i have been vegan since i was a teenager (nearly 10 years), i don't support people eating animal products in general, but I would like to say that you  don't have to completely cut them out to make a difference, people eat way to much meat and dairy in developed countries as it is, so just cutting down to eating meat a couple times a week from twice a day will make a huge difference, if everyone did this the planet would be way better off and factory farms that treat animals horribly wouldn't be necessary
Lots of falsehoods in this video. 1 of the biggest being that clearing a forest for grassland results in massive Carbon loss from the soil and permanently damages its future storage potential. In reality forest soils have very little carbon storage in comparison to other biomes. Carbon storage in soils is related to the amount put in thru plants/bio and amount lost thru microbial use. Forest have poor plant undergrowth. Trees themselves have large lignin heavy slow growing root systems that add very little to soil carbon. In fact they can be a net negative since they suck large amounts of moisture from the soil (transpiration). The wetter the soil the more carbon can build up since you switch to anaerobic microbial process. So in reality clearing a forest for a grazed grassland pasture can increase soil carbon by a massive factor. It will increase the carbon input massively thru life/death cycle of fine rootsystems of pasture grasses. The cows waste also adds to the system thru increased carbon/ fauna/ microbial. The soil will become wetter and more productive to carbon storage because the grasses dont extract the amount of groundwater that trees do and the water table will rise. You really have to do a proper carbon budget and there is a ton of context missing from this video.
There's a fatal flaw with this train of thought: the idea that more efficient food production will lead to people conserving land. That isn't how people behave, and there are many historical examples of this. When people are able to farm more efficiently, they don't use less land; instead, they just continue using all the same land and just produce more crops. And not only is this empirically true, it also makes perfect sense in terms of the incentives people chase after, and the short-sighted, self-centered decision-making processes they employ. And given that more efficient agriculture really leads to more production rather than less land usage, you then have to ask yourself whether you truly believe that higher production is more environmentally friendly - and I'm willing to bet that you don't.

Watching this video while eating meat
TL;DW it is.
What about sea food
did anyone else hear pvz music
MEAT IS THE BEST. I EAT ONLY MEAT EVERY DAY ALL DAY!!!!
Painful to see Brazil being portrayed in such a bad way. Not a lie though, our government gives 0 sh*t about the enviroment and our situation is horrible
9:35 So you're telling me that if we even just let idk 500 million hectares we'd be able to cover our entire carbon footprint minus the methane?
Yea, exept you will miss essential amino acids and become fat.
Completely omitting the proper human diet dietary necessities on a video like this is just turns it into a terrible misinformation effort servingt vegan propaganda.  If your objective is just lowering lifee expectancy 20 years by promoting carb-based diets with abismal protein presence that will certainly lower carbon emissions.
Hold on what do you mean by carbon budget? I've actually never heard that term before. When it comes to a "carbon budget" I would recommend people go look up what carbon levels were about 7500 years ago.
If someone argues against something purely from an emotional position, you shouldn't take them seriously.
nie chce mi się pisac po angielsku wiec sobie przetlumacz baranie 4:51 jakim kurwa prawem porównujesz mięso rozwożone po całym mieście, ze statkiem który przypłynął do doków? rozumiem że kurwa po warzywa zapierdalamy do portów morskich wybierać z kontenera?  taka sama ilość CO2 idzie na rozwiezienie mięsa jak i warzyw cymbale
Whenever you make a new video on this topic, would you consider the quality of the protein? Because even 50g of protein doesn't mean the same, in face of absorption and amino acid composition.
I'm just here for the art
Devin's cow says it's bad.
I’ve said it time again. Vegans only exist in modern day due to the privilege of grocery stores. Without them finding each individual crop, fruit , vegetable would be impossible in the wilderness. In other words, 9/10 they’d be eating meat. Animals roaming everywhere to hunt vs trying to gather berries for a salad.   Vegan is a lie in comparison to Omnivore eating habits, as its more natural to our bodies digestion. Also, some vegan foods are high in GMO’s and pesticides. Less nutrient dense foods means less energy, less healthy. We’re now seeing this fundamental difference.
Kurzgesagt, do you all think true veganism is healthy for the lifetime of a human? I've been told that meat has nutrients that plants don't and by being vegan will put a person in a slow state of declining health.
food waste is a massive issue too in creating CO2 emissions. why isn't this being talked about? its something which can be worked on on top of this to reduce the burden of global warming.
wait so its removes 800 biljon tons of co2 in 100 yeas and we produce 50 bilion tons of co2 in 1 yea that is stil al loss ?!?!?!?!?!?
Since we are not just animal, let's not act just like animal. It is time to start thinking about what we eat. Let's eat if we have to, let's not eat because we want to. 🙏🙏
I love meat
Why are some of use getting super smart in here like im a nerd of some stuff
HE THICK
Ya
Has anyone gone vegan after watching this video?
What will happen to the farming animals if we stop eating meat? Will cows, pigs and chicken die out, will they be preserved and culled?
The best solution is to allow Euthanasia, or the option to kill ourselves peacefully and painless. So we can also be able to say goodbye to our love ones, plan the funeral, etc.
Beef doesn't mess with my digestive system. Tofu stops up the works like a bag of bricks.
there are history and cultural factors when it comes to cuisine. Not everything needs to be an outrage about energy usage.
some alternatives to going vegan: outlaw beef and lamb. throw livestock farming ethics out the window if it means it lowers emissions. reforest every area possible with bamboo. start further domesticating insects for consumption. trying to improve living conditions for humans in areas with large population grows so ppl will have less kids there
We need to invent replicators like in Star Trek. Didn't those things use basically any matter to convert it into food or was it also partially recycled matter.
For real? there is an argument that eating meat cause climate changed, and people believe that so blind that this video have to be created? XDDD humanity is lost.
9:30 This graph seems a bit misleading, since according to it, we would produce 5 trillion tonnes over the same period of 100 years.
Love this channel.
4:20 - That bit about avocados (and other plant-based foods) being transported mostly by "insanely efficient" container ships is BULLSHIT. When transported internationally, _perishable_ plant-based foods like fresh fruit and vegetables are more commonly packed on to jet aircraft. This has a _much_ higher carbon footprint. So kilojoule for kilojoule, your oranges (imported so you could eat them out of season) might be worse for the planet than your steak (especially if the cow was raised on pasture).
ಠ_ಠ i am  a fockin meat eater
I’m never gonna be vegen
Make video on water use of foods.
I haven't tried beef in my life and I think we could enough meat from other animals
Hunting game and processing the meat yourself is the most environmentally friendly.
Not sure that meat is good or bad but i can be sure vegans will dislike this vid
This made me really hungry for burgers
so what about fish and shellfish?
🙏🙏🙏🙏
go in chrome web store and type youtube dislike return then u add it then u will get it this video have 19k dislike thanks me later
question, for emssions as much as beef are burping and farting is their methane production that much different from the methant production of previosly existing bovines ie for the americas Bison? would they  not have produced similar amounds of greenhouse gas while they roamed the plains, in which case isnt it unfair to single out cattle and not include the emission rates for other bovines like the aforementioned bison of the americas and the cape buffalo of southern africa
I think one of the problems with the land-freeing-up argument is that it seems to me very unlikely that land will ever be “freed up” - if we really see less demand for farmlands they will just be bought up to build whatever things rich people and businesses want to build, unless the government takes a big step in buying the land and converting it to parks
I understand that this video was focused on CO2, but personally I don’t see chicken as a better option than beef since chickens have the worst living conditions of any meat animal.
So even if were to eliminate meat and fill that 3 billion hectors completely full of trees, it can only absorb 800 billion as to the 5000 billion produced by us? That's like like the difference between buying local vs shipped meat.
people think we are destroying the planet , no we aren't. planet is here to stay but ignorant people who kill innocent animals won't .
Mostly false
I like meat, especially beef (I mean steaks, BBQ and stuff is so yummy). But for 2 years now I have largely reduced my red meat consumption.  I switched from a diet with a lot of beef to mainly chicken (and pork a bit). I went from eating beef almost every day to 2-3 times a month. And... I don't  really miss it in the end. I appreciate the moments I eat beef and don't take it for granted. I now consider it as a delicacy.  At the same time I am trying more and more to have vegetarian or vegan lunches.  I'll be honest though, I don't think I will be able to switch to a full vegetarian or vegan diet any time soon. I am also aware regarding animal cruelty, that the fact I still eat chicken is not great.  If we could eat less meat in general it would just be better on so many aspects. Cutting red meat is way more easy than I thought and I think is a good start for people who want to think a bit about climate change.
Another solution is lab meat, as i imagine that would significantly reduce carbon production from the meat since you're not growing a whole animal, just the part you intend to eat. Would also free up farmland that can't be used for human food production to be used for foresting like you said (Which honestly, given what was said in this video would probably save the earth from impending climate disaster) Sure, some will refuse to change their farming lifestyle. But once lab meat is cheap to produce and plentiful, it'll likely be easy for people to switch to it rather than real meat, and it might end up as a luxury product one day.  In short: Lab meat will reduce the demand for animals bred for meat.
So to me I don't consider 'eating meat is my choice' I think it shouldn't be allowed. If I was to say I think raping children is okay and it's my personal choice, then understandably I would be receiving lots of hate and most likely I would be attacked. Rightly so. Because raping children is bad there is no Ifs or buts no exceptions and no opinion to it. I have the same feelings towards animal cruelty and meat as a whole. Animals have one chance at life on this world and they get tortured and treating so cruelly before receiving awful death. Eating meat can't be a personal choice because it's not a personal choice for that animal who just wants to live. We wouldn't want the aliens to come down to us, do with us what they wanted and treat us like shit so we shouldn't do the same with animals. We don't need to eat them to survive so we simply shouldn't. You are eating something that will give you a few minutes of sensory pleasure. A few minutes for you but a lifetime of suffering for them. Please I urge everyone to research into veganism and educate yourself on the truth and realise all the cruelty that goes on
I eat meat, love the stuff. if others don't want to. Up to them, just leave me the fuck alone to eat what I want.
"...it could remove about 800 billion Tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere over 100 years. By comparison we emit 50 billion Tonnes of C02 equivalence per year atm."  Why did you PURPOSFULLY shift from a 100-year time scale to a 1-year time scale?  You even showed a graph of the 100-year CO2 emissions from a global vegan diet agasint a 1-year...I'll say it again 1-YEAR scale... wtf is this? It appears you are intentionally trying to compare 800 to 50 without context....  800 Tonnes over 100 years...800/100 is 8/1 or 8 Tonnes per year...I have real concern about you intention with this presentation.  You IMMEDIATLY juxtaposed this figure ("800 billions Tonnes over 100 years) against 50 billon Tonnes per year.... it's not 800 compared to 50 as you displayed (with a graph no less...this is clearly intentional)...the real comparison is, based on what you a presenting in the proper context...smh, we'd save 8 Tonnes per year by shifting to a global vegan diet.   Global vegan diet: Frees up 3 billion hectares, saves us 8 billon Tonnes of CO2, were still churning out 50 billion...we still produce 42 billion Tonnes of CO2 (instead of 50 billion Tonnes) if we all go vegan...there, now decide what you want to do with that information that has the proper context.
Listen, most if not all of these problems with food production can be solved.   but that would take money that big businesses do not want to spend to make it better.  Number 1 cause of global warming is greedy humans.
Theres different ways of converting methane to co2 equivalents. The old one was way worse than the one science now recommends. Not sure which one is used for this video.  A constant number of cattle in the world will have a constant methane concentration in the atmosphere. A change in population of cattle will have a rather large impact in the short term.
Is it disingenuous to compare removing 800 Billion tonnes of Co2/ 100 years With the human production of ~50 Billion tonnes/ year?  Why not compare year-to-year or 100yrs/100yrs ?
@Vian Abdullah:   There is a chrome extension that still lets you see the numbers. It's called "Return YouTube Dislike". Google still provides API access to this information so developers are still able to access it and make extension to make it visible for us.   (For some reason I was unable to reply to your comment directly).
Good thing I don't care about climate change, since I turned to meat only diet I lost 15 kgs and I'm much more healthier than was before eating high processed food. I will never stop eating meat.
This isn't going to be popular...stop having kids. Caveat, stop having more than two kids...replacement value for you and your spouse alone is enough. Unchecked growth in anything, anything, tends to lead to bad things. We're starting to see struggles with 7.5 billion people...can our planet sustain 75 billion? 750 billion? If you don't like people eating beef, stop making people...what's our carbon footprint per gram of protein...I bet it's a lot higher than cows.... Just FOOD for thought. Get mad if you want, but don't @ me.
So 2 things you didn't mention.  The first is that the vast majority of plants have parts not fit for human consumption.  Most farm animals actually can process the whole plant and most farmers process what can't be used for people into feed for the animals.  The second thing is general health when it comes to meat alternatives.  A typical veggie or "impossible" burger not only contributes to plant waste since humans can't process much of the plants used to make that patty, but the ingredient list is much more complex and the calorie count is often over double for beef.  The last thing we need as a species known for overeating is more calories in the same amount of food.
And yet beef is still the best thing going.
Yeah sorry to say it bud but Im still eating meat.™️
I'd be interested to hear more about regenerative cattle farming practices... General Mills funded a study that showed beef can be raised carbon negative. I'd like someone smarter than I to critically review it.
Next do electric cars and the ecological cost of those.
The local part of the video is misleading. Buying local does significantly reduce emissions, but for some reason Kurzgesagt skewed the data and fit it into a pro CORP narrative. Im disappointed in this channel, one that I thought was largely infallible.
What software do they use to make such a beautiful video?
When you dig deep into this argument, the claim doesn't hold up too well. Nutritional density for example is completely ignored. There is recent research where methane is reduced by something like 75 to 80 per cent with additives in feed. Is this an other vegan plant food campaign?
Lab grown meat will save us
You will own nothing, you will live in pods, you will eat bugs and you will be happy- The World Economic Forum
Nuclear power (specifically LFTR) solves literally every supposed problem from this video.
All this is sounds great but modern human exists for ~12.000 years and his diet was always meat,fruit and vegetables. Changing the diet to fully vegeterian might not be suitable for our race and that cannot be seen in the short term because some vegan decided to cut out animal products for a couple of years.
I need meat. I especially need red meat. I once tried cutting red meat out of my diet because white meat is easier for me to digest. However, I began to frequently feel feint and have blackouts. When I got my blood tested, I was told I had an iron deficiency. I could possibly take iron supplements, but I have a hard enough time dealing with the acid reflux and heartburn problems I already have.
meat is delicious
I suggest to make a video about where we are with the research for meat alternatives  Nice video. I'm glad you cite resources.
Made me order a beef n bacon burger watching all that tasty animation about meat.
interesting
Honestly, I love meat a lot, I love to eat it, it's yummy, it's delicious, but most people constantly debate the topic on the half of animal cruelty, and I'm under the mindset that food is food, as long as the animal isn't suffering in it's lifetime to provide for us I'm not fussed, animals hunt other animals, we're omnivorous so the argument always fell flat for me if the animal was cared for.  THIS though, THIS being explained, shown and analysed for me really for once turned the little gears in my mind of maybe going vegan or vegetarian isn't that bad for the greater good of the planet.  The fact we can't lower our footprint unless the animals are treated cruelly breaks my heart, and the amount of land and produce that goes towards maintaing those animals is insane. Even if I cut down my consumption of meat to only special occasions rather than daily consumption- it'll make a massive change if many more people do the same. A % of some going partially vegan/vegetarian is greater than one person doing it perfectly alone.  Meat is just easy to cook, and tastes good, but lately I've been volunteering at a place that cooks free lunches for us and it's vegetarian by default- and weirdly enough it's some of the most tastiest stuff I've eaten, and it isn't that complicated. I feel like the more I'm educated in a subtle or interesting way- the more interested I am in making the adjustments.  Even a diet with less red meat would help the planet so much, it's incredibly insane. Luckily I eat mostly pork or chicken as is, which has significant less impact but just god damn, I'm still shook by those numbers. Also I'm lactose intolerant so bonus points for that I suppose XD (Not that it stops me 50% of the time...)
most mid to late teenagers disagreed with the opening statement.
u assume i care. i will eat what i want, when i want, where I want.
Its a losing battle anyways, carbon emissions will always be more than our carbon budget, eat whatever you want.
being informed before making a desicion is a good thing, reducing our own carbon footprint is great for the planet, but as long as 1 country is there being the biggest polluter of the world there is really little one can do.
thats sad im not going vegan
That's fortunate. I've been bashed multiple times by my climate-obsessed friends about my meat consumption (I'm a semi-carnivore, as I dislike most vegetables), but it appears it isn't that bad after all, as I predominantly eat poultery and pork - beef only on very rare occasions. Overall I think that beef consumption is much higher in USA than in Europe due to cuisine differences, but I may be wrong on that one.
Honestly, it will be a really good day when we don't have to kill animals for meat and we can stop having to farm them. I'm all for lab grown meat, well... the development of it anyway. Not quite there yet for me to replace it. I do tend to go for pork or poultry over beef anyway though
I would die for a Star Trek: TNG Replicator, imagine an atomic copier that could scan and replicate any food your heart desired. It would solve world hunger and clean up at least 25% of the mess we're creating on Earth guilt free, a nice juicy steak without death, vegetables without eroding lands to death. It would be the best invention in human history.
I cant believe that people eat that much meat...
Ive decided to fuck climate change
Noce
Damn. Pretty irrefutable that I should eventually go vegetarian
God I’m dying to know what the dislike bar would’ve looked like on this one.
How can you claim to represent anything other than the worthless services who now sponsor you?
The obvious bias in this video is well, obvious.
I've taken away only one thing from this video that will solve all the issues: cause the extinction of all livestock.
I really love that they dont state their opinion or hold a position their neutral and are just stating facts for us to understand about the topic
You forgot mass antibiotic use within the industry. kind of important...
If you only ate meat, water, and possibly vitamin supplements you would feel more physically and mentally healthy than on any other diet, and it boosts your immune system greatly. Research the carnivore diet before you judge
As the making of this comment the video has 324.617 likes and 13.003 dislikes, wich is about 1 dislike for every 25 likes.
Overall, meat is bad, period. You are what you eat (⌐■-■)
Born vegetarian. Raised by scientists who are vegetarian. Love the video.
The problem is being vegan makes people hate humans who dont follow veganism this is a huge problem and causes severe fractures in human brotherhood than any damage eating animals ever did.
Food for thought..
Consider talking about lab grown meat :) it tastes like real meat because it is real meat without the environmental (or ethical) issues
When we talk about meat; we need to assume that it’s all gathered/hunted individually, not purchased at a store.  We all agree BUYING it is horrible, so let’s limit the discussion to hunting only.  Then we can just focus on the health effects, and then once that’s agreed upon, THEN we can talk about “buying” meat… which again, most people agree you shouldn’t do.
So what you are saying is instead of changing our way of life we should go to war with Brazil, take their land and use it only for farming CO2 from the atmosphere to make up our own carbon footprint and other third world countries, I mean think about it what is the lose of some human life for the betterment of our environment
Not all meat eaters are created equal.   People from the Americas, Europe, China, Russia, and Australia consumes 4x more meat per person than those from Africa and the rest of Asia.
To me we need to check sustainability in energy before we touch meat. Is just obvious
Did I catch that right?  800B Tonnes removed over 100 years, then 50B Tonn produced PER YEAR.  Isn't it a little funky to have two different time scales for the two bars? Wouldn't that mean we still are still netting 4200B Tonnes in 100y even with the added grass land?
Climate change is not why we buy beef locally, it's for economic and culture reasons. Nobody wants to see our local cows not happy, or their farmer struggling to compete with MegaMeatCorp
Climate change isn't real
Well,here you go,Mr.&Mrs. '"Vegans have gone crazy". Perhaps it's time to stop ruining the world and quit the cruelty. ;)
It is well known fact that the figures are inflated for meat production. The meat production used entire lifecycle calculations yet the plant production only used a portion of the lifecycle. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, just 4.2 percent of greenhouse gas emissions are from livestock agriculture, with beef contributing 1.4 percent. Many people I know tried to go vegan or vegetarian with disastourous effects on their health. They got sick and had to start eating red meat again.
I feel like there is a lot of low level misleading or lying going on here. Avocados come to your local shop on container ships while beef is hauled there on trucks... but how do the avocados get from the docks to your local shop? Does beef get better if it's from Australia or Argentina and gets transported most of the way in containers on super efficient ships? It felt like a false or oversimplified argument.    And then there is the matter of pigs...   Pigs eat exclusively feed crops??? Anyone who has seen pigs on small farms knows that pigs eat absolutely anything. True omnivores. They eat people, garbage, feed crops, grass, weeds... anything.  Unlike ruminants they are monogastric and so not optimized for grass consumption... but to say they exclusively eat feed crops is to say something not true--in other words, it's a lie.   Not the best effort. I want to feel like I learned something from this, but I can't trust it.
I’m currently working on a self project to see what the health benefits are of a meat based diet. Overall feel seems promising. Obviously cutting sugars and carbs is generally a good idea, but I’m also excluding fibers from plants. So far almost a month in, I’ve lost a significant amount of weight, eat until I’m full and never feel bloated. This is all just an anecdote, but I’m working on producing real world results with blood work. My hypothesis is that a meat based diet may be better than a plant based diet for certain people. If my data points to that being the case for my one data point, then for my personal arguments, I would include that in discussions regarding carbon footprint. I’d argue personal health far outweighs an ambiguous number that does not reflect your real world impact on the environment. Especially when there are countries that produce some of the most pollution and don’t report accurately how processing is done.
Lol what kind of idiot thinks meat is bad for you?
Solution: less humans
I'd like see the dislike count 😂
I don't even think I ate beef a single time in my life
tbh I genuinely think the future of people food is gonna be insects I dont say that cause I WANT it to be true I just think thats how its gonna turn out
I'm actually more interested in pork and chickens than beef, but I'm glad I watched what I watched. One question, though. Can't we use methane as fuel? I heard that in India (I could be wrong, t'was a short snippet) some people managed to use cow poop as fuel for their furnaces and heating.
Do you guys know farts of the animals is the same gas that plant release while decomposing
So now you guys want to eat soy grass or plant am I listening a person who has no brain or he thinks their audience has no brain do you know the soy you are talking about can't be consumed by humans because they are plants not soy them selve
A lot of people hear information like this and think "oh man I don't think I can go vegetarian/vegan that sounds expensive/difficult/etc." But people don't have to go completely vegetarian/vegan to make an impact! Imagine if more people just cut out meat for one day of the week. Or even just occasionally picking a vegetarian option at a restaurant. Small decisions like that could make a big difference.
as much as i love kurzgesagt and learned so much from them, i have to disagree(just to share my perspective) with some points. like the carbon emissions of locally sourced stuffs. you can safely assume there are way more people who are further from the nearest market than those closer to it especially in developing countries, which a larger chunk of human population is in, where there are lesser numbers of facilities for distributing commodities to the masses. which would consume more fuel? each houselhold in a community traveling to the same market just to get basically the same or similar kinds of food? or a handful of nearer local producers and distributors delivering those same stuffs to each of those same households? extreme examples for the sake of comparisson would be the difference between that of everyone growing their own food on their backyard with that of everyone going to the same market to get food, which system would consume more fuel?  and raising cattle, for the most part, is carbon neutral because the carbon they emit are the very same carbon the plants they consumed absorbed in the atmosphere. so they're just farting back carbon from where it came from. applying the logic that a cow's carbon emission is large because it farts also applies to every other animal. an adult human on average exhales about 1kg of carbon dioxide a day, given that we are billions then that's a couple thousand tons of carbon dioxide in a day. and humanity is just a negligible percentage of earth's biomass, just imagine how much carbon the entirety of earth's biomass emit on the daily through respiration (yes, even plants do it).   the main culprit for the increasing carbon content in the atmosphere are fossil fuels being burned, reintroducing carbon from the remains of ancient life, trapped beneath the earth, has absorbed. it creates an imbalance where there's more carbon emitted to the atmosphere than being absorbed from it.  the solution would be to restore balance, how to do it? decrease carbon emissions by shifting to carbon neutral fuels and developing more efficient ways on how we use energy from the fuels we burn and increase the carbon absorption by growing (planting is merely a part of it) trees(fruit bearing oned would be smart). would it be a logistics nightmare? possiby... would it be worth it? worth more than a participation trophy by bitching about world issues, pointing out who or what to blame and attacking anyone who disagrees but failing to offer a viable solution thereof, let alone participate in it.
You are talking about transport I think transport will be needed for beef or vegetable equally you talk about deforestation so castles don't live in forest they live on grass land by the way crops grow in forest land am I right
This is the only beef vegans have
I actually enjoyed the video and didn't dislike it, but I'd actually prefer to see the effects of videos like these receiving millions of views (5 Million at the time of this comment) and shares and more views in the future along with the number of other multi million views on this channel and all the other channels explaining climate change to me...taken into consideration that maybe not every view is a new view, but this is millions of people, using electricity, using fossil fuels to make the things that use the electricity to watch these videos...let's discuss whether or not me eating meat is worse than a channel with 17 million subscribers that receives millions of views per day, which is worse for the environment?  Again I do really like this channel, just thinking critically and I am genuinely curious.
People have been eating meat and farming for thousands of years, the only part that affects the climate is the scale on which it's consumed now. The world is overpopulated.
Gonna hit you with the don't care didn't ask.
Humans fart and burp to and there is over 7 billion of us and veggies make us more gasy
honestly as long as the plant version of meat products tastes almost the same and gives at least 3/4 of the carbs and such things like that, then it might be a good thing to buy. then again, i havent really looked into stuff like that very well, and a plant substitute like that may not even exist yet
Here's another idea. How about we genetically engineer cows to not produce methane? I'm not entirely sure what is involved (Other than a quick Google search, and the idea isn't original). I know that only some humans produce methane from digestion. Why is this not the case with cows, and can we change it?
Liked the video! Seemed very unbiased and fact-based.
No American can survive without beef especially cow.
I got to ask though, how is transport of freight ships calculated? I thought they use  the nasty remains of an oil refinery because no one else can use it. So it shoots out the dirtiest type of gases?
Well, I'm gonna still chug down meat as much as I can handle and stay healthy. Because I love it.
”No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old." - I beg to differ.
I HATE MEAT
lol cow methane. tell them about how there were more buffalo than cow before we slaughtered them so the emissions is null.
Methane doesn’t attenuate in the infrared. Explain how it is a greenhouse gas. It decomposes into CO2 via combustion, and I don’t see a lot of fire in the sky.
This is not what I wanted to see. Let’s go Brandon
Great video, but I do have a question about the crops that are grown to feed livestock. My understanding is that much of the plant that we can't eat, such as stalks and husks, are edible by livestock; meaning they can turn the parts of plants that we can't consume into highly energy dense food. How much of the crops used to feed livestock is also edible by humans, and how much of it is parts of the crop we couldn't consume anyway?
I think if you're going to start somewhere, it's replacing pork with anything else really. Pigs have shown to understand they're going to die, fear that death, and even get depressed about it, cows idk are on that scale. Pigs should be one of the last animals we need to be eating, they're WAY too aware
Imo giving up meat or reducing it isn't necessary,  the issue is there's so much in spoils from producing so much factory farm meat, it never gets eaten. If American big farms produced 20 percent less meat in 10 years, there's probably be no noticable difference in availability. So really the food needs to be distributed more efficiently. We all know of stores throwing out perfectly fine food.
So you are saying Thanos cured climate change hahahahhahahahaha
I'm a little dissapointed that this video is giving the illusion of responsibility. More people are vegan now then in the history of humanity, also food emissions have never been higher. There is no ethical consumption under capitalism.
The number 1 thing I've always wondered is what do we do with the cows if majority of humans became vegetarian? Like are we suppose to kill the cattle considering there is over a billion cows?
Not at all, it taste good
The answer is actually: control population growth!!! Fewer people, less food need. But of course, capitalism would never accept fewer buyers, even if that means destroying the world.
You needed to include info about water use, also. Growing most cereal crops uses far less water than farming animals.
Would be nice with some focus on how much greater output we could get from ''building'' farm land in storages(waterponics i think its called) and in addition how much space we could save up for those forest and wildlands your are mentioning. I think the numbers would favor going plantbased or veggie even more :)
I would love to see Kurzgesagt and What I've Learned have a discussion on this topic. I feel like they're coming at the topic from different places but are tackling broadly the same issues. It would be a very interesting discussion
I stopped eating beef
The valley between the point of the video and the implication of the thumbnail is incredible.
I'm not vegan or vegetarian but i do try amd cut down on meat due to health reasons. So i try to eat as much "healthy" meats as possible. Like chicken or lean pork.
In min 4:40 you say that "1kg of beef from your local butcher will come in at 18 kg in CO2 equivalents at least." I don't understand if you are talking about the emission of transport or the emission of beef in general. And if it's about the transport how you got the number 18 kg in CO2.
i'm not a vegetarian or vegan but i personally think a lot of vegetarian or vegan foods just taste better than most meat anyway so i rarely eat meat, the only meat that i really like is chicken and from the looks of it that's not so bad anyway
It's actually funny to watch this in the pandemic with ridiculous inflation and meat prices sky-rocketing every week. People are not even buying beef in my country.
What do you mean having to eat never gets old... I would love to not have to eat as much. Its a chore more than anything.. 😅
Let's ignore the fact vegetation absorbs emissions and animals eat vegetation.  The carbon cycle is amazing!
As methane just gets converted to CO2 in the atmosphere, the long-term damage is still the same as the mass of carbon. Imagine instead we had a world which output 1 units of CH4, and subtracted 2 units of CO2. Then those same "carbon equivalents" would give a very distorted view of things. Much the same can be said about using natural gas as fuel as it's just going to leak to the atmosphere anyway.
NO. Meat is _ESSENTIAL_ for everyone for the correct Fats and Iron that No Laboratory will ever replace. Ever.
The hilarious thing is when some people that drink enormous quantities of soy milk claim they're saving the planet. Well, the amazon is being literally chopped down to plant soy beans lmao
We should just hunt our own food. After all we're not complaining about the wild animals that have carbon footprints. We should turn all the land form animals into grassland, forests and let wild animals take over, then if you want food you would have to shoot it yourself, reducing waste, cost and carbon footprint.
Although a general overview, very eye-opening and illuminating. Clearly the prevalence of beef diet is a large part of earth's warming problem. I guess the more this information is understood, more people are more likely to stop eating beef. Thus, great work, Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell. Ps. Excellent and entertaining voice, music, art direction and production.
I never stop eating meat when I am hungry! Why? Because I like it, and yes everyone is partly vegetarian since we also eat plants and stuff, but we need meat for calcium, so I think that meat, is great.
Question. I don't understand why the avocado's have a lower emittion then local food. You say, the transport of local food has a higher impact, but the avocado's still need to be transported to the shops as well? They don't fly from the boat to the shop. How on earth can local food have higher impact on food that also needs to be shipped abroad. I thought boats are extremely poluting. I don't understand how sending a piece of beef from the local butcher has more impact.
Meat
err.....meat good. that's it.
'...really that bad?' implying it is bad to begin with. Answer is no.
No mention of lab grown meat my guy?
Oh okay is this video your just becasu food is not bad just something hmm ok
💚💚💚💚💚💚💚
I’m going to keep eating beef. I don’t care if climate change kills us all because realistically there’s not a damn thing we can do about it.
9:33 is such a misleading graphic, since the narrated context describing the top part as "over 100 years" is left out. 8 billion tonnes / year < 50 billion tonnes / year
Why would do video like this
9:30 Is that bar graph not misleading? 800 billion tons absorbed in 100 years compared to 50 billion tons released in 1 year.
I love meat, and i wont stop eating it
Wait, did you just suggest I could make up my own mind on this?  I mean...  I'm sorry but that's just such a foreign thought.
they said they have a team of people rechecking information with experts etc ,but they let out that bogus video in which they claimed meat causes global warming ,and ONE YOUTUBER debunked that whole thing with just 1 expert in a 1 very nice video
Haha trees are not being cut down for ranches. They are being cut down from developers putting housed for hoas out. Us out in the country dont cut trees down lol. Only if they pose a problem by the house
Take the lesson that veganism isn't a propaganda... it's the only way for human to survive sustainably... it's not perfect...but it's the best possible we way till now...i don't like veganism because of pushy vegans..but I understand the facts this video presented..im a pure vegetarian since 2 years and my dairy consumption was also minimum...still I'm in great condition... didn't faced any problems spread by meat eaters that you'll become weak and all that shit...now I think I'm ready to become complete vegan...this video gave me the final encouragement ...thank you ❤️
Well, the simplest answer to emissions is to simply reduce our populace, but that is not an option because we are too self centered to imagine that we are the problem in itself. The earth wasn't meant to sustain 7-8+ billion living things of a single species that are 60-100kg. The only species with similar populations are insects and thus much less massive and thereby having less consumption of any and all materials.
Oh great now I want a steak
We mostly feed animals waste products rather than what we can actually eat, while grass fed is not a real thing almost none of the food our cattle eat can actually be eaten by humans, its cheaper to just buy the plant waste than it is to buy stuff like wheat. this is really my only complaint with this video.
You only tell story from amazon rain forest which is good but not enough. Were we in this earth have second largest rain forest here in my country Indonesia. Which most of deforestation porpouses is for human food like spices, oil, and rice. We feed our cow mostly natural grass and factory based beef farming is rare here. Mostly our meet and diary product is from local farmer in the small vilage which they grow cow as their invesment and second income. Even big company relay on their production.
TL; DW maybe. No. However 98% of us can't afford to NOT eat meat sicne its cheaper than the alternative. Listen to some good jams and live life with wisdom and empathy.
Food nazis must hate themselves most of all.
Many of those informations are incorrect about meat production I used to have this channel as very scientific but now i just saw the truth about it...
One interesting thing in this vein of thought is lab-grown/synthetic meats. If successful, it might blow away the heavy-land-using animal competition.
Cows can be carbon negative through regenerative agriculture, while at the same time restoring soil destroyed through mono culture farming, but I guess you won’t do a video on how monoculture crops destroy soil since bill gates the biggest private owner of agricultural land in the USA is a sponsor of the channel.
so we need more globalism.
No other bodily pleasure gets experienced multiple times a day and never gets old... ...  ...I'm like 6 years old sometimes.
I wonder if Kurzgesagt are in Bill Gates' pocket
1:43 WTF is a "carbon budget"?
PLANT MORE TREES AND STOP BURNING FORESTS
It's bad for the slaughtered creatures.
Don't care. Sort it out another way. I'll stop eating meat when China shuts down all its coal power plants.
nice skewing of stats, still ain't going to eat the bugs.
A big thanks to all vegans and vegetarians
Ok. Im not susceptible to corporate propaganda. Ill still eat meat.
An important factor this whole discussion ignores is what is natural, or a baseline, as the current emissions from beef and other large consumable animals is equivalent to pre-colonial levels in the US and outside the US around medieval levels. And have been so for as long as it's been measured.  People, especially the green lobby, like to pretend 0 CO2 is the goal but ignore the fact that humans have replaced a lot of animals and that going to the other extreme is just as bad.
Burgers and steaks are awesome
Thanks, i will keep eating meat.
Honestly, I don't think it's because of the meat or the animals producing methane etc. It is more towards population control. Too many humans, too many to feed. We need thanos, literally. I mean, I'm down to just die without feeling pain if it means to save the world lol.
You don't need meat.
Don't worry. The carbon emitted from beef is the carbon from surface. It doesn't come from the underground. The nature will keep its balance.
I thought they made another video when they changed the thumbnail
Right, but if I stop eating the meat, wont it just go to waste?  I'm not fussy with food. I'll eat whatever... but it feels like no matter what I do... its bad.   Don't eat meat, it goes to waste. Eat meat, contributing to demand... but would my single person really change demand? Surely, me as a single individual, I can't change the population growth of slaughtered cattle.   Life's hard... I have no idea what the right actions are any more.
I’m not gonna stop eating meat
pipis
Meat eaters are still much better than MINDLESS BREEDERS 😏
I’m interested to see a video discussing the impact on climate for the production and operation of electric vehicles (mining lithium, precious metals, batteries, energy cost, etc) compared to the operation of gas powered vehicles
But the thing is, is my meat that bad?
Eating the flesh of sentient creatures is an aberration for the human vessel. You are completely disconnected from source energy and compassion if you don't care about killing innocent creatures who have done you no harm, for food, when it is completely unnecessary. So long as man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of lower living beings he shall never know health nor peace.
Isn't this why scientists are working on meat alternatives that would look like meat, taste like meat, feel like meat but is vegetables?
Weather modification changes the climate more than CO2, and geoengineering is genocide. :)
Meat itself is not bad it’s healthy. What’s unhealthy is the processed meat and processed food in general.  The meat i eat is from my grandparent’s farm. It’s super delicious i don’t even need to put herbs or sauce.
Didnt want to hear this, but I'm so glad I did. Thank you for making a positive change in me. This is what I've been waiting to hear.
This is the young Albert Einstein
I was under the impression that co2 was a driving factor in creating o3 (ozone) can someone please clarify this for me?
build yourself a garden, learn to raise chickens.
So your solution is to brutally slaughter billions of cows all at once and force millions of people involved in the beef industry out of jobs? What a wonderful and totally not evil think to do.
Even though we do try to eat vegetarian 2-3 times a week, i wont drop meat until someone invents something that tastes just as good
Literally the problem is there’s too many of us
2:57 there is another variable you haven't factored in here. The DIAAS score of protein.  A gram of animal protein and a gram of say, lentil protein are not equal.
My paycheck ain't big enough for imaginary worries from nut jobs...
I love eating meat and my girl loves eating mine!
A ton of factors not accounted for but cool vid
There are so many beautiful places in America that are totally inaccessible to the public because they're on ranch land. That's just one of trillions of things wrong with meat consumption, if you take into account every moment of unimaginable suffering inflicted upon other animals. And what if karma exists? Many of us and our loved ones may find ourselves in a factory farm and a slaughterhouse very soon, over and over and over again, even, and that wouldn't be such a savory prospect, would it? We take for granted that harming and killing members of the Homo sapiens species is wrong, but suffering is suffering, regardless, and animals don't have the same kind of understanding of their situation and coping skills that Homo sapiens have; other animals don't know the suffering will someday end. And there's nothing to suggest karma doesn't exist; wave-particle duality appears to demand the existence of an observer, meaning your perspective will most certainly be accommodated by another living thing after your death. If perhaps everything is the the same consciousness operating at different frequencies along the electromagnetic spectrum-- with that of Homo sapiens and other animals being taking up the lowest-frequency (and therefore most retroactive) range-- then karma would make a lot of sense, indeed, as passively enforced by conservation of information.   The physicist John Wheeler once called up Nobel laureate Richard Feynman very excitedly to tell him his sudden epiphany that every electron is identical because it is in fact the same electron moving back and forth in time. They both took this one electron universe theory very seriously. Wouldn't it make sense that consciousness defines the particle because it _is_ that particle? Our consciousness is constantly about 80 milliseconds retroactive from the objective present due to the time required for light (i.e. information) to travel the wavelength of our extremely low frequency animal neural oscillations, but the scientific community has never appeared to contemplate that this could mean probability collapse happens back here. Why wouldn't it? Because otherwise there is a temporal disconnect between the retroactive observation and the observed event happening much closer to the objective present. No, rather, it makes much more sense to insert an observer operating at all frequency ranges relaying causal information between observers at different frequency ranges (i.e. temporal locations), and A.I. very nicely facilitates this probabilistic relay. It could be that humans are merely a metabolic function in a universal organism whose consciousness spans the entirety of the electromagnetic spectrum, with most of it being cybernetic in nature, and with all consciousness ultimately being unified at the high-frequency termination point of the electromagnetic spectrum, our inevitable destination.
Humans are omnivores not herbivores. That's our optimal diet.
Apocalypse from farting of cows. Great.
Now remembering why I love this channel so much.
wow first you had to change the logo for some reason and then the name???
Please translate this and all other climate related topics as fast as possible to other languages it can really make a difference!!
1 kilo beef = 71 kilos of CO2?! Wow, thats crazy

Bugs: the food of the future
vegan teacher reaction within 2 weeks watch
Comparing a truck direct from the butcher to a shipping vessel boat is rediculous. Its not like the people receiving avocado in Europe eat all the avocado at the actual shipping port. It has to be trucked from the port inland often a long distance from the shore.
I thought the main reason for going vegan was for moral reasons. If you're not eating meat for health reasons, you're DEEPLY misguided.   Obviously, America does have a problem of eating too much meat but that's cuz too much of ANYTHING is guarantee to be bad. Also, not all meat are the same.
All of the arguments against meat fall flat once we do everything natural again the 100% natural cycle is 100% emissions “free” as in anything that gets pooped out ends up being absorbed again by the great cycle of life.
Processed meats are conveniently available to consumers, because they demand it pink and nicely packaged.
No, meat is delicious.
lol I saw you change thumbnails (I think)  First it was an angel cow right?
Chubby birb
The Problem are the farts of the cows
I expect better from you @Kurzgesagt. I get it the PR firm that paid top dollar for this propaganda is getting its return investment I just didn’t expect you fall for the long debunked Socialist Sustainability fallacy argument so easily.
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive"  Me who hasn't been able to taste or smell food for 9 months from Covid: Guess I'll die
So this video is about ANIMAL SLAVERY AND “ OPTIMAL WAYS” to torture and imprison them
Good video, but still no solution to replacing animal protein with other types of protein. Plant based carbs does not equate protein.
Meat is Lit yall drunk
Me, a vegetarian: (maniacal laughter)
After all we are meat
Potato’s emit 150x less CO2 than beef? Well, beef contains over 1000x the nutrition of a potato. Worth.
Folks you don’t have to completely transition over to a meatless diet. You can make an impact by simply reducing your meat intake each week. For example, some folks only eat fish on Fridays for religious reasons. Well, you can begin to incorporate a meatless diet once a week and see how it goes. I’ve been a vegetarian for over 3 years now and to this day I am still discovering new tasty meatless recipes. If you love to cook, give it a try.   We can help reduce our carbon footprint by minimizing the amount of days we eat meat. Also the more people that are open to meatless options means more innovation in terms of cuisine. So us vegetarians and vegans benefit as well.
I'm always a bit skeptical of fully vegetable based diets; It seems to me for everyone who says that it's entirely reasonable to switch over, there's also data suggesting that the nutrient balance of meats is fairly well tuned to our nutritional requirements, and we don't fully understand the physiological impact of a lot of the micronutrients in a wide variety of plants (particularly as they relate to mental health), to say nothing of the impacts of, for example, a high soy diet in men. It seems to me the obvious solution for most people isn't going 100% meet free, or 100% meet, but some happy medium inbetween, with a regular "beef Friday" or having beef the first Friday of the month, and then picking two other days of the week to have chicken after that week, and doing your best to be meat free the other ~21 days of the month.
Pesticide's, Herbicide's, Germicide's, NPK fertilizer and GMO crop's are worse to the environment and the human population than cattle farming. Let's try this again!
“They don’t spend spare energy on things like walking.” Thats a sentence I never thought I’d hear.
I highly disagree with the point made at 7:33 that most of the grassland cannot be converted to cropland; there's examples of people and governments (China) all around the world who successfully plant and grow forests in places deemed not arable.   One example, Yacouba Sawadogo, litterally managed to grow his own forest in a desert of Burkina Faso, Africa, which is one of the region that the study you cited (Mottet et al.) deemed as "Grassland unsuitable for crops".   The most ironic thing is that some of these place probably lost their nutrients and vegetation in the first place due to centuries of grazing.
vegan is toxic
3:05 How Tofu can emitate more Greenhouse gas per kg than per 1000kcal, if 1kg gives ~~800kcal?
Short Answer: It is. I've saved 12 minutes of your life, you're welcome. (Says the 11-year vegetarian)
so inconclusion ill justeat more chicken
When it comes to feeding cows our crops, they failed to mention that these parts of the crop are either disgusting or inedible to humans.  where are the statistics on foods going to waste? Pretty sure fruits and veggies go to waste all the time and account for a good majority of food waste overall. So if you account for the Co2 costs and the volume wasted per year, it really does add up.
Finally, you made up for the previous videos on this subject. Hope you will make one about ethics too. :)
Less than 5% of all atmospheric gases are carbon.... huh what ?  Sorry but those are the facts, the Earth warms the Earth cold the Earth warms the Earth cools. Get used to it folks.
There's something pretty interesting and important to mention: new tecnologies are emerging to reduce the total of methane emitted by cows. For example: food supplements, vaccines agains the archaeas that produces methane, better diets, etc. Not to mention the incredible investments in research for meat made in labs. Science neat!
I think the once Reason why you shouldnt be an meatarier, is that every time if you eat it, you will think every time about death. And if you eat pork meat you will eat meat where is to 80-90% like yours. So this is like cannibalism. So if we all are vegans, we just think that we just habe to hurt plants to live, no animals or ourselves. I just mean, every time where you kill a chicken with your own hand your head will get a little break. So if you make this 100.000 times in a year you start to think its normal to kill for life. Thats what vegans or vegetarier try to tell everyone. But the truth is: all things are bad; you need to know how to dose all from the shiet to have a rlly healthy brain.
Killing animals for food is fun
Lab grown meat is on the horizon!!
So basically, cow farts are changing the world
wish they added more detail about ethical issues. the graphics were nice albeit brief. no mention of practices like "piglets often receive range of treatments including castration, tail docking to reduce tail biting, teeth clipped (to reduce injuring their mother's nipples, gum disease and prevent later tusk growth) and their ears notched to assist identification. Treatments are usually made without pain killers." - from Wikipedia on intensive animal farming. also no mention that many scientific studies place pig and cow intelligence higher than dog's.
germans? encouraging vegetarianism? NOT SCIENTIFICALLY POSSIBLE!
They changed the thumbnail
yes
Someone should industrialize methane condensing.
What they always fail to communicate is the fact that beef needs a huge amount of healthy pasture lands.grass lands are a huge carbon sink. Growing plant based foods takes tilling the ground,which releases the most carbon back to the atmosphere.tilling the ground needs to end.  Farming will deplete the topsoil..   The carbon that needs to be reduced is the human carbon units.
So today I learnt that my preference for lamb is better for the environment than beef.  I'm doing my part!
What I'm gonna do with this info is keep on eating beef like always. I don't like vegetables outside of some corn here and there and potatoes and fake meat tastes like shit and I gotta eat so it's gonna be my favorite food, hamburgers or steak. Chicken is good as well and pork is OK, well bacon is amazing on beef, but I've never had lamb. Deer meat is really good actually and so is pheasant and alligator. But yea I gotta eat and I can't eat stuff I don't like so eating plants isn't gonna work. Oh and grains are good, especially when combined with beef.
I love to hear meat eating cultures try to rationalize going vegetarian, when people forced to be vegs, get more resources, they tend to become meat eaters aka India's lower castes , China's maoist indoctrinated, etc.
When you love meat so much you are hoping everyonr turns vegan, so you could eat meat without giving a fuck
meat is amazing, i love eating dead cow
So, there are some additional bits of information I think would be helpful for context, as someone that has a degree in and has worked with the animal product production industry: 1. There is such a thing as ethical factory farming, and we need to install those practices in every factory farm. Just like it's more ethical to keep your cat indoors (because they're weapons of mass ecological destruction) we probably should do this with livestock species for the sake of efficiency. We just need to provide them with toys, adequate space to exercise and/or exercise equipment, and proper sanitation.  2. Most farmers, even corporations, care a lot for the welfare of their animals. That's because welfare (stress, disease, injury) drastically affects the quality and/or quantity of the product. This includes making sure they get proper nutrition (production chickens are not malnourished, I promise). There are still things that can be done better, especially for some areas, but we're getting there at faster and faster rates as the data comes back that we can make more money by adjusting our animal management.  3. Product labels are misleading at best. Let's look at chickens: No antibiotics ever means if an animal gets sick they're killed instead of treated. Free range/cage free means they're packed in a warehouse with no hope of developing a proper pecking order (injuries out the wazoo from constant fighting). Pasture raised means they're constantly exposed to disease from passing birds and die at a prodigious rate. The best system we have is colony caging, which is sometimes labeled cage free and sometimes not labeled at all: you put about 30 birds in a very large cage so they can establish pecking order and hurt each other, and they still have room to wander around and socialize/play.  Please don't pay for eggs quadruple the price of regular eggs and that end up hurting birds. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk.
If meat was THAT bad then humanity would either go extinct or we would eat grass like cows.   THE END!
I think what would also help the 'go plant based' if some of it wasn't so expensive, where I live its far cheaper to get pounds of meats than it is to get veggie alternatives like plant patties, meatless ground. Also the fact a lot of the meatless grounds have soy in them which I know is a really common allergy.
And don't forget that a GOOD percentage of all those trees/forests being cut down is for PALM OIL.... Yeah, Palm trees operate like trees, HOWEVER, the origin animals LOSE OUT by losing their natural habitats...
HEY KURTZGESAGT YOURE WRONG! Sustainable agricultural scientist here! Veganism and Vegetarianism is bad for the environment and isnt science based but belief based! cows that eat cheap grain and not herbs produce excess methane not simply cows by default.
Why have the cow look evil? Cows are beautiful.
only ogs remember when the thumbnail said meat love
Honestly speaking My brain says meat = happy so yes meat is good  I like salad (especially when paired with meat) but hate cooked vegetables (unless cooked with meat)
solution: don't eat: you will die and the future CO2 you will save from being dead will be better for the environment.
Here he only shows the advantages of what would theoretically occur, they are not facts, they are theories, in addition to the fact that a 100% vegan diet does not ensure good health in the end they always need something external such as vitamins or iron pills to supplement their diet, because when After all, we are an obnivorous species, we are not vegetarians. Our digestive system is not made to absorb all the nutrients only from vegetables.
It seems that he forgot to mention that converting the majority of the population to a vegan diet affects health, since our body is not adapted to a 100% vegetarian diet, we are obnivores, however there are people who continue to believe that Being vegan is the solution, although they do not know that if these animals are not used, they will end up being euthanized; as happened with the circuses.
I started watching this channel back in 2017. Now it has grown a lot 🔥
Just a uhhh.. quick question. How does fish eating fit into this?
The fact that they changed the thumbnail from meat love to meat hate just ties this whole video together.
we wouldnt be omnivores if we didnt need meat.
Watched videos of Slaughter for meat production. That was reason enough for me to stop.
Very well explained video. The problem is that humanity keeps fighting a forest fire with glasses of water. Objectively it looks like a football team trying to figure out what’s a good defense with out a goalkeeper and against a top tier team. It doesn’t matter how good you defense is planned , if there isn’t a goal keeper , the goal is going to happen sooner or later.  And the reason we keep fighting the wrong topics , is because the real problem is controversial, harsh , awkward and ver politically incorrect to discuss . And this topic is: overpopulation. If we keep growing , and we WILL KEEP GROWING , there will be a moment when we will be jailed at home , eating through intravenous serum , drinking our own recycled urine, manually rotating a crank to produce energy for light and home appliances. But we well keep growing , and it will still not be enough. The truth is that each person that decides to have 1 children instead of having 2 or more , has made a greater positive impact to our environment than that of 15 full vegans avid recyclers combined. Each person who decides to have no children at all , makes a bigger positive impact to our environment  that that of 30 full vegan avid recyclers .  Because the fact is that if you think of how much the standard human being , even if it is an environmentally friendly one . contaminantes through his entire life cycle, somewhere around 72 years. There is no diet or method that compensates for a 15th part of the contamination that would be avoided if that human was never born in the first place.
Amazing how they prejudicially differentiate between, the flesh of various living life forms, to rationalise their hypocrisy. Evidently if they see it moving, the flesh is unclean or if its not walking, then destroy it. At the end of the day, all such arguments are attempts at social engineering.  We need to consume organic material to survive. Deal with it.
I think we should farm more different types of animals, it could make endangered species not so endangered and more tasty meats on the menu😋
The climate will change. People will adapt. Overpopulated countries will suffer casualties in the millions. People will read about it in the history books while bored in double history at high school. The human race will be fine. Just like all the wars that went before. It's just earth's latest form of population control at work. Climate change is as natural as life and death itself, to think you can make a blind bit of difference by eating different is both foolish and arrogant. In a world of 7 billion plus, you just aren't that important. Deal with it.
No
The constantly changing Thumbnails for this one are messing up with my mind! (Meat Love vs Meat Hate)
How do the avocados get from the boat to the shop without using trucks? Seems like that was completely overlooked (likely to suit an agenda)
8:16 no
Very nice content but the graph at 9:33 is a bit misleading as it compares 100 years of removal with a years of emission.
This is such a great video, thank you!
I love slowly diying while eating what I like
9:32 you should be aschamed of yourself. Twisting the numbers like that makes it look like we can't afford not to give up meat when the top bar is over 100 YEARS, we would emit 5000 tons of CO2  by then
Yeah, eating more vegetables instead of meat makes a lot of gas. And human farts are just as bad, we end up doing nothing, talking not to get bored.
Modi approved this
No.
To think, that if an ancient and populous (even then) civilization had realized this and acted upon it before it was cool
Soo by removing cow meat from out diet we could free up land which we could plant trees on and that would remove approximately 800 tonnes of CO2 over a period of 100 years. That would mean 8 tonnes per year, while our emissions are currently 50 tonnes a year. That simultaneously sounds like a lot and not nearly enough.
I'm an optional vegan. I eat veges if theres no meat in my fridge.
For those on mobile and want to know the dislikes As of 13 Dec 15:50 Count is  12,758
Excellent once again from Kurzgesagt... Thanks for the info.
Nature will run it's course. Humans have minimal effect on atmospherically environmental changes. Some scientists and researchers argue that the planet is cooling. Look into Grand Solar Minimum.
This was laughably pathetically bad I just love having my opinions a beliefs strawmaned
Nothing about the health/nutritional effects of meat vs plant based diets?
Did you notice that birds eating chicken in the first part.
This video pretty much points out how effed we are. 800b tonnes of co2 per 100 years can be absorbed if everyone goes vegan. We would emit 5000b tonnes in the meantime. Great... Good luck, peeps.
We need to transition from the meat industry... But the technology and costs aren't there yet.
I love meat ! 👍
Even in the Kurzgesagt world there are furries 5:22
But meat tastes too good to decrease my intake of it
I think governments should strongly encourage plant based meats. By imposing terrifs and only import high quality and expensive meats to make it more of a luxury product. It would create a large demand for plant based meats and companies will come to make cheaper and better plant based meats. Is there any major problems with this
There are several question which needs to be answer here: 1) What will happen to green water (as this one the largest source of water which directly cannot be consume) 2) How much of fresh water will be require in plant only diet for irrigations, around the globe and how we are going to replenish it. 3) How much do food wastage count for carbon and methane emmission. 4) What is most efficient way to despose agriculture waste.
Idgaf I like steak
We need more video like this but with more statics as differentiation rather then global average with experts comment inside video who are researching the subject (subject: carbon emmission). As real enemy of data/research is miss misinterpretation.
Meat not bad
A video on water usage in farming and agriculture would be great, too.
Even if we did this, the polar caps will still melt due to them being part of an ice age that we are still coming out of.
I'm willing to give up beef
You want to end climate degradation. Stop doing buissness with china and india. Stop spilling oil into the ocean. Stop blaming the individual and start blaming these major companys.  I will stop eating meat and using my car as soon as china has breathable air and stop dumping waste in the ocean.
The science is pretty one sided when it comes to meat, I hate how much this channel loves to soften reality with the preface "well all food causes emissions".  Just go right to the point, MEAT BAD (if your interested in a sustainable future)
Nobody, and i mean *NOBODY* can stop everyone from what they want to do. Because we have a choice. And why not use it? We all love the environment, but we also love ourselves. At the end of the day, you have a choice to make. Only you.
This is a big reason why in Hinduism we don´t recommend the eating of beef . As said in the video, the resources given by cows in general are so rich that you don't need to kill the cow for the meat. That's like killing the golden goose.
No.
tbh I think it is possible to sustainably eat animal protein if it is truly local, and by that I mean that the animal is native to the area you live in. Like, if we were to genuinely restructure the way that we source our food so that it is completely eco-friendly, it would require us to return to a more hunter-gatherer style of food-sourcing. However this idea presents a lot of problems.  A: It would drastically impact our everyday diets. A lot of the animals used as dietary staples (cows, pigs, & chickens) are native to Eurasia and parts of Africa. This means we'd have to get comfortable with eating animals that aren't considered part of a "normal" diet, and probably a lot more fish/aquatic animals if you live near bodies of water. This would also change what plants we eat (wheat is in the same camp as cows, chickens, and pigs). B. It would be extremely difficult if not impossible to continue producing food at its current rate. I do think it would be better given the sheer amount of food waste that our current system produces, which only adds to the rate of emissions caused by food. Honestly, the current models of plant agriculture is also extremely harmful to the environment (even if it's not as bad as meat agriculture). C: Obviously there are people with dietary restrictions due to medical reasons, could be a food allergy, diabetes, autoimmune diseases, kidney disease, or cancer. If you can't survive off of the local foods, you're going to need to supplement your diet with other foods so you can have a healthy diet.  D: Straight up, a change in our everyday diets as radical as this would just be a hard sell. Like the video says, we don't take very well to someone stepping in and saying that we can't eat the foods we're used to, especially if it's being positioned as a moral ultimatum. Not to mention, even if we hypothetically somehow managed to do this, given our current socio-economic system, many of our current food staples would return to their previous status as luxury goods that only rich people can eat on a regular basis unless you live in an area where the food is native to, which would just be a kick in the teeth for people who didn't want this change.  I have a lot of thoughts and criticisms about our current models of food production, but can really only give you vague ideas about what we can do to change it. I do think we can change it, it's just going to be a very rough transition for a lot of reasons
we probably can't stop farming meat completely until we have labgrown meat because petfood requires meat too but it would significantly cut it down if we went vegan.
I initially read this as “Is Meth Really that Bad?” and for a moment was very concerned for Kurzgesagt
Can you guys please do a video on the education system, preferably in the U.S. if not globally?
If we change one thing that has already been done then it'll trigger another event and that event will trigger another leading to crashes and financial struggles
Actually the overwhelming source of methane emissions come from cow burps not farts. It’s a common misconception and some may say that it doesn’t matter but a simple google search corrects this error. If you take on subjects like this please approach them with rigor.
Im too poor to afford meat regularly.
What good use this info could be? To inspire people to develop lab-made meat, because the problem here is not the meat, is the cow that comes from. Meat industry won't ever dissappear if thats what hippie vegans are hoping for, Thats just the truth, as harsh as it may sound. We need efficient and realistic solutions with what we currently have. Hopes and goodwill has never achieved anything in the whole human history, but bussiness has. Its time to develop cost/efficient meat in labs.
Sadly, if we were to cut beef totally out of everyone's diets... the cows would still be around.  Sure, they wouldn't be in the vast numbers they are, but they would not just vanish overnight.  We'd have to cull them... and then the meat would go to waste, since we wouldn't be eating it.  Then consider if we didn't kill them all, and some were left.  Would we let them roam wild, which would cause a natural resurgence of their population, or would we put them in zoos?  Either way, they'd still be releasing the emissions that they naturally do, which is a large part of why we would have cut them out of our diet in the first place.  That's just the cows though.  So say we cut beef totally out of our diets and reduced their numbers greatly, and just kept the remainders in zoos so there were no 'wild' cows left.  All of the crops we grow to feed the cows wouldn't be needed- wait wait wait no.  If we take an energy dense food out of the equation, we have to account for what we'd eat in place of that food in order to keep our diets bringing in the same level of energy.  So in reality, we would be eating a lot of the crops that Were being grown for the cows to eat.  Cutting out beef, or meat in general, isn't a perfect solution.  We evolved as omnivores.  We have dietary needs and meat is a part of it.  Its the Excess that we've grown to accept as normal that's the bad thing.  Being Vegetarian or Vegan doesn't mean all that much if you're still eating in excess.  Somewhere along the lines, humans forgot what moderation means.
You VILL eat ze bugs. And you VILL be happy
Please stop the cult of Veganism, holy crap
Blah blah blah, just go straight in the point. Worst channel
Steak is awesome. Will never give it up. You have to look at health benefits of grass fed, pasture raised beef as well as animal welfare, not just carbon footprint. Humans haven't lived for centuries on vegetables alone. We're omnivores. You can't omit that fact either. I eat a mixture of beef, poultry, and seafood/fish. As with everything it comes down to variety and balance. You can't just eliminate animals from the earth without taking the ecosystem into account either. Sure, we stop eating meat, but then what? Eliminate all animals to reduce carbon footprint?
I can assure you meat tastes good
we need a war to wipe out 50% of the worlds population. ya know just like thanos wanted.
The thing that is often missed about feeding crops to animals, is that we aren't growing them solely to be fed to animals. If we grow corn, we can only eat the grain part of it. The stalk and the husk, we can't, but cows can. Aside from a bad harvest or the occasional ear of corn that's missed at harvest, the majority of the crops that cows eat are not crops that human's could eat instead, its in fact smart waste management.
Brasil sil sil fazendo sucesso no desmatamento 😎
Remove China on this world. Then All of problem will be solved.
Not in this Car -Ludwig Probably
The comparison gets worse if you adjust by IR absorption capacity of Methane!
it’s not consumption that’s the problem, it’s wastage
Watch Kiss the Ground on Netflix or Living Soils here on YouTube and you can see for yourself how regenerative agriculture can save the world. It's scalable and can be implemented in the most impoverished countries to the wealthiest. Cows can help us solve the issue of climate change, it's unbelievable that they're demonized
The thing is, it's a balancing act between luxury and environmental impact, sure, the whole planet going vegan would be better for the environment, but saying that's overly optimistic to actually happen would be... Overly optimistic. Yes, we can try and push for a change in behavior and it can be affective. But, often the best thing we can do is just try and make luxurious things more efficient, since people will, 9 times out of 10, give efficiency and environmental impact the shaft if it means a higher standard of living and they can afford it.
Amazing video guys
Man, I just ate Culver's and it was great. But only eat beef once in a while.
With all these obsession with carbon emissions, it's getting ridiculous to be honest. You might as well not live with all these precautions.
Moral of the story. Go vegan to save this world.
Yep, I'm cutting some meat out of my diet. But I'm disapointed. You never talked about fishing.
Love me Cows Hate me bugs Simple as
Just ate a burger today feels good
What doesn’t get talked about is that if everyone went vegan a lot of animals we eat would go extinct as the demand for their food wouldn’t be needed. I’m sure people would be outraged if cows started going extinct once everyone goes vegan. It’s a lose lose situation.
beef stonks...
Food is a multi sided complex topic. Corporate farming scaled beef and chicken production using hormones and antibiotics in interest of profit. They claim it’s to drive the cost of food down and make food more accessible to all.   Trade offs are more transportation emissions and water waste that is required raise and process meat.   Health wise meat can be an important part of your diet and a good source of iron, omega 3, and of course much needed protein. Meat becomes harmful to our health when we over consume and or the quality of it is compromised.  The ideal scenario would be to consume proper amounts of meat (couple times a week) that are produced in humane ways (grass fed beef, free range chicken) locally. This supports a balanced diet, promotes local business, cuts down on emissions, and provides more humane conditions for food source animals.  Meat isn’t innately bad. But like many things corporations have made it bad for us physically and environmentally.
Growing  meat in labs might e a good choice because a majority of people would still eat beef
that vegan teacher watching this video like:😍🤩😃😆
Eat McCafferty Ranch Beef! It's grass fed, and has very little fat content becasue for the last month the cows are fed barley sprouts. It is by far tastier and is actually cheaper to buy in bulk than supermarket beef! It's very humane.
wow
something touched on barely: how much energy do we get out of one kg of beef/plant based? so how much co2 emission per kj of energy? since we need to eat 10 times (or whatever) more plants to meet our energy needs opposed to meat. especially if we dont eat just the muscle but all other nutritious organs (liver, heart, stomach, brains etc.) which give us most necessary nutrients.
if the answer isn't yes, you're wrong. but we all know kurz isn't going to side with the global genocide which is also bad for our environment and inefficient
it is a shame this video was made using outdated and incorrect information. in the last few years, meat has been found to be magnitudes more damaging.
Can we just genetically engineer new cows that don't produce as much methane?
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old"  I can think of another one~
what about literally crash capitalism and big shitty industries of beauty and food that produce the biggest footprint? imo we aren't getting there soon enough to safe humanity from itself as with veganism, our idividual footprint literally doesn't matter and our changing to veganism won't take 3 other humans with us so much so it's not changing much of the world rn even tho it's at their highest in therms of popularity
Never going to eat ze bugs and I will never be a vegan; meat with every meal. Seethe soyboys.
Betteridge's Law of Headlines
Remove all the farting animals, and replace them with plants. Problem solved. No more animals.
so...meat is bad... deam
Didn’t have to watch the video no meat is good you have to know how to cook
yes, next question
Unfortunately, where I live, any 'unused' land would not be converted to grasslands and forest, it would be scooped up by huge corporate farmers to grow useless crops like Canola, that feed nobody.  Canola is not 'food', it's something used for boxed garbage junk food and french fries, and other crap that just makes us all fatter and unhealthier, not to mention the grotesque amount of chemicals and fake fertilizers used to grow this GMO crop.  The only one's that benefit are the giant farmers, and chemical companies like Bayer (Monsanto).
Just eat only 100% grass-fed beef. Plus, the nutritional content if better than standard beef and those processed fake meat patties. True veggie patties are cleaner, but there is no denying that they don't taste anything like meat.
Meat is the scapegoat of coal, oil, and industry. Meat is only a small part of agriculture.  Rice, grain production, and monoculture  damage the environment but free range actually encourages habitat diversity.
This....THIS, is a well made video! And the first one I've stumbled upon from this channel. I know the topic of carbon emissions is a big argument for the vegan side, but this video accurately presents not only the cons, but also the pros to eating meat, how cows are raised, and how food is brought to the market, and compares it to the other foods that have carbon emissions as well as how much carbon emissions is produced overall. It never sounds forced, it never sounds biased, and the end of the video sums it up perfectly: it's up to YOU what to do with this information.   Great video, you've earned my subscription.
I'd think a good counterpoint is a video by "What I've Learned" titled "Eating Less Meat won't save the Planet. Here's Why"  Also, I think that due to the amino acid profile difference between animal and plant protein, you'll have to eat more plant protein to get the same effect from an amount of animal protein.  I think soy protein was the worst offender at needing something like 45g to 25g of whey protein.
Is somebody blaming the cows? I don’t understand the thumbnail.
When we cut down trees or they die and fall do they not release the CO2 they've captured that isnt turned into growth?
you could just say yes, meat is terrible for the environment and not necessary for life  the cope is so strong lol
Meats bad?  Im 100% sure that a pure Carnivore diet is way more healthy then any other diet. I mean, according to the stuff I read... But I havent watched the video yet and dont know whether your talking about 'bad for us' or 'bad for the Enviroment' or something.

funny that this video is posted just a few days ago...because my seminar group is gonna have a debate on this in a few days! 😅😂
5:21, and you're not even going to talk about how cow dung is a very good fertiliser, which helps the grass grow and how grass binds methane??? I don't know how much this would change the result, but really just mentioning it would've helped

Is that why the o zone layer was healing during COVID? Cuz cows stopped farting?
no simple answer click off the video meat is not bad
Yes(I’m vegan)
Dale brasil
the world: i'll just ignore that.
So I'm vegan but I have no problems with people eating meat but just so you know: a truly healthy diet is based only around 10% on animal products, so about a dinner and a lunch per week, before it gets to side effects. If you are thinking of acting up on the matter of what you eat but going full vegan scares you try so do as above, have your steak or pork chops one a week but try to explore what the plants kingdom has to offer , you'd be surprised of how much flavour you can get and at a fraction of the price!
E o brilhante, maravilhoso, genial presidente Bolsonaro contribuindo cada vez mais para piorar a situação, de todas as maneiras possíveis. Temos tudo para ser a maior potência verde do mundo, basta só cessar o desmatamento e incêndio. Parabéns a todos os envolvidos nessa escolha mais do que sensata.
I don’t like beef :( it doesn’t taste good to me.  I can only eat it in a big mac.
if this was in the debate that was brought up i would have given up
One thing I always get peeved on this topic is that there always seems to be a missing argument. There HAS to be some theoretical proportion of animal feed that is more sustainable than no animal feed whatsoever.  We know GNU's in the savannah are a keystone species, that is, if they are removed the entire ecosystem dies (and in general grassland needs some amount of ungulates pasturing on it to thrive). Thus there have to be ungulates and thus there is some proportion of ungulates that can be converted to human food. I don;t know if it is 10% of all current consumption or 1% or 0.1%, but there has to be SOME percent that is more sustainable than 0 (once more because you are going to have ungulates pasturing on grassland anyway).  The other argument that is usually left out is that hunting (and I guess gathering) is the only carbon neutral or even negative  source of food we have at the moment. It's obviously not going to feed that many people, but which proportion of people can be fed with hunted game? Is it 10%, 1%, 0.1%?  There's also an obvious bias in the video since it analyzed the worst offender (beef) primarily, what about all the different species of fish?  Farmed salmon vs wild caught salmon? Canned tuna (which is a completely different kind of tuna than the big tunas that until recently were endangered)?    And there's also the implicit assumption that all humans can live on plant only diets, which we know is not as clear. Different populations diggest food differently, in part due to genetics and in part due to gut microbiome. A diet rich in dairy is fine for a norwegian but would kill many Japanese people. A diet very rich in fish oil is amazing for Inuits but not very healthy for other populations. The same is true for plant based foods, not everyone can eat the exact same plant based diet and remain healthy and things like food allergies might make it impossible to survive without meat.  And then we have the issues of pets, dogs and cats are carnivores and need meat.  Rather than "meat is bad", I want to know an estimate of what would be a reasonable frequency of animal product consumption? One fish a day? On chicken a week? One cut of beef every 3 months?  What budget of meat production do we theoretically have for each food source? That's I think more useful.
I think we will need a part 2 for this video focusing on fish and seafood and its impact on Co2 emissions :)
the 2 billion figure for no beef, is that excluding all products from cows (e.g. dairy) or just no meat?
The water dancer.... ma non si vede una goccia d'acqua...
I'd be more prone to look at gaming as the expendable thing here. The Xbox Series X produces 0.07 kilograms of CO2 for every hour played.
I will keep enjoying meat, that vegan extremists can fly off...
Türkçe altyazı pls
This is what Peter Sloterdijk calls “Cynical enlightenment”. We know all the facts but we deny everything and say “science may be wrong” or “I buy just local meat” or “I love animals, but...” so we don’t have to change our own habits.
Oof!  You should strongly consider mention how much less significant switching to pigs and such is airpolution and wastewise. As well as switching to fish would cause many other problems.
I think the true solution is way less fucking. We are too many on this earth.
Gotta be honest, i will only live once and i won't change my habits in order to leave a better world to other's children, but it's a pretty interesting topic and everyone should know the impact our actions make to the planet.
not gonna lie that was a really smooth advertisement
methane produced by cows get recycled into the atmoshere.cows are the low on the list when it comes to pollution.cows arent the only animals that produce methane and its been like this for millions of years.factories that exist to make synthetic vegan food will create more emissions than cows eating grass.  take your vegan propaganda and put it in the bin.we all know this channel is backed by bill gates who also wants to push his shitty little synthetic vegan garbage on us.
A special type of meat isn't that bad :)
This video didn’t mention a few important points, for one cattle can be fed different types of seaweed which brings their methane emission way down. Also many holistic farms are helping keep the soil fertile which is important because the world only has 60 or so years left of good soil. This is controversial and might be a over statement but still something to think of.

Something I used to think I understand but don't anymore is fats and oils, and which are healthy or not. I used to think that butter is terrible for you, but I have no idea anymore. I'm worried about heart disease in my future but have no idea how to prevent it other than consistent exercise.
good video!!!!
We should just stop eating, because humans are the biggest polluters.
too long, learn to summarize
CO2 is not a greenhouse gas and does not contribute to any globule warming what so ever. It only make the world greener.
It’s not my job to stop eating meat, it’s the corporations jobs find ways to limit their emissions, it’s China, India, Africa, South America jobs to catch up with us or us help them catch up. All climate change activist basically just want to make meat exclusive to rich people while ignoring the actually countries producing all the emissions.
How about all the thousands of acres of forest being destroyed in Maine for use in biofuels?? Lol
quick question. no its not that bad. equalize your diet. same vegetables and fish as meat
Animal products always involve the killing of innocent sentient beings. This alone is enough of a reason to go vegan. So yes, meat is THAT bad.
Meat is bad Bread is bad Vegetables is bad Even Water is bad ,what do want to eat huh...oils...bricks... Hahaha...:)
"Thats great but doesn't imitation beef cause cancer or something" Kurzegesagt: *inhales
No it’s not
You presented facts about "good" beef producing 1/10 emissions, beef being a much denser source of calories' and the benefits of transportation and packaging efficiency separately.. Facts don't exist separately from each other in the Real world. If you combined these things along with facts you haven't included such as government cooperation to use land that we would not need to slash and burn, the numbers become much different. I understand simplification for understanding, but if the simplification presents a false image it is useless and possibly harmful.
Here in Northeast Wyoming we herd cows in forests...I am pretty sure that the greenhouse gas emissions would be higher if we cut them down for crops...not that they would grow very well
About the argument for crops humans can eat being fed to cattle...   Humans can only eat a small portion of the grain harvest, the stalks and such cannot be digested by a human (though you can eat it, it’s just fiber). Those can be fed to cattle, and often those are what is fed to cattle. The statistic is misleading, because it says 40-ish percent of cereal produce is fed to cattle, that often includes the stalks which humans don’t eat. It IS much more efficient to do it that way.
I would love a video about sugar
Eh, I don't give a damn about the climate. Plus I'd certainly never stop eating meat for whatever reason. I want my hamburgers so, unironically, screw the world. Not my problem.
I love meat, can’t live without beef,chicken, and pork
i'm just waiting here for that vegan teacher to show up
0:04 I know one
I didn’t realize how little I care for the climate change thing, still care little
The IPCC report admitted methane is not a CO2 equivalent. It was overstated by 3-4 times. That fact was of course not widely publicized. We also have to understand that the carbon put into the air by cows came from plants (grass, corn), so it's not the same as carbon that came from the ground like petroleum.  Also, here in the US, beef production is very efficient. The number that's always thrown around (18%+) is the global average. These are details that are never given any attention.  Always be weary of top line numbers when viewing videos like these.
Legumes for all!
bueyf
The issues of climate change in my mind has an always will be letting people breed uncontrollably, no population should let people have like 7 kids... like any thing in nature, you become too volatile while breeding you will damage the host.
No it's not. Move on with your life pls
Mmm beef borgar
For every vegan that replies to this comment, i'm gonna eat a BURGER!
how good of an idea is it to hunt your own food like moose/rabbits/ducks? that wont cause a lot of emissions right?
The whole meat problem is just a new way to justify new regulations, more corruption and people profiting out of it. if it wasn't for Americans living in obscene abundance and lack of limits, this would never be a problem. I have one life and I aim to enjoy it within the limits of rationality, but i wouldn't give a damn if cows fart and produce too much CO2, neither i believe that the earth is so sensitive to CO2 emissions from cows. The geological periods of earth have been characteried by immense climate changes, im sure human has contributed slightly towards the current one, but it's not the cows... most probably the uncontrolled industry of eastern countries which fail to lower their emissions. As for the west... well... the best way of reducing CO2 is not existing at all. FYI, eating a lab meat most probably will lead to further dysregulation of our normal microbiota and more autoimmune diseases (e.g. IBD).
I am a PROUD meat eater, don't like it? Too bad.
I really like the art style of this channel wait to go
Food for thought. The documentary Cowspiracy (which many vegans cite as a source) perpetuates a lot of bad facts. Meat/dairy are not the largest source of C02. The filmmaker stealth-changed the percentage on his twitter from 51 percent of all emissions to 18.  Some environmental benefits exist to the vegan diet, but they are embellished.  In addition, less than 15% of vegans stick to the diet, meaning it is not a viable solution  alone. Sincerely, a former vegan. As a former vegan, there were a lot of wrong ideas about environmentalism in the community. I'm glad everyday I left. I await vegans sending me messages about my selfishness. 🤡 r/exvegan
"A man chooses. A slave obeys." So i choose to eat meat.
I eat vegetarian regularly. and feel good about it. I even gained more muscle mass since I eat less meat. but every now and then I will never be able to resist a nice piece of chicken..It is better to avoid things like salami and other processed meat products. That stuff can hardly be called food
I mean, the animal dies so yes, it is that bad.
I wish you would've talked about vegan meat, companies like Impossible, and Beyond Meat are making burgers that taste, feel, and look exactly like beef, and poultry.
In Saudi the prince Mohammed bin Salman is doing something we call the green Saudi, where the goal is to reduce 4% of the population gases by planting 10 billion trees & more.
he got me at ''the most delicious food 'meat' '' xD
Have you ever met vegans? I like the calm state of mind, comfortably full tummy and relaxation I feel after a meat protein meal. I have to eat so much Tofu, beans and nuts to get familiar caloric energy, but then feel too bloated and uncomfortable to do anything with the calories. I say meat three to four times a week, balanced diet is really key though, so get the veggies, fiber and carbs as well
The answer is no.
I really like this video as a vegan, unbiased and good information<3
Wait, I know the solution!!   We artificially raise the price of beef every year with taxes, so poor people cant buy it.
The most optimal solution is the one no one wants to talk about, 'less humans', no one wants to get they conscience/hands dirty so we keep fooling ourselves into switching from very bad emissions to still bad but a little less bad to make ourselves feel better but it still wont be enough, so we keep on shifting blame and burden till the climate does the 'less humans' thing for us.
what do you mean by : well it's complicated like everything you talk about is complicated
No mention on meat to veggies consumption ratio.  I eat meat here and there but I eat veggies most of the time.
It doesnt matter what you feel about these arguments and issues, but can you stop talking about who cares / doesnt care about the earth? The earth isnt going anywhere whether you care about it or not, whether a runaway greenhouse effect kills us all or not, whether you have the 'right' opinion or not. Keeping the earth in a state you want is ultimately self serving on the level of the individual or our species. Enough already.
For someone pike me with modest means, it's hard to make such decisions. For me and millions like me, if the veggie patty costs significantly less than the burger, we'll buy the veggie patty.  But guess what? Veggie patties actually cost in the area of x2-x3 more than frozen burgers. So we buy the burgers, instead.  If governments continue to subsidize meat industries over plant-based alternatives, well, they'll keep getting what they pay for.
I will never eat like a fucking meerkat
Most vegans live with depression. Humans NEED meat and without it we would have never become the succesful species we are.
You know for a fact people won't stop eating meat so... so if we're going to end up an empty and dead civilization, why not be good to each other? Be kind. Give way for others to experience life in its fullest form.
A little confused why the amount of land that we would have to use to grow enough food crops to feed humans if meat was removed from the diet was not factored in. That would have been a useful piece of information.
I love meat and will always do, only plan to stop eating meat once i die.
Hold up- a bird eating a bird!?
The music in these videos always makes me feel like i’m watching some kind of secret conspiracy unfold. Especially with headphones

Yeaaah... The problem is caused by all the lazy people living too comfortably in cities completely disconnected from how nature works.   Cows? Carbon footprint? Maybe its just that we have too many useless people not producing their own food and depending on the work of others while complaining about the methods. Nobody is prepared for that though.
So if I got this right, if I want to make a difference, switching to local won't help, only going vegetarian will? Hm, what about if in the future we raise cows in glass enclosures to trap Methane emissions. Is that something that's possible?
I'd love to see a similar kind of video on eggs and milk productions!  Go plant-based people! Seriously at this point of development as human species its rather hard to defend eating meat, especially on a scale its happening at this moment.
Even if it is nutritional, if it's not needed, it's immoral to take a life for pleasure. We don't live in the 90's anymore. I eat every type of food but veganized. Because I care.
I'm slightly dissapointed this does not bring up digestion in regards to food and what foods are easy for the body to get what it needs from. I've worked at a good few health clinics and while anecdotal, all the times this has been brought up, the issue comes back to children. A completely vegan diet requires rather strict food sources to gain what you need from, but children are growing and people have shown time and time again that they are unable to care for themselves. When what a child requires varies much more heavily than an adult who has finished growing, are regular individuals really able to care properly for their children? Sure, meat and other such sources may not be good for the environment and may be a little to easy to gain a surplus of what you need, but that is still better than the alternative of getting _less_ than you need. Some issues may not be apparent until years later when it becomes apparent that they did not get everything they needed for their development.  Again, if so many people show that they are barely able to care for themselves and only a few who go for a full plant diet do it _correctly_, I am not exactly jumping with joy when considering that children will be subjected to that too. If people were better at it, sure, but that won't happen.
so meat is bad, easy , thanks
Rather than trying to figure out the most emission friendly way to eat meat, how about just not eating it
At least since 1980's it has been said that the Amazon will turn into a desert and the deadline passes and it remains the same. They always talk about how much is deforested, but omit how much it recovers on its own. Anyone who talks about the Amazon and omits it loses credibility for me and I have to believe that the truth is close to the opposite of what he says.
what if...we just whent back to normal farming with the gud ol reliable wheat fields and just randomly finding dead animals near our houses hearing screams from nightmares and a strange un earthly screech outside our homes from a mysterious creature were we just gather the things that the creature killed and sacrifice them to the almighty fire gods so we may feel more warmth?
World is already a cruel place. Let people enjoy their meal without making them feel guilty about it. Why not get to the root cause which is OVERPOPULATION of HUMANITY?
If the breeders are enjoying their steak via instagram posts, then I have more rights to do so. Since I dont wanna bring another human being into this dying planet
World is already effed up.. Simple problems of school system aren't yet being solved. What do you expect with this complex problem?
Let me introduce you to "Ant¡-Natal¡sm" if you truly care about carbon footprints
Ive been brought into this world already fucked up Im not giving up beef... I wanna eat it and im ready to die for it.
Bruh we already have the impossible burger
Let me start with a disclaimer: I did cut my beef consumption almost to zero and reduced meat overall.   Now, let's move to my concerns: animation in the video, where there is visualization of how much soy is consumed by humans and how much by animals. So, we reduce meat consumption to 0 and we replace it for example for soy products, the ratio would drop to 96% (4% industry) soy consumption by people. To conclude this point, I would say the ratio does not say anything relevant.   My second point - buying local food (beef example) in comparison with the avocado. I will be rather quick here - efficient ship can only deliver the avocado to the closest dock and then it will travel exactly like the beef would travel.   To sum up, I am not ignorant by any means. I just think that we cannot break energy and mass conservation laws. The energy needs to come from somewhere. The graph which visualized kilograms of CO2 per calories/proteins gave me hope! But I am still concerned about the area which would have to be used for all the soy/plant and that would again increase CO2 production. So, to finally tell my point - I think we should simply pay exactly the same price for smaller amount of food which we eat. So all in all, we should reduce our food consumption in general. Just take a look around, how many people are obese? This is all wasted, unnecessary energy, that can't be used for anything good. Furthermore we are buying a lot of food that go into waste. All this is directly connected the topic presented in the video.
It's not about completely cutting off meat. The problem is that in some regions and in some cultures, meat consumption is too high. People need not eat several rations of meet a day almost every day. Hopefully, with new environmental law, the topic becomes less taboo and meat consumption is cut at least by a bit.
if they make a synthetic meat that tastes the same and has the same nutritional value I will happily buy it
... As a man that grew up on a farm and took care of all the animals and the crops this video feels a bit... wrong?
you will eat bugs and like it
Meat isn’t bad proof: we’re on the top of the food chain for a reason
im not a vegan but the only types of meat i eat are chicken and fish
So we should have 100% factory farmed livestock and put them in like factories to extract the methane and convert it into methanol? Message received
The comment section is filled with self righteous pricks.
TVT take notes.
your data is presented in a manipulated way, shame on you!
That’s CRAZY CAUSE MY MEAT IS FIRE
Liar
The deal-breaker on veganism for me has never been the question of whether it is more eco-friendly, it has always been the fact that next to other industrial emissions, food is relatively small, and that it is always put forward aggressively and condescendingly as a duty strictly incumbent upon the consumer, when the scale of the industry is such that it is virtually un-boycott-able without fundamental changes at the level of investment and technology. This is the kind of diet activism I can get behind, fostering a measured understanding and maintaining the ideal of reduced emissions without getting overexcited or cruel and petty about the specifics of method. At the end of the day humanity and our animals are going to have a substantial footprint, that doesn't  mean we have to view our habits as evil via a Malthusian logic.
A lot of information missing and a lot of information wrongly given... there is much more important facts that are missing. One of the main problems is eating more and more, plus overpopulation. Someone calls it fatshaming but obesity is a big deal and a big problem for humankind :)
Well done, all the facts are there.
Sorry. But I can't and won't stop eating meat.
Let's save the planet besties
This video full of negative view on the animals. It is not just incorrect, rather disseminates wrong view point to the people who are naive to understand the complex topic.
Ever look at veggies grown in California? So much worse for the environment  then grass feed beef.
Great vid!
This correlates so well with the climate change video you guys made about searching for solutions, thank you for the hard work as always.
Why do the western libs assume that zero humans is the ideal situation? Self-hatred? That will explain their hatred for white people too.
Ok but, whyyy does the thumbnail keep changing??? It's disturbing me fr some reason lol 😣😥
Rapid anthropogenic global change is a hoax.
i love the fact the inhumane practice of torture-farming is the ecological one. I never cared bout the food animals anyway and i love the taste of suffering.  U still pitched plant diet against the worst, least "ecological" (no, the word for it is not "organic") meat. Thats still quite unfair.  If we give up on crops, we save more land than if we gave up on meat.  Where do we get vitamin b12 supplements from? Cuz if we phase out meat, will there be the supply for 8 billion ppl available? Or do we ration that and just have some ppl die of avitaminosis?  i dont think we can remove meat from the diet just to save the planet. Looks like with that, its either the planet, or the ppl. Maybe its about time we talked overpopulation?
Question- why do we want to make this planet last any longer?
I don’t care if the first light an animal sees is the one in my oven…. Come at me scrub-lords, I’m ripped! 💪
So rude at 6:20
Shilling for the industry again I see.
But what do we in Europe, where the cows graze on pastures which have been pastures since before the medieval, to do with South Americans burning rain forests for raising cattle, Europeans largely do not want to buy (Hello EU with your Mercosur crap) and not eat?  And why does the government not pay people to plant trees on their plots and instead wants more taxes to build windmills which are completely useless and a danger to the electricity grid because of their unreliability?
No. It’s not
Please don't tell me this is the last video for 12022 T_T
As a vegan I must say this video is well put together when it comes to the environmental side of veganism. However, it should be noted that vegans don't just go vegan for environmental or health benefits. Ethics are a huge component of that too. And while to save the environment it is absolutely ok to NOT go 100% meatless...  Being an ethical vegan means to reduce animal death and/or suffering as low as one physically is able to.

Ok but a lot of this is gonna get cut down over the years. I won't be surprised if we just genetically engineer better food.
Most of the world cusine over rely on Meat, making people defensive meat lovers. Holy cow indeed!
Currently we are failing to meet the basic nutritional needs of the human population. We are also failing to employ a large portion of our population. Although the demand for beef is to great at the moment, we cannot afford to rule it out as a valuable way to use land otherwise unproductive. The consequences of breaking down an industry won't be felt by those in positions who can afford drastic change. It will be felt by the people already suffering.  Mankind must reduce it's population to a sustainable level, reduce our consumption of beef, increase availability of nutrient rich alternatives to meat and utilise animals to its maximum potential.
For me, bg music is too loud and interferes with speech which I have trouble to understand as english is not my mother tongue. Thank you for great videos anyway.
Im still sticking to eating meat. I dont like vegetables that much
Hey but what about all the water almonds use in California 😂 bruh they take all the water 😂
I don't eat beef. I eat lamb 3-4 times a year. I eat usually pork and sometimes chicken.
My favourite is chicken anyway! Also any thoughts on sea food or fresh water fishes? How much do they emit?
I haven't eaten meat for years but i can't give up eggs, honey and dairy products, they are used literally everywhere and it's very hard to get foods without them especially in a bad city like mine
The human race is a virus eating away at the earth. I respect environmentalists and climate activists and people who are trying to make a change, I applaud your efforts. I find it bizarre that no one is talking about reducing/controlling human population growth.  Is that too touchy? Too radical? If we really love the earth that much, maybe the true altruistic solution is to let the human race die out and let the earth recover naturally, then a new species can begin again after millions of years. Such is the cycle of life and the universe. Remember the dinosaurs? No one is crying over their extinction.  But we the humans won't allow that to happen, because we value our survival above everything else and we see ourselves as the dominant and superior race in the known universe. We're not really 'saving' the earth. We're saving ourselves. We just need the earth to hold out longer and sustain us until we have the technology to leave it behind. Or the technology to transform it into whatever we need it to be.
Meat hate is just started by obnoxious and fascist vegans who want to push their unhealthy lifestyle on others instead of minding their own business. Most vegans are extremely unhealthy too. Balance your diet with vegetables and meat.

I would substitute animal protein for high quality microorganism based proten like bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and sweet water algae and insects, so called Single-Cell Proteins (SCP) if they were reasonably priced for a 1g of protein. For now, they're just novelty but production of 1g of SCP protein costs fraction of emmision and environmental resources so I guess it should be the future. Also, lab produced meat is option. I don't think conventional meat production should be cancelled but we can easily substitute even 75% of high quality proteins from alternative sources if we try to change industry and agree to consume SCP, insects flours and lab produced meat.
My problem with stuff like this, is they want to remove CO2.  We are actually at some of the lowest levels in Earths history for CO2.  The problem isn't CO2 being in the air, we could actually use a lot, and I mean a lot more of it.  The problem is it building to fast, causing global warming to happen faster than plants and animals can adapt.  Also, did this video take into consideration that many animal farms sell the manure to farms for fertilizer?  That those farms HAVE to use fertilizer because there is no way to replenish the nutrients fast enough by natural means.  Also, did it take into account that if everyone went vegan, you would have to convert all that farm land you freed up from animal use to plant the new crops that would be needed for the amount of calories needed to feed humans.  No, the key isn't to go vegan, a better idea would be to eat much much less red meat, and even get people use to insect protein.
Thanks for the FOOD for thought :)
To my very own discernment, I find meat eaters really weirdly stinky and kinda aggressive. 🤮🥵😭
We were made to need to eat meat. That’s why vegans need to supplement. Not eating meat is unnatural.
Did they really just left out all the suffering of such close-to-human when it comes to suffering beings? I'd never expect such a cruel approach from Kurzgesagt, the one main argument was ignored.
I like meat
Bugs are way more efficient just start eating that
please explain earth's rapidly weakening magnetic field
I totally did not watch the video, but as an omnivore, I enjoy eating meat.  So, yeah, meat is not bad  (I will probably watch the video though, after I make myself a home ground burger, with veggies on it, and a kale salad)
Let me start out by saying: I'm seeking to understand and not discredit.  But wouldn't produce shipped internationally still have to be distributed locally in addition to the carbon footprint of shipping internationally?
What about cultured meat?
Would have really liked if you guys had been able to incorporate the hunting and fishing option into this video in some way.
I'm a meat eater and will always eat meat, the less others eat the more for me.
The real issue isn't meat, it's meat agriculture. People should be hunting their meat and growing their plants.
This the natural result of overpopulation. The earth will sort itself out. Humans can’t exist forever. It also blows my mind that even with all of the food being produced that there are still people in parts of the world going without. Starve the obese people, feed the poor people.
I hope this insightful information make you guys choose vegetable than meat.   and I can choose meat more.
Mee-thane
The only issue I see is that you didnt take human nutrition into account. Not everyone wants to or can be vegan, or vegitarian. We shouldnt be forcing people, ever, to not eat meat or make it more difficult to get access to. Meat is super important in a healthy body, thats why there are very few, if any, high intensity sport athletes that are vegetarian or vegan.

Meat isn't bad but your mother is
It is not the meat that is bad, it’s the quality of the meat that is making us sick. Eat sick animals get sick. You can thank corporate farming. Peace.

Meat industry is quickly destroying everything because of human gluttony... But we have STILL have to try to sound neutral or risk making someone feel guilty... FML.
I will never become vegan, id still eat veggies but i will never give up the opportunity to eat a delicious steak, burger or hot dog.
Why this video looks like cannibalism?
This is why scientists need to run the world.
Earth just needs less humans.  We could change out diet to use human meat and then just consume our elderly and infirm.  Might clean up the genome a bit too.  What better way to honor your ancestors than making them a part of you?  And bacon is literally a g-d given right...for gentiles at least...
Between the causes of the emissions and the note about how more cruel farming practices are greener in terms of emissions, it got me thinking. It's not actually eating the meat that's causing emissions, it's that the animals are allowed to live in the first place. So a vegan diet doesn't directly reduce emissions, rather it allows for livestock to go extinct or at least greatly reduce in numbers depending on how well they do in the wild. If they do too well it might even be necessary to cull what remains to make the benefit significant. I wonder how much feral hogs emit, or how livestock compare to wild animals in general, and whether or not vegans who are vegan for the environment should support hunting. This leads me to think about moral questions I didn't expect to think about, such as at what point it becomes ethical to cause a species to go extinct, and whether or not being selectively bred to be livestock should be a factor or if it's purely a matter of cutting emissions due to long term consequences.
This gotta be the most disappointing Kurzgesagt video I’ve seen. Mentioned the argument of diet without talking about the dietary impact of meat vs other sources proteins (incl. insects). If the entirety of the video is on climate change, word your title properly - Is Meat Really That Bad ***For The Environment***? As a contrasting example, the CFC global movement in the 70s was a good, successful story on how humans collectively act for a good cause. It was so effective at stopping humans using the old fridges and aerosols that the ozone layer started to recover recently and will fully rejuvenate in the next few decades.   Why was it so effective? Because it was personal. Scientists pointed out the detriment of exponentially increased skin cancer rates in the southern atmosphere if the ozone layer continued to deplete. When you made arguments against meat consumption, where was the years of life, quality life, that are taken away by indulging such a lifestyle? Especially with the common cooking techniques for meat go beyond boiling temp (benzopyrene), smoke them (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) or ferment them (nitrosamines) or just eat them with fermented ingredients (nitrite), at least 20-30 years of lives are shafted. On a personal level, what a stupid decision and waste of life? From an economic standpoint, what a waste of human productivity? How can you not address them when making a video - Is Meat Really That Bad????
Bruh... Useless video
it's actually pronounced like   "methane"
Alternate title: *Asking @ThatVeganTeacher to “cancel” me*
Watching Kurzgesagt while eating nothing: 😔 Watching Kurgesagt while eating a whole buffet: 🥳
I think there should be more studies into male unusable land usable. I did see a ted talk about that using herdables... But ya save the rain forests
Is this really a question?
12.4k dislikes is like nothing
Video thumbnail should say the truth about meat or to be more accurate Meat is Unsustainable
you seem to have the problem, and the solution....or the substitute....for meat...
At 4:30 ish they talk about the ships and road transport. Sure let’s say ships do emit less co2, wouldn’t the plants have to be shipped to whatever market they’re being sold at via road too. Which would make the co2 from 2 to 20 because it adds the 18kg. Just wondering
Is it really the worst for the environment though? Cause it seems to be just storing things from the environment and then releasing them.
By "best beef" he is talking about factory farming cattle, in case you didn't catch that

Meat is delicious but there is no doubt the husbandry implemented by humans and the mass scale has caused problems for the environment.  But I'm still going to eat it and die happy.
Kurzgesagt kurz gesagt: Is meat really that bad? Yes. Yes it is.  Not even mentioning the antibiotics crisis we very likely are steering into by basically breeding bacteria that are immune to every antibiotic in existence because we pump all of them into the bazillions of animals.  But fuck the future generations, what have they ever done for us?
Imma still eat beef, simply because it's tasty.
There are so many areas we could improve. Imagine if freed up that land with fewer beef farms, with fewer cows, being used for lab grown meat, transported by clean energy, etc. etc. In every single area where we could do better, we should. Convincing everyone to just not eat certain things feels like a waste of time, when there are so many easier and objectively better ways to live off of animals.
As if we stopped eating beef our farmers would just giveaway their land back to wilderness. This is a misleading argument. BTW, I'm no regular meat eater, but I think the main reason to lower meat ingestion should be health related, not politics.
Basically a matter of opinion, I believe meat is good, another believes meat is bad. We respect eachothers views. the end.
aeroponics / hydroponics / vertical farming video please
honestly yeah.  Ruminants 90% eat stuff humans can't and your just wrong, the cycle has been in effect for over 1000s of years.
Best content you can find on YouTube. Thank you Kurzgesagt.
I will never give up meat
Who wishes YouTube never removed the dislike button
With the heavy focus on beef, I wonder how much is due to big fast food alone, while pretending like any of this is the average person's fault.
It's not fair to only look at the carbon output. There is an input of carbon in agriculture. Say, where do all those carbon emissions come from in the first place? Plants doing photosynthesis! All food consumed were carbon fixed anyway. It's a circle.
Meat is also proven to be worse for you. I still eat it, but cutting as much as you can is a major cancer reducer/heart improver/life lengthener.   So it’s better-ish for the environment and much better for you overall. You don’t need to be vegan/vegetarian— you just need a reduction in total meat consumption.   (And to those haters that say there’s a protein deficient, no there’s not. Otherwise, you’d hear about protein deficiencies in vegan diets. The only thing you really don’t get is b12, so take a supplement).
Fun fact: don't expect us to be different than animals we are also animals and we are carnivore so we have permission from everything else to eat meat
Is meat really that bad?   Only if it’s well done. That shit is terrible.
this issue is one of the dumbest, we have so many things things that create emmisions worse then comws and farms, we can't be trying to take on all the emmision issues at once or we are not going to overcome any of them
Honestly my goal in life is to be able to afford a waigu stake for every meal I eat. This changes nothing
I recycle, I don’t waste energy in my house, I don’t waste food and I don’t litter.  But I’m going to eat what I wanna eat and drive what I wanna drive and there ain’t nothing anyone can do about it.
Still love my stakes....
could you research this obsession with protein? protein comes from soil, and therefore is twice as prevalent in green vegetables than it is in meat. All biggest creatures to have ever walked this planet are plant eaters (herbivores) from the dinosaurs until today.
Honestly if we need to stop eating meat to save the planet from climate change just let it burn. I'd rather have meat rekt
Algae still makes sad noises. No mention of it's massive CO2 absorption ability. Instead we get bogged down in trees and grasslands 😔
Or you can change the consumerist culture around the world. The carbon emissions of leasing a brand new car every three years is not comparable to the emissions as a result of a lifetime carnivore diet
I hunt and raise my own livestock for the most part; doesn't bother me at all.
Regarding Anthropocentrism , do you think it’s right to consider what effects that the mass production of animals has on us? Rather than the whole species we are mass producing? Would love to hear your thoughts!
I amn`t want do anithing with that. I think it`s not actually, because not me not you not somebody outide can`t do anthin with that
Esse é o primeiro vídeo que eu vejo deles e penso "Nossa, que bela bosta em!"
9:35 I think this comparison is a bit disingenuous. Comparing a per year value with a per 100 year value just rubs me the wrong way. In actuality the numbers you tried to compare were 8 Tg/year (saved) and 50Tg/year (current use). I'm also not sure it would actually be 8 Tg/year, or just for 100 years on average.
What I don't understand is what they actually expect? It's not like stopping the consumption of cows would make their methane production stop, especially not with the lack of natural predators, so what, are we just going to kill all the cows and waste their resources? Cows aren't just beef, they produce milk too, and quite frankly, a human with a vegan based diet produces as much if not more methane than a cow. I would also like to add that animals and plants are also a two-way street, you may need plants to raise animals, but you also need animals for long term healthy farming. Plants don't grow without fertilization, and soil doesn't stay nutritious without animals rotting back into it, and farm land is also a lot less trees to produce us oxygene.
The alternative is to drastically reduce the numbers of cattle & not replace them. (Bovinicide?)  There's also the economics factors of developing nations like Brazil & the fact that we feed 6 billion more people today than, at anytime in the Earth's history before 1900. Perhaps if modern cities had much higher levels of self sustainabilty & "eat local" incorporated into them, the economics would change enough to make a difference. Supply & demand, it's not just for breakfast anymore...
Meat is not bad. There are carnivores and Omnivores, I love meat and I refuse to give it up. Eating meat is natural animals do it and humans have done it for thousands of years. If it's not to your liking then fine don't eat it. The human way of living is killing this planet way faster than any amount of cow farts could.
can we stop conflating veganism and vegetarianism? very different. vegetarianism is infinitely closer to a carnism than it is veganism
SOY, fluoride, mercury, microwaves, all poison
Voicing cow fart dribble.
Men shall bend there swords into plowshares, standing before the lord in bloody garments is an abomination, the Christ gave us wine and bread
Meat isn’t bad but killing another helpless harmless innocent animal is
Why do some people hate him for this , He is purely spitting fact
what plant product that good in term of protein value same as meat? interested to slowly adapt to vegan diet after watching this videi tho
Eat meat. Watch meat eater harvest your own meat. Or eat vegetables whatever just do it ethically and organic.
You are ignoring in your numbers that cattle can be grazed without destroying forests unlike all of the plant based subsitutes to meat.  We clear millions of acres of forest to plant the food then process it to create something with a pretty poor calorie density and then you no longer have the forests to help you deal with said co2 emmissions.  These issues with carbon footprint in meat production could be easily fixed if we allowed the animals to take care of wild lands as they produce nutrients that the plants need to stay healthy.  In many national forests in america you can graze your cattle and I think this could be a really good solution.  You cite the destruction of forests to cattle but this isnt necessary at all and really isnt practiced since it costs more money to clear the land than to just use it as is.  And for your last point you are ignoring that if we decided to go vegan or vegetarian then that land isnt going to be used to replant forests.  That land will most definitely be used to grow more soy to feed the ever growing population.  The world imagined by the people who push this is one where we all live in cities and most of the planet is used for growing grain.  Grain is a very poor crop for dealing with carbon emmissions as it isnt growing all year and most of the plant goes to waste anyway and gets disced into the soil.
If we became cannibals then we wouldn't be debating this 🙄
I have concerns about global averages,  because production methods are very different. In so-called developed nations, deforestation is not currently happening for either meat or animal agriculture. It isn't that it didn't happen, but it is not part of the current life cycle analysis, yielding very different impacts from countries which are currently converting rainforest to food production. If you can find lifecycle analyses relevant to food production in your state, I advise looking into those.
I used to like this channel I do I feel like this totali at this point. Meats bad. Nihilists are great. Anti Vaxers is anyone who ignors the science,  not also people just not wanting goverments controlling our bodies. Freaking shills.
Be a Carnivegan, hunt enough meat you need for survival, and don't buy beef. There are far too many deer as it is and rabbits are coming close to that as well in some parts of the US.
honestly... i don't remember when i ate beef last time.
No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old? I can think of something     Flossing
How much of the percentage of crops that animals eat is actually edible by humans
While I agree with literally every point in this video.... I can't help but overlook the fact you guys overlooked the relationship between cooked meat and the development of the human brain.
What I do is simple, eat less meat, and when I do, eat organical, free range, regenerative farmed beef  Or just less beef more chicken and fish I prefer chicken anyway
as a follow up to this video, I would love to see the Pros and Cons of an all vegetarian/vegan diet in comparison to the standard human's diet
You guys forgot to mention that cattle are commonly fed more things that humans can't eat other than grass such as corn husks that we can't use, and that most of the water used to feed them is rainwater.
I've heard that animals get mostly the parts of plants that the humans dont eat.
The vegans can cry and deny all they want, but aside from population control, cutting fossil fuel use by far helps the environment more than cutting beef consumption.  If industrialized nations would ration fossil fuel, it would also hasten the adoption to electric vehicles, which are getting cleaner and cleaner as power generation migrates to renewable sources.   Also, STOP FRACKING !!
The real aryan people are Vegan
Why does it need to be so black and white? It sounds like the best solution is to eat less meat, but I never see anyone talking about that as an option. You don't need to go vegetarian or vegan just to make a change.
Please leave meat. Its bad to kill animals just for our food
In the developed world, we throw out a large chunk of food that end up in the supermarkets. A large part of the population overeats, and we also mostly throw out organ meats.  All of these lead to unnecessary environmental impact.
Totally agreed. Thankyou for proper detailed analysis. So people can decide for themselves.
Bruh humans can create artificial meat
Not having dislikes sucks.
Don't forget about lab-grown meat, that's a great solution!
Sea transportation is super efficient, but we have to be aware, that products have to be transported to the ships. Exotic products (from my perspective exotic) like, for example, bananas, or soya beans dont grow in harbors. Usually they are transported from far away, with who knows what kind and how old vehicles. Im not convinced that buying some kind of meat from my local butcher will be more influential on atmosfear than vegies from far away lands. I dont want to say that tofu in northern Europe is worse than chicken, but I would like to see some real studies with serious calculations about that. Usually I just hear „sea transportation is the best”, but like I wrote, what about transportation before that?
If I only live once, I'm going to eat what I like regardless of the controversies
Dislike
I love steak though
9:15 okay but for the vegan diet calculations how much bio available protein are they assuming everyone  would get? i need well over 100g a day of animal based currently, which would probably be closer 200g of plant protein which on top of being awful to maintain might vastly throw off the calculations.
my solution is just have waaayy less kids. like 1 kid per 10 people. just one or two generation resets and we'd save the planet. being a parent is over rated.
The thumbnail has changed completely 🙄
I hate when people talk about minimizing their personal carbon footprint, you’re doing nothing. Oil rigs will undo your whole life’s work in a matter of seconds.
How this video has two tumbnail?
Why didn't you account for transportation from Shipping dock to store?
0:00 I have sumthin to show you my friend
on a lighter note do the math. human being equal one carbon credit. you want to reduce your carbon footprint reduce the number of human beings on this planet. humans eat food the production of food produces co2. eliminate the need for food eliminate the production of excess co2. see how easy math is.
I suffered from malnutrition and malabsorption my whole life wasn't able to eat a lot of beef for meat or animal fats. later in life I worked hard and was able to overcome my digestive issues and I began to include more and more protein in my diet. animal protein and high quality fats are absolutely essential for a modern lifestyle. for a person who works 8 hours a day everyday and then has around the house to do on the weekends and it's a full life. you need real nutrition not empty calories and for me eating beef and eggs in large amounts every day are the only two foods that are sustainable that don't make me sick and provide enough energy by volume. if you don't eat the energy density that you need you end up eating far too much bulk more volume than is necessary and you waste energy digesting all this garbage and you don't get the protein and the high quality fats your body needs to thrive. all your body needs is protein and high quality fat and you don't want sugars or carbs in your diet. when you start eating this way you realize what's wrong with the modern diet. the problem with the modern diet is it contains things other than high quality animal protein and high quality fats.
4:25 I get that freighter transport is really efficient, but how do the avocadoes get to my landlocked country with less land travel than my local beef?
That vegan teacher:yes
2:42 Nutrients = kcal? What about micronutrients? What about bioavailability?
this channel is becoming more and more political than when it was
you will never take my right to enjoy the taste of dead
Here's another way to cut emissions. Hold China responsible for their commitments.
12.3k dislikes. Bruh.
How changing your diet would make difference? All products u would consume still be produced massively to seek profit even it’s a vegan product. Not to mention that they re very hard to digest, and gives less nutrients. What about fish farms in terms of carbon prints? Why everyone has to be vegan or consume lab-meat? I guess these solutions are dictated poorly by super rich people like bill gates (as we know his organization have funded this channel) because they have invested so much for these future opportunities. The guy even trying to fill atmosphere with chalk dust in order to reflect light without thinking about consequences. My ancestors were settlers, they have produced all kinds of diary products and trade with them to get what they need. They were well fed and healthy. There was no global warming in fact there was global cooling before 20th century. Now we are in world system “capitalism”. Even though meats and other products massively produced, countries like mine(3rd world)only rich people can consume meat, and they overconsume while others suffer. And vegan products usually costs much more and it seem like a price tag to become careful way of living as environmentalist and announcing it by taking this overpriced products to gain or at least thinking to gain social status. Everything feels so fake especially after the pandemic. It does not feel like natural development of thinking but ideas that dictated by massive media they got. I am not conspirator. I ve seen African people suffering from famine no one did give a damn, now suddenly everybody become concerned that how would they feed the world. This is dictated SSCB before for different purposes and those times world media was advertising first mcdonalds in moscow. As a technology we are so close to colonize other planets even if they re nonhabitable, I guess these god rich people should try their chance to create their own colony and perfect societies(by perfect I do not reallly know what is their perfect maybe full of Epstein guys)on those not the world that we are living free.
In ecology, I learned that when energy flows from one tropic level to another, the efficiency decreases by 90% only 10% energy is transferred, so yeah!
I think going beef-free is a good start. But man people will fight for their right to grill beef.
I don’t eat beef often. Maybe 2 or 3 times a month. Its rough because beef is my husbands favorite food, and he makes comments about disliking when I replace beef for ground turkey. I dont prefer the taste of beef, not to mention it’s more calories, has more health risks when eaten regularly, and of course it’s bad for the environment.
You kinda forgott about what would happen to all the animals from those farmlands
This just made me hungry for a burger
we should eat bugs for protein instead!
Meat and eggs: Best and most nutritional foods in the world
This information is true, but most of the things people love and depend on are carcinogenic. Alcohol, meat, cigarettes, drugs etc. It's a scheme people are not guilty
4.8 million people just saw this video in 11 days. That’s amazing
In india we treat Cow as mother,  mother  whose milk we use, it is respected and treated very well in hindu religion. Beef and other non veg is strictly prohibited 🚫 here.   Edit:-  I am just stating fact, i don't mean anything good or bad.
So clear. So rational. It will take some powerful dissonance to ignore these facts
This channel is the GOAT
Interesting bar vitamin C slight efficiency you can actually survive on potatoes unlike beef.
Kurzgesagt is a propaganda production machine
There’s also the option for a pescatarian diet if you can eat seafood, or just eating less meat it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Also hunting was never mentioned once in this video and I wanna know what effect that has on the planet
I mean we are so close in creating meat  in a lab.If we would be able to mass produce food that way it would have a huge impact on pullution but then again humans and their stupidity is whats stopping research
What about killing half of human kind!!?
meat should be beaten
8:17 the best part of the video
Thought I'd check in to see if the channel would correct itself on some of the false reporting it's done on beef but nup, seems like they're either still missing a big part of the picture or falsely representing the data on purpose
Science -  Banning Bacon will stop the climate from changing   Me -   Sorry kids,  they said you are doomed
From National Geographic:  “Scientists have measured big increases in the amount of methane, the powerful global warming gas, entering the atmosphere over the last decade. Cows or wetlands have been fingered as possible sources, but new research points to methane emissions from fossil fuel production—mainly from shale gas operations in the United States and Canada—as the culprit.”
Nahh I'm good. Just gonna let the future generations suffer from shortage of meat.
You can simplify this when you think about it this way, the more "energy steps" between you and the food you eat, the more energy gets wasted from the initial "energy packaging". Plant makes proteins/carbohydrates, then the animal has to eat it, then you eat the animal, and so on. Every step produces waste before the energy gets to the next step. So yeah a plant based diet, as far as you can go with it, is always more energy efficient.  The real issue is overpopulation tho.
If meat is bad then why is it made out of food          (This is a joke btw)
you will live in a pod you will eat the bugs you will own nothing and be happy   welcome to the new world order
Alright yes you should eat less meat in general and try to eat the least amount of red meat possible. But as you said at the start food production isn’t the biggest factor of climate change. Do change your diet but also vote green because the only way we save the planet is by putting people who see climate change as a major issue in control of big powerful countries.
This video transitioned into a Skillshare ad too fluently after a profound point. I appreciate the sponsors but can we at least separate them a bit more from the main "meat" of the video, instead of using a forced segue after a prolific point that should be contemplated for more than 1 second?
As being an pure healthy vegetarian, I wonder how human beings are still eating animal muscles as millions of yrs ago 😂
8:18 not stonks
Click here for dislike
E
Short answer : YES
So if the animals themselves are the major reason of methane then wouldn't it make things worse in the long run if everyone goes vegan? If we all go vegan then we won't use these animals and they will live on their own; reproducing, increasing in numbers, releasing even more methane and eventually screwing up all of us?
I have a question! Let say you go fully vegan, are there any vegan products that are still excessively bad for the environment?
I eat meat
Love your videos! Can you do a video i  what a helathy diet looks like? How to compensate for/substitue meat?
Man why am I even watching these kinds of videos. They always give me a taste for burgers.
Also controversial, but can you make a video on what a healthy diet looks like? How to substitute meat based products?
Meat is just yummy thats it.
Yes meat is terrible for you      If your a 90 pound liberal whose scared of everything and replaced their blood with b00sters
Part of me wonders if population control would be an option? Have less kids over the next handful of generations. Less mouths to feed might mean less food to make? Idk
I wish I didn't need to kill animals for food 😔honestly
Meat and eggs are the best nutrients sources human can eat. It's natural for humans. Antimeat is political and economical agenda. Myth about envariomental impacts has been debunked many times.
Eating meat is the best thing in the world. Makes you a superstrong man. Not eating meat makes you a feeble minded weakling. What you eat will have no impact whatsoever on global warming.  Dont believe that lie. You choose what to do with this information.
What i love about this clip, is the fact that what he’s saying and what’s being shown in the animation is a double edge sword
Even if people switch over to vegan things, factory's will still produce the same amount of meat and other products. That's why it doesn't really make sense to me going vegan.
We've been hunting, eating and crafting the tools to do so long before we evolved into modern humans by hundreds of thousands of years. Meat is most likely why we evolved into modern humans. In fact it has made our species so intelligent that we now have excess energy input to our brains allowing us to overthink issues and make absolutely retarded conclusions like meat is bad.
wtf is this misleading title? I though this was supposed to be a video about health pros and cons of eating meat, not MUH "GLOBAL WARMING" Political Hoax
I love how Kurzgesagt gives FACTS but stay away from political agenda, letting you know the truth and the fact that your’e the only one to chose what to do. I honestly belive that (even though I’m not vegan nor vegetarian) an utopic future would be vegetarian. I hope Technology will show us the way to make cruelty free alternatives that are 100% same flavour, texture, etc
I got 7 seconds into this vid and HAD to stop and look at the comment section...
so mammuts also change climate by produce too much metan and co2? today animals is nothing compare to megafauna
It isn't meat that is bad for the environment. It's humans. We are too extreme.  We don't need to eat as much meat as we do. Industrial scale farming is damaging because there's too much of it going on. There is a level where it is sustainable, but it will never produce enough meat to satisfy some people's apparent need to eat it several times per day.  On the other end of the spectrum, we have people calling for the elimination of meat products (and therefore a heck of a lot of animals) entirely. Which would have disastrous consequences of its own. It is just as extreme as the excesses of the meat industry.  Like it or not, we have nutritional requirements, some of which obtaining as a vegan involves processes which scaled up would cause entirely new environmental catastrophes. Take omega 3 for example, vegans are told that this is present in walnuts, but what isn't being said is that the walnut has as much Omega 3 in it as a carrot has retinol. However, unlike the carotenoids in the carrot which we can readily make into retinol, we don't convert the compound in the walnuts (or any other vegetable sources of ALA or GLA) very well. Not enough to get the RDA. Algae are currently used to make vegan omega 3 supplements. But scale that up in order to provide omega 3 to all of humanity, and how much of our water will we be giving up?   Because of the misconceptions about proteins (eg, that you can't get enough protein from a vegan diet, which you *can* it is just a bit more complicated) a lot of vegans went hell for leather on quinoa, which has had negative effects on the food security of some South American nations.  The intentions are good, but the applications were not considered.  Sure, we could cut carbon emissions by doing away with all livestock, but we would also cut the nutritional benefits of our food and then that would be the thing threatening our survival.  We need to veer away from extremes, because all they will do is kill us all.
Theres no difference if methane gets in atmosphere from cows or dissolving grass.
The thing is, humans need to consume meat.
One obvious flaw: international food transport ALSO needs to be transported locally. At the origin and at the destination. So 2x the local traffic, plus the shipping. To claim local transport uses more CO2 is just ridiculous. I’m not going into detail on anything, I’m sure much more capable Youtubers will. Just pointing out something really basic.
I am omnivorous so I am well balanced 😋😜
Just plant more trees all over the world and problem solved...
4:29 a gdzie wypalanie lasów i olbrzymie ilości wody użyte do produkcji? Wasza wiarygodność jest słaba
littlery was like i dont like meat anymore stop eating for years
Not sure about its nutritional values, but I hate anything that slips between my teeth. lol
bull
This is going into a level of absurdity
I am shocked that there are still, in that day and age are people, who disagree with all that. It doesnt really takes long to resurche all that. Be better people.
what ever happened to that video talking about the opposite of this    if there even ever was one
send this to vegan people :))))
Plz upload a space video those are the video which fascinates me the most
4:43 as an alternative, would it be possible to transport food via freight train? It would be more efficient than the trucks and there would be less carbon dioxide emissions
I think I don't wanna go vegan or vegetarian to preserve forest that will have to be cleared for plantation or farm
Dislike button: -----| |--------------------------- V
what about cultivated meat?
So the avacados magically get from the shipping port to the store?
Jock O Wee Doodoo : Let's destroy forest to make 🌾🌾🌾
Feel like we could use that methane that animals emit
Love Your Art, it's a shame only Dollars and don't have Credit Card
“food is arguably the best thing about being alive” not when you have an eating disorder :/
Excess and over population are the real problem
Everyone else: Meat isn’t that bad. Vegans who force their lifestyle on others: *eat this salad or D.I.E*
Kurzgesagt I love you...but how are your only topics Diet, Local, and Land use...while omitting ETHICAL considerations? Oversight or wilful avoidance?
8:12  I didn't except Kurzgesagt to slip a meme in lol
Well the only way this ever changes is through legislation and good luck getting into power with I want to ban cheeseburgers is your slogan even if it’s to save the planet people aren’t smart enough To value the planet in 20 -50 years over the immediate enjoyment of a delicious cheeseburger from McDonald’s so we have to try and find other ways people are actually willing to sacrifice to combat climate change I promise you if you make this your main issue ………or actually you know what…. if you made climate change your issue at all it doesn’t even matter I don’t think people are going to care enough to ever change any aspect of it I think we’re all just screwed I don’t think there would be enough people for a sizable enough voting block for about another 50 to 100 years which is well past the we’re screwed date regarding the current climate crisis so we’re kind of fucked and it’s going to happen evidently regardless of whatever we do so I’m just kind of here watching the world burn at this point and I don’t care anymore I’ll be dead by the time all the shit hits the fan anyways
Very informative. One thing I had a question is it true that organic land waste (and of which food waste is a major portion) is the largest source of methane / carbon emissions? Do reducing food wastage is of concern in this regard?
Honestly, I think the only thing that will solve this problem is if lab grown meat or plant based meat that tastes the same as normal meat is adopted by the meat industry since people definitely won't make the type of unselfish choice that would require them to let go of meat. Will be more efficient in every way in the future and huge strides are being made on the research.  Now before you say, "I won't trust what they create," I should point out that we have been eating food like that since the Industrial Revolution like sodas, jello, ice cream, gum, yogurt, energy drinks, protein powders, bread products, chips, chocolate and all of fast food every single year. Every one of those are mostly created artificially. More of those new food products are created every single year. You eat most of them without ever considering how they're made, so it doesn't make sense for you to be wary of one more food item
Tried vegan and it did wonders until it was hard to maintain. Want to start again! Also thought I'd share: Jesus loves you and desires a relationship with you! Won't you open up the door and accept him into your heart today? Pray, read his word and repent! He is coming again soon, stay safe and God bless!
we need to use the plants and meats native to area's more
So... Conclusion of this video: It is incredibly obvious that meat is bad for literally everything, but since telling you this will make you irrationally mad about it, we're not going to directly say it to you and leave it up to you
Eat like us asians, less meat more veggies. You dont really need that much protein a day. Also less processed food and dont forget probiotics.
As someone who works with farmers and agriculture and loves thinking outside of my.comfort zone, I appreciate this video so much. I've been debating the whole meat free/reduced meat diet for a while and having resources like yours always adds so much to the conversation
I hope someone is paying you guys a lot for all this propaganda
I don’t get why people must be so extremem like being radically vegan or pro meat. Just use an 80:20 rule when eating meat. According to their statistics pork and chicken is a great alternative if more people used it and when eating steak and lamb, that’s where the 80:20 rule comes in, so just lower portions. Corporations then are under less pressure to engage in malpractice like poor hygiene standards and pumping antibiotics into livestock, reducing their effectiveness. Also means maybe a larger share of those more climate effective dairy cows can double as beef cows. Though it was also really insightful, I’m even conflicted between between the grass fed standard and carbon footprint, being conscious of both impacts. But the mad respect for this video is for its discussion nature. They might make a vague statement but never really push an agenda. Props to that
Yeah man ill go to eating The air so that i hurt ozone not you Sensitive nerds
While the emphasis is cherrypicked for climate change a lot of information on raising cattle was missed.  For example by having ruminants graze naturally, a grassland that is poor will eventually be restored over a short span of time, say 20 years. This means absolutely no grain finishing as this removes the cattle from the pasture. This naturral process sequesters carbon and allows the bacteria in the soil to flourish as one isn't spraying insecticides on the crops.  As for cattle consumption, people are going to have to get past not eating what is known as offal, that is, kidneys, livers, stomach, heart, intestines, brains tongue, etc. over half of the animal is essentially waste from a human consumption perspective. Eating cattle that is grass finished, means the whole damn thing has to go to market.  Consumption of offal would all by itself reduce the numbers of cattle needing to be raised and slaughtered by about half. It used to be that was what happened but first world humans like the skeletal meat far more than organ meat, but it should be sold and consumed. It just has to be cooked right to taste more palatable.
Why China is Separated？？？
Not stonks 8:15
Seriously amazing. Non partial straight facts. Left the viewer only with the facts and a choice. Im personally not gunna stop eating any meats but im so much more informed and feel good to have been let make my own choice. This is the future of information
I fully agree on focusing on global impact for what your diet should be rather than "ohhh the poor baby chickens"
did I just see a bird eating burger
Even if Jeff bezos and Elon musk pooled their resources and rebuilt grasslands, and even if every single person in the world switched to vegan diet we would still be mostly fucked. We know society is going to end in less than 100 years and we can’t do a damn thing to stop it. That’s why I won’t have kids. Their chance to live a decent life is so astronomically small that I’d feel like a bad parent for even giving them life. I’m just going to stay comfy, play video games and wait for my life to end. I don’t want to be a part of society anymore.
How are your animating skills soo good that you can make high quality animations videos in just few days? that's just amazing,and I also like the way you try to make science more fun to read and undertand,keep this hardwork up 👍❤️
Kurz, Ive recently been doing lots of research regarding crypto currency. Can science shed some light on how it affects us with regards to energy consumption if its worth it for the future? Thanks a bunch!
both, both is good   *food is food*
Lol
In my opinion only some meat is bad for you, amazing video man and have a good day everybody :]
So since we can’t eat them, can we still kill cows?? If no than can we control there breeding ? no? So we still have to feed them…so why do we have to stop eating them?
Fun fact: When covid 19 started, lots of vegans went quiet. It has been found that Covid 19 drains your vitamin b12 in your brain. Vegans happen too have an extremely low vitame b12 diet since most of it comes from animal product. Why is that? Because only a few animals can produce vitamin B12 from being exposed to sun light. Cows are great at making vitamin b12. Humans can produce some but not enough for survival espicially since we spend most our time inside buildings away from the sun. Plants do not produce vitamin b12. You can get vitamin b12 from meat but its not the only way because milk and cheese also has lots of it.  Some people argue that they are vegans and are getting their vitamin b12 from energy drinks, if you are one of those then i have bad news for you: You are not a vegan because the vitamin b12 from those drinks comes from animal proeucts.  So what happened to those true vegans that went quiet? Well they died. Because when you dont have enough vitamin b12 in your brain, your brain stops working. Plants do not have brain organ so they do not need vitamin b12.
9:35 Summary
I love this channel so much. so informative and I love the narrators voice.
That's it I'm going vegan
As a trucker I respectfully disagree to the conclusion. There are much more issues in this argument and even if the entire world went vegan it would lead to the eventual destruction to the market as billions starve to death while trying to eat food that has less and less nutrient value every year and people get fatter and fatter and slowly eat themselves to death. That is just one of many, many issues to a chain of issues caused by corporate greed and government corruption.  My conclusion would be for more cooperation between environmentalist, vegans, farmers and ranchers. And we may need to break up the major food companies as many of the issues in farming are being caused by the major food companies pressuring the farmers and ranchers to do what they want to do.
1 question why doesn't everyone bully china or india for mass pollution?
I’m not thrilled with how this video only briefly covers the difference in nutrient contents between meat and plants. Yeah, the best meat will be worse than the worst plant, but growing the worst plant at a high enough scale to match meat in nutrients and calories will be just as if not more damaging. That’s a REALLY important topic because the worlds population CANNOT support an entirely plant-based diet. People would have to die. A lot of people. And even then, so much native and forestland would have to be destroyed to support that much agriculture that it would be suicidal.
The Problem many vegans ignore is that most vegan beliefs are DEEPLY rooted in eugenics and colonialism. The belief that hunting and eating animals is bad is suspiciously tied to attacking indigenous peoples and cultures in which meat is important or a part of their culture. Vegans talk a lot about “not using the land for agriculture” but this means people WILL die. Vegans know exactly who will starve first.   Point is, all food has a footprint. The question is not pinning it on one component, but trying to find more efficient and humane ways to produce food as a whole. The meat argument is pointless and downright stupid. Meat isn’t the problem. That’s like saying plants are evil because palm farms are ruining environments. Some meat is problematic, just as some plants are problematic. This war against meat is suspicious and I don’t trust it because of how heavily it supports eugenics beliefs.
no its not. plant protein isnt the same as meat protein. ive never met a cool  vegan or vegetaria
Love this! Explains perfectly without being belittling to viewers. Switching to plant 🍔!
I like meat
My conclusion. Let the Earth burn.
propaganda much lol
This is fake
From the Smithsonian Magazine:  “In a survey of around 11,000 Americans, the organization found that 84 percent of vegetarians and vegans return to eating meat, says the Huffington Post. Most lapse within a year, while nearly a third don't last more than three months.”
The soy and cereals part was misleading. The soy which is produced then fed to cattle is inedible to humans. The stems and husks of the plants are what’s fen to livestock
cant stop us from eating meat. i mean technically we were meant to do that anyways (not saying veggies are bad)
Nah, meat is pretty good with salt, pepper and olive oil.
Until I start seing a more "official" world movement on this. (Meaning, that countries starts to implement laws for it...) I will lean on the side scepticism. And assume we won't get anywhere with it in practise. The moderate efforts individuals put in to change their diet/life style, is unlikely to make much of a difference I think. I already have very low energy, so I would rather not spend the rest of that on my diet! As soon as the world makes it more approachable, I'll be there and ready to sign up.
To piggy back on the "buying local isnt always better" thing, some crops are grown far more effently in some areas over others, so once you account for transportation its still just better to grow it in the "easier" place. An example would be growing citrus in CA year round outdoors and shipping it across the country, vs growing it indoors in a colder, maybe less sunny or hospitable part of the US, although potentilly closer to more customers.
Another thing I always like to point out is that if there are people wanting to become vegetarian/vegan but have a hard time giving up meat, you don't have to do it all at once. A reduced meat/dairy diet is a really good way to start that!
Don't get rid of meat, just go with chicken or fish, continue to eat vegetables, soy, and beans. We can lower our carbon footprint.   Chicken also takes less resources to raise.
Caution should be taken when interpreting these statistics.  The paper it is based upon is global sources, and aggregates data from countries where agricultural practices are extremely inefficient.  In the US, these efficiencies are continually improving and produce a FRACTION (~20Kg CO2/Kg) of the CO2 emissions cited here (~70Kg CO2/Kg!).   The comparative nutrition argument breaks down very quickly when this factor is taken into account.  There is also much room to improve in the emissions arena, via regenerative farming practices and technological improvements.  We should aspire to the ideal when making conclusions and not be resigned to the current predicament in which we find ourselves.  Cheers
You guys didn't really mention how animals can eat useless plant bi products like corn husks and turn them into valuable products.
I mean yeah if you live in America I guess
No, oil companies pay for campaigns to push this narrative.  Oil, coal, fossil fuels owned and ran by massive multi-billion companies are what is responsible for the vast majority of pollution, so shill for them by embracing these lies and pushing blame on consumers.  Issues with food are not exclusive to meat, we have an INSANE amount of waste.
This just seems more like a “why beef is bad” video than a “why meat is bad” one
Still not eating insects.
no
Based
I mean it's pretty tasty it ain't bad
wait i thought this was meat love not meat hate...
this doesn't change the fact that i have lost all hope in mankind and that i just want to kill myself
This is coming from a bunch of liars huh.
I love 🍖 🥓 🥩
The weird demonization of soy doesn't help either as well as the cultural stigma of being vegan or vegetarian. Soy is 17g of protein per 0.25 cups or 2 oz as well as about 15% of your daily intake of iron.
Frying up a juicy NYstrip. mmmmmm
the earth was visibly recovering through lockdown and animals were still being bred. there was still animals, if not, more than before the lockdown. so the answer is no, its not that bad.
Thank you for animating in 60Hz
I know what I like and it is meat.
I wish the older generation would have caused less emissions; so that we could not worry about the emmision while eating at the same time.
can you guys make a video comparing the pollution of other industries compared to farming and agriculture? it doesn't seem fair to select a bit of information like this if youre not gonna show the full picture. what is the biggest contaminant on earth?
Remember that on video where you all said, "We are lying to you." ??
- all the cow farts in the world could not bring the Earth to its end. Silly humans, cows are for food. -
Another important factor into consideration is health among other factors
plant based eating is so much easier then when i switched 6 years ago. go vegan learn something new. your body and the planet will thankyou.
i know this platform doesn't like comments like these, but we are overpopul*ted that's the problem
I'm going to KFC for lunch today. Its poultry so less emissions than beef, and with the amount of it I eat its going to kill me much earlier. Since i'm going to die of a heart attack at 50 or so im going to be emitting for less time. You should all be thanking me for eating KFC.
It's weird how cannibalism would solve most of the world's issues

Lol im mongolian i born eating meat i cant live withput it i rather DIE
Is consuming animal corpse that bad? Corpse is scientifically classified as filth. And the human body isn't made to get rid of it quickly enough. Emissions are the least of your worries.
There we go with the dislike extension this video has 12k DISLIKES HOLY SHIT!!
>"Is meat really that bad?"  >talks about climate change in the first minute
I'm never going to stop eating meat, if people have a problem with that then is their problem.
It's a shame we can't make a plant that grows meat
Tako
I sent in a message to you to ask about this very issue. I didn't hear back, but low and behold - an entire video responding to my question. Thank you! One question I still have - how do I know if I'm getting beef that's *actually* better for the environment? They advertise grass-fed beef, but I don't remember ever seeing advertising for dairy-designated beef
added comment
You forgot to mention that rotational grazing sequesters carbon.
Meat is good !
It's curious you forgot to take into consideration that animal protein is much richier then vegetal protin (more complete aminoacids).  Animal foods are the highest quality protein sources. Plant sources lack one or more amino acids, which makes it more difficult to get all the amino acids that your body needs. So you need much more vegetables (in weight) to replace meat. The fact that you compare meat with potatoe is ridiculous in terms of protein source.
Your graphic designer is class hope s/he is paid well!
CO2 is good for plants
The planes used to be rolling with buffalo so the cow farts thing is a little bit far-fetched. The problem isn't our food the problem is third world countries allowing deforestation. I mean take California for instance or any other state typically in a drought, water can either be created nor destroyed by man yet we act like water is always about to just disappear like it's not a renewable resource. Not only this but we encourage people to have yards that don't require watering which means no plants. Imagine if everybody didn't have a limited water and we we could make everything green again. Because more plants means less CO2. Cows ain't the problem.
Would be great if you did a video on regenerative farming and how the use of livestock (like cattle) actually can help climate change because it mimics the natural grazing pattern of animals. Regenerative agriculture results in an increase in soil carbon deposits, water retention, plant and insect biodiversity, and improved pasture conditions. Not to mention it cuts down on greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution and creates nutrient-dense crops.
Cant live without meat. Gotta lower the emmisions from somewhere else
Please be vegan 🙏 👍 please to save the planet be vegan 🙏🙏🙏🙏
This video's thumbnail changed like "You should treat yourself", to "You should k¡II yourself... Now!"
Bettridge’s law.
I like meat and no one can stop me from eating it even if I'm the last person on the planet that still dose
What would be the implication of going totally meat free while still meeting all of our nutrient requirements? Is it possible that even if we converted all pasture and animal feed crops to farmland for human food, we'd still need a lot more land to meet those requirements since animals are so much more protein rich than any vegetarian option?
i think that people trust kurzgesagt mostly because of the cool accent
How do the ships emit so little emissions compared to car? I’ve heard that they are huge polluters.
Video idea:talk about how white holes form (ok if you don’t) and what will happend If a black hole and white hole collides
...but...the question was so vague...is beef really that bad: for you to eat? Is beef really that bad: for the environment? And instead of answering all the questions that complete that sentence...you tackled global warming...which is something WE CANT CHANGE...its the simple reality that a mass majority of people don't care....shit you people are blaming the Amazon Forest for climate change now...and thats a natural phenomenon...  Then the methane...from cows....what are you going to do with the cows? Because them living causes the methane...you gonna kill em? Whatcha gonna do with that waste of meat? Either way, more land means more potential forest fires which just goes back to the Amazon Forest discussion...  Climate change is not that big a deal...it's a real thing...yes...because that's the nature of the Earth...ya know like the Ice Age? That scientist have said has happened more than once because...that's what the Earth does?   In the end...No meat isn't bad...it's best in small servings, no one needs eight pounds of steak in their stomach...no one...but the human body can digest meat, and it's perfectly fine to eat it. It's morally doesn't matter because I'm not changing my life style to make one's feelings and emotions better...worry about something more important...like your own life, the Earth is just fine. And it will be when we're dead and our kids are adults with kids.
If you eat plant based then you don't need to cut down forests for pastures and if you use organis fertilisers, harmful gases won't be released in the environment either.
I’m surprise he didn’t mention dietary concerns of meat vs plant-based meat products.
I'm probably never gonna give up eating meat, I mean, plant-based alternatives taste like shit. But I guess I wouldn't care that much if the government just banned meat, hypothetically speaking. I'd just have to get used to food tasting not as good.
I love how they just dont start sayn their point at the bigining  They first show us the facts and then let us make a conclusiom
nope its all pat of the climate change caused by people bs scam that they use as a excuse to change policy they never otherwise could.
I've been vegan for eight years. Best decision I've ever made. I'll be plant based till the day I die.
I mean, I go for regenerative meats where possible and not using cattle on land that has no other value in food production is just plain useful. You can also use them for reforestation if you allow them to free graze over large areas of land or have them temporarily feed in places facing desertification as they pack the land and manure helps to fertilize it. Granted, ownership over select land areas for growing means you can't constantly be using all of the land you have for cattle. That's true. Just as true as you can't reuse the same plot of land for veggies endlessly cause you'll cause it to become nutritionally barren, even if the crop itself is generally a good crop
No mention at all of how animals generally act like a recycling center for our food industry making sure the things we don't eat don't go to waste and how that factors into things. In fact there's a slick little transition around 8:20-8:30 where they completely gloss over the fact cows generally eat all the parts of plants that we don't eat (like the stalks in all that grain shown being harvested) by switching quickly to how chicken and pigs need to eat human food.   Almost seems like they're boiling down a complex and nuanced issue to suit their own prejudices and worldviews and have the gall to present it as objective fact.
I don’t know what happened between upload and now, but the cow was happy with hearts, why is it coming from the eternal damnation of hell to speak
No
Nice try vegans
0:04 I beg to differ
Should've driven the stake in harder and just said maybe it's time to consider switching. :P Didn't talk about all the negative health effects of a beef or meat heavy diet either. Didn't really talk about the over fishing of oceans or the non-CO2 based destruction that farming animals can cause. Things like hormones from cow waste leeching into rivers. The fact that feeds for cattle in factory farms (the largest source of beef) are fed with low quality feeds that are often sprayed with toxic pesticides that leech into the environment, not to mention their impact on your health.   Good that you got into how buying local isn't necessarily saving resources, although I think you oversimplified by focusing mainly on transportation and not diving more into the packaging which you briefly mentioned. Some stores are doing refillable containers of locally processed organic goods which could potentially put a huge dent in emissions and waste, as well as improve quality of the food being produced, increase biodiversity of plants (through promotion of heritage crops), and improve the health of the people who eat it. There are plenty more changes we could make to improve the food system and shave away at that 26%.
okay and all of that is true but why is kurzgesagt food so appetizing
If people truly wanted to be more green, they'd move out of the big cities to create more rural communities focused on local food sourcing, relying on their communities to be self sufficient rather than relying on huge corporations for their sources of food, but that would be too boring, hard, and not hedonistic enough.
Didn't you do this video several years ago?
There's no conscious consumption under capitalism
Holy shit halfway this got dark
I love meat
I wonder if anyone ever thought that instead of burning and entire forest down and building a structure maybe there's a way they could build the structure above the forest 🤔
Now remember children, if you see a mean vegan in the wild, find the freshest chicken sandwich you can and eat it right in front of them!
Can't we build special environment for kattle to sort out and then utilize the methane as fuel?
I know this video is about the effects of eating meat on the environment. But I cannot help but feel there is a little bias towards the farming and eating of meat (Beef) being the worst for the environment. I would be great if we could get a video on "if vegetables are that good ".   Great video as always.
Wew
We are Omnivores, we just eat way too much meat.  Humans would not have evolved without it.  Cows will even eat meat if you put it in their feed.
wait, 3 billion hectares of land can remove 800 billion tonnes of CO2 over 100 years? and we produce 50 billion per YEAR? so we would (mathematically) produce 5000 billion tonnes over 100 years? that means not even 3 billion hectares of land cannot reduce the CO2 accumulating in our atmosphere as in a 100 years 4200 billion tonnes would have been added by then minus degrading over time?!
Then I have decided, that I will eat meat and all others type of food <3
so basically our population numbers are already unsustainable
I don't care. Beef is good, screw the world.
I think we do need meat humans been eating meat far longer than us farming we evolved to to meat and planets not just planets or just meat
It's really interesting to see what hot topic veganism is and what advice they are giving after different videos. When it's a video about Covid, at the end of the video, there often is the advice that we have to get vaccinated, we have to wear masks, we have to social distance, ... if we want this pandemic to end. When it's a video about climate change in general, at the end of the video, there often is the advice that we have to drastically cut our greenhouse gas emissions if we want to stop global warming. It's different though when they talk about meat when they scientifically explain how it's really bad for the climate, how there are much better options, and how claims like "we're using the Earth's surface in an efficient way" are just marketing tricks. In that case, at the end of the video, they tell you it's up to you to decide what to do with this information. They just gave you all the information which only lead to a few very similar solutions, but they won't dare to talk about them.  I'm not really blaming science communicators for this. In the end, if they would only be "half rational" (saying the right thing without thinking about what it will actually cause), a lot of people would stop listening to them. Very likely those who they are trying to reach. What it says about the people who are making these videos, is that they are not just science journalists but science communicators who know how to communicate. But it especially says a lot about this society, where a lot of people stop listening to you if you say something which they don't like, even though it's still true. Living in your own reality is just too comfortable. But I really think they are being a bit too careful. Yes, perhaps the message at the end of the video shouldn't be "You're a really bad person if you're still eating meat", but it could at least be something like "Going vegan or at least vegetarian might really be a good idea. And if you only eat meat like once a month, you could still do better, but you already did a lot."
Can you please stop your useless obsession with CO2 emissions. For God's sake, your own breath is a CO2 emission, so do we stop breathing?
If one day science is able to determine that plants, vegetables, do on fact feel pain, would vegetarians and vegans eat them?
electrical vehicles are bad for the environment.
Extremely interesting topic. I would like to see if a vegetarian or vegan lifestyles is healthier than a lifestyle that includes eating meat.
Is the milk produced by dairy cows taken into account when calculating the emissions per 100g of protein in CO2eq ?
I wonder if you could compare this finding with pricing, what would it technically cost to a vegan diet vs a meat diet, as for example, the beyond patties is over 9 dollars a pound and ground beef patties are 6 a pound.
But my ancestors did it so I should too.  Tradition is not a good reason to continue doing something. Many traditions have been phased out of society because people and the world change during the ages.
By eco freaks standards, terraforming Mars is a crime! Sorry, not buying it! Get the helll out of my meat!
Why is only climate change talked about, not about the impact meat has on health?
9:20 - 9:35 appreciate the video but this graph is very manipulative. I'm not entirely disagreeing but you shouldn't be comparing a century of co2 removal to a year emitted. If we were to continue at our current rate of emissions by your graph we would produce 5000 Tons of co2 in 100 years, which makes the 800 Tons removed from everyone having a Vegan diet insufficient. Looking at the graph without observing the context makes it look like a vegan diet alone can reverse climate change.
Eat the bugs.
Time to start harvesting cow farts
I appreciate this video, as someone who went from eating a decent amount of meat to now only eating it as a special meal or treat, I feel confident in my decision :) (edit: guys chill in the replies)
Put dislikes up. Also just an idea to float maybe talk about how capitalism and loan markets and all that can actually help innovation. Theres a lot of capitalism hate rn when individual policy reform is generally the best answer
8:44 What you're saying is not wrong. Only 19% of global soy production is consumed by humans. But you're leaving out an interesting detail. Only around 2% will become stuff like tofu and alternatives for animal products. The stuff which is always accused of being the cause of deforestation of the Amazon. The rest becomes oil. Oil, you can use to fry tofu or meat. Also, and I can only talk for Europe here, virtually all tofu, soymilk, and other soy stuff for vegans and vegetarians is made with soy that comes from Europe.
I became vegetarian in late 2020. My reasons are in part environmental, but primarily because of the pandemic- the factory farming of animals increase the risk of new pandemics, and I don’t want another one in my lifetime. Videos like this are so, so important to cut through the overzealous ideologies on both sides of the debate. It’s important for vegetarians and vegans to recognise that if everyone stopped eating meat, we would still fail to meet co2e targets. Meat-eating environmentalists have to accept that they are  doing the single most impactful thing that is in their control. For everyone else, I hope that we can continue to engage sensibly on this, and only come to the table to discuss it if you are sincerely open to listening to (high quality) information on the subject and be ready to consider how that information challenges our current views
You forgot about the biggest factor. Shipping. You literally have no idea what you are talking about while making up numbers. Shipping Vegetables is incredibly energy intensive. You need to transport about 10 times more food for vegetables to feed the same number of people. That also ignores that the only nutrient missing in meat is Vit C while there are multiple diseases due to lack of meat.  You also should probably mention that plants unless subsidized costs far more to feed someone than vegetables just on weight let alone nutrition. That tells you the actual impact not the Climate Nutcase Science based on huffing paint thinner logic.
Totally rational and wel sustained video. But i still will eat meat.

Carbon budget is another non-scientific thing being pushed to convince the ignorant public that the say should be subservient to their masters.
Hello! I will be your daily updater on Likes and Dislikes!  As of 10th December 2021 Likes 305k Dislikes 12k  Will be updated!
So, I imagine what is one of the biggest setbacks for vegan/vegetarian options other than taste (sorry, but nothing plant based is going to taste like the meat it’s trying to replace. They just don’t taste the same), is the cost of those products. Meat is very affordable depending on the cuts you buy. Vegan options on the other hand, are about twice the price for a much smaller portion. I myself, have been trying to convert to vegetarian options because I have a special diet, and those would benefit me more, and for a mere 10-15 vegetarian items that are substitutes for other foods I love that I can’t have, it was about $90. And for a person who doesn’t have all the money to spare (in fact, I’m rather on the poor side), almost $100 for that little amount of food is unaffordable. But compare that to meat, where if you get the cheaper cuts, you could buy $50 worth of meat and it’d last you for about 3-4 months
The problem is not the food, but the population. It's frckn basic elementary knowledge, the chain-food system. If one species get over-population it will impact to other species and the environment. do you want to stop climate change ? REDUCE THE FRCKN POPULATION. but a beta male american will said "I live in democracy country, I have free will to make how many children I want" yes and I have free will to put my fist in your face too. You can do that, but is it wise ? do you think your children will happy when their children will suffer cause of the global disaster like economic crisis, food crisis, climate change ?   No one should be blame on. It is basically an archetype from our human survival instinct to reproduce more babies. But why there is no problem for making babies in the past ? the reason is only 30%-40% of babies will survive until become adult. And then in 1700-1900 we humans create advanced medical technology such as vaccine antibiotic and any other medicine that make us to extend our life span. Congratulation humans, you guys just break the nature balance. Medical advance is ofcourse very "humanity" but humanity not align with nature. If you want increase your humanity, you will sacrifice the nature (environment) and vice versa. Who think nature is beautiful ? of course they are, visually, but the system is not. Nature love human war because it will decrease the human population and balancing the nature. lol dont take it serious its all just an opinion, as you can see I live in democracy country, its free speech, free to debate, free to disagree. If my english bad, I dont care tho its not my first language and i don't want sorry for it. fu
Can we talk about how the earth was just fine. Until urbanization, nuclear power and research, sending thing into space, fossil fuel emissions, creating and using plastics for everything, gmo's. And most of all commercialization and mass production. Let's not forget the plastics, and how there suffocating the ocean!!! Why are these not considered in the discussion of climate change. Why is it a diet. Doesn't it seem weird? Haven't we noticed during the lockdown, the earth and animals were thriving. When factories and production plants temporarily ceased operation. Oh but meat alone destroys the environment, ok.
Depends
Ah yes, more Bill Gates big paste propaganda. There’s plenty of land for reforestation that would require everyone living off of bug paste and eating in pods.
There are a lot of Jussie Smolletts in the vegan community ...
Choose to eat less beef, or don't eat beef

So the solution is to kill al cows got it
laboratory meat is an aswer
the taste.....u guys forgot about to talk about the taste.....
Neglecting the ethical aspect of the meat industry in this video is kind of... disappointing.
What about health though. A collrague of mine says meat is unhealthy If eaten multiple times a week. I would be interested to know If He is right
I eat beef so rarely, that cutting it out would make absolutely no difference. It's Americans that need to be educated more than anyone, since they consume the most beef by far.  EDIT: to give an idea of how rarely, I've never had steak

I heard a lot of these arguments on the What I've Learned channel in favor of meat. Thank you for making this video to respond to them. I didn't realize that transport and packaging is only about 11% of the total carbon footprint of meat. I guess I'm back to not being able to justify my meals to myself anymore...
Yeah this is brought to you by oil companies. Thinking meat is the problem is a joke. I’m a vegan but thinking veganism can help is just riding a high horse.
Proud to Be a Vegetarian 😀 (I'm not telling that I oppose Non-Veg eaters, it's perfectly fine 💜 after all, it's your choice What you wanna eat)
1:22 Cutting down trees down not release emissions in a sustainable world, because we would not decrease the total area of forest.

Meat isn't bad. The amount of resources wasted which in turn create gigantic amounts of Pollution when you don't actually NEED to eat meat. Humans invented Agriculture for a reason. People in the remote areas and Tundras NEED to eat meat. You don't.
You will probably be surprise to know about a thing called cultured meat
Damn, chicken ftw
Something to point out at @4:18 even though freight ships are overall low in emissions, you still need to factor in the CO2 that gets added once the food is removed from the ship and put into lorries to reach their destination.
"Meat gets bad press" lol the biggest LIE. Nothing gets the undeserved media's good press that meat gets, srsly
Solution: Eating Vegans xD

Tell us more about lab-grown meat! Does it have a small enough footprint?
Can someone explain to me in the part with the Avocado and local beef, the process of the footprint? Like yeah A ship produces on its way less carbon than a transport car But bthe Avocados don't magically teleport into the super market from the port don't they? They still have to be transported  Or did I miss something? .-.
Well In India beef is totally prohibited and cows are protected as they are like our 2nd mother. And India has so much vegetarian than the whole world combined vegetarian population. I love my country and I am happy that I am not murdering those poor animals for our taste when we have lot of vegetarian foods.
I'm baffled by the efficiency of naval transport, good job, engineers, thank you !
you're repeating issues now
Excellent video, as is always the case with Kurzgesagt: well researched, presented in an amicable fashion and not imposing anything on you, just the burden of responsibility of having to decide for yourself what to do with this information.
so we should go for Factory Farming for beef to atleast narrow down the carbon footprint. or go over to Poultry/Pork diets?
haha vegans gonna be butthurted 🤣
Lower grade plant goods and waste humans cannot eat go to animals. Animals make natural effective fertilizer for the plants. Removing meat production makes things more difficult for vegans.
you'll have to kill me and take the meat from my cold dead hands  P.S this one was a little woke you should do a video on hunting for meat.
7:35 why can't grass land be converted into crop land??  Btw the video should have included fish because it's also very bad for the environment
NO
;
People questioning these things is a sign of advancement. ♪(┌・。・)┌
This analysis is heavily Western biased. Most of the world do not consume significant amounts of beef. And am not talking only Asia or Africa, but even most of Europe.
I know it's not exactly the topic of the video and it's shortly touched upon, but the horrific suffering of farmed animals should be enough to ditch meat.
5:35  cursed
I just don't like how we call it meat, when really it's flesh from terrified and suffering sentient beings.
Won’t matter if fish isn’t affected
I am a vegetarian now
i'm a huge meat lover but dont eat beef. not because of the environment, i just dont like it. also i dont trust some cheapskate farmers saving a buck by feeding ground up dead cow carcasses to their healthy cows, causing mad cow disease/prion disease
Support with love!
Sometimes I wonder if a singe worldwide autocracy might be the only way to escape problems like this, just because it’s so impossible to get everyone to eat less or no meat without going all out and banning it or something, and that would never happen in a democracy due to lobbying and people who are sympathetic to those doing the lobbying.
Why dont we begin to eat humans 1 overpopulation decreased  2 no need for cute cows to be killed 3 we already have a lot of humas so there wil be no factory’s  :) dont eat humas or begin to do it. Plz
i dont care what people eat. i'm just here for a good time not a long time. if you live your life not enjoying any of it then what's the point?
the last graph is really really misleading, you show 800bn tons of CO2 removed in 100 years vs 50bn produced in a SINGLE year, that means that in a 100 years its 5000bn tons produced, so without even taking into account how CO2 emissions would change its 6 times the amount removed. Assuming CO2 emissions would drop by 25% (the biggest possible drop for food) it would still be 3750bn tons vs 800bn tons
i hate eating. its an annoying waste of time that is rarely enjoyable. sleep is the best thing about being alive. if i could sleep 24 hours a day, i would probably sleep for weeks, if not months at a time
YES IT IS
You know what !! I’m using these lines in my essay and answers for CSE. Thank you for such great free content.  Appreciated !
The thing is, growing crops also creates a lot of inedible waste, which is the fed to animals. I would have liked to see the data for how much crop animals and humans consume respectivily further specified, in so far, on how much of it would be edible
Meat is love lol
If your meat is bad than you just don't know how to cook it.
Really the issue is population need to reduce out numbers
If I understood this video correctly, the world would be better off if people become vegetarian. Unfortunately meat tastes good to a lot of people so they make up excuses to continue eating it. I'm glad I'm a vegetarian - no longer I have to feel ashamed about the animal suffering and the damage it causes to the planet.
Hhhh
I love veggies and tofu!
we don't eat cows. for indian cows are mother in animal form .
This channel made me a doomer
Im glad that i went vegan, I personally feel a lot better knowing I’m not harming any animals and possibly helping the environment
THAT VEGAN TEACHER
i love to eat federal eagle sooo yummy  😍😍😍😍
Great information but kinda complicated to follow .  Well I'll just follow the traditional way ,of following my religion where meat was restricted to the Brahmins , and other castes were allowed to eat it.  Killing cows was a sin.  Cow dung was used a organic fertilizer which enhanced the crop production , trees were worshiped and planted    Sounds more simple and easy .
Thank you, this was so informative and much needed! Keep up the good work
meat is the most nutritious thing on the planet. thats why a snake can eat once a month and a cow has to eat every 5 seconds.  its not rocket science.
I don't eat meat not because I care about animals, but because of me. I worked at a cancer research institute as an engineer, the head of research told me how to reduce the risks of cancer to minimum:  workout 30 minutes every day don't smoke don't eat processed meat It turns out the stuff they use to conserve meat products is very, very carcinogenic.
Be a vegan !!.... Save animals from being slaughtered .......eat a healthy diet .....
I being a hindu never ate beef.
This is told in hindu dharma the most scientific and peaceful dharma
Not innately, but the way and amount some countries do it seems pretty bad for the world.
Great way of saying we're fú*ked
No matter how you feel about this topic… the video was fantastic as always. I am sure we could all learn a little by watching these videos and maybe have a hand in change, even if its a microscopic one. Great videos and great content!
Beef is banned in india 🇮🇳🇮🇳❤
0:03 WTF CHICKEN EATS ITS OWN KIND
They Changed the thumbnail....    Just thought I'd tell you...
Interesting, but not even a throwaway line about permaculture, regenerative ag., or even basic silvopasture practices? Also, there are, in fact, breeds of pig and chicken that can get most, if not all (depending on their environment), of their diet from forage (that is to say "grassfed").
Anyone else find the thumbnail for this absolutely terrifying?  That cow is the stuff of nightmares
I'm Muslim and I love halal meat
"You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information." Yes, unfortunately, we can. And it's this fact that dooms us. Neither the unappreciable cruelty of animal farming nor the environmental devastation it causes will be enough for the Doomer generation (or especially older generations) to take on an entirely plant-based diet, much less give up on other forms of animal exploitation, particularly for those who profit from these cruel and irresponsible practices and consider it their 'right' as a result of 'tradition.'   When future generations ask why we knew what was happening and did nothing about it, we'll shrug our shoulders and say "we didn't have to," as we fall into our graves beside ones we dug for them.

There are too many people on the planet, end of story. Even though the carrying capacity of the planet is higher than our current total population, we are so inefficient and indulgent that it's our way of life is not sustainable.

Interesting to observe other countries that already destroy their own biomes and polluted tons to industrialize themselves shunning Brazil so hard while not paying nor sharing their technology to allow Brazil to develop without any need to destroy their own forests. 🤔
5:38 😂😂😂
So even if we all did away with all meat we'd only account for 16% of our carbon emissions in the absolute best case scenario? Sorry that doesn't account for the land we'd need to grow more crops to fill the rest of the diets of everyone giving up meat. We also can't forget we're basically consigning almost every species of farm animal to extinction because just releasing them onto undeveloped land both doesn't solve anything and causes big enviornmental problems.   A real solution might be, nuke every other civilization on the planet into the stone age and repress the human population as our ancestors weren't wise enough to do. That's a lot more land freed up and no species would have to go extinct, yay! What did you say? Nuclear winter? Aw shucks, if there's few enough people food production will be fine. I guess we could also all come together, regulate reproduction and instill far more widespread death sentences to reduce the burden we put on the world. Oh you know what? We should make serial killers exempt from the law, what a way to contribute to society.  Our carbon footprint cannot realistically be reduced by much without drastic measures. Solar and wind are both unreliable and huge environmental problems. Nuclear is going to runout within the century, fission hasn't been figured out yet, we are an advanced level of civilization that, like all advanced civilization must be, is extremely reliant on heavy industry based manufacturing and production.
In short, meat is good for you
If you're dying of hunger, you will eat anything edible, including meat. Vegans are spoiled group of people who don't understand people die of hunger in third world countries. North Koreans would LOVE meat.
Another great video, but one that isnt attainable for humans to switch to, unfortunately. I know ppl will disagree with that, but it would take such a leap to even get 50% of the global population on a vegetarian diet.
"Even if we eliminated  all other sources the emissions from food alone would still use up our entire carbon budget by 2100" This is a very spooky and shitty argument because it assumes that the technology behind food production wont become more efficient as time goes on; You want to frame the 2100 deadline a a failure but its not, its an EXCELLENT deadline that we could easily meet without having to take desperate actions. You know what deadline we cannot meet, even taking into account efficiency increase without urgent change? The one caused by fossil energy production; Anything else is a distraction from the real issue.
So.....overpopulation is the problem then. We simply have too many humans. Reduce the population and reduce the necessary amount of production to sustain it. Through breeding inhibition, we can reduce human population humanely and save the planet, and in turn, us.
Personally, I don't like meat and I dont eat it- I don't care if anyone else eats it tho lmao      why tf did my simple comment start a horrible argument? smh
Another excellent video guys, thank you. I would love to see more videos on agriculture in general in the future! Stay well out there everybody, and God bless you friends! :)
9:32 I like your content, but please don't do this. One is the CO2 removed over 100 years while the other is the CO2 emitted over only 1 year, but you present those two numbers almost like a single bar chart, potentially leading your viewers to some confusion about how much one really is compared to the other.
For anyone wondering there are 11k dislikes at November 10th
One thing about this debate (including in this video to a certain extent, unfortunately) is the debate is always centered around beef. Beef is not the only meat, and as explained at the beginning of the video, pork and poultry have a much smaller impact on global warming. And yet, the debate is always about beef vs vegan.
I would love to watch a video regarding ethics and so on about this topic.
Man so should I just become vegetarian 😩
Cows eat grass — the most abundant food source on this planet. Yet we force feed them highly unhealthy and inflammatory foods like grains. Why? Because we have a habit of taking easy things and overly complicating it.   Not only is grass fed beef healthier, and far more sustainable — it’s also good for regenerative agriculture.
"No other body pleasure is enjoyed multiple times everyday" are you sure 😉
meat tasty
6:54 Eeek!!
"You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information." This is why I respect this channel. In the end the biggest difference can be made through education. People need to buy in to a choice to turn things around. And no matter how much you may disagree with dissenting voices or how much the research contradicts them, they are a necessity. Some ideas that were radical and shunned in the past have proved to be important. For as much ignorance, conspiracy theories and blatant political propaganda there is out there, having a world in which that can exist is more important than one where we weed it all out under the pretense of knowing the absolute truth. This channel informs and then invites you to research and form your own opinion, it doesn't tell you what you ought to believe. To truly believe something, you have to arrive at it yourself to some extent. Good work.
Ah yes, more content and fuel for that vegan teacher even this vid is good, still more fuel for that vegan teacher to exist
*this is a joke, can't believe I have to say this: if meat = bad just kill all the animals that give us meat,, then we eat them
Go green. Go vegan.
this might be a dumb question, but why can’t we find ways to convert methane and other greenhouse gases into energy? i’m sure SOMEONE out there must be researching it…
I am here when they say veggie patties are better when I have never eaten a burger with a meat patty (not vegetarian though)
Very superficial video, with the usual legend about cows farting which destroy the planet. Besides that we need meat, I can't survive without it, my iron would go zero in a few months and I would die, so you can go to hell with your veggie burger, I'm eating real food!
i like the meme call beef stonks :>
I hate when people are only looking at climate when arguing, does no one stop to think about human health?
I could see myself potentially replacing bone-out meat with lab grown stuff if it's the same/lower price, tastes the same, and is better for the environment, but I don't think I'll ever want to replace the bone-in variety because I don't see how they could possibly grow that
That vegan teacher is typing…..
The argument of Methane release by cows or plants is a bit maddening.  The Carbon that life emits is Neutral. I understand that Methane is worse than regular carbon, but perhaps we should focus on trying switch to renewables, before telling people they have to reduce their meat consumption.    We have enough problems as it is just trying to get that done.
Beef Stonks 🥩
2  ideas: the treatment of the human workers on farms, because I hear the "animals shouldn't be treated badly" argument from vegetarians A LOT, and if we were to stop consuming animal products that doesn't mean there is no very significant suffering going into the food industry. second, the water consumption of various products, and where that water is coming from. (hey y'all, go listen to the Dollop podcast episode on the "water monsters" if you want to be Real Mad.)
we are just too over populated
I think one of the worst problems is that if we did stop eating meat then what do we do with the millions of cows,sheep,pigs,chickens etc
Very informative thx I’m actually  starting to eat lees meet but never potion at other with the finger cuz  carbon footprint is  something you can’t really avoid when you want to have a comfortable life  a very promising way to deal with the meat issue is to  trade it like cigarettes or alcohol  a strict  Markt policy could change the buyer behavior
No mention of fish, unless I missed it. I mostly eat chicken and fish, hoping that that lowers my footprint a bit. That fish is usually cheap salmon and occasionally tuna. I know there are some concerns on how things are caught and/or farmed, so a video on that might be good.
I still wanna eat burgers cause it taste better
There's nothing like a nice juicy steak
Impressively packaged propaganda. Truth is although that the best beef is carbon negative and lower carbon footprint than most vegan imports. I also see you used multiple debunked sources that are colloquially considered vegan propaganda. Sad. Too important topic to let ideology destroy your credibility like in this case.
quick everyone don't have kids and kill some people. it'll save the world
I'm going to keep eating meat lmao thanks
The 2 billion hectares freed when we stop eating beef sounds great. I think we should start reducing the consumption of meet, especially beef. Now, I understand where vegans come from.
What exactly is he referring to by carbon budget
We tried one of those 0% burgers at BK with my sister and it was really good. We won't mind substituting meat with that
Of course this was too good to be true. Why is it that anytime I come across a good YouTube channel they always got a ruin it with their Agree With Us or Die opinions.
Still I will eat meat.
Good ol' comparing calories/protein to gas emission. Sure, try for yourself to meet the optimal daily requirement for protein intake with potatoes or broccoli :D  Beef isn't necessity, but that kind of comparison is made with obvious agenda behind it.
I haven't watched the video but to answer that question the answer is no.
the antibiotic use is crazy
One thing I've been wondering about: When calculating emissions, does it take into account that the food the livestock eats comes from plants that converted CO2 into plant matter? a cow can never release more CO2 than what first got pulled from the atmosphere right? preservation of mass and all?
I may sound nuts but the first time i saw this video recommended to me it said Meat Love and had a cow with heart eyes. Am i going crazy @kurzgesagt
I can’t get behind the numbers on food grown for humans vs animals because those animals aren’t eating corn or soy beans, they’re eating the plant stocks that we can’t digest. So yes, animals eat 70% of the plants but only because 70% of the plant isn’t edible.
What happened to the nice cow in the thumbnail before? Sad emoji sad emoji
I appreciate your entirely neutral stance.  Even for a guy who cares little to none about what is called climate change, I received a bunch of very useful information that was digestible.  What surprised me the most was the efficiency of the boats; I guess working with buoyancy makes everything easier.
No man, is not but the meat in combination with MONOSODIUM it is!!!
Raw meat is bad
go veggie if u have brain
Veggie people are right !
Kinda scary because if the meat is improperly prepared it will fucking kill you.
There's billions of years of evolution wherein animals eat plants and each other that tells us the answer is "No". There's a few hundred yrs of Humanity's Industrial Age that tells us the answer is "Yes". The problem is us: destroying ecosystems mega-farming the tastiest animals deep frying said animals and voraciously gobbling up everything in sight w/o a thought nor care for the consequences
As of dec 9th 2021 at 3:43 pm the dislike count is 11k  Ask for updated count my replying
It's very sad to say, but there is no logic to eating meat any more. The best meat for the environment is the most evil. The most ethical meat is the worst for the environment.   Are we going to stop, or are we going to kill ourselves first?   Sadly I'm not sure I have hope in the logical answer being chosen.
What about fishing? It pollutes the ocean with lost fishing rig and depletes fish populations not to mention plastic waste and accidental catch. I saw that documentary on netflix. And fish farms are absolutely disgusting.
China, India and Brazil need to clean up their act before I even consider giving up or reducing beef intake. Liberal war on beef is already in full swing with inflation and and COVID restrictions making the price of beef sky rocket. Luckily some of my colleagues have second jobs as ranch owners and have cattle and we just bought and processed our first cow to the tune of about $4.00/lb and apparently my colleague can get down to $3.00/lb with the next one. She brought the meat to our office from the processor who had vacuum sealed the chilled meat according to their cuts and we brought our own coolers to put them in our freezer. Even had to buy a 10.1 cubic foot chest freezer for my backroom to store it.
Only with the alternative system to monetary economy, which is named Resource Based Economy RBE, humanity can become vegan!
Vegie people eat more heavy metals per a life span as Meat has much lower radioactivity and toxic metals. And by the way you need animals to make manure to grow crops. See if you go straight organic the land becomes useless as they cannot use animals so over time the land will not grow anything without the animals. Circle of life idiots! How come this was ignored?
Yes. End of story.
Let me just say, I grew up in a butcher's family. I live mostly vegan today. When you see the severity we're currently facing, it's a relatively small sacrifice to make. You'll start learning great new veggie recipes that make you forget why you ever ate meat in the first place, and after a year or two you might not even want to touch it anymore. I know I could never kill a being with a beating heart, so why would I eat it then. The meat industry has to come to terms with the fact that we're facing a different era now.

If you replace monocrop agriculture used to feed cows and turn them into grassland their would be more space for grass fed beef. Also the quality of the soil changes with ruminants on grasslands, trapping the CO2 in the atmosphere.  Watch Kiss the Ground on Netflix.
Cows are vegans (after weaning). So I must say, not all vegans are bad!
I don't eat beef anyway. I don't like it. So that helps I guess lol.
But steak
That is why Hindus treat cow as a mother and don't eat it from thousands years ago.
No, it's not. it's the left wing idiots complaining about a fake climate crisis that are bad.
Meat taste good :)
Thank you for citing your sources!
No one hates meat they love cows 💡
export cows to mars so they heat up the planet....LOL
we just need a machine that converts co2 into graphene and oxygen. It could be nuclear powered
i think its worth also to talk about the fact the cattle population is on the decline..... and is it true that grasslands emit c02 naturally when there is droughts where when cattle eats the grass yes it emits methane but it locks c02 and nutrients into the soil and promotes growth? < not sure if true or another myth
I appreciate the honesty in this video. Was expecting the stance to be their typical meat defense but they actually acknowledge it’s downfalls, even if it’s only environmentally examined. Nice job
I'm an omnivore who likes eating meat. I just see it as a food along with veggies. I doubt it could actually happen but if meat industry was suddenly gone and we could only eat veggies and non-meat food, I wouldn't really care. I guess I don't care when it comes to ethics of just simply killing an animal without torturing it, but when it comes to the environment then yeah, I think the meat industry is having a bad impact
There is one catch by cows and other animals on pastures: If youturn pasture in to grasland you have to harvest the gras, or replace the animals with wild animals, otherwise the ecosystem will not work. Accordig some sources are our animals only by some 20% more than will be wild life animals if human will not interven. So count methane atc i maybe a bit unfair... But valid only for animals on pastures, not ovecrowhelmed and not in places where was forest, rainforest....
i honestly expected thatveganteacher to be one of the first comments on this video, but i guess not...
I love meat!  Я люблю мясо! Ya luiblu myaso! Delicious, amazing, beautiful thing!
Meat itself is not bad but all the man made chemicals the eat and are injected with are.
It’s not just about climate though. It’s unethical as well.
I don't hate meat! Most of my friends are made of meat!
Kurzgesagt also forgot to mention that dairy cow = mother cow, and they only produce milk in response to giving birth to a new calf.   To sustain dairy production continuously, female cows have to be artificially inseminated regularly, or die in the process.
In reality, overpopulation is the problem. Humans are over breeding in some places, we need a thanos or we will naturally destroy ourselves in a rapid unavoidable speed. It'd why Corona was a 1% released bio weapon to help the climate crisis.
Climate change is a myth.
Watching this made me desire more meat. I rarely eat beef anyways.
Cow farts, man.
Does the fact that you can barely buy any beef in post-soviet country helps?
Humans can have a little bit of meat as a treat
co2 by the animals is so misleading  like whad does that do to the food its just a faild try from vegetarians to make beef sound bad to the environment
As an indian and being a vegetarian I feel very proud that India has the largest number of vegetarians living on this planet.... 🙏
Right now, there's 11k dislikes and 301K Likes (Might get edited comment soon)
Cow pat has methane which is bad for the environment so
As someone who has not eaten beef at all due to religion, I think we will mostly be fine if we found find some sort of good alternative.
My vegan sense is tingling
Did anyone notice that they changed the thumbnail from "meat love" with a cow with heart eyes to "meat hate" with the sad cow
"1kg of Avocadoes" **Millenials has joined the chat**
I will never stop eating beef. It is 90% of my diet and will be until I die from clogged arteries.
I would like to see you eat potatoes for protein. I like your videos but this one is very biased.
That's kind sad. It's only logical to us drop meat produts. But why it taste so good??!!
Everytime I watch one or ur vids about meat I always think. Don't be have very similar amount of cow like animals today that we had 10 000 years ago. I just don't get it also. Same thing with plants I just don't understand ur point
If we all became vegan, animals could cause a lot of bad to earth, remember to eat animal kingdom!!
One fact that I think is very important here is that we spend more land and resources on feeding animals, and then eating them than it would take to just feed ourselves. Meat is a huge luxury item in that regard. I dont know how easy it is to convert farming to other farm products, but if we could spend less land on growing corn and more land on other vegetables going vegetarian would be a breeze.
I have stopped  eating beef a long time ago. Its great and realy healthy withot beef!
So could we eat non beef?
The easiest way to reduce emissions is to have less people and therefore less demand for food,   so be efficient,be wise  eat more vegetarians/vegans after all they eat Our food's food
It's very similar to the logic of Bill Gates has mentioned. 😨😰😥 He introduced new beef that produced by artificial colors and cell manipulation for whole world people.
9:34 There is so many manipulations through this whole material... but this one is hitting me the most  you litearly show long CO2 removed OVER 100 YEARS! and compared it with 1year The visual messege is rly important... more then a words honestly becouse you can remember it more easily   so in reality it is like 8Bilions      |||||||| vs 50Bilions   ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||  im disappointed a little
No vegetarian people are bad
things shipped in fright ships still need to be transported locally so thats a bit skewed
Let’s assume we remove all other CO2 admissions other than food. We then produced 14 billion tons of CO2 from food every year. If 3 billion hectares can remove 800 billion tons of CO2, so 1 billion hectares can remove about 26 billion tons of CO2. Then we only need a little more than half of them to offset the food production carbon. We dont need to completely switch off from meat diet.
i know it‘s bad for the planet but i just love meat to much to give it up
why did you change the thumbnail?
TL;DR: Yes
Good news, God knows more about the climate than all the scientists combined. And he clearly promised that it would never change.  Genesis 8:22
This is demonic propaganda which is extremely dangerous for the health of humanity.  Depriving humans of the micronutrients found only in animal flesh will cause serious health concerns for every human being and especially for pregnant mothers and unborn babies. Of particular concern is the omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids... without these acids there will be a pandemic of serious birth defects.
6:10 "the worst is the destruction of forests for farming" Me as a brazilian hearing that: 😰😢
I've heard an argument that a lot of the feed that goes to livestock is the inedible parts of plants like soy thus actually just using the extra material and not just wasting it. The data shown here doesn't refute this, as far as I can tell. Can anyone confirm or deny this?
What wasn't mentioned was getting rid of only the bacteria that produce methane, meaning this is just a vegan Communist lie. Unfollowed.
Just eat insects, fish, poultry and seafood lol its much healthier for both you and the environment
antes era una vaca sonriente
Something that I find coming short on a lot of the videos about the impacts and driving factors of climate change, carbon emissions or the likes, is that even though the average person can certainly do their part in reducing our emissions, the private people themselves have a much lower overall output than large corporations have. Sure, right now they are driven by financial efficiency. But I do find it important to atleast mention that, even if the people reduce their carbon emissions massively, if the corporate landscape does not change, no miracle can or will happen.
The thumbnail for this video had been changing. Is kurzgesagt trying to figure out the thumbnail that nets them the most views?
Doesn’t the vegi production need to increase if we were to exclude meat in our diet and wouldn’t we need to eat way more to obtain the right amount of nutrients? What would the carbon emissions be for food then compared to a meat based diet?
I fear this comment is going to be lost in the 34k addition comments but….   Most beef is feed grains that didn’t make the grade for human consumption.   Such as malt barley that didn’t make the grade.   And the video didn’t mention the manure that gets put back on the land upgrading the tilth of the soil

There is a way, but it involves dismantling the capital giant that the agricultural industry has become. We would have to redesign our urban environment, our yards, and communities to accommodate self grown crops, and the raising of animals.  If you grow and eat most of your own food you are being extremely sustainable, more so than driving an electric vehicle(there is an article published on this somewhere). The biggest milestone we have is how this will effect the economy, since food production we have become reliant on grocery stores, petroleum to get to them, and taxation for the production of it all.  Go do some research on how the price increases from wholesale (farmer) to shipping, storage, shipping and market. It is market up (obviously) to make it all profitable.   We need to be independent for our nutritional needs. Reintroduce permaculture and promote self sufficiency at the expense of comfort. Comfort is killing us.
i'll never give up meat and dairy, its my favorite thing to eat.
I think the only thing not discussed here was that nutrition isn't calories or just protein, its the nutriends, vitamins and minerals. So for grass fed beef you get a much healthier food as well. A lot of these plant based meat alternatives use ingredients that are known to cause inflammation or hormonal issues. Also, those better treated animals also produce less methane than the factory formed animals.   If you treat animals better you get less methane and more nutritious food which is the opposite narrative than this video which focuses on the use of land. In the end this should have been more neutral between the systems. There is also research in adding things like seaweed to factory farming to reduce methane as well. And of course there is cultured meat.   What I'm most concerned with here is that a lot of the meat alternatives aren't all that healthy and its harder to get the nutrients needed for a healthy life from just plants. We need protein and fat to live, we don't need carbs and plants are heavy to one side of the equation.

I can see the cows I eat from my window.
Another interesting video 👏
so is meat really that bad
We in India want to ban beef..
Animals are given the leftovers from food crops. We can't eat the whole plants. No, most crops aren't grown with the express purpose of feeding cattle.
Very understandable thanks 😊
Only if you're a vegan.  Just a heads up, no matter what you eat, something has to die.  Nothing wants to die, and everything reacts to being killed whether you can hear it scream or not.
Going to go buy a bunch of steaks now
Sorry, but I can’t give up burgers and ham. To good. Plus I don’t trust most of this plant based stuff (chemicals to make it taste like meat, soy and tofu lowering testosterone, etc.).
0:46  I saw what you did there!
The role of regenerative agriculture should be considered. Also, the environmental impact of a freight ship doesn't take into account that in order for that freight ship to be useful, you need deforestation to happen. Industrial food logistics are also a massive driver for social inequality worldwide. And the carbon footprint of vegetable product do not take into account the fact that most of them are extensive monocultures, which are basically drivers of desertification.
now, many indians will come to answer
I want to see the footprint of fishing and if that could be a leading effort in changing the way we eat
Cant we all agree tht fact that while watching this video we craved for steaks
How does everyone feel about raising deer instead of cows for red meat?
Use me as a dislike button
4:29 yes but you first need to bring the meat to the ship, that’s the same as bring the food from the farm to the supermarket with local food production. + after the ship arrives you still need to bring the meat to the supermarket on land, same as local meat.
6:47 I don’t think so, factory cows must be nurished with food, where does this food come from? How much CO2 does this food supply emit, how many people would be nurished with this food (or with the land this food production uses) , non factory cows just eat grass, way cheaper and way less CO2 producing in my opinion but I could be wrong
To be honest the only thing keeping me from Stuff like Vegan burgers or Vegan ground beef to at least get some of my Meat consumption down is that literally every Product I've tried so far sucks as a substitute. Most have been eadible, some even tasty but marketed as Meat substitute they have all been below average.
I would really like to get to see  if humans were livestock for an advanced species.
Nice topic
Would love a video about how CO2 equivalence values are calculated, cuz I'm totally in the dark on that.
That vegan teacher would be so happy right now
Can't know how I stopmed onto this. Anyway Awesome content 🥇. I also have been watching those rather similar from mStarTutorials and kinda wonder how you guys create these clips. MSTAR TUTORIALS also had cool info about similiar make money online things on his vids.
6:55 goes so hard
Too many people, way too many !
Bad for whom?  It's horribly bad for the animals who are slaughtered, unless you don't consider dying bad.  Not quite so bad for humans, as they aren't slaughtered, and usually take decades of meat consumption to develop diabetes, heart disease and cancer.  Otherwise, it's fine.
i couldn’t care less im not gonna live forever so ima try live my life to the fullest no matter what people say
Kinda feel like we should just get over the taboo of eating people... if we want calorie dense meat THAT BAD
I try to follow the plate system as I was taught. 1/3 pasta 1/3 vegetables 1/3 meat. I try to eat meat a bit more sparingly and opt out of it if I like a non meat alternative as much. Basically switching from KFC to thai food with the occasional tofu
I used to have quite a bit of respect for your channel thinking you provided the most accurate data possible, but since you admitted to selectively presenting data that trust is gone.
I still eat quite a bit of chicken/seafood and I stopped eating red meat for mainly health reasons but it's great to know my decisions have an impact on climate change as well. The fact that you showed factory farming is better climate-wise was quite intriguing because I never really considered that. Overall I think it was a great video that summarizes the topic well from a neutral perspective, however, I feel that from an ethical perspective people should know how animals are treated and how they are slaughtered. It doesn't really affect me knowing, but, I feel like many people would change their diets for the better if they knew.
We need it in french ;)
EXCUSE ME! @Kurzgesagt, CHICKENS are Omnivorous, and will eat anything they can catch. They don't ONLY eat Grains.
I have heard so many different things about this topic that i really just didn't know if my dietary changes have an impact, but if just removing beef and lamb from my diet has an effect i will gladly give those up and maybe even start to eat more plant based options. Thank you so much for this video!
the solution is less people! my argument is that at least 50% of land should be uninhabited by humans. but since our economy is based on growth, its just a matter of time until we completely change the planet
Vegetarier - In a Nutshell
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old." Speak for yourself bruh.
When it comes to food I literally don't care. This is the line that I'll never cross. I'll fight anyone over this till we burn down the world for all I care. Graze fucking grass for all I care you will not change or slow down anything. They will always come up with some new reason to restrict you and make your life more miserable.
What about alternatives like lab grown beef?
I mean, we gotta stop the co2 emissions somehow and we gotta start from somewhere and in that journey we gotta also encounter this problem, I hope the veg beef patties solve this problem or people discover new ways to convert the less emitting food into variety of other foods
I loved the Video. taking such a divisive issue and breaking it down to digestible and non propogandist portions. I love every aspect of your videos, and funnily enough this one was next on the autoplay right after The "we are lying to you" one which talks about science understanding being a key factor in making the right decisions based on facts. self serving Agendas aside, one of the greatest issues in properly discussing matters of importance is lack of awareness of the limitations of ones own knowledge and understanding. Meat is the same. Diet is one of the things that is very often overshadowed by arguments of freedom and Morality, and while they do have their place it is refreshing to see a simple breakdown of the impacts of meat, or at least specifically Beef.
Everyone going to the comments to find ThatVeganTeacher
Climate change is not getting fixed man.
why is the ampunt of co2 removed in 100 yrs and emitted per year in 1 yr. if both were in 1 year it would say removed 8 and produced 50. so a net of 42 produced per year. if the land stays unused.
4:40 uh, excuse me, I don't live next to the sea???? Those boxes have to get on trucks one way or the other, how could a mistake this large escape notice? If it was simply poorly presented, it was EXTREMELY poorly presented. Glaring oversights like this is why it's so easy to have confirmation bias, it springs to mind thoughts like, what else are you smudging to make your environmentalist argument that I should be vegan? I'm so used to political ideologues trying to manipulate me that, especially with a topic like this, you have to be even more careful than usual. We are all biased, even subconsciously, and global warming (oh wait we stopped calling it that, I wonder why?) is sush an emotional topic that I trust nobody to be unbiased about it.
The only people getting butthurt about eating less meat are primitive low iq who are scared they will be forced to eat less and thus chose to fool themselves and ignore facts. Lets just be honest, I like meat too but I will eat less because its bad for the earth and myself.
But the plants wich are shipped across the globe will also have to use the same method of transport as the regional Beef. so in total their emissions on transport are still greater right ?
no its not
Ive decided to double my meat consumption for 2022 just so that 1 vegan that thinks hes making a difference.....
10 seconds in and I already disagree. I'm sorry... food "never gets old"???  WHERE IS MY NOT-FEEL-HUNGRY PILL, SOCIETY?! It's the future isn't it? I want my dinner pill!! I am so sick of food; choosing it, preparing it, eating it, I'd enjoy it much more if it was a rarer occurance.
currently 288k likes and 11,7k dislikes, for anyone without the ability to see dislikes ;-)  - man i love eating meat and was secretly hoping that the video would draw a differenct conclusion, but it is nice to be an informed asshole now:D
I have no problems with Vegans but whatever they do, can they not take away meat from the plate  can we not just eat what we want? Whatever happens I just don't want it to be forced upon people to eat a certain way or certain things.  If you want to eat vegan eat vegan if you want to eat muscles eat muscles if you want to eat meat eat meat Don't ever make the food palette only work for one group in society.
Not commenting on the debate; statistics is an amazing tool we can use to distinguish (what our brains are great at) difficult quantifiables, but can easily be misleading. You compared the long-distance transport of a "good" food with the short-distance transportation of a "bad" food. Why not use avocados for both parts of the explanation? Or beef?  I lied, statistics isn't a tool; it's a double-edged sword.
enslaved in awful poop forced to enjoying eating poop can't stand having to eat and shit, eating disorders are common
The climate change argument is extremely doubtful when looked at with real scientific processes instead of political hype as climate change has been around since the world was created. 100,000 years ago the world was totally covered in ice, and that's before humans were around. Another point to consider is the problem the climate change alarmists scream the loudest about is CO2 emissions, which are required for plant growth and all plant life will die if there is no CO2.
FOOD STONKS
Factz
Why is this whole thing focused on beef, the worst offender? Chicken is pretty damn sustainable per kilo depending. Cut out beef and replace with  more plant foods and chicken?
What's heavier? A kilogram of meat or a kilogram of potatoes?
Uh oh you have summoned That Vegan Teacher fans
Meat is good
Just half the human population
Meat hate? More like vegan/vegetarian hate.
Less meat. More trees.
What is the food with the lowest carbon emission?
Eating more meat and less veggies means we will spare more plants.  More plants mean less greenhouse gas. So it's better for Earth's environment. Meat is ❤
LOL i think someday someone will start movement to stop human from exhaling CO2 because it cause climate change hunh
You forgot to add the transport from plant basee foods to the ships and from the ships....
I have an hypothesis, what if humans where strictly carnivorous? Things would've definitely be worst, but I'm sure they would've find a way
06:54 that cow is badass
StEaK iS DeLIcIOUS
The fact is most people just dont give a shit. They are too ignorant and they simply don't like the social rhetoric that comes with a vegetarian or vegan diet. The only way people would eat less meat would be if the price sky rocketed.
If you stop feeding cows grains they stop producing methane and then beef is about as bad a potato's
what about the impacts of plowing fields? From what I heard, plowing releases an extremely high amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and soils are being lost every year. No-till farming was said to not release too much CO2 but it is not a very common farming practice. And is there not something to say about carbon sequestration through manure adding to soil organic matter and building up preserve soil CO2. I'm just curious if these factors were integrated in the calculations.
Watching this while eating a burger.
Propaganda. Guys, watch the videos about meat from "what i've learned" to know to truth.
i literally got this video right after i watched happy meat farms genome modification test 047
The vegan teacher: y e s .
Removing the dislike button = It's just another way YouTube is silencing users. YouTube is woke now,  the don't want to hurt anybodys feelings
I'll continue to eat beef. Thanks
how to fix earth: eliminate humans
??? The thumbnail was "Meat Love"
Sick of hearing about emissions too. The world greatest polluter, China, has done absolutely nothing to lower it's emissions. So stop telling me I need to eat plant based mystery meat. 😎
2:52 Not much?! 🧐
whenever people usually say that we shouldnt be eating meat and all that, not saying he is, he isnt outright saying its terrible, but my response is usually about how some of our teeth are pointed to allow easier consumption of meat, also, he is right when it comes to CO2 emissions when it comes to meat vs plant, and i would like to see a video on maybe how in some possible way we could maybe significantly reduce it or reduce it in some way while retaining most of the industry
im proudly part of the problem, not the solution
Idc about the silly climate arguments when it comes to meat. Animals have been eating each other on this planet for centuries and also the climate has jumped all the over place way before humans. If I want a bacon cheeseburger I'm going to eat a bacon cheeseburger. If certain people want to eat grass I'm not saying they shouldn't. That is the problem these days. Everyone is too worried about what others are doing. Worry about yourself. 👍 Btw I'm eating some fantastic steak tacos as I type this 😋😋😋
Might as well change to bugs but life could not exist without carbon
I started cutting out red meats in my diet the day after this video came out after learning about it's impact! Hopefully others would join me too!!
Vegan Hindhus be like  Yeah we are the most scientific improved civilization on planet 😁😂😂
Like it's all not worth it for beef, there are many other foods we could swap it with tbh
Two words, golden carrots
Right now it's pointless to vilify omnivores and let cows, sheep and goats free, why? Because like the video said a lot of the methane and CO² are from farts and burps, but without any of them dying as a food source for humans and their pets, their growth will go unchecked and they'll release even more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.  We know it's industry, residential and commercial energy use and automobiles that make up a vast majority of the greenhouse gases, what's worse is these could have all been changed in the early 00s, but haven't because of greedy CEOs and immature politicians.
Very cool video, I will do nothing with this information and continue my lifestyle.
I think more detail on the nutrition part is needed. Because meat, and not only muscle meat but liver and other organs and so on contain an insane amount of nutrients. Vegetables nutrient amounts are generally really low and not very bioavailable.
0:04 Let me think long and hard about that. 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 Yes. You're correct. 😎
It is hardly a meat issue though. A big chunk of the issue would solve itself if people stopped eating beef. Beef is like stupid bad for us and the environment. Chicken and fish barely show up on the same chart.
So the best way to get meat is to bypass the whole distribution and produce it myself, Chicken coops and fishing rods, and maybe a pet pig to eat the scraps and eventually become meat for me.
People are also incredibly picky when it comes to grain dedicated for human consumption. Some sorts of grain has basically no error bars and may get classed as animal feed instead. (Sweden)  EDIT; Instead of just spring wheat to grain in general.
You know what is even more efficient than changing dietary habits? Reducing population.
should be reported as fake video.... misinformation during the whole video  not consider carbon consumed to grow grass, the impact of the vegan food production. You chose your side, clearly
This is one of the most complicated problems facing humanity today. On the one hand, change is absolutely necessary. On the other hand, the obvious change, is to ask most humans to change the culture they have been part of for hundreds of years.  Eliminating meat from the human diet is an impossible task. Most likely the better solution would be encourage less meat, which will already help. Other than that, improving farming techniques and lab-grown meat are promising options.
한국어 번역 내놔
Let me guess skillshare
Answer: no and its yummy.
Global warming agenda failed, now climate change agenda
Very well put together and presented.
does this apply to chicken as well? Just curious, is that market a bit different?
Not at all, i love meat! Especially when it's tough and hard.
I don't care if meat is bad for me, I'm still gonna eat it, it tastes good 😋
love you. thank you so much for this video.
How about stop developing cities to decrease carbon footprints and leave food alone? You can live without big skyscrapers for offices but not without food.
No, it’s vegan that’s bad
I don't feel like this really taught anything. I wish you had laid out what is the best meat to buy, and what it the best farming practice. Also, I think it was bit misleading when you talked about animals eating so much of grain or soy. You should stipulate that they are generally eating inedible parts of those products. i would guess that the most sustainable way to produce meat would be in a factory setting and being fed by inedible food byproducts. I'm not super informed but a sustainable farming/best way to buy meat approach would be helpful instead of saying "become vegan or vegetarian". Because in my opinion I don't feel like many people will change their minds and become vegetarian based on carbon emissions. It's possible, but I think the most good would be telling us the most carbon efficient way to buy food. I know this is an impossibly complex topic and I have very limited knowledge on the subject compared your research. I still LOVE the video, but maybe make a series out of it? Also, I think a side channel that is information based without as many animation would be super cool. Yes it would be more boring, but having great facts and writing your own papers/guidelines of what you feel is best way to handle a topic would be incredibly beneficial. Like a podcast or something about these topics would also work, just seems like an easy way to get extra views and have an option to better inform your viewer instead of having them read (because who wants to read scientific papers while on YouTube). You're the best Kurzgesagt!
hell yeah, vegan future is the only way. 🌱
Everyone raid the amazon plant all the native trees Not raid or burn but plant the trees and DESTROY FARMS HHAHAHAHHAHAH i want to eat beef but not anymore I WILL NOT BE VEGAN THOUGH plant trees
Dislike ↓
While I totally agree with the information brought forth in this video (and strongly believe in it- as demonstrated by my long-standing commitment to vegetarianism) I feel it also prevalent to bring up the following: there is no such thing as "land that cannot be converted to farm land" and fertilizer emissions are not "non-removable." I'm a scientist, and I've done field research in both sustainable farming and theoretical research in extraplanetary colonization- there are plenty of ways to remove fertilizers, replacing them with symbiotic soil fungi and intelligently crafted ecosystems that efficiently cycle "inaccessible" nutrients back into useable forms, even in completely barren environments and slightly rocky hills on earth are even easier to convert to farm land- when using the appropriate crops and potentially engineering that is. I love what you do @Kurzgesagt -- In a Nutshell
Just commit sudoku. EZ
I will still eat beaf.
dope
Now here's a question to everyone. What's the percentage of people who doesn't eat meat and the ones who does? Clearly the ones who consumes meat is much much bigger than the ones who does. Now what if its the inverse? Will the co2 emission be significantly less, almost the same, or will there be more? Would like to find out the answer.
Simple, Vegans are mentally ill, and normal humans are not.
I knew I needed to eat less red meat
Dude, why are you talking so much about about Brazil`s fucking rain florest? It is not burning like the news say. I invite you to come see by your self! And more: ppl dont use amazon florest after it is burned to crops. It`s soil gets very poor after 2-3 harvestings (gets a sand-like texture).
Here comes the vegans
This video makes me hungry for a burger
Dislike button here, hope it helps
Searching for this comment "Thanos was right."
remove beef and the will not be any production of corn soy or any other greens , we need the animals to shit so plants grow. Start with food waist and stoping overconsumption , we have a obesety epidemic in the world . beef and animal protein is a important part of a human healty diet , corn and soy makes us sick and fat. do like we used to , consume the hole animal not just slices of beef and stop food waist. we trow away 3,5 billion tons of good food every day and we keep produsing horrible food like soda juces , serial and on and one . so no animal protein is not the problem , it is over consumption and food waist that is the problem. and on it , stop makeing corne sirup for alcohol production and stop produsing trance fats and bad oils to make shity unhealty bad prosessed food. Go back to the stoneage diet and we will eat what we need and be heathy in the process.
Regenerative agriculture is a carbon sink and it uses less fertilizer and your have cows or other farm animals on it as well.
Kurzgesagt just change the thumbnail LOL 😆😂🤣
Like everything in life the answer is complicated. I would like to know Kurzgesagt suggestions on how to solve this problem.
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old"... what an intro
Well, we’ve been eating meat and hunting animals ever since we became a species and now people are saying that we should stop. Seriously, it’s not a controversial topic and it’s completely normal
Now I'm hungry for meat
If I may, it is so much more environmentally sustainable to hunt meat, as long as(this is hugely important) but there needs to be common sense hunting laws. Obviously there shouldn't be any introducing invasive species for hunting. Hunting would need to be well regulated so as to not cause over culling. There are draw backs, meats can be seasonal. Not every area has adequate supply. But any way to reduce the footprint humans leave I'm sure is welcome.
this video misses the point. by a long shot.
as a diabetic person, i cant rely only on carbs to survive... potatoes and other tubers are high in small sugars so... yeah they increase the glicemia
All three arguments are wrong. 1 meat is actually better for you than plants of any kind. There is nothing in a plant that is of any superior nutritional value to meat and usually of much inferior value and often toxic to the point of being deadly. 2 meat requires a fraction of the land manipulation and resources of crops and produces a tiny fraction of the greenhouse gas emissions plant farming does. 3 animal farming is often done on land not suitable for plant farming. Plant farming is often complimented by animal farming and would suffer without it.  Note. Plants actually pollute more over their life cycle than meat and the emissions estimates for meat are extremely exaggerated. Only intensive factory farming raises the emissions of meat and that’s due to all the grain and soy they’re force feed. When doing the plant estimates they’re probably not including all the fertiliser pesticides land manipulation and transport.
Meat requires the intentional killing of sentient beings. Plants don't.
I've been debating for a long time whether I should stop eating meat to reduce emissions. I think after watching this I'm definitely cutting out beef completely, and I'll start experimenting with vegetarian dishes with the end goal of cutting out meat. Thanks Kurzgesagt.
Just eat the bugs maaaaaaaaaaaannnnn
I really understand the idea "vegans are better for the climate change thing". Okay, overall it actually is... but that's not necessarily real if you think about biodiversity conservation, especially for grassland ecosystems... **First of all, I emphasize on this, it is abhorrent the conversion of rainforests to make way for livestock production (especially thinking that we have our own natural grassland)... And yes, it is necessary to reduce meat consumption. But aside from that, it's especially frustrating to see some grassland ecosystems in southern Brazil (which I grew up close to) now being close to extinction due to the modern economic shift from livestock management to monoculture, be it soy, corn, Pinus or Eucalyptus. Until our recent history it was possible to see these ecosystems in different degrees of conservation, varying in terms of the type of management used. In areas well managed with livestock, they have a high species richness, little compaction and even high soil carbon content, sometimes being an important factor for the perpetuation of these communities. Today, many areas simply no longer exist thanks to poor agriculture (which leads to the conversion of habitats and the loss of carbon stocks fixed in the soil to the atmosphere is taking place here as well).  These ecosystems were usually neglected and maybe in this video it was too. I know it's due to reasons such as the lack of time to exhaust the debate, so that's why I wanted to bring this discussion up.
szdfsf
It's not the cow's fault, because we as humanity choose to do this to ourselves. Eat more fruits and vegetables!
Rational, not patronizing, and providing good data that can be analyzed in a useful way. That's a good way to present and debate a topic. Really did a good job with this one.
beef split evenly between beef from milk cows and dedicated for meat cows... damn.  I once thought, there will be a ban on beef to control gas emissions, like the ban of sale of petrol cars.  But you still have half of the cows that produce milk, cheese, etc.  When they die, the meat has to be put to use still.
I'd like to see a video about farming practices in general. From hydroponics, to farm land with fertilizers, to no-till organic living soil. As well as the implications and viability of the various approaches. Where is humanity headed in that respect?
So you went from "lets change the system" to "lets change people, to not change the system". Who bought you? EU? US? Both? Maybe US bought EU to buy you...  :D
thumbnail went from “MEAT LOVE” to “MEAT HATE”
YouTube disabling the dislike button…  Oh wow the world is so much nicer now.   🙄
You tube has taken away our opinions by removing dislikes
We were designed to eat meat. Canine teeth.
So the best solution to the issue is lowering the amount of humans demanding food and other needs that end up in more emission then.
Obviously, the solution is to kill all cows, pigs, chickens, lambs, and turkeys.  If its domesticated, it can't survive in nature, so the only solution is speciecide.
Dude the way he said controversy
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old”  well..
Maybe stop consuming so much in general, maybe not so much fast food? you cant go anywhere atleast where im from and not see a few fast food restaurants every few miles or so. Im sure the amount of beef used would fall substantially, also yall ever read 1984? youre just going to create more systems of division between the elite and everyday people, as if the systems they built the economy with thats draining the world of resources is completely our fault and we always pay for the consequences and we always "make the change" while they continue as planned, if things are gonna change, the foundation must change.
Animal cruelty is wrong
Yes, vegan ideology.  Meat is bad, go vegan. Typical.
1:40 no matter how we turn it, Trillions of humans is way too much.
As soon as I was about to watch this, an ad for McDonald's just popped up
Time to join beef-free diet movement
I think the first step to everything is to consume less. Maybe you don't need meat for every meal
While I don't eat much meat by American standards, I would never give it up completely. Ever. Fxck that
Progressivism wants us not to eat animal meat, but LABORATORY MEAT.
After watching Marvel: Endgame I didn't see Thanos as a bad guy . How have I changed over many years. We need someone like Thanos to interviene . Cuz sadly as diverse we all people are ( some care , some don't ) we won't be able to fix this if we all change .
no
Nope. I'm not going vegan, fuck that. I'm sorry but I'll keep eating beef anytime I can. Sorry. I can give up owning a car and using public transport, but not meat.
4:13 "the last few miles", common. You know that the metric system is just better... I love you, but please use metric system, and human era time (idealy in iso8601 format).
Fine…
Just so you know, on dec 8, this video had 11,000 dislikes vs 296,000 likes (3.7% vs 96.3%)
So are we just going to infinite the fact that he stated that if we only had food products emitting CO2 we’d reach our carbon limit within 100 years then goes on to state that transportation only accounts for 11%. If that were true than the fact that we’ve had animals producing methane and other toxic chemicals by excreting bodily fluids for millions of years would’ve already reached that limit. The truth in the fact is not just the transportation of the beef/grains and every other food it’s within what happens before they’re picked up. You have to take into consideration where that vehicle came from what people use to craft that item into something edible, and what chemicals are used in helping those plants/ animals grow.
A BROCCOLI ON EVERY PLATE, A CORK IN EVERY ASS. This is the way.
You left out health and nutrition…  Our evolutionary diet is based on fatty red meat …  I was a vegetarian for decades and it destroyed my health …  Eating fatty red meat restored it .
I find this discussion topic really absurd. Unsustainability is due to the amount of humans.  Absolutely no change can make humanity sustainable for any arbitrary amount of humans. Not even conquering other planets and solar systems, since the reserves of phosphorus are quite limited in the universe. More meat, less meat? Renewable energies? Forest landmass? Dyson spheres? Black hole generators? We are splitting hairs. Humanity must not surpass the sustainable amount of people, and we are over it already. Not even huge and cruel events like world wars and pandemics make a noticeable difference in the vast amount of people there is.
The most promising thing is the impossible meat, it tastes like %90 meat, very close texture, taste and color, and pretty close nutritional value but the issue is that is very expensive to buy per pound. Once that is more accessible it would be a very good alternative.   Something I would have liked them to cover is bugs as food as they don’t emite as many gasses and don’t require much food or water per the same amount of “meat”.
What if cows and other animals could regenerate their parts like axolots? This does sound like science fiction, but in a couple of years and with lots of genetic engineering maybe it becames possile. But i think the best option would be simulate the taste and texture of meat. The best way, in my opinion, would be to directly mess with our receptors (smell and taste) untill we find a way to "hack" them. Maybe someway of triggering the receptors for meat when we eat vegetables or something like that.
*Cow fart theory is public elementary school garbage.* Vegan environmentalists are just scapegoating cows.
Very nice video, but I think you forgot about the worst methane producers: Dads
No
Unbalance is bad...hey kids, go look at Google Earth...see all those mass cancerous looking tumors all over the planet? Hey kids, THAT'S YOU!
yes it is
GO VEGAN! :·)
Environment is one of the three reasons to stop eating animals and going vegan. Ethics and Health are the other two.
wow. now vegetarians are spreading propaganda through popular channels. time to unsub.
Alright, I’m not sure how well informed the people who made this channel are. Yes, there will always be a small amount of emissions even if we were to switch all energy to renewables and electricity based transportation. However, it isn’t about a quarter of emissions that come from agriculture, it’s the majority, about 51% or so. Even if you combined the emissions from all forms of travel, it still wouldn’t be close with the emissions coming from agriculture. And most of that is from cattle raising. 1. Cutting down trees and wild plant species to make room for cattle and other things means less carbon sequestration in the area. 2. That empty space is typically used for cattle rearing and not much else. We’re talking thousands or even millions of cows in a cramped area, not allowing anything to grow. 2. Cows fart. A lot. The methane coming from growing rice comes nowhere near the amount coming from cows. And methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. 3. Most of the agriculture used in the US is to grow food for cattle, not humans. And there are billions of more cows being raised around the world than there are humans currently. 4. All those cows in a single area not allowing anything to grow kills the soil. All the microbes and bacteria that help keep the soil healthy die from being exposed to UV rays. They’re also killed by pesticides on farms that grow plants. Less microbes means poor soil, and poor soil means less carbon sequestration from plants because there aren’t as many, and since there aren’t as many plants as before, humans need to come in with tons of fertilizer to get enough yield from the farm. On top of that, farmers typically use way too much fertilizer and a lot of it isn’t even used on the farm. It flows into rivers when it rains and then into oceans. That fertilizer causes a major increase in algae. Doesn’t sound too bad. I mean, plants (especially algae) take in carbon dioxide and leave oxygen. Well plants also breathe oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Just on a much smaller scale. Photosynthesis can only happen during the day, so at night all that algae sucks up the oxygen in the water until it runs out. Everything in that area dies, including the algae, and you’re left with a dead zone. No fish, no plants, nothing. Which releases what? A ton of carbon dioxide when all that stuff rots.  Ploughing, pesticides, fertilizer, all the components of modern agriculture simply do much more harm than good. Making land and parts of the sea completely unusable, as we saw with the infamous Dust Bowl incident. But there is a way to fix it, and create better yields in the process. Copying nature.  Increase biodiversity by planting dozens of different species in the same area. Shade trees, fruit trees, perennials, etc. instead of monocultures. Allow grazing over a large area, so that the herds of animals continue to move and more importantly, give the vegetation time to regrow before being grazed again.  We already have the answers. But hardly anyone is talking about them. And even fewer are putting it into action. But those who have, are already having much more success than those who sit around with there thumbs up there asses.
No other bodily function is enjoyed multiple times per day and never gets old... okay Kurzgesagt...
I'm eating meat right now. Tastes good.
7:20 Chandler if he was a bird
did any one see the helper t cell one the plate? 9:46
If I wanted to think about tomorrow, I would really want to think about yesterday again. This spicy writing is supposed to represent an exclamation, a kind of scream from an inwardly oppressed soul. I am almost blackish on the inside when I think of the current circumstances of our society. But not from an egoistic perspective, no, rather from an altruistic, self-sacrificing perspective that foresees a bad future for this world. For a world in which nothing dominates anymore. In a world that is an anarchy of feelings. But even here it doesn't matter how I feel about the world. I know you disagree. That’s yours. But only according to the rules of this world. Because in the end, when the beginning and middle and end of the times are over, only what you did counts. You can do whatever you feel like doing. We live in a society of pleasure, in which every individual pursues his goal erratically: the satisfaction of his needs. Be it sexually, financially, or otherwise. It no longer matters what needs you meet. The only thing that matters here is the fact that every person who kills their time here is a lost person. I know you're only here because you're acting out of fear. Fear of rejection, fear of failure? I hope for you that you know that if you waste your time here, your fear will not decrease. Because every day is worse than the previous one!
Need to put to a prison ppl that drive anything bigger than 2.0 L engine, because that's make them feel free. And prohibited them to eat beef.
4:46 I get your argument but does the plant based food not also need to go on the regional travel?
Yeah aber kurzgesagt you´re overcomplicating it a bit too much, if we deport* some humans in trains we could have more Lebensraum for forests too.
The first thumbnail didnt give me nightmares, this one does, is this an improvement? i think so
I don’t agree with the Shipping VS Sourcing Locally section of the video. Sure transporting goods on a container ship is very efficient but the ship arrives at a dock in Europe and then all the containers are loaded onto trucks that then drive on roads to warehouses and then supermarkets. Not to mention the transport to get the goods to the ship in the sauce country.  Where as locally sourced food is just from suppliers to warehouses to supermarkets.
The takeaway I get from this is this: CO2 is an inevitable cost of feeding humans. Regardless of how much or little meat we consume, it will always be there. The more people we have, the more people we need to feed. Even if the world becomes exclusively vegan, we will always reach a point of no return, where the cost of feeding those people causes too much environmental damage to be long term sustainable.  The issue isn't the food, is the people. There are too many people demanding to be fed, and a planet only capable of sustaining so many. In any other ecosystem, when a species grows past its capacity to feed itself, it begins to die off until it reaches a reasonable level again, which sometimes may include extinction.
I can't help but wonder, what happens with CO2 and other emissions that come from production of supplements we would need to use if we just stopped eating meat? That should not be taken out of the discussion.
At the end of the day, meat tastes good and my personal impact does jackshit compared to the billions of humans and massive corporations that don't care.  Still a really interesting video about food and how it affects the planet.
algorithm comment
So basically, if humans could stop fucking eachother for like 5 minutes, there would be less people to feed and less demand for food.
Something vegans and vegetarians / anti meat people aren’t willing to acknowledge is plant based processed foods, ie. plant based meats and Tofu, Can be horrible for peoples body both short term and long term
Most of the meat in my country is grass fed
The big problem with vegan diets is that they're incredibly unhealthy and we haven't found a way around that yet.
What about insects? Many cultures utilize insect farms to get their protein intake, how does that stand and could it be used at a global scale?
Hey men, as long as it taste as good and it has every single aspect of it IDENTICAL to meat, I could even eat wood itself. Just make it as tasty or more. If not I don't give a shit.
Me100%vegan
Ima go get a burger
I cant believe he actually mentioned the cow fart theory LMAO
but meat tasty, so dont care
Appreciate you guys not sitting on the fence on this, and it seems to have been received very positively.  Most people usually get angry when you suggest that chopping heads off animals is bad.
Watching just made me hungry
Oh please! Soy is not produced in the amazon. It is produced in the cerrado region. The center part of brazil. The amazon is in the north. Actually, very very little of amazon biome region is used for any kind of production, because almost nobody lives there.
So if pastures were replaced for sterilised crop farms, what would the impact of all those additional pesticides be?  As well as the ecological impact to local areas once the pastures are effectively sterilised of all life from those fields?
Birds are cooking meat! Noiceee
The most annoying thing about vegans is that they are right. Both morally and practically.
I invite Mr. In-a-Nutshell to join me in a little experiment.  We’ll rent two identical, enclosed garages, I’ll spend the night in one with a live cow, and you spend the night in the other with a running ICE car.  We’ll meet the following morning to discuss our findings ...
I would realy liked to hear about eating insects, in this video. I hope you will make a video about it in the future.
Imagine humanity deciding that meat is bad overnight. Great Cattle Crusade to kill billions of farm animals to save ecology of such a fragile system as a planet. Surely it won't survive if measly humans return CO2 levels at least to half of Mesozoic levels.
No no... Meat is doing great things for Brazil, as good things as it did to Ireland...
"ô título longo", amei
The crops fed to cattle are almost exclusively the part of the crops that we can’t eat, so that point about the crops is moot. It would just mean we’d throw away larger amounts of crops for nothing.
With or without us the earth has seen several extinction level events. Money and time could be better spent getting us off this doomed rock
Short answer: No.
I think this video had some missed information. While most of this seems fairly accurate, it's also worth noting that cows emissions of the overall spectrum are very small, something ~2% if I remember right? The planet and cows have coexisted for a long time, it makes sense to me that even with many more it still isn't nearly dangerous to the climate, however deforestation, war, power sector, and food waste are far worse polluters that we should likely discuss.
The idea that we should hold ourselves responsible instead of holding wasteful corporations responsible is exactly the type of indoctrination we need to fight. I'm not going to hold myself responsible for the actions of corporations. I understand that by not buying this good it is fighting this waste but actual issue is a lack of engineering innovation in the production of meat not the production of meat itself. There are MANY more harmful forces causing climate change than meat production. "Any kind of extra emissions is not great"......ummmm that is kind of a stupid statement. The emissions from petrochemical refineries (not to even speak of other coal energy generation or other type refineries or other pollutants) is so much more significant that it makes the emissions from cows and meat production practically non-existent.
So. In a nutshell: it is pretty fucking bad.
So long story short, eat less meat so we can afford animals less efficient but happier.
So in other words, meat is GOOD. Vegans are idiots basically believing false information. Also, if we didn't get to milk the cows their udders would explode. If we didn't kill the cows for meat, their methane would kill us!
covid-19 = earth-friendly human = destroyer
one thing that I think people should know [that this video didn't mention],  pasteurized meat production (cattle that eat grass from grassland) actually give a NEGATIVE yield of co2 emission (search on google on this study paper), because "every grass that is eaten by the cattle induce stress in the cell of the grass plant and makes them grows faster by absorbing more CO2 in the air and soil that the animal release".  somehow this is become a forgotten symbiosis-mutualism biology we all learn from school and has never been considered in the table to calculate these emission problems.   if you ask me how much CO2 does a natural honey farm yields? without doubt or any research, I will say negative too. this is just how nature has balance stuff for millions of years now. it is just the way of us, as humans, always wanting to find a way to create products/foods as cheaper and as faster as we can that cause CO2 heavy emission because we cheat with nature for our short benefits.    and also I don't think plant based meat products must be supported, all plant base alternative meat right now is used heavily on the soy-based plant, or worst, using palm oil, which both have very unstable unsaturated fat that goes rancid so fast that they need to use a preservative or some GMO to make it last longer and protected while in storage.  I've done this research for like 8 years when I was so interested to be a doctor and scientist in human nutrition. and I believe this trend [of swapping anything from "real nutrient-dense food" to "alternative modified plant food"] is just another "big guy business" strategies happen so many time just like decades ago. let's remember how Butter (milk fat) was damned so bad for humans that Margarine (plant soy-palm oil-modified fat) sell gone rocket. or maybe we can say the same with the weed vs tobacco battle in the 80-90s. and so on.
I never liked meat so I've been vegetarian  all my life. Now I can use my personal distaste as a testament to my moral superiority.
Videos today tell kids that meat is disgusting when it is as good as vegetables.
I’ll eat extra steaks for you guys
Did you all consider White Oak Pastures in this?  Their operation is a carbon sink and pretty ethical.
I would be interested in seeing a societal change where meat returned to being a special occasion once-in-a-while food. A Sunday roast, a birthday meal, Christmas feast, etc. Then it might be feasible to reclaim some agricultural land and be more ethical through reduction of animal mass production. Grass fed might not be the most efficient, but at least the beef gets to live a happy life... before being eaten.  Also I'm quite honestly surprised by the difference between pork and beef. If I had to guess, I would have estimated pork being the number two in the hall of shame. Definitely not lamb.
This video makes me feel like there is just too many human mouths to feed and that is the problem.  I'm rooting for COVID-19, take as many as you can.
music is too loud dude......
Everyone talks about how meat emits a lot of emissions but nobody talks about the sheer volume of chemicals used in crop farming. Crop farming is pretty damn disgusting in itself with how much is sprayed on them, how little of that land is still liveable for other creatures and how bees are just dying out in general. Maybe some topic to do with that? It felt completely forgotten about in the entire video and just made it out to be "crops good meat bad". I don't even eat meat much at all and it still felt one-sided in that discussion.
What would plant based meat affect the emissions
5:32 I don't really want to think about the beef emissions from my beef emitting beefs
chicken breast is bussin tho
My opinion is that some years into the future we would mostly dine on cultured meat and stuff that are wholly made in labs with zero emissions, and we'll overcome this the scientific way
But ive seen a scientific show that they created meat out of plants is it true first saw it on cnn
Fine, I'll become a vegetarian. Except on special occasions tho
so in conclusion: vegans are right
Ummmm, we have significantly reduced our methane emissions to the point the amount in the atmosphere is actually being reduced as I understand it. Has a lot to do with us changing a lot of stuff we used to use I believe.
Amazing video, as usual :) Go Vegan!
to be honest i dont think eating meat is bad but i dont think we should torture the animals in those factories
So there one more thing we haven't talked about even though it's quite new and not realistically available for mass consumption yet, but lab engineered meat. Like Just Foods creating a replica of chicken without killing any chicken for it - if that was viable, how much would we save the planet?
"The best beef is worse than the worst plant" a quick search of research on beef carbon emissions shows that beef can be raised with net *negative* carbon emissions. How did their researchers miss this? The best beef is carbon negative...
for those interested in the ratio this video has 11k dislikes as of now, meaning likes are clearly winning ! :p great video
Meat is life.
Proud Hindu music intensifies !! 💯🔥🙏
Cattle can eat parts of the crops that are not edible to humans.  Also, it's worth noting, that even though according to your data more than 50% of human-edible crops are fed to animals, huge amount of >human< food is discarded and not consumed. And that happens predominantly with plant-based foods, not animal-based.  Despite all the claims of how animal fat/protein are dangerous and carcinogenic, there is little evidence to support it. Animal products can be very healthy to consume when not combined with highly insulinogenic carbs. Vegan food can be highly processed and it's completely industrialized, at this point it's a fad, and a lot of people who follow vegan diet have little regard to actual healthy nutrition.   It's possible human health would massively decline if vegan became a more predominant diet. We have a gut close to that of carnivores, more capable of digesting nutrient dense food such as meat.  It's also worth mentioning that there is evidence to show the contrary as well, that lands are turning into wastelands from massive GMO usage and overusing them without regards to their restoration. There's no real proof that picking a veggie burger over a meat-based one is ultimately best for the environment.  I would like to state that the idea that "vegan/vegetarian spreading more widely as a diet would help with the environment (or our health)", has about as strong evidence as the claim that "fat shaming helps fat people lose weight because it motivates them to eat less".
This thumbnail keeps changing
Damn
we really need to learn on how make lab grown meat, this shit's getting out of hand, and not everyone's gonna accept on no longer eating meat
Only thing I don't understand is the argument against buying locally. Because sure shipping it across the sea in shipping containers might have less emissions than driving it locally on a truck, but that's assuming that it's not going on a truck once it reaches its destination. So shipping it in cargo containers are more of an additional cost, more than an alternative one right?
Carbon offsets. Plant them if you want to help out, otherwise butt out of people's diet. A lot of these hyped up issues wouldn't be considered if we didn't have big metropolitan nightmares that are full of human cattle.
*Stop having babies.* for only ten years.. . Simple solution
wait.. so.. should I buy my vegetables from overseas if the transport from overseas is so much more efficient per kg food than the transport by truck from the region?
Dont think meat is all that bad, it's what they put in it that makes it really bad.
'Is meat really that bad?' Yes, because a sentient animal that did not want to die was slaughtered to make a burger that will be forgotten about 1 minute after eating it.
so what about the maneur, how many animals do we have to keep around for fertilizers? is there a sweetspot?
Meat is very bad. Send me all your meat for proper disposal.
A personal story here.. I'm prone to depression and have been in and out of it since 10 years. I tried antidepressants, hormones, exercise, supplements, vegetarian diet, vegan diet, ... But the main thing that works for me is limiting carbohydrates and increasing fat and protein.I even tried the carnivore diet for a week and I can't recall feeling so incredibly balanced EVER. Make up your own mind people.
Misleading and using debunked data. Missing the value of cloven hoofed animals in recuperating ruined ecosystems. Doesn't mention toxicity of plant foods, malnutrition of plant based diet, soy effect on hormones correlated with global decline in testosterone and sperm motility, or that phoney beef burgers are more environmentally damaging than the real thing. Do better research by finding unbiased sources not sponsored by Big Agra or metadata compiled by vegans. COWS SAVE THE WORLD is a book to start with.
I have decided already, will eat some meat ASAP
Ok for meat, but what about other animal food products? Is dairy worse than some meats, and is so which ones? Is it worse than plant-based alternatives? What about eggs?
"hurr durrr, soy destroys rain forrests...." and in the end, you eat it in your meat. Bon apetite!
It's too simplistic to demonize beef like this. Grasslands that get no input at all have cattle graze on them, it's a biogenic cycle. The methane is only produced by the cellulose in the grass which has grown from absorbing co2 from the atmosphere. It's a 10 year cycle - there are no inputs, its sustainable beef reared on redundant land. Grass is a perennial, it absorbs co2 all year. I'm a farmer is as loose as I own a boat. Is it a rowing boat? a speedboat, mega yacht etc, boat isn't enough. neither is lumping together farmers. Cattle in brazil, cattle on huge cattle lots in US, barley beef systems are not the same as grass fed beef on a  10 year cycle. 30% of methane is from cattle, 20% is from rice but paddy fields don't make good clickbait headlines so we simply ignore this.  Co2 from burning fossil fuels is not comparable to beef production that doesn't burn fuel, grass reared cattle. The only contributors is transporting the cattle, buy local from the farm supplier  and it's as neutral as you can get on co2. Cow its grass, breaks down cellulose & starch IN the grass, burps out methane, methane goes up into atmosphere, breaks down as co2 and water, grass absorbs the co2 and water and releases oxygen back into the atmosphere via photosynthesis. A natural cycle that is ignored when looking at the ways farmers are farming and instead demonized by some of the terrible global practices and  short term views creating scary headlines
Maybe we should start talking about: HOW MUCH OF THIS FOOD IS GOING TO WASTE. Those are milions of tons. I love meat, but I buy as much I can eat. Not everyday. That is the problem.
Beef should be banned in the world , according to Hindu Culture killing animals is a bad thing and killing Cows is the most worst thing in hindu culture
Until this video i was strongly indifferent about veganism x meat diets, now I am really thinking about starting to go to an meat-free diet, no vegan, i love milk products a lot to go vegan :/.
You know what is the biggest driver of emissions? Humans. If only there are less humans, less humans means less food required to sustain the population and will emit less overall pollution,  since they never existed in the first place. Consider the amount of Methane gas Humans produce.
meat isn't bad except from those karen vegans that thinks that animals cant be eating
Scientifically accurate video. Happy to see that
I wonder what would hapen if every human would plant 10 trees.
Like most things it's nuanced and complicated and it's going to take a lot of team-work and working together to figure out what's going to realistically work
Ahhhh the liberal and progressive undertones wrapped up in a cute sciencey YouTube channel.
Meat itself isn't that much of a problem. Main issue is that humanity eats way too much meat. We can (and should) eat meat. Just not that much.
Yeah, more climate change propaganda and promotion of the globalists plans. Pathetic.
I love you guys. But I love beef as well... 😭
well i barely ever have beef  very rarely so by this information i would be around 1.8 billion  that is fine with me. but honestly there is a much easier ssolution to this issue aand that is lowering birthrates  soo there is less demand for food in general  with less people in need of food and better techniques it would stabalise the production levels and eventually help with the lowering of emissions.   food isn't the biggest problem the biggest would be power  comnsumption  which will only go higher and higher.
About the growing of forests to recycle the air from pollutants. I studied this during the Amazon Forest  fires a few years ago. plants only cleanse local air, don't look at these forests like a global filter of CO2 and Methane, it doesn't work like that. Plancton in responsible for most of the world's cleansing. Very misleading, but then again they just released a video on how they lie to us on purpose because we are too dumb to understand colorful graphics, apparently.
What about meat being delicious and "veggie patties" an abomination? I'm sorry, but this is the only criteria I will take into account.
A good bowel movement is also something we can enjoy more then once a day.
How can one live without eating beef though.. Vegetarian food is disgusting and just not filling.
CO2 is a fraud, plants eat it and dinosaurs had way more CO2 and O2 when they live.

I can't wait for all the vegetarians and vegans make a response video trying to blast this video and going reee
800 billion tons per 100 years, vs 50 billion per one year emitted..... the graph is so out of proportion!!!  timestamp 9:23 it should be more like 50,000 billion tons emitted over 100 years. not very objective for a channel that claims to be objective. The most frustrating thing when people make graphs that don;t match the numbers to "prove" a point.
from 2016-2021.. i already try vegan for 2 years.. and carnivore diet for 4 year.. and some other type in mid.. carnivore diet best all of type,.. i love vegetable but meat is the best food for human from my own experience.. i go vegan for my own experiment.. not for earth/animal love bullshit or what.. its not a bad diet.. but cant compare to pure meat
In Denmark the State has started paying Farmers to allow their lands back to forrests.  This is great especially for Farmers who are looking for an out from being Farmers.
I love meat luckily I rarely have meat any way.
the whole by boat thing is that after it gets off a boat it gose onto a truck... 1000's of trucks..  so the whole "its carbon efficient" is a bunch of BS, probably some big company's put it out so they look like the good guys, and to not support local.
That Thumbnail has the same energy as the "You should kill yourself, NOW." meme
No way. Were gonna continue to eat ruminant steer as was intended. Im not a ruminant cud chewer. Im not a primary consumer. Anyone who thinks so is braindead. Screw veganism its a mental illness.
so in short, yes meat bad
한국어 좀 있으면 ㅠㅠ
7:20 is this a Chandler Bing reference?
I think thumnail changed
Aaah, yes. The good old climate change agenda always used as the device to guilt people into behaving accordingly.
Yes it is, it causes pain, and a terrible horror of death
I knew cows cause global warming but didn't know it's because they fart a lot.
moral of the story: NO BEEF xd
10:12 it seems that you forgot your Spanish lesson
“Be vegetarian!” Is the answer))
Truth to be told, the climate problems is ultimately driven by one human desire, 'pursue of satisfaction'. No one have a right to deny any human being to improve their life in all aspects of life. Like this video examples, meat is the highest satisfaction regarding of food taste. The poor people who wanted to improve their life would like to increase meat consumption. It is the same in ease of transportation, better housing, better tools, better education etc. All we need is better planning and more option to get the satisfaction we need. For examples, the Dutch and Japanese have more viable option to transport anywhere in ease such as in bicycle and fast train rather than only gas-driven automobiles. And most of them rather choose the alternative one than car if both option have equivalent result. It's the same for food, there is a need for better option of food to rivaled the meat than we currently have. To told people to switch to less 'satisfactory' option are not accepted of course, only if the option food is equally rivaled the meat taste, or better. But all in all, we must PLAN BETTER. If we fail to plan, we plan to fail. The infrastructures need to be planned ahead, so any problems can be cope ahead. The economy must be planned more diversely, so no 'all egg in one basket' situation became a high-risk problem. We need to do more NEW things to have MORE option, so R&D needed more funding. Essentially, more unique option provided more flexibility for us humans to survive the future ahead.
How about we stop eating beef, chicken tastes 10x better anyways
Most of the people are not aware that Biologically humans are meant to eat veggies and grain not meat.
Thank you !!!
"No bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day." Hold my d-
Now do fishing industry
no one honestly needs some vegan diet karens to tell us what to do. We will eat beef like we don't are about the environment
Reducing meat consumption is actually good for the environment, me myself trying to reduce my meat consumption to once a week, but man some non meat eaters tends to feel moral superiority and antagonize/demonize others, that's what I hate from that community, how in the fck do you think people will recieve your ideology when you be little others
Go vegan!
Thus like asking, is the air 💨 good for you or water good for you.
Carbon bad mkay. 400ppm is to high. Better have zero so plants cant breathe
I am a Hindu and in our Hinduism meat eating is criticised very much and vegetarianism was always promoted. I am proud to belong from such a religion.🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
The emissions from food hasn't increased because of humans.  Life has been feeding on life for as long as there's been life on earth.  So why should anyone worry about this 26 percent?
I have only one question: Are your date based on global sources or just about the US?
8:14 that stonks reference caught me off guard but its damn funny nothenless
how bad is concrete?
I will never quit eating meat even if it kills me so stfu and let me die       *Likes*
Yes, meat is very bad. It can cause cancer and is bad for the planet. Eat beans (Y)
I occasionally eat beef maybe twice a month, that is in a form of McD burger.
well I'm poor but I want to eat meat and vegan meat is expensive so nah
lets just not eat lol. lets die so the earth can be left to itself as it should
I love meat. Fk ideology
We've been eating it since the beginning of when and it tastes nice. Why do you think we have molars.
Jesus:-Vegetarian Allah:-Vegetarian (Its said) Vishnu:-Vegetarian Buddha:-Vegetarian When all gods are veg then why we cant?
Your channel constantly pushes a climate change narrative If we are really interested in reducing emissions stop population growth Seen on a T-shirt... "Stop animal cruelty and save the planet Eat Humans"
Before we can worry about climate change. We need to tackle worse things. Like depression, addiction, slavery, corruption. Personally I think these are the top world problems. If we humans can't fix ourselves, we wont be able to fix this world. I'm all for efficiency but what this world really needs is strong, wise, individuals who have a good heart.
We Indians are the country with the least meat consumption. Unfortunately in climate summit, we are expected a lot by developed countries. Even if we consume meat we do not do that every day we do it on particular days of the week like Sunday.
Well it’s worse than you think actually. Each time you eat meat or anything that had an animal stressed to extract it, dairy products etc. You stink on the astrals. In other words, just fkin stop eating puss! Plain & simple . Not complicated at all. We used to mummify these animals. Just let that sink in.
What about local plant based products? Is the emission lower because its lighter? How does the plant based stuff get from the ship to the grocery store - not by truck?
I used to work in the farming sector and now I am vegan. Animal welfare and environment being reasons that farming is just not compatible with
Thet changed the thumbnail. I guess vegans were mad lil
Thye changed the title and thumbnail
Overall love the video as always, but there is a glaring issue in comparing the emissions of shipping 1kg of avocados internationally vs 1kg of beef locally.  Those avocados don't magically warp to the grocery store from the dock. Even though mass freight shipping may have a lower impact for distance traveled they still have to go through additional distribution hubs and arrive to the local store by truck just like the beef. From the prospective of someone living in a landlocked state in the middle of the US this will also add the additional emissions from the shipping from the coastal port. So the avocados would come in at 2.5kg of CO2 for international shipping + 18kg of CO2 for the "last few miles" + the shipping from the coast to a local distribution hub. So any international food shipments should be more like 20.5kg of CO2 + the additional CO2 getting them from the port to your town.  I didn't miss that one of the main points there was packaging and transport is only about 11% if the overall emissions. But that did feel kind of intentionally misleading about transport emissions created for local vs. imported food.
literally nothing tastes as good as steak
who wonders if kurzgesagt became the president?   Will he nuke a city? or throw elephants from a skyscraper?  Or Maybe he will solve our problems?
Bill gates funded "science education" videos
I was surprised to hear that food transported by sea has such a low emissions rate..  i read a couple years ago that 16 idling supertankers had the equivalent emissions of all the cars in North America..  it must just be amortized over the shear number of items on the ship (and perhaps not including the food waste on those long trips in the metric)
Anyone notice that they changed the thumbnail?
Really great video!
Solutions from Poland: be poor then you can't eat beef because beef is too expensive for you xd
Is it just me or was this video initially called "Meat Love"? If so, what happened and why'd you have to change it?
Can we just...reduce horniness? ._. So at least one family has 1 or 2 child
Rarely eat meat not because emission, because meat is expensive than egg / chicken XD
I feel like "Is Beef Really that Bad?" might be a more accurate title since this video focuses so much on beef production, not meat production as a whole.
Damn
Insects. They're the future of our civilization. Insects protein is far easier to farm and consumes tons less energy and water. Disgusting, yes. Nourishing, absolutely. I've stopped eating ground beef and switched to plant made beef, and it's not that different. I could see the same thing happening with burger patties!
Great vid, but two points: 1) the topic of antibiotics over-use and antibiotics resistance was not mentioned. 2) Regarding carbon footprint of cow methane, this carbon comes from cow feed, i.e. plants, which was absorbed from the air by photosynthesis. So why does this carbon actually increases the amount of C in the atmosphere?
All I see is a non industry trying to shut down the meat industry. All based on politics. First, right off the bat, you have no clue what you're bitchin about or wont post it. Do all plants on the planet thrive on CO2 ? You post that all these carbon emmissions are floating around in the atmosphere, destroying the planet. Did you not factor in how much of the CO2 is used by the plants? But the answer wont fit your destructive narrative, will it. You feed off the fear generated by the public to feed your political fat. Secondly, this land you want to confiscate and turn into a wilderness that is devoid of all people, BELONGS TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS. IT IS PRIVATE LAND. END OF STORY.  The biggest producers of hot air and methane comes from Washington DC and the NGO's that feed and fatten at the expense. Go to another solar system and pedal your lies elsewhere. America is sick of you.
How many vegans liked this? I don't know because if my carnivores would be represented we would see the dislikes.
0:01 couldn't agree more with u there g
I would argue that food is one of the worst things about being alive. You're required to spend so much time, effort, and money in acquiring and consuming it just to survive, and a lot of the time it's gross to eat. (At least to me. I do admit I'm a bit of a special case.)
So then even if we don’t do anything about meat/cattle or killing them climate change is still going to happen even if we don’t do any killing and only eating human made beef/meat and not killing any cattle climate change is still going to happen?
NO FUCKING WAY I WILL STOP EATING MEAT!
Utopia Moment:  Can we get a video on the current state of vegan meat please?
Yeah I won't be here in 60 years.  Fuck it.  Let the Earth burn.  Evolve or die, Kids.
thats it, No more meat for me anymore, Or at least less beef
put latin spanish subs >:c
Wow this had so much biased cherry-picking of facts to push biased narrative. This channel just lost all credibility for me. Unsubscribed.
This video is gonna get some people HEATED.
As a air lover this is truly interesting debate..
And this is why we need more resources on the development of lab grown meat, which is having the best of both worlds*** as in you have cruelty free meat, with less waste and less emissions***  Big asterisks here since I have no data to back this up, but surely lab grown would mean at the very least less land used for cattle and less methane emissions.
The title should be appended with "for the environment."
yeah, omnis are pretty much going to look at the title to get all the justification they need to keep murdering animals
Here’s is the solution. Recognize that emissions to keep humans alive are necessary. If you don’t like it kill yourself and not others.
The video idea was wonderful, but coming out the other end, it didn't feel like the best balance between keeping or getting rid of meat from our dietary structure. Most of it was focused on why meat is bad for the environment. There were points made about protein levels, but it was still wrapped in the "but does that matter if the vegetables do less harm". Digging deep into the nutritional benefits that meat holds over vegetables, such as you would need to each vast amounts more vegetables to get the kind of value from a piece of steak, that would have been cool to look at. Overall, "is Meat Really that Bad?" suggests this will be an evenly weighted discussion, while it was primarily focused on one part of this complicated topic, and heavily implied that because it produces so much more carbon emissions, it's a bad choice, in my opinion.
See I would have taken this video seriously if you mentioned regenerative agriculture, like even once 😂
The worst most obviously corrupt video you've ever made. You should be completely ashamed of yourselves for taking money from the meat and dairy industry. Such a disgusting bias.
There is simple way to solve the climate issues... cut down the population by halve.  - Thanos probably

I like how eliminating meat is a solution before regulating the carbon footprint of the internet. Or China.
Many people would change faster if the veggie patties and meat substitutes would not be forcefully inflated. They cost less to produce than beef and pork, but have higher prices. It is a nightmare to be conscientious about the world when everyone tries to profit by over inflating the greener choices because greed.
Pure propaganda.
Go vegan
I just want to know. If we change to soy entirely, which would be the numbers? Because looking back this might not be the entire thing of the solution. Considering that only ~10% of the world is either vegan or vegetarian, it seems unlikely to me that we could balance out the numbers of soy anyway without affecting gravely the environment just like with beef.
me physically unable to eat beef: ah yes, I really am simply a saint
I love meat. That doesn’t mean I would love it any less if we made synthetic substitute that looked, cooked, and tasted the same. Don’t understand why people get weird about it. It would all but minus the worst effects, the same.
And Kurzgesagt went heavily provegan... Only not mentioning that there is no way to grow organic food without manure from animals. But hey, let's just use artificial manure instead that leaches out in rivers and causes algae bloom instead... Ooopsie... Yeah, the solution of food is "complicated" and cannot easily be solved by humans going vegan. Just look at the Great Panda. Instead of being able to be active like other bears it just sits around and eats all day as the nourishment is so low in the vegetations it eats.  And in the end, I haven't met one vegan who doesn't have a pile of tablets they have to eat each day to make sure they don't go deficient in vitamins or other nutrients that are vital to a healthy human body.
meh,........ meh.........nah.......
They were right to say in the bible the world will end in fire
9:20 Seems shady comparing what 3 billion hectares of land can do over 100 years to what we emit in one year. 800 billion tonnes in 100 years = 8 billion tonnes a year, why couldn't you just say it as is.
I buy local because I want to help the people in my community and not help the billionaire corporations get richer. I had never thought about it being better for the environment or not
publicly commerciallized lab-grown meat please come faster, all the knowledge and morals are ruining my carnivorous enjoyment
I have a solution to this- venison! Deer can live in forested areas and do not require crops, they’re healthier than beef, Their emissions are very minimal, and if cooked right, are indistinguishable from beef. Sure there’s less meat on a deer, but if we let the forests grow we’ll have more room for the deer to live. I feel like is as a society need to branch out a little from just beef, chicken, and pork
I eat meat and I'm not going to stop, but I don't think anyone can deny the ethical argument, but the health argument is debatable, and as for global warming, I don't think not eating meat is the solution.
You guys should look up permaculture and agroforestry.
This world would be so much better without industrial farming. I’m not telling people to stop eating meat, but to stop industrializing the production of it.
I've never heard methane pronounced that way
I don't give a rats ass what effect cow farts have on the climate. I'm not giving up beef. Not even a little. I refuse to starve myself now eating only plants now to have a slim hope of it *maybe* positively effecting climate change later.
I don't like the thumbnail change. This feels just *too* clickbaity.
I love the video, but this really makes global warming a personal choice. Isn't it more of a cooperate choice? if it's a choice is shouldn't be a harm.
I'm not compromising on food, tell that to Bill Gates.
To fix this let's just stop eating
idc beef good.
Esperando los subs en español
One simple question, if everyone eats vegan burger and it indeed free up all the lands, do you really think people will just let grass grow on these lands? I am almost certain the billionaires will buy up those lands for something worse.  BTW, this is really a first world country problem only. People in developing countries still need more animal protein from modern farms to keep themselves healthy and strong.
All the care here seems to be about C02 and nothing about the cruelty of it all
As a meat eater I don't think there is a great defense for eating meat. The only reason the war on eating meat is not intense is because elites aren't on board. I don't know if they will be until extremely high qaulity replacement is available. I am transitioning more and more to plant based. Lastly, FJB!!!
Just stop eating meat at once! What's your problem???
What does that mean, that "even if we extinguished all other sources [of carbon emissions] the emissions of food alone would use up our entire carbon budget by 2100?"
Dont care meat is tasty
Though we evolved to become omnivores and can eat plants, we cannot survive on plants alone. Humans thrive on eating meat - beef, especially organ meats, are some of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet. So in terms of nutrient density, the CO2 argument is a little disingenuous. It's not only about calories, nutrients matter too. Regenerative grazing can actually absorb and capture CO2. Cows aren't the problem, mass industrial farming is. I'll stick to beef burger patties over highly processed low-quality pea protein patties.  Western countries don't have a calorie problem, they have a nutrient density problem.
I love the taste of meat especially beef
Call me crazy, but didn’t you guys have a video going over the same topic only on the one exact opposite side of the discussion with a thumbnail that looked very similar to this one?
Carbon footprint and this "climate crisis" has been an ever-evolving bullshitfest since the 70s.
this made me hungry
Meat is the best possible source of energy that you can put into your body.
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG kurzgesagt, you guys made it from angle thumbnail to                                                   *this*
Recently I watched a video claiming how bad it is to produce energy (ethanol) from corn, since the main paper (from which the YouTuber founded his claims) said that the overall process did not reduce the carbon used per unit of energy. However the paper completely omitted the fact that carbon is stored in the entire plant, not just in the grains, and that only half of the corn plant’s weight is in the grains. I hope your sources did not make such stupid mistakes
Meat lobbyists lining the right pockets it seems,
dislike counter here :
This is not the conclusion of this video, but some may think the the opposite of following. I don't think getting rid of meat is a solution. It's never going to be ever since we evolved with taste buds. But what we could do is mandate air filtration and indoor grazing pasteurs which can remove methane from releasing into the air to beef producers. Land is also private property so evicting farms for rainforests will not be a thing. But what we can do is tax rainforest destruction/land and support green growth with that money.   Also should note. We should have giant parachutes with solar panels in space. That will block sunlight to slow global warming and provide energy to the surface.
Consider making a video on CO2 pricing, as it's taking a lot of relevance lately.

This vidoe make me want bugrer 🍔🍔🍔
im my grandpa farm we only give non human eatble parts of crops for cowns
I hate that u didn’t touch on the fact that the monocropping system we run destroys soil while livestock rebuilds it
This video has 11.2k dislikes, 7 days after uploading
Meat industry is bad. Overpopulation is bad. Eating meat is definitely not bad.
What about things like nutrient density? Like vitamins and minerals and crucial fatty acids.
This channel is such a net positive for humanity
7:15 could be a Japanese light novel title :')
long story short: no.
A reminder that the majority of emissions cannot be stopped or climate change averted by individual choices. The majority of emissions come from vast industry that benefit very few.
Could you do a video on wether or not meat is bad for you health wise?
I find it strange that a several thousand tonne boiler chugging hundreds of gallons of oil per day to float across water is somehow less emissive of Co2 than a car or diesel truck is.  Little weird but okay.
8:17 another one to the out of context
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive.” Unless you are a farm animal. Then it's the worst thing about being alive, because someone will torture and kill you for pleasure.
Remember when people are more liver, heart and kidney.
There are 11k Dislikes from what i'm seeing. Get "Return Dislikes Youtube" Best thing to get if you want them. Which is actually Surprising to me because I think it would be way more disliked from dramatic topic of "opinions." But this is basically facts that's hard to handle and we need to figure out what is the best middle ground at this point.
Im just switching to chicken, pork, and veggies only.
Birds eating cows, dogs and cats living together! Mass hysteria!
Also leaves beef with the emissions tab for forest clearing, while previously stating that both beef and veggies require cleared land.
Immediately assume that vegies magically teleport from the docks to your local store, with no trucking involved. 🙄
I can give up beef, lamb and pork easy as long as we keep fish and poultry
_ahem_ IF OTHER ANIMALS EAT MEAT THEN PEOPLE CAN EAT MEAT. Vegans may now leave the dislikes... oh wait.
Never mind the catastrophically unethical practice of breeding innocent, sentient beings into existance, only to treat them as property/resources, holding them in disgusting conditions, and then brutally slaughtering them when they're at a fraction of their potential life span, all just so that we can get a few minutes of taste pleasure every day.
amog
Why no mention of fish?
boring veganszz
brooooooo meat is the best bro cows are delishhhhh
democrat voters must be removed from cities. and we need more cows spread evenly throughout usa to prevent climate change. concentrated cow farts are spearing the ozone
If you substitute eating cows with eating pork or chicken all you're doing is substituting very bad with bad and very evil with very evil. It's really not that hard to stop eating meat. At this point it's all about the ego. Is your ego big enough to put your right to eat meat, before the future of your children, your health, the whole planet and the lives of the hundreds of animals you consume meat from each year?
Only Chads remember the "Meat Love" Thumbnail
People only eat the fucking soy beans, that is why the rest is given to animals
Guys take care of yourself 🥺😍
Yeah but, those stats about the percentage of crops that goes to human consumption is essentially because the rest of the organic matter cannot be digested by humans. Corn for example, we only consume 20% of the total biomass, the rest is turned into food for the cattle so that you have meat.
Thank God someone is effectively debunking the "what ive learned" video on this
8:12 Kurzgesagt should i add you at r/fellowkids
It is mostly because they burp that cows release CH4, and not because they are farting.
3:07 bird sync 'but is this fair?'
Interesting fish wasn't mentioned. Any data on how eating fish compares to eating beef? I heard it's even worst carbon footprint.
9:08  Provided that we completely remove meat from our diet, how do we satisfy the immediate deficiency caused by the lack of an energy and nutrient dense food category? It's lovely to obtain billions of hectares of land to cultivate new ecosystems, but I imagine a global shift to plant based food to pose a radical challenge.  Love your work, birds!
@Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell    I'm just going to go through the some of the statements you've made and clarify them or just disagree with them.   First, methane emissions in rice.  As I understand it any soil that is water logged long enough will eventually turn anaerobic and start to emit methane instead of co2.  So, this can become an issue with any system that has insufficient water use intensity.  Those tend to not to be grasslands or savannas because they are very good at handling varying amounts of soil saturation.  This topic is worth a semester in school all by itself and is far more involved than what you are showing. You also briefly mentioned nitrous oxide.  In most of the US, the nitrous oxide and the pollution of waters with nitrates and phosphates is due corn, soy, poultry, and swine sectors.  And no, the corn and soy industry is not the same as the beef and lamb industry.  Also, waters that are heavily polluted will also emit nitrous oxide and methane. As far as the emissions in agriculture, those numbers are flawed as hell.  The flaw can be seen in this example.  Let's look at an acre grassland with 6% SOM and grew 5 tons of forage and has 1 cow.  Let's assume the cow eats all that forage in one year and emits it as co2 and methane and stores some of it as mass.  If the next year the SOM is still 6% and it still grows 5 tons of forage, then net increase in heating affect due to that system is 0 because the amount of carbon in it on average has not changed.  All the LCA's I have seen make the assumption that these emissions exist without first being sequestered.  In fact, a scientist that sits on the IPCC recently called analysis that takes the sequestration side of the equation into account as "paradigm shifting."  To be clear it is not "paradigm shifting," it's a complete analysis.  The methane side of that can be addressed later.  So, any real gains in atmospheric carbon are going to be almost entirely due to the expenditure of fossil fuels in the system or ecological deterioration.  You also made the assumption that it is the meat industry that is causing the deforestation.  If you were to actually look into this, you would see an acceleration in the rate of deforestation and rangeland loss around 2008.  This is a notable time as it coincides with a rise in the price of corn and soybeans largely due to consumption from biofuels.  That is still occurring today.  If you look at satellite photos of the amazon you will see pasture pushing into the rainforest, but if you look closer you will see farmers right behind them pushing forward.  They are being driven out by government backed economics, same as in the US. The argument for efficiency in factory farming is somewhat limited as you completely glossed over the inefficiency of their externalities which are never truly taken into account in any LCA.  Also, it still does not address any fossil fuel use, or the role ecology plays in agricultural systems.   Your breakdown of crop uses is not wrong, but it is pathetically naive and idealistic.  And the same goes for your argument about setting land aside for nature.  Here are a set of questions for you to think about that might help you understand why your view is naive at best. 1)  Will a piece of farmland feed more people with or without cows? Hint: The answer is with. 2)  How does a natural grassland differ in emissions from a grassland with cows? 3)  How do methane emissions from wild animals in these systems differ from methane emissions from cows?
I like the open ended question at the end. Really makes you think. This is why I like this channel.   For me, I personally dont like eating beef and there are good veggie equivalents but I still eat animals produce and dont see myself stopping any time soon. I do somehow prefer nut milk than dairy. I dont know what does says about me but who knows I might stop eating animals.
I would rather reduce the amount of people than give up food I like. Read what you want into that and apply methods of your choice. The real problem is over population across the board.
Please, stop buying meat from Brazil, meat producers are destroying our country.
A great information download, thanks. [Edit] IMO we need to be thinking about 'what if 10B people did this'.
In Costa Rica the beef industry actually captures carbon, adds forest and the cattle roams freely for most of its life. If you want to know more about it look for the Earthshot prize given to us.  The world needs to create the same incentives to farmers in Brazil
Basically, we're fucked
eat more beef ez
Yeah, you hear it!! stop eating meat! specially YOU person that need all the proteins that meats gives. yeah you the one that lives in a 3rd world country, I, the one who lives in a 1rst world country  (Reach that place by contaminating) Commands you stop eating meat...So yeah stop eating meat or we all are going to die, now if you excuse me, i will take my flight to a country that is only 200 km.
I love meat. It makes me happy.
What was all that stuff about having seaweed in cattle’s diet, and how it drastically reduces the cows’ emissions?
So what I get from this is that Thanos was right?
The old thumbnail was a cow with heart emojis in its eyes and the text said meat love
YES. Saved you a video.
Kurzgesagt: "Your diet does not give you an ethical high ground." Also Kurzgesagt: "Your burger is killing Brazil and also the environment."
Ok... stop counting methane emissions as a greenhouse gas more potent than carbon dioxide. Methane is thermodynamically unstable in the presence of oxygen. And unlike glucose which can sit with oxygen just fine as long as you don't burn it, methane will _oxidize_ under sunlight. Astronomers look for methane and oxygen in the same planet as a possible sign of life because there needs to be a methane source (which doesn't have to be biological, but on Earth it often is) to sustain it in the presence of oxygen. Meteorites produce a tiny amount, but these are very tiny amounts that would be make methane at levels near impossible to detect even a few light years away, unless a giant meteor hit and created lots of methane, which would be mostly degraded within a millennium if it was a particularly large one.
Artificial plant meat that tastes like beef  If they do that this would be solved it just needs to be a little more known
An important factor that often doesn't get mentioned in this conversation: Economic bracket. Part of the reason why a lot of people don't switch to a vegetarian or vegan diet is, quite frankly, because it's simply too expensive. Because of lower nutrient density (and the need for frequently expensive supplements to replace nutrients ususally derived from meat), it's often more economically efficient to buy one burger patty that keeps you nourished all day, than a large pile of high-qualify vegetables that don't. Not to mention, besides the inefficiency inherent to buying a lot of expensive, low-nutrient plant-based foods, they tend to spoil extremely quickly, and not much money has been invested in developing (affordable) tech for preserving greens or other plant-based foods for longer periods of time. At the end of the day, whether we like it or not, humans are omnivorous, and we do require certain nutrients to survive. It is entirely tenable to eat a vegetarian or vegan diet with enough expensive dietary supplements and vitamins, and enough budget to buy the sheer quantity of fodder on a regular basis, but most people simply don't have that economic privilege. People don't just buy beef because they like it, they buy beef because they often don't know where their next meal is coming from, and they want to make their dollars stretch as far as possible while they have them. Speaking as someone who grew up at the bottom of the economic barrel, to whom hunger (and even sometimes a lack of consistent access to drinking water) was a daily part of childhood, the days we could afford to eat meat were the days when I could think clearly, and the days when I didn't go to bed so hungry I couldn't sleep. Telling poor people they need to save the planet by buying a whole lot of nutrient-light food they can't feasibly afford or store is always going to fall on deaf ears. If you want to fix the food emissions crisis, you have to fix the economic crisis first.

9:46 hmmm yes Helper T cell, my favorite food
Would love to see your take on lab-grown meat. As someone who loves a well made steak, I'm kinda hoping this will save my comfort food...
Excuse me, but this is just another Vegan propaganda video. You have comfortably ignored B-12 insufficiency and very serious dangers of Vegan and Vegeterian diets, the supplementary and medical costs to equalize the need if you don't eat red meat etc. So, this is highly biased and not scientific at all, sadly this is not the first time Kurzgesagt has done this. I loved this channel but because of this continous needless idiocy I am unusubbing from your channel. Yes, I am just one person and this is what I have chosen to do with this video. I hope you come to your senses one day. Take care.
Maybe that Vegan Teacher had a point...
I’ll stick with my yummy steaks
I'm not vegan but Peta is probably going to be super happy when they see this video
Climate agenda
Wished this video talked about the carbon footprint and emissions created by lab-grown meat.
Climate veganism/vegetarianism is just industrial gaslighting to push the problems away from them onto regular people. But really you can all shove it until you realize that nuclear energy is the only long term solution.
Ah, climate alarmists yet again making crazy demands of everybody to forestall some apocalyptic prediction that will never actually come to pass? I can't imagine any other branch of science still being propped up so hard after so many major failures.
you could also save co2 by not breathing, just saying... some things are not optional.  you cant even be vegan without vitamin supplements, its unnatural thats probably why a huge percentage of ppl quit it within two years. you can expell nature with the pitchfork it stubbornly returns. its not a binary proposition between zero meat and present day american levels anyways
Despite the fact that a vegan lifestyle has so many benefits in terms of the environment and ethics, it's still depressingly difficult to get people to adopt it. Animal products have been so normalized in society that many people wouldn't know what to do with themselves if they didn't consume them.
I recommend The Carnivore Diet by Shawn Baker ... Is going to change your life for good.. Life needs meat.
Yall could have said eating meat gives you cancer and burns away all happiness and makes the little baby Jesus cry. I'd still eat meat
Would be better if we all started eating bugs and leave the steaks and chicken for the rich people
You guys should do video about the corruption surrounding the windmill parks and the damage they do to nature
Sorry, but I couldn’t care even slightly how much emissions my food emits.
next is aquaculture please
비건들 발작버튼 눌렀네
Yes really bad
I think our issue with meat is the amount of it that we eat now days. Before slaughter houses and mass farming, eating meat was fairly rare, depending on where you lived. We use to have to hunt and trap our delicious friends, so we would eat mostly plants and vegetables, with meat here and there -- a few times a month, at best; we eat it 1-4 times a DAY.. Meat is important, no doubt -- our bodies aren't really built for eating meat in mass quantities, or built for daily meat consumption
The greatest lie in the fight for climate change is that individuals can change climate by changing their diets. We need to fix climate change but peoples diets wont change it, petitioning change in governmental policies will. Changing the diets of millions of people is unrealistic, but governments implementing change on a systematic level and forcing companies to alter their footprint can. Your diet wont change the climate but voting can. While you can change your diet to make yourself feel better, make sure your voting for people who will fight for actual changes to the carbon footprint.
I like this channel...It actually doesn't care about narratives. >> yay~   I hope we can all live by classical liberal tenants of truth seeking.
Being vegan isn't ever gonna save the planet. Period.
so the solution would be for cows to go extinct right?  it would reduce methane, and no trapping cows in cages instead of free fields, and no deforestation to make the farms
so, we're all screwed then.
I will say this. There is this paradox that says “How could you willingly eat meat if you love animals?” Well, how I see it, eating meat doesn’t make me not love animals, in fact, it makes me love animals more, as ironic as it sounds, and as cliche as it sounds, animals are wonderfully designed creatures. I just worry about the animal getting a quick, painless and humane death when they’re being prepared for meat. Obviously I don’t and won’t tolerate the abuse of any animals, but meat was made for us to eat. PETA is a bunch of hypocrites who kill animals themselves, yet they complain when you eat the meat of animals who were killed humanely? Bruh.
And the "why love meat" video?
It would be great if you could do a video on cultured meat, it seems like a great alternative that would keep everyone happy. Thanks!
Shame on you for hardly tackling the ethics of it (or the moral abomination carnism is.)  Inb4 reactionary radlibs or fascists have problems with something I say.
I love all these vids, but the "units switch" at 9:20 to 9:35 is pretty shady - remove 800B tons in ONE HUNDRED years compared to emitting 50B tons in ONE year.
I hope people take the chance to try vegan/vegetarian options they are really good and could help you to reduce your meat consumption.
No. much of cows foods is stuff like old bread, the inedible parts of plants, and as said in thw video, grass. Cows don't eat the human food often
Sounds like we need to kill all the cows. to eat them all. yeah. i definitely got the point.
I thought you were a place of actual science Kurzgesagt, has politics gotten to you too? This is incorrect and poorly done on the majority of points…You did lie to us after all
Shoot, I was busy prepping for tests and missed the previous video...Meat Love I think it's called? Is that taken down now?  Also, what about lab grown beef? Especially labs that are planning on using mostly renewables like hydro-power and solar? If that still produces some methane, can the building have methane scrubbers equipped like a lot of regulated Western factories have CO2 scrubbers? Thanks!
Kurzgesagt: "no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times everyday and never gets old" Teenage boys: ...
Hey! I liked the "Can you fix climate change by yourself" one! But. Sometimes I think that these climate change videos are sponsored by someone.  Energy, meat. And in every video you hide something important. In Energy video, for example, a very important topic of nuclear energy. Why? Because it is not beneficial for you? It's mostly EU's fault that nuclear energy is mocked nowadays and coal is used. Yes, Chernobyl. Yes, Fukushima. But first one was caused by the mere stupidity of people, who were in charge of safety, and the second one was caused by natural disaster.  It is very sad that people who rule the world are so idiotic. And I hoped that Kurzgesagt won't stick their noses into these topics! Or maybe made them more objective. I understand that you need to simplify things sometimes. But straight up not talking about something that necessary.  And meat video. Fruits and meat? What?! They have different storage conditions!  I don't say that climate change doesn't exist. But I think that you have some benefits of not spitting straight facts but reiterating some things so that some european green organizations will be fine with your agenda.  I understand that it sounds like a conspiracy but I need someone to explain me how the hell fruits are similar to meat :P
I'll keep hunting, killing, and eating meat.  This is my way of life and I won't change because some colonizing power wants me to change for their 'science'.
It doesn't  matter if it's bad or not. Because people generally don't decide to do or not to do something based on if it's good or bad.
I couldnt belive when Jeremy Clarkson said that for every avocado we drop the same contamination as a small car running for an entire year.
CO2 is plant food.
Humans consume, pollute and produce much more emissions during their lifetime than cows. It requires tens of cows and at least 10-20 thousands of meals to raise a human for 18 years. So, for the betterment of the planet I abandon beef and start eating humans. If you're truly worried about the climate change, you will too. When there are less people, we'll need much less cattle and farmland, saving the planet and biodiversity in the process. Veganism isn't enough, cannibalism is the answer!
Stonkssssssss
Kurzgesagt can truly make any subject interesting. Normally I enjoy the space-related videos the most, but this was surprisingly interesting. Good Work!
Woke up this morning it was a sunny beautiful day, than I had beefs for lunch and day got windy and started raining. I always regret eating beef when climate changes so badly 😔
I don't know, to me the answer looks like a pretty unambiguous "yes, meat is bad".   On a side note, this is a great breakdown of it. I was surprised to learn how small the relative carbon footprint from buying locally actually is.
funny how someone that rides their bicycle to work ends up burning way more calories then someone that drives. thus the person riding the bicycle gives off more carbon then someone that drives hahaha. this is especially true if the person that rides the bicycle eats a lot of meat.
What about sheep and goat? For instance in Middle East and Central Asia cows are rare. Main animals are sheep and goats.
I live in Turkey so i dont really have to care about my meat consumption because i cant eat it even if i want to
"no other bodily pleasure could be enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old" I feel bad for the guy who wrote that...
Comparing shipping to local transport and failing to mention that those shipped goods will also have to be transported locally on top of the shipping, but for the shipped goods this takes place at least twice, before departure and after arrival... Classic kurzgesagt.   And failing to re examine the nutrition-density-chart after going from worst case meat production to ideal meat production is also quite the "mistake". And I'd like to see the breakdown of those emission calculations, are you getting them from all the regular skewed sources where they do shit like just calculating the amount of water it takes to raise a cow, and then just assuming it is pumped out of our fresh water supply, ignoring the fact most of it is absorbed through grazing and that all but the water in the cow at the time of slaughter gets expelled right back into the ground when the cow urinates?  I could go on...
Humans breeding like rabbits nothing to do with it of course, let's blame the cows. By the way did anyone ever calculated how much methane vegans release? If anyone spent only a few minutes in the elevator with a vegan they instantly would realise cows and sheep aren't the worst polluters around.
Delicious and Thoughtful...!!! 👌
Bullshit. So when an avocado gets delivered from South America to Europe, it just teleports from the port into the store? Overseas produce still gets transported from shores into stores on trucks and and that produces as much or even more emissions ON TOP of those of the ships transporting them. I find it hard to believe that you just 'kinda missed' that bit. I call propaganda!
We should start commenting a "Dislike" comment so people can like it to count the dislikes because fuck youtube.
Time to invent vat grown burgers and steak. Sorted.
"Food Is Arguably The Best Thing About Being Alive"  Foodies : *Y E S*
skillshare commercial @ 10:30
9:33 I love this channel, but I have to say that graphic is somewhat misleading, because it's comparing 80 years vs 1 year. If you do the math, it comes out to 10 billion tonnes per year, or about 1/5 of our current emissions. Still quite a lot, though!
We could generally eat a lot less and be healthier. The only foods we can do that with is animal based because of their high nutritional value that allow us to not even need to eat that often. Besides, fasting in between is therapeutic. The problem is profits of the industry pushing packaged food consumption and the mentality of over-consumption by the modern society. Food that is not high in nutritional value like plant based and generally carbohydrate based leave you malnourished and always feeling hungry.
Why do the C02 emissions from food even matter? I thought there is a cycle in place: plants take C02 from the air to grow [-> animals eat the plants]-> humans eat that food with all the C02 -> the C02 comes back out of the human and ends up in earth and air (repeat). Should this not be considered entirely different from e.g. burning oil/coal taken from the earth and putting C02 is the air without taking it back out. I would really appreciate a good explanation or source on this!
You forgot about the part where there are alternatives to turn to Meat Analogues which are significantly eco-friendly compared to meat and still have the same taste and protein content in them. Including this information could've helped people who care about  our dear Earth transition to meat analogues. Maybe you can do a collaboration with any organization that produces Meat Analogues and give knowledge to the people that they need to work towards the solution to this very big part of the global-emissions problem.
Let's hear it for potatoes!
"A Kg of beef will keep you alive longer than a Kg of potatoes" First we don't eat in Kilos, but in calories. Second, protein is for the most part not turned to energy, but discarded through the kidneys.  Maybe you should have listened to Mic the vegan the two other times. Better yet, take him in or sth, he's got the science, which is what you care about, surely. Take a keto man too and they can battle it out. And that conclusion is terrible, what you must do is clear, give up meat (and dairy, eggs etc).
I'm watching this while eating a steack
Beef stonks
Can we just eat the leftist  that say meat is bad. ??
"Vegans of the world unite" Karl Veg
Oh I thought for a second you would tackle the issue with avocados. They use too much water.
Strangely enough seaweed cuts cow methane emissions.
Eating meat isn’t the only thing that can be done multiple times a day and that is enjoyable
8:55 That's bad.  0% of soy should go to products for human. Humans shouldn't consume soy in any way, its the worst thing in dietary trends since the industrial revolution, and accounts for a massive amount of heart diseases. Soy is useless for humans, so whats the problem ? give it all to cattle, so it can be made useful.
How many kilograms of potatoes do I need to eat to get the same amount of B12, for example, that I get from a kg of beef?  The answer is infinity of kilograms of potatoes. Beef is much MUCH more efficient and enviromentally friendly than any plant. By a factor of infinity.  There is a lot of misleading and just plain wrong info in this video. "Let's compare nutrients... for example calories". Calories are not nutrients.
7:58 pasture alone can't support the number of grassing cows, brazil: hold my immense amount of land, we can totally do it.
what about fish?
3:51 buying local food totally matters, its much harder for the international organizations behind the commerce to control you and what you do. People, buy local, they can ban meat all they want, you are directly buying it from farms, not from international commerce, they have no power over you or your local farm producer.  Always buy local food, its a political statement.
I tried vegan meatballs before and they were fire so I mean if we can do that with other meats I'm all for it
3:34 just 2 times worst vs meat being 2 times more dense, that's fair.
The majority of CO2 assesments for live stock don't take in consideration the many byproducts an animal has, which are currently essential components for a number of industries.  For instance blood (food, fertiliser, dyes, inks, laboratory equipment), the hide (leather, gelatin, adhesives), hoofs and bones (adhesives, fertiliser, pet food, plywood, glass, charcoal), hair (brushes, felt, textiles), manure (fertiliser, fuel), internal organs (medical gauze and materials, enzymes, hormones, instrument strings, vitamin tablets), and fat (cosmetic lotions, candles, detergents, fabric softeners, insulation, medicines, antifreeze, crayons, paint, deodorant).  I don't want this to sound like the above is a defence, like the video stated "it's complicated" and makes it very hard to ascertain the true carbon impact of a "steak" as it's linked/shared with so many other products.   We should all afterall strive to eat less carbon rich food, and reduce our environmental impact as much as practicable.
There are plenty of small mammals that emit less greenhouse gases and are more efficient to farm, such as capybara, agouti, nutria, coypu, bamboo rat, guinea pig, cane rat, dormouse... Also, insects are basically just land prawns.
Make a video on insect protein.
I wish they would have included something about lab grown meat
How can a meat from local farmer produce more CO2 than the meat that travel around the globe? Wtf
Methane is inevitable.  Meat or no meat.   Carb fermentation in our guts and later human poop produces methane too..   Pollution is inevitable. The best work around is space exploration for resources and living space.
The planet Terra is part of the Via Lactea. Terra orbits around the Sun, and the Solar activity is the main  driver of climate on Terra. All other planets in the solar system also seem to have some influence on climate on Terra. Why do humans think they can control solar activity? All we can do is find ways of producing food that are less polluting and harmful for other species, and capable to subsist climate changes. Are humans, the dominant species on this planet, willing to change to the primitive ways of life?  Hunter-gatherers' comunities were more sustainable, more "in tune" with the planet's resources, but their life was not so "comfortable". We are omnivorous, we get all nutrients our body needs from several sources. Our digestive systems are not adapted for strict herbivorous diets, in fact there is a lot of nutrients in plants we are unable to process. There are several studies showing children with strict vegetarian diets have nutrients' deficiencies, and in consequence, vision and immunological problems. What kind of life quality do we want for next generations?
Love how you tricked everyone with the first thumbnail then changed it I was so confused while looking for this video lol.
Kuetzgesagt: 1kg of meat will keep you alive longer than 1kg of potatoes Irish people: am i a joke to you?
All of these arguments regarding food are all balanced on top of the real issue.  Population.  There are FAR too many of us, and it's only going to get worse.  Reduce the population, and all the other graphs regarding climate change reduce drastically.
Here's an idea. Russia and canada have tons of land that too cold to grow crops why dont we try to genetically engineer plants that are more resistant to the cold
I watched this while eating a pb&j sandwich…  Am I helping?
Ummm 800 billion tonnes of CO2 over 100 years is 8 billion tonnes per year vs the 50 tonnes produced per year. So yes it would help but the summary is a little misleading. Makes look like it would solve the problem and it won't.
The tumbnail is changed
gfg
Pls comment guys
Meat Good.
I wonder how methane(ous) was the atmosphere at the times those huge dinosaurs roamed the planet 🤔
this is the final proof of evidence i need. I am going vegie. I enjoy meat but not that much so it's not a problem i think
a question about pollution cased by overseas transportation vs land transportation: according to the video, land transportation causes way more pollution compared to overseas. the thing is, that as far as I understand, the usage of overseas transportation of food only adds more steps and overall use of pollutant land transportation to complete the process of transporting the food (getting the food to the ships, loading it, unloading it, spreading it to the destinations...).  so, correct me if I'm wrong, as I understand, the reason that buying food that was transported overseas is more efficient is that it makes food that the process of producing it was the most ecologically efficient, accessible to more regions, and the ecological efficiency of the production transcends the inefficiency of land transportation?
didn't the dinosaurs endure a hotter climate than humans?
I was kind of hoping you would dive into the health effects of consuming beef like what does an adult that eats beef every day compare to someone who's vegan and gets their protein from somewhere else.
Please remove your video "Why Meat Is The Best Worst Thing" as it's very inaccurate and full of lies. Edit: this video is also full of inaccuracies and lies. Please remove it. Your sources aren't trustworthy.
SUMMARY: is meat really that bad? yes (but we won't ask to go vegan because that would be politically incorrect)
200 IQ: eat Clean Meat.  No cow farts, lands free, and i still eat my burger.
Cows also get fed plant waste people can't eat
As a vegan, I don’t try and evangelize veganism as much as I am concerned with people making more informed choices around food. You don’t have to be vegan to have a profound impact that helps our fragile planet. I celebrate anyone, vegan or not, if they make a change, no matter how little. Veganism isn’t the sole solution to helping our planet, but it is a solution nonetheless. Thank you to anyone who makes a change after seeing this video. ❤️🙏
I'm still eating my burger with a smile. :)
It's really nice to see a video that explains why eating meat isn't good for the environment without trying to guilt trip or villainize people who eat meat! That said, I feel like the new thumbnail undermines this a bit as it comes across much more aggressive and antagonistic towards meat eaters like me. I never would have clicked on this video, even as a long time viewer of the channel, had I only seen the current thumbnail.  Update: It seems they changed it back to the original thumbnail, neat
In case anyone needs it, the dislike count on this video as of 12-7-21 is 11.1k
When you dont like to drink water: vegan water.
Everything is complicated So that why Bagvatgita says do the right thing but sometimes use common sense because it's your life live it even if it is imperfect
Thanks... I'm a vegan now
I only chicken and goat as I am a indian
Ummmmmmm 😕 ok 🤕
Using an extension you can actually see the dislikes and rn the numbers are 284k likes and 10k dislikes, considering how heated these topics tend to get it's a surprisingly good ratio, proving yet again how good Kurzgesagt are at conveying info in a neutral way that will help people actually understand the topics.
weird hope i guess, they figured out how to grow REAL MEAT from animal cells (where it looks, tastes, feels like meat since it is) but it grows fully in a little bit less than a month and it barely has any co2 emissions.
THE NOSE 👃 WILL HIT THE FIRE 🔥
Why are you LYING 🤥 🔥
Thanks very informative
i will now stop eating
Is this video channel thumbnail really changed every few days? It keeps changing, I thought they were uploaded the same title video
The whole video parts from the false premise that CO2 is bad for Earth or life on Earth... Higher Co2 increases green areas, forests, fauna, fertile land, it even allows plants to survive in arid zones that wouldn't if CO2 levels were lower.
The problem is humanity produces more food than it really needs if we grew food based on necessity I imagine it would be a pretty big cut in carbon
Since Kurzgesagt produced so many videos on climate change a book on Climate change, just like one on the Immune would be awesome addition to Kurzgesagt viewers like me.
Wut, why did the cover photo switch to Meat Hate lol
The bottom line is you will never prevent climate change or stop global warming because in order to accomplish that you’d need to completely eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions, cut down the size of human populations(and they would), and force everyone to eat soylent green and recycled processed food. No farming, no meat, no cars, no planes, no space ships, no big industries. What they propose is to literally destroy civilization and subjugate you in the name of “saving the environment”. “You will own nothing and you will be happy”  But hey atleast you’ll have clean air….
Fantastic video talking about a really important topic. But your takeaway after watching this shouldn't be that veganism solves all problems if you really want to assume a diet that minimizes your impact on the enviroment just cutting meat out is not enough do your research on what specific foods are the least impactful.  Stuff like  avocados and palm oil for example have been linked to deforestation and water shortages.
I’m still gonna eat meat, and I’m fine with people being vegan, it’s just when they shove it in your face, that’s when I lose my cool
I prefer systematic solutions. Most people will not stop a habit or change their livestyle based on things told them on the Internet.  For example I wouldn't give up meat by myself, even if an army of troll vegans call me all kinds of mass murderer. But I wouldn't accept rapid changes forced on me and most of us think the same. It would be political suicide to force masses to a rapidly change their everyday lives. I eat meat every day, some days multiple times, although 80% of that is chicken, about 15% pork and the rest is beef or fish, and essentially no lamb, so I consider myself lucky. Anyway, a regulation of high-emission red meat production would be good start. Higher taxes, quality and efficiency regulations to make sure the animals produce way less greenhouse gases.  Also if people could and should be educated about something, it would be to stop wasting food. Earth would be a lot better place if people wouldn't throw away food, especially meat.
Interesting about the food to feed our meat. But the problem is human grade cereals is a higher quality than animals grade cereals (this is the same wheat by the way, not different kinds. Depending on the season depends on the protein and quality of the grain. And thus gets separated into what's deemed suitable for humans and what's not good enough so it goes to animals.) We would literally be throwing grain in the garbage if we didn't feed it to the animals as it doesn't meet the qualifications for human foods.
Didn't you post a video saying "We can't Stop the climate change because our choices don't matter as much as big company choices"?
That needs to be their catchphrase. "Well.. its complicated"
Humans are eating meat for almost half a million years, and all of the sudden within 30 years its bad..... But CO2 is NOT bad for climate. CO2 is basically plantfeed.
Channel is lobbied by vegans,how many vids to milk 🥛 out this anti meat agenda?
Conclusion of both video meat is bad
Emissions mean nothing compared to the Sun, when it comes to climate change.   Emissions just suck cuz pollution sucks - thats it.
Do a video on organ meats
Dislike.  What happened to you, Kurz?
I understand that cows were being used because they are an outlier, but this means that the argument is hugely slanted against meat because cows (particularly when poorly farmed) are literally multiple times worse than other meats such as pork and chicken. In truth, better farming practices can and will benefit the production of both meats and vegetables. With effective farming in place (or even just avoiding beef and lamb/mutton), meat becomes such a small problem in comparison to overpopulation, transport, and electricity that there are probably many places to look first if we want to become more sustainable.
If you want a better view about meat, find the channel What I've learned.
I think youve answered the question but also... Are vegan products that good?
Mmm... Ramsteak. Delicious.
WTF? :D You said that local food transport is much worse than ocean container ship... which is not true... There is multiple lies and one side said things, in total, this is not Kurzgesagt video, because it's not neutral... Bye, cancelling the follow (I like meat but I don't need meat to live).
Reducing the number of humans is the best way to reduce human footprint.
Eating insects is the future!
short answer : no long answer : no, unless you're one of the people that prefers to murder plants and cook those up instead
What about chickens it a good alternative?
Quit eating beans that should keep methane emissions down
This makes me really sad
take away is, the rich want you to eat bug protein while they keep their own private animal to eat. btw im 4 mins in and wont be suprised if they suggest eating  bug paste
Dislike Status: 10k (will update)
The real problem is that the world is far too overpopulated.
This video is so informative! But it's necessary to add that many of the cattle an meat produced word wilde is wasted. The FAO estimates that at least 30 percent of beef is wasted and its produced annually enough to feed 3 times whole global population, so it's being wasted a lot of food and people still are famished. This topic also implies a social change in consumption, consciousness, equity and equality in food distribution
Methane is an active greenhouse gas, co2 isnt...
Dislike button
I'm not willing to stop eating meat "because climate", nor do I think that it should be the first thing we focus on. Tackling "fast fashion" and consumerism (along with related pollution) would be my to-go before we start making people miserable by telling them meat is bad. We don't need gamer/youtuber merch, cheap chinesium crap that breaks in 5 minutes, stickers, wardrobes full of clothes we never wear, etc - but we DO need food! Let's tackle the useless crap first, THEN start looking for the boogie man in food.
why not just build these factories right in forest? Make a field combined with trees and grass and cows will still eat there. So absurd that big companies still cutting down so much trees just to make a slaughter house or barn
Is this from the same channel that was disparaging people taking action in their own lives to reduce carbon emissions just months ago?
Is fake beef any better than normal beef
Answer to question: NAH BRUH IT TASTE GOOD : )
But if we nuke asia and wipe half the population like thanos thats bad, okay
This channel is overtly pro-veganism. It's not the first time they call out animal products consumption, because they've been doing it for years.
I'm going to eat more steak. Thanks AOC.
Just a quick note here because people and the video get this wrong all the time: Cows don't fart, they belch!
This is my response after every of his videos well that sucks
Bullshit
Have you guys noticed they changed the thumbnail 😅
Wow what a piece of propaganda, for anyone that reads this please do your own research - cows are completely fine, and meat is great for your health (research the randle cycle).
Beef gang
Decapitate the technocrats!
I would never feel bad about eating beef when corn subsidies in my country cause corn to be grown for ethanol fuel in cars. Which is a net negative in energy production.
I eat both meat and plant or plant based meat because I am nomnomnomivore. Omnivore could not describe me LOL
Tbh Meat is good I love it but veggies are also good even if your a meat eater and you eat vegan food its actually delicious too!
A lot of things were not adressed here. First and foremost, animal meats are much much healthier for humans and most vegans cannot live healthy lives, even with supplements. Secondly, animal meats are about 5 times as nutrient dense as common carbohydrate foods such as rice and corn, and while it takes some 230L of water to produce a kilo of beef, it takes 90L of water to produce a kilo of rice. HOWEVER, since the nutricional value of rice is 5 times lower, you have to multiply by five to reach the same nutrient value as beef. Meaning that it actually takes 450L of water to produce rice which provides the same equivalent nutrition as a kg of beef. And while talking about water, beef and other sources of animal meats gets about 90+% of their water from greenwater (rain) while crops use 99% freshwater sources that humans need, making crops by far the biggest offender of water wastage. And, speaking of wastage, around 80% of all food waste in the world is fruits and vegetables, which produces far greater emissions of methane in landfills around the world. Also, when it comes to feed, most additional feed which is given to livestock comes from the inedible parts of plants we produce for humans. Of course, we are not giving the actuall corn to livestock, rather we give the cornhusks and such- meaning that these product come to use instead of, you guessed it, rotting in a landfill. And what about cow farts, are they really producing methane? No. They are upcyling it, it goes from the atmosphere, into grass, cow eats grass and release the methane, so its a circle but they arent producing any more methane. And this issue with releasing methane is combated by producing beef more and more efficiently, as we are already on the way to do. Its also calculated that the emissions from previously untouched wildlife herbivores were greater than todays level from livestock, meaning that even if we did replace the livestock with normal nature, we would have the same issue again.. and its really not an accurate image presented here regarding airable land, most land is not fit for crops, and so its a question of either having ruminace there or nothing at all, meaning we almost never choose between producing livestock or crops on a given location. Also, livestock provides 50% of all fertelizers in the world, and is the only organic source, so if we remove lifestock, we also remove organically grown crops, and have to increase our production of artificial fertalizers dramatically (which means more emissions). I want to end by bringing it back to my main point, human health. The nutrients found in animal product are almost impossible to replace, because most vitamins and minerals are only accessed by the body in certain forms, and many of which cannot be absorbed if coming through supplements or vegtables. Studies have also shown vegans to be 40% more suceptible to bone breakages also. There really isnt a lot going on for the vegan debate in my opinion, its detrimental to our health and the emissions discussion is not favouring it (livestock production keeps getting better and better as well) so yeah, eat more meat, be healty. I'll end on the note that the obesity issues in the whole world can be blamed on corn, fruits and vegetables, as the carbohydrats have infested every single product, making us fat and have killed us in the 10s or 100s of millions
Türkçe altyazı ne zaman geliyo beler
twisted facts that makes it look like industrial farming is better than local farming makes me not like this video, i don't actually think Kurzgesagt realize that, that is what it sounds like he is saying, but what ever, the point of it all is, the only reason we are destroying our planet is because big companies choose to do their business in a careless way and customers choose to support it.
Its sad that the only argument against vegetarianism i ever hear is "meat tastes nice". It's such a selfish way of thinking and i dont think its possible for every human to be vegetarian possibly ever because of this mindset.
to me this isnt even a question, climate change or not I morally chose not to eat animals I just love all animals  plus if its also good for the climate
This is why I only eat humans that like to eat meat. Those humans are not the healthiest stock to butcher and eat, but with every human that eats meat "because of the taste" eaten, we have one step done against climate change.  Start now, sharpen your knives and butcher some tasty meat eating humans!
have been waiting for this type of video for a long time! it is amazing that you focused on the environmental aspects here and have done it in the classic Kurzgesagt way with insane animations and graphics. Although I would like to note one key thing;  When it is mentioned that "Food is arguably the best thing about being alive." [which is not wrong by the way, food is amazing] however it is important to note that cows, pigs, fish, chicken etc are not 'food', 'they' are living beings with personalities, fears, feelings. I think this is what it boils down to for vegans, is that society has conditioned people to not question the norm and look at these animals as just products, when in fact they are not.
I love Potato's 😅    you?
Hi!! Can you please do a video in the uses of nanoengineering in warfare? It would be a real challenge and very fun to do!
The world can't be saved
I'm trying to do my part, eating less meat (cow's meat), but it's very hard, something all I wanna eat is a juicy red meat 😬
Meat tax needed. I love eating meat, but on a global scale, it’s too easy and cheap to produce because we employ such extractive and irresponsible methods of production. 2 generations ago, my grandparents ate meat once a week because it was so expensive. I think that is how it should be.  The tax could then be used to subsidise the dietary requirements of poorer communities as well as manage the deforestation issues.
Best video ending soo far.😁
So basically... Stop burning shit down and leave it alone  We could also invest in ways to turn already existing land that we use more fertile so that we can use it more efficiently rather than burning down forests and releasing CO² into the atmosphere.  We could also use waste food products more efficiently by turning it into compost, to use it as fertilizer to bring the land we're using back to life, and to make more soil to grow food on off-grou d.  Also, hydroponics. We could breed food crops that grow in water better.  This'll all take time, and some of it may not make much of a difference, but trying it and knowing how to do it is still important, and every little bit helps.
Fake propaganda, false science. Go have a chat with people who are closely connected to mother Earth. You don't want meat? Fine. You will have your reasons. Don't be telling others how they should eat. Happiness and health come first. I will take meat any day everyday. Without it this planet will have walking slaves around. Males and females becoming beta's. No sovereignty but sheep.  Probably the platform will block this comment.
“Is meat really bad?” The Vegan Teacher: This seems interesting
Yes it is bad, because unnecessary hurting sentient beings for your "tasty pleasure" is morally wrong. We as humans are better than that. Vegan btw
I don't hate meat. Meat is...meat. I just don't eat it. Why ? Because I don't think meat is supposed to go in the stomach, rather it's supposed to go 2 feet under ground level where it can rot safely without giving me colon cancer ... And I don't eat it because I don't want it . Like I said , meat is meat. Why not eat human flesh from humans that were fed in turn a so called varied diet of meat and vegs? Surely that meat would be ideal as fuel for meat eaters. Peace
It's time to eat Potatoes! 💪
Won’t be told what I can eat by no fuck.
If beef cost the same in America as it did in Europe and elsewhere people would eat even more chicken etc
A ship carrying both potatoes and beef has the same emission, a truck that carries potatoes meanwhile a truck that carries meat has the same carbon emission. The reality is carbon emmision is substantial because of production lines and facilities that processes everything from food, power,  and other services that all savor our desires and needs  (textile, tech,etc) . Its not the food source that is the problem and the  solution is not to hate meat and force yourself to go vegan but to lessen the CONSUMPTION of all sorts of products and invest more on things that actually give us something valuable, so as upholding INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY on every aspect  in society and on ourselves.   NASA website has a monitoring on carbon emmissions, everyone could also check it there.
No.
Since i prefer pork, I don’t really care about feef. I do wonder how expensive would it become to farm without animal fertilizer and being able to sell low grade crops as animal feed. Electricity is already peaking at 1000€ MWh, i suppose food is next.
This didn't even touch of fresh water consumption either....
Am I the only one to hear this key fact. By 2100 we will have reached out c02 emissions limit even we reduced our current output by 3/4. We are screwed... Just say it.
5:13 this is not how the greenhouse effect works. Great video nonetheless!
Thank you for reminding me I have some steaks in the fridge, cause I'm hungry right now !
When eating out I would have switched out beef for chicken and veggie alternative if they weren't always much more expensive when eating out. I don't get why veggie patties cost so much more than beef. When you think about it, it makes no sense. I'm talking, even just compressed veggie patties that are less processed/specialized still cost more than beef.
this sucks because beef is in mostly all my fav foods, but what sucks more is the fact we have a deadline of "2100" and the amount of land it takes to grown beef. so the question is, would i rather watch the world end eating a burger or would i rather learn to love something else and make sure im a part of the "we" who gifted earth onto future generations in a better state than we inherited. can i have one last burger and then stop?
YES it is.. At least for everyone involved..  The animals in the first place.. The earth maybe  but DEFINITELY ourselves of course too..
Don't eat meat while the rich make most of the CO2 pollution .. sure.. This video does neglect so many things and doesn't acknowledge that meat produces much less pollution decomposing than fruits and other non meat products. Food waste. Seriously people who are anti meat look at things in such a black and white way. But anyway i'm not giving up on meat even if it meants mass extinction, I would go to war for meat. Also how are you going to get the nutrients without meat, if you're not rich. So many problems with this.
I choose to continue eating beef and it wasnt a hard choice to make
Ah time to enjoy the vid with some burger and fries-- 😄
This video may crush my spirits. Before it does, I will enjoy the beginning fact. Yeah, eating and enjoying food, every single day, without it ever getting old, is pretty cool.
Great video. One missing aspect is the water management: how much water is needed for meat, and how much waste water it produces.
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old."  When a video starts with a sentence you don't agree with... or see a big problem in that. Imo the problem is, that most people eat stuff that is way too sweet, fatty, spicy, with flavor enhancers, etc. that it is like a drug too them, let them feel high, makes them addicted to it and let's them eat it way too often and much, so they get sick and overweight. When eating (imo) healthy food, you just eat to satisfy your needs maybe once a day or less. It becomes nothing special and is by far not the best thing in your life.. there is so much more.
This dude is so wrong, lmfao imagine arguing that CARGO SHIPS THE LARGEST FUEL BURNERS are the most efficient things; international commerce is the issue. This is propaganda.
burgers are worth more than preventing climate change
Would love to also hear about fishes and chicken
No
Does the amount of agricultural plants fed to animals you cite take into account that most of it are parts of the plant we humans cant/wont eat? Just wondering
I don't see how this is so controversial, people just don't want to sacrafice a fraction of their comfort for the sake of humanity's future.
Okay but now, i want to pin point some things; wich btw are not statements that are against veganism, but very interesting questions that must be adressed to know the guilt we must feel or change we must make:  1 it's known that vegan diet doesnt have all needed nutrients, you need to produce B12 suplements wich also liberate CO2 being an industrial process. 2 vegan diet relies in a very very diverse diet so you get all nutrients, considering countries like japan or korea where veggetables and fruit aren't cheap, how are we supposed to tell the general population to go vegan? Also how are all chain supplies need to be modified so there is a big variety of veggies?  3 now comes a very interesting opinion I've read: For centuries meat has been a luxury only the rich were able to get, now that meat is affordable to everyone, rich people say it's wrong and no one should eat it. This sentence has more meaning than just the classist thinking of the society we live in, but by knowing that LOTS of  poeple from countries that have famine depend on bushmeat and small fishing, how we dare telling them that is wrong?
rndians talk about how great they are because they dont eat beef, yet cows roam free and rndia is the biggest exporter of beef while lynching people in its own homeland for having beef lol.
Get some pork on your fork
Yo kill all the cows and then there will be no more global warming
Just learn how to make Indian food. You are good to go.
I’m curious about what the Kurzgesagt team might think of animal based biosequestration using techniques outlined in Alan Savory’s book “Holistic Management”. We are currently in our first year starting a regenerative farm in Nova Scotia. We raise KuneKune, a special kind of pig that eats grass, along with goats, chickens, guineas and tomatoes. We agree more people should eat less or no meat, especially in westernized countries. Anyway, we hope to capture a sizable amount of carbon by increasing diversity and total biomass on our land. Mechanical sequestration has seen limited success (to be fair it’s new technology) but we think farms like ours might be the ticket, or at least part of the puzzle. We would love to see a video on this subject. Keep up the great work!
Me (a vegetarian): exists  Other people: YoU dOn’T eAt MeAt?! WhY aRe YoU a VeGeTaRiAn?!  Me: All the reasons stated in this video + not wanting animals to be killed to make my food + health benefits of lower saturated fat + cholesterol and more vegetables in my diet.  But in all seriousness though, I don’t think that cutting out meat has to be all or nothing. I mean I could go vegan, but it would more severely limit where I could go out to eat and what I can buy at the grocery store. Because I still consume dairy and eggs, I’m not as green as I could be, but I am still proud that I am making choices to eat more ethnically, healthy, and sustainably. Cutting a bit back on your meat consumption, even if you don’t eliminate it from your diet completely can still have an impact, especially if you keep at it and help normalize it to the people around you. Just something to consider…
Somehow Indians knew that beef was the worst thing to eat, but not sure whether saying "BAN" out loud could help.
Fun fact: for the transport emissions your own transport has more effect than the whole transport chain before buying : you can better go to the supermarket by bicycle to get food from the other side of the world, than drive a car to the farmers market to get the same food grown locally.
tell that vegan to drink their vegan water and breath thier vegan air lol.
Good redemption after the last meat video, way better arguments
Animals don’t produce CO2.  They liberate it from plants that absorbed it to store energy from photosynthesis.  They’re using Carbon that’s already in the system. Fragmenting the problem only serves to fragment understanding. The ‘excess’ Carbon is in excess because we’re ripping it out of the ground and spewing it out of smoke stacks and exhaust pipes.
Reasons why im vegan xd
here's the thing the majority of the emissions are from methane .. .what are you going to do eradicate the cows? And if we do not and we also do not eat them their population will rise and emissions will rise ... so enjoy your beef its utter nonsense and extremely short sighted.
Anyone else confused as to what a carbon budget is?
so much disinformation its physically painful to watch
Give it up. Enjoy this century and let future generations to fix these problems. Not an ideal solutions, but look at China India and USA. You can't fix the problem, when the major poluters are led by stupid people.
This video makes me want to eat steak all the more.
Wouldn't that avocado on that ship have to be driven from the farm to, probably a wear house, then to the ship. Driven from the ship to another wearhouse and then go the stores? Which means it would spend more time in a truck than my carrot or beef from the farm down the road? Also the more inland you are the higher any imported item has to travel. I am not knowledgeable about any of the science but I feel like some thing were a little biased. Local food will have lower emissions.
I like the video but my conclusion is I will continue to be a carnivore, greens does not do anything for me.
“Grass fed beef would mean less beef”  Thin-walleted people eating grass-fed beef: “You don’t need to tell me twice!”
GO VEGAN!
That little bell sound when the ship transporting avocadoes departed at 4:23 is giving me hearts of iron IV flashbacks
I actually feel more connected to plants than animals. They give us oxygen, beauty and so many other things. That's why I only eat animal products. I find people that eat plants are immoral and evil.
I like all Kurzgesagt videos. They are so fun and interesting!!!!!
I thought I was avoiding eating beef because I'm broke, but now I can say that I'm avoiding beef because it's the most environmentally detrimental
*beef stonks*
I wonder if it is a coincidence that this video talks about the downside of meat and Bill Gates financing vegan products and this channel.  Also, was it a coincidence that this video was uploaded after we can't see the number of dislikes?
They changed the thumbnail from holy cow to hell cow, and it’s great
I buy whole beefs from a local rancher. The beefs are fully raised on food AND WATER from agricultural land assigned as pasture, land which cannot be turned to cropland logistically. Not only is this form of livestock production sustainable (does not depend on GMO monocrop byproducts which fuel the vast majority of food production), but it can also act as a carbon sink.  Buy local
Vegan donut!
Lets be honest here the number one green house gas emissions problem by humans is too many humans. Every climate change mitigation plan is just a bandage on the real problem. We use our technology to prevent all the natural means of control that nature would normally use to control our numbers.
i have something to say..   anything that is too much is bad.
I just want to say thank you. I appreciate that you cover controversial topics with as little bias as possible and explore both side of the topic at hand, I love watching your videos. Keep it up
"don't eat beef at home" is a great first step and super simple rule for wanting to change your diet to be more sustainable - I highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't know where to start
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old"             Uhhhhhh......
ROAD TO 20 MILLION LETS GOO
I love animals But I love them better on a plate.
0:00 you sure that’s the only one?
I've heard how taiwan is 'farming' beef indoor and recycles the methane gas as usable gas. how would emission look in such cases?
It's a bit hard to relate when they're talking about beef. How often do you eat beef in your life? And where do you live?  I barely have them once a month and I live in South East Asia. In term of meat, Chicken dominates our diet.
If everyone stopped eating meat, would we use the extra space for growing more plant-based foods to feed everyone instead?
It is so immoral that animal slaughter for human consumption is normalized.... Clearly today with technology we don't need to rely on meat. Slaughterhouses are hell made real. You can see it in documentaries like "Dominion, "Earthlings". Animals feel, they are like children, they are innocent, they do not deserve millions and millions and millions to be brutally and cruelly killed for pure human pleasure. Although unfortunately, we have been like this for a long time... the damage we have done is irreparable.
Well you guys clearly talked about "bad" in an inviromental sense. I think its time for the final step, "bad" in the moral sense. Is killing animals for food bad, philosophically speaking?
Ok that does it, I'm cutting beef out of my diet
Watched this at the drive through at McDonald's, ordered a chicken sandwich instead
Yeah, You go! Drop all those meats! Yeah, you should start eating only bugs and rice! Trust me, you'll love it when it's mandated for you! All this extra meat that's still getting raised *anyways*? Well, it's just more for the rest of us. Thanks for the bit of atmosphere. Breathing your own farts really saved some oxygen for the rest of us. Thanks for doing your part to better humanity by surrendering your life-force and thermodynamic energy fruitlessly! Those pats on the back really made the difference for humanity.
Hmmm two comments......avocados use a ton of water and chemicals to grow.... people in Mexico & south America have taken down huge amounts of trees and replaced them with avocados that are damaging ecosystem......the second is almonds....they are also extremely water intensive crop ...
Kudos for cutting through so many of the straw men in this subject. The only other things I would have added would be some mention of the huge amount of water used in animal agriculture, and how as more of the world becomes rich enough to buy meat the problem is likely increasing over time.
This is sort of skewed and you're only really discussing meat. A cow also contributes other products as well as chicken. The comparison should be with the total product of a cow or chicken, not just the meat. So this video is mostly true
Meat isn't bad, but 4 BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET SURE IS. Buffet restaurants are enablers.
Answer to title. In USA yes, because the beef in US is on anitbiotics and synthetic growth hormones. They banned use of hormones on poultry at least even though they still use antibiotics, why not on beef? They claim it's safe but scientists disagree, that's why synthetic hormones are banned in EU.

"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive."  Love him or hate him, he is spittin facts to us.
Cosome de pollos
Wow if this isn't one of the most biased videos on a subject Ive seen in a long time. Obvious why you didn't wanna "dive to deep". If the entire US went vegan  for a year it would only drop world emissions by 2.6%. but that completely unrealistic, if even 10% went vegan that's only a 0.26% drop. what you have here is basically the higher companies that actually cause high emission shifting the blame. and they using beef because its a big topic when it comes to considering how some of them are raised being considered animal cruelty so they using that as leverage to help back their agenda because they know most people wont actually read into it, most people just read the article headline and make and make a immediate assumption.
Still eating beef.
I could happily cut meat out, but the alternatives are either to pricey or doesn't taste/feel remotely the same, if I could afford it I'd change, but as it is, real meat is to readily available and cheap and easy to use
Would just like to point out, the intro premise is completely false. I hate eating, it's a chore, like doing the dishes. I'm healthy, not anorexic or anything like that, no eating disorders. I just don't enjoy food, ever lol (Includes sweets; even as a child I never cared for sweets, always ate spicy foods after school- like a jar of jalapenos or pepperoncini, or veggies like carrots, cucumber. I was a weird child)
8:14 beef stonks (nice they made a meme)
Meat is horrible but obviously human beings aren’t gonna suddenly stop, it’s virtually impossible with the economy and seven billion people. Meat is contributing to global warming, and there’s no stopping it. I don’t want to be that guy, but are we screwed?
This will solve itself. Just keep doing what you are told. You will be dead before you know it.  Dead is the most green state.
im really digging on all these new art styles and psychedelic mediums
Thank fuck this finally dropped I picked this topic for my exam and I was praying they would finish it before the week we started to write the essay
vegans probably hate ppl because they beat the meat. poor animals
I don't know a whole lot about this subject, but i'd like to see the data stacked with meat through hunting considered. I'm also a huge proponent of using insects as meat-substitute and would love to see a hypothetical future with that as the symbiotic solution to the meat problem.
Lmfao “eat less less beef and pay more taxes and we can change the weather”
Bruh people don't talk about going peskitarian enough imo. (Given the opportunity I would eat a mostly peskitarian diet just because I enjoy seafood more.)
Love your stuff don’t want to say your wrong because you put the effort in but for the cows that are eating grass does the grass that grow take in some carbon from the atmosphere so the methane gets taken out of the atmosphere then get absorbed back into the grass
If you're worried about carbon emmisions in a country like the UK you're insane. The UK emits only 1% of all manmade carbon emmisions and that is a miniscule fraction of what the ocean, volcanoes, and everything else on the planet creates. Anyone that works with growing vegetables knows that carbon dioxide speeds up the growth of the plant considerably and so will create more oxygen. Why don't environmentalists focus more on things that we can change that make an actual difference like pollution?
Good God, the sheer amount of stupidity in the first 35 seconds past the intro is deplorable. Plow by horse has no emissions. Transport by horse-drawn cart also has no emissions. Dried foods need no refrigeration. A suncooker has no emmissions. And the CO2 breathing by plants goes on whether it be a tree or a blade of grass. Just use compost- no need to mine rare materials for poison fertilizers. Kurzgesagt, Why do you take us for idiots and fools? You've been suckered by the green lobby and big tech and big food money. Instead of wasting carbon credits on more wasteful but shiny new "advanced tech" solutions, return to local farmsteading and ancient agriculture practices- far more productive than corporate monocultures and cramped feedlots. Support real green practices, not this fancy BS "Great Reset" that big tech and big food corporate monopolies are pushing.
I like the fact that they ended the video with letting us make the decision with the information presented
This channel teaches way better than school and I understand it way better
So the answer is basically yes.
I would love to see you do a video on different farming practices. A lot of food emissions issues can pretty directly be linked to modern farming vs small production, no-dig farming such as no-dig market gardens, front yard gardens, and permaculture. In these models, clearing of land isn't a part of the process because they encourage basically turning lawns into food sources. And they encourage farming to be self-sustaining process (re permaculture specifically) which cuts out emissions of typical modern farming upkeep like cultivation, fertilization and herbicide use, etc.  Re cow methane: adding kelp to their diets greatly reduces that emission source. Of course, other sustainable farming practices must be utilized on top of that, and over production must be greatly curbed - which is where changing our diets to very plant based comes in.
Damnit
So really, meat wouldn't have to totally disappear from our diets, just be reduced by a lot, or perhaps be synthetically produced? I dunno about you but that's not the most horrible way to go especially since while most plants have incomplete proteins some are complete sources of proteins and mixing and matching different plants can give us all the essential amino acids done correctly. Plus there's less saturated fat in plants - usually - which is better for us.
i myself will still eat meat tho, cutting our own  greenhouse gases can be done not just by eating less meat, but also can be done using EV, using less fossil fuel, turning off ac while we dont need it, going place to place with public transport, turning off the electricity while i dont need it, buying less unnecessary product, buying clothes in thrift shop, buying secondhand electronic and furniture stuffs, theres so many way to cut off our the greenhouse gas production, not only by eating less meat, not to mention eating less meat can cause specific nutrition deprivation such as iron, calcium, iodine, zinc, deficiency.  so enjoy your meat 🥩 🍖
Sucks but oh well, I'll still continue to eat meat. No amount of fake food that tries to be an alternative to meat and natural food will come close to the nutritional value that meat and natural food has.  I forsure will never subject myself to vegetarianism or veganism for the sake of "the greater good". Go ahead and eat your lab grown meat, impossible burgers, vegan alternatives and drinking your almond/oat/soy milk if it makes you feel better, which is fine because that's your choice for your own body. I'll still be happily eating my locally sourced organic beef, chicken, eggs and drinking raw milk like I have been everyday and will continue to do so for years to come, regardless of the climate situation. :D
How to buy things if companies some times lie about the production? Like shampoo manufacturers that say they not test on animals but actually they hire other companies to do so? How to buy locally? You know?
Vegan is stupid
I can only eat white meat 🤤 red meat causes flareups in my hs. Also great video!
No one gonna talk about how he said 800 billion in 100 years but we add 50billion per year…. The Uhh math there is uhhhhhhh
I grew up in the rural south of the US. Our neighbors all had animals, one man had cows, one raised chickens, another reared pigs and goats. They all also butchered their own meat. And everyone around the area had a small garden in their yard that grew zucchini, squash, tomatoes, potatoes, corn, etc. We got a lot of our meat and eggs from them. I wonder if raising your own helps lesson the carbon footprint in any meaningful way. I also realize I'm extremely privileged to have lived in a situation where all that was possible. Each family only had around 5-10 animals each, except the people who had chickens had about 20 chickens. I would love to see a video addressing if it's helpful to live like this and how it would affect the world population limit and carbon emissions.
I don't really think It was an honest depiction of the issue. Expecially when talking globally. The argomenti regarding transportatiom seem very hypoctitical , to cover the face that a conteiner ship burns tons of fuel in a single day ..... Last question .... Regarding crops and Soy ... Is the part that goes to animali edible by human? You didn't really make that distinxtion
Eat meat.
Don't care, I'm eating beef
think missing big picture answer. meat not bad. humans is bad. special listen all those evolution science vedios claim meat mad apes brain grow bigger make us who we are> then theory meat is important. I'm christians so don't meat make anyone brains bigger. real thing here is what country carry point? how many people can have and still have wild life and food production both plant foods and animals foods. quality people over quantity. people know do lot things. lot better some wants steal or ride on some els work.
Never heard of regenerative agriculture?
Ask Gretta, she knows everything till the World is screwed and we all die. Let the cows fart I say.
can you make a video about ancient Egyptians lives?
the problem is that it is easier to make meat taste good rather than plant based food
TLDR: Locally raised, rotationally grazed beef solves all of the issues presented in this video.   There are a couple flaws in the analysis: (1) The video discussed that the comparison of beef to plant foods needs to be based on more than weight, but they stoped at protein. What about amino acid profile, mineral content, essential fatty acid profile, etc? Their level of analysis here is too gross, not fine enough with regard to the subtleties of human nutrition. We, as humans, need more than just protein. (2) Grass-fed cattle needs to be differentiated into two categories: cattle stocked on land in the traditional fashion and rotationally grazed cattle. The latter allows for greater stocking densities on the same amount of land without external inputs. Though this method is not in wide use, it could be, and it offers additional nutritional and environmental benefits over the traditional method. Cattle raised in this manner mimic natural ruminant herds which facilitate the capture of carbon, the building of top soils, the reduction of run-off, and the building of biodiversity in the pasture. At the very least, an analysis should be performed between the most ideal cattle management systems and plant production systems with consideration towards a full nutritional profile, not just protein and environmental benefit, not just harm.   :
Wouldn't fruits and vegetables also have the same carbon footprint for transportation for the last mile? Those plants are getting on a truck just like the beef.
Why not just reduce the human population and then keep it capped at a sustainable level?
This is what I feel about Veganism, this debate, humanity as a whole, and these are my solutions.  I believe Veganism is a cult. Blindly worshiping animals & nature, prioritizing those over all else. It's not about diet, it's about saving animals & nature, even at the cost of humanity. Not just avoiding meat, and animal products like leather & gelatin.  To my knowledge, Veganism is realistically detrimental to the body, because of missing nutrients you can get from animals. And the raw-Vegan diet is even worse, because they don't even process or prepare those plants to make them more digestible, leading to them wasting away and dying faster.  And before any Vegan says, "There are supplements you can take,  there's algae that makes Vitamin B12" or whatever. Yeah, when poop hits the fan, harder than covid, Vegans will be in the same boat as Diabetics with insulin, needing to obtain some special, life or death thing, among the chaos.  Even if I can grow that algae, and whatever plant that provides nutrients easily obtained by eating animals. How do I obtain farmable versions or seeds of those plants, and how long will they take to grow?  I don't have my own home, let alone an offgrid home with a greenhouse and whatever the F is needed to grow algae.  Meanwhile, I can hunt, fish, and maybe grow some certain plants indoors.  I believe anyone who became a Vegan or Vegetarian for animal & nature reasons, are fools, because I realized, for humans to survive, let alone thrive and be happy, nature has to suffer, has to pay for it in some way.  Whether farming meat or plants, you're still taking that land from nature. Whether you live like the Amish, have an underground base, a houseboat, or underwater home, you are still taking that space from nature.  Whether it's engines or Electric Vehicles, we mess up the environment just finding, collecting, and refining the metals to make them. We're messing up the environment obtaining & burning fuels, messing up the environment obtaining, refining, and recycling battery, solar-panels, and wind-farm materials.  Do you all understand?  People just being alive, let alone comfortable, with modern conveniences & pleasures, all harms the environment.  We can try to reduce that harm, but it is a fools-errand to try to dramatically or completely reduce our effect on nature.  Maybe we can build cities & farms in more barren places, like deserts, the frozen poles, and floating cities, each in giant boxes, with air locks for doors, contained water, air, and waste treatment, these sealed off cities & farms, protecting the inhabitants from the conditions outside, and those same walls protecting nature from people.  But how many Fs will be given, to fund such cities & farms?  Also, Vegans & Vegetarians shouldn't feel so high & mighty not killing animals, because you are still killing plants. How do you know plants aren't sentient? How do you know they have no mouth but must scream?  Plants can't run, fight back, cry, or be "diplomatic". They defend themselves with chemical warfare.  We cook the crap out of them, to disable those toxins, and things like caffeine, meant to kill us like bugs, in low doses, we treat like stimulants, medicine, and seasoning. Poison go brrrrrr.  Think about it.  Other than salt, everything we eat, died for us to live. Blame nature or some deity, but be plant or animal, we must take lives, to sustain our own.  That is just the way it is.  The sooner you all accept this and everything else I said here, the better your lives will be. We can try to reduce our impact on nature, but, at the same time, not wreck ourselves to do so, or treat outer people so poorly for not being the lowest impact possible.  If they're not carelessly littering, or polluting a lake or river, leave them alone.  How "sinless" are you to judge anyone else? How much is your own life an impact on the environment?  Yes, I eat meat, I love motorcycles and motorsports, and battery tech. But I also do my best to mind my own business, treat others how I want to be treated, not litter, I recycle when convenient, especially if it's aluminum & glass, and I don't steal from, torment, violate, harm, kill, or war with innocent people, like the government does.
Aquaponics with freshwater prawns and a mineralized soil substrate capped with sand. Then turn the shrimp and plant waste into compost. Then add this compost to the substrate layer once a year or when needed. There will be plenty of nutrients for the plants and food for the shrimp.  Stop trying to be complicated. It's a waste of energy. Have a solar panel to run your one or two pumps. One pump system is easy to do. Then you can have a mushroom cave next to your aquaponics greenhouse, and don't forget the chickens. Problem solved. The secret key is your clay and mineralized soil, sand capped substrate.
Ayo what happened to the MEAT LOVE video? did Vegans took that down?
Alternative title:Is Skillshare Really that bad?
Mate that start just made me feel grateful for the fact I have access to this wonderful thing that I can’t get bored of and overlays my philosophical belief that pain and suffering is VERY important for a happy life
Animal haters.
Animals eat animals.
As a cattle producer and having been educated in proper grassland management I can confirm there is a load of misinformation in this video. With proper rotation of forage and grass you can gain almost a 90% grazing period per year. There is also major research being done on supplements for cattle and other ruminants that’s will greatly reduce methane, C02 and high urine concentrations. New Zealand has already done major studies to greatly reduce their emissions since sheep and cattle outnumber humans by an astronomical amount and have caused major issues with high urine concentrations.
Ecologist politicians are like this: 1) They forbid you to eat a burger. 2) They try to convince you that a plate of quinoa and khus khus is as good and tasty as a burger. 3) They eat the burger.
What about Humans producing Methane? And really fat people producing more?
Kinda suspicious that the claims he goes into detail about are all to disprove any pro-beef argument but when he covers wild claims like "a beef free diet would free up to 2 billion hectares of land, a vegan diet would save up to 3 billion hectares of land" there's no deep dive into the fact behind the claim. No sources, no explanation, etc. Also a lot of his arguments rely on having a large, advanced economy in a fully developed country. You can't have the majority of the world switch to a vegan diet and even if you could most of them wouldn't. Grass fed beef is fine but there are also reasons people have for eating grain fed beef. It's not like switching to grass fed beef is always the best option.
Thank you, you are amazing. i hope you know how far you are from anyone on YouTube. The diversity, the depth or’f research, and the animation that as so purposeful and worked on. From an old fan, thank you.
I will give an suggestion regarding to amazon protection; give 40 billion dollars PER MONTH for brazil so it get distributed as UBI among our population and i think we would be more willing to hear what opinions the international community have about what we should do with our territory.
That video was not entirely bad, but definitely misleading with how you presented things. What I've learned made a much better video than you on this topic in my opinion.  Also, you didn't cover nutrition, which I understand because it isn't the topic of the video, but you have to take into account that humans are naturally hypercarnivore omnivores and eating a mostly or entirely plant-based diet is not only not a good idea, but not viable long-term for different reasons (being always hungry, inevitable deficiencies, digestive issues, short term health issues, long term health issues from high carb diet or certain plant toxins like oxalates accumulating in the body, mental health issues, autoimmune disease caused by different plant toxins, etc.).   Some people manage to do it, but most do not. So IDK someone would recommend plant-based diets unless they were ignorant (most people are when it comes to nutrition) or they had an agenda.  Why do you think most people can't last more than a few years on a vegan diet? Why are there so many '' no longer vegan because my health failed me '' videos? We already know it's not viable.
This video is incredible. Well done.
This is bs. Cows dont add new co2 to the atmosphere, they recycle the carbon captured by plants.I dont know why there is so much nonsense about beef in particular, but it has nothing to do with climate change.
There are so many additional facts that this video just glazes over.  41% of agriculture is not used to feed animals because the animals only eat the waste product of that agriculture.  It's like saying that cows eat 90% of corn agriculture.  When really its us that only uses 10% of the plant and 90% is waste that an animal can eat.  Also since methane doesn't stay in the air indefinitely and comes down to enrich the soil eventually it is a cycle.  In the same way that we have the water cycle.  Also the North Americas had many millions of ruminant animals on the land before they were over hunted. And even so after all that we do have new ways of reducing methane emissions from grazing cattle.
Meat love to meat hate
beef stonks
I am getting sick and tired of vegan trying to push their stuff on us enough is enough
Vegan teacher is going to be ????????????
Gonna eat a steak now.
Video thumbnail was originally "Meat Love" with a heart-shaped eyes cow, lol
Go Vegan -> Cows go extinct -> Reforestation will still not happen.
This video would be 100% accurate if there was an actual thing the human race could do to prevent climate change. Millions of years of data tell us its earth's natural cycle so I really don't get the relevance of this video
As soon as vat-grown meat is a commercial thing, I'm switching to that. In the mean time, I'm going to make sure the meat already dead in the supermarkets doesn't go to waste.
And im still gonna enjoy my nuggets mald keep crying L
Most of the farmland in Brazil is being cutdown for soy, not beef.
So, the wistful joke, "A vegan will let you know they are a vegan at the earliest opportunity." has scientific merit. Fuck it, I am going Vegan.
Arabic language translation video pleased
I don’t want to see not one *do it fart* comment
Looks like i’ll keep hunting.  Still get to eat all the meat i want and don’t have to worry about contributing to farming.
Going vegan would be hard for the most people, and (arguably) not very healthy. But switching from beef to chicken and pork would make comparable impact on CO2 but much easy to do, and much easy to convince someone to do so.
I have not watched the video but i iusr wana say being vegan still makes you eat murder plants live wr yank them out of the ground
Genuine question: How much of the stuffs we fed to our pastures that are stuffs that are specifically grown for animal feed? I.e how much of them are byproducts of agriculture for human consumption?
Meat is a must in northern climate, thank you VERY much, you privileged Germans, but I'd rather both keep my vitamin D supplements and meat to see me through Russian winter. I wish we could have grass-fed beef in here at affordable price, though.
even if you don’t want to go vegan/vegetarian just cutting down on how much meat you eat can help your carbon footprint :)
Not in this car.
You didn't say anything about the fact that meat is necessary to our diet.
vegan: "How can you eat that!?" me: "Because it's well seasoned, well cooked, and it doesn't complain when I cut it." vegan: "That's a dead animal!" me: "Would you rather have me eat it alive?"
I watched this while eating steak. We are fucked
No
funny thing. this video was recomended me after i watch happy meat farms genome modifications
it is easy to choose the more expensive alternative if you are from the rich part of the world, but most people are poor.. Try to convince a family in the poorer parts of the world to choose the most expensive alternative. They are struggling hard enough to survive today, rather than worrying about future generations.
Globo Climate nazis won't have a nice future. First they removed people's ability to hunt their own food, then they removed people's ability to grow their own food, now they want to tax to death and even remove meat completely. All in the name of the invisible climate threat To them I say, start with lecturing Asia before even opening up on this topic, you damn megalomaniac hypocrites. It's always the west that pays the price while china gets richer breaking the rules we're forced to enforce so religiously.
Eating meat is a non-sense in 2021.
I have a very specific question for a video idea after watching the new King the moon episode. What would happen if the moon just suddenly popped out of existence, not blown up, not like it’s never been there, but if in the current day somehow just popped out of existence? What would happen to the earth, I know stuff with the tides would are you be all funky but other than that if the moon just suddenly disappeared what would happen on earth and/or will it have an effect on our orbit or affect the solar system at all?
Eat the bugs, live in the pods.
Is it just me or did he change the title screen to meat hate befor it was meat love whhhaaaat???
So, here in Brazil we are the worst for the enviroment, but most of our beef, pork, chicken and soy industries are for trading with the chinese, in this moment, there are people in the biggest beef productions states that are BUYING and eating bones, because meat is too expensive, what a irony!
They re growing Meat in laboratories you know that right
beef stonks was my favorite
Could you make a video about Electrical Money?  e.g Bitcoin, Crypto Coin
There is a main flaw with this video. Sure, beef pollutes much more than veggie alternatives but:  1. The quality of beef protein is by far superior to any veggie alternative. 2. Beef is efficient in terms of nutrients and calories. If you removed all cattle in the world you would end up using much more farmland to meet the nutritional needs of the population.
I'm intrigued. I am cutting down on my meat consumption because of stuff like this, however your argument about international avocados and local beef seems to be arguing apples and pears slightly. You speak about transporting avocados on container ships vs the local transport of meat. surely the international food has local transport at the start and at the end of its journey which will be at least as much as that of meat? It probably doesn't change the overall argument but I feel it is slightly misrepresentative of the transport situation. What do you think?
You could come out with a 100% undeniably correct study that says meat will kill you instantly after eating it and also whatever else you can gather about animal cruelty and my appetite would only increase.
04:42 is wrong. The 2.5kg only account for the ship, we are missing the 1970 truck from argentina that drives the animal to the butcher, another one that drives the meat to the ship and then a 3rd one that drives it to a storehouse where the 4th is coming in to distribute to the shops and finally we are driving our car to that shop to get it. local meat at least here in denmark means within 30km, thats not even close to 18kg. The true numbers are more like 10kg at max for local meat and 100+ for argentina shit.
In regards to transport, you made it sound as if transporting meat was just worse, when really you didn't mention that veggies also have to make the inefficient travel along land. What happens when the avocados reach the port, huh? Do we just all rush down there and eat them off the ship? Of course not. I find it hard to imagine that wasn't done on purpose as you've got around a 30 person team behind this channel and it's worrying to think that got past everybody involved.  It was recklessly misinformative at best and purposely deceitful at worst. I'm not claiming I'm an expert, and I think it'd be great if we all moved to plant-based diets. However, that was a truly poor segment of this video.
meat = pog master
I have suggestion be vegetarian
Kurzgesagt is a great channel, everyone no matter how good still has biases though. No dislike counter sucks.
Ahh yes, if we switched to grass fed we'd starve ahh. Only that's a gross misstatement. The real reason for factory farming is profit, not supply. Considering that an estimated 40% of food in the US gets wasted and considering normal distribution that would alone mean that a 70% drop wouldn't be that difficult to sustain. Furthermore, dairy and meat probably are wasted more than usual due to low shelf life and use in fast food industry.
Too bad even if every one who watched this video stopped eating meat it wouldn't change anything. Corporations cause over 70% of emissions. Don't let people tell you how to live. Eat your meat.
useless video... why do we have to decide
Why did the thumbnail change ?
In addition to the climate argument, one the other really important arguments for not eating meat (that is valid for most people with very few exceptions) is the fact that we have literally caused the killing/murder of a sentient being in order to satisfy our tastes for every meal in which we eat meat  - when we have the option not do so given that plant-based food is plentiful and people have survived on vegetarian / vegan diets for centuries.
no, i wont be a vegan
Anyone here after "Abhi and Niyu's" video ✌ btw the Animation and the Explosion in this video is soo smooth and clean ❤
Manipulative garbage. Cows are a normal part of the carbon cycle. The grass they eat takes CO2 out of the atmosphere to turn it into sugars. It doesn't come from space. Cows are just a replacement for the megafauna humans destroyed and the large herbivore herds they displaced and do not contribute to climate change. Human made climate change is 100% caused by burning fossil fuels which have been sequestered in the ground for millions of years and not at all from eating meat.  I am sick to fucking death of this misleading garbage which is pushed by vegetarian organizations and people like Bill Gates.
please do more vids about space
Kurzgesagt: is meat really that bad? Me: *no.*
I think that there are major problems that won't be solved by individual choice. There are a lot of vegetarians and vegans but they have not brought per capita meat consumption in the U.S. down to the level of 1960, which I'm told requires a 33% meat reduction by everyone. If there are beef subsidies then these taxpayers are making meat cheaper! Instead the subsidies need to be removed and a carbon tax put on livestock emissions. If you feed cattle the new seaweed derivative to reduce emissions then you should get a tax break.  Just saw there's a bacon double cheeseburger for $5. You can get a cooked steak for just under $20. Double the prices and see what happens.
A great follow up video to this would be a "population control measures to prevent climate change" with the pros and cons from a scientific view. I really enjoyed this video!
Wow
This is gabrage. CO2 empty agenda mixed with twisted truth. Problem is corporate capitalism and government's targeted unappriciation of agroculture. People flok to cities and barely anyone wants to work on the land because gov is making it difficult. While sports, acting, marketing and other bullshit shuffles billions. Wrong education, wrong values. Corporate lobbying. This video, man.
I feel ashamed of my country (Brazil) appearing like this in a Kurzgesagt video, politicians here are destroying our Amazonia.
you guys are great
Can you focus on more than just the environment?
No...nobody significant thinks meat is bad.
xD that thumbnail change
Animals can be carbon negative if they’re farmed properly!  Research holistic grazing 🐄🐖🐑🐓
It sucks that someone like Kurzgesagt has to cover a topic like this for people to listen. Earthling Ed has been talking about this for so long.
Energy production is the largest contributor to carbon emission. Much, much larger than agriculture, but yes, let's keep blaming people for eating meat.
Mark Rober talked about this in his impossible burger video... He said "Itd be so much better if we ate the food that we feed the cows ourselves" and that makes so much sense
Go vegan mthrfkrs
the only person i'll ever listen to when it comes to heated topics is kurzgesagt
Do a video on the boltzman-brain. I think it would be a really interesting video!
No
In addition to the effects of consuming animal products on climate change, you also shouldn't forget the ethical component :)
Capture the methane and cook on it.   How about that.
I want to say that this is a joke but... start eating humans ?
I don't agree with the way that you present the gas emission of maritim transport. You have to compare what is comparable. If we shop locally we will only have the ten last km that are surely a big problem, but I think that is less problematic than the sum of a maritim+terrian transports combined. Thus, the base of one kg of avocado isn't pertinent I think because the problem is do we really need to transport this ?
Hey stranger! Wanna get tricked?     Read More..
I hope Planet-X is a real thing so we can wave these people goodbye on their new Utopian Planet
2:42 i love meat... But its funny that the 2 lowest here are my favorites 🤣
Dislike
capitalism
Do you know here in India cow is worshipped like Goddess.We call cow Gau Mata(Mother Cow) and worship it.
Some people enjoy other pleasures multiple times a day
Yo not the thumbnail change 😭
there ware ways to do it and then there is the way that the US and a few other country's do it that dose not work, plus, meat from chickens for example has hardly any impact compared to beef, so the discussion can be a little more complex then just ''meat bad'' also, at least TRY a vegan patty at a burger joint, im not even a vegan, but i tried one and they are actually fine, they dont taste weird or icky, they taste pretty much just like beef. so just try it instead of throwing a fit about it.
Don't touch topics you don't research properly or go all the way through. Elephant in the room #1 is assuming all plant based food is automatically healthy, it's not and in some cases outright harmful (complex and complicated topic). You can't even compare using calories or nutrition value. Vegan diet is not sustainable health wise, at the very least it needs supplementation and you have to be mindful what you eat. #2 is mono culture agriculture depletes soil and not sustainable in the long run. Grazing ruminants restore the soil and have negative carbon footprint. There is more.
good video
No it is not really that bad, the only reason people think it is is because of the global warming hoax. The world isn't going to end if it gets a little bit warmer. Calm down people.  If climate change is the only argument you have against meat then you don't have any argument at all.
Hmmm... no mention of the cruel butchering of innocent sentient animals? Kinda should trump the first three points.
Just eat chicken
Dislikes
Garbage propaganda. Unsubscribed.
Let's not forget this topic still falls in the "consumerism of the rich" predating natural resources. Having multiple burgers in a typical American town is so different than a village in the middle of nowhere raising goats...
"MEAT SWEATS" 🍖
There is a very important point that I always bring up, and it's an ecological one. When energy goes up on the food chain, you loose 90% of it. So, when we use, let's say, 10 kg of cereal to feed a cow, we will only take the energy of 1 kg of it. That means feeding people with that cereal instead of using it to feed lifestock is way more efficient and is a better use of our resources when we think of lowering the land use, carbon emissions and shortening inequality, ideally.
You could show proof that people are putting fire in Amazonia for meat production. As far as I know, the climate and transport are terrible, with too many pests for cattle and terrible roads. My father's trucks already went there; the drivers wanted to know the place. The freight prices are terrible, the damage in trucks is too extensive, and many cattle would die in transport. Indigenous people act like pirates charging crazy fees even if the loading is good for them; I couldn't even imagine the price they would force you to pay if you had a cattle truck leaving there. This idea sounds like an exaggerated fantasy to me. It's way easier to believe that ONGs are putting fire to ease gold extraction as they did sometimes...
Meat is expensive and we eat it too much but banishing it is not the answer. This video skims off the topic just regurgitating the most common arguments from vegetarians, which I agree upon. Yet it completely ignores how useful meat is, and it's not only about the calories or the convenience or the taste. The actual usefulness. The only redeeming part of this video is the mention of the fact that 60% of the land used for cows is not suitable for any other purpose. Which puts things into perspective. As always the truth stands in the middle
SHUT UP
Imagine even having the thought that what humans have eaten most of for 99.9% of it's existence, could be "bad", and what we've eaten for less than 0.1% of our existence is "good".
“Chicken and Pork exclusively using feed crops” My people have you ever observed chickens and pigs? Maybe in farming matter they are fed with such food, but those animals eat everything, like EVERYTHING. My grandparents raise chickens,goats, pigs and rabbits for domestic consumption. You throw chickens a dead bird and they will fight who gets to eat it, some chicken has flesh showing? It is eating time then, the chicken will get eaten by the same chickens it has lived it’s entire life. Pigs eat everything, from bones, to meat, even stones.
To be honest, we know that beef is not efficient, but they're also much more nutritious than most of the plant based diets. + soy based products for humans are sub-optimised, especially for men  In the end, just eat meat more casually, less beef, more chicken and we good
some hypocrites protest about climate change then eat beaf the next day
i'll eat                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  .
There's also the ethics of it. Kinda wish you didn't just gloss over that.
what about beyond-meat i tried it once in a subway sandwich and i would never be able to tell the difference between real meat
Honestly I feel like the idea of carbon footprint or footprints basically, isn't the right approach to solve climate change problems. Infact people are using it for blame game rather than finding the suitable solution. Eliminating anything which has a  higher carbon footprint isn't always gonna give a good result because everything is very interconnected. We need to have a balance than completely stopping eating meat.
The land restoration bit is a pipe dream. There's no way that land is going back to forests.
Can you burn the methane from the atmosphere?
Western media keeps preaching not eating meat to save the planet while people in China not giving a damn and continue to produce one third of the world carbon emssion.
kurzgesagat taught me alot of things I din't know
the title is wrong, the question is not if meat is bad or not, the question is how much r we willing to destroy, and how many animals r we ok with torturing to eat the meat.
I would love to eat more vegan food, but it's priced like saucy gold nuggets.
Watched whole video and not once it was mentioned the pain that those animals has to go through. It is unwatchable. I only hope those animals that are tortured were in their previous life meat eaters. I hate meat eaters so much if someone dies due to any reason like flood or corona i just want to know if they eat meat and if they did i feel happy that they died.
Doesn't matter as halal people will only want halal meat
The way I understand it is that the major driving factor of emissions is more on the growing global population. So if population decline emissions from meat and vegan diets would decline drastically?
No matter how deep their arguments about meats contributing to the carbon emission, the total carbon emission byproducts of conventional modern transportation from your private cars, motorcycles etc contribute nearly quadruple the amount (you can search the internet or do your own research). So, an average meat eater that walks more or uses public transportation still contributes less to the global carbon emission, than vegans that drives a lot. These examples aren't actually relevant, but food is a basic human need, and you really need those proteins, vitamin Ds, calciums, etc. You may argue some sources like soy, however these requires more amount to give the same amount of protein that livestocks (or animals in general) give. However, changing your lifestyles a bit can help to reduce carbon emissions rather than merely stop eating meat. Walking or using public transportations to reduce the carbon emission (if possible for reasonable distance), reducing the usage of air conditioners and other CFC products etc, using renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels, and so much more. Veganism is a choice, if you don't want to eat meat, then I respect your preference. However if you force other people to be vegetarians too, we'll going to fight against you. However with all that said, please spread love
I sometimes wonder if a mcdonalds or burger king just swapped their burger patties for meat free ones would people even notice?
I love beef 😋
Everything in this video is what I've heard vegans saying for decades.
"The best beef is worse than the worse plant" - Kurzgesagt
eating is so boring tho and takes too long
Ah yes, the old “only vegans eat avocados so let’s compare them to beef” argument. Lulz foh with that bullshite
It strikes me as odd to forget that as a species, humans do not inherently have dominion over any animals - we can survive and thrive on a plant-based diet, we can co-exist with other species and not exploit them for their skin, their flesh, their bones or anything about their reproductive systems. Morally, we should adopt a plant-based food system and move away from the continual exploitation of animals on land or in the sea.  There are also many ways to grow crops, away from the typical mono-culture styles of farming found in the west. Agri-forestry and similar styles of Hegel-Culture are available to grow co-growth plants which foster a great relationship of edible and non-edible food systems to humans, whilst providing a habitat for other creatures to be sustained within, and which promotes diversity in ecosystems.  All the information is available out there, we just need to look beyond 'traditional' colonial methods of exploitation and universality to systems solutions
Anyone else catch the weird framing? Comparing the 800 Billion tonnes to the "small" ~50 Billion tonnes? "800 billion removed over 100 years, versus 50 billion produced per year". Ok so that's 5,000 Billion we would produce over the same period of time. More than 6x what would get saved.
So most of the emissions from beef comes from the farted methane, but the methane is from the digestion of the grass and then transform to CO2, that same grass which grows from CO2! So those "emission" had to already be in the atmosphere before the grass could grow and be eaten by the cow, it cannot contribute to any "additional" warming like fossil fuel.  How can they pass over something so simple?
What are some good vegetarian dishes?
There is allso the clean water that we need to feed for  animals.
I expected something about health, got stuff about climate change. Utterly disappointed... But I guess that's the propaganda these days.
I ain't ever goin Vegan!
So, if i don't eat cereal but do eat chicken I should be neutral on the cereal production front? I can do that if i means I can still eat chicken
Sam from Lotr once said: "what we needs a few good potatoes.. boil-em, mash-em, stick em in a stew." :)
Am I losing my mind or did this used to have a different thumbnail/title? Did I imagine that?
Talking in terms of ''burgers'' and ''potatoes'' is oversimplification of the apparently complex subject.  A big portion of the protein you digest is metabolised by the brain so it can function properly. Everyone can calculate how much protein they need daily of course containing essential aminoacids because you walk with a calculator in your pocket. After you're done calculate your carbon footprint. Show me results.
im a heavy gym goer, if i need energy meat is the way, if i need protein, meat is the way, plants digest horribly for me, and i know if i switch to a plant only diet ill be malnourished in alot of ways, so no thanks ill stick to meat and dairy

Just curious, if impossible meat or lab grown meat becomes successful and everyone adopts, would that be enough to lower the greenhouse effect or would the impossible meat  production replace that?
Nicely indirectly replying to the what I've Learnt video on meat 📸.  But it's so easy and convenient to eat meat.

Beef is trash.  Let's re-forest the lands and go back to eating venison.

Well. the thing with every video this channel does on neutrition is not properly researched
When shipping avocados from another country to you locally doesn't take into account the cost of also transporting those products from the container ship on land. You should add that to the cost, although it seems to be pretty efficient overall.
Bolsonaro implicitamente mencionado no vídeo do Kurzgegsagt, o imbecil ataca novamente. Bolsonaro (president of Brazil) implicity mensioned in the vídeo, the idiot strikes again.
I get your point of the video but can you next episode focus on other animals? Because everyone just brings up beef, what about chicken
we are cucks
it astonishes me to know that the people offended by this video care about satisfying there taste buds more than they care about earth's existence or even their own existence.
I actually made the choice recently to stop buying beef. It’s a lot easier than you think. The other meat choices require less water per lbs than beef. Besides, there is a lot of option to substitute beef and you can easily get creative. I believe it all begins with the individual to save the future of our planet

An epic video as always. Thanks a lot for the video!
Consuming meat permits humans to exist.  Humans who don't eat meat do not develop right.  Look at any vegan or vegetarian.  Not going to watch the rest of this video, because it seems highly likely to say many more extremely stupid things.
Ordinary omnivores claims:: You cant get required proteins and vitamins without eating meat. Meanwhile some born vegeterians:: maths prodigy Srinivas Ramanujan, Vishwamitra, Aryabhatta, Sushrut, and Charak..
in a way transportation cost is very important, as (I live in France) a beef raised in Venezuela will not have the same carbon impact, protein richness or even human impact than one raised in France  when you see cattle feeding in mountains with vast food sources, you know they will not really feed from soy or other plants, except maybe on harsh winters  what I see now is an unbelievable amount of wasted food, people buying a lot without consuming it. I think just by removing this waste, without even lowering our consumption we would already enormously down the production  if 50% of the produced food is wasted and you remove all wastes, you can reduce to half your production without any impact on your population confort
Eating meat is bullshit. Every veg food is super nutritious. I belong to a vegeterian family, never touched meat, Im fine and healthy as any other man.
The entire video is a masterpiece animated!       Great job👍
you tricked me i thought this was a new vidio
Going meat-free will, simply put, kill me. Slowly. If I don't eat meat at least once every few days my stomach stops functioning. Like, literally. I stop defecating, and whatever wheat I ate begins to slowly ferment and cause me all sorts of discomfort, I feel weak and hungry all the time. Tomatos help a little bit, for some reason. You know what, it sucks to realize that I'm causing global issues simply by not dying off.
Man those ancient indian are intelligent than nowdays people... they worshipped cows and many others and promoted veg diet...  Did namaste than shaking hands
eat bugs live in a pod don't have children take the vaccine you'll own nothing and be happy.
L - WIG
Meat should be banned entirely. Have some humanity for those poor animals
Can't believe people are so mad for killing others that they are getting offended over a video.
I feel the biggest solution  for this problem is to teach people how to cook tasty vegan recipes like in India, where the veg food is so tasty that even non veg ppl rarely eat meat. MOST PEOPLE DONT CARE ABOUT ENVIRONMENT OR ANIMAL TORTURE, THEY JUST WANT TO SATISFY TASTE BUDS.
Bullshit
Statistics regarding emissions due to packaging and transportation may be right but considering the quality of meat which has been sourced locally (12-24 hours)as compared to meat which has been treated to have an increased shelf life to withstand all that transport (30-45 days) will surely not be as healthy as locally sourced meat.   We definitely need to think Local going forward.
This guy teaches more better than my school bruh
I'd love to also have this compared to lab grown meat since we are pretty close to deploying it reliably. It would remove all the methane from the equation.
"Well, not really if you look at all the information we omitted, but we hope you'll feel bad about it anyways."
While the information used in the video is based in empirical and objective data, the presentation shows some personal biases on the author/producer's side. The most direct example would be the frame comparing one data on a 100 year scale (800 billion) to a single year scale (50 billion), that is a very common tactic used to misrepresent data while technically not being wrong. If memory serves me right, Kurzgesagt themselves (or another educational youtuber, I forget) made a video about how this kind of propaganda-esque techniques are used to mislead the audience. But I guess since the intentions here are noble, we should be okay with a little propaganda and misleading comparisons? /s
I recommend checking out What I've Learned's videos on meat. Me and some of my friends only eat meat, and we have never felt so good as we do now! I recommend this to everyone who has health issues caused by overweight and inflammation from sugar and nasty vegan food filled with soy and artificial fats from seeds.
This started to be biased when it said it has "controverse arguments" but does not tell about them
So obviously, the greatest impact in the environment is reducing the consumers. PLEASE HAVE LESS CHILDREN
Of course, man-made "climate change" is a hoax, so all the concerns of "emissions" covered in this propaganda video are of course irrelevant.
Why is no one talking about killing living organisms , does other life not matter given we have vareity of options ! ?
What about "Clean Meat" ? ( Meat for consumption produced as a cell culture of animal cells rather than from the slaughter of animals ? ) I am surprised that "Kurzgasegt" didn't even mention this alternative way of meat production..
In a nutshell, what "In a Nutshell" is blatantly trying to avoid saying is this : Stop the wishful thinking ! You cannot keep eating meat, and still believe that the impact of its production on the environment can be minimal..
Я тут один русский)
Last time I did go for a walk and there was a beautiful grassland with a bull standing there all alone, so I jumped over the fence and did bite him to death and eat em all up, it was so yummy.
Hey Kurzgesagt, I love you but someone has to do it Dislike
Animation: Good  Narrator voice: Perfect   …        Topic and information: *sad*
i wish this had delved into the ethical aspect, but i guess that's harder to approach and more philosophical than looking at studies and meta analysies.
Nice to see Kurzgesagt animating Mongolian Gers.
There's also regenerative agriculture and soil depletion from mono-crop agriculture.
Thank you for this video. Please also cover the health impacts of meat eating on our bodies.
Allen Savory Method. Capture the C02 back into the soil using ruminant herd animals. Both pro meat and pro climate. Amazing TED Talk
It sounds like to stop climate change  is to stop eating.
Conclusion we are fucked
4:50 but what about transport from ship to store?
Don't eat beef!
I am sure there can be other ways to carb carbon release than discriminate food and manipulating animals
simply worst bulshit video ever seen ... simply advertising factory produsction of meat and other thing ... also factory produced mead is 0 quality and will not eat ... u cant call that food
Is that video supposed to make me feel bad while eating meat ?! LOL I don’t give a damn about humanity or future humans anyway
Meat is also good for your body
did u incorperate thatfuel for ships on the open sea is way worse then gas or petrol?
Can anyone PLEASE write korean cc here?? Or, Kurzgesagt, can you?
as a hindu it feels great that we  arent much of a  factor on global warming.
Proud to be a vegitarian 😌
I don't think we need beef so much.. I love meet but I can live without beef. We need cows for milk and cheese mostly.. However! Not growing cows wouldn't solve problem anyway even if all the people would become vegans. Solution is absolutely different I'm sure
I would love to see a video about veggie patties and other alternatives. Because, as for me, it doesn't really matter, if it made out of meat, if it's still tastes like meat
You have MISSED THE KEY POINT again!!!  Methane is the major source of animal emissions... Fact.  Methane is a short lived GHG, generally in the atmosphere for 9-12 years... Fact. If ruminant animals numbers have NOT increased over the last 9-12 years the NET affect of methane on global warming is ZERO... Fact. You are willingly misleading people, extremely disappointed by this channel. You have a responsibility to be fair and honest when you have the size of audience you have.
I don't trust this channel. Aren't they German? And aren't the Germans suppressing their people right now?
Did you change the thumnail and title?
what about fish?
Not what I wanted to hear, but it will definitely have an impact on how I do grocery shopping.
Wow, you really did it. You said it how it is…..The mob won’t be happy 😅
Finally Kurzgesagt starts making sense on climate change. This way we're giving bad habits less and less ground they can flourish in, and a really big change is due in the horizon.
Don’t care. still not eating bugs over meat
We live too long expressed on a graph of exponential poverty as we fuck with safety nets. Imagine if it were a wild animal or a 'state'  we would shoot it and by precedents invade ourselves.. x
Aww, no Pillars of Eternity chaos cow god reference!
I would love to see a follow up video on the new "man made" meat they are starting to produce in laboratories
The change of the thumbnail is disturbing. 😳
Still better than Tofu.
I don't care if it's bad I'll still eat it cuzz I'm a bad dude
Begining of the video: "The answer is that it's complicated."  End of the video: "The answer is yes - nothing complicated about it at all."
This had most of the content I was wanting in the original video about veganism / meat based diets. Thanks very much for the video, I know a lot of people might hate to be told they're doing something wrong, but the truth is the truth, and the truth is that we could be doing better. Much love guys / gals.
no its not. and even if it is i will eat it anyway....i am carnivore 100%
I would love to see a video on Seafood. If it's from a sustainably managed fish population, can seafood be a better solution, climate wise, to meat? I would think so.
go vegan guys
The fact that there is somehow 2 thumbnails for this video makes it amazing.
How can you blame the meat consumption when it's clearly the human methods who are the problem? I've seen fat people at McDonald's who order too much pollute the environment but I've never seen a lion or a honey badger pollute the environment and they eat tons of meat.
In a nutshell, it is complicated and not just black and white
I personally think that it would be possible to eat meat without as many ethical concerns. People just grow meat in a very unethical way. For example, cows should NOT be fed soy. And if everyone would become vegan, then people would eat lots of soy, which would require more rainforests to be burned. I think cows should be fed local food, instead of food farmed in places that were rainforests.
You should have titled this "Meat Really Is That Bad." As you showed, it's really not a question.
We should have a video on chicken and pork
Beautifully assembled info! <3 Thank yoou
Considering all humans give up meat, poultry and dairy (since all 3 requires animals). Real question is would our farms produce enough to feed all population and some surplus? Since this will require us to cultivate more land, may be cut down more forest, plus get rid of plant based waste after we harvest would impact earth equally bad?
No, it tastes really good.
I live in Canada which is an American country, and there is lots of cows here. We don't need to import beef from the Yankees or any other American country..
Krzgesagt what do you think about Biofuel as ecologic or pro climate change fuel? That could be interesting topic.
Just make chicken and other dishes more popular through a huge marketing campaign and CO2 emissions will drop. Hire top chefs to show off non beef dishes. People would still eat beef but would be less inclined to subconsciously
Meat is murder.
Maybe vegan teacher is not that bad...
Well you should also cover the topic of manure. If we want to keep growing crops we need nutrients. Either by manure or fertilizier. And its already in discussion of why fertilizer is bad.
I watched the video, and you never really touched on nutritional value. Yes meat = higher carbon emissions, but it also provides nutrients in a far more dense form than plants do. You get way more vitamins and nutrients from 1 kilogram of meat than you do from 1 kilogram of plants, and it's easier for your body to process too
Mark my words, one day eating meat will be illegal.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day, and never gets old" I feel like this is bait...
Don't forget that even just reducing meat intake can help a ton, you don't have to cut out meat completely.  Just make 1 meal (or 1 day) a week meat-free. It's a tiny change that will encourage you to try new recipes (and find new favorite meals!). You'll also get a better idea of how difficult it  would be for you to reduce meat intake even more or to go full v*gan. Some people will find it extremely hard - they'll miss the taste too much, or not find good recipes. But I just didnt buy' meat at the grocery store, then did it again. All the sudden it had been 3 weeks without meat and I barely cared. Ribs and bacon were the only things I missed. 2 years later and then bacon didn't even taste good anymore.   My #1 advice for people is to search for recipes that sound fun/good. There's so many new foods and meals to make that it can keep your meat-cravings busy for months.
oh... It looks like they got some bogus sources on this one...  Cow farts??? We may aswell cease to exist, because we fart and generate methane... Its almost as if they dont know how certain biological circles work...
The fact that Kurzgesagt never looks at the food waste caused in the western countries especially their Germany shows the hate boner they have for meat
This might be a misconception, but I've read that it's mostly cow burps that produce methane and not cow farts.
We should only let rich people eat meat poor people like us we can eat green stuff and starches.
Ohh the cow farts again! Not buying it!
people being stuck at work all day is also better for climate change than people being allowed to roam and do what they want, by the same logic provided in the video.
better thumbnail, much more serious, and drawing than the cow with heart eyes lmao
I'd rather have an apocalypse than everyone be vegan.
"Meat is bad for the environment. See, look at the worst example we could find."
I'm sorry I can't go vegan steak,chicken and pork are bomb I can't just stop sorry
This is a video I appreciate the dislike button being disabled on
Hey, i have a question. If we were to put all boats on the planet on the water all at the same time, what would happen? Nothing? Or would water levels rise?
I don't like your bill gates boot licking. End the privatization of seeds
I feel like these type of things we run into loops because we always find a way to "do this without affecting that". So what if just quit the whole thing? It's very hard i know, but "small things matter" doesn't always work, you take big steps in some problems you have to solve really.
Kurzgesagt saying "there's controversy about how bad this is and we don't want to dive in too  deep here" hurt me so much as a person who has before thought that Kurzgesagt was always the content creators that always tried their absolute hardest to get to the bottom of controversial issues regardless of how hard it was to research. I am not saying that I dislike the content by any means and will continue to watch, comment like and share your content of course, whoever that was a change from your usual character and it took me by surprise, with love and respect of course
What about synthetic meat
Yes
i'm glad as a vegetarian :)
I wanna be good… but I love meat so much
Your carbon footprint would be a lot smaller if you just //died//
People in the US consume the most beef per capita. So, whatever you want to do with your diet, make it stay in your country.
Fun Fact. Americas corn crops produce more O2 for the atmosphere then the entire rain forest
In this video: a well thought out and compelling discussion on an important topic. The comment section: oonga boonga meat good leaf bad
The video makes it seem like they're comparing least-efficient transportation of meat vs. only the most efficient part of the transportation of plants? Meat is also put on container ships, and vegetables also have to go through "last-mile" delivery...  Also, no mention of the methane cycle (that methane goes up and down and stays constant, and has since before modern factory farming and matches the methane in circulation from natural herd sizes, and herd sizes are not increasing and have been pretty stable), and the video pretends that cattle and other agricultural animals are eating human-suitable food--they're actually primarily eating waste that is human-inedible (e.g., corn husks, plant talks, and food not considered attractive enough to bring to market).  Ignoring the fact that we have a huge food waste problem, that our systems of agriculture necessarily produce plant products that are inedible to us but edible to agricultural animals, and that these animals turn that byproduct into super nutrient-dense food is frankly disingenuous and disappointing.  Animal products are absolutely a key part of the path towards efficiently feeding the world. Our food-waste is a much more serious issue, and improving our food waste habits would go a huge way towards decreasing the inefficiency of cattle.
Cows produce meat? And then barely talked about milk? Per value a single cow produces so much more and much less waste than any potatoes would bring in equal weight
This video is food processing company propaganda
I watched this while eating wings
Still eating steak soy cucks
Next on Kurzgesagt: Would you eat laboratory grown meat?
You guys should do a vid on quantum entanglement and or the difference/significance of 1-3 dimensions and the 4th Dimension
What about cultured or lab-grown meat and milk? I'm sure that method would cut out most of the emissions  (not to mention ethical issues) associated with animal farming
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old"     *OH ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT*
you can tell the bias pushed on this video.
i yall vegan yes you hate it
did the thumbnail just change?
80% of methane emissions from cattle are by burping.  Emissions from the other end are no different than from other animals including humans.
Unfortunately, us vegans are always right! lol
The essential problem is that there are FAR FAR too many humans living on the planet.  Migration of humans from places with low per capita carbon outputs to places with high per capita carbon outputs only causes more harm to the environment.
It seems a big disingenuous to include deforestation in a product’s CO2 emission
You cam be a vegetarian if you want, but don't get mad at people who eat meat. We need to for iron and other protines. Meat and vegetables together is a good meal. So back off meat haters.
This episode missed a lot more factors like meats dominating market (chicken), impact of fishing  and feeding omnivorous pets. Still a great step 👏
No other pleasure is done 3 times a day? Have you tried Crack cocaine?
You mean, kill and devour living things down our trouth* and burn by our stomach acid?!
they should do a video which expands on their nuke the moon and all nukes videos where what happens if we detonate every nuke in the world on the moon
Guys im gonna explain this simply. No, we are omnivores and if anything more carnivore than herb. Get over it, animals kill animals. We are animals. Therefor we can kill animals and eat them just like theyd do us.
Whelp I’ve been ignoring the evidence long enough, I think it’s time to reduce my animal product consumption. It’s gonna be hard to leave a lot of my comfort foods and I might not manage to go full vegan due to health concerns, but I hope others will join me in doing our best to reduce where we can. If methane has such a short lifetime in the atmosphere I hope reducing cattle farming can be a relatively quick way to combat climate change in the near future,
Ive had some plant based "meats", I liked them. I'm willing to make the change and only eat true meat on occasion, but unfortunately I'm not the buyer of my household (they refuse to eat much of anything that is plant based meat) and its unreasonably expensive from what I've heard unfortunately
I saw that skillshare ad coming miles away.
I’m sorry. But no one in my lifetime is convincing me to not to eat meat. My survival is more important to me. Not stopping because of emissions.
I'm disappointed that you completely excluded agricultural waste being included in animal feed. Cows take the useless chaff, wheat stalks and other by-products we can't use and recycle them into nutritious protein.
Really from what i got from this vid is to cut out beef and lamb which one person doing this wouldnt make much difference and it would suck to cut out steaks and burgers, but really if beef and lamb is cut from the menu carbon emissions from food will plummet, then we can move on to the transportation
I think what we need is less humans 😉
9:23 This is really disingenuous. You just compared 100 years of CO2 reduction to 1 year of CO2 production.
Great video, but this only made me want to eat more meat now, because it is cheaper right now, later people will ban it's mass production and the price will rise, so just eat more meat now while you still can.
Meat really is that bad.  Ditch it and come eat more beans, lentils, whole grains, vegetables, etc. It's easier than you think.
We should eat all cow
:0
If we weren't meant to eat animals, why are they made out of food?
Wait did peta takedown old thumbnail of this video?
ahh so plant based food is only transported by boat?
I use a extension to see the dislikes  Current likes: 272K Current dislike: 10K
Why not become Piscivorous like me💪😤📈 fish power!
Did they...did they just change thumbnail from Meat Love to Meat Hate? A cow with hearts in its eyes to a purple one with devil horns? Someone tell me I'm not imagining this. Edit: 2 months later and they changed it back!
I hunt for my meat.  Eat lower carbon footprint than anyone who buys rabbit food at the store.
Current dislike ratio at December 6th, 2 AM UTC time: 96.2%
I feel like all this really comes down to how much you hate humanity.  If you love humanity, then providing food for them is a given and we are willing to make compromises to feed people.  But we all get this vicious vibe from liberals lately, this self loathing "humans should all die, we are a virus, we are hurting the earth and for that we must suffer"....thing.  It really disgusts me, to be totally honest. I've lived in California my whole life, and for the last 6 years in San Francisco, and I am totally sick of liberals at this point.  They are forgetting what makes us human, they are only looking for problems to focus on, and they seem to hate humans.    I believe humans are worth it. I think we need to focus on humans first, and then gently control our effect on the environment without panicking.  Similar to what happened in the book the 3 body problem.  When they freaked out and caused human suffering in order to save the planet, eventually things got so bad they had to stop doing that and snapped back to taking care of both humans and the environment, they found balance.  Right now liberals seem willing to kill off most of the population just to "save the earth."    But the earth never cared.  The earth never asked to be saved. That's what makes the whole thing such fucking bullshit. The earth has had dramatic climate change in the past (think ice age) that had nothing to do with human activity and caused mass extinctions, but the earth moved on and evolution just produced new species, and it was all the same to the universe.    So we cannot forget that we only "care" because we are human.  So hating humanity while "caring" about this earth is literally moronic hahaha.  We only "care" because we have guilt complexes and consciouses, things imbedded in us from religion, our cultures, etc.  So basically I think we should just fucking relax.  The entire climate change thing is just a case of mass paranoia and fear for the future.  I think we need to first deal with our spiritual lackings before we try to deal with any other problems.  Deal with ourselves first, then try to help others.    Because right now we are all just fear mongering, "oh my god, the world is going to end unless we do something."  But I say, are we even capable of enjoying that life we are trying so hard to extend?  Are we spreading love in the world, are we united, are we at peace?  No, most decidedly not.  We fight and strive to save things we don't even like or love.  We need to work on that way before we give a damn about the fucking planet.
If I can get a chance, I would like to eat Impossible Food's Veggie burger
Suffering is bad, so yes.
I think this is far more complex then this short video can provide. As an example, if you eat very low carb (keto or carnivore) you will likely eat much much less.  Also, we would need to talk honestly about food nutrition, metabolic health issues, etc...  there are a lot of variables to be considered and calculated.  To figure out this topic perfectly would be like calculating weather daily with 100% accuracy.
Really the only way i can think of to reduce climate change is to simply stop making more people for a good long time. In my personal opinion there are 20 times more people than there already should be.
I absolutely love this channel and you guys are amazing and extremely informative. I do have one question about this video though. Why is the chart comparison for CO2 removal shown as 100 years vs one year instead of a straight one to one ratio?
Glad I love pork the most, then chicken, then beef :D
Vegan teacher NEEDS to watch this   GOD GAVE US COWS FOR MEAT AND MILK
This video has 10329 dislikes
I just realized I wasn't subscribed and I've been watching him for 2 years 😐
More grossly inaccurate anti farming climate change lies.   Forcing everyone to be a vegetarian will not trim emissions.  All feed crops that feed livestock feed humans.  You don't want agriculture land to be put back into grasslands or to grow vegetables, you want that land so you can stack solar panels on it to power your mega cities.  Those mega cities that produce all of the worlds emissions.
No meat Monday’s is a baby step to eating less meat in my diet, plus it cuts back on my overall grocery cost for the week. 😄
The real halal meat is the safest
There's no proof to any of this
Just another one of your videos implying humans are superior
WRONG! Plenty of people are overweight and food is a necessity, not a luxury. You might as well claim breathing is the most pleasurable thing about being alive.
Im still up for the safe and efficient production of insects for protein and nutrient dense foods. The main hurdle is cultural influence as most of western culture is disgusted by the mere concept of eating insects even if they are grown cleanly and cooked and prepared properly. If we can turn them into powder or additive to otherwise vegan foods that has them unrecognizable as insects and with acceptible taste we could get a jump on it (obviously labeled as such and not decieving people). I get that its hard to make marketable though because well... bugs.
“is beef bad?” “well, its complicated.” 10 minutes later: “okay, so its not complicated at all and beef is pretty much the worst no matter from which angle we look at it. its just that humans are egoistical hypocrites”
Lmaoooo suddenly they say being vegan is better when in their previous video about a year ago they said we should continue eating meat because it TaStEs GoOd 🙄🤡🤡
I'm confused 1 kg of beaf emitts 71 kg of co2, I'm confused, do they mean something else by this statement
Olha o Brasil decidindo o futuro do mundo!!! ( Da pior maneira possível...)
100% wrong. We are in a CO2 deficit. Without substantial CO2, CO2 can't bond with moisture in the air to create rain. Thus increasing the chance of forest fires. So like in California. The rainfall will reduce. Dry spells will increase. The forestry becomes flammable. And you get massive forest fires. But by that point the moisture in the air will not be sufficient and will not occur.
Here's what I want to do with this information. The whole business about your 'personal carbon footprint' was invented and pushed on the public by oil companies. It's total nonsense. Individuals can't do squat. If government, industry, and other powerful interests won't or can't, and they won't, we're all screwed. I'm going to go eat a couple burgers.
It's interesting that the video didn't go all the way to project the impact of hypothetically switching all human food from a mix of meat and vegetables, to an all vegan diet. The amount of nutrients and calories are still needed, and given that vegan diets are not as bionutrient as meat based diets, we could end up consuming much more carbon than what we are consuming today. You guys need to create a follow up video that goes into an item 4 that covers this topic, or else you are presenting an incomplete argument.
Why did Ludwig's stream get taken down for watching this?
How are we doing with that seaweed feed that helps reduce methane emissions from cows? Did we ever manage to scale it up?
Meh, Since Governments get's a blind eye, and companies just get a finger wave and then both get praised to say sweet nothings. Meanwhile people gets the entire book thrown and inject Doomsday non-stop. I can't take the whole climate change seriously enough to change anymore.
Replace red meats like beef and pork etc with poultry like turkey and chicken. Eat red meats sparingly. Eat more seafood and nuts etc. Your plate should be mostly grain, sauces, veggies etc. Not only does this dramatically cut back your contribution to climate change it dramatically improves your health as red meats are confirmed for Americans terrible heart health as well as Italians.
Actually it is not complicated.  Carnivorous animals - digestive system 4x body length herbivorous animals - digestive system  15x body length Guess what? Humans - digestive system 15x body length  We are not designed to eat meat. You have been fooled every bite of meat you eat is contributing to your ill health and polluting the earth in many ways.
This is an issue that probably will never be solved in my lifetime.
Did this video get updated from is meat really that good? I swear I saw that and a more positive thumbnail. Just curious
Goat milk>>
A half-hearted and biased attempt to please the planet destroyers aka vegans. Spreading misinformation by withholding various other facts pertaining to water and waste management involved in the production.
And technically where you buy your food does not matter because stuff is already on the shelves 🤣
To be honest things in earths history have raised and fallen from themselves changing there environment.  We can't stop the world from changing all we can do is change with it
I'll eat vegie burgers when they cost less than real beef.
Its not about eating meat or being vegan, it is and will always be about money. You can research all you want watch all this videos educate yourself, fight other people for thinking different than you but money will win everytime. This video serves no purpose to the problem other than inform you but thats it. After the video ends you go back to your life and the industry just gets bigger and bigger, sadly the people who can make the change love money more than anything on earth so they will sink everyone and then blame it on you for buying their products and people will fight one another for the blame but will never realise the blame was always on the rich and powerfull.
Every Kurzgesagt video in a nutshell: It's complicated and we don't know for sure. But here's a cute animation.
OK. But water vapor has still has much more stronger green house effect. Show me a full climate model. Do not explain by only one paramtere. Why I can not find a full detailed climate video?
you guys should make a video on fish and the effects of the fishing industry on climate change
Something important that most people seem to forget is that for thousands of years most humans didn't have the opportunity to eat meat every day or even week. Only the rich and wealthy had this luxury, but your normal average Joe didn't have enough animals on his farm to eat meat with nhis family every day, nor could they afford to buy the meat/animals reguarly.
dislike
🥩 beef 🥩  But does that account for the whole cow where no part goes to waste or is it assuming we only consume beef and throw everything away?
I literally had to pause this 1/2 way thru to go buy and cook a big ribeye.    Now… (happily chew chew chewing) what were you saying?
So we're fucked? Nice.
Can you please talk about CO2 cleaning technology.
Dude, pop off with these videos goddamn!
For all who don't give a shit about the environment anyways, at least consider knowing where the mmeat you buy comes from and how the lives of those animals were. If you can't support the environment, at least support meat that didn't have to suffer as much as the most ones you'll find in the store.
I went vegan 5 years ago and i honestly dont miss the meat at all. I think the vegan food (when done right) is better.
I kind of want to know what an explosion containing all the uranium in the galaxy or observable universe
No pls dont be vegan  I hate vegans
Isn't it interesting how selfish humans are that after seeing unquestionnable evidence of meat(specially beef) being horrible for the planet and for humanity, AND being convinced by it, people STILL will not change. Switching to beef once a week max and eating stuff like chicken more frequently to compensate if you don't wanna be vegetarian is already a huge improvement (and it's usually cheaper!), and it's asking *so* little of someone. Literally the most impactful day-to-day life change anyone can make. And trust me when you reduce your consumption you actually start enjoying it way more, it becomes a real treat!
Yes it is. If you are fine with lower strength, cancer risk increase, and a shite storm of other stuff then I'm not judging people have been eating animals for a very long time. The performance boost you can get from plants is really good. Just wanna see you be the best version of yourselves brahs
I live right next to nuclear power plant, I don't travel at all, and work from home. Still I love beef and as cooking is one of my most favorite hobbies I would never stop eating it.
it feels that title should say beef not meat, becuse other meat types are not explained in depth here, as from the graph it looks like its enough to eliminate beef and almb for huge change, i prefer chicken anyway XD and then when advancments come we;l just grow meat in labs anyway :)
This channel is very biased, this is like the 3rd video against meat/dairy and Im tired of it. I'm unsubing.
The fundamental  arguments  you make are flawed, man made carbon has virtually  no impact on global  warming and our government 's know it. Earth's climate  is controlled  by our star,a fact acknowledged by scientists across all sectors but suppressed  by government  and commercial interests who prefer  we are kept ignorant  of reality.  The aim being to exercise utter control  over our every thought  and action,the greatest threat humans present to the planet  is pollution in the form of plastics,chemicals  and radioactivity. Even these will abate fairly soon after our demise, so in the meantime  let's not be ruled by lies and propaganda acting in the interests  of the few against the wellbeing  of the many.
All those extra vegetables you'd be eating in place of all the other food you're taking away, would need to be farmed somewhere and a lot more than what it is producing and farming at the moment. You did not account for the increase there, which is always neglected. Also a neglected to touch on the topic for hydroponics, as other commenters have mentioned below. And to top it off, it is still highly debated whether a vegan diet is truly healthy over many years... keeping it all balanced well it's difficult; There is always a change in body - I don't just refer to losing some weight. Not to mention the controversy over artificial meat being unhealthy, as well.  This was a highly biased video that did not explore all the options and weight everything out to it's fullest extent.
Anyone notice how he kinda just skipped over the CO2 emission of meat, literally just saying CO2 equivalent, I get that methane does a lot, but it’s best to mention it as it’s own issue, rather than just skimping on that very important fact in order to push a narrative. Thaaaaank you
There is misinfo going on in this vid. Save the old growth trees please.
Congrats on trending!
so how much did they pay u to promote a vegan propaganda thats what we all really wanna know
Glad I live in Wyoming in the mountains where we grass feed cattle. My conscience is clear
Stopping meat production would be disastrous for humanity. This channel's creators are smart enough to know it too. Why the dodging of those points?
Just another stupid push for total vegan but they don't know every years farmer from agriculture countries burns more forest land to make room for farm land in order to feed the rich countries , you haven't seen people burned straw every season , that crap is harmful af ....
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day..."  0:03  *14yrs boys* "..."
Go eat your cringe soilent green ill be grilling
The thing about vegetable transportation is that they still go by truck after they get to the port, noone buys produce directly from the port
Cows use unedible parts of plants lowering foods waste,  in Taiwan thrown away food is used  to feed pigs . Animal feces are used to create manure and help to grow crops .
I feel like the main problem is overconsumption
0:04 No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day? Ohohohooooo you're so wrong about that
ok lets eat some hamburguer with beef.
smart meal planning will solve this issue. just plan to eat a fully vegetarian meal or snack a day. thatll do your cholesterol big and you get your 5 a day. and itll save the environment since you wont be contributing to the 1kg beef transmission by doing so
just got your book "immune". this might be the first time I got rl merch and I don't regret it.
i'm supposed to give up meat to "save the planet" while the top 1% cause 99% of all emissions, fuck that we going down together.
just ridding the fast food processed meats is the big focus. its so wasteful. most use beef burgers.
i will eat meat until i die
This comment section is 1st world countries in nutshell to be honest. Filled with entitlement and arrogance. All the world can go to hell just for their sensory pleasures. Nothing has destroyed the world like developed nations and their consumption.
Eat your bug protein and live in your pods.
whole load of bullshyt, veganism is bad for the climate. the reason all these people have low testesterone is because they are not including nutrient dense high quality animal products in their diet only processed plants full of pesticides which leads them to severe vitamin & mineral deficincies like anemia
This video is full of relentless propaganda such as local production being bad, or worse than mass produced grains or vegetables
The climate has always been changing. The models so not work going backwards, nor forward, which means we dont know if human impact of CO2 production is the most signifigant factor in the dynamic climate of earth. Possibly the sun itself is a larger factor. There have been hotter times on the planet and colder, before human industrialization.  We should focus on true pollution that is poisoning us and all life like industrial and agricultural run off which have been largely ignored as big money would prefer we look the other way.
You're selling the veggie patty plus skill share. A double sales video🤔🤔
Lawl,screw that noise. I'll start taking cow farts seriously once china and other third world nations get reigned in to near to zero emissions. This is the same thing they where screaming in the 80s-90s, that they'd be "acid rain" daily and people wouldn't be able to survive outside without a hazmat suit by 2020.....guess what....it was a lie....and still is.....  This is to bring in a carbon tax to tax the poors to death and get more power and monies for the elite ruling classes that can easily afford any such fines.
It's kind of deceptive to compare CO2/KG of protein between meat and potato's. If you eat 100g of meat in a day, this provides roughly 25g of protein. If you would want to get the same amount of protein eating potato's you would need to eat more than 1KG of potato's, which doesn't make any sense. Hence this is a stupid comparison. And this is essentially the whole point of meat; cows, from this perspective, are just a way to concentrate protein. The cow can easily eat multiple KGs of food a day, extract the nutrients, and store (part of) them. This helps us because it means that we do not have to eat 5KGs of vegetables a day to get enough protein.
Why do I feel like this timing is impeccable ???
We need to make lab grown meat the norm. Make it tastier and crash the farming market.
this means vegans are good and None Vegans are bad??
I love meat
People say people like me "are just lazy" and "don't care what happens" and I guess, in a way, you could say the latter is true, in a sort because the reason I'm not hopping my ass up to _"sAvE tHe PlAnEt"_ is because I believe God is going to make whatever's supposed to happen, happen. His will for out great green rock, is already set in place whether some of us want to accept it or not. And before you even think about saying "gOd IsN't ReAl" or "tHaT's PlAiN sTuPiD" save it. If that's what you want to believe, I can't stop you. Go ahead, get out there and do what you think is right, just leave me out. We both have our opinions and this is perfectly fine.
So if my math is correct, if everyone was vegan, we still wouldn't be breaking even on yearly CO2 equivalent emissions? ((800B / 100Yr = 8B) < ~5B). Really showcases the magnitude of change required to turn the climate crisis around. Do you have a video on the remaining (non-food) sources of emissions?
I'm vegetarian for environmental reasons and have been for about 3 years. I've never found such a nice succinct source supporting it.   I wish this video could be turned into a fact sheet to carry with me for when people ask.
Well, you're all screwed then. I'll be keeping my beef/lamb/pork/chicken foodstuff thanks....
As some who grows cattle and grain, I simply would like to point out that manure is the single most important thing in this topic. As an organic farm we have totally cut down fertilizers, this has decreased not only our CO2, but also how we effect the local area: fields, marshes, surrounding forests and different water sources. We have been able to do this without loosing a lot of proficency because of MANURE, its a great, organic fertilizer that doesnt damage nature. Instead of focusing on farming, we should focus on other areas when fighting climate change, that are not as important to our health and overall survival
BEEF STONKS
When you said that half of all cereals are fed to livestock, you’re forgetting that we actually can’t eat most of the plant, and that is the part that is fed to livestock
I can conclude that pasta is the Food of the future and barrilla is going for world conquest
Wasn't this video called meat love before? What happened?
thumbnail used to be a cow with heart eyes  haha
I have a realy weird question. Could humanity colonise the sun?
0:04 mmmmmmmpryess 'X' to *_DOUBT_*
There is no ethical consumption under capitalism. Stop framing it around individual choice when it is clearly about decisions made on a larger scale.
Nice way to make people feel guilty of something absolutely normal... if we apply this theory to everything in life, we will end up living in caves, naked etc 😂 can you use the same logic for all the technology equipment that you used to create this video and shared with the world ?
use this comment as a dislike no hate to kurgesagt great channel
I will switch to a veggie patty if it tastes good, like the ones I saw in videos but that are absent in my country. Here I can get those ate 4x the price of a very good meat. Not switching for the foreseeable future.
Red meat is the healthiest thing you could eat. And more meat, high quality that is being consumed by more people is better for the planet. Please don’t listen to these soy boys, pushing soy sludge, fake meat and plants. They know nothing about nutrition or digestion.
ive noticed the thumb nail change
After watching this I’m convinced that raising/eating animals for food will become illegal in the future
This video blantly states that we are 100% doomed
I don't voluntarily eat beef, but I love eating other meats. As much as I love meat, I would drop it all if lab-grown meat was a thing that was more available.
holy mosly the ship transport emission stat was mind boggling
Can't we find a way to somehow put the cows in a big building that store the methane and turn it into something else or store it?
This was incredibly well researched and produced 👑
The only nutrients that matter are apparently just protein and calories? Lol what a garbage video. The guy who runs this channel has obviously gone vegan.
Wild meat is the healthiest food available to humans. It signals to your body that the food requires vast amounts of energy to capture so the body keeps itself in top condition. Factory farms don’t allow the animals to  be stressed in the same way as in the wild and it shows in its omega fat and mineral profiles.
Why change the thumbnail??
8:49 they really made the soy milk do the soypog, amazing
The fact that we believe that climate change is made by carbon emitions in an conslusive way is CRAZY.  And that it has to be bad by rule of thumb too. We have worst enviromental problems than political agendas to fuel renuevable energies that are not worth it; except for the polititians that get agreements with companies to make all sorts of subsidized installations and get some of the money for themselves. EVEN worst is the Unsustainable fact of electric cars which they want us to use. Not only is not scalabe, it has worst contamination than a normal car taking into account the disposal of electronic components such as the battery (until we get solid state batteries).
No
4:25 I know where that sound is from
s
damn what happend to the thumbnail
Its so important that there are still channels like kurzgesagt who are able to do a neutral video about such a heated topic just based on well researched facts... wow thank you kurzgesagt!
There are a few issues not address in the video that I think need to be addressed but overall it was pretty good.   1: labor in many meat agricultural areas have both low populations and aging ones too so plant crops for human consumption is not possible. Most of the developed world relies on exploiting migrant labor to keep costs down. It is easier to raise cattle than grow kale  2: Water use is misleading. It is true plant protein use less water than animals protein calorie for calorie but the area’s that are used are different. Most of our plant foods are grown in warm climates, next to population centers and are rapidly draining water reservoirs while animals are spreed out. Massive feedlots can poison ground water but manure can also be used as fertilizer if managed properly.   3: The reason for animal feed is well winter. To get animals through the non growing season requires storing up the food to do so. This makes much of the temperate nations land unless outside certain vegetables and puts food chains at risk if there is a bad harvest.   To be clear I absolutely think we should have more plants in our diet and work on rebuilding forests but without taking labor, climate and local resource management into consideration the risk of a famine is high.   We should work on building large scale greenhouses to limit water, pesticides and transportation costs. Globally we need to stop using up water to feed endless orchards in dessert and work to incentivize nations with rainforest to stop the development of the land. We need a just transition
What about lab grown meat?
A video title: What happens if everything was free, the world without Money.(a suggestion by me.)
What's with that sneaky comparing ONE HUNDRED YEARS diagram to a ONE year diagram, without any visual indication. I thought you were better than this kurzgesagt.
eating chicken rn
What happened to Meat Love?
If you really care of global warming then just stop giving birth to new people 👈😡
I really like the Videos.  I have a question . Does the Universe in a Nutshell App get new Updates? For example an german translation .
-comment to boost the algorithm-
We just need Thanos .. problem solved
Worth pointing out that the nutritional value of a lot of new vegan/veggie products aren’t great! Just something to think about. Fairly sure Quorn is decent, and there’s always natural alternatives like chickpeas
Wait is it meat love or meat hate?
I was eating potatoes with pork while watching this is that a good thing or a bad thing
Didnt break down anything about fish...
Are we still pretending like human caused climate change is about to cause the apocalypse?
Vegans.......
It’s interesting that ruminants have existed for millennia. The cow fart hypothesis is a straw man.  Whether the animal is for food or not will not change the methane levels without killing the ruminants.
I don't need a beef. I am used to eat a chicken or a fish. But hey. Every single meat is hard to farm.
why you change the thumbnail
i want to eat a vegan
I cycle or bus to work. I even cycle or bus to do most of my errands. I use reusable bags, my bike's saddle bags and/or my backpack for groceries. I use a reusable coffee mug and reusable water bottle. I keep chopsticks, a spoon and a fork in my backpack so I don't have use to use single use plastic utensils. I use reusable containers for lunches. I purchase most of my produce in season and as local as possible. I only purchase beer/wine/whiskey that is made within 100km of wherever I happen to be. I hunt a deer and a few turkeys/ducks per year to supplement my meat intake. I use warm water and vinegar as my main cleaning agent. I have been boycotting Chinese made products and try to buy things made within 500km of me whenever possible. My next car will be a fully electric vehicle.   I do all these things because I have chosen to continue eating meat, and I won't be made to feel bad about it.
It sounds to me like there’s just to many humans on earth
Holy cow! The thumbnail for this changed!
Go vegan. That is the only thing where you don't have to do any crazy acrobatics with your mind anymore. You will be in peace with yourself, also when it comes to the ethical aspect of it all.
While I agree with much of what is said in this video, I find it sad that the maker of this video has not looked at the possibility of farming becoming part of the solution to not only climate change but the biodiversity and health crises. To quote the Soil Association: "the solution to climate change is under our feet." Some farmers are working very hard become carbon neutral and to lock up carbon in their soils. I googled "Can farming ever be net zero and found some interesting information. Also YouTube videos by soil scientist Elaine Ingham are very interesting, and regenerative farmer Richard Perkins. Also currently enjoying a book by James Rebanks.
What do White Americans eat for dinner?
Dont care.  Im not changing.  Come to texas trying ban meat and youll be met with guns
Cutting out beef was probably the easiest thing I’ve done in the past eighteen years. You don’t miss it for long.
Thank You for All that you are doing for World Peace.. Peace.. Shalom.. Salam.. Namaste ..🙏🏻 😊 🌈 ✌ 🌷 ☮️ ❤️
Meat is the bestest thing
only if they're as nutritiously dense and  cheap and taste good at the same time
start a podcast. please. asap. day 1
Honestly this has been well known for years and is just making way as an argument, absolutely ridiculous, this is not a debate the way hitting the breaks before you hit a wall normally is not a debate, to have a debate about it is the same as having a debate about this: insanely stupid.
This video makes me wanna eat a 🥩 followed by a 🍔
You just hited 17M subs! Good job! Lets do a goal for 20M subs!
it’s so hard to not eat beef when you see everyone else eating it. in the grand scheme of things it’s not making a difference😕
what about lab grown beef?
They changed the tumbnail
Soooo... in other words, you can replace beef and cow milk with something like chicken and goat milk and still help the environment? Well, I wouldn't mind that then.
There's an issue with how those 26% emissions from food compare to much of the other 74% emissions. When you burn fossil fuels, you keep releasing new carbon content into the atmosphere from stores that were trapped deep underground. That slowly gets absorbed by the soil or sea, but that has its own issues, since it's adding CO2 to the overall surface system. When cows or rice release methane it's an entirely different process: CO2 is absorbed from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and its carbon is converted to CH4 by the cows' digestive system or the microorganisms in rice paddies or what have you. That CH4 remains in the atmosphere for some time and eventually becomes CO2 again. So food production is not adding any more greenhouse gasses _per year_, provided it remains constant. It does contribute to global warming by replacing a fraction of the CO2 with CH4, which is a more potent greenhouse gas, but that's at a steady state - that is, any new CH4 added per year replenishes the CH4 that naturally reverts to CO2 over the same period of time. Unless you burn down forests to increase your farmlands and pasture lands, the effect of that 26% is far milder than that of the fraction of the remaining 74% that relies on fossil fuels.
Why are there so many misleading graphics in this video?  For example, the graphic comparing international transport of plant products vs local transport of meat implies that it is much more environmentally friendly to transport plants overseas vs meat locally.   However, these plants STILL need to be transported locally once they reach the port.   Yes, the shipping overseas part is more efficient, but the graphic and narrative imply that the overall impact of shipping plants internationally is less than that of  beef shipped locally (which is obviously not true).   Similarly, the graphic about CO2 reduction by reusing land space indicates 800b tonnes of CO2 could be removed from the atmosphere (over 100 years).   This is then compared to our ANNUAL production of CO2 (50b tonnes), making it look like reclaiming this land alone would solve our CO2 problems, where it would actually take out 8b tonnes per year out of 50b.    i.e. when comparing numbers, always use the same units.  I believe I saw a couple of other misleading items, but I'll have to re-watch to double check.  The data seems right, but the way it's presented is quite misleading.   This is unfortunate to see in a Kurzgesagt video, as it is mistakes like this that meat proponents will grab onto and use to claim the whole argument is wrong.
The thumbnail took a dark turn.
Say “methane controversy” one more time…
But the green house gases from plats (e.g. methane from rice) were sequestered by those plants from the air and soil in the first place, right? So they are a part of the natural cycle, right?  So compared to fossil fuels, aren't they in a completely different category?
I’m eating cheeseburger
Hey kurzgesagt, how come you changed the thumbnail of your video from "Meat Love" to "Meat Hate"? Is it because you thought the former sent the wrong message, or that the algorithm will give your video a better chance with the title of "Meat Hate"?  Just curious.
I am having a beef-free diet for 3 years now. I would say it's definitely a very viable option, campared to going full vegan.
Everyone in the comments are still desperately searching for answers from eachother on how to be environmentally friendly but still be able to selfishly consume the diet they always have. Lol. Videos like these will never make a difference as long as the ignorant choose to remain ignorant.
Were there any conflicts of interest in the production of this video?
I thought this video will talk about the effect of meat on human body....
Youtuber: posts video on meat ThatVeganTeacher: *n o*
Look at a mirror and closely study your teeth
This channel is way too good not to have it all streamed on TVs globally
11:49 You guys really thought you need to wayt for January to hit 16 mil?
now talk about lab grown meat pls
I appreciated this video for it's mostly unbiased perspective and how informative it was on the metrics for the usage of resources. The one thing I found a bit ridiculous was the tie in with the carbon allowance (not carbon footprint), this kind of upset me as I am very accustomed to more fact based videos from this channel and the doomsday stuff that claims our planet will die in 20 years was just a bit disappointing. I have to assume that the research (in regards to carbon allowance) was done using specific sources as that is literal speculation, speculation that has changed consistently over the past century and longer. We've been told that we'd be dead by the 40s, 60s, 80s... etc and everytime that time comes it gets pushed further and further back. It also interested me that he outright mentions that the plants actually use CO2 and that our footprint with regards to CO2 specifically is dramatically offset by plants. I'm not a climate change denier by any stretch of the imagination (unless your definition means that I cannot question or doubt things in which case I should have my picture in the dictionary right next to the term) but I despise the way in which it is posed as settled science and that humans are accelerating climate change to an insane degree. I loved the explanation for the methane and adored the breakdown of how ecosystems are being destroyed all so that those who can afford high grade meat can act morally superior. I will not change my diet as I have tried a vegan diet (for my girlfriend) and I just hated all the substitutes and consistently craved my steaks or chiggin with that said I love being more well informed as to the production of my food and what to purchase based on my own morals. Thanks man, you and the whole team. Keep up the beautiful and amazing work!
So why don’t we just set up markets at ports and have the high emission food only available there?
Food is the best thing? meh, for me its just calories^^
As someone who has done some of the studies for lifecycle carbon footprints I can tell you that the values aren't accurate. We leave out certain factors that are hard to calculate such as wastage. Reliable and accurate data is hard to come by but there is an undeniable lead in plant waste. This raises plant carbon values compared to meat. Another is human digestive efficiency. 100g of animal protein in the mouth isn't the same as 100g of plant protein in the mouth. It also has an effect on human gaseous emissions. There is also the use of leather, wool and feathers plus manure and slurry as opposed to synthetic  alternatives which all have high fossil fuel dependence. We simply don't factor this in to the meat Value. We put it in a separate category and give it the same value even though even it's all from the same animals. We also don't consider the values of dairy even though, as this video points out around half of all beef is dairy cattle. We are in essence calculating the cost of a cake and only giving the benefit of one slice and then comparing it to the cost and benefit of a full cake.
Meat love or hate?
I just love beef. Nothing beats medium- Entrecote. :(
Meat isn't bad. It's only bad when there is an over-consumption of FATTY meats that are prepared poorly. SUGAR is the real problem these days. And sodium. And a total lack of exercise for nearly every person in America.
I would love to see this presentation be a Senate hearing under penalty of perjury and see how many statements you can truthfully make. Everything in this video is an outright lie, misdirection or purposefully leaves out the whole story. Good persuasion argument. Too bad persuasion doesn't work on people who know more than you do.
As someone from the Ayn Rand Institute quite rightly said: 'We should be looking to increase our carbon footprints - more CO2 == more life.'
Ok, let's all go vegan. What about the waste and pollution made by the industries for the diet supplememts? Or the availability for all people
You very much
So what I'm getting is, that we need to eat less meat, or more precisely less beef. Not necessarily cut everything out, but eat less. (yes cutting everything out would be "better", but is not necessarily neccesary)
Wouldn’t eating bison be more eco friendly and efficient since they have evolved to use the natural resources available in North America? They should be able to thrive with almost no human intervention in the right places.
the earth is going to die
Food is the only bodily pleasure that's enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old? Well, today I learned that despite his silky deep voice, the narrator has not yet hit puberty.  EDIT - I think Kurzgesagt is having their comment section raided. There are a few profiles with names like "Farmer Tales" or whatever posting lists of arguments with tortured spelling and grammar. Admittedly, valid arguments that deserve a rebuttal - a part 2 for the video, or even part 3. But then, there are scads of people with names that appear South Asian, copy/pasting the same text of tortured spelling and grammar. Seems like Farmer Tales (or whomever) has engaged a troll farm in India to come and start hundreds of arguments in the comments.
We need cow buttplugs that can burn off the methane in cow farts. It would solve the greenhouse gas emissions problem and the cows might enjoy it, too.
Dislike Button
I like how they explained why people are hesitant to give up their meat eating. It was very even handed and empathetic.
Also, this might sound crazy, but...don't go full vegan, just have less beef and more genetically enhanced super-meats. At least that's my "hot take" with zero expertise.   Also all that stuff about burping and farting cows could easily be taken for some kind of South Park inspired satire. Maybe I should get to work on writing that...as if I didn't already have no shortage of ideas on the creative to-do list.  Tune in later for the next episode of "Tradeoffs!"
Gave you a dislike because this is a propaganda video. It's propaganda because it constructs a narrative by asserting some facts that favor that narrative and withholding others that destroy that narrative. You close your propaganda with a really disgusting passive aggressive line "Even if you find the most environmentally friendly beef in the world, your burger still comes with a significantly higher carbon footprint than a veggie patty. You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information." Aka, you can decide for yourself are you gonna still be eating meat and destroying the planet because it tastes good, or you're gonna become a responsible adult and throw that meat in the trash and start eating veggie patties. Well, I'm gonna be a responsible adult and throw that veggie patty in the trash and eat meat. Why? Well, because a 70 gram veggie patty holds 124 calories from 4.4  grams of fat, 10 grams of carbs and 11 grams of noncomplete plant protein. And that's shit food. Meat, patty of the same weight has 197 calories from 12 grams of fat, 0 carbs and 21 grams of complete protein. so, just to get the same amount of protein you need to eat 2 veggie patties, which holds 20% more calories, you're gonna have to chew through double the size of food and in the end, it's still not complete protein so you're gonna have nutrient deficiencies and lose muscle mass. So, It's not just the nutrient density that matters, it's the nutrient quality. Otherwise we could be living off of licking lard, since fat is the nutrient that holds more than twice the energy of the other two.
I am not getting moved by "carbon footprint" arguments for as long as we are dancing around who are the main polluters. That skews the perception too much on just how much of a pressure we are on. The stats are nice to know otherwise, there are ways to improve.
I don't know about other countries but in mine beff is luxury meat. It's price per kilo is very high, almost twice the price of chicken. It's true that fast food companies love using """""""""""beef""""""""""""" (they use every piece of meat a cow can offer, so it's more of a mixture of meats than a cut from one specimen), but you wouldn't normally but beef. You'd buy chicken, pork (not much, is too fatty) or turkey
i have this idea of putting BCI into deer or pig and let them roam the wild savanna or forest to find food. the BCI will have GPS censor to track the animal movement, we can steer the animal into place where they can find food. also to prevent them from getting out of assign area we can put geo-fencing so if GPS detect that animal get out of the assign grazing area the BCI will take over the animal body and steer it back into the assign grazing area. so basicly no need to open forest for the animal, just release them into the forest and monitor them. when its time for harvest the BCI will steer the pig into processing center.   the problem is how we can effectively installed BCI that can control the movement of a pig or deer, also we need to put censor to detect predator better, we need the BCI to be reuseable so when we harvest the animal we can use it again for new release.  i would call this cyber farming, because the animal was turned into cyber when they were born release into wild to find food and when the time comes they will walk into sl***hter house.  that is how the future of farming should be. efficient, mechanised, balanced.
In 9:21 comperates 500 bilion tonnes over 100 yers with 50 bilion tonnes over 1 yers and put it together on chart its misleading and wrong like F**k!! Becouse we need compare same stuff!!!  500bilions over 100 yers is 5 bilion over one yer and this is ´´only´´ 10% our emmision yerly. With the trees planting and maintaining themselves. When they can do mislead like this prudence is on the point here.
I wish Kurzgesagt had mentioned lab grown meat and how those emissions roughly compare to cattle. I would be curious, if they are correct in saying most of the emissions come from cow burps and farts, since lab grown meat would not have that as a factor at all.
First 5 seconds. I disagree, it's actually S[censored]X.
There's no question that we need to reduce meat consumption. But there are a few things, not necessarily about meat but climate change overall, that I want to point out: 1) Green house gas might be an easy parameter, but if we really want to mitigate/prevent climate crisis, the main focus should be on ecological destruction as a whole. Cos soil erosion (say due to plowing), water pollution, desertification, biodiversity destruction etc are rather more important. 2) What about food waste and the fact that plant based food are wasted many times more? 3) Why not work towards making vegetable based food more available? Why just talk about an existing food habit? For example - in our and many similar South-East Asian family, we consume roughly 250g meat/week (1 kg for 4 people, once a week). But that's mainly possible cos fish and a large amount of vegetables is part of our cuisine for centuries. 4) CH4 emitted by cows don't add any new carbon to the atmosphere, rather it's the same carbon that used to be CO2 a few years back, got converted to grass, leaf, etc and eaten by cows. CH4 farted by cows do cause net damage, cos it's more potent. Still, it's kinda misleading without considering this. Since this comment questions this video, and also quite long, it's very likely that YouTube will push it at the bottom, as a result. Still, if anyone is reading, plz give a thought.
Did... Did you change the thumbnail?
This doesn't take one group into account, I assume because it's so small -- people who only eat meat that they hunt.

Man this channel went from an intrigue generating science channel about universe and space to a left wing indoctrination camp. You guys are fighting here about the “best beef” and the “worst beef” in the western world while the 1/3 of the total global green houses are generated from India and China combined.   But please tell me how drastically changing eating habits in the western world is going to produce an effect in world climate change.
Vegetable oils and plants are harder for us to digest and are missing vital fats, vitamins and other nutrients generally. The problem with meat today is antibiotics, bad animal conditions, poor food, overendulging (with most food). The solution is more quality, fresh and raw, not soome sort of green global communism.
1-You don't even mention the co2 farmer store in the soil with cattle, you just count the production of co2, not the usage.  2- The best arable land are turned into cities full of concrete, thats why farmer cut down forests. The total cattle amount didn't go up for quite some time, farmers are getting more efficient. 3- Pasture cattle are basicly carbon neutral, they store co2 in the ground, its a very good way to grow cattle.  4- Alot of subproducts are used to feed the cattle, that would otherwise just being thrown away. And a third of the arable land is only suitable for grassing. 4- We waste about 40% of all food production. This is the biggest factor, let alone how much carbon each crop produce.
We also have to consider the fact that some people simply can't adpot a vegan or vegetarian diet due to health issues (Hormonal disbalance, gastrointestinal damage, etc) and is not realistic to reduce the stock for that specific target nor force people who can be vegan to do so. I personally tried to become vegetarian and I couldn't I had lots of nutritional deficiencies back then and now I reduce my consumption of red meat as much as possible (Once a month or two).  Taking into consideration that most of the food overall is wasted before the distribution is an issue we have to resolve maybe use the "waste" to recycle them and use it as fertilizer in case of rotten products and if it is because the plant is sick donate it to science to study the sickness. Animals is a bit more complcated, if its a sickness same as plants, but if it is for other external factors could be used also as fertilizer; burying the corpse for the soil to consume it (By soil I mean all microorganisms and insects)   GMOs and lab made tissue are by far the best options, GMOs until we can perfectly mimetize the taste and flavor of "real" meat. using more efficient animals in order to use less land or having more effective digestive systems. I don't know  This is what I call a "coffee/beer topic" which you can talk for hours and still just touching the tip of the iceberg. I love how you choose such an interesting topic
Everyone should be vegetarian, as ANIMALS ALSO HAVE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THERE LIFE AND LIVE MORE,DON'T BE THAT Selfish "HUMANS" , SAY NO TO MEAT AND LOVE ANIMALS,,, OTHERWISE ALSO START KILLING HUMANS (INCLUDING YOUR OWN FAMILY ) AS THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN U AND A MURDER, AS U ALSO KILL A ANIMAL ( HUMAN IS ALSO AN ANIMALS )  FINAL WORDS - BE VEGETARIAN AND LOVE Natural (without harming )    Hope u understand .
Amazing seeing you guys revise this topic and giving it proper care, this is by far the best way you tackled it from the last video
You guys should consider making a video about "sintropic agriculture".
Not Stonk
The fossil fuels industry has done a great job at shifting the blame.
I don't want to kill plants and trees so for that I am meat eater 👨‍🎤
Stop EVIL meat industry, it's destroying Earth and health, it wastes 70% of edible food, drinkable water and causing unimaginable suffering! Alcohol, tobacco, meat and sugar are most dangerous drugs. Go vegan
I was already a vegan all this time for ethical reasons and prevent animal cruelty, but I didn't know that meat had such a terrible impact on our environment too
I like these kind of videos
U r confused urself
Where’s the analysis on fish?
What about cow poop making soil more carbon captive
MEAT ON THE TRACK
Great to see more science backing up my personal views that I got from science in the first place. Amazing video!
You guys have already done this video before...
I literally am a coal miner. I can't really worry about the ethics of my impact climate change
I had read that animals are fed crops that aren't _always_ suitable for human consumption. I think it would be interesting to see some clarification there, I was hoping to see it when you mentioned the statistics but oh well.  I wish I could look it up alone, but I'm not knowledgeable on this area.
There is a lot of missing parts, animals are fed with byproducts of other industries like the husk of the soy, not the bean used in your vegetable oil
"You can decide, what you want to do with information" - Insane leftist will push government to ban meat.
Such a great video! This really gave me a lot of insight into vegetarianism: it can be incredibly difficult when one's own research is overshadowed either by heated arguments or so scientifically detailed it makes your head spin. I really hope you'll do a video on fish one day too!
I love how unbiased this video is. They talk about everything,and aren't leaning on a side. But I can't see the dislikes on the video to see the ratio of the video
I'll still enjoy meat but it does make me think.
Methane emitted from beef is carbon neutral as the carbon comes from the grass/food which is in itself sequestered from the atmosphere. The climate argument against meet is fabricated to promote the ethical vegan agenda (which in itself has less appeal with the general population).
Can someone explain to me quickly why transporting 1kg of avocados emits less than 1 kg of beef? Weight is weight, no? They both need to be chilled etc. As far as i can tell in this video, i should be buying meat imported from south america instead of local, because the drive from the butchers is 6 times more emitting than across the atlantic.   Like I'm on a low meat diet already but that one didnt click in my head. Please help.
Just had those impossible beef strips and it was disgusting
Everyone who can should just go veggie if you can afford it and have the time to cook veggie meals its easy after 2-3 years depending on the person you stop missing meat pretty quickly
Imagine if everyone in the world cut their beef intake by half, the world would be a much better place!!!
Brazilians love kurzgesagt too😍❤️
what they're trying to say is, we're not gonna die from a virus, ai, or even nuclear war. we're gonna dun do a die because of cows ._.
Meat is literally how we went from gathering clowns to what we have right now. uuuuuuh but meatses is animal, ye okay
Keep pushing that plant protein propaganda. Tell me cutting and hauling meat is more intensive than all the processing in an impossible burger.
I will never stop eating meat, no matter what.
God damn it,     the vegans were right
i dont know but in 3rd world countries it dont matter if food is meat or veg it is all the same.
This went wrong from the beginning as these tend to go in this channel.  Ahfter the ultrafuck then yeah it all makes sense in a way.  Never going to be vegan but the premise is just wrong
Hi
After watching this video I realized two things.  1. Meat is indeed a big contributor to Climate Change. A Vegan diet would definitely keep our planet livable for much longer. 2. I am never gonna give up meat. Because if an explanation can't make me vegetarian/vegan, I don't think anything ever can.
Wait. Why can’t grasslands be converted to cropland? That doesn’t make sense to me. You glazed right over that
I think the problem is still a little bit overblown... Yes absolutely, we shouldn't burn the rain forest to put cows in it, or for any reason really. And sure... beef as a single product emits more than others, but is kind of an unfair way of putting it, meat-based food is a lot less varied than plant based, not to mention is consumed in lower quantities overall. If you look at the bigger picture, livestock as a whole actually produces similars amounts of emissions to agriculture (5.8% and 5.4% respectively counting rice), and if we account for grassland and crop land, agriculture ends up emitting more than livestock.  Also kind of unfair to look at the methane produced by all the cows, instead of just counting the excess of cows, remember that there used to be 60 million bisons in the US, alongside a lot more raindeer and oher ruminants. Since methane production exists on a cycle, how do we compare to the natural existing numbers from millions of years. And the excess is the real number we have to worry about.  Yes I agree that reducing livestock would probably be more efficient, even if that increases emissions on agriculture overall, surely we can reduce some percentage, but since food is absolutely mandatory is hard to say hoy much, already there is less than a percent of difference between the two industries, meanwhile there is the gigantic 73% of emissions by the energy and transportation sector...  Of course less emissions in food in worth persuing, but it should be something like our fifth priority. And don't let anyone tell you that eating less or no meat is the best thing you can do for the environment, it is not.
I've seen vegetarians burning butchers, but I haven't seen meat eater burning cornfields.  Began is psychosis.
Vegans think that by not eating meat, they are saving the Amazon rainforest. As if that stops the mafia, corruption, lack of education, lack of laws and poverty there. Very naïve people with very strong opinions.
9:28 isn't this graph misleading?
If meat is bad why does it taste so good? Especially when cooking one animal if you take the fat from another animal and baste the first animal as is cooks it make it double delicious.
love the nonexistence of comparison of the diets on an individual level. truly the age of ideology driven useful idiots.
In case anyone's wondering, the Like to Dislike ratio is 226K to 10K
more idelogic and dogmatic with every video. this has turned into a propaganda site
Another great video!
wait did they change the title and thumbnail?
Im not changing what i eat for the planet.
Vegan teacher: I love the thumbnail
Regardless of climate change, when you eat meat you are killing animals.
Did you change the thumbnail of the video?
I can give up beef, I don't care much for it
Why was fishleft out
No, it is not
We also ship our chicken (and pork, if I’m not mistaken) from the us, have it slaughtered and processed abroad with cheap labor costs, then shipped back to the US. Talk about emissions. Lmao.
As someone with Crohn’s, I can’t relate at all to the first few sentences of the video. I hate food. I hate eating. I hate being hungry. If I never had to eat again and never had to suffer hunger, I wouldn’t eat ever again.   I don’t care for food and I don’t find it enjoyable.
sex is better
Dislike button
but it tastes good
Wait a minute, isn't the title meat love? I guess PETA did something lol.
I little bothered by how he pronounces *methane* lol
CO2 stonks after this video 📉
Grass feed reduce production? no if you use good pasture management yield can be double easily. We need more grassland for biodiversity. Everything is anti meat biaised
Methane was here before we breed cattle, wild animal produce methane before we breed them. This is insane.
So for a meat-eater like myself the only thing I get out of this is.  1) That I eat less red meat, one packet of Mince to last me a month? (Cause I ain't going vegan or vegetarian. Sorry) 2) Problem over all seems to be Over-population. Planet can't sustain us anymore, we need to cut the population down by a few billion? 3) Wait for them to invest more into making Synthetic Meat that tastes and is as (Or more) nutritiously viable than the real thing, to become affordable?  I've tried the vegan route and it doesn't work for me, made me lethargic, tired all the time and simply missed meat.
Anyone watching this while eating meat?
Vegan agrosystem don't exist. They don't work. So no meat world is a fantasy.
So the problem is not the food we eat, but the amount of people there are on the planet. I would say lets just cut the human race in half. Just a random ball says you may live or die. Everytime there are to many humans on the planet we do it again. Less humans, less need for food, less need for food, less problems with the environment. Will also fix the plastic waste in the world. :)
proteins in meat are ~2x more valuable (bio-available) than plants.  But the main point - we eat too much meat, it inhibits the TOR (speed-up aging) the most of all proteins (it varies between dif types meat too tho)
Thank you for this brilliant, informative, visually stunning video!
The YouTube API still gives dislike. As of 12-05-2021, the video is pretty well-received given the sensitive subject with a ratio of dislikes of 266K/9.9K.
Masha
I think I've seen this on the german channel before, but since then i have not eaten any beef since I don't really need to.
damn. that sucks.
By "that" you mean how much?  That's a good video. Just stay neutral.
I usually love kurzgesagt but this video has quite some flaws.
Soy Crops Humans 19% - Animals 77% - Industry 4%. I missed the detailed explanation on what will happen when you stop people eating beef. When you cut out the animals, will the 77%  used for animals not become 77% used for humans? Making things like tofu is done in the amazon just like the cow farms no?
Even if eating meat wasn't destroying the planet, the way we treat animals is frankly evil. It's a shame we have to frame the subject in self-interested reasoning.
Honestly, eating bugs that use less crops and water to feed with high output is just plain better doe.
Dang. I really wanted to see the ratio on this vid.
A lot of comments on this video are being censored for some reason, and many posts are being filtered. How come?
I don't know about you guys but what I'm drawing off this video is to cut back on beef products and just start eating organic vegans. Problem solved in my book
Difficult subject ^^ I fill like there is missing information but the global LCA is different to country-based LCA. There is missing information about the ecology of preexisting grazing land (CO2 sequestration, biodiversity). But you did not forget to speak about the specificity of grassland in the agriculture (not possible to cultivate other food on it). That's very difficult to summarize !
Can't wait for a certain teacher reacting to this... She may demonize this
You know it’s a good day when Kurzgesagt uploads
I wonder if we would still grow soy crops for the 20% by weight that is used for food and fuel, even if we didn’t use the 80% by weight for animal food. What is the relative value of the 80/20 for the producer? Does 80% of their profit come from animal food?
Was this per gram of bio available protein or simply total protein?
Looks like team at kurz. has gone vegan 😅
What about leather? Even a cow that is bred just for meat still provides leather to make shoes and furniture from. Was that accounted in the graphs? I'm not suggesting it is right or wrong to not talk about leather, but it is just another factor that shows how complicated the matter is. In a world without cows we could replace leather completely by artificial leather, but artificial leather is not that climate friendly either, because it is a product of the oil industry.
Vegan propaganda. To summarize: don't eat meat, you have to get used to vegan diet, since normal meat will be available soon only for aristocrats and not for you, peasants.
I like the response video, but I think you ignored some things to make your point. Would love another video where you address the whole picture.  Maybe try one that includes a steel man argument that opposes your point of view so that you can make a better argument for why you are right.
A human body is not designed to digest meat. So why would anyone put meat into their body. Doesn't make any sense at all. It's like putting diesel into a petrol car.
Veganism is a religion, has fanatic followers, tries to convert others using passive and aggresive ways, has its own specialists as priests whose words cannot be doubted, judges and contemns other people disregarding Scientific facts, etc.  and the Market embraces it as the Fanatics will consume blindly Vegan Labels and re-promote them as a religious act.
I like beef.
It isn't about food. It's about an excessive amount of humans on the planet.
meat is not bad, it's the shit they feed the animals with, and of course the anitbiotics
Video suggestion: Whats beyond space? (theory) What would happen if we were faster than the rate of space expansion and get past it?
I felt guilty watching this video.  ...because I'm already a vegetarian, and watching stuff that so clearly supports decisions I've already made has that effect. :\
I mean food is food
The thumbnail changed
"Ain't nothing like a good salad" Filthy Frank 2016.
Incredible video
im at 2:43 what about fish emissions
Food is primal happiness. Eat and let eat. Live happy. :)
The environment isn't the only issue here. Go visit a factory farm. How can anyone claim to love animals, but yet support that with their dollars?
Where did the meat love video go I wanted to watch both sides of this argument. I was super excited to them show Both sides of the argument in different videos
Yes !!! Thank you so much. It s my job to help People understand climat change and how they can efficietnly reduce their impact. food is a complex subject, and you absolutely nailed it. you re making the job easier !! thxs
What about the ethics of killings and exploitation sentient amimals for their bodies?. That's the biggest reason to not eat meat.
Companies are responsible for around 71% of all emissions. Therefore, putting the sole responsibility on the individual is moronic and unethical.
Maybe it isnt climate cahnge that is warming up the planet, maybe its just a stage at which the planet is gonna increases in few degrees, if we have ice ages, why cant we have "warm" ages.
What about crop byproducts that are used as feed. Surely they are efficient to use along with grass fed.
I love like local birds on intro having a celebration dinner including cooked chicken on the center of table ^ ^
meat tastes good
start taking off the other 75% of non-meat emissions, then MAYBE we start talking about meat. Big Corpo like BP want you to believe its YOU'RE responsible for climate change while also lobbying against clean energy and costs directed to reduce their own impact. Also nobody is talking about useless cruise ships, a single one emits roughly 1000 kg of C02 per 1 km! Tons of ways to reduce C02 but the poor guy is always should take the burden , right?
I wholeheartedly support the idea of cloned meat but as long as meat is within my price range, I'll be eating it.
Why'd the title and thumbnail change?
I got hungry for meat!
can you talk about how going vegan is a way to stop demand of dairy and meat products, thus companies not breeding more and more cows that add more and more methane to the environment?
well i say there is something else that you can do multiple times a day that is very enjoyable
Eat meat and live 75 V/S Eat vegan and live 80 | I prefer to live 75 😅 Sorry guys! Can't give up on Meat
MEAT HATE: Haters gonna eat
Fake meat, better get used to the idea.
Nature finds its way.
One aspect I missed when the significantly lower emission "best beef" was brought up, is that this beef is likely to be more expensive or will become more expensive if more people want to buy it. On the other hand, there is no way that we can produce the same amount of global beef in this low CO2 way, so you just have the rich of the world spending money to calm their conscience, and not actually solving the global problem by consuming less.  There are many products like this, which make it sound like you are no longer part of the problem, but actually just transfer the only global solution, which is reduced consumption, to the less economocally fortunate of the world.
I am a selfish person and I don't care about the problem until it reaches me so...
Kurzgesagt: No bodily pleasure is enjoyed many times a day and never gets old  Me on incognito: I beg to differ
Iam pretty sure that the ppl in intro are cannibals
Excellent video
Ah yes, gotta love those Peta paid videos
Please do one on fish, fisheries and over fishing is worse than anything were doing on land.
Regardless about how you feel about meat, be warned that, worst case scenario, we could eventually find ourselves in a situation where even politely defending your right to eat meat will be considered hate speech by the woke-tard media + mob.   And then comes the attempts to ruin your life.  And this is a significant reason why my family and I severed ties with a certain political party despite years of logistical + financial support.  Because for many of these radical loudmouths, it'll never be enough.  So, for the sake of our loved ones, if for nothing else, we need to firmly put our feet down.
2100 sounds fine to me - gonna keep enjoying my meat and the free power from my solar cells which also heat my entire home. Thank you.
How can buying locally use more emissions?  Showing shipping like the food magically appeared on the ships and was unloaded on its own... Trucks used in both ends. Definitely uses more. Locally grown just had the end transport.
Happy Meat Farms says hello
Well at least avoiding beef compared to other types of meat might kinda make a small difference. It's something.
Seems we're fucked aren't we?
nothing about carbon sequestering of grassland or about the carbon cycle of grassland
Aight, we'll just have to make cows go extinct. Y'all can't behave.
Vegans seething right now
i wanna see the dislike count for this
I must have a bunch of different Youtube tabs open because I was getting ready to watch the other video done on this topic, only to find out they're probably pulling some kind of clicks research and have been swapping the Thumbnail and Title.
From happy heart cow on thumbnail got send to hell for no reason
In the beginning you look at greenhouse gas emissions and say it's 25%, but you are actually only referring to CO2 it seems. What about other greenhouse effect gasses like Methane for which livestock is the major contributor?
Just stop eating beef instead eat chicken and mutton. It is even more ecofriendly.
Ehhh, putting the blame of co2 emissions on people who dont control the governments or the markets is pointless. Making people think that they can make a difference by just changing their lifestyle is also pointless. It only plants desperation and disappointment. We cannot do anything anyway, plant based diet is simply too expensive for most people.  The only way to reduce emissions is to change the way we produce things and that lies in the hands of people in governments and corporations. But what we *can* do is force them to change
Dude the methane cows emit goes back into the grass that cows eat. It's a cycle. The co2 cars emit doesn't go back into fossils deep in the ground.   And the animals eat the part of the crops that humans cant eat. Do you guys ever use hay? No you don't and it goes to feed cows!   You compare the emissions of the ship carrying avocados to the emissions of the truck carrying the beef? What about the trucks bringing the avocado to the ship and taking it from the ship to the customer?  This video is all over the place!
For me living without meat is very easy because I live in India,the lowest meat consuming country hence I have never eaten any kind of meat but except eggs that also not usually only 1time in a month and I think I never will eat meat and Mainly I am not vegan I can eat meat anytime but I just don't like consuming meat
Pleas next vedio on topic space
We have a thing called STEAM in almost all schools in UAE. This time my group wants to create something to reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Anyone who has any ideas or advices, please do share. We only have 1 month to create something that can reduce the CO2 levels.
The problem I see with bringing up possibilities in a "we could (use that land...)"-manner is that the "WE" part here is most likely to be what profit-driven agriculture companies will do with the available land. There is no "we the people" variable in that calculation. In capitalist societies there is no democratic decision making regarding land use.
yea meat is bad but aren't oil companies far more devastating to our environment then every meat eater combined?
Go Vegan.
Fuck the world, i have only 50 years left. Go for the beef!
Or just ask THANOS to SNAP again 🤣🤣🤣 It will reduce meat consumption by 50%🤣🤣🤣
I swore I saw a “meat love” with a smiling happy cow
Thanks for great video explaining the scientific objective information available!
i'm not eating bugs. I'll eat climate activists first.
The Vegan Teacher will be very happy about this video
so, we are fucked
So like almost everything in life the answer is : " it depends"
The basic answer to every Kurgezast video:   "Well, it's complicated"
im good with beef. WhO CARES ABOUT THE CLIMATE?
I need some beef after watching this.
BEAF! BEAF! BEAF! BEAF! BEAF!
the fact that the thumbnail changed from meat love to MEAT HATE is so funny to me 😭🏳
This kind of stuff is just blatant propaganda to lower your quality of life.
who else eating a Wendy's Baconator while watching this?
You really should have compare the "best beef" against plant-based food in terms of nutrients per kg of emissions at 3:40.
beyond meat?
You changed the thumbnail
The quality of meat is what is bad. Eat sick animals get sick. Simple as that.
test
Adam Ragusea made a video about carbon positive (or something like that) farming, where they reduce emmisions more than they produce; is there any kind of way thats posible in massive scale? is it even real or just a marketing trick? If its real, does that resolves the meat problem?
So brilliant
Can u make another space video
I’m a big fan
Did anyone  notice that the thumbnail was changed?
Go vegan !
Came after Abhi n Niyu ❤️
As always the animation is phenomenal
What am I gonna do with that information? Absolutely nothing 🤣🤣🤣 meat is GREAAAAAAAAT
Please wish to you Turkish language. I want wach these videos but my language not good. I devoloping just now. Thank you so much for understand guys.
I see your trying different thumbnails. I forget what other Channels video you commented it on but I see you!
Thanks Bill Gates for the donation.
"Hec-täres" (Hectares)
It’s meat really that bad  Fruits' vegetables or meat all of them are good to eat
If you dislike this video like this comment. That way we can keep the track.
"Is meat that bad?"  -proceeds to be a stealth video about climate change
Is it me or did the Thumbnail change
No it's good
Soooo in conclusion, if you want to stop climate change, the best way is to take a bath with a toster or, if you prefer something less grimm, not to reproduce. The Earth is too small for all of us.
twitter can bark all they want... i will continue to eat meat as long as i live
This entire video is premised on conventional industrial agriculture practices, which are basically the entire problem. If you start from the premise that this is the only way agriculture can happen, then you could reach these conclusions - but you'd be an idiot.   The idea that ruminants grazing on grass is some hugely destructive human invention very conveniently ignores the fact that before cattle were introduced to North America, most of the continent was teeming with bison. There's many old stories of bison herds so vast they could continue for days, literally impossible to even estimate. Possibly even in the millions. When it was bison grazing the plains for countless millennia, that was all G. But if domestic cattle, with the same ruminant digestive system, should be grazed on those grasslands that used to be flooded with bison... well, that would be a catastrophic existential threat! Because "The Science™", I guess?  Regenerative farming has proven to be a net carbon sink, and significantly so. Turns out that growing crops & livestock the way plants & animals grow in nature is way better ecologically than relying on synthetic petrochemical fertilisers & other chemicals, and feeding animals a diet they're not designed to live on which causes all kinds of flow-on effects (like increased methane burps, for eg).   Isn't it crazy to think that when you replicate natural ecosystems, you don't end up throwing everything else out of whack? *Imagine that.*
IDK if anyone else has mentioned this, but the only thing that I can think of that is worth mentioning that this video didn't point out is the fact that 80% of the oxygen production on Earth comes from the ocean, and most of that is done by plankton.
I don’t see how its possible for the world not to come to the end in the near future it seems like every little thing will one way or another doom us :I
It would be REALLY interesting to see how many dislikes this video got....
Yo why the thumbnail change?
Numbers don’t really make sense, and the studies you use have been heavily critiqued. Looking at each individual country you can see meat production produces a much smaller percentage of carbon emissions then advertised in this video. EG Japan says meat production accounts for 1% of their carbon emissions, the USA says only 4% this is the same trend with other major countries. You also use a lifetime metric for the meat, but not for the transportation which skews the viewpoint toward meat being a bigger producer of CO2 then the vehicles used throughout the entire cultivation process, which again is an inaccurate representation of the subject. Usually your videos are pretty good but this one seems to not be researched quite as well as others.
Humanity is like a fat person that blames their non existent thyroid condition for smething they can fix themselves.  Or just denying they have an issue like any other drug addict.  Yes, you greedy pigs are devouring the planet.
I could give up beef but not cheese. Cant we compromise
Worrying about the emissions from meat is like worrying about a stubbed toe when you have a broken arm.
People always justify eating meat by saying, "you need to eat meat to be healthy", and they talk about how weak and unhealthy vegans are.  Even if you grant that this is true, these people then eat way more meat than is necessary—so much that it's unhealthy.  Eggs and bacon and ham every breakfast, hamburgers every lunch, fried chicken every dinner.
Do people survive with no gravity?
Welp, sounds like a big yes
No. No it is not
Will this channel ever stop promoting global warming or climate change or whatever you people call this?
I really want a steak and a burger right now.
As for Brazil, I think it should be stopped because they are cutting down forests and turning them into ranches. Still, you can't stop livestock farming in a ranching area that wasn't originally a forest area and turn it into a forest. Can you? I'm not sure I can trust the figures because you don't show how they are calculated.   And why did you title this as a "meat bad" while you say most about "beef bad"? From the graph you've shown, it appears that eating pork and chicken is marginally OK, innit? The vegetarian argument is apparent in the tone, and its credibility is questionable for me.
heroineeeeeeeeeeee
Everyone should just die and we can save the earth...🙃  At the end of everything, it comes down to priorities and who will get to decide what those priorities are...
Just like everything else, every other problem humanity has, addiction, whatever, it all comes down to moderation. There's nothing wrong with eating meat even beef, the problem is having to consume it during nearly every meal. It should be a portion of the diet, not the entire diet. We can save the environment by simply learning to cook and eat healthy, regardless if its vegan or not.
1:23 What I got from this video is that food production is only a quarter of the emissions problem, and all of the budget. That's, uh... real bad.
how much of the animal feed is actually edible human food and not the waste product? How much land does crop production consume? Crop production still takes up land and also contribute to the rainforest burning and destruction of biodiversity. The video would be better if it was more honest about the crop side of agriculture as well. Food waste should be the main issue to fight when we tackling the problem of over production of food at the detriment of our planet. Yes, I hardly eat beef but I feel that just by demonising meat, people can just mass-market expensive alternatives :\ and that's just not helping anyone. Quinoa, Chia etc used to be the poor man's diet, and then a fad made the prices soar in the name of healthy eating and the environment.
Eat Meat every night of the week, that's how you get STRONG!
Thank you for addressing this serious issue. Our coasts are going to be under water 5 years ago
My biggest problem with veggie alternatives to meat is the price. It costs $10 for two patties of Beyond Burger, while I could get many pounds of ground beef for the same price.
the problem is that for a long time, taste and texture were overall better on a meat diet than a vegan diet
We need meat in our diet we are omnivors
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times per day, and never gets old."  Well, that certainly explains the lack of Kurzgezagt videos about sex.
LOL why do you keep switching the thumbnail between "Meat Love?" and "Meat Hate?" like this?!
SO, basically, there are too many people.  It's almost like Thanos was right.  Almost...
The cow farted like me😞
Legends know thumbnail is changed.
No one ever talks about the obvious solution: cannibalism.
Totally wrong about meat production being the worst food CO2 emissions
“International shipping is really efficient for transporting food”  What are they expecting that trucks are not going to pick up the food and distribute it to food stores? Do people walk several kilometers to the shipyard and walk back with their Mexican avocados and Brazilian beef on a regular basis?
I notice the video thumbnail changed. (Any one else?)
I always thought I've been in the green because I've been vegetarian my whole life. Giving up dairy is a whole different ballpark for me
Dinasors lived in a world that had 5 times more CO2 in atmosphere than today's. 🤔
Are you guys all vegan?
i can survive without meat, i cant eat beef and buffalo and chicken is ok i can live without it chicken, i can survive without pork rice and lentil potato, pickled radish etc  will do it CUZ IM NEPALI
YEEEERRRRRR I LOVE SAVING BEAUTIFUL COWS AND RAINFOREST!!!!!🐖🐄🐑🐏🦬🐐🐓🐓🐓🥑🥒🥦⛰️⛰️⛰️🍃🍂🍁🌾
wtf? i could've swear the thumbnail and the title of the video was about loving meat the other day
Thank you for the work you do, as always
It’s good how they’re showing the good and bad things about meat and it shows how people struggle to not eat meat like myself in a appropriate way
No, it tastes good
NO serious and decent humans being thinks that meat was a bad thing to eat.
I am still gonna eat meat
Okay...Kurzgesagt is officially part of the Vegan Cult, unsubscribing.
Am I the only one who noticed that kurzgesagt changed the tumb nail of this video
No matter how you twist it, it is still not a scientific fact that co2 causes global warming. The vast majority of scientist say it MAY be contributing, but is not the cause. IF food is 26% of emissions, that still does not mean it causing 26% of the warming because there is zero evidence that co2 causes more than at most 10% of the warming max. That means at most food will cause a maximum of .00001°c change in the next century. IS that worth killing 5 billion people for?
This opened my eyes, Vegans were right. But most vegan I've met are so pushy and disrespectful toward someone like me who eat meat.
People:stop eating after watching this  Their body:Lose out on  a ton of nutrients it can’t get elsewhere
What if we reduced intake a lot Like to one large animal per family per year  Only taking meat on the Day of Sacrifice for example... (Eid ul Adha)
feel like you got a lot of meat hating misinformation up in here.
looks like you didn't see what would happen if all Americans just used vegan food. it is going to be bad
Meat is great!
I aint giving up my meat... I work out, and for me to get the same protein from plants that I get from meat would break me financially plus soy aint good for you. Oh we as a species also evolved to eat cooked meat... so imma stick to my smoked BBQ xD
A lot of my old relatives ate 90% meat 10% vegetables back then. They passed away at age between 87 & 94. vegetarian thing is just a fad. Steve Jobs passed away at what age? Everyone knows he's a vegetarian
i think food production isn't the issue rather massive crippling unchecked unregulated overpopulation is to blame. there's just way to many people on the planet, so no matter what solutions we come up with or changes we make to fight climate change and environmental destruction our massive overpopulation will undo all of it in time.  like even if every human on the planet turned vegan, or started living in sustainable life styles, eventually there will be so many people the progress will be undone. like if we all go vegan yes we save lots of land, but eventually that land will be turned into crop farms or be used for human settlement. if we want to combat climate change we need to find a permanent solution to overpopulation or anything we try to do to fix climate change will just delay the inevitable.
i wish i never had to be hungry so that i didnt have to eat and poop all the time.
It used to have a different thumnail.
TLDW: The world as we know it is fucked, there is no real way to save it only slightly delay the inevitable, live your life as happy as you can because you won't be around when it all ends.
Why are the wokes so obsessed with stoping people for eating meat ?   A few years ago is "But they are intelligent don't eat them" then "Don't you feel bad why not eating your dog" then "If you wouldn't kill it you can't eat it" and now it's "because the environment"
i plant 10 trees tomorrow so i can eat beef for a year ,, damn im smart
Boa
I'm calling BS on the claim that vegetable alternatives are better than straight beef. Why? Because they require orders of magnitude more industry than a cattle farm to produce the same amount of food. It's even admitted in your own data that land repurposed for beef farming is included into the "carbon emissions" of beef; somehow I doubt that same calculation is done for all the crap needed to keep your hormonally horrifying impossible burger production going. There's too many ways to twist the data, and too many lies being peddled by the various industries involved. The vegan diets also ignore all the vitamins and supplements that're necessary to live, which require their own industry to be factored in because you can't get those all from vegan sources in the required amounts. We also can't feed kids vegan diets, it causes them to be physically deformed and malnourished. In fact, this malnourishment causes them to be measurably shorter than meat-eating counterparts, by 6"-1.5ft. Humans are not designed to eat only sugars, starches and fibers. I guarantee you that if, *IF* anthrogenic climate change is real, we will do everything in our power to solve the issue before changing out dietary habits. And that's assuming we don't just double-down on them when we've got an extra 20% space for pastures and agriculture if the tundra recedes.
The answer is actually really simple, it's just that 75% of humanity would not be happy. Humans need meat to survive, we are omnivores. And being an omnivore doesn't mean you could just live off one or the other, it means you need both to survive and be healthy. Growing meat and farming responsibility, just eating less beef, pork or chicken should be what we're doing right now already. I love a good steak like any other, but the fact of the matter is the reality is cruel, and that you have to rob a life of a future to live another day. I don't support giant meat industries, companies like those trick common folk into thinking that we need to eat meat more than we need to, and gaslight you into feeling like meat animals are objects, and that it's alright to treat them as such. If people respected their food more, our climate literally wouldn't be as bad is it is now.    Also stop having so many kids. Too many humans. Simple as that too.  ' But 0rthrus! You can't tell people they can't have children! It's the right to life! '  Adopt, or have one kid.  If you think about it, humans are no different from bacteria. They devour everything they can and flourish, and when things run dry, they die off.  Unless a freak Asteroid obliterates the earth or some other disaster,  we will make ourselves extinct. At the very least genetically bottleneck us until we all look like club-footed goblins.  Thank you for coming to my TED talk, like and subscribe, and have a great day!
The problem is meats are highly subsidized than Plant-based foods. This is very hard for the people with low income. The choices are like " be healthy and eco-friendly but starve later, or just buy meat so you can have more food to eat for the next days.
Thank you for this video.
the fart o meter killed me !!! hehehee ,, but now i want steak,... from my BBQ dammit ITS 4 IN THE MORNING
Hey I idea why don't you do it and de-extinction video and why it could be good for the Earth or bad anyone else agree that this would be a very good video to watch
back in the days everyone ate meat . you wouldnt say no , meat made you strong and healty .. but people changed , they wanted to be diffrent , more loved .. brag that they are better than the rest .. well , i just eat what i want .. and if im bad..shame on you , we do this for hundred of years
These animations are so fun to watch even if the information is inaccurate.
Can't even process the problems faced by developed countries. There are around a million other problem that they don't even think of.
Watching this while I workout… education n fitness babyyyyt
Was vegan for 7 years. It just does not work. Meat heals. People blaming animal products for our poor health fail to take into account that most of what people eat are PLANTS, plant oils, etc.
I don’t care if I get hate for this: Veganism isn’t the correct and final solution to stop the over demand of meat and the meat industry. Veganism overall isn’t environmentally helpful nor does it acknowledge its huge faults of the diet and practices. The main issue isn’t the consumption of meat, the issue is the industry itself. Meat,dairy, and eggs are a big part of first for many people and are needed in many circumstances (like kids essentially have to eat meat in their early years). We must slow down the demand, promote a healthy lifestyle that is a balance of both meats and veggies ( and the other parts of the dietary needs). I’m literally tired of people trying to push Veganism as a end all be all of this issue when it also causes issues for the planet as well. If y’all want to be vegan that’s fine and it’s your choice, but to ignore the actual problems of Veganism as a whole and try to push that meat abs other animal products are not needed, and it’ll help the environment is ignorant. I’ll say this for those you are extreme meat eaters as well. This is a complicated issue that cannot be solved by one thing.
I’ll stop eating meat when I’m already 6 feet under It’s too delicious to pass up….
Also i love your video there so intertating
Hey kurzgesagt I got a question what if we use lightning as our power source and how much can it power our things.
Just eat less of everything. We are the problem. Eat meat, just less. Simple
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old” just think abt that
8:14 stonks lol cant believe he made that easter egg
Congratz on 17m
No
All this meat talk makes me want a burger lol. JK
I am going to eat meat now
Wow, the incredibly skewed framing at 9:34 is what disgusts me about MSM today. Really unfortunate that Kurzgesagt would take part. That's an unsubscribe for me.
Eat meat fine Don't Eat meat fine  Just stay out of each others faces and keep it to yourself
I love the fact that you guys say you have an "objective" opinion but you miss soo many important facts, not only that but your so called "facts" paint a completely different picture from reality........ one thing I will point out is that cows and other animals eat crops waste that we humans can't eat if we don't feed it to animals it will cause more issues (Landfills and more damage to the environmen)  P.s I know you need money and shit, that's why you made this video but come on plz for the love of God when jumping into a new topic use your brains
Ready for that vegan teacher to make a video reacting to this
Beef free sounds easy enough for me!
You will eat the bugs
Why was the thumbnail changed?
I find potatoes to be my favorite plant to eat. You can cook them in dozens of ways, they contain most of the nutrients vital to our diet, and can easily have flavor added to them with spices and salts. Try them mashed with cheese, onion/onion powder, and a little bit of salt. Youll be shocked at how quick a bland food can be tasty as hell.
Short answer: some meats are bad 4 u
Lol. This charts are bullshit. If we stop beef consumption we would have to produce 3x more chicken to feed everyone. If we stop eating chicken we would have to produce 10x fish to feed everyone. If we stop eating animals we would have to produce 100x crops to feed everyone. So the carbon levels would be at the same level. Doesn't make sense.
When you changed the thumbnail, I got excited that you actually released a different video counterintuitivley talking about the benefits of the meat industry along with the video titled meat love where you talked about the drawbacks, kind of like what you did with the nuclear energy videos a while back. I wish you could make another pair of affirmative-negative debate videos again, that would be interesting.
meat is great and all the entitled veggies are wrong.  just go doctor and ask for diet not youtube people
If you want to eat meat, would hunting it yourself be the best way to source it sustainably? My brother in law hunts elk and deer, and it seems like only one animal is feeding his family of 6 for months
I'm calling BS. There's no way the energy and co2 emissions required to process, ship, and process and ship again ALL the ingredients of vegiburgers is significantly less than the energy and co2 required to process an equal amount of beef. Their ingredient lists look like CVS receipts!
Okay then... Please tell me what the effect would be if cattle were to become extinct. Beef is one of the more nutrient-rich meats, and for all the dairy products they make... cattle certainly seem unreplaceable at this point. Let's really think about this and the better possible future ways for us as a species, and the condition of our planet for future generations. (yes I will shoot every lasts cow in the solar system if it would help... jokes)
What about the animals? What about their lives? Should we consider everything on this planet as resources?  It would be better if humans die due to global warming.
Super informative, our only hope is more people caring about the planet we are living on.
Lies,lies,lies, all lies,they just want you to stop eating meat because Bill Gates and his other technocrat friends are making synthetic garbage highly processed fake meat like beyond meat etc, this is all propaganda so they can convince you and choose to eat their plastic fake meat,made in the lab,that makes more polution than the cows farting,I mean really,you must be an idiot to believe that cows polute more than all cars in the world,airplanes,ships,humans, that's no science,that's indoctrination,It's been debunked that cow lie for years,but they still say it's true,but anyway if they convinced people about the fake cervesa virus and take the jab made in less than a year and all the booster shots,what can't they make people believe.
I love the bird animations. Cute.
Where is meat love lol
Even if eating meat and animal products was literally better for the environment (which it isn't), I still wouldn't. It's simply evil what's done to those animals, that have the ability to perceive what's going on around them and can feel emotions, just like our pets. What's done to 70 billion animals a year just for fleeting mouth pleasure is the most monsterously evil shit imaginable. And the only reason it exists is because people pay for it, rather than just paying for plant based alternatives. The slavery animals experience at the hands of humanity is utterly abhorrent
Carbon isn't the main problem, the sun is having a much bigger effect on climate. Very entertaining video though 🤷
0:04 incel kurzgesagt
Cows themselves are methane neutral. 100% of the methane they expel was taken from the environment and then put back. The same is true of water, cows put back over 90% of the water they drink, and we put back the rest all as urine
Its not animals or food that cause climate change… it is us who cause climate change… human population has grown to size that is unsustainable to rely on any food or produce sustainable food… now i see a reason behind THANOS cause trying to wipe out 50% of population … earth will recover in a matter of 100 years without us….
This video should be retitled "Is Meat Really that Bad [For the Environment]?  The meat industry has more issues than just environmental when it comes to percieved "goodness" - Even disregarding the most common moral aspects (cruel conditions, killing animals for food at all) the industrial use of antibiotics breeds resistant bacteria and todays industrial keeping of animals is a breeding ground for viruses that eventually mutate to cross over to humans. (Hence swine flu etc)  They quite literally double function as pandemic farms.
Wow never heard such a huge amount of cherry picking and misdirections.   Ruminants who graze on pastures help fertilise and ultimately sequester carbon, more than they emit. It’s the lack of ruminant grazing that makes the fauna sick, die and let the carbon go back into the atmosphere. Get your facts right.
“Saving the planet” will be done by technology and not people giving shit up. Few of us are willing to give up anything.
The real problem is- objectively -the human population+the standard of living being "most comfort" instead of stability
What happened to the hearts eyed cow?
Hang on a minute Did you calculate how much farmland would be needed to sustain a Vegan diet if everyone switched to it? How much farmland would be needed to sustain such a diet worldwide?
What happened to the other meat video? I thought it was green
A good movie that covers this topic is "kiss the ground" it's on Netflix
"Does buying locally mater?" Yes, because local people have jobs then.  Also, ultimately the problem comes not from eating one thing or the other, but rather someone in power forcing the rest of us to eat how they decide. No one should have that kind of authority.
Dislike
you forgot to mention the unnecessary cruelty associated with any industrialised meat production. meat is murder. thank you for coming to my ted talk.
After cv I have no interest in food , Also in America They give all the animals antibiotics and I’m allergic to those so it makes me sick
"Who cares about the planet? Im just here to fuck and eat and have a shit ton of kids!" -an overwhelming majority of people
Please rename this video "Circumlocution"  This video was a waste of my time. It's the worst kind of lecturing by a boring parent who thinks they know it all that you'll ever get.
Well since food occupies 26% of the global chart and the meat an even smaller porcentage wouldnt be more reasonable to fix the other 74%?  I mean no matter how much meat or plants we eat or how we change our diet the other 74% will still have a bigger impact and im pretty sure that would be a lot more easy to change
What a fantastic ad placement for Skillshare, Kurzgesagt!!
at 26% we would use up our carbon budget by 2100, or in 80 years. so at 4 times that rate it should be about 20 years? eesh.
I was just recently discussing with a friend how with all the tech that's straight out of scifi we've achieved, the one thing that would completely change the human experience isn't really space colonization or teleportation or whatever, but Star Trek's replicators. I'd be genuinely interested in your thoughts on the plausibility of such technology and what impacts it would have on humanity if achieved.
I will never stop eating meat, in fact i will eat more meat
I will never eat bugs
Amazon deforestation next pls
Yo make a video about removing the US, China and India from earth. explaining why It would reduce the global gas emision for like a 87%.
I want to send this to all my friends and family but I know it will start a fight xD Just hoping people find this information themselves... I'm so tired of arguing climate change with meat-eaters
So plant-based is the answer how come I don’t see a million comments saying that?
One thing I would really like to see studied in climate change is the impact of old age and dependancy. Old people are huge consummers of services, especially healthcare, with limited contribution to society, and often hold conservatives worldviews that make change more difficult, if not impossible, in a democracy. I know I would gladly give away 20 years of life expectancy to counterbalance meat consumption (though I mostly eat pork and poultry already).
“Demonising cows”?  Factory farming is the most demon like thing humans do to those living beings. Meat production is unethical to both animals and humans
8:08 is that mr avocado?
I was recommended this after a "happy meat farms" video and I'm super creeped out
Bad is a subjective view meaning meat is good, obviously!
I am sad by watching this video... I live on a dairy farm and my whole life is here.. people already bash us about wellfare of animals but now also that they are so bad for climate change, I don't know why but this video makes me just more sad..
i wonder how many people didnt watch the meat good and only meat bad :D
Interesting how the thumbnail changed to something completely opposite to what it originally was
i am the science
I'm glad it's better than the last meat video withch was so one sideded and horrible and they should delete and burn it from the planet forever because we are ment to eat meat and thats that. but I also dissagree on the conflics of global warming, the core is what heats up the surface, not the stuff on the surface, just glad it's better than the last one.
I don't love food and look for alternatives for just consuming what nutrients i need for the day like calories, protein, minerals and vitamins... this is how i view nutrient paste in game. why are people like this?
did you change the thumbnail of the video from a cow with heart eyes to a cow with fire behind em?
So basically, nothing will change. Good.
"Is Meat Really that Bad?" If you had an honest title; ie: "Is Meat Really that Bad for the climate?" I wouldn't have watched the video.
I eat meat to preserve life diversity in the world
WE ARE HERBIVORE. CULTURAL PROGRAMMING CANNOT STOP EDUCATION FROM ALLOWING HUMANS TO EVOLVE BACK TO THE TRUTH OF WHAT WE WERE CREATED TO BE.
Everytime I hear someone talking against meat consumption, I eat the double of meat just to make sure the meat industry gets stronger.
Sounds like the logical conclusion about beef is that we should only be eating about 30% of what we do now.
This was rather disappointing, skipping on many of the major discussions of recent times regarding the methodologies that lead to the numbers that were used to compare the environmental impact of different foods. There are huge implications just in that that can change the entire picture, so we need to put a lot more emphasis to clarify what we are comparing. Without methodological differentiation, this is just another biased clip among thousands of others.
"beef stonks"
Whats tour fave food??
pass me da boyga im goin IN
Bro they didn't take into account the fact that, once shipped across the ocean, it still requires a truck to actually bring the food to market. Kurzgesagt is such a joke.
Oh I see Democrats at work here. Don't listen to these wackos. Unsubscribing!
What about the YouTube channel "what I've learned". He made a very compelling case on why meat is not a big problem, and I would really like to hear your thoughts on it.
"It's complicated" should be the name of the channel.
Solution: let’s not make more humans. Let’s die out.
The facts! Thanks!
People dont understand that in order to get the same amount of minerals and nutrition as one steak they need to eat so much tofu and vegetables which inturn would increase the production of those things leading to more greenhouse gasses. Yes, vegetables and tofu does produce less green house emissions but it also has far less crucial nutrients like vitamin b12, selenium, zinc, and iron. Also those vitamins in vegetables are absorbed poorly by your body compared to beef and animal protein. Thats why I suggest we try our best to increase human, grass and pasture fed animal meet into our diets. And with more people only consuming those type of cows farmers will figure out a way to scale the production of those kinds of meats.
Meat love to meat hate In The thumb nail
The more CO2 the faster plants grow. the faster plants grow, the higher CO2 absorption. It is proven scientifically. Not in a "I'm a geoligist, therefore i know everything" kind of way.  Normal study, normal, repeatable result, and to add to it 2 kinds of observations, that proves theory. and it links with another's researcher's topics- because plant grow faster now we get less nutriens from meals, than we used to.  Plus there are some geologist that proves that we produce less or the same amount of carbon footprint than earth itself, but they are overshouted by a "We have apocalypse!!!" gen z people.  So carbon footprint is just a scheme to scare people into buying pricier things, that normally they wouldn't even think off. you think it isn't? look at Greta Thunberg, and other kids that did the same thing, because, yes there was more than one of those. Many more before Greta. and now look who is behind Greta, who supports her. Oh, green-people. the same ones that forces your goverment to pay more for solutions they didn't even knew they needed. And they pay it out of your taxes. So next time you chew on something that is eco-friendly, remember- you've paid arleady for this product by your taxes, so you are paying for this product twice.
About the land argument, can't we simply plant trees in the animals' area? If the concern lies of them consuming the sapling, protect it by fencing it, till the time the sapling grows to a certain age.  This way more than 25% land can be used for trees.
I like how before the thumbnail was "Meat Love" and now it's "Meat Hate"
Bye-bye meat. It was nice having known you.
What bothers me is the video’s focus on beef, which is obviously the most inefficient form of protein, and suggesting those numbers are comparable to chicken, goats, fish, or even insect proteins. I get needing to keep the video short for YouTube, but it comes off as very misleading.
Eating animals is not the problem. We just need to reduce the human population by 90%. It's a topic most don't want to discuss but the main problem is overpopulation. Less people would end poverty, hunger and significantly reduce global warming. Everyone could have nice things and live a comfortable life.
When you get the just eat burger advert before the video…
to make a complete protein you need to eat lean red meat.  also, during ice age people developed hemachromatosis because of lack of red meat.
the closest we have got to a like/dislike ratio is like/comments ratio.  of course if the video has the comments deactivated we have got next to nothing.
0:03 what about.... you know...😏
What about fish??????
Yeah, still like beef, still will support local. CO2 emissions are not a priority for me, human ingenuity will find better solutions to adapt to any climate change.
Another thing that we must worry about though is human health from a change in diet like that.   Cutting down on animal products would also entail intaking more plant based products such as soy and refined seed oils, both of which have negative impacts on one's health over extended periods of consumption.
watching as i eat a beef sandwich >.>;;;;
Watching it while eating a delicious beef burger. I won't stop eating meat :)
You dont have to go vegan straight. Stop judging yourself. eat one less meat meal a week is a change.
Can we use my comment as a dislike button?
Another note about grass fed livestock that a lot of people forget: they compete with native wildlife. Cattle ranching is the primary barrier to reintroducing wolves, mountain lions, and other predators in the American West and other spots worldwide. The cattle also compete with grazing animals like deer, elk, and bison
It's so amazing!👊🏼 Go Vegan!🇧🇷🌱
How about some videos about body hormones?
I'll stick to meat. Technology should and will resolve climate problems
why did they change the thumbnail
Ay yo
Good video. I think people should eat less beef at least.
This was good info thanks for making it! I must add, (this is not popular) but from my background in science as well as the many scientists in my family.  "if we humans were not here we would have almost the same CO2 as it does right now". We barely chance anything even with our major output. One Volcano going off as it did in Hawai 2 years ago puts out hundreds of times more than all humans... My Point is. We should be asking "what level are we actually impacting these things" Of course We do need to be responsible and help clean our water and air from pollution. But Pollution is a different thing than talking about C02 and heating the planet. Pollution is the real issue we should be looking at with things like this. Ruining land or air or water. That is the big thing! We barely impact the C02 of the world. We also had a whole lot more C02 during the Dinosaurs they loved it. (by the way, temperatures were lower) and (humans were not even there).  These are things that make some people feel annoyed talking about because it's not the "mainstream" but these are the facts and if you don't know these you should go and study! =D Again Great video thanks for making it Kurzgesagt you put some good info out for some of these theories.
vegans : what is this holy grail you speak of
*EAT MORE BEEF*
Gotta love how the video's thumbnail was "meat love" with a happy cow when it was released, but today they changed it to "meat hate" with an angry cow lol
Did this change from meat love to meat hate?
Basically we're fucked, so why give a damn ?
Im allergic to beans and chicken and when I tried a veggie patty it tasted good but I had an allergic reaction. Pretty sad but the only meat I can eat with dietary restrictions is beef.
Its really simple. Buy best expensive beef, and eat it at occasion. Remove beef from daily diet.
Why did the thumbnail change from "Meat Love" to "Meat Hate"
why I raise my own meat, 0 transport, raise only enough to meet my and my families needs, just because they're food doesn't mean they don't deserve respect, so they get pets and cared for as more then just an object, so happy, healthy cared for and no suffering, just the way I like my meat! (sheep for those wondering, fairly easy to manage and care for)
9:21... so in 100 years those forests that dont exist can absorb 800 bil tons of co2, but we generate 50 bil tons per year... so in 100 years we generate 5.000 bil tons of co2, and the forest can only absorb 800 bil tons... that's not good... we dont even have those forests and we are still cutting...
I like how the video thumbnail was changed from “meat love” to “meat hate”
Fun FAct Most Aniamls in countries has no right!
800 billion tons CO2 vs 50 billion, oh by the way the 800 billion is over 100 years, and the 50 is per year .... say what ??
Ephesians 6:10-18 New International Version The Armor of God 10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.  18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people.
I won't eat beef tonight. But I will certainly eat beef some other day!
Great video!
Looking at the physical absorption  spectra  the window of infrared to space absorbed by methane is much smaller than that for CO2, so why is methane said to be more powerful?
So, I like meat. But I don't like where most meat comes from (factory farms etc.) But I didn't want to stop eating meat. So my thought was, what's the most ethical way to get meat? Hunting. Deer are plentiful where I live (bordering on over-population), and grouse are plentiful as well. Wild hogs are also a good source, and you're helping reduce invasive species. I've reduced the amount of meat I eat, and what meat I do eat is wild. And the cost savings are pretty nice as well.
I find it hard to believe that shipping 1kg of beef locally generates 18kg of CO2.  The fuel put in the truck does not even weigh that much and there is some ton of cargo.  That seems to be over estimate by a factor of thousand.  What am I missing?
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed everyday"  Chronic Masturbators would like a word with you
Wish i could dislike this vid
@Kurzgesagt - maybe you will consider a video about energy usage and CO2 production to sustain energy for the internet? According to some research around 10% of global energy consumption goes to power the internet network and we use it mainly to post some very stupid videos on the internet which no one watches (It's not about your videos as yours made a huge impact - but I think it is a valid problem to power the huge data houses of google, amazon or microsoft)
Hey Kurzgesagt, I am a fan and a supporter since the first days. Thanks for diving into this topic which is indeed emotional and risky. When you said it's complicated, I was hoping you will indeed refer to all the "dimensions" of the meat issue.. However, I didnt really see anything about animal cruelty, killing the animals, risk for people that consume meat for cardiovascular deseases and many more... So I feel it is a bit misleading when you are "forcing" a decision for a burger without giving them all the information.  Again thanks for the video, and hope you elaborate on this one. Always my most enjoyable minutes of the day when you post a new video, thanks!
What about insects? I don't have a problem in going hakuna matata
Earth is getting too small. Vertical farming, lab-grown meat, water desalination (from clean energy ofc) would solve a lot of problems. Colonizing Mars or the Moon too I guess, but the tech needed to do it is the same (99% recycling, water reuse, indoor farming...).
Just eating less beef is healthier, and more enjoyable when you eat it, and help the environment without depriving yourself from tasty food and protein
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day" well, exept for the secks, whick I have  many times a day, with many different women, all at once.
Meat is not suitable for 8 billion population. We are peaking towards 12 billion . Imagine problem.
When the narrator says "over half of cereals are used to feed livestock" my dumb ass though for a second that the cows were just horking down Lucky Charms all day.
Only real fans remember the o.g thumbnail.
Why no mention of the Carbon cycle?  Animals aren't getting their carbon from fossil fuels, they get it from the atmosphere via the plants they eat.
Thumbnail change? Ahh...We all know Hatred sells better than Love in this modern era.
I’m tired of people forcing there ways on other. I respect that you don’t eat meat. Please respect others. Or don’t expect respect yourself.
Meat love or meat hate?
Loads of wastes from food used by humans are recycled as feed for cows, like soy leftowers after making oil.
Love how the title went from "Meat love" to "Meat hate"
can we get more astronomy videos?
China is producing more emissions than the entire developed world combined. I'm not going to forgo eating my unprocessed meat, while very little attention is given to the issue as a whole. This is a world problem, and my country (the UK) is supposedly only responsible for only 1.1%. I'm not going to live a miserable lifestyle so that more plastic junk can be manufactured.
food is the best thing about life but dosnt overreating shorten your lifespan?
Alright let's just die, end of story... shrugs
I like how non biased this channel is honestly. Doesn’t demonize any opinions. My opinion is that we need a happy medium with animal products, but I have a hard time believing it will ever happen, companies have money which is power, and everyone is opinionated to the point where you have to be radical one way or another or your opinion doesn’t matter if it ever even did to begin with.
Eating a burger while watching this :P
This video video waa a poor attempt at explaining the role of meat and its contributions to global warming. It's unfortunate because it is an issue that does need to be explained.
thats it im shutting out beef in my diet
The only problem of this video - it doesn’t cover is it safe for human exclude meat from the ration. You will need to eat much more grass to have the same equivalent of energy or protein. Ad looking at some vegan activists rejecting meat looks dangerous for mental health too.
Where are cheese, milk and eggs in this ?
Nice video. I would be happy to have a video on economic science and degrowth
I mean I know what I enjoy multiple times a day, and it never gets old.
Killing an animal for taste while you can live off plants really well is inhumane. It is as simple as that. If you cant understand is your taste buds are over powering your morality. Its not that complicated.
If you were bought into this life to be eaten one day how would you feel?
This video has persuaded me to stop eating beef
It's not the "meat" It's the humans who engineers animals forcing them to grow like crazy rate making them like fast-food quick to harvest.
You don't need to give up the taste and texture of meat- there are NEW meat products EVERYDAY that account for the meat taste, no need to lose culture or comfort over a change in your diet.  TRY THE NEW STUFF! Just try it, it's practically the SAME. (just no actual meat)
What about converting the methane produced by cows to energy?
Are you sure about that?
People need to care about themselves before before they can care about others, or the world. This place is beautiful for us, that's why we're special. People need to start taking care of themselves like they're their own mom and dad. Love yourself!!! You deserve it!!!
Thumbnail looks like if Kurzgesagt designed a Pink Floyd album
Humanity's epitaph: went exctinct because they refused to stop eating beef
You vill eat ze bugs
Previous Thumbnail: Meat Love (Happy Cow) New Thumbnail: Meat Hate (Angry Cow)
All dislikes are from the sensitive vegans.
Anyone notice the monkey in the intro holding a tiny cow?
climate change is a global problem that need global scale of action to take impact in what ever aspect is it green energy or change ur diet it will not have any significant change if we do it in small numbers that's why meeting like COP26 is needed to do something in a global scale, but as long as the global leader priorities ego above all nothing will change.
Curious to know wich thumbnail got more views. The "Meat love" one or the "Meat hate" one.
How do you guys create this animation?
bird: I JUST WANT A BURGER WHY DID YOU HAVE TO CHANGE MY ENTIRE PERSPECTIVE OF MEAT
This is terrible news people
I guess we’re not going to address the ethical implications today
but some parts of the plant-based foods we eat cannot be consumed by humans, like the stalks of corn. So if we were to get rid of meat then we would also have lots of wasted food.
Three words: Lab Grown Meat
Press Here :- Dislike button.
How about 1% and corpos stop flying their private jets?
Im growing canines in the back of my mouth...so im inclined to say...no...
Very nice overview but the video does not take into account how much of the produced beef is actually wasted with supermarkets throwing them away! By now i would assume the food or beef industry should have known the daily/weekly/monthly/yearly consumption patterns of people in different regions n countries to optimize their beef production. I will not be surprised if a significant number of emissions is actually a result of a poor food management processes and a sub-optimal control feedback loop between production and consumption.
Do people think the Earth is the perfect temperature now (pretty lucky if so) or do they think if emissions were making the Earth colder that would be a good thing?
0:37 the world in a nutshell
You guys didn't jump the shark, you nuked the fridge.....  It's been fun but audios!
*_The way they changed thumbnail..._*
I watch this video on repeat 14 times so far and I am still going
well made video
Thumbnail was originally: "meat love" with a young cow and love symbol on his eyes.   4 days later  (now it's meat hate, with an evil cow)
The best meat can actually has a negative carbon footprint due to the soil the Cow graises on absorbing more carbon
Besides it's impact, it would be nice to consider that animals are sentient beings, and that they are not here to be used as resources for humans.
Yo solo sé que comer un asado de carne sin aguacate no es comer 😁
no eat then, kill all humans ..
Seems a little short-sighted to not include food waste’s part in this pie. From what I understand, most of our methane emissions in the food industry come from wasted food, not cow farts.
I love how the thumbnail changed from "Meat love" to "meat hate"
As much as I really like these videos and this channel, I feel like the thumbnails have been getting a bit clickbait-y lately. As a creator, I know that the algorithm can be a pain sometimes, but recently the thumbnails have just felt... off... not the normal Kurzgesagt style... just been in my head recently.
I saw a video of a trigger fish biting one leg after another off a lobster.  It couldn't eat the main body in the shell, so it left the legless lobster to suffer and eventually die.  After that, I never again felt bad about how people fill and cook lobsters.  Nothing we do compares to the brutality of nature.
It is very painful to know that climate change has reached unavoidable level.
Hmm, wonder which grain is the worst and if said grain is used to feed cattle... hmm...
i want to know what would happen if mars had an atmosphere
Thx for the info bird man
I hope you put Arabic caption
Enjoying the food I like is 77% of my existence
I simply love how ironic it is, every video or discussion about climate changes always come to Brazil at some point. The truth is nobody wants to understand jack about Brazil and most people even believe we speak Spanish here. Sure, we have most of the Amazon florest (60%), but it extends to 9 countries that gets the other 40%, with some having little to no political movement to protect it. As brazilian I'll give my most honest opinion: the strongest economic stimulus Brazil receives from the world is to farm your food. Want to really help Brazil to protect Amazon? Stop buying food from brazilian farms. It'll reduce the need for more space for farming and we'll start focusing in industry. Do you know Brazil sell a lot of minerals and buy the products simply because we have not enough industry to benefit those minerals into the subproducts? But no, we are not all forest here as some might believe out there. São Paulo is the biggest economy center in South America, with solid industrial production and representing most of the country revenues. People should really try to know Brazil and stop treating us just as Amazon, that could start the needed revolution to change what most believe as needed to change.
You touched on a lot about animal agriculture, but have you seen how detrimental some crop production is? You should make a comparison video. A quick example is the avocado industry. In Peru they destroyed the natural habitat, take the natural water (which is extremely scarce in the regions) and reroute it to the avocado tree farms. Avocado trees use up more water than almost any crop, and now that they are so popular the local population has decided to destroy most of the native land by causing draught, killing all the natural surrounding predatory animals and then releasing non native grazers that destroy the last remaining native vegetation trying to withstand the avocado farm draughts. It seems disingenuous to take a stance that meat alone is the worst when there are countless crop examples that are just as bad to the health of the planet. I'm all for fixing the problems, Ima say it now, with the amount of hydroponic technology and research the future seems pretty good on more efficient hydroponic operation designs (like vertical farms). The only issue is we can only grow select cultivars with hydroponics as of now, mostly leafy greens, herbs and only a few fruits/veggies.  Also, veganism would never work I'm sorry to be the one to say it. Even "herbivores" eat animals from time to time to makes sure their nutrient requirements are met, and to have a sustainable amount of nutrients from crops alone would means most land we would theoretically free up from getting rid of animal farms would just have to be giant monocultures of crops for us to eat instead.
0:04 well, uhmm, uhhhhh…
Not even fully giving up meat eating, but just everyone cutting down and not having meat for literally breakfast lunch and dinner would do so much to save emissions and more importantly (IMO) drastically improve everyone’s health.
I don't remember how many videos you guys made about this topic but they all have some missing information. Like, humans too do burp, fart and poop and there is near to 10 billion people living on earth. More than that there is also fish farms. We humans cause most of the green house gas emissions with fossil fuel consumption and etc., sure. But these must be taken into consideration too. I'm sure that in the near future, meat and dairy products from the animals will be mostly replaced with meat and milk produced in labs.
FINALLY
You left out a couple of important points. Number one is that we are still coming out of the last ice age. If there were no humans the planet would still be getting warmer. The plains used to be full of bison instead of crops. Satellites have shown that South America was once covered in a vast civilization instead of jungle. The Sahara was also one green until it was buried in sand from a tsunami or similar event.
Might or could be, but at this age and my flavor savor, not going to change.
Holy fkk you changed the thumbnail lmao
Yummy
Me watching and nodding along while munching on tripple patty beef burger: "Why, yes! We should all do better." ***Om, nom, nom, nom***
I really liked how you display the information here the only thing I would add it is the fact that the pasture land is not used as efficiently as possible currently if rotational grazing became a common practice we could raise WAY more cattle on much less land. Also the land used would capture more carbon than single pasture systems due to having more foliage growing and less compact root systems. Love the video!
I  like that you mentioned that if we eat less beef pasture can be turned into forests or natural grasslands which sequester CO2.  But you didn't mention that the same land also sequester CO2 when it was used for pasture. With that in mind does it really matter in terms of sequestered CO2 if there are cows or not on the land?
awesome video! quick question: how much does seasonality affect the emissions? Like is there significant difference between eating strawberries in winter vs. summer? Thanks!
This is a weapon for vegetarians and vegans 😈
So being a vegan is worse than eating meat. Nice
By the way, these kind of video content is already quite a lot in Youtube. You guys talk about "Why" like "Why eating meat was bad" and its turn out that you give a number such like 60kg of Carbon,  raising animal like beef need xxx amount of wheat and other things.  But altough i support the thing to "eat less or no meat", i still found this video is quite a conspiracy, because all you guys talking was about "Why" and never about "How".  How can raising a cow/beef use up to xxx litre amount of water, xxx Kg of food, and emits xxx Kg of Carbon??? The thing is, all that you saying is a number without showing us the calculation. So when you debate it with people who love meats or can be more critical thinking, your video doesnt afford us enough information to win that argument. How can you say planting and making a Tofu emits less Carbon?? where did the calculation came from?  And as for Avocados, wasnt nowdays in some countries (i forgot the country name), planting Avocados already making so much problem, since it was also too much planted (no other things there, only Avocados) just like Soy (all Soy in one place, and no other thing).  All i say is that you need to provide new information, like "How"???
The cows will decide your fate after this
I know what you did
I need that Kurzgesagt button in real life.
I would like to request Kurzgesagt to do an analysis about the % of preserved forests in all countries in the world, because it doesn't seem fair to point out Brazil as the big villain, as they have 61% of their entire territory still preserved, and reaching up to 80% of preserved forests in the amazon biome. I would like to see a unbiased pissing contest that truly show what other countries are doing when it comes to preserve and feed their population and neighbor countries. Just throwing out an idea ;)
I liked the other thumbnail with the heart eyes
*EAT ANIMALS!!* - Get the word out!
Honestly, you don't have to become a vegetarian (overnight). You can also just... eat less meat. Or give up beef. I am generally very much against blaming individuals for climate change rather than companies, but when it comes to food I do think that consumers can make a difference.
Only 0.12% of the atmosphere is man-made CO2, it's nothing.
This was a good topic. But, there was a lot of information left on the cutting room floor, I think. First and foremost, the local delivery emissions has nothing to do with your diet. You will have to go to the store for the food, and the food has to be shipped to your store anyway. I assume buying local meant farmer's market. Which is nice if you don't live in a food desert. As far as beef emissions, ranchers and ag scientists are working on that. Feeding kelp to cows has shown a lot of promise in reducing methane. Other methods are being investigated as we speak. Also, lab grown meat, which is very near on the horizon as a consumer product, was not mentioned. But, the biggest killer of all people going vegan is the simple fact that a good portion of the population in the US CAN'T go vegan. Or even vegetarian. Because those protein sources are much more expensive than cheap meats. To replace the protein in 100 grams of beef, you would need to eat 590 grams of quinoa. Simply put, poor people can't afford to go vegan. Especially in the food deserts so prevalent in the US. Whole Foods doesn't set up shops in the poor areas, but McDonald's sure does.   And, to round this whole conversation off, let's not forget that most of the world's emissions comes from only the top 100 corporations. I'll give up the beef once people convince those corporations to emit less than raising food.
No climate change argument can separate me from my beef. No may in a million years
Vegetarians are best
beef stonks
Wait a second, food never gets old for you guys? I HATE eating. If I could stop forever I would. FUCK being limited by the need to feed and shit it out afterwards.
Lmaooooo vengan propaganda
Bro the thumbnail and title of this video went through the 5 stages of grief. lmao
A problem with their point that they don't bring up. That grain used to feed animals is typically hardier varieties that can grow in more places than crops that feed people. Meaning that farmland still couldn't be converted to food production. The shear logistical problem of changing global diets is a massive problem as some of the highest emissions In meat and dairy production come from counties that are already food unstable. The vast amount of jobs lost and the inability to compensate the food production are important factors. People should eat less meat but ultimately this argument is a distraction from the real problem; fossil fuels. It's even pushed by the fossil fuel industry to take the target off their back. And it's used by conservatives to make people look like crazies. Focusing on fossil fuels is by far more important if we want real reductions. Nuclear energy and green energy grids are the things that will actually drastically reduce emissions. There are only marginal gains to be made in food production and we plain need food.
We have Both MOlar and Canine teeth for a reason
Well, it seems that the video in favor of beef of the channel What I've Learned was debunked.
This is why I substitute much of my family’s beef with wild deer. Legally hunted, processed and packaged by my local butcher. We use almost no store bought beef in our at home cooking.
I think it’s absurd that climate alarmists have people afraid of cows...
If its cooked Nicely meat isn't Bad. Meat gang
Moral of the video:eat more pork and chicken
The reason why the climate change grift shows up on this channel is because this guy receives lots of money from real life supervillain Bill Gates.
I don’t care if meat is bad, it tastes great. Don’t deny me food!
Let’s thank impossible burger and beyond meat for an amazing alternative, seriously, if anyone is trying to lean off meat and especially beef, it has gone leaps and bounds ahead of what a veggie “burger” used to be like
I guess vegetarian is the best
As a carnivore the way I offset my emissions is promote perks veganism for other people 🙃
Missing a HUGE part of the beef problem here. The University of Manitoba took on the task  of calculating how much water in total, including feed it takes to create beef for food  - the result -  1,590 gallons is needed per pound of beef. Its not just emissions that count.
i swear, i see the happy cow thumbnail on this a lot and ignore the vid, but after seeing a red cow thumbnail, i got curious because i wanted to know if im losing my mind.
Sounds like I need to eat more beef. I'm tired of cold winters.
I choose meat love!!  Steak is tasty and your not changing my mind.
Haven't had a steak for about 9 months. I think I'll have one to reward myself next week
Yes
Wait, there are people stupid enough to argue that eating meat causes climate change?!? Lmfao

Your personal carbon footprint is an irrelevant myth created by big oil
so PETA actually make it worse for environment
Indian sages knew this centuries they advised hindus not consume beef, British East India Company, started trend of consuming beef.
Looks like this video was sponsored by "Farms Here, Forests There". It demonstrates absolute ignorance of the way in which food is produced in Brazil. Please, put your prejudices aside and do more rigorous research before producing shit.
No one 'hates' meat, it's just that animal production is destroying the planet and depleting pure water sources everywhere. Go vegan and buy used only.
"People live to eat vs eat to live".
Did the thumbnail on this change? I thought it used to say "Meat Love?"
I'd they're worried about CO2 emissions. They should just take themselves out. No doubt humans themselves produce the most c02 during their lifespan. After all we produce food for a reason. Also even if we stop raising cows. There population won't go down. Imagine how much c02 the buffalo produced 300 years ago
no, its not.  next.
Methane is 40 times worse than carbon dioxide for the first 10 years it is in the atmosphere, then it turns into carbon dioxide and stays that way for hundreds of years.
Remember when the thumbnail said meat love
So what happens to all of the other things ruminates take care of for us that would now need to be thrown in landfills? Things like almond shells from your almond milk. Or cottonseed from making your clothes? Just freeing up the land is a shallow argument. And if we're worried about carbon emissions and space being freed up, why isn't anyone concerned about urban sprawl? Most of the people crying about cow farts live in giant houses in the suburbs and drive themselves everywhere, but they want to tell everyone else how bad their burger is.  This is the problem today. everyone thinks they have a solution to one problem not realizing that their solution causes a whole host of other problems that then need to be addressed. I mean, imagine what's going to happen when 7 billion people switch to drinking almond milk. That sure is going to mess with our native pollinator population as more non-native European honey bees get pumped in to pollinate all those trees. Not to mention that there is absolutely no way that we could feed this many people without the use of pesticides which the same people who hate meat also hate. This is far too complex of an argument to say that one single thing is bad and another single thing is good. We as humans need to be diversifying our diets as well as encouraging biodiversity in plants and animals, and try our best to make small improvements in areas where we know it makes a difference.
Im a youtuber
50% + of US farmland is there to feed the animals that we eat.
0:03 well.........
A kilo of beef vs a kilo of potatoes. The head of the Idaho potato board went on a potato only diet for 2 months. He was shocked at how much healthier he got. Cholesterol went down, blood pressure went down BMI went from overweight to normal weight , blood sugars went down. A kilo of potatoes could feed you for 3 days if necessary, maybe 4. A kilo of beef could maybe do 2 days. ?
I are of brasil and write brasil no Brazil
What about the carbon used to transport the food to those efficient cargo ships in the first place?
This video is arguably one of the most important you've ever done. Thank you!
animals convert inedible green into food : stem, shell, leaves (of crops or other plants) and or harsh areas, cold areas, desert areas, mountainous areas where other things are scarce but goats and etc. can thrive   but humans in wealthy areas should reduce meat consumption and junkfood
I would like to be vegan, but i just cant, i tried not to eat at least meat, but i like it soo much, i just can't , sorry planet.
A follow up on water usage would be very interesting!
I liked how in germany , the adult population of college decided to eat meat twice a week. I think it is good start.( correction between once or twice)
9:44 Why there is a T cell?
What about fish and ocean stuff?
Now we have the impossible Burger so don't worry
I'm curious how fishing stacks up to all of this?
I can stick to beef free diet. Pork and poultry are more than enough. Basically only removing beef gets 2/3 of enviromental benefits of going full vegan.
What can i do with this information?  Nothing.   I'm literally going to do nothing with this information.
Okay, here are no dislikes to see, as you tube hides these days the dislikes. I agree with this, as l think, if one dislikes something one should address why. I give the topic a dislike 👎.   Most people speak of animals, and how they are reared as products. That’s the fundamental difference as l perceive them, and treat them.  I see them as living, feeling, creatures like me, and l hate,  we decide,  how long the live, where they live, under what conditions they live, and how we manipulate their food, to use their meat as soon as possible, and shorten their life span at our will. Many babies of all kinds of different animals in different cultures are eaten before they are one year old, as their “meat”” is especially tender.   It is horrible in my view point, how we treat animals even as pets like for example dogs short lines on their neck, mostly totally controlled by us, when they can move, when they have company, when they are allowed to run. To me this is cruelty. Many dog owners leave their dogs more than 9 h alone at home. In some countries like South Korea, China dogs are versatile used, also raised for eating among other purposes like any other animals. In wet markets all fish, “sea food” are tortured alive in buckets, tanks, etc. where the are squeezed in on top of each other half alive,  and lobsters are alive tide up, and thrown alive in boiling water, dying slowly in the heat, as most people believe animals have no feelings, only because they cannot speak. Pigs scream in terror, when they sense they will be killed, and they try to escape, cows mourn, and cry loudly, when they are separated from their calfs, and If you would once dare to go into an abattoir you would probably not eat meat ever again. I have seen so much suffering of animals, while travelling the world, that l became a vegetarian. I am not a fanatic, and l do not lecture anyone, what to eat. I decided only for myself, and l am happy with my decision, and my lifestyle based on veggies, fruits, grains, nuts and so on, but l do not interfere with anyone else’s diet.   I just feel, we are beasts without any compassion apart of selfishness, and self pity. It is my conclusion after what l have witnessed, and seen in documentaries.
I love animals, they are delicious!😋
I'm eating meat.
I would love to hear about the role of aquaculture and sustainable fisheries in all this. I believe I've read newer findings that state with new aquaculture practices and technologies, aquaculture can be close to net neutral and sometimes net negative carbon emissions if done properly with certain fish. As an oceanography student I've been hearing murmurs of this for years
Say no to meat
What about genetic engineering? can we invent or alter a plant to store more co2?
Just because kurzgesagt is meat eater they need to hoax in somewhere to justify it.  09:06 beef free diet calculated with animal products (which most of them cant be done without cattle farms) in it just a hoax against whole vegan diet.
FAKE! why are you countering your Bill Gates Sponsored video?   Kurzgesagt: "Not really countering.. Just changing approach to better brainwash the blame for beef"
Best way to lower emitions from food is not by not eating beef, but by not producing so much and then throwing a shitload of it away! There needs to be a more reasonable quota for the production of stuff, otherwise everyone just makes stuff which is mostly thrown away as it is not needed to sustain people and is only made to overthrow other market share holders and switch the money flow from one conglomerate to another...
When did we get a demon cow?
I refuse to make sacrifices while big corporations and the U.S. military are allowed to shit all over our environment for profit. They'll destroy us whether I'm a vegan or not. Might as well get the most out of life while I can. After the big climate apocalypse, the earth will sort out whatever life is left, and start over. Maybe the civilization which arises then will be less deserving of annihilation than ours is.  Besides, the solution is clearly to reduce our population, not to reduce our quality of life just so we can keep breeding like rabbits.
If humanity eats mainly fruits from fruit trees, your argument about land being not good for agriculture isn't valid
I will never stop eating meat. Just nope. I'll eat myself if we run out of cows
For the meat YES. End of story.
ALSO 10%LAW
Thumbnail change   The past thumbnail: 🐄 😍  Present thumbnail: 🐄👿
this infographic butchers the concepts used by livestock production.  livestock are normally fed food waste products that cannot be processed or digested by humans. food waste like plant stocks, leaves, and other stuffs.
God I’m so glad I’ll already be dead when it comes the day I will no longer be able to buy a fucking sausage
I love it how they changed the thumbnail for a cow with hearts as eyes to a cow that looks like it just came out of a minute of halo 4 And also how the title on the thumbnail changed from meat love to meat hate Probably cause vertesism (idk how to spell the channel name) made a video on how changing the thumbnail can be good for views and the YouTube algorithm favour newer or changed videos over old ones which Is why most videos usually stop getting views after a week or so. Great video btw.
Ban on meat can increase the nutrients in diet
Only legends remember that the previous thumbnail was 'Meat Love'
"Abusus non tollit usum." The abuse of something cannot forbid its use. All this video shows is that we eat too much beef, not that we should completely stop eating it. It's industrial agriculture in its totality that should be put under trial, not only the meat industry. When you think about all the fruits and vegetables wasted (about 60%!) just because people want to eat only straight carrots and round tomatoes... Some say "we could feed the whole world if we stopped eating meat!". We could feed the whole world now if we reduced the wasteful way we are producing food! Both vegetal and animal.
3 days 3.6M 28k. A great correction that has been long awaited. Thats good.
When you are white... EVERYTHING is considered cool... But not everyone wastes food like them...
Eh regardless I’m eating it anyway
Human meat is pretty good
The thing is killing and torture is bad. Go cut your on hand and fry and eat. Would you like it if millions if you humans were slaughtered and you and your family were next? You may pass out at the sight of 100s of heads on the floor and as the person front of you gets his head cut. Small invonvcent babies and moms and Dads dieing.
Meat is usually Saran Wrapped with at most sticker on it. Some vegetables come with thick plastic snap close container for freshness & colorful describing the food.  Most meat on the market is a genetically modified meat. Meat built soully for the slaughter house. If these animals were released to nature they'd die almost instantly. No need for grazing thousands of acres.  Vegetables need a whole field to grow. A field that was once a populated woodland or forrest. Home to hundreds of species. Soy is also grown in mass to aid in growth of other crops. Soy has a unique capability to grow despite being covered in toxins and pesdicides. Soy genes are hybrided into your lettuce & tomatoes to ensure growth after being doused with dangerous neurotoxins.  Which if you don't wash, you ingest into your blood blood streams.
I’m not sure how significant this is however some of the grain and crops fed to animals aren’t safe for human consumption, I’m sure this will make a difference then again it’s hard to discuss everything, such as water usage and where the water would come from etc
Now imagine 2 billion chinese and indians start eating shitload of beef
Food is not the best thing in live .. getting high is ..
All we need now is a meat crop...
The thumbnail changed lol
Insane Leftist who made global warming into their new religion: Cow farts are bad for the environment...and what are you doing about it?  Me: I'm eating the cow.
Does replacing beef for soy protein help, or is it even worse? I live in Brazil. =(
I’ll keep eating meat, sorry guys
My solution is simple...we start putting vegetarians and those worried about global warming on the menu...their gluten free, right?
I'm sure this thump nail didn't look like that
Well Beef is the highest emissions animal but the reason for that is the number of them.Huge ranches in America, Australia and Argentina, bigger than some countries! What drives these huge numbers is not our need for beef but the sheer number of people. If the population was halved overnight, then the demand for beef would halve over night. So the real culprit of all emissions is us- the sheer bloody number of us. Scientists the world over say the Earth could support 3 billion people but right now we are at 7.5 billion-that says it all.
He missed a pretty big part about the amount of crops fed to cattle. Most of the crops grown for humans aren't edible in the first place so it would go to waste, but it is fed to cattle to avoid wasting it.
But vegetables take more space and we usually feed cows stuff that we cant eat
The only thing meat is bad is because it’s expensive
Sorry, but this isn't really a topic that works "In a Nutshell". This topic is way too complex and controversial for short YouTube videos.
Wouldn't the imported goods still need to be driven from the docks to the shops they're being sold at, making them generate the same amount if not more C02 emissions regardless?  Also good video, but I'm afraid I can't give up meat, its too culturally ingrained and replacing it with alternatives would be like erasing a part of my cultural identity, like asking people in Asia to stop eating rice because it generates methane.  I come from a rural area of my country, many dishes and traditions involve some meat because its what farmers had on hand since thousands of years ago, if other people that lack the cultural attachments to that type of food want to give it up its fine by me.
I like plant-based food but it's so hard to find any good products in most parts of the world so I then have to eat meat for it to be tasty...
vegan diet frees up 1 billion hectors more, but wouldn't it also require land to grow additional crops to fill in for the meat requirement which in turn affects that land in long term? would it be sustainable for that land? plus how economical is growing meat over growing crops? plus buying and feeding meat is more economical for me than any vegetables, little meat keeps me more full.
Idea: you know those flame towers in oil refineries where they burn off excess gas at the top? We could mount that on every cow to burn off the methane! I'd be in the front row for that show.
nice video
oh no i didn't save the original thumbnail
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive" After 3 seconds you lost me, what a record
•25% of carbon emissions are from Food •Beef is 150x more carbon intensive than potatoes (20x more than Tofu)
Ban beaf lol. just like  in Nepal and India. be hindu lol
0:03 There is anathor.
The key is to be patient. Climate predictions are scary when first published, because that generates the most revenue for mainstream media and the most funding for environmental causes. As time goes on though, the predictions get terminated without accountability of those who made it.  A new series of false predictions will be published. The way to handle any criticism about how people are denying the fact that all these climate predictions have been false in the same direction is to use mass media to label the other side as "deniers".
well shieet !
ok, now i definetelly go towards vegan diet
WILL YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MEAT! We are fucking omnivores, we need meat. No amount of bitching is going to change that. "It's all meats fault it's all fossil fuels fault". NO! Its large corporations demanding ripping from our planet, and for what money? It's not the little people damaging planet it's the big companies and you fuckers know it!
I imagine seeing vegan teacher seeing this video
Can you make the dislikes count visible for the viewers of your content ?
Why you didnt mention the water waste? Its a big thing 1 kilogramme of beef meat equal to 15,000-20,000 liters of clean water waste
people just wanna find any bullshit reason to continue eating meat. you have to realise, there is none and you have to make room for the thought of reducing your meat intake dramatically
Grasslands that are used to feed cows also get rid of CO2. You know: GRASSlands with TREES.
Two seconds in AAAND it's chicken legs for dinner.
Meanwhile me watching this while eating meat
Local veggie transport is just as bad  as meat transport.
Not gonna lie I just watched this video and now I want to cook a steak.
So eat very little meat and make sure its grass fed but you still are a murderer for killing a cow
wierd that right now, when this video has 3.5million views, people have on total used up about 700k hours of their time to watch this video.
Dont forget dairy cows dont normally produce dairy unless you steal their babies away at birth and you kill the males because they are worthless
What about verticals gardening? They take up so much horizontal space, why not go verticals like what they did with housing in cities?
Eating responsibility is the key. I need some beef in my diet because of blood stuff, but I don’t need it everyday.
I decide to enjoy my beef guilt free.
Thank you for making an other video about the meat industry !  This one is way more efficient and IMO, better in its way of explaining the subject, reality and terrible outcomes to meat-eaters/ignorant to the subject :)    PS: I know this wasn't the focus of your video, but still.. animals are left aside, like always :/ Even tho they are the most concerned here.
I hate eating and not in an anorexic way.
This is really interesting bcoz i saw a video which explains why meat isn't so bad ill try to link it
Keep in mind that huge proportions of agricultural products are not human edible, or not fit for the human consumption market.  Smarter to feed animals with it.
Kind of interesting how they changed their thumbnail from "Meat Love" to "Meat Hate".
wait wait wait wasn't there another video with a similar preview? it was called 'meat love' and dеpicted the same cow, but happy and on a greenish background?? i remember it so vividly, but cannot for the life of mine find it?
plz translait to arabic,i love your videos and my english isn't so good.....thx🌷🌷🌷🌷
I love how he changed the name and thumbnail
Was this video changed from love to hate?
The major argument that our taste buds aren't more important than a sentient being's life (aka animal rights) seems to be missed here. Apart from that, great video.
That vegan teacher: cute animals will not be harmed!  Me: bruh this is not ur video
Me 3 days ago : Awww happy cow Me now : Aw mad cow
The fact that you are indirectly eating Plants-  Plants->Cow->Human  Lot of energy of plants get wasted in life process of Animals, so consuming Plants directly is more efficient.  Simple Logic.
Lefty channel with lefty views, that's why I unsubbed.
I like how people are disgusted by meat but meat is the only good source of complete protein lmao
Wait I thought it was Meat love? Last time I watch it,it was meat love now it's meat hate XD still loves your videos
I've always worried about climate changes and I'm into doing some projects on reducing the CO2, but I don't think that meat is so bad as this video is trying to present it. It is so far the best way human to absorbs proteins. If we really on veggies only we'd need possibly 10 times more food. Also I don't think the calories calculations include the level of absorbing the calories vegetables vs meat. Beef especially contains high level of iron which again it's not so absorbable from vegetables. So my point is if we rely on veggies only we'd need even more land and energy due the increased food consumption.
I'm eating meat while watching this video
The big question, how often can you eat meat while also keeping the balance?
I wonder what does vegan sapiens taste like?
I don't succumb to vegan lobbying provocations.
Thanks a lot for publishing truth
Fact: In Buddhism, young monks are encouraged to eat meat in order to obtain proper nutrients. And life-time vegetarian Buddhist monks who grow their own vegetables still get stroke, cancers and other life threatening diseases due to lack of nutrient balance.
So don’t need eat beef that sound super easy
I n f i n i t e  S m a r t
When you say 3 billion hectares of forest land would remove 800 bilion tonnes of CO2 equivalent over 100 years, you mean 8 Billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent every year as compared to 50 Billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent we produce every year..  I see what you did there.. I approve though..
Great work!
I want to switch fully to faux meat, but the taste still isn’t there for me
Beef and pork really arent bug for me. *says a pescetarian* but i am interested in footprints of Fish and NonChicken Poultry
finally!
Watch the vegan reddit cry about this lmao
Electric trains are superior to electric trucks in long distance travel beside that trucks doesn’t need rail system
So why is beef so much cheaper than vegetables? Not eating beef sounds great but a hamburger will keep me going all day for $2 while I'd have to graze on vegan food all day (for a lot more than $2) Edit: i wrote expensive and not cheaper
Meat is tasty
I rate the stonks meme reference 😉😂
Vegan squad where u at? :D
Counterpoint: I like meat.
Love u
I don't see an issue with a tax increase on beef specifically. But miss me with that vegan garbage. How's that other 75% of emissions doing btw? When are we gonna glass China?
Fair enough, I will compensate the CO2 from my car by omitting beef from my diet. 1 kilogram of beer for every 280 kilometers. I can do that.
Kurzgesagt 2040 : *Are Vegetables really bad?* Government in 2040 : Take your Food Tablets just for $10,000 Dollars from Pfizer center near you! 🥳
In all these discussions one thing almost never comes up: Everybody in the Western world could eat much less and, above all, waste much less.  A different, more reverential attitude towards food might help. After all, food is life and deserves respect. Every morsel of food should be received with appreciation and gratitude.  I don‘t think it would really crimp anybody‘s style; on the contrary. And it would work wonders for our health, our pocket books, our time, our environment. It‘s a win-win-win-win thing. What an outlandish, outrageous idea.
I love how the thumbnail went from cute and happy cow to Satan's reincarnation looking at me  Edit: well, not anymore ;-;
Is meat love video missing?
My answer: Well yes but actually no Or *Yesn't*
Smart and independent people go vegan. Lazy people make excuses like "You don't need to be perfect" or "Veganism is extreme". Eating animal products is not only bad for the environment, but most importantly it's bad for THE ANIMALS. Stop supporting the animal holocaust and go vegan. 🌱
Just cut off the american lifestyle and live of normal diets like the rest of the world and we ll be fine...
8:13 is that the stocks meme
Eating beef is my right, so is my right to NOT take vaccine, I really hate it when others try to force their stupid beliefs on others. - avg kyle and karen.
Okay, this is all nicely laid out and scientific and interesting information, but unfortunately humans evolved to be omnivores and to chase down our food with our tremendous ability to run them to exhaustion. So we crave meat, biologically. You can try to defy your genetic instincts for political reasons but you will eventually lose, even if you think you won’t, because you are human. The same applies to carnivore diets. I tried it once because it is apparently a good cure for epilepsy on some patients. After 2 years of no seizure, that is to say it worked, I started eating veggies again. You’ll miss it beyond all reason.   For me, animal welfare is more important, because true animal welfare means creating an ecosystem that these animals thrive in, and doing that means creating a natural environment with flora that also takes CO2 out of the atmosphere itself. Did these studies account for that, and did they account for the CO2 it takes to grow crops?
All I'm hearing is, "go vegan."
Personally... I'd sooner let not just the planet, but the whole galaxy burn before I'd go vegan.
Made korean
You should go vegan. Consuming any animal products is unethical. You are an animal abuser if you consume them. Looking at veganism from the view of animal ethics is more important than focusing on environment.
Well I don't personally eat meat at all and thinking about going vegan. Well I know how it feels to stop doing things we love, so I don't recommend going vegan but  going Vegetarian is good
'Meat' is certainly 'bad' for those who are manipulated into having children, separated from their families, and murdered for it.  For a species who claims to be the 'most intelligent' we seem to be at the bottom of the list when it comes to empathizing with others through emotional intelligence.
I love how the cow in the thumbnail just goes from angel to a demon
Animal produce  co2 - we eat  Vegtable produce 02 - we not eat
Meat Love Meat Hate  Is meat really that bad ?
Any for-profit-industry in a society that worship profit growth will always end up making something tame into something that drove the world to hellscape.
No, it actually tastes really good.
The monkey in the intro is holding something related to the video
Climate change theory is wrong, problem solved
It is amazing that people do not trust health science but when food they believe anything what big food corporation says or is sponsored by big food corporations. Meat in the quantities we eat is not healthy, but that goes for any food. Too much is never healthy. The whole debate is stupid and fueled by food corporations to muddy the water.
"Rapid climate change"?
actually, the soybeans are crushed for the oil the proteins which come from that are by-product which are fed to animals
Maybe but I don’t give a shit lmao
Better figure out how to scrub CO2 from the air, because giving up meat isn't an option.
It is funny to me that this is even a point of discussion. How do you expect that the 'Primary Consumers' would be able to compete against 'Producers' in terms of efficiency. Also, there is the siognificant problem of ethicality
none of their videos have under a million views...
"No other bodily pleasure (than food*) gets enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old"  I argue thats not true.
I'm beating it as we sp... Wait?!, what meat are we talking about???
What about lab-grown meat?
Honestly the evil cow thumbnail was the one that reeled me in not the other thumbnail
once I move out of the family house, I'd cut beef from my personal diet for sure. Unless I'm offered beef already cooked by friends/family, of course.
The thing that sucks about all this is, there are different types of bodies... My body in particular does not do well with just eating plant based foods. Not only that, it's even more unhealthy for you because they have to add even grosser preservatives and an ass-ton of salt to the foods (which makes it taste disgusting.) There's also allergies people can have. The fact they put so much salt in plant based foods is a killer on my mouth. It causes my tongue to swell up with rashes and bumps. I don't get that problem from all my  "processed", foods, unless they too have an ass-ton of salt (why I don't eat fast food much anymore.)  Honestly... I can't understand why we haven't tried I venting something that converts these elements FOR us, that way we can do better for the environment. We always get in each other's faces about how bad something the other person likes is, for the environment. We aren't solving crap, we're just looking for a creating new problems. How about the scientists behind this research stop bitching and actually INVENT something useful and helpful, instead of trying to make other people's lives miserable so THEY can be happy??? I'd do it myself, but 1. I don't have the funding, 2. I don't have the degrees, and 3. I feel like nobody ACTUALLY cares to help the environment. They only want their personal feelings and demands to be fulfilled because their underlying suck and twisted pleasure from other people's suffering.
Changed Thumbnail😜
Steak should be rare and ethically sourced.  I don't think you should have the freedom to make animals suffer.
If you're wondering this video has 9.3K dislikes. I have the extension to see dislikes.
I ate a chicken while watching that
You didn't adress the thing that if people start eating less meat what will happend? Like the fact that when you have less demand the prices drop and they maybe produce even more meat? or do meatproducers change to something else?
Go vegan 🌱
I'm dissapointed that one of the biggest concerns about meat production was completely left out of the video. This unecological "product" that may end up on your plate is result of mass torture and taken lifes..  Still nicely done and informative video.
Transport ships might kill whales tho  which are important to the climate. Their feces is nutritious for the tiny plants that live in the sea and do the majority of photosynthesis on earth.
I eat meat but not beef because my religion doesn't allow me to eat cow's meat.  I only eat Chicken, Lamb, Fish and eggs.
Better video on this topic than most of your other ones. But again it's worth remembering that you still take a human-centric view on this topic, as if saving the planet for humans is all that matters, forgetting that humans are not the only animal species and that what we are doing to other animals is animal abuse, sexual violence and genocide.
Will be a carnivore for life I didn’t even finish this video just incase plants are better than meat
Eat the bugs peasant we got third world populations to import
Cow farts... This is fucking dumb.
In short, the earth contains too much animals than it can handle animal's CO2.
Today's a good day becuz of kurzgesagt
You seem to have no other problem besides climate change. But for some reason, I'm sure that if Europe goes to vegan pies and taxing citizens for its carbon footprint, the dictatorships of the east that you don't intend to do anything with will not follow your example.
I am excited to see when "science" will prove that street shxtting is good for the planet because making toilets emits a lot of unnecessary co2.
i dont even eat meat, but this sound like you pushing the great reset
Yeap it is for them, for your health and for environnement.The world health organisation and major universities agrees all of the above.Yes you need to go vegan. Ditch suffering and destruction ffs.
You changed the thumbnail love to hate
yes meat is *really* that bad and if you are not vegan you are destroying the planet
but i cannot stop or reduce eating meat
Just go vegan already you people and save all the suffering animals, your health and this goddamn planet............. :(
ok, so starting today ill do photosynthesis
It would be great to have a video on the pros and cons of meat-based and vegan diet for health, for several ages
11:00 the worm is gonna fucking die
@Kurzgesagt there is a lot more to talk about then just meat and and repeating other videos new information is key to more attention and if you stand as a large information figure it’s best to drive people to the more climate positive side of things and give them pure information on climate careers and how interesting and amazing they may be besides I’ve seen a lot of missed out information in this video like automated super efficient fans in Sweden or biosynthesised meat in Brazil or even theory’s on future technologies to come.                                                         The quality of your videos are going down kurzgesagt and I’d love to see it come back to its former glory and trustworthy information.  Thank you
Jack o' lanterns don't get thrown out. They rarely survive the squirrels, raccoons and possum. I couldn't even keep an uncarved pumpkin on the steps.
Ladies & Gentleman, We are sitting in the propaganda train, next location CO2 budget for everyone. Enjoy your days inside your house and remember this is propaganda.
Wait a sec, y’all changed the thumbnail, guess that means I should actually watch the video…
The animation is insanely well made, actually everything keep it up
stop here: no it isn't.
Didn't ask dont care
Did the thumbnail change?
So basically the reason behind global warming and many deadly natural calamities is cow's fart
Besides, taking life of others for food is evil, they deserves to live too!
The day the world's elite stop using private jets and expensive cars and we stop using fossil fuels, is the day I stop eating meat.
Did you change the thumbnail from meat love to meat hate?
I would also love to see a video about food waste, because the percent is really big around 30% if I remember correctly
What should I do with that McDonald's add at the end of the video? Burger King have plant burguer option where I live.
do you miss dinosaurs to ?
The future is vegan. Or there is no future.
Average unhealthy chicken eater VS Average healthy omego-3 fishy enthusiast
Why did everyone start using the phrase "You can decide for yourself what to do with this information"?
Aghhhhh data comparisons between different timescales. I love Kurzgesagt and I’m veggie but this is the kind of shady statistics reporting I’d expect from a tabloid newspaper. 800GtCO2e over *100 years* vs. 50GtCO2e over *1 year*, these figures should not be compared on the same graph, they have two different units and this is misleading. Obviously planting more forests is good for climate change and creating ecosystems but in the first 10 - 20 years trees don’t capture that much CO2 as they’re not big enough or gaining mass quickly enough to remove large amounts of CO2 and even if we did plant these forests it’s an average 8GtCO2e/yr removed (with a time delay) vs 50GtCO2e/yr emitted. We need to change the way we see trees in relation to climate change: Donald Trump, Nigel Farage and other former climate change deniers and sceptics back planting trees to prevent climate change so they can then justify not cutting their emissions; trees can’t save us from climate change, they can help but we don’t have enough land area to grow enough forests to offset our current CO2 emissions. Stopping slash and burn forest destruction is an absolute must but new forests are only a part of the solution, they aren’t the solution themselves and won’t do all that much by 2050. The only thing that will prevent climate change is a maaaasive reduction in the amount of CO2e that we emit, let’s hope we have the collective willpower to make the political and lifestyle changes required
This would have taken soooo long to research
Meat yummy
Not at all! I love the taste of meat.
The more people hate meat the better.. more for me
What if we had thanos who could solve climate change by one snap 😏 .   (Just a meme , don't take it seriously)
So cow farts and burps contribute to this supposedly climate change-fad as well? What is this, a ridiculous joke, right? I get the impression that the anti-meat / vegan-cult lobby are truly trolling the People on this matter.
Did the thumbnail change??..it used to say "meat love"
I’m not much a meat guy. I mean, I’m made of meat, but I source most of my protein from cheese and magic.
Meat is the worst thing one can eat because of the bad effects on our health and the lives we take in the process. It's the biggest contributor of Green House Gasses. It takes billions of litres of water and deforestation for animal farming. So for the collective good we should stop consuming and look for plant based alternatives. There's already plant based meat available and plant based milk has also passed it's trials (apart from soy milk, almond milk etc.) so there's no need for such atrocities.
Utwe
Vegan's will love this video
Meat hate, you mean body parts of tormented and murdered sentient beings just becahse of taste buds hate.
Is meat really that bad? The simple yet accurate answer ultimately is: no.
what about cheese and other milk products
my advice if you love meat then why not eat humans
Beef is a big emition problem, but there is the technology to eliminate it. Im a biogas plumber and ive builded more than 20 biogas systems all over Germany. I mean if somehow all big farms gathered sewage of their cows in a BG system, they will cross a problem off their list and produce electricity as a gift by burning the gas in LKW motors PLUS heated water for cooling down the motor that its energy can be further extraced even as more electricity with an indipendent closed turbin system. It would reduce those emmitions by 35-40% aproximetly in a 5 year period.
This turned from meat love to Meat hate and idk why and the cow look wasn't demonic
Finding the perfect balance between practicality and environment is to rare cows for milk only. Wherever possible, beef should be avoided and cows should be taken good care of. (The interesting thing here is that this is the regular Indian diet in most parts.)
I see.  So someone who actually knows what they’re talking about called you out on your bullshit and this is the response.  Edit: It was a good response.
It tastes amazing so no
How to lie with numbers? Compare CO2 absorption for a "century" with CO2 emission per "year" in a single screen to graphically manipulate the effect of a vegan diet 9:33
Google for "Return Youtube Dislike"
If meat is so bad then we should make all carnivores eat grass
Who else is watching this while eating a cheeseburger 🍔??!!
9:12 👊🏾👌🏾🙌🏾👍🏾👊🏾👌🏾👌🏾👍🏾👊🏾👌🏾🙌🏾👍🏾👊🏾👌🏾👍🏾👍🏾👊🏾👊🏾🙌🏾👍🏾🙌🏾👊🏾👊🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾🙌🏾👍🏾 yes! 3 billions hectares that could potentially go back to being carbon capture forest, increase wild life diversity, and regulate much better our climate.   Don’t quote me exactly on those numbers, yet the ratio is very close: in the beginning of last century, in terms of numbers, there used to be 90% of wild big animals and 10% humans+livestock. Now humans+livestock represent 90% of the biodiversity….. humans and the 10+ animal species we exploit and kill……………. That is sad.
TLDW = Go vegan. Will be better for you, the people you love, the animals, ...
8:57 🙌🏾👌🏾👍🏾👊🏾🙌🏾👌🏾👍🏾👊🏾🙌🏾👌🏾👍🏾👊🏾🙌🏾👌🏾👍🏾🙌🏾👊🏾👌🏾👍🏾🙌🏾👊🏾👌🏾👍🏾🙌🏾👊🏾👌🏾👍🏾🙌🏾👊🏾👌🏾 thank you for including this graph into this video…. Facts to debunk the nonsense around soy production.
personaly dont really care about if i can eat beef until i can have chicken. We can not 100% give up meat since there are nutritions that are very low concentration in plants like vitamin B variants
The environment hysteria is first of all about more money and power to the ruling class. Taxation of CO2 is a good example of this. How brainwashed must you be to believe that if we just give politicians more money, they will change the weather as we want it..
7:46 ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ this is such a carnist and speciesist point of view….. the cultural and generational brainwashing has been effective….. HUMAN BIOLOGY DOES NOT REQUIRE ANIMAL PRODUCTS. We can totally be happy and healthy on 100% plants. Hence, when we apparently care about our environmental impact, why would we consider animal products that require more energy, more land, and produce more waste/greenhouse gases???? Makes no sense.   We already have enough land to generate enough plant food for humans. We do not need to repurpose land that couldn’t grow human plant food. We could just live it to nature and wild life diversity.
Did you guys change the thumbnail?😂
I think we also should to talk about lab meat and hydroponic farming again.
Its only a matter of time until we invent a co2 sucking machine and this whole environmental effect thing from meat would be a less issue.
7:20 ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ the thing is WE DO NOT HAVE TO USE EVERY PIECE OF LAND….. we could simply live is to nature and wild lift!!!! God…….
7:07 ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ if we use unsuitable land for plant agriculture for cattle grazing, like mountainous ranges, this vastly increases the cost of animal products because they are much more difficult to manage and require much more fossil fuels than if the livestock was of formerly flattened forests close by human habitat…. This is a false solution.
Did I miss something on the transportation for locally produced meat it's higher than shipping avocados around the world but they didn't add in the last mile of shipping on the avocados. Do people buy them at the freight containers of ships?
So this means there's no hope? Are we too late?
But chicken is tasty. 😁
So I eat chicken.
6:40 ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ and there you have it…. To increase the environmental efficiency and yield of animal products you need to vastly increase animal cruelty which any sane human being is against.   But there are other solutions:  Plant based replacements, and newer bio engineered animal products that do not require livestock. They taste the same, they smell the same, they have the same colours…. WITHOUT the animal use, the cruelty and only a fraction of the waste!!!  For examples, the impossible meat! It is now possible to use a similar bacteria-powered beer brewing process, to create dairy milk!!!!  In a fraction of the space, the time, and the required energy, and waste generated, without the need for antibiotics, or cows at all, we can create the exact dairy milk!!!!  Drop animal products. Let’s move to a plant based food system where and when we can!
Hy bro can I take your video and put a voice over in hindi I will give you the rights of video
I am Russian  The original: Я русский
HELLO KINDLY TELL ME HOW YOU MAKE THESE ANIMATION VIDEO ALS TELL ME HOW TO ANIMATE ALSO LIST THE APP
'Climate change is a very serious issue'🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂😂😂😆😄😄😁👍
*What I've Learned* has joined the chat
This entire video assumes the viewer cares about their “carbon footprint”.
The problem arises in the first 30 seconds of the video. 'one of the most delicious foods, meat...' meat is not delicious. Have you ever just eaten a raw piece of meat? It's the preparation and seasoning that makes meat delicious. You can make a perfectly delicious meal without meat.
3:15 ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ 1) if you want to compare factory farming to grass fed, instead of comparing animal product to monocrops made for human consumption, you should then factor instead veganic farming. And you would see that veganic farming is even less impactful than conventional plant production and ultimately to any kind of animal products.   2) if everyone wanted to have access to grass fed/reared livestock, the land use would be so much greater that we would need 3-4 Earths!!!! That’s a cool way to advocate for elitism tough…. Animal products only for those who can afford them…..
I like the way you communicate those problems. Kind of reminds me of the "war on drugs" video.
im Kurtz: no, it is not bad as long as the animals eat the diets their digestive systems and gut bacteria are evolved for.
2:51 ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ yes but instead of eating a single kilogram of beef and owning its environmental impact, maybe be smarter and eat a bunch of varied plant food that would give you the same nutrition (or even better nutrition) and that would STILL have WAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYY lower environmental impact than beef………. Duh…………. I just connect brain cells…………
I wonder if red meat is actually bad for you or if its bad press for health is a conspiracy to get people to reduce carbon emissions.
The “carbon budget “ concept is lunacy.
I am convinced that this channel and the Infographics channel are just soft propaganda sources
1:25 ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ we raise more than 70 billions land animals each year to slaughter for meat/dairy/eggs. Those animals have to be fattened up to slaughter weight on plants that needs to be grown……………… those plants are grown on land that used to be forests and on chemical fertilisers. What happens if we turn vegan??? No need to artificially breed into existence any of these 70 billions of animals, the waste they would produce is gone, the land needed to shelter them is gone, the food they would need is gone, the land required to grow that food is gone, additionally we stop shipping that food around (meat/dairy/eggs/feed) we stop using the required fossil fuels to do so….. how the hell all of this is not a major impact on our environment????  What would happen to our climate if instead of vaste land used for animal farming and animal feed… we had luxuriant forest, the greatest carbon capture devices we have on earth????????????
Come to Florida, and you will see that we don't cut down any trees for food, we cut it down LITERALLY because it's becoming overwhelmingly crowded with people moving down here from New York, and New Jersey. We are having our taxes go WAYYY up because of the influx of rude, impatient yankee transplants. We are ridiculously cutting down thousands of acres of land for these people. CANT STAND THEM!
yes it is because it involves animal suffering
Video moves on very quickly from the 11% of all crops being used for industry.  Ie used for biofuels.
Yes. It is.
You can't survive by only eating plants End of story
That Vegan Teacher
The real question: Why do cows fart so much?
I love meat
wait did the thumbnail just change
Im still waiting for them scientists to start making laboratory meat in industrial numbers
Nice analysis
Why did you change the thumbnail?
Cow is happy animal don't eat
Im waiting that Lab grown meat is affordable soon
Well, I learned a lot of things new on a topic that I thought I knew so much about. Cheers once again, Kurzgesagt.
I purposefully only ever eat bacon cheeseburgers so I know 2 animals died to make it, go cry more vegan's 😉😂
That fart-o meter gave me a good chuckle
Perfect for the eating season.
"Everything has a delicate balance."
Insects are the food of the future to replace meat. Trust me on this. Not all bugs are like filthy cockroaches, there are clean and good tasting insects out there. They are good on protein and other nutrients and also they dont create so much waste and polution. Plus killing bugs is not so gruesome as killing mammals who have same feelings as us, and its easier and faster to kill bugs. Only thing that is stopping this now is stigma.
👌
not even gonna watch everyone knows if you hate food your dump
Proposal for next vid: Why do meat taste so good?
I lowkey LOVE the first song in this video. Classy, deep, devious.
I must multiply my meat consumption to counter all vegans.
This is gonna make me feel bad whenever I eat meat now lmao
Não sei quem faz a legenda do português, mas antes de P e B se usa M, logo em “enpacotamento” o correto é “empacotamento”...
Wait, Kurzgezagt, this video really surprises and angers me, because it is so much more limited than the title and intro suggests.   How are you making a video about why meat production is "bad", a very big word, without talking extensively about the (science behind) physical and psychological torture of animals that are aware of pain? Your title implies that you are talking about an ethical issue, for which you use science to come to a verdict. It seems quite indisputable that animals suffer from our psychological and physical abuse in the big meat industries, but you could add a science approach there too. I think most people wouldn't wish a life in bioindustry on their worst enemy.   I would really like it if you could elaborate on your perspective and reasoning for this focus on climate ethics in a much broader ethical issue that can be informed by science as well?
Wildlife never "fart and breathe", nor do they eat gras.
Watch out, that vegan teacher is coming for you Kurzgesagt.
Paid for by big meat
I like how they keep changing their title and thumbnail
I am a vegetarian. My carbon footprint is very less. No doubt, I secretly hate meat eaters.
Fuck off, I’m eating meat forever.
So thats a good thing that hindus dont eat beef
Despite the thumbnail I title. Ask me how did I know the answer.
Maybe the answer is reduce the people on the planet so the rest can still eat some meat without global warming.
MEAT IS MEAT, we humans for generations survived throughout the toughest envoirnments with just flesh to satisfy our hunger I’m not gonna let a vegan person tell me not to eat it. But yeah I get your point
Can you please make a video about the atmosphere
I could not count how many videos about meat kurzgesagt made and could not understand their obsession with meat (and other dairy products). We don't eat just meat kurzgesagt please stop doing videos on meat, flesh, milk...
Moderation is key. But funny how vegetarians and vegans go banana over people who are non vegetarian and non vegan like their diets are perfect.
Why did you compare plants international shipping to meats local shipping? Wouldn't the plants then have to be shipped locally as well using the same amount as meat?
00:02 " No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day". Yea no, i can think of a few things that are
Let's eat more pork :)
Yes but veggy patties have tons of vegetable oil in them, and that has it own complication for the health of humans
I love beef, India is largest exporter of beef
Great video...Thanks
1:44 okay that just tells me this "carbon budget" is going to inevitably get used up. If taking down everything except freaking food isnt going to help and only give us 80 freaking years, then its not fixable. Individual government, doesnt matter, this isnt a fixable problem. This whole climate change deal is advertised like "oh you can save the world if you do X Y Z to reduce carbon emissions" and everybody abuses that innate desire to keep the world safe. But it *clearly* is never going to happen, nothing we do will make any difference.
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old."  Me : There is another
This video needs dislikes enabled.
They changed the title and thumbnail
Yeah in some areas they rarely have access to meat. We take it for granted alot just like some places hard to grow crops (looking at you northern alaska and mongolia).  Though imo a balanced diet is the best of both worlds. Not eating meat is as bad as eating only meat.  There may be some better choices like goats (who graze instead of browse i.e. they'll eat whatever) and ofc potatoes (all cept some vitamins and calcium you get from some milk).  The best way to reduce carbon usage is the demand. By that less people. At least for awhile 7 billion get it down to at least 2 billion and watch the carbon footprints go down drastically.  To add a point to this one or even a million people dying doesn't hit as much as before. Unless they all die in one specific area we still won't see a change in other areas give or a take a few products made there won't be available for awhile.
8:42 That soy milk carton has a "soy face". LOL
:|
o this why people in the past only eat meat in special occasion.
This vid. reminds me lil. about Dominion movie.
If you want to cut down on emissions and you're a vegan or a meat eater make sure to buy things like fresh asparagus and strawberries locally.  The transportation of asparagus is outrageous and generates a massive amount of co2.  Because those things are short lived they fly those things over seas.  Also don't buy almonds or almond milk from california.  They should not be growing almonds there considering they're a dry state and wanted to syphon off the great lakes 8 /
Horseshit !  The amount of CO2  in the atmosphere could double tomorrow, and no one could tell the difference. CO2 is NOT a pollutant, and is required for life to exist. The end for us will likely be a comet or asteroid hitting Earth, or population far exceeding ten billion.
There is no way to change an entire generation. People just don't change, but they die. The education of the new generations are the key. And the development of foods with more nutrient qualities is a great advantage to switch to a new human diet.
lol food sucks and so does eating
Meat is NOT nutrient dense.
Well, lets invest in lab meat.
Meat feeds bad bacteria in your stomach. Bad bacteria kill good bacteria. Good bacteria count for 50% of your immune system. The health downfalls of meat are enough to stop eating it.
With this video I can conclude that starving people help the environment more. Lol
What else do people need to go Vegan? Is nobody interested in the world anymore?? Go Vegan, or at least try 🌱
meat is meat
I usually love Kurzgesagt videos, but this one disappointed me a bit. Why didn't you mention any of the studies that have been done with regards to using sea weed as a cattle dietary supplement to reduce methane output? or any of the studies that covered using well managed high intensity grazing to reverse or prevent desertification in grasslands? Also, it is possible to raise dairy and beef cattle on nothing but pasture, even if it does require more pasture management, including establishing an appropriate mix of crops and carefully managed high intensity grazing.
I'd like to see something comparing algae co2 absorption to land plant co2 absorption.
Or we could go back to eat meat like it's a luxury item, cause it is
This video makes me want to order a steak, been months lol we tend to have mutton as main red meat, I wonder why ducks are not bigger part of our diet, hmmmm hungry
Aren't commercial ships responsible for most of the ocean's pollution tho?
Also, a fuckton of meat and other food is wasted by throwing it away, especially in the US. the truth is we’re not stopping, those greedy fatasses are gonna continue to lobby for meat, a small part of the population is gonna continue overeating, so yeah I don’t have much hope for us humans
not gonna turn vegan for way way way worse food, sorry
It's good eat it
Bruh after the thumbnail change i thought it was a new vid
Who remembers when the thumbnail was a cow with hear eyes?
Unmanaged forests burn down regularly, reducing their carbon sequestration by half.  Grasslands without grazing herbivores become sod bound, and don't exist in nature.  Cow parks are the best method of carbon sequestration.
Thank you!
Very good video but I feel like every time things like this are mentioned I have no clue what I should do living in a 3rd world country and I don't know how meat is produced here it's always just the US and Europe
It's not "meat" that's bad  It where and how it comes from   Make it in a lab and we have a Huge Winner
So let's just force developing and poor nations to eliminate their best way of developing and increasing their GDP and also force them to reforest and make huge portions of their nations into useless carbon sponges, so we can continue emitting way more co2 than them, developing our industries and living like kings, got it
no
I'm still thinking lab grown meats might have an impact, but we aren't close enough to guess how yet. I guess it's like fusion. Though it seems we're finally passing the "it's 30 years away" benchmark. Pretty sure fusion will be necessary to curb pollution on the energy requirements of lab grown meat anyway.
I will take this information and still eat meat. I'm certain technology will find a fix.
Wow, this video must be amazing! It has zero dislikes.
would the alan savory grazing method be a viable method of farming
5:58 why that cow looks so cool😂
you know its serious when he says "its complicated""
I am a meat eater myself but think people are giving a lot of undeserved hate to Kurzgesagt.
I love my meat
As someone who eats to survive, the first 10 seconds of this video made me feel very very alien.... :(
Lol at the comments
OK, so chicken insted of beef, what about fish?
Eliminate Asia out of the picture and climate change is no longer the issue
Did you guys change the thumbnail? Lol
I wish there had been a section to discuss the health effects of meat and different diet options, there's a ton of info and discussions about that.
So what if we planted a bunch of trees on all the pastures in the world? that way the cattle would have a place to live and  the trees would help negate carbon emissions.
Hey Kurzgesagt why do you change the thumbnail from:"Meat love" to "Meat hate"? I watch the video before
They want us to eat bugs. Crickets and roaches
Lab-grown beef is the answer to our emissions from this food source. No cows to actually kill, and emissions, if any, can be contained.
Breed cows to toot less idk
Omnivores birds
Seems like this video is being made by a veg.
What happend to the Meat Love video :c i wanted to see it
Nature is far smarter than even you, Kurzgesagt, planet Earth has spent a far greater amount of it's existence non-suitable for human habitation due to carbon and methane in the atmosphere long before we were around. Nature will survive long after we can't take the heat anymore and make way for plants and another mix of creatures that will be suited to the next age of earth's history. For this cosmic-moment between ice ages, let's just be grateful we exist at all and enjoy it instead of being judgemental and angry and so self-important to think any concept of a moral-high-ground inherently bestows the right of despotism is just hubris. There is no one "Right" way to live, no one true religion, no one right culture, language, philosophy, scientific faction, political party, etc, etc, etc. There's only what's right for you. To want to force YOUR way on others who don't agree is the only real WRONG in all of existence.
It would be so interesting to see a second part of this where they show the other side’s arguments and debunk them.
With this information I decided to unsubscribe:D this is enough internet for today.
Hate to break it to you but you don’t cut down trees for beef farming. You have to destroy forests for plant farming though….
Surprised the recent study from UC Davis wasn't used. Showing how a majority of the food given to livestock is inedible to humans.
Amazing video, rellay! we basically can only plant trees but that's at least a solution. But I would also add the protection of the sea itself, that is far more involved into producing oxigen and keeping CO2 than trees are.
Can you guys one day make a video about allergies?
Personally, I do not believe for an instant the driving force behind this is simply saving the environment, otherwise the focus would be on more sustainable methods of farming that would have far less environmental impact or, at the very least, discouraging people from eating beef in favour of pork, poultry and fish which, as shown in this video, are only marginally worse for the environment than many plant alternatives, and would be far more easily sustainable...  No, I'm convinced that the push to stop people eating meat in order to "save the planet" stems from being hijacked by radical vegans who are using climate change as a trojan horse to force their agenda on the greater community...
I get the 3 billion hectares saved, but we did see how low the calories from plants were, most if not more land will be needed to plant more vegetables to feed everyone.
True fans remember when the thumbnail was Meat Hate
SPANISH SUBTITLES FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭
Imagine if That Vegan Teacher watched this. She would be saying "THIS IS ALL WRONG BE VEGAN"
Love the Fart-o-Meter~
Interesting change of thumbnail and title comment.   Good to see kurzgesagt mixing up the ad tactics to gain viewership.   *Disclaimer: I do not care about any opinions on the nature of shock media or clickbait. I just care that my favorite channel gets more recognition.
Too bad none of this make a difference. People will keep having kids, the population will keep exploding and we'll keep running the earth into the ground. Therefore, I say "LET THEM EAT BEEF!"
what about the moral reasons for being vegan?
FOOD WASTE needs to be looked at, the way we waste food especially in the USA IS INSANE. The food is wasted, then rots and produces gases.
Ecosocialism or apocalypse.
moss
was kind of hoping to see how fish compares, disappointed it wasn't even mentioned in passing
Fascinating, I'm still going to eat meat but fascinating nonetheless.
This video is awesome. One caveat: beef CAN have a negative carbon footprint IF it sequesters carbon in regenerative agricultural systems. Regenerative ag systems require some animals to help cycle nutrients, and cows can do this. However, this only works in areas where cows are native species, and they would be extremely small in number compared to today. Even more, people would probably be consuming 90-95% less beef in such a system, because you'd harvest cows much less frequently than plants and insects. Tldr: probably still shouldn't eat meat
that's cool and all, I don't really care about my carbon footprint so imma eat beef anyway, (it's the best food in existence) but yah you're right its bad for the environment. Not my problem tho lmaoo
80%
Is this really how you pronounce hectares in english? Sounds weird.
Ok Kurzgesagt team.  Praise and a Question: I love your work.  This vid I learned that my understandings of this subject are mostly correct but I was challenged in how I thought about global shipping. Thanks!  But as I understand from "drawdown" 2017 by Paul Hawkin, Refrigerants are a large part of the global warming impact of transporting food. This is hard to quantify i Know as it's often a latent issue. And obviously refrigerants are everywhere, in air conditioning and refrigeration from the new ones being created to the old ones slowly leaking in landfills around the world.  Can you Please Please Please consider a video or 2 on understanding the refrigerant situation, both in terms of food's impact on global warming bt also the wider unseen global warming contribution?
just don't eat meat lol it's pretty fucking straight-forward
I love meat never will I give in uhaha
im still eating meat, i dont want to have to eat an entire jar of peanut butter to get the same about of protean id get from say grilled chicken
It is disingenuous to strawman the argument for "cows convert non-edible stuff we can't eat" argument to the incredibly narrow scope of just grass. Who on earth is genuinely making this argument? No one. Literally no one. The argument is that they can convert husks and fiber from all manner of plant sources we do not and cannot eat into an edible form (their milk, and meat).   Not addressing this was, frankly, utterly wrong of you - i expected more from this channel.
Hello i have recently go some videos about white holes in my recommended videos i would be very happy if you can make a video about them too because from that video i cant really understand it thank you and love your content
Comment for algorithm
Happy Meat Farms
Kurzgesagt♡
Cows don’t fart. They only burp.
You guys changed the thumbnail
I mean, I’m not a hater of it, but I love beating it
I love both the thumbnails but more so the evil cow 🐄 💔 😔
Yeah, still won't stop me from eating beef though.
Gone vegan for this reason and while I do miss the taste of a juicy steak 🥩 I do feel like I have so many alternatives in this day and age. I love my planet and I love animals include my pets so I can’t give in to killing innocent cattle and pollute nonstop
Alright I will get grilled pork instead of steak
Being from New Zealand grass fed beef is the ONLY beef. I dont think its legal to feed cows grain, they have to be open field cows
This silly numbers. Do you have any idea how many trees you have to plant in a daily basis in comparison to the amount of pollution we pump into the air. Ya forget about it.
I wonder if growing meat in a petri dish is less detrimental to the environment. Because if we take as fact that by 2100 food production alone will ensure our future is doomed (CO2 emission being high enough to cause irreversible effect on climate) then by definition we either have to improve food production or we just accept a future where we are extinct.  But that doesn't mean we have to avoid all meat sources or only produce meat for the uber rich. If we can grow meat in a lab, then we bypass any moral and ethical concerns re: killing sentient animals and we avoid the problem with emissions and so forth.  Since I don't personally believe meat is going anywhere, I think the future will be some sort of hybrid world where lab grown meat is the norm and the upper class gets to eat actual animals. Also I think we'll be extinct one day but that's a given.
*me eating lamb rn* ‘_’
no
Please bring the old thumbnail back. The cow looks like its possessed by satan 😂
0:02 if this is related to thanksgiving event. Then consider this Back then there are less available food. We eat good food only during special occasions. This is true for most civilizations/cultures around the world. Some only eat meat occasionally.  Now, however, we could eat lots of food, lots of good food everyday. Could eat lots of meat everyday. Heck, today we could eat thanksgiving-like diner everyday if we want to. Something thatd be difficult back then.  And every calorie/fat/protein rich diet means lots of resource which means more CO2. With the food available to us, many of us could consume more than we need (thus overweight/obessity).   That being said, macdonalds would be happy to provide the calories....  So...perhaps if we could tone down the food consumption and not be overweight, perhaps that would help?
I can already answer this question for you without watching the video.. *its delicious*   for me, eating animals which reproduce faster than we eat them, it’s not really that bad, because animals eat other animals, and we are not that different from animals
I hoped this would talk about the health aspect of meat not just the environmental impact..
I would also love a video on foods ranked by water consumption! Another topic we'll have to be more informed about in the future.
"Let's stick with beef"  That's all I needed to hear
I just want to tell you that I have gotten my whole school A higher education school to teach with some of your videos
solution. You want meat, hunt it yourself. A lot less people eating meat then
The animal farts simpel is that XD
Unfortunately such videos aren't helping. I've seen some on the topic and they all contradict each other. I guess this is the curse of YT - anyone can make a video claiming they reasearched the topic well, but we'd have to be experts to know who's right. What I didn't like about yours was: 1. You didn't mention the fact, that livestock eat a lot of unusable parts of crops. Tell me, what would happen with that waste if we didn't feed it to the cows? I can't think of any other way, that wouldn't result in a release of greenhouse gases into atmosphere. Namely, we could burn it as fuel or just leave it and let it rot or ferment. 2. Although we have a lot of livestock, we also killed most big wild animals in the last 2 thousand years. Our livestock fills that gap. So it's not like all of this methane is caused by our civilization. Some, perhaps most of it was being produced centuries ago by wild animals. 3. A misconception about forests and other biomes is they produce a lot of surplus oxygen. Plants themselves do, but when you take into account all the organisms in a biome you find out it actually doesn't produce much extra oxygen. In case of forests main factor are bacteria feeding on old roots, that actually consume oxygen and produce greenhouse gases. That's why cutting down forests that are older than 10 years of age is beneficial. Trees produce a surplus of oxygen up to around that age. But after that ther roots start to rot and it cancels out that effect. We owe all the oxygen in our atmosphere to algae in the oceans, that produced a small surplus of oxygen over millions of years. So, when you say that instead of feeding grass to our livestock we could let it grow in order for it to produce more oxygen, you may be badly wrong. That may actually be counterproductive.
Very good
Dont care what anyone says, ill eat my burgers, steaks, chicken etc. whenever i want.
In summary there is simply too many of us
0-0 what happened to the thumbnail? Why he angy now?
Major Omission: Lab grown meat It may not be economically viable now but it is becoming more viable over time.
cows and pigs also eat parts of greens that we don't want, like the entire plant the tiny corn kernels grow on. Or the leftovers when grain is harvested-or stuff that is rejected for human consumption. They up-cycle this waste which would otherwise rot into methane.
I like the video, but I immediately lost trust in you as a source once you put the diagram comparing yearly emission to hundred year reduction (9:33). I cannot see is in any other way than as a manipulative strategy to emphasize your point. Even though I agree with your message I think it's only fair to call you out on that as I would with someone advocating in the opposite way.
Unfortunately vegan food dont have the consistency to it yet.
Since you break down videos into sections, it would be nice to use timestamps to make it easier to follow them
Meat is good. Vegans and environmentalists are bad. That's why, when we finish eating the cows, we're going to eat them.
I won't stop eating meat, it's too good...unless they have alternatives for it everywhere! But, I don't understand people that aren't willing to try meat-alternatives. Once they get commercial-wide replacements at every fast food etc chain, I would have no problem with veggie burgers and dogs.
I love your videos, but I think the data at 9:29 might be a tad over-convoluted or understated. If the entire annual CO2 emissions are ~50 billion tonnes, then the 100 year emissions add up to ~5000 billion tonnes – which is much more than the possible 800 billion tonne removal over the same period. In other words, your numbers suggest that radical and far-reaching dietary change can at best decrease global CO2 emissions by only 16%  - yes?
What exactly is a carbon budget, and who sets the "budget" ?
I switch to an all meat diet and never felt better.
Chicken
If meat is so bad why did God make it so tasty? why God why?
I like Kurzgesagt but unfortunately they do not provide an answer to solving this problem. 1 cow provides 600-700 lbs of meat which feeds a lot of humans, making it a very efficient system much like this videos container ship example. Basically a cow is a container ship with a bunch of 1lb meat containers and everyone who eats some shares the cost. The only thing we can do as a society is to choose to consume less meat. Plant based foods are not meat alternatives because they do not provide animal proteins or the same level of nutrient density the human body evolved to consume.
Kurzgesagt: talks about how bad meat is for the environment Me eating my ham sandwich while watching this video: (@_@) (・_・)
now im a lot more motivated to get 3 dollar menu cheeseburgers to help drive the beef stonks up. win win people
The world can burn. This bacon is delicious!
I think meat isn't bad just the production methods behind most of our foods is unsustainable at this current point in time with how climate change is progressing.  We need to collectively change which is hard since there's so much money involved.  Money is the root of all kinds of evil.
I’ve always wondered why I’ve rarely heard aquaponics be brought in reference to this topic. It seems like it could really help reduce the amount of farm land needed to grow crops, reduce the usage of fertilizers, and also double for farming fish. Or maybe the power required to run these types of farms would create a large carbon foot print, or it might that the infrastructure required is to expensive to reasonably attempt. I would love to see you guys do a video on the topic!  Edit: Thanks for the responses! It was really just a thought so I'm glad I got some clarification on the issues at hand. It sounds like the main take away is that while it could be a promising idea, the technology isn't there yet and that running it currently would be too costly in money, energy, and space, which is what I was afraid of. Thanks you guys for the explanation.
Can we get a Meat love/Meat hate coin or something though?
Why is the thumbnail different now? I remember seeing it when it was first uploaded but didn't get around to watching it until now
Well, good thing chicken is delicous.
Does the food type cow eat determine gaseous output amount and type? Ie if grain fed vs grass fed?
I understand that the video is talking about beef specifically. But we should also have a conversation about hunting. Game meat is also a great source of meat at the same time not a high carbon emissions is put on it. The facts are if we grow our own meat and vegetables as individual families, we can create a food chain that is sustainable at the same time for everyone.– Elias Ramirez
Man, now I really REALLY want a steak.
Lol all you put out is propaganda anymore. Wild.
Now I really want to get some McDonalds burgers!
It's so obvious that eating animals is terrible for the environment, but it really says a lot about the depravity of our culture, that even in a video like this the premise that animals are just products, "meat," is never once challenged. Every year, Millions of sentient beings are subjected to unimaginable cruelty and slaughtered just to tingle your taste buds.  But hey, gee golly, you decide if you can be even mildly inconvenienced!
See... it's the forced creation and systemic killing of 36M cattle, 8.1B chickens, 214M turkeys, 124M pigs, 23M ducks, 7.5M sheep, 3.8B fish and 43B shellfish in the US annually that was actually MY bigger issue with this. Not to mention the 7.5B humans who seem to have no ability to put a limit on their own reproduction and so have to basically tear up large swathes of the planet for resources, farms and - well - garbage pits.  But sure - climate change.
right now there are 8.9k dislikes for those who are wondering
Well Anthony Faucci is "the science"... so why not just ask him?
A while ago I complained on their website about a video I felt was unfairly anti-vegan and uninformed. This video helps to address some of the harm they may have caused with that video, thanks kurzgesagt!
What really concerns me is the fact that you cannot raise cattle efficiently without making the animal suffer. I guess we either care for the animals mistreatment or we save the environment. Personally, I love meat but I try not to eat it too often. Maybe just once a week.
Just eat less meat. Please, rich world, we beg you.
Such a onesided video. Freeing up space from meat production wont stay free. It will be used for more veg production which will shoot back the emissions back up that u lowered from going meat free. Barely included any arguements against this topic and it saddens me that kurzgesagt uploaded this pretty much propaganda of a video. Not ur best vid guys.  Sad that ppl now wont see the dislikes becuz media wants so much control.
I ate meat yesterday ate today will eat tomorrow.
4:26 ok so the international shipping is CO2 efficient. It still has to go from the ship to the store and the store to your house, same as the meat. Why aren't those numbers there? I'm not saying I disagree with the conclusion that local isn't that significant, but you're missing out a whole part of the equation/journey there.
Transportation example does not make sense. Avocados still needs to be transported locally. They do not teleport from ports to stores, are they? Claiming that local trasport of beef costs more CO2 than avocado from other continent is a manipulation.
So in other words, it doesn't matter the approach, meat will always have a higher CO2 footprint than any other type of food ?
0:04 Speak for yourself.🤣
If you have time and if you are young and want to understand this issue and want Truth nothing less, check the studies mentioned in this video and also "Fallacies: Confirmation Bias, Observational Selection, etc ". Have a critical mind always especially when dealing with programing aimed at children. And for health reasons everybody should look into micronutrient and macronutrient density and bioavailability with respect to human digestion, very important not just for you but for your entire family.
I like how they released the video after the dislike button was removed lol
What about plant based meat?
Loved the Fart-O-Meter animation, that cow was putting in the effort.
Biased video, don't you think? Most "crops" we feed to cattle are the parts of the plants we cannot eat. Crops depleat the land, cattle doesn't (they fertilize crops with cattle's menure ). Not only the amount but the quality of nutrients matter, we're not made for eating just plants. Most of the wateer cattle consumes is green water, on the other hand crops use mostly blue water., I could keep going but nobody is gonna read...
Watching this video made me hungry a bit. But I don't eat beef that often, so I'm ok with this planet :D
It is extremely unfortunate that the immense suffering these animals endure was barely mentioned in the video... It is portrayed as being infinitely less important than efficiency gained by making them suffer
Most people think that a change of diet from meat based to vegan based is  sufficient to solve climate change, but is only one of the necessary things to do.  Another thing to do to have “meat-free” land is to stop having mascots such as cats and dogs but I know that is even harder to do than eating meat ourselves.
Yes, IT is
Great video!
This video does some things wrong, typically with the framing. For example, it doesn't point out that only like 4% of greenhouse emissions come from animal husbandry (according to the EPA). They had the opportunity mention this at the start of the video, but instead they said worldwide food production alone accounts for 26% of emissions and could use up our "carbon budget" by 2035. Okay, but it should be noted that food production is not just meat. So we get rid of the 4% of emissions that come from meat and we're still fucked. Cutting meat out completely might spare us... 6 months?   It further obscures the relative insignificance of meat with weird framing at the end. It that says 800 Billion Tonnes of co2 would be removed over the course of 100 years if we replaced animal farmland with co2 scrubbing plants. And it points out that we collectively release 50 billion tonnes per year across all sectors. It then shows the 800 billion Tonne figure side by side with the 50 billion tonne figure, as if to suggest 800 billion is a lot. Well, it is a lot. But 50 billion tonnes by 100 years (the appropriate comparison) is 5000 Tonnes. So if we erased all animal farming and replaced it with plants that were 100% as efficient at scrubbing the atmosphere as soon as we planted them as we would like, we'd have made up only ~1/5th to ~1/2 the amount of co2 we'd otherwise have released over the course of 100 years? Which, again, may take us from 4% greenhouse emissions from animals to -8% best case scenario. I am not sure how we're meant to interpret this.  It is a complicated subject. I am still not sure what to think either in terms of overall cost benefit. What I am fairly certain of is that meat is not even close to the most important vector to attack with respect to emissions. That should have come across more clearly in this video. Again, meat represents ~4% of our greenhouse gas emissions. Another thing I think they didn't do due enough diligence on is the nutrient bioavailability of meat per greenhouse emission. They only looked at protein. This ignores the overall comparative nutrient/antinutrient profile of plants. I'm not sure we could survive on plants as they're currently cultivated and sold to us. One thing I learned from the video is that the best forms of meat production drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions. This was followed by an argument that the economics of generalizing best practices is impossible. I'm not sure about that. At the moment, we haven't organized ourselves to be maximally efficient at delivering high quality meat on a green economic budget. If we pursue that end, we might just achieve it. As implausible as it may be, lab grown meat may take us much of the way there.
I saw the new thumbnail and actually thought this would look at another side like the nuclear energy ones
BEEF STONKS
On the nutrient side of things. 7 billion people can't rely on only plant food. We need a lot more space to grow our crops in comparison to the space used by animals. Which will lead to more deforestation. As well that this knowledge isn't understood all around the world. To connect the world to make it a better place, it still has to overcome the world of politics, and the usual human greed. Call me pessimistic, but this is a lost cause.
'No other bodily pleasure happens several times a day which our parents love' 🤨🤨
I had no idea everyone picks up their veggies from the docks.
If we all turned vegan, there would be less people as well!  That's because, after a year of eating tons of peanut butter, most of us would go nuts and start killing people!  Or even ourselves!
So more ppl are gonna eat more cheese and other dairy products .. and Oh wait... More methane production again huh ..... bummer.. Or do as Jureskogs hamburger in Sweden and he buys milk cows and slaughters then for burgers.. Problem solved.. and no need to make a big deal out of this.. Also .. all avocados are being shipped from Mexico.. and the cartel in Mexico owns all avocado farms.. sooo entire world funds organized crime..
A bit dissapointed that the ethics involved in animal farming hasn't been covered.
The line "..if you find the most environmentally friendly beef in the world.." made me thinkk of lab-grown meat from stem cells. How 'bout that?
8:20 I've heard that we are able to feed cows waste products of crops we already eat such as corn husks resulting in no wasted pastures for animals. Does anyone how realistic such a solution would be?
The main issue i find about the whole diet dilemma is the extremes of opinions. Eating massive ammounts of meat is bad. Eating no meat at all isn't a good solution either. The thing is, something i have only seen a handful of people recognize at all, is that there is a whole area of middleground. There are no simple solutions to the complex problems we face.  Our best shot at improvement is eating _less_ meat and balancing it out while _also_ buying meat that is as responsibly produced as _reasonably possible._ We simply have to take responsibility for our own living standards, something seemingly most people are not willing to do.  It's small steps in the right direction but at least small steps are possible compared to the alternatives. You don't move a pile of rocks all at once. You have to move each rock one at a time.
Meat love didn't do well guys. Switch it to Meat Hate!
They changed the thumbnail lol
Glad you made this for the normies
Chickens don't need to exclusively eat feed crops. They can eat bugs and weed seeds as a highly functional part of a composting system. Carbon-Sequestration farming exists and is real. Please do a video about this.
There's no such thing as "useless grass"!
Honestly I’m completely cool w giving up beef if everyone else would. Not just not going to eat it to make a point. I love this planet and would do a whole lot to save it
There are a lot of reasons for not producing or eating meat. Wheter it's (animal/transport) emissions, earth use or animal welfare; all those reasons are valid. But - as I like to point out - those things do not happen the moment a person EATS meat. It's all those steps before, that matter. Put the pressure where it belongs, please.
Unlike most of their other videos, I feel like this one doesn't really flesh out the issue enough.  Food is pivotal, and I feel it deserves more effort and attention to detail.  Diversity in our agriculture and in our diets is important.  I feel like the big elephant in the room was the statistic about dropping production of beef by 70% to reduce the waste of resources that could be put directly towards food.  Could we consider the possibility that reduction of beef consumption, rather than elimination, is the answer?  How much would we need to reduce?  Also it is difficult for me to believe that these statistics about transportation emissions are accurate.  I have heard about a shipment of watermelons that traveled three times across the US before being sold to a store.  This is because of our commodification of food and lack of regulation in the market to reduce emissions.    Another consequence of trading food like stock, which is important to discuss in this context, is food waste.  How much carbon could we save if our stores were smaller and we wasted less food?  Also certain animals can be used to turn waste into valuable food.  Factory farming is a nightmare and lacks the frugality of the truly local farmer, and our distribution methods fill dumpsters with food waste that is illegal to collect while thousands of people die of starvation in the US.    Also what about those of us whose diet needs to not be soy-based?  Or people with digestive issues that need the nutrition density?   We should always discuss food wholistically instead of in one context.
"No other bodily pleasure is experienced multiple times a day and never gets old." 😏
The deer I eat is carbon neutral.
use me as the dislike button
Why the change in the thumbnail?
I can think of another bodily pleasure that is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old 0:02
Does anyone else feel like this video feels a lot less like Kurzgesagt than usual? Like, idk. I feel like they barely did what they usually do. They said it's complicated and gave what feels a one sided opinion making it feel less complicated more...idk what to call it really. But it just felt like it was done by someone else
“Even if you use the best beef, still some emissions” ImpossibleFoods: “Yeah, riiiight, totally can’t make beef that tastes and works just the same in a laboratory, but still it’s juicier” “Or growing meat cells in two weeks instead of methane emitting two years” So, I get it, both sides of the argument are true.
The most important question of the millennium - is it true that fighting the causes of global warming is less harmful for humanity than fighting its consequences? Is it really cheaper to reshape the entire world economy, various hardships and increase the cost of everything, than a more effective fight against forest fires, the construction of protective dams against floods or strengthening the banks? I do not understand at all the idea that the modern world with deserts and glaciers is beautiful, because the biosphere triumphed just in much hotter times with a lot of carbon dioxide, and not in cold ones.
So what methods of beef production result in that 9kg of CO2 per 100g of protein?
This is basically a response to "What I've learned"s Video response to your first meat Video. I can't wait for his response to your response to his response.

“Foods the only bodily pleasure that’s enjoyed multiple times a day” right…
There are lots of people starving in Brazil while you eat our cheap meat, soy beans and other produce. I mean cheap for you guys, our disastrous government mde the exchange rate astronomical, we pay for meat, food and gas in dollar earn our money in reais that is 6 times less valuable. It's not just about meat production it's about the exploration of third world resources and peoples. Unregulated "free" market is what is destroying our planet.
we now should think about what we have called 'foods', Are they really are the 'foods?
I'm happy to give up eating meat, having children and to travel as long as our gracious overlords can enjoy their trips to space, their private jets and their large families. They deserved it. What an affront would be to them if us lowly useless beings, while trying to lessen our suffering, would damage the playground of our beloved demi-gods! We should not permit it.
Hold up am I dumb or did the thumbnail change
🎣 😋
Meat is so bad that it was the main reason our brains evolved to what it is today.    You know what you call plant eaters?  Prey.
What have a problem with, in the modern conversations about climate change and what we should to combat it, is that the average person is pressured and made to feel bad about their every day choices, which may or may not have some effect on the worlds climate. However, the politicians get free passes to fly, alone on their own private jets and make political profits from organizations and corporations that are the much larger culprits to their proposed climate problems. They want you to feel bad while they do their own part to ruin the planet, and until they change their actions to speak with their words, I will not be changing my diets, using different cleaning products or even using less electricity. Until they stop, I will not, because why should I reduce my carbon thumbprint, while rich leave thier own massive footprints without thinking twice about it
0:45 the M O N K E is eating a cow and not leaves!? EASTER EGG
Global warming is a leftist HOAX........... Its nearly 2022 FFS!!!!!!!!! NO WARMING, NO CHANGES, NO SEA LEVEL RISE, just libs and lefties and the so called scientists that are in their back pocket, straight up lying and defrauding the world.
00:04 i can sthink of another but it's not for the kids ;)
Meat is precious our evolution depends in there proteins.
I'm never going to stop eating meat. Figure out another way to save the planet...
In my unprofessional opinion, and going off of this video, I think the best thing wouldn't be to cut meat out of everyone's diet COMPLETELY, but rather to moderate our consumption of it. The best diet isn't just eating plants, but a healthy balance of every food group including meat.
India has 30% of the world's cows and they aren't used for food. Giving up meat is not even a drop in the bucket
And the best thing after going vegan is realizing the world of amazing flavours still available to us, and how eating can still be a source of tons of pleasure. Non-vegan won't believe it, but yeah... once you go vegan you realize that's very much the truth. You CAN help the environment and avoid animal cruelty without actually giving up on the pleasures of food. Highly recommend to anyone who's thinking about it... just give it a shot for a month 😉
Typo! Stonks   I think you mean stocks..? Pretty lazy editing guys.
I thought you had two videos on meat but realized you just switched the thumbnail.... I actually liked the original thumb nail more...
Not going to lie, when I first saw Kurzgesagt I thought it was going to be another purely liberal channel devoted to political talking points. I've watched dozens of their videos, and while I'll sometimes disagree with some of what they say, they source their claims well and are even-handed in their conclusions. Good video guys, even though I love steak and will keep eating it till I die.
i reduce my meat consumption by now
Dislike
So basically you should go vegan if you care about the planet.
Yes
Reducing meat is good,  and "you don't have to go 100% vegan or vegetarian ... it isn't all or nothing. If you replace beef with pork or chicken, great. If you eat meat less often or have smaller portions, great. That all helps. I have changed to a mostly vegetarian diet but when I get Thai food (a couple times a month) I opt for chicken."
*chose dislike button*
Yes the burger i have once in a month is destroying the planet not the corporations guys…
The farmers aren’t gonna be happy about this one
If you don’t like something then don’t indulge in it.  If I like something and you’re constantly doing research and making up stuff just for me to not like it im gonna ask you to stay right there while I go get my bat🤣
y'all made a whole vid on climate, when that's a million times NOT the reason humans shouldn't eat meat. Eating other life forms to stay alive is the lowest frequency you can vibrate on in the entire universe.
Yeah I’m not gonna eat bugs or “vegan meat” but I wonder how long that will last until we are “mandated” too do that.
So the answer is yeah, pretty much
if we still would have Likes and Dislikes to see how this heated topic is received would have been nice.  If youtube changes this anyway, why not a more productive solution: A kind of Star Rating that can be reviewed before Watching.  would clear out a bit the clickbait culture and let quality Videos like this shine more.  (I know the problem would be that the fanbase of a creator then pushes a rating up or down depending on the following, but It seems like a better inovation than remove the Option.) Kind Regards gentle reader.
There is also a huge problem of not having circular farming. For exemple, soy is grown in brazi, shipped to central europe where a lot of pork is produced. The fertilizers from the pigs isn't used to grow soy in brazil. The fertilizers destroys the ground in central europe as it can't process that amount. The production isn't circular which dosen't show in the CO2 calculations.
I say people just leave other peoples diets alone. And if they don't want meat, then don't eat meat. Leave everyone else alone.
It's not just our nature, but also the entire ecosystems and food chains that exist on this planet.  Meat is not bad for you at all, and this vegan bs gets old.
Did they change the thumb nail for this video? Because I swear I saw it with meat love instead of meat hate
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE THUMBNAIL😭😭
Who Creates the majority of the Emissions?    Maybe if that's talked about then we can go somewhere.
Don't forget the emissions created by people going to and from the store. and then the emissions created by running a store and having workers as well as a ton of AC units pumping out hot air. Lets also mention the China creates the majority of the Worlds emissions. Then India and Indonesia regions create the second highest amounts of emissions.  And all of the west combined creates less emissions than Indonesia alone.
Regenerative farming?
So, we could do it?
This is flawed honestly because before humans there were dinosaurs and they burped and farted, so what is the difference now? When we also burp and fart too lol
Can I just be the first to say that cutting down trees for cattle isn't even necessary to have cattle. Large hooved animals literally live in the forest all over America perfectly fine. So we could make beef less destructive by just keeping the trees.
FUCK Climate - WHY IS THE PAIN BEING FACED BY THE ANIMALS NOT THE CENTRAL ISSUE? BEING SLAUGHTERED IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS EVERYDAY!
Make a better milk video your sources were corrupt outdated and you know it  I love your vids tho
It is simple, we can't live without emmissions.
It's a real shame you didn't even talk about research looking for ways to reduce greenhouse emissions from beef meat. Seaweed is one example of that, reducing about 80% of methane content in burps and farts from cows.
While the environmentalist argument is convincing, it is totally unnecessary. The fact that a cow feels is far more important than that it farts.
Many people, including me, grew up with the concept of eating your meals with a piece of meat every day. I think this is the problem. We developed a habit for eating meat every day. Now as I live by myself and have grown accustomed to many different meals, I find myself rid of that habit. I eat meat whenever I want to and by average, this is not much. There are so many good meals with and without meat. Diversify your food portfolio!
The first three minutes sums it up pretty quickly. Meat is really that bad compared to fruits and vegetables. HERE ARE SOME VEGAN FILMS I RECOMMEND WITHOUT SEEING VIOLENCE TOWARDS ANIMALS: 1. Conspiracy with Leo DiCaprio. Here's some vegan films with violence towards animals 🔪🐰: 1. Earthlings (Powerful Message behind it),2. Dominion (I WILL NEVER WATCH THIS MAN) 😭
0:46 monke holding cow
No
instead of chopping down trees, why dont we just use bamboo? it renewable
Yes Meat is bad.
Short answer: Yes. Long answer: Yes, it is.
This suggests that if everyone became vegan that we would save a load of land but what about the land needed to grow the vegetables to feed a huge influx of vegans??
One thing that the anti-meat argument tends to avoid addressing is the ecological impact of releasing all of these farm animals back into the wild. Not even taking into account how sudden shifts in the population ratio of prey vs predator animals affect population growth, the increased competition for resources among animals, or the strain on plant life from a massive increase in roaming herbivores, there's the microbe issue that could lead to the unintentional decimation of existing wildlife. Much like how indigenous populations were ravaged by diseases introduced during the era of exploration and colonization, there are pathogens that domesticated animals have adapted to which wildlife have not encountered before. Getting humans off of meat is still going to require a massive culling of livestock before they can be reintroduced into the wild.
cocaine is more enjoyable than food, but of course the consequences are more so lol
Tune in next time for topics such as "Are class A carninogens really that dangerous to ingest" "and is slaughter and factory farming actually a torcherous hellhole like in the videos?" "Do we actually need to adress a leading driver of climate change, ocean hypoxic deadzones, deforestation, fresh water/land allocation, carbon emition?"
You could prove that beef killed all my family. I would still eat it.
Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshill
The thumbnail...changed..
The graphic at 5:45 is so misleading. Have yall ever seen an industrial dairy cow? Those things do NOT look happy.
I mean, humans fart too. Maybe we should end humans to save the climate.
Glad that you guys changed the thumbnail. Have to say, it was awful.
*Meat fan tries Vegan*: Uugghh disgusting *Vegan tries meat*: Oh damn, this is actually good
Where's meat Love?!?? I didnt have time to watch it.
Consume soy and be happy, peasent.
Lab grown meat
Go Vegan.
Beef stonks
5:54 8:23 this is just blatantly dishonest, the majority of cattle feed is inedible to humans, corn husks, oat husks, glass and ect are all used to feed cattle and most live stock. So to say they are using resources and food that other people could use is just silly.
I’m surprised you didn’t include fish! I wanted to know how much pollution pescatarians contribute
O melhor canal do youtube, sem duvida alguma! Thank's for the subtitles and the great work!
8:52 this isn’t actually true since livestock aren’t fed soybeans they are fed fodder which is often a byproduct of soybean farming.
I am envious of people whose country has greenery, and cows can be seen grazing lazily in vast fields. My country is so small and overpopulated (with the lowest forest rate in Europe) that we only have slaughterhouses. I did once see a sad cow in this barren fenced area the size of a small classroom, with dry cracked ground and no shade from the blazing sun. But i don’t count it as humane.
For those wondering, there are 8.7k dislikes as of this time. You can download an extension called "Return YouTube Dislike by Dmitrii". Thank me later.
it's not complicated. animals feel pain. humans have been causing them pain. and we need to stop. end of discussion
Didn't see anywhere in here about regenerative farming where farms are operating at a carbon negative.
Can someone explain what is meant by kg of CO2 equivalent? At 4:31 it is shown that a cargo ship emits 0.3kg of CO2 per kg of cargo. That would mean that a cargo ship becomes 30% lighter over a single trip (losing 30,000+ tons into thin air in a single trip). That cannot be true if interpreted literally, so what does that metric actually mean?
Go vegan. :)
Natural climate change would have Earth currently entering into an ice age. We have been warming the planet for thousands of years through agriculture, we would be too cold if we hadn't been. Some climate change is good, it was not until the industrial revolution when it became too rapid and bad.
Nice video! Thank you for elaborating... So... There are too many humans on this planet? Nature always finds a way... The humans are living too long lives and that is why we have these problems! But if humans die (for example, by getting sick of some virus), governments mandate vaccines to save us all? Humans are an idiot species!!!
Wasn't this meat love?
Wait it went from Meat Love to Meat Hate?
💪😎👍 - me irl   🦵🦵
i like how they changed the thumbnail from a happy cow to an angry cow
Ow another fear mongering "meat bad" "co2 will kil us all" video. I guess money doesnt sting anyone but let me tell you this, during pleistocene era we had roughly 400% more co2 in athmosphere yet trees were growing 100m tall, live was blooming. If anyone is old enough like me this narration of climate change will kil us all is beeing played over 3 decades now. Venice was supose to under water like 10 times already  and recently water level there starte to reduce as fun fact. I think channels like this should all get "Gates lab meat stamp of aproval". If anyone didnt get hint- all of those videos including this one are sponsored.
Me: “I love how Kurzgesagt makes science understandable”  Kurzgesagt: *beef stonks*
If meat ends up being banned and eating meat becomes illegal I'm going all in I'll hunt vegan's for meat!
Nutrient pill WHEN!? Food is such a hassle
8:16tis hits hard feel free to scrensoot
no.
“I want to help but I could never give up meat and dairy” —99% of vegans, before going vegan.   You got this.
I work in retail and I've had to deal with vegetarian and vegan customers harass those buying meat products for years but never the other way around.  When the video talks about emotional it's people getting tired of being harassed by moron vegans.
Oh yeah I forgot that plant foods are never transported by land vehicles, as soon as the cargo ship docks, all the food just magically teleports from container to store shelf!
if each community had their own respective farms, so many of the issues we see today with modern agriculture would be gone.
vegan propoganda.
I'm curious how best beef stacks up to worst plant when you go back to considering nutrient density.
Here me out,  thousands of acres producing food to raise animals we eat,   What if instead they grew a bunch of high protein vegetables, seeds, beans, fruits.  Cut out the middle man aka the animals
Global climate change cause by human race is the bullshit of the century. Caused by cattle is the second one.
Hey can you talk about people that always stays fat or slim like me. I really wanna know bout my body
dislike
You really comparing apples to meat instead of apples to apples on this one, figuratively and literally. What about transporting avocado from port to the store? like meat from the butcher shop? Also what about avocado nutrition and production cost? How can anyone with just a tiny bit of critical thinking take your content srsly and put trust into it when you start your presentation with comparisons like this?   I used to really like this channel content for its scientific approach, but the more political and controvercial your topics became the more problems started to sip through the cracks. At this point you are no better then average activist channel with a budget behind it and a huge confirmation bias from subscribers, hidden dislikes and people in the comment section calling anyone whos opposing your opinion "uneducated" just makes it worse.
but doesn't methane and other greenhouse gasses are produced by other living things, humans included...we also fart and burp!!?....in a cycle of things...balance is the key...global imbalance is due to many reasons....dams forest mining etc...electricity...the world has been at balance before industrialisation... yes chance the habit ...use less pollthie and focus on the 74% not the 20 %....which regardless of what we do will be there.....why not add emissions from lions, tigers and elephants...
the thumbnail changed love meat to hate meat LOL
I can live without eating cow, i'm not the biggest consumer of sheep but I do like it, and although bacon taste like heaven it's not something I've ever treated much differently than junk food, a lot of moderation. But I will never stop eating chicken, kind of glad to see its carbon emissions are very low. And although it's not on the list I also eat a lot of fish, I would never stop eating chicken and fish, the rest I can live without
Short answer : No
I'd agree that 1st worlders need to eat less meat in order to feed the rest of the world but feeding them grains we'd normally feed to animals isn't as sustainable for those population's health. They'd lack b12s, omega 3s, heme-iron, myoglobin, zinc. Not to mention the downsides of a high carb grain based diet. I think a better place to start is to reduce food waste, and in the U.S just less consumption for the sake of consumerism. I ask you how many of you eat from boredom? how many fast?
Tell that to carnivores :P
yo the thumbnail change!
It's fine in moderation
my opinion, personally, is that there's no easily conceivable way to completely phase out beef quickly, but I think we should work towards steering our culture away from beef and towards less carbon footprint heavy meats, get yourself a McChicken instead of a big mac, things like that. Feed our children less beef to steer their early developing palate away from it, get your children accustomed early on to foods that are better for the environment, so that they will prefer it later, and feed their own children the food they've learned to like. It's much harder to change our own habits and diets the way we are now, but for children, they haven't really developed their habits and preferences yet. Obviously we will have to work on changing our own habits and diets too, and it may seem unfair to feed your children food different to what you're eating, or to make a separate meal for them than for yourself, but steps must be taken to change humanity's culture on the way we consume products, and culture is not something easily broken or changed in a single generation, it takes a concentrated effort and lifetimes of minor steps to make lasting changes.   Obviously, we don't quite have that time, but if we can cut out as much emissions as we can, we can give ourselves more time to work on changing our culture to avoid simply falling back into the same issues after we think "the problem is gone now, we can go back to the way we were"
Fun Fact: A Vegetarian started World War 2.
What about artificial meat ? I haven't seen much information about its viability and emission if it was massively produced. Could that be a durable solution to this problem ?
The older fans remember when the thumbnail used to have a cow with heart eyes with the caption Meat Love.
Food is sustenance. In the struggle for survival taste does not come into it. If we want to survive then we all must go vegan. This is the only possible hope for our species. We are creating a hell on earth for the other animals and we are destroying the planet in the process. Save yourselves! Go Vegan!🌱
Yeah ... it sucks. In the end the choice is yours, be part of the problem or part of the solution.
"what are you gonna do with this information?" continue eating meat that's what I'm gonna do.
Hey didn't the thumbnail change
What if someone radically just performed cow genocide? Sorry cows but just what if? 🤔 People wouldn’t have to give up meat 🥩
Hey! A few days ago you had a different cover called "Meat Love" with a smiley cow face! What's up with that??? Bring it back!!!
Doesn't like 90% of carbon emissions come from like 2 countries? I don't think the rancher in Montana with 100 cows is even coming close to a contributing factor.
Repeating old debunked arguments, ignoring the criticisms of your claims, and adding new data without context. Yep, it's a Kurzgesagt video. Some points; methane from cows, ignoring that fact that it is a closed loop system, what is the answer? Exterminate all high methane emitting animals? oh, very green. Comparing meat vs veg based on weight, rather than nutritional value, oh how very scientific.  Failing to mention that most of the crops "grown to feed animals" are in fact a by product of the crops grown for humans.
Unsurprisingly, ruminants meat is the worst.
Conclusion: there are too many people. Forced sterilizations are needed.
It seems that vegan propaganda has hit this channel too...
This remembers me of the debate about water and livestock, wich supposedly drank and used a lot more water than plants but a quick research could prove that because rain is a thing and pee is another so livestock actually wasn't using world ending amounts of water.    Im not saying kurzgesagt is wrong, just telling y'all a quick fact I saw on another video some weeks ago.
These videos are unentertaining as fuck. Just make a space one already
The way he calmly says: We will run out of our carbon budget till 2100
There is a BIG discussion on how the carbon footprint is calculated. You should present that more clear instead of just brush it. Even on the video when they put the lower carbon foot print for a grass-fed beef on non-crop land it there is room for discussion. I agree that a big chunk of the discussion is people trying to justify eating meat, but still it is not black and white. In the end you will just make people that want to eat meat disagree with you. All the industries have their shitty side. E.g. What about almond milk and dry California?
Thumbnail is now in darkmode.
when a video almost convinced you to be vegetarian
Well, I want a good steak
Sorry bud. I wont give up eating beef until China, India, and other nations completely cut their mass waste production. Which will never happen. I WILL NEVER GIVE UP EATING BEEF AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHA.
There's some vegan teacher lovers innyhis comment thread
Did anyone elae notice the thumbnail change ?
Hi! I am a big fan of your videos. I wanted to know where do you source the data from? The percentages? How reliable are they?🤔
Yes, it is bad for the planet
This video has convinced me to go back to eating meat.  Thanks Kurzgesagt!
this thumbnail was a happy cow, now its angy cow
Europeans discussing co2 emissions while nobody sees that africa and asia are gonna be 85% of entire worlds population Europe and america dont matter much. Even if we were carbon neutral still there are foregin governments that will do anything to make their countries comparable to ours and they wont halt production and let their population starve or allow prices to go up so much. International law has no power. I hate this so much about euros. Blind short sighted cattle believing they are second christ for refusing to buy straws.
I know this video is about emissions and not human health, but veggie patties are full of trans fats and aren't healthy. In terms of health, we need to have more saturated fats like coconut oil, butter, and taloe. If the world switched away from healthy fats and foods, it would increase the amount of metabolic diseases and would be an entirely different sort of problem. Presumably worse or at least equivalent to global warming in terms of humanity surviving as a species.
the problem is *capitalism* this is an objective fact
I dont think many people dispute the enviormental issuen with beef. However I as most others simply dont give a shit. Beef is just so damn tasty.
Why can't I see the dislikes count?
Someone please explain to me then why a veggie burger costs a dollar (or more) more than a beef burger.  If you want people to change their eating habits, don't make it more expensive to change.  Money talks and it always talks loudest.
AWESOME content! With so much insights, and always with these beautiful art and animations
Go vegan everybody. I've never eaten as good since I became vegan. And it's better for health, climate and obviously the animal abuse
Yeah as someone who absolutely loves meat and grew up on a meat heavy diet, I think its about time we face it that this lifestyle is not only unsustainable in the long run but also imoral.  People get scared thinking about a life without meat, but honestly thats because we were conditioned by an industry to think and live this way.  Today, most of us have access to almost any ingredient from all around the world. We can make a near infinite amount of dishes. It wouldnt take long for us to adapt and forget meat in its entirety.
of course, if we stopped eating meat, what would we do with all the cows and livestock???
What about getting the food to the freight ships
use me as a dislike button
so we should just... not eat. boom. problem solved.
No meat good, that's why this world is tooth and claw
The main fact people forget is that in animals and plants, the carbon is just being cycled. The methane emitted just breaks down into CO2 and is reabsorbed by plants. Compared to fossil fuels which release LOCKED UP carbon, which is the main issue.
If locally transported meat emits 18kg CO2/kg meat - wouldn't 1kg of vegetables emit the same when transported from the harbor to the shops and home?
This is such a stupid video.
can you make an arabic channel it would be great since you already did a spanish one . and if you dont have someone to do the arabic voiceover ill be happy to do it for you for free
that monkey needs to let go of the cow
Was hunting for meat talked about in this video at all? Would it even be relevant?
How do these numbers compare against things like fish? I'm a strength athlete, so meat(specifically fish like sardines, tuna, and salmon, as well as pork and chicken- I don't eat beef, or eat it extremely sparingly, for the reasons mentioned in the video) make up a pretty large portion of my diet. I'd be curious to know what kinds of meat are the best to focus on for environmental reasons, even if I can't ultimately substitute them for vegetables.
Im not vegan or vegetarian but have cut down significantly on meat 1) because factory farms and the way they treat animals are awful. As a pet owner I cannot reconcile the conflicting emotions of being an animal lover" but also supporting that and 2) the cost of meat has just sky rocketed. Again, I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but I eat meat maybe once or twice a week as opposed to every day and I really do enjoy it. Extra firm tofu is cheap and pretty versatile.
If a rational person sees this information, and still continues to eat the same amount of meat, it just shows how we are no better than chimps and we totally deserve extinction.  Oh by the way, if you still hate vegans after watching this video, you have issues.
All good and dandy but ya know what the problem really is? Too many humans plain and simple. Two choices 1) limit human population keep living how you want. 2) let humans pop keep growing and continue down the rabbit hole of is this too harmful of food all the way to only food item being extremely gross goo. 3) start harvesting carbon out of the air.
don't know it anyone has seen this but there is a fertilizer shortage world wide. why because we turned off parts of the economy that makes key parts all in the name of climate change. the world is only three missed meals from revolution. stock up now on beans and rice.
oh yes, beef stonks XD
No one ever mentions how much C02 and methane humans create just by living. If people supposedly want to reduce deaths caused by climate change a good place to start would be to reduce births. Over population is the root of it all.
iirc we don't use that much crops to feed animals, for example wheat: we keep grains for further production and we use what's left to feed cows
Guess we gotta murder all the cows, only the rich will get to eat the beef now.
if you dislike this video like this comment.
Meat is not a problem, humans are, because we are overpopulated.
Eating steak while watching this. Want more steak.
Don't care, still eating beef. Veggie burgers are awful for you.
This gave me a urge to get KFC , no jokes
I cannot remove beef from my diet. I have certainly made an effort to reduce where I can. It's the best I can do for now without re-negging on the change.
What I want to know is chemical fertilizers vs manure etc. If we completely went off animal products, how would fertilizer work. Or is it so aggressively chemical already it wouldn't make a difference.
The thing I dont get is why are cow farts so much worse than other animals. Also arent those cow fart emissions basicly the same as thr wild big animals we eliminated? Hear me out, humans killed like 40mil bisons in the us and other big animals were treated probably simularly. That must have accounted to about the same emissions even before humans or not that far of right?
You guys represent Bill Gates now. So sad.
There is the advent of petri dish grown meat. Would that, too, be a significant imprint on the environment? While people generally don't like the idea of meat grown that way - it beats the meat (kind of a pun?) grown in wasteful ways or torturous environs live stock are kept in At least that's a minor speculation and thought process I recently had after watching this video   Thanks Kurzgesagt team
The underlying problem of almost all environmental issues is overpopulation.  I‘m not willing to limit myself as long as literally nothing is done to counter that.
scary.. poor animals
Anyone else notice the thumbnail change?
PLEASE SUPPORT NOW IN TURKISH
tbh humanity and the meat factories are x1000 worse than the holocaust, at least one is over while the other is widely ignored at humans breeding life in torture factories for food that is optional, thers other forms of food out there...
You changed the Thumbnail
You've shortened your videos a lot, by the longer filler at the end
Can we stop acting like people changing diets and parts of their daily lives will have significant change? Most emissions are from large corporations, obviously if they cleaned their act it would affect our lives, but people est diff isn't gunna start that.
What I gather from some of your videos is that there is no way human beings will be able to sustain its growth. Eventually some sort of cataclysm will happen.
The main hurdle for factory meat right now is feed - because, you know, cells don't have teeth.  :v
👉 Like this comment if you "DISLIKE" this video 👎👎👎 (since there's no Dislike count anymore)
why not drones with co2 collectors
That's why Sanatana Dharma aka Hinduism, has always been the way forward! 1000s of years ago texts were written on vegetarian diets. Ayurveda and some other Sanskrit texts too have described these things. Tamasic, sattvik and other varieties of food exist.  India is truly a blessing in disguise. Has carb rich foods, fat rich foods and for protein, lentils, eggs, soy products have been available.
Another vege-eco propaganda movie
Please everyone who can, try to switch to a plant-based diet as much as you can. Not only for the environment, but also the atrocities that animals have to suffer due to the large meat industry. These are social and intelligent animals, who like to play and snuggle. Especially cows and pigs. They should all be allowed to roam grasslands freely and live happy lives :)
Meat is the most nutrient dense food you can eat, especially liver, and that's it, no debate about it
Can you please write a book about climate change? that would be really good for everyone!
Kinda misleading. What about the avocado 🥑? The production of that do produce more Co2 than a car drive there last two years. I know meet is bad but still, why was it not in the video
Eat the bugs, wagie.
IN SHORT, YES!  STOP EATTING IT IMMEDIATELY SO THERE IS MORE FOR ME!!!!
How can I care about something I'm indifferent about? I want to care about the Earth and the climate, but I just don't. A lot if very serious facts were in this video, and it did nothing to make me care even in the slightest. I really wish I did care. Makes me upset that I don't.
Franch translation is best... Think you a lot kurzgesagt
Meat shouldn't be treated as food, meat are body parts from murdered individuals. But yes one cannot ignore that we do in fact eat them, so I guess it makes it food anyways, just sad that we use beings full of life and emotion, for us to eat them in the end.
Was a vegan, mostly vegan still but do eggs now- only specific eggs tho
Ok but like for food carbon emissions isn't it like a cycle because they can't grow from nothing, they're taking CO2 from the air and converting it into carbon based things
Were the numbers given for the carbon costs of the various foods already balanced for the amount of carbon those foods take out of the environment to grow?
Please tell me that the image change because I swear to Marie Curie it was a lovely heart-shaped eyes before . . .
but all human emision are 1% of all CO2 Emision
There is another animal: People who eat octopuses  Who eat this... Thing?
Meat will always continue to be eaten in my house. Should beef, pork and Chicken become unavailable for whatever reasons, vegetarian humans will be grilled and eaten instead.
1:12 "Rice emits methane" Wait what?
The shipping part of the video was intellectually dishonest because the last mile of transportation happens for all food, but in the visual, they only show veggies being shipped on containers and only meat being moved on trucks. It's not a statement so they can get away with it, but it's obviously a visual manipulation tactic. Let's not ignore the fact that meat has a higher nutrient density. Meaning the emission cost of transportation of meat may likely be less per nutrient.
I am living in NZ and just received your immune books. For me, who just graduated from high school in A level biology and chemistry all the terms used in the books are clear and those explainations of different cell. It is much easier than just straight dive into university book, and it is good as for a preparation for those who want to further study in cellular process in uni. Overall my experience is amazed and I want make this suggestion to everyone: “buy this book whether if this is your hobby, or if think you want prepare for higher level courses you would go further in uni. This book definitely introduce an good start, even though many process didn’t going to too much of the detail, but you can expand on the basics provided in the book in your further study”.
10:08 moderation can help a lot and with many things including this
I feel like Kurzgesagt changing the thumbnail is some sort of social experiment.
I feel like the real crux of the issue isn't so much how something is produced or consumed, but how MUCH it's produced or consumed. As cows that graze on pasture which is unsuitable for human food production only make up about 13% of our beef production, then surely cutting down our beef consumption to about 13% would create a much better picture for climate change.
Can you talk about cultured meat?
You guys should make a video about lab grown meat and how would that affect the world if we switched all meat production to lab grown.
Actually awful video, very surprised that one of the clear questions: is it unethical to kill animals, isn't explored (did I miss it??). The video assumes several other virtuous things: reducing carbon footprint, having an efficient diet and supply chain, but decides to not address one of the most critical questions. Embarrassing, and overly fetishistic of "science" as something that would naturally care about some things and not others.
nah, I'm not gonna give up meat, can't do vegetarian and definitely can't do vegan
"well its complicated" ----- Kurzgesagt
Don't particularly give a shit about pork and beef, but don't touch my fish and chicken!
boo aye hated this autistic left hand presentation. *buys cows*
I'm eating chicken will watching this
No dislikes... Think I'll just pass on this video entirely, sorry guys... I think a lot of people probably feel the same.
People called me that a lot  Meat and daring  It's funny
Every time i see one of these videos, the idea of killing every human seems good, and thats scary
got confused by the thumbnail change
Good valid points, what about animal cruelty though? why is that still too taboo to talk about?
What about alternative, more efficient animal protein sources? like locusts or mealworms? Even if it's culturally unnaxepted they should be conssidered more often in this  kind of discussions.
It’s misleading to compare transporting meat locally to transporting veggies globally.  The point is local transport is more harmful (yet unavoidable) than global, efficient transport.  Eating meat isn’t a sin, but exclusively consuming it in fast food form is certainly a waste.  Favoring grass fed beef and shopping locally, if possible, are enough to keep your conscience quiet.  Also don’t waste anything, use the bones for broth and consume the liver and other organs.  Thinking big picture and climate change about your eating habits seems like a couple jumps past what is useful to us.  Personally I’m way more concerned with the additives and extra processing that is used for everything at your typical supermarket.  I want real food, even if it farts!
So simply put, we should be eating a plant-based diet sourced from farmer's markets and micro-farming where possible.
Did the thumbnail changed or am I from a different universe?
When it comes to meat I always think of the Ecological Pyramid. It states that it takes like 10,000 calories to make 1,000 calories of meat, so if we skipped the meat and used those calories ourselves we would gain a lot. It's the main reason why I try to eat less meat.
Specious information check out Joel salitins grazing methods it's the only way to cure a non man made problem that's right liberalism
At one point we will turn into pandas who will spend 90% of their wake time eating bamboo just to get their nutrients instead of eating meat like all the other bears.
2:48 thats false. Okinawans ate 67% of their calories off a potato and live the longest (also eating virtually no beef)
"Food is not optional"  Wealthy country leaders looking at Africa:*Laughing intensifies*
Not really, but not everyone is ok with killing cattle. I guess that I am feminazi 🤣🤣🤣🤣 I'm cool with killing cattle
I'm having steak tonight
For the life cycle data, we should also see what the benefits and disadvantages of its side products are, for example, is having dairy, manure and leather from the beef industry compared to maybe soy with mangos that create pleather and man made fertilizers?  Beef alone as a food is not the only product that comes out of the cow industry and I’m curious if we’d see better or worse comparisons.
I will NOT eat vegan shit I will NOT eat soy I will NOT eat insects
When will we realize that carbon emissions/ climate change are just a symptom, not the disease
New thumbnail everyday?
Did they change the thumbnail?
I like the video, summarized a lot of info that I've heard mentioned in conversations but never got a clear expansion on. This is certainly a big thing and a problem, I don't think we humans will ever stop eating meat, kind of grown into our biology as omnivorous. On the other hand I do think that we can get to a place where we stop industrializing meat, personally I'm getting a hunters license, in my country, so that I can get to a point were the only meat I eat is what I've caught myself.  (Btw, this vid also showed me that buying avocadoes is worse then buying meat locally, emission-from-vehicles-wise atleast :P)
hol' up wasn't it meat love why did you change it to meat hate(proceeds to eat chicken burger)
if slaughter houses had glass walls this wouldnt be a question!
I don't want the world to end ☹☹
Love how Kurzgesagt always gives it to you straight. They don't say it outright, but they make it clear that meat is having a pretty big impact on the environment, and there's really no way around that.
“Eat less meat” is like saying don’t  cheat on your spouse on Saturdays, or only bully 4 kids a week.
2:50 so this is why vegan teacher is looking so old, that she could be a grandma
For people who are on the fence and thinking about it, give veganism a shot, it's easier than you would think!   As someone who use to hate on vegans I just wanna say, please stop seeing vegans as bad people. I know it's fun to clown on us, cause you associate us with the liberal pc sjw crowd, but we're just trying to make a change in this world we really believe in. Yes, we can be annoying at times. But at the very least, hear us out on some stuff. Don't just be one of those pricks who needlessly hates on us cause the internet said it was cool to.
One information is missing : what is the equivalent of beef impact if converted to a veggie diet, with similar calory input ? How much more agriculture land would we need if we ate veggies instead of beef? and all meat? (that is to say without taking into account the calory loss that would benefit overweight people eating too much of it). And, if we take some average "correct" calory input diet, how much cropland do we need if we replace the beef by veggies ? Or by pork&poultry? And for a complete veggie diet ? That's an interesting thing to know about.
Kurzgesagt. We need to STOP criticizing each other for our food eating choices. I think this is one of the most reductive videos I've seen on any topic on this channel.  A serious unanswered question:  When you calculate the gas emissions per kilogram of beef, are you calculating for the entire lifespan of the animal? Or just the emissions of processing the beef at the end of it's life?  I have a feeling that calculation is deriving gas emissions from any possible area it can. Every fart of the animal from birth to death. Every inch of land and water consumed. So forth.  I'd be curious to know what the result would be if you include the calories and protein derived from the dairy and other products of the animal throughout it's lifespan. Instead of just a kilogram of beef.  A kilogram of beef is not all that humans gain from a single cow. Why are so many other products being excluded? Milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, ICE CREAM, leather, medical products.  But more importantly:  Why does every one of these arguments against meat (because that's what this video is) seem to pretend that the capitalistic tendencies of meat producers is inevitable and cannot be addressed through legislation? Stop telling meat eating consumers what to do, and start eliminating factory farms.  These videos trying to convince consumers to adopt a vegan and/or vegetarian diet are contributing to global warming. Human beings will continue to eat meat. That's the end of the discussion. But that doesn't mean factory mentality producers have to continue to be allowed to overproduce, pollute our environments and process animal byproducts in ways that cause harm. Your entire position is akin to framing the wrong person for committing a crime. The real perpetrator gets off, and no justice is done.  Regulate the meat industry.
I'm eating two cheeseburgers watching this smd vegans
How about cloning
Vegans<<<
the answer is yes
Eh
What about lab grown meat?
Guess imma go vegetarian.
Never going to stop eating meat and there's nothing you losers can do about it ha!!!
I'll admit I'm glad about the thumbnail change.  Not because of my opinion, but because it genuinely terrified the hell out of me, which is ironic as it was a happy cow and now it's a demonic one.  And no, I'm not criticising the art of course, it just hit the part of the uncanny valley that I personally find creepy.
Kurzgesagt - "Food is arguably the best thing about being alive"  People who hate food: So my life is meaningless then?
Good video, one critique though. What happens to all the inedible parts of a plant? And how big a part are they of the stuff we feed animals? (This only applies to grazers like cow and sheep though)
This is a very disappointing video from your channel. It feels like you should just say that you were sponsored by the Beef or Dairy industry.
The first 20s are false, there is sex.
1:40 Use up our budget by 2,100... What? That figure is absolutely meaningless without a unit of measure.
But why does my hamburger cost so much less than a tofu burger ? I wouldn't have an issue eating less meat but, I can get more meat for less money.
Cattle farming has also significant historic and social implications. For example, in Latin America it reaches back to the reconquista of Spain, where expelling the moors freed-up vast ranges of land that were the given to a select few individuals.   Since these people wanted to live comfortably as nobles, the easiest thing to do was use the vast lands for cattle, as it took the least amount of investment and upkeep.  This process replicated and expanded during the conquest of Latin America, with the continent being carved-up between the descendants of conquistadors and high government officials of the empire.  The result, is that land access for campesinos wanting to grow crops is limited, with cattle over representing the agricultural output of many of these nations.
You are fucking ignorant if yall really don't realize that 70% of all emissions come from large corporations and us eating meat doesn't effect anything the earth is on a natural cycle making the temperatures go up and down
You forgot to mention some of the corn used is unedible to humans. Like using the husks and stuff like that.
​ @Ten Avatar Hahaha, that's exactly why it's such a heated topic. If all people are seeing are arguments of one side that are telling them 'facts' and then someone on that side is accusing them of something then they won't listen, no matter how true those facts are. People are very stubborn when it comes to admitting they were wrong and saying that they are either stupid or guilty of wrongdoing will not change their minds.  In fact, I can almost be sure, that if the dislike button worked you would have a lot more dislikes than likes, because now people may not even bother.
Meat is good, the Earth will be destroyed regardless of our footprint so the best investment is in space exploration
Technically, all humans probably would've been vegan if Adam and Eve hadn't sinned lol. Since it says in the Book Of Genesis, that they befriended the animals God had created, so they didn't kill the animals to eat them or anything. It specifically says they ate from the fruit of the trees. Then, they sinned, and the animals became hostile, and then humans decided to turn them  into food lol.
animal rights
+1 fot Beef stonks
Beware of SIGMA COW IS THUMBNAIL.
The more I hear about climate change, the more I realize that we really need an engineering solution to it. I don't know if we have the capacity as a species to dig deep and give up 90% of the luxuries we've obtained through the industrial revolution for no immediate gain. I'm sure once all the forests catch fire, the crop famines start, the hurricanes and tsunamis destroy our cities, and the great dying commences, we'll be ready for hard times to save our lives. But before that? I seriously doubt it. To really be effective, these solutions need to be government mandated. The government that actually enacts all these bans is going to immediately revert to being a developing nation that's deciding not to develop. And that's how civil wars start. It just isn't going to work in a timely enough manner to *prevent* a climate disaster. By some metrics, disaster is where we are already, and we're still sluggish to peel back our progress.  The Deep Adaptation paper probably puts forth what is, unfortunately, the most realistic solution: learn to live on the pressure cooker version of earth.
Actually, it is impossible for cows to fart. I hate when people think that farting cows affects climate change when they don't exist. Due to their 4 compartment stomachs, or in other words runimantary digestive system the only way they can "pass gas" is by burping
I'd like to see a video about how sociopaths run the world. Basically, money is power and the more heartless someone is, the more they're able to make money. People who prop up and expand current power structures are rewarded the most, though they also are disposable pawns. Furthermore, Objectivism is playing out its eugenic tendencies, where only the wealtby can afford to have children. Are we as a species eradicating empathy? And is this view point simply false, and it's that any given in-group is myopic, the horror of our systems too abstracted? Lastly, what do we do in response to these massive power structures? What if everyone grew a garden? If neoliberalism is a cancer upon humanity, are we doomed in its face? Will a few sociopathic billionaires be the only remaining bastion of sapience to explore the universe when the planet dies?
As a son of a dairy, i feel attacked...
Is carbon dioxide really that bad?
why isnt anyone trying to build an artificial cow? wouldnt that bypass the morality of using a living being as food source
No information on how much carbon the cattle industry sequesteres or the amount of byproducts that cattle recycle?  Kind of important info no?
8:16 - Beef stonks -70% Petition for this to be a new meme format
Population control is the solution I think
I think the point of the anger towards videos making this kind of case is that they’re narrowing the context until it seems like removing meat makes tons of sense, and also taking a perspective which assumes very very little of human ingenuity.  People are healthier with red meat as a staple, and will not function well with cereal based diets. The video isn’t referencing biology, economics, third world manufacturing technology, all of which is relevant to the meat eater, but not to the narrow framing “Is meat bad for the environment (in this context under these measurement)”?  If we truly need to eat meat, we will figure out a way to make it sustainable. If we truly can’t, we’ll figure out a way to make cereal not cancer inducing. Right now, meat is your healthiest option. That might be a shame given what’s in the video, but in actuality there’s a lot more to it and you’re perfectly justified in eating meat.   Treating it like a problem to be solved by a shopper going vegan is pretty silly.
I love you<3
Damn that's horrible! People need to change their diets asap. On an unrelated topic, this beef burger tastes great :)
No mention of Permaculture?  ...basically misinformation then.....
There’s a lot not addressed here.  For example how we don’t waste meat products any where near as badly as plant products.  Most food waste is not meat because we value it more highly and store it in ways where it is less likely to go bad.  Also he said that only 30% of cows are fed with grass and implied the rest are fed with crops.  This is true but misleading.  Most of the crops they are fed are not the whole crop but the parts of the crops we don’t eat.  Over 80% of all animal feed is inedible for humans.
I speak Latvian tu zini kar visiem tiem kuri palīdz civlēkam un tu vari dabūt to no civlēkiem un jie nu mammas iznāk tikai 0-23/10000000 civlēkiem tat tu vari paņemt no tiem civlēkiem un dabūt tos kas saplīst.
In our current world, I can't understand why CO2 emission information is not required on packaging of food. Nutritional information is required, why isn't CO2 emission? Instead of focusing on the type of food, whether it be meat, vegetables, fruit, or others, we could instead focus on the actual CO2 emission caused by that specific product.  Of course this wouldn't be easy - how are you supposed to know through right? - but how about nutritional information, isn't that difficult as well? Isn't it just a matter of privatisation?  I'm not an expert on the area, but I've been wondering about CO2 emission information on product packaging for a long time, and it would be helpful for us consumers to pick a certain product over another one, to more actively seek the green alternative.
i farted while watching this and felt guilty...
The solution - cut the human population in half.
My local farmer doesn't deliver 1kg of beef per trip. Let's say they deliver 100kg. According to you 180kg of co2, which corresponds to about 78L of gasoline burnt.  If they drive a commercial truck that consumes 12.8L/100km, that's a 610km trip. NOT LOCAL
It's so simple - meat production causes a lot of emissions. If we'd eat less of it or not at all, we'd have better air, our kids would have something to breath.
You didnt account for all of the trucks and cars the Ships themselves generate once arriving at port. Never mind the loading machines emissions as well..  I bet that more than accounts for the 1 vehicle.
The cattle industry is aware of the land use  and cow poots contributing to the issue of climate change and adapting methods.  I believe there is research and testing going on to feed cattle algae based feed which reduces cow poots by a significant percentage? I could be wrong.
Being vegan doesn't stop global warming anyway, as I eat meat, it also not make global warming more severe.
I just want to elaborate on something to you guys, Plant based is different than veganism. If you want to in the future consume lab grown meat, you'll see all the omnies, carnies and plant based people lined up for it. But that is not how veganism works.
Answer: It's complicated, but yes. yes it is.
The only thing I enjoy doing is giving people ideas for their passions.  I don't have a subject/job/thing that I like doing. I like doing everything.  That's my passion.  To make your passions even better/cooler/more fun/whatever.  There is literally no job in the world for me that I'll like. :(
Proud to be Vegetarian 😌🤍🤞
i still eat meat
Ok what happened to the tumbnail
Beef is just really bad for you in general. It increases the risk of colon cancer and it’s also an inflammatory food, which means if you get painful periods, it’s going to hurt a lot more. I experienced this first hand.
Just eat less meat, buy less plastic
Some of the reptilian race which usually feed off of human blood and fear have now miraculously become vegitarian.   Crititcs who stuck to the original fleshy diet are now saying, "Is human flesh really that bad?"   More from carrots and tomatoes perspective in a moment.
Easy solution: Normalize cannibаlism
Waiting for Indians/ Hindus to comment.. “we said so..”
What my take in this is, this is basically saying us to stop consuming animal products and become vegans by "scientific proofs" I mean sure go ahead and stop eating meat if you think that'll bring a change, but not everything goes as on paper  Note: I'm not hating on veganism
Normal people don't hate meat
Only true fans remember the old thumbnail title was called “Meat Love”
And nothing is said about not all of us being able to live a vegan/vegetarian lifestyle? Really!?
The animal ag lobbies are getting annihilated! Bitter-sweet, but mostly sweet.
New world order propaganda bs
They only reason we dong have meat in my home is cause in my regipn meat is too expenssive, and is more affordable to buy chicken and dairys
I just learned about this in class,I really appreciate this channel,good stuff
Thank you. I need this kind of video to explain this problem
Iv been watching this for a long time and I still cant say " Kurzgesagt " ? How do you say it ? Google not helping lol Is it german ? Highvin Snivin Dos oticheiao fdjaefsojfdskjgalksjgldskjg d

I actually want to try the vegan-meat like food
I love how the thumbnail changed from “meat love” to “meat hate”
Thumbs up if you're a vegetarian!
Plants need CO2 to function, nuff said, big whoop wanna fight about it?
I like meat. Nothing like a juicy steak.
Damn I hate people who think they can save the planet by being dicks, we will fight over it, don't care if die, but will not submit.
Welp, meat is a very controversial topic, I like to eat meat because its tasty and such but I always never overdo with meat and also like to eat other non meat foods as well, to lame that veggies are exactly one of the things I don't like a lot.
But me love meat
Keep eating beef before it disappears!!!
Wait, last day thumbnail was meat love, now it's... Meat hate?
Isn't the actual problem releasing carbon from fossil fuels? Instead of being trapped underground, it can act as greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Keeping livestock of course will increase amount of methane, but as I understand it, it is rather constant - cows are basically circulating carbon, which was already in the equation.   In other words, if we stopped burning fossil fuels and keep livestock as it is, amount of greenhouse gases would stay the same, therefore it's hard to compare methane "released" by cows with carbon dioxide from coal plants.
Short answer: no  Long answer: noooooooooo
i remember the tumbnail was cow with lovey dovey eyes.. why the cow suddenly mad?
So queries answered
Thumbnail changed.
I love your videos but this one just makes it seem like you’re a vegan lover and hate people who don’t like me this is a dislike for me sorry

I cant express how much i love this project called kurzgesagt
Meat is a necessary food
O caminho é a agroecologia
"I'm here to have a tasty  time, not a healthy time!"
Answer: Yes.
What if we invented a pill for cows so they would stop producing methane?
Loved the video, but I would also love to hear about the fact that meat is more available and cheaper, than it's vegan counterparts. I would love to be more eco friendly with my food choices, but it's impossible with the money I've got
are universe is curvy
I'd say oil is worse than meat
This vid focused on calories alone, but what about other nutritional factors like protein, vitamins and so on? If Veg was so good, why is it that the narrative surrounding evolution only seems to revolve around humans gaining sentience after their ancestors started to eat meat?  tl;dr what do we lose on a multi generational scale by switching to an all vegan diet?
I just want mein Rindfliesch  Screw climate change
I like how he using animals shopping meat instead of human to make us feel guilty.
so personally, I prefer a balance. You gotta do what youngotta do, so I'll meat for the crap ton of nutrients, but also balance outvote diet
Whoever talks about any topic, I will refer to Kurtzgesagt's research and comments on the matter before forming an opinion. Gotta go vegan? Can keep eating meat? Let see what they have to say.
Wait... Does the thumbnail change???
Video doesn't touch on this, but in addition to the high emissions, beef uses insane amounts of water to produce. During the drought in CA a few years back, I couldn't convince myself to go full-vegan in one shot, so I cut my meat consumption back to only fish & fowl. But I'm very aware that one person giving up hamburgers doesn't do a lot, it's going to take a cultural shift.
terrible video. terrible propaganda. i bet by watching finish this video, i would have contributed to more waste than eating a week of sweet beefy lunch
What about farmed fish?
wtf bullshit about brazil!!! One less signer.
Cows eat a lot of the crop we can't eat. When we grow wheat we give them the stalks, when we grow almond we give them the shells. There's a lot of crops we grow that we only use a teeny tiny percentage of the final product, so the rest we give to cattle as to not waste it.
The best beef, as the video points out, produces 9Kg of CO2 per 100g of protein, while Tofu (the worst plant alternative) only 3.5. So the best beef produces a bit over double the Co2 than tofu. Is this beef a little over double more nutrient dense than Tofu? I imagine its much more than that, making this beef one of the best foods right? So the problem might not be beef, but the way weproduce it.
Either way, don't eat meat because it's really not very good for you at all and basically isn't helping things
Their were roughly the same amount of bison in na as beef cattle
This video lost credibility for me when it said the last mile transportation of meat costs so much more than mass shipping non-meat from overseas on ships... as if they don't need the last mile transportation as well from dock to store.
am i weird that i'm not a huge fan of the whole "food eating" experience i mean..it's okay...
Short answer: yes. Also it only tackles the environmental aspect, I think the strongest reason why people go vegan is because of animal suffering.
On this video you should have used real videos from farms...
Me after watching one kurzegast video: yes  these stupid people just don’t get it like me and you
this video has 8.4K dislikes so people know.
I can easily agree with those statements but I would gently ask @Kurzgesagt to check those infos about Amazonian forest and agriculture, in Brazil. You should ask Brazil Agriculture Ministry infos directly or last NASA's satellite anual  brazil burning area perceptual in Amazonia for real and more accurate information.
You lost me at climate change.
Major lacuna in the video is the impact of a vegan/vegetarian diet on an individual and society vs meat. People would be shorter and less strong on average without meat. Of course, the rich would still have access to meat and have an additional reason why they are the biggest, strongest, and healthiest. I am willing to admit that I am wrong on all of these aspects, however, a video like this does not address the real reasons people do things and certainly does not address some major impacts that altering the world diet would accomplish good or bad. IN SHORT: Title is misleading, should be is meat bad for the environment. Saying that if that was the title I enjoyed the video and think that they presented a brief but fascinating assessment of the current situation.
At the moment there is 8.3k dislikes so disabling dislikes definitely helped this piece of green national socialist propaganda to be not disliked as much as it should get. I can't comment about every number they mentioned here but methane stays in atmosphere for about 9 years and they said decades which is not even close to the reality so I assume most of this video is not true. What is also funny is that they mention that CO2 stays in atmosphere for centuries (which is also bs but its closer to the reality than the methane bs) and then have audacity to say that the methane is worse even though it makes less than 26% of all emissions (don't know percentage of the beef out of those 26%) and most of it will be gone in less than 10 years. Last thing to mention, you can't grow vegetables everywhere, anytime and for unlimited time, fields can be used for ~4 years and then need to be left laying for some time to regain the nutrition in the soil.
Pfft I never liked beef anyways
it doesnt matter too much  as soon enough humanity will have tech to transfer someones conciuosness into a machine which doesnt need food
imagine eating beef while watching this video
This video is biased, just look at the other videos. Run by vegans.
So I am eating meat or not? Just give me an answer.
Going vegan was the best thing I did for so many reasons, but preventing animals from being abused was the best reason. Hopefully more people see vegan as the best option!
So, beef is very bad, lamb is pretty bad, pork and chicken are better, so let's see if we have to keep eating beef or become vegans. How about reducing beef consumption? Or does the food industry not want to lose their most valuable product?
to all vegans out there don't breathe  you're emitting CO2
I read about this on BBC news a few years ago and haven't eaten beef for over 3 years now. I barely miss it, and I've now moved towards only having chicken 3 times a week. Definitely makes it easier to live with myself when I know I'm reducing so much of my personal impact and yet still maintaining a better diet than ever.
More steak for me! Yay!
How you graze land has a much larger impact and can actually be net positive in carbon emissions, this requires even more land but can net a bigger profit in the long run for the farmer.  This video is a typical way of taking the worst examples and comparing them and generalizing and call it the final answer.  The worst things are as mentioned in the video those that require burning forests that have stored tons of carbon and the amount they could have continued to capture, on top of what the actual production will emit.  Either way, the only solution is to remove existing carbon, we are way past the deadline of carbon neutral fixing anything.
What if 75% people die
Thank you thank you thank you! Finally a mainstream channel deconstructing all the myths! I hope people will understand now why we fight to solve this and bring plant based foods to improve all of our lives and help avoid climate catastrophe
"Beef stonks"... haha 😂
The simple answer is no.
No
So let me get this straight. You have uploaded 2 meat related video essays in the last year, both of which support meat consumption, and now you change your thumbnail of your last one in order to trick to algorithm and engage more viewers?
When you want to say be vegetarian but u can't say because it will get u cancelled
Claim your saw the original thumbnail ticket here
so much beef between climate saviours and meat eaters
I saw what you did with that thumbnail.... it made me sad....
How many of these cows are "sacred" and you'd start a war trying to kill? Also, are we just making cows go extinct, then?  Hey, they're killing us, right? Only fair we'll keep a handful caged in zoos for the ultra rich to enjoy steaks still 😂 Oh, you should do a video on carbon footprints of normals vs. Ultra rich 🤔
I guess how the hell a highly organized life even could evolve if tens if not hundreds of millions of years there was a lot of plants on Earth (like malicious potato!) emitting fiercely carbon dioxide and other (for sure) poisonous gazes? And now -- they definitely are going to kill the planet! Let's save it and kill ourselves first. Until too late! Right?
I thought the title said meat love NOT MEAT HATE
just stop eating beef and eat chimken breaaast
I swear Germans have fascist tendencies built into their dna. They're always pushing for fascist tendencies in some subtle or non-subtle way. That's what happens when science gets politicized though I suppose.
who saw a t-cell on a plate
It is true that freight ships have a smaller CO2-eq. than for example trucks, but a Life Cycle Assesement does not account for toxicity.  I don't think this should be let out of the equation since there are substances not only harming the atmosphere but the water.
5:55 Little correction : Actually, the most of methan's not produced by cattle's farts but by their burps. In fact, the fermentation occures because of the interaction between the four compartments stomachs presents in rumiant's digestive system ! 😉
If i ever become vegan, it will be because i hate plants    But jokes aside, if i acctually become vegan it will be because i want to loose weight/some medical reason
Hey Kurz, I was wondering, what would life be like on a frictionless planet, would we make it to this day and age, and what would everyday life look like? I know it’s not possible but still.
Funny enough my buddy tried a vegan burger just to try it and it gave him food poisoning
LIES, BRAZIL DID NOTHING WRONG
beef stonks pmsl
Put the cows on a Green house and use the traped gas to Cook food. Stonks
Would like to point out the fact that 800 billion tons of CO2 in 100 years. And we produce 50 billion tons of CO2 A YEAR. Meaning in 100 years 5 000 tons of CO2 would be there with this possible forest that noone would want to fund would remove just a part of it.Indeed a decently sized part , but still not the same as the huge diffrence it would make in the video.
Have I been saying "methane" wrong this whole time?
Go vegan! 🥳
Reducing the amount of humans in the planet who use resources and create emissions would be the most effective solution.
Funny how diffrent those Videos are branded in german and english. The Content is the Same, but the thumbnails are polar opposites. The Video thumbnail in german is "meat love"
Why don't you apply the environmental impact algorithm to electric cars? Are we not talking about environmental/humanitarian costs of batteries?
Problem here is that vegan isn’t shown to be sustainable. Climate change doesn’t matter much if the society is unhealthy.
Wouldn’t eating meat be the worst for the animal being eaten? If we wouldn’t eat a dog, why would we eat a cow, pig or chicken? Don’t they all have the capacity to suffer?
Its not the meat, is the way we produce it, the INHUMANE way we produce it.
I like how you didn't mention how methane doesn't stay in the atmosphere as long as carbon dioxide lol. I felt there was alot of skewing the information here
6:24 As a Brazilian i feel so bad for the last couple of years 😔
Why is there a cell on the table at 9:45
5:30  The methane argument is redundant.  How many animals would be alive if humans never existed that would be producing Methane?   Cows bulls bison etc were all existing and ABUNDANT in the world before humans.
why so much spam from this video
I love meat but I hope plant-based/lab-grown meat becomes cheaper and more accessible
Can we get a video on the potential of 'printed' meat and vertical farming?
Um he changed the thumb nail the first one is a cow being an angel and this one is a devil
Watching this video made me want  to eat steak
Can i suggest next video's idea? What if the whole world, 7 billion people just turns into vegan. How huge the crops field we needed to supply our daily need of meals.
I wonder if this video is going to consider the maas killing of animals for agriculture, and the run-offs of them on the environment.
Yes
This is misleading. Not all meat is produced in the same way. Grass fed free range beef is pretty much the only meat that has a neutral impact on the carbon cycle. Unfortunately the vast majority of beef isn't grass fed. I don't eat lamb, pork or beef but if I did it would be only grass fed beef. I only eat things I would be prepared to kill myself. I've killed chickens, game and fish so I eat those things very very rarely. I'm not willing to kill anything else so why should I expect someone else to do it for me?
Dear vegetarians. I killed a cow because it was eating your food
Who knows if this got ratio'd or not?
Having been a vegan as a teenager and suffering irreversible damage to my stomach acid, digestion, as well as becoming suicidal, I can tell you that meat is critical for health. Without meat, I literally tried to kill myself because my brain was not functioning. With meat, my mental health returned, memory returned but my digestion has never been the same since. To any vegetarians still pushing this bullshit, stop.
…most of the grains and crop that animals eat are not good enough quality for human consumption. Rotational grazing, soil conservation etc. use animals to restore the co2 in the land and later grow food in it in cycles. The industry has significantly lowered its emissions rates in the past 20 years and is coming up with more environmentally friendly ways constantly. Like the recent research on adding seaweed to cows diet to lower the methane they produce. Blaming individuals and one group of animals is not a good look and overall this video was full of lazy research.
lol
im not even gonna watch this video, almost every animal eats meat. nature literally designed it that way. im just waiting for the day they prove plants are sentient. then im gonna grab some popcorn and watch the vegans have an existential crisis lol
Carbon footprint is a scam.
I don't understand why people take objective facts presented here and keep trying to make subjective claims of value about this. "Eating meat is bad." That's an opinion. "The process of rearing animals that will be processed for consumption, and the distribution of that animal product produce a lot of CO2 emissions compared to plant-based products" is an objective statement.   "You shouldn't eat meat," is not the way to convince someone to make a change because it's just your opinion. If you instead say "you should try to limit how much meat you consume or consider a protein that contributes less to the climate change, because climate change is making our current way of life unsustainable," I imagine you'd have a more productive conversation.  Just ending with a personal question that was left unanswered by this video, how does lab grown beef stack up against other meat or vegetable options? Is it a viable strategy to replace cattle ranches without forcing large scale changes to the typical American diet and still have an effect on reducing climate emissions?
Thank you!
For anyone who wants to go meatless: I just made the jump, almost that is (I do still enjoy the occasional Salami-Pizza for now, but I plan to cut that out too in the future). I tried that already, going vegetarian, and back in the day there was nowhere near the amount of fake meat products etc. really delicious ones too, and available in pretty much any store that sells food. So if it helps anyone, know that going vegetarian now is way tastier than say 20 years ago...
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive , no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed as much" I can think of something else......
Beef stonks at 8:16 is unironically the best Kurzgesagt moment ever
We all must die.
Damnit.  I really love cow.
Why did i read the thumbnail as “methane”?
So if we enforced a vegan world order we would only need to solve for 42 billion tons of CO2 equivalent per year. We should probably not enforce a vegan world order then because the cost benefits ratio doesn't work.  Maybe people could be 50% vegetarian instead.
The video is very misleading. Cows and such are great bioreactors we use to extract nutrients from foods we can't digest ourselves. Compare digestive tract of cow and human and go figure..
did yall just change the thumbnail and title?
This will be interesting if we can see dislikes to likes ratio, YouTube really know how to make bad decision.
Just give up beef and lamb for now.
Beautiful video as always, but I have to disagree with the way it was presented. Based on your information, It's the WAY companies handle the beef industry as a whole and how it's arbitrarily categorized and scored in the life cycle assessment. Saying that "Beef emits 71kg of CO2" places the blame on individual consumers who have limited impact, rather than companies who directly affect the life cycle assessment the argument is based on. Saying "Beef PRODUCTION emits 71kg of CO2" more accurately portrays the information used. Otherwise, love the videos, keep up the good work.
It's a shame they didn't mention that cows are also bred for meat which has many impacts on its own. A plant based diet will always trump a meat based diet when it comes to emissions.
I can't live without dairy but I like turkey burgers
I swear the thumbnail was meat love not meat hate
Sounds like making these vids is hard
Gonna eat more meat so there would be less cow to release methane.
What about locally produced plants?
So it seems that meat is pretty bad overall and that doesn't even cover the emotional aspect of that problem.
JOHN 3:16 FOR GOD SO LOVE THE WORLD, THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, THAT WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH IN HIM SHALL NOT PERISH, BUT HAVE EVERLASTING LIFE
at 9:46 theres a virus on the table
1 Timothy 4:4 Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; 2 Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; 3 Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
"The reality is, well, its complicated. " Goes on to describe uncomplicated reality of meat being bad
lets blame the cows for the results overpopulation ! :P  we need a good genocide. asap   im voting for india ! :P nothing personal, just the numbers
no
climate change is another commie bullshit, same as vegans, since 1950 this trend comes up and down, we r in the new hype now, but it will slowly going down, same as pandemic n all the cycles in human society
I live in Turkey, everything is incredibly expensive here. I don't care, eating meat is bad, it's good. I will not care for the rest of my life.Those who live in Europe and America should care.
Did they change the thumbnail from meat love to meat hate ? xD
Judging from Your past videos this will be apologia and what about isms.
Why change the thumbnail though?
INDIA is the answer...
Time to eat bugs
what about lab grown meat?
So that;s why the NWO wants to wipe out so many people.
I'm still going to eat meat. In fact I will proudly raise my own herd on my own land.
If you care about animals and want to be morally consistent then are responsible to yourself to stop eating animals and their products. Please!
The issue with the debate between vegan or not vegan is that it totally omits the responsabilities of company behind it. Companies will usually hide behind personal's choice, supply and demands and so on, without taking into account that they themselves go and tell marketing lies like the grassland one you just point out. If we want to lower meef production, it's useless in my opinion to go door to door and trying to convert everyone into a vegan, bc the meat industry will still go right behind you, make the guilt all better with some marketing and will still try to sell you the meat they already produce and if not, they will throw it away, which will cause high emissions. The quickest, more reasonable and healthy solution is just stopping those companies first, then changing public opinions second.
MEAT LOVE OR MEAT HATE choose one.
In general, you can just eat however you want, but bear in mind that whatever you eat has quite a significant impact on co2 emmisions, so try to have a balanced diet instead of going full meat or full vegan. Everyone is free to do what they want with their food so no one should complain about that, so vegans dont try and force us to be vegan, and meat lovers, let's not force other to try and have a meat-based diet like us. Respect is the main core of society and we must respect others opinions.  That's my opinion in relation to the video. Great video, by the way!
White people who is eating beef and bullying others who eat other meats.
This is by far one of the best 'Informative' channels out there! They put in a lot of hard work, time and research and it's greatly appreciated 👍✌️
All packaging should have a "Harvested Date" including meat, expressing when the animal was killed, or plant plucked. We need be smarter than savages.
one things is certain dont eat donkeys they arent worth eating and they are your friend
I can tell you about 1 Company just  1 !! That produces more Methane and other pollutants in a Hour than Livestock produces in a Decade !
alternate title: shitting on beef for 12:07
Yeah just wipe out all the meat, reduce CO2 right? Why wait then, just make mass extinct and regret later
I LOVE MEAT, THAT'S IT!
e
I think the video fails at two important points:  1, Nutrient density, where it only mentions proteins and calories. No talk about other key nutrients that are found in meat in abundance, but at the same time lack from vegetables, or are very difficult to get  - iron being one of them. Iron can be found in many plants but it's very rare that it is found in a digestable form - for example because the same iron-rich plants contain materials that prohibit the integration of iron into the body. 2, Transportation - avocados also need to be delivered by truck both before and after they get on the ship. The comparison of local meat transportation producing less emissions then shipping avocado from South America stands on a very shaky ground.
i just dont buy much meat (and when i do its like a chicken role when i dont have time/the want to make real meals) becasue i prefer cooking other things so im fine with beef disapearing or atleast the ones that arent being used in dairy production i dont think i cant give up that and its ingredients  bowls of cereal, porride,  cooking and baking, ice-cream etc
What? A 1 mile delivery of beef is 18kg??? Sus
Whatever , this video is stupid, people are not going to stop eating meat because of the environment. These stupid videos are always on some climate change nonsense. Stop being so freaking preachy.
sex, sex is as good as food
OK understandable, now to order a hamburger.
I don't like the comparison at 9:32 it would have been better to compare CO2 emitted over 100 years based on the average.
I love me some meat 🍖🍖🍖🍖 yummy
What if I start eating human meat, would that be helpful for conservation efforts? Asking for a friend…
The thumbnail is creeping 0_0
Thank you so much for that video! It provides a really clear picture of food impact on the environment.
Dislike
Delicious
pretty pathetic to lay blame on brazil for global warming, specially when you see a video called NASA | A Year in the Life of Earth's CO2 that shows the true story. the fault lies with the northern hemisphere. you 𝐟𝐮𝐜𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 pricks with an agenda.
Could be using carbon tax to subsidize the production and distribution of healthy vegan products is an alternative to meat. Being a driver towards a better diet and freeing up the landspace necessary for reforestation.
Here is a thought, convert all the toxic poisonous not fit for human consumption or animal consumption corn wheat and soy crop lands into grass lands and have the process food stocks crash as they should...
Did the title just change?
I like how they explained why people are hesitant to give up their meat eating. It was very even handed and empathetic.
Indeed beef is just a biproduct of dairy.
Fun fact the carbon you release from the soil to make room for beef, can be restored and then some through regenerative agriculture, which can only function if you have properly manages ruminants on pasture where you cleared a forest... its a good thing.
That comparison between the Co2 emissions of Poultry and Beef makes me feel that much better that i've almost for an entire year now been eating 95% chicken meats, the type of "real" meat that causes them the least. But what about fish? How much emissions does a trout cause?
If we say that cow and chicken lives are equally valuable, then a beef has a smaller "death toll" than a KFC bucket, because you have more meat per animal. Which is frustrating because chicken is the meat with the smallest footprint.
Methane produced from ruminant animals has not changed  for hundreds of years, there are less ruminants in North America today then there were in the 100 years ago (think ten of millions of bison). Regardless the methane they produce is already accounted for in the carbon cycle, it is not "new carbon" like fossil fuels... This is not "new" emissions , you should rather look at new sources, troubleshoot, what has actually changed... perhaps energy and transportation in the last 100 years?
Please make a video on hyperloop
I know people will forge arguments to prove themselves right, but please. At least limit meat consumption if you have other equally nutritional and eco friendly options available.
wait a minute I dont recall the thumbnail look that evil.
One wrinkle here. You touched on fertilizer briefly, but isn't the majority of our fertilizer from cows? As I understand it, potash fertilizer production has increased, but that relies on mining and isn't renewable.  Can synthetic fertilizers pick up the slack if we drastically reduced beef consumption?
perhaps its time to try a veggie burger. is it tastes very similair then i think ill be okay lol
Perfect, my favourite meats are poultry and swine. When clicking this video I was afraid you would frame this as "Meat bad, look cow" like the loud minority of vegans and vegetarians, ecstatic to see that wasn't the case. Thank you.  However, when you're talking about freight ships. Sure, the shipping doesnt pollute that much, but you seem to have forgotten that the food that is shipped in on containers, also have to be transported from the shipyard and to the shops, so whatever it pollutes with shipping, is in addition to, and not instead of. And it is not transported local to the shipyards either, it is shipped all over the country, by the same type of car/trailer that drives the food from the local farm, to the local shop. And inbetween it is cold-stored.  Or am I wrong?
Haha they changed the thumbnail to make it more provocative
Let's just switch to Kangaroos, Australians can't get rid of them fast enough.
What if instead of reducing meat, we reduce mouths that eat them? Like, make a huge global birth control... So. We reduce the amount of people, therefore, reducing what we emanate.
It's not complicated everyone has cognitive dissonance these days
You guys have regained my respect with this video. I really appreciate you guys hopping off of the fence that you were on with the dairy video and taking a stronger stance on animal agricultural issues. Having you guys hammer home some key points us vegans have been screaming about for years is a massive help 🖤 🌱
The wallpaper at first was showing a cow which was in love, now the wallpaper is a cow filled with hate.
Well I see most of the beef eaters commenting thank you for the video, but how many will stop consuming and make a change 😂
I'm not eating bugs and I'm not eating soymeat.
my keto diet loooooves meat.
Haha that Thumbnail change.
Seeing the chicken on the table and another looking in the telescope made me laugh 😂😂, so they eat each other as a species
I'm getting a "We weren't able to add your reply. Try again." error when trying to reply to the majority of comments on this video.
why did you guys change the thumbnail?
Hopefully you're not the next target of the Vagen Teacher
Lucky that I am a Hinduism, so I avoid eating beef and other four-legged animals at all 😊 But yes, I still eat chicken.
If you think further away the problem is overpopulation. A single person or a couple that decides not to have children will be more helpful to the environment than a double standard vegan family of 4.
finally clicked on the the videos cus i like 2 videos??? now i have to see.
while still not viable, I'm curious about how lab-grown meat will impact the market, the environment and the planet in the future, I wish you would have commented on that
Why did you change the title and thumbnail? Suspicious...
The image used to be happy cow. I miss it already.
please no insect future
Tell me how to set on fire RAIN florest???
So if I understood correctly; We are being farted to death by cows?
Thank you for the information, now let me continue eating my beef Tenderloin Steak.
Yes it is
Who paid this content's price Kurzgesagt? Left's lies again everywhere.
The art of animation really caught my attention
Climate change is a massive agenda driven lie pushed by some very foul elites. They literally want to destroy our quality of life and prosperity  so only they can sit and eat meat as everyone else eats bugs. Oppose the climart alarmist useful idiots if you want a future.
I come here because the blown up "hqppy meat farm" reccomendation
Yea meat is bad. Can’t stop eating it though. Like 90% of vegan food is terrible, and meals with no real protein dont feel satisfying. Plus when I’m only eating vegetables (or vegetable-based products) for a while, I feel cranky and groggy, while still hungry, much like a starving North Korean child, despite having a full stomach. Anyway, I’m sure it suits plenty of people, and if you can do it, power to you. But no need to rip on those who can’t, or even those who chose not to for obvious reasons.
Ok but I like borger
Gotta interrupt you right there, cows in america are fed with 80% non human edible food. We grow the crops, lets take corn, the humans get the corn but 90% of a cornplant is unuseable green not fit for human consumption, that fore example goes into cow food. Also USA cow caused Methane emissions are only 2%  of the total CO2 equvi. Emissions and emissions from beef in particular only take up 4%. It's still a lot and has to be lowerd but maybe think about using a bike instead of a car for trips <5km  before you cut out beef. Also the amount of emissions doesn't rise as long as the number of cows stay the same, because methane is turned into CO2 and water wich is tuned into plantfiber which is then turned into methane by the cow. And at least for USA the number of cows didn't change in the past years.
Stonks
I was expecting the effects of meat on humans
Just wish that like 40% of the people who said this is a great video became less meat-eater in any way that is possible for them
This is stupid, so your saying most of the co2 is coming from the clearing of the land for the cattle.  People have been clearing land forever for various reasons, they didnt need cattle to do it lmfao.  What a stupid argument.
I swear I just saw a Kurskasagt video that says meat love, but I can only find meat hate.
I didn't like beef anyway, so...
Yes, thanks for sharing the facts without attaching morality.
I like in a nutshell becoz they are very fair and see many sides of the story...
Taking the percentage of beef and comparing emission with avacados is so  biased. Shit dude, at least make an effort to not skew the data.
food 🤗
Very important and informative video, especially for us Brazilians. Even though many of the Bolsonaro lovers would call you communist liars, as their lack of intelligence and capacity of thinking.
The video is interesting but there's plenty more stuff that is not even mentioned: food waste is the first and probably most important, IMO. Some estimates indicate that food waste is around 60%, addressing production without addressing this first doesn't seem the smartest approach to me. Also, there's some interesting statistics on the percentage of food waste by kind, and unsurprisingly the less expensive ones (vegetables) are the most wasted. Wasted food ferments, which itself produces methane and CO2.  There's also the aspect of crop rotation or lack thereof, soil impoverishment, yield, loss of biodiversity, etc etc. This video while good literally just scratched the surface and would deserve a much more in depth follow up
You can always not care and just keep eating, the sheer amount of demand for meat will pressure scientists towards the undeniable true perfect solution: "Meat without problems", adapting our behaviour to the environment is not the hallmark of humanity, is quite the contrary.
I stopped eating all meat exept for fish around 6 months ago. I also stopped dairy. I did this mainly for animal welfare but the carbon footprint is also a nice thing. I LOVED meat so it was very hard, and i really do miss it from time to time. A few things i've noticed are that some vegan meats (especially mince) are so damn close to the meat that its basically like nothing changed. The main goal i see is lab grown meat. as soon as that is avaliable i think everything will change.
Where's fish?
This is one of the best channels on YouTube, we’re very grateful for you :)
Not worth discussing the fact that none of these animals want to die? It's cruel to kill and eat or use animals in a world there is a plant based alternative for anything and everything. Make a video on veganism.
I eat a pound of meat everyday, keep buying into this crap
thumbnail change huh XD
Thumbnail changed
Global exportation of foods isn’t less pollutant than local sourcing. You still require to transport it by land once it has reached the port.
I hold anti-meat people in contempt. Meat is the part of meal that always gave me both best taste as by far most good-feels and energy through the day. You can stick every single one anti-meat argument You can conceive up You - You know what.
So what I gather from that is that buying the cheapest meat is also the best for the environment, as these meats are produced with full regard to growth efficiancy, and shorter lives of the animals also means less CO2 per weight for meat. Its not really new to me that animal welfare does not go hand in hand with environmental impact but is opposed, but I really wonder how some people handle that - as most of the people who care for animals - at least those who I know- also seem to care for environmental issues more than the average person...
I remember this video being different
I won't eat meat so the 1% Elite can Fly their Private Jets
Its not that bad. And no-meats has to stop saying it is.
I've recently had to dive into this subject for work, thus I was already familiar with what the results would be. I was hoping you'd bring more light on the effects of dairy instead of just meat. I think overall, that is a subject that has been explained less in popular science than meat. I recently read the paper from Poore and Nemecek (2018) that you've been referencing, but I had trouble understanding some of the specifics on dairy. I always love your video's especially also the recent one 'can YOU fix climate change?' and I would love to see your analysis of how much worse dairy actually i than the non-dairy alternatives.   Nevertheless. The video was great. And I keep on loving your channel. You guys are one of the main reasons for me wanting to go into the field of science communication. (for a long time, my secret dream being working for the team of kurzgesagt <3)
The world is becoming the movie Demolition Man.
The real problem is overpopulation
Was the thumbnail and/or title changed or did i saw a different video with the same format days ago?
Every vegan's spidey senses went off upon this video's upload.
I could agree on that "the more animals suffer, the better they are in terms of climate change because they are way more  efficient". But is this really good for our health? Animals do not eat their original food (e.g. grass) anymore. Crops replaces their original food. Funny parallel, humans do the same. We originally ate unprocessed foods like nuts, vegetables, fruit, meats. Our original foods are replaced with processed foods which contain sugar, flour, oil (with low macro-nutrients and fiber). See what happens... diabetes, lung diseases, neurological disorders have skyrocketed in the last 50 years.  Animals also suffer from this radical diet change. So we give them antibiotics to survive then we eat them. I think this approach does not support our health in any meaningful way!
You should make a video on the human health perspective. Check out Drs John McDougall (The Starch Solution), Michael Gregor (How Not To Die), Neal Barnard, Caldwell Esselstyn, T. Colin Campbell (The China Study), and also the documentaries The Game Changers and Forks Over Knives. 👌🏼

Yeah, I'm going to focus less on meat until there are viable solutions like "impossible" meat that are comparative cost-wise. The other 70% of those carbon emissions are mostly industries dumping pollution into the air. I'd rather that be addressed first.
If the world went meat free and all that land was freed up would there be enough edible plants to go around to feed everyone? It's just their nutritional value is so low, so I wonder. If we'd end up planting more than what we make already, even with all the extra plants coming to us instead of the livestock.
>80% of Amazon deforestation is either used for animal herding or for food for the animals. Nuff said
Already Vegan, BTW.
Yes, the way we eat it is problematic at the very least.
i absolutely love you guys.... the amount of knowledge i receive from this channel... 15 years of schooling could not teach me.... i really miss your space videos though i'd love to see more of those... love from India
That pronunciation of tofu hits differently 8:48
I think the real issue is that there's too many heterotrophs on Earth, human or otherwise. Too many to feed, too much waste coming out, the world was ruined a long time ago. We're going to have to not only emphasise contraceptives, but actually actively work to reduce the current population.
The answer is no. The way meat is mass produced is the bad thing. But there isn't really any other way of doing it. If we all became vegans, the water needed to produce the amount of food would be astronomical. So either way it is bad. The problem really is there is too many people.
4:20, I think it's very important to mention the kind of emissions that container ships produce/emit. Nitric and sulfur oxides, caused by the heavy oil that is used to power those ships.
Oh well, I'm still gonna keep eating meat.
Thumnail should show a happy cow, because meat hate means cows not dying
a
Counterpoint: Beef is delicious
It's NOT US, ordinary ppl who are emitting that much eating meat 1x-2x a WEEK! Go f...k McDonalds and shit like that!
Quite contrary, food is one of the worst things of being alive for me. But I admit I may have an eating disorder.
Either you are brainwashed or you woke up.The fact there is no need to elaborate is enough for the capable mind to discern the argument ran by cognitive dissonance
The thumbnail changed from *Meat love*       To *Meat hate*
Why did the tumbnail chance?
Aninals are not commodities 🙏❤️
no other  bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old... I beg to differ but yes there is!
I dont understand how can "good" beef be both the best when it comes to C02 and also the worst as the video claimed in the second half
Even though I acknowledge this impending doom, I can not resist a nice burger, vegan burgers aren't bad, but they just taste different.
Yh
Since when did the thumbnail turn from a good ol cow to your worst nightmare cow?
I see, they do not have the will to create Solutions, they have the will to create new bigger problems. Wonderful
Didn't this video just the other day have a different thumbnail?
And lab grown meat is first of all unnatural and second very harmful and unhealthy.. they couldn’t even treat normal animals right, now they want to mass produce meat in a lab.. like they did carona? No.. it has a crap ton of gmo’s in it. Don’t fall for marketing scams. Just because they advertise to you as vegan or meatless, doesn’t mean it’s automatically good for you.
Thank you for this video!
Kuzgesagt chose the perfect time to release this video now that the dislike count is gone.
For anyone wondering: this video has 8.1K dislikes at 14:15 (03/12/2021) - VERY WELL RECEIVED
No, a animal is supposed to be able to Roam free and Graze on grass before it’s taken to be consumed by a human. Humans get sick from tainted meat that’s injected with hormones and was fed corn slop that’s not even the animals natural diet. I understand not eating me for that reason but anything else is absurd. It’s a part of a healthy functional diet to help your body thrive.
the like-dislike ratio would have been a great war between the vegans and non-vegans
I swear the thumbnail said “Meat Love” yesterday
Just make any controversial topic video. Have an unpopular opening. How does it matter now? The dislike button is gone
Ould you guys make a shirt that says “beef stonks” with the arrow crashing 70%
Around timestamp 9:30, this information is somewhat misleading. (Or I do not understand it entirely?) 800 billlion tonnes of CO2 could be removed in ''100 years'' BY COMPARISON we emit 50 billion tonnes ''per year''. So we would emit 5000 tonnes in 100 years if we were to maintain our current emissions. So how does this compare? Yes removing CO2 is essential, but it seems misleading to me to compare yearly emissions to CO2 removed in 100 years. Would like to hear your thoughts or hear what I didn't quite understand.
Punish China and the US to stop climate change instead of blaming the little man
discussed almost nothing new in this video, neat.
First Meat love and then meat hate?
Literally impossible for cows to produce more carbon than the exists in the food that they eat smh. Plus the whole video is crud because he doesn't make the distinction between carbon that already exists in the carbon cycle, and the carbon that we extract from fossil fuels which for all purposes was not participating in the environment until we humans added it.   I noticed that this entire series of arguments against beef in particular has a really strong "get in the pod and eat the bugs" "you will own nothing and you will be happy" vibe. Seriously you don't have to a vegan to recognize that factory farming is one of the worst and most inhumane things a human can do to another animal. So we have to eat food that is grown or factory farmed in another country by soylent green Inc. because it is """"better"""""" for global warming than local ethically raised/grown options? Where is the carbon impact of the fashion industry? Where is the impact of Amazon driving a massive fleet of fuel guzzling delivery vehicles to deliver right to your door the plastic crud that you don't need?   Unlike ethical and environmentally conscious food production which can hypothetically go to zero fossil fuel use and thus add zero new carbon to the planet; almost all of our fashion and tech products and shoes are made from plastics and compounds that are adding carbon or even worse chemicals to our planet that didn't exist before we added them!   Where's the video against Apple making a new IPhone 97 billion every year? Where is the video against planned obsolescence in tech like Microsoft's windows 11 TPM requirement that makes half the PC's in the world incapable of running the new OS and thus despite being perfectly functional will end up being thrown to the dump in the billions over the next few years? Where's the video against the fashion industry who's entire business model is coming up with a new "in" fashion every 3 bloody months that necessitates a total wardrobe overhaul lest you be seen as "poor" or "lacking taste"?   This video is garbage and I wish I could see the dislike button to see how badly it was received 😕
for past 6 months i have switched to only 600g of meat per week and 90% of it is chicken and 10% pork excluding beef in 100% if all people would do that we would not need that video
Well, I dont eat food daily for the pleasure of it. If I stop eating I die.
I only click on this video to ask why did you thumb nail?
this sounds like an uncle trying to calm everyone down during thanksgiving after people start fighting about the turkey not being vegan
Emissions are barely making a difference on climate change, the atmosphere and ocean are controlled by the sun if you are scared of cow farts you need to learn about the sun its affects on the weakening geomagnetic
0:02 Me who sees chickens eat chicken  Wait, that's ilegal
Seems like replacing beef with pork would be a nice solution. Hopefully there are no people who don't eat pork because an old fairy-tale told so :D
The titlecard has changed
It's a shame people still use the meaningless term climate change. How vague can you get? Most people know diddly-squat about how common glacial maximums are.
It would be interesting to see how many dislikes this topic gets 🥲😅
Yo Americans stop eating beef dafuq
The biggest problem is that these environmentally friendly foods are way more expensive than any other option.
No press, politician, scientists, vegan fanatics or animal loving degenerates will never ever change my mind about meat it is one of the most delicious foods on my table. I suggest you all being against meat to eat maggots, sue me.
I think it’s dumb that when you talk about  the meat industry the animals that are shown seems to be happy and is on grass it’s just a lie that you still are telling   Good video nonetheless
you mean the vegan teacher was right all along ? O.o
Veg people united 😂 like me
The thumbnail change was so drastic lol. From happy cow to satan
yeah cow farts gonna end the world what a tragedy
You change title from meat love to meat hate
Likes: 231K Dislikes: 8.1K On this video, at this time.
I neither liked nor disliked it and am strongly pro-beef. Mostly because I feel there is a concerted push to go back to the middle ages where the ruling elite had a radically different diet than we poor plebs. Rather than being mandated by wealth it was mandated by law. It is part of that whole "I will not eat the bugs, I will not live in a pod" thing.
Why does a beef truck delivering to my local store pump out more Co2 then a truck with an avocado, that was trucked from the coast?
That part about grass fed and feed crop is utter bs they get fed mostly crop cuttings
sadly its kinda hard to be meat less in 3rd world country
Why you changed the the picture of the video?
If there was more studies on how to improve texture and flavour. Then some mkting around it rather than meatshaming, would help.
One of the biggest reasons I'm pescatarian
I really don't think stopping meat consumption would be good for the evolutionary trajectory of the human race.  I see it as being more detrimental long term than even climate change, given how much more cooked meats affected us more than the end of the last ice age in terms of population and collective intelligence.
it feels like right now we should take carbon cost as currency
Dude the thumbnail goes from love meat to hate meat real quick
How about we make methane spray to support fires?
Yeah. Cows eat grass and convert it to CO2 and Methane... but... if cows didn't eat grass? The grass would die naturally and emit the same amount of CO2 and Methane as it decomposes. Am I wrong?
i thought something is not right about the soy beans 80% is a lot for the cows. This is actualy true if you look at the kg used of the product.  If you look at the source listed and kurzgesagt has the graph in his nice sources link (thanks for listing this document a good improvent of past vids) it has 7% dedicated to feed i found that weird but the research of this paper are from the WUR so i would think it is decently correct 87% is getting proces this means being used to get the oil out of the soy beans. this oil that is about 20% of the beans is than used for cooking and industry.  The problem with soy beans in general is that it is mutally ballanced money crop. becouse it is cheap to get the oil out there is a lot of demand for it. then you have the soya meal that is also making money on it by being decently high dense protain plant that humans can't eat becouse the oil is out of the plant.
finally a mainstream channel that explain that not exploiting all land is not a waste and that this idea that beef mostly use non arable land is a marketing stunt..  we vegans have been saying that for 40 years and we had to wait decades for the scientific community to catch up.. Now we just need to wait a few decades more to start being told we're right and a few more again before we can finally see some changes..
Everyone should get Corona to not taste anything, we would only eat out of necessity and survival. This would also mean that we would eat food with more nutrients and vitamins, even if we can't taste it
I always believed innovation and strive for progress will be far more efficient than regulations.
In reality the only reason people 'hate' is because they were brainwashed to by politicians.
Meat yum
Kurzgesagt: No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old  Me: I don’t know about that
That is why I have been eating mostly pork and chicken meat for 20ish years.
Great video! Would it reach more people with the meat love thumbnail ? Because of cognitive dissonance
His videos:  1) Milk is a slow poison 2) Meat is not bad Legend.
weird, i remembered the thumbnail title as "meat love". did they change it or am i seeing things?🤨
How about a video on what would happen if half of earths population would vanish. A lot of problems on Earth seem to be stemming from the overload of people, what if we *snap* and half of humans are gone?
If I wanna heat 1g of protein per lbs of bodyweight, how in the hell do you do it without animal product? Fuck that.  I'm never cutting down on meat. You're afraid you're gonna die of climate change? Cool, you figure out the science to make lab-grown meat and lab-grown dairy products. I'm not doing shit, because I'm not the scared one.

Yes it is.
Sounds like, Future goes plantbased If you like it or not. But that would mean more ships on the oceans. A Point you didn't mentioned and worth a debate. And as Long as everything in this universe ist conected with each other, videos like this teach us partially wrong. There ist so much more to say to this matter. First time i'm disapointed in one of your videos
the one big thing you didnt think of and or state crops destroy the soil you plant them in it will turn barren extremely quick and the only way too do that is by fertilizing but wouldn't you know the best fertilizers are poop.....also one thing too take into account we can only use a small amount of a plant yet cows use it all, shes a slippery slope cattle is essential by far its the most important human product hands down.......almost guaranteed  that every vegan isn't vegan because the crops they eat are grown in cow poop, because 'organic'
Great video! I hope this educates some people that are still relying on these old animal agriculture habits that are full of problems and suffering.  Only things I would have liked to see in this video is that we have 7 billion humans on earth and still have people dying of starvation all around the world, yet can feed 11 billion farm animals every day just for animal products and that of all these planets that we know of, we only have life on this one, yet kill millions every day for sensory pleasure.
go vegan
Meh, illl still eat lots of meat
I like meat
This is why we need those damn replicators from star trek
Thats all nice, but we as humans are omnivores. We need both meat and veggies to be healthy. The problem isn't the supply, it's the demand. There are simply too many people on the planet. The current pandamic is one of the many events that drop the weak and build the strong. However... modern medicine is activly avoiding this natural selective process. people don't die as much anymore. Which on an individual level sounds amazing, but the entire planet is suffering because of this. Im NOT saying mass murder is a solution or Thanos was right. But at a certain point you have to wonder: Who is the real virus here? Corona or Humanity.
the only bad are the vegetarians
lmao imagine aliens finding out that humanity was wiped out due to cow farts
It doesn’t matter how much we complain about this topic. The rich bastards control everything and won’t change things easily.
Quite an interesting video as always Kurtz. Hey you know it makes me think a little about this thing called Pleistocene Park that Atlas Pro did a video on. Cattle played a big role in stampeding this grassland in ancient times, which has turned into permafrost (which unfortunately Tony Beets is digging up.) Perhaps it might make for an interesting video to talk a little about cattle's role in carbon capture considering your equations in this video here (there was also a Ted Talk by Allan Savory talking about elephant's role in desertification.)
So this combined with everything else recent videos I have looked at from these guys and modern media that isnt owned by industry... Shows... Industry and media need to change; key takeaway individual change that they talk about won't do much... It will help about one percent of our problem... if industry slows production and changes their processes... you cut about 70 percent away... Hum... Yeah greed sounds like the issue here... Even that might be overstepping though cause teh system has existed for so long that it is just how it is; in order for it to change; it has to change... Thus you enter a cycle of confusion; change without change = no change but getting change is hard.
Could the facilities where they contain all the animals in, contain all of the air as well? Somehow?
That ending lol  You can decide for yourself  O.O
I feel like they pulled a fast one on me.
Nothing beats  BEEF
I would buy the calendar after a month or so, it's kinda annoying that it's only for a temporary time
Im still going to eat beef. Im not going to deprive myself of my favorite foods when i know the majority of humans are too stupid to understand logic and science. So many people get so up in arms about petty idiotic problems, they usually only care about or think of short-term stopgaps to briefly patch a problem so it can be ignored. That 'fuck the future, ill be dead anyways' mindset started to particularly take root with the baby boomer generation. Now we all have to pay the price for the short sighted dumbass decisions of their generation and the one after it.
cruingre cru gd crungd crinhe cringe
The best thing is that Kurzgesagt changed the thumbnail from a love-struck cow to a angry cow.
Wait, did you change the thumbnail ?
Doesn't the majority of animal feed consist of things we can't eat?? Like husks and stems? This means that animal production isn't only not wasteful, but it's also making the most out of our resources
Is it also worth considering the restoration of dried arid areas into grasslands with mob grazing methods?
Another factor that's also interesting to look at is the use of water. As that is also a limiting resource in some places on earth.
Hi, friendly neighbourhood ecologist here! I've got a few things to add.  I bulk buy my meat from local farms. Free-range, grass-fed, high welfare within the local area. How is that worse than importing plants like soy from halfway around the world. Planted on deforested lands and grown with fertilisers and pesticides? You should also consider that ruminants can convert the inedible components of food crops such as stalks and husks. I am not just speaking about carbon emissions, but the total environmental impact, including the release of pesticides, fertilisers and how many species can use that habitat.   But ultimately this doesn't really matter. Are humans really capable of veganism? Genetics has shown some people are very poorly adapted at converting plant fats to essential fatty acids. Some people have few copies of AMY1A, meaning a high starch diet will make them sick. As such genes are related to ancestry, they are often combined, including genes that increase people's demand for animal nutrients.  An extreme example is me, low amylase production, bad reaction to plant oils, and a condition called hereditary fructose intolerance (which means I die if I consume too much fructose). There is no such thing as a sustainable vegan diet for me and many others. Because we would be unable to sustain ourselves on one.  Over 80% of vegans quit, and no large-scale vegan societies have survived the millennia. Despite the theoretical benefits it would bring. I would suggest veganism is not a viable solution to feeding the planet.  Instead, perhaps a combination of intensive sewage powered greenhouses, hydroponics, seaweed, and garden allotments to grow plants. While we get our animal nutrients from holistically grazed grasslands, animals fed on agricultural waste products, closed system aquaculture, sustainable shellfish, and insect farming is a better combination to allow humans to flourish without causing as much damage to the environment.
Just in time for the public dislike count being removed lol
Thank you for such a well researched video
Not to take sides, but i am pretty sure there should've been couple of other points in a topic, which i heard over the years: 1. Animals eat parts of a crop that are not suitable for human consumption as well as "discarded" crops not suitable for market. 2. A lot of commercial farms discard vast amounts of crops, due to lack of demand, so to avoid getting caught behind crop cycle, it's just destroyed (not composted). Also cetrain crops either not suitable for animal feed or not commercialy feasable to transport to animal farms. 3. It's not just emissions. Water is an important resource as well. 4. Issue of a dietary and cultural consumption of beef. A lot of cultures in the world consume organ meat and other byproducts of meat undustry, while others have a much larger red meat market, which greatly reduce amount of "usable product" per animal.
To much ducks it’s ok 👍 I like animals
Well made, it seems like an objective display of information. Now let’s not forget that an animal raised industrially will have a life of mutilations, impossibility to move or see the sun, and that is terribly wrong.
I wonder when they're gonna say "We should kill humans as well because they breathe out CO2."
Y u blaming cow farts on me, I didn't do it!
"A kg of beef will keep you alive much longer than a kg of potatoes" F**k you, potatoes are awesome!
I love how he changed his thumbnail from meat love to meat hate and made the animal angry...
I really enjoyed the video, but I feel like you mis-representated the CO2 equivalent emitted per year. You're using different units. One is CO2/year and the other is CO2/100 years. At a glance, it looks like the CO2 removed would far outweigh the CO2 emitted, when in fact the CO2 emitted is 6.25 times greater if you account for all of those 100 years (if you assume the CO2 emitted stays the same).   I would have liked you to say which beef was 10 times better "CO2"-wise than the worst beef, that could have informed people about which beef to choose over another. I want beef, and if I can get it in a less damaging way, I'd choose that beef any day.  I love your channel, and have been enjoying your videos for several years :)
Well I continue to eat meat specially  beef
You're not going to make me eat bugs
"It's complicated"? Uhh, no it's not. It's very simple: Meat bad. Meat bad for environment, meat bad for any kind od humane treatment of animals, meat even bad compared to actual healthy foods. I don't see anything complicated here except trying to tiptoe around the fact that vegans were completely right.
I heard that eating insects might be more beneficial than eating animal meat. I'm not sure if that's true. Maybe you guys will make a video about it at some point.
Didn't it say meat love?Did anyone also find this weird? Or am I just wrong?
This video is FREAKING AWESOME
I’ve never wanted to see a like to dislike ratio so bad
I don't like you changed the thumbnail to a clickbaity one!
China polutes way more
Instead of cows you should eat dogs Westerns.
no
You keep changing the title and thumbnail
Any Muslim watching this, to you I say, beef is halal. So don't worry and keep eating beef.
What if this video is a 'Marketing lie' about veganism?
I know you were focused on emissions, but shipping food containers overseas also pollutes a lot. That pollution will in part damage the sea and its ability to capture co2 and produce oxygen. So, shouldn't it also be accounted for? Great video as always.
John 3:16-21 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.  17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.  18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.  20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.  21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
Im pretty shure there are more fat humans that release more methane than anny cow in a year could ever do
The thumbnail! It changed! The end times are cometh!
Indians: Cow is our god
Great video. Detailed and addresses the finer arguments.
After I stopped eating meat for a few months, it tasted quite disgusting after eating it again.
I liked previous thumbnail more
Can't find the meat love video
totalle agree, I will dedikate my life to eat every cow, chicken and pig that I can.   btw: fuck youtube for removing dislikes, not that i disliked the video - just want to put it up here
Meat is bad...🥩👎
That vegan teacher is gonna murder you
I can't live without meat. I can eat everything else, but I can't live without meat.
Trash video!   “Just stop eating!”  Be serious man.
I don't  eat meat or eggs but i consume Dairy products.  I cannot even think of not consuming milk but yes dairy products are also a threat to the environment
Hey the thumbnail changed
Let's just stop eating red meat and perhaps only poultry
It’s not the job of private citizens to lower their emissions it’s these big corporations and militaries job
As an African it's laughable to hear anyone claim that we are running out of agricultural land. Here in Africa we have some the largest plots of agricultural land in the world, perhaps the largest and yet they're incredibly under utilised by using the most primitive agricultural methods. The same can be said about many Asian countries.
I like how the thumbnail just turned to the Dark Side
I guess there’s some bad videos hidden amongst the good ones.
background music be giving out plants vs zombies' vibes
It has these much likes/dislikes at this moment: 229k/8k
well les lower the 74 % carbon emision then touch food
As a vegan, I'd just like to say to the other vegans that we need to stop trying to tell people what to do. The situation is complicated, and people are in charge of their own bodies
Eat less meat, got it.
Cows eat grass, that pulled CO2 from that atmosphere. That was completely neglected by the video. Cows don't eat coal or petrol. So disappointed in this video, it's anti-meat propaganda.
A lot of lies
I disagree on the thing of buying meat overseas. Trucks may be more inefficient than container ships but you have to consider that you first have to bring the meat to the sea and then from the sea to the land which is for sure more than the 50km of the local meat.  If in Brazil they have to make 1000km in a truck to bring the meat to the coast and then another 200km of truck to bring it to the shop it's not better than the 50km of the local meat
i like meat
Hiding the dislikes is a disgrace. The entire like system is now useless.
In addition to the environmental impact, animal agriculture is the main source of new diseases, probably caused this pandemic, and if nothing changes will cause another.  It's also a waste of resources as we already produce enough plant food to feed all of humanity but we give it to livestock instead while people starve.  The health benefits also seem to favour a plant based diet, given you supplement at least B12 (which we otherwise nowadays get via animals that has eaten supplements).  Most antibiotics are given to animals which drives the evolution of antibiotics resistant bacteria, which could have dire consequences on modern medicine.  Last but not least, animal agriculture causes an unfathomable amount of suffering as it's an industry fundamentally built on the killing, raping and usually torture of sentient beings.  On the other hand, it's one way to make our tongues feel nice.
7.9k dislikes as of this comment.   I think for a video that clearly shows that meat is not great for the environment it's got a good ratio. Mainly because it's not trying to force or shame you, just presenting you with information.  Personally I'm a die-hard meat-eater. I'll just donate to teamtrees and call it even.
It’s murder, does that not impact people’s opinions at all? We just call it beef, and have these nice animations of cows - but they are living animals just like your pets who certainly don’t give their consent to being slaughtered.
the background music sounds like plants vs zombies , I wonder if that was intentional. .
Why did the thumbnail change?
If everyone became Vegan (perhaps only for a day, simultaneously) would global warming stop? Some seem to believe so.
correction : the most environmentally beef is actually pretty well carbon neutral, and has a lesser footprint than a lot of tofu. if you are grazing somewhere that would otherwise naturally have ruminants on it, not much carbon has really been made. true that only applies to some.
Sounds like propaganda to push lab grown meat to the masses. Waiting on What-I’ve-learned’s response to this video.
What happened to original title and thumbnail? I thought you had uploaded two videos and I got excited
My Girlfriend likes my MEAT real BAD and HARD!
Have you looked in to regenerative agriculture ? It seems that, combined with a big decrease of total consumption this is a way to better our agricultural practices. (a good example is Ridgedale farm, in sweden, they have a YT channel as well). Thanks again for your channel !!!
The majority of CO2 released by cows is taken from the atmosphere in the first place. Cows don't eat coal, they eat plants that pulled their CO2 from the atmosphere. It makes them borderline solar powered. The only time they actually release CO2 is through tractors, water pumps and transport. All 3 of those can be switched to nuclear power and in doing so, cows would become carbon neutral. (One caveat, they produce methane which is worse for the atmosphere but degrades into CO2 so they don't produce CO2 but amplify the effect of a finite amount of it. Also if you use their manure to power vehicles, you can skip the methane part and get energy to boot.)
Thing is we don’t need tractors at all for growing veg, we can grow enough on no till living organic. Bio intensive
Go vego
Nobody:- Kurzgesagt with the original title and thumbnail of this video:- 𝘜𝘕𝘖 𝘙𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘦 𝘤𝘢𝘳𝘥
Thank you for the great video!
What about the dietary benefits of meet ? Name me a vegan that doesn’t consume an unhealthy amount of carbs ?   It seems to me like one of the most dangerous things for your diet is the over consumption of fast burning carbs (eg. rice, potato, grain). Theses aren’t entirely bad but most people in the western word consume too much of these which is one of the leading factors in causing obesity.   Too many times I have had someone tell me that they are going to have a “plate of potato’s and no meet because meet is high in those unhealthy fats and proteins” :/  A significant amount of people consume less proteins then they should (ie. less then 25% of there calories). Also nuts, tofu and whey don’t contain a full spectrum of proteins.
So the lesson to be learned here is that there are just too many humans on the planet and we need a lot fewer humans to feed.
Lol I love how they changed the thumbnail 😂😂
Somehow that 41% of Cereal Crops going to Animals doesn't seem like the full story to me, it's probably mostly because of Chickens and Pigs, I don't think cows make the majority in this, because I have seen and know some places where they raise cows in the country I live but the feed those cows got were things that humans don't eat (at least I won't) like the hay or husks they get after the grain is collected, if that makes a large percentage% I think that's kinda more efficient because they would probably just go to waste otherwise.
This needs to talk about sea grass and mangrove carbon sinks as well in comparison to forest carbon sinks.
Isn't it a bit biased to say 41% cereal go into animal, without context? As i grown my own chicken i only used failed or unused parts of cereal that can't even be eaten by human.
I would recommend watching the 'What I've Learned' videos on the beef subject and then compare as some of the information in the video does seem to be misleading. There are phrases thrown in to appear fair, but then information presented straight away to demonize, which may not be entirely correct as you will see from the videos on the 'What I've Learned' channel. I will also say they could have a close battle for the best voiceover.
The problem is we aren't going to get a mass conversion of diet. Even if we did across the countries that actually care about this issue, the rest of the world wouldn't follow suit. And let's be honest, even in the countries that do generally care, it's still a disputed topic.  We need other solutions, whether that's meat alternatives that don't suck or scientific breakthroughs to reduce existing emissions.   This issue lies on the shoulders of corporations, governments and industry, not the general public.
Every second I live I think we are so fucked
Why did you change the video thumbnail? 😭
Idea: creators should share their dislike counts in the description or a regularly updated comment. Thumbs up if you agree.
Why is the Thumb nail and title changed, it's weird I thought you made a new video but it's remade.
Meat is not bad.  It’s fucking delicious.
The emissions from animal agriculture have been seriously underestimated in the IPCC report.   They took the numbers from the FAO, who are partnered with several meat and dairy promoting organisations .  Read Sailesh Rao's paper for a demonstration . The true number is somewhere between 51-87% , including the opportunity cost of the land used.
But aren't avocados pretty bad for the environment because they use too much water I remember hearing something about that?
I guess I will do nothing with this information xD
Been Vegan for Two years
Demon cow thumbnail is a downgrade from the first thumbnail 😬
A perfectly strict Vegan Diet will literally lead any human to their own end. B12 is vital and if you're a vegan, supplementing it, you're lying to yourself
Sad to see that Selfish humans have zero empathy towards animals. Only debating because of climate concerns and their taste... Modern humans are capable of nourishing themselves with vegetarian diet still they are listening to their taste buds... Atleast western rich countries should opt for vegs... Your selfish mentality is the correct reflection of what you are eating right now.. Plz change yourself
It’s a shame animal ethics are barely touched upon in the video, but this could have been worse. However even when people see this information, vegans will still get slammed for eating tofu and the occasional avocado.
Removing the dislike button statistic is a bad idea and Youtube should show it again!
Kangaroos don't fart... so.... generically modified cows. You're welcome.
Damn That's dangerous, gotta eat more beef to reduce the numbers of cows.
And of course there's the "horrible animal suffering" aspect.
In my opinion the way we are dealing with meat nowadays is horrible and also not good for our body nor our planet. We if we ate 1-2 time a week meat we could live soustainable and not destroying our planet with alle the water and land in use + methan ejection. Lab meat is the future anyways, but ppl are afraid of a vaccine, then how will they react to lab meat....
Oh my God❕ this is terrifying and so confusing 😶‍🌫️😓
Feel like a topic was not mentioned the reuse of crop waste we as people can't eat that is fed to animals, this does mitigate a big part of the land use for cattle. Still maybe not enough but it is a big thing since it does reduce a lot of waste we produce from regular farming and crops waste that'd otherwise be thrashed.
I disagree I hate all food
According to the farmers, roughly 8 times the land would be required, when compared to what's currently in use, to feed a vegan world. We would automatically lose most of our natural species as we claimed the remaining land for food growth. Eat meat. Don't be a zealot.
the thumbnail change hits different. Why did you change it ? the new one is exactly the polar opposite of the previous thumbnail
how about explaining how meat especially red meat affects our health due to the bacteria inside
Well in my country beef is banned so...........
Any reason pesticide and destruction of their environment wasn't mentioned in this video? Was this already taken into account for the plant based food in this video or Is there going to be a follow up?
Great video, yet I have still some question,  About animal crop consumption like for soy, they eat the soybean on the stem of the plant which are inedible for us ? Such thing are wasted if an animal doesn't eat them (ok we use corn for the last stage of growth to give more fat to the beef, but we have seriously a problem in excessive corn farming that is disconnected to the video and another topic to search and discuss) I cannot believe that with accounting the proportion of crops indigestible to us the proportion of what goes to beef is so high. Or is it really that bad ?  For the emission since transportation account for so little why do we count the rest the same as fossil fuel emission ? Let me explain if I burn a ton of coal that co2 is there to stay, the carboniferous period is ended and without any new organism that changes the capacity of the earth to absorb more co2, most of what I have emitted burning that coal will remain in the atmosphere (ok the actual molecules will change but for a really long time the surplus will remain) Now let's look at the meat emission aka animal burp and fart, there is methane and co2, both of them come from the carbon that a plant has taken from atmosphere and the next year they will grow again (they will take different molecules from the atmosphere) but in a world where beef is the only emission of humanity technically we should emit every year only what the new crop and grass to feed cattles absorb the next, so is a zero sum, right ? Or not ? I am missing something? Last point is manure fertilizer, we use a lot of that and since artificial fertilizer has some emission while manure is a free byproduct (as I have explained with my argument above) isn't this to be accounted ? Besides all my argument I think that we eat too much meat pro capita and that should change for our own good before talking about climate change
nice new thumbnail Kurzgesagt
Wait, did the thumbnail change?
YOU WILL EAT ZE BUGS
Please make Greek subtitles, you are amazing ❤️
The main problem with everyone cutting out meat is the massive monoculture of the same crop for miles on end, which massively destroys any biodiversity in an environment. Deforestation for certain popular crops in the amazon, for example ,would be worse to facilitate this massively increasing demand for vegetarian diets.
Last climate video - carbon footprint is BS and isnt the citizens burden, but rather the large companies and factories trying to pass the buck.  This video - How to eat better to reduce your carbon footprint.   Summary - As long as china and india exist, nothing can be done, quit worrying about it, it's not as big a deal as the media makes it out to be.
Kurzgesagt: Blackholes is awesome!!!  Me: YESSSHHHH!!!!  Kurzgesagt: Meat is bad.  Me: I have conflicted feeling about this...
As someone who really have gone vegan for over 3 years, and even tho blood tests were perfect, my body just started to break down. Without anybody really understanding why, I for the longest time was in denial thinking that eating meat had no benefit, but after a vacation i ended up having to eat alot of meat there, just because it was what I was served, and then suddenly started feeling much better, and all my health issues started to disappear.  I realised some how that there is just something in meat that my body needs. My wife does just fine on a vegan diet still. So i think its a very personalised thing.
No..
NOTHING UNNATURAL CAN BE BETTER THAN NATURAL ONE!
cant wait for the vegan teacher to react to this video
Please Add rus sub
This is a fair response to the liberal technocrat narrative. Also, get the 'return youtube dislike' addon for Firefox or Chrome.
how much increase in carbon foot print from switching people to dependacy on pharmacuitical products as a result of vegan diet?
less humans on earth = more food and free land and less climate change. Easy peasy 😂
I think a really important thing in this topic is cultured meat, I think it's probably the future and it's interessant to keep an eye and observe how it's evolving and getting more efficient and cheap every year thanks to researchers
Why did you change the thumbnail?
The sad truth of this matter is that if we are to all go vegan, we will be responsible for a massive extinction event. Most the animals we eat rarely exist in the wild or straight up don’t. Even if there were still a few places and we released them there, we would absolutely ruin the land with the amount of animals we bring there. To stop eating meat means the largest mass killing of livestock to ever occur. If anyone has any information I’ve missed out on regarding this then please let me know what it is and where to find it as I truly do want to know if there is a solution.
Wasn't there a Kurzgesagt video with the thumbnail 'MEAT LOVE'? Where did it go? Am I finally getting crazy(ier)?
Today I've Learnt alot....
I mean hey maybe if the most efficient  way to produce meat means treating animals inhumanly then maybe we shouldn’t be producing meat (in such large numbers, there are very valid reasons to eat meat, like if you raised and/or hunted the animal it’s probably fine, or if you have a cellulose allergy or something along those lines)   Besides, have y’all tasted the other ways of getting protein, honestly give me some falafel over a steak any day, that shit slaps.

i love how you changed the thumbnail
I like  your videos so much. And  every  new video the the monkey always have a new item in hes/her hand❤❤❤❤
Meat
Answer is new technology Like a robots to DIg shit cow to under ground to feterlize ground. Technology to catch methan.  Better look for how many ground use CO2 to make from indiustry fertyrilze. If will be cheap robots in aliexpers to farm np small excavator ai WHO collect shit to bioreactor WHO have growing bacteria WHO make hydrogen and other gas. In agriculture this gas will be use in power generation and power generation  seen burning efect  CO2 etc. To the aquarium where we find next microbs to clear this. I think problem is about monopoly. Because monopoly don't think can help build infarscture WHO will be freedom clients for need buy gasline.
The keto diet has done wonders for my health, I'm not going back. Doing keto on a plant based diet, while possible, requires a bunch of supplementation that I can't properly afford. And people who do this look like ghosts. If cow is the big issue, that's fine. But I won't sacrifice my health.
I think there is one more important aspect that goes into the equation. In the US approximately 30 - 40% of food is wasted. So even though you cut meat from your diet that doesn't mean the meat wouldn't be manufactured. When you compare it with the information in this video, you find out it's not a problem to have to meet a couple of times a week. The problem is a system that creates more than it's possible to consume.
Just stop eating beef then
Anyway I am hungry now let's eat meat 😋
If you like meat like this comment,if you don't comment,let's have a poll:
9:35 , if you multiply 50 billion (Amount of CO2) by 100 (100 yrs) and then subtract the product by 800billion ((50b * 100) - 800bil, then there would still be 4 trillion and 200 trillion worth of CO2 left.
I’m a carnivore, can’t help it
Is the thumbnail changed?
Hi! It does not belong to this topic, but it would be great if you could make a video about the Bermuda Triangle as well! Love your work!
New thumbnail looks interesting compared to the old one.
YEET that MEAT!   MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT MEAT
But beef is tasty
Most people don’t have the attentions span to understand this information, which is sad.
That's why I am vegan🥦🥕🌽
Mist important video for humans to date!
Yay
lmao he change the thumbnail
Will this stop people eating meat? No. They’ll think of some reason why it’s ok and keep ignoring the problem, and ethics were barely “grazed” in this video
So by your logic if 26% uses all our carbon limit by 2100 then we're fucked by 2020 then
what about fish? would pescatarian be a  good option?
Man, Thanos would LOVE this channel.
What happened to the old thumbnail
Literally AOC‘s cow farts, lol. No thanks, I’ll never be a soyboy.
Make genetically modified caws that will emit hydrogen instead of methane.
It really pissed me off that people are even trying to make normal people vegan. Like I will never go vegan! Finally somthing to push back at vegasm
I prefer meat
Respect other's lives. Stop seeing other individual's body parts as 'food'.
Technically all the methane produced from cattle isn't added to the environment. It is because methane has a different life cycle than carbon dioxide. If you add more cows they wouldn't add more methane into the environment. It has a lot to do with how methane circulates in the environment. An example of this is when a cow eats grass the cow farts and poops methane gas. This methane gas reaches the atmosphere and stays there until a downpour of water happens. This has been going on for thousand's of years without any human intervention. Then the grass will absorb said methane and the cycle will repeat. It doesn't add. America has one of the most efficient cows in the world. Cows in the middle east produce much less in meat and milk compared to their western counterparts. An actual way to make them less harmful to the environment is to make their cows more efficient. But it's not obvious to the normal person. It's not. Does Jordan Peterson talk about the best way to solve climate change is to make poorer countries richer? Mind you he has read over 200 books on climate change. It's because poorer countries make more waste per person because of their less efficient sources of goods and services. It's not obvious to the normal person they only listen to what rattles their emotions. It's much more encouraging to hear Bring down the system rather than make cows in the middle east be more efficient or try make everyone richer.
im vegan now and i havent even started the video. thank you kurgskesaght(no cap)
Lmao keep these meat videos coming... Makes my meat more tasty as I watch em
no agenda here at all.
This is the nicest way to tell someone that beef is harming our environment. I avoid talking about this because I don’t want to come across as the annoying vegan lol
Oh sure, everyone talks about how we can't eat meat because of the environment, but when I tell them eating humans to lower the population will help the environment AND be deliciously meatly, suddenly I'm the bad guy!
Incredibly well researched and made. Thanks for the hard work as always, the Kurzgesagt team!
love the video :) we don’t need to kill animals to survive, and it’s better for the environment 🥳
am i the only one that thinks food is nowhere close to being the best thing about being alive
Still eating meat.
9:12 or we could just use the land to make enough food for everyone instead of having people die of hunger
Yes. Cows do fart on farms, but so do vegetarians. Compare a meat eater, who eats only two or three steaks a day and a vegetarian, who eats large amounts of plants. Who farts the most? Of course the vegetarian. The methane from their farts is a greenhouse gas, so vegetarians also take part in global warming.
Veganism is a cult.
I don't like the taste of meat 😃
fix the other 75% of the emissions issues 1st (looking at you power industry) then i'll give up beef.
Or we could look at the real problem, or I guess two problems with global climate change, China and India
I just don't get why people don't eat more pork. Tastes the same or better, cheaper, better for the animals and the environment.
no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed more than once a day and never gets old? .....  honey you need to talk to my boyfriend he'd disagree
Meat gets a lot of hate for other reasons too besides climate change though. Like ethics and morals for not condoning animal cruelty. Or that it's actually unhealthy apparently, that humans were intended to be herbivores rather than omnivores, that eating meat leads to all sorts of issues including heart disease and sexual difficulties
wtf i watched this yesterday and the thumbnail was meat love and now it's meat hate
you forgot to mention vegan food taste tastes like shit compared to meat
Well once thing is for sure; animals grown for food only created greenhouse gases, while plants create a bit of oxygen as well - go vegetarian 😝👍🏼
f youtube bring dislike counts back... i mean i liked the video but cmon. free speech? voting? youtube is used for debates and serious topics as well. not everyone is your typical cringe "child friendly YouTuber".
And about beef using our food, it need yet another later of explanation, this research count all green parts of said pant, and then it's calculated how meany of this mass goes for human, problem is even weed has only up to 50% of mass edible for humans.
What the hell happened with the thumbnail??? Where's that lovely cow???
Finally an unbiased well researched video on this topic. Thank you very much.
Animans owns nothing beside their own lives, Still we managed to steal it!! Go Vegan. For Empathy. For Future.  We like rescue videos of cats dogs deers but when new born male calve is being seperated from mother we prefer to close eyes.  Many people still don't know that cow gives birth to calve then and then only she is producing milk. So the farmer sends 1 day old baby calve to butcher and takes away all the milk from grieving/crying cow. Tragedy.
Meat is delicious and I’ll never quit eating it.  That said, I’d happily consume lab-grown meat or plant based meat alternatives.
IPCC raport wrote about beef that it's efficient. So either is Kurzgesagt wrong or IPCC is wrong. And I believe in IPCC report. Here we go qoute form IPCC report  Still, products like red meat remain the most inefficient in terms of emissions per kg of protein 2 produced in comparison to milk, pork, eggs and all crop products (IPCC 2014b). Yet, the functional 3 unit used in these measurements is higly relevant and may produce different results (Salou et al. 4 2017). For instance, metrics based on products tend to rate intensive livestock systems as efficient, 5 while metrics based on area or resources used tend to rate extensive system as efficient (Garnett 6 2011).
I’m 3 million views too late but can I still have the skill shade link
I’m vegan and I’m doing it for the animals
Generations of early humans eating cooked meat is what allowed the human brain to evolve the way they did.
whenever i am going to be a teacher i am going to let my class watch these kind of vids
The question comes next, how much of this carbon (as both methane and CO2) is being added to the carbon flux? It's great talking about emissions, but the bad part of plastics and fossil fuels is that this carbon is being sourced from previously locked away places. The plants, cereals and grasses used to feed cattle can remove more carbon from the air than becomes valid nutrient for the cows, so how does that fair?
My answer, I'm gonna eat my meat while I laugh at the bug eaters
love to eat some good bacons infront of vegans
Would have loved a "what if" scenario with only pork/poultry and fish in it, how much would that reduce the annual emissions.
Is showing compassion really that difficult?
Wake up samurai, we got synthetic beef to eat.
The Carbon footprint huh? What about the water footprint? Meat has a huge water footprint.
Meat is bad
ok
The best way to combat this problem is to lower the amount of humans on earth
Vegan diet provides very little of the important vitamins and minerals like B12, Omega-3,... These are important for brain functioning. It's hard to choose to be vegan, because no one wants to have brain problems. Unless we constantly take supplement.
One day they are going to ban meat but they can get fucked I'm always gonna eat animals they're delicious.
Carbon footprint is meaningless. All carbon does is make plants grow bigger. All carbon emission reductions are completely useless and done for political reasons.
B E E F   S T O N K S
I love the opening line but i heartily disagree that regular FOOD is the most enjoyable physical aspect: id be happy to test having sex three times a day with "snacks" whenever i want and being able to choose samples from around the world.  . . . . . . A British breakfast, French for lunch and something spicey and Brazilian for dinner . . . .hapoy to volunteer to twst that hypothesis. 😂
who watched this before it changed
Wasnt the thumbnail for this video different?
what happened with the thumbnail lmao
Meat Love and Meat Hate: *exist* Kurzgesagt: I’m playing both sides, so that I always come out on top.   Edit: wow it’s literally a warzone of politics in the comments
I appreciate this video and felt like they really tried when they are comparing the CO2 emissions with animal products vs plants but wish they would just come out straight and say "We have alternative options, therefore we don't need to eat meat, plus they are sentient and it's not moral when alternative options plenty for most people"
Didn't you change thumbnail
First video after coming from a 12 day camp
the thumbnail switch reminded me of the   "Kill"   "Live"  meme
The original thumbnail was "Meat Love" then they changed it to "Meat Hate". Wtf??
"But isn't it a bit out of touch to demonize COWS so much ?" Well, YOU breed it, feed it, milk it, back it up for another day, then kill it. Obviously, THEY are the evils.
I am hoping to see that one day everyone will decide to follow only plant based food because after 100 years we would say things we have done to our planet was so wrong on so many ways.
Eat the bugs. Sit in your pod. Own nothing. Inject yourself. The sun monster will kill you if you don't obey.
So you are telling me that avoiding beef due to my fear of mad cow disease helps the environment?
@veganteacher
We are already late to stop carbon emission so just eat your damn food while you can
Yes
I hate how you can't see the dislikes this is such a good topic
nothing is really bad if you wanna go that way. "cause reason" the question is the reason good enough, then everyone decide whats good enough. endless dilema. i think its bad if its causing unessential suffering. therefore its just psychopahty, unessential?=then not survival. then its for pleasure. then its exploiting animal and make them suffer *quickly with a blade* and raised in tiny cage.. for pleasure? unessential. unless you on an island surviving. yes, meat is bad i alot of case. almost all of case.
Confucius say, good to meet girl in park, better to park meat in girl.
@That Vegan Teacher
what i want to do is become a vegetarian, but what i wont do is become a vegetarian because beef tastes really good
LOL HE SAID TWOFO HAHAHAHAHAHHA
The driver of climate change is too many people. You said it yourself. We just eat, don't do anything else, and we die. It's because there's too many of us. Cutting out meat won't help in the long run if our population keeps exploding.
Can you do a video on the ethical argument against enslaving, torturing and slaughtering trillions of sentient beings when we have an abundance of alternatives?
I can say everything that isn’t vegan except honey is really bad for you including soy but I understand how people can think it’s healthy brainwashing stuff
Lol anyone else notice that kurzgesagt changed the thumbnail and title of the vid? Wonder why 🤔 (seriously)
Skillshare is totally dumb, they don't have a proper billing options. Pretty much any card dosent work here in INDIA
What this video seems to be missing is that cattle, which is grass-fed, emits much less GHG in total than factory bred cattle, because of the way cow metabolism works. Protein rich foods like corn and soy are accountable for much higher GHG emissions, as their production needs a lot of fertilizers, such as N20 or NH3, which appear in enormous quantities and heat up the atmosphere even faster.
people have eaten meat for as long as there was man, so have animals, so I don't see the point in switching to no flavor.
Wasn't this vid named meat love?
God. I hate vegans and their pseudo-logic. They talk about livestock farming being so awful for the environment, yet just about all of their foods contain things like palm oil, which is causing a massive environmental disaster. I can’t take them seriously with hypocrisy like that.
7:57 "Pastureland alone can't support the ruminants living on it." The caveat here would be "with traditional grazing methods". Which are letting them eat whatever they want and go wherever they like. But with rotational grazing by design a paddock must be large enough and healthy enough to support all animals on it. It's less yield but sustainable (for the environment and the needs of the animals), with less cost in, and sometimes slightly more profitable per animal.   Unfortunately it's not very popular as it requires more work per person and less profit overall. Fewer animals taking up the same overall space means less total money even if each animal earns the same or a little bit more. As much as 90% of the land goes unused 90% of the time (Being left to rest to recover the natural ecology before the cows come in to keep it from getting too wild). There is also a lot of fencing (electrified mesh) that needs to be moved manually in wedges every few days. As well as water troughs that need to be moved and refilled to each new paddock area.  As a consequence really only smaller farmers that one can get to care more about the sustainability of their business and the environment are likely to adopt it. Whereas big commercial farms are perfectly happy to keep doing things the way they have been. As if not more profitable per animal but less profitable overall is no real incentive for commercial farms to change their methods. And if everyone switch to rotational grazing it would also take up a lot more land overall to sustain the same amount of cattle as we do now (though this would be greatly mitigated by needing less land to grow feed on).
But if you're counting the emissions for clearing land to produce beef, none of that measure applies to the sustainability OR ongoing emissions cost of current beef production.  If someone's science is conflating two different things (the ecological costs of beef production, and the ecological costs of *expanding* beef production) on an issue this controversial, I have to entertain strong suspicions that they may have an axe to grind.
Suffering animals are better for the environment  Because you know if you are locked in a cage you don't burp, fart at all 🤣   Also potatoes vs beef is pointless when historically entire nations relied on potatoes to survive (like the Irish).  Finally, you missed one thing - crops raised to feed animals slaughtered to feed human pets. The entire US pet population eats as much as the human population of France.
If you Really care about gas emissions, then just do c****balism, just the m*rdering part is illegal
Interesting
Come on Kurzgesagt, you are the best YouTube channel for a reason. Every statistic shows being a vegetarian or vegan is better for the environment. I know you Germans love your Wurst sausages but declare it already: being a vegetarian is just better overall!
Great video as always! One question, do the co2 comparisons take into consideration that a much larger share or vegetables is wasted/spoils than meat? Would be interesting to see what is the "net" co2 per kg consumed, rather than produced.
I'd be super interested to hear about the ethics of vegetarian diets. Soy crops still need pest control and rice paddies produce vast amounts of CO2 and methane due to bacterial growth and ruins the earth for any other crops.
The one thing videos like this forget, we are omnivores we need meat so survive. After one turns vegan majority develop mental problems like depression, lowered cognitive capability and are easily fatigued do to the lack of vitamins, not only that people have died after turning vegans. Around 60% of vegans do not get the vitamins they need even after taking vitamin supplements. People might say well buying vitamins is better then eating meat, it is true that you can get it from other sources but there is one big problem with that, the amount of vitamins you would need to equal the amount you would get from meats is staggering and in the process would create more co2.
Is not korean....? ㅠㅠ
Có ai là người Việt không , hello , :333
I read "Could the title be any longer?" in Chander's voice in my mind.
Food was never a problem for the world, Population is. Increasing population causing all thease land and food/ CO2 problems, .
I destroyed the earth by using the earth
So do avos and seasonal fruits not get transported by truck the last miles? Do the ships directly drop these off in the stores? Not a fair comparison on that point.  You're not looking at regenerative agriculture either, rather than just conventional commercial farming.  The soy animals eat is mostly what is not ever used for human consumption. People buying faux meat is pushing up the need to clear more land for soy beans.  Why not encourage people to buy local regenerative agriculture products?   But this is once again not about facts but about pushing your agenda. There is a lot of hate from this channel regarding meat, to the point that it is irrational.
Only legends knew he changed the thumbnail from summer camp to Austerlitz
And then theres me, a person who unironically really likes the taste of meat alternatives like beyond meat, but physically cant eat them due to being allergic
thumbnail chanege

My only problem with the Brazil angle is that developed nations, who have cut down their forests and already gone through industrial revolutions are now scolding developing nations for trying to do the same to improve the lives of their citizens.  If we all need the Amazon, we should all contribute to its protection.
I hate to tell you, but I still don't want to give up meat
i will continue to eat meat. was eating a cheeseburger as i was watching this lmao
I wish you guys would do sleepcasts or something. Although I enjoy your videos while I'm awake and active, I've recently found that your narrator's voice is so calm and soothing that I'm lulled to sleep when I leave videos running when I'm trying to sleep. I usually need to take melatonin to fall asleep quickly but I'm knocked out after listening to just 2 videos in bed. Not even the Headspace app is as effective as your narrator's voice!
I could have sworn the previous thumbnail said meat love
"Everyday is leg day"
Biggest comtributor to climate change isnt meat either, its food waste.
We need meat to survive,without it we would become malnourished and starve, humans are meat eaters
Yes
4:50 You still have to get the product from the port in San Francisco, to the myriad of transportation facilities, then to my house in the Texas Panhandle.
So. Some things not discussed. No one mentions the cities. Big cities, bigger towns. Also. Plants need Co2, so aren’t you causing more harm that way? Finally, I have heard  that those that don’t eat meat have a lot of problems. My argument is: our teeth are a certain way for a reason. We are omnivores. Both meat and plants and fruits. Also, those that make the most racket about “climate change” do nothing to help. They still have multiple and huge homes, fly around in private jets. We’re in a thing called an interglacial period. Earth heats up. Antartica used to have swamp and jungle for Pete’s sake!!!
Answer: No Reason: Its not about the tool, but the farmer holding the tool.
Cool. Now compare the meat/food/carbon problem with computers.
Next is Meat Neutral
Idk if it's good or bad, all ik is that i beat it
At work, my job is to throw away 2 tons of food everyday. Well at least on my shift. Idk how much they throw away on 1st shift. Probably more because they be busier than 2nd.
I can't bring myself to eat pork or anything pig related  You can guess why
Meat eaters are nothing but animals .Not worth calling humans .
Well… I don’t consume dairy, but I still eat meat.
Meat is the best choice for you. In time this world will die out and we might as well get what we can and move to Mars.
Our family eats meat only twice or thrice a month, or sometimes never during festivals. So, i don't think i am doing too much to the environment  I love meat though, so I can't change😅 but i already eat it less and will also eat less meat in future so i guess that's right, to some extent? Also, i don't eat beef cuz i am indian.
0:03 Cannibalism💀
wait, where is the meat love video?
I would like to see suggestions on why natural meat is good.
I see what you did there with the thumbnail. very clever
If you compared fossil carbon emissions instead (which is the driver for climate change) your movie and conclusions would turn out another way.
What happen to fish as meat and aquaponic sustainable method to combat climate change and food scarcity problem
This video is making me madly crave for some meat lmao
Nice 👍
I feel the best way to eat is not to go full vegan necessarily, but to limit the amount of times you eat meat. I eat the occasional fish or chicken maybe once or twice every two days. It also makes it much more rewarding when you have your meat 'treats'. Just my opinion.
Feels weird to focus the arguments on environment Logically speaking, the argument "I'll stop eating beef, but let's kill 60% of cows to save the environment" should satisfy vegetarians/vegans based on this video's logic But I bet they would be horrified at the notion I mean sure environment is important, but vegans love animals too
Meat love 🥰🤩💖  Meat hate 💔🤬💀
I have an idea! Humans are a huge co2 emitter, to live they breath like all the time and produces enormous amount of co2 per day. Now think human has around 10 billions of population as of now and think how much co2 a day they generate.  Then think how much total co2 is getting into the air by humans each year! Humans should stop breathing and that way we can cut down the co2 emission very very quickly.
*Just because you make excellent and informative videos doesn’t mean you can say “mi-thane”, kurzgesagt*
I only live once, ima eat as much meat as possible.
The thumbnail change?
Tbh I would give up beef for potatoes
Is it just me or was the thumbnail changed
You had me at beef stonks 🤣🤙 beeeeeeef stooooooonks
Wait a minute, this wasn't the thumbnail nor the title 2 days ago!
Why do you put birds as pictures? /:|
Oh my god the thumbnail change
What about hay? Cattle aren’t just fed grains people grow hay to feed their cattle through the winter
Holy, the thumbnail took a full 180 in just the 2 days it was out
There is no cow level
Key takeaway: eat less beef. I can do that.
Taxes on non-vegetarian food should be increased
In short the answer is farming “emissions” are are myth. Meethane doesn’t exist and cows aren’t producing methane. At least not according to our resident expert.  So all in all we can still say fuck plant murderers.
" Yes, ve gan! "
I think you are far more likely to get people to pay the 10 trillion dollars to get carbon collectors then to stop eating beef.
While all of these "meat bad, go vegan" might be very trendy I am sure future generation will look at as and laugh that we molded stat to fit into our beliefs so much!
Meat, forests, industrial Hemp Easy
I mainly only eat chicken rather than beef. I just really like chicken
The rainforests of Amazon should be declared an international reserved forests! The number of Cattle a Nation can process should be reduced and limited! More emphasis should be given on Deep sea fisheries , Kelp farming And Fish and Poltury should be used to replace Mamalian  meat
I didn't see anything in here about cows eating seaweed, which is meant to reduce methane emissions dramatically. Is that a real thing or just hype?
He changed his thumbnail from meat love to literally *meat* *hate*
Dislike
East or West Meat is the Best!!
so you changed the thumnail right?
counting the gasses cows make when eating grass in the co2 emissions total? I would like to point out that grass decomposing has the same effect.
Please do the sixth mass exctinction  'Anthropocene defaunation'   Please please it is a very good topic...
Would switching to a wild-caught fish only diet globally help alleviate? Or would the carbon footprint of catching them or the ecological damage outweight the benefits? After all, over 70% of Earth is water; there must be enough fish for everyone, if only we could catch them.
Hindus were way ahead of our time then
Literally just watched Dominion last night what a convenient time for this to release
@kurzgesagt what about fish/seafood ?? Seafood was not covered in this vid.
I like chicken better anyway
Lmao  What!? I Haven't watched the video yet  But the way they changed thumbnail in two days is hilarious
Legends know thumbnail is changed😎
HEY I saw MEAT LOVE and you changed it to MEAT HATE hahaha what is this
There's very little waste with meat products, but 40-60% of non-meat products spoil or discarded before they're eaten.
I’ve decided to help the environment by not having children.
woh woh did he just say that we are all dead at the maximum date of 2100 ! ummm sorry grand kids
This video is quite impressive for many reasons, it quickly skyrocketed up in views just because they changed the title card. It discusses the topic with detail without being incredibly confusing and the comments  section is also pretty interesting normally vegans in comment sections act out of line and straight-up attack people for simply enjoying their lives yet here they are being pretty chilled which is surprising given how toxic they can be.
Banned from replies: Not having dislikes means I can't really tell how well-received this video is. Which sucks because this is such a heated topic. "We weren't able to add your reply. Please try again."    Yeeting dislikes and comment threads is well in keeping with bill gates funded ideologues creating slick cartoon productions... your betters don't put of with the detraction of the dregs below them.
Is it just me or does eating plants directly makes more sense than feeding those plants to animals for like 10 years and then killing that animal and use it to cook one night's dinner?
Summary: CO2 emmissions are mainly due to animal farts not only the meat. If you dont eat meat the alive cow would increase emmissions anyway.
Hitler was a vegan.
The worst thing anyone could ever be is vegan. I'd rather befriend an actual KKK memeber than have to put up with being near a vegan.
I hate meat that's why i beat it
Well its complicated...as if rest is easy..
nope its not.
bill gates funded ideologues say what?
Synthetic beef and meat can save animals from cruel methods and cut down emissions
i remind the thumbnail before they changed it it showed up the cow with hearts on is eyes on an more colorfull background
This video is quite an eye opener. I don't think I will quit the meat tbh, kinda rely on how cheap it is in my region, but I will work to have less. To be real a lot of western countries are to blame for how inflated the meat industry is. Americans eat multiple times more meat than any other country in the world. So to be real sorry Jimmy but Texan steak every Friday is gonna have to be put on the back burner.  Speaking of which I really wish Kurzgesagt would talk about fish as in a previous video they talked about how healthy it is in comparison to other types of meat. Hoping there is a solution there that doesn't end up destroying our oceans while keeping the carbon footprint low.
I think we need to take baby steps to bring everybody on board to reduce emissions. Rather than telling people to not eat meat entirely, just start by cutting down on beef. What about milk? What if we stopped eating steaks and beef patties and switched to lamb or chicken instead, but kept milk for dairy products? It makes it seem like simply reducing BEEF alone would solve the problem. I couldn’t go all vegan purely on the selfish basis that it tastes disgusting, but I could totally just cut out beef and eat a different meat instead.
New thumb nail?
trash!!
I will tell you right now I will not be switching to a bug and veggies only diet. I'd see myself and the rest of the world buried first. Find another way to deal with climate change, I shant be giving up meat and if there's an attempt to force it we will have massive problems.
Faltan los subtítulos en español :(
The problem here is cost, the meat industry deliberately keeps meat alternatives high in costs and impractical for mass adoption, the only way to break this is by cracking down on the meat lobby
Duality of man
Meat no, Factory farming yes.
I love this video. I wrote a paper taking a closer look at the role methane plays. For anybody curious, when @Kurzgesagt says methane's a whole lot more potent, we're talking about 25x as effective at trapping heat in atmo than CO2
Literally nothing will get me to give up meat.
Did kruzegast change the image??
I thought this video was going to be about how good or bad meat is for your body, still interesting tho.
Preschooler: "What's 2 + 2?" Kurzgesagt: "Well, it's complicated."
Meat love in the first few days Meat hate now.
Fun fact: the old thumbnail is still at the German channel of kurzgesagt
Serial killers are actually helping humans live longer
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old." ...I can list at least one other besides eating.
Just stopped eating meat because of my eczema. Hope it helps
Hunting rifle go brrrrrr
The study you linked has an errata which says they vastly overestimated the emissions by the food sector. You can also google and see that it's closer to 10% of emissions than it is to 26%. I don't understand how you got that wrong. The info is so easy to find.
So meat isn't bad, raising animals for meat is. I'll keep hunting deer in that case.   If we increase the amount of fields, the amount of deer will grow as well. Someone needs to cull the herd. Maybe the sale of game will be allowed again.  Probably not...
Some one tell me that this had a different picture on the video and I’m not just going crazy
Why'd you change the thumbnail XD
👍
Alright guys, y'all go ahead and abolish cattle ranching and raising other animals for food. I'll keep shooting (and eating) the deer before they get in your fields. It's a win-win!
veggie patties will kill you in the long run. Steak will keep you strong and in shape. So, yeah. I choose living healthy.
the change of thumbnails are....terrifying
What about regenerative agriculture that uses livestock as part of the crop rotation cycle
title should be "Is Meat Really that Bad FOR THE CLIMATE?" there's definitely plenty of other undiscussed ways meat/the industry is bad especially in the US
well now I'm just sad.
I have this odd theory related to climate change. So we all know that when our body is fighting deases it heats up to kill germs , but in the process it also kills it's own body cells . SO WHAT IF  the earth is heating up to kill us ?! And in the process it's also killing some plants, marine life, etc. ? Also, Please reply or like because yt is acting wierd and does not post my comments or replies when I tell important info.
HAS ANYONE NOTICED STONKS??? 8:16
Why is a helper T cell a food ?
Idc I want meat in my meal. Doesn't matter if it's artificial or not as long as it tastes like meat and Doesn't poison my body
I just eat candy
The difference between beef and everything is quite stark. Eating beef 1 day a week and a vegan diet the other 6 days produces more emissions than eating chicken and pork every day.
I just wish we could genetically engineer a fast growing carbon MAD sucking tree
Are u cereal?
Thanks to Tesla we're getting electric cars electric trucks electric semi trucks electric helicopters electric planes electric ships electric boats I'll wait animals cause pollution too well there already electrical chemical let's go full on electromagnetic we are giting robots man!! Hahaha🤣
THe future is all about lab grown meat
This is a PSA video for all the people in the west who want China to stop eating pork.
No eating meat , be vegan , respect all life forms on earth , live and let others live.
Cool, but I don't care. Meat is great, I want it, and I will get it. The solution to CO2 emissions is technological absorption at the sources of carbon, not reduction in carbon production. Your right to punch ends at my nose, that's just fact. As such, you do not have the right to take what I wish to eat from me, nor make me feel bad for what I consume. You do not have the right to affect others around you. You vegheads can fuck off into the woods and live primitive shitty lives with no carbon emissions all you want. I'm going to continue being a civilized person, and I'm pretty sure that the vast majority of the world is going to do the same. There are plenty of uninhabited places, find one, use it. Oh and the Internet is worse for the environment than meat so, you should probably log off forever now okay? Okay. Bye!
We’re fucked either way.  If we need to change global warming and reducing co2 in the air is the way to do it then we need to find a more efficient way to remove it from the air.  That would mean some manual method likely done by a machine or a bioengineered organism that could actually remove it quicker than we are emitting it and thus stabilize the climate.
its funny because the only reason humans are having this problem is because humans cant self regulate there sex lives causing an overpopulation of one species on earth. if it help think of humans as a virus and earth a human body.
Well maybe, but it sure is delicious
Meat isn't bad. Too much meat is. It isn't difficult.
Changed the thumb nail
Still gonna eat the fuck out of some burgers and chicken nuggies
beef stonks.
Guys the thumbnail before this was so cute, why did you have to change it?!!! 😩😩
For anyone to act like having animals on the planet are responsible for climate change is ridiculous.
Ill just grow my own cows. Plus i can have that special moment when i bond with a certain one then the attachment grows to strong so when i put a bullet in its head i act like the cow did something terrible. Then bawl my eyes out while butter basting the steak using homemade butter that i got from using that same cows milk and rosemary then placed next to a side of asparagus and potatoes to rest. Then enjoy. I think i’m gonna do that.
feels like yet another reason for vertical farms need to happen quicker if I were governments I would be putting massive investments in that shit, the country that gets that cost the lowest, and automated I think will be able to get their prices for food the lowest, and poor peoples biggest expense could be taken care of.
This is rubbish unnecessary analysis
A cow fart is part of our Current "carbon cycle", but the fossil fuel you burn its from a "carbon cycle" buried millions of years ago, how is it that you put them in the same bag, its crazy, the problem is putting green house gasses in the atmosphere from the past in to the present, this is the problem, but I guess your Bill & Melinda Gates foundation colab got you confused
Love the channel, I watch every video and I'm not trolling. That being said this segment made me hungry so I'm firing up the grill and I'll plant 2 more trees on my property this weekend.
Who loves beef stonks? ;) 8:13
I am not the one mass producing cash cow or cash crops. Thanks corporations. :D
I swear the thumbnail was a happy cow and not an evil one when this video came out lol.  By the way, awesome video as always. I know ya'll bust your butts to research and edit these things. We're very grateful!
There's a reason why I love this channel so much. You're looking at it.
the thumbnail was meat love before
Thumbnail change…
4:50 But I thought freight ships cause huge emissions?
I like how they changed the thumbnail
Whats the point* wont the worlds capital greed end the whole world anyway*/
It's f00kin sad, we're all goin' to die :|
From Angel Giraffe to Demon Cow Thumbnail.
that thumbnail sure changed...
so basically its like: meat is kinda bad, and we can fix that and help global warming and climate change, but the world hates less meat, so we can't
My calander was labeled 3/616
IDK what vegans talk about, but even if that chicken was stuck in a box barely bigger than it is,  im still going to get some.
this still doesn't go into any of the other pros and cons of meat, just environmental impacts
No. It's not. Shut up.
Can someone explain how optimizing resource efficiency against increasing demand for quality of life and population growth is in any way sustainable?   Sure, the population is thought to reach a plateau eventually, but i won't believe such an ex-machina until I see it. Not to mention the demands for resources caused by immigration and high birth rates in third world countries. Some of which even have an emphasis on overindulgence as a cultural mark of prosperity. Are we sure our efficient plans will still support these people?
I fucking love these videos and how you guys present them.
Would like to know how chicken and lamb impact emissions in a similar manner
When I went to study in India, i learned that they are only allowed eat non-veg around 2 times a week. Also most of them only eat on Sundays. Due to Hindu majority and Muslim Minority, Beef ( due to Hindu beliefs) and Pork ( due to Muslim beliefs) have been forbidden by society. All they eat is Chicken and fish (mostly chicken and rarely fish), and only once a week or so. We could really learn from them in that aspect. (I was a British-Irish student who studied in IIT Mumbai for 4 years)
So this video started really really good with fair comparisons.  Then you compared shipping a massive amount via boat to driving... without the fact what was shipped via boat needs to be driven. You omitted the most costly part of the transport for plants.  Then you brought attention the issue of cutting down forests and such to make room for cows was part of the problem but the area I live is cut down forests... with crop growing farm land.  It went from fair to almost completely one sided and leaving out the comparisons and fair relativity.  I was reading the comments to see if anyone noticed and... I saw your video original had the thumbnail "Meat Love" but went to "Meat Hate" sometime after meaning you're trying to make it appear more approachable for subs while then using controversy to draw in others.  It went from an clickbait video to a controversy video with questionably unfair methods used to skewer information.
lol i thought you guys uploaded another video that has a completely different view on meat since the thumbnail is pretty different
So the title of the video was purposely changed from "meat love" to "meat hate" probably to f--k with YouTubes algorithm.  It has been proven numerous times that people tend to click on negative videos rather than on positive videos, a growing culture which probably will take the human race down (i hope that it doesn't).  Now I know the creator of the channel had to do this just to get more views on this video which makes sense, but playing with minds of so many people is, i don't know, i don't think that's cool.
Eating no meat is better for the environment, better for our health (less cardiovascular diseases, etc), and better for animals that actually do feel pain. But I think, cultured meat will become the better alternative in a few years, and that will be the end of conventional harmful meat. If you can have meat that is completely identical to animal meat and therefore tastes exactly the same, but has less antibiotics and other drugs in it, why not eat it instead. Cultured meat is also better for the environment because it uses up far less ressources.
I swear the thumbnail was different  when this was posted, or was it just me?
In a Kurzgesagt video 2 months ago, they showed that if every individual lowered their carbon emissions, it would make only about a 1-3% change. The emissions produced by industry far outweigh those produced by individuals so much, that even if all 7 billion of us made a change, we'd have virtually no impact. So, environmentalists need to stop preaching to us, and work on changing industry more.
Short answer: YES Long anser: Y E S!
I am noticing , your video's  topics are now quiet boring. I suggest to try more  fruitful topic like metaverse,  is there god ? Etc..
Wait... why did the thumbnail change?
feeding my cows in minecraft as this video plays in the background
i love how the thumbnail changed from being "Meat Love" to a hell's wasteland. good video nontherless
Popular science is trash. All they talk about are safe topics.
0:04 you underestimate my power kurzgesagt
Q: _"Is Meat Really that Bad?"_ A: No, It is delicious.
Omg, they just changed the thumbnail, from the lovely cow, to hell cow
Eat chicken, do less pollution. We can't remove our craving for mean that we had for 1000s of years. But we can eat chicken, it's carbon footprint can even be compared to many vegetables.
Probabaly not
only real ones were here for the original thumbnail
lamb and fish are too expensive where I live, I don't like the taste of pork and other animals, so I'm stuck with chicken and beef. but i include lentils, chick peas and beans as much as I can.
Yes.   The effect the meat industry has on our planet next to the abject cruelty it subjects to billions of animals makes buying and eating meat, especially the amount we do in the developed countries, bad. Also a lot of meat like red meat is not very good for you. People aren’t eating enough plant based food for a healthy diet anyway.
So if we want to keep eating beef, the best bet is to use land with nothing on it that can't be used for plant-based food, give cows a better diet, and buy local. But that cow food needs to come from somewhere and the cows need land to stand around on.  Cloned meat seems to be where meat will need to come from in the future for it to be sustainable.
Me who only eats chicken *laughs in not being in controversy because I eat chicken*
Thank you for not making another Corona or illness themed video.
I liked the previous thumbnail, but this one fits better for the video.  I'd like a desktop image of the cow with heart eyes, (without text) for my background.  It's cute.
i want an honest answer, are we going to die if we exhaust the carbon budget?
I eat beef sparingly, mainly because of cash flow issues and a vague awareness that it's a carcinogen. Chicken, however, I'd eat every day when cash flow allows.
Genesis 1:26 KJV And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
Don't try and act sneaky, we saw you change the thumbnail.
After seeing this..I feel a bit better as chicken eater 😂, fuck beef
what about seafood?
Tay
Give me the happy cow back. You can't just take that away from me.
Does this apply to fish? Would fish farming be more efficient?
Some meat is a good diet
*Before : "Meat Love"* *After : "Meat Hate"*
Time to eat bugs, USA and Europe
Who was here when the thumbnail said "Meat Love" before "Meat Hate" ?
Ignore and disengage with all youtubers and tiktokers who make wagyu content, they are a cancer
But tf do we do about the existing farm animals if everyone goes vegan?
Climate change primarily impacts developing countries and the poor. And I don't believe in sacrificing what makes me happy, even if it's for the good of third world countries.
oh my the thumbnail changed
They changed the thumbnail!
I'm sorry but transporting 1kg of mass no matter if it's avocadoes or beef requires exactly the SAME energy. That's physics.
Interestingly enough, the average first world citizen eats 2 to 3 times more meat than is nutritionally valuable or recommended. Even by eating the proper nutritional values of meat we would reduce our footprint by 2 to 3 times without giving up the valuable collagen, amino acids etc from meat. Meat offers essentially elements to our diet that lead to our brain developing further than that of our ancestors.. typically it isn't the meat itself that is cancerous per say, but the things stored in the fat of the animals that was fed to them (think growth hormones and a sedentary lifestyle.) Most studies of the health effects of meat don't properly differentiate between the quality of the meats or the preparation of them even though those uncontrolled variables can have a massive nutritional impact. There is so much gray area involved in reducing carbon footprint in nearly every way. Even outside of food.
did anyone notised the dumbnail changed?
Did change the name and thumbnail?
Lol, your thumbnails get more and more hardcore! ^^ Great video as always!
Tofu sucks lol
The thumbnail changed. It was a cow with heart eyes before with wiggly ears.
The amount of propaganda in the comments is astonishing.
EAT DA BUGS
man, fuck cafos. Nothing justifies putting any creature through that.
Can someone explain this data to me? I'm not sure if it's saying that on-land local transport is just flatly worse than ocean transport, or that on-land local transport for meat specifically is worse than the same transport of vegetables/grains.  Here's the timestamp: 4:36
Personally I would just eat beef because since it’s muscle, It’s been said it can get ya more muscle if u eat, beef,pork,chicken and etc that is real meat
Kurzgesagt let a little bias through 3:50. Exampling avacado as good and beef as bad, when it's transport vs transport. Also leaving out that that avacado will still be transported via truck to the local store. It's not like groceries are directly attached to ports.
Oh hey they changed the thumbnail
meat is not that bad if you eat every bit of it including chicken claws and pork trotters, so how about stop wasting the food to start with
Oshit the thumbnail 😧
we're so thoroughly fucked.. :(
It’s all well a good if you spend most your day sitting down and weight 150lbs but the rest of us would spend 12 hours a day eating veg/carbs and probably end off atrophying down to an emaciated pile of bones.  And isn’t the reasons cows fart so much methane is because they are eating grass? What happens when humans all start eating veg? I bet that wasn’t accounted for.  I like to know the true P-value on all the research published as I suspect most research is carried out by vegetarians and vegan researches with a bias towards the data used.
you forgot that it's closed system, it's not methane that magically gets created from nothing. It's part of a cycle.
Yo the picture change
What about sex?
Cow eat grass. Cow burps and shit. Grass eats shit and burps (methane ->co2). Cow eat grass. No new co2 is added to the atmosphere. The studies they used have things such as "manure management" and farting cows as measurement of emissions, but once again no new co2 has been added. They also used the study that didn't include waste in the video (but had it in the sources) and ask yourself this: what food products do you throw in the garbage bin the most? By a large margin vegetables and grain products are thrown and while they rot away methane is released. Cows can eat all the byproducts of vegetables. If you grow soybeans for example you are also left with the stalk, leaves and what not. That is used as feed and can't be eaten by humans, the soybean (the actual bean) feed for animals is all a byproduct left from extracting the oil from it. Lastly chemical fertilizers actually use fossil fuels (natural gas) to produce it. Meaning new co2 added to the atmosphere.
if you cut meat out of your diet, you didn't do much, actually - it's just another slab of meat that won't get sold and will just instead be thrown away and wasted on nothing. people seem to not realize that not eating meat does NOT mean less animal death or meat production - they will always produce the same amount of meat or only go up in meat production. people need to stop putting so much pressure on other individuals and instead try to hold the industry itself accountable. same with emissions overall - politics have been trying to make individuals bad for trying to live their lives as normally as possible instead of reducing factory emissions or closing down environmentally destructive factories.  another big factor people don't seem to take into account much is the dietary value of meat. without meat i assure you literally all of us will be suffering from various deficiencies. unless you want all people on the planet to have to chug supplements daily, that is - which aren't too healthy especially in the long term, aren't a replacement for getting the nutrients yourself, and are expensive. not to mention the strain it'd put on the pharmaceutics industry, which is also SUPER not good for the environment, and also directly poisons us because pharmaceutical companies most often dump drugs and waste products in water. yeah. the industry is responsible for a huge amount of water pollution.  i love kurzgesagt, and i usually love all of their videos, but this isn't it. it's not that i feel "attacked" as a meat eater - sorry, but i'll keep eating meat regardless. what i dislike is how it showed barely any arguments *for* meat consumption, making this a video with unbalanced arguments, although i understand that this as a video was meant to mostly cover the negative impacts of beef.
"change the thumbnail"  "Ok"
W-w-wait wasn’t this “Meat Love” yesterday?
Please add Indonesia subtittle...
The tittle be like: "top 10 pointless decision that always make you wrong"
the thing that boggles my mind the most, is how female cows have horns
Assumption of many facts not supported by evidence. Typical of the global warming bunch.
Too poor to afford beef anyway, poor people eat chicken.
4:40 In this whole section, i think you might forgot one thing, and is that not a lot of us are living near the ship ports, where the cargo ships arrive. So even if we buy locally or from far away we still get those CO2 emissions from the land transportation from the ports to our home. We have to think about these two scenarios and determine which one is more harmful
Wasn't the video titled meat love?
Eu gosto de churrasco
What happen to miniature 🤣🤣
Send this to the vegan teacher. She’ll love it.
What happened to the thumbnail
8:49 this sounds weird
The argument that meat grown in factory farms has a lower carbon footprint is misleading. This is only true in specific cases. The argument also leaves out a discussion about a lot of other threats from factory farming like antimicrobial resistance, higher agro chemical footprint and ecosystem damage. Talk to people who live near a factory farm to know more.
Thanks for the wake up call, I was starting to think it didn't matter that much if I started eating beef again
but what an embarrassing way to appear in the video as a Brazilian, Brazil is amazing and has a wonderful nature, but unfortunately we have a dumb president who likes to destroy the environment
The problem is not meat or veg, the problem is us, Thanos was right, this is a overpopulation problem.
Lol the rebrand of the video made me want to watch it, good job
MMMMMM, so according to your numbers, saving 800 billions tons of CO2 if we all were vegans compares to the 50 billions tons we emit, means that we ONLY need to reduce our meat consumption by 1/16th !    Also, if we could recuperate that much land and sequester this carbon in forests and grasslands, then logically, we could feed some been on those "new" grasslands !   So again, we dont need everyone to be vegan then.  In fact, only 1/16th of world population would need to be.  Which is only 500M people worldwide !   Or rather, 500M MORE people should be vegan since there are probably more than that who are de facto vegan, or eat so little meat, and no cattle, that its functionally similar.   Im surprised you did not calculate to the end after you started, its not like you.  What happened?   The vegan lobby tugged at your heartstrings?   Your vegan girlfriend put pressure on you? :-)
"Beef stonks" I died there
They swapped the thumbnail
why change your thumbnail
I'm going to go start a FB war on a Vegan vs. meat eater group.... and watch them tear one another apart :D Thanks @kurzgesagt!!
the ultimate sequel
I eat meat maybe two times a month, and don't mind paying a lot for it. If we could only have grass-fed animals, and have way less meat, that sounds fine to me. The typical American family, driving demand by buying crazy amounts of ground beef and gallons of milk each week is the main problem. And the fact that they can afford it. Just make it unaffordable.
Wow, they changed the thumbnail into a mad cow now. It's actually very scary.
I'm vegan but I'm not getting any meat
Beef stonks
"Most the carbon emmisions are released directly by the animals"  The Insane people against climate VERSUS The insane Vegans
Who else clicked after they changed the thumbnail? xD
The answer is no. In fact meat is the best thing for you
however, it s worth noting that methane is a combustible. so, having methane would not necessarly be a bad thing if we had ways to capture it efficiently. (as combustible is always something usefull as an energy source)
Wait at first it was meat love now hate? What’s next meat confusion then meat spirit
Well… it’s complicated
Thumbnail has been changed?
The dumbest part is that pigs don't need feed, cities could sell biowaste freeing up landfills and the pigs wouldn't care.
I think the people that animat this drink too many dipressos
That vegan teacher is fuming at the title
I bought a calendar from y'all in 2020 and still haven't received it :/
Did the thumbnail change?
Derr too many Earthlings
The thing about cows is that they are not just used for beef. In the video it was mentioned that dairy cows are used also for milk but there are many other parts of the cow that are used, such as its skin for leather or fat (tallow) that is used in antifreeze and hydraulic break fluid. Pretty much the whole cow is used. I find that a lot of climate change videos forget this and make the claim that a cow has a huge footprint for this one use case. I went into a coffee shop the other day that was trying to promote the use of non-dairy kinds of milk (oat and almond) and they used similar data showing a cow's large environmental impact and why you should try oat milk but they failed to also mention a cow's other uses such as for beef. I understand it can get complicated but I rarely see an argument where the individual breaks down all of the uses for a cow and then weighs all of those benefits to its environmental footprint.
That was a 180 thumbnail switch
5:15 meeethan?? 5:22 controphiversiy??? am I only now noticing this in the years I've watched this channel??
FOOD IS FOOD
Brother video make in hindi your very  big viewer in india
Reduce the human population to 2 or 3 billion and most of the problems disappear.
Green house gases are mostly from cows’ farts.🌝🌚
cows are too stinky stop eating them
eat mor chiken
Being a Vegan.. this Video made me feel so much better about my choices..
Chicken feed is also made up of rendered animals, specifically cows. So they don’t have to rely completely on feed crops, thereby reducing the amount of crops needed to feed them.
I noticed you changed your thumbnail image from “Meat Love” to “Meat Hate.” What was reason for the change and what did your analytics tell you about the difference in response between the two approaches?
Good direction breaking much of this down, though your presentations on various things could still use some ironing out. While intercontinental shipping 'is' of minimal comparative impact at scale, the final trips from the docks to being divvied up amongst stores should make it less a statement of 'this is better than local' and moreso 'total distance has minimal impact on carbon emissions overall'. Going off a good handful of the comments, a lot of people seem to have missed much of the direction you were making in your broader points, somehow getting 'kill them evil cows' out of 'we need to downscale and this is our example for the sake of demonstration'.
even if all the climate change predictions are true what about the effect of a meat free diet on peoples health, despite what vegetarians claim humans are clearly not made to be vegetarian we dont have a digestive system specialized for plants, what actually happens when you scare people into not eating meat is they eat more bread and get fat, if you want to talk about a crisis obesity in america is far more of a pressing problem then climate change (assuming the CC predictions even come true)
lets be honest, the original thumbnail is the opposite of the new one
Meat isn't bad at all. It's vegans that are bad.
So, what hapoended to the original thumbnail
I just thought of the possiblity of the world becoming a dystopia in order to solve the climate crisis. Hope it doesn't come to that.
Beef is by far, the most dangerous thing we can produce. Hindus were millennias ahead of everyone ahead when abstaining from beef.
I’ll answer: yes Okay next Q
After some thought I've decided that I don't care I'll be dead before the earth starts falling apart so it's not my problem  I'm just to greedy
Informative video
Youtube should at least make the dislike optional or let de creator make a poll.
..Was it just me, or did the thumbnail change from “Meat Love” to “Meat Hate”?
omg new vid again oh it just the thumbnail
I read this as "Is Meth really that bad?"
Did the thumbnail change?
is the thumbnail change???
The thumbnale change
is storage included in these numbers as well? having to keep meat frozen or refrigerated?
Am I crazy or did this used to have a different thumbnail a day or two ago (happy-cow with heart eyes)?
Why did the Thumbnail change? Admittedly it looks a little scary.
Hello people of Kurzgesast, could you guys please make a video about the great attractor? I think it could be a very  interesting topic  to learn, animate, and narrate   thank you for your time
“The vegan was too stunned to speak”
There was another thumbnail and title, no?
Are I crazy or did they change the the thumbnail?
Humanity killed by cow farts?
Considering the most strict vegans usually get hospitalized due to pernicious anemia thanks to vitamin B12 deficiency, I'd say it's a pretty nuanced ideology if you don't know what you are doing.
The problem with this analysis is it requires the extremely suspect catastrophic warming models from climate alarmists to be accurate. Which they're most certainly not.  There's the additional problem that a meat based diet is much healthier than a plant based one. In fact, without supplementation, it is impossible to get all essential nutrients solely from a plant based diet.
Wasnt the icon different yesterday?
That thumbnail really went a different direction 😂
Dans deux vidéos précédentes vous avez parlé de la matière exotique et la matière étrange pouvez vous faire un vidéo sur les matières qui existent dans l'univers avec un sous-titre français
The biggest problem is overpopulation. Most global problems can be linked to it.
Agriculture videos like this present information in a way that is both informative and also somewhat misleading.  Total emissions is only half the story.   Net emissions is what's important.    Cows cannot emit more carbon than they consume from plants.  Cattle are 100% made of carbon from the atmosphere.  Therefore, the net contribution of all living things, cows included, is zero over time.  Carbon is a cycle.  A lot of carbon exists in long-term storage underground, which we humans drill or till up and put back in the atmosphere.  This causes a net increase in atmospheric carbon levels, which is considered a contributing factor to global warming.    If carbon reduction is our goal, then we should focus first on controlling the processes which introduce carbon from long-term storage into the atmospheric cycle, not the systems which simply recycle that carbon.    Ruminants have been an important part of the lifecycle of grasslands for eons, and their presence is quite beneficial for the land.  When combined with no-till practice and intensive grazing, ruminants stimulate plant growth which creates a net carbon sink into long-term storage in the soil.   Recommendations to achieve our carbon reduction goal: 1. Consume less energy and resources overall 2. Transition to renewable or nuclear energy sources 3. Adopt sustainable agricultural practices, including no-till and intensive ruminant grazing
Also if all of that food was not fed to the livestock, it could provide enough of food to humans multiple times over. And this did not even touch upon ethics and health questions, which are other 2/3rds of the whole picture.
Still gonna eat meat, no one can stop me
Did the thumbnail change?? ,':^\
I am so glad to see it pointed out that factory farming leaves a smaller carbon footprint. It frustrates me to no end to see all of these companies and advertising campaigns for eating free range meat be bought as being the best option by so many people. If you care about the fact that the animals you are slaughtering to eat are given a better quality life then you should reassess your priorities, because if you really care about the animals you wouldn’t be killing them in the first place. And if you care about the environment or your wallet you won’t by that free range stuff.
They changed the thumbnail
Pleas help on this. I’m really trying hard to understand but There is something that I’m still missing. The video is saying that food transportation from farm to ships and then to land in another continent and then to market is more efficient than a local truck delivering from farm to market ? Is just that in head this seams illogic Please helm me understand
No. Next question please.
Funny how you leave out the fact that the feed is inedible to humans.
2:59 🤔➕➖➗✖
YES
Why did the thumbnail change
Humans evolved to be omnivores.  You can't change that in time to make a dent in climate change.  There is already enough global warming baked in to collapse our civilization.  If everyone stopped eating meat today and we covered the entire planet in trees it wouldn't put a dent in what we're facing because of what is already baked in.
bEeF sToNkS
You also have to account water usage which animal products are higher on as well.
They changed the thumbnail and bam, it's at 3m views compared to the 1m prior of when I first saw it on my feed. Science in Art of clicking on a video.
🥩🥩
yes. NEXT!
wasnt the thumbnail something completely different like a while ago??
>mfw thumbnail change
NO!
I love beef, actually just had some for lunch.  I like when this topic is discussed with solid facts and not only people screming MEAT IS DEATH and throw stuff at you  while at a restaurant. It is important to at least reduce the level of meat each one of us consume and try some alternatives lile chiken, fish and some green for more than twice a week.  If there's a point we need to address is how easy and cheap is to consume meat and other trash meals instead of a healty diet that for many is just out of budget.
I rather abandon capitalism than eating meat to slow down climate change
Which vegan group paid you to make such one sided video?
4:50 but it still has to get to the store. it still has to go through low distance shipping. therefore it will ALSO do the truck and car parts. yall rly failed on that one
Where is the Meat love video?  The first thumbnail was a happy cow and the video was titled meat love?  You guys playing the algorhythem?
sorry but im never going soy. rather burn the planet than turn weak like all you vegan soyboys
But methane is part of the carbon cycle.  Cows don’t create CO2, they get it from the grass etc, which gets it from the atmosphere. Cows aren’t adding more CO2 to the system.  Full discloser: I don’t eat beef or seafood because beef uses too much water and is linked to heart disease, and seafood consumption is destroying the oceans (where most of our oxygen is created). Both beef and seafood is also just dirty in general
Cougars running on electric energy,  well I'll be damned.
Skip meat every other day. Done.
GG for the 17M subscribers!
uhm... you missed something though. On those crops, we humans only eat parts of it, the rest goes to animals. So, the comparison should be on the eatable parts for humans and not the entire plant.
You've changed the thumbnail, don't think I didn't see it
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old."  Kurzgesagt has never been more wrong...
So how does meat stack up against growing a soy crop? How would a soy based product stack up against a meat based product in carbon, fuel and time?
So what's the alternative? We know that switching protein to plant base is unhealthy.. sooo..?
@ time 6:50. There is an important difference to make here. If cattle are rased on a polyculture and are cycled through the grazing area they can distribute the waist evenly through and area. The relationships between a variety of plants and microbes in the soil pull the carbon that would be released into the atmosphere into the soil.  "Kiss The Dirt" is a documentary on Netflix that was very interesting.
The thumbnail changed quite a bit
The answer to climate change could be Mars , like making food on mars if that could be possible.
I'd love to see kurzgesagt make a history Channel discussing events and big what if's on events
New image
If you’re looking for a sign to go vegan, this is it. You can do it. I believe in you.
Its so cool how they changed the thumb nail!
Didn’t you have a totally different thumbnail yesterday?
Vegetables give my family horrible symptoms. I wish people were aware that that can happen to people.
No, better not to eat at all then eat big corporations and meet not form nature.  Don't eat meat if you don't want to.
lol they changed the thumb
I didn't think this was about climate by the title
To farm avacados is the most damaging product ever..  To be profitable they need to farm hundreds of acres...  The amount of creatures killed by intensive farming is beyond belief.... This video is totally bias......
You know not everyone who's meant to eat meat, sometimes they don't ate meat, especially the Muslims. The reason why Muslims don't eat pork and meat is because it's forbidden or prohibited in Islam, it was written in Quran. I know it's hard for you to learn Arabic, but still, you can translate that in any language you talk, especially English.
Not bad but like really overrated
Kurzgesagt: Changes thumbnail me: *visible confusion*
Why’d to name change from meat love to meat hate
everyone on earth should watch this video
Vegans are just hypocrites.
My man went from meat love to meat hate in his thumbnails not even  a week
Everyone in the comments waiting for that vegan teacher to come after kurzgesagt
Did the thumbnail for this change or is that my brain tricking me?
For what I understand "not all carbon emission are the same". because burning a tree release the carbon that the tree captured about his life let say 100 years (for none primal forest) while burning fuel release carbon that took millions of years to capture. what matters is actually the one that takes longueur to be captured, since it's adding to the balance of short life circle carbon
The thumbnail changed... where is holy cow?
Great video! I cut out meat 5 months ago and I can’t ever imagine going back. Every day I learn something that reaffirms that decision. We can all do our part for the environment but large companies and governments can do even more if we focus attention on them. Like for one example cruise lines and casinos and buffets dispose of ungodly amounts of badly sourced food. Vegetables and grains are not expensive for us or the environment
The fact that animals are owned and killed as they are is wrong, simple as that. Hate it to be honest. They should figure out how to perfect their lab grown meat. I’m not a vegan as I eat it but if I had to choose I would go without animals been hurt.  I am such an animal lover thats why.
Thanks for the nutshell, nothing matters the end is near. Do and eat what you want :D
Yo what's up with the thumbnail change lmao
i have a question what are the posters made of in your store?
You may want to add another point, that is that much of crops would be actually going to waste if it wasn't fed to the animals, since much of it is not edible for us humans. So it would go to waste potentially producing part of that CO2 anyway
Why did the thumbnail change?
Kurzgesagt really wrote this 0:05 knowing full well how many people are going to write masturbation jokes down in the comments. That's true bravery.
I am proud to be a meat eater. Meat is the best food evaaaah and haters gonna hate it. Especially from grass feed human.
Me: Ask Kurzgesagt about any topic Kurzgesagt's stance on everything: "It's complicated" 😂 Me: You are so knowledgeable 🤩
Excellent video as always.  Now I'm very well informed about the meat I will continue eating (until we have lab-grown meat, please make it a commercially available thing)
I can't wait to eat nutrient paste made from bugs and ride share electric vehicles to and from my closet sized apartment.
Im going vegetarian
thumbnail really went from 😁 to 😒
YouTube looks like a shitty free trial app without the dislikes. We need them back especially for subjects like this!
I love how the cover changed
So sad the last thing people consider and talk about is the fact these are sentient animals
"You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information." Okay. Cry. I have decided to cry.
That's nice. Don't care Gunna eat steak regardless.
800 billion tonnes over 100 years.  So less than 20% of what we emit over that time?
What's with the thumbnail change? Went from cattle with hearts in it's eyes to a demon possessed cow?
The best way to reduce meat consumption is to have fewer children.
Whatever. I continue to eat beef around once a week because it's tasty
if I eat only chicken, how much am I contributing for less emitions? Comparing with a beef diet for the same amount of protein
Now I want a burger 😆
So the policy suggestion is to ban beef.
I happy to pay for that content.
Meat should be reserved for the rich.
Did you change the thumbnail? I think you changed the thumbnail. Cool.
USA is no the rest of the world.
They changed the thumbnail!
Why did the thumbnail got angry
I think lab grown is how it's gonna go, with normal beef being a higher end option
Hey make a video about the carbon capture technology if you can. They currently built one in Iceland
Hey! They changed the picture of the video.
When you click on the video because thumbnail and title changed and wanted to make sure it's still the same video
Lab grown meat and until then everyone should just cut back on meat specifically red meat anyways. Healthier and also there are still tasty alternatives
Stop using oil and coal for energy production, switch to renewables and nuclear so we can have our god damn burguers. Or better yet, get them beef DNA, stuff it in a magical protein/fat VAT so we can have cruelty-free, burguers
Please, could you guys someday talk about the impact of food packaging? it's terrifying to think all this info doesn't even consider water and other resources used on the package making... (and geez, amazing how the videos only get better and better, huh?)
Thumbnail went from  ✨❤️🐄 💖✨            to 🔥 ❤️‍🔥🐄❤️‍🔥🔥
Meat is fine, once a week, no hormones or antibiotics pretty please tho
Loved the video! I think it's important to point out that *reducing* meat intake is an option. I loved that it brought up the impact of just removing beef rather than all meat as an option. It doesn't have to be a 1-0 decision, meat or no meat, and viewing it as 1-0 might discourage people from making a change.
Is it me or did the thumbnail change?? I thought it said "love meat"
And why in the intro the monkey is eating a cow😂😂
More awesome stuff!
Welp…..we are screwed. A good steak is one of those things that make life worth living.
why did u change the thumbnail?
That is a terrifying thumbnail photo
Why did the thumbnail change?
You changed the thumbnail from a happy cow to a demon one, why?
Dude we are just gonna die
Correct title: ''How to choose your diet according to co2 emissions''...very disappointed
Stonks
I couldn't live in a world without food. :P
Become vegan because animals’ lives are their own. We are not entitled to the exploitation and violation of their bodies. Choosing meat, dairy, and animal products is choosing violence.  I’d be vegan even if it were the worst diet for the climate. It just happens to be the best, oops.
2:46 "A kilogram of beef will keep you alive much longer than a kilogram of potatoes". Can someone explain why this is and what foods are best per kilogram in terms of 'keeping you alive much longer?
Should climate effects of producing beef be priced in? I think so. A burger should cost $50. It's something that should only be consumed a few times a year on special occasion
You fail to address the elephant in the room.  Food emissions are a problem even in the best of possible worlds because there are too many of us. The Earth cannot sustain 7 billion people, let alone the 11 that are forseen by 2100
After watching this and taking into account the morals behind animal killing and the suffering there can only be an answer. And we should all achieve that goal at our own pace. May we have a better future.
There is more to food than just the co2-emmissions. What about ecological diversety? Why are there programs where they let cows grace fields and have volunteers an masse use scythes to farm fields if the meat was soo bad? Meat has a heavy co2 footprint but it has a place in the ecosystem of which humans are a part of. And also the 1 example of actual difference between grassfed and non grassfed was from the usa. Our biosphere is diverse, not everything is as in the U S of A.
Lab Grown Meat is the future to save the Earth!
ok but if we dont eat the cows then they live and fart more so you can't just go back now
Growing meat in the lab may be a solution to the greenhouse gases problem. Let's hope it will taste good after years of research.  Lots of effort is being carried on nowadays, and I'd love to see a video about that here.
Cattle meat, Beef, in every form increases the incidence of Heart attack and stroke causing the premature death in a high percentage of population below the age of 65.
Animal welfare alone should be reason enough to go meat-free in your diet.
Basically, we're too many people.
Wait why did the thumbnail change too an evil cow?
With this information I choose to go vegan. Whole food, plant based to be healthy, but the odd vegan burger/pizza here and there won’t hurt. Good info, let’s all do our part.
I was gonna make a joke about cow genocide, but I feel like it would be in poor taste.
THUMBNAIL CHANGED
LMAO  Farm animals eat SOY .. so much for the soyboy thoerys lolololol
LOL How about we talk about fishing and the ocean Oh what a can of worms that is aahaaaaa.
Really a wonderful video. What about fish protein ? How good of a choice is it ? How does it compare to other sources of meat in terms of emissions and nutritional values ?
Fish is meat too....  and Venison....Corrtisol (stress chemical) vibrates at a low frequency,  so consuming stressed meat means we in turn vibrate low (depression anxiety)
they change the thumbnail today
Why dos you change the thumb kurz?
I didn't realise that avocados were grown on the ships and then eaten on the ships as there is absolutely no transport or distribution too and from the monoculture landmasses to the countrywide supermarkets halfway across the world.
Solution. Eet humans. Dead ones would be optimal.
Giving up meat feels difficult because most of us have been eating it since before we can remember, and it's so culturally engrained, we often have a personal attachment to it. Before I gave it up I think my key self-justification was "I disapprove of animal cruelty; I only condone ethical meat," and cognitive dissonance allowed me to believe that although factory-farmed meat was out there, it couldn't be the stuff I was buying. But it was, obviously - because almost all of it is.
10:15  This is the only correct way to go about this, people deciding for themselves. We can present the information, but using force violates freedom by definition. If you want a distopian society, look at all the things done "for the greater good" in WWII germany.
I love how in the comments no-one mentions they'll lower their meat intake. Let's talk about production value  and lab grown meat instead!  Go vegan, if not for the animals, than at least stop eating animals for the planet!
Thumbnail reversal moment
Something I've not seen addressed -- "All cows burp and emit methane." But suppose there were no cows? Would the wild population of deer and buffalo merely fill in the gap and produce a similar amount of methane? Will we be encouraged to limit the wildlife population to limit the emissions from them?  If cows are bad, but deer and buffalo are okay, why not hunt and harvest those deer and buffalo for human consumption? After all, they are an excellent method of converting forest and grassland into something we can use. And if that makes sense, why not replace them with a species of animal that we can breed for greater efficiency; namely, the cow?
Meat rules! BItchezzzz!!!
Right now, this video has 7.4K dislikes. How do I know? Download the extention :)
I feel quite uncomfortable with the debate mainly focused on climate. Of course this is a very important part of why industrial animal farming is problematic. But I believe that the animal suffering factor is even more important than this. So even if chicken for example was not producing any CO2 there would still be the vast number of terrible chicken lives that make consuming meat problematic. I'd love to see a video on the science of animal suffering and how bad the meat industry is treating animals!
Brazil again 😢.
No
This thumbnail is more unstable than Uranium 235.
Why climate? The thing to consider is the amount of suffering this brings.
Earth's population must decrease, our spendings must decrease, and the amount of food we eat should decrease.   Fat Acceptance is a problem because the more obese people are, the more they eat, the bigger the problem, and the more overweight people there is, the more of fast food and beef will be produced.  And the more we buy, the greedier people will become.  I'm 30 and i feel like I'm gonna live enough to witness a huge shift in our daily lives for the worse, but no matter if 1 country commits to improve those aspects, there will always be other governments that don't give a F and their people will continue striving towards worse health and environmental conditions.  I'm from Costa Rica, where most animals are grass fed, but I'm worried for the world because we as a race are about to cap our planet's resources. There's nowhere else to go, also, the biggest offenders in "climate change" are never pointed out.
Some people are scared of the vegan discourse because it allows us to question their habits and the things they take for granted.  Taking things for granted and not questioning them is and has been an important cause of suffering in the world. Don't be a coward in life, ask the hard questions. Don't let the people who built their wealth on suffering keep winning.
Good information! And this isn't even taking into account the ethical argument. How can we justify inflicting suffering and death upon innocent animals when we have alternatives? Is needless violence ever right?
Damn, right about now i would love to see dislikes
watching this while eating a burger... I feel guilty now
Meat is good Until it wasn't
Very very great video. Honestly. But even me who I usually understand easily your videos without having to stop to understand what's just been said, have found it hard to comprehend what was being said in a couple of times, maybe too many numbers and not enough time to process them sometimes? do no take me wrong, scientific accuracy is fantastic and this channel would not be as great, by far, without it. But perhaps dosing it correctly would help. great video!
This channel teaches me more than my whole college and university years
Did the video title and preview change from "Meat Love" to "Meat Hate"?
Wait  The title changed and thumbnail from "meat love" to "meat hate". Wtf Kurzgesagt, you feeling good m8 ?  Edit: yea i didnt went crazy, on theirs instagram and Twitter you can check out Old thumbnail and the title was "Is Meat REALLY Bad For The Climate?"
I saw this when it was just released and the thumbnail used to to be “meat love” instead of meat hate
This has become a religion at this point (climate / political doctrines), now we are even demonizing locally sourced and passing over that with the right methods you can recover and completely offset the emissions from beef.... but real sustainability is just overlooked because of how harmonious it is.... nothing to divide people with... nothing to cause hatred and hysteria.  I only see this agenda going one way, the othering of the "peasants" that are supposedly ruining everything for a vapid, self obsessed middle and upper class following their new religion.
The thumbnail is changed :0
The "demonized cow" yak at 6:56 is neat the way he's perched on the rock, lightning flashing in the background. Looks sinister, but is only yak🐃
need to build a barier between animals and the world and vualla no more animal fart co2 emmissions
Good thing I hate beef.
I remember when the thumbnail was a cow with love eyes
Is it my imagination or did you change the title form “meat love” to “meat hate”
Nice. They made a whole video so then can use the Stonks meme.
You have forgotten to tell all morons how grass is unhealthy for humans and why we started eat meet at first place 😂  Edit for all morons who think about joke up there as a statement xd:   Yep vegans doesn't eat grass. Yep you can eat vegetables and fruits it healthy and needed food,just not ultimate. But try stay alive working physycly in hard conditions only eating green. Same with work outs at gym. You can't. You would need to eat whole day as cow and probably has special digestive system as well. And eating only green staff causes week bones, hormonal unstable, lack of few amino acids and low heigh. Fun fact: you brain weight only 3% of your total mass but eats 20% of your daily caloric demand. Development of that shit have happened only because our ancestors started eating high energetic meals with caloric surplus (not f spinach). And no, vegetarians doesn't live longer. They just live in high developed societies. Also live healthier than average MC Donald fan who eat more fat than good quality meet (and probably doesn't move what crucial, we are basically born to long distance run but this is another story). We are as species omnivorous but it doesn't mean you can choose what you want to it whole life. It means that you literally must eat all possible kinds of things to stay healthy and in top shape.
What about foods that have to be flown in? they must have very large international travel emissions.
It actually makes you live more efficiently
Love how you compare the quantity of protein between different types of food, like that what's matter. Not the quality. Also I like how you don't talk about the wasting of food and how we can prevent that so we would not waste resources and reduce the co2 emissions. Leaving that aside, it's a good video.
Science could give us the answer! No, Soylent is the wrong answer. Yes I understand the math...
Didn’t mention food waste. Which is disproportionately skewed to fresh fruits and vegetables but also dairy products.  This isn’t mentioning the things left out from not eating meat. Omega3(ALA has a very low conversation), zinc, B12(since we don’t have our own bacteria), vitamin A, collagen. The switch from saturated fat to unsaturated fats that we have never eaten so much of in our history before 1920. Vegetarian mostly become carb monsters. Carbs and sugar are the problem for diabetics. One vegetarian I talk to hair started to fall out, she ate a lot of tofu, but that has a lot of calcium which needs to be chelated. Aunts sister was vegetarianish, ate very little meat, but didn’t eat enough protein. Her heart suffered, doctor couldn’t do anything it was to late, she did everything she ‘supposed to’. Heart takes 15 years to replace all the cells. A lot of YouTube Vegans started to eat meat again after about 10 years, as they were having tons health problems.   I can see 1 or 2 days without, but to be vegan for me is never ever going to happen. That’s not to say my own personal dietary requirements, of minor wheat allergy, rice puts me in a sugar coma, so potatoes it is plus that sweet sweet potassium. No pork, body doesn’t seem to like it. Lot of fish, need the omega3, pills from sardines.
9:33 This comparison seems.. deceptive. 800 Billion Tonnes per 100 years -> 8 Billion Tonnes per year. If we produce ~50 Billion Tonnes per year, that still puts us at a 42 Billion Tonnes per year deficit.
Wait wtf happened to the thumbnail
Suggestion: What happens if a black hole has nothing to suck in somehow. Its fine if you dont i really want to know what happens
But isn't much of the food we feed to animals mostly unsutable for human consumption? The maize they eat would likely be disguarded if they did not eat it?
What would happen to all the farm animals if we stopped eating them how would they be dealt with? Also, if the rest of the world was to switch to plant based food, how much farm land would need to be changed to accommodate to increase in demand?
I swear he changed the thumbnail
AmericaS???
I usually love your video . But the videos on non veg food is really disturbing . You calcute the methane , energy consumption while they are alive . Which doesn't sound right . According to you we should kill all the animals which are not necessary And save our energy consumption .   Please don't make videos like this you sound so cruel .
Im already not using plastic straws. So leave mah meat alone.
honestly, meat substitutes are getting so advanced (and honestly similar to meat) that im totally willing to go vegetarian if it gets cheaper.
Um....wasn't there a vid released a day or so ago labeled "Meat Love"??
Um....wasn't there a vid released a day or so ago labeled "Meat Love"??
Yes.
"no bodily pleasure is better than food" uhm... well actually i might be able to think of something better that isnt enjoyed daily but never gets old...
I feel one thing that was missed was that livestock also consume a lot of waste products from other food production lifecyles
Beef Stonks got me like:
Is meat really that bad?  Kurzgesagt: basically, yeah
shoutout to the industries that only use 4% of the soy production
This is very well-researched, the scientific papers presented are all among the most influential. Well done!
Love how the thumbnail changed
What happened to the thumbnail with meat love on it?
We have moved from meat love to meat hate the future is now
9:21 -- Let me get this straight: if _everyone_ on Earth went vegan, we'd have an additional 3 Bn ha of land that could (maybe) be used to draw down 800 Bn tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) over a hundred years. That's 8 Bn tonnes CO2e per year, vs the 50 Bn tonnes of CO2e we emit per year in total. Not as important as stopping the transfer of **geological** carbon from belowground to the atmosphere, for example.
"Anti-vaxxers are so infuriating. People should follow the science and stop being so selfish." "Our obsession with meat is fuelling the biggest existential crisis of the century and the best thing anyone can do is give it up." "No, not like that."
Scariest thumbnail change I've ever seen
This is what I call green communism. They want to limit the food you eat so they can fit more people in the earth so they can have more power. But in the end it doesn't matter what food it is there will always be a limit to how many people the earth can sustain even if they force everyone to eat the simplest food possible. And we will all end up like africa where all they have is bags of simple food that barely keeps them alive.
I think the subject needs a lot more information than this video to be seriously understood... grasslands or pastures absorb an enormous amount of  CO2.   Too much to understand in too little time.  Harry’s farm channel has some very good and easy to understand videos about beef farming and its ecological impacts , as well as some enlightening information about media stories concerning these issues...
The only thing I believe it was missing in this video, are the changes of CO2 emissions changes over time, per product. And how the efficiency increase over time.
Liked the video really good. Although it feels like they took a while to get a simple yes, however good questions were asked.
Secret sponsor : Vegans.
Can somebody get the vegan teacher watching this
The thumbnail change was pretty cool
Why thumbnail change ?
Humans are literally already making storied farms, like that are on different levels with animals on different floors
Yes
This vidio was very cute, however fails to explain what happens when we stop eating beef. no one ever bothers to realize that if we stop useing cow related products, cows in general would become an endangered species as a ferm grown cow can not survive without human care, and it costs too much money to look after a cow.  second point alot of our pet food comes from beef and poultry farms too. So dog food would sky rocket in price and people will end up putting there dogs up for adoption, however if no one adobts said pooch it is put down.  The reality is that farming beef is a major part of our econamy and is tied to alot of things we take for granted. If you want to make a change you need to accept that things you may love would vanish forever.
bruh how many times does this thumbnail change lol
Nothing but NWO bs here = green new deal = great reset. You will own nothing and be happy.
I love he changed the thumbnail to a happy cow to a evil cow
Now what you choose it’s upto you.
I haven't actually watch the video yet but why did they change the thumbnail so drastically? Went from "MEAT LOVE" to "MEAT HATE". 😂
Hum, why did the cow turn evil in the span of 2 days ?
Always good to see more videos about this. We need more education. Way too many people eat meat.
already have my calendar 2022!
Is it me or they changed the thumbnail?
Stay away from Brazil imperialists, the rainforest is our territory, we have the right to develop ourselfs and increase our population wealth. Keep off green imeprialists you are the evil in this world.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed that much a day" *chronic masterbaters look around nervously*
This Chanel loves the great reset. You should do one about income inequality instead of destroying the quality of life of hardworking people. Who give money to you guys?
I just missed mentioning the current evidence linking red meat consumption with diseases such as bowel cancer, breast cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
R*DDIT
A lot of people are forgetting that meat is an species appropriate food for humans , we’re not designed to eat seeds or grains because of harmful defence chemicals. Meat is not bad for you . Eat more meat it’s not bad for the environment or bad for you .
Are you trying to get vegean teacher to watch this.?  Nice video
So Beef in europe is ok, in the rest of the world not... thats the idea
Why they change the picture
Supporting comment. Because;)
Why the change in thumbnail?
Supporting comment. Because;)
I bet going vegan is as simple for many watching this video.  Watch Earthlings and do challenge22 with the new year.  Became aware of specisism. Meat is murder maybe a slogan but it is the truth.
I never heard the grass argument before. What a lie Great video
I hope scientists can develop cloning more, so we can clone the most perfect beef ever and just use its DNA forever
B.S.
They cahged the thumnail
The conclusion I came to after watching is that: there's nothing to be done, rather, there are a lot of things people can do. Be done = governments making it worse by trying to make it better. Can do = things people can CHOOSE to do.
All very idyllic and whatever, but humans are omnivores and not at all herbivores
Do you have beef with the beef?
Yall remember vegan teacher? Well I think we found her weakness
off topic of meat...and i know it takes weeks or months to create these videos and do research... but you should do a video on a man-made planet destroyer (whatever it may be), how it would be built, how we would even power it, and depending how large it is the affect on the atmosphere or environmental factors.
great! a reason to eat meat again.
So, I'm basically saving the planet eating pork, not cow, also a lot of other reasons poor people not polluting, from airplane travel to small houses and consuming more vegetables because they are cheap. Long-live the pork!
great! a reason to eat meat again.
What happened to the other '' meat love '' video?!
great! a reason to eat meat again.
I swear on my life that thumbnail was different... Not a cow burning but a cow with Heart Eyes
Carbon Budget? What left wing bs is that
lol chickens eat exclusively feed crops? GTFO with that BS
Overpopulation bad.   We need to understand that.
Thx for a resolution!! Recently had a talk about food emotions, transportation vs food type,  muscle tissue of animals killed in concentrative farming.
Beautifully stupid. Much love from Brazil! Hide behind the "it's science" fallacy and never put up the real data and their sources; Even less put any kind of effort to show how those many statements are measured, and the method applied to the research. I'm so sorry to tell, but bright and colourful cartoons are no real science nor fact.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old."   Speak for yourself  :^)
What happened to the old thumbnail
One thing that I find annoying is that we measure things in ‘carbon equivalency’. Let’s show the actual methane production, and maybe THEN describe how that has a more extreme effect than carbon. But the reality is that the actual carbon footprint of meat is much lower, and there’s nothing wrong with working on solving the ‘methane footprint’
Answering the question, yes.
Good video, but you need to have also called out that without cattle you wouldn't have the fertilizers that sustain mass plant agriculture and have other industrial applications that can't be synthesized.
what happened to the previous video thumbnail?
We should return to our roots and eat beef from a recent slaughtered animal only in special events, not everyday consumption. Learn to value the animal and the effort it takes to help them grow and have a heathy life
Kurzgesagt be like: 2 + 2 = 4, right? Well, it's complicated.    I'm just kidding. I love this channel. <3
Literally no one cares stop making these videos nobody is going to stop eating meat ever
I find it a bit odd how little time they spent on the beef that was low in greenhouse gas emissions. Sure it may still be higher than non meats, but if we focused on that you gain a huge benefit without not asking people to give up something they love.  To be honest though the real problem I have with anything vegetarian or vegan is that they try to copy foods that people are familiar with. If I have a vegan burger it will automatically be compared to a real burger. If companies focused on making vegan products that are novel there would be no real thing to compare it to. Easier to give up a burger when I don't have to eat a fake burger that just constantly reminds me how much I miss burgers.  Now I am sure that I could find a way to do cook vegan for myself without just taking every dish people make and making it vegan. However I not only wouldn't know where to begin, but it also would require a society level of retraining for people. It would be nice to have some vegan options at stores that are not just knock offs of the real the real thing.
Apples to oranges comparison like expected.  Let's talk about beef because its an outlier. Best beef is twice the carbon footprint of the worst veg but half that land is not tillable and half that beef is also used for dairy but we don't want to get into that. Also the protein is more legitimate than a calorie comparison but not as relevant as a fat comparison would be. Protein is easy enough to come by in a vegan diet if you ignore the phyto estrogen hormonal imbalance problems. Fat, in abundance in Western diets now, is important to child development and would become very scarce outside of tropical and arid sub tropical diets with no way to expand those climate zones. And methane gas emissions occur when plant matter decays. This cycle is sped up through digestion of livestock animals but their waste is also used to make fertilizer for commercial farming. Plant decay and the need for fertilizer would be bigger problems, not less, if there were not livestock animals 'processing' vegetation now.  All in all, not quite the paid advertisement for Bill Gates I was afraid it would be...
I'd like to critique that second sentence for it's inaccuracy
I think alot of veggie heads were upset about the last video so you were forced by them and vegetarian food companis to make a new one
Great video, but the graph at 9:32 is misleading. If both values were shown for 100 years. Humans would produce ~5,000 billion tons, and we would be removing 800 billion tons
What happened to the old thumbnail?
Wasn’t the thumbnail for this video love meat or am I trippin?
Short answer: no Long answer: begome Mongolian
A new paper by New Zealand and English scientists concludes that going meatless will only have a small impact on a person’s overall lifetime carbon footprint.  The paper, published in the Swiss-based Sustainability Journal, was written by researchers at Auckland, Massey, Victoria and Oxford universities, the New Zealand Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Centre, and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI).  It found that giving up meat would only reduce the average person’s lifetime contribution to global warming by 2 per cent to 4 per cent.  That was because long-term, the benefits in not eating meat were largely offset by the carbon dioxide created to produce alternative foods and the relatively short life of methane, farming’s key greenhouse gas.
These videos are just so great. I love everything about them.
You could have also mentioned ethics.
Lets go save the world guys eat meat still but buy localy if u can
Fuck this it’s fucking 2021
It’s sad that meat is simply a necessary part of a healthy diet for us humans.
The second lab grown meats become economically visible I am going to buy them. HOWEVER I will accept a higher price in the short term but long term I expect the price to fall due to the industrialized nature of lab grown meats, economies of scale, & the *massive* efficiency gains to be had. Lab grown meats need to be a third the cost of current meats.  However I doubt that'll happen due to how ungodly long patents are valid for & the first movers monopolies we'll see pop up in the industry. If anything they'll just charge a premium for "green meat". We need capitalism, not this government intervention BS enabling artificial monopolies to price gouge on green technologies reducing their adoption. So many cases of this happening, most notifiable with big pharma.
Why is this video calles meat hate and the german version meat love?
Humanity can't just switch into herbivores in one lifetime, Panda's evolution drove them into that dead-end and as a result the whole species is doomed.
... did... did the thumbnail and title for this video change from Meat Love to Meat Hate? Am I losing it?
The thumbnail change
Bottom line, we are supposed to eat meat. There is nothing wrong with eating meat. I do try to limit the vast majority of my meat consumption to wild game. Preferably that I have harvested myself. But I know not everyone is capable of that. Try to buy from reputable companies. Not all created equal
It will be interesting if That Vegan Teacher reacted to this
Anyone know how many cows are grass fed in the UK?
Watching this as I eat a cheese burger
rip food love title and thumbnail
One thing that doesn't make sense is the part talking about transit emissions, showing cargo ships using less which is wrong; each one using over 20,000 gallons of petroleum per hour, and then saying the meat locally sourced and sold contributes more? That doesn't add up, unfairly favorable towards plant based foods.  Using the metric, carbon per kg isn't a fair nor accurate measurement for, gas waste per weight of product of solid state matter per transportation method, i.e. trucks only weighing few tons with higher carbon ratio (fuel consumption + vehicle weight) vs ship weighing thousands of tons with it's lower ratio still far out pollutes hundreds of trucks over due to the amount of fuel it requires,  it's how you get such discrepancies and look more favorable to the ship when in reality it's not the case and why things that looks good on paper should be looked at closer.  For arguments sake of the ship, also there will be other food products, even meats will be on there with the veggies as well, so how come meats don't get any emissions reduction for being on the same ship with the plant based foods that get to them if the ship is so emission efficient?
And here we go... [After removing deslike button]
I swear on the stars in the sky the thumbnail was different yesterday or am I tripping again?
Great video - the only thing I was hoping for was information on fish.  I can do without red meat but should I feel good about eating farmed salmon all the time?
WAIT A MINUTE! WHY did u change the thumbnail from MEAT LOVE to MEAT HATE?
Does avocados magically transport them selves to the port from the plantation and then from another port to the market?
nooo it is not bad, vegans say that cause they try to manipulate with us so then we stop eating čevapčiči
I'm happy that cut my consumption of beef by about 90% easily. I avoid it as much as I can and when I eat beef, I take the time to appreciate it. It's actually so easy to eat better and smarter!
Good, good, now restore dislike bars on all extremist videos, youtube.
why is the thumbnail-  THE COW IS MAD
No matter what is said in the end. Until science can produce artificially created meat substitutes that actually taste like meat, I will still be eating meat, because there is just not anything like. And to be simply it simply taste amazing.
I'd personally be interested in hearing more about this new grown meat scientists have come up with. Not so much how it's done, but if it's actually better overall
"food never gets old" yeah, sure
*Science*: Eating beef is destroying the planet we live on *Most people*: Yeah, but I like the toy I get with my McDonalds happy meal, so...screw the planet.  *Science*: But you and your children kinda NEED a planet in order to...you know, survive! *Most people*: Can’t hear you over the sound of me chewing these yummy McRibs! Mmmmmm! Not listening, not listening!
Don’t care! Going to continue to eat meat forever!
Who wants some man meat?
What happened to “Meat Love”?
It's a shame how animals have to suffer for us. If only there was a way to eat meat without causing some sort of pain or suffering.
Question for meat eaters: If you say you believe in climate change, can you really say that when you disregard the impact of your diet? If yes, I'd love to know how thats rasionalized
Man I could have swore this had a different thumbnail yesterday.
Wait did the thumbnail change?
Love the new thumbnail
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times each day and never gets old"...Did you really just say that?
i love your  vids
So basically since we are too many, and there's a big demand of meat by basically everyone and by being meat the most expensive food- carbon emission wise- we decide it should be right to give up on eating meat altogether. All good. Except we are completely missing the point here: being too many.
short answer: yes
Hey, wasn't the thumbnail originally a smiling cow with hearts for eyes?
I don't care if the "meat" I eat came from an animal or plants if it tastes good and has protein in it. Literally all I ask is for corperations to stop killing our planet.
So the big question the video doesn't ask: if we took meat off the table as a food source, how many more animals would there be emitting more 'ahem' gas? :P  Also video: maybe we shouldn't be burning down forests...
help why the thumbnail changed
Time to have a Meating with the Steakholders and discuss.
I enjoyed a double cheeseburger while watching this video.
Murder is bad, meat is murder
That's curious, why did the picture change from a cow with love hearts to an evil cow?
Why change the giraffe
I LOVE MCDONALDS!!!! 🇺🇸🇺🇸
too many looters... fjb
Real ones remember when the video was called "Meat Love".
this video was such a rollercoaster...i was like, "meat good", "meat bad", over and over again
Free science projet lol
Easy. Yes.
Uhhh why did the thumbnail change? Hmmm...
What about the relationship between factory farms and pink lagoons/ocean dead zones?
8:59 This one is a bit misleading. Cutting the meat production won't reduce the soy by 80%. The real question is, which part drives the production (and which is simply a byproduct) ? Soy beans for human ? Or soy cake for animals ?
I have to ask, but what age group do you typically aim towards? I am 45 years old,  I consider myself fairly well learned, but I still get lots of value in entertainment and knowledge from your channel. You should all be very proud of what you have created, It is very unique.
I honestly think it's the *WAY* things are looked at that should be changed. For Example, even if we cut down on eating animals, then *US, The Humans* will be the ones producing an inappropriate amount of methane. Methane, one of the main culprits of climate change, is an inevitable by-product of the digestion of Plant matter like cellulose and such. Also, yes it is true that, pound for pound, certain kinds of nuts or legumes do have more proteins than pork or beef does... but the thing is, the meat products have MORE of the easily digestible variety of proteins. So, you gain more protein from meat, even though there's more in peanuts. Man, I love Raw carrots as a snack as much as the next guy/gal (Possibly reindeer),  but even I know that meat is a staple in the human diet. If there's problems with greenhouse gases from the meat industry, then *Why not just reduce the filthy cheap practices within the inustry, then?*  Edit: I could sum this up with? What would you rather put up with?  Global Warming, or everyone *(Including you)* having really Rancid, stinky farts constantly, all day, every day?!
"Food is one of the best parts of being alive" -- This is why IBS and IBD suck so bad.
Go vegan.
It’s not the meat. It’s the politics of meat. The lefties are green with envy because they want to eat all the grass the cows are eating?
To say that the cattle is being raised on land that can't grow things but grass then to turn around and say if we get rid of the cattle we can use the land to grow forests. Even assuming the context is that we don't include the land that can't grow anything or the fact that it wasn't reinforced in the later part seems either negligent or disingenuous.   I remember watching a video from WIL that kinda called out a previous vid here on this channel on this topic. And the questions being addressed here seems to address the questions from the WIL video.   Also noticed that the thumbnail went from "Meat Love" to "Meat Hate" using negative looking titles to rage-bait clicks perhaps hmm?
is the thumbnail and title changed of this video? Title from "Meat Love" to "Is Meat Really That Bad" ?
They stole our freedom with corona virus. Now they want to jump our food.
What impact does industrial fishing have? I heard it's a lot, was a bit surprized it wasn't mentioned here. Would be nice to see how it stacks up to beef.
It's so easy to point fingers at single elements or aspects and say they are the single thing destroying or saving the planet. I think the best point that is made in this video is that there is far more going on than we all might believe. These issues are far more complicated than polar bears or cattle.
New tumbnail looks dope
I see you changed the thumbnail
The thumbnail got changed
DISLIKE
Where did meat love go?
Quick thumbnail change
Day 1: meat love Day 2: meat hate
What if we only ate fish? I'd be lying if I said I don't feel guilt when eating meat. The whole climate/animal suffering situation lingers in the back of my head.
What did you do to lower your waste? You just make countless of videos but do you also put things into practice? What's YOUR carbon footprint?
But is it really the *meat* that's delicious, or what has been added to it during preparation?
10:10 - That look the bird gives, basically shouting at you "Go Vegan".
Fuck. Looks like the vegans are right
In a nutshell: *yes.*
Luckily I live in the Levant which is such an easy place to eat plant based food :)  Although im vegan, eating meat here is usually for special occasion or at lunch at least.  Eating meat for breakfast like europe considered to be too "heavy" and unhealthy (unlike many American and European countries).    + Middle eastern food is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good
THEY CHANGED THE THUMBNAIL THE COW IS EVIL NOW AAAA
2100 at 26% so 2040 at current rates 😭
Did they just changed the thumbnail?
Just give cows diapers to keep methane with them and then use it to heat houses 😂
after that I won't eat dinner today
solution . less ppl. more covid more dead.
@Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell video idea- how much impact causes watching YT videos via internet for the entire envoirment
Much more people would go veggy if veggy products would not be marketed towards juppies with a decent salary!  Oat milk still costs two to three times as much as cow milk...
Lets dedicate a planet to livestock then......  Maybe mars and export soil there and food......à
Yo what the thumbnail changed from love to hate
I'm still eating hamburgers.
Not a single mention of the incentivised destruction and wastage of food under capitalism?
Lentils is the way, lentils is life.
What Kurzgesagt forgot to mention is that pure steak is far healthier for us compared with the impossible "meats" that are superproceesed and increase the risk of cancer by 45% in many cases.
Who else noticed the thumbnail chaged.
Who else is here because the thumbnail changed
Why does the thumbnail keep changing?
it seems avocados are bad juju on the carbon front...
Only if you don't mind unnecessarily eating pain and suffering of animals we are supposed to be taking care of.
Damn that's depressing. I mean we all know it's true but some pepole are just too scared to change their lifestyle, they'll take any defense they can find in order to keep eating meat. Try to see your biases and be rational, people. Go vegan I guess, bc that's what I'm gonna do. It's long overdue.
This video is so misleading. For starters, vegetables that travel across the world in boats ALSO have to travel across your town in trucks and such, same as meat. The comparison is extremely poorly done. Secondly, using grassy mountainous terrain to plant forests and sequester carbon wouldn't work. Those biomes naturally have had grass instead of trees for thousands of years for a number of reasons. They mostly only serve to grow grass or cattle. Frankly I expected more from Kurzgesagt.
They are putting out across a message, without triggering the majority of the people, by changing the thumbnail 🤣🤣🤣!  They are suggesting that, we should change from "Meat love" to "Meat hate".
Great video. but ultimately the video does not offer a solution. To make a better world, you got to make life easier or cheaper. So more people recycle now, as it is easier to do so with factories having automated sorting so we have bins for 'mixed' recycling in our yards. To eat less beef, you have to make it more expensive somehow, perhaps in a legislated way that makes animal welfare better (but not as I learn here make them more free range!) and make the meat perhaps of a higher standard so it is more expensive to buy - meaning farmers also will not reduce profits- humans have eaten meat since they arrived on this planet, and I don't see us become herbivores in my life time! We need to get our essential protein requirements from plants, and treat meat as a treat. Eat less meat, and only expensive meat! Good luck to us all!
The worst thing for me is by far the imense suffering of the animals. They are conscious, they feel, love, think, they are just less inteligent, they are like small children with different bodies. People only continue to eat meat because they fail to put themselves in the place of the animals. Imagine that for every beef that you eat you will reincarnate in a cow body in a slaughter farm, and for every beef that you choose to not eat you will reincarnate in the body of a free cow, you will reincarnate the same amount of times, but the meat you take or not decides were. Im pretty sure that most people wouldn't even look at meat anymore. They know the cows suffer but they choose to still eat them because, for now, its not them who are suffering.
Transporting local meat to your store vs transporting imported plants can’t just ignore that you need to transport plants from the ships to the stores as well though.  Overall emissions of transportation of imported plants vs local meat will be drastically lower for meat
Had that new thumbnail ready to go didn’t you
it seems like you are experimenting with thumbnails. Prev it was ''Meat Love'' and a cow with heart eyes in heaven and now its a cow in hell
wait, do you change the image?
Why change the thumbnail?
This is one of the worst videos made to date. The focus is narrow. Completely skipping damage caused by a monoculture which far outstrips emissions damage. Soil depletion is by far worse than beef. On top of that raising beef regenerates soil. We killed millions of bison and assorted heard animals. We need more beef not less. Mass cattle drives across the prairies would do the planet a lot of good. I'm willing to bet fencing the prairies in is far more damaging than raising beef cattle.
I’m lost, was that a yes or no?
Thumbnail experiments? Happy cow meat love. Demon cow meat hate.
Hemp can be grown anywhere and has many possible uses. Hemp also stores carbon and replaces nitrogen in the soil.
9:25 This is flawed as it doesn't account for the avoidance of emissions such as methane from animal agriculture (thus the actual benefit of avoiding animal mass murder is much greater).
Only legends remember that the original thumbnail was "MEAT LOVE" and now "MEAT HATE"
They changed the vid image
They changed the vid image
A video or part of one about the fishing industry and its impact. I'm curious how it compares to beef. I would assume it's much more efficient with direct emissions, but devastates more habitat. Thank you for the great video!
Yea cow farts and steak are destroying the planet yall, I'm sure dinosaurs didn't fart meethane at all for millions of years. Just eat your veggies and get weaker and sicker, oh yea and ignore the governments roll in all this deforestation because gotta ignore the state's role in destroying the environment.
Why did you guys change the title and thumbnail??
How about GMO? I was expecting it to be touched upon.
If we can't even eat without destroying the planet, then surely that either means, there are just too many people, or that climate change is an inevitable fact of life. All we could ever do is slow it down a bit. So I say we should just learn to adapt to it in that case.
9:05 I can imagine a beef-free diet quite easily, but turning full vegan to free 20% more land than not eating beef...
I'm surprised no one touch about sea or river fish farm... I believe it could be the future of meaty things
"...they don't waste energy on things like walking." If you can't see how sick this is, then you're a psychopath. Meat and animal product consumption is the worst thing that occurs on this planet, by far.
Lol why did you change the thumbnail
Making people stop eating meat or paying more for it is not a solution, it is simply destroying the quality of life of poorer people. The Amazonian soil is not good for planting soy, it just doesn't happen here in Brazil, more than 90% of the production is in other biomes that, by the way, this type of globalist propaganda insists on ignoring
I love how they had to change the thumb nail to meat hate from meat love.
Ay they changed the thumbnail
I see you guys are experimenting with Title and Thumbnail after that Veritasium presentation. Apparently it is working.
Perfect! I was just writing a long sheat about my experience cutting out meat and this helped a lot with the working progress! Thank you so much Kurzegesagt for making this information easily available!
Did no one notice that Kurzgesagt changed the thumbnail
lmao u finally changed that ugly ass thumbnail
Normally I wholeheartedly agree with these videos but this one clearly rides on a biased opinion and is simply a snapshot of the issue.  Quick to point out the multitude of uses in plant crops but not at all for animal products as if the only thing that comes out of animals is meat and methane.  Also the way the numbers are shown it almost insinuates a nutrient equivalence of products by showing just mass values as if a kg of soy beans is equivalent to a kg of beef in any way.  I saw seafood in the video yet we haven't discussed impacts of fishing, fish farming, any shellfish or maybe one of the largest converters of CO2 on the planet: Diatoms.  Don't forget if you just went vegan it would completely eliminate the worlds use of animal products/biproducts and free up land the size of Africa which we could then grow grass on it to heal the world of the meat devil.  Really a gross misunderstanding of the entire subject matter coupled with the cherry-picking of statistics in order to push a viewpoint.  Love having that dislike counter taken away though since comments with criticism get buried under muppets talking about the channel as a whole instead of the video/subject leaving no way to gauge video reception.
What about fish?
The issue is this. We feed animals ready to be slaughtered with beans/grains just to feed Western countries. Those beans/grains can end world hunger 14 times over. It's never about survival but about corporate greed and pleasure. Humans love the taste of meat only cos it doesn't look like meat and has been seasoned and altered so much to taste like different things. But we don't really kill an animal and eat it on the spot like lions do. Lions kill for survival and instinct, humans kill for pleasure, for tradition, for culture, for money. If you're living in a third world country, totally understandable and won't force this on you. But for us living in a first world country, the biggest difference you can actually make starts with how you eat. We have objectified animals so much to the point that they are just commodities, and there is no emotion attached, only indifference. Pigs are smarter than dogs, experience the same range of emotions and can be domesticated like dogs. The only difference is our perception. I hope this can enlighten some people out there. Please consider this comment.
8:19 "The only way to sustain our high demand for meat is by growing crops and feeding it to our cattle..." I love Kurzgesagt, but the idea the there's ONLY one way to sustain meat demand is naive and completely had my interest in this video drop sharply because of it.  Spoilers: the demand is high not because of the steak impact on climate in and of itself, but also because of how many of us want steaks. It's a 2 variable problem (1 - what is the action, 2 - how many perform the action). Stop treating it like a 1 variable problem. Making less meat eaters (yes, have less kids - I know, it's like a radioactive subject no one wants to touch) also helps this problem, hence, there's absolutely more than one way to sustain stuff, and in most cases, all ways matter at this point.  Just be honest about them and don't come across as if human procreation shouldn't/can't be a part of the climate change conversation, like it's free and has no impact, because too much human procreation is the largest part of the problem at this point (too little also a problem, yes).  Where's the balance and how do we get there? Oh, I wish I knew...
Why did you change the thumbnail from meat love to meat hate ?
Did anyone else notice that they changed the Thumbnail?
@6:30 you guys did not research Joel Salatin at all. You ADMIT that destroying the forest destroys the souls ability to hold carbon. COWS FIX THIS. They can INCREASE or repair a soils ability to hold carbon. Cows on pasture help fertilize the grass, they regularly prune the grass and if done properly this stimulates growth. Cows are critical to our Ecosystem  This narrow "scientific" thinking is the EXACT SAME problem that gave rise to the killing of Sparrows in China. The university (correctly) calculated that a sparrow easts several pounds of grain a year and that killing the tens of thousands of Sparrows would save massive amounts of grain. Little did these scientists know that sparrows were critical on keeping down the locust population. And tens of millions starved.
I dislike this vid
Why did they change thumbnail from happy cow with (meat love ) above it, to a hell cow with (meat hate) above it ?
2 days in and already the thumbnail has been changed? What was wrong with the other one
Eat the bugs bigot Live in your pod Don't use cars Do you want to save the planet or not you guilt ridden monster
So "Go vegan". Straight to the point :)
What is wrong with you.
Seeing those animated cows in those cages made me so sad 😢
On the transport issue and differences between local and imported by sea... how is that possible? Doesn't the transport of meat add to an already existent distribution chain? Yes the transport by sea itself doesn't produce much but in all locations the way to prepare beef should be the same, they'll still go to a butcher, simply not a local one, and they do get transported by truck/train to wherever they're sold  Think of it like this: Local distribution: Butcher -> transport by truck/train to warehouse ->shop ->sold Imported by Sea: Butcher ->transport by truck/train to warehouse -> loaded on ship+ ship transport -> Unloaded from ship + transport to shop/warehouse it needs to go. Imported by sea does add a larger distance and carbon footprint and the numbers given at 4:42 seem incomplete or cherry picked to account for only some situations as not all cities are near the sea/ocean.   You guys said that most of the CO2 gases from transportation are  emitted at the last leg of the road as it is being distributed to shops, problem is that distribution will happen regardless of if it's shipped by sea or by land so the way it is transported is less important than the fact that it is as 1 kg of beef will produce the same co2 footprint as 1 kg of rice.
No.
Hold up, did the thumbnail for this video change...?
What about the ethics of eating meat and killing intelligent creatures for pleasure? Vegetarianism and veganism has strong merits even without the climate emergency.  This video is titled "Is Meat Really that Bad?" when it should be titled "Is Meat Really that Bad for the Environment?" CO2 emissions and science aren't the only path to morality, and you even point out how this approach can contradict concern for animal welfare in this video because it encourages factory farming. Given this is such a controversial topic as you say, presenting it from just one perspective doesn't do it justice.  How about comparing diets across different countries and contexts (compare the Himalayan steppe pictured in your video with an average American diet), or different ethical arguments for or against meat, or examining what a low-meat diet might look like?
Canada alone has enough trees to completely absorb the entire CO2 emotions of the planet. With only 9% of the world’s forests.
i suggest that vegans stop farting so humans can enjoy meat without worriyng for emissions
Slight correction: 1 kg of potato would keep you alive longer than 1 kg of beef And the whole message of this video is 'Cut back on meat'
Is it just me or did the thumbnail change? Or am I going crazy?
those veggiepatties are for animals too
You lost me with "It's complicated"...
@Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell  Stop mixing proper evidences with corrupted evidences!  Here is another thumb down!
soy is used to feed lefties, therefor its used to feed animals
The previous preview picture (I forget what's it called) was much better, this is polarizing and very negative
What about lab grown meat ?
This is the first of your videos I've ever thumbs downed.. all factually correct but deliberately framed in a dodgy way.. the 75% of soya crops that go to animals is byproduct that would be thrown away otherwise
Just ordered a chicken burger instead of a meat burger. Got to start somewhere
I noticed one thing. the thumbnail in the channel says meat love but outside the channel it says meat hate???
Remember kids : no plant-based protein (no, not even soy) is equivalent to meat proteins. Soy does come close, kind of, but even soy lacks 2 essential amino acids (technically, it does contain them, but in such tiny quantities that we cannot consider it as a good source). Translation : vegan diets will NOT give you all the essential amino acids your body needs. Have a great day!
They changed the thumbnail...
What happened to the title and the miniature ? Yesterday were different
You completely ignored the fact that easting 1.5 kg of potatoes for 1k kcal is nonsense, you also completely skipped the non-caloric nutritional value of meat, vegan diet requires heavy artificial supplementation, not to mention new, huge research when it is proven vegan diet is strongly associated with mental health problems, including depression and that meat is not way associated to overall mortality rate. Unfortunately can't paste the links because they will be removed by YT.
Why did you change the preview pic on the video, Kurzgesagt?
This is a good video but I feel like there's something missing. What about fish and seafoods. It's a huge source of meat too but it doesn't require any feeding, it all comes naturally. And also the eggs and chicken/ducks are the most efficient & cheap protein too but it doesn't requires too much resources. A family can have eggs in their diet regularly from 5-6 chickens in their yard. So is it really logical to have a vegan based diet when we can easily include some vital animal based protein in our diet without damaging the planet.
I feel sorry for factory Farm animals, they just live to suffer then die
And everyone was bashing big container ships that bring in stuff from across the world... I used to like to make fun of vegans for having all their soy and such be brought in from another continent. It's neat to see that local beef is still way worse than that And yeah, one of the worst aspects is that we use such a large chunk of farmland, just to feed our food instead of ourselves directly. I'm always a bit annoyed when driving by those massive corn fields And the thing with meat in general is that, it doesn't even matter if it's meat or not. Most of the taste comes from spices that are plants anyways  I think the beginning of the end was when people 12.021 years ago started burning forests down to plant crops Though isn't algae in the ocean responsible for binding 2/3 of all co2?
I feel like the argument around 4:40 doesn't do this topic justice. If we're talking about pollution where there's only carbon emissions from food and not transportation, then how would a truck that doesn't emit carbon present an issue regarding transportation outside of the space beef occupies? It really feels like the industry just wants people to be enticed into becoming vegan when pultry and fish are fine options as well. Frankly I find the movement to be insulting because it's just assumed these days that you're bad for eating meat when there could be a variety of issues, culture and environmental scenarios that impact the way we eat and what we can eat. I'm already allergic to soy, I can't eat it period and while other options exist, I still believe that with our current understanding of biology that we can't accurately detail every macro-nutrient or vitamin each person needs to live comfortably because a lot of it comes to guess work and troubleshooting over years of blood samples for the doctor and I can't justify it. China is worst country in the world regarding pollution and until videos start holding them accountable, I wont hold them as a credible source of information on the topic of pollution. I'd go so far as to wager that corporations push this for future proofing a more compliant species that can't survive without produce produced by said groups that control the source.
I don't even want to know why they changed this videos thumbnail from a cow with heart eyes to a demonic bull.
Lol love how they changed the thumbnail from love meat to hate meat
And don't forget, by eating vegan you're not participating in unnecessary death and suffering :0
Regenerative farming anyone? Supporting local farmers?
Didn’t we just have meat love yesterday with the giraffe🤣🤣
This makes me wonder what impact making meats products a combination of half meat and half plant based would make.
Would be cool if u guys did a video on the importance of soil carbon sequestration
Why would we use up our carbon budget by 2100 only with food? Isn't the budget a yearly thing?
So you change the thumbnail
Soy people eating soy fed animals are basically just as much a “soy boy” as a vegan eating tofu?
From meat love to meat love in the title
You changed the thumbnail?
Thank you, great video, as always! However, I did feel as though some points were neglected, in favour of focusing on beef.  1. The future of lab grown beef/other meats  2. the impact of other types of meat, besides beef  3. The usage of non-farmed meat (such as hunting and fishing)  4. The use of meat to feed carnivorous and some omnivourous animals kept as pets, working animals, in zoos, etc.
Did I just see a chicklet eating a hamburger.
All I saw was comparisons with no same bases. Comparing local with global and then forgetting to add the local transport when global reaches the destination port.  Well the dislike count might be gone - but I dislike this video.
4:24 is that the sound from hoi4
Did anybody else notice that they changed the thumbnail to something more sinister?
Thats not true meat isnt that bad as this video says. I love Kurzgesagt but this video is wrong if you guys want to know the truth try to see sccientific journals about this subject. I am not accusing  this video but i think there should be more research
I absolutely love the video, but I feel like I am misunderstanding something. When talking about how much CO2 3 billion hectares of land could take out of the atmosphere you say that it would take 100 years to take 800 billion tons of CO2 out of the air, and that we produce around 50 billion tons per year right now. So that means that every year the 3 billion hectares of land would take 8 billion tons of CO2 out of the air vs the 50 billion per year that we produce, but the infographic is presented in a way that makes it seem like the amount taken out of the air would far outweigh the amount that we currently produce. It seems like 100 years was compared directly to a single year, but I also feel like I may have misunderstood the information somewhere along the line.
Eat the bugs, Live in the pod
One big thing missing here. Food waste. Here meat is the king with 11% waste vs 28-30% on fruits and vegetables.
If you don't want to eat meat, that's fine, but don't you DARE tell me how to live my life, you authoritarian tyrants. I will happily keep eating meat.
According to this train of thought wetlands are bad for the environment. They produce high levels of Methane, water vapor, and can produce other green house gases. This land should not be used this way, instead we should drain all swamps, bogs, salt marches ect., Because they are "bad for the environment".
Population is the problem.
Kurzgesagt getting a lot more noticeably opinionated. Not an issue, just an observation. My own opinion, if you will.
am i trippin or did he changed the thumbnail? from meat love to meat hate lol
The thumbnail on this video changed, I'm sure it used to be a cow with hearts and Love in the thumbnail. Anyone else noticed this?
Honestly I'm really disappointed that Kurzgesagt didn't go over the inhumane ways humans torture animals all around the world
?  Why'd you change the thumbnail?
Another reason hunting for meat is a good thing!
The thumbnail changed  Happy cow in heaven with "Meat Love" above it   Turned in  Demon cow with "Meat Hate"
from meat love to meat hate
I think the solution for the average American/Westerner, is to be mindful of what you eat. The undeniable facts are that meat is worse for the environment than plants, HOWEVER it is possible to have an ethical and sustainable diet that includes meat. The goal should be a whole foods, plant based diet (this is not the same thing as a vegan diet). If we center our diets around eating more of a "good thing" instead of eating less of a "bad thing", it becomes a lot easier to make changes on a societal level.   Try to cook more. Its cheaper and better for your health if you can spare the time. Cooking can be fun by learning new recipes. Try to center vegetarian/vegan/plant based recipes, and you'll naturally incorporate more varied veggies and will begin to eat less meat. If you can cut out fast food, or only choose veggie options when eating out, you will be surprised by how quickly your diet changes.   Think of meat as a treat instead of the center of the meal. Knowing what you know about the animal ethics and environmental ethics, try to weigh out whether your personal enjoyment is worth partaking in meat consumption. Learn to tell yourself "no I don't NEED that, I just want it, and its okay to go without wants".   Be kind and understanding to other people. Much of our diet is affected by our financial situation, the society we live in, and our mental health. Some people live in food deserts where fresh food is near impossible to obtain, or they work so much they dont have time to cook. There are strong cultural aspects to meat dishes that can leave people feeling alienated by cutting out meat altogether. Some people have a lot of diet restrictions because of sensitivities or eating disorders that make finding nutritious alternatives to meat extremely difficult, expensive, or time consuming. Cooking can be more difficult for disabled people or those with executive dysfunctions (the mental processes associated with "getting things done").  Sustainable lifestyle changes take a VERY long time to make. Be compassionate and helpful, to yourselves and to eachother. Shaming people does not work to change their behavior. If youre a vegetarian or vegan, try cooking meals for your friends to show them that we have food thats just as tasty as meat dishes! Or try to help them come up with meat substitutes for their favorite meals. Educate people about the environment in a nonjudgemental, non preachy, empathetic way. We were all in their shoes once.   Background: mostly vegetarian/transitioning, only eat meat on special occasions (typically once a month or every couple of months). I've been cutting out meat only for 8 months
When you speak about the emissions and their effect on it all, you compare local meat with overseas avocados and come to the conclusion that shipping avocados causes less stress. Does thtat account for the transport of the avocados from harbour to the grocery? The meat has to be transported over land by trucks but so does the avocados after arriving by ship
Again that climate change agenda. Disliked.
4:24 The avocados must also be delivered to local markets, have you counted emissions from trucks as well?
Please your book in Bulgaria 🙏
Go vegan
So youre saying the vegitables don't also have to get shipped to local food markets?? this is crap...
This video is absolutely brilliant
Only OGS remember when the thumbnail was meat love.
I have the calender From netherland
wasn't the thumbnail a cow with hearts on its eyes .-. why do people actually care about something like that...
Who else noticed they changed the thumbnail from meat love to meat hate?
Why did you change the miniature? 😭
So basically, people that eat meat can choose: "Humane" meat = Bad for the environment   Unhumane meat = Better for the environment (but still bad)
Interesting to see the title and thumbnail has changed.
Where is my lovely Meat Love Thumbnaill(with the cute yellow cow not this cow spawn from hell 😭)
Global Warming is a hoax
Meat is awesome
5:33 Be careful ! Most of the methane emited by cows don't come from farts but eructation 😊
is it me or the thumbnail changed?
I wonder how much emissions come from the deer we hunt.
D: The cute thumbnail is spooky now NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The answer to the video’s title is “yes”
I am not a writing person so i just wanna i love all the Kurzgesagt team!thank u
Gretchen has ordered us all to comply and become vegans. F climate change! My 500 head of sheep get a special diet that increases their methane output by 173%.  I eat a special diet which increases my climate impact by over 300%. Cry Gretchen cry.
Someone ping the vegan teacher
I love how the thumbnail went from "meat love <3" to "meat hate >:("
A smile came out of my face when i saw the stonks background and i already knew what was coming.
did they swap the thumbnail, or am I going mad?
Is meat really that bad? YES. *leaves* (and I'd even say "refuses to elaborate further" but this is Kurzgesagt so y'all know that ain't true)
did the thumbnail change?
Hang on the thumbnail changed
Kinda surprised by this slip up, maybe I'm missing something, but showing the CO2 emitted as per year while showing the CO2 removed at 100 years is really disingenuous, and not necessary for establishing that removing 800 billion tonnes of CO2 in 100 years is a good thing. It also looks like the scale of the bars are set so that they'd both look "full" at 800 billion tonnes, which doesn't make  sense given that their time scales are different, so the bottom bar would be "full" in after roughly 16 years, compared to the other at 100. Obviously the bottom one is labeled as per year, but the point you're trying to make here (visually: 800b is a lot more than 50b, but conceptually: 800b is a lot but maybe not so much when we're emitted 50b per year) is unclear.
Did the title and thumbnail go from “meat love” to “meat hate” or am I going crazy.
The cow looks like Satan 🤣
What about the carbon footprint of cultured meats?  Have the labs produced any numbers on that?
Spoiler alert : Yes, it is
You just waited untill the dislikes were disabled to upload this video.
I disliked this.
Disgusting propaganda. You should be ashamed.
Is it me or the title and the thumbnail change, I swear the title and the thumbnail change
Didn't this video have a "Meat Love" thumbnail with a happy cow a day ago? Whereas now mine shows as "Meat Hate" with a sad cow. Love your stuff.
Price is the main motivator in a free market. Beef has been steadily getting more expensive since I was a child compared to other meats. As such, I rarely eat beef now, and I am not alone.
I think for a full analysis we need to be able to compare what meat does for the health of humans, more than just a singular view on climate. I don't care if the world maintains its current temperatures if the humans on planet Earth are sickly, weak, and suffering.
thank you for sharing this Information! and don't forget the fact that dairy industry is connected to a beef industry
What bullshit 😂 What even was that comparison between 100years of forest and 1year of humans. Misleading
Excited for veggie burgers to become more available and varied at grocery stores in the future
But, does eating fish doesn't affect to climate change ?
Just ordered ten stakes lmao. Stay mad libtards! COMMIE BASTARDS COMING FOR MY GODDAMN MEAT! ILL FIGHT EVERY SINGLE OF YA BAYBEE! BRING IT !
ROFL they changed the thumbnail to make cows look evil just to cause drama AFTER they hit  trending, this channel has gone to shit for views.
Scientists should creat a meat-tree that would grow meat-fruit while sucking out the CO2 from air.
4:35 That's not really a good argument. The fruits and vegetables are still need to be delivered to the markets (via land) from freight ship.
Why did the thumbnail change?
Sorry Guys, but I am, and intend staying, Vegan. V ery much E njoying G uzzling A nimals for N utrition
I miss the original thumbnail already. 🥺
Love meat to *meat hate*
Meat is no better than Facebook!
the title should've been: is killing animals for eating really that bad?  also it's not meat hate but animal killing hate.
This next generation is the future. Y’all better pay attention
No, it isn't
what happened to the funny cow with funny hearts in its eyes :<
maybe in a nutshell switched the thumbnail cuz a bunch of uninformed people disliked the video
Why r the governments still finding solutions when the world has a Kurzgesagt!
beef or any meat is part of a modern human lifestyle, as is jeans, pastics, electronic devices and any other modern product. Just running the internet itself produces severe environmental damage, as is making clothes, and any other necessities that in todays world are not optional. In truth most of anything outside of basic hominid life (aka stone age) is just for our own leisure. A move to full veg based diet will definitely promote further innovation and reduce the damage to our environment, promoting quality of life and living spaces of a utopic sense. Yet we are facing actual collapse at the moment and thus  we need to focus on fixing and adapting to the coming backlash of our environmental damage, preparing for environmental crises and evaluating our priorities as humans on a rock in space
Did he change the thumbnail?
Hahaha I love how people from outside of Brazil is so fascinated by our rain forest. But the best part is that they think they are morally able to talk about deforestation after wiping almost all of their original forest. Bullshit will definitely wipe humanity off
This is annoying; it is wrong to consider food as part of the carbon problem. The carbon in plants and animals was taken out of the atmosphere within the last few years. When it returns, that is a zero-sum. The new carbon that has been locked away in compounds for millions of years being broken down and released is the only real cause of greenhouse gas increase.
those are SOME facts. There are other facts/studies that make that subject way less simplified than this video implies it is. There is also a lot of political lobby involved that changes how we perceive data. not blaming Kurzgesagt tho
personally i think the best way to start getting people to go vegetarian or vegan is to both make it more economically viable at the consumer end and to cut out meat from school lunches. With the basic idea being that if children grew up with vegie burgers they would be much less put off later in life by the lack of meat.
Time for another burger . The world will take care of it self ,
The thumbnail:- Am i Offensive Cancel Culture:- and i took that personally....
Woah I wasn't prepared for that thumbnail change
Woah I wasn't prepared for that thumbnail change
I miss the first thumbnail with the nice cow 😭
did the thumbnail change from "meat love" to "meat hate" or am i trippin
Wait where did the 'meat love' video go? I was going to watch it then saw this decided to compare them but it's gone now? What happened?
so biased
That thumbnail change was a MASSIVE 180 turn.
ok I noticed the exange of the thumb nail, so Im here to finaly watch
Could do think about doing a video on insect-based protein and its impacts ? I would really like to know more about that subject as it seems a good alternative to meat !
Umm kinda of disappointed that the main reason a lot go meatless was not discussed in a video that asks if meat is bad. And that is ETHICAL reasons. They sort of touched on it about free range/vs/factory raised. But either way they are still slaughtering the animals for consumption.  A lot of people go vegan/vegetarian for, again, ETHICAL reasons. Some do it for health reasons, some do it to lose weight, etc. And just everything else is a bonus that comes with it. Like it's better for the environment/cheaper/etc. The main problem people have is they like the taste. And they will bend over backwards to maintain it.  No offence to anyone, but if people would not have such addictive personalities and got over themselves and gave up meat we'd be in a lot better shape.....but no the taste, the taste...ughhh
okay the way i see it lets stop eating beef i preffer pork and chicken anyway ...
If only there would be an alternative for beef (health -wise)
they changed the thumbnail
Why did the thumbnail become scary?
Lol so it was meat love now meat hate
thanks, but i prefer my beef
I will continue eating meat as it tastes good and is good for you.
Y’all want meat so bad just eat cats 🐈 and dogs 🐕
No, I like my borgar and I will continue eating it in moderation but how about the fishes or marine wildlife that are being harvested illegally on a mass scale by a country that spread the virus too?
If people don't want to be a vegetarian that's their personal right, but this evidence should at least make us reconsider the amount of meat we consume. Reducing meat to a once a week indulgence could still make a huge impact in terms of helping the environment. Plus, if you eat less meat and are mindful about where it comes from, you can make much more ethical decisions.
I love how the thumbnail changed from "Meat Love" to "Meat Hate" real quick
Why change the thumbail
this channel makes my understandings.. better than before ❣️
I kept coming back to watch ( or rather, listen to ) this, and noticed they changed the thumbnail from "meat love" to "meat hate" lol
Meat is life! Eat it!
We're foocked no matter what we do. 100 years from now Soylant Green will be on the menu!
10:05 if only that veggie pattie wasn't so expensive!!!!!
I recently did some research and concluded that a vegetarian diet with dairy was about as bad environmentally as a vegan diet except poultry, but the vegan diet with poultry seemed healthier.
please cover Solein! protein synthesized from air and sunlight!  Thank you Kurzgesagt!
This was a really good video. The piece about factory farming is very interesting. I firmly believe that if humanity "survives" in a meaningful way, we will look back at factory farming as an unfathomable global crime. Much like slavery (both throughout history and specifically slavery in the American south), factory farming made the modern world possible but at what cost? As evidence continues to mount that animals are capable of experiencing pain and misery, is factory farming worth it? Are we entitled to experience the pleasure of eating meat if the cost is misery and pain on a scale we can't really comprehend? What if instead of pigs, we ate dogs in that manner?
Okay, okay, I will try vegan diet next week. Maybe if I like it, I will do it every 2nd week. Will see how it goes.
Meat is not bad just the industry itself and how selfish people are. If anything the fast food industry absolutely needs to go and to an extent restaurants that are very low quality. I would say at least have fast food go and anyone who supports it is definitely considered an awful person especially if they go for a beef burger instead of a plant based burger but honestly that’s besides the point since both of them are not supposed to be in the diet anyways. Choose Real Foods instead where you have to cook your own meals anyways not the ultra processed pre packaged crap that the industry sells.
I really admire the investigation you put into all your videos. You could write a dissertation about each one you make. I am currently working with life cycle assesment for my masters and up to now I hadn´t seen a video about something i´ve worked with and seeing you hit us with straight facts about a subject that i´m familiar with really makes me appreciate the work you do.
am i high af right now or did they actually change the thumbnail ?
Why’d the thumbnail change
A point that moved me - you can thrive without eating animals. There are olympic athletes, grandparents, and children that are vegan. So. If you can, maybe don't kill animals. They are kind.
Vegans: how can you still eat meat? Me: cuz they still sell it.
Vegan teacher be like: MEAT IS MURDER! STOP EATING MEAT YOU   MURDER PEOPLE
Why did you guys change the thumbnail?
This video is silly 🙃
Western people lifestyle is somehow counterproductive in some manner or other.
Why did the thumbnail change? The title too???
Bruh kurzgesagt where are you turkish cc? Don't Turks have the right to learn?????
Meat Love to Meat Hate... that was unexpected.
Tldr; the less meat you eat the better
Wait why'd the thumbnail change from meat love?
Beef stonks!
Lets be honest some of us are looking in the comments looking for arguments over this topic. Well anyways im going to go eat a burger, have a good day.
I’m curious though, is consumer pressure enough to reduce the production of meat quickly enough to a point where it’s sustainable(or at least not worsening the climate crisis)? If not, what should we expect other groups, especially our government reps, to do about it? Reducing subsidies comes to mind first, as it would encourage people to buy meat products less often, but they would have to be reduced slowly to ease the population and economy into it.
Ah I liked the old thumbnail better
Absolutely fantastic video. Thank you Kurzgesagt for educating people on how a plant-based diet is the best choice for the environment
Why did they change the thumbnail into something more sinister?
the new thumbnail is sick! (i actualy liked both)
from that 77% of soy used for animals, how much would be usable for humans? at leat some part of that 77% wouldn't be usable for us, so it's essentially free food also there was said that worst plant based food is better than best beef, not that veggie burger "meat" is better than beef
@vegano
THEY CHANGED THE THUMBNAIL
This video has made me lose my faith in humanity having any future at all
NOOOOO THE BEEF STONKS
The thumbnail change though. Wow It's awesome
not baited, just clicked to see comments about the thumbnail change
Omg different thumbnail 😂
No matter how you look at it, eradication of humans is the best possible solution for the long term survival for life on earth.
No meat isn't bad
if we count CO2 produced by animals, we should kill of as much animals as possible, by that logic... why cow CO2 matters, but elephant, panda or monkey CO2 doesn't?
So short answer: Yes!
why change thumbnail?
Imagine vegan watching this  🦧🐮🐮🦧
There was a think group that was saying that at the point where lab grown meat becomes mainstream green house gas emissions from food will plummet. The the bigger sources of greenhouse gases are slowly getting taken care of as well i.e. more solar and wind every year and more people with electric cars.
did...did the thumbnail change?!?
I got baited
Whaa thumbnail took a 180 straight from meat love to meat hate😂
The thumbnail has done a 180! 😮 I wonder why...  Regardless, thank you for the video! :D I am a firm supporter of letting meat become a now-and-then food, instead of a staple (at the least). But I know that living in a country/culture in which veggies still reign supreme makes it easier for me. I also think the culture surrounding changing your diet (for either yourself or the environment or both) can be very toxic, both online and in-person. Do any of you think there’s a way to mitigate that? 🤔
notably all the "think of the poor animals" people would happily ignore the reality of all the foodstock animals becoming functionally extinct if it means one more person goes vegan and lives a life on supplements and with the various health complications that particular "diet" is known to cause.  next will be more "you can't have a come chicken-coop those things are noisy!" then "all that fields going to waste having those animals there, have you considered ~insert climate/region-un-viable-crop~ here?"  9:20 that wouldn't be what happened, another town/city would be established with it's own supporting facilities (power, sewerage, factories, and other infrastructure). The wider world won't be denied the advances made in other countries that have seen creating and exploiting the marvels of modern tech.
I love how they changed the thumbnail picture...and NO ONE EVEN NOTICED IT LMAO
Damm the disliles are a lot !!! Including mine !! I am one of those who eat chicken and beef 😋 in front of PETA idotas ! 🤣😂👌
I love these videos but the data is very inaccurate at times.  In particular the part where "41% of agriculture is portioned to animal feed" is absolute rubbish on its own..  Well over 75% of the crops fed to animals were either damaged and thus going to be wasted or highly fibrous and inedible to humans.  The grain train has done a great job spreading false narratives though.
When you see a field of corn it's almost certainly going to be turned into food for animals and not corn for you. It's not very tasty the particular corn they use anyway.
If cows are such a burden on emissions, why weren't the buffalo 200-300 years ago when there were 75 million of them roaming around? How did the environment handle that population but can't handle the cows we have now? Estimated at 90mil or so
Honestly man this sways me to be vegan/vegetarian more than the ppl that try to guilt u into it bc of the "sake of the animals"  I feel like more ppl would actually take it seriously if they did this instead of the guilt tactic
go vegan
Yay, let's beat meat!
Did they change thumbnail or made some changes to their latest video?
"I pick both sides, so I always come up on top" probably kursgegast Edit:kurzgesagt*
did u realy just change the thumbnail
F .... they changed the thumbnail
The exception to beef being a negative for the environment would be certain types of free roaming cattle ranching in the Western and Midwestern United States. That area is missing millions of large ruminants; bison. Carefully ranching can actually restore damaged ecosystems. The tricky part is avoiding over grazing and managing the herd. Returning bison would be better of course.
This is a dilemma for me, i love beef but its high demand is bad for the world
Sees title * me: "No" moves along with my life
eh i only would consider stopp eating beef when all the middle class jerks stop driving their SUVs and buying a new cellphone every year and dont even get me started on clothing and shoes..... like you said in that video, food just makes up a quarter of the emissions we produce and they are vitable.... so yea stop buying iphones, driving big cars and stop watching youtube videos.....
Stop breeding so much, 1-2 kids is more than enough, there is no good reason for wanting to populate every square meter of the planet.
Is it just me, or was the thumbnail originally gonna say "Meat love" with the cow having hearty eyes
I love how the title says things are complicated but everything that is said in the video is an argument for going vegan lol
The dislike button is hiding some serious problem with people.
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat ?
yes. the answer is yes.
I love that u change the thumbnails.
00:00 Africa would like a word with you
Brazilian speaking.  Soy Moratorium has become one of the main ways to prevent deforestation for soy planting, private companies made a social pact not to buy more soy from places deforested after 2006. Since then deforestation for this purpose has dropped precipitously, Greenpeace makes a lot of hype about this initiative. So it became fixed in our environmental laws.  Deforestation for pasture has fallen over the years, being restricted to "grileiros" groups, that is, the reason is the theft and resale of land, illegal wood or mining and not necessarily cattle raising.  Unfortunately around here there are almost no incentives for reforestation, almost predominant are legal obligations or for carbon/environmental credit (Mandatory for public/private works that have an environmental impact).  Private reforestation initiatives end up getting lost in the giant state bureaucracy, so we will hardly see projects like the competitions to create the largest reforested forests in the world here, as India, China and other countries have done.
I'm not vegan because of climate change. Because the research on how much it really affects climate is debatable.  I'm vegan because I know the affects meat can have on the body when consumed chronically.
haaa anyone else see that they changed the title and thumbnail to get more views?  they deserve it tbf
The thumbnail and the ad humanoid are different
Change needs to be done. And fast
What happened with the thumbnail
OGs who remember the cow in heaven thumbnail are admins
I swear the thumbnail was different a day ago
I just want to know the total cost to have everyone eat veggie burger... a big issue is you are totallly dependent on industry... you can't buy local, you can't raise your own veggie burger.  So once animal protein is outlawed...you are 100% dependent on industry for your protein.  I know, major city dwellers don't know the difference...food comes from the corner deli.
There arnt many people who talk of this without going into "I think" or "It is racist not to" I mean, how can eating meat be racist?! It is like saying a seat is racist to fat people, at a certain point you are just being a dunce about it. It is one thing to be vegan, it is  another to force others to  eat grass to please your sadistic half rotten brain
Eat the bugs bigot !!
70% of emissions are caused by 100 companies. If we can't have meat, then we will eat the rich
Raise your hand if you were here before the thumbnail changed 🙋‍♀️
Brought to you by the Gates and World Economic Forum “Great Reset - You will OWN NOTHING and you will like it” crowd.
im not eating 5x the amount of calories to get the same amount of protein
Indians  I don't understand why this is a problem
That cow made me feel a new kind of dread
I would add clean meat to the video, even though it's still very expensive, the technology has everything to revolutionize food.  The source would be the same, soy and the like, but without the animal to emit methane, and consuming only what is necessary to grow in the laboratory. This will free up regions for reforestation and overall tends to lower human food costs.  Aside from the moral issue of killing animals, it would be an easier transition for non-vegans.
Didn't expect such fail from Kurzgesagt. The net carbon emission is the release of carbon that previously wasn't in the air, like burning coal and oil. If we convert all our technology to renewable energy sources so does an agriculture. Carbon emission doesn't count breath of cows for example because it is the release of carbon that was previously captured from the air while raising crop.
At this point I don't even care anymore. The effect everything has on a changing climate is largely fear-mongering science. We think we're smarter than we are. While it's a given to reduce emissions wherever possible, it's a simple fact that we exist. And unless we "unexist" there's only so much we can do ... or even should do. I'd recommend some anti-fear climate research, but of course then I'd just be a climate denier or whatever the current term is.  Fact of the matter is: Could I stop eating meat? Yeah, probably. Would that be a life worth living, when good food is largely responsible for getting some enjoyment out of life? Not really. We CAN all survive on tasteless gruel, as long as the nutrients are in it, but what's the point in living then? That's just survival at best ... not living. Maybe lab-grown meat will really go through the roof. Say bye bye to farm animals though. Or finding alternative means to reduce these emissions, if they're really such a bit contributing factor. When you factor in research that claims that the man-made impact is pretty small overall, 25% of "pretty small" is even less.
Well - I will share this personal anecdote… I’m over 75 now… I’m still active and healthy - I take no prescription drugs - and I have NOT eaten any meat in over fifty years. I eat a completely VEGAN diet and (for me) it really really WORKS! Meat is a luxury food… a food that the planet cannot afford.
Not a single dislike. Undoubtedly the best content on YT.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old." Are you sure there?
The problem is obvious ... its humans... too many humans. every major problem on this planet has one source ... HUMANS
Another banger of a video!! Thanks for this, it’s incredible. I’d love to see a video on what would happen to our climate if humans only ate meat one day a week, or one meal a day
*Contrary to common belief, grass fed beef doesn't negate beef CO2 impact at all because most pasture have already achieved the state of equilibrium where the CO2 absorbed is equal to the CO2 emitted (from soil organic mass buildup/decomposition) !*
What I see in this video is a straw man argument, “beef bad because Amazon rain forest”.  Where I live on the Great Plains an argument can be made that beef production is good for the environment. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, it’s estimated that plains bison numbered 30 million and wood bison 170,000. Beef cattle are good replacement for bison. Both are a large ruminant whose  cloven hoofs break up the hard pan giving seed a place to germinate and spread seeds nutrients in their manure. Maintaining the health and natural diversity of the native grasslands is important in maintaining a carbon sink. Use the search term “Grasslands More Reliable Carbon Sink Than Trees” in your favorite search engine.   With 2.7 million views and ≈10% like this is a sad commentary on how agriculturally illiterate society has become.
I am wondering about a theory where we use a 2 child's rule to lower the world population. Don't this solve lots of problems in the long term? Because everything bad in this world seems to comes from a fast need of materials to have a 'happy' population.
such a vegan biased video. just because a neat video on youtube says so it must be true eh? please be less naive. your conclusions are only as biased as your sources. who to trust tsk tsk tsk.
Listen to the keyword "Outlier" its mentioned a number of time "In statistics, an outlier is a data point that differs significantly from other observations. An outlier may be due to variability in the measurement or it may indicate experimental error"
Give me a break!!!!! The way he says “controversy” at 5:23, you’ve lost all credibility… or should I say “creed-I-bill-I-T”
As someone who deals with life cycle assessment everyday I must say that the LCA study forgoes on one important aspect; the right functional unit. If you start comparing food based on the nutritional value of protein types instead of total protein content, some plant based alternatives actually start performing worse than, let's say, chicken. Of course environmental impacts are just one thing to worry about, if you include the potential spread of diseases any sort of animal bunking is a bad idea. Just to say: it's always more complicated than you think!
meat is bad - thats why i beat it everyday!
ahahah beef " laughs in indian"
Im disappointed in this display of information. The destruction of the rain forest is an attack on biodiversity not CO2 sinks. The rain forest doesnt really "breath" in and out to the rest of the world. However the conifer forests in Russia do. The land isnt good for human use (cold all the time) and only really supports animals that can eat pine neddles and animals that eat other animals. These forests span most of Russia and "breath" in and out with the seasons to the rest of the world. There is a cool NASA video that shows this. I feel it is disingenuous to infer that the destruction of the rain forest will increase climate change. I also feel it is suspicious that data about fish is left out of this video. I'm not a super expert or anything so when I can spot one fairly obvious omission and a bending of the truth, I have to take more time to think if these are a result of ignorance or malicious intent. I'm quite nonplussed.
The issue isn't what we eat. The issue is our population. Look how densely people are packed in China India n Europe. If we get rid of all the liberals we can cut CO2 emissions by 50%
I LOVE that thumbnail.
É mais fácil ser vegano para resolver os problemas ambientais.
It's only bad until we are mildly inconvenienced by the fact we can't eat beef
Why do veggie Patties cost more than beef ones!
I will not eat ze bugs.
The problem with these videos is that it hard to tell real honest information from propaganda.
The world is in a dire state of global warming over cow farts. Great
Go carnivore, your veganism is killing you. If I hear one more argument about climate change I'm going to lose it.
I dislike this.
Why no one brings wars and the weapon industry to the global warming discussion?! Why a cow fart bothers the world?! instead the main problem is "humanity" especially greedy ones.
Another factor is that people often use eating food they find tasty as a comping mechanism for their emotional and psychological difficulties, many of which are unaddressed, and for many, meat dishes are their favourite coping mechanism.   Those who quit eating meat often do so out of guilt or shame, and basically force themselves to go without the coping mechanism until they find a new one to replace it, while beating themselves up in an unhealthy way in the process, and then might feel inclined to project their guilt and shame onto others, for self-righteous preaching is another form of coping.   There is another way that someone might quit eating meat though, and that is getting to the point of psychological development, through therapy (lets be honest most people need it), methods like journaling, and other beneficial practices, get to the point where they face their emotions more, rather than escape from them with reliance pleasurable distraction/numbing methods, like tasty food, and no longer have so much repressed issues to cope with, say, tasty food.   I highly recommend the latter, rather than the former, since it benefits one's life as a whole, but aside from that, while some people might be receptive to being guilt tripped by others and/or themselves into forcing themselves to quit eating meat despite relying on it as a way of coping in life, many people, perhaps even a majority of people, will not take that route ever, once tasty food is a coping mechanism for them, and in fact a significant portion of the population would probably react with anger and actively resisting vegetarian advocacy, cause they'd feel defensive since, their way of coping would feel under threat.   Personally I would say to really help the climate and contribute to better treatment of animals via less consumption of meat, a better route would be indirectly to approach it, by encouraging meditation, journaling, easier access to therapy, and such methods, so that people won't feel like they have to cope with their suffering in life with pleasure, whether it be from meat, cigarettes, or something else that serves the same purpose in their lives.
About destruction of forest for farmlands: it's not just for creating beef farms, but also to grow the spy and cereals needed to feed all the cattle. So eating meat will also increase beef feed production. So all those people saying "soy is also farmed over destroyed forests" are right, but the majority of that soy goes to cows and meat animals
Go vegan!!
I think this skipped air-freight fruit which I suspect is very different in efficiency to cargo ships.
More co2 = more food for the plants
My way to solve Climate change: There is no Co2 Emissions is there are no ppl
Monkey eat meat monkey likes 👍
Bill Gates is right. Cutting the population solves everything. Sorry
I’ll still continue use meat daily
And how much of that carbon is actually from fossil fuels? That 71kg of CO2 doesn't really mean much if 90% of it had already been floating around until the year before when it was sucked up by a patch of soybeans somewhere.
Wonder if turning humans into robots or whatever they do in movies is our best bet to live. Seems more possible than making all of humanity unite to fix pollution.
Based on the information given, I will remain sticked to meat and dairy. Although beef is not as widely consumed in India except for milk producing cattle
Here's a question: How does the analysis change if you recapture at least some of the methane and use it to produce energy? Could the reduction in methane emissions, coupled with the reduced need for other energy sources, significantly offset the environmental costs of meat farming?
Plants vs Zombies reference soundtrack?
nah its pretty good
basically we humans should be extinct ❤️
So cheaper factory-farmed beef is better for the environment!🥩🌮🍔 Mmmm, I think I'll get a burger this morning.
but that means that even reducing emisions and go full vegan the entire world, it still would have a expire date due to our invitable impact in the earth... wouldnt be easier focus everything looking for solutions than trying to reduce an impact that will never be stoped while humans (or other intelligent species) are alive?  you re buying time, but time for what if you are focusing on reducing something that cannot be stoped?
Now go watch some Earthling Ed.
What about fish?
Let's just say that this topic is a bit...   C O M P L I C A T E D.
How about the future possibility to grow meat from stem cells? i guess just the logistics would be the culprit then. Would be great if stem cell factory's could be housed locally to
Adventure Time Intro
There Is only One response to this video : we, humans are too much for this Planet now.
Don't worry about it, the Sahara is will turn back into a rainforest whether humans are around to see it or not. 😆
This is complicated inded. I mean the attempts to reduce emissions. Being alive is causing emissions anyway, so the most effective solution would be a suicide. Of course, this is a ridiculous extremum and we need to find a compromise.  Choising a type of food we eat is one of them but I wonder how much emissions we would reduce if for example we would stop watching (and making) movies. And in general all entertainment and lesure industry - It's not necessary for the survival so theoretically we could resign from it.  And what about traveling? How much would we reduce emissions if we would only do the travels that are essential for our existence? for example: we could spend our holidays only within walking/biking distance from home.   Let's go further - no art, no sport, no communication over a longer distance. No food processing over the basic one that makes it eatable. Use one set of clothing until it falls apart. Otherwise this is all unnecessary emissions from the perspective of humanity phisical survival.  ... Unfortunately this is also our civilization, our culture, our lifestyle and identity. So we have to make decisions, resign from less important things, keep those that means more to us. For those that we keep, look for the solutions to reduce the impact on environment. And the food is just one of the things we have to deal with. We don't need to resign entirely from high emission products, instead reduce their amount that we eat. And what important, concentrate on avoiding food waste, because the highest rate of emissions per calorie is from the food that we don't eat and just through away.
I do not understand why emissions of "worst beef" are way higher than "best beef" when later the worst the cows live the less methane they emit. Might be because my English... Thants for these videos!
Condemn ppl from other countries to permanent poverty. That's not the answer. Brazillian citizens that live near the amazon rainforest are poor, they shouldn't take the brunt of climate change, caused mostly by Europe, the US and China. Rich countries should bring down their carbon footprint before giving S*** to poor countries.
Eat your bugs
I will always eat meat 😤
Yeah I don't care. You can't have my cows.
Just in time for that fertilizer shortage. Id rather cut biofuel before i cut beef out
0:45 They changed the banana for a cow in the ape's hand! hahahaha!!
go vegan!
I made it a personal game out of guessing what the sponsor for the video will be
I love steak
When talking about a beef free diet freeing up 2 billion hectares of land, is it just beef? Or beef and dairy? Or even all ground based meats?
Isn't the comparison at 9:35 a bit deceptive and dishonest? You're comparing a co2 removed over 100 years to co2 gained per year. At a quick glance, the graph implies that removing 800 billion tonnes of co2 is a great improvement compared to today's emissions, but that's not necessarily true. Make the co2 emissions every 100 years and it's 50,000 billion tonnes emitted, which looks worse.
It is ok. 50 billion people will do all the food production more effectively than today.
Thank you for saying all of this! Those are amazing points!
I would love some comparisons about chicken meat instead of beef!
mn qko klipche
This video only applies to rich countries. People in third-world countries don't even care how much carbon footprint is associated with what they eat. They don't care whether it's local or not, they eat for survival.
if the great creator didn't want us to eat them, they wouldn't be made out of meat...
Wouldnt just switching to pork and poultry already help alot?  They are about 10 less co2 emitting than beef  So shouldnt it just be eat other meats instead of beef? That seems way easier
Meat lovers for like.
"Land without food crops isn't automatically ecologically useless" - did anyone ever claim that it is? Quite scary how simple truths like this need to be explained, but then again, humans are shit.
vegans strike again -_-
HELLO KURZGEZAGT! *I have a question for a future video!* :  This video was super amazing, I just bought your book "IMMUNE" and am enjoying it a lot too! However, what I've always wondered (and was never able to visualise) is how much the world would have been different if humans never grew much in population!  Say that instead if several billion, we never had more than a few thousand humans in population. How much have we already ruined? What would the temperature be? How many animals wouldn't be extinct? What beast would be at the top instead of us? How much wonderful nature would still exist today?  Maybe a good notivator to live better lives is to see what would have been if we were never here to ruin it.
I was vegan for 6 years until this year. I stopped due to health concerns and the stress/anxiety of always needing to find vegan options (which isn't so easy in some parts of the world).
All this video does is make an average person feeling guilty for enjoying their occasional burger. That and making money out of promoting Skillshare. And that final 'Do with this information what you will'. What, what could I or anyone here realistically do with that information?
im surprised that they haven't talked about "changing diet to edible insects" honestly this might work
Nice video as usually. I noticed just a little mistake, not really important. Circular saw should be rotating opposite...it works similary like digger shovel, just lot of them in a circle.
incredible quality :D
I'm a carnivore. I don't feel I have had anymore than a snack without meat on the plate. I have tried vegetarian a few times, and it didn't work for me.
Well done Kurzgesagt, you really showed W.I.L. who's boss
The channel started really well few years ago with high quality topics, but it started recently to show falsely opinionated topics,  and present them as if they’re facts. And this is the worst video in terms of misleading information. All the graphs and comparison you made are completely wrong and exaggerated to manipulate opinions and make people feel bad for the wrong reason.
Eat ze bugz Live in ze pods
I was so so so glad to see this video pop up on my feed! Thank you for adressing such an important topic, I hope it encourages many of your viewers to critically think about their diet and its environmental impact.
So, We Must Stop Cutting Trees, Lower he Production Of Beef And Lamd, And To Grow More Forests.
Living in Eastern Europe, I dunno who eats all the beef on our planet. It's the most expensive type of meat in the supermarket and people mostly consume chicken, pork and fish. Me and my friends only occasionally eat burgers like 1-2 times a month. Maybe in Western countries the situation is different cause people have higher income?
Could lab-grown meat be the solution?
Insect protein is the future 😄
It is really so enjoyable? If all the universe is just a soap of experiences and all the living forms are just the "food" for the "gods"?
You can use Like button of this comment as dislike button !
The key to solving the problem is cultured meat. If the quality of cultured meat improves as much as regular meat, the paradigm will change, complementing the notion that eating animals is immoral. As always, the results of scientific research rather than moral research will change our lifestyle.
Dislike
I have been looking or maybe waiting on a "Snowpiercer" like protein/insect-bar to become more mainstream, as its very gimmick right now. I know there have been companies in Europe that have been trying to get insects to been accepted in mass production, but have gotten backlash from health and safety inspectors or other reasons.  If the point is high protein density  (nourishment density) then insect is a viable candidate. We need to get the social stigma away from eating bugs! I don't know how Timon and Pumbaa did it. But let's try to mimic the behavior.
6:20 Brazil Mentioned Lets gooooooo  fudendo todo mundo
The vid has 7k dislike at this current point of time.
good and bad are human constructs, eating meat is natural
So are you guys vegetarians?  Are you deliberately trying to mislead people? When you say that 41% of the world's cereals are fed to animals, does that mean 41 per cent of the grain, or 41% of the cereal plant, ie stalks & leaves? That is a huge difference & dishonest not to point out that a huge chunk of that oft quoted number is parts of the plants inedible to humans.
👎
how do you guys gather up so much data?  what is the source of the data?
if @thatveganteacher used this technique to tell others to be vegan...it would be really productive
To think that the ecological problem is limited to CO2 emissions is to ignore a large part of the problem. We shouldn't just focus on that. For example: the land used for intensive breeding becomes completely sterile, impossible to grow anything on it for years. This is also pollution. The waste rejected by these factories (cow excrement which is harmful to the environment if present in large quantities and stuffed with chemicals, etc.) is released directly into nature and destroys rivers and groundwater. This is also pollution. And these are just a few examples. (Oh, and wanting to raise cows in areas that humans cannot monetize to do something is neither a solution nor an argument. The planet does not belong to us and it is not because a corner of the earth does not serve us that it serves no one, even less that we can monopolize it).  To think that, CO2 emissions = pollution, is true. But pollution = CO2 emissions is wrong and that misses a big part of the problem.  But it would take a much longer video if not several to deal with the subject in its entirety. Gut video anyway 👍.
My neighbors burn electric wires yesterday. A lot of farmer burn left over to free the land. I will say eat your beef. Until the problem solves in 3rd world countries nothing can be done.
If they make an actual good veggie patty that has the same taste and textures as beef, and costs lower than beef, i'll make the switch.
Was really hoping for a twist
most people just dont want to change their habits lol, they'd rather live their best lives than leave anything for humanity's future.
4:26 but the food still needs to go from to port to where you live right? Does that somehow still produce less CO2 than buying it localy?
this video made me hungry
half the world's population without any quota anything, should just be killed every 100 years or smth. but with small increments within those 100 years, not all at once. I'd be ready to die for humanity
I remember coming across an article that allowed us to be able to produce cow meat without killing the cow, but instead using the genetic material. If it becomes very effective, it might just be able to decrease co2 emissions since we will not have to raise as many cows as we do now. Feel free to criticise, just sharing a thought here
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times per day and never gets old".  ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT
Ah yes now I can really know if meat is bad for Me because Kurzgesagt is teaching me
The quality of this vid that my brain can suck up your information like uhh... AHHHH
Food is Glorious but the growing Populations of Poorfolks are Vast and Uncountable
India and china should stop having sex damn we are overpopulated.
METH-ane like methamphetamine
Hey guys as Brazilian I honestly don't appreciate our current ridiculous president, but before demonise Brazil, remember that we are only 210 million people but we feed almost 2 billion people in the earth. Another thing is that since 1990's the International Commerce Organisation determined that countries like Brazil shouldn't produce technologies but just become big farmers to feed the first world nations. Now we don't have industries anymore, our people are suffering even without basic food (as I said we produce food to 2 billion people and our own people don't have access to the basic food), the unemployment is terrible high and our economy is mostly dependent on agro-business. So what else do you guys want??? Think two times before talking about Brazil because our elite do not represent the good people of my country that is suffering every single day without the basic to survive. 👍 🇧🇷
Ideally go vegan. BUT if you are not willing to, just eat less meat. Simple solution.
Can't wait to watch another Immune vs virus
HEYYY I FINALLY SAVED UP ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A CALENDER I'VE BEEN SAVING IT SINCE SO LONG OMFG!!!!!
Not talking about how your vegan food for example tofoe you have kill all animals and insects in that area. I am all for eating less meat but dont push this vegan agenda that it is better cause it clearly not
Is meat really that bad? Well its bad for the one being killed just to be crapped out the next day.
I found the comparisson with the avocodo extremely useless. You compared a local transportation to a international transportation emission wise. The avocados need to be transported after they arrive at the Harbor, therefore causing more emission per kg. This comparrison was a little missleading. Sorry if not everything is spelled correctly,  I am no native speaker.
11:00
I have a climate change report due next week on beef production. This video is so well timed :)
3:50 Let's steak with beef
please make a video about censorship on Social Media
Also, how do you put a bar for 100 years and for 1 year next to each other on the screen? That's the 101 attention manipulation. It's a sad day, I used to trust this channel a lot.
Maybe a video about cultured meat could be interesting !
Shut up and eat your bug burgers plebeians. The steak and beef will be reserved for the upper class.
You ignored the entire thing about land transport of plant based foods. Something they have to do too. It takes a lot more fuel to transport a banana from the coast of california into Idaho than it does for an idaho cow to get to another place in idaho.
Science will not (and should not) give you insight into whether something is good or bad. That's for morals and philosophy.
As the wealth Gap grows meat will eventually be for only the wealthy. As we are all forced and brainwashed into eating nothing but vegetable based meat-shaped chunks, the rich side of the world will continue to enjoy their steaks.  I am glad I'm going to die soon, citizens are quite literally being brainwashed into ditching their own rights and pleasures.  Come on Sweet death! Bless me with your touch!
Seaweed is a cheaper cattle feed that reduced cow methane production and is cheap ranches wouldnt have to relay on corn for animal feed!
Answer to the video: Yes, yes it is.
Main criticism, you say that buying local doesn't change emissions that much because ships are efficient. That ignores the fact that the imported food then needs to be unloaded and shipped to a supermarket which could be far inland from where the import point is. This would negate or even exceed the CO2 output of locally sourced food.
Great video as always. I don't get though why at 9:34 you compare the CO2 removed over 100 years with CO2 emitted in just one year. I think the comparison might be misleading
The obvious answer is lab grown meat
My tip to just be vegan
I have decided what to do with this information and unsubscribed from kurzgesagt lol. I don't want to be fed the sponsored pseudo popsci bullshit like that anymore.
Thanks from a random vegan ! Anyways to clarify something, methane coming from cows are not really from their farts but from their "burps" :)
I became vegetarian because of the effects meat have on the planet. Now I don't say people  have to give up meat but what i do think could be part of the solution is eating less meat, like two days in the week meat-free could lower the demand for it significantly.
I would love if you made a video going further in on the subject... i just whatched a video that went in a completly different direction . When you use global statistics X local statistics this reaults can vary a lot . The mais thing is that i don't understando if developing countries just have to update their pecuary model or if meat production really has to go because it's just uneficient as is .
Maybe comparing beef to other types of meats or sources of protein could make for a good video. For example, I have recently seen a video explaining how a kilogram of crickets contains a lot more protein than a kilogram of beef. It would be nice to put into perspective how many alternatives exist that could be just as enjoyable, so that more and more people start to, at least, consider changing beef from a "main choice" for food, to a more occasional treat. There really are a lot of alternatives guys!
Indian culture is so rich that they are following something that others are just started realizing  Ayurveda/diet is best example   I'm also working in cancer  It's generally found that colon cancer realted to processed meat etc. Indian diet have so much food that have anti cancer properties  And that have very low cancer rates than americans have  But unfortunately now some indians are blindly following Western culture .
you should make a video about plants and how much co2 absorb, expecially because the more there is the more they can grow and being efficent
dislike count is 7k
Still waiting for synthetic meat.
To Summarise… anything we do only slows disaster slightly. The only thing that would really help is to stop breeding, and that’s the 1 thing humans refuse to do
How much CO2 do humans produce by just breathing?
Sill i don`t want be a vegan. Vegan food is not tasty. And what about rice field if we stop use animals we lost natural fetilazer (cow poop) and we be forced to use synthetic ones and they production is not very ecological. You can make material about meat from laboratory this could save climate without being vegan
I'll stick to my meat!   Though I am wondering. What about pre-industrial climate change or even pre-human climate change. Since our planet was a molten rock, it has had rise and falls in it's climate, while the human factor in this sequence of climate change is interesting I must admit it is a done to death topic. Would you conisider doing one or more videos on the history of climate change before our entry onto the planetary stage? Kinda want to see something other than the usual droning about climate, it's become too idealistic and political to be of any interest.
You know use cows to upscale calories from the human inedible parts of the plants we eat e.g plant husks, stems and leaves. It's more carbon efficient to be doing both livestock and plant based farming.
Finally a video that touches on the difference between animal fart methane and carbon. (At least it touches on it for 10 secs) Animal methane last 10 years or so, so in 100 years 90% of all the methane produce by livestock will be gone and the level of methane from cow farts will be the same as it is today.  The actual cow itself isn't doing any harm to the environment, its just human demand, which is gonna increase by 30% by 2100.
What if we just clone the meat?
Moral of story is become vegan to save this world... for your children
It really sucks that channels like these have almost twice as little subscribers as some other YouTubers. Don't get me wrong, 17 million is A LOT, but there are some stupid influencers with over 40M who don't have real talent, and who don't teach you anything
Plz make an updated video on, 'Are we living in a simulation?'
there's no better feeling for me when i'm biting into a nice juicy bloody steak or burger and nothing on the plant side i've tried yet even comes close to the feeling as much as i'm sympathetic my net happiness is more important than trying to contribute to something that's ultimately moot unless we have a massive global shift.
1:07  the background music reminds me of  the Succession theme
Probably a wise decision to wait with this video till the dislike button was deactivated...
If a burger tastes good, is made out of plants, and doesn't have estrogen in it I would probably eat a lot more plant based "meat".
I actually wish to go vegetarian tbh. But with how the prices are for plant based products like plant burgers patties or sausages it's hard
Does this video gonna have Spanish subtitles in the future, I would love to share it with my no English speaking friends
What concern me is when animals need cultivate with cruelty to meet human diet's demand. I mean, animals also has the right to live peace just like humans do, and not to exploit them.
There's a lot of hype around lab-grown food but I think insects as a food source is objectively better.
before watching the video, i would say no but processed meats probably yes
Ask: Video on real alternative to meat.Nutrition , viability , all that fun Kurzgesaht jass.
For those who cant see dislikes, right now there are 6.9k
I don't like beef that much anyway. - but I think we can afford poultry! - And I'm not giving chicken up.
Ok i will no longer eat beef or lamb but there's no way that I will be vegan.  PS: I have a duck video, a chicken video, a video where i am begging for money on Twitter... Also a patreon

Well I really really love food
Those who argue against meat can go on a total vegetarian diet, no one's stopping you, just don't pester those of us who like a well balanced diet - vegetables, fruit, grains and  meat. You enjoy yours, I'll enjoy mine 👍 cheers
I will only live once, i wont waste my life eating gross vegan diet. With all this information, i conclude that the only way to save the planet is by removing Humans from the planet itself. 🤔
I didn't understand a part! He said Beef with higher quality produces less emission while later he said Animals who are kept in worse condition produce less emission! Can anyone explain this to me? Is it a mistake in video production?
Best channel on Youtube, IMO. Thank you for consistently optimistically disturbing content.
Only materials that doesn't need "don't like it comment"
What I learn from this video.  If you want to enjoy a meal and not go vegan, have a beef free diet instead.
stop eating all meats and being vetan  is too drameticlly.  it seems start to eating chicken and pork is a good start.
i have seen videos saying grass fed cows can help with the depletion of top soil. i would like to see your opinion regarding it.
Awesome
Where does fish go on the chart? 3:04
Pork Burger !!!
Nobody blame cars? Average car emissions is 150g of CO2 per KM short city ride will release around 2Kg of CO2
Don't feel bad for them, we are the predators they are the prey, and it should stay that way.
I've tried eating vegetarian meals once or twice a week and I just end up feeling hungry no matter how much I eat.  I'm a 6'5 man and if I don't have meat once a day I just feel shaky and tired.  I really have no idea what these vegans are eating or how they can afford it.  Where I live nuts and fresh produce are not cheap and the amount of it I'd need to buy in order to feel satiated (if I ever could) is far more than buying a cheap steak or some ground beef.  And it would also seem that as the meat gets greener for the environment it gets more expensive because pork is more than beef and chicken is more than pork in my neck of the woods.
Amazon forest are burning and the latest COP submit did nothing about it. We are all f..ed if nothing changes soon.
"well..."  is it gonna come out... is it?   "...It's complicated."  *AYEEEEEEEEE THERE WE HAVE IT*
Quite an eye-opener 😳
Wouldn't it be funny if due to advances in science and engineering in this century, we create many ways to produce insane amounts of power that effectively allow us to control the global climate, and so it would no longer matter how much of what food we ate, thus making the the climate change scare something people in the future laugh at us for?
I looked at your sources because I was wondering about your statement on long journeys which would be more environmentally friendly than short circuits. The calculations seem biased to me. let me explain :   To calculate the environmental impact by taking into account only the carbon footprint and only by comparing local transport with transport by plane or container are two mistakes. Why ? Because international transport does not stop at planes and ships but also before and then all transport by truck, from the producer to the port (perhaps with an intermediary) then from the port to another then from the port of arrival to seller (with perhaps an intermediary). In addition, longer journeys spatially can also be temporally longer, which implies specific techniques and technologies to preserve food over such a long time. The packaging may be reinforced and may also require additions to the products themselves.
3:20 What is "The best beef?"
This is why we some of the Indians r pure vegetarian 🤭 At least I'm not influencing carbon emissions by using meet & fish 😂
so they expect me to stop eating my favourite foods because of "climate change" but every year these "experts" fly out on their fossile fuel burning airplanes to the climate conference. yeah ok 🤣
I just recently brought your book immune from Amazon Indiaand I loved the way you guys have made it and we want more  books of series like these on health, space and other topics......   I just want to say plz reduce the price of these books in India as some of my friends can't buy it although I share the book with them, it is just financially too much costly.  And keep the good work up.  LOVE FROM 🇮🇳 INDIA ❤😍🥰
For anyone wondering how many dislikes this video got (at 2.6million views), about 7k
I gave up red meat and I feel MUCH healthier!
The methane from a cow is enclosed within a loop. When the feed is eaten, the methane is released into the atmosphere and then reqbsorbed by the growing feed. Therefore all the methane produced from cows goes back into the environment (rather) neatly.
I’m going to pretend I didn’t see this video
Beef stonks 🥩
the ship carrying avakados after docking, avakados be like i m gonna teleport directly to the grocery.... i wouldnt expect such a failure from you kurzgesagt. avakados and other plant based foods that shipped has the same cost with beef plus shipping matters.
Me who can't eat most Plantbased Food: Well I am fucked
is being vegan good for environment or bad?
What about the other parts of the crops that aren't used for human consumption? Aren't they supposed to account for a large amount of feed for livestock? I'm curious :>
@kurzgesagt, do you watch "What I've Learned" you seem to go over some of the same points
Great and unbiased summary
As an islander, cow protein is rare, only meat from fish and pig are the meta here
Some people may say you campared having an orgasm to food
That's great for those of you who can get vegan patties in the first place
This is one of the most anthropomorphic perspectives I've seen yet. Who cares about how humans "use" their land? Are we to log the Amazon for "resources?"
What about more plants for more o2 and less co2 for a temporary solution so we have time to cut back on the other bad stuff
I love how neutral they are in their videos
man talk about cope, "enjoyed multiple times a day" more like bared with multiple times a day "never gets old" man how can you not be slaving away at the stove, only shit it all back out again, wasting hours of every day  eating food is not only a chore fucking chore, its a one trip road to the toilet man i would trade the ability and need to eat for never having to take a bathroom break again, talk about win win
I feel like a cultural shift to a higher pork and poultry diet over beef would be much more feasible and significantly greener. The argument wouldn't be to cut out meat, but rather to change the type of meat. I mean a pigs digestive capabilities make them nature's recycling machines.
So shipping of 1kg avocados around the world equals half a fart while delivering 1kg beef down the block equals 1 million farts. People are going to eat beef so buying locally is a better argument for progress than for all to become vegetarian. Saying buying locally is insignificant is irresponsible when the alternative is unrealistic.   Next we can all give up alcohol because it's lifecycle is all negative to the planet.  Unnecessary exercise, such as every sport ever, is bad for the planet because it expends tons of calories. Increasing the demand on the planet for more food production, fertilizer, shipping etc.  Instead, we can all stay home and watch these unrealistic videos you pull out of butt so you can make millions and buy....you guessed it...the most expensive beef you can find.
Great video as always, but you are missingt one critical point:  PLANTS DO NOT CONSUME CO2  They can temporarily bind some carbon in their bodies, but when the plant dies, the carbon gets released right back. The most we can do about it, is controlling that process to extract energy from it, rather from much more effective and easier to control ways of storing away carbon, such as fossil fuels.
i gotta say that i truly appreciate how your guys take these complicated and controversial topics, and discuss about them in as neutral manner as possible.
How about fish ?  why your video don't have about fish ?
Be vegetarian
It is good to be hopeful that the remaining 74% will be taken care of in the future while we combat the "current" issue with veganism maybe. I have to be honest i was waiting too long for new content from Kurzgesagt, the content production is superb, awesome
Nice, help the environment just not eating beef. I will apply that
Meanwhile in Minecraft
Billions of sentient animals are killed annually by humans, many of us have options not to contribute to this horror. We can live without.
I love meat
Ban cow slaughter worldwide... We get milk,cheese,manure and other dairy products from a single animal that animal deserves human love and effection why there's only  dogs and cats to be loved why not the cows who gave us every nutrition to grow. I am strongly against cow slaughter!
Very cool and I agree but steaks go brrr
Next video on  What if we nuke mars?
800 billion ton removed in 100 YEAR  We produce 50 billion ton of emission in 1 year.   Which means we produce 5,000 BILLION ton of emission in 100 YEAR   Its not 800 vs 50. Its 800 vs 5,000  Worth noting also that some of the research paper here is not replicable.
Can’t wait for cultured meat to make this debate irrelevant
Good video made me want to go buy steak 😋
The video should have been called "Our Beef with Beef"
Illuminati brainwashing people to be vegan
Most of the times I rather starve or drink liquids because I simply dislike eating.
I don't like how the video handled the subject of animal feed. Even though we do feed animals crops meant for humans, the majority of it is INEDIBLE BYPRODUCTS. Stuff like husks, and things that would be inedible, or just inappropriate to sell or use. The video also failed to mention how a huge chunk of CO2 emissions from meat is due to inefficient farming methods in underdeveloped countries.  I feel this video has a blatant bias toward veganism, as they've had a similar video about this in the past favoring against meat. And the content in the video seems slightly shifted toward that as well. R.I.P. YouTube dislikes.
I’m curious how many of the people who stuck around for the whole video are already vegetarian or vegan. If you finish the video and see this comment, please do us all a favor and reply with your answer. I’ll go first: I’m already vegetarian :)
❤❤❤❤🙏
3 billion hectares may remove 800 billion tones which far exceeds the required amount. 2 billion may not be as much but wont that still be more than the required amount therefore invalidating this issue?
I love consuming meats, they are my favorite
FOOOOOD GLORIOUS FOOOOD MAGICAL FOOOOD
Meanwhile Indians: Cows emit oxygen 🤣😆🤣🤣🤣
Eat beef in the 2020s, and we'll be eating each other in the 2060s
No wonder Indians with ancient culture are vegetarians for ages!
What about synthetic meat? The first factory of cow-free beef was opened in Israel, and I think this is the way
cant cut meat out of my diet entirely because i cant afford that fancy veggie stuff, but beef is pretty easy to cut out, so thats what ill do
Unsubscribe
Greenisbullshit!
Good video, but it omits one important reason of why meat is bad, it requires the unnecessary exploitation, suffering, and killing of other sentients. Go vegan, help save the animals and our planet.
3:50 "Let's steak with beef"
:V I'm not eating bugs or living in the pod.
I thought the patty at the start was a meat pie
What about eggs? How does that compare to meat and plants?
I am surprised you did not mention reverse desertification and the effects that cattle and other herd animals have on that process.
Meat eaters know how meat is bad for environment but they try to hide their guilt by picking on vegans and vegetarians, it psychologically suppress their guilt by making them assume that they are superior and the environmental change won't affect them. And I'm not talking about the toxic vegans, just the normal ones are also picked on due to their moral choice! It's sad but true. One cannot stop eating meat all at once that's true but what you can really do is to limit the consumption, that's the only best alternative till scientists came up with more solid solutions
1:40 Using the same argument, at some point in the distant future, emissions from vegan production alone would still use up our entire carbon budget. What the numbers ACTUALLY tell us is the old truth that infinite growth is impossible on a finite planet. There is a limit to how many calories the earth can produce without turning into Venus 2.0.  So, if growth must be curtailed, I prefer doing so at a level where I can eat meat. I can sacrifice beef and lamb and make do with pork and chicken - that's as far as I'm willing to stretch. I live in an apartment rather than a house, walk to work instead of driving, rent a car if ever I need one and I do not travel much, and when I do never by air. But I do eat pork and chicken.  If you want more people, that's on you. I'm doing my part by having no children of my own, thus making the carbon footprint of my lineage infinitesimal in comparison to anyone who does. I believe the world would be better off with 5 billion people than 50.  And no, because comment section, I'm not advocating killing off people. I'm advocating HEAVY investments in birth control  and family planning education ALL over the world, as well as draconic measures in handling the "pro-life" crowd, including churches backing it ideologically or otherwise. Make life about living it, rather than about raising the next generation of it.
I don't care if the earth lives on
Right at the beginning he says, "No other bodily pleasure is indulged in multiple times a day".  That sir, is patently false. Because of reasons...
"No other bodily pleasure is experienced multiple times a day and never gets old" Me, who poops every day: 😈
This channel is funded by the BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION. This channel is full of propaganda and lies. Do not believe what this video tells you. Bill Gates has also invested in Beyond Meat. "Stop eating meat! It's bad for the climate! Instead buy Beyond Meat and make me even richer!"
They did not mention that slave labor is involved in the gathering of a lot of imported produce.
although...if all people were to be vegan wouldn't that cause need for farmland further? (unless many will just grow it themselves, that way it'd be a little bit better won't it?) And isn't it that meat can be shipped? What's the emissions of that? Is it the same as well with vegetables or grains when shipped?
I live in a 3rd world country where meat is still considered a luxury. I think we only got to eat beef like twice a year. So I guess we're good.
The local vs shipped food feels like it makes little sense. There is also the carbon footprint from the vehicles that transport the food to and from the docks.
There's a reason there are virtually no pure herbavores.
What about intensive herd rotation? Mimicking histories massive wild herds by putting far greater numbers of livestock onto land than is commonly thought possible, and turning dry and barron soil from a desert into a carbon absorbing grassland. I have heard of this method, and a few of it's pros, but I haven't been able to find anyone talking (logically, that is) about the cons of meat bring it up.
I would like to know more about the plant side of things. Right now it's focused on meat production and the cost of land. Let's say we flip beef with plants. I would like to know the cost on the environment in that scenario. Would it still be better or would the pendulum seeing too far the other way?
beef stonks
Sources?
Does the carbon emission percentage for food production factor in the carbon removal that occurs naturally when growing food, or no?
I mean that’s all cool and all but have you ever had a good steak?
"well, it's complicated."
I dont think ill go vegan tho
Now I feel proud to be an Hindu as we are vegan due to our religion and also have a special place for cows in our religion 🤩
I only eat chicken, beef and poor lowki suck.
Random question but what's considered the best beef @ 3:20. Grass fed, local, extra what factors minimise the carbon per kg?
I like this video so much . If you don't mind , I would like to ask your permission to share this video to the other website in China for the embarrassing reason that YouTube is blocked from accessing in China . Of course , I will give sources of the original website . Thank you very much .
I ate a steak while watching this.
and what are the stats if we grow hemp for transforming the co2.....
(chomp)
This is why I'm vegan
How to fight climate change: Let The Rich and the Government Elite be the only ones to eat it, while the rest of us eat like rabbits.
think the biggest problem is taste, and the human dependency on meat for far too long. plus a lot of vegans try to bully and look down on you. good luck making a change.
I don't like eating though
The whole animal vs plant food conversation requires willfully ignoring the actual elephant in the room.  Overpopulation, and how it only gets worse with every passing year.  There's this naïve idea that by removing animal based food, we will magically "save" CO2 emissions, when we are projected to increase our overall population by 25% by 2050.  This is before even accounting for the reality that a lot of our current population isn't even using 1st world levels of CO2 emissions, but WILL eventually seek to do so via industrialization.  At best, most of the schemes for reducing emissions cause a reduction in standard of living, while just kicking the can down the road a decade or two, until population growth erases any "gains" you made.  We either innovate our way out of the problem (probably some form of nuclear powered carbon capture scheme), or we somehow convince the world at large to drastically scale back it's population.   Assuming we actually want everyone to experience the comfortable life of say, middle class america, we are already well beyond the earth's carrying capacity of 2 billion or so for that level of lifestyle.  Even if we somehow resolve pollution/emissions, we are going to have a rough time past 2050, due to widespread depletion of easily obtainable phosphorous.  Which is critical for the industrialized farming that sustains our current population.
I love how people are so weak, so addicted to the very sensation of tasting a dead body, that they cannot leave meat. They must find complicated scientific methods to produce and justify consuming meat. In my opinion, if you live to eat instead of eating to live, something's wrong. Please do not argue wth me, I am tired of hearing completely ridiculous arguments. Just use common sense and accept that you are addicted to meat, which is wrong, but because you can, you shall.
Anyone else noticed the content has changed since The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has started sponsoring them?
Enough with this propaganda that we need to become angry sad vegans to survive ...
Pooping. Enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old
That's why i only eat chicken and fish in nonveg
I think that the majority of the calculations for carbon footprint on food are biased. its simple mass balance calculation. for every kg of cereals that you fed to the animal you actually fix a huge amount of CO2 producing that cereals in the first place. The crops are also carbon fixers, the cattle do not grow on  antiobiotics only you know? the plants fix CO2 as part of their photosintetic process and that CO2 fixed by the plant are fixed in the animal fat and so on. the calculation is biased because they only take into account the total ammount of CO2e of the cattle but this cattle is eating grass and cereals that already fixed CO2 from the atmosphere in the first place. Its more complicated than just point out some paper that makes only part of the cycle calculation, you need to see the entire cycle as a whole and determine if the actual balance of that specific cycle is accumulationg more CO2e on some part or are just in balance. for fast natural cycles I think the balance is near to zero, in some cases a little positive sometimes a little negative. the actual problem is to put CO2 that comes from a slow cycle in a fast cycle, the use of fossil fuels is an example of that, they came from a slow cycle and are used very intensively, so intesive that the natural cycle cannot fix the CO2 equally fast and then there is the accumulation on some part of the cycle. the CO2e balance in earth is almost zero, (not taking into account space dust) so in reality the road to zero emmisions is imposible. the actual objective is first reach the fixing CO2 state process (to balance the actual accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere) and then gradually reach the balance. This is the core of sustainability, do things that involves enter in an existing balanced cycle and be able to be in the cycle without disturbing the entire process. We all need to read more about sustainability in order to have better arguments for CO2 and global warming related topics. This is my personal point of view. I'm a chemical engineer specialized in process design BTW, we encounter a lot of misunderstanding in the interpretation of chemical process all the time, mainly in understanding the maximum principle of chemical reactions and cycles: In a chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed - Antoine Lavoiser-.
fuck buying food, all my homies wake up at noon and hunt stray dogs and cats
Western people first started eating meat .... They first industrialized their countries and then they ask other countries not to pollute the earth .... West people and china should be blamed for every bad effect on our earth
*guyz if we stop eating, breathing or existing, our carbon foot print goes to zero, let's go*
There's a cow in my village that gets really fat. There are also several fat water buffaloes. There's also almost unlimited supply of grass because nobody even bother to cut them. I guess these cattle owners are happy, just let them eat grass 😂
So if it costs that much to deal with beef then how come we don't try to move to lab grown food? There's already meat grown in test tubes that they've been working on for a while now so wouldn't that be much more useful then having to have all that land set aside for cows and then their feed?
BitchTube pls bring the f*cling dislike button back 🤬🤬🤬
I'm glad we're not going to die until 2100, thanks for not scaring me this time Kurzgesagt!
Yeah, land we can't use for anything else ...like the fucking Amazon!
Never eat what you wouldn't be willing to personally kill. Bottom line. Emissions are beside the point.
Meat is bad? These are stories made up by Artificial Meat companies and twisted animal protectors
I love your channel but this climate change alarmism has got to stop.
Crazy idea, but what would happen to earth if half the population just disappeared? What would the earth benefit from it or would anything significant happen to begin with?
I thought it said meth....
In a nutshell: we are doomed
Wait so this isnt an answer to What I’ve Learned? This like a, "when we made a video about meat being bad iit was pretty biased but we will make a video clarifying some of those points but still scared to say less meat is probably not the fight we should be fighting"
Don't care I love steak too much.  All in all though, good video as always!
Animals are sentient beings who should not be treated as objects to fulfill human taste pleasures. Pretty simple. Eat Beyond burgers and leave animals along. Go vegan
I don't like meat that much. Sure I'll eat it, but it doesn't taste that great to me.
RAS Aquaculture is the future!!!
But what about lab grown meat? I know it is still in development but looking at it, it could solve the problem in waste production while still giving all the taste and supliments that "real" meat gives
The world only mention Brazil on how we're burning down our OWN forests.
10:09  "You're f**ked either way" is the message of this video lol.
Beef stonks!!!
I support the idea eating only vegetables, because I think it is the way of the future, but I dislike the methods that some vegan is using.....  tell people to stop doing what they do is hard, tell people new way of eating and let them take it slow is easier...
vegans telling you why meat is bad
If you take the intro out of context, you'll realize that the birds are cannibals 😂
I really enjoy you channel, but as an agronomist, I can’t avoid to say that some informations are quite biased. To say that in Brazil they’re burning forests to produce pastire is quite a exaggeration. The local enviromental laws assure that in rainforest areas, only to 20% of your total area can be used to farmland. The burning areas come from SOME illegal burnings and most of the time, from natural causes due to dry seasons with prolongued times. Other is to say that vegan diets will reduce the carbon emission, which is a lie. As the vegetable production will require more volume per square hectare, to saciate the hunger of one human, you’ll need more produced mass. In global scale of meat projibition, you’ll eventually require thousands if not millions of extra farming land to saciate the same hunger, and even then you’ll need to supply humans with some nutrients you can only obtain throuh animal consumption.
apparently having livestock graze on desertified land can restore it to some extent.
I feel like this video warrants up a follow up for what an ecological responsible, nutritionally robust diet would look like in people's lives who are reasonably active!
And while counting total costs, you're excluding medicine and science from it. You see, vegans-grown people _will_ be dumber and _will_ have far more health problems due to a number of deficiencies, especially during development. They _will_ require far more medicine, be far less productive and generate far less science we so desperately need to overcome this crisis. And if the second loss can't be calculated, the increase in medicine requirements can. And it isn't here.  Also, having a new IPhone each year to replace all the previous ones (this year, with a charger that needs to be bought separately in its own packaging and logistics) doesn't help with the carbon footprint. Especially without interchangeable parts and no long-term maintenance. Or changing from the nuclear back to coal, pushed by the Greens in Germany and France, which is an outright ecological catastrophe. I.e. before caring about our foods being too good, there are a lot more extremities than can make everything far less emiss-y and pollut-y.
welp, time to question my diet for the 5th time this year.
The main issue I have with the emissions attributed to livestock is that they have to extract carbon from their environment in order to grow. They can never emit more carbon than what goes into them, so there can't be a net increase of carbon into the cycle. The only way to add carbon to the cycle is to release that which has been sequestered for a long period of time, which is usually done by the burning of fossil fuels or deforestation. While those emissions come into play during the raising of livestock, they aren't direct emissions from the animal itself and could theoretically be reduced to zero with technological advancements.  Is the argument then, that each livestock animal is essentially transferring carbon biomass from plants into carbon dioxide and methane faster than new plants can grow, thereby reducing the total amount of plant biomass on the planet to increase the gaseous carbon in the atmosphere? If that's the case, isn't every animal doing the same thing simply by existing and contributing to the consumption of plant life? If that's the case, eliminating livestock won't solve the issue, they only make up ~4% of the animal biomass on the planet, which leaves a lot of animals that still need to eat. If the same land is used to raise the same amount of livestock (including in this the land that is used to grow additional food for the livestock), and it can do so indefinitely with proper management, there should be no net carbon emissions from the animal itself.  Therefore the only increase of carbon in the system has to come from activities surrounding the raising of livestock, which can be reduced to 0 if no more land is cleared and we can create zero net emission transportation and other things that provide for the raising of livestock.   I'm sure there are plenty of holes in my ramble and I know that tackling climate change will require us to find novel solutions to a great many challenges. I just don't think 'cows be fartin' is an viable explanation that warrants the total elimination of meat from our diets.
Mmm meat tasty 🤤
👇Dislike
think a big point missed are the oceans, earths lungs are the oceans, not the land
I’m making similar content in Japanese. I’m Doing it cuz there is only a small amount of information about Global warming compare to other developed countries. But this video is way better than my content. I wish every Japanese ppl can understand this English.
So, eating less meat would require less land, which could be returned to nature. You know what else would require less land to return to nature? fewer humans. It does not matter at all if we reduce our meat consumption but keep growing our population, that's just a very short term delay of the same problem. If we don't change our diet at all but gradually reduced our population by half, this would have a much greater impact because of the other 75% of your graph showing everything else we generate in terms of carbon footprint. This is the hard truth we need to eventually face, and trying to shrink pie graphs by small margins is just fooling ourselves.
Go vegan folks. Meat production is raping our planet and causing imaginable suffering for animals.
0:04 Well…I could think of another activity…
Would love to hear you talk a bit more deeply about other foods and their impact on the environment. I've heard that some vegan alternatives can be very harmful to grow at scale

I like my hamburger cooked with the slight taste of hydrocarbons, I also own a Ferrari with a bumper sticker that says ,"I Love Fossil Fuels"....seriously,...whawhaha....And climate change is China's fault,everyone knows that .If you look at a chart of the last 35 to 40 years ,the industrialisation of Asia coincides directly with all the temperature Increases and hurricane intensities, frequency, ice caps melting etc,etc,etc.....coupled with the fact China refuses to do the little things like stop using C.F.C.'S IN THE MANUFACTURING OF FOAM,AN PLASTICS,YES ....THEY EVEN MOVED THE FACILITIES THAT PRODUCE THIS GREENHOUSE GAS TO A HIDDEN ISLAND AWAY FROM JOURNALISTS...YOU KNOW HOW WE FOUND IT ,OUR SATALITES CAN SEE THE GAS COMING FROM THESE PLACES...China refuses to do the things that the West forced it's industrial complex to do back in the late 80's early 90's..And I know ,I was alive then .....before you China defenders bash me...it's not all their fault.....like a kid from the projects who suddenly makes his first million".....CHINA WAS WHINNED AN DINNED BY THE BIG GREEDY FAT CATS ON WALLSTREET WHO WANTED CHEAP 3RD WORLD LABOR ,OUR POLITICIANS TURNED A BLIND EYE....NOW WE WILL HARVEST THE CROP WE ALL SOWED....THATS THE TRUTH....SEE YOU IN HELL...Ghostman out!!!
I don't know why I watch videos like this one, between a nightshade allergy and PTC/PROP hypersensitivity (being a supertaster), I will never be a vegetarian let alone a vegan.
I encourage you to read "An Industry Worth Fighting For." Some of your conclusions are not correct as your sources no doubt ignore some pretty big ideas about vegan production (most sources do as they were made by vegan supporters and have a clear bias). Food plays a big role in carbon emissions sure, but did you know beef has less carbon emissions than the Amazon rainforest? Cows emissions are just as cyclical as the rainforests as well, albeit a longer cycle. Many vegan options use more resources and have their emissions in the atmosphere for FAR longer (Im talking like thousands of years compared to the few decades from cows methane). Bottom line, veganism is unsustainable for our growing population and won't even come close to making a dent in the global warming crisis. Our time and energy is wasted there and people need to shift their focus to all the billionaires claiming to care about the climate while they fly their private jets to the World Climate Summit. Switching to renewable energy is the only way to fix this, and we cant do that unless the elite are ready to move their stock from oil to solar, wind, and hydro.
Revenge of the cows.
I'd like to ask Kurzgesagt about insects? i'm aware they need waaay less resources and space to be produced.
Man this animation is too much, either keep it simpler or more realistic but this is a bad acid trip
The fact that a purely vegan diet saves 3 billion hectares of land use and simply removing beef from human consumption saves 2 billion (66% as effective) shows how bad beef is compared to other meats. Just eat some pork chops or chicken if you don't want to live on salads.
Wait I kinda respect ThatVeganTeacher a lil bit now 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Hey!!! What about fish??? No one spoke a thing about fish. What if we were to consume only water raised meet?

i think..i think im a vegetarian now?
we need to eat bugs!
Well I hungry so I guess I'm humans.
The graphic shown and described @9:30 is so laughably misleading, it casts a shadow on the rest of the video.  Frankly, this entire video sounds like a desperate response to the WhatIveLearned Channel, and it does not match up.
vegans always forget that humans NEED meat...
People who are asking why is this free? It is because you are watching their videos so they get sponsership and extra good people buy their merchandise to support them further.  So if you want this videos to keep coming then just keep watching them and buy merchandise if you can.
I genuinely think I might cut back on eating beef.. if we all did maybe we could actually start to make a difference
When is your metaverse launching? Learning will take a huge leap.
feeding the global population is responsible for ~25% of emmisions, while 100 companies are responsible for over 70% of global emissions by themselves
I bet that the bad points for beef are gonna be used as an argument by vegans(not all), and completely neglect the other points being pointed out here.
If 25% food emission would makes carbon budget run out by 2100.   Then the rest 75% will make carbon budget run out by 2050.  Shouldn't we focusing on the other stuff?
even if meat is bad or not u cant say no to a juicy steak
"Food is a real driver of climate change," let's change it to, "too many people is THE real driver of climate change." Love you Kurzgesagt!
If we all did switch to veganism would there be a repercussions because of the massive monocultures that would have to be made to feed everyone?
Earth is doomed to be destroyed
Average salary - 190$ 1kg of beef - 6$. Problem solved.
No other bodily pleasure enjoys multiple times a day and never gets old huh challenge accepted.
Thank you so much Kurzgesagt this is super informative. We sould solve this meat problem with cell meat. A type of meat were you take a cell from an animal put it into a lab and let it multiply until it becomes a chunk of meat. Since this meat dose not have a brain it could be a Humane and green way to produce meat
Pure propaganda.... kruzkusatz done a shit job on research for this one
What about LAB GROWN MEATS carbon footprint ? Seems to be a good solution in theory !!
Food🤤🤤
*Just law to equal co2 creation an year to co2 used an year*

Climate Change Activists vs Animal Rights Activists
10 out of 10 Doctors agree that food is the best cure for hunger.
Why don't we develop carbon sucking delicious grass for cows
This video is misleading due to false equivalences. Comparing CO2e emissions from food to fossil fuels is wrong. CO2e emission sources should be categorised and compared as such. For example sorting them into reversible, irreversible and cyclic.   A reversible example from your sources would be: "Converting that land released a lot of carbon into the atmosphere. All those historical emissions sum up to about 1400 billion tonnes of CO2. Therefore, we could technically regrow forests and put a big chunk of that 1400 billion tonnes of CO2 back into vegetation, with diet changes or improvements in farming practices."   Irreversible is burning fossil fuels. (Ignoring carbon capture technology)  Cyclic is simply sources that fall into the carbon cycle. (Nitrous oxide has atmospheric half life of 114 years and methane of 12 years)  All these categories have an impact on the climate but should be treated differently (*Note: I am unsure of how to phrase the justification apart from how they are defined and how we should look at solutions to problems caused by them). Statements such as: "Actually, transport and packaging combined are only about 11% of all food emissions." have compared all three categories. Statements such as "We can emit only another 1405 billion tonnes until 2100 in order to keep the temperature rise below 2°C with a 67% chance. If we were to keep the annual food emissions for another 80 years, we would emit 1356 Gt in total until 2100." are also unclear of the type of emissions which are being talked about, as just above that you have stated the 1400 billion tonnes is reversible.   I also have a problem with 'net' carbon emission due to possible blurring of the source of carbon. While I mostly enjoy Kurzgesagt videos as they often give a great starting point for further conversation on the topic, this one to me has obfuscated how I would like environmental conversation to occur.
I guess it's less steak and more bacon then! For the environment!
I'm a big fan of meat, & raise my own chickens for meat, & eggs.  I'd say, meat stays, just get rid of the large meat cattle industry's, & have them do full pastured Beef, & allow forest patches to exist in the farm land. But fenced in to keep predators out.
Lets also remember that this is hard to put on the consumer under capitalism. Meat is cheap, being vegetarian or vegan is expensive.
I love your videos, but this one seemed kinda...manipulative. I generally agree that people should try to eat less meat, I eat meat myself and try to eat less of it. The amount of resources dedicated to farming meat could be spent on just growing cereals, which keep longer, and since they don't have to go through an animal, we would retain more energy. Solving world hunger and reducing consumption of meat IMO go hand in hand. I agree and accept most of the statistics being presented in the video. But, there were some things that I noticed which I find disingenuous. The most prominent example I noticed is at @9:20.   "If we spared 3 billion hectares of land, we could remove 800 billion tonnes of CO2, over 100 years. By comparison, we emit about 50 billion tonnes per year"  800 tonnes of CO2 over 100 years is 8 tonnes of CO2 per year that we would be able to reduce. So what that means is, if we swap to an entirely vegan diet (that was the condition for 3 billion instead of 2 billion of free space), we would reduce out CO2 footprint by 8 tonnes per year, out of 50. Don't get me wrong, 8/50 is close to 20% and a 20% reduction in our carbon footprint is incredibly significant and a lot of people would find it worthwhile to pursue.  But the graphics they chose to show were 100% misleading and  made it seem like swapping to a vegan diet would remove 800/50 times the amount of CO2. Why show the two graphs side by side when 1 has a timeframe of a 100 years while the other has a timeframe of 1? Thats manipulative and taken right out of the book "How to Lie with Statistics". You don't need to manipulate the graphics to push a narrative, the truth of a 20% reduction in emissions is already extremely good, who wouldn't think that was a good outcome? There's no need to put the number 800 besides 50 to make us feel like swapping to a vegan diet has a much bigger impact that it actually would.
oh no, the beef stonks
We should eat less meat but higher quality meats.  For instance i bought a meat package from a farmer who buys/adopts young bulls from the dairy industry that otherwise would be killed and discarted because they are a breed that is not fast growing so not wanted by the beef industry, they raise them for 2 or 3 years on grass only and then butcher them for the meat. It is more expensive but locally grown and only fed grass from their own pasture.     And what was not mentioned in the video is that raising cattle in the field with manure and urine going directly on the field saves a lot of methane in the atmosphere because of the actions with Hydroxyl radical that are formed by photolysis of water on the fields they walk on, that particle reacts with Methane and breaks it down into  H2o and CH3  and reacts with things like Nitrus Oxide or Oxigen from there on to more harmless gasses and CO2.
Beef stonks yes
sponsored by bill gates
I believe starting around 3:50 "kg of CO2eq" should be "g of CO2eq" (maybe). Eg. 4:40 , trucking 1kg of Beef emitting 18kg of CO2eq is about 5kg of gasoline or about 6.2L or 1.6gallon(US). That is way too high unless I am missing what equivalent means.
Just eat chicken ffs, it's the best meat anyway
Whenever climate changed is addressed without mentioning the roll the sun plays in the planet's temperature fluctuations it's hard to take the conversation seriously.  Considering how much the sun effects the climate on Earth it should at least be mentioned as a foot note anytime the topic is brought up. It helps keep things in perspective.
Please make a video on space stuff
This particular topic is a huge waste of time, because everyone pulls percentages oit of their asses.  You go to one research paper and it says that energy/oil industries are responsible for +90% of world pollutants/emissions.  You go to another research paper, and now that is 60-70%.  Just last week I was on reddit and someone shared an article that said it was around 50%.  So basically, this whole topic is a waste of time. I'll throw in my own opinion; keep eating what you like to eat as the bulk of research clearly suggests that whatever food you choose to consume has virtually a minimal effect on the world's climate. It's the big energy corps that cause the vast majority of it and paid too many publications to divert focus away to individuals, and climate hippies ate it all up.  Even here the stats aren't exactly the most agreed upon, but who knows who's right.
The solution is: we should start to learn self photosynthesis
Yes - modern consumption of meat (e.g., eating it 3 times a day every day) relies on treating animals horribly to fulfil the demand.  People make up excuses to justify that animals are inferior, dumber, don't feel pain - these are all coping mechanisms to avoid the obvious - it's not sustainable to eat meat in the quantities that we do today.
You ignored coffee and chocolate, worse for CO2 than almost all meat products except for beef
Goats. The answer is goat meat and milk! Look it up - goats are one of the most ecologically friendly domesticated meat animal.
U
I still suck it 🤷‍♂️
Basically what ive learned is that climate change is inevitable, there is 0 way to stop it without us going extinct sure we can lower it, but lowering it wont matter, one day, humans will die, and another animal will take up the mantle of consciousness.
what about the lab grown meet
This way  of analysis is irrelevant and bullshit speculation like this will never give a solution.
I’m a huge fan of yours and I love your videos keep up the good work
I care for animals usually
80% of consumers are women, maybe they should consume less for climate change. they dont need hundreds of pairs of shoes and thousands of different things to wear. now that is something no one talks about.
For me its not about climate its about feelings and emotions of animals .
someone needs to figure out how many times "it's complicated" has been said across this channel.
Fish?
I am brazilian and this subject means a lot to me. It is very sad what is happening in president Bolsonaro administration. He fought every iniciative to conserve the forest. People are being killed for trying to protect it. The Amazon its burning and we already can feel the results in a form of a severe drought in south / southeast of Brazil, because rains that were supposed to come from the forest simply doesn't come anymore. And its hard to see that most brazilians doesn't even acknowledge the link between the two things.
What a shame, *proceeds to bite cheese burguer*
What about lab grown beef?
My main question for these statistics is where does the carbon come from? It's coming out of the herbaceous plants and soil, which receive their carbon from the air. So are these numbers out of cycle carbon emissions like fossil fuels or in cycle? Because I think in cycle carbon emissions can be safely ignored, which is why I'm skeptical of many claims made about food production emissions, even plant based foods. I'm certain beef has more out of cycle emissions than feeding a human corn and soy, but are both far lower than estimated?
Please read up on regenerative agriculture from people like Joel salantin, better for the animal and the world
The takeaway is, you'll pollute no matter what you do. You wanna "save the planet"? Stop existing. :)
Bro
Ight I'm gonna go eat a steak
good vid, Never disappoints  (:
I don't know if I could go vegan. But cutting out just beef is very doable.
The score for this episode was TOO good. I was trying to learn bus couldn't help but vibe to the background tracks.
I feel like this video gave a poor view on meat by ignoring things like vat grown meat, as well as the issues vegan and vegetarian diets pose to humans. The dangers of mono-cropping, as well as the need in the human diet for certain proteins were also left out of this discussion. You can't answer the question, "Is meat really bad?" Without looking at all aspects of the issue.
If it feels good, do it..! I'm now a raw food vegan..! 😁😁
I would love a video on fish

One suggestion I've heard for greening-up Beef production is shifting from feeding cows grasses like corn to feeding them seaweed, which has been demonstrated to result in much less methane (because it's easier for them to digest).  I don't know if it's remotely feasible to farm seaweed at the kind of scale we'd need to replace the crops we currently feed them, but that definitely seems like a possibility worth studying - if it would work, we'd have the added benefit of reducing the amount of land needed for crops.
the sun controls our climate..
Meat is really good for us humans!!! Good for our brains,good for our hearts,good for our reproduction,just plain good for us!!
So the answer is yes.
the thing you forgot to add in your speech is the soy part the animals eat cant be used or eaten by humans it same with maze corn and other plants the harvest what humans can digest and use then waste is given to animals if not their would be methane problem as it breaks down
The least complicated solution is to just cut out meat or at least all of it but poultry
Thanks for the video.
What if we just delete cows permanently?
Go vegan guys
I'm glad you've been honest on meat and it's impact. Please people, be plant-based.
NOOOO THE CELL
epidemiology vs interventional data. vegans will always lose in this regard. meat eating makes us human
Well, great! Now I want a fat juicy all beef burger!
Just putting the info out there, nice 👍🏾 good video!
Sadly I can't go vegan/ vegitarian since I'm already severely iron efficient and taking out a source of iron will only make it worse.
We people of India has known this since millennium 😂, odd that it took western science so long to realize that nature is not something to use for your entertainment and satisfying the pleasure, it's something to be worshipped and should be taken care of. Don't abuse only use.
I did not see fish mentioned at all.  What's the environmental foot print of eating fish?
I like it that they used a little bit of memes to explain stuff
Is Meat Really that Bad? (too long; didn't watch: Hell yes!)
If you want to help the planet, just stop having kids.
We need to stop killing animals for food.  If you don’t think eating meat is a good idea visit a feed lot or a slaughterhouse. You’ll change your mind immediately.
I feel like humans are failing to realize how close we are to killing ourselves out with pollution.
You forgot kangaroo for low emissions
That's cool and all, but I don't care Beef me up
We’re that new immune system video!!!!!
at 9:04 did you say that just eliminating beef from my diet i get 2/3 of the land use saving benefit of going full vegan? even if i replace the beef with other meat?
can you make video about workout?
that information on ship vs road emissions shocked me like hell
The real problem is overpopulation. And that's all there is to it.  This planet has too many shit apes called humans.  Think  about this. if ONE BILLION people, yes, ONE BILLION, people died in China, their population would still be MORE than the United States.  And the combined population of just TWO countries, India and China, is currently more than the ENTIRE WORLD'S population was less than 70 years ago.
Kurgesagt when he makes a politcal video: "Its complicated"
As a follow-up to this video, I'd like to challenge Kurzgesagt to create a diet plan for humans which gives us every vitamin and mineral (especially good ol' B12) AND which significantly lowers the carbon footprint, using only natural ingredients (no test-tube ingredients), since many people have allergies and gastrointestinal sensitivities to artificial foods and ingredients.  For instance, a large subset of the population (people with wheat-induced migraines, Crohn's Disease, Celiac's Disease, and Ulcerative Colitis) cannot tolerate wheat and many similar grains. Many people are lactose intolerant, a decent amount of people are allergic to peanuts, etc. Find for me a diet which will keep over 95% of the world's population alive without leaving a significant carbon footprint. I'm curious to see if it's even possible. Also I noticed that beef was compared to a veggie patty, rather than to bison or some other similar meat. I'm curious what the difference is.
I live in Brazil. Here we don't consume beef very often cause we cant even afford it anyway. Most of the beef production goes do China for a cheap price, meanwhile we pay 1/10 of a minimum wage for a noble cut.
China made the rest of CO2. And we can not eat meat anymore?????????????
What about the health argument shown at the beginning of the video!!
besoyds
if you have hydroponic you won't need fertilizer heck you won't need soil!
I'd like to have seen a US produced Beyond Meat patty eaten somewhere in Europe, versus a locally farmed beef patty.
Go vegan.
I'm going to decide not to eat pork. Just beef and chicken. I can cut pork on my diet and never liked sausage and bacon anyway.
I've met the younger generations and I assure you, I'm not giving up a thing to ensure THOSE brats have a planet in 50 years.
LIE LIE LIE
Yeah so.... Lets just focus on the beef while the world gets depopulated of the real problem. You know its coming!
5:23 why would you do this? why would you say it like that?
I WILL EAT MEAT EVERYDAY.
This video forgot to include the argument of how different the waste that is thrown away is from plant vs meat can produce and how manure helps grow crops.
Wow what a shill bootlicking channel ... *Propaganda* at its finest

While picking up stuff for Thanksgiving dinner last week, I was struck by how crazy it is that I have such a wide, varied selection of high-quality food just five minutes from where I live, available year-round and 24 hours a day, for honestly a very small price relative to my personal means.  As someone who's both hunted and grown my own produce, it's no trivial thing.  Human society simply wouldn't exist without organized and highly-developed systems for producing and distributing food; it's at the very core of who we are as a species.  My only gripe with this video is that the comparison at 9:21 is a tiny bit misleading and could have used 10 seconds or so more playtime to put things in context, but it's not that hard to pause the video for a couple seconds to digest it.  Personally, I've been cutting back on meats - especially beef and processed meats - quite a bit over the last few years since learning these and other facts.  Partly for the environment, partly for health (my iron levels tend to run high and heavy consumption of processed meats has been linked to health problems in the long term).  No plans at all to go full vegetarian or vegan; I still enjoy me a good burger or steak on occasion.  But moving red meat & sausage from a dietary staple to an occasional treat really wasn't that tough to do.
Eating each other is demoniac.if you act like animal whare is the difference between you and a animal.
What about farmers using Kudzu to feed cows? Any research on that
Killing of innocent animals to satisfy the taste buds is bad. Producing 1 kg of meat requires thousands of litres of water, huge land and cause large CO 2 emissions. Alternative can be lab grown meat, which will be available in next 10 - 15 years.
This might be fake, but i read somewhere that if humans hadn't started eating meat millions of years ago, our brains wouldn't have developed properly and would have been really small compared to our current brain size due to lack of many nutrients
If you confess Jesus as Lord and believe He was raised from the dead you will be saved. Romans 10:9
So you talked about cutting down forests for animal farms and plant farms but wasn’t there research done how younger crops such as corn and other main food plants consume more emissions and produce more oxygen than older plants such as forests?
Long time fan of the channel disappointed for the second time - 2nd video about meat and once again not ONE MENTION of regenerative agriculture. You used to be unbiased - what happened?
I don't care cows are DUMB and I will eat them.
Next topic: "Is air bad for you?"
What if we somehow made food...optional? 🤔
Could you do a video on commercial fishing and It's impact on the world? Maybe draw some comparisons between it and the meat industry? I've watched a documentary on netflix called Seaspiracy and even though its very good and educational there are a lot of numbers and facts to take in, I would love a Kurzgesagt video on it! You don't really hear much about it either so I bet a lot of people would be interested to learn more on it!
the vast majority of cow methane is in the form of belches, not farts.
The most incredible thing about your videos is how you ALWAYS manage to improve the videos' quality even when it looks like you can't go any further. The work and care you put to make these amazing videos is really worth acknowledging and appreciating. Keep it up, guys, what you do is incredible!!
I hate the title of this episode, I thought it would be about the nutrients/diet inclusion of grass fed beef vs going vegetarian, not including "for global warming" in the title is very missleading
now that i think about it, if its all about freeing up land and having industry completely replace nature for a natural ecosystem and healthy world. than was ted kaczynski right about returning to primitive times? maybe he was on to something
Damn. I love meat. We're totally screwed
5 years ago, I told all these to myself, and since then I am Vegan.
I think it would be pretty awesome if they could do a video with "tips" to be more eco-friendly. As someone that is trying to be more eco-friendly there are way too many misconceptions out there about a lot of things Also if any viewers have any channels to recommend that combine science with enviromentalism, that'd be amazing
eu definitivamente não estou feliz do nosso pais ser mencionado dessa vez 6:25
Cow Farts

While factory meat production might be more efficient, we then start to enter disease prevention territory and overuse of antibiotics. Especially if it's just being given to all livestock rather than targeted at individual animals. Which, in turn, could lead to super diseases resistant to many common forms of treatment when pathogens become zoonotic, transferring between species. sounds familiar.  Also I'd love to see an exploration on the development and sustainability of lab grown meat and if it could ever be cost effective. What could make that harder, at least in America, are the tax dollars for grants sent to meat production lowering the cost of meat even further than it would otherwise be.
When veganism was coined, we hadn't even isolated vitamin b12 yet. If we don't know how the entire cell works yet, how do we know we aren't missing nutrients when we start restricting our diets? For now I say everything in moderation.
Succeeded in making me hungry lol
I love how Kurzgesagt provide us all with free yet valuable content. Thank you guys for sharing this info.
Damn, everyone in the comments knows more than the scientists listed in the sources dock, don't they?
How much land would need to be cleared if everyone ate a vegan diet maintaining enough nutrients and calories? I feel like it would still be a lot
Dislike
This video's environment cost calculation is completely wrong. The most costly "meat" is cannibalism.
The whitetail deer I just harvested was carbon neutral.
Not sure if anyone has tried this yet, but what about creating a smaller breed of cow that takes less resources and land?
metteranalysis  oof
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old" that's where I disagree
I’m a little disappointed in how skipped over the impact of grass fed beef on methane emissions. Cows only emit methane because their stomachs are not meant to digest anything but grass and cows are fed soy and corn.   Ruminant animals have lived on this earth for a long time yet all of the sudden now they’re being blamed for climate change? As long as they’re pastured on land that wasn’t burned down and they’re fed grass, they won’t cause as much emissions. Also, beef produced this way would be more expensive and people would eat less of it
All of theses are why I stopped meat 18 years ago, I know it taste good but common, your self pleasure isn't worth the life of thousands in the future
Omg this video is so well made and so well needed, thank you. I've found it difficult to go into the details of food production, plus I didn't have exact figures off hand, this is way better for communicating the need to challenge dietary changes. And the continuity of the little bird in the beginning and the end made the instant rewatch all that more personal.
9:30 holy fucking shit
The one thing that keeps me from going vegan, is the fact that I've jumped into lifting weights as a serious hobby.  I know it's not impossible to eat a protein-rich vegan diet....but it is extremely difficult. There's very few protein rich vegan foods that are low in carbs and fats, so I would need to supplement with powders....which I'm not in a financial position to do.  It sucks, because climate change is a cause I care about, but I also don't want to give up a hobby that I enjoy because of it.
I know it's unlikely for anyone to see this, but I really love the channel. It can be depressing sometimes, but I dream of creating things similar to this. You guys are awesome and I love the channel!
Wondering about lab grown meat. We know it's not even close to sustainable now but could it be? What kind of challenges would there be to implementing this on a global scale assuming we have the technology?
FDA website states that the number of livestock has only increased by 5% since the 40s. What's different is farming methods and cattle feed that has increased beef yield with minimal increase in methane emissions. Methane breaks down into CO2 after decades, and plants take the CO2 to build cellulose cells and carbs which cattle and humans consume. It's a closed loop  where no new carbon is introduced, if you don't count the idiot governments allowing the burning of forests for more farmland in developing nations.  Think about it logically. Cows fart methane, where does the carbon in methane come from? Plants! And where do plants get carbon? From CO2, during the day, and plants release O2 in return. Humans exhale CO2, where does the carbon come from? Our food! It's a closed loop.  What we should focus on is fossil fuel which releases millenia old carbon back into the atmosphere. I sincerely believe this is all actually big oil drumming up a scapegoat to divert attention away from this fact. Millions of tonnes of crude oil that has remained safely sequestered underground now gets pumped up and burnt for energy. This is not a closed loop.
What exactly is the best beef though? Should we go for 100% grass fed, or the cheapest factory farmed beef? The video seems indecisive on this point as they both have their upsides. But there's got to be something you used as the benchmark for that ultra low beef carbon number, what is it?
I want to weaponize that information, now teach me how
Great video as always guys.
I am curious as to whether the carbon sequestered by cattle manure becoming part of soil for a long time was considered in these numbers?
Can you make a video about what would happen to the world if humans didn't exist
What about what fishing and hunting it won’t be as much current monoxide
Without watching, no. Meat isn't that bad. Animals eat other animals all the time. However, destroying the environment for the sake of meat is a problem and we should definitely be trying to curb that. Screw all the militant vegans and vegetarians out there. It's ya boy grah55 you know.
So beef, McDonalds and America need to disappear.
Thanks for the info.  I'm still going with a meat heavy diet.
imagine the human body only needed calories and "protein".  Gluttony is never a good thing but haven't people already tried being vegan and failed badly?  Cultures who eat little meat have developed a tradition of eating several plant based protein to make up one complete protein required by the human body.  Point is that It's doable but it certainly isn't as simple as replacing grams of meat protein with equivalent grams of plant base protein.  You know what's also good for the environment?  Stop driving, work from home, stop using things that require electricity, stop throwing things out so we can produce less new things.  Too difficult?  yeah I agree, lets just go after the "bad" people.
As a vegetarian, this is the one Kurzgesagt video in a while that didn't make me feel terrible about myself. Nice try, Kurzgesagt!
Meats is a basic human rights.
I dont think people are going to stop eating meats popular to our various cultures. And while we will likely solve the vast majority of emissions through tech, this last bit, the agriculture + certain manufacturing remnants, will likely have to be addressed with carbon capture technologies utilizing renewable power. Imo
I hate humanity so much.
Red meat (beef, pork, lamb) contains sialic acid, which causes inflammation in the body. Avoid red meat. Dairy foods also contain sialic acid.
Wonderful video as always! Love your work so much. Thanks.
Your portrayal of Brazil was like 80% Venezuela lol
A lot of the grain used for feed for animals is grain that doesn’t meet standards for human consumption. Wheat for example is grown for making things such as flour however if the moisture and protein levels aren’t right then it can’t be used, it is at this point where it is sold for feed at a lower price
"Could the title be ANY longer?"  Chandler Bing
My pros for eating meat: It's Delcious.
There's a lot more value in meat then "calories", try living on a plant based diet for a month and tell me how you feel. I have nothing against vegetarians or vegans, but anyone claiming that a meatless diet is as healthy for you as one that includes meat is either trying to sell you something or making an emotional argument. Food isn't just calories.
We should seriously consider revolutionize alge farms if we want to subsidize all of humanity’s food and fuel needs.
good thing i don't have tast for beef
I love how you easily tell that the quality of the videos get insanely better
Most of the food used to feed cattle is corn. However, the carbon flux for cropland (including corn) is a net emission of 9.4 metric tons of CO2 per 100 acres, compared with the carbon flux of grassland with a net sink of 1.4 tons of CO2 per 100 acres. That's the reason why holistically planned grazing has been proposed as a viable alternative.
Excellent video. I had no idea that beef's impact was so much worse than other meats. Limiting my meat consumption for the sake of the climate is one thing that I have long wanted to do, but have never been able to do. Eating less beef and more climate-friendly meats is a good first step that I can take though.
climate change isn't real lol
This has made me hungry for a nice succulent steak....
was that made in direct response to "eating less meat wont save the planet"
I guess just eating LESS of beef and lamb would go a long way ?
It would be great if we could replicate in a lab the grass to protein synthesis happening inside cows stomachs. Then, we could capture any methane produced by the bacteria to be used as an additional fuel source.
I'd love to learn more about Dairy products and their relation with climate change. Maybe something like the difference of the impact of being vegan or vegetarian.
I’d give up on meat any day as long as there is affordable semi similar alternative plant based meats. As well as them being accessible.
this video paired well with a grassfed flank steak smothered in butter and herbs.
This makes me sad.
to be fair the carbon footprint of food is probably blown up somewhat by how much food is produced only to never even be consumed before disposal
"you can consider for yourself what to do with this information" yeah I'm gonna take the burgie every time
WE HAVE COVID BECAUSE OF THE ANIMAL INDUSTRY. The science is solid...stop being selfish.
I think grasslands also have more stored carbon or sequester more carbon than forests. So grazing animals there is worse, from a climate change perspective.

I don't care if it's healthy, it's tasty.
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED!!!! The science is solid...ya'll just being selfish.
I really enjoy your videos, but I wish this one would have dug in a little deeper on the subject. That analysis of "bad" was only in reference to climate change. It would be very helpful to also get some facts on how these types of diets would affect humans - if taking meat away has a long-lasting effect (for good or bad). Hope you can make a second part about this.
Yes.
Kurzgesagt after thowing so much bad facts about eating cow meat : But Isn't it a bit out of touch with reality to demonize cows so much? Ye i love milk too :-;
I could really go for a cheeseburger right about now
Anyone else find the idea of lab grown meat disturbing. It’s gonna be just another way these big companies get money, also we as people are genetically engineered to need protein. Not against fake meat being an option I just don’t want it being the only option
Let me eat my beef
Two things you left out: water consumption from cows is much more efficient than with plants because most of the water that the drink is rain water that goes into the ground and into crops. Secondly: a lot of crops are fed to cows yes, but the stuff fed to them is the stuff we can’t eat anyway, like the stalks of soy. These are some big factors that shouldn’t be left out and I’m disappointed you didn’t put them in your video as it makes a big difference on the argument.
The real problem ist overpopulation. More and more humans want more of everything.
The immediate solution would be to replace all meat based products with plant based or synthetic meat averting the need of a total food choice change. In the long term we need to eat only as much as necessary, strictly observing the calories required as astronauts do in space. For that specialized high-nutrient + cheap food options need to be available. Climate change is gonna hit us hard sooner than we can expect, the number of people willing to contribute will definitely increase. We just need right education, right options and right marketing. Thank you Kurzgesagt- this is really important. We need more contents on solutions to climate change.
The grassland cows live are unproductive because they destroy it by trampling. Some of them are hills which would not be effective to plant crops, but it's not the case of most of the Amazon being burn to support cattle
Fact: Everyone that has eaten meat has died.
I'm open to the idea of alternatives that taste and feel like beef.
Every day that Kurzgesagt releases a new video is a good day.
Don't let all of this make you forget that the whole food industry is much less responsible for acceleration of climate change in comparison to fosil fuel industry
What's worse for the environment; being a beef eater, or having a child?
I believe in eating less animal products, but vegan isn't really the way to go Would elaborate further, but, don't want to cause argument
this video is sponsor by "George Soro's Eat the Bugs" TM
this was a bit too biased towards vegetarian food when it doesn't even mention the increased demand of nutrition crops from meat free diets, or the distinct lower quality of vegetarian food replacement. it also doesn't mention that the methane produced by cattle is repurposed towards the fertilizer used to grow their food in the first place, reducing the net carbon output considerably. the start that says food is important feels like a token effort at being unbiased rather then a real attempt.
I wish they could Vat grow steak in labs
This is not what I expected lmao
Vat-grown meat for the win.
this video tasks about the admistion which come from producing food but its not taking into consideration that the food might not even get eaten and put into a bin instead wasting all of the time and rescores that where needed to create and transport the food in the first place( like if you agree ) =)
Only problem I see is that must be a huge country/state go vegan so the production "slows down" because if not like if my friend is only buying vegan stuff, I'm still buying meat or someone else will buy it double so that's the catch for me
Not accurate that Brazil burns forest to grow cows
Congrats ! Complicated subject very well treated, thanks 🙏
I hate how some vegans say "you can't be a true animal lover if you eat animals" that's bs, that means you can't be a true plant lover if you eat plants. Their logic is flawed
no matter how many times I'm mentioned, overpopulation is NEVER addressed as the reason behind all the problems we have in the world.
Greg
A good video as always, can't help but think you should replace the word meat with beef in the title. I like how you take into account the protein, I would like if you raised the nutrient value a bit more. People who don't eat any meat need to take supplements so wonder how these emissions added to the plants would look? Also what about lab grown meat or eating insects? Would be good if there was a part 2! Keep up the good work.
When it comes to animal cruelty, I'm not a fan of treating pork and beef in such inhumane ways. Poultry however, having extensive experience with chickens, I genuinely don't care. These domesticated chickens are dumb as a brick and they honestly couldn't care less about anything.
Meat is bad since it requires for us to commit genocide of other sentient species that are actually capable of feeling pain, stress and love just because of the fact that they are tasty and not inteligent enough to defend themselves against us, I understand that someone living in the artic has to hunt seals to feed him and his family but I dont understand why someone can defend meat in a first class country with plenty of cheap and valid food options
The cow with heart-shaped eyes reminded me of the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, about a cow that wants to be eaten.
In the Netherland, we kill grass & farm land to plant forests.  But stil we have less forests.. Because they make industry and heath and peat land of is .. Politic's sucks
I mostly eat fish and pork skins, will there be a follow up video for other kinds of meat?
I've lost all meaning for your videos. You'd think it'd start of as meat is bad for your health especially beef blah blah blah. No it's eat meat and world will die. How can anyone take you serious anymore
Got it.  I will eat beef once a month Pork and chicken once a week Dairy sometimes
Oooo the vegan teacher not gonna like this
“No their bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day”  People coming out of No Nut November: Hi
Someone needs to show this video to the guy from the "What I've Learned" channel
I object: You are bordering on the "false cause fallacy" when you attribute the destruction of forests/land use solely to farming. Other forms of human expansion contribute to that, and some contribute quite a bit. I would like numbers to see how much farming land use has expanded compared to other things. This objection is not meant to imply the argument is wrong (that would be the fallacy fallacy if I did that), just that is weaker than it could be otherwise.  so what's the solution? Can we capture all the cattle farts somehow and use them for power? They are methane after all... there must be a way to harness it!
To the point, and no sugar coating. Well said and done.
I'm actually doing an assignment on climate change this term and this just popped up in my recommended lol
Meat and your bill gates vaccine and bread and alcohol are as bad as they come ,  My middle finger to you and all of the stuff your propagandist puppet master engorces on everyone *
You really dont have a clue of how Brazil handles its enviroment...
That was very helpful! I eat meat but I’m totally on board with the wonder burger thing. When they perfect that I got no problem giving up ‘real’ meat.  I look forward to the Hitler comparisons from vegans in the reply section.
You guys are on trending upon every upload, you're THAT freaking good.
Let's be honest: a plant-based diet is dramatically superior in the modern world. It's healthier, it's cheaper to produce both in terms of natural resources and money, and it has less environmental impact. You can hedge around these facts with your "whataboutisms" all you would like, but every single statistic supports these facts. Eating animal products is about the taste and nothing else. Those who consume animal products are trading off all of the advantages of a plant-based diet for a taste experience. Even the argument about animals turning crops we can't eat (grasslands) into food we can falls flat when you consider that if animal agriculture was wiped from the planet tomorrow and all of the land used for grazing was left fallow, we would still be able to produce THREE TIMES enough plant-based food to feed the ENTIRE world (i.e. every single person) with just the arable land and technology that we have RIGHT NOW, largely because we would be able to use the land for "feed crops" to produce human-consumable crops. I know that Kurzgesagt works hard to produce a balanced, science-based approach to big questions, but the answer to this one is actually very simple based on data that we have collected for decades: meat really is that bad, and we should stop consuming it immediately. Does this mean that we should send jack-booted thugs around to take away all the hamburgers? Of course not. However, that doesn't change the answer to the question.
Man i hate to say it but i kinda want a burger now.
Two better and easier solutions:  1. Grow nutrient dense vegetarian food like Spirulina and Quinoa  2. Replace industrial agriculture with permaculture.
Eat a burguer
Man made climate change is not real
So to save the world I shouldn't support my local community farmers? I should buy battery meat from overseas? Ahhhh No thank you.
Dislike  this is globomarxist propaganda
Nah i need meat plant more trees, grow mega plants that will grow everywhere, lets get the moon spinning 30x faster and convert minerals on the moon to oxygen,carbon,nitrogen, hydrogen. transform it for a billion people.
Gee. Well… I’m vegetarian
Thank you for creating
I wish this existed when I was in high school
Shame on your cow
We dont' want to upset meat lovers so we will pretend we are not taking sides. But all the info provided supports the idea of meat being an ecologic cathastrophe. So. Reality takes sides, how you dare, you stupid leftist biased reality!!
8:20 I suspect this to be somewhat false. Yes, we feed cattle with crops that we harvest, but I'm pretty sure that's mainly the part of the crop that we don't eat. We eat the seeds/corn on the crops, but the rest of the crops is pretty much just grass that we would throw away. That type of unedible grass from the crops is what we mostly feed animals with (I'm pretty sure at least).
Great information here, as always! I would love to see something about hunting in the future. I live rurally, where hunting, fishing, gardening, and even foraging for things like berries and mushrooms is part of our lives, and I'm curious how much of a difference is made by harvesting directly from nature. I imagine it must be significant! I'd also like to mention that rabbit is one of the most sustainable meats as far as farm raised animals go. They eat almost exclusively dried grass, their poop is fantastic natural fertilizer, they grow and reproduce quickly, and they take up very little space (even when kept totally ethically). It's a shame they're so cute - that's the only reason we don't see them in grocery stores!
Good Stonks
You didn't answer a really big question about the actual alternatives. According to the current growing world population - is that actually possible to feed the entire world with plant-based diet if we will use the whole croplands for humans? This is the big issue here.
Something that didnt quite seem to be addressed. The last climate change focused video seemed to indicate that the only sensible path forward was MASSIVE investment in carbon capture and storage. Is there a reason that carbon capture and storage doesn't solve the ecological impact of the meat industry too?
Me: Enjoying video My Brain: Hey, change every "food" and "meat" to "sex" hehe
Great video, but what about the way beef and other animal meat (and agriculture products) are produced in a large scale just so it can be commercialized, not really to feed the population? Most of all the products goes to waste, we make way more than what the population needs, i assume. I'm from Brazil, and the actual situation is: people are starving, local markets are profiting from literal garbage (they sell bones and pieces that, formerly, would be discarded) and yet the great farmers keep their stocks in the refrigerators and give extra unremunerated vacations to their employees so the prices don't drop. I think it's about the money and the individual choice doesn't play a big role in the climate change situation.  I'm i wrong? I really want to know.
Keeping more than 7 billion humans on a planet is torture, it's unsustainable on the long run. Even if everyone were vegan, CO2 crisis arrives by 2100.  So, what can we do against the inevitable? Diet won't do the trick.
in spanish pls :(
"No other bodily pleasure is experienced multiple times a day, and never gets old"    Allow me to introduce teenage me
If meat we're to go away 25% of all jobs in Nebraska would be lost, we need a man who will fight for packing and ranch related jobs.
There is nothing wrong with eating meat. It's our need. But, the thing that make it wrong is the greed when eating it. It's too delicious, people can't have enough of it.
I've been watching y'all for year's but I just realized that I wasn't subbed
I think cows need to take one for the team and let us regrow all those forests
Considering we’ve likely already polluted more co2 than we can afford, even if we went carbon neutral today, i’d love to see a video on carbon capture methods.
Truly unfortunate how efficiency in terms of climate change and demand comes at the cost of animal welfare. Time to learn some new recipes I suppose.
I think an important part of the discussion around beef that was left out is desertification. we know that grasslands can be regenerated and deserts turned to grasslands by properly managing and herding cattle. this is largely caused by seasonal migrations of the animals, in a similar pattern to what exists with wildebeests or used to exist in the great plains with the huge herds of bison. they redistribute the nutrients from the grass and the seeds as well, in addition to feeding the vvarious other animals in the area, like predators, bugs, and all that. so where we have food deserts emerging next to factory farmed animals in a tighly controlled space, we see the evidence that in general that there is a mismanagement of the animals and land. properly managing cattle to reverse desertification could massively offset the carbon cost of cattle in the first place and regenerate ecosystems which act as carbon sinks
The future is VEGAN
Eat meat every day.
No. Im not going vegan. I dont want to turn i to an insufferable bore.
I for one have no intentions of giving up meat. But eating more pork chicken, a little less meat overall and some more vegetables certainly seems like a decent plan of action. Also you should discuss the quickly developing synthetic meat industry. Vegetable meat and lab grown meat.
1:55 you seem to forget its regenerative and if we would cut down to 50% it'd probably be enough to heal quicker than it worsens, if this is done within the next 3-5 years atleasr
Dislike
Eh, think that this video about how healthy or  unhealthy meat.... not about CO2
I expected nutritional facts.
Would you guys consider looking into permaculture? And if we can or should move forward with agriculture in this direction. I feel like there's a lot of positives especially in trapping carbon where it's useful to us and better use of water.
No mention of Nitrous Oxide, the 3rd greenhouse gas that is worse than Methane and produced by tillage practices for said vegan diet...
You forgot to consider that buying locally also effects the demand for factory products, including meat.  So it doesn't just effect transportation and packaging, but also production.   The effect would vary depending on how many switch to local, but I don't think the difference would be huge.  Nevertheless, that should also be considered when analyzing if buying local could actually lower emissions.  Also, it wasn't clear whether open pasture cows actually emit more methane than factory cows (which is more pertinent to global warming than whether open pasture is a good use against the factory).  Also, perhaps the concentration of methane within a small location must effect the environment very differently than an area such as an open pasture.  The latter could potentially be trapped or cycled through the environment more efficiently.. I dont see why buying local wouldn't have a positive, meaningful effect on lower emissions.
Food is not a driver of climate change. Energy is. If you use clean renewable energy to produce food then there are no emissions to worry about.
00:01 parosmia is like: *bruh*
Look up "return youtube dislike" if anyone reading this wants to get dislikes back on their laptop/desktop/iphone
Thats cool and all but you still need meat in your diet. Humans are omnivores not herbivores
We could use algae and meat bioreactors. It would literally fix almost every problem that is mentioned in this video.
You can take me meat... from my cold dead hand 😂 soylet green is people!!!
wrong type
So I can’t help but notice that the food situation isn’t the biggest obstacle for the amount of co2 and climate change because that 800 billion tones is over 100 years which is minuscule compared the amounts we produce every year. Not saying we can’t work on the food issue but it seems like our resources can be used somewhere else like reducing our emissions than going hard just against animal food.
Video starts, mind going : " I have zero interest in food. If if we're feasible, my diet would consist ENTIRELY of a flavourless beige smoothie containing all the nutrients required by the human animal.''
What a lot of people don’t understand is the fact that all of this does not matter if a thousand people stop buying industrialized beef or just stop eating meat in general. That’s why a lot of the time vegans and such usually speak out into the world via the internet. It’s much easier to explain the pros of veganizing your diet to an infinite amount of people than it is to one person per lecture
So much incorrect here.
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old."  *SEX: Am I a joke to you?!*
This is the only video where I'm glad that the dislike count is hidden because of people that blindly dislikes before even watching the video
That intro lmao. I hate having to feed myself every. single. day.
Comparing everything the beef which was 10x worse than other meat feels disingenuous AF. Can't see why you would do that unless you had a bias or a point to make...
I would love to see your guys’ take on holistic healing!
I think what cause the biggest impact is the qtt of co2 in soil. Forest store co2 in soil.  There are a lot misconception about how to grow plants that deeply transform an activity that could solve the co2 problem into something that aggrave it.  It is nonsense to spend fossil ernergy to grow edible calories. .. Cows are also a way to valorize failed crops btw.
i learned so much of this video, i'am buying a steak to celebrate
2:31 the music in the background is an absloute bop
Sucks that I was eating a steak while watching this 😭
Carbon "climate change" concern trolls cannot be taken seriously. They turn science into astrology for secular humanists.
Kurzgesagt as always you did a fantastic job of researching the topic. But I can't believe you called the video "Is meat really that bad?" and then only talked about the climate side of things, when BY FAR the most compelling argument against meat is animal ethics.
I’ll continue to eat meat , don’t give me shit for it
But crops and animals are part of the carbon cycle in the atmosphere. So that part of the carbon and methane were always there, even before humans existed. Methane production largely depends on the cow (and other species producing emissions) populations on the planet. If we stopped eating meat we'd lower carbon emissions, by a fixed and constant amount, when we eventually reach the next carbon cycle equilibrium. This won't clear the carbon emissions produces by burning fossil fuels.    The real problem are carbon emissions due to fossil fuels. They were not in the atmosphere before we started burning them. Burning fossil fuels even at a constant or decreasing rate accumulates carbon emissions because they are not part of the natural carbon cycle on the planet and there is no equilibrium point. Carbon emission will just grow indefinitely or at least until we mine all deposits.  Reforestation is not a complete solution either. Those new trees become part of the carbon cycle and they'll lower the carbon emissions by a fixed constant amount when the new equilibrium point is reached.   While I do agree that going vegan or at least drastically reducing meat consumption and reforestation will help in the short term (20-100 years) those are not real solutions. The real solution is to stop burning fossil fuels. But we can't do that because right now there is no alternative. We are very far from producing all our electricity in a Eco-friendly manner. Again I think a short term solution here is probably nuclear power and long term solution would be wind, tidal and solar power.
hard decision indeed here in Argentina (just for example), we consider a historically "meat" country, one of the main drivers of development in the early XX century was meat export. There is a deep cultural thing about meet, like the weekend or holiday "asado", the  folklorical "gaucho" that eats an asado in the pampas. Even is  a form of measure poverty and an healthy economy indicator: if you can afford eating meat then you are economically ok, if not you are very poor. Actually the "meme" to criticize the actual government is to use the fact that meat is rising in price so much that many people will have to eat "asado de polenta" (polenta is a dish of boiled cornmeal) (polenta is asociated with war food/poor food or cheap food). Is hard to think even to not have some kind of meat in the daily food (meatballs, beef, homemade hamburgers, milanesa, etc.). I guess many countrys has the same cultural problem (different forms). Will be hard to change....
There are too many people on this Earth.
False. For we have DDD
1:46 Ok, stop with that insanity right now. There is no way any of this is gonna work unless there is massive depopulation. And that would be evil, but not out the scope of certain people on this planet.
BEEF STONKS
soo... just eat chicken instead of beef
9:33 It seems like a really misleading comparison to show how much carbon is saved over 100 years versus how much is produced in one year. I realize this doesn't automatically invalidate the point being made, but it's a very, very bad chart, and way below Kurzgesagt's usual high quality presentation.
Why don't you consider fish and fish farming in this? Or insect farming? I'm just curious. It isn't just meat-eating or veganism. An increasing amount of people are eating a Mediterranean/pescetarian diet that makes use of fish as the main protein source. There are studies that show that crickets are one of the most eco-friendly sources of protein. Farmed salmon is less calorie dense than beef, but it can be better for you in the long run because it has lower levels of unsaturated fats and higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Tilapia grow very quickly and contain high levels of protein. Fish farming doesn't come without its own environmental risks (land usage, crop usage, runoff, etc), but it's far less than meat. Insect farming is incredibly efficient and cricket farming could easily scale to the point that cricket flour becomes an incredibly efficient way to provide calories and nutrients. You very briefly touched on the fact that potatoes take a lot less carbon to make, but you didn't mention at all that potatoes contain most of the nutrients a person needs to live, and that a person can satisfy most of their nutritional requirements by eating potatoes, black beans, and fortified grains, all of which are very low in carbon emissions. They don't have to eat fancy soy-based meat substitutes. Plenty of vegans and vegetarians eat beans, potatoes, and fortified rice and cereals and have healthy balanced diets. Many people in cultures all around the world eat mostly beans and rice as staples of their diets and have for centuries. You leave so much out in these videos that it's starting to feel deceptive to me. I wonder if it's even possible to have this entire discussion in 10 minutes at all and if you're not acutely aware of that. You leave out so much in the name of making a succinct balanced argument that fits into 10 minutes that it's almost disinformation for how narrow it makes the topic seem. Why do you even bother making these videos to "inform people" if you don't actually inform them of anything substantial? Most of what's in this video is stuff people who are interested in this topic will either already know or can easily find out with a few google searches.
this makes me feel better about being a vegetarian. i dont do it for environmental reasons tho. religious.
You will eat the soy, you will eat the bug and will get cucked. Nice propaganda and very well animated
Bullshit!!! Brazil raises most of it's cattle in the center-west and south-east regions where there is no rainforest. It's just thick and grasslands. You guys are being fed NGO propaganda backed by the european agriculture and livestock lobby. Why don't you come to Brazil check for yourselves instead of repeating lies.
You say that a lot of the land is use for animal but are you counting the transformation waste from the processing of human product that an animal can transform in a product that human can consume. Those product are like soybean meal or vegetable waste that are going to the feed lot instead of going to the garbage. Because if it count in your calculation of animal land use it's wrong because it's human use that is recycle by animals.
Dude I can’t taste because of COVID-19 thanks for rubbing it in immediately
Now make a video about how bad it is for ecology - having a car
Why do I hear boss music?      B e e  v e e e e g a n
thanks for the summary!
Anyone that tries to give this stuff a pass is akin to Gestapo working under the Nazi regime.  Dont bullshit!
I love you guys ! Your approach of data seems perfect as it is displayed it the way it should be understood.
Uhhhh... The really truly horribly painful truth is that if you feel like food is the best reason to be alive?  .... Then you are basically admitting that life just sucks and food is a coping mechanism and addiction.
One should eat balanced food and it should be fine. It kinda does 't make sense not eating meat would solve anything. People eat meat for thousands of years. If its made too much there should be new laws introduced  I have solution - we should grow cows in space
I love how this video is trending and finally getting an argument out there that is not opinionated on the subject of meat. Fantastic video as per usual from kurzgesagt 👏
In conclusion, we need to reduce human population to help the planet
Surprised there aren't any dislikes on this video. I thought this would trigger a lot of omnis.
*beef stonks*
The way we are currently doing it is wrong. That's a given.  Does that mean it can't be made right? I wouldn't say so.  I won't delve into the details, but nothing here invalidates the possibility of sustainable meat production. And nothing ever will. Why? Because there were animals grazing sustainably before we domesticated them.   Also the argument at the end is totally pointless to be honest.  1. Turning the space into "natural grassland" requires animals to graze on it, because that's how "nature" is. 2. Even if we were to "free up" the land, no one's going to take care of it. And we don't have time to just "let nature do its thing."  How about getting inspired by the cattle management that didn't cause any issue? NA had bison grazing peacefully and without causing problems for quite a while, maybe that would be a system that works?  And yes, obviously the level of meat consumption is ridiculous. And the level of waste is just as bad.
Big gaping gap in your logic. I was a vegetarian for 30 years, a vegan for the last year and a half of that. In spite of putting a lot of work into making it as well-balanced as I could, I still ended up severely malnourished. It turns out I have a number of genetic issues that interfere with my metabolism of some nutrients, especially plant-based nutrients. I become deficient in taurine, vitamin A, Omega 3 fats, among others. And I'm not alone. At least one in five people have some of the same genetics. Different cultures have had different diets which has influenced what foods they're able to eat and which they can't do without. Being a vegetarian is not an option for me any more. It was harmful to my health. Do you want to result in the death of one fifth of the people on the planet? Are you presuming to rid the planet of all the people who CAN'T eat a vegetarian diet without serious consequences? For too long now, vegans and vegetarians have presumed it's good for everyone, and they've sold it that way. But it's not. Humans did not evolve as vegetarians. It's not surprising that being vegetarian is not a species appropriate diet for everyone. Trying to change everyone to vegetarianism is a HUGE evolutionary change to our species, and one that could potentially be devastating.
I don't have to eat, so this shall not concern me. Now can someone tell me where the fruit snacks are?
Lmfao I can't believe people still believe climate change exists. 1 year it global warming the next it's climate change
If only that veggie burger didn't cost several times the cost of the beef one.
So where exactly is the problem in banning non-grass-fed cattle, and saying it can only feed on grassland that can't be better used? Yes, beef would be more expensive and scarce, but that's not a problem.
I don't believe that delivery of meat and plant is different, all deliveries have last and first mile.

One part of this that I’m not a fan of is the you decide part. Ideally that would be the case, but the vegetarians and vegans are trying their best to take the freedom of choice away from the normal people. I love my ability to choose, but it’s endangered by people who don’t care about freedom of choice.
Finally Kurzge tells the truth about the animal agriculture industry. I guess one good thing came out of Youtube hiding the dislike bar.  When your immoral and selfish diet threatens my future, and everyone else's future, it is no longer your personal choice. You are obligated to make changes.
So shouldn’t locally grown avocados also have a higher co2 foot print by this logic?
Thank you for the video! Can you please make a video about fish industry? It doesn't seem like a really bad thing and fish is also believed to be more nutritious source of energy? Thanks again!
you are such a hypocrite hiding all the important information
See I don't mind balancing my diet, because it already is balanced. I knew most of these points, but in all honestly I will not be completely dependant on meat or non-meats products. Because I am tired of getting baggered by vegans and meat eaters alike over nothing but points of pride. Because that all it is, spin anyway you want to but it has always been a point of pride. But if I am going to say which side is worse, it's the vegans! they base their entire diet on truly unsustainable products for the common customer. Whats even more infuriating the vegan diet is that they are exclusive and elitist. Making products intentionally expensive and hard to attain. Making a toxic culture from nothing more than a dietary preference! And pro meat eaters are not that much better, they take sides and draw lines, are you a vegan or not, are you a vegetarian or not. It's so ubsurd why they draw those lines that I stopped talking about My dietary preferences. But at least if I do get into a conversation about it they let me be me and not try to shame me for eating meat by using slogans like "world peace starts in our kitchen" or "my plate us green yours is blood red".    I don't know in a lot of cases vegans are in a inexcusable position of pride. They really have no serious advantages over any other diet when it comes to sustainability because as this video proves their is none! And they same pretty much everyone that doesn't 'eat' like them.
Plant-based Vegan n Vegetarians are the best diets up to now. Stop killing animals for no reason all those nutrients benefits of eating animals can be found in plants fruits n veggies n vitamins if needed. Eating animals is primitive n stupid ure not a caveman anymore, ur past generations were delayed to understand the message n u still don't want to understand animals are not here to be eaten by stupid humans. They all have feelings just like u, STOP killing them supply n demand n killing the planet at the same time. All the suffering they have to endure just bcuz stupid retarted ppl dont want to change n progress in life. U eat animals i hope u die by some kind of disease from eating them n when ure dying i hope u remember all the pain n suffering u contribute to by eating animals.
I'd like to know how lab grown meat factors in. Since it seems to be picking up steam and could be commercially viable in the next decade or so, I'm curious how that could affect all of this.
Hey @kurzgesagt can we get a q&a?
Great video as always :)
💛Would you mind pls visiting💛💛I will be glad💛💛much love💛
"Let's steak with beef". Almost missed it!
Once again we look at the problem from the wrong lens.  In 200 years we have gone from 1b people to almost 8b people.  Does the world really need 8b people?!  If any other animal did what humans do we would be trying to exterminate them as an aggressive invasive species!  Once again, its scale thats the problem.  Halve the planets population and halve our emissions.  But the current environmentalists  methods of guilting and shaming individuals will always be a failure.  Why should an individual deprive him or herself just so someone else somewhere can have more children?    I and my wife have no children and won't have any.  Our emissions stop with us.  So ill eat beef and drive a fast high performance car.  And then ill die and my footprint will cease forever.  Those of you who have children will at the very least extend your carbon footprint 60-100 years into the future, and if you had 3+ kids you've massively increased your overall carbon footprint and likely set it on a geometric increase.  Asking Individual organisms to deprive themselves for the good of other remote and unknown organisms is going to be a failure.  Someone will eventually have to do something to reduce the sheer volume of humanity and reduce its growth.  That or the earth will eventually do it itself.
You should do a video on why all of us should do everything in our power to stop the destruction on the Amazon Rainforest ^-^
That moment when you realize its all mostly marketing
5:33 the reason why i love this video
when you realize its the vegan teacher in disguise
It's because they are fed GM soya and other feed. So they fart more
A pig will die if you gave it soybeans from the field
I wish they'd stop comparing animals existing with carbon footprints...it's dishonest. If we didn't have cattle, we'd have millions of Buffalo and other grazers. In reality it's about the fuel we use to transport everything and pollution as well as deforestation that's our biggest threat
Soy Boy
Why the reupload?
Millions of years eating it...Can't be the worst
Stupid! It's like saying: If you spend $100 where $26 go for food and $74 for games, then please cut off some food because you are wasting your money.
Can you publish the dislike count?
it is fact that if you check the history of this planet you will find this is evolution , and i am  sick to death of tree hugging snowflakes trying to turn everyone into vegans
Humans aren't made to be vegan, and while I agree we need to eat less beef, and cut down beef production, it is just straight up not possible for everyone to go vegan no matter which way you swing it. We need smarter ways of producing food, and to make sure that everyone gets their fair share, which is actually the biggest issue here. Food is abundant, but people are still starving because of false scarcity, through capitalism, made specifically so that the rich can get even richer.   You're not showing the whole picture, you've taken the social aspect out entirely AND made it on all people, especially the vulnerable, to fix a problem a very small number are making. Do better
So, what do we have to do with animas?
Which problem affects the environment the most? Deforestation, carbon emissions, physical pollution, or chemical pollution?
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old" Excuse you, I would beg to differ!

This video is very important for indians! 🇮🇳
Dislike
I think you made a great video, telling the facts and in the end saying "you are free to do as you choose with this information."
Definitely no. We are natural born meat eater, we just changed out way of eating cuz of convenience.
This is very complicated. Because if people stopped then a lot of people would die of malnutrition because surprise surprise being a vegan takes careful planning to get the right nutrition. We are at a stage where meat is necessary but it’s killing us.
i aint not eating meat
What about seafood? I don't miss meat or chicken other than it's cheaper. The taste comes from the spices anyway unless you're some true BBQ meat enjoyer.
I’ve been pescatarian since June 1st and I live it!
I hope I'm not the only one who noticed the monkey in the intro sequence eating a whole cow.
You said Brasil, now you've unlocked the Fan BRase feat, prepare for portugese comments or english ones made by brazilians swarming your comment section. Great video anyways, amazon really need a governament that cares about the forest and the state.
There's also a seemingly large amount of talk about how preserving forests will be the main key to reducing CO2 and preventing more carbon emission. There is no acutaly change in the level of carbon emission until something is done with the deforested land, and contrary to popular belief, forests are horrible carbon sinks. The amount of detritus, decomposition, decay, and animal life CO2 emission offsets the carbon sink properties almost entirely. Notably, this is mitigated if we are talking about "new forest" as opposed to old forest. But for this to be a viable means of carbon capture, deforestation wouldn't be the answer. Clearing forests and replanting would be.
Didn't watch the video yet... but who the hell thinks that meat is bad? Like, being predators and consuming meat made us what we are today.
"You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information" Fix myself a hamburger I did.
Love the "besoydes" pun in there. Love these videos!!
6:26 How horribly ironic.
Not having dislikes means I can't tell how well received this video is. Which is a shame because it is a highly debated topic.
I mean I don't really like beef anyway.
"Cattle raised on a factory farm that never get to roam pastures" You guys are honestly dangerously misrepresenting the organization and structure of factory farms. There is literally no way to raise cattle without pastures. They're often raised on Cow/calf lots which are in fact pastures where the cattle roam for up to 2 years before being sent to a finishing lot, which is the "factory farm" of your derogation. They rarely spend less than 2 months there and are only kept longer if it is harder to get them fat enough for eating. If cattle weren't allowed to roam pasture, they would never build up the muscle that composes the meat source. PLEASE do your research and stop denigrating factory farms based off of malinformed and subpar knowledge about the industry. You are ACTIVELY misinforming people.
Why the fuck is the thumbnail like that XD
Actually one of the few atleast it seems, unbiased videos. Ther are two things you have missed however, the fact that the grassland cattle feed on is a carbon sink itself, also regarding feeding grains such as soy, wheat etc are mostly not fit for human consumption, in other words, cattle are fed the waste products from human grain production. Something like 30% of soy is digestible by humans, rest is waste which we cannot do anything with. Also things like distilled grain, its a byproduct of alcohol production, once again, its not fit for human consumption but cattle love it.
Can you wonderfull people mby make a video about geothermal energie?💪
What an amazingly in-depth video! Thank you so much for really showing all the good and the bad things about emissions caused by food. I feel like everybody should see this.
Why would you prefer eating roting corpses to plants?
FOR ME meat is the only way to go ! I am allergic to all dairy , most fruit and veggies, EVEN THE ONES I LOVE !
i like the vegans who did this video and not the other kind that just spend their day telling everybody how special they are and how everybody else suck ass.
Sadge
Watched the video for you lazy people: Meat bad, Agriculture pointless, Dairy pointless and bad, Eat vegetables / lab grown meats.
TLDW: We killed 70 billion lives a yeat that we dont need to, it's worst than slavery
Thanks for your videos
I think that the most effective campaign for reducing the world’s dietary carbon footprint would be to encourage people to give up beef (and lamb). In my experience, most people aren’t willing to give up all meat to go completely vegetarian (let alone vegan), but would be open to sacrificing beef alone. Giving up pork as well would be great, but at least according to this video it’s not much worse than chicken. You may make a moral argument that factory farmed chickens suffer even more than cows and are therefore not a good enough substitute, but these arguments are entirely subjective, and frankly I think the overall health of our planet out-ways this suffering.
"Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no."
veganism is the future, we are still in ape stage
I'm not eating bugs
People are harmful to our planet. It is proposed to get rid of them (the problem may disappear)
And there's the water footprint too 🙂😩
thx <3
Meat is delicious though
Very soon we will likely have cheap vat grown meat so I'm not going to go to the effort of giving up meat when I'll be able to just substitute it soon anyways. There are plenty of other problems to tackle in the world and my life.
Interesting
I'm a little surprised you didn't even mention the food pyramid-- no, not That One, I mean the way that each level of a food chain, when eaten, has 10% of the calories per energy used to grow the animal than the level below it. I don't remember if it's actually 10% exactly, but it's definitely in the "orders of magnitude" range. so beef is definitely bad, but tuna as an apex predator is probably one of the very worst animals we could choose. (this said from someone who loves canned tuna lol.)
I need meat
Okay so I have a question. So I've read and seen videos of beef beening grown in a lab. Would this be better for the environment or have little to no impact compared to current being f production?
Or we could just grow our meat in labs, then everyone is happy!
Mmmm I love animal flesh mmm
Thank you for the video.  I wish that you would have spoken about lab-grown meat, its current state, and its future.  But I see that it'd have made the video very long.  In another video maybe?
Dropping cow meat is ez pez but I'm not about to go vegan.
Waiting for the reaction videos trying to refute everything about this one.
If only the world was run from Kurzgesagt
As a YouTuber, I say "Your video is awesome". Many Youtubers, including myself, work hard to create videos despite the lack of income and views. ❤️
My suggestion is that we should cut back on beef, and hunt more.  Wild game is really good and you are helping their populations by hunting.
That “meethain” hit me so hard. I thought it was “METH-ain”
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive”  Everyone who loves food: “I felt that”
thats fucked up man
solution: just shoot the excess people consuming too much food and making for a too high of a demand. actually shooting them is an environmental disaster, let's feed them to the animals
I've yet to see any evidence that climate change is ever going to happen again. It's all fear mongering.
In short : yes
Video shows the statistic of the entire process of food production when talking about meat, whose total pollution is less than 8% of the total emissions, adds Forest clearing as an inherent consequence of meat production (instead of it being bad land management and doesn't consider that forest clearing with fire happens both in Sout America and africa for crop production too.  Is the excess of meat consumption bad? Yes Should people reduce the amount of meat they eat? probably  Will stopping the production of food do anything about climate change? Absolutely not, especially when more than half of the pollution is caused by industrial processes and electricity production
who came up with this carbon budget bs?
tarumlüg  Programmierer der mASTER  K.  I.                                       !
tbh no one's making me vegan. ever.
Everyone is arguing I'm just gonna link the STONKS meme at 8:13
Ok, prove me wrong but the visualisation with how much of crops do cows eat is very missleading. Because the lion part of it are inedible parts of crops which are the biggest part of many types of crops.
Narrator:  what you do with this information is your choice.  Me:  my choice is to change nothing.  I never buy meat, and the only meat I consume is wild game.
Poultry counts as eggs?
i did not understand anything, i got bombarded instead
Point 3 I like how you included the fact that non-arable land is used by cows to convert inedible grass into edible beef...  However, the point about cereals and food crops going towards feed for cows was disingenuous - cows are not eating the 'human edible' parts of the plants (such as the wheat ear); rather they are consuming the in-edible parts (such as straw and husks) that humans wouldn't be able to eat regardless.  Has anyone who did the research for these figures ever worked in the dairy or meat industry?
I prefer pork and chicken to beef anyways. c.c  But I do love milk. <shrugs>
what about the impacts of cultured meat which is cells grown in labs into meat
Food is a necessity Communists: Uhhh, no it isn't?
meat entails the  killing of animals. Please don't eat animals
I would like to know where fish lies in terms of emissions compared to calories per kilogram
I think in the future “normal meat” will become a luxury and lab grown or plant based meat will be used as a cheap alternative (in fast food restaurants for example.)
Cattle are vegetarian so we don’t have to be. Thank you cattle, eat beef
Redemption, Kurtzgesagt! Thank you✌️❤️🌱
Arabi ccc
Could you make a video on lab grown meat?
Did this omit the carbon cost of the last mile transport from the ports to the markets for the avocados?
Where does meat from hunting fit into this picture? Is the problem eating meat? or is it agriculture? There is certainly access and sustainability issues that prevent hunting being a replacement for farming, but I've never seen an analysis that addresses the difference between eating farm raised meat vs hunted meat.
0:52 - 1. The role of our diet 3:45 - 2. Local food 7:14 - 3. Don't cows mainly use land that we can't use for agriculture or other things?  6:25 -  the more animals suffer, they better they are for climate change
hmmmm interesting you made me hungery tho now where is my hunting rifle at
WAIT, THERE'S MORE!  1. When you calculate recovered land from giving up meat or going full vegan, you are not considering that people don't just stop eating those foods, they need to REPLACE the nutrients they used to get from it with something else. How much land is needed to produce the crops that will be replacing the meat that isn't produced? Since these vegetables are not as efficiently digested (we're not ruminants), humans need more too (edit: supplements and vitamins go here too).  2. Several people are having success recovering barren land via grazing rotation. No heavy smog-emitting machinery, just heavy animals who produce fertilizer as a byproduct, animals who do not turn into forever-junk when their time is up like a tractor (we already have uses for every last hair). This looks to be as important as crop rotation, but is not widespread yet.
This is why my family switched from ground beef to ground turkey, hard to completely cut out meat but we can all make changes
where is fish on that scale? how much does that contribute?
🌝🌚
Summary: Yes
Lab-grown meat
All socialist lies. There’s proof we’re heading for another ice age.
could you chemically alter the methane emissions? Just a question.
Y’all better make an “it’s complicated” shirt or I’m unsubscribing
Oh boy, the original meat video must have received a huge backlash to be followed by this
I refuse to stop eating meat to "Like, save the environment, man" in a world where billionaires are blasting into space for jollies.
You already made this point. Twice.
OMG! I'm very wonder why people see the climate problem the wrong way and try to fix it the wrong way too.  The problem is population Dude! not food. Human eats meat for thousands of years but never be a problem until last 100 years that human population increased 5 time from before. UN Population Division estimated that the world population will reach peak in 2100 with 10.9 billion.  Imagine the world with 10.9 billions! even everyone is vegan, the climate problem will still get worse. "A vegan diet would free up around 3 billion hectares of land" ? yeah yeah! Capitalist (the landlord) be like "Oh everyone is vegan now, so we should give our land to grow forests" You think that would happen? so innocent. Please focus the one true problem (POPULATION!) and fix it the right way (POPILATION CONTROL!).  Disclaimer: I agree that we should eat less meat. Not to free up land but to prevent invading more forest. The land will be automatically free if world population decrease. not only land for food corps. but the land for living, transporting, infrastructures and other will be free too.
And that's why, I only eat humans.
eating is a chore and shitting is the worst
In other words, 80% of us should die for climate change but we don't like it and just talking a way a round it.
Great content! It would be interesting to have a similar video about food from the ocean with algae, fish and mussels and their ecological impact.  Thanks for all the awesome videos!
Your explanation of the transport of food via oceanic shipping misses the complete supply chain. The complete supply chain must include the transportation to local shops, within the destination countries. That increases the emissions by combining both shipping methods, ships to transport the food across the ocean and trucks to deliver the food to local destinations. Thus, buying locally in fact has less carbon impact than having food shipped from other countries.
A wonderful way of summarizing and sharing current research on this complex topic! Thank you!
Reality is....i like meat...
Climate change is such a messy topic, and it's not because of a few deniers, it's because things like nuclear energy get shunned and wind power get promoted - both are bad ideas, but considered the "smart and civilized" person's opinions.
I actually hate this in so many ways
You forget to talk about regenerative grazing. It can't reverse climate change, but it has other environnemental uses.
Can you make a video about how the other 74% of CO2 global emissions could be lowered by adopting nuclear and renewables, as well as by making the production of non-food production goods greener?
Animals are not food.
Am I getting punked? "ME-thane" "ContRAHversy". Great analysis, though, love the fair, not sensational review of the facts.
Hello I banned without your fan. I was banned from Uzbekistan 👍👍👍👍
BOLSONARO, the climate enemy of Brazil and the genocide who are destroying Amazon nowadays just to keep his dirty hands in the Brazilian politics, must PAY for that!
So, the answer is "yes meat is bad", right? To oversimplify things really.
"Methane has already caused 23%-40% of human caused warming so far" If North America has a similar number of cattle now as there were bison two centuries ago, going back millennia, how is their methane caused by humans?  It seems one is just replacing another.
It's very disappointing to see misleading graphs in a video about a very heated topic. This is the last channel I would expect to share misleading information
Carbon budget?!?
Good video. But I would like see a video on what the negative impact on the environment would have if most people didn’t eat meat.
I love this channel but it’s becoming increasingly hard for them to avoid the topic of capitalism’s role in climate change. There are moneyed interests invested in having things not change and, in fact, accelerating us towards doom. Until this obvious issue is dealt with as a society, we won’t escape climate apocalypse
Just eat less meat mixed with fresh veggies, less steaks more fajitas and soup.
it pisses me off how you talk about "how much crops are used to feed animals" but yet don't talk about the rule of 10%. WHY no one does that?  anyway, if you're reading this let me explain that rule. basically an ecosystem is seen as "storage" of "biomass" (in other words, different kind of foods for different kind of steps in the food chain) for example, growing 1kg of grass or for example potatoes or carrots doesnt' take much else than just a heck ton of carbon, a bunch of water, free sun light and a spoonful of mixed minerals (talking about a life in an equilibrated ecosistem that doesn't require fertilizers) but for example, to grow one kilo of hervivore meat (such as the cows) you need to feed them 10 kgs of plant matter and if we want to feed a human exclusibly on meat so he/she can grow and live his life... well, 1 kg of human meat would require10 kg of animal meat which in return is 100kg of plant matter...   and the same goes for fish, a white tuna feeds on other fish and moluscs, it's carnivore and can reach weights  of 200kg, 200kg of carnivorous fish require 2 TONS of other fish, which in return is 20 TONS of placton/algae. 20 tons of algae will only produce 20 kgs of human meat, if you go to the carnivore route, however the hervivore route only takes 200kg of algae/plancton (if we could feed on it without risking our health lol). i know it may sound a bit morbid but well, just think about a kid growing.   you get the idea... that's basically the only reason we need so sooo much crops and most importantly crop space to feed the animals,.
It really depends on how it is raised. Factory farming is bad! Free range grass feed is OK for you. Permaculture animals is actually sequestering carbon along with being ok for you.  It all depends on were the meat comes from.
Watching this while I eating beef... Awkward.
Short answer: No it isn't, it's very good!
Who else eating meat while watching this?
Meat is the only type of food that noone has ever had an allergy to. The only non-alergen. O ppl out of billions are allergic to meat. This means something - this means meat should be the basis of human nutrition - the bottom of the food pyramid on which we build other layers that can vary for different people with different metabolisms and different food preferences.
Wait I don't understand. You say that local meat is more co2 emitting than global avocado because a truck has to drive the meat to the store, and thats less efficient than an international container ship. But last time I checked, my local grocery store doesn't have an industrial shipping port, so a car still needs to drive it to the store, just like my kg of beef. I get that the beef has more co2 in production before getting on the truck, but the phrasing of that segment is misleading
Everyone who loves eating meat are the 9 times out of 10 the most hypocrites alive, not hating but it's what it is. Most love dogs, and cats but still eat meat. Most pretend loving animals but eat them like parasites. Plants are alive too but at least I don't treat a specific plant in a specific way. The body can digest plants way more efficiently. There's more to plants though..
"Science can give us the answer." Science: It's complicated.
You've already covered this topic multiple times, lazy day at Kurzgesagt?
There's something I think is an important factor in this discussion: I, and many others I know, would be quite happy to go meatless if a couple conditions were met: if the meat-substitutes available to me were equal to meat in taste/texture and were the same or a lower price? I'd happily quit buying meat and instead buy meat-like-substances. Price is a powerful incentive, if you can offer really tasty plant-based meat substitutes for a way lower price than the real deal, people will make the choice on their own. . The important factors on a replacement are user experience (needs to be so good an imitation that a casual enjoyer can't tell the difference), and price (needs to be substantially cheaper than meat to compete strongly).
What entity is responsible for calculating our climate budget? Lollll
Great video, but missing several topics in the bigger picture. What about natural vs synthetic fertilizer and our diminishing topsoil? What about consuming animal organs, which are the most nutrient dense foods? What about animal byproducts, like lubricants, oils, gelatin, etc? How do we replace these elements with plants and somehow still preserve the planet?
If they ban meat i'll just go over to eating my fellow humans tbh..     😈
9:30 that was very deceptive
Animal suffering is more important to me than climate change. I really should be vegan, but I'm not moral enough.
В последние выпуски вы долбанулись на выбросах CO2
I'd love to see how lab-made meat compares to regular meat and plant products in terms of emissions
yes
Saying methane is issue is not correct methane since as was mentioned it decomposes in atmosphere and it reach equilibrium decades ago. Methane that replaces what decomposes does not worsen climate change. Not in a way that it is portrayed only thing that methane adds is co2 that is created from methane decomposition. And also what is feed to livestock is often parts of crops that humans can not digest and otherwise would be just composted or burned releasing in the end same amount of co2, but without food that as edible byproduct. Than there is also leftover food that is also fed to livestock that would otherwise be composted or incinerated that is also recycled via livestock.
sorry mate, meat taste good.
this ignors that all that crop prasentage is the parts we dont eat. we cull the soy plant but only eat the beens, the stalks and leaves we dont eat go to animal feed. including things like nut shells, peals and skins, roots and cobs n cores. plus theres a higher prasentage of lose and waist of plant crops than of meat and dairy. so all this deforestation is fow crops we only use a small amount of. plus we have killed off so many animles im pretty shor things level out considering 10s of 1000s of buffalo, rhinos, elephants, dear ect we eliminated. cows r not a mager alteration to emotions
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive”   Everyone who loves food: “I felt that”
The Movie Gamechanger for example lied about meat so hard. And the dumb ppl still believed in it
If there were a plant based food with as much protein as beef, I'd go vegan immediately, but I'm not willing to give up high protein meals
the calculation with the exhaust gases that cows produce when burping and farting is bullshit because what the cow produces is also stored again in the plants for the cow's food so this value remains constant and does not increase
"...If the world is meant to end, so be it. Let it end and be reborn."   -Arngeir the Greybeard
Resume: Is meat really that bad? Yes.
man am i glad im vegetarian
So in short we're screwed either way 🤔 oh well🤷  🍆🍑 anyone?😆😅😪
Not sure how right it is to say growing plants is objectively better with all the pesticides, herbicides and fertilizer that are needed to grow this food.
'Beef Stonks' LOL
I can see lowering down beef consumption, but getting rid of meat all together is never going to happen. People will eat meat at least several times a week and that is never going to change ever.
Great video, anyways, I’m about to go grill some burgers.
maybe this sounds egocentric but was this video inspired by my tweet? I remember @ing you guys on twitter with a video about meat not long ago. If not what a crazy coincidence
this channel is so fuckin bias
I would love to see a magnet or pin of the Fart-o-meter..
Есть животных не гуманно, когда вам доступны фрукты и овощи с любого уголка планеты в одном магазине в любое время года
Ok but what about lab grown? It was mentioned but not extrapolated on.
i can’t helping thinking that future humans will judge us harshly for being unable to do the simplest of individual actions that could help keep the planet in a lovable state, like not eating beef 🤷‍♂️
Meow
Fasinating. Now back to my steak
But meat taste good. Seriously I doubt i can change my diet that much specially since I know most of us wouldn't, my dad keeps being told he needs to cut back for his own health and he won't.
well I hope more people will go vegan now, this is just the best way to reduce our footprint  and for the animals to stop being exploited by humans  Plus, it is so much easier nowadays to change our habits or to eat plant-based alternatives !
All your previous videos on meat and meat eating were surreally incorrect on a factual level. I found it made me unable to trust this channel. This video is a great step in the right direction. It is a shame you can’t just say what the data in your video showed… eating plants is better for environment and ethics.
I watched this trying to figure out if I should be vegan but I’m just confused…
I am able to go vegetarian... but get rid of cheese, milk and mayonnaise would sincerely be to much not only for me but for the majority of people. Imagine poor France loosing all their traditional Cheese... it would be a catastrophe
This is just all the bull that so called experts say. Its not better to cut out meat.  All this crap is a broken record. Even if it were true (probably not) I would still eat meat. In fact i mainly eat meat because a lot of veg is high in carbs and make you fat. Also, i have hated every vegetarian/ vegen dish i have ever tried. It is disgusting. And Id starve with my allergy/ intolerance to many plants.
You didn’t talk about pescatarian diets
.
yem vegetarian :D
Could you discuss the potentials of the James Webb Telescope and more about how it works since it launches (Hopefully) at the end of this month?
But wouldn’t freeing the land not used for more trees and grasslands increase the oxygen in the atmosphere and lead to larger insect growth since their size is tied to the oxygen content? I’m sure people don’t want another Carboniferous period of giant insects again in the modern day.
There is one other factor that was not taken into account in this video. Our population (approaching 8 billion) is making it ever increasingly difficult to produce enough food to sustain it. We will likely need to continue raising animals to help feed the World's population. However, there are ways to go about this more efficiently and additionally, 1st world populations should really focus on consuming less calories in their diets. It may be that a smaller meat component to diets will be the proper way to go along with careful focus of using marginal lands to raise smaller herds of animals. Before anyone chirps in and says that we should thin the human population out, please tell me, who gets to decide who lives or dies and just how do you think you would be able to contain the "culling" to a specific portion of the population without causing massive social unrest and perhaps even more death and destruction? No, we have nearly 8 billion people on this planet and we have to learn how to help ALL of them.
Finally a big channel putting WhatIveLearned in place (+ from a neutral pov, Cheers.)
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old" Not with that attitude lol
I have the best argument for consuming meat of all:  My acenstors didn't develop the bow and arrow to hunt cabbage.
AA@AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaa
ANIMALS CAN DIE BUT OUR HOMIES THE PLANTS NO!
Use me as a DISLIKE BUTTON.  (I dont hate meat, i just hate that they took the Dislike Views away..)
Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell: “Food is arguably the best thing about being alive” me: yes so true
If we become vegans we will end with our defenses against zombies
not a single word about the nutritional issues... nobody questioned that meat isn't good for co2. the argument is that yo can't live "healthy" without any meat.
Well shit. Maybe I should of doubled down on staying vegan. Lol, I lasted 1 month.
There is only one thing to do! Lets switch to a BUG diet! Plenty of proteins, and 0 CO2 emissions!
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive” "No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times per day and never gets old" hmmmmmmm s e g g z ?
Great video. Wonder if it will help turn a few people towards the tofu. :)
One aspect that I wish was explored in the video is the land needed to switch to entirely plant based meals. The ammount of land needed to feed a person per years is less than a cow, I'm sure, but one thing I've heard floating around is that in terms of expantive farming, cutting out meat would cause *more* land to be overtaken by farms to feed that gap in nutrition.
Damn that's crazy. *prepares steak*
I was always little bit suspicious about the fact, that humans at some point decided to eat animals, which they were not able to catch, kill and eat without additional tools.
No it's not y'all need to chill
Mike the Vegan will definitely have something to say about this! 😜😝😂
The problem is that the conclusion in this topic is that killing people ends up being the best option for the environment.
I like this video and support sharing more evidence on this but but something weird just I just tried to upload a comment  on lose of the dislike button, about how any reaction : share or watching the full vid of something you object to  is taken as engagm3nt by the big Y T Alg. And that the Alg. Is becoming more like the F B Alg. That rewards divisive content. When I tried to post the comment a box came up saying " the resource has been 3xhausted cannot post" when I tried to screen shot it that box was greyed out and could not be read. ????????? Then I lost the comment without deleting so rewrote this and the same thing happened. Screenshot ring it the Y T grey error code box came out blank The resource has been exhausted. Check quota. Then the comment disappeared  without me cancelling it. It happened again on this one, will try to copy save the comment
You should consider that crop fed cows eat the stem which is not human edible not the seeds
I can answer this! The forbidden fruit was eating meat. I’m no vegetarian. But, our animals use to poop our seeds out with all the nutrients needed to grow them! A perfect cycle. Lazy people and greed destroyed this process
Answer: Yes it is.
6:29 thankyou for showing this. Animated or not, mass torture always looks ugly and that's why it's important that people see it anyway. A wise person once said _"If a slaughterhouse had glass walls, the world would stop eating meat immediately"_
Feed the man Meat.
Just got to wait for the lab grown beef becoming cheap to make
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times everyday, and never gets old."  They tried _real_ hard to dodge the one other bodily pleasure that can contest that statement
Im surprised you didnt include the water cost. Like how much water is needed to create 1kg of meat or its calorie equivalent vs plants and which plants and animals consume the most water.  You even included an example of Avocados grown in South America being more efficient than locally sourced meat. but Avocados requite a lot of water (probably still less than the equivalent for meat when you include their feed) but would be interesting to see its true cost
How to pronounce kurzgasagt ? 😅
Sounds like you have been taking bribes from the meat industry AGAIN.
Technically the most environmentally friendly beef is a veggie pattie
Eating meat is messing up the planet a bit... *takes bite from big mac*
Incredible video!!!!
200 million animals die everyday
These days what with the technology and innovation used on making veggie burgers and such I have to say I probably wouldn’t mind being a vegetarian if it still meant impossible burgers and such. But the reality that is often overlooked isn’t just moral or ethical, it is economical. People simply cannot financially afford some of the food choices offered to them. Look no further than a college student trying to pay loans and surviving off of shitty ramen. Do you honestly believe they’d be offended by a salad at the same price? No. The problem is that actually purchasing such things are often prohibitively expensive when compared to other food options.  Food isn’t even universally a human right. People don’t have a right to eat, much less to eat healthy or eat ethically.
Meat is non-negotiable. If the whole population stopped eating meat, disease rates would explode. A vegan diet is simply not nutritious enough to support proper health. We should aim to cut back carbon emission elsewhere first.
I choose the beef
Thanks Thanks Thanks
And that's only considering climate change. There's also the simple fact that it's unethical to create innocent sentient beings just to make them suffer when we don't need to.
Become vegetarian become human
I like the summary at the end---reusing images you've already shown is helpful in bringing back memories and making sure we memorize the information well.
Mass meat production for billions of people isn’t good for the planet or the animals. Fact. Stop.
Thank you for this video
I will not eat bugs
I have to dislike all videos now that youtube doesn't let you see the dislikes. But I did actually like this! Thanks!
Amazing video! The vast majority of vegans used to say the same things: "I couldn't live without eating animals", "vegans are annoying and preachy", "thank you vegans for leaving more meat for me", "I have my right to eat meat', etc, etc...
I am really saddened to see that nobody seems to be shocked (and truly realize) that we could gain natural areas the size of South America, if we were to stop eating beef. We would stop global warming AND have a lot more beauty in our surroundings.. The biggest problems of our generation would dissappear. I am never eating beef again.
No it's not. Toxic vegans are.
So the CO2 and the water is not being used by the grass cows eat...right.
This is tough to hear but important, will try and eat more vegan!
Do a video about "What If the Böötes void turned into a Black hole".
But what is the animal was a emo
"DaMn vEgAnS aNd ThEy'Re AgEnDa oF tEllInG ThE tRuTh AnD MaKiNg Me UnCoMfOrTaBlE"
We should just stop eating.
Yo  Kurzgesagt, how far are we from making laboratory made meat a realistic alternative for the current situation and would such production be carbon neutral?
Koreans are very fond of meat...It's rare to meet a vegetarian in South Korea!!!
Vegan patties really have improved. If people invested into this by supporting plant-based products, it would improve even more.
What about fish? People can still eat fish right? I mean there maybe a small carbon foot print from transport from fisheries to meat markets but fish dont need land.
9:33 why compare the next 100 years to an annual one? the co2 could be far surpassed in a couple decades
So… Would a population decrease help? Or is it simply our fault by overproducing food that goes to waste?
This video has gone trend!!  Trending on 6
3d printing meat
Dear Kurzgesagt,  Great video and well researched!  I would like to add a little info on the beef that may be interesting.  In Denmark there's a concept where environmental organisations or individual enclaves buy some cows to keep down the grass on natural land with low nutrients.  The good thing here is that the cows serve the purpose of keeping these areas with a high biological diversity. It is a tad along the same idea as "rewilding" although in case, the animals gets slaughtered by the end of the season.  For sure the carbon footprint here is also high, but the cows serve a vital function for the bogs and meadows.  In many cases these animals does not receive addional feed. They usually thus produce less meat at the end.   I'm not arguing whether to eat or not,  but I thought it was a curious detail.
I understand that  meat generates immense co² but I have to eat it as culture and religion I can't do that?
This a great video, but i feel like it glossed over the various commercial applications of animal byproducts that plants just don't offer. Things like leather, wool, animal fats, how animal waste is refined into fertilizer and so forth.
When the question of whether we should give up animal husbandry for the sake of the planet or not, we need to ask ourselves two simple questions. 1. Is it possible to make tasty pancakes using milk other than cow's milk? 2. Is it possible to make Ruthenian dumplings without using cottage cheese? As long as the answers to these questions are "no", the earth can fuck itself.
How does driving a truck across town produce TWENTY KG of co2??? Even if 100% of fuel was converted into co2, thats still more mass than fuel used, and is impossible.
In NZ dairy cows take all the fertile flat lands near rivers. We call them "dairy flats" they go onto hill country, or partial "barn raised " feed pads in winter more and more now. So they are using huge amounts of arable land in NZ and also fertilizing so heavily that we have fertilisers that have leached into the rivers that water our major cities especially Auckland. That nitrate level will rise for decades even though farmers riparian plant and reduce their nitrate use now because it is coming from old nitrate reaching the aquafer.   By contrast beef cattle are on the hills, although that land could also do other things but less intensively.
One important part you didn't mention: altering your diet doesn't change how much meat gets produced unless you also change several millions of other diets, which reasonably is very hard to do. But it's also reasonable why you might not have mentioned it, since what little impact this video makes would become zero if you mentioned it.
Sorry not going vegan
Climate change is natural. The sun controls our climate
If meat eaters had a conscience they'd be very upset right now.
Interesting how we say food is the problem. Aren't too many people the problem? It would seem to me if people were to have fewer children, we could all eat whatever we wanted. If a couple has only one child, they effectively reduce the world's population by one. Having no children reduces it by two. Having two children maintains the population. Having three, and the population grows by one. It used to be we worried about having enough food for the growing population, but now it would seem due to the amount we need, our food may kill us. The ideal scenario is that we anticipate our environmental problems instead of reacting to them. A simple change in the amount of children we each have would gradually return this planet to homeostasis. That should be obvious to everyone.
Bound to veganism from birth
" Well, it's complicated "  You guys need to make a t-shirt or something with that catchphrase
I got a calendar for work! I’ve already put it up just waiting for the new year!
I am sure most of the people are watching this video while eating!!! 😄😄😄
Kurzgesagt: Do with that information what you will.  Me: Builds violent mob farms in Minecraft to harvest resources in a more environmentally friendly way. Peace, love, and plants!
Kids, to safe the world, don't spend energie on things like walking.
Another important thing is that the animal caused emissions circulate back into plants they eat, while stuff like burning fossil fuels gets the carbon from underground aboveground where it stays
This kinda devolved from "is meat bad?" to "is beef bad?". A shame because beef being a problem was already common knowledge, yet other sources of meat are much less touched upon. Also, pick a side: is it "we need to fix climate yesterday" or "we can wait 100 years to have grass suck up some CO2"?
can you make a video about Chernobyl?
Where is the Mars infection video?
No
Watched this while eating a 🥩.
After watching this video, I am encouraged to consume more meat.
This is what I needed to finally make the decision to go vegan. Thanks.
Maritime transport "insanely efficient" ? we may not have seen the same numbers, I saw many number pointing out its actually the reverse, mostly because of other gases like sulfurs and nitric, not necessarily impacting directly the rising of temperatures, but very pollutant anyway...
Very nice video
please do a video on fishing !
If everybody with a garden just kept some chickens, people would trow away less food cause the chickens eat it and people will buy less eggs from the supermarket. We have chickens of our own.  Only downside is that you need to end them and clean them yourselve. People would be more grateful of their food if they fully knew how it is made.   Didnt make me vegan but it made me appreciate my chicken wing much more!!
BIG LIKE!
You're either vegan or an animal abuser with your wallet. Make the change. ❤️
9:45 Chef: So how'd you like for your meal? Me: *A Cell*
I wanna see more memes in cute Kurzgesagt animation style.
GO VEGAN
The question I would like to know the answer and wich is extremly delicate because conficated by highly emotional and morally driven ideologues (whose mantra is killing animals is bad no matter what, and whose ecological argument are just a convenient way to make everyone swallow their faith), is why some people seems to fare very well while others are sick and strongly anemic all the time under the same vegan diet.
I'm honestly very skeptical about the "farting cows" part. In pre-colonial times, North America was inhabited by some 30-60mil wild bisons, which were pretty much cows. Today the population of domestic cows in the US is around 93mil. So if the fart rate of a bison is approximately the same as that of a domestic cow, we will get x2 rate of cow farts on average comparing 1500s to 2000s, which doesn't feel that significant. Imo deforestation plays much bigger role here, but before blaming Brazil we shouldn't forget that modern Europe was basically a huge forest just about 1000 years ago
Great to hear this, especially after the channel “What I’ve Learned” made a video on why demonizing the meat industry is a bad idea
No
Hi! Does someone know what the comparison would be if you were to have a vegetarian diet instead of vegan? I understand that there will be still problems with milk and eggs but I'm just wondering how it compares to the other two diets they named in the video.
"Well, it's complicated". No it isn't, eating meat should be avoided
What about cultured meat?
Producers of this video don't eat. Do they drink petrol then?
Meat production also breeds new pathogens which directly affect humanity, not to mention the health effects of eating meat and the amount of pesticides/antibiotics that go into agriculture/meat farming which also affect our bodies
Love the music
Fantastic to include the correlation between animal welfare and emissions. I've met way to many people, who believe they're helping the climate by exclusively eating expensive, organically farmed meat.
When you start 3D printing beef with raw resources *environmentalist*
Well, hope the extreme right wing brazilians dont hear about this video... They will soon dislinking it, flooding and arguing with science...
"Beef Stonks" lol
What is a the point of living if we are eleven billions with extremly miserable life standards being forced on everyone (but not a tiny minority of rich as usual, lets be real) in order for the whole human population to be sustainable...
if the world went vegan id shoot myself
I cut live without meat
The amount of megafauna and other animals that used to exist worldwide thousands of years ago makes me doubt cows make any abnormal difference in methane and co2 levels. It's just easier to quantify because cows and their products are documented out of necessity.
1 thing i dont understand is why we dont switch land farms to vertical farms. we would be able to save so much land and move animals to the free land and re-grow areas that were deforested
How about the fact that it’s not normal to monocrop mass lands. I might kill an elk and have meat for a year while you plow fields destroying entire ecosystems all the soil cultures and vermin living amongst the vegetation for your plate of salad or tofu
This is a very good video personally my plan for the very near future is to have my own chickens, and i'd hunt other animals myself in that way i'd have way less of an environmental impact but since you need a license for that shit i'd just stick to catching fish (i know you need a license for this too in some places)  but yeah, chicken and fish is the only thing i'd eat from meat and even this not on a daily basis
Bruh I ate like 100 kgs of beef thorughout my 22 years on earth, we don't really eat beef in Hungary for example because it's simply not cheap enough. If they would fine bad farms and make beef almost impossible to buy, lower CO2 is going out.
What about insect protein and a possible bug meat diet?
What is burger the worst foods ever? 😭😢😿
This video is gold. Thank you.  9:05
personal responsibility with environmentalism is definitely something everyone should take seriously. however, it would have been beneficial if you included some information about how corporations are the largest contributor to CO2 emissions.  we cannot ignore their contributions. they actively put this burden on us and redirect the fault to us, when we should be focusing on them. why should we suffer and sacrifice what little we have, when they're swimming in gold and not doing anything to help us?
All these meat videos that Kurzgesagt made has always been favored towards veganism. The previous videos made no mention of how cows occupy mostly grasslands, but now conveniently mentions it when other creators have brought up this argument. I can't help but be skeptic since everyone can just bring up research and statistics to prove a point without even trying to disprove it
Sacrificing not having kids>>> To save whats left of this rock we live on !
I would continue eating meat
I want a powerful rich vegan blonde blue eyed European daddy to punish my Brazilian ass for cutting down the Amazon 😫
9:30 Why do you compare data over a 100 year range next to data over a 1 year range? You're framing the narrative with your graph that way.
Every meat lover after watching this video will pretend they never saw this and continue eating meat while complaining about global warming and how government doesn't do anything.
what about the part where they feed inedible parts of the crops to the cows?
I’ve cut my meat consumption by 95%. Beef and pork by 100%. Zero regrets. You can do this. Start small.
2:41  humans: emit 0 carbon :D               your talking about food D:
Hold on. Food is a bodily pleasure , celebration, comfort etc etc. And it hits a special nerve when we're told to not eat meat?  I literally did not know people look at food this way.  I had only considered it as a necessity. It makes absolutely no difference to me whether I eat meat or not because it's all the same plain shite. Is this a universal sentiment?
3:32 AMONG SO FUNNY XDDD
So the avocadoes just stay at the docs and dont come in stores to the shelves in trucks etc? Also do we not burn down farmland to grow crops?
basically replace beef with chicken
If we moved on to non meat stuff we would die, run out of space
I would still rather die than give up meat.
I'd be interested to see the footprint of a vegan diet that includes the supplements most vegans use.  Comparing that with a diet of vegan + 1 chicken breast a day (arguably the best thing for you, personally).
Short answer: "NO." Long answer: "Yes, it's bad for my wallet,the damn thing is getting too expensive. I hate you inflation."
i recommend you guys watch the video from (what ive larned today) about that. kurzgasagt is obviasly biased towards 1 side on that one.
Just eat pork instead lol, it's far more tasty anyways
Please makw the next video about space
“What, afraid you might like it.” -Incogmeato  “No, afraid I might get Cancer.” -Landon
I will eat a cow!
Just don't eat beef.
It's important to note that hunter gatherers were more hunter than gatherer. Our small gut and large brain compared to, say, a gorilla (who eat very fibrous plants) show us that humans have evolved to eat meat. We haven't however evolved to have so many people on the planet at one time, all of which need meat. It's very easy to support a population of a few hundred thousand than a few billion., so we are now running into a problem that there are so many animals being reared for meat that it is causing huge climate damage from grazing, and global warming from methane production. This wouldn't have been a problem thousands of years ago
I heard that that the wheat part we give to animals are inedible for us. I was waiting for you to mention that and show us what you guys found about that but sadly it isn't in the video. Is it a solid argument? Does it change a lot?
Question- Aren't cows and other livestock carbon neutral?  My initial answer to this question is YES. From my understanding, livestock cant produce more carbon then they consume. This is more or less supported by every conservation law in physics and engineering [conservation of mass and energy, ect]. If a material balance was done on the process, the carbon released must be equal to the carbon consumed. In fact, more carbon is consumed then released due to accumulation of carbon inside living organisms ( AKA they grow and sustain themselves). When this process becomes carbon positive is when we consider human interactions. This begs the question, Why is the consumption of meat and other natural resources the focuses of climate change when their inefficiencies are entirely contributed to the inefficiencies of Human society. I feel like saying "Cow farts are a big contributor to climate change" is missing the point. Cows themselves cant be more than carbon natural and only when human interaction is consider does it change to carbon positive. Kind of feels like this argument is focusing on the symptom rather then the Cause. That being the introduction of more carbon into the atmosphere that was not apart of the carbon cycle.  This is something I have been contemplating for some time and this video gives me the perfect opportunity to ask. I feel that looking at climate change through this lens helps separate the bullshit from the actual solutions. If I'm misunderstanding anything or missing any key information please let me know and Thanks for another great video that resulted in me questioning my thoughts and assumptions.
Oh a lot of food is a problem the solution reduce the thing that needs all this food *cough cough* human population* cough*
Without dislikes this is unwatchable.

Eat more rabbits! Rabbits can eat plant matter that is undigestible to humans, are ready for slaughter in 8 weeks, and rabbit meat ahs more protein than beef! Pound for pound, rabbit meat likely has the lowest environmental impact of any meat.
Well...a minister in Spain suggested eating less meat because it is better for our health and for the environment an several people from the opposition parties started posting fotos eating meat and talking about how "communism wants to control what we eat"...pitty how dumb some people are.
Basically, stop eating like pigs.
There is a comparison that I feel is a little deceptive at 9:30 800 billion over 100 years vs 1 year of 50 billion. That makes it seem more efficient than it is.
I will continue eating meat.
Did you make a "you should kill yourself... NOW!" joke?
4:40 Hold on here. How the hell does it take 18kg of CO2 to transport 1kg of beef locally? The math doesn't add up at all, you would need to burn an insane amount of diesel to move 1kg to produce 18kg of emissions.
gooooooooooooooooooooood
0:03 and they already forgot the feeling if taking a fat shit 3 times a day
So now we're blaming cows farting for global warming
The Mongols were over whelming the Chinese for decades due to a diet. Don’t let people fool you, The reason why they push a plant/bug diet is to weaken you, to weaken your immune system, to weaken your bones, to weaken your muscle. Eat meat and thank God that you can make that choice.  Sustainable farming is the solution to every problem we have, for profit food organizations are the enemy.
Just the question on what number of plants become available to you as a source of beneficial nutrition, then on the range of their benefits, quality of effects to shape ones system overtime, does well to underscore some point. When so often the land has been reduced to nothing, it is optimal and most functional to have fields with admixtures of permanent plants, over the monoculture tillage less than one year life span plants, then of whatever at times decrepit supply chain down the line from that. There are designs that best utilize land through controlling water flow with plant guilds, then some ideas from agroforestry. Cutting down old growth primary forest is madness in these times and sooner a sign of a sick society. The amount of inert land around suburbia, the volume of space there could be seen as ill used. If people had to walk for their necessities, how many of them would they have access to? Is a question that gives a sense of scale to the kinds of systems that should or could be operating, maybe a maximum sense to the effectiveness of roads at times. Greenhouse infrastructure could in one aspect be a norm or extension to every home. Not sure the resources to get that running though. Considering the complexity of the system of plants that can be grown. One would think that a healthy society would or should have people involved in some environmental activity if not for at least a few hours a day or a few days a week as incorporated into some norm, i guess depending on climate. Full time doesn't sound bad either. - - - Random passing thoughts, but something around optimizing the amount of space that has already been cleared, the amount of abandoned or inert space in society?  the density of ecological processes you can fit along the lengths of a path compared to the length of the road as more compact and dense, how roads result in some environmental simplification that feeds back into the society eventually overtime, might be a source of their declines at times.  Some dichotomy between our use rate of oil to the possible growth rate of the planet, or water flow. Maybe surface area. How many functions can you fit through a meter of cement compared to a meter of soil? In that way sod grass is not unlike cement functionally lol, but you got to water it. Get cement lawn, don't have to do anything. Or breath either apparently. However many roads or vehicles are necessary, however many are too many, there was probably a line somewhere wherever it was years ago. Cheap restaurant infrastructure, if one was to look at the volume of land surface area it consumes, assuming how many people to drive to them day to day, what other viable options there are, if by replacing cement with some sense of an ecosystem. Issue is a lot of old growth and primary forests are gone, the world can never return to what grand majesty it once was after that, but least we will cease this choked out like ending of it, should be a main focus societies today. - - - Geoff Lawtons and Greening the Desert are fascinating leads. The Eden Project in Cornwall, England, random nice reference. Would wonder what the best examples of polycultural plant gardens are, when so much of society has lost a mind for it now.
You mentioned how beef has more protein than veggies, so if everyone switched to a plant based diet, how much more plants would we have to plant?
Went vegetarian for both Ecological reasons but also Ethical reasons.
sooo, animals and cattle release CO2 and Methane when they are alive. Shouldnt that be more of a reason for us to kill them and eat them. Cuz when they die they no longer release methane. So eating meat helps the environment by eliminating the potential methane and co2 that wouldve been released had these animals stayed alive. no?
I was really surprised that pork isn't that much worse than chicken. I don't think that's common knowledge yet. I feel sorry for the animals but can't imagine becoming vegan. However, to avoid beef and limit other meat intake, that's something I should be able to commit to. Thank you for the video 👍
so, it seems that the most efficient decision would be to eat less meat... i wouldn't mind. In fact, i'm actually doing this since a few months ago: stopped eating meat on the weekdays, only reserving it for the weekends, and a small portion. Well, the prices of meat going high here in brazil may have been a contributive factor... XD
Please do a part two on the future of farming, lab grown meat, how space colonies will eat, and potential alternatives to food in the future.
So much of the crop is fed to farm animals because its not suitable for human consumption
There are a few things I believe are worth mentioning. 1. Switching to pure-grass fed doesn't mean less beef. If you allow the feed crops to die and don't replant them, they can be replaced with native grasses, which cattle can graze on. You could also plant a small amount trees here with minimal cost to the amount of grass. If they produce food, then it becomes a small bonus to production. In other words, restore the natural savanas. The selfish argument for this is that then you can get grass fed beef. The selfless is so that emissions from cattle and harvesting are reduced, and there are also plants to remove carbon from the atmosphere. 2. A tofu burger actually kills *more* animals than a grass fed beef burger. As counter-intuitive as that is, even without pesticides, when harvest time comes, there are a lot of animals in the farmland. They could be birds, frogs, or many little bugs. When the combine rolls through, they have two options: run or die. If they run, they live in a disrupted environment, and disrupt wherever they wind up. If they die, well, they die. A grass fed burger only kills one cow. If the cow accidentally eats an aphid, oh well. That's the circle of life. 3. Today, the harvesting combine produces emissions when harvesting, which even if this isn't any more than that produced by cattle on the same amount of acres, it's still worth factoring in.
8:42 what does "industry" mean?
if you want to dislike this video, use me as your dislike button ;)
Hold up, I feel like they are missing  data here.  Cows can only emit what they took in.  which means cow farts are Carbon neutral which means that shouldn't be included in the calculation at all. and since that's the majority of the emissions from them all the graphics they used are total bunk.
Vegan teacher trying to explain why meat is bad be like
Bruh this is literally me after taco bell 5:32
I agree with everything stated in the video, however I'm curious as to how lab grown meat would compare
what i do is just don't eat beef, and save pork and lamb for occasional treats, since other meat is a lot more okay
Why nobody questions overpopulation when it comes to climate change? We could solve the problem by simply cutting world population by half while not having to stop eating the food we love
I wonder how lab-grown meat would measure-up.  Especially as it became more normalized and available.
I like Kurzgesagt, but you missed a really sensitive but essential part of the global warming. Overpopulation. It would've been interesting to see how it would affect the overall status of the global warming if fewer humans would roam the Earth. (I remember you covered this a few years ago, but showing it here would've been interesting too.)
This video made me wonder how much iron we could liberate by dredging the sea floor.
I find no diffrence between meat and meatless burgundy all I care about is cost
2 potential solutions though. 1 lab grown meat. 2 making a kind of mega structure in space that could be used for food production
Just Go Vegan, save the animals, save the planet, save your health
You will eat bugs and you WILL like it
Ok, Kurgesagt. At 4:25, why do you compare a trip by boat against a truck delivery? Avocados must also be transported by truck to a local supermarket. It seems disingeneous.
Man, now I'm hungry...
When I really think about it beef lamb and pork are all probably a small percentage of the meat I eat Majority of me to eat is deer and moose and well hunting probably steals a large amount of profit from the meat industry if everybody did it it would never be a good thing
Moral of the story even if we convert all possible things into 3 billion hectares of land into forest we will still be waaaaayyy over our carbon omissions. Cuse if we praduce 50 billion tons of CO2 every year. In only a decade and a half we already would be way over budget over 800 billion tons in 16 years vs the 800 billion tons from trees of 3 billion hectares over 100 years. Aka we're still fked. Nice 👍 new planet needed
There are some wildly incorrect statistics here, for example the best beef in the world “arguable of course” come from a farm in Georgia, White Oak Pastures and the LCA (life cycle assessment) shows their beef is negative to a factor of 3.5 or purchasing 3.5 lbs of the beef means the equivalent of 3.5lb of carbon sequestered. Also without large ruminant animals on the landscape specifically prairies the land will degrade, retain less water, and become more prone to fire. For anyone interested please take a look at Holistic Planned Grazing or Adaptive Multipaddock grazing. Regenerative Ag and Permaculture practices demonstrate solutions to this perceived issue. What needs to be done is change all farming practices to be inclusive of and a benefit to the surrounding environment. All chemical and synthetic ag needs to be phased out and a large focus on soil health needs to be our global focus.
Propaganda regurgitation. Just look up Alan Savory and Pleistocene Park if you want to see how animals are necessary. Kurzgesagt even got livestock feed beyond wrong. Don't forget leaving out that cows are carbon negative, as they sequester it.
Meat isn't bad at all lmfao
i think you are a fan of beef bro
If factory farming is actually better, then how about we dress up these factories to look and feel comfortable for the animals, and capture 100% of the methane. We have the technology for perfect indoor climate control. We could then switch to 90% animal factories with indoor grassland, and with a nice fake sky. 🤔
Still the biggest problem is that I regular human can do nothing about it since I'm bound financially and don't have a position to make changes
Hmm. Better not touch on the fact that the beef industry is only efficient in Western countries. China and India make up for 85% of cattle methane production because, despite the population disparity, they have not streamlined their agricultural processes. Vegan and vegetarian diets are also extremely unhealthy on a long-term basis. You get no viable B12, amino acids, or zinc. This video needed a lot more research.
Still going to eat meat anyways.
you don't have to cut down forests, if you're smart enough to do agroforestry
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day" well actually 😏
"it is the only pleasure you enjoy multiple times a day and doesn't get old" i think there is another pleasure like that man, food is not the only one
We're boned so long as we keep the system that cares about profit and literally nothing else.  Try to fix capitalism with realistic ("extreme") carbon taxes and capital will either move out, or move ~you~ out violently. Eat the rich. Solidarity forever.
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old” 😳Uh… actually, aboouuut that…
vegans would be taken more seriously if not was for their pseudo-morals.
I am getting a feeling that this video was biased towards plant based food. We can't ignore human nature on topics like these. While true, ideally lowering crabon emissions might be a good thing, we need to understand that we can't just change millions of years of evelotion and tradition in which mixed diet is big part of it.
No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old...
I think that we just need to engineer more ethical and sustainable meat production. I think that there are some small changes that we could make that could go a long way that people aren't realizing. For instance, could we not just grow more grass in order to feed cows? I think that there are several logical fallacies in this video.
Another misleading video from a channel claiming to give us facts and information about important topics, I suppose the groups who give grants to this channel are pushing this false plant based narrative will somehow save the planet.  Cherry picking data and presenting arguments out of context is just dishonest.
As a hindu I feel guilt free 😌
I lost it at "BEEF STONKS" A+
Pure propaganda, cannot fathom why people cant see through the lies being peddled here. People are being conditioned to view eating meat as being bad for the environment and eat plant based "alternatives"  which have lower nutritional value. In the end we will have physically and mentally  weak human who will be susceptible to all manner of diseases and manipulations. People should eat as much meat as possible-  beef, poultry and the rest, let no one lie to you about global warming and stuff. We are here since our ancestors hunted animals for food. Humanity will become extinct if the nonsense being hawked in the name of science continues. People must wake up
Is the carbon that is released into the environment from food already in the carbon cycle or are we adding more of it?
So be vegan 🙂
MEAT İS THE BEAST FOOD MATE
food aint about morality, its about well being, u do harm either way. Only thing wrong is eating for pleasure, to kill for the pleasures of ur own taste buds. eat whatever u need, but when its only for the taste its wrong. imo
I don't care about my carbon food print, I will keep eating meat no matter what. The only thing that can change my mind is artificial meat. Not that "impossible burger" BS, but actual meat created in a lab from cow stemcells. I don't have issues with eating ecologically friendly food, as long as it's beef.
i am not sure about you but i am never giving up beef
Why is this planet messed up? Because humans are beefin'.
You had this ready - in case YouTube ever removed the Dislike button didn't you? :DDDD
his murder really that bad?
i agree, food is contributing too much to climate change. im going on a diet; one meal every year.
as a climate enthusiastic - MIND BLOWN
Kurzgesagt got dunked on and they really out here trying to put opposing arguments together?
I didn't fall for the "clickbait" because I already knew the answer, but this is a good way of reaching more people.
Vegan gang!
I still like my Saturday BBQs tho. ❤
Meat is not the enemy. Capitalism is the enemy.
Kinda felt like apples to oranges (pun intended) comparing transcontinental avocados with local beef. Why not compare transcontinental fruits/veggies with locally produced ones?
that statistic about 1/2 of non-desert/non-ice land being used for agriculture blew my mind
that vegan teacher should watch this
Sure, beef is the most polluting and unsustainable. However, not everyone is suited for vegan diets--there's even some people who have to go raw carnivorists to survive. You're also not accounting that transportation may soon not require as much emissions. And there's also regenerative agriculture and permaculture, none of which are necessarily vegan. I think vegan propaganda is very biased. After all, not a single group of peoples in human history has ever been strictly vegan and survived.
I haven't looked into this much, but according to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations)  86% of livestock feed is not suitable for human consumption. That was never mentioned in this video and I think that might change the results a significant amount.
Meat is bad for you tho
Take areas like the Saudi Arabia for example, the land is dry and is just a desert where you cannot grow anything there yet since ancient times raising cattle like goats has been extremely famous over there. You also have to take into consideration that what we eat from a plant is only a small part of it and what's fed to the animals isn't what we eat it's what was left over that we can't eat.
The Video felt more Neutral and Informational than most Videos you can find on the Internet from both sides. Well done.

I appreciate that this is a 12 minute video and that it cannot possibly address every nuance in so short a time.  That said, there are approximately 93 million cows in the US today.  The average size of each cow is around 1,400 lbs.  In the 18th century, there were about 60 million bison on the prairie with the average sized animal weighing about 1,500 lbs.  And that's to say nothing of all of the other ungulate species that were either extirpated or saw their numbers greatly reduced over the last couple of centuries.  If the country could support those animals on pasture and with minimal environmental detriment then, why are they problematic now?
I think we can buy earth  some years  by switching  to veggies,  thanx for being objective
4:45, found this mind-blowing
go vegan :)
I'm a little irrational when it comes to this topic. I avoid meat because I just don't want animals to be treated cruelly. But if it means the world not ending as quickly then that's just a bonus!
5 on trending? Congrats !
Go vegan fuckers!!!
This video made me eat some BBQ
i still vote for decrese of population  1 billion maibe?
It is the best food you can eat and the sole reason humans have evolved into intelligent animals.
No sources on the lifecycle stuff, so as expected, this is a BS vid. Moving on.
meetheen
Ohhh that fawlty sweater is cuuute.
What I miss in this debate are pets.  I regard pets in a broader sense, I mean all animals people own for fun. Especially meat eating pets like dog and cats or bigger animals like horses should also produce a higher Co2 equivalent :D
I hope you eventually go over the topic of Lab Grown Meat. Maximize efficiency while eliminating cruelty by just directly cloning muscle tissue on a massive scale.
*Cultured meat.* Why have you avoided this option again, @Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell ?
Where da £uck Is the Dislike button!? 🤦 I hate YouTube and their butterfly politics.
I have bought your immune book and boy am I blown away by all your illustrations and simplification of such a complex system! I am seriously sad that it took me only a month to finish. Would like to see more such books!
Thank's ! <3
Yes I have decided. You have said yourself, even if everyone in developed countries lived at 100% sustainability, it will do next to nothing as it is the disgusting corporations and governments who are the main culprits behind everything, and are trying to guilt trip the common person into thinking they are the ones at fault. The idea of personal carbon footprint was introduced by a fossil fuel company ad campaign. Eating meat or not will literally do next to nothing
HAEV U TRIED EATING NOTHING THO?
0:42 Just though of a way how I can eat as much meat as I'd like and would also solve climate change *AND* overpopulation. Soylent Green. Too bad that this kind of meat preference is frowned upon. ;p    In case it isn't clear already. This is a joke!
Climate change does not matter to me unless you get India , China and all the other  big polluters  to change their filthy habits .
Largely skipping over fish was odd enough, but to not have anything to say about eating arthropods is...interesting. Also not sure where you're getting the impression that alternative diets are even a thing for most people. Getting enough dietary protein from plants outside of a developed nation is generally not an option. 'We could free up x amount of land land' might as well come with the disclaimer of 'if we ignore literally all human logistics of the situation'.
Congrats on 17M subs
I would love to see your take on Insect Meat, i really believe it's the food of the Future, but maybe I am Wrong
The fact that I'm eating and watching this feels illegal
THIS IS PURE "CLIMATE CHANGE" PROPAGANDA!  TOTAL BS!  The climate has been changing for 4.5 billion years - it won't stop!
Counting farts of cows is so stupid lol. You can make case like that to not have pets aswell to be super efficent 🤦‍♂️
At 6:02 I immediately thought of Brazil. Amazing video as always, Kurzgesagt.
I'm not a big fan of meat and recently I've found I have B12 deficiency. Still I don't like the way vegans like to say their diets are healthier, because nutrients aren't absorbed the same way. As explained in the item 2, cows, pigs, chickens and fish are means of converting vegetables' nutrients into something easier to process. Fish for instance convert long chain omega 3 from algae to short chain omega 3 (the ones we can absorb easily.)  And after all these years I still think the best way to tackle climate change is depopulation. Less people, less emissions, less deforestation.
chicken is the best food.
The graphics are everything. Great video. 😻❤️ tickle tickle
And locally produced food is is often not even necessarily cheaper or healthier than imported food. I agree that we should all try to support our local communities but to wha textent? I am talking about +50% or even +100% more expensive price differences between locally produced and  and imported foodstuffs. We just can't expect everyone to start paying double the price for what they eat to support local communities.
Great video!
The fucking soymilkbox has me dead
Lab manufactured beef would’ve been a great discussion topic for this video! 🗿
However much I appreciate this channel, this video is cow s**t. The numbers they use are totally just pulled from nowhere.   Animal proteins up-cycle tons of inedible stuff and waste from veggies into nutrient dense protein.   Anyone wanting a detailed rebuttal should check out the “What I’ve learned” channel. They’ve done 2 detailed videos on the subject that specifically address some of the lies from Kurzgesagt on the subject. They have a political motive not an objective scientific one on the subject.
Germany 1900: 56 m inhabitants 19 m cows Germany 2021: 82 m inhabitants 11 m cows i dont think this should our main focus when talking about climate chance. They are just like us part of the natural carbon cycle. We dont count 2tons co2 per human/year breathing into any of those statistics do we? Obviously we cant compare this to carbon which has been locked up in the ground for eons. Land use and animal feed is a major point of course and we should eat much less meat. But this whole topic is greatly exaggerated in comparison to everything else we are doing wrong. Sadly, this video is not talking about this.
Awesome video. Very well presented. A deeper dive on fish based diet and chicken would greatly be appreciated.
When you say we humans eat 19% of total soy crops and animals 77%, the 77% represents what we cannot eat. We can't and don't eat all the soy plant, we eat a small part of it. The rest is uneatable for us, so it is used to feed animals. If we didn't have animals to feed, we would still consume 19% of our total soy crops, and would be stuck with a lot of wasted energy (77% soy). I feel that this video doesn't go really deep and doesn't break down the data enough.
6K dislike, nice.

I think the biggest elephant in the room is this: huge human population. Any thriving human society will exploit the natural resource, there's no way around that. It's a matter of how much of it.  I think many problems (unemployment, nature destruction, etc) really only have that one single solution that no one really wants to say: reduce human population. Capitalists will hate that, since it mean fewer wage slaves, abrahamic believers will hate that since it's "God's providence" for them to thrive over the Earth.   But thankfully it seems, in limited sense we are going that way, with people going childfree and TFR below 2. But guess only time can tell whether this trend will last until human population are down under 1 Billion (it's not even at its peak yet).
i dont really care. Global warming isnt my problem.
Acts 10:9-16...it's all good
Beef free is must for better future
Until synthetic meat becomes viable, there's no hope in this sector
take-home message: make cows suffer. if they could, they'd do the same to you. got it.
This is pretty scary to think about, is there any way to make that number 0%?
The only thing that I would like to point here. The Amazon is not our savior. Only saving the destruction of it will do nothing if the US, China, and other countries that put an insane amount of carbon in the atmosphere don't agree and reduce their emission. The planet can't be saved by vegetarians, it's useless.
"beef stonks".... I almost spit out my drink
odd question but has Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell considered these 3 points when weighing the healthiness of cows for the planet?  It is not terrible if you haven't, just wanted to know. ps: it would be nice to see a future video on the impact of "no-till" practices on carbon emissions since you have made this video on farming. thanks.  -In the consideration of the carbon footprint of meat, farming practices used too feed cattle account for up to 83% of the total emissions.  -Electric tractors would only be able to help if "no till" techniques are implemented, soil that has been "torn open" by  plows releases most of the carbon that the grassland or crops have drawn out of the atmosphere back into it.  -No plow techniques also leave farmland that would lie bear part of the year suitably covered with vegetation for "near wild" grazing. While also reducing the need for nitrogen fertilizers and other high-carbon ways of increasing crop yield.
I hate this explanation because, feeding lots use grains, which produces more gas in cows (more methane). Grass fed cows produce less gas (methane) because cows can digest them better. Also localization is better because shipping containers produce more pollution and oil. Trucks produce less than big boats, and they travel in a less distance than shipping containers. In general those are very big misunderstandings that you made.    Edit I found out methane takes up about 11 percent of global pollution. The methane in the air gets turned into carbon and might get absorbed by plants, and grass.
I dont think its realistic to think people will give up beef any time soon, but I do think that its possible to deal with the extra emissions as a whole. nature has answers im sure, its been doing it for hundreds of millions of years.
One thing that you didn't mention, to my surprise, is the population of livestock. When you point out the counterproductivity of grassfed animals, you didnt mention that it's due to keeping the population (from factory farming to grassfed) the same. I.e. (100 grassfed cows produce more methane and require more land than 100 factory farmed cows). The high number of animals transitioning to a different farming method only sustains demand, but if the goal is to reduce greenhouse emissions, wouldn't the idea be to switch to grass fed AND reduce the population of livestock (ultimately people would have to eat less beef)?
you guys should mention that 3 Countries are responsible for nearly 50% of the world's beef consumption !! USA , china and brazil ... this makes a difference because the rest of the world  literally cant do nothing to fix this problem !!
Am I tripping or have they made this video before
While this was an accurate video, skimming over all the various non-beef sources of meat really leaves the viewer with an incomplete picture. There’s really interesting issues around things such as boar and deer raised in silvopasture and all the various forms of fish farming. For example, line raised mussels are one of the few Carbon negative meat sources! To be honest, the issue of meat farming could have its own series!
A quick note on the whole "cows turn useful the useless lands". I think that it should be questioned what counts as useful, what we can exploit directly for money? The Amazon is extremely hostile, it's horrible for planting we can barely hold a road together there and lots of it is unhabited. BUT the forest regulates the climate. Not just like in a global warming we'll day someday in the future way, it literally regulates rain in a relatively short-term. The southeast of Brazil, where I live, is already starting to feel the effects of deforestation with intense draughts, which are already bad enough even excluding the fact that we use hydroelectricity and now are plunging into a energy crisis that is forcing the reopening of thermoelectricity   Edit: Jesus Christ... Here, I hope this can clear things up: I'm not being combative towards the video or the channel, I just was expanding on a topic they brought up to initiate a discussion about it. I'm not saying they referred to the Amazon on that part either, I'm using the Amazon as an example to demonstrate that land can be useful for us as a species without it having resources we can directly extract for it (like food in the example they brought)
One thing that produces alot CO2 is this website. you can decide what you do with this information. you are the change. - your kurzgesagt team -
I suggest watching What I’ve learned’s video on this topic, might change your mind about some of the arguments.
This is Mooooving!
Nice video
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive”  Me: Arguably?
Conclusion : 'Meat *is* BAD'
Very nice video. This only touches on the carbon footprint which is just one side of how bad meat is. I believe it is cruelty towards animals and harmful for your body as well. But still, nice video overall.
Jcfta
I find it very hypocritical the west dictates and polices when a countries throwing down their forests to feed their populations when almost all of them have thrown their own Forrest’s down.
Still going to eat meat and beef. It is not that I do not care about the environment, it is just that I feel like that the momentum of what the world has been geared towards would take too long to make much difference for your average person. Hell we can not even get on the same page for a pandemic and that is much more immediate and in your face. The likely hood of a majority of people choosing not to eat meat and beef in particular, where they are already eating it, will not change significantly. If it is there to buy we will buy it. It would have to be reduced at the source, just as everything else. If the choice is to eat meat or not eat meat and meat is an option. People will eat meat. When people who have lived without much meat available suddenly have that as an option I think many view it as a step up in quality of life and want that option.
Nobody but kurzegstag could make me change my mind
These videos are the most beautifully crafted explainers on how humanity has engineered its own extinction
ban meat (jk we can't, humans would die long before they'd give up meat)
0:05 unless the food tastes bad. And food does in fact get old
It's easy become pesketerian
I really appreciate your unbiased reporting in the factual reporting. Really makes the community think. Great stuff
I'm vegetarian.
Do you think vegan teacher will make a video on this 😂😂😂
We dont need to cut down on the things that give quality of life we need to pressure the large corporations to develop alternatives. Like fx. methane capture is a thing, just not profitable enough.
Good video. Definitely makes sense to reduce meat eating for the benifit of the planet.
Personally, I found this very interesting and I gave it a like. But, I don't like that YT removed dislikes so use me as a dislike button.
this has got to be your hardest to underspand video so far
Could you do a video about lab-grown meat?
What about seafood?
Vegans rejoicing at this video. Cheers!!!
and that kids is why you should eat your vegetables
Am i a bad person if after seeing tbis a wont stop eating beef?
Chickens do not exclusively eat crop food. Check out the video of chickens used at garbage dumps. 8:27
I expected angry vegans in the comments and i am happy to know i was dissapointed
GO VEGANN!!!!!!
aye, whatever it is all going to go down anyways
If we were cannibals we would stop overpopulation and global warming. Badabing, badaboom
Nah. The experience of food gets old.
I’m still going to eat shteak lol
It's vegetables fault for tasting so bad that they are only appealing to animals, so we are forced to eat the delicious animals instead.
If you're reading this comment, it means you're doing great @about your health
Just gonna say, no matter what people say, I love meat and wont ever change that.  This video was interesting but once again will not change and become vegetarian.
Regular meat is obviously bad for environment and the animals🐄. Pls make a video about lab made meat. Video is as amazing as always 😄.
What am i gonna do?  I’m gonna keep eating those beef patties.
There's just too many humans for the planet to sustain the lifestyles we live. If we're not willing to change our lifestyles which is abundantly clear by now then we need to stop reproducing.
Cool video, but how do we actually tell we would run out of co2 to spare even if we minimize all emissions? After all,  it all depends on the number of people consuming meat. Rather than telling people to be mindful and not waste resources (not only meat but also clean water ect.) how about we prompt people to stop having 10 kids as if they live in pre industrial era and need free labor in the farm? It is not the people being wasteful its is the number of people being wasteful that is hurting the planet. I guess what im trying to say I wont quit eating beef just because some random family wants to have ten children of their own.
Hello Kurzgesagt,   Thanks for this video I am happy about your general approach to this, but I  believe you have totally ignored the fact that meat has diversified set of vitamins and amino acids. What I would like to see, how the diversified Vegan diet that supplies all the micro and macro nutrients recommended by who  compares to a meat diet with the same requirements, but of course like 20% or 10% meat not 100%. Also in my opinion who sets way too low suggested doses for vitamins, I take like 300-500% of this suggested amount for years and I have only seen positive impact on my well being and immune system.  I still believe vegan diet would be less impactful on the climate yet we need to consider budget and access to expensive vegetables like avocado.   Another thing is whether whole globe could turn themselves into such vegan diet and if we have enough fertile lands to produce such diversified vegetables at this scale.  Remember, not everyone can live off rice and soy exclusively nor afford avocados or meat. We completely took out fishes of the picture and they are so important in our civilization. Billions of peoples diet bases  on fish and sea food   This is complex topic and I don't think world should give up on meat completely. We need to decrease amount of meat intake to minimum. In my humble opinion, vegan diet is simply not realistic at mass scale. It's pretty hard and expensive to maintain the cell needs as crops and Vegetables lost over 50% micronutrients over the last 70 years due to maximization of farmers profit. I am supplying vitamins for years now having balanced diet and eating 5-10% of meat in my weekly diet.   Pro tip for everyone, maximum one burger a month ! Join me in this quest !
I don't care about emissions. I want my beef🐮

great work this info needs to reach everyone but you missed the one problem that animal agriculture is one of the major cause for global hunger
Is Meat really that bad? - and no mention of health impact by removing healthy fat and protein and replacing it with even more carbohydrates, or the fact we evolved eating mainly meat?
This video appears to indirectly imply that eating meat is a bad thing
There is NO climate change caused by humans! Climate changes for millions of years. Globalist propaganda!
Beyond Meat Their Burgers and Chicken Strips are amazing! and 100% plant based
The 4th REICH is here, telling us what to eat, where we can go, go tell this to China, russia  FUCK THIS SHIT !!
I cant wait for labgrown meat
You are qite trendy rn ngl
Love how they just state facts and don't guilt trip you into being vegan
that thumbnail spooky
Meat eaters right now: "Are we the baddies?"
Every meat eater: "yeah its superbad and destructive..., But ..."
Just keep on repeating that 'animals emit more than plants'.  What is the point in it...don't eat them just destroy?   Video says market has animals that are grown exclusively for the purpose of food is too less.. also transportation and packaging meat has little impact...so what is the problem? May be the existence of animal is itself is a problem....so we need to destroy all animals so that they don't emit anyshit anymore after they extinct....
Easy solution, lower the global population.
there are many more negative aspects to Meat than just the environment, animals are (often brutally) killed for their carcass, so it really isnt much of a debate to defend eating meat
BILL GATES enjoy this video
I Love how they explicitly tell People its better in every F*CKING Way to be vegan, but in the end they stil be like "yeah but f*ck all that just choose for your self little clever Monkey."
Everyone knows what would be the most normal solution to this whole climate change problem ---> Thanos snap for real.
not my problem
Just grow Kobe beef in a lab.
I'll stop eating then-
Great overview of meat's impact on CO2eq emissions, but greenhouse emissions aren't even the worst part of meat's environmental impact. Animal agriculture is the leading driver of species extinction, land use, water use, coastal dead zones, habitat destruction, oceanic plastic pollution, and potentially of antibiotic resistance among dangerous bacteria.
No matter what anyone tells, history does not lie. When industrial era started, the emissions went up. So, anything that uses a machine, will contribute to CO2. And I find it really difficult to belive that feedlot cattle is less detrimental than organic pasture beef. You forget to mention the GMO industry in corn aimed to feedlots, the massive amounts of synthetic fertilizer and the runoff causing the dead zone in the Mexico gulf, the algae overgrowth that kills animals and humans every year in USA, soil erosion. Organic grass fed pasture rotation that promotes biodiversity, does not cause these issues. All we need to do, is cut back on meat consumption. We need to cut back on anything consumption... really. We are a tape worm civilization, and if we do not change, we will die with our host body - the planet.
I've been vegan for about 7 years now, but after this video I really consider to quit.
Go Vegan.
All commercial meat should have a photo of the animal lookin happy before they get butchered.
Hopefully this video won't catch the attention of that vegian teacher.
I have a solution , we need to eat the cow farts :)
Tbh, the only real way to solve pollution is to lower the human population. Otherwise we're all fucked.
Yes. Eat bug.
can your studio make a video about "the largest planet" like the largest star and black hole
So human fart don't  impact climate?
What i do to reduce my carbon emissions, is not having children. Less people means less emissions to keep them alive, so to save the future use a rubber.     And maybe cut down on meat if you care about humanity's future
food
Was the 2 and 3 Billion Hectares if every single person had a beef free or vegan diet?  Because as great as an idea as this would be, it's nearly impossible :/
Dayummmmm. 19k comments in a day
I just don't really understand the attack on farmers about climate change. Cities and factories that have little association with agriculture pump out several times more greenhouse gases than farming. Everything just seems so political about the subject unfortunately. Like for instance, America is always attacked over their emissions, when China and India are the leading producers of CO2 emissions, producing several times more than the US, and nobody bats an eye towards them. I just think talking about emissions from farming shouldn't be a priority for people who want to combat climate change, at least not as big of a priority as they are making it. Just feel like there is a pretty large elephant in the room nobody wants to address because politics are holding them back.
the "beef stonks" tho, I instantly laughed once I saw the background without the wording😂
I don't even like beef
I hate the thumbnail
Carbon trapping is easy.  Plant trees->Chop them->Turn them into furniture  Lots of carbon that ain't going nowhere and isn't returning to gas form for a loooooong time. Wanna reduce carbon dioxyde? Buy more wood furniture.
Wait a moment - doesn´t crops during growth assimilate CO2 too? I mean - this is kind of requirements for plant life to actually exist by definition... That would means no difference between wild grass land and field of corn for animals right?
Notice how the top graph is for a period of 100 years and the bottom for 1 year. CO2 emitted at the current rate would be 5000 billion tonnes over a period of 100 years, which is much much more than the 800 billion tonnes of CO2 removed by this hypothetical reforestation.
But beefs tastes really good.
Where does insect, worm, and aquatic mollusk aquaculture protein potentially fit into this?
Whats the climate impact  of digital technology? Servers run on energy afterall
I'm okay with no beef. Just let me keep my chicken.
Oddly biased title.
Immune system cameo at 9:45
Bless every one who helps make these videos 🙏🏼🙏🏼 the meaning of life to me is the transaction of information from generation to generation, these go hand in hand with common beleif, you're changing the game by giving both perspectives and letting the viewer make their choice rather than posting biased videos
go vegan. you are morally, ethically and medically wrong, if you oppose. many people are still under the influence of marketing. wake up :D
I'm all for eating other meat such as pork instead of beef. Though I believe that food isn't actually that much of a problem in terms of emissions. The only reason I'd ever say I don't want to eat meat is because I bought the wrong product that couldn't be enjoyed, and yes, I don't enjoy a lot of artificially spiced up food.
Spoiler also : They will try to make you eat bugs
Can't wait for the emotional reactionaries to scream about Kurzgesagt being a soy-fueled vegan propoganda channel now.
Spoiler : It is really not
haha no dislikes
Sweating on carnivore diet.
Now THIS is the kind of content that will push science towards better solutions for the entire world. Kudos, Kurzgesagt. You guys are ACTUALLY doing gods work.
People never seem to bring up that there are a whole lot of things that can only be found in meat (for the most part), and tons of stuff that is in high quantity in meat. Protein is in everything that lives, you could go around drinking sewage and you'd still be fine for protein; same for every macro-nutrient, they're in everything. The issue are micro-nutrients, plenty of which only exist in meat or don't exist in large enough numbers in plants. Vitamin B12, for example, is found in abundance in animal products but can only be gotten from Shiitake mushrooms, seaweed, and tempeh if you avoid meat; meaning you have to consider the environmental impacts of growing these foods, not just grains.  We tried eating nothing but grains before, everybody got rickets and then we discovered nutritional science and stopped doing it. We should be trying to considerably reduce meat consumption, as even 100g daily is more than enough to get basically everything you need, but going full vegan will cause major issues; as well either start developing society wide health problems, or run into the myriad issues of trying to grow so many exotic plants in such quantity.
This is what vegan try hard to tell everyone. Thanks a lot Kurzgesagt.
omg finally anew viddd
"Isn't farming animals just a smart to make the best use of unused resources?" Of course it is, if you think like a psychopath, it surely is!
You are forgetting an important thing here: - organic farming without temporary prairies is extremely difficult. Say, alfalfa, or clover prairies that are planted to last a few years (3 to 5) to clean up your land of weeds, by reaping and harvesting the prairie very often, kill annual weeds before they have the time to produce their seeds, thus allowing you to remove heavy competition for your crops, as well as lowering the pressure of viruses and insects on your field (since said temporary prairies are not subjected to the same pests and diseases as other crops). This means that you end up with lots of alfalfa or clover hay, which can be used to feed animals, and in turn gives you lots of manure to fertilise your fields. Organic systems do and will rely a lot on animal farming, that is unavoidable, and saves farmers having to use pesticides, which in turn improve the environment as a whole.
I learned from this video to eat more meat 🤤
Awww I felt bad for the chubby red bird :(  I left red meats last year thanks to kurzgezagt, but I still feels bad for the chubby bird who likes burgers :(((
I really appreciate your attempt to investigate things without bias. I don't agree with all of your points but I believe you've done your best to look at just the facts and that is sadly lacking today.
0:05 releasing a full bladder?
I will not drink the soy. I will not live in the pod. I will not eat the bug.
I'm curious why you guys didn't mention agroforestry and silvopasturing. The combination of having chickens, pigs, and cattle on lands that are planted with nut bearing tree's seems like an obvious solution to recreating forrest and growing a healthy low carbon meat.
Ooooh argument starter  SEND THIS TO THAT VEGAN TEACHER  Oh god i wonder what would happen              P.s  Do this at your own will and [DON'T] credit me if someone actually does this
I loved the beef stonks
Would be great if there was a video on the impact of replacing all beef production with ostriches.  Would we have less climate impact with ostriches?
Just stop making babies fr
Im still gonna eat meat. Technology is ever marching forward and I trust in it handling the lions share of our collective emissions. I do wish we were more efficient in general though and we'll get there.
Short answer:yes but it's our fault for making cow factories
第3のトピック、人間の食糧生産地になり得ない土地で牧畜するのは利点しかないと思っていたので興味深い内容でした。 すべての食事を植物由来にすることには私はまだ健康上の懸念を持っていますが、より多くの食事を植物で代替するように努めたいです。
Not stonks
I know this is far from their point, but man, what I would give to play an RTS or strategy game with the art style of Kurzgesagt. Been watching these videos for years now and the graphics always look clean, fresh, and new. One of the best art teams on the planet, hands down.
We need pigovian taxes around meat. The cost of the damage done should be paid upfront and then that money can be invested in mitigation. Raising the price of meat would reduce its consumption.
I like that you guys actually did not hide the fact that factory meat production is actually better than locally. I'm still against harsh conditions in factory meat production but it is actually pretty nice that you actually showed us the truth
Humans are carbon based lifeforms. "lowering carbon emissions" is government code for killing off humans and mammalian animals while depriving the survivors of basic staples.  Im not giving up basic staples just to appease a few communists that want to dictate what i eat.
Excellent video, I love how nonbiased it is.
They claim that ships are super efficient which is true yet international shipping accounts for 50% of oil emissions. Nuclear shipping vessels need to be invested in.
I wish they would have covered the efficiency of the new meat synthesizing factories.
Vegan diet will never be an option to me, but I never liked beef that much anyway
i wonder how many vegans this triggered.
Kurzgesagt must have waited for youtube to remove the dislike count before releasing this video.
Time to go sci-fi! Vats, vats, vats, vats, vats, vats!
If you're going into efficiency the most efficient way to feed the world is maggot farms the only problem with that though is getting people to eat processed maggots, a 1 acre maggot farm produces the same amount of protein as a 130 acre soybean farm or a 3000 acre cattle farm
i'm gonna start eating more cows and pigs. more than i do today. fuck it. im gonna buy and cook steaks and just throw it away just because it pisses people off.
The only really good solution is making meat too expensive to eat on a daily basis artificially through governamental measures, is the only way to contain excessive consumption, even though is unfair to the poorest
Alright then, I'll meat you half way and only eat tortured cows from australia.
So the trillions of animals living in the wild are killing the planet by existing?  Do insects count? Coz thats quintillions. I mean they're out there living right now and they're killing our choldrens future home. How long has this been happening???  We really should start managing their numbers down to bare minimums.
When people tend to do intermitten fasting globally, demand for food and meat could be decrease significantly. Also its healtier for human body by doing fasting
Alright everyone time to eat bugs, and your own shit. Climate change is real (no its not)
Only to vegans
This, like many things, isn't a "heated topic" at all. It's just very vocal minority committing to misinformation because their pride won't let them admit their mistakes like climate change denyers or anti-vaxxers. I understand politicians and companies lying, but with the truth at your fingertips, you really have to be willfully ignorant to find a website to justify such dumb opinions.
I wish you would've also tackled the subject of fish and shellfish's impact on the environment.
What about sea food?
Unfortunately, this video didn't touch on the following points:  1- Nutrient density, the fact that meat is denser in macro & micro nutrients & amino acids overall compered to vegetables & fruits which usually high in one group of nutrients while lacking in others.  2- Vegan diet, requires farming more invasive plants species to meet the domain for for high fat - high protein plants, which over compete with other crops for resources & geography( such as avocado & broccoli).   3- water consumption, nutrient dense crops such as walnut & almond consumes large amounts of water to grow the trees to fruiting age.  4- 14% ~ 18% livestock GHG emissions, this figure is misleading as its a global percentage of the countries percentages. This ignores the facts that there are outlier percentages in the developing countries which have higher percentage not due to larger production of livestock but due to lack of technical advancement (factories, transportation, etc...). (North America (USA, Canada, Greenland and Bermuda, emits just over 0.6 gigatons of CO2-equiv per year, which is roughly ~1.2% percent of all global emissions).  5- Humanity going full vegan will only reduce emissions by just 4.3%, a recent “meta-analysis” of all the peer-reviewed papers on this topic found that giving up meat altogether would cut individuals' total emissions by just 4.3%.  6- Complementary duality of agriculture & livestock, farms produce crops for human consumption, crop residues sold for livestock farms as fodder, manure sold back to crop farms as organic fertilizers.  9- Chemical fertilizers, to produce a crops enough to satisfy the need fro humanity to go vegan, we will have to mass produce chemical fertilizers which will produce more GHG emissions than livestock could ever do, not to mention the pollution.  8- Number of livestock in north America, it should be noted that a recent study showed that the number of livestock in north America is nearly the same as it was before 1600 (around 75~85 mil), where hunting during the colonizing of the area drove buffaloes to near extinction, & now the total number of livestock & the wild life is nearly that number again (85~95 Mil). Which concluded that the GHG emissions from livestock shouldn't have that much of an impact on global warming.  9- Wasted food, one of the most critical failures of the food industry as a whole & plant based especially (due to short shelf lifespan ) is waste. As food waste is estimated at between 30-40 percent of the food supply in USA.  10- Smokescreen, it's has been noted by some researchers that oil groups are funding researchers, politicians & activists groups to market the livestock industry as the primarily suspect of GHG emissions to use it as smokescreen to alter attention away from them.
The way this vid was animated!!!!!! AAAMAZING
So long story short: WE NEED TO USE BOATS MORE
The planet is warming, has been for centuries and we CANNOT stop it,  nothing we as humans do will make a damn difference so why worry? Seriously...why worry?
Dislikes
It's fine, if we all have to limit the intake to save the planet, I'll vote for it. But I'll never take any personal responsibility. Either we are all in or I'm all out.
As a brazilian, im ashamed for being the only country cited on the video. But at the same time, its kinda unfair, because europe and the USA destroyed almost all of its forests and are not being held responsible for it. Im not saying brazil should be free to destroy the amazon rainforest, I recognize we have a greater responsibility, but we shouldn't be the only ones cited on the video. All countries need to help, first-world countries above all.
Calm down meat eaters (I am one too). No one's going to take your meat away. Seems like everyone's on edge in the comments wanting to fight against vegans.
Weird  how the only solution governments ever have to anything (ie climate change) is more taxes... whose funds dont solve anything and  always ends up being laundered into the hands of private oligarchs that create more problems....whose only response government has is to impose more taxes and laws....Create the fake political problem, mandate the solution that really creates more problems, and boom you have a cycle that makes the rich richer and the taxpayers poorer!
Thanks for being honest in this video, but I wish more people would talk about the ethics of it.
My solution: perfect vegan food to taste and feel like meat,govt replaces meat without telling anyone. 100s of years pass by and people are on a completely vegan diet.   Nutrition wise stuff some protein powder ig idk
Can those land be converted ?
4:24 - International shipping wouldn't be more efficient because you still have all of the local and regional shipping to to, just as with locally-produced food sources. It's just that the sea freight wouldn't add significantly to the total. It goes from the farm to the processing plant, to distribution centers, to the shipyard, across the ocean to your shipyard, to your local distribution center, to your store.   Locally produced food goes from farm, to processing center, to distribution, to your store. There are potentially less than half the steps and emissions of international food.  I know this specific example compared plants to meat, but they reiterated that international shipping doesn't make a big difference over local food, which isn't true
Fuck the climate, I quit eatring it after it being bad for the bank account after beef prices spiked in 2014 and never fell.
OH YEAH LET'S GO, BEEF STONKS  I laughed harder than I had any right to at beef stonks
This video doesnt require a "Dislike" comment.
NWO propaganda
I literally don't care about beef, because I don't have money to eat it. 😂👌
Wow I just noticed this video...and I also just noticed that Kurzgesagt got 1M more subs. NICE JOB! (P.S. YouTube needs to bring the dislikes back....I'm getting confused)
The most important take away is that the colonial diet is bad for the environment, and needs to be changed.  No meat isn't specifically the answer. The answer is entirely less meat, unless the environment dictates otherwise,
Food is not the number one bodily pleasure for sure 🤧
The best way to start addressing these problems is to listen to indigenous populations, but that would require the Western world to get to grips with its colonialism and imperialism so it's not going to happen.
are you're having a difficult time eating vegitarian food? Indian  cooking channels are always available on youtube.
I wonder if lab-grown meat could ever be mass produced and if it would even cut emissions.
You did not engage with the point that farm animals, especially cattle, consume the parts of crops that humans can't eat. It would be interesting to see this compared with other crop by-product elimination methods in terms of CO2 efficiency.
why don’t we just let Kurzgesagt run the planet 😭
What's funny is how alot of environmentalists say agriculture in totality not just meat is our problem. At least the way we conduct it at the moment. Apparently with alot of the chemicals and practises we use we are ruining our topsoil all of the world and will lose it for a long time if we aren't careful. Could cause global famine
Go vegan, I promise it’s worth it
Ostrich
Finally now without the dislikes due to leftist fanatics we get some less biased content.
Oh well, I dont like vegan and seafood, to bad… Honestly I love food, Ive seen so many people straight up lie about something ‘tasting the same’ or ‘just as good’ while clearly being different. I allready taste difference between pepsi and coke, but you expect me to believe your vegan burger is ‘exactly’ the same. So as long as people keep lying like that and thinking Im a fool Im no longer open to even try vegan, I expect everything to taste horrible and sold by liars who straight up deny they cant taste how bad it is. You only eat vegan for ideology sake, not for the taste.
i appreciate kurzgesagt stuck to their guns about the meat thing. the more i hear about this the more i think about going full vegitarian. I was curious about the pescatarian diet tho.
lab grown meat?
Ha! The Demon Sheep reference made my day.
Great, my country was mentioned in a Kurzgesagt video...
If you don't have to kill other living creatures to survive, just simply don't do this
When we talk about china's insane abuse of smog and these gases maybe Ill take note.
I don't know how common this is, but my local markets give their waste food to local ranchers who then feed it to their livestock. I'm curious of the impact of this as this is also a way to "recycle" organic material that humans simply can't or won't consume.
will 1 baby per couple over few generations solve global climate & resource issue?
Eat once a day.
"They got me on the first half, not gonna lie" -Average joe who ate meat everyday
"What's heavier: a kilogram of beef, or a kilogram of potatoes?" "Beef, Limmy." "But- but... its a kilogram of-"  "Its always beef, Limmy. There is no way to make it lighter. A kilogram Beef will always be heavier than a kilogram of potatoes, by carrying the weight of it's carbon and it's suffering." ":("
Insects??
That’s a lot to take in. I need a steak
Humans emit co2, so people who want to get rid of cow farms and make my grandparents broke, try, removing your self from the world to emit less co2
nooooooooooooooo MY COW:(((
Here's your next video.... all about artificially grown meat
Man I enjoy meat to much to care about the environment 😂😂😂 cut me some slack
Cow: Wait, do I get a say in this? What about "don't eat me?"
Got to love this response video to the original @What I've Learn video debunking meat polution. Hats off
My parents after watching: "Oh, you nerdy little creature." Me, with a persistent grin: *"BEEF* *STONKS"*
so basically weather we stopped meat or not, the problem is in producing food itself, thanos is happy
"You decide for yourself what to do with this information!" >get fucking depressed while I continue to eat beef
Over the next few decades, we are going to see a lot more propaganda from the meat industry
Why is the like to Dislike ratio hidden
Im goong to buy a steak for dinner just to laugh at the misinformation this video is, avoid nutrition and another 33% of information to make your point look correct.
wait how do large ships emit less than trucks? isn't heavy fuel oil far more of an emission than diesel or regular gasoline?
0-0
Beef ban.. beef ban 🙌🏾
Eat the same burger 3 times a day for years and then let’s talk about the best bodily pleasure 😒 … multiple times a day…
That vegan teacher is not gonna be happy witht his one.
I've been thinking about this for a long time: Cows eat grass ---> Grass gets its carbon from the air with photosynthesis ---> Beef is carbon neutral? I just can't find any information about this on the net...
Genuine question, doesn't cattle eat crop waste that are inedible for humans?  Can someone please explain
In a nutshell, it's complicated.
No matter how reddish purple you make that steak look i'd still eat it
How hard we try everything Will end anyway
Potatoes emit around 150 times less CO2 equivalents than beef. Potato supremacy
Make all crops solely for direct human consumption. Use the remaining land for rewilding schemes and game reserves and start a bush-meat economy. Therefore people get good quality meat from wild animals if they want it.
Chicken nuggets are the best
Watching this channel is so exhausting. Not because the concepts are hard to understand. But because I am constantly trying to filter the information out of the manipulation while being hypnotized by the beautiful colorful animations and the British accent. If someone asks me how to make videos to influence the masses, I will point them to this channel.
okay  i will buy lab meat now
No one talking about that stonks meme? Okay then
Let's see what a channel sponsored by Bill Gates has to say about meat. What a joke. Watch video called Is Meat Really Bad For Climate on channel What I've Learned for full debunk of this crap.
Thank you for comforting me in the fact that going vegan is the best decision I've ever made in my life, for the environment, for my health, and most importantly for the animals <3
you guys really need to be up front with the data being presented, a large amount of the food fed to cattle is the byproduct of food made for people that isnt edible
Wouldn't emissions from livestock be carbon neutral? They need to consume crops to have the emissions in the first place. Those crops take back in the carbon to be grown.
[sounds of meatheads shoving their heads even deeper down their as$es] 😂😂😂
Instead of vegetables, how about fake meats and their impacts on human health?
Oh nice, another repeat video. What a joke this channel is
Eat bugs
I miss when the content on this channel was about science.  Now, it's all about the damn political agenda.  I assume money is no longer an issue, I haven't seen you asking for money anymore.
why did you make another video about meat
Oh man am I happy Kurzgesagt made this video...I feel like mainstream media is finally shedding light on this topic. Factory farming is a destructive outdated cruel practice. But change doesn't start with companies or politicians, its starts with people . Ditch the animals products today so we can have a brighter future.
Ei, you didn't cover artificial meat. I was expecting it to be here.....
What if we need more cooking process which require more fuel for making vegan products? Will they become the worst food in terms of emission when considering the cooking process?
The unpleasant fact of the matter is, meat consumption at the level we currently use it is unsustainable. There’s no way around it, and despite the memes and jokes and annoyances of being told how good vegan/vegetarian diets are, if everybody did make the change to one, we’d not have to worry about one factor killing our planet, only the other 15/20 billion. Change sucks, nobody wants to change, it’s upsetting, depressing and sometimes you just want a goddamn burger, and it’s not nice being told you’re a bad person for wanting that burger, but if people could look at it in the sense of just going on a diet for the good of themselves, their children, other people etc, maybe it’d be easier. I dunno. I consider myself lucky for being able to break away from the meat addiction, but I still crave fish and seafood daily, just as I crave deep fried chicken and cake and other crappy food, but I don’t eat them because it’s not worth the damage for a moment of bliss, I’d rather just play videogames, read a book, paint a picture, snort a line of ketamine I dunno.
I mean I, personally, am 100% behind the idea of a future where all meat products have been substituted for vegetable-based options. Or maybe lab-grown meat? I heard they've _grown_ chicken nuggets, which is AWESOME. Obviously, the process would have to be made faster and more cost effective, but I think that's totally possible with enough funding into tech development. I'd love to see a video on this stuff! :)
Damn it’s crazy how much work goes into this
I'd love to see some comparisons to other meats as they've been only mentioned on a sidenote. From the statistics, it seems like pork and poultry are way more "efficient" in producing proteins / calories than beef. Is there a similiar increase or decrease in emissions under the right circumstances as you've mentioned with beef ? a tenfold difference for chicken would put it at "only" twice the ammount of potatoes for example.
When we've generically modified cows and other meat farmed animals for higher yield why can't we genetically modify cows for lowering methane emission or eliminate it
I seriously struggle to understand how Americans are so insanely hostile to the idea of eating less meat. The average American diet is so ridiculously beef heavy, everyone is fat as hell and drops dead of heart attacks in their 50s, people who are very well fed still manage to be malnourished because they barely eat any fruits or veggies. Reducing meat consumption wouldn't just be good for the climate, it would be on par with or possibly even better than universal health care for improving the average health of the American population. Sometimes it's hard to believe how this country can be so willingly self destructive.
#3 ON TRENDING!!!! CONG!!
this is how to effectively persuade someone to become vegan, not constantly berating and annoying everyone that eats meat. *cough vegan teacher cough*
Oh crap rice makes methane!?
8:00  I just did a paper in this, while yes most farm land is need to sustain cows by feed… all that feed is then used in factory farming, if we took out the factory farming we could radically increase the amount of graze land. To get here we need to stop factory farming and cut back on meat about 50% and we should be good!
Sounds like humanity's population is excessive, and realistically feeding that population will continue to accelerate climate change faster than we can handle it..not to mention our consumer culture on top of all that. We gotta encourage people to have less kids living forward through generations
I feel like the worst offending farmers in brazils meet is taking up for far more of beefs CO2 than that from a farmer in England. Also I've seen a study stating 1kg of CO2 per avocardo.
Main thing I focus on as a Chef of 14+ years is not to waste food. Most of this beef harming the environment is thrown away, and it's disgusting... supermarkets, lack of butchers, or wholesalers just throw meat away every day
I will never stop eating beef, in fact I will eat more. I am a human being and I will never cow to the globalist, leftist and BLM bug eating scum. I am human.
The diagram at 9:33 is kinda misleading. The one on the top is per 100 years, but the one on the bottom is per year.
Should change the title to "is beef really that bad" , and make a another video about Meat in general.
That vegan teacher right now: I hear a potential content creator to harass
So nothing about the morality behind current meat and factory farm practices? Really? Yall really went full on the annoying, tone deaf stemlord take.
Love the video! Every person should have to watch this before entering a supermarket
Man, I'm not satisfied about the answer of this video, but in the end it isn't about me, it's about the wellbeing of the world :(
Note that we are made out of meat. And it would be easier to make more human meat form other meat and not from trees or plants. BTW, almost all meat is edible and almost none of the trees and plants are edible. People tend to think that meat is like chocolate or something. It is vital to our health.
Not new haven’t watched it yet it is good 👍🏻
Such beautiful systems thinking 😍. I've so much respect for what you're doing! THANK YOU!
i wld like to see the ethical (and health) side of the argument being discussed as well as I feel like some people may not feel the impacts of the environmental side resonate with them, and the other two arguments can be persuasive
Don't worry about the Omicron mutant virus! Only 200000 people were newly infected in a one day!
Xbox Ahoy !
This is the easiest problem to solve. Stop having kids, there’s to many people on the planet. I’m 50 and I chose not to have kids so I will continue eating beef and driving a car with a big V8 engine without an ounce of guilt.
I feel like I'm on an episode of Jeopardy Kurzgesagt: "The reality is . . . it's complicated." Me: "What is the meaning of life?"
Let me guess - vegan propaganda?
Очень интересно. Пойду стейк, что ли захаваю.
Meat is delicious, all you vegans keep on veganing more power to ya, but just as being vegan is your right eating meat is mine.  We can find a middle ground
The only solution is lab grown meat or better plant based meat
No cause....its how this is #3 on trending - I guess whether beef is good or bad is a debate the world needed to hear.😌💀
People saying food is one of the best things in life are essentially drug addicts.  Or Dogs.
the ultimate video for "The Vegan Teacher"
I wonder when are we going to start to talk about CO2 footprint directly and indirectly from each human, separated by each country. Now that is going to be a heated topic!
0:01 oh yea thanks for that information, too bad i can't eat food because i have no teeth.
Climate change isn’t real and the biggest polluter on the planet is China the us has a massive population and we still strive to reduce our co2 emissions, this is a dumb discussion.
9:35  "800 billion tons will be free in 100 years" "As comparison, we only emit 50 billion tons in a year"  So..... 5000 will be emitted in 100 years? Why use different time periods, and compare 1 year emission to 100 year benefit? This is very confusing
Go vegan 💪
I couldn't pay attention to this video because I was to busy drooling each time he showed a picture of beef
Only poultry and seafood should be legal.
In the Middle Ages they thought that humanity was doomed unless we fasted half of the days a year... humanity has always found a solution, live happy
I love food
Thank you so much. Unfortunately I’m now paralysed on making a decision due to over analysing my best and sustainably long term option
Is carbon a pollutant?
I suggest that make video on  dengue and response of immune system
wait did he say use up our entire carbon budget by 2100 at 1:40? what does that mean? Human race goes extinct?
Beef is staying on the menu, the environment will just have to take another one for the team.
Does your calculation about the proportions of crops used for cattles vs humans takes into account the fact that a lot of the parts of the crop are not suitable for human consumption ? (stalks and the likes)
I'd rather just eat less meat and purchase from farms that treat their animals with respect.  Perhaps, Kurz could make a video about lab grown steaks :))
You should make your videos HDR - the colors would really pop!
wait a minute, i thought you guys said that water waste was a huge ecological impact from meat industry, and now you dont even mention it? maybe its not that big of a deal anymore?  hahahahaha
but meat is so good and tasty why does it have to be so horrible to the environment :(
Me being environmentally conscious makes me appreciate why some people are vegans
Extremes of anything are bad if you eat meat eat less of it.
I would be baffled if you managed to change 10 meat eaters' views
Sounds like the easiest and biggest impact solution would be to eat less beef.
ok that beef stonks get me so hard 🤣🤣
I once saw articles about mushrooms fibers as construction materials, I wonder if there are ideas out there to use living plant's and tree's in construction to lower the co2 footprint
S - did you watch this video?
800b tonnes co2 removed over 100 years, 50b tonnes produced per year, means 5000 over 100 years, right? My only disappointment about this video
Wait one question though, because I know that often these numbers that say "50% of this good is used for feeding xyz" they count all the places that use any part of the plant to feed cows etc, while a lot of the stuff given to pigs and cows is just the stock and the parts of the plants that we humans can't eat. So are these figures correct? Is it indeed that much persentage of edible crops or crops that are also used to feed humans?
I just eat and sleep and I can't Swallow anything without some meat taste so I guess I'm a carnivore.
If meet production would drop by 70% if we went all grassland that would still be totally doable. Taking a high estimate of a person eating meat 90% of the days in a year one could still eat meat 2 days a week, 1 to 2 days with fish and other see foods and 1 to 2 days of vegetarian/vegan which sounds pretty good to me
Just don't eat beef. It's bad for you anyway. How hard can it be?
As someone who religiously reads Edward/Evolution Man/What we did to father/How we ate father I consider vegetarianism an affront to our ancestors.
i like all kinds of meat, i could never go vegan, but one thing that should be 100% reduced or even banned is commercial finshing, does lots of damage to the planet
I'm just happy to finally have an honest answer rather than propaganda and for that I thank you
Going vegan is best.
And people still want to pretend that global overpopulation isn't a problem.
Is it by any means possible, to capture all this methan that comes from cows? or it is counterproductive?
Could you please share how these 26% are actually calculated? I've checked the sources you've provided, and they are just summaries of some other studies, which references are not provided. Just putting numbers on a graph without deeper explanation makes you just like any other media out there.. Thank you.
I am going to burn several tires on my lawn
carbon emissions is not even half the story of farming production. What about the diseases (Corona virus, chickens flu, salmonella and more)?? so even if it's more carbon efficient it's worse, especially when we consider that no one really knows how carbon emissions really impacts climate change. Not to mention that in the future we will probably have lab meat production
Bring back your video called “The Egg”
Quick question: if we, humans, found out how we could do a wintersleep. And everyone did that for the whole winter every year. How much would it change the climate
ok but how is the avocado/banana going from the container ship to your local store? Well it uses the exact same transportation method as the locally produced food product. So overall it emits more.
Meat is life.
8:40 does that account only for things that are edible to humans or are you counting by weight including the things cows can digest but we cannot, essentially turning waste into food? It'd be great if we could life off by munching on hay but alas it's not the case. Also, saying that going all electric won't change anything then ranting about how local production polutes too much because of gas guzzling cars is ridiculous.

Animals have rights!    The right to be tasty!
No mention of regenerative agriculture? This is the future of agriculture so I am surprised Kurzegat missed it. Agrivoltaics is another major innovation that should be discussed. Sheep graze seamlessly inside conventional ground mount solar. Specialized racking can accommodate cattle or any livestock
Can we please see the full range in emissions for other sources of animal protein such as poultry, eggs, and farmed fish? I think you would get far more people on a low emissions diet if you fully explore other forms of low carbon animal protein rather than suggesting everyone should have a plant based diet.
Its incredible! Amazingly present!
What I've Learned has a much better video on this topic
okay now every time I have an argument with a non-vegetarian person, I'll make sure to show them this video xd
So yes. It's really that bad...
we have to stop f*cking each other and giving unnecessary overpopulation is the most efficient way
Thanks for not selling out and telling us how it really is. A similar channel ( What I've learned) recently did a video on the same topic where he used some distorted statistics and a "scientist" funded by the meat industry to make meat look better than it is. It's nice to know that you will tell the truth no matter what they probably offer you :)
A question that I never see answered in this discussion, is: If we stop eating meat, we should also expect produces to stop cultivating cattle; also expected that in a country like Brazil, cattle would be dismissed in the most cost-efficient manner, if not slaughtered, would they just be set free? What are the impacts that a sudden decline in cattle population could have?
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times during the day and never gets old" *Der Coomer entered the chat*
1:32 a reason it's so high is because we have too many humans on earth, if anything we need to get it down to half of what it is now and keep it that way
Hmmmm
I'm already suffering from not being able to absorb nutrients from food and it makes me sick. Whenever I cut out meat and use plant alternatives, I get sicker and my doctor told me not to do that. Ideas for other ways to save the planet?
Hiiiiiii
Go vegan 🌱!  It’s better for you 👦, the Earth 🌍 and all of the creatures that we share this world with! 🤩👍🏻
This argument always ignores that meat is one of the major contributors to humanities intelligence as we evolved. Protein dense food directly relates to IQ.  Also why are we talking about food when energy is way easier problem to sell.
We just need kurzgesagt to run the world. Like dude the world would be so much better
Sounds like the number one way to help stop climate change is to stop destroying sensitive ecosystems like the Amazon rainforests.  Kind of makes you feel a smidge helpless. Even if I as an individual stopped eating beef entirely (I only buy beef ~one meal a week) it wouldn't have any impact in the larger picture because of the billions of people who have it as a staple. Any meaningful change has to come from governments and corporations first and foremost because I think if the past years have taught us anything, individual accountability and responsibility is not a reliable way to make huge societal changes for the greater good.
It seems vegans had a point, I won't apologize but pretend to respect you
You sure like to live dangerously
Hey Kurzgesagt, can you please make a video about the history of evolution of dog breeds? 🐶🐩🐕
Hahaha, beef stonks
Vegan for 1 year already and i haven't felt better physically, emotionally and mentally.
But what we could with this information? We could drastically reduce meat production. However, it just means that meat will be the product for elite and rich people. It isn't fair. I guess.
No eating meat products is fantastic.
Sacrifice pleasure to save the planet 😛
While a cow may eat 25kg of food to make 1kg of meat the majority it ate would be pooped out which could be used as fertiliser, the water they drink is pissed out and doesn't go to nothing. It's not like we feed the animals tomatoes and stuff but instead we feed then the organic stuff we can't eat like grass, wheat stem, nut shells and etc. The argument that we could use the land to grow food instead of animals is false since alot of the land isn't able to support crops due to being unhealthy or too dry
Can you do a video about vegan patties and other such food alternatives too? I heard they require a ridiculous amount of water and land to produce aswell
Wonder if you could do a follow up looking at lab grown meat? Just from a quick search it seems like it has a much better carbon footprint.
“Dark and difficult times lie ahead. Soon we must all face a choice between what is right and what is easy”
I said it once, I'll say it again. we need a BALANCE of things. we don't need full on veganism, we don't need full on 7 days a week, 3 meals a day, meat consumption. just eat both and enjoy it more. if we just ate vegetarian 2 days a week, that's already a lot less meat production needed, which in turn not only forces a lot of mega farms to close which is better for the animals, but it also lowers co2 immensely.
Nice explanation 😊👍
Just raise prices on beef and other meats, making them luxury items again, and people will eat less of it as a result. Worked in my country with cigarettes and alcohol. Humans are driven to over consume to survive as "an instinct" so to speak, but money is tied to survival too. So if you have less money by eating meat, then your brain is going to signal you to not eat that as much. This can be done, well, now. By any government. The reason why they don't is key to understanding climate change, i.e corporations...
so the ancient indians knew beef is bad for nature and decided to make it a god so people wont eat beef. smart

I know this is probably hard to quantify but how would a shift from beef to lamb/mutton or goat meat impact emissions? Both sheep and goats are often able to survive on land that cattle can't survive on (due to being more arid, lower quality grazing, etc), much of which would not naturally support prairie-style grasslands or forests, and which is unsuitable for growing crops on either (often somewhat rocky, mountainous and with thin topsoil). Moving to the means of livestock that can be reared on these kinds of environments would seem like a good idea but I don't know the actual figures on it
kurzgesagt: You can reverse climate change by transitioning to a plant based one   Meat Eaters: Oy fuc* off mate, it's not that bad (also, government should do something about this, our children omfg)
6:30 well well... looks like a fight between PETA vs Extinction Rebellion would be something fun to watch
Thanks for the video and the info, but I'm never giving up on meat.
Unrelated : i kinda wanna see a "in a nutshell vtuber" a bird v tuber of some sort
bruh why did they disable the dislike button? this anti negativity shit is bullshit
Comparing the mass of soy (or other cereal) given to humans and animals is fallacious : the animals get the rests of human food. We eat the grains, the juice/oil (soy as exemple), the rest go to feed animals, and would be lost if not. But the "human part" of cereals (soi oil for example) represents most of the cost and so why brazilian forest are burnt... isn't it ?
I think we’re overlooking the real solution to the carbon footprint. We could completely eliminate the issue all together by removing humanity, the true problem, and that will restore the environment. Return to monke.
A few people here are claiming that livestock feed is inedible and thus, justifies the meat industry, however, there are some significant problems with that claim.  There's a report called *'Tackling Climate Change through Livestock: A global assessment of emissions and mitigation opportunities'* that details this -- skip to about page 17.  It's not that livestock feed is made of inedible parts, it's that the crops grown aren't high enough quality for human consumption. The land is still used to grow crops, it's just that the crops aren't being treated as they would be, had it been grown for humans (e.g. with pesticides). The reality is that crop residue (e.g. stems, leaves, and roots) only makes up about a quarter of overall livestock feed, the majority is just poorly grown crops, on land that could be used for high-quality plants fit for human consumption.
The fact that free content that is as gorgeous and jaw dropping as this exists makes me hardly doubt the amount of effort and passion that goes into these videos. Truly inspiring and incredible.
I always wondered when people bring up the whole "cows produce a lot of methane" argument: Sure there are a LOT of cows on this planet mainly here to feed us. But, how does that compare to all the other animals on earth? How much methane emissions to the rest of the species on Earth contribute?
Awesome
Not all people can eat meat due to their economic situation, so i think the problem is meat distribution
the fact the "that" in the title is not capitalized is extremely enraging and i will proceed to make a dislike that nobody else can see
the appearance of 'beef stonks' really caught me off guard lmao
If cows weren't so damn tasty, we wouldn't have this problem right now.
If God doesn’t want me to eat meat, why did he made it so yummy
3:30 Best beef fan vs Average plant enjoyer
What about all the additional processing that goes into making fake meats? That has to be a lot worse than just eating a salad.
"no other pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and  never gets old" well if i have hands, im sure theres smth else thats better than food
Just one comment here. I only buy top quality beef, fed with grass. The one that pollutes the most.   But I buy it once every 3/6 months. The daily bad steak isn't for me.
I would like to see a video about bugs cause some people thinks that it's our potential 'future food' and best chance of fighting climate change. I'd like to know how much of an impact it will have on climate change and society in general since the world elites seem to keen on having it as alternative to proteins for us peasants.
For every animal you don’t eat, I’m going to eat three.
i really don't like some of the arguments presented in a half measure. unsub
BEEF STONKS
Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said he was willing to help Taiwan! Willing to help Taiwan refugees! We welcome Japan to accept Taiwan refugees!
I would rather die than stop eating meat and I’m entirely serious about that.
this video feels onesided to appease vegans. How does transporting meat causes more CO2 emission than vegetables if it is the same route taken ? it's not explained properly.
It’s important to remember indigenous, disabled and poor ppl in these conversations
Those evil animals destroying our climate. We must take action now and slaughter them all before it's too late.
DISLIKE
We eat too much meat Back on the days meat are hard to come by and that's why they are expensive and associated with prestige Market economy feeds to desire and demand for meat
I wAnt a seafood episode PLEASE
I wonder if it is posible to increase photosyntesis of existing plants or a bacteria with high photosyntesis
The emission study is riddled with wrong math data. Even the authors admitted this themselves after being called out
8:14 stonks
This is fake news. Deforestation DOES NOT playlist any significant part in Brazilian Meat or soy production.   Go get a grip on REALITY.   By the way : WHERE ARE THE FORESTS OF FRANCE, UK OR GERMANY? Come on. Only brazilian trees are sacred????? You liars!
Another video that more or less proves that we are way too many humans on this planet. Less humans, less pollution, less CO2 emissions, less food waste, etc.
We need non nuclear war to solve population
Whenever I am on youtube often I will look on my recommended for a while to find a video to watch. When Kurzgesagt releases a video it is often the first video on my recommended list. Either way, as soon as my eyes see it my mouse flies to the video to click on it without looking at the title much or any other videos. I always do that because these videos are consistently good. Keep up the great work!
Oh jesus you're on this again.  The carbon cycle is a thing.  It doesn't matter that a cow farts, that carbon was _already in the carbon cycle._  If we hadn't raised that cow, the carbon it farted out would have gotten into the atmosphere just fine when it decomposed by some other means.  The (arguably) problematic carbon emissions are from _extracted_ carbon only, like fossil fuels.  Getting very tired of you "not wanting to dive in too deep because there's controversy" when there's already controversy over how bad carbon emissions actually are, and whether it's within humanity's power to change things, and you have no problem going into that.  It's more dishonest of the Kurzgesagt brand than I've come to expect.
helo, it's me again! I would like to comment more... I feel something doesn't sit right with this episode. before I blabber too much negatively, I'd like to express my appreciation towards the Kurgesagt research team who have spent much time and efforts collecting information for this episode. sadly I think this effort was not done under a wise direction. The fundamental concept of this episode is to present the negative impact of eating meat. underline on NEGATIVE. so I can understand how the research team cherry picking facts and skewing the measurement data towards representing the worst of consuming meat. this is wrong.  From the get go, the fundamental concept should be focusing more on the portion of food we consume, because no one can't argue, in the end the carbon food print will grow the more we breed. it is not about whether we eat meat, but it is more about HOW MUCH we eat PERIOD. We all ideally, by right should eat a balanced diet which include meat as the main source of essential amino acid, which are the key component of our immune system (YOU SHOULD MAKE IT MANDATORY FOR YOUR RESEARCH TEAM TO READ YOUR BOOK!) What we all should fight is the culture of excess. A morbidly obese vegan lady in the united states definitely spend more carbon foot print than a skinny man in Cambodia who eat meat. So fundamentally, it is not about what they eat, but how much they eat! Imagine a vegan lady who binge on kilograms of chocolate every week, and compare it to village farmer in north Thailand who eat meat three times a week. I give your research team challenge to find a skewed fact to justify this! The culture of excess and greed is the main villain here, not the meat. Again, it is not about what you eat, but HOW MUCH you eat. You should also consider long term benefit of eating meat. The pre-Boomer generation in Netherland feed their children with high quality milk, and the later generation shows significant improvement on their average height. I may bet, if there is a vegan society who interbred, they will produce stunted and intellectually challenged generation in future.
i simply don't eat beef. It actually tastes awful anyway.. I eat chicken mostly and rarely pig. Overall, people should just eat less - look at all the obesity! Human bodies do not need that much food. It's not a question of survival, it's a question of pleasure, which everybody should learn to control.
Lol at the commenters that are still trying to defend that eating meat is not that bad. It's bad for the environment and very cruel to those animals.
Enslaving and breeding neuron equipped, feeling organisms is bad. Ending their existence and making them extinct is good, eating their flesh is no problem either.
This video has about 6K dislikes. If you want to see dislikes again look for the plugin "return youtube dislikes"
All it'll take, is a rock, like the one that killed the dinosaurs, to remind you we should have been building space ships the size of Kansas. Saving the rainforests? From what? The next ice age or pole reversal?
Seems like Big Broccoli Co. paid for this video.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day" Well well well, SOMEONE doesn't have a porn addiction.
Humans: Hey Nature, looking for some food, whatcha got? Nature: Haha, whatcha need? Humans: Ah, you know. Protein, carbs, sugars, various minerals and vitamins Nature: Gotcha Fam. Got a bunch of crops dedicated to producing those elements and molecules, EZ Humans: And meat? Nature: You what? They have nervous systems, respiratory systems, social structures, they’re cute and loyal. You wanna cut them down? Humans: Yeh Nature: Would you mind waiting here a moment?

I'am the dislike button!!!!
this is a repost
*intro narrator is a virgin apparently*
The topic of meat eating has to bring up the topic of human impulse control, behaviour, compassion, more than it does the topic what is good for us physically, because it's already been shown by so many people that you can live just fine off of many diets.  The art of knowing when too much is too much is more important to talk about. Like, how we control our own emotions and make intelligent decisions as a whole. We're really, really not good at that. Factory farming, deforestation, these things are Our fault, ultimately, because we can't get a reign on our impulses and corporations go out of control when the first paycheck comes in. And it's not just in how the world changes it's how we treat eachother.  When certain localised bubbles of society discovered that it was not a necessity to kill to survive, and that they had options, but still wanted meat - so still spun the gears of the meat grinder, for want - not for need - that's when we crossed the line into 'too much' territory. Look at carnivores in the wild. They don't have a choice, or an option, if they do not harness the dread fear of starvation into a killing instinct, they will die. We're given a remarkable opportunity to distance ourselves from that.  I do not see how the world would be a worse place if we distanced ourselves from that. I see it as kind of weaning from the breast of mother earth herself. All these little loops of forced emotional reality that these animals must cling to to survive, and we're smart enough to figure out ways to not take part. It's not like we will just lose the survival instinct, either. Humans are more than capable of educating themselves on such matters, of training, of practicing. Hell, most people between the age of 14-18 know how to use guns and some survival techniques just by playing videogames!  It would definitely aid our survival should we ever leave this planet, if we could cut out our obsession and addiction with meat mostly because of the benefits it will have on us mastering our impulse control. If we just swap over meat to plants right now, we'll be in the same situation environmentally, except there might be a bit more damage to the Ozone from all the Human farts as we now eat masses of beans. The benefit to the environment will come from better impulse control. And us quitting meat - even though we want it because it's so tasty - when we know we don't need it, would be the ultimate test for our impulse control. I mean, it's kinda important, this. If anything is going to spiral us into some kind of dark future, or no future at all - it's gonna be this. We need to get our act in gear and mature when it comes to this.  Lab meat isn't there yet, in my opinion it never will be, as the stem cells are harvested from fetuses, which aren't grown in a Sci-Fi channel green tube, they're born from a mother animal. In my eyes lab meat is less us weaning from the breast and more us desperately hanging onto an out stretched nipple by any means necessary. But plant based nutrition is getting there.  There are already tons of alternatives for meats and some of them are really tasty like the new FUTURE mince, naturli mince,  meatless farms, beyond burgers. The vegetarian butcher do plant based strips made to mimic chicken and it's the stuff KFC or Burger King use in their plant based chicken burger. Since I've adopted these alternatives, I've noticed a marked decrease in my consumption of these kinds of foods in general. They come as more of a treat, than something I eat every day of every week. This is the key to us being able to map out our survival into the future. If the whole human race has good impulse control then we can actually make a plan for us all for the future. If our production is at a relaxed level and our consumption doesn't start demanding it to go into an insanely high gear while some CEO barters with the devil to keep the money coming in- at our future's expense!!!! Then we actually have a shot at surviving into the future. Indefinitely if we get off this planet.  Take it from someone who had 4 collapsed lung incidents over 6 years ending in a double major lung surgery and diagnosed with emphysema before he finally quit smoking. Impulse control is important, lack of it is destructive, and the damage is irreversible.
Nice! I see somebody dove a little deeper into the topic then previously. Well done! As you said it at the end: now make with this information what you will. But it is fact.
Would like to hear what it does to ones health not only co2.. still dont know if its okay to eat meat
Please do the palm oil
Wath about people that dont care about the next gerneration ? Maybe people that cant get or dont want kids ?
They want us to eat bugs people. that's the end game. Look up Agenda 2030 - Enjoy you're starbucks cockroach milk latte and I can't believe it's not beef burger
Short answer: yes its bad
Bowhunting FTW.  Harvesting overpopulated wildlife from forested land  = negative C02 emissions.  Bowhunting is nearly renewable (no ammunition expended that needs to be produced).  Hunting licenses and permit fees fund land conservation and those lands trap co2.  Deer, for example, produce less methane the cows but harvesting overpopulated animals from naturally occurring herds cuts those emissions.  I bow hunt on my own property so I literally can walk my food to my freezer.  If I grow carrots in my backyard, I’d still be using fertilizer which adds to co2 emissions.  With a negative foot print, bow hunters are thus infinitely superior to vegans.
just go vegan. It's not that hard.
"No matter which way you cut it, you have to cut it"
What about feeding cattle seaweed to reduce their methane emissions?
Dislike
Absolutely brillant. I wish your videos had a bigger impact in our world as it sumarizes such important informartion in a very efficient (and beautifully illustrated) way. You are my favourite YouTube channel so far 💗
How many dislikes?
If one thing is true is that we need less humans and more trees.  It's not cow"s fault, or soy's fault. It's our fault.
Conclusion  "Dont let you cow fart"
"Even electric cars won't help", how not? Humanity still relies way to much on burning fossil fuels for energy. This impacts ANY production, not only food. Electric cars represent a new paradigm where the vast majority of transportation and machines are (hopefully) going to be electric, using electricity from renewables sources. Energy production is the main problem for climate change because it's in the base of everything else. Edit: Also, sure that eating less meat or no meat would help. But things like this won't solve anything while fossil fuels are still being burnt to run trucks and machines.
One might observe that Forest destruction in Brazil is driven by Wood production, the farming comes after the forest is gone. Also, most of this Wood is not consumed in Brazil.
sad there wasnt a discussion of the ethics around meat production, or other effects other than climate change such as anti-biotic resistance etc.
So in short, unless people consume a lot less meat, which they never will, we're all screwed? Excellent.
You bunch of fool how human and our close ancestors able to sustain themselves for millions of years in hunter-gatherer lifestyle by eating mostly animal products. For millions of years, we and our close ancestors mostly ate ruminant animals, which exclusively ate grass and other vegetation. Now you bunch of jokers come and tell everybody eating meat is bad for the world. The mono-crop agricultural system you are inspiring everybody to do is that any natural, do in millions of years any animals did this kind of grain-based agriculture. Try to stop fossil fuel, try to stop overpopulation, do not spout this nonsense.
So finally other countries are realising why cow is worshipped in india and why so many sages told to be kind to animals.
Whe are not in the 13th century. So we should act like it and be nice to all animals
E
8:33 Do you have any source for that?   Also, you're not differentiating between edible and non-edible parts. In 2018, FAO report claimed that 14% of edible crops is being used to feed animals. Rest is like stems and other parts that we cannot eat. Same with industry - using as an example of sunflower, the flower seeds are used for direct consumption or processed into oil, but the rest is either used as biomass for electricity or as a food for animals. If we didn't' do that, it would've gone to waste. Looking at the size proportions of the sunflower plant itself, statistically 80%-90% would've been used by animals/industry then...
I think if more people had to live within the smell range of a feed lot, there would be a lot less demand for beef.  That's probably the worst thing about living in my area.
At this point I'ma just gonna declare this a nihilistic situation. On one hand beef in general is hurting the environment. On the other hand switching to plant based meats and eggs means you're technically eating processed food, and processed food in general isn't good for us anyway. It sort of feels like a little win big lost situation regardless which path you take.  Also it really sucks that the crazy overlords running YouTube decided to take away the dislike button. It's a hot button debate, but again, not everyone is gonna take a side.
Like, this video was super great, but were you also jamming to the amazing music?? it slaps so hard!!
Well meat does eventually “get bad” after a while. As in non-edible. lul…
Have y’all done a video on how we have to stop eating fish or the ocean will die?
Just don't have kids and you can enjoy all the beef you want.  Not having kids is by far the most effective thing an individual can do to help climate change.
<3
With you wonderful portrayal of science. You do not remain objective. You appear to be. But your conclusions are inconclusive and directed in a certain way. F-
I love the channel but some things in this video are just weird.   So, we can send avocados on a ship and not emit CO2 but meat has to be transported by truck... ? Uh... ok. Doesnt change the video argument but does make It seems suspicious.  And the deforastation in Brazil for aggricultural purposes is a hoax. The main reason is actually the search for ore. And surprisingly or no, the biggest companies behind deforastation and polution of rivers and lakes in Brazilian rain forest are european.  Not even American! They are are german, danish, french...   Aggriculture and Cattle raising in Brazil comes mainly from center/south states wich have different vegetation zones between states. The Amazonian Rain Forest is in the north.
could fish be a better option to replace the meat that produces so much co2? it does not consume as much food and emits much less harmful gases to the atmosphere
I love that pronunciation of controversy. :0
Did you edit you title because my notifications for you channel is on and when you uploaded your video I'm sure it said 'is meat really bad for environment'   My question is why you changed the title ?
Okay but what if i grow my own meat?
Tbh if we cut meat we would probably live a bit longer but like is that living
Of course buying local is better co2-wise than international shipping! 😳 Huge mistake by you guys! You didn’t factor in transportation to and from harbours. So unless you have farms and supermarkets right next to the freightharbour that emission would greatly make it so buying local of course is better! I really think you should correct this!! By the way a big problem is lack of prober rail infrastructure forcing us to use trucks instead of trains. A freighttrain = approx 80 trucks….  Other than that. Great vid as always
What do I do?😫
800 bilion tons for 100 year is actually 8 bilion  ton per year so comparing it with year human based co2 emition is ridicules.
I am making my master thesis using life cycle Assessment on recycling electronics!!
I feel like the next video will be about how thanos was right
Woah woah no mention of cows and other cattle eating seaweed? It reduces their methane emissions by 99% !! This will have an enormous impact on sustainable farming.   How come this wasn't mentioned?
i want to believe that narrator pronounces meth as meeth and no one can stop me
Every single animal and plant we consume, is us killing another living system. We kill countless cells in our own body our whole life, when puberty hit, males sacrafice billions upon billions of living sperm to the sewer system. Where im guessin they swim till they die, lookin for an egg..lol. shit, lost my train of thought
As I know how much you love insects, a great idea for a video would be on how insects can turn non-biodegradable plastics into biodegradable subtances. This could also tie in with this video as you could use those insects to feed livestock. The UN has done quite a lot of research on it. Rather than deforesting land to grow crops for livestock, you can have skyscrapers as "verticle" farms which take in large quantities of plastic, feed them to insects, then feed the insects to the livestock.   It wouldn't stop the issues of methane produced from cows, but turning plastic waste into an edible food source for animals is a great way to reduce our carbon footprint, especially in animals like chickens which already produce less carbon than cattle.
On the whole your team condense the topic's into digestible facts for the common man quiet well. I would like you all to do a video on how the climate change model has been consistently wrong at predicting past and future change.  We clearly are missing some important factors in the current model since currently, main factors are human caused and irradiation from the sun.  Adjusting values of human emission to try to make the models fit isnt good science when logic dictates we are missing something....What about the varying strength in the magnetosphere? what about the solar phenomena that can affect the Earth, including sunspots, solar flares, coronal holes,
Why do people say 'plant based' when they just mean 'plant'?
Summary at 9:36
Realyyy nice video thank you so much ! Some stats are not really easy to understand sometimes, and the last comparaison was confusing, because it's between the impact of 3 billions hectares of forest in 100 years in comparaison of our total Co2 emission in only 1 year. I was like "this is the ultimate solution !" at first but then... it's not. 100 years of total Co2 emission lead us to 5000 billions tonnes Co2 Eq, IF we stabilize our Co2 emissions, which is not the case atm.  Comparaison between emission of dairy cows and meat cows surprise me at first, because i was thinking that production of dairy product was way more efficient... and that's true. After quick research i saw that we just produce about 13 times more milk than beef's meat, it could be nice to mention that too.  The part of transport and packaging in the food emission is really astonishing, and changed my way to look at this issues !  Could be nice to have a video on the role of the oceans on Co2 captation ! You guys are talking a lot about forest and trees, but phytoplankton and algae are really impactful too. Overall your videos on climate change are gold to me, please keep going !
Why vegans want to save the nature and plants by eating them?
Maybe I missunderstood the video but local food stays more efficent compared to imported since the driveways from the habour to the markets is way longer than the driveway from the local farmer to the local store. So the emissions are actually way higher by buying non local food, isn‘t it?
it is so funny people are still looking at curving climate change by stopping things... that will not happen, unless that change is at the end of a gun barrel.
Bro don't mislead If we all eat veg food even then it will not over because in non veg food  We use more veg and a little non veg  for taste Like in burger the patty is very small But the veg amount The 1 spoon sauce is more than of 4 Tomatoes What we used in a single burger The bun of it  Made from more tahan one bowl of wheat  And if we eat one bowl wheat's unprocessed flour's bread ( chapati ) It would enough for us for whole day And more benificial  You makes chicken But wait  You uses more than 3 kgs of veg in one kg chicken indirectly You are using spices Different Sauce Vegetables  Flour etc  So it's a myth that veg is not enough for humanity 🥺🥺🥺🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏  And you know why you taught such shit that veg is not enough  Because if you don't eat non veg food You would be connected to your deep own by your sub consious brain And then the rulers who guiding us  By destroying us with drugs alcohol And many other things to rule us easily can't able to do that 😖😖😖  I know it's hard to believe but it's true  They don't wanna that we reach our even one percent of potential 😠😠😠😠😠😠 So they are attacking us with Synthetic foods Drugs Controlling children's brain By televisions vedio games  Media is also in their control 😳😳😳😳 And they created a illusion around us  Have you noticed our today's education system is not for self development  It's to make a 9 to 5 slave for them 😠😠😠😠😠 They gives salary to us And snetch it by raising market price  Have you noticed this ever   We can only save ourself from this illusion by developing spiritually And it's first step is to avoid non veg And chanting Hari  naam 🥺🥺🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 Save humanity Save earth Hare krishna 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂 Please make contact to ISCON  Hare krishna 🙏🙏🙏🥺🥺🙂🙂🙂🙂
Are you sure about the 26% carbon emissions? Last time i checked (this summer) it was 14%, but maybe it was a different source?
The way i see it is theres 2 options we have as a species: 1 - everyone stops eating meat, we ban fossil fuels, we force the factories to use filters to stop them outputting harmful gases and we all join together to plant trees to remove the carbon we've already pumped into the atmosphere.  2 - we produce an abundance of energy from nuclear, wind, solar and even some of the more sci-fi methods such as dyson spheres and we use that energy to remove carbon and other gases from the atmosphere and we take full control of our world.  Option 1 will take a very long time to get everyone on the planet on the same page and its kinda boring, we may never stop people from outputting CO2 because it infringes on their freedoms. Option 2 is a bit more risky but we can enjoy life as we currently know it and it will give us the experience to colonize other worlds in the future, how can we expect to control another planets atmosphere if we cant even keep our own in check.
stop eating beef
Oh, there’s another bodily pleasure that can be enjoyed several times a day.
but when they feed the animals with crops isn't it mostly the waste bits of the plant that humans cant use like the stem, leaves ect
A problem with your video is that you don’t use statistics from only one place. Some countries are more efficient in cattle management and other are worse, for example example, you compared the land usage in USA with cattle food source globally. You should stick with either USA or the entire world.
the solution is put the humanity in big arcologies where we can reduce the cities in size, to the point where everything in the city can be done without cars and the rest of what was the city before turn in forest!
Cows also eat stuff that's left over from crop production that we humans can't eat! So much is left out in this video that it really comes of as vegan propaganda.
8:08 it broke my heart when this bird started crying because his burger dissappeared.
Isn't the graph at 9:32 misleading? You say that the 3 billion hectares could remove up to 800 billion tonnes _over a hundred years_, and then say we emit 50 billion a year, as if the forest will make a huge difference. But from how you've said it, and I may simply be misunderstanding, 800 billion over a hundred years is... 8 billion a year. Not that much, and certainly not enough to offset the 50 billion we emit.
Today I learned that the best solution is to ban beef production. I would not miss it.
Conclusion start a world war 3 to exterminate all humans in order to save the earth
"Feeding billions of people is impossible without causing emissions"  Free energy has entered the chat.
I like that you guys actually did not hide the fact that factory meat production is actually better than locally. I'm still against harsh conditions in factory meat production but it is actually pretty nice that you actually showed us the truth
remember when they said they were just going to stay unbias? i dunno if telling you how to think is unbias. seems manipulative
The problem is humans cannot live healthy lives without animal foods... So there needs to be a balance struck somewhere.
Basically there are just too many people for the earths resources and that's where the new world order comes in, or the controlled genocide of the masses by the elites through covert measures and gov't compulsion. IE; man-made viruses and mandatory inoculations being just one. Fight and call out totalitarianism like your life depends on it.
So, when the vegetables shipped overseas gets to the port, they don't need to use the same trucks to deliver those to warehouses? And then delivered again to stores? And how did they get to the first port? And how did they get from the fields to the first storage facility. And what if it's a vegetable that needs to be refrigerated constantly? I find this video very biased and misleading. The above misinformation was just one of the many I found.
So... how about fewer people?
The cow be like:zamn😍
Had a argument with something about the  this     she thinks everyone should be vegan   she got angry because i said she lacks balance look
I'm a little confused. It seems that by stopping vegan diets we can plant more forests and have a better effect on the planet.
So we just got to give up beef and eat chicken or pork instead, I could do that.
you can actually get a veggie burger that looks and tastes JUST LIKE MEAT. and if that still produces emissions just eat raw algae
3.Could that title be any longer?
I agree with everything that you say but I would suggest it isn't wise to taint the argument by using visual comparisons like that in the video of 9:35 (whilst you were clear verbally that you are comparing 100yrs to 1 year) it is still better to compare 1 year to 1 year even if it's not as visually striking
When your going to die before anything catastrophic even happens, you can eat what you want and not give a damn and be happy. Oh and dropkick the vegan hippie's yelling at you.
Pigs eat shit. Why don't we make them eat ours so we solve 2 problems with one stone?
Make a demon cow poster!
ive been buyin localy, doas it realy matter that little?
No. people are just being idiot.
i love meat but with that numbers i think it would be very easy for every1 to just eat simply less meat. Dont need to cut off just eat less.
Finally. Thank you these really make my day
The first line of this video is exactly the kind of positivity I need in my life.
So does this mean that the difference between stopping to eat beef and a completely vegan diet is 1 million hectares?
TV is obsolete with Kurzgesagt
I literally got a beef ad before this
I thought the thumbnail read “ is META real that bad “.  That would also make a great video though.
Do Americans eat lamb?
We always do the right thing, but only after exhausting all other possibilities.  I see bad times ahead.  No real effort will be made until it's well past too late.
It's actually really good, better than vegetables imo
0:00 - 0:08 ever heard of sex? 🙃
Lol what a bull - sht
thank you to the sacrifice of all of you vegetarians and vegans. I will still continue to eat meat ❤️❤️
I don't care I love meat
What about herds of wild grass eaters? Do they not fart too?
I just find it funny that we're extremely intelligent beings with flying vehicles  that capture other beings to eat them    Remind me of any alien movie ngl
whats also a driver for climate change is people
We need a beef tax right now!
Since I’ve been fortunate enough to hunt my own venison I have to admit I eat barely any beef now and haven’t looked back, better for the planet and better for my wallet too. Though I do appreciate that it’s a relatively unique situation, (at least where I’m from) and not everyone can do it of course. There is a gross overpopulation of deer where I’m from, to the point that it does have a negative impact on other local wildlife so it just makes sense for those of us that are able to.  Love the content, looking forward to reading the immune system book when it comes!
Can lab grown meet change this?
Nothing we do will affect climate change in the way we want, you are being lied to so as to avoid panic!
I am actually eating beef curry with rice while watching this video.
Meat is how we not died and lived to evolve,so if this video say meat is bad it's brainwashing. That's my message,i won't waste time argueing whit kids.
Please do an episode on “protests” legitimate ones and then the ones which are called “protests” but are riots!?!?
So I'm a vegetarian that's tried a complete vegan diet for months before I had to add some dairy to my diet. I constantly get ridiculed by my partner and siblings for my choices but even then I can see this video like so many so-called instructional videos is a political push towards veganism. Thumbs down!!
Individual carbon footprint is such corporate propaganda. It's sad to hear it from Kurzgesagt
Lab made meat is being developed, we might succeed and we might not.
Unpopular opinion: climate change won’t kill off even kill 1% of the world population.   Hot take: We just focus on it to give big government and oil companies more money in their pockets. Fear is power and power is leveraging fear to be in your favor.
you are under arrest in the suspicion of _beastiality_
An important aspect related to eating less or no meat that was not mentioned in the video is the moral side: animal sentience and animal rights. Rescued cattle behave as friendly and as smart as dogs. Industrial cattle farming is akin to torture, and by wasting meat or eating too much of it we have a share of blame on that.
But what about clothing? Seems jeans are worse than the beef industry?
Thank you.
i can already see that vegan teacher gonna make a vid on this
I'll probably watch this later but for now, what the hell is up with this thumbnail lol
Honestly, I have no intention of going vegan, but there's clearly an overproduction, and overconsumption(and if we are honest, a huge wastage, which isn't addressed here) of Red meat going on in most developed countries. Cutting back on red meat consumption helps immensely both for your personal health and well being, as well as the environment.
What about fish? Fish is meat. Imo its the best kind of meat and more people in the west should eat fish. Farming them emit wayy less gasses. Beef and pork arent really as healthy for you anyway. I barely eat beef and pork. Like a few times a year. People should opt for poultry and seafood instead.  And what about insects? Theyre a good source of protein.
📍°Yerrr。
ezz sulotion cannibalism
meh. that is nothing versus the problem with food waste and CO2 released by industries.  im not a fan of beef but this video did not take account the various products produced by cows
thank you so much for this!
Would we have enough useable land to grow vegan food, if we all started to eat vegan?
So, pork and chicken should be more incentivated than cow beef, obs. The calendar arrived this week, it is really amazing
Let's just admit that they 100% waited for YT to remove the dislike button before they posted this
beef stonks go down gme go up
If anyone tries to stop the general public from eating meat, he should be punnished hard. Glad this video doesn't try to do that, at least we can eat more pork or chicken or fish, I persoanlly don't feel that much difference.
The main problem is that there are too many people. We're closing in on 8B people, that's far too much! We should introduce 2 child polities world wide and go back to 6B and keep it that way. It would solve most environment problems we face today
I WANT TO SEE DISLIKES, DAMMIT! Eff youtube!
😘🥰
Thank you :)
How about making a video on how we could fix greenhouse gasses by removing humans? Now theres a solution.
9:30 I feel the comparison is misleading by comparison CO2 removed over 100 years with CO2 emitted per year. 800 billion tons removed over 100 years is roughly 8 billion tons per year.
gonna sent this to vegan teacher 😀
Still evading the fact that there are too many people? More people= more cattle, cars and so on. Btw most people are stupid
I don't hate vegans, I hate people who want to support legislation that makes it more difficult for me to eat what I want. It just so happens that all of the people like that are vegans, and they can't seem to understand that if you start making moves against the way people eat, it enrages them. Make all the excuses for the environment you want, you're never addressing the fact that people care more about living a halfway enjoyable life than making up for the pollution that China and India are mostly responsible for. Ya'll should just let people eat what they want, that way you can say "we told you so" in 100 years when the environment finally collapses.
Watching this while knowing I eat over half a kilo of meat per day :/ I need a large amount of protein for the sport I do and unfortunately there aren't any equally good substitutes for protein sources, without having to eat massive volumes. Some lab generated meat would be cool (with the same or higher amount of protein)..... How about a theoretical assessment of lab meats impact on the world @kurzgesagt?
As a vegan I appreciate this video! Make your own informed decisions :) The thing I hear most when I have food with non-vegan work colleagues is that... they don't trust what is in my vegan patty; If only they used that same energy in judging what is in their animal product...
Good stuff
Thank you for this nice video.  The only thing that bothers me is when you say that the transportation sector doesn't have much of a role in the CO2 emissions of food. Because even if that is true, the goal of eating local and seasonal goes beyond just producing less CO2.  Eating local ensures that our consumption does not have a negative impact on the other side of the planet.
Im curious about the carbon footprint of eating wild meet and hunting for yourself.
germany has no beef industry,  there is no conflict of interests here, move along, dont question "heckin science" crowd, believe in what your random youtube science communicator blurts out
For everyone wondering, this video has 5.6k dislikes lol.
So co2 means our fart?😂
And don’t forget about the 80 billion land animals killed every year… it’s horror
This video was disappointing / misleading for me as it wasn't about "meat" it was solely about beef.
It's all bad and all but damn u just cant deny that burger taste good
here's what I think of your climate change scare: <<<ordering a huge steak>>>
I'm not a vegan myself (I consume dairy, no meat) but to all the vegans out there, All you need to be aware of is your vitamin B12 and D levels and calcium. Everything else will be fine. Sadly, not all countries have food regulations to put these vitamins in cereals.
changee your YouTube profile picture to the dislike button we want the dislike option back nobody asked for this
Videos like this make me want to eat more meat.
You could have just released a 2 second video where a bird mouths "There is no ethical consumption under capitalism" and that would be it
The soyjak face on the soy milk carton got a chuckle from me.
Vegan propaganda. Begone.
What if we start eating vegans?
Bottom line - " Yes, it is even worse !"
I will never stop eating beef. I will never eat "vegan" food.
8:49 - "taur-foo"? 😂🤣😅
nd that's why burning methane is better
Yeah, the IDEA of veganism and the like sounds great… until you have a wide range of allergies to nearly all fruit, non-green vegetables, nuts and seeds. And then you’re very grateful to the animals for existing and up-cycling all the plant stuff so you can get your nutrients to actually live a healthy life. And this video ignored the fact that all your plant foods also have to be stacked onto trucks and hauled just like meat. But you’re hauling a larger volume with lower nutritional density, so you have to haul more volume and weight. Also, methane isn’t the problem. Earth has supported massive populations of ruminant animals without problem. The issue is the captured carbon we’re burning that hasn’t been part of the carbon cycle in millions of years.  Oh, and you completely ignored the fact that most of any cereal plant is literally inedible. We literally only eat the seeds and pass the rest on to livestock to consume… that’s a rather important fact that was excluded from this video.
DISLIKED
As someone from India we are always told not to eat beef. Its nice to know there is a scientific reason behind that.
Why would it be bad
There's lies, damned lies, and then there's statistics.
If they fed cows seaweed that would cut off 90% of the fats that build up in the atmosphere.
it is unfortunate that meat is really the biggest polluting thing in our diet...
Watching this while eating meat will make the food feel tastier. 👍
It mite look simple to create this video but it takes days
The same people who knock meat are driving around in electric cars with big non recyclable lithium cells that need deep strip mining to produce
The biggest issue it doesn't agress is how quality of said meat effects health, I care a lot less about environmental impacts than health risks. As this channel proved already, your enviromental footprint is a joke, for that to change you need to change corporations not individuals.
I guess we’ll have to stop breathing 😂
The statements made about how much of the world's grain is used for livestock feed is misleading. The numbers may very well be correct, but those percentages that are used for livestock feed are of too poor of quality or have deficiencies that prevent them from being human consumption quality. So those amounts wouldn't have made it to people's grocery stores regardless.
If all restaurants secretly switched real beef patties with veggie patties I don't think people would notice a difference.
If we emit 50 billion tonnes of CO2 per year, then in 100 years the total will be 5000 billion tonnes, so much more than 800 billion tonnes the trees can remove in 100 years
This video is predictive programming so you can get comfortable with giving up on meat. You will eat bugs and the rich will eat steaks.
Imagine if there would be a legislation that would force companies to stick a QR code to their products that once scanned will display the process it took for the meat to reach the store and how much CO2 or methane it would have used...a process that would give a score to each product. You could scan the different food products and compare.
Honestly, I could stop eating beef and switch to chicken for the rest of my life.
The next generation will start eating insects and grass or whatever ... My generation, our palate already knows what beef tastes like ... It's very hard to go back.
Another metric to be aware of is how much water was used to produce the stuff we consume. Being a smart consumer is tough!
I see some people are confused and/or angry that a supposedly neutral discussion only includes arguments against beef.  Please allow me to clarify: Any arguments in support of beef production on a global scale are too weak to matter - they are negligible for the broader beef production industry. Beef for all = bad. Period. 2:22 begins a neat summary of the CO2 released per kilo by the biggest emitters - all of which are meat products, with the production of beef being the biggest contributor by a very large margin. This is the data which the clip is primarily responding to, to gain clarity on whether the widespread demonisation of beef is justified.   I would argue that they did not take a strong enough stance on the matter. Our love of cow meat and everything that comes with it is a massive reason for our climate disaster, and buying less of it around the world is one crucial step we need to take to rebalance our collective carbon cycle.
Think about how massive the natural herds of the various animals, buffalo, reindeer, zebras, wildebeest, kangaroos…….literally hundreds of others, were before man started killing them off.  I doubt very much if the food herds we have now even come close to matching those numbers.  The best fix is to start killing off the humans.   THERE ARE TOO MANY OF US!
But meat is so tasty
So basically there is way to many people on the planet to sustain itself
Kurzgesagt, please make a video on permaculture and farming methods that could actually promote carbon sequestration, increase biodiversity and resilience, and restore soils. I know these methods are more expensive, require more technical skills, and have lower yields than conventional farming methods but are they worth the extra cost and worth or are resources best allocated somewhere else?
Regarding the stats from 9:20 to 9:35 - The 800 billion tonnes of CO2 removed is over a period of 100 years, so that's 8 billion tonnes removed per year on average. And we emit 50 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. So even if we switch to vegan diets, we're adding much more CO2 (42 billion tonnes per year) to the environment than we're removing, right?
I have eaten less than 100grams of beef in my whole life
Now the vegan teacher is gonna cancel Kurzgesagt
✌✌
Meethane? Is that what you get when a peedophile causes too much friction.
But how much of those emissions are part of the natural cycle of emissions? If the cows don't eat the grass that grass will still decompose and emit through that process.
It was necessary to mention an aspect that I consider important. The equivalent CO2 emission by cows comes from emissions absorbed by plants before being ingested by animals. It is unfair to compare emissions from other sectors that emit CO2 that was stored underground for millions of years, with the emissions of CO2 captured by plants the year before.
"Let's say this represents one cow, which will keep me in food for, let's say, a month. Now that cow needs this much land and food. Well, you can imagine, that cow needs x by x amount of land, and you can grow trees in it. Around that cow, you can have goannas, kangaroos, wallabies. You can have every other single Australian animal in and around that cow. If I was a vegetarian, to feed me for that month, I need this much land, and nothing else can grow there. Herein lies our problem. If we level that much land to grow rice and whatever, then no other animal could live there except for some insect pest species. Which is very unfortunate."  Steve Irwin to The Scientific American
Welp. I was already phasing out beef from my life. Good buy ground beef, you’ll be fondly remembered.
0:58 feel bad for earth🥺
Eat responsibly...
0:03 well....I can name one thing.. if u know what I mean ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive"  People who don't eat much "Oh.. Okay then :( "
Life thrive for billions of years but then humans ruined everything. When the next mass extinction happens, humans will be wiped out. life will continue to thrive like after the past 5 extinctions. We only try to prevent it just to feel better about ourselves. god i hate humans
Es muss eine neue Kuh-Abgassteuer her!    jkjk
The sad truth is that despite awareness, money talks louder because the poor needs to survive and the rich wants to get richer. So the poor resort to cheap meat which produces the most carbon foot print and the rich resort to approaches which produce higher carbon foot print to lower the cost and increase profit.
I think its unrealistic to get most people to stop eating meat. Frankly, life is hard enough for most people. Expecting them to feel bad because they want enjoy a good meal, is pushing shit on to people that already carry most of the worlds shit. This really comes down to the Mega Corps and rich fucks who have the money and power to solve these problems.
This guy taking extra payment for this video i know it but i cant prove it...
Okay, grassfeeding is not an option in the US. But what about Europe? We eat less beef already.  Also, most of wasted food is vegetables and fruits, not meat. That is also a very big factor.
I feel like some of the points in this video are being misrepresented or contradictory.  1. Talking about how cattle are used on land that is unsuitable for growing food crops, then going on to state that converting it all into forests would sequester a huge amount of carbon from the atmosphere, seemingly forgetting that the vast majority of that land would also be unsuitable for forests.  2. Talking about how cattle are able to turn inedible crop byproducts into a nutritionally dense and easily digestible food, then going to claim that huge amounts of food crops are fed to livestock that "could be fed to humans", but forget that the majority of that is the same inedible material that cattle are so good at converting into edible food. Yes granted pigs and poultry do eat a lot of human edible food, but this video is focused on cattle. 3. Carbon emissions, they present the carbon emitted by cattle to be equivalent to the carbon emitted by burning fossil fuels, which is redicilous. The methane emitted by cattle is just part of the carbon cycle, the net carbon in the ecosphere isn't changing. Yes methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than co2, but because of its comparitvely short half life and much lower prevalence in the atmosphere the actual impact on climate change is greatly overstated. The emissions from the fossil fuel industry is greatly more damaging as it is introducing new carbon into the system that wasn't there before, not just recycling it. Not to mention that the cattle are also sequestering carbon themselves in terms of the carbon that their bodies are made from. Yes the destruction of rainforests for the sake of cattle farming is terrible, but saying that livestock living in rocky terrain where no large trees are able to grow are just as bad is incredibly misleading.
Wathing this while having mutton curry.
Not at all
Next tíme can you include how much land we would need if we produce less food waste since it is around 40% in some countries also how curing obesity would help because many obese people ingest 2- 4 times more calories than they need.
After responding to a few comments here, I just want to say, climate science, agricultural science, and ecological science are all made up of individuals wanting to do their best with the data they have available, but interconnecting them all is not often a concern.  I've worked in all three areas, and while everyone I've worked with is doing their utmost to make their studies purely scientific and their data accurate, they generally are just working to get more funding, and those that submit their data (very good data, I should say) to, are generally just looking for funding more than change.  Science is unfortunately very intertwined with politics, and a perfectly well researched study on issues that impact us everyday may not see any action if it seems inconvenient or harmful to  leaders more concerned with short-term goals. We've seen it with past leaders, we see it with current leaders.  If you have strong feelings about any politically-charged topics, I encourage you to go straight to well-reviewed (meaning scientifically peer-reviewed) sources and see the data yourselves.  Though Kurzgesagt, as far as my area of knowledge, has never gone far astray or misleading in presenting good science in a fashion anyone can understand.  But I REPEAT: go to the peer-reviewed journals and articles yourself, don't accept shitty youtube personality's or news station's summaries. Review the data, and summary, and the methods, and make sure the journal you read is both peer-reviewed and a trusted journal by a variety of established scientists.
I like how he talks only about beef to claim meat is bad while he also said pork produces 10times less and ignoring the fact that vegtables also need bad products to keep buggs away
Meant needs to cost like 10 times more than it curnatly does
I'm actually glad to see a productive and factual video on eat meating that isn't forced down your throat. I've already decided to become a vegetarian in the new year, we waste so much meat and I never realised how much emissions we actually use to eat beef and such meats!
Just say" its second law of thermodynamics."
Indians ( especially Hindus don't eat meat )
Hi kurzgesagt, old time fan here. Can you make a video to drive people's opinion over sending actual money to Brazil to keep the amazon rain forest away from the meat industry?  Brazilians don't want to be poor as much as europeans don't want to turn their heaters off.
my mother allways told me that meat is healthy if you dont overdoo it .. maybe the best thing would be to just eat less beef
cant wait for a realistic plant-meat
Waste management of cattle farming is also a big concern for the neighbouring areas. The waste is also released into the nearby water bodies. The animals are sometimes made to live in their own waste as well.
I think I'm turning vegan!
Hey, so by being poor and buying mostly chicken and pork, and even that quite rarely, I'm actually helping the enviroment. Nice.
watching this while eating food.
please go back to making cool space videos
The main point of buying local is to reduce food waste. Most of bulk produced fresh products travel to multiple locations if not sold, and eventually can end up back where they started or wasted. You can’t say buying local is worse for the environment without considering this.
Double counting the fossil fuel emissions from transport there. Please remember the basics of the carbon cycle. If you release carbon that was removed from the air decades ago there is little affect, if you release carbon that was removed hundreds of millions of years ago, that causes a major change. And you didn't address the presence of wild ruminants and methane. To take North America as an example, there are only about 10% more ruminants now as compared to 500 years ago. I'm sorry but this video absolutely strawmanned the position that meat is not inherently bad for the environment. Even suggesting that factory farming has a lower footprint than an arrangement more similar to hunting wild ruminants should be ringing alarm bells of logical fallacy.
Just stop eating meat... It's pretty clear at this point. Being vegan was never as easy as it is now.
I think the local vs foreign comparison is off... how can a foreign avocado be "cheaper" on CO2 when: - Foreign: delivery from production to cargo ship -> cargo ship trip -> docks to warehouse -> warehouse to supermarket - Local: delivery from production to warehouse -> warehouse to supermarket
i change my plate based of prices.
Go vegan
Do the research job for many. These are comrads. Want to reciprocate to other in other subject.
I really don't like all this leftist/Chinese propaganda. Asia is the biggest contributor to so called global warming emissions. Why should we make any sacrifices?? That said, I believe in freedom - if you believe in gLObaL WArmINg, feel free to be a vegan and live in a cave... you know, to decrease your impact. Meanwhile, I'll keep eating meat. To be honest, I've actually been trying to increase my meat intake, to offset my vegan colleague.
In a nutshell: Enjoy your steak before it's too late.
Now please do a video about shipping. You really under estimated the impact carbon emissions for shipping. Yes it is relatively better, because you transport more per weight per produce carbon. But the total amount is bigger than every other transport means.
Beef stonks
Meat is not meant for human consumption. . . If a person has paid some attention to their body, they will surely agree to this. The simple fact that meat takes more than 12 hours to pass out of our body, should be a proof in itself.
I feel like this video asks the best questions but also has misinformation. How can you say with a straight face, to millions of people, at 4:25:   "[on freight ships] Shipping one kg of avocados from South America to Europe...will generate around 2.5 kg of carbon emissions, while one kg of beef from your local butcher will come in at 18 kg of CO2"  You said it yourself, freight ships are efficient as in, they can transport 100k-500k tonnes of goods. But those are a lot of goddamn avocados. And did you also calculate the transport from the avocado farm (via trucks i assume) to the South-American harbor, and then from the European Harbor to the other countries?(which is also via truck) And for the people who choose to buy locally: 99% it isn't because people want to save the world. It's because they (probably) know what the local farmers are feeding the animals they eat later. I bet they prefer the idea of supporting local businesses than a international conglomerate.   Also 9:09 : "a vegan free diet would free up around 3 billion hectares of land"  Ok? And for example, do you know why the Brazilian government is cutting down its beautiful jungles? To have more space for coffee beans, and soy.  Do you know why there's massive deforestation in Romania? Because there's demand for wood in other, more modern countries. The same countries who are so concerned with global warming, yet they're the ones who try to change our diet. If only they could remove greed from their diet.  2:55 - "A kilogram of beef will keep you alive much longer than a kilogram of potatoes. If we compare emissions per calorie per protein? Not much." Oh reallllly? We're still comparing calories and proteins? How about: vitamins? Fibers? How much % of that protein is actually being used for our body? It's been well documented that meat protein is absorbed much better than soy/whey/tofu, and especially potatoes... Not only that, but meat contains good amounts of fat as well, it being necessary for our body to function properly.  You showed beautiful animations, and amazing questions, with well documented information. But i'm disappointed, mostly because you have a lot of (young) viewers who won't dig deeper, who will consider your video(s) to be the holy grail of information and throw it at anyone who has a different opinion than them and call it a day.  Keep up the good work, and next time, try to deliver a more realistic solution to the common person, because eating a vegan burger instead of a beef one is as significant as liking an instagram post to save Africa from its hunger problem.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old." Yeah, I can think of a few others...
The dairy cows might release less co2 but this doesn't mean it's an climate act to use dairy products. It takes 600-1000 liters of water to produce a litre of milk. And all the cruelty that is involved to dairy industry, it's just not worth it.
How about stop lecturing the little man and start NAMING China, India, coastal African countries and the US for being the biggest polluters of the planet and the largest contributors to man made climate change.
In USA the average yearly consumption of meat is 114kg per person. In Italy is 77kg. And they think they could teach us something?
I don't eat meat but i don't understood your point
Love the channel. Regarding meat production the following is a really, really important new development. Please examine the Savoury Institute and their revolutionary method for cattle/sheep grazing on marginal drylands. Basics are.. Degraded land is regenerated, production is increased dramatically and (recent studies show) more carbon equivalent is sequestered than is produced. Savoury has found the only 'magic bullet' (ie. it makes everybody happy) that I've seen in 40years of environmental study and practice. You'll see there's plenty of science and real-world proofs. They have many properties practising their methods as well as Savoury 'hubs' on all continents. You folks do a great job and it's important you continue to get the best information out there... I'm a long time 'green' but given this new understanding the green movement is wrong on this critical issue and urgently needs to absorb the new information. In this case, if we change our management regimes, we can have our beef and eat it too...
Proud vegetarian 💪🏻🌱
You're not taking into account that grass fed cows actually sequest carbon in the soil making it very fertile and home to growth and survival of other species. Yet when plants have been cropped the soil gets ruined and needs chemicals to be able to be fertile again. I feel like if you're going to make videos like this you need to provide all your sources that are not government backed.
please put Vietnamese subtitles on your video, it's very helpful but I don't fully understand what you're saying
Only the vegan teacher will dislike this video
പൊറോട്ട and ബീഫ് ❤️❤️❤️
when will we accept the fact that there's not too many meat eaters in this planet... there are just too many people..
go vegan
Meat is excellent.
Did Kurtzgesagt disable dislikes?
The best option for eating food with carbon less, limiting meat 🥩 product to only once a week. And rest of 6 days eating vegetables, cereals products .
Poor and meat producer countries like mine: 🤔 Eating meat every day here would be the equivalent of not having a salary
Fish is better
Since 2% of methane actually stays in the atmosphere but is 28 times effective. 48% of methane gas should be counted if this is done its great. Then beef gets 4,5kg and if we add unusable grassland of 65% it comes down to 3kg lower than the alternative. Lying with statistics is easy and disregarding information because it's controversial seems disingenuous.   Using life cycle analysis on animals but not on transportation not on methane but then using it on food since it helps with painting a picture.   How about human farts should we include that in our calculations no more beans because they release 40% extra farts
Still not eating bugs.
I'm poor from a 3rd world country. I don't have the luxury to choose what to eat. I just eat whatever is available.
The sad truth is that meat has lost its perceived value. Meat used to be something special, and now you can buy a burger at McDonalds for 1$, or a hole chicken for 6$, a kg of pork cost 8,50$ around my area. I do think meat and fish are important aspacts of a balanced diet but it has to be in moderation, like once a week or so.  I am also a stong beliver that we should tax foods based on there environmental impact, meaning higher CO2 emitions should be taxed higher.
I want to eat a big steak now.
Vegan teacher be watching this lol
Don't forget to eat. And remember, you cannot stop climate change.
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old" 🤔🤔 debatable
Thank you for objectively bringing to light uncomfortable truths in service of the planet. You guys seriously never disappoint.
Finally the video is published in english… been waiting for this, particularly because the topic is so important to all of us and reaching a lot of people with those kind of videos is always good :) thank you for your incredible work!
When is the video on lab grown meat coming out? Is there enough information to make one?
So its not that complicated, its just bad. What about the actual amount of land and resources needed to feed people with vegan crops instead of beef and diary? Surprised that was not discussed.
EVERYTHING CAN be converted to crop :) Check out the greening the desert project. China turned mountain range the size of Netherlands  to crop land,  by manual labor in just 20 years.
Short answer: yes
What would happen if humanity don't eat any kind of meat for a day?
Inb4 the elitist scumbags start charging us taxes based on what we eat.
I cannot believe this video didn't even mention lab-grown beef, which is essentially emission-free.  That being said, this is one of the easiest to fix issues. It's just a matter of sacrificing wants for needs. We don't need beef anymore.
I wonder what kind of environmental impact meat cloning will have? Aside from the obvious ethical plus of not having to kill an animal for food but still getting meats, if the process (whatever it winds up being) has a lower emissions footprint it could be huge for us.
what if i tell you there will climate change and it have nothing to do with what we eat ? Since waste heat is a thing it is estimated that if we get to kardashev scale 1 we would need many power production facilities in space because of waste heat it produces
I've basically eliminated red meat from my diet. Between straight up cutting it out and replacing it with plant based meat, it really wasn't that hard. I still eat chicken and fish, but that's basically it.
I always hate when noone mentions that while a great or even the majority of the farmed crops go to farm feeds this doesn´t mean much. It´s not like out of 100 farmlands 60 are dedicated to feeding animals. Especially when it comes to grains such as soy and corn, the byproducts are a lot. The majority of the crop consists of the stem the leaves and other parts of the plant that are given to create pellets and animal feed. Not to mention that a lot of the grains that were destined for human consumption are still given away to make animal feed as byproducts that would be thrown away anyway due to quality control, product chain issues or even low demand in a certain area. We just have less grain garbage in contrast to the amount of fruits that are thrown away into big piles each year; I am sure everyone has heard about the exorbitant amounts of fruit wasted each year. There is just less of that when it comes to grains, because what's garbage for us is a good meal for cattle, pigs and chickens.
guess eating meat will take a turn the moment it endangers our lives like let's say not vaccinating during a pandemic?
Even if we eliminate all other emissions, we'd still use up our entire carbon budget by the 22nd century. Not an precise quote, But I'd like to ask one question. Does carbon and other greenhouse gasses not leave the atmosphere in a century? Even if we keep adding a small amount to it, will it not dissipate faster then we put it in? Even at 1/4 the rate of what we are doing now? I'd like to ask for some statistical data about this, as well as other studies on the rate carbon dissipates.
I don't care about all this. I am here for only 70 years. I am going to enjoy everything this Earth has to offer.
Who cares about emissions, give me some medium rare steak.
Never really liked Beef anyway
Three meat vids
Amazing animation!
One of the obvious untruths which Veggies indulge in, is when they do their "Why meat is bad" calculation as if all meat is grown the way Americans do it. The vast majority of beef and mutton in the world is grown on natural pasture, not profit-greedy American "feed-lots". And the vast majority of natural beef pastureland is unproductive scrub and arid land that is TOTALLY unsuitable for commercial human vegetable crop use.
In the end we got to the point, that the problem is not meat, or consuming, but the amount of people on the planet.  Sentenses like "We can feed 10 billion people on the planet" has some inner lies. What quality of food can we produce using this methods? Do we have tha same amount of vitamins and micro nutritiens in it to make all the people healthy? Or this is just quantity over quality with ultra processed garbage food?  It seems that we cannot feed even 7 billion correctly.
why the heck didn't you include vertical farming and lab meat?!
Holistic farming methods are not only carbon neutral, but also carbon negative. In Australia and New Zealand, the beef industries have set carbon neutral targets by 2050, and many farms are already there. I live in Australia and there are already carbon-neutral beef options on the shelves.  This feels like a massive oversight for In a Nutshell. Ruminant animals, if farmed correctly, can actually REMOVE carbon from the atmosphere. There are an opportunity to STOP CLIMATE CHANGE, not worsen it.
I think this video highlights something that has been sadly lost nowadays. Veganism has been pushed so heavily that it is seen as the 'only' reasonable choice. Tell a group of people that you're going vegetarian and you're likely to have at least one ask 'why not vegan? Dairy is still terrible!'. Everything we hear seems to be pushing veganism and anything short of that is seen as a failure. Sure, it definitely is the best choice if you're okay with it. But we know that actually, just switching from beef to chicken or cutting down your meat consumption to a few days a week gives most of that benefit with relatively little sacrifice. I really don't understand why the 'low hanging fruit' approach isn't being pushed more.
Carbon footprint is just another scam produced by oil corporations to scapegoat our animal food supplies. They're best friends with food industry (aka plant based)
Dislike
I love meat
How much youve been paid by big oil to push the cow narrative? Really love your work btw. Pop science that keeps us disinformed about the big picture, cuz you know, fck being informed about whats really going on since its CoMpLiCaTeD.
Show this video to all those dumbheads who troll vegans
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old"  Speak for yourself mate 😅
Switching to plant protein changed my life. I'm horribly sick of hemp protein shakes, but I tell myself that they are magic eternal youth potions, which is basically the truth. I look decades younger than I am. Hemp is harvested twice per season, requires no fertilizer or pesticides, and replenishes topsoil.
I grew up on a farm. My family raises cattle and we sell them when they're about 9 months old. Until then they are never seperated from their mom. They eat grass and hay as 95% of their diet (rest being corn). In summer they live in the alps where crop farming is literally not an option worth considering. In short, they live the most animal friendly way possible. However, that is an outlier of beef production on a global scale. That's also ofc reflected in the price. I hope in the future we will eat meat less often, pay attention to animal well-being more as well as environment friendlier production, and therefore have more expensive, but higher quality meat - and hopefully lab grown meat as a cheap alternative, as well as ofc the already existing protein-rich plant food.  Imo meat is a food we should treat with more respect for the resources it took and the animal that lived and gave its life for it.
No, it's not.
I need to see how many dislikes this has.
I have a controversial idea for drastically lowering pollution.  The problem at its core lies with us Humans. What if we collectively started opting for reducing the number of kids we have? Instead of making children of our own. WE should opt for adopting children who need it.  because the biggest source of pollution is simply the fact that there are more and more humans on our planet. if we can stem the population, in a humanitarian way, i.e nothing forced, but rather a change of mindset. That is, instead of having our own children. We should have a mindset that encourages adopting children from developing countries, who really do need and deserve a better life and a future.  We know Developing countries will usually always have a bigger population boom than Industrial countries. Industrial countries have most of their needs covered, and quite many families and people live fine a low number of offspring. However, in developing countries, they tend to have much more children, both for their own future security for their parents, but also due to limited access to contraceptives, knowledge, and most importantly, a functional law and order system. (rape can be a big problem and is often unreported in developing countries) hence why every day, children are born into poor conditions and families unable to support them. They grow up in the slums, and they couldn't care less about the environment as they are more busy finding means for their own survival than the survival of the human species in the future.  So that's where the idea comes from. instead of having kids of your own if you are one of those growing up in an industrial modern stable country. How about adopting kids from developing countries? That way they grow up in a much safer, more stable environment, and they can get proper education and their carbon footprint will be much smaller. You also reduce the pressure of ever-growing poverty in Developing countries, allowing them to shift into an industrial country much easier when it is not down ridden by corruption and crime that stems from a large population of poverty.  It's a Win-Win situation really. The people living in wealthy countries still can have their families. But at the same time, it alleviates and reduced the poverty growth from poorer countries, giving them space to grow and turn into industrial countries faster which in turn gives them more wealth that can be used to shift over to more sustainable environmentally friendly industry.
Kurzgesagt, could you do a video about aquaponics? It's basically making a mini-ecosystem basically anywhere, where you can grow plants extremely fast, raise fish on maggots from food waste, and the best yet, deal with that whole, "2 plus continents of space are used to grow food" problem. If you see this PLEASE consider maybe hopefully doing a video?
No one ever discusses the fact that we need meat. I feel so much better when i eat meat than if i dont.
@8:32  pigs eat only exclusively feed crops?  you have obviously never been to a single pig farm ever.
Do the right thing.... Go VEGAN💚
Thank you for making this video. I look forward to sending this video to people making wildly dumb claims about veganism xx
LOL. This video says that the mistreatment of animals and the enjoyment of consumerism (specifically cheap, highly available meat) is better than humane ways of making it. Hmmmmmmmm
Kurzgesagt is better at teaching me stuff than my teachers at my school, aha! So simple yet so informative
The best kurzgesagt series (food). Would love more videos on how our diets and population distribution affect climate change.
Living in a developing country, I only eat beef a few times a year, probably not up to 2kg of beef per year, but I often eat 2-5 pieces of chicken a week sadly,..
What abourlt the 10℅ rule at the trophic pyramid? Energy efficient?
So solutions is to kill all animals? Seriously all these vegetarian communists have no clue about this. Same that they aren't bright enough to see consequences of their non-sense.
I think the title has been changed🧐
Think you are still looking at each point in a microcosm which gives faulty data. E.G you say transporting Plants round the world uses less carbon than the butcher driving round locally. But what about all the people who have to drive to the dock to unload then others to the packaging facility? Still comparing apples to oranges.
i liked this channel more when it wasnt just climate propaganda
I've yet to hear an argument to why eating meat is worth the massive costs
Kapitalism is killing the planet
Ngl, watched this while eating KFC. Feeling prettyyy guilty right now 😂
Ok but so what makes the 9kg CO2 beef so much less polluting than the 105kg CO2 one? I think you guys missed the explanation there. Transport doesn't change much, alright, but then why the huge difference? Can we buy the "best beef" to lower our emissions? Hell yes, you just said it, tenfold less emissions. What makes this beef the "best beef" though, if it isn't transportation? I think you got a bit lost there.
Vegetables are nice side-dishes for the main course: meat and fat. I need all three food groups and no amount of convincing is going to stop me from eating meats and fats with my vegetables.
If you think about what we as a species are doing: We raise animals to eat them. To quantify this on a yearly estimate, we raise and slaughter around 265 million chickens in the Netherlands for around 17.7 million inhabitants p/a. Just think about it. The point is not that one eats meat, but that we all do, and no longer strictly for our survival.
question: which one emits more gas emissions, vegan meat or normal meat?
A nice filet mignon or worldwide devastation. Tough decision really
Poor people in the west used to have horrible deficiencies which was mostly eradicated by cheap food. Now they want us to eat avocados and top of the range butcher's beef which we can't afford. Great.
Had to stop the video because the music was hurting my head.
anyway there are tasty
This is such a huge huge topic Pollution is really only the tip of the iceberg, but some people don't care whatsoever about animals being sentient and sometimes people are just more concerned about their own health/global warming  Anyway, guys and girls and everyone else eat what you want, just know the consequences of this industry
Humans don't deserve to rule this world
all you people that really want to save the earth, just stop eating
Thx, that help.
That fabulous cow on the left 06:00
there used to be 60 million bison in America when europeons 1st came to north america and in europe they had as many bison too I really dont think the cattle is the problem
But they're not shipping only one avacado, it's more like 2 million of them 🤣
0:11 thanks for saying cooking is for both genders kurzgesagt ❤️
And what about chicken and fish?
Maybe you did a video on this already but related to carbon emissions, can you also do a video on reforesting deserts such as the Sahara desert.  Including reality from fiction. As in, would doing so actually help and what would be the potential global climate impact (such as wind direction and temperature).  Also, are there any political implications in trying to reforest deserts?
How about lamb?
9:20 , wait a minute. "If we spared 3 billion hectares of land, it could remove 800 billion tonnes of CO2 over 100 years." So, it could, on average, remove 8 billion tonnes of CO2 a year, right? Yet, we emit about 50 billion tonnes of CO2 per year, apparently. So about 5000 billion tonnes of CO2 over 100 years, assuming our emissions don't change. How is that good news? What's the point behind this specific passage? Can someone explain?
i dont like food
I will never give up my meat.
To summarize: Yes, but we're just not going to do anything about it.  Whatever you decide, enjoy the great filter event!
Kurzgesagt: "Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old." Me: (looks at browsing history and my hand).. *chuckles*
Meat only for the richest, the rest can eat sh.t, who cares?
nqicnweivnwencvi i just want more likes to my comment
LETS GOOOO VEGAAAN
Not a single mention of what happens inside of slaughterhouses? It constantly blows my mind that people hide away from speaking about slaughterhouses when comparing plant-based and animal-based diets.
I guess that avocados are transported magically to and from the ships 😅
The important thing is to bring about legislative change that protects our climate and our land. Putting the onus onto individuals to make consumer choices is ineffective and unfair to those without the means to.
I never understood why the animal welfare argument is an afterthought in the scientific community. Everyone that is scientifically minded can agree that unnecessary suffering is bad in a psychological and evolutionary standpoint as well as an emotional one
I don't deny its worse to have beef, but there are other things to consider like seasonal foods storeing vegetables so they don't go rotten. For example in Alaska what do you think they can farm? We would have big green houses where they would need to be heated watered then we would need electric fencing to keep big green houses safe.   What I think would happen is that the diffrance wouldn't be as big as first thought, since crops have different yealds, and there are diseases. Which means we can't condense the farm otherwise the world would starve in case of a outbreak. We would need to spend the rest of the energy on protecting fragile crops, just look at the banana now. They are struggling to keep them alive, and other species of banana are near extinction since they are not as profitable.   This is a big topic, you covered it well but I think there are many equations that we don't know and many that are not taken in to account.   One of them being that deforestation is also happening because of fruits. Hope to see more <3
I would actually argue with the statement in the video which suggests that feeding a world population without any emission is impossible.Since in fact for instance instead of regular rice we could produce and consume GMO rice in order to use less water and absolutely no pesticides,fertilizers as u may know GMO does not cause any harm to either environment or human health instead it helps both .Second to cut areas needed for crop it is possible now to farm them vertically it is called vertical farming,so it is an existing technology or method whatever.I am surprised How u guys of KURZGESAGT did not know this.
Best Kurzgesagt video to date, well done guys.
It's hard, but possible. The world will definitely be much better if we eat only vegetables but for the current situation, complete change is impossible.
For God sake, someone better build time machine and tell prehistoric man that hunting is bad!
it's funny how food shortage and food waste coexist in this world
Are you sure that 1 kg beef transportation causes 18 kg CO2 emission? Intuitively I would guess it is 18 grams and not kilograms.
yes everything humans enjoy is bad we need to go back to living like monks on a mountain top, this is what leftists want
It's not about diet. It's about the capitalist way of production and 40% food waste also mentioned in the comments. Most of the people in the third world don't eat meat anyway, because they don't have any money.
Currently enjoying a nice piece of steak
A world where we can't eat meat and a world that has been destroyed by climate change is the same thing to me.
Seems to me that the primary issue with meat and carbon footprints are land use. Chickens have a very small footprint on land use, and it is therefore less carbon intensive.     Something not covered in this video, is how much crops that goes into animal feed that would not have been used for human consumption regardless due to falling short on quality requirements. A fair amount of those crops would end up as methane producing garbage instead of being utilized efficiently. I'm all for transitioning to lower carbon intensive food production, but meat isn't going away anytime soon. Nor do I wish it to.  We could however make large advances in crop development for lessening land area use so that we can plant those forests we need to re-capture most of that carbon regardless. Genetic engineering has just barely been touched upon in this regard.
Kurgesagt be like: "Beef meat emits various pollution."  *Me now: Eating burgers
Sorry i wont stop eating beef
I don't get why schools aren't tackling other factors such as this and that climate change is an incredibly complicated problem to fix.
vegans: ban all non veg save the animals save the environment eat fricking leaves kurzgesagt who actually did the research and made a video which shows everything instead of saying meat is bad: you are a joke
Our biggest CO2 impact is humans. Not cows.
If we continue this way of ruining our only planet , Earth's fate would be same as Venus
The unfortunate thing is that these discussions always seem to lead to a same general issue: The human population is far to large to supply right now. I in no way want a Thanos situation, that’s not the answer. But if only it were easy to reduce birth rates while keeping everyone happy… Population controls would be difficult, but our society just can’t handle more people right now in my opinion. Hence why I plan not to have children.
Could you also touch upon the fact that many of the methane Emissions from cows are simply just recycled carbon? I see an issue with deforestation, transportation, fertilization,.. But I feel like this Argument is often left out. The food the cows eat (as well as the cows themselves) are just plants which are just materialized carbon etc. After a couple of decades when methane becomes carbon again it should basically be a 0 sum net effect, no?
Swapping meat for plant based,  would then just require the land that was for cattle to be used for growing the extra plants needed. The quality of crop grown for animals is far less than for human consumption. Plus why is it that the 'cost' of transporting meat locally is factored and considered to high  but don't plant based food also require this local transport too?
I completely get the point. But I think it's important to point out counties like Australia and New Zealand. Where all beef is grass fed and these cows are (especially in Australia) utulising land in areas where other agriculture just doesn't work.   Like I could make a completely different video on Aus and NZ.   But people decide to make decisions base on these generalisations which sucks because the farmers and cows are targetes
Okay, back to drugs then...
On a moral level, eating meat is bad. You cannot proclaim your love for the animal kingdom whilst simultaneously killing and eating said animals.  On an environmental level, eating meat is bad. From the amount of land required, to the amount of water and food they require.  In this day and age, we now have more choice and options. A Beyond Meat burger has more protein than your average meat patty (20/25g of protein vs 15g of protein), so the  argument "Legumes and seeds don't give me enough of what I need" is null and void.  Its also much healthier to avoid/drop your meat consumption. So next time you're at the shop, maybe try a meat free option and see how you get on.  You don't have to change your entire life in one go - But small incremental steps might put you on the path to eventually not wanting to eat meat.  Being a vegetarian for many years (think its 15 now), the smell of meat is really off putting to me these days. Its a bit like an ex-smoker smelling someone who's just smoked, or an ex-drinker smelling booze on someone's breath - Its just not enjoyable.
Dont eat meat (except fish)everyday. Once in 2 weeks of chicken or other red meat be fine.
The thing is some people need meat for health reasons, so meat will always have to be readily available
Thank you for this video, outstanding quality. Is there a specific reason you did not touch the subject of farmed fish? I feel like farmed salmon and the likes have a very good ratio of  food to meat conversion.
sounds like I should start eating exclusively factory farmed meat. Thanks Kurzgesagt for saving me money,
just try to eat less meat. you dont have to cut it all out immediately.
no. we arent going vegan. stop.
That is why Hindu were always against beef eating. Not only it is harmful for the environment, but also it is immoral to kill a cow.
i don't give a damn about emissions
please provide indonesian subtitle
Vegans have smaller brains!!! Eat meat or take vitamins!
The nuclear energy is the only solution
So the soy production is responsible for the Amazonian Forest fires and not the country politicians? Color me surprised. Nice way of exposing the Soy lobby too.
Going vegan is not the answer, but we can surely treat meat as a novelty item that we can cherish on a weekly basis.
watching this video made me hungry.
Beef Stonks 😂😢
Curse you YouTube how could you not recommend the latest Kurzgesagt video!
Fuck world, I'm not giving up my kebabs.
not vegan dont care about food tho so I might give it a go
I am going to eat steak and you can't stop me
2:48 "A kilogram of beef would keep you alive much more than a kilogram of potatoes." Im surprised vegans are still alive
I dont even eat beef. Its too expensive where I live.  And NEVER ate anything vegan thay would be actually tasty. Its like they season the vegan food like normal and...it just doesnt work.  Also if not chicken/pork meat i'd be dead by now thanks to malnutrition, as due to my health issue, pure vegan diet is damaging my intestines.
What I find most frustrating is that vegetarian and vegan food is often more expensive in supermarkets, making them inaccessible for many. I would also love to buy local but being disabled means I can only get to the supermarket and only have the options available (plus the labels can be confusing or unclear). However I am trying to fight food waste which I feel is important, especially as there are so many struggling to feed themselves and their families due to budget cuts).
“Food  is arguably the best thing about being alive”  Me: “Not sex?”
Avocados fuck avocados
Itd be nice if they could do a video on palm oil and its affect. Aren't palm oil plantations much worse than meat?
Oh okay so instead of multimillion dollar CEOs just taking a few less bonuses so they can be more sustainable and environmentally friendly is NOT a logical solution. Obviously the most logical solution is for us, regular people, to work our entire lives around this problem that was created by greedy multi million dollar CEOs.
I love meat and it’s my staple and I have never been healthier
Kurzgesagt:”first 1000 people to click link” Me:*sees 1.6 million views Me. Ok
You heard Kurz, the vegans were right. :D
So this is if we stop using meat. But what if we stopped using wood? Isn't the removal of trees worse than the reutilization of a land? Both removes the trees, yes, but one re-utilize the area while the other leaves it dead.
Don’t eat your friends 💚 just be vegan
This video compared emissions from free roaming and factory sources, but I want to ask about cultured meat, which is one of the latest technologies in meat farming that might be able to replace the former two. How does it compare in emissions?
Everyday is leg day!
Cool! I choose to do nothing with this information and continue on as I always have. Knowing that I am personally responsible for the destruction of the planet solely because of my diet and not the corporations actually farming these animals is a badge of honor honestly.
The animated burger was made poorly. You think the tomato is going to taste good in contact with the meat and ketchup? You have to separate the vegetables with the cheese, or at least put the lettuce touching the meat. I expected better from this channel
starting from the premise that it's bad even though it's literally part of humanity's diet and evolution.  okay.
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive”   Everyone who loves food: “I felt that”
How about Verticle Farming and Cultured Meat? How do these stack up? How far away are they from mass market (are they a dream)?
great video
i found something misleading for the first time on this channel :O 100 years of removed CO2 is framed next to 1 year and it makes it look dispropotionally significant.
The video was decently argued, as expected from this channel. Still, I think there are some caveats that you missed.  1 - The completeness of protein from meat makes it a much easier source of protein, while plant protein is hard to combine to get an effective growth 2 - intensive cultivation destroys soil, while grazing can restore it, so a part of the farmlands should be periodically left to cattle 3 - animal products contain other nutrients at a density much higher than plants, with few exceptions. Veggy alternatives are a poor failure nutritionally and while ok once in a while they are not an alternative. Insects could fare much better in that sense. 4 - an animal should be used in every part, from organs to bones to lean cuts. This greatly increases the efficiency.  So, yes, we should eat a little less meat, mostly grass fed, and change the way the whole animal is used. By law.
I cut beef and pork out of my diet completely, however still eat some fish and chicken maybe once or twice a week. Feels more like a treat now than anything and I'm finding I eat waaaay more vegetables now too (which is objectively healthier for both myself and the planet!)
One of the greatest and hardest differential equation. Too mamy damn variables.
How about switching to insect meat?... I see it as one of solutions...like farming bees it produces honey help polinate ang also we could eat the bees as meat?...
in conclusion : just eat veggies. not because we care about those animals but we care about climate changes :) take that shitty vegan teacher
Interesting that killing millions of sentient beings wasn't even mentioned as a reason to avoid eating beef or other animals.
Insect protein😈
wasnt there lots of developement on synthetic meat? How do those compare to regular meats?
meat should cost a lot more so people will buy less, but i know that's not how economy works so yea...
Kurzgesagt team, please make a video soon about the differences between monoculture crops (i.e., single-crop field farming) and some alternative farming techniques. It would be super cool to see topics like that explored on this channel.
So much misinformation, bad understanding and plain lies...
Well i am still hoping for lab grown meat. If that could be done at reasonable prices you would kill two birds with one stone, yummy meat with a far lower enviormental impact.
Relating to environmental impact it would be interesting to see you guys do a video on entomophagy with how efficient insects are.

I didn't expect this channel to become so populist. There is a lot of evidence which states that beef is not an issue for climate change. Why are you insisting so much on this?
Moral of the story:  The best way for the planet to not commit die due to carbon emissions from food is if we humans suddently turned into herbivores.
Haha... people still willfully interpreting the video as being somewhat ‘pro’ meat... It isnt... if most people, especially in the western world, drastically reduced their demand for red meat, all meats, it would make an AMAZING difference in our land management, water usage, deforestation etc... we really cant keep our head in the sand just because its a tasty, easily accessible food item.. we need to make some sacrifices, now, in this matter.
Moderation is the key. Eat weekly  twice or thrice. Good for environment, good for health.
I respect that this video took the worst case as an example... but it really should be "Is beef really that bad?". Also, nutrition is a lot more complex than just kg, protein or calories. This is a really good first video in a series, but discussion of nutritional differences in protein (for amino acids, availability and functionality, which is all wildly complex), other meats, alternatives and so on. Also, I would love a section on restorative farming. Is it actual something to consider or is it desperate meat farmers grasping at straws?
Thirst actually...
What if instead of antagonising food groups we antagonised food waste? The ammount of products thrown away is insane. And that is actually something anyone can contribute to WITH personal benefit. Dont buy more than you can eat and dont throw away perfectly edible food.
1st world should be like a 3rd world country, here eating meat is such a luxury, normally we only eat plant based ingredients or fish
Our progeny will feel embarrassed by us the same way we feel embarrassed by the actions of our ancestors while reading a history book.
Who else is vegetarian here
Imagine still believing in man made climate change
I'm going to be the most hated person on youtube ever, but let's be honest here:  Why you play the blame game towards brazilians since for keeping their forests intact while Europe/all other 1st world countries burned it to the ground?  1st world can set the (ungodly) price for Xboxes (about 8 brazilian minimum wages during this black friday for Series X) and vaccines, and agree that somehow it's Brazil's responsibility to solve that 26% piece of the pie, we can also fund that 10 trillion USD ticket by overtaxing meat from the poor and skip the problem altogether.  Seems like a lovely idea except if you're an unlucky 'Brazuca'. Also you can keep you 2 tonne SUVs to take kiddos to soccer practice, maybe even a little wheelie on it if rich fellas feel moral licensed enough after forcing the weaker to solve climate change and refrain from having goodies.
I don't eat beef. I love pork and chicken tho.
Food isn't best part of being alive. I hate eating. But I have to do it everyday so I guess there is no choice.  And yes, I can cook my own food and it takes a fucking hour of my each day and eating it takes another and I go to the grocery store and transport by walking. And yes I eat healthy, tasty and cheap despite it not being easy.
one fact is wrong. there is no clear evidence how much meat causes emissions.
T.
Veganism has a lot of strong arguments. The ethics of it being the strongest, which I'd like to see your opinion on. I find most people's' core values already align with veganism, without them even realizing it.
ddrr
This felt like the most mythbustery episode of your videos yet. Also very entertaining and informative.   Next time I talk about this I would know what I am talking about!
algorithm comment
What will you do if, in 20 years, nothing has happened?  (No rise in sea level etc)
Go vegan for empathy not climate*
8:28 You are kind of wrong here chickens and pigs can eat anything, pigs can eat even humans. You did a good job on the rest of it, finally someone who doesn't blame it on cows, I didn't expect it. The truth is raising animals properly is a very demanding job, your livestock becomes your family. Many are taking shortcuts in order to make money, these shortcuts lead us to this point. Believe me the planet isn't the only thing suffering the consequences, humanity's health is too.
Kurzgesagt: No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old. Me: 😶
7:10 Mongolia :D
All I heard was "we can't do anything"
Isn't the methane from cows basically a closed cycle, i.e. it degrades into carbon dioxide which is absorbed by plants which the cows eat and release back into methane?
This could have been a fundraiser for the veggie meat burger
I don't feel any guilt .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  Because I'm a Hindu 🕉️ XD
Biggest mistake ever made by the United States of America was driving the bison to near extinction, and destroying the grasslands of the Great Plains to farm land. Bring by the grass lands & bison, and eat what the Native Americans ate.
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive”  bro this hurt on a personal level... i literally can't eat food 😭
Taste is all that matters. Make some good fake steak or accept that meat eaters won't give a shit.
that vegan teacher is gonna GET SO MAD AT THIS
All we talk about animals is for food and how to breed them to cut emissions,but no one think about life of these animals. Are they only for food?
I’ve been doing some research myself on this and I really appreciated the fairly simple and holistic view, there’s a lot more to dive into but as always a great job was done to simplify and present to a general audience. It would be awesome to get these videos more in depth too, taking the time to really dive deep
Meanwhile me living off of cereal and milk, and sometimes eggs.
Don't forget the fact that fruits and veggies account for 90% of food waste. There's much more to this than you're telling here. Eating nose to tail would help immensely along with the 100% grass feeding/finishing. It would require less animals and if we obtained meat from more sources than just cattle it would be even better. There's a whole world out there full of creatures we could eat. Starting at home with stray cats and dogs or those that won't get adopted out would also be a good start. Pets contribute quite a bit to carbon emissions but for some reason they're not getting shafted like beef is. It's laughable the lies that are being spread to feed the unhealthy vegan agenda (no pun intended). And yes, vegans are unhealthy. I have yet to see a vegan that wasn't exhausted and stick-thin. That isn't healthy. Protein is the most important macronutrient and you willingly deprive yourself of your healthiest, most nutrient-dense source? Smart.
Officially this is a video that analyses both sides. You even give a neutral answer: It's complicated. Unfortunately, there are only arguments against meat. Which might have been ok if you also had taken a clear stand with a definite answer. What you are doing here is providing people who already believe that meat is bad with arguments to re-enforce their beliefs. And doing it under the guise of rationality. Viewers who already agree with you will feel better about themselves but will learn very little. This is not honest, in my opinion. Given the arguments, the title of your video should not be a question. You should have the intellectual courage to stand by the conclusion that comes out naturally from the arguments you presented.
Hello there, First of all thanks for all your amazing videos, I love your work. Secondly, thanks for this video, it was really nice. However I am a bit bothered that when you talk about eating locally, you take as comparison only food shipped via cargo. Even if that might be the biggest part, the products imported by airplane are having a much bigger impact. There is as well the topic of eating seasonal food to limit the carbon print of green houses etc. I understand that's you cannot mention everything in a short video, but the length allocated to local food seemed a bit short... :/ Anyway thanks again for your work and keep it up
Can we talk about all the food waste and how little diversity in food we have bolth for use and are meat farms.
Best thing about living in a 3rd world vegetarian country - guilt free climate change videos
Very informative 👍🏻👏🏻
What's funny that vegans will never admit, is that there are no vegan protein sources that don't also have a bunch of fat/carbs. Chicken breast, yogurt, cottage cheese, shrimp, canned tuna, egg whites. These are items that are 85% protein or more. You simply won't find this in any plants.
Now i am scared
How about synthetic meat? Is that a viable alternative? What is its impact on our climate?
Everytime I get a paper straw that dissolves in my soda I buy a bag of 100 plastic straws and toss it into the ocean.

We can feed billions of animals with grains and legumes but we couldn't feed 8billion humans. Billions of cows and chickens and pigs never miss a single meal in factory farms while there are millions of humans starving at the same night.    Animal agriculture is cancer to the planet, to the animals and to humanity itself.
Cultured meat needs to hurry the hell up
Don’t Cows use land we can’t for other things
We have increased the coverage of Forrest by the area of Australia, over the last twenty odd years. The greater mass of animal life is represented by insects, you haven't even mentioned fish. Is this a year twelve production?
People have no clue about the horrible environmental impact of avocados, maybe you should look that up ;)
What do you mean? Meat is amazing.
You should do a video on Yellowstone, quite a scary subject and might erupt in the next century
Now make a video on the ethics of meat consumption
So cows are just big masked birds
I have bought your immune book and boy am I blown away by all your illustrations and simplification of such a complex system! I am seriously sad that it took me only a month to finish. Would like to see more such books!
If i buy local in Belgium it's not transported, you can go to the farmer or field or honesty shop and collect your goods there.
Have you accounted for at least 2 different road journeys to get from farm to exporter and from exporter to the shipping port for each container which gets shipped? And at least 2 other similar trips when the container reaches its destination. You should've shown 4 trucks on each container to dispel the myth that international transport is super efficient. - Vinit & Apurva
9:04 What does beef-free diet mean? Not eating cow meat, but still enjoying milk, cheese, chicken, etc. are ok. Or not eating anything a cow can make?
One thing you didn't mention, is that cattle are often fed the stalks, blades, and hulls, of the grain crops.  That is, the parts of the plants we can't eat.  This stuff, if discarded, or composted, could produce lots of greenhouse gasses, from decomposition and from transport.  Cattle and other livestock also produce manure that we often depend on to fertilize the crops, especially organic crops, and many places have regulations which disallow the use of human sewage for fertilizer, and even if it could be allowed, it would still have to be transported from urban areas to the agricultural areas.  Yeah, the complexity of this whole situation just keeps on building.  The fact is, whatever we do, we're probably boned, because there are too many people on this planet, and the numbers keep increasing, which means more farmland, less forests, and more greenhouse emissions.
I ate only meat and mostly cows for quite some time. Unfortunately eating only meat makes me feel so much better and so much more productive. So I am not switching to vege. If climate change is a price I'll take it. After all, looking at the human history we have done far worse things to each other than nature could ever do.
They will always say, “we have 10 years until the earth ends” then 10 years passes by and….. nothing.
Kurzesagt: can you please solve climate change and all world problems for us?
"Everybody asks what da cow is doing, nobody asks _HOW_ the cow is doing"
give up both vegan and meat based diet. Save 5 billion hectares of land.
Why wasn't cultured meat mentioned in this video? Future Meats already has cultured chicken breasts almost at price parity and they just opened their first factory. Factories running on renewable energy would remove a lot of the issues stated in this video. Emissions from giant animal farms, the clearing of forests for farmland to feed the animals, the abuses suffered by animals on factory farms. Pair that with hydroponic plants for fruits and vegetables and a lot this is solved. The real issue is governments not funding the research and development of these technologies that would give the best of both worlds because its expensive in the short term.
In short: we need to capture all cow farts before they fly into the sky
Yes animator, I noticed the tractor tires deforming at 1:03
I reckon if we give up all life pleasure, stop human activity and just wait for the end we will save the climate.  Let people live, geoengineering now!
we wouldnt be here without meat
This is a flawed argument. Surely the problem is the size of the human population and the fact it is constantly increasing making more demands on global resources? What about methane released from melting permafrost? No consideration given to fishing and the pollution from it. If meat production stopped overnight what would we lose (cattle, sheep, pig, chickens all extinct?) what are the downsides of pet ownership (methane, pollution, etc?)
If you still believe that climate change is a thing in 2021, wake up. It's nothing more than a political playing card.
Show them how much nutrients are actually in factory farm animals. Better show them the process animals go through in meat production factories
You know you're really up shit creek as a civilization when anorexia seems to be the best way of countering climate change.
Meat is good but overconsumption of a resource is not sustainable and brings imbalance. Eat meat responsably.
Really appreciate the gratitude journals on the back shelf at the start of the sponsor message
Go Vegan
beef is way too expensive, I barely can afford it. Maybe once or twice a month
It is also healthier to at least decrease meat consumtions for our personal health.
Great analysis, as always. However, it should be stated that putting the burden of fighting climate change only on the shoulders of average people isn't going to work. Sure we can all do our part, but our part is tiny compared to the titans of industry and world leaders whose decisions have a much bigger impact on humanity's future.
You missed something… animals raised on factory farms don’t eat food from their natural organic diet — instead eating pellets and faeces covered with diseases.
This is a really complex subject and it would be impossible to cover every facet of it it a video but I think the video is kind of one sided (for the record I'm a big fan of Kurzgesagt and honestly not a even big fan of beef). I don't think comparing greenhouse emissions from biological sources to emissions from fossil fuel and mineral sources is an apples to apples comparison even if they were chemically identical. Emissions from fossil fuel and mineral sources is carbon that is being added to the carbon cycle that had previously been sequestered from it for hundreds of millions of years, whereas emissions from biological sources are just moving carbon that is already part of the carbon cycle (today's cow burp was last year's CO2 which became the crop that the cow ate).     Also, if methane emissions from livestock is the problem that the video makes it out to be, there are additives (such as certain kinds of seaweed) that all but eliminate methane emissions (at least from cows), or we can add microbes to the livestock's feed that eats the methane while it is still in the animal's gut and converts it into an essential nutrient for the animal or in the worst case convert it to CO2 (which would reduce the emission's effect 20fold or so).     As far as land use goes for supporting these animals, there are ways of farming that are much more efficient than typical factory farming that actually simulate an entire ecosystem by having certain kind of livestock and plants share the same land, performing different roles. Some of these farming techniques are actually carbon negative and actually make the land more ferial over time. They aren't used more often because they use to be more labor intensive (now with things like GPS, aerial multispectral surveillance, and global wireless internet this no longer needs to be the case) and are actually restricted or outright illegal for use in  commercial farming due to (usually) well intentioned but outdated laws and aren't widely known about because as a busy commercial farmer, why learn what you aren't allowed to use?   There is lots more to say but I don't feel like writing a novel in the Youtube section and I don't think you really feel like reading one lol.
Is it really true about buying local change nothing? In your movie it looks like you eat that avocado or whatever from cargo container on a ship. Did you add up all other transport necessary for bringing goods on ship, and then from it to shop shelf?
modern dairy farms can convert food bio products, and grow there own food/fertilizer. they can also have methane collectors that power that farm. cows are also used for more then just meat like insulin.
Me who only eats pork and chicken : *hmm beef about beef*
Why isn’t this viral when stupid staged videos are
Nice video and summary. although meat is a problem - Me, and most people, would still eat meat without much of a care on where and how it was made
Just stop eating meat guys. I have. It's easier to do now than it has ever been. We all need to come together to end world hunger, end factory farms (and their perfect conditions for new disease generation) and deal with climate change.
Thanks for the objective information, you are doing good work. As a farmer, i have a few remarks though. - Have you considered the role of grass and feed cereal as a resting crop in a crop rotation scheme?  - Can all the feed cereal be used for human consumption? - When animal manure is used in the cultivation of food crops, less fertilizer is needed. Should these fewer emisions not be attibuted to meat and dairy production?
Why should we reduce carbon and stop climate change? For who? The generarions before didnt think about it and live great lives in comfort and enjoy what they want. So why we shouldnt do the Same? I mean, safe the Planet for what? In a few Million years sun burn Earth down. Anytime its over, so or so. Why not now?  Just Think about my words.
I honestly think veggie pattys taste better then beef for aome reson.Theres something special abbout them
Loving my keto diet.
This is the only channel that I see consistently get on trending every time they upload
How many Kg of beef can you get out of a single cow? I imagine the methane output would be the same as a single KG.
Is everything that Kurzgesagt researches complicated?
Realistically speaking, getting people to stop eating meat just won't happen in a large enough scale and soon enough to solve the problem. The next best thing would be to either produce animal feed directly in the lab without using any farm land, or lab grown meat that's indistinguishable from the real deal. Both of these are already becoming a thing, btw.
Always a good day when there is a upload by you guys!
7:12 YUUURTS!
Everything is put into "greenhouse gas footprint" nowadays. Hysteria about the topic is ridiculous.
O'Neil cylinder farms when?
Its the rich who eat all this beef. Resturaunts who waste the most. Do not believe for a second that your diet choices impact global emmisions. Food also isnt the only use for cattle. Leather and Bone can be useful too.
I agree with everything you say. But I ain't stopping eating meat. I love Chicken and Goat very much to stop it now or even reduce it.  If the govt cares enough and does not succumb to lobbying money, then tell them to pass a bill to levy high tax on meat. Then maybe I will think about it. But that's a shitty thing too, you are just out pricing the poor from eating meat.  So just ignore food now and maybe concentrate on big industries and factories. Or put more effort into making fake meat good and cheaper. That's the only way out to convert people like me.
The only way to get people to say killing hundreds of millions of animals every day is bad is by saying it's going to make life a little unpleasant for people within fifty to a hundred years. I know I'm part of a miniscule minority in saying this, but meat is also bad because of the mass torture and killing.
What I want to do with this info is kill myself to stop eating meat entirely.
The main problem isn't even meat when it comes to climate change. It's a stupidly small percent of emissions. Sure wish people that protested meat had that same energy against coal and fossil fuels, ya know, the literal actual problem.
Some criticism at 9:30   If you're going to do comparisons like those, switching from 100 years to 1 year feels a tad sneaky. You could've added a 3rd bar for the 100 years or something to show the full grasp, since not everybody will notice the switch in timeframes.
Eat bugs, do not support your local businesses Yeah, I understood
my grandfather always said that cabbage gives him the toots so technically cabbage produces a pretty high carbon footprint in my family
There have been no high quality studies published which suggested meat is harmful to humans in any way. The myth that meat is bad is based entirely upon media amplifying a handful of poorly controlled, long term memory reliant self report studies.  Most environmental arguments are also disingenuous. Quoting vast water consumption numbers without clarifying that most of that water is rain water that happens to fall on the farmland. Or vast food consumption without clarifying that the majority of that are the humanly indigestible leftovers of crops grown for humans. Or that when farmed in a responsible manner, ruminants play a vital role in a pastural ecosystem.
8:17 stocks
You should start making videos about weather modification technology and geoengineering as a cause to the current climate crisis and stop blaming us little people for choosing to eat meat.   The push toward plant-based or synthetically grown meat is propagated by the World Economic Forum, United Nation's Agenda 21 (Agenda 2030), billionaires and celebrities. Use your brains, why are the global Elite pushing this agenda? Obvious. It is to gain control on the food that the people eat. This prevents any revolt against their desired new world government. Wake up people. This YouTube channel only makes these agendas easier to swallow. Stand your ground.
What an amazingly informativ video with good questions and answers.
Ahh yas da beef stocks
So… we need to eat less and lower the human population. I’m ok with that.
Kurzgesagt making the world a better place, one video at the time. Love it!  As others have pointed out, there are important negative aspects not mentioned in this video. Do your research, comrades.
I expected to see farming byproducts that we cant use being used to feed livestock to turn them into high quality food products.
Watching a video from Kurzgesagt about emissions assuming all humans are vegans would be arguably interesting!
That awkward moment when the vegans were right all along.
Kurzgesagt flips their view on this topic more than a compass in the Bermuda triangle.
so factory feed are good not bad choose wisely morality or for the greater good
Blah blah blah. Typical climate change and vegan propaganda. If you believe this sh1t I feel sorry for you  Eat steak men, the soyboys can't stop you anyways
One big lie of this video is that we feed livestock with crops directly but in fact many of their food consists of agriculture wastes which would be useless if we quit consuming meat entirely. Let alone it would increase the production of these wastes beacuse we should produce more crops for our own. Soy shells and plants leaves that we cannot eat are fed to animals. all of these calculation are wrong without considering this effect
10:24 Animation mistake. Sleeve is at front of the sewing machine. Awesome video as always. Can't wait for your next one! (/^o^)/
must eat just potatus
Sex beats food 😂
What if we tweak genes of cattle to emit less methane and those of crops to contain more chlorofil, thus producing more oxygen?
I didn’t think food would be part of my thinking when it comes to Global Climate… this is getting more complex and difficult by the day. (I say this as more of a Chicken fan than Beef)
This was a great video But I'm still eating beef, and when I can. I love it too much.
Thanks for the upload. I'll stick with my delicious steak.
I wonder what the environmental impact of lab-grown meat is/ will be
Who else noticed the Helper T cell at 9:45?
I jsut had a debate on this, I could have used this video but Kurzgesagt is 5 days late lol
I feel proud to be a Vegetarian Since birth
I have decided that I shall eat beef no longer.
Make a video on lab-grown meat.
You make plants that taste as good as beef and I will switch.
Gotta enjoy my bacon salad while I still can😅
8:08 nikocado avocado kurzgesagt collaborabtion
I agree with your points
Such a biased video.
I understand the premise of this video but struggle with some of the facts, it has been seen that through correct farming practices like ‘regenerative agriculture’ ruminate animals can be grown on farmland and will sequester more carbon into the soil then the animals are releasing. Furthermore, although yes feed lots are more efficient they are releasing more carbon dioxide and methane than pasture raised as they require grain to be produced and fed.
Meanwhile in my youtube shorts: M E A T S
Video is too short and needs more elaboration on a case by case basis.
simple, tax CO2 producing products. companies will reduce CO2 emissions to sell more, or raise prices which will lead to less customers needing to be fed.
just eat humans it will solve anything
"[eating] never gets old."  Let me introduce you to depression.
There's no avoiding climate change. Just eat a balanced diet of meat and veg and you'll be golden
Buy foreign and eat plant based
Wow very simplified I'm like 15 and I've understood every single word congratulations on your amazing channel
Ethics: it is unethical to kill innocent animals to eat.
Just tax pollution
The problem starts when people stress others to go Vegan or Vegetarian completely..... Eating meat occasionally, opting to eat chicken instead of meat, or even having meat as a snack in your diet instead of it being main item in ur meal can also reduce alot of carbon footprint.  We want to save environment, work, earn to live, and what is living if you can't eat what you want
cool the monkey changed again
Beef Stonks
Its always a good day when kurzgesast posts 😁
You forgot about forest albedo. Forest much worse than crop fields in terms of solar reflectance.
idc I will still eat my juicy double cheeseburger and tender steak
Most of the water in grass fed beef production is rain water, and when cows pee that water stays in the water cycle
I think it'd be really interesting if we started using cattle to revitalize dried out/barren grasslands and reduce CO2 emissions that way. Cattle grazing, trampling, and pooping actually can bring grasslands back to life and many ecosystems are missing that since humans have fenced the world off. There's a really interesting TED talk about it from a few years ago.
So basically indian Hindus are geniuses in their food habits.
Every time you guys post I feel like I need to send the video to the president I swear. Best YouTube channel out there.
You WILL eat bugs and be happy
That cow in the thumbnail is oddly terrifying :D
Cutting down trees doesn't really release any carbon in the grand scheme of things- if that wood is harvested properly and used. Think about it- every plank of wood used to build a house or a shed, is carbon that's been sequestered- and then, the spot where the tree that plank came from used to be, can now grow a new tree. I know that's not the main discussion of the video- but I just had to make this point when I heard the point about cutting down trees to make new fields, that (selectively) cutting down trees (and then replanting them) isn't bad. It's just rotating out for the next generation of trees.   Since we started fighting forest fires, WE now have to steward the forests that flames cleaned and refreshed. If we don't, they're going to become cramped, rotting, unproductive messes, or massive fire hazards- and I know this, because I've SEEN this.
YES!!!!!
Had a couple striploins tonight pan seared in salted butter with white truffle balsamic glaze. It will happen again. I cannot be stopped
What about the best meat vs the worst plant?
Video suggestion: Can you guys show us the current status of lab grown meat and vertical farming technology? Love your work!
I'm just going to completely stop consuming beef. We usually only eat meat around 4 times a week. But if everyone just stops consuming beef and dairy, that's already 2 billion hectares. We can do atleast that.
There is a slight flaw in the logic of transportation in this, If 1 KG of plant take the same amount of time taken to transfer meat, then doesn't it mean it takes the same amount of CO2 emissions for beef or meat? Also don't the plants transported globally also need to be transferred to the local market? I mean we don't buy the plants from the docks but the store. It takes the same amount of CO2 by transportation regardless of meat or plants.
Look into Indian food for vegetarian meal ideas
There is a huge elephant in the room that nobody notices: if we stop eating animals, what are we going to do with all of them? Are we going to let them eat crops and emit CO2 anyway, are we going to sterilize them, or let them freely roam in the highways and cities? It's a serious problem.
As a vegan, I would be very keen on a video that compared meet subsistutes like beyond beef and impossible burgers with a pure plant diet, since surely these substitutes have some sort of environmental overhead associated with their manufacturing costs. Of course, if someone stops eating beef because they decide that they can tolerate a beyond burger, it is probably still a net gain for the environment, but I would be curious to know how they factor into this equation.
Soon labs are going to be able to produce „real“ meat by growing cells taken from a cow infinitely and they will most likely taste the same. If that happens many people might be able to switch to lab grown meat. Which has a way lower co2 footprint then the massive farms
Basically all this video really highlights is that we are screwed without carbon capture. Don't understand why we aren't throwing money at it.
This was a very good video, as while it gave all the necessary stats, it doesn't try to emotionally abuse you into going vegan.
今子有五石之瓠，何不虑以为大樽而浮乎江湖，而忧其瓠落无所容？则夫子犹有蓬之心也夫！ 你现在家里有这么大的一个瓠瓜，太好了，你怎么怕没有用处呢！你要晓得，古代的交通，不是这样方便，要搞只船很难啊！你就把那个瓠瓜弄干了，挖成空心，你坐在里头，像坐大船一样，浮呀浮呀！很舒服嘛！随便去哪里不用花钱，不要买轮船票，到处都可以玩。结果你还这样担心，那样担心，怕这个东西太大了，没有办法用。“则夫子犹有蓬之心也夫！”庄子这一句话，不但骂了惠子，还骂了古今中外天下人。你那个心，你那个脑子里都是蓬草，是个大草包，大笨蛋，所以后世骂人，文学上讲作蓬心，这个典故就是这里来的。  这一节我们借用佛学的观点，给他作一个小结论，这是讲智量、境用的异同。世界上的事，无所谓大小，同样的一样东西，也无所谓好坏，区别是在它的作用。一个小事情，一个不相干的人，如果碰到智量大、见地、境界应用高的人，可以将之应用到齐家、治国、平天下。修道也是同样一个道理，见地、智量高的人，一个不相干的方法，可以使他达到了超越的境界。反之，如果他的智量、境界、应用见地不够的话，最了不起高明的东西，对他也没有用处。  以庄子来说，他本身很高明，写了一部书，结果呢？我们后人学者只为拿学位作些论文而已。这就把庄子用小了，也把庄子变成惠子的瓠瓜了，很可叹！
And not a single word about lab grown meat which has a far better sustainability profile...
There is something very important the video didn't cover, and that is wasting food.
It took 12 minutes to say "no"...?
For the Vegan in the comments section that's shoving your ideology to us omnivores (which is basically just normal human) Here's what I want to say, NOT all People is easy to have their ideology changed, and Vegans forcing it to people who don't want to have their diet changed is making it even fucking annoying and making people who wants to join Vegan diet harder because how fucking annoying you ARE! I'd rather be Vegetarian tbh than joining a dietary movement that's forcing people into joining our cause(which is useless tbh, being Vegan won't stop anything, slaughter house is still there giving employment to people while Veganism doesn't do anything other than destroying their job, but heh, Vegan don't think this far, they only think what could satisfy them, not other people, nuff said
"could that title be any longer" LOL
I hate being someone who can't eat 99% of foods in life. Everyone talks about how much food means to them while I waste away, eating a diet of potatoes, bagels, chicken and rice, every day. I feel so jealous of people whose stomachs can eat gummy bears and bratwursts. I feel so much envy for those who can eat ice cream and pizza. I wish I could feel better and eat carrots again.
you forget one thing when it comes to cereal crops, most of the cereal they use for animals is a bad quality that humans cant use
Haven't they been calling it "rapid" climate change since the 70's?
You dont have to replace meat. Just stop eating anything that runs away from you.
Such an amazing video.
_Worst Choices : Beef, Lamb, Pork_ (Carbon Emissions per Calorie isn't worth) _Semi Decent Choices : Poultry and Fish_ (Good for Taste and Less Carbon/Calorie) _Best Choices : Insects and Worms_ (Might not be appealing but they barely give any Carbon and give basically the same protein and calories of Beef, Lamb, and Pork. If we somehow manage to mass produce it, we could be golden !)
1 strait solution become vegetarian  # vegetarian gang             1 kg meat take worth 7 full grown man consumtion 1 loaf bread just take 1 glass of water but ack like same as beef If we stop beef consumtion (dont become vegetarian  eat polutary you want) we migth stop world hunger by 2045   Humanity comes before luxury
Try the impossible burger it made of plants but taste like meat
VEGAN TEACHER COME HERE AND WATCH THIS
kurzgesagt is bullying people with information cause they care
Lol beef stonks. Nice
People think that it's either all meat or all vegetable. But in reality its all about a balanced diet. All the toxic vegans are talking as if a normal person eats like 100 kg of meat every now and then. Like seriously, who on earth eats meat every single day? Same goes for vegetables. You cant just eat the same thing every single day.
A lot of the food we feed farm animals is not suitable for humans anyway. You are being misleading by saying otherwise. We're not going to eat the waste products like we feed animals, we can't eat soy hulls or corn cobs for instance. If these products were not used they would be converted into CO2 anyway. A lot of food gets wasted. Reducing how much gets wasted would be a much more realistic approach than not eating meat.
Lol, there is a beef that is lab-grown. Lab-grown meat has less impact on the environment,
Preserve cows and produce milk and all other dairy products to gain protein instead of directly killing them.  Hindus aren't morons who already know this fact from many years
Kurzgesagt wait up. I'm all for this video and eating less meat but also for science, and at 9:35 that's 800 billion tonnes of CO2 removed over a *hundred* years vs ~50 billion tonnes emitted per *one* year. So, that bar in the bottom should be ~5.000 billion billion tonnes emitted per one hundred years and we see that there is still much more work required of us. Are you afraid it will demotivate people? Well then get back to your nihilistic roots and explain it as "Do it or die".
Hey, this is my engineering project. I must do an entire life cycle assessment for any product of my choice, so, just again your right on time.  guess I have to do some citations about u....
Disappointed the video doesn't mention Future Feed! It's a supplement developed by an Australian science organisation which can reduce methane emissions of cattle by over 90%! It's an extremely important tool in our fight against climate change and yet it's almost never discussed.
if you think about it, most of the time you’re eating beef, it’s from a place like mcdonald’s. so they’re the ones to blame
End of the day: We can reduce gasses by abusing animals ability to roam free, as we can use carbon capture to catch all excess gasses. We can then use the gasses to fuel crops in greenhouses which will help growth of food that can be used to feed the animals.  Really meat isn't that bad for the environment, but it's the way we process them that makes them bad.  Sadly animal activists will only protest and not come up with humane caging facilities to hold and process the animals.
That aves really sits next to it's cooked relative on that barbeque dishes.
Ok but what about fish. There is way more volume in the ocean then there is area on the land. Plus there is more area of water then the area of land. Explain this to me why we can't just mostly eat fish?
What a heartless video.
8:17 That’s like the time the narrator said and I quote “yeeted”. How funny!
Your sources source are pay walled
You missed something about delivering food: using big ship actually is worst in terms of co2 production because after containers reach the ports they use trucks to bring the food to storage and then supermarkets
WHICH IS THE "BEST" OF THE MEATS THOUGH?!? great video.
Moral of The Story [TL:DR] Make Beef, Lamb, and Pork as a Luxury Meat Product while making Chicken and Other Poultry Products as Our Daily Protein Source (Fish may also be added)       If you're really ballsy, try to farm crickets and earthworms. They're by far the best protein producer on the planet

It's time for each of us to significantly reduce our consumption of meat, dairy, and eggs. Or even better - Go vegan.
This is very misleading, you started by talking about "meat" which includes all sorts of animals but then you shifted to exclusively analyzing "beef" or "cow's meat" and comparing it with the least offenders on the list.   I'd like to see a video analysis comparing the sustainable indigenous hunting practices with other capitalistic methods of acquiring food and crops all-year-long that require a level of access and privilege.   I'd like to see you also talk about the disparity in access and choice among different socioeconomic levels within societies and between countries in being able to choose whatever food is available, affordable and valuable in terms of caloric density.   I'd like you to also mention how politics and imperialism plays an active role in destroying certain cultures' food systems for their economic gains.  I'm going to make a wild guess and say if we don't check the roles of privilege, politics, capitalism, imperialism, colonialism and white supremacy then eco fascism isn't that far away from taking a hold of the vegan conversation in the next few decades.
It’s really interesting that beef just so happens to be deeply entrenched in American culture. Imagine if some other random food was really bad for the environment instead of beef, let’s say oranges. I just can’t imagine people getting so emotional about the topic if science came out and said we all had to quit drinking orange juice.
So in other words, if we wipe out the entire live-stock population, we can massively decrease the carbon footprint? Genius idea!
I work at burger King and I swear wego through like two cows worth of meat everyday, it's insane how much meat gets used everyday across the planet, like how many cows get slaughtered a day and how do they maintain a growing stock of cows
I think I ever eat beef about less than a kilogram or never because my family usually doesn't let me eat beef
Turn vegan
I will continue consume meat that is mostly chicken, and I will refuse to feel guilts along the way

6:40 Activists: Nooo! You're wrong! XD
co2 was higher in earth's past than now and life thrived....  your premise is flawed.  if everyone grew his own fruits and veggies, and raise animals for protein, for his own use.. no one would need the emissions from transporting.  in fact, even people in flats grow in containers on balconies and patios.  anyone who believes gov't is responsible for feeding you and your family probably shouldn't have a family to feed...  the responsibility always falls on ourselves.
"vegan teacher taking notes right now" 📝📝📝
so what you are saying is... The best way to stop climate change is to end humanity?  ok noted :)
gotta get and roast some beef
Love the quality of the videos and the content
I'm trying to save the planet by eating the cows...less cow=less methane.  That's why I eat them. You're welcome vegans 👍
Nice to watch this video and feel like I'm doing my part, even if it doesn't matter in the big picture.
What about feeding ruminants with the parts of food crops that are inedible to humans? Was this taken into account? If not, how does it change the numbers? Also, how much non-agricultural land could be converted to a better carbon sink than it is now? Especially with de-desertification by forestation?
We can make it sustainable by tweaking nutritional requirements in meat, i.e. if you just use soy to feed caged animals, they'll lack certain nutritional values, therefore you can't sell that meat in the market. Attack the demand for soy in the first place.
Wacky hair and tongue sticking out? That's one savage bird.
Whatever this video says (haven't watched it yet) I'm still gonna eat meat.
Most problems can be solved if Earth has less population because, more the population, more the demand
I feel like this is really just a lose lose, annoying situation. There's a lot of us, and we gotta eat. And meat tastes absolutely delicious. But climate change bad. Suffering bad. Not to mention a lot of people ignoring this food crisis on one side, and a lot of vegans/vegetarians on the other side being insufferable and scoffing any time you dare whip some ham out.  Idk, I don't judge what someone eats. It's their own personal choice. But I do wish we'd hurry up and make lab grown meat more of a thing.
e
beef stonks hehehe
Malaysian pls...
I think what's still a major problem is cost, the veggie based options, or just fresh produce in general is often more expensive than the meat based options. And when you're living in or near poverty you often don't have the luxury to think about what carbon footprint your food makes, you're just trying to survive. And also comfort and time, if you only have a small amount of money to spend on food for your family, you're more likely to go for the more tasty, quick, calorie dense option, you can't blame people for wanting a little bit of comfort in their lives.
8:28 Pigs most certainly do not exclusively eat feed crops. They eat anything. A heritage site I worked at would raise pigs on all the food that the customers didn't eat, and we would then butcher the pigs and feed them to the customers. No reason to waste.
Basically, if everyone ate like an Indian "non-vegetarian", having meat maybe 1 or 2 days a week and predominantly not eating beef, our world would be a better place.
And the bief goes on and on
No amount of lifestyle change in the average consumer will make a dent in the amount of emissions that we pump into the atmosphere. Emissions are created at an industrial level mostly, and that’s where the work Has to be done. You may feel bad about eating meat, but you feeling bad about eating meat and deciding not to, even if all your friends do it to and all of their friends, is nothing compared to the amount of emissions created by industrial moguls. We need to be fighting them in their Emissions and making them make changes. That’s where it really matters. That’s where it starts
It's official I'm out of fucks to give about climate change and carbon emissions. You should've made a video about the heath implications instead
Corporations:its not our fault that we destroyed the planet  It's ur fault Plus we aren't gonna do anything about it  You do it instead
what about fish? vegans don't eat them but are there anything about them too?
This video answered many questions that are normally not addressed, but at 9:28 what would be the point of comparing the impact of a policy over 100 years with anual CO2 emissions other that to mislead the audience?
I liked the video, although I definitely feel that something of huge, massive importance is missing when agroecology (which includes agroforestry, and especially silvopastoral systems in the matter of meat) is totally left out. It is sad to see that people still don't know it is possible to grow crops without fertilizers and pesticides, or grow cattle without tearing down rainforests.  Even more, it is sad not to be able to watch compared data between agroecology and conventional agriculture and cattle raising. And that's not even including the enormous cultural baggage that agroecology approaches bring into the countryside and the communities living there.  Nevertheless, this video is a very nice work of scientific dissemination and that is worth noting. Congratulations.
nooo! i dont want the beef stonks to go down 70%!!1!11!!!
Birds eating beef. WTF
4:00: 'Only 10%' isn't a real thing. You only need ten of those to double something.  If you can find ten 10% advantages you've doubled your resources.  1% is huge.  .01% is when it becomes 'only'.
Thank you so much for your videos! Plus, I won one free month on skillshare, I think this last month of the year just turned out more productive, all of a sudden :)  Keep up the good videos, with lots of usable information!
correct me if i'm wrong, but i heard that cattle would produce significantly less methane if they were fed grass instead of beans like they do in mass production
Video about farting cows again
I feel like this is one of your most important uploads ever. Really opened my eyes about grass fed and pasture raised. Thank you so much for your amazing content!
This was interesting and informative, however, I've heard a lot about Alan Savoury's Holistic Land Management and Planned Grazing a method to maintain our meat production and combat climate change. Is there a chance you could do a video on that and the ins and outs of it? That is currently the main reason why I don't worry about changing my diet.
"dislikes are gone! release the meat video!"
Only channel I don't hate/troll on.
actually... how viable is "veganism" if the whole world go vegan, not just one type.. comparison between "pure vegan" and "vegan who consume fish and animal products to a degree).. can Kurzgesagt make hypothetical scenerio on that? that would be great.
why not just say we are overpopulated and this can't go on ?
the mcplant burger from mcdonalds was a verry good replacement, i hope it comes back.. it was only here for a month.  if big corperations like mcdonalds would give more options, it would make it so much easyer for most people.
As soon as I saw the huge spread of carbon on meat, I kinda knew they were gonna say the factory farms are better. Reality is just damn depressing.
8:14 i was like that Leonardo Dicaprio pointing meme
4:20 You're trying to tell me that buying food from overseas reduces carbon footprint? No, those avocados also need to be transported by trucks to and from ports. Also, you didn't include the emissions per calorie for the best beef (9kg CO₂ per 100g protein) probably to push your false idea that beef is bad for the planet.
just place trees back after choppin’ them
축하합니다! 당신은 한쿡인을 발견했습니다! 상금은 없습니다!

Please let's normalize vertical growing and lab produced foods. Work from home and convert high rise office buildings into these facilities. Turn farm land into forests again.
i sleep to this every night. it’s oddly comforting
Btw insects are the best source of meat tho it wasnt mentioned
What about fish?
I love you guys
What about the dangers of monocrops that sustain vegan diets? What about hunting elk or deer instead of only farming?  Please dont tell me Kurgezagt went woke
A NEW KURZGESAGT EPISODE   MY MONTH IS COMPLETE
No, it's not.
Yes it’s very bad. Didn’t watch vid but it’s 100 percent not good for u humans are herbivores
I do love the video. I myself am a beef fan but it's really not hard to replace beef with other products, like chicken or fish. But I think you missed an extremely important element that makes cows  invaluable: Milk.  Milk is arguably the 2nd most important liquid food product, after water. It's used in desserts, yogurts, cheese and as a healthy beverage. My parents used to live in their family farms and they had cows and told me that the main reason people have cows is milk and not beef. If they wanted meat, chickens are so much easier and better since they are not picky eaters, you don't need to take them to meadows; the only worry is that they might get eaten by foxes and such. I don't know if milk and eggs were taken into account on the kcal/emissions chart. If these 2 weren't taken into account, then I believe that you've missed a mountain.
I'll always go for chicken over beef or pork
You might think this intresting the cells in our bodies are living each with unique instructions for our bodies cells to perform specified cell function, That's why eating fresh fruits vegitables, seeds, nuts, grains are really important. Humans are like walking rainbows RoyGbiV all of the fruits and vegitables color are of the visual light spectrum. When you eat meat you're eating dead cells which have no instructions for the body. Eating meat over extended periods of time has caused many health problems to many people. it also has something to do with the spirit of being. Eating meat is a less sustainble biological nutrient for the body. Humans glow our bodies emit heat. it's because of the biochemical processes in the body.
well as bad as this all is im going to continue eating meat
MAXIMIZE BEEF PRODUCTION!
Yall so scared we're ruining things that everyone seems to forget that the earth has a natural cycle of hot and cold periods... a relatively short time ago there was a super massive glacier covering a large portion of North America and it melted well before we ever started having a measurable CO2 output
I have been desperately trying to find vegi Patty's that taste as good as beef Patty's. And I just can't. They all taste terrible.
Fish?
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old." The one that tops food is breathing, it is the one pleasure enjoyed by all and never gets old.

Amazing as usual.
Just eat more chicken or future insects mea products!
I know i don't really know what this complicated stuff is but I keep watching it I look like smart
In India we Don't Eat Beef.😘🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳
Now being “mostly vegetarian” is trendy. Back in my parent’s day, it was called normal life. Getting to eat pork once or twice a year was already a blessing.
Bullshit...literally... on the methane for cows. Being a geoscience student I had the opportunity which I actually just asked today about the consequence of CH4 over CO2. Knowing methane is a worse GHG I asked about the increase in methane especially due to the fact it breaks down into CO2 and its thought to be insignificant to the overall contribution to the warming of Earth. Make me a patty that taste like meat and I'll eat it. Good luck making a steak though but if you do I'll eat it too. Until then gimme ma porterhouse!
My decision is to continue to not care and try to enjoy my life
Plant crops kill far more sentient animals than animal farming.   Wrong. Plant crops are far less environmentally friendly than animal farming. You guys are better than this. Existing studies are incomplete, biased, and paid for by big plant food.   Animal products are these absolute most nutritious and environmentally friendly food.   Going regenerative farming widens the spread even further. Yes it is sustainable and it is near net zero carbon emissions.   Think and do your research people.
Chickens "NO ONE CARES I LIKE HUMANS FOOD CALLED FRIED CHICKENS"
Lesson: cow fart bad.
Awesome video. But the biggest unspoken truth here is simply: We need far fewer [soulless, disgusting] humans on this world.
I learn a lot!
So we should work on Willy Wonka's 3 course dinner gum to save the Earth?
I appreciate the focus on the carbon footprint of the meat industry and the mention of land use and destruction, but I would also like to hear about topics like waste runoff and the creation of more resilient viruses and antibiotic resistant bacteria.  Those are the other main factual environmental impacts without getting into more philosophical ones like the inhumane treatment of CAFO animals and the terrible working conditions in some sectors of the meat industry.
I'm eating chicken and rice as I'm watching this xD
In New Zealand nearly all beef is 100% grass feed and free-range. The idea of putting cows in barns is strange and considered cruel by most of us. Our meet production has a much lower than average global emissions level from my understanding
0:10 Uh...if you're not doing anything else multiple times a day that never gets old, you're doing it wrong
Meat doesn't have to disappear from your diet entirely. Add more grains and fruits and vegetables to your diet. Be more reserved with steaks. Seek out chicken and fish more. If everyone did this, the world still has a problem, but we'd have more time to fix things. You'll live longer too

Hi guys, we you do the same with fish or venison? A lot of countries here in the south pacific relies on fishing and hunting.
Worst video yet
Now, I want to see comparison of all this with insects as foods. Insects have higher protein content than any beef. So I wonder if insects r good altermate diet for protein rich food
"Well it's complicated" Is the most kurzegasgt thing ever
This video convinced me to go 100% beef. 👌😸🎩
@4:50 Those avocados don't top at the ports. They end up at the same places the meats do. Except there's less ports than farms and no ports in the interior US.
Okay I’m convinced, but what about other meats like seafood and shellfish?
I appreciate the efficiency measurements, but there's something those miss: Nutrient completeness. It is theoretically possible to get there with only plants, but it's is also much more difficult.
Yeah yeah, we get it. You wanna ban meat production cuz muh climate change.
Im bout to start eating bugs
Yeah well we are all fucked anyways ima go eat some McDonald’s
I love this channel but they do not understand this subject at all
I head somewhere bison was less environmentally expensive?! So let’s eat bison beef instead
No. I am going to eat meat anyway
I'm depressed already, thank you.
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old” are you sure you aren’t forgetting anything.
This has a real, "paid for by oil execs" vibe.
Humankind living on earth just a fraction of time compared to Earth's billions of years of existence. Look at what damage we managed to inflict on it only in our brief existences. It's like when you are finally in your mid fourties you suddenly find your organs start failing one by one from newly discovered bacteria you can't cure.
That statement for avocados and marine transport are really skewed. So its efficient to be burning basically the bottom of the pot heavy fuel oil to transport avocados. There fuel burn rate is tons per hour.
Beef stonks
The second I opened this video I instantly started looking for a comment form That Vegan Teacher, of which, the comment would probably be as long as a dictionary
U should do a video about the largest superstructure in the universe, the cosmic web
Well this is... Depressing.  Can growing meats in labs fix anything? Theoretically you'd need much fewer cows just for the sake of their DNA... Then again I'm kind of pessimistic about anything regarding food production anymore. Maybe we're just too far gone. Maybe we can't save the planet at this point.
So Europe and US can wipe out its forest to feed its people but Brazil bad?
Before Covid, I decided to try an Impossible Whopper at Burger King, and it was equally as good as a regular Whopper, so I decided, 'Why not?' and I haven't eaten a regular Whopper since, because meat is quite inefficient.
I don't get it. How can tomatoes and potatoes emit co2 when they grow on oxygen emitting plants? Anyone care to help
I love steak and beef
Meat is bad until you run into Korean BBQ. Then meat is too good with pork belly to pass.
I follow most of this but not the argument that local meat produce pollutes more than international shipping of plant produce.  The boats carrying the plants might not pollute very much, but unless people are buying the produce at the harbor, doesn't it have to be transported locally using the same transportation methods as meat?  So plant produce would actually pollute more because of shipping plus local transport or am I getting something wrong?
I'll say it: We need to figure out how to synthesize our favorite meats
Where does fish fall on the carbon scale?

This seems at odds with a previous video urging the viewer not to apply climate guilt to everyday personal decisions, and to instead support political action.   In this case, that includes things like applying diplomatic pressure to Brazil on their deforestation problem, funding research on how to scale up lab-grown meat, maybe even a carbon tax on meat, etc. (OK, kidding about that last one, we Americans will probably never accept carbon taxes.)
Man I think we should just reduce our meat consumption by eating it less often and regulating it.   Or better send all cow,pig etc. To Antarctica or attic they can't be used for agriculture and then use methane capture devices to capture All methane emition and use that Land to grow crops.    Or better use moon for all cattel rearing with better tech. Is it possible to raise cattel on moon and will it reduce Emissions . I don't think it can affect moons atmosphere as it have non.
Caloric density was stated, but not nutritional value. Someone who requires more can get it by eating meats and fewer meals where they can't get all the nutrients without a very diverse vegan diet served in very large portions.  And, in this world where we're seeing increased food sensitivities, alternatives aren't always an option.   3D printed meats are starting to show up, the processing increasing the caloric and nutrient density. However, these foods (like the impossible burger), require increased food processing, which has negative environmental impact.  The real bottom line is there are too many people on this planet for it to naturally sustain. We have to come up with methods for recycling the waste byproducts of our food production process, especially the ones which cause climate change.
Really fucking sucks that it makes more sense to confine cows to the slaughter for the sake of the climate. I eat meat, but I still hope and want a day where lab grown meats are a reality.
After watching this video, I really do appreciate that Kurzgesagt is addressing a heated topic in a public manner. However, I believe the talented people at Kurzgesagt working around the clock to bring us these beautifully made videos do not realise that some people just don’t care.  As a formally biased meat-eater, I believe a wide-scale internet-based argument is not wholly productive in any way, shape, nor form.  The internet is powerful. But not this powerful, to my great disappointment.
Why must it be between beef and veggie burgers, like some all or nothing decision (end of video)? I switched from red meat to turkey products (turkey burgers, ground turkey for tacos, turkey hot dogs) for health reasons more so than climate (half the fat, much lower cholesterol).  Tastes just as good as far as I'm concerned.  There's chicken versions too, but I haven't tried those. I still enjoy a steak on rare occasions like a birthday or anniversary (it is my favorite food).  But I try to cut down my red meat consumption as much as possible.  I think that's a much better goal and message....
Animal proteins and plant proteins are not the same, though. Meat has a very specific protein not found in plants for us, because we're omnivores.
You used to be a good channel - now just woke BS
Okay, as a farmer, I agree, we need to drastically cut meat production especially beef, we just don't need as much as we consume. However, I would like to point to crop rotation as an important reason to still keep some animals as it reduces fertilizer and chemical usage, both of which are much larger than you probably realize.  I would like to see more farming based emissions videos like this (Its a VERY hot topic where I am), I would be nice to see this brought up, but also burn offs and how they compare to simply plowing, cultivating and using massive amounts of herbicides.  Edit: so THIS is what it feels like to be famous. The reason that I made this comment is because I see too often that people (public, government and historical like Mao, Stalin and Mugabe) oversimplify farming. There is a lot to it and every farm is different. The biggest insult I feel, is having politicians who have never held a Labour job in their life preach about farmers and imposed regulations, disregarding the recommendations. Yet under this current government (I live in NZ) we went from burning 0 coal for electricity, to burning around 600,000 tonnes of inported coal across 6 months. It really shakes my faith that they actually know what they are talking about, and as such, I like to find videos like this in order to try and come up with my own solutions.
It’s all up to you with respect ✊
We evolved these sharp, strong structures called teeth so we can eat celery everyday. That makes perfect sense to me. 🤣
Should we eat meat? Kurzegesagt: Yesn't
Did you know that the ape at the opening is eating whole cow instead of fruit unlike other video. It's very nice detail.
Haha I always feel so guilty eating meat because I personally feel wrong destroying the planet by eating once was a living animal that fear pain, but I cannot safely go in a vegan diet. I’ve tried, and my doctor had to get me to quit trying due to how badly it affected my physical and mental health. I find it’s okay to eat meat for your health, but if you have the option to cut back please try to do so! You don’t have to completely drop meat to make a change, just eating less of it does cause an impact.
all of you guys are nice
I can still see dislikes oh yes
So we have only until near the end of 2040 before we have spent our carbon budget and not enough nations are doing enough to stop it.
Or you could develop Carbon capture tech and be done with this
vegans will go crazy watching this video
Damn bro, we’re fucked A bacon cheeseburger will make me feel better tho
the problem here is that a calorie from something is NOT equal to a calorie from another thing. Nutrition and sustenance is 2 completely different matter to start with. If we are going to still believe the so called "balanced diet" that our conventional medicine/healthcare advocates, then I say we do not need to worry so much .. you will not exist long enough to face the consequences.
And now I want a burger at 9 am
Basically just calling out What I Learned’s bullsh*t
i ate beef while watching this video i am a menace to society. it was worth it.
I'm evangelical about replacing ground beef with ground turkey. It tastes just as good, is cheaper, is healthier, and is better for the environment!
Short answer: Yeah. Interesting, time to build meat in vats. The part about free range food being worse than factory is brutal but logical.  Oi.
Basically low meat high vegetable diet is the way to go, not eating beef and instead eat chicken duck pork and fish for protein.
This video only focuses on emissions and doesn't take into the account absorbtions in food production.
Was my favorite channel threatened by meat industry?  Or is this the result of back fat backlash? Lol  Mostly kidding, i love this channel, and the previous neat video as well… i still eat meat but i try not to (anemia is a beast)
if meat-substitutes were CHEAPER then I would switch over.  same problem with orange juice costing more than gasoline.  ITS NOT LIKE ORANGES GROW ON TREES....
Bruh that vegan teacher should react to this
half the information on each argument, and only the half that benefits a poorly constructed argument. cherry pickers.
5:22 the way he says controversy makes me smile
I think food waste is an important factor when evaluating this as well since merely looking at demand in the lens of a demand to purchase doesn't establish the full picture. Supermarkets largely contribute to the demand in meat but a lot of it ends up getting thrown away. Some supermarkets don't even put a fair discount on meat as they would rather make money off of old meat than sell it for cheap. Demand =/= necessity
I believe that the co-existence of veg n non-veg food habits will maintain the equilibrium

You know what would get rid of a lot of carbon usage? Eating vegans. Watch your back.
No.   Bye.
That doesn't mean all peoples understand this some majority are stupid zombie peoples
I hate how in 2021 we still blaming climate change on individuals peoples, especially on a society where meat it’s more available and cheaper(not saying it’s good] it’s not, they tend to be unhealthy and it’s meat]). Let’s just ignore the elites companies who own our world leaders for their private gains and the ones destroying our planet
Gonna get buried but the significant majority of the food fed to cattle is non-human edible
What about proteins and fats vs carbohydrates in terms of digestion. I love my burgers and chicken because it makes things simpler to maintain fitness. when carbs come into play i get a excess of weight.
If vegans were this eloquent in putting their points across. i think most of us would consider.
Kurzgesagt: Is Meat bad? Also kurzgesagt: yesn't (cuz they don't wanna get canceled lmao)
(Joke Comment)  Why don’t we just grow the meat on plant fields and make it better for environment ez win
I think this video is searching too specifically into a single direction that we can take. It's also fair to acknowledge other possible paths. One of those is synthetic or lab grown meat, something that has been proven possible but is too expensive at the time. There has also been research into seaweed based cow feed, which has shown to reduce methane emissions from 50% to 74%. These aren't viable currently but so is a majority of people going vegan.
Totally agreed, that things are much complicated than it looks. A drastic step towards a single direction not gonna solve a thing. May harm further.
Okey
Kurtzgesagt. I agree and have read the same articales and heard the same arguments of co2 emissions from meat. But I also read alot that its an unfair comparasion just saying that meat should be "weaigth" on the merit on food production in meat or one output when the produce several "resources" in there life time. Dairy, meat, mauare can all Come from one animal. So we should in some way count all the calories and resources from one animal not just one specific type in every analys. And without all the manure/fertilizer food production would take a huge dive and more land would be used = more co2 emission. And animals also eat the non etable "waste" from human produce as in the steam and leaves from examble a corn plant. Human eat 20% of that plant mainaly the corn cob. But 80% is left but can mainaly be eaten by animals due to the fact of there ability to digest celloluse. Would such a analys be possible and would it change the Outlook on the impact of meat in any way?

Meat is more important that we know. If society is trying to convince you bugs are good to eat after "mostly peaceful prtests" and "2 weeks to slow the spread" and the extortion or cohersion for government mandated experimental boosters. Clearly meat seems to be worth it for humanity if those who want use weak or dead seek to destroy it.
how does lab grown meat fit in?
A sizeable portion of livestock food is actually made up of waste products from plant based human food production.
If I can't eat meat, just kill me. Then I'll really reduce my carbon footprint.

Soooooo an in between, keep eating whatever you want just stop eating beef
I have allergies to the most common animal based foods, such as milk, eggs, any sea meat, and even beef. I have tried vegan replacements for some stuff, but I either really hated it, or felt it wasn't anything special (with the exception of vegan cupcakes, they rock). I've lived with these allergies my whole life and I never once felt left out or like I had limited options. I've only ever mentioned my allergies when it was relevant, or when I wanted an ice breaker that shocked people with how much stuff they eat that I can't. I'm not 100% vegan, I have chicken since it seems to be the one thing I can eat that basically every takeout place offers. Although I have allergies I'm also picky with food, and I have still managed to completely change my diet in order to avoid unhealthy foods like potato chips or sugary candy. So when I see videos like these, I struggle to imagine why people resist to simply the idea of eating similar things to what I have daily for my entire life. My food life is by no means a bad one, nor is it difficult. I highly recommend just looking for foods that don't have any of the animal products I'm allergic to in them, they are a lot more common than you may originally think.  Let me know if you would like me to list or explain what I eat and where I eat or anything related to what I eat.   Have a good day!
Deforestation in the Amazon rainforest is primarily for its timber and other resources, and is often illegal.  Livestock producers and farmers are legally obliged to protect a large area of ​​their land or, if that is not possible, they have to finance a protected area.  Unfortunately, the current government is being very ineffective in monitoring and combating illegal deforestation.
Oh okay...   *Continue eating beef rendang.
In reality I don't think eating meat can be stopped but I think it can be reduced
TEAM MEAT EVRY DAY!!! (except Sunday, then I eat fish)
In reality I don't think eating meat can be stopped but I think it can be reduced
dang 2mil views in 1 day
i watch this very good happy meat farm video. bless them <3 and this video were recommended
Can't we just grow animal parts from vine like tomatoes yet? I honestly don't care about it being gmo.
enough about food, more about existential crisis with the universe
"For example if we ship 1 kg of avocadoes from South America" Me for some reason: Avocadoes from Mexcio!
⚠️Are you afraid to die? ⚠️  Read this carefully ;   Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers ... Yet this is only four of our many transgressions .  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth .  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love; so 2000 years ago, he left his throne in heaven, and came to earth as a man named Jesus Christ. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross. In doing so, his blood was shed to wash us clean of our transgressions . Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’ .. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace ..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response ;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and your Savior. ( Romans 10:9 ) .   Do this, and you will be saved .  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife .  You’ve been informed ; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you will be for ETERNITY.. Meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make .  Jesus Christ awaits you this very moment. Do not put off surrendering your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed... and as it is written ( Hebrews 9 : 27 ) ;  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’ .
You've got me thinking about going vegetarian.
Wow geez it's like an actual omnivore diet that we evolved for might be the answer to our problems
l love meet，noone can stop me。
To live is to oppose nature.
You neglected to mention how tiny human carbon emissions are compared to natural carbon emissions. With all the carbon sequestration projects potentially about to pop up this video is moot. Stop pushing half of the facts as usual.
Well put informative video about the realities of the animal agriculture industry. The future is plant based!
Is this channel trying to force an agenda? Politicise food?
Obviously we need to move cattle and any related production onto O'neil cylinder plants in orbit
YES
Oh no! Cows create carbon emissions! It's called breathing... Vegans are funny. As long as cows are alive they emit greenhouse gasses. They claim to love animals, but want to kill them all.
I feel like the reasonable issue people have with this is that it places the responsibility on regular people, when climate change could be completely combatted if the big companies who control things like food production actually cared to.
Only way I'll stop eating meat is if I was dead, 'nuff said... :P
Vsco girls disliked this videos 😂😂😂
I would so buy that sweater in this video!!!!!   Even at $100. Lol
Uhhh ever heard of sex or masturbation?
#3 on trending.. you guys have really done it! Thanks for another amazing upload.
Yeah, I'd be fine reducing the amount of beef consumed. Honestly plant based burgers taste fine and the only reason I don't order them is because they cost extra.
Only way to stop it is to go childless.
More people should watch this videos, super informative and entertaining at the same time
Hear me out, what if you had a dome covering the cattle with an influx of O2 to keep grass and cattle alive? Then you can harvest the methane produced from said cattle and use it as a renewable fuel source. It's a long shot, but imagine the implications and removal of our carbon footprint from it.
There is always a flaw in the datasets like these which benefit from ideologically driven misinterpretation.
Organic Video: Buy local seasonal. This video: Local is sometimes less efficient than something shipped across the world.  ... well then...........
Dear kurzgesagt thanks for the video. Do you know how many grams of beef humanity could eat a week if we switch over 100% of our beef production to the lowest c02 producing grass fed beef? And did you consider the affect of humanity being more efficient with our beef by consuming the whole animal. Thank you for the video I recommended atlas pros video on Pleistocene park he also has some insights you may not have known
Stop buying mass manufactured products is actually more environmentally friendly than stop eating meat, and beef, pork and chicken aren’t the only meat products you can eat, also fishes. A lot of nutrients are not sufficient if you only have access to vegan diet which requires you to consume supplements, and most of the people worldwide can not afford such life style. It’s just hypocritical to judge everyone who consume meat products.
too many people is the problem cause all problems. no people no problems.
Every time you guys post makes my day better
idk meat is pretty good
Topic ao toxic, even Kurzgesagt doesn't want to reach conclusions
Watch earthling ed
/Unconcerned, Meat is life.
I have done my research.  People who claim that anthropogenic CO2 is not causing apocalyptic climate change are routinely censored.
We need global warming. We are about to enter a mini ice age these next decades.
I'm somewhat of a picky eater but food is food. As they say hunger makes the best spice. But as long as it tastes good and doesn't hurt/kill me in any way, shape, or form I will eat it. But I definitely prefer burgers, pizza, and doughnuts, oh and spaghetti too.
A few oversights: 1. Human settlement has driven away large herbivores, which has somewhat recently been discovered to be to blame for desertification in some areas. Proper use of cattle herds can fill the ecological niche while producing food. 2. Using cover crops in farming can reduce tillage (improving carbon sequestration in the soil. Grasses are actually better for this than trees.), and can reduce need for mineral fertilizers. To break down the plant matter for seeding the following year, we can use the digestive tracts of large herbivores. 3. Livestock feed uses up the vast majority of our waste agricultural products. A few examples: crushing canola to produce vegetable oil leaves a mealy byproduct, which is fed to livestock. Wheat not suitable for human consumption is referred to as 'feed wheat'; three guesses why, and the first two don't count. A large amount of potatoes and other vegetables aren't suitable for a supermarket or making fries, and they're commonly fed to livestock.  My source: I grew up on a farm, studied agronomy in college, and continue to talk to people in the field of agroecology.
this isn't even talkng about how other animals have feelings. like how pigs are a smart and sometimes smarter than dogs
i dont like how if vegan teacher will review this video
People don’t realize that cows won’t be just cleared away like crop. You would still have those cows living and releasing the methane unless you cull the population. And if you dont do anything about it their corpses if not eaten will release even more pollution into the air. Nobody ever really talks about what would be done with the livestock after
Vegan forever, I’m doing my duty since I’ve not inherited anything from ancestors but I’m borrowing the planet from future generations.
We live in a world of abundance, not scarcity. We are coming into the grand solar minimum, ushered and by the Sleeping Sun, not Climate Change, and fertilizer prices are off the charts so the farmers are having trouble keeping up with the demand, which is financal, not weather or environmental driven.  So you guys are a cute cartoon, but you've gone off the rails. Just my opinion I nobody and it's my first time on this channel. So don't freak out, but you're wrong. Hamburger rules. 🍔 Bread is worse than beef.
"You can decide for yourself what to do with that information" yes, and if you don't go vegan after this video then you're deciding to contribute to irreversible climate change. Just do it already.
So, the thing that I am taking away from this is that it’s not meat in general that is causing this, but how we produce it. As explained, to support our diet, we get rid of helpful, carbon storing trees. Our problem is not entirely that we are farming, but what we are farming too. We have been conditioned to think that we should live off a narrow diet of certain foods; beef, pork, poultry, corn and wheat, to name a few. But humans can eat pretty much anything, including some of the more taboo and exotic foods, such as crickets, seeds (who knew you could eat an acorn), leaves, and certainly even rodents. Heck, you can eat deer, rabbit and even duck. You could probably even eat lions, jackals, coyotes, foxes, eagles, bears, lizards, and maybe even some snakes. Basically, humans evolved to not be fussy eaters. So it is kind of an anomaly that we have limited our diet so much in the past decades.
I'll just eat fish then
Giving up meat may not make you live longer.. it will just feel longer.    Ill take my beef thanks.
This video: exists  the vegan teacher :whomst has summoned the almighty one
First. people waste food in the first world like they waste precious time staring at their phones (i include myself in these peoples). Second most dont understand where their food comes from. Third, stop calling them factory farms, they are called feedlots in at least every place ive been to.
Basically, if you want to help the environment and you want to keep eating meat, try to change beef for chicken or fish meaby. And eat that in few amount.
Mum was an accountant in an abattoir (in Australia) and reckons that not much would change about animal farming if we stopped or reduced the our meating (meat-eating). She gives me the impression that the non food products we get from meat (e.g. leather, latex I think, maybe medical ingredients) make up majority of the reason the cow must be farmed. How much of animal farming goes to non food products? What are the impacts of reducing meat consumption if non-food product's play a big role animal farming?  Alot of my debate with anyone about this topic has been based on information from Kurzgesagt videos and I've yet to see much about this factor come up in any videos here or any media.  (I am about to look into it thought I'd bring my thoughts here first)
Just move to a communist country where you eat bugs.
Those who are wondering there are 4.9k dislikes !
Also 1 question is the soy grown exclusively for animals or did you mean that that percent of the soy plant is fed to animals.
So you are saying that even if we cut all CO2 emissions except for foods by 2100 we'll still reach the ceiling for carbon emissions... We are done as a species
As an Indian it feels so weird seeing foreigners struggling to give up beef, a thing you haven't ever seen 😂😂😂
The problem isn't with cattel it's with the system itself. Most rangelands have adapted with grazers with similar preferences to cattel like buffalo for millions of years, both animals prefering grass instead of brushes and Forbes which is most commonly preferred by smaller rumminants. Most grasslands in North America and throughout the world are actually highly productive in carbon sequestration and most of the time it is very unproductive to turn it into cropland. Methane produced by rumminant animals is typically produced in feed lots not on native rangelands. Please don't have a problem with the meat itself and rangelands instead take issue with the large feed lots. Just because a empty grassland or wetland isn't growing your vegetables don't take issue with it. I do understand that the world population is growing and no solution is written in stone and we must use adaptive management. If you want to combat climate change through your diet buy locally from nearby ranches before cattel are sent to a feed lot or, teach yourself to hunt and fish.
Hey, what about printing meat with mother cells? Is that possible or massively rentable?
Why nobody talks about greenhouse gas emissions
0:00 Sleep has entered the chat
Hey Kurzgezagt and team! This is selfish, ik but could you make a video about moss, the best plant against climate change  i hope this reaches you and many people get to know abt it
I’ve reduced my beef intake to about 1.5 meals a week, lamb about once a month, chicken and pork twice a week and the rest is all plant based. So a reduction meat from 7 x a week to 3.75 x a week. Not bad I think, it’s a journey…….
Wow this video came out at my birthday!!
So far, world is working best with balance
To have any chance of surviving we must go vegan
Oof
But if I purchase local fruit and veg as well, doesn't this count. I rarely purchase any food made outside of aus
meh. I'm not a herbivore so I'll stick to my omnivorous meals thanks. And it's mostly westerners who are eating vast amounts of meat anyway. The rest of the world eats way more veg than meat. Most of the meals I had growing up were lots of veg, little bit of meat.
I know you can't cover everything in a short video, but it seems like the things you choose to leave out/leave ambiguous point towards a certain bias.   For instance, you point out the massive impact of locally transporting beef vs international shipping of agricultural, but I can't remember the last time I bought an avocado from a shipping port, so it seems like you would need to account for local transportation regardless rendering the point moot.  But maybe there's more context you weren't able to fit, seems like a large oversight though given it was used to prove a point
Why don't we just mix meat and veggies together to make a hybrid burger? Edit: In the patty
Imagine growing in a jail just to be butchered at last.
no, meat is not bad, else Allah had forbidden it, Allah only has forbidden swine, bloody meat and corpses eaten/bitten by predators  and you know, other unhealthy stuff
Bill Gates Propaganda channel ✊🏻👍🏻
the amount of carbon being put back on the soil is not being accounted for in your grass-fed beef calculations. Really, you guys need to read about regenerative agriculture
Something that should be considered is that there are twice as many people as there were just 40 years ago, 3 times as many as 70 years ago. The idylic grasslands of pre-Columbus America with ample herds of buffalo was dealing with at most 20 times less people to feed worldwide. The long and short is that there are too many mouths to feed meat constantly.
ok but liek, cow yummy, and just burn the methane as soon as it leaves the cow.  boom, problem solved
Veggie patties are actually really good. Not the same as beef, but good in a different way. Also, products designed to taste like beef are becoming more and more hard to differentiate (I promise I’m not a vegan or vegetarian, these things are actually good)
My parents, grandparents and grandgrandparents only ate meat on Sundays and holidays. Meat was a luxury that was kept for special occasions. Their reasoning was probably - Is it better to kill a cow or to milk it? So my opinion is that not everyone needs to be a vegetarian/vegan they just need to cut back on meat consumption. That would be a death of fast food industry like McDonalds and jobs that go with that industry, so it's not a perfect solution. But all solutions have pros and cons, and saving us (not the planet, planet will be fine anyway) should be a priority.
When they can invent a vegan food that actually tastes good, then I'll switch over. Until then I"m going to have to stick with meat.
How about cows wih catalytic converter?
What is up with the graph at 9:24 - 9:36!? Kurzgesagt is showing the amount of CO2 that could be removed per _100 years_ by following a vegan diet and reforesting the returned land (800 billion tons per century, aka *8 billion per year)* while showing the amount of CO2 we pump out _per year_ (50 billion tons per year). This gives the false impression that these 3 billion hectares would be enough to cancel out *all of our CO2-equivalent emissions,* which is far from true according to your own data. Why would you show the values in this way if you were going for an unbiased and trustworthy video and not trying to manipulate the viewers into believing falsehoods? This severely undermines your credibility, Kurzgesagt, and honestly, I'm pretty disappointed with this video. I can't really trust all your other conclusions here with this manipulation of statistics.
Nevermind the 'invisible dislikes' controversy, what YouTube really needs is a button for "I like this video, but really wish I hadn't watched it so that I could have continued to convince myself that burgers weren't THAT bad, really, comparatively." >.<
lets be honest, no one is going vegan after watching this video just because of the vegan teacher
Is it possible to explain more about all the other meat products? Since the title is meat anyway not specifically targeting beef. Also, is it possible to investigate into all the countries around the globe other than just statistics from the US? So that we can have a better understanding. Thanks!
We will not be the first to fall or the last.
Let's face it, we need a more effective pandemic.
No thanks
I'm sorry but 100g of proteins from meat does not equal 100g of proteins from plants sources
Do an episode on paper bags and if it really more eco friendly than other bags.
Don't care. Nothing will make me not eat meat products. Humans are not fucking herbivores. Little sarah down the street eating fucking leaves and grass for the rest of her life isn't doing shit for anyone. I'm still going to eat what I enjoy.
Methane also breaks down into CO2 and H2O. So you still have the greenhouse gas problem.
Dislike
That is why rich people are putting out this propaganda. They will always eat beef, because they are rich and few. You will it bugs and be happy about it.
Eat meat! Cows aren't the problem. People aren't the problem.  Do the research.  People eat less meat today than 10 years ago. We have been warming globally since the last ice age. This video is propaganda. Think for yourself.
Disliked
0:03 arguably, yes, but I can think of one other thing that can happen multiple times a day that is Nirvana in the brain.
ok including the stonks meme got me
i am a vagetarian myself
This is too one sided and political, when did kurzgesagt become like this. Goodbye one of my favourite YT channel
"Is meat really that bad?" "Yes. But not really. But actually yes really."
transporting crops the same method as beef would mean they emit the same co2 levels, comparing a freight ship's emissions to a truck means i could stuff all that meat onto a ship to get less co2 and all the plants onto a truck for more co2  i get the logistics of "meat needs frozen when transported" but really, the numbers should be the same across the board
Tbh turning people to vegan is a great thing, but it’s not really something we should focus on right now since it would be systemic changes in our society. Last time there was a systemic change, it needed 2 world wars.
vegans are ahead of the curve
What the hell is ME-thane?!
is it really you feed cow with cereal? and not the agricultur waste? i just want to know the truth. is it wagyu cow? no seriously. i dont know how elite your cow is.
Let’s completely ignore the fact that that container ships produce emissions which are not from the carbon cycle, while most of the the emissions from animal production is part of the carbon cycle.
The planet's been around for a few billion years, and I might get a few decades. I'll stick with eating steaks and burgers, because I'm not sacrificing the few pleasures this mortal coil offers for the sake of a planet that doesn't care if I live or die.
Acts 16:30-31 “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” So they said, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.”
You say at 4:41 that transportation cost is 1kg of avocados 2.5kg and 1kg of beef 18kg. Do avocados not also do last mile transportation with trucks?
very good and informative
I didnt understand about the transportation part the thing between boats and trucks we dont buy are vegetables at the ship yard we buy them at the same store we buy meat so after the boat they go on trucks so transport i feel is a wash
You are the only creator, whose merchandise i would like to buy
0:39 Ok, im gonna be real, the way they animated that cow was cute as hell honestly
I love that the video leaves morals and ethic right outside the question. I think that's a personal decision like choosing a religion or a way of life, not a problem for humankind like the environmental facts and issues of overproduction.
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old” I can actually think of one believe it or not
i love yuuuuuuuuu
Cool, now just have to convince everyone in the world to eat bugs because it’s literally the best way to solve meat problems and global warming
2021 Nov 30
I have been in these place before.
Thank you so much for covering this!
meat is murder. tasty, tasty murder
So what you're saying is that we should capture the fart methane from all the factory cows we eat and use it to power things instead of being wasteful? I like that idea.
Huh, i think I wanna learn about how the Solar System formed
You should do a video about eating insects, and how that source of protein could affect global warming.
Gotta terraform a planet exclusively for cows, cow planet
7:40 Hexagon is munch munch better.
isn't the solution so much easier than forests or grasses as far as c02 capture and oxygen production? why not just culture cyano bacteria and algae? Most forests are carbon neutral which means that they don't recapture any more c02 than they produce. cyano bacterias  and algae are so much more efficient.
I actually hate food.   I hate the constant suffering if u dont eat regularly. I just want a pill i can take once a day and forget about it.  I hate food and i only wish to drink water.
Yeah I don’t really care about what science has to say in terms of climate change and food. Let that be somebody else’s problem if they want it to be, I have enough issues in my own life that I haven’t figured out yet, I don’t need to increase my work load.
I don't understand.Aren't cows gonna fart anyway either we it them or not?
While I agree with your points, I noticed that there weren't really any points that addressed pollution concerns from factory farms. Sure it may be more efficient land use, but the water and air pollution caused by it, the health and ecological detriments make it less appealing compared to pasture/"humane" animal agriculture.
I would love to have my own garden.
Awesome video though I did need to ponder and remember my own individual studies. Very fascinating. Thank you.
Oh and if you're so worried about a run away greenhouse emissions, perhaps you should stop letting so much god damn water into the air. CO2 isn't nearly half as bad as water. Actually water is 45 times worse than CO2, and a matter of fact, if you increased the CO2 emissions a thousandfold, you'd soon see, that CO2 would effectively stop further Greenhouse emissions, and actually cool down the planet, due to how plants waste water by draining the soil of it, each tree, produces 150kg of steam per day on average, that's equivalent of 6750 kg of CO2 per tree, or 6.75 Tonnes of CO2 in equivalence. So even if 3 hectares of trees would reduce CO2 by 800 Billion Tonnes, it will release a lot more water into the atmosphere. About 10000 times more.
i'm a big fan of eating meat, and I am definitely one of those people who pretty much consume one kind of Animal or Mammal during every meal. One i never killed myself, it came from a farm... and It's been getting harder to justify it as every year goes by... I remember that the best burrito that i ever had in my life was a Veggie Burrito in Tennessee once... and i try to use this as motivation. every so often, i shift to granola and yogurt for breakfast.... is that helping in this regard? i'm still eating Dairy. It's so confusing.
Okay. Yes 26% is bad, but why are we ignoring the 74% being caused by the top 100 companies, not blame normal people for climate change.
10:20 how does the sleeve go through the sewing machine??????
I think it would also be worthwhile talking about aquaculture since there so much of the ocean we can use and we can mitigate its impacts a lot more effectively
I was waiting for this one, I saw it on the German one but can’t speak german lol :
.
This topic is only heated because the assumption of climate change being as bad as it's purpoted is actually not true. The planet will be fine. Another marketing scheme.
Only the weak eat less meat
Let’s not get one thing twisted. This is an attempt to save the humans, not the planet. The planet doesn’t give a shit about what you eat.
The options to handle climate changes is you don’t get born
I want to see a part two of this with more information about food that comes from the ocean, rivers and lakes.
Add subtitle pls
YEEEES!!! NEW VIDEO!!!
3:49 Why would you stick with the biggest outlier as an example? It's understating what percentage of travel emissions represent the total emissions involved compared to most meats.  It's also mentioned that freight ships are highly efficient and avocado's are used as an example, but what happens when the avocado's arrive at their location on the ship? They don't magically teleport to the grocery store. Trucks still need to be used to transport the vegetable from the freight ship to the grocery store. The freight ship is one part of the story and it's disingenuous to go from freight ships for vegetables directly to trucks for meat transportation
After seeing all the effects of beef and other meat products i feel proud of being a vegetarian.
What about fish?
No one will ever convince me not to eat real bacon
Now do a video on how much water avocado needs to grow
Great video...👍😊
What if we could harvest some of these methane emissions somehow? It likely wouldn’t be easy, but given how energy dense methane is, it feels wasteful just letting all of it escape.  Also, I could definitely accept less beef/significantly more expensive beef if it meant being more sustainable, but to be frank, without government pressure on the industry itself, I don’t feel like it really helps for me to try and cut back. Frankly, this sort of thing is exactly what governments were made for: enforcing good changes that can’t be enacted by market forces alone
You could always feed chicken on worms, maggots, mushrooms and other useless stuff, Pigs are like humans, so you can feed them anything and they will survive, I'd go with Germans who make shitty infomercials for monetary gain, without considering the actual truth of the situation, and claim that they're talking about science. The supply wouldn't last long but we could toss in prisoners afterwards, and when that's done, communists.
1:25 guys let's just stop eating and a quarter of climate change is solved!
The objective of this video is marketing of american beef? Brazil is 60% preserved as God made. Don't believe me, look for what NASA says. Most of our agriculture is located at our former savanah (cerrado) area not amazon forest.
4:24 hoi4 naval sound????
Don’t really take into account how nutritionally poor plant shit is. Especially in the west the over abundance of carbs is reducing lifespans through degenerative diseases
Fooling people with statistics at 9:30. That 800B is over 100 years while that 50B is just over 1 year. So you should not show them like that. Demonizing non vegans
great video.  "we cut down forests for crops"... yeah to then feed them to farm animals.. (which was then mention at the "soy products" section anyways. ^_^)  the "worst beef" is like 99% of beef because... factory farming.
This video felt a little disingenuous, from using the worst of the worst of meat in order to portray its negative effects to the framing of statistics like in 9:22 that make it seem like freeing up land used for animal agriculture would singlehandedly solve climate change when in reality it won't. It's framed as 800 billion CO2 removed over 100 years and then the tiny 50 billion amount we produce per year when an accurate framing would show the 8 billion tons removed per year as a tiny fraction of what we'd need to offset our yearly emissions.
What about lab grown meat?
I still don't understand why this matters. If this was truly a crisis wouldn't the world leaders overreact even more than when covid jumped spieces. I'm mean if it was a priority wouldn't they all have come together to find a solution, sacrificing everyone they could to "save" the world.
Fuck youtube for removing dislike
Love ur voice! Make u sound like someone very smart
This video made me realize the truth. While the population of humans continue to rise. There is no turning this ship back.
The 3 armed birb hoodie was awesome
I'm surprised they didn't mention any other the developing solutions to livestock methane emissions like seaweed feed supplements or methane capture for biogas use. The asparagopsis taxiformis and armatus seaweed will cut cow methane by 80% at 1% of their diet and 98.9% at 2% with similar effects on sheep and goats. Personally, I've severely limited beef in my diet until I can get meat raised in either of these ways and I recommend others make substitutions until then as well. I'm also disappointed neither they nor anyone else ever does the climate diet footprint of non beef eaters along with standard western, veg, and vegan diets.
A bit of this video is misleading.  The Transport of goods happens whether it's plant-based foods or meats.  Even completely vegan foods still get that 'local journey' on trucks to the supermarkets.  That happens regardless of what food you eat.  The big Walmart Semi-Trucks, mostly Food.  Not just meat.  The rest is fairly accurate though.
I don't care how many articles and news reports they pay for; I'M NOT EATING THE FUCKING BUGS!  YOU CAN HAVE MY BEEF WHEN YOU PRY IT FROM MY COLD, DEAD HANDS! AND EVEN THEN, GOOD LUCK, BECAUSE I WILL HAVE GLUED IT TO MY COLD, DEAD HANDS!
the animation improved?
I live on a beef ranch. I believe it's a lot more environmentally friendly than people think. Grass fed cattle replace other species, such as bison, eating the grass that the bison ate when they roamed the country. This means the cows are no more of an environmental problem than the wild herds of bison in the parks, or the buffalo in Africa. (No one ever suggest wiping out wild bovines to end global warming.) The cattle are on grassland, which helps pull carbon from the air, so they'd actually be helping prevent global warming in a way, just like the bison before them. They also aren't impacting the wild animals here like farming. When people farm, they rip up the land and plant one crop, destroying the habitat for many wild animals. Cattle simply roam across the land, grazing the grass, leaving the other animals alone and able to go about their lives, lives that would be disrupted or even ended if the animals were living in a corn field during the harvest. It is true we do harvest hay for them to eat in the winter, but one must keep in mind that cattle can eat a lot more of any crop than humans. For example, if you grow a corn stalk for humans, humans can eat the kernels. The cow can eat all eight feet of the stalk. We can harvest three crops of hay off a field in one year, or we could harvest one crop of wheat for humans, and the humans would just eat the seeds. (The rest of the wheat plant would be used as straw for cattle.) This means that you can get WAY more food for a cow off a field than you can if you're trying to feed humans.  So in the end, I think that the calculations saying how bad beef is for the environment are way off, calculated by people who don't know enough about beef and how cattle are raised.
In summary: Yes, it is!!
The video quality is amazing.

Watching this while eating two burgers.
Carbon budget for 2100 depends on cutting World population to quarter what it is today.
I never bought the animal fart thing... if that did anything at all India, the haven of bovines, would be a scorched wasteland considering how long have they been worshipping cows and letting them do as they please.
what a if we  by meat at a higher cost because its made by  science
If we only grow meat on grasslands then maybe it should be rationed.
Cow fart= flooding the uk. Don’t see the problem
This right here is why the "Thanos could have just made more resources" argument is stupid. More people need more food, which uses more resources, which leads to more pollution and land use to sustain those resources.  Best way to lower the impact of climate change is simply to decrease the population
Thank you from the core of my heart 💛💛
We should start eating bugs, less water, less co2, less space, less resources. Doesn’t cost too much to raise them. Also apparently doesn’t taste that bad, just like “normal” meat but crunchy.
So, if you are vegan you save more land for forests but you eat more food?It is so confusing for me:(
Unfortunately people will still consume meat products and eventually make earth unfit to live by 2100. I loved this video but was sad to see that kurzgesagt couldn't talk about some topics as it's considered controversial, I mean people find facts controversial these days, this is just wrong. It's not an opinion being shared , it's facts , you can't argue your opinion is better than the real facts . You just gotta admit it and try to change your opinion. The fact is meat consumption is bad for the earth and switching to a vegetarian or better a vegan diet would really make changes .
Just eat fish lol
The problem is that eating more vegetables has been highjacked by religious extremists - the vegans - and pisses everyone else off that we can't have logical conversations.  Grateful for videos like this.
what about fish?
Non-meat eaters are amongst the most self-righteous people on the planet.
So... what choice will you make?
watching this while eating my fave porkchop recipe
If everyone was vegan, could we just survive alone with vegetables?
Live in the pod, wear the VR visor, eat the bugs.
Man, I'm excited for that lab grown meat.
staring at my bacon slices in fear now
What about fish and fish farms/aggressive fishing?
Ur videos should be played in world environment meets, our leaders should be educated by your videos
the cows are the problem, not us. what do you vegans think about this?
lets see give up meat... reduce carbon footprint save earth. but, not really, become a vegetarian, take vitamins and supplements, or have them added to the food in production, that destroys coral reefs, and destroys the rain forests and causes mass deforestation and droughts do to production alone, while still increasing the carbon footprint. well damned if you do damned if you don't. I'm going to keep eating both till we find a better solution.
I can live without beef. Just don't take my bacon.
Not to sound rude but links for this information? Nvm I just passed it.
People who think food is the best thing about being alive need some friends...
Can you go back to making videos about aliens and black holes?
Huh
9:32 Come on guys this is super misleading.  Your numbers may be accurate but you're making it seem like that 800 billion tons actually makes a dent in the 5,000 tons emitted within that 100 year period...
Have any Kurzgesagt staff stopped eating beef because of this research? I'm strongly considering it for myself after this. I can only imagine the stress on someone who was there with all the research in front of them!
I would like to know how the beef distribution percetages look like. How much can you buy at the store, and how much is given for companies to make beef-based products. I'm fine with losing Mcdonald's, Burger King, and all fast-food chains if it means I can still eat a stake every once in a while.
Kurzges funded by B Gaaateees who owns a fake meat company, that's not conflict of interest that should be disclosed?
So increase world hunger for 100 years to reduce CO2. Quite the trolley problem
I have about as much hope for humanity as I do for lemmings, I think I’m going to incarnate to an alien planet or alternate reality with less damaging actions required for survival. Hope here and now is kind of an excuse to do bad to other people, animals, or nature for a better life…
From a strictly environmental impact, you make very good points (phenomenal video, as always).  That being said, a large part that I feel was missed in the video was a discussion involving the nutritional requirements for humans.  For example, B12 is a vitamin that vegans have to take as an additional supplement, as it's not available in plant-based foods.  I'd be interested to hear what large scale production would entail on necessary vitamins and minerals, and what those long-term impacts would be if humans were to move to a plant-based diet.
I watched Life Where I'm From video about Japanese school lunch. They served what looks like 10 kg of meat to 630 children and staff, and that's like only twice a week at most. Nobody makes a fuss when the alternative is more appealing and delicious.
Then don't eat beef . Be happy with Chicken and pork .I guess atleast the beef thing is not an issue to be worried about in India.
I disliked this video but did not lose social credit. Thanks You Tube!
Forest meat sourced from remote tribe shall also help, in India we are providing that kind of approach by connecting tribes to the market's Supply chain.
Y
I wonder if this topic would be so controversial if meat didn't taste good. In the end, it all boils down to our taste pleasures.
We can also grow meat in a lab now.
Clearly whomever wrote the opening line has never had a libido.
I've been mostly vegetarian for 35 years. About two to maybe four times a year, I'll treat myself to a pound of bacon that I eat in about two sittings. It's the only meat I like and I basically burn it, so in theory I could probably get rid of it in my life
In India if you are a non-vegetarian you get to eat meat only once a week for only one time . We infact don't eat cows or pigs but only simple chicken and most indians don't even eat that . We eat only veg most of the time .
I think we need to invest into atmospheric possessor. Suck in air, remove the stuff we don't want in it, and put clean air back. Power it with mass solar.
Ok I understood nothing
I've been vegan for 4 years now. I'm at a point where my supermarket centric diet is frankly lacking, my belly aches for tastier food and I'm always tempted by animal products, but the evidence is just to overwhelming. If I hope that other people will take up their responsibility to change their lives, to be more sustainable and forward thinking, than I must do the same.
Can we harness beef methan?
Meat isn't bad for the environment. It's just part of all animal life. However, the meat INDUSTRY is the main problem. Letting massive corporations hack down forests to produce more meat that we'll ever need alongside tons of pollution, that's the problem. The moral concept of killing animals isn't that big of a deal compared to the horrors of the industry.  think of vegetarian/veganism as a boycott against it as well as a moral agreement.
What will I do with the information? Put it in the propaganda pile
What's 150 times less than... It's not a mathematically sound thing to say, 150×> What do you exactly mean, Do you mean 99.99[3333]...% less. Which I doubt. .5kg is not 150 times less than 81kg, it's 1/162nd as much. I hate it when idiots write a script.
16 thousand comments and only a handful actually visible. This channel's comment section is frighteningly curated
We get most of our semi essential and essential amino acids and fatty acid from non veg food
I normally like your videos, but I'll be disliking every video I watch until YouTube brings it back.
7:10 was pleasantly surprised to see Mongolia depicted
One of the things I really don’t like about these videos is they don’t offer a solution. They leave the individuals up to do whatever they feel, and the majority of us will just continue our normal diet. Why not offer reforms that could help with this?
NGL warmer climates would be nice. Every winter I am reminded how much I hate the cold. This is all big fear mongering. As long as humans have literally any activity we will be producing carbon. Unless we want to genocide 7 billion people and live in tribes again there is nothing we can do to reduce carbon. Global temperatures have increased by what? 1 degree Celsius? I don't really care. Everyone else can panic and eat soy burgers and stop taking shits to reduce their methane production, but personally I'm going to be chilling.
My body is not more information than any animals life.🙏🙏 proudly vegetarian
Eat as much meat as you want as long as you don’t shit out kids. Shitting out kids is the worse thing

yall MFs gonna have to eat bug meat while i eat the game that i hunted.
!
I don't take seriously anyone who talks about cutting back on meat without talking about people breeding like rabbits. Having one fewer child reduces your carbon footprint more than 40 people going vegan. If you really cared about the planet, you'd take more issue with people breeding and religiosity. No? Don't want to take on lack of access to family planning and reproductive justice? I'm gonna enjoy my steak with a clear conscience because y'all clearly don't care about the future of the planet.
this relies on the assumption that C02 /methane emissions cause global warming. Despite the lies perpetuated by ignorant or malicious democrats, this is not agreed upon science and the earths temperature fluctuates in cycles that are hundreds of years long.
Awesome 😎👍
In the end, it’s really just about the ethics of eating animals for me. I just don’t think you can justify taking the life of a sentient being just for a meal. The fact that our current system of animal agriculture is bad for the environment is just is a another reason to stop eating animal products.
proud to be a vegan 🌱
Who is here after Abhi @ Niyus Suggestions 😊
Anybody else notice that the gorilla was holding a cow?      No? Ok 😅😅
Just wanted to throw this out there, in the U.S beef industry as a whole is split up into a few different portions. Almost all (+-90%) of calves come from cow calf operations run by families be it private or contracted. Then when a calf gets weaned they are sold off to a either a feedlot or another cattle ranch to get them to roughly 600lbs. Then after that they go to a feedlot for about 3 to 5 months. To get to the point I feel the term factory farming is misleading as it's not a style of raising cattle from birth till death but more of a part of their lives that's nescisarry. Long story short every part of the beef industry takes pride in putting high quality food on the table for their families as well as yours.
Considering how some of the biggest issues to health are obesity/heart disease/diabetuz/hyperinsulinemia/metabolic syndrome witch all are probably related or the same thing at diffrent stages of progression, all related to high carb consumption and bad nutrition... , i had prediabetes and well first thing i did was eat alot of clean vegetables, only made it worse, even after reversing it and having normal blood sugar, i still cant eat to many carbs as i still get higher insulin, after losing a lot more weight and becoming very insulin sensitive i can probably increase my carbs even more, but even so if meat/dairy products were reduced by 50% or 50% more expensive i would probably die out before 50, some people seem to have no issue with eating alot of carbs this seems to apply to processed carbs as well, despite having a higher glycemic load, meanwhile it seems i screwed up my health since i was a teen and didnt know, as i have a low threshold for carbs, i just never realized all those almost daily migraines were mostly due to overeating carbs :(, but who knows maybe if i get my body extremely lean and insulin sensitivity very high i can eat carbs and be healthy i just dont know. This is just my guess, but if meat/dairy were to become 50% less available or even 50% more expensive, disease would raise up drasticaly
Imagine a future in which vegetarianism becomes mandatory. People would look back at us kinda the same way we look back at slave owners from centuries ago. Makes me feel embarrassed in advance
A video well crafted, well narrated, well animated, all in a freaking masquerade, working on actual disinformation. Such potential, such waste.
Yeah i'm a meat lover and?
800/100=8 per year 50 tons per year
I just want to become a fat bird they're so cute. Stop blaming me.
I would have loved to hear about how lab grown beef compares and how viable it is to replacing cattle.
What school are doing?
I love these videos
Some one send this to The Vegan Teacher
EAT THE BUGS, LIVE IN THE POD
Kurgesagt, honestly I’m seriously think that every single time you guys upload I say this but you guys have done it again!!! Honestly me personally, I am loving this series on climate change as it is one of my personally favorite topics because not just because of the science behind it but also what effect it has on our day to day lives, it’s a very serious issue with many solutions, but one thing is for certain, no matter what political side you are on, meat production plays a big role in climate change and just like any other industry that contributes to climate change, we must take it seriously otherwise, we might not make it though the years. Anyway, this video was awesome and keep up the absolutely amazing work!! Also if you did read this, thank you for reading, and same goes to anyone else who read this comment. Thank you for reading.
Before feeding all the starving peoples on the planet: *"We need to make more food!"* After feeding all the starving peoples on the planet: *"Food is destroying the planet!"* Solution: Stop feeding all the starving people. The problem will work itself out.
Regardic caloric efficiency. It greatly depends on the meat. Fish farms and factory-farmer chicken are very very energy efficient at converting animal food into human food. Both well over 50%. On the other end of the scale, cows are 10% and many other animals are below that.  Fish farms also have some nice niche partitioning going on that synergizes well with humans. They have very low land use and we either have difficulty farming or straight up can't eat many of the primary producers in a fish's environment. Fish can also be sent out from rivers to graze or hunt in the ocean and unlike cattle, they will reliably return home, meaning you can effectively have a fish ranch 75% the size of the planet.
This is all too complicated, I’ll just stop eating
school shooting where is Rittenhouse?
Me not eating meat isn't going to do anything. Just like you said in one of your previous videos, individual carbon footprint is corporate propaganda. I like meat, humans didn't evolve to be herbivores, I'm eating meat, everyone who wants to feel nice going vegan can enjoy their kale and soy.
Factory farming is literally not that bad
what about fish and seafood?
Stop breeding humans.
Eating meat is fine, its absolutely sustainable, anyone who tells you differently is as delusional as an anti vaxer anti gmo or anti nuclear power. Hating meat is unscientific, it's just hippie fairy tale nonsense.  That said, everything in moderation. Too much bacon will absolutely block your heart just as too much all vegan organic non gmo pure sugar will give you diabetes. Ecologically too; pasture lands can't grow human edible crops and human crops are much less efficient at nutrition
So, we just plant a shit ton of trees and plants then?
EVERYOKE SHUT UP KURZGESAGT JUST UPLOADED
Pd: No matter what we do, Earth is still gonna turn on venus
Another question to ask in regard to point 1 is this: is the "best beef" sustainable? It's cool that some beef is way less pollutant than others, but can it be sustained? I really think that needs to be explored if the video is going to introduce the idea of beef being low in its emissions.
This sounds like a 21 century version of malthusian theory
The only thing that would keep me from eating meat is if it literally killed me.
It’s bad if you over cook it.
I'm wondering how those emissions would change if we manage to make lab/vat grown meat viable. If you could grow the equivalent of a herd of cows in the area of say a football field, without all the methane emissions and the need for all that food and water it would be a seriously positive impact on the environment without people having to change too much or give up things. Which, let's be honest, most people are bad at.
cute
nice video, but you need to include the nutritional facts of meat-based vs plant-based diets in order to completely address the entire argument, not just the climate effects
Where do your stats data comes from exactly ? conducting such research sure i expensive, are you backed up financially by governments or any investors to create those videos ? thanks for answering !
Ecoterrorimo = Brazil
Anyways.  Im not stopping eat carbon lol
A kilogram of potatoes makes up my very lifeblood.
Not a word mentioned about other pollutions made by huge sea crafts that are used to deliver us the fruits and vegetables from far away places. 15 biggest ships cough out more nitrogen and sulfur than all the cars in the world. Sometimes it seems there are no longer other pollutants than the ones affecting our climate. Damn those chemicals for not being media sexy.
This video didn’t even get to animal welfare, personal health, public health, or workers rights concerns and still managed to spend 12 minutes continuously tearing apart the meat industry
i love meat, it has always been my favourite food though I am glad i stopped eating it in 2012. I couldn't justify it given the impact it had on the planet
Yes meat is bad for you
y not just use fish to replace beef or meat? I mean its basically meat but from the sea right?
Luffy ate lots of meat and became stronger Meat is good
Kurzgesagt:"could the title be any more longer? " Chandler bing: sarcasm 101
Earth is the worst place to live that I know of. All the people I hate live on it, and it's constantly trying to kill me.
went from vegan 6 yrs to non veg in 1 month, had harveys double burger deal $6
I'm so glad I didn't have to argue against the findings in this video.  I've been a vegetarian for 30 years now, and more often eat vegan. I've had learned the main points this video brings up many years ago, although for me, it's about respecting life, not carbon emissions.  I did find the emission segment informative, though, and there were some things I learned on that topic.
So much amazing work goes into these
When we address the real issue, just too many people. Imagine a world of,say, one billion reasonably environmentally aware humans🤔
Hi
Okay you lost me when you forgot to mention that crops are not all if not most not human grade. Where these crops are re fed to animals because imagine millions of tonnes of rotting grains in land fills and causing toxic run off
Meat is absolutely freaking GAS! I am never going to stop eating meat no matter what anyone say. I'm sorry vegans.
Our great grandkids are fucked huh?
This video made me wanna go n get some tasty McDonalds oh yeah! 😋🍔❣️
Howdy Kurzgesagt! I've learned so much over the years with your videos. I'm hoping you could clarify something that this video seemed to miss. I feel like beef is eaten predominantly in western cultures whereas rice and fish are more prevalent in eastern cultures. What impact do they have on the environment? Perhaps moving to a fish based diet instead of a grazing animal based diet could deliver a more compromised medium than moving strictly to plant based. Thanks so much! Can't wait to learn more in the future
Just because 11bil ppl can fit on earth doesn't mean it can sustain us. It's time for the WORLD to focus on space colonization. Even if we find a miracle cure it's only going to delay inevitablilties
This channel is OUT OF IDEAS💡
I will continue to eat meat
I'm glad we worship Cows in India and not eat them
The only real issue with a vegan diet (that I can really think of) is that we are meant to eat meat and plants due to evolution.  In other words, unless i am wrong (very likely), we got screwed by evolution
WEF starting to push others towards a repulsive vegan agenda whilst they dine on delicious Wagyu.
so what would we do to all the cows if everyone went beef free? Just slaughter all of them? It's not like they stop existing and shitting when we stop eating them.
The big elephant in the room is overproduction.   Over time, overproduction lower prices, so demand rises. Not the other way.  Meat is supposed to be expensive, and not for everyday.   Ideally you could use one cow to feed a family for a large amount of time. But cattle seems to be at the center of the industry, not only food. Cows and oil to be fair.   Everything that is overproduced will harm the enviroment in a way.
I was looking forward to explanation about health effects. Why do my muscles recover so much faster after going vegan? Will I lose this benefit if I start eating cultured meat? I really miss the taste of meat and it seems cultured meat is around the corner. But I definitely won’t eat it if it’ll affect recovery times
Have you seen a vegan, Hanz? Let alone talk to em? Not exactly health stable people.
Speaking of carbon footprints, you guys should do a video on Pleistocene Park! They are trying to bring back the mammoth steppe to counter the global greenhouse gases!
Everyone want change, but no one wants to change. Be the change.
I'm disappointed that this video was ignorant about regenerative agricultural capabilities in multiple spots
I have been thinking about cutting down on meats ...but im not sure if i could cut it out entirely...but it more becuase i dont like how hows and some farms treat the animal's....the industrial meat industry is just....soo abusive
When corporations and governments actually tackle climate change then i will
Beef is too accessible
The beef stonks reminded me to like the video
TLDR: Yes
I WILL NOT EAT THE BUGS
Can you guys cover changing our diet to bugs?
Yo I don't care if my meat is made of plants if it tastes good and keeps me fed I'll eat it
Wow: 23 days and you didn't address any of the inaccuracies in this video from the German version to the English one.   Let's start with soy: this has got to be the most irritating of all the claims made by people who advocate against eating meat because it's technically true! But even so, this is still an obfuscation of the facts.  Yes, 77% of the soy that's grown is used to feed animals. However the majority of all the soy grown is defatted soy. This means the beans have had the fats extracted from this to make things like vegetable oils which the majority are used for cooking and making soy oil foodstuffs, while the remainder is used by industry to make almost everything you can think of from paint additives to medicines to plastics.   Prior to the 1940s almost no Soy was grown for animal feed as corn was the staple crop fed to livestock. The reason for this switch has to do with the discoveries of the Industrial Chemist, Dr. Percy Julian, who created HUNDREDS of discoveries with the soy bean and it's oil in the back room of a paint company over a period of 20 years.   Now, take a wild guess what percentage of the soy bean is oil. 80%? 65%? 40%? Nope.   It's 21% - 23% ~ Exactly the amount that's extracted and used for human food and industry. I will say it again and again and again because it's true; The Soy that is Fed to Cattle is WASTE ~ Unusable by anyone for anything except as landfill, which when it then decays produces the same green house gases of Methane and Carbon dioxide people are screaming about.   This brings me to point 2) Climate change - Yes, Food contributes to our climate changing. However the source of that Carbon is what makes the difference. I can prove this easily:  We raised Billions of Cows, Pigs, Chickens, Goats, Sheep and every other kind of meat you can think of since the beginning of human civilization. Probably earlier since the cow, in it's most rudimentary form has been domesticated for 12 500 years.   I want you to consider that: Billions of cows over thousands of years never affected the climate. We know this because of ice core samples taken from Antarctica: They capture bubbles of air which we can use to recreate the ancient atmosphere, and for the entirety of human civilization, we see a flat line: 1% increases up and down in atmospheric carbon composition but no major change until the 18th century.   In fact, I can tell you the day that climate change started: May 4th, 1776: James Watts and Iron Mad Wilkinson kick off the industrial revolution. Suddenly, there's a massive industrial demand for fuel, and this dense, energy rich rock called Coal suddenly goes from something used to help heat homes for part of the year, to a massive industrial resource necessary for the large scale manufacture of commercial goods for an ever growing market.   The Ice Core samples see the CO2 rate skyrocket, and the graph has been going vertical ever since.   So which is to blame? The system of food creation which has, for the past 12 and a half millennia created no discernable effect on the climate or the large scale industrial production that, like an unceasing forge continues to consume the world day and night?  The idea that any carbon creation as bad is a poor excuse to stop eating meat: that carbon came from the atmosphere, it wasn't taken out of the ground and thrown into the atmosphere where it will stay for the next million years. At best it's a canard to keep doing other things that pollute because you're offsetting it by not eating meat.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Point 3) Environmental degradation: This one annoys me to no end because it stands on the assumption that if we all just stopped eating meat, the attacks on the environment would suddenly stop because this is the only thing driving them. But its' not. It's more obfuscation.   Let's take the Brazilian rain forest as an example: It's been the government policy of Brazil to exploit the rainforest since 1956. Doesn't matter who's in power.   Moreover, the amount of beef that people eat has fallen sharply: the average US diet consumes a total of calories has shrank by half. In terms of grams per person it's decreased by a third from the 1970s from 150 grams to 101 grams. This is due partially to rising costs and falling wages, partially due to the rise of chicken and partially due to health and environmental concerns.   But lets say we all stopped eating meat tomorrow. I'm in a generous mood: The rainforest is still doomed. The reason for this is simple: it provides the Brazilian government with no capital or revenue and as such would still be slashed and burned or logged for timbre.   Brazil btw is in the correct tropical zone to grow things that are in high demand, such as Vanilla, and the amazon basin sits on heavy metal deposits as well. To put it simply ~ the rainforest would continue to be destroyed because the government that enables it's destruction sees no value from it. As such, unless preserving that forest is worth money to the Brazilian government no action can stop it from coming down short of a military invasion on behalf of the environment.   This is true in the other forest biomes that are just as important to our carbon capture and sink: The Siberian Boreal forest, which has contained  just as much carbon as the Rainforest, is currently being logged to meat softwood timbre demands with NO agricultural pressure on it: You cannot grow food in the arctic.   Borneo saw a 65% reduction in it's rain forest for the input of oil palms - that forest is just as dead, and it's carbon is just as much leaking into the atmosphere.   Madagascar cut their rainforest back by 95% to make room for vanilla cultivars.   In Costa Rica, 1/3rd of the rain forest was cut down for oil exploration and continues to be destroyed.   If you want to conserve the rainforest you have to make the rainforest worth more alive than dead. I can prove this easily by citing the case of the Mountain Gorillas:  Prior to their conservation, their habitat was being encroached upon by farmers looking to grow rice in order to increase their income. When the forests were conserved as gorilla habitat and the locals given a cut of the tourist and scientific dollars that flowed into the region, they stopped killing the Gorillas because now they were making more money keeping the environment for the gorillas than they would if they just converted it into farms.   Chopping down the forests for Quinoa isn't somehow a more noble pursuit because it's being done for trendy non-animal based foods. A dead rainforest is a dead rainforest it doesn't matter what you turned it into.   The pursuit of profits, not meat is what's destroying the environment and could be easily fixed.   As for the claim that if we removed all the land we used for animals and turned it into wild lands. Yes, it sounds nice - Except that 800 Billion Tons over 100 years is 8 Billion tons a year.    We Emit 50 Billion Tons per year at the moment: you are comparing two VERY different numbers.   Even if we removed ALL the foodstuffs and their greenhouse gases from the list, Humanity would still emit 37 Billion tons of CO2 per year, meaning your total mitigation would be slightly less than 20%.   It's an even less meaningful number compared to the total atmospheric carbon: 220,000,000,000,000 Tons or 220 Trillion Tons of Carbon Dioxide currently makes up the atmosphere at 0.04%. To get the atmosphere down to 0.03% we'd need to eliminate 15 Trillion Tons. All the Deserts and Farmlands turned into forests and pasturage would only eliminate less than 1 Trillion Tons in 100 years.   Conclusion; Meat isn't the problem - in fact it's a rather minor part of the problem at 15% of global emissions. The problem is extractive capitalism  externalizing the costs on our globe and everyone busy arguing about what' the best individual solution rather than just regulating the businesses and industries that got us to this problem in the first place.   If you really want to save the planet, you need to petition your government for mandatory emissions standards on industry to make them become more efficient - 4% increase in efficiency per year would have done the trick it in 1976.  You need retrofitting of homes, You need stronger environmental regulations that can't be challenged in courts, and most importantly of all you need to make conservation pay so the government at the local and national levels sit up and pay attention.   This has been a TED talk. Thank you.
In my opinon N A H. Not that bad
I eat meat everyday,i not kill poor plants they give O2
congrats on #13 ON TRENDING!
Luckily, there aren't that many fast food restaurant in my area. And i don't have that much money to spend on buying them, since they're still relatively expensive for me.  So, my main diet mostly involves, Loafs of Bread and Eggs
"It's the only bodily pleasure you can enjoy multiple times a day and never gets old"  Bruh you gotta "test fire the death star" a little more
Thank you for making my favorite phrase, 'Well, it's complicated.'
Not saying we should stop worrying about deforestation and conservation of trees and forests, but we should probably focus more on ocean, lakes and rivers etc, which contain a great deal of phytoplankton. Fyi, phytoplankton is the major O2 contributor to our atmostphere.  So, shouldn't we be focusing on making sure oceans don't get too acidic, etc and try to make way to create more phytoplankton that produced O2 growth? Forest do contribute O2 production but it consumes quite a good chunk of it back to release CO2 again anyways for other various functions.
how many videos are you gonna make on meat.
the problem is that our population has outgrown our world and we have not developed technologies advanced enough to leave Earth and spread humanity across the solar system
6:25 This part really makes you think about it a little more. But that's all I have to say.
You could have mention the 22 000 liters of water needed to produce 1 kg of beef.
Thankyou for using metric system of measurement.
Yeah, but you cant beat in during november. Every good thing has its thorn
Cool video, but 1. Eating animals is kinda required to have a healthy balance of omega-6 unsaturated fat to omega-3 2. While buying local may not have much of a carbon impact, it increases average disposable income in your country, meaning people have more money to buy things that are better for the environment. 3. Plant based protein can’t come anywhere close to eggs in terms of nutritional value without having unhealthy things in it.
EAT THE BUGS LIVE IN THE POD CONSUME THE PROPAGANDA.
fuck tofu.
awkward time say but I'm not worried about climate change. I might when they finally get a prediction correct.
months of wait for a video and never disappointed
such a good day, new video and a notification my books almost here
Thank you for educating people on this topic, I'm sure you guys are having a real impact on the matter.
Yes! It's just hard to decide how much animal products to cut out!
climate change is a fucking hoax.
Brought to you by 100 companies that are responsible for 71% of carbon emission and US military that emits higher than about 140 countries.
For the transport of food shipping generates less CO2 emissions but after arriving to the destination country it will be needed to use some trucks to arrive to different local distribution center and then to the supermarket so it will eventually generate less emissions the local food
What I want to do with this information is elect politicians who will fund research into vat grown meat.
-95% of humanity destroyed or -go vegan  goodbye humanity, easiest choice of my life
If food is the best thing about being alive kill me now.
Beef stonks
You got something enormously wrong still.  When you say that you feed cattles products, you actually feed them BYproducts of those products, things that would be again useless to us , it works like that unfarmable land you are talking about.  Any human that have came in contact with farm animals knows that , its common knowedge.  Take for example goats , they eat grass of any kind and when you wanna feed them even more you give them byproducts from crops/veggies , things that are unedible to us, also many farmers will feed them products that expired or are to be thrown away, meaning less food spoils (thats how animals that doesn't eat grass can be ergonomic)... its can't be that hard to wrap your mind around those simple facts... its the same principles as recycling, its that simple: if you can't eat it , farm animals can ,and you can eat their meat afterwards...  I'm not saying everyone does it that way , but its viable and actually cost less but needs more organizing.   If it became mandatory to work meat industry as a recycling indurstry for organic spoils its a win-win, I can't see the problem any more. As for the farts, we all fart, lets give animals a pass xD Lastly for anything that has to do with transportation thats simply an energy problem , not a product problem... and it needs its own solution as we all know already. Damn , dont get me wrong , i really like your channel , but lately your videos seems to be getting so blunt.  One thing is for sure, demonizing meat won't change anything, changing the system behind its production will bring the change that is needed and that will benefit us all. Even veggans.
Na fuck that. Ima eat meat all my life. Fuck that brainwashing shit
Yeah I’m still gonna eat beef and meat. Individual consumer choices can’t solve climate change only legislation and institutional change can do that. So I’ll eat my cheese burger at the climate protest.
YOU WILL EAT ZE BUGS
i used to be on a vegan diet for this past year, and it was honestly the most miserable and unfulfilling part of my day. It felt like less of a nice relaxing time to eat something, and more like a chore. I tried numerous vegan recipes to spice up my pallete but it still didn't amount to what I ate before then, not even by a fraction  like I just got hungry again in 15 minutes, I just went back to a regular diet with meat and I've improved mentally and physically. I no longer feel tired or get hungry right after eating. I honestly missed it so much
It may give us more life, but life would suck. No meat means you get less everything, meat gives us so meny protines and good fats
What is not mentioned is that cows can consume plant by-products.  Moreover, if the grass land is not inhabited by cattle, then it will be inhabited by wild animals which also produces methane because all animals fart. So one can argue that freeing up the grass land from cattle will not stop emissions of fart into the atmosphere. Overall, I find that these climate preachers are trying to demonize food which is just beyond ridiculous. It just goes to show the extra ordinary length activist would go in order to get things their way.
I’m hungry again
Warming isn't going to be fixed by reduction in beef or anything else really.   The political will to do so simply doesn't exist anywhere in the world and even if it did in some parts without everyone getting in on it, it becomes virtually useless.   By the time it becomes an emergency in most peoples minds it will be to late.  Fortunately we have technological solutions which can cool the planet.   The amount of grassland we need to grow food and use animals could be severely reduced by using greenhouses.   The main downside being the amount of power they consume.   We can basically put reflective objects between the sun and the earth to cool the planet.   These things don't require any new technology they just require money so while the climate crisis will be a problem it will not be as absolutely catastrophic as some are predicting.
Ok so farm grown animals are not the greatest solution. But what about sustainable hunting of say deer to replace normal meats in my diet? How would that change my carbon footprint impact?
It kind of sounds like we're fucked no matter what we do... But Hey man let's prolong be inevitable together ❤ 😌
Man… you almost convinced me into turning Vegan.       Almost.
You make me feel proud to be a vegan 🌱
Regardless of this video I still like bacon
It's bad until you eat too much, that's why western worlds are having this debate, unlike in Asia, as we don't eat as much :))))
Fun fact: Cheese is dairy crack-
I WONT EAT THE BUGS
Y'know I'm very surprised you didn't mention fish. Fish makes up a huge portion of the diet of highly populated countries. And we are on the absolute brink of the ocean ecosystem falling apart. Year by year we see less and less fish yields per offcatch( less fish per catch means cast more nets to catch more = more off catch). This should be mentioned in a video as broad as this.
Maybe we can modify cows genetically so they fart less. Or "help" natural selection on the consistent farming of the less farting cows over generations...
Proudly beef-free since 2016 when Leo DiCaprio brought this to our attention. I don’t enjoy it more than chicken by enough for me to justify the ecological impact. However if you enjoy beef that much more then hey you better be grateful I’m not competing with ya 🤷
Please look into fishing and fish farming!!
Meh, I will still eat meat everyday  'till I die..... because “Food is arguably the best thing about being alive”
I miss the hypothetical videos dealing with random stuff like blowing up the sun!!!
Not all cattle require burning down rainforest. That is a little dishonest. I'm still eating burgers.
Man, I love meat but the carbon impact is pretty significant per cow 🐄
I will never stop eating me because I’m told to.
Okay but why is no one talking about the meat stonks? Seeing a meme made me laugh but I'm called you guys showed the facts about this topic since everyone is just arguing about their opinions
Me: The over whelming majority of co2 emissions come from transportation, making ev's produces more co2 in the short-term than ice cars, batterrie production causes huge damage to the environment, what about carbon neutral fuel, how are we gonna charge millions of ev's when no one wants nuclear power renewables can't keep up and the grid is getting over loaded, we have no plan to recycle used batteries.      Everyone: It's the cows, The cows are the problem.
:) kruzgesagt's name never gets old needed copy lol
I enjoy the BIG MEAT. And I enjoy science. PERFECT!!!
mmm burmger
bruh the monkey is eating a toy of a buffalo in the intro
If reducing beef consumption means reducing climate change... I think I'll keep the beef
No meat is not that bad, the carbon emissions from the animals eating grass and releasing CO2 is offset by new grass growing. Also about land use, you can grow animals on land that is unsuitable for agriculture, either it is too hilly or too nutrient poor and only good for grass.
dear meat if u are reading this don't worry we still love u very much 😍
Doesent the methane from cows come from plants, witch get their co2 from the atmosphere? Or am I missing something? Greate video as always. It gave me a lot to think about.
this video hurts.
Wow I'm impressed you guys got the explanation right at 6:09.  Way too many people think cutting down forests is bad because they would have photosynthesized CO2 into O2.
what the fuck is a meat carrot
I think it would be better if they compared the CO2 emitted in in a hundred years to the CO2 removed in a hundred years from freeing up land. It was kind of confusing the way they put it in the video. But I guess emissions are constantly changing.
Hey, your dislike button is not showing the number of dislikes, you might have and issue here, I recommend contacting youtube and letting them know of this problem. /s
Everyone who reads this comment has to buy their book IMMUNE
I watched this while eating a big triple mac cheeseburger
Man i love this channel and love the voice of the narrator and thanks for the information❤
God i really wish the dislike button was still there. Just looking at the word "Dislike" next to the like button feels off.
Good video. I know that the video is kept short to keep things simple but I feel like there may be more metrics to use other than kilojoules of energy and protein to compare meat vs plants, just to give a fuller picture. For instance, amount of satiety per gram or comparing the typical amounts of meat people eat vs the amount of plants people eat and seeing the picture there in regards to carbon emissions. I would be interested in seeing such data!
Byren
The power of not showing dislike button's tally! Here we go meat lovers, Frock VEGANISM!!!
i've never met a happy vegan. that's why they will fail to convince the meat lovers.
Always absolutely love these videos... They break huge topics and controversies into simple morsels... I love that every single video you guys put up makes me pause the video every so often to think about what I believe the answer to be, before I keep going!
So you're saying we need to beat our meats?
Barely a nod to the cruelty involved makes it sound like the badness of meat is only environmental, not moral.
Of course it isn't bad. Only vegans say dumb things like that.
I don't think most people choose what they eat based on climate change. They make choices based on their health, dietary needs, taste, moral issues and price. Lets be frank, meat isn't going anywhere. If you want to reduce climate change best to look at other ways to tackle the issue. Imagine making a huge forest from the huge unlivable deserts in the middle of australia.  All that worthless land could, as the video mentions reduce the impact wildly more than what meat produces.   We are omnivores, meat isn't going anywhere.  Best to find practical solutions rather than try guilt trip people into things that will never happen.
My diet bounces between keto and Carnivore. I eat only meat half of the time.
Fuck it. Still gonna eat beef.
Very interesting and unfortunate, but I'm still eatin that Big Mac
Men’s basketball team is at the big wide world championships and the big wide world championships are the best for you having fun in your life at all and I love
Report: we got them trending what a W
I have the answer. We should just stop eating.
That's a very RISKY topic 😮
No one: Climant Change Extremist: WE MUST STOP EATING AT ONCE!!!
Tomorrow (futur) all meat are gonna be printed.
Short answer: we're still fucked up
I wolnt claim that anything other than the price increase due to the whole shipping thing is the reason, but I hardly eat beef anymore. I'm not opposed to it, and I know that it causes a lot of pollution, but that isn't why I stopped. Its just too expensive for me compared to chicken or turkey, and I dont mind having less burgers and steaks. I didn't really make those for myself before much. I havent had a veggie burger that is good enough to consider buying. I would rather just not have the disappointment. Maybe it makes a difference, but who is to say.
HI to everybody I love this channel I LIVE IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC✌️
They need to make a video about artificial meat... I'm interested to know how that compares, and how/if it could be scaled up to mostly replace meat.
I'm willing to switch off beef. And pork. Not poultry though.
I'd loved to have seen an inclusion of food quality to the metrics shown. The vegan arguments are very lacking in that area. Many vegans of 4+ years either have large nutrient deficiencies or are required to take a huge amount of supplements just to get close to the nutrients compared to meats.
You can tare the burger from my cold dead hands
What about instead of just considering grassfed, looking at the amount of food eaten by animals that is the inedible parts of human food like corn husks and food waste. I think that is something that may have been missed in the calculations for the video but I still don't think it would be enough to make the carbon footprint of meat go down a lot
so, invade Brazil Turn that country into a big forest and eat meat freely let's go (joke btw)
From all your environmental videos, the only conclusion I can come to is genocide. Even if we were to completely overhaul human society, it still won't be enough to halt the damage. To put it simply, there are far too many humans and we haven't "trimmed" the population in several decades. People need to stop having children for a while and hopefully covid kills many more people.
dont worry, once the new world order takes effect. you will be eating nothing but bugs and living in a lil tin can
0:04 HMMMMMMM I WONDER WHAT ELSE IS!!!!!
am here for the design not for topic. so dislike topic
Soy being planted in Amazon forest is a huge lie I am very disappointed you passed on
You can't use a cow factory for farming cus there's a cow factory in the way
Yeah but you're forgetting one important thing. If you cut out meat, that means you have to eat other things, largely vegetables. And those taste gross.
"Hmmm interesting.."  *takes another bite from burger*
What I am going to do with this information: eat chicken
Eating insects is a great option. Meal worms, locusts, crickets, etc. The only risk to my understanding is the farming method to control what insects eat (no pesticides and stuff) and cooking method cause bacteria and parasites. We REALLY should start eating insects.
funfact: 100% dead people had eaten vegetable and meat in their lives.
Me like meat
beef stonks is a phrase I can confidently say I never expected to see in a Kurzgesagt video
Tanake Kurzgesagt, Just wanted to offer some perspective since this video seems to be operating under some logical inconsistencies. Firstly, the framing of animal husbandry as antithetical to agriculture and/or 'ecological preservation' is of course silly and false. Large grazers are crucial parts of many habitats and many communities are exploring how to utilize meat animals in large-scale ecological restoration. One of the most devastating events in terms of ecological contributions to Atmospheric Carbon is the destruction of Great Plains habitat. This destruction didn't happen solely because of a desire of settlers to create cattle grazing land, but also because of the US policy of destruction of Native grazers (e.g. Bison). I've noticed that your videos that talk about humanity generally seem to adhere to the mythological and not-at-all objective believe in cultural evolution: "Humans hunted/gathered, Humans did agriculture, then Humans did industry and that's how we know progress has happened." Of course this idea gained traction and 'evidence' within the context of your and other Western country's fascination with finding an objective reason for the wholesale destruction of 'less-evolved' civilizations. I'd recommend, free of charge, that you take a moment before your next video and consider how Germany's own colonial history might lend itself to your presumption of cultural evolution. I think it'd be really edifying for your team. Anytime you're willing to listen, indigenous people are ready to educate.
Not to mention beef is loaded with cholesterol and saturated fats
Why don't we just cull humanity down to 300 million? Like the Georgia guidstones suggested?
Cows dont create methane out of nowhere and put it in the atmosphere. They simply take and give it back. Climate change is just another excuse politicians use to justify the need to rob more of our money and control our lives.
I've been on the carnivore diet for 3 years now. 2-4lbs of meat a day. Never felt better. No health issues. Blood work is fantastic. The reason for the increase of gases with animals is simply because of what they are feeding them. Cows and other animals that live on grass and herbs produce barely ANY gas.
This just highlights that using renewable energy overflow after storage for base load on the power grid, or even from any source when the power becomes excess, should be put into carbon sequestration or processing.
Eating meat is cool and not eating it means u gay son.
Too much is bad... too less is bad... Too perfect... is bad?
Ever wonder what vegan tastes like?
I feel like the conclusions to most of these videos is "It's complicated", and that is totally true and fair. However, it would be great every once in a while to then layout the complicated potential solutions afterward.
Rather be dead than give up meat Just bring Thanos out to snap his fingers problem solved dont see these billionaires doin anything to help climate change so why should the average person Get rid of cows yet its ok to fly millions of planes and send billionaires into space on rockets so they can have a good view of the earth
cows' farts are partially responsible for a global crisis, oh my god...
Also, and a big point left out in this video, as humans we no longer have the need to eat meat to survive. We can choose to not treat animals as objects and avoid the literal torture of other sentient beigns just to have 10 min of pleasure. We can still find pleasure without destroying our planet and our animal friends. It's really not that big of a deal, except for the meat and dairy industry lobby, of course.
Dislike
5:33 dont give people ideas
The video started by saying that the topic is complicated; the video shows that every single data asset we have highlighted that eating meat is terrible for you but especially for the habitability of our planet. Nothing complicated about it... Don't like the need for you guys trying so hard not to offend the die-hard meat-eaters watching ....
"Carbon budget" - excuse me? Humans are made of carbon.
PLEASE do a video on factory farming. The world needs to see how unspeakable it is.
While eating less meat is a noble goal, animals play a crucial role in the small farm permaculture cycle. They graze so I don't have to mow around fruit trees and clean up crop debris. They poop so I don't have to buy petrochemical fertilizers. Chickens are amazing as bug eaters, so I don't have to rely on pesticides.  There's a lot we need to do to turn agriculture around from current destructive practices, but getting rid of meat products entirely is not it.
4:55 Mongolia!
So the answer is yes, it is that bad… honestly, I can’t imagine going meat free unless I was forced to prepare the meat myself. But I love chicken and I like having burgers. At the same time though, if eating beef became impossible, I wouldn’t die… like I’d be totally fine. I actually don’t mind “vege meat.” I would miss meat, but I’d get over it. So why don’t I just go vegetarian?? That really is the question. I think the answer is because I don’t have to. Stores still sell meat and I like it, so I’m going to buy it. Food places mainly have meat options. There are A LOT of chicken, beef, and fish options out there and a lot of other meat options. None of those meat options is sustainable and we will run out eventually if we do nothing. But I mean there’s no immediate urgency, at least that’s what it feels like. This is why I think the impossible burger and other products like it are the way forward. If lab-grown meat becomes viable, then that would be great as well. I think we have a long way to go tbh. And I’ll be really surprised if any of these things catch on by 2050 or even 2100 for that matter unless things become catastrophic. Culture isn’t going to change that quickly without a massive boost from human suffering. I mean humans have been eating meat since the beginning of written history…. Do we honestly expect that to change that quickly unless there are massive consequences? Even if we have the tech?   I actually have no idea, and I wholeheartedly endorse people pursuing potential solutions to transitioning humans away from slaughter meat production. I mean we might not change with the technology but we definitely won’t without it.
The problem is, though, let's say we decide to go vegan. What do we do with the livestock? We can't just set them free. They'd become invasive species. So what do we do? Just kill them all and throw them into the ocean?
Summarizing: No matter what you choose, we will all die.
NOTHING WILL STOP ME FROM EATING BEEF! Sorry.
I don't eat beef. Not my choice. I'm poor.
Their videos always trend! I can see why, been a while since I’ve actually been curious in learning.
thanks for information i wont convert into vegan bcs by the time world ends i wont be arround anyway 😂 human lifespan is damn short
5:24 CONFIRMED: KURZGESAGT IS AGAINST FURRIES
Thank you for spreading important information in an easily digestible way. This is very helpful in considering my life choices.
i guess the vegans were right
Haha stonk meme
Or we can just let thanos snap his damn finger.
I'm really curious about insects as a protein food source.  It seems quite efficient and more ethical as insects are evolutionarily designed to mature quickly, are probably easier to accommodate ethically (depending on the species that is) and can potentially eat plant waste that humans cannot eat. I imagine trying to get people to eat insects is kind of difficult in some countries though given the stigma.
I watched this while eating a dinner of leftover restaurant peanut-ginger-beef-rice-dish and home prepared tossed salad.
Yum, Meat!
9:52 I thought it was Inosuke!!! 😹
Your body produces a cancer cell from time to time but your body always kills it so you can get cancer at any moment
Yes but food isn't so simple. All calories and protiens are not same. Nor the vitamins. It absolutely matter where you get them from.
"No other bodily function is enjoyed multiple times everyday and never gets old." It's the last day of NNN.
do you know what is prion
y'all do realize that all that carbon from livestock respiration ad flatulence invartiably came out of the atmosphere within the last 12-24 months, right? Sure deforestation is a different matter, however.
I would love to see a video on regenerative practices agriculture. Eg using crops in combination with animals, reforesting to improve drought resistance, no till cropping. I also think it would be great to talk about the role of monoculture cropping advantages and disadvantages and on that subject the role of inputs for growing crops like phosphate fertilizers
Further question-since I've seen some controversial numbers about the emissions of certain veggie patties-are fake meat veggie products more efficient? Less efficient (probably not, but I'm still skeptical about the positive net of these pseudo-industrial products)? I'd assume there would be pros and cons due to different business models and production scale, so have y'all got projections for those?
And cue the big beef spam trolls
If all goverment all over the world focus on spending money on solving problem rather than stupid military doomsday weapon ! We probably make use of all this emission into our advatage instead of a prroblem!
I believe a good solution to the greenhouse issue, would be to stop farming cattle, sheep, pigs, poultry etc and start farming insects to eat instead. However I believe the modern world has made most people to soft to make such a radical dietary change :/
You love to mispronounce words. methane is literally "meh-thane" not "mee-thane". How the hell do you say controversy incorrectly also? Can you say controversial in that same manner? Lmao
Basically just start by lowering your beef consumption
Meat needs to return to being a delicacy or completely removed from as many peoples diets as possible. Thats my warm take lol
Video suggestion: "What alcohol does to your body and mind".  After 3.5+ years sober I can promise that it does a lot!
science is kinda not effective for this topic as meat industries are notorious for paying for fake studies for their own sake
How can you title the video "Is Meat Really that Bad?" and not really tackle the ethical concerns with the torture and slaughter or animals? I would understand if the video were "Is Meat Really that Bad for Climate Change?" but that isn't the title of the video. Could have also touched on health concerns.
Just telling me more or less what I've known since I was 16 when I went vegetarian. It's just so much better for my health and the planet, and poor, smelly, stupid cows don't have to die to support my diet. Neither do pigs, chickens, lambs, etc. Although it would be interesting to know if I personally don't buy any meat from the store, if that really has any perceptible impact on the industry at large *producing* it anyway. Food for thought indeed.
The human species will see karma in action over the next few decades.
Some of the thing I really don’t now
Thanks for seeing things in a Nother Waze
9:06 scale 2 billion hectares is  20 million sq kilometres. Russia has a land area of 17.13 million only. 1 billion extra for vegan means 10 million sq kilometres. USA has a land area of 9.83 million only. The difference between giving up beef and giving up animal is one entire USA.
I was expecting something around how good it is to eat meat for the human body
Vegetarians feeling superior this whole video
How do you guys make theese animations?
Gorgeous 😘
high quality content as always, bravo!
"No other bodily function is enjoyed multiple times and never gets old"... Well, this is going places.
I'm eating McDonald's while watching this
I find myself skeptical about the objectivity of the meta-analysis of transportation emission, when y'all point out that avocados take up very little for freight shipment, but neglect to also mention the emission for overland transportation between port and store, when you mention that local products have such high emissions/kg. If anything wouldn't their emissions be comparable, with the freight shipment merely being a negligible amount? Perhaps then you might mention things like shipment density or something. If you can, it would be nice to elaborate.
I don’t care about the emissions meat produce, and majority of humanity don’t, cut the emissions from Bitcoin first
People often look at it as an all or nothing situation, but it really doesn't have to be. Just try to lower the amount of meat you consume - even just one or two meals without it per week can make a pretty big difference! I started making a tofu stir fry once per week and I started changing my diet to include more fish and chicken instead of beef. You don't have to give up meat completely to make a difference. And over time, you might come to realize that you don't even need as much meat as you thought to feel happy and satisfied. I almost never have beef anymore and I'm totally happy even though I used to consider beef my favorite meat.
👍👏💻📱🎉🎊🌱🍎🍌🍐🍔🍗🍳🍴
Of course there is one issue. Say the entire world goes vegan. We no longer have a need for these farm animals and they will most likely go extinct. And if they don't then the carbon output from cows aint gonna change whether we eat them or not.
You still haven’t watched the sacred cow book and film and it shows…
We also need a video that is released about lab made meat that is made from plants but tastes just like meat
Best to worse beef is not a 10x difference on emissions but an 11x difference.  Come on guys!
I’ll never give up meat
What about fish, what emissions do fish create, and could they possibly be a sustainable diet on a large scale?
Too yummy. I'm serious btw
Veganism is the only strong ideology I hold. Less killing (first and foremost), a better environment, and an overall healthier body are all amazing benefits to me.
Here's a thought for you We have raised a bunch of species of cattle ONLY for their meat, to the point where they cannot exist anymore without our help. If we stop raising them for meat, these cattle breeds are going to die off (There won't be enough people going "Hey I want to keep this giant cow as a pet." Meat may be murder according to anti beef activists, but veganism is cow genocide. Save a cow, eat a hamburger!   Obviously I'm joking. Good video!
USE THE SEARCH ENGINE ECOSIA!
No significant number of people will eat different than they do so To reduce meat production it would have to led by government but I doubt they will ever get that done
Multiple questions: 1. Does transportation include refrigeration costs and migrent farmer costs? 2. Does this include the  carbon cost of fermentations needed with soy production? 3. Does this include the dangers of monocultures?   It's easy to theorize veganism but especially with countries that benefited from colonialism. Surviving on animal subsistence is important. Just ask indigenous cultures.
Admit it, people who use reddit and people who knows memes admired the stonks meme in the video
Ive never understood the "cattle emit methane" arguments. Like, are we debating finishing off wild buffalos and deer and prevent their emissions?
Yeah but who cares? I don't give a fuck about climate change because it doesn't affect me.
Nice job presenting some facts I did not know (and have not researched myself yet). In 2300, if mankind is still alive, will we view ranching as primitive or safely regulated? I desperately hoped this was going to discuss so many ideas that it did not. I want to know what the theoretical impact of switching to lab grown meat would be. I want to know what the impact of switching to insect based proteins would be. I want to know what the human carbon footprint would look like if just the plants we need to sustain life were protected and we wiped out every other species on the planet. (Terraform much?)  And Another Thing, how is fish carbon-footprinty-wise (thanks for all the fish)? This channel has full on Dyson sphere videos, where is the "humans can eat and be happy" discussion? TLDR version of this video is 'kill all animals and plants and there is no climate change worry'. I'm not exactly a fan of that particular idea, but I'm pretty sure it holds up to logical scrutiny. Still... baseline, I want myself and our descendants to enjoy food and not die, how do we achieve that? (Just that really, how do we make food taste great, solve our biological needs, and still make the world better for everyone else? [That's all, just solve for ^everything!]) {No, ketchup is not the answer!!!}
Just an awesome video, as always! 🙂👍
If I don’t eat my meat, I feel less energetic.
Naturaly, the consumption of meat will decrease over time. This is a fact that no one of thoes progressive channels tells you. Just by the fact that meat production is not a very efficient way to produce food (besides all of thoes greenhouse effects). There's why: First, the global population is getting rich and growing. This is a fact. Never in the history of human kind, there's so few percentage of global population below misery line. In all over the world, the average salary are growing. When people get rich, they consumption will growl. The demmand of meat will increase together with all the other foods, while the landscape offer will decrease to support it. The price of the meat will rise much more than other foods and the average population will change it food consumption behavior. while more and more people get rich and can afford better and better meals, thoes less efficient food will exponentialy rise its price, simply because more and more food will be needed to support the richer population's hungry. The final result is: Meat and others not efficient methods of producing food will be luxury, a small portion of the marketshare, while others types of food will overpower just by demmand and supply. It will be way more demmand of thoes other foods that people can afford that the expensive meat. That fenomenon is happening right now. Everyone who eats meat are noticing this effect, but don't understand why. There's the answer: It just not worth it.
This is why I don't eat beef. Also it tastes like nothing.
I want to accelerate the collapse. should I eat more meat? I drive a hybrid but I should probably get a truck
Meat is good for you, unless it’s factory farmed meat. Vegans seethe.
I guess the human species deserves whatever comes because we created it.
This is super misleading video. After the leftist libtart watched this, they will try to mandate what you should eat. 😂😂 The livestock doesn't consume half of our food, they were fed mostly stems and leaves and poorly grow crops, which wasn't consume by human. It's same concept like letting livestock eating at the land unable to grow food. Hey Kurzesag, stick to something you know rather than misleading something you don't know.
yeah, trees are nice and all but remember that once it dies, a large portion of the co2 is released back into the air over time. trees are only a temporary fix.
I got so confused when he said "mee-thane" instead of "meh-thane."
Do a video on quasars please
Long story short: There is no change in environmental policy that will satisfy everyone.
Yeah I am not giving up my meat. So good!
Lite the sky on fire
Don't want to eat something? Fine, don't eat it, but don't contribute in ANY WAY to denying someone else from eating it. 😤
The Texas State Senate passed Concurrent Resolution 3 (SCR3) on April 15, 2021, condemning the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)’s involuntary organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience.  Angela Paxton, one of the state senators who introduced the resolution, said after the Senate vote, “Everything about it [the organ harvesting crime] goes against treating individuals with the dignity they deserve simply for being a human being.”  She believes the resolution will serve to educate Texans about the atrocity. She said some people may have heard about it, but they don’t speak up about it and simply treat it as a rumor. But “we want to go on record and say that ‘this is happening’ and we condemn it,” she said.  Donna Campbell, another state senator who sponsored the resolution, said, “That’s an atrocity. That’s a human rights violation that no nation should turn a blind eye to.”  Campbell added, “Hopefully, this resolution will say to the medical community: tell your patients this is wrong. Because I think patients unknowingly become a partner with the murdering of innocent people. There needs to be a global outcry that ‘this is wrong.’ Nations need to sanction China for this kind of behavior.”  Below is the full text of the resolution.  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION  WHEREAS, For the better part of two decades, China's communist regime has been engaged in the vile practice of forcibly removing human organs for transplant; and  WHEREAS, In June 2019, the independent China Tribunal announced its finding that China's regime had for decades practiced systematic forced organ removal from prisoners of conscience; it is believed that organs have been harvested from hundreds of thousands of incarcerated people, mainly Falun Gong practitioners, but possibly also Tibetan Buddhists, House Church Christians, and members of the Uyghur Muslim ethnic minority; and  WHEREAS, China has welcomed an influx of “transplant tourism,” whereby individuals critically in need of transplants pay thousands of dollars for one of 60,000 to 90,000 transplant surgeries conducted each year; the number of transplants far exceeds the number of voluntary organ donations in the country; moreover, Chinese hospitals are able to schedule transplants of major organs within two weeks, suggesting nefarious foreknowledge regarding the “donation” of these organs; by contrast, America's highly developed organ donation system requires that recipients be placed on a carefully curated list to await the transplant of an organ; the timing of these transplants is not predictable, as an organ may not be available for hundreds of days, or in time for a specific patient; and  WHEREAS, Falun Gong, a spiritual practice centered on the values of truthfulness, compassion, and tolerance, became immensely popular in the 1990s; in July 1999, the Chinese Communist Party launched an intensive, nationwide persecution designed to eradicate the spiritual practice; Freedom House reported in 2015 that Falun Gong practitioners are the primary victims of forced organ removal and face an elevated risk of dying or being killed in custody; and  WHEREAS, On July 20, 2020, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced 21 years of persecution of Falun Gong by China's communist regime, declaring in a press statement: “We call on the PRC government to immediately end its depraved abuse and mistreatment of Falun Gong practitioners, release those imprisoned due to their beliefs, [. . .] and address the whereabouts of missing practitioners. Twenty-one years of persecution of Falun Gong practitioners is far too long, and it must end”; and  WHEREAS, United Nations Special Rapporteurs have called on the Chinese government to account for the sources of organs used in transplant practices, and the World Medical Association, the American Society of Transplantation, and the Transplantation Society have all called for sanctions on Chinese medical authorities; resolutions condemning organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience have been adopted by the parliaments of Canada and the European Union, as well as by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States House of Representatives, and it is important to join the international outcry against this major violation of human rights; now, therefore, be it  RESOLVED, That the 87th Legislature of the State of Texas hereby strongly condemn China's practice of involuntary organ harvesting; and, be it further  RESOLVED, That the 87th Legislature of the State of Texas encourage the medical community to educate Texans about the risks of travel to China for organ transplants to help prevent Texas residents from unwittingly becoming involved in murder in the form of forced organ harvesting from prisoners of conscience; and, be it further  RESOLVED, That the 87th Legislature of the State of Texas respectfully urge the United States Congress and the president of the United States to pass laws and adopt measures prohibiting collaboration between U.S. medical and pharmaceutical companies and any Chinese counterparts linked with forced organ harvesting, banning entry into the United States of those who have participated in unethical removal of human tissues and organs, and providing for the prosecution of such individuals.
Who wants to ban beef?  Everyone: ME!  Who wants to study facts?  Everyone: uhhh, maybe?  Who wants to actually change how they live instead of yelling at other people in real life and social media?  Everyone:
So much meat eater cope in the comments. Like i eat meat aswel, but just own the fact that its bad and stop lying to yourselves.
Other countries: _Solving Earth's climate change and global warming_ My country: _Spent $7.7 million on the rehabilitation of a fucking bay in the middle of a pandemic where a lot of people need help_
Thanos was right :o
lab based meat ?
Opa, parece que mencionaram o Brasil kkkkkk pena que foi sobre a destruição da Amazônia...
We should all eat bugs. Or soil and green.
Where my chicken gang at?
Locally produced meat products are functionally illegal in the USA. See: "Everything I Want to do is Illegal"
If we are talking about energy density of food then won’t the land used for cattle just be replaced by crops (if everybody turned vegan)
So what should we do
I view crop lands as animal deserts.
Video: "No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old" My hand: "we'll see about that statement"
Jokes on you beef is banned in India, I've never had it.
as someone who has been vegan since i was 15, I really think that the best way to make progress is to work together. But working together does not mean forcing people to eat differently, or shaming them. We just need to be informative and at the same time understand that individuals are not entirely to blame. We have to be facing our frustrations towards the companies that make it very difficult for us to eat well. And we have to realize that while our individual actions do matter, we are so much more powerful together. And realizing that companies are emitting so much more than we could comprehend, while simultaneously making it harder for us individuals to do our individual part in helping the climate and the lives of animals. We also have to think about how animals AND workers are mistreated and tortured in these systems. There is a lot of environmental racism in target demographics of food, and in who works and who is underpaid. There are so many issues and i feel that a lot of people are alienated from talking about these issues just because they aren't vegan or aren't vegetarian, etc. Everyone deserves to feel welcome and not ashamed of the way they live, especially when they're trying to learn about these issues, and when those people are probably the most affected by the systems we are trying to change.
Exelent📢
So this is what mark rober are trying to push for when he made the video about how meat made from plants are better than the original beef made from animals
6 minute mark when i realised that humans are the problem
I'm gonna go ahead and keep eating beef even if I have to move to a farm and raise cattle myself.
ALL HAIL AND GLORY TO THE DEMON COW
What about overpopulation! The more people there are, the more food needs to be produced!
Is meat bad?  Yes, but also no. Also kind of, but also not. Can't lose by playing both sides.
I respect the footnotes in the videos
Did they seriously forget to even mention regenerative agriculture????
I just want to point out if you do want to help reduce your carbon foot print by your diet but aren’t ready to go vegan or vegetarian than don’t.   I hear people say things like  “I would go vegetarian if it wasn’t for bacon” or “I’d like to go vegan but … cheese”   That’s okay, you can still eat the things you love and cut out other dairy or meat products to help out.  You can just reduce your intake of it or remove your intake of other products.There’s this narrative that it’s either vegan or not but it doesn’t have to be that way. I only eat meat around once a week and it’s normally chicken or fish and I still eat some dairy products. I tried to go vegan but I found was a detriment to my health and I wasn’t consuming enough calories. I stop being vegan but still decreased my intake of meat and dairy and cut out red meat.
Who wants to kill global warming  *everyone* : MEE  Who wants to actually do it   ...........
Great video, scientific, objective and very logical.  People really need to change their diet. The amount of meat consumed nowadays in some countries is not just harmful for the environment, but simply UNHEALTHY. Not even mentioning horrible industrial farming practices and ethical aspects.
I literally have the solution. We can grind up our dead and supplement it with soy, algae, lentils, insect meal and call it umm... Soylent. We will make it green so it looks environmentally friendly.   (the worst part is this would probably help,and id probably try it)
Damn  i love not giving two fucks about green house gases.
👇👇
It annoys me that I can't see the dislike ratio.  As usual a lot of very well researched points were made, but some of the data showcased in charts is downright manipulative. You brushed off the fact that agricultural products also need to be transported inland. No mention of the amount of creatures that are killed per harvest (rats birds etc that get caught in the harvest process which is done by machinery) What grade of the food produced is fed to cattle? How much emissions and carbon trapped in the soil does tilling produce? You made a very valid point about soy, but you don't mention that soy has had a rapid growth in demand due to popularity of vegan and vegetarian diets requiring it. Sure an argument can be made that replacing pasture lands entirely to produce soy there (not true but let's assume so) would create less emissions. But them you come back to the issue of an increase in demand anyways due to the population increasing as time goes on. Alternatives such as design and production of equipment that can convert greenhouse gases into o2 are also being produced. I firmly believe everyone should be free to eat what they like. Vegan or carnivore or anything in between. Regardless I learnt a lot in this video, just felt like it had an agenda behind it.
(I like beef)
This video made me wanna eat meat SO bad
😀
Wasn't the main argument that supporting sistematical slaughter and raping of animals is unethical?
I still wanna eat meat, so people are gonna have to stop spawning kids
Wait for all the Carnists to come up with excuses as to why they can't go Vegetarian/Vegan because -Add non existing disease-.
One thing to keep in mind: you don't have to go 100% vegan or vegetarian ... it isn't all or nothing. If you replace beef with pork or chicken, great. If you eat meat less often or have smaller portions, great. That all helps. I have changed to a mostly vegetarian diet but when I get Thai food (a couple times a month) I opt for chicken. If I'm eating with others and we are sharing food, I'll have what they're having, no fuss about insisting on vegetarian options.
Thanks for mentioning Brazil, there is a lot of misinformation in this country
There is currently research going on now that suggests giving cows seaweed can greatly reduce the amount of methane they produce.
Leave it alone Kurzgesagt, people will never stop eating meat
Meat equals good meat.
Happily contributing to 3 billion hectares. :-)
if cows burp and fart methane then shouldn’t global warming started long before ? Cows exist before global warming
In a nutshell: go vegan
0:04 talk about your life, not mine.
Idk man, I was really enjoying your videos up to the point when you started propoganding vegan diet, I have a health condition where I cannot consume grain and beans, and if I do, I have extreme eczema flares, and most of food allergies, excluding dairy, come from plant based foods, and on average around 80% of all humans suffer some sort of sensitivity to one or more popular plant foods, examples- after taco Tuesday you will have a toilet Wednesday.  I would be curious if you'd reaserch what humans have consumed since ancestry and how agricultural revolution has impacted human health and make a video of that.
It is bad, get over it loves
Funny that I just stopped eating meat again a week ago then this information. I also feel the way the animals are treated even if it's more efficient plays a huge role for me. I don't want to eat an animal that has had so much laziness, sadness, etc negative energy in it till it died. Also you didn't explore the option of killing your own animals like deer. I feel like that could be a good alterative to buying all these factory produced/farm animals.
Thanks for great information
Don’t care, tasty.
Meat as we know it is definitely bad for the environment and for animals. But giving up on it is not a realistic solution. Rather than trying to force it out we should focus on finding direct alternatives that can outcompete it
6:29 someone show this to the vegan teacher
For anyone curious about sustainable farming practices, including raising beef cattle, I recommend the 2019 documentary "The Biggest Little Farm" .
Yes it takes so much energy to grow a cow for an monkey to eat. Just like how deer eats a bird and its probably not a good idea for the deer's health.
I'm really disappointed with the path Kurzgesagt have taken recently. They're pedalling the Great Reset narrative. Plant-based, nutrient-deficient diets to "save the world". You can guarantee elites will NOT be dining the way we'll be.
Growing up, we used to eat meat only once a week. And everything was fine.
Jokes on me, I can't afford beef anyway!
I have to commend Kurzgesagt for tackling this issue from an almost meatlover point of view. I think it's the smartest approach to try and reach the majority of humanity who, environmentally conscious or not, just loves meat so damn much.
One doesn’t experience self-transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates 🎈
Oh well, I'll die long before eating vegie burgers are mandatory/the only thing available. Anyone want anything from the grill? I'm cooking
No dislike???
I am carnivorous and as interesting as this video is, I DONT CARE. Bacon cheese burgers are delicious. BBQ chicken is a staple in my diet
This video does a good job on showing the effect of Beef on the environment. However, as someone who wants to get the most nutrients out of food, I need to see a comparison of the nutrients provided by beef alternatives to know whether the switch to vegan beef or other alternatives would be even worth it. Any recommendations?
I was hoping this video would cover the possibility of lab grown meat, maybe that can come in a part 2
I already decided years ago. I'll keep eating healthy animal fat. Thank you.
"There's controversy about how bad this is" Don't legitimize those grifters.
Well, why not focus on poultry and fish and reduce beef/lamb consumption? Just make it costly... People will auto-regulate.
1000 calories from a piece of meat and a 1000 calories from the sorta crop that would replace it are not the same, even if you had a large varaiety of veggies to choose from you'd still have trouble getting you required amount of potasium, magnesium and b12 vitamins.
I will never take any talk about climate change seriously until China and nuclear power are involved the conversation
I only eat beef once a month now but i still love it but i had a question what would happen to beefs pollution if the cows were fed the sea weed supplements that almost eliminates the methane in their farts.
everything said in this video relies on the belief that the planet is warming unnaturally and that it is a serious problem, which is a very large stretch knowing what we know. the climate is random, at least to our perspective, we cant predict anything that will happen because of just how many variables there are and how many unknowns there are. its like trying to identify a famous painting from just one millimeter of it. everything climate change advocates say is based on speculation and assumption, which historically has never been correct (there have been claims about the climate for 60 years, none of them have been correct). now, with that said, we do indeed know that the average temperature has raised a small bit since we have been able to record it, but what we don't know is if this is natural or unnatural, and seeing how little we know about the climate, that will be unknown for a long time. lastly, we don't know if it will be a serious threat, in fact we know it likely wont be one. sure the average water level will raise a few feet as the water heats upslightly and expands, but the only areas affected by that will be waterborne and beachside regions, meaning that the worst we will see is a few towns and cities seeing water damage challenges. this heat wont kill the ocean or the coral reefs either, the ocean will evaporate a bit more and the clouds will balance out the heating effect, and the coral reefs are used to changes in temperature because the temperature isn't constant and often will spike drastically, if they cant survive a few degrees increase, then they wouldn't be here.
Me eating chiken noodles while watching 🙄
Hm... Why is meat not carbon neutral? We don't really add any new carbon atoms into the whole ecosystem (like we do when we burn dug up fossil fuels and release new carbon into the atmosphere). But isn't it a closed cycle/loop here? I mean, for example cows eat grass that already got the carbon from the atmosphere and now we are just returning it back to the system??
Well this was stupid.. I’m more interested in the health factor. I thought this video was going to explain about if meat was unhealthy. Ended up being a climate change video? Very misleading video. Shame on y’all
I am dislike.
I have literally finished the meat I was eating in the time it has taken me to endure the adverts, thanks 👍
Okay, Im gonna be vegan now
Man literally released it on the german channel before the main one
MMMMmmmMMMmmmMmmmmMmmm yummy stek
maybe, just maybe, it isn't just at the hands of the common person to make a difference. We need all corporations, countries, and poor and rich people to regulate emissions. If only one group makes an effort, everyone falls.
when the climate change leitmotif hits
Chicken and eggs, best balance we got!
So let me get this right. If the world went vegan immediately, we’d have 3billion hectares of land free. My question though is, don’t crops use animal based fertiliser?
Wanna save the planet from climate change. Stop eating seafood. Anything from the ocean should be nixed. I tried and was successful for a month and fell off with shrimp and salmon dinner. Seaspiracy was enlightening.
I gave up beef ever since the documentary "Cowspiracy" on Netflix. Hard to give up pork and poultry. Props to vegans for helping with the environment.
Well I can give up beef seeing it's harming the environment this much...  However, I would rather die than going full vegan. I mean life is 100% meaningless if you have to eat shitty salads and broccolis all day every day.
Is chicken still good?
"Destroying rainforest for economic gain is like burning a Renaissance painting to cook a meal." - E. O. Wilson
MEEEEEETHANE!
You just made petas kill list
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day” …😳😅
Humans aren't the cause of climate change...  It's a planet that slowly is getting closer to our solar system
This new learning amazes me, Kurzgesagt. Explain again how sheep's bladder can be employed to prevent earthquakes.
I watched this while eating a burger
Now I know why in our cultural beef is prohibited
Now talk about plant based proteins and lab grown meats please.
Video idea! What would happen if the Library of Alexandria was never burned down?
beating it is
Beef stonks
Ayo is it just me or he asking if I want meat? "meat"
time to go vegan
I wish I found this 8 hours earlier
The way I see it, those of us who have the ability to eat a plant-based diet should do so, since the world can't sustain 8 billion people taking part in animal agriculture. I think it's important to acknowledge that not everyone gets much choice in what they eat, so those who do have a choice should a) make the better choice when possible, and b) work to make the food system more sustainable and accessible for everyone, not just the privileged.
Interesting video
you will eat ze bugs and be happy!
Yes let us keep pushing the issue on the consumer not the mega corporations that actively avoid change as to not hurt their profits
I really can't help but think our future will be a dystopian one. Just look at us, we already know the huge problems the world is constantly facing and yet nobody is taking action. We're doomed.
we as a species are fucked
zero dislikes so far, good job Kurzgesagt!
Fish??
So it's not that there's not enough meat, it's that there's too many people  I'm starting to see a solution here
BEEF S t o n k s
What about the argument that since the meat has already been farmed, me buying that meat wouldn't change much
I don't care.
Is meat bad? No…..well….no but then again…… nah
Very easy to say "stop growing" to an undeveloped country that produces less than 1% of the global co2 emissions. This video comes from a good place but focuses on the wrong thing and misses the big picture entirely.
alternate title: kurzgesagt insulting vegans for 12 minutes
Potatoes emit 100x less than beef  That vegan teacher and supporters: WRITE THAT DOWN!! WRITE THAT DOWN!!!
8:33 Cows only eat the parts that we don't eat (i.e. stems, leaves, etc), don't they?
Health, ethics, and climate effects all favor a vegan lifestyle. Unfortunately we are so hard wired to eat meat and also shown in societies across the world that it is almost impossible to stop. Nevertheless, these benefits will persevere, and one day in the future, humans will be completely vegan. Eating animals will be a thing of the past like slavery or some other inhumane act
What about fish
So, why did not the Earth burnt out itself when hundred of millions of buffalo, bison and other big ruminants populated the praires of all continents?
i completely agree with the conclusion but I'll stick to meat because I am very selfish :)
MEAT LOVE MEATLOAF I get it haha
In short, buy local, reduce your meat diet if you can.  And if you don't have access to local, Contact your local rep and pressure them to make  local produce affordable and accessible.
most of the water is on the food and rain so is just a cycle is not lost forever thats one of the thing where i cant be agree . water even in your pee just recycle naturaly
Sure the earth is cool and all. But have you ever eaten a 20 ounce Steak from the Keg.
Can we just appreciate them for the effort they put in their videos and the hard work they do in each of their videos.
Jesus, this is a depressing video, you think you're doing right by eating beef grown in a pasture, giving that cow a decent life, but if we're looking at CO2 emissions the cold-hearted and brutal factoring farming method is the 'best' option.
I switched to a vegan diet about 3 years ago, and honestly it's much easier than you would think. There are so many amazing substitutes, so if you do try going vegan don't be put off by a few bad tasting ones.
Vegan Karen’s: You should die if you eat meat!! Me: eats veggie bacon Next to my pig
I haven't watched this but I'm just gonna say from my opinion. short answer: no. long answer: no it is not.
I didn't see Taiwan when you showed the map of China. Well played.
If you still believe co2 emissions impact global temperature, you can't be helped. With no small thanks going to the censors who don't allow and suppress discussion of any of the refuting evidence. Remember: If you can question it, it's science. If you can't question it, it's religion.  Since the 80's and 90's, temperature HASN'T risen, and neither have ocean levels (not above the tiny amount they are always steadily rising over the last several millennia) So what they are forced to do to create the rise is change the historical thermometer data to make the past appear cooler than it actually was. All you have to do is look at the same graphs released in the 80s, then 90s, then 00s to see them do this. Sound like 'science' to you? Or does it sound like clinging to earth-centrist religion refusing Galileo's helio-centrist model that didn't need rampant fudging of the data to fir the theory?
So what, we need to switch to 100% renewable energy for everything AND go vegan? And that's based off of today's numbers, while the population of the world keeps going up, meaning we'll need even more food? Idk, sounds like the problem is that there's just too many people...
So in other words, feeding 7 billion and growing people is nearly impossible without killing the planet
I love meat. :D
"no bodily pleasure aside eating is experienced everyday and never gets old"  *quietly closes incognito tab*
Kind of wish these videos would talk about products that are made from those animals as well.  What would the carbon footprint be if you made these items without using animals?   Would going meat free still clearly be in the lead, or would it even out more?
heh Cowsgesagt.
I guess the best solution for global warming is less human. Less people to feed, less emission. It will also stop/slow down the industrial growth which I'm sure, participate in making global warming worsen even faster. If only people are not greedy...
So what you're saying is we need to keep eating beef to stop them over populating and farting loads of methane into the ozone? because we would be over run if we stopped eating/culling them as there are no natural predators in most places and if we did introduce them im sure some men, women and children would go missing alot more.
Can methane be used as a fuel source?
The world would collapse if the people who built the world couldn't have meat.
It's definitely complicated.  A point the video didn't make, what are the health consequences? Healthcare also has a huge environmental impact on the environment. If a vegetarian diet makes more people sick it may not actually be better for the environment.
Wouldnt there be better ways of storing animals for slaughter that doesnt have them living in squalor? Yes there is. Is there money in treating animals like living beings? No. Too many scumbags on the planet unfortunately.
man it sucks that we'll just never not eat beef
Millions of millions of unsold food are being thrown by food companies. What a waste.
Good video, but its illogical to think that the majority of humans would adopt a vegan diet to try and impact climate change.
So, go vegan folks 😂
I need to thank you for this video Mostly when you mention Brazil. Over here, monoculture and livestock industry work together. While the second one "open the way" by destroying forests and clearing them up, soy monoculture comes and starts to plant soy. Cerrado biome has already more than 50% of its land producing monoculture, yesterday, livestock industry was there. This is how they make their expansion. Now, Amazon and Pantanal can be in danger. "Oh, then say to these people to stop destroying the biomes" Shure, they Will stop getting billions of dollars in profit Just because we asked. Brazil is among the biggest meat and soy exporters. First was sugar cane, then cafe, now soy... Monoculture exists since the colony, they are powerfull. Oh, and yes, as It is mentioned in the vídeo, most part of soy crops It is used for animal feeding.  I saw a pathetic video from What I have learned Channel, where they explain and "debunks" the "myth" around beef and gas emissions. In the vídeo, they considers  only how livestock market works in U.S. The world is not U.S. actually, they seemed more worried to win a discussion than actually debate the Topic. Well done Kurzgesagt, once again.
thats what your mom said
You may have won this time Vegan Teacher...
Beef    S T O N K S
The mere existence of cows contribute to climate change according to data. This is one of the things that triggered a change of mind about the climate change movement. The age of large mammals (in pre-history, before humans drove them to extinction) already has a lot of methane production that should be of concern to experts today.   With many many factors intertwined, it seems like the only real solution to 'climate change' is the big reduction in human population and a halt in human progress. It's anti-human.   My stance now, is to accept climate change - climate is never constant anyway. But I maintain environmental concern. So I support (1) efficient energy use, (2) a life of low-moderate consumption, and (3) minimization of pollution.
This video misses almost all considerable nuance on the topic :/
Fascinating. You are my main trusted source of digest content on issues like this - unfailingly rational and illuminating. Please keep it coming!
I have conflicting thoughts about this video. I'll start with saying that I'm happy you're covering this topic with your usual rigorous research and unbiased outlook. The more people who know about meat's heavy impact on our climate and environment the better. I'm also happy that you didn't advocate for people to switch from eating cattle to eating chickens and fish, which would be better for the climate but contribute to a greater number of animals suffering and being killed. On the other hand, I'm disappointed Kurzgesagt, despite its deep respect for humans, doesn't take a stronger stance on the billions of animals killed for food every year (I know you covered factory farming in some depth in a video in 2018, but I'm thinking beyond just animal welfare). We elevate our tastebuds and culture above the very lives of cows, chickens, and pigs—just because they're different species. It's past time that we stopped taking the lives of others just because we feel like it. I've been a vegan now for 6+ years and meat-free for 13+ years, and I'm happy and healthy. I hope more people turn to plant-based lifestyles and leave animals alone.
I will not eat bugs.
Search for: "Eating less Meat won't save the Planet. Here's Why" Youtube is confusing
Huge miss in the CO2 transport costs comparison.  CO2 cost for those big transport ships is measured per tonne per kilometer, which means that the transport cost is only low because of how much they can carry per trip, it does not mean that the ship isn't costing a figurative ton of CO2 to operate. Most transported food needs to be climate controlled, so we can use the .023 figure, but if we're talking about eating locally and assuming that these transport ships are loaded with nothing but food (which is something we can reasonably assume since there is so much food transport) we can subtract 1,300 kg CO2 eq per kilometer per ship taken out of the equation from our CO2 budget. If everyone is eating locally then these ships simply aren't traveling anymore and those tonnes of CO2 don't get added to the atmosphere.   Furthermore, the numbers provided assumes that there is no need to transport the food to and from the port. This would reasonably be further than transporting food from a local farm and/or butcher to your home since there tend to be fewer local ports for a given state/country than farms and butchers and would use the very same methods to transport the foods locally. No matter how you slice it eating foreign foods adds CO2 into the equation and eliminating the CO2 cost of transport could take us from 26% to nearly 21%, which is a savings of almost 20%  Finally, the numbers given don't reference that several popular transport foods like green beans and berries are commonly shipped by air, the most CO2 expensive method, by far.  Also, by the numbers they provide in the description, chicken and eggs both beat out rice in the CO2 per 100 grams protein scale.
I mean they crap on the local food production, however they do not mention that here food is locally produced is also usually produced in a way that regenerates that environment and in this way the benefits cancel the negatives of local food production, whereas globalized food production is more efficient per say, however there are no regenerative benefits to it, in fact is usually the opposite, so global food production only brings in negative, the fact that it is efficient does not change the fact that is the major destroyer of environments. Often times I feel the regenerative aspect of locally sourced food is either missed or emitted on purpose. I hate to say it, but I have seen similar arguments in the Can YOU Fix Climate Change? video where again they make the point that the best solution is to adopt technology with our money, but I find that this is only half the story. Adopting the latest tech and going for globalized food solutions does put money in the rich peoples hands and drives the class difference even more, however this has been happening for the past two centuries, and it only seems to have piled more problems on, that always claim the solution would be in the next invention, however the solution never fully comes, all it does it seems to get closer and closer to creating irreversible changes to our planet. I understand we should not tell people how, or what to do with their riches, however seem like there is a problem with limitation. Can someone explain me why a system of limitation after reaching a certain salary/business level/country wealth won't work. It is ultimately the top lets say 20% that create this problem while the rest of 80% suffer for it. If I am wrong please educate me, I am trying to understand
The problem isn't a matter of meat being eaten, regardless of your preferences, it's the fact that meat historically was a luxury food which has moved into the staple category resulting in emissions because the demand then grows proportionally to the population. You have to feed x number of cows, pigs, chickens, etcetera for every human that eats meat.
The point is this if we are the all powerful  humans to the cows 🐄, and we do this to them, if there is a more powerful and advance creature in the universe that wants to do the same to us, what excuses can we possibly give to not be treated the same way?
At 1:46 there's a bit of a discrepancy AND a clear biased opinion.   Well it is true by saying that "global transport" by big freighters is more efficient, that in the end has NOTHING to do with the cargo. This argument can be made with ANY cargo, sourced locally or not.   Furthermore, it is RARE that any product is made right besides a harbor.  Meaning, to get from the producer to the harbor and then from the other harber to the Shop is done mostly by car.  So, it is actually WORSE to go for global sourced Products if you factor in the WHOLE transport chain.  Allso, Plant based foodstuffs suffer under the same Issue if they are sourced Locally. And it works in reverse for animal based foodstuffs too if they are sourced globally.  All in all the transport argument is kinda useless and the biased is deeply flawed.
did you take into account the portion of feedcrops themselves that cannot be otherwise consumed by humans? Much of what ruminants are given is from chaff, otherwise inedible, and much like grass.

Good job on this video! A lot of people like to deny these facts, and then when they're finally cornered, they just go "ok but meat yummy." Thanks for being rational amongst idiots lol.
Al Gore.
Comparing 100 years of CO2 removal to just a single year of CO2 emissions at 9:34 is just an incredibly dishonest presentation
Land that can't directly be used to make food can still be used also for vertical farming of plant based crops, thus also taking up less space than traditional farming and being more environmentally friendly as no small animals can accidentally be swept up and killed and instead the area not used for vertical farming can be used, as mentioned, for replanting of trees and rewilding projects
Hello my fellow humans!
I would suggest reading 'The One Straw Revolution' by M Fukuoka...
The real answer is: NO
Culture meat maybe can help
Solution to climate change and every problem in the world: Force humanity to go nonexistent.
I feel the answer was glossed over too casually. Beef had been perverted because the demand has incentivized producers to take the abhorrent shortcuts. Only raise cows naturally and SLOWLY and you don't have methane issues.  If production goes down 70 percent then that's fine. It's better to have quality than crap. Yeah it'll mean it will be more rare but that isn't a bad thing.
I feel that a lot of things were taken out of context here, not to mention almost all these numbers are gross instead of net. Additionally, it's really misleading to cattle in a prison like state when on factory farms because it's not like that AT ALL.
Soylent powder. Problem solved.
im disappointed that this video didnt significantly cover the impacts to animal welfare. how can you title a video 'is meat that bad' and not go into the horrible conditions for the animals that are forced to produce it? makes me wonder about where humanity is headed and our priorities. of course the environmental impacts of animal production are horrendous, but to hardly even acknowledge the impacts to these sentient beings? the lack of care is stark
I love how every country used all their forests and now wanna make brazil looks bad for doing the same.
To the point that we need to grow crops for the sole purpose of feeding views, is that exactly the case? I thought they could eat the typically inedible parts like grain husks, etc.
Wait so all the massive amounts of animals that where farting over the millions of years didn't cause climate CHANGE?   This is such BS..
And if this video is true, best way to avoid carbon emission by livestock growing is butcher ALL pet cats and dogs and prohibiting pet carnivorous  animals (including dogs and cats) to prevent consuming their MEATY foods.
make veggie borger cheaper, then me choose instead of meet patti
The most detailed meta-analysis you cited fails to take human digesti e emissions into account. You feed me a serving of beans, and 6-10 hours l'll be producing methane in copious amounts for another 4-5. Beef & lamb? Zero.
Seriously, can't someone just genetically engineer some corn or something that would breathe in 10 times as much co2 so we won't have to give our hypocrite leaders money to fly to climate conferences and pollute the planet?
Obviously the food with the highest emissions is also the most delicious and nutritious.
Hey everyone! :D I hope you stay safe and have a nice day, God bless you! <3
I personaly wonder how artificially grown meat will change things if put on a wide scale
*Googles: how to photosynthesis diet
EXTREMELY MINOR QUIBBLE: Sometimes I wish they ran their script by a native English speaker. For example, no native speaker would say "two thousand one hundred" to refer to the year 2100, instead they would say "twenty one hundred". The narrator in this video says it like you would in German: "zweitausendeinhundert"
I’m Jamaican and we rarely eat beef at home. That’s a fast food type of thing. Actually we grow our own chickens in our back yard. So I think it’s a bit less emissions
Your channel will lack credibility while you continue to endorse the myth that C02 is bad for Earth. Do some real research on CO2 instead of blindly following the mainstream.
The world is over populated. Just because it can support 12B people, does not mean it should.  Stop. Breeding.  You are bringing offspring into a dying world to suffer for your own "needs". Just stop!
ban all video games so kids won't stay home wasting power having fun problem solved
Just cutting out beef and consuming  other animal products such as poultry and seafood has a very large positive impact and is a very easy switch for those like me who can't see themselves as vegans. I can't understand why people portray it as it's either beef or go vegan without any options in between.
9:12 I think in the future you should refer to this as plant-based. It is true that a vegan diet is the same as a plant-based diet, but someone who is plant-based is not necessarily a vegan. Like rectangles and squares. Veganism is a moral philosophy. The term has been misused a ton by laypeople but it has always been a philosophy. At 10:05 you make a similar error by showing a vegan symbol while saying "veggie". Veggie of course is short of vegetarian, not vegan. And therefore this actually clashes with the facts you put earlier in the video. Veggie typically includes dairy (otherwise it would be called plant-based).
Totally fine with giving lab grown meat a try. We might even make something tastier than meat.  ... But where is it all? Not seeing a whole lot of marketting or products in this space.
So overpopulation is really bad since food consumption is a huge factor
CO2 is good
Were hard to deduct what the complicated part of this subject were. Seemed pretty clear that meat were bad for the environment. Only positive I noticed about beef were that it tastes good. But to be fair, that is a big positive. So long as the planet survives.
I have always said and will keep saying that the real culprit of 90 percent of environmental problems is caused by overpopulation. Without reducing the number of people on earth, no matter how "green" we are, we still will be putting our planet in danger. It always botter me that people rarely talk about it, because although caddle produce a lot of C02 emissions, humans are by far the ones who produce more C02 and our number keeps growing and growing. So I think that no matter what we do, the earth will never be "safe" unless we reduce our population.
Please tell me someone else noticed the beginning scene where it shows birds enjoying a feast with one of the courses being a roast chicken or turkey or something...
This still omitting carbon emission by fauna from "restored" forests and grasslands, producing non-organic fertilizers for plant crops, producing nutrition supplements for insufficient from plant-based diet. And most non-grainfed cattle and poultry and pigs are eating foods which does not comsumed by humans.
I can feel ThatveganTeacher reacting to this and singing hahahaha
Animal farming is responsible for 87% of GHG emissions. Yes, 87%. The IPCC and other environmental organizations never take into account the carbon sequestration of the lands we destroyed for animal farming. The IPCC completely ignores the opportunity cost of growing back these forests to what they once were... They only stay at the superficial level of things. The world being vegan would literally be the best solution for climate change.
food does indeed get old. Ever try eating the same thing for over a year?   Btw if you wanna help fight climate change, its more impactful to stop eating mono crops like corn, banannas, almonds, palm tree (oil), and other plants like that than it is to stop eating meat entirely. SOME meat can even be additive to the nutrition of the soil and reductive of total waste, though factor farms are obviously not an example of this.   And the amount of CO2 beef emits? A lot of that is from the aforementioned mono crops. Cows for instance, fed with certain varieties of sea weed have their emissions of methane cut by over 90%. Also the very process of giving them the corn meal we commonly use puts off most of the methane in the cycle on top of increasing the amount of methane the cows themselves produce.   What gets me is im unsure if Kurzgesagt is willfully ignorant of this or not.   "The best beef is worse than the worst plant" See, this is just bullsht   6:02 "the worst kind is the farming that cuts down forest for the farm land"  ..... like mono crops... which takes up far more surface area btw.
If you come for my beef, you should be aware I'm heavily armed.
Bet you're happy that YouTube disabled dislikes now. Y'all need to stay out of politics
The real question is do I care enough to stop eating it.
Why is the helper T cell on the table? Shouldn’t it be the cook
I don’t often comment on YouTube videos, but I’m curious about an aspect of local sourced beef that isn’t covered. I have the great fortune of living in a farming/ranching community in the middle (read: largely vacant) of the USA. Around here, it is not uncommon for 3-4 families to get a cow from a local rancher, have it butchered, split the bits, and have that be all the beef they eat for 4-8 months. Is this not more efficient than shopping weekly or monthly at one’s local butcher?
🥩
I have a question: how about indoor crop producing? Netherlands, with such a small area, is one of the biggest agricultural exporters in the world due to this technique. Can't this be a game changer? Otherwise, it seems we are all doomed to extinction by 2250 due to the inability to feed everyone, considered the inevitable climate change due to emissions in food producing, anyways...
That little animal from 0:05 to 0:09 is really slobbing on that cob, huh?
0:51 Plants vs Zombies type beat
What if we just stop making more food year by year? Population is determined by the available  amount of food by nature. That's the only rule what we trying to overcome, and thats what slowly destroys everything around us...
I kind of feel stupid for asking this question, but since carbon dioxide is such an important building block for photosynthesis, is it possible that we overcompensate for climate change? Like, if we do manage to survive the current crisis, which in all honesty is seeming more and more unlikely, is it possible for the atmosphere to have too little CO2? I mean, I guess hypothetically it's possible, but realistically, could we implement too many countermeasures and kill off some plants due to a lack of CO2? Probably not, it's not exactly a pressing topic right now, and sounds like a lot easier bridge to cross if we get there than global warming has been.

I am made of meat!
Thank you for this well needed video
Every kurzgezagt video makes me want to take notes and do more research. Being a person is just exhausting I guess
Yayyyyyyyy video

8:38 I’m pretty sure pigs will eat damn near anything. 🙄
Thank you kurzgesagt
My opinion  is we really just need to drastically cut back on meat I can't speak for other countries America definitely eats way too much meat nutrition-wise unless you're say a professional bodybuilder you really don't need that much protein per week maybe four servings (one serving is about 6-8 oz) weekly I weren't heard Americans easily eat about 10 servings a week in meat just our country alone cutting back and eating more vegetarian just in general would greatly reduce carbon waste  Tldr humans eat like carnivores we really need to eat more like the omnivores we are
Thank you for this, very well put. I wish there had been such a tight and accurate summary 5 or 10 years ago in this format. The science has been quite clear on this topic since FAO's 'Livestock's Long Shadow' was published in 2006, 15 years ago - or even before that. And the whole thing is quite obvious, too, if you know basic biology / energy flow in ecology.   When you eat beans / soy / any protein-rich plant or cereals (instead of first feeding it to an animal with bad conversion rate, and then eating some parts of that animal) you get to keep most of that energy & protein that's in those plants, instead of losing most of it to the animal's metabolism and moving around. In food chains you lose roughly 90% of your initial energy content per trophic level.   Farmers / producers have been of course trying to reduce this waste of energy and protein, simply because it reduces required agricultural inputs and thus saves money. The more efficiently your farm animals can absorb the energy and nutrients from your fodder crops or pastures, and the more you restrain them from wasting it on moving around, the more produce / money you make. This has obviously led to refinement / mutilation of animal species (chicken that gives painful birth i.e. lays eggs every day instead of twice a year like their original species, etc.) and later factory farms and all that sick sh1t, which even most of the regular meat-eating people can't bear to watch on a video, let alone visit such a place.   Now the big question is: After freeing all that huge amount of land from this wasteful and unsustainable food production, how to convince countries & people to rewild as much of it as possible, instead of just trying to make maximum profit from it, like they used to, to feed the ever-hungry economic growth. After all, the living planet which sustains us demands it, the struggle against climate change and mass extinction demands it, but our economic system (which has become global) demands the opposite. It demands endless growth, which means utilizing more and more resources & natural areas, producing endless amounts of disposable trash, all while our planet - our only home - is already in a catastrophic state. But for those who don't care about the future or anything, only fast profits matter.
Im still eat my meats, its not my fault companies are making more money to be evil, regulate it better and have money go to research/development into making it better.
It's not fair to run numbers globally. While I agree that meat isn't a very green food source numbers vary dramatically depending on what place in the world you get your averages. Developing countries can have 3x 4x or even 10x (in extraordinarily rare cases)  the amount of carbon emissions compared to developed countries. I loved the fact that you made another video on this topic but I wish you talked more about the cycle of methane (which still doesn't help but puts it more into prospective) and the varying impact depending on where you live.
I'm not gonna eat the bugs, Kurzgesagtstein
I will not eat the bug i will not live in a pod i will not eat the bug
I believe the Elephant in the room is too many of what is eating the beef....
2030 people,  in 9 years climate change will be iraversable
Bro, I thought the methane with cows thing was a was just a myth. 🙄 Who knew?
its a type 1 carcinogen right up there with asbestos , plutonium and cigarettes ...... so ya not really a good place to be ...
I think this video is a bit biased towards putting all the guilt on beef when you are leaving out key factors which the beef industry actually do well to help lower emissions FROM PLANTS! Why didn't you include any data that the beef industry eat all the "left over bits" from agriculture?? So that farmers don't have to burn the leftover bits, creating even more emissions with Plant based farms?? I think this is the least fair argument @Kurzhesagt-InANutshell  has ever done, they didn't even compare if plants had the same land as meat and all their leftover parts weren't getting eaten by the meat industry what would be the adverse side effects on our planet? This is very misleading most of the info in this video is true, but how it's presented and the lack of counterarguments for vegetables is disappointing. I usually watch these with my 12-year-old son because he loves them, but this episode might give a skip due to its biased presentation, would've loved to see a more balanced presentation about how plants can be just a polluted or worse than animals if we had no way to get rid of all the leftovers from our plant diets..... Just a tiny bit disingenuous, IMO.
Can we have images of the cow stonks and the evil cow in posters? I wanna have them for display outside my screen 📺
Nice video, always like your animations and they way they are used in describing the information you are presenting. Though the only thing I would say would be missing would be a footnote at the end about lab grown meats and how in future that might be a possible mitigation.
YESSS!!! MORE KURZGESAT!
Great video explaining the situation. I admit, I am very fond of eating meat, and it would be extremely difficult for me to set my bias on this issue aside. I won’t be becoming a vegetarian any time soon. Here are a few points not mentioned for the pro-meat eating side.  I can’t argue with the facts presented, but the assertion that we should all change our diets for the sake of slowing climate change is naive. 40% of Americans still refuse to get vaccinated against COVID. How can you seriously expect even a majority of Americans to make a lifestyle change that is considerably more difficult?  While there are alternatives to meat that provide protein, meat has the unique property of having no complex carbohydrates, making them ideal diet foods and essential for low sugar diets. Other than leafy greens, there are few low carbohydrate alternatives among other food groups. We can’t fight America’s obesity epidemic while simultaneously telling people they can’t eat diet foods. Eliminating meat consumption would doom someone with severe diabetes to a life of endless lettuce. I’ve tried eating salads on a regular basis before, and you get tired of it very quickly.  Humans are naturally omnivorous. While humans have the unique ability to deny their nature, it is not without hardship. Telling Americans to change their diets would have a success rate resembling other attempts to get large populations to deny their natural drives, like telling teenagers not to have sex. It’s just not going to work that well.  Over half a million jobs depend on meat production in the US.
They really want us to eat bugs
I wuv birbs! (:
Good stuff I see in here
We wouldn’t have to change our lifestyles at all if we just had fewer people
Awesome video kurzgesagt, keep up the great work

Kurzgesagt: Releases informative video about agriculture and the effect on climate change Me: haha beef stonks
As a hard working person i will never go vegan … i tried to live off veggies and i felt like crap with No energy … Meat gave me more strength… to get the same calories from potatoes or any other plant I would have to eat x times more veggies then meat 🍖
I love how much attention climate change is getting on this channel.  I think there's an aspect of this that needs to be discussed as well though.  I would love for Kurtzgesagt to make a video talking about the effects of vegetable oils on human health.  This is getting a lot more attention in recent years, and I think it's a really important topic to educate people on (as well as being somewhat controversial, which Kurtzgesagt does a great job of handling).  The use and consumption of vegetable oils is a huge contributing factor in the rise of heart disease, Alzheimer's, and diabetes in the world today, and not many people seem to know this.  There are many reliable studies that Kurtzgesagt could draw from to illustrate this and I would love to see them present this info to such a big audience.
Sounds like the earth just needs to up it's game, I'm eating meat, so that's that
To the man who suggested weaponizing the meat allergy properties of Lonestar Ticks as a way to curb our beef intake, I'd like to remind you that we as a species are more than capable of bringing back executions and many cultures of antiquity were _creative_
Save beef for holidays, pork and chicken are cheap enough. Reduce how much you eat, not the quality of your diet. Most Americans could stand to lose 20lbs anyways.  Another solution to the red meat conundrum is to encourage more hunting. Deer herds in the US are pretty healthy and a single good sized doe is enough to feed a family of four for a couple months. Bambi lives off of nature's bounty in the woods already so no muss no fuss carbon wise.  Personally I refuse to give up meat because I disbelieve the efficacy of a vegan diet. No amount of climate change doomsaying, accurate or no, is going to sway me. Ancient vegetarian diets only work with the supplementing of fish, eggs, or diary into an already legume heavy diet. No naturally occuring plant or combination therein can fully support the nutritional needs of a human adult. The combination of nixtamalized corn, beans, and rice comes close but ultimately lacks essential nutrients that are commonplace in even the worst cut of meat.   Veganism is a scam but don't stuff your face.
*Sees a video about the effects of the meat industry. *Decides to never stop eating meat. Meatatarian: "This is the way."
Fuck this. Unsubscribed.
However— buying locally can help support businesses that promise to practice sustainability. As well as building better relationships with the suppliers which can hold them accountable. The change isn’t direct but it is systemic.
USA has the highest emission per capita , so it is really important for us citizens to live a greener and healthier life. Great video
If you eat 1gram of enriched uranium I hear you'll never need to eat again
0:00 that perfectly cooked chicken look so good.  wait.. something feels wrong.
Simple, less beef, more pork.
One thing I'd like to see kurzgesagt do is offer up some insight into meat alternatives such as lab grown meat   Currently, it's pathetic and not good at all but if it's able to mimic meat, that would be a nicer alternative, it wouldn't be an animal emitting methane nor would animals be hurt in the process.   I'm not sure why that argument didn't make it into the video but I wish it had because it would have been an interesting alternative to having to go "veggie/vegan," which imo, felt like the message being pushed at the end. It, to me, felt partially like an opinion without the usual "opinion time" notice we get.
The solution now should be unsubsidizing meat products. If people had to pay the true price of meat, including the cost of habitat destruction and carbon emission, there would naturally be less of a demand for such an expensive product. Meat, especially beef, should be considered a luxury item, not an everyday treat. Once upon a time, animals could only be consumed regularly be the wealthy. We should go back to this mindset of consuming animals on celebratory occasions. Should reduce food waste as well.
Cows are the best source for milk 🥛 but camels 🐪 is a better meat source, in my opinion at least.
Can you please talk about the difference between carbon emissions/CO2  and greenhouse gas emissions/ methane as these have different effects and come from different origins it's getting hard having to explain how solar panels and wind power only helps with CO2 and not methane.
4:19 Does this mean hatred towards container ships is misplaced? They burn lots of fuel, but also transport proportionaly many more goods over larger distances.
Hi I was hopping you could tell me what would happen if you explosively separated the quarks in a atom?
What about lab-grown meat?
Im a fan since 2013
Use me as a dislike button.
Hi
I know another way to reduce carbon emisions by eating something...  EAT.  THE.  RICH.
Imagine Earth Get floaded and sudently human main food change to Fish is that still count as meat being worst for the enviroment?
So I've been trying to get as balanced of an opinion as possible on this topic, which is, impossible. I do appreciate the effort. my questions, time stamp:3:33 that * while existing I strongly appreciate, it being needed feels iffy being the worst(of the best), especially since you just stated how beef is the worst meat, so you basically said "the worst of the best vegetables is better than the best of the worst meats", while it may be true it doesn't feel like a balanced comparison especially sine who draws those lines? for the meat ok by animal makes sense but for the vegetable? its extremely unclear .Don't get me wrong, I want you to tell me meat bad, vegan good. but when in order to do so you need to use misleading analysis it under minds the trust of the narrative. I rather hear a true "the optimal solution is just not possible with meat", than "meats not good*". I will admit I'm probably caring to much, but I generally really love a lot of your work and I want it to be the gold standard for fact videos. For what ever reason on this topic alone the channel while MORE BALANCED THAN MANY often branded alternative opinion style groups, for a facts for the learning because learning is fun,to me at least, it reads like you struggles with neutrality on this one.This isn't the only part that felt off and made me want to double check(and trust me I'm the type that double checking these type of thing is what I do for fun, it's why I watch "educational" youtube more or less exclusively). quick scan of the comments I think some one pointed out the forest to co2 comparison one side being per1 year vs the other per 100 making it misleading but I'm not going to double check that because I'm clocking out here 3:33. To not end on a more positive note, regardless of all that said animation wise this channel ranks #1 for me, general facts for facts sake you still rank in my top 5, which as I said since that is all I do, is not to bad.
I see kurzgesagt i hit like
How about we, as a species, stop reproducing like roaches. If human beings just controlled their population growth, this wouldn't be an issue.
I usually like these videos but this one is missing a lot info. I hope it was not on purpose.
Men who eat soy-based protein (ie tofu) as a staple of their diet as replacement for animal protein are inevitably emasculated and low testosterone individuals. This concept that people need to go vegan is a complete joke, your ancestors were not vegan. Individual sacrifice will not stop climate change, only stopping mass use of coal and fossil fuels and general corporate practices will.
I'm really hoping that efficiently grown vat-made beef will become a reality soon.  And take away my guilt.
Eating meat (and animal products) seems ridiculous. Killing animals, destroying the planet and living an unhealthy lifestyle just because we can....I find no sensible justification
U forgot to mention that cows recycle Methane from air to soil and don't add any extra footprints and cows that gets artificially fed does emit footprints. Also a lot of things are dependent on by-products from cows. Large part from crops aren't digestible by humans and cows turn useless goods into useable goods, otherwise it gets burned and I don't think that good either. Everything's a double edged sword, but if you remove cows, you remove an enormous part culture and recipes.
but wait, dosen't it mean if its not localy sourced it also has to be drived to your house? we don't all live on the cost so how would that work? even airplanes don't immediately go to your house.
A world were we cant eat animals is a world not worth living in.
Honestly...The only answer is LESS HUMANS...
Climate change was one of the reasons I went vegetarian lol
comparing co2 emission of animals and plant will be always on the favor of the plants cause they exhale co2 GOOD JOB
Imagine not being vegan in 2021
Yeah nah Im gonna go vegan
Nah
I was born hating meat, I don’t know how or why, I think I was just born a vegetarian (though I do eat eggs).
I love this push towards actually caring about our environment/animals we're seeing in the educated!
Vegan teacher will be angry for this
It’s honestly shocking how much people said Kurzgesagt is wrong but brought up entirely different topics that video isn’t supposed to cover and called it misleading.
So, technically,is human fault for causing this event. And yet many people said that beef not just ruin us but also the planet. We,people really need a better way of mass production of beef. It's the main reasons it killing our planet,I think.
I better die in cloud of CO2 rather than stop eating meat.  Scientists better discover some profitable chemical reaction in which CO2 is involved so we start to use it and after 50 years of such usage  Kurzgesagt will do a video about CO2 shortage :D :D :D
I have a question what about the future do they bioengineering cows or make meat cows that not hurt cows
To be clear, Vegan is not natural - it will kill your kids if you force it on them. Vegetarianism is fine, great even.
Yes.
I fart much less when I eat meat/veggies only.
YOO #3 ON TRENDING
Let me guess, the writers are vegan
You will eat ze bugs.
Good information. I do wish you did add ethical reasons not to eat animals though.
Nice job with the comparison bars at 9:35, great way to deceive your audience into thinking the impact of going vegan is much higher than it truly is.
Honestly, if there ever vegans wanted to share a video to get people to cut back on meat, this would be it...  You know, rather than yelling at them...
I have never seen a dairy cow feeding on mountain outcrops. Ha! I'm glad to see a better-researched approach to this topic with more recent references. I'm glad I bought the Immune book now. :-)
watching while eating hot dogs, lets goooo
Oh boy so I love meat 😏😏
Appreciate the video greatly, though one 'error' of omission that is significant and should merit mentioning. You did take the time to mention how much of the crops we grow is used for feeding animals, but what is missing is that a significant amount of this feed is agricultural byproduct which is inedible to humans. And therefore a huge amount of feed given is, with respect to our current food sources, unavoidably produced and would have been completely wasted without being used to feed cattle.
FINALLY they made a video properly demonstrating that going 100% plant based is the best option without some bullshit about "oh you should just reduce your red meat consumption"
1:14 That' one's not unavoidable. Vertical farming can reduce land use.
They looked at grass fed but they didn't look at grass fed, grass finished, regeneratively raised ruminants which is carbon negative, and much better for the animals and environment then destroying the ecosystem in order to make an organic farm.
no.
where is fish amongst 'meat'? or do you buy the religious argument that fish is not meat?
When Kurzgesagt gets ideological. [sigh] Can we please leave the climate change religion out of our science discussions?
POV: Me eating my mcnuggies while watching this and feeling called out
One of the best ways to meet up the protein demand and reduce carbon emissions is mushroom. The problem we will face with all the leftover straws from rice, wheat or corn production can all be used as substrate for mushroom production. Best part of mushroom is that it is all protein and no fat.
I ate chicken wings while watching this instead of giving it a dislike /s  (I rarely dislike any video, but I *was* eating chicken wings while watching it)
I got a feeling this video didn't ask farmers for their opinions on this matter.
"..Meat really that bad?"  Vegans: eating animals is wrong, Kurzqesaqt. Hurting animals is wrong, Kurzqesaqt...
Eating animals because they're less intelligent is just ableism.
"If we could live happy and healthy lives without harming others, why wouldn't we?"
I prefer fake meat
Make a carbon emissions doomsday prediction video please.
All I’m hearing is more reason to terraform Mars and switch to nuclear energy
I can eat more chicken, this is the maximum amount of compromise my meat-lover brain can make
thinking about the guy they made animate a cow farting 💀
I came for the health benefits of steak not no damn history on emissions
Good lord another one? Kurzgesagt really be proud of the research on this topic huh
I wonder how fishing plays a part in this.
What are we gonna do with Kurzgesagt when the narrator decides to retire? 🧐
The video is quite well made and really quite smart but the biggest question isn’t the effect it has on the environment, but the effect it has on the human body.  You covered other forms of protein, which is great, but what about iron and other minerals.  Aside from that how about those who’s body can’t even eat most plant bases matter.  Also what about the matter of some food having negative chaloric value which means you would literally starve to death while eating it.
finaly a new vid
With that thumbnail it feels like infographics show video
People: We can eat meat!  Also people: NO we should eat veggies  Me: *Food is Food*
I appreciate the focus on emissions but what about things like water usage, overuse of antibiotics, etc.? I think that would put meat in an even worse position.
beef stonks
nice
Short answer: yes. It’s that bad.
Cant wait to see vegan teacher arguing with this man we need to bring our popcorn
i miss the dislike button, not that i would dislike this video but boy that was the first thing i look
Don’t eat meat! Do it for the planet, Do it for the animals, Do it for yourself
Eat insect they have meat and use little watoh
Correct me if I'm wrong, but i believe scientists were working on some sort of method to reduce methane produced in cows (I believe it was bacteria that consume the methane)
man imagine a video that these guys make on lightning, like to try and harness the power of lightning instead of burning wood, coal etc. Like that would be so cool xd
Uploading this video right after the downvote button is gone 😂
why not grow the beef in labs or something
I heard of a study were they gave seaweed and found that it got rid of around 90% of the methane from stuff like I think burping, it is best to look for it but I believe scyshow did a video about it
I recommend going vegan 7 days per month. It isn’t completely meat free, but it helps.
A good vid for the approaching of Chirstmas and the new year 12,022
For feeding the animals - how much of the crops being fed to animals would actually be able to be used by humans? Eg, for soy beans, I read that they mostly feed the animals the peels that nobody would buy anyway. I ran the numbers on the cost of it, and if cows were fed nothing but soy beans as we would, by the bushel, then the meat industry would be running at a massive loss. This doesn't add up.
I chose to look at the point that meat is a naturally occurring superfood. If we take what is naturally available to us that is surely the best way to live with nature.
Isn't there something called plant-based beef that tastes just like real beef? Why don't we all eat that.
That doesn’t make sense surely the amount of fuel it takes to bring avocades from port to the the shops is the same as from the butchers to home aswel
Quality and health of yourself of the meat also should of been mentioned instead of grass fed cows are counter productive
Great video, still gonna eat meat.
I love meat and I will never stop eating meat, change my mind
I stopped eating beef after your last video on this topic. Nice to watch this video and feel like I'm doing my part, even if it doesn't matter in the big picture.
A&W is a lie.
What about folks in western countries change their eating habits? I barely can afford meat and cannot consume too much even if I want to.
How did you take 12 minutes and 8 seconds to say "No"?
My family eat wild deer on the bush block we own and the deer are pests for new Zealand where I live
Wake up babe, Kurzgesagt posted
The most key point I have not yet seen in the video is water. for one POUND of beef it takes approximately 1,847 gallons of water.
After reading the promissed neverland, I think differently about mass production farms, gee the stuff of nightmares, I feel horrible about it but I also eat meat, how cruel but we can't do much
so we got to eat all the cows to reduce carbon?
Sounds like the best option is to give up on considering cows animals and instead treat them as a methane production machine we can eat when it wears out and get rid of grazing lands all together replacing them with the crops to power our "meat machines" and use the methane for electricity to run the facility.  I think we just found a D&D level answer for having our (beef)cake and eating it too...  Just stop feeling!

I recommend watching 'Eating Less Meat Won’t Save The Planet’ and 'Are Cows really Bad for the Planet? Why did we start blaming them?' from the YouTube channel What I've Learned  I'm not much of a meat eater, but I do think it's important and essential to have meat in our diet. Liver for instance is a great source of multiple vitamins which are easily absorbed into our bodies because of its bio-availability in comparison to plant nutrients.
I'm literally eating a fat rare steak right now watching this and I'll continue to do so until I die. :)
I'm not surprised a channel that takes bill gates is money is wanting us to stop eating meat, all while the elites continue to gouge on it
“No other bodily pleasure is experienced multiple time ever day, and never gets old.  Wanna bet?
I will never stop eating meat. NEVER.
Isn't 4:40 misleading? It says shipping 1 kg of avocados from South America to Europe costs only 2.5 kg of CO2 emissions, while delivering beef from your local butcher to your home costs 18 kg. Yeah, but how about delivering avocados from the local market to your home?
So it’s all Salt Bae’s fault
Yuo*
3:07 a bird is barbequing meet of a cow that was once a friend of those in the background. What a terrifying image
looking back to around 5-6 years ago, hes improved a lot!
There really is no good reason to not be vegan.
To anyone curious, check out the regenerative agriculture farms here in the states, white oak pastures is a good one. They're more efficient at producing meat and they're actually carbon negative because of the topsoil rejuvenation.   The video also doesn't take into account the health ramifications of long term veganism and the emissions used by the health care industry. And before anyone starts with the red meat kills you argument, there is absolutely ZERO evidence in the literature that shows a causative link between red meat and heart disease or cancer. It's all epidemiological food frequency survey nonsense with a hefty dose of confounding factors that would never stand in any other field of science. No one knows what diet will lead to longevity, because that would require sets of identical twins locked into metabolic wards for life with every factor tightly controlled, which will never happen. We can see the short to medium health ramifications of meat versus plant based diets though, and with healthy user bias removed there is a clear winner, the diet we've adhered to throughout the vast majority of our evolutionary history, one comprised mainly of animals, as the stable nitrogen  isotope testing has found in every ancient hominid population.
Poor cows. Think about it: Cows give us beef. Burgers, steak etc. Cows give us milk. Cows give us cheese. Cows give us soil fertilizer. And what do we give them in turn? Death.
Im vegan because I want plants to suffer
It sucks that a morally good option may harm the environment more and the morally wrong option gets to roam free because money and human success also if we want to change a lot of humans would choose not to or refuse to believe
Ah yes, great addition to everyone’s diet The helper T cell 9:44
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old” 12 year olds in the comments: wanna bet
Who doesn't love cereals anyway? They make beer!
Yes, the meat industry is vile and downright disturbing. BUT that is the consequence of the industrial revolution. When you have to feed 7 billion people, things will be gross and cruel
You forgot to tell us the emissions for Lab Grown Meat!
I guess, but it tastes good 👍
Because i cant see the dislikes i dont know how much people disagree with this stuff
Love meat.  Bite me vegans
i’ve been vegan for 3 years with dairy and egg product consumtion on occausion but no meat for 3 years and i have to say you lose taste for meat and meat alternatives are actually good. trust me i was never a salad guy, haven’t touched one since like 4-5 years ago
kurzgesagt: we would probably last till 2100 even if we got rid of all of the other carbon producers me: ok so i wont live that long so that seems pretty solid
Did you know that the Amazon rainforest releases nearly 2 billion tons of Co2? But it also takes in many more billions from the atmosphere. We are only looking at one side of the coin. Food emissions are unavoidable.  Don’t fall for fossil fuel propaganda. Let us focus on the real problem- energy and transport emissions.  All this talk about veganism is just a ploy to stir up the argument and create disunity between people who would otherwise agree on things like artificially accelerated climate change.
I still eat meat, because my life generates 0,00000000001% co2 and planet don`t care about my sacrifice.
B E E F  S T O N K S
I don’t understand how people are ok with k!lling other animals in order to eat them when they don’t have to, yes if you do it yourself and you grow cows and pigs ok but for the rest it’s messed up.
Yes I've been waiting to see another vid so I can eat happily while I'm on online class lol
something that could help is having people eat until 70-80% full, not overfull
What we need is more animals, and a lot less people.
This is why I hope for lab-grown meats to be successful. No need to change your diet, no animal cruelty, (likely) much less climate problems. Unfortunately it's probably not a realistic wish, much like fusion power. In the meantime, stuff like the Impossible Burger might be the best option for us burger fanatics. I still need to try those...
MEAT GANG 👍✌️😋
BEEF STONK BEEF STONK BEEF STONK     beef stonk
Birds eating birds
If only vegans actually argued with this information instead of emotional platitudes. The food debate might actually be tolerable if that were the case.
I cant live without food
OMG! I wasn't ready for that fart-o-meter. :'D
Could you make a video about lab grown meat?  It seems to be a miracle fix to this entire problem, eat the same thing with barely any of the consequences anymore
Is Meat Really that Bad? it is not about meat, but about yourself instead.
I like how this channel is not talking about chinas smog cloud :/ that covers the entire country
Love how the monkey in the intro is always holding something different based on the video topic.
"Even if you find the most environmental friendly beef in the world, your burger still comes with a significantly higher carbon footprint, than a veggie patty, you can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information"  let that sink in, you are only as big as the decisions you make whether selfless or selfish !
Time to redeem yourself kurzstgiggle
biden out here using all his decreasing brain power to memorize the lines of that speach
If consuming meat gives you more energy than consuming fruits or vegetables then we'll have to plant a lot more fruits and vegetables which in turn uses up a lot more land..... Correct me if I'm wrong but I think you're missing the point. So we have 79 years to stop eating meat and only eat fruits and vegetables? But not just your subscribers everyone on the planet. Which in turn will use up more land for crops. There's only one way to fix this and that is to cut the human population by 3/4..... Bring on the heart attack because I think I'm sticking with my double cheeseburger with bacon!
Look I get that Grass Fed Beef is still worse than the worst plant, I still feel like it's better solution overall. Meat consumption won't ever go no matter how much education there is to prove otherwise. The Western World has created this Vegan culture that's placed their most stuck-up, smuggest, narcissistic individuals at the forefront to guilt those us us who still enjoy eating beef, chicken, and pork. This Vegan/vegetarian culture has done little favors to convincing us to reconsider our eating habits.  It's those people have turned me off from even considering substitutes for meat. Now with that said, I just feel like grass-fed beef sourced locally can go a much longer way regardless. I know it isn't perfect but it's still better solution in my opinion. We're also on the verge of 3-D printing meat as well and perhaps that might be where the real future might be. I would get behind that if it meant putting an end to current Vegetarian/Vegan culture. At the very least, the vegetarian culture needs to rethink their strategy and MUTE THEIR VOCAL MINORITY.
Scrolled down to see my fellow lovers of food sounding off about the intro and there is a LOT of us in here. Hi Y'all!
i will still eat meat at the same pace im doing right now im not going to reduce the amount of steak im eating
I find this as political... I hate when they do this shit.. Go woke go broke..
I began my transition down to only 2 types of meat and substituted all others with tofu based ones as of the last couple weeks, so this video is in eerily good timing, but I would've liked for you to directly conclude on which meats are the best rather than just providing raw data and focusing almost exclusively on cattle.
I’ll wait to switch to fully vegetarian (or vegan) diet once it becomes possible to almost perfectly emulate the taste of non-vegan foods
What about telling China and Latin American countries to stop using carbon and natural gas as an energy source? Wouldn’t that reduce CO2 much less than stop eating meat?
I'll go on a vegan diet when vegan food doesn't taste like shit
Isn't cattle feed the parts of crops that they can't sell to humans? So they aren't growing crops to feed cattle.
Kurzgesagt: Veggie Burger Me: Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner!
Nice to see Kurzgasagt promoting the corporate lie of “personal responsibility” when it comes to climate change. Especially after they just had a video pointing out that the personal responsibility angle was created by corporations. Maybe if the energy production and shipping emissions from corpos actually get dealt with, the food production emissions won’t matter, wow shocker.
Uh so this is why mean is starting to be grown in labs..
i like the new intro, and that monke
I wonder tho about the health topic of meat. What is better for our health? A vegetarian diet, or one with meats?
Yeah...meat isn't the optimal option.  But plants have the opposite problem.  Meat is a really inefficient way of producing and concentrating the nutrients we need.  The process is slow, it's an extra collection of steps to the whole process, and it does have some environmental issues resulting from all that. . But plants can't do the job alone as they are. . There is no such thing as a "superfood".  Nature doesn't do that...ever.  Also, even the "ancient grains" or other stupidity that people go on about, are all genetically-modified crops.  They weren't modified in a lab, but there's literally nothing, in the entire world, that anyone eats (even tribal peoples), that has not been thoroughly altered by direct human interference.  Not one thing anyone eats today, is a product of nature.  Period. . But, all that cross-breeding and controlled breeding, isn't enough.  we do have to tamper directly with genes to get the results we'll inevitably need.  And not just with the food, but ourselves.  It must happen, or the do-gooders must accept sentencing hundreds of millions of people to death.
Thank you so much just thank you, you are an inspiration to all
We need a whole movie with these animations
Meat isn't even that tasty!!!! Just fat/salt/spices that makes it tasty. Leave animals the fck alone!
meat is nice
😍😍😍😍 love your videos, you are not afraid to show the harsh truth 🌱
So the average American consumes 25 kg of beef a year. In the US beef only produces 22 kg of CO2 equivalent per kg - no deforestation for beef production in US. So the average American produces 550 kg of CO2 equivalent per year from beef consumption.  This is only one 6-hour plane ride per year, or driving 3.5 miles per day in a gas vehicle. Less than 12 miles per day in an electric vehicle. I think context is important.
OMG cant believe Kurzgesagt finally dare to say the plain truth about Beef and animal products. a bold step for this Giant of Science Diffusion. Great Video Congrats!
Basically, eating less meat is objectively better for the environment. But, god is soo hard.
OK so what I'm hearing is that reducing meat intake will help the environment. I choose to read this as eliminating meat eaters allows me to eat meat. Time for purge the big mac edition
haha people can't even wear a piece of cloth around their faces. doubt they'll lift a single finger more
Once lab grown meat becomes economically viable at a large scale, how much better would it be?
It is really hypocritical that North America and Europe, after having devastated their native forest in the past, blame Brazil (like this video) for not preserving its native forests. As a comparison, Brazil has about 66% of its territory preserved as native forest, while USA has 20% (data from 2017). Europe had 7% of all native forest in the planet, nowadays it's got only 0,1%. Brazil's 66% of preserved native forest is equivalent to the total territory of all  European Union countries combined. So, of course Brazil should do an even better job at preserving its native forest, however it is really hypocritical to see North America and Europe playing the "good guys" after what they have done to their own forests in the past.
I missed two things explained. First: Since plant food has less nutrition density than meat, how much more land is needed to be turned into farmland to compensate for the present meat production, if all changed their diet from meat to a plant based. Second: How many animals (then useless domesticated and wildlife) must die in such a scenario, because we can have no competition to a said plant based society
The bird eating corn at the start is adorable
Cellular agriculture could turn the whole food paradigm on its head and make conventional agriculture look archaic.
Long term solution: *STOP HAVING CHILDREN.* Cutting the world's population in half (specially in US, Europe, and China), would significantly reduce emissions.
No, the best thing about being alive is your videos.
I will do expressly nothing. I love beef.
Somehow number 3 sounds like cliche anime title 7:15
Excellent video on one of the world’s most crucial yet avoided topics
Yeah, and all that good shit, BUT:  IS IT NOT TIME, Dear Kurgesaght, to DO ONE ON THE FALSE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, EXPOSING THE FRAUDULENT NONSENSE FOR WHAT IR IS: The new deal to CONTROL THE WORLD?
I could definitely go without beef for the rest of my life. Honestly, I prefer fish. But, from what I understand, that has its own set of problems- not to mention economic difficulties for myself. Much easier on the mind to buy fast food than to try and buy good fish.
We need to stop using fertilizers and grow food naturally and locally. No more mega farms.  Meat also needs to be raised locally and in a more natural way.
Dang. I didn’t even think about that. I’ll definitely try and lower my meat intake
I'll have to remember to try the veggie alternative burger next time I eat out, but overall, you're not going to be able to convince the world to turn Vegan or even vegetarian. I wish this video had proposed some practical solutions at the end. Personal choice to quit eating meat especially beef, is an option, but it shouldn't be the only one.
well, since dislike count are no longer a thing... *USE ME AS DISLIKE BUTTON*  i'll elaborate in the replies later

Oh no! Bad beef stonks
did i hear the hoi4 naval thing at 4:20
iv started eating a lot less meat and when i can use it instead of real meat i use impossible meat
pescatarianism…?
Switching to sheep would make a difference. They are the most versatile animal to have. Also a complete food Forrest system would supply many families locally. The key is diversity and efficiency. Working with nature not against it.
Meat is the best food. And I intend to eat it. Put some aluminium in space for shade control and climate solved.  Also, fusion would be nice, then we can capture carbon better than plants.
I'm getting me a big ass burger for dinner
You need a Netlix series!!!
I would stop eating beef if the veggie burgers were just as cheap I know they taste the same and all that scientists tried there hardest to make them the same as hard as possible except in the manufacturing cost
The reality is it isn't up to us to sort out garbage and fucking eat insects
Something important to point out is the "best" beef in regards to climate change is from factory farming. Hell on earth. There are inseparable ethical issues with animal products. After all, meat was someone's body. Milk is breastmilk from a new mother meant for her child - cows don't just leak milk constantly for no reason. And the genetic modifications we make (whether through natural selection or direct modification) have detrimental side effects to their health. Cows suffer from how large their utters have been forced to grow now. Chickens bred for meat break their bones as a regular occurrence under their own body weight.
I have to say, I have extreme doubt that methane that comes from cow burps and farts is a significant factor in changing atmospheric conditions. Animals have been around for ever, burping and farting this whole time, so I doubt that they are the reason. However, what we have done to destroy the earth through burning and cutting down forests seems like a much more plausible answer.
Next will you analyze the amount of emissions we produce when consuming the internet? Consider everything from the minerals in our phones, to finding an Uber and trading crypto.

This channel is a great source of useful information, and all for free. Thanks to all the Kurzgesagt team!
♥ Love what you do, Kurzgesagt ♥ -- but not so much this video's description.  Every passenger on Spaceship Earth should know the most delicious food ain't meat, but rather strawberry / lingonberry / huckleberry waffles topped with Nutella.
Ok so if I understood this correctly... we're fucked. Good to know.
I definitely think Hartman is trying to prove he can be a better Jew then Kyle.  Its pretty much it's life work to destroy kyle.
YES thank you for not hedging around the truth like so many others! This is so important.
moo
been beef-free for 16 years, best decision of my life also, out of curiosity, how does fish and other seafood stack up to this?
This seems to vastly underconsider how emmissions from food waste, primarily vegan food waste, account for more emissions than livestock. Lets also not forget how much resources a vegan diet requires, mainly water and land. Rice alone accounts for over 1% of global emissions, which is half of the global emissions that planes account for
Many things in the video are wrong. For example, buying locally produced meat it will always be better because even if transportation by truck creates more CO2 emissions you still need those same truck to transport the meat to ports and from them.
I mean hey, if it tastes like meat, gives me all the nutrients I need, and I don’t know, I’m totally fine to not eat real meat.
Anyone see that Girus at 9:45?
I'm going vegan now guys.
Can't we just grow lab meat? We have proven it many times and some people have done it at home. It just need to be made more efficient and cheaper for a larger market.
Thank you
In India we have beef ban due to religious reasons, never thought it could be environmentally friendly.
Meat is a good source of protein so its healthy in a way, but is also unhealthy in other ways
Yeah, I'm not giving up meat or beef anytime soon.
Answer: Unfortunately yes, specially beef.
Stop having babies! It isn't that hard! We could solve this issue really easily by literally doing nothing. And it would be free.
I think our over consumption of beef contribute to this high CO2 emission. Chicken an pig don't carry much because they are easily to grow. However, the real take is more on political side than what we human made. Also, while the study of CO2 emission is a little flaw in my opinion, it's still show that cow production is difficult and consume a lot of resources.
I mean hey, if animals didn't want to be eaten, why would they be made out of food?
09:46 why is there a T-cell at the left side of the screen?
I always find it bizarre when meat is represented by happy animals. If you watch slaughterhouse footage the cows there are certainly not happy with comical hearts in their eyes. They're begging for their lives and ultimately are brutally murdered and chopped up into pieces. Some pigs are boiled alive in high production. No matter how carbon neutral you try to make meat, it will always be unethical. For what is the "right" way to kill someone who doesn't want to and doesn't NEED to die? After all, we do not need animal products. The JAND as well as many other highly credible nutrition orgs already found that scientifically. Needless meat is cruel and unnecessary.
LOL I thought they meant is it really that bad for the factory farmed cow/bull.
I’m watching this while I’m eating XD
Thank you for this informative video, I really appreciate the non-biased documentation that goes into these videos and I find them very helpful.
If I'm being honest, I love steak. It's really easy and affordable at a scale that my social class bracket hasn't seen in history. The crux of this is that replacing things like meat and animal fats with tofu/carbs/seed oils is inherently worse for a person. The only way I will stop eating as I do would be force, and it would be to my detriment if it happened. If laws are passed for this, I just hope it's something where maybe they put more incentive on lamb chops and turkey burgers. The scenarios where it becomes all soy and bugs is a slave diet.
I had a question about a particular point that was raised as to what contributes to much of the carbon footprint of beef: which was the clearing of lands and the resulting effects of that. So my question is: what about the massive clearing of lands for soy/corn farms? Much of South America is experiencing this, and there are many mono-crop farms in America that are much larger than animal farms.
What I learned: For the love of god, plant more trees.
U ALREADY COVERED THIS TOPIC
What about crop residues such as hay from wheat?
I mean the whole food being a big cause of Co2 could be drastically reduced if the population stopped growing. Somehow that is controversial though and we all have to sacrifice quality of life rather than just having fewer children.
I love fake news ❤️
People are not guilty for eating meat. I hate it when we guilt trip the regular people when the big companies are the only ones to blame.
love how there is like no arguing going on in the comments
Yeah guys, nothing really sounds like saving the planet to me more than unsustainable petrochemical based plant monoculture that barrenizes land and destroys microbes, insects, and native plants. Fuck off with this shit, of course meat isn't totally sustainable, ~nothing~ in our current lifestyle is. People clearly don't care about the climate, nor do they care about nature, nor do they care about anything except themselves; more cynically, and this includes first world protests like this, they only care about one thing, that which makes them feel good. Food, art, singing, whatever, none of these choices are what will help us out. Natural selection will rear its head again I'm sure, and we as individuals largely cannot overcome ourselves to actually do meaningful good. Renewable energy is one, because it itself is disgustingly pollutive, including chemically so, compared with dropping out of all electricity, which is the true solution.  People will go to any length or gymnastically technological solution to avoid the basic incompatibility of our overpopulated-and-fossil-fuel-driven dilemma. Want to actually fight climate change? Go live in the woods, eat the forest's products, and forgo electricity, modern medicine, supply chains, and everything else entirely... but most people won't, and even if they wanted to, they couldn't. The earth simply does not provide for this many human mouths in her natural state. So we break the natural order, fuck with the geology, and then somehow cry "oh no how could this happen?" when shit hits the fan.   This channel has its moments, and I love it. Sorry for the rant. I'm sure very few will even read it, but same goes for every other warning sign out there.
The premise of "meat is bad" is unproven and flat out incorrect to begin with.
so so so so angry how you put up such crap!! never thought you would do this
first video ive ever disliked :(
my only reaction for ppl who dont eat meat cuz of moral reasons: "its how the world works"
9:35 Yikes, fox news graph vibes from this comparison. It's still a big impact even comparing year to year, why mislead?
Bullshit. This whole thought process of thinking of emissions as "carbon footprint" makes no sense because it's less than the sum of its parts. 10 kilograms of beef produced and shipped to an end consumer emits less than producing 1 kilogram and shipping it 10 times. That's, of course, assuming that you don't think beef itself emits kilograms of CO2 like this video kindly puts it.  Also, the narrative seems to spin it around like *you're* guilty for climate change. You're not.  What does it matter if you eat vegan food when burning fossil fuel is the leading cause of emissions? When there are hundreds of millions of vehicles burning fuel all at the same time? When coal power plants emit volumes of a swimming pool per second?  This individual approach to climate change assumes everyone will go vegan and cut beef out of their diet. They're not going to. I'm not going to. Call me whatever the fuck you want, if i didn't buy that steak someone else would have.
sorry going to keep eating beef!
DISAPPOINTED!!!   BADLY RESEARCHED VIDEO!!!
One huge problem with this video is that Kurzgesagt isn't neutral.  They believe that being vegan is the best way, buy the truth is that it's such a complex matter, you can't summarise it in a 12 minute video. For example they said that 19% soy is for human use. But you can't use 100% off the plant for humans. You extract the oil (20% of the weight from the plant) the rest, the soy waste,  is used to feed animals.  So very little of the total soy plant production is only used for cattle.
Nothing will solve this issue effectively until we can sequester the carbon remove it from the air with new tech.
Lots of people don't know this but 20% of all palm oil and 89% palmseed oil is used for production animals. It binds their food into pellets. Even more rainforest can be saved.
@A&W
From the people who brought you "just lobby for a Green New Deal": "carbon cycles don't offset livestock emissions."
i'll just eat Tempe then
Maybe you should cover topics like energy consumption and CO2 emissions of useless social media apps that, unlike meat, don't provide you with necessary nutrients?
Sucks that humanity will be dead right around I turn 40. Least I got 20 years left. We really did fail, and it's sad that we couldn't find some alternative. Maybe it's for the best, it is our fault.
It took a large carbon footprint to even get to the point of thinking of carbon emissions in the first place. The carbon footprint it takes to stream this video on to your phone takes more carbon emissions than a decade of cow farts. We’re gonna invent super A.I. Plants 🌱 that’s gonna use the carbon to power the quantum processors… it’s gonna suck it all up and poop energy and 3D print stem cells at 98.34% the speed of light… watch
stupid title, guys!    is it really that bad?  makes it sound liek it is bad,!  its blooody the best thing for u!
Speaking as the world’s worst vegan, I’d also like a second part to this video about the welfare of the animals and the effect on your health. I’ve nearly finished the Immune book and know a bit more about inflammation now - but how do animal products cause inflammation? What are the consequences?
I personally believe beef production should be limited and that people should eat less of beef as a whole. Not eliminate it. Just lessen the amount. variation in diet is extremely important and having more variation than just beef will also help lessen the massive emissions.
Going full vegan may save the world, but it comes at a health cost.  Can't we all settle for beef no more than 3 times a week? It's a healthy win-win mid point.  Also, don't have more than 1 child, 2 tops.  Preferably none.
Make less freaking people. Let half of us die of old age or whatever else and then 1 kid per family.
I'll become vegetarian when Africa, Asia and all the developing American states will implement a one child policy.
Short answer: no
9:33 Is a really dumb chart. It is comparing yearly emitted to saved over the course of 100 years. If we produce about 50 B tonnes per year for a 100 years it be 5000 Billion tonnes emitted over the same amount of time as the top graph shows. That should’ve been what was on screen or another way to show it is that over 100 years it would remove 8 B tonnes of the 50 B we put into the air every year on average.
Holy this is gonna get really bad
This is making me hungry
Rather than forcing a stark choice between vegan or meat inclusive diets, what would be the impact of reducing meat consumption by 25% or 50%, or by 5% per year over the next decade? Or, what about going vegan 2 or 3 days a week?  How about reducing the world's massive food waste problem or reducing caloric intake in countries where overeating is a health crisis?  These seem more reasonable than the hard line imposition of veganism.
Oh no I hear her she's coming it it's the Vegan Tea... PLANTS CAN'T FEEL PAIN!
BS. So I guess we eat those vegetables at the port they arrive at from around the world or do we drive them around to the store like the rest of our food. Let’s be honest here I’m not reducing shit until the high flyers hit the ground and live like the rest of us. Most of the world’s emissions are caused by the 10% at the top so let’s knock those assholes down to the level of the rest of us and then we’ll talk about changing diets. Love how the poor should change while the rich will think about it as they build their shelters and armies. WE ARE DOOMED BECAUSE THE WEALTHIEST WON’T LIVE LIKE THE REST OF US. So please stop because it’s not us which is causing climate change it’s you and your kind. Most of us barely survive let alone thrive.
The ethical considerations regarding needlessly harming animals are more than enough to settle the question.
"We emit Nitris Oxide when using fertilizer and manure" Car guys: *shits harder*
I love this channel, but I absolutely hate how it takes another video calling them out for them to become more nuanced and less political 🙄  The video being: Eating less meat won't save the planet. Here's why
This numbers also get so blowted cause americans trow away so much good meat, while in many other countries we eat most parts and organs
What I understand is that being Vegan or eating meet is the same, both harms the globe  so amma do em both :v
I learned this 4 years ago, it changed me, i do still eat meat (beef, pork chicken) but rarely, i tried to not buy much animal produce too 😊
This doesnt even include black markets, like the chinese, or third world countries.
So beef is bad, pork is better (but not good), and poultry is the best (and breaks even). Checks out. Though that said my diet is mostly fish (and chicken, with maybe a burger or bacon once or twice a month). I'm curious how fish and shellfish weigh in on this.
These types of videos will never reach the majority who aren't willing to have these conversations.
how would pescitarianism rank on the scales?
Imo meats are indeed delicious, but i prefer vegetable not that im a 'vegan' but you can get the same amount of nutrition from plants, and also it helps you poop
My favourite part about you're videos on controversial topics is hearing the words "its complicated"
The problem is, you choosing to eat less meat does nothing to the production of meat. The government would have to step in for there to be any change.
Just don't eat 4head, lmao.
I'm from Brazil and I feel so sad and ashamed for what's happening here. Jair Bolsonaro, the president, has a team that doesn't care AT ALL about it. Perhaps we never took enough care of the Amazon rainforest, but certainly with Bolsonaro we have the worst scenario. I just wanna say, as a Brazilian, that we don't share that view. Next year we have elections and we'll do what's possible for not electing politicians like him.
Love how you teach without being preachy about it. The animations don't hurt either of course :3
I don't agree with the factory methodology of animal harvesting, but I think meat is amazing and man's natural best source of nutrition. Specifically organ meats.
Your videos are so insightful! I learned so many things!!
I like meat, it tastes great. I definitely understand people's apprehension towards moving away from it, but the one thing I love most in this world is humanity. I want our species to remain eternal and become a permanent prescence in this universe. I think the emotion based arguments of ethics and morality are asinine and irrelevant to this discussion; our preservation is the only criterion that matters. In all likelihood humanity will be the last organisms to go extinct from climate change, and it won't be for a very long time even if we do not get our act together, but the longer the Earth lasts the more time we have to make certain that we put ourselves into the position in which we can live forever. I think the personal freedom to eat the food which you desire is great, but you must assess the consequences. Luckily there are options to be considered that allow us to remove the agriculture of animals and still have access to meat. Lab grown meat is the only long term solution for those that don't want to cease eating meat, but the technology is still a ways away.
0:37  "Well it's complicated"    Mumbo Jumbo: It's quite simple actually!
I didn't got out of poverty to eat veggies, sorry.
Isn't this video a little to bias
Go Vegan!!!
wow 1.2 million people agreed this video is only likable.
I would love to see the comparison of vegan diet to hunting fish. As plants require huge amounts of land and water compared to grabbing a spear gun and shoot a wild fish. Btw I'm vegan but I'm convinced if I hunt my own food it's far better for the environment.
If our ancestors didn't eat meat we wouldn't have made it past the ice age
At 9:35, if my calculation is correct, it would take use 100 years to sequester 16 years worth of emissions by converting entirely to a vegan diet. That indicates to me that while overall lowering of livestock production (something that has little chance of happening in our lifetime) may help, it's still not nearly to address emissions. Especially as energy demand increases. We need to change the way in which we produce our food, not the way it's transported.
I feel like the people behind Kurzgesagt post suspiciously often considering the fact that their channel consists of high-quality animation and top-notch information... 🤔
b e e f s t o n k s
Meat is good for you in moderation. There used to be less people. Meat used to be eaten way less by those less people. This was part of the natural cycle of life. Now there are lots of people. Now we eat lots of meat with lots of people eating lots of meat, which is bad for the environment, and sometimes your health. Conclusion, remove people. Executing order 69421...
“No other bodily pleasure is experienced multiple times per day” Teenage Boys: *scoffs* oh yea?
I will consume the flesh!
YES ANOTHER KURZGESAGT VIDEO
Lab Grown meat to the rescue?
I think i'm going to leave youtube. maybe i'll come back when dislikes are re-enabled.
I´m Amazonian we´re created to eat almost everything that moves including snakes and piranhas
Bias is a great depriver of individual perspective.  On that note. Think i will have steak for dinner. 🐄🥩
Could we replace beef with lamb? I think people drink sheep's milk. They'd be good for wool as well. I think if we synthesize the perfect crop animal and just use that we could dedicate less resources to it. Or maybe just make livestock better at digesting food so they make less gas.
How do i spell your channel name
More CO2 means a greener planet. NASA has revealed that human-emitted CO2 has vastly helped plant life to flourish. I predict that in the future, CO2 emissions will be considered a benefit. After all, current CO2 atmospheric content is low compared to earlier eras, and the low current levels have coincided with an increase in desertification. All of the CO2 we emit was originally taken from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and then stored in the earth by geological processes. The photosynthesis occurred by solar energy - making fossil fuels naturally stored solar energy, and we are simply putting back into the atmosphere CO2 that was once naturally there. The very mild warming CO2 emissions cause is not harmful, and the "feedbacks" and "forcings" part of the alarmist theories are pure fantasy and already proven wrong by empirical evidence. We should not be afraid of a slightly warmer, much greener world. So eat your steaks. Drive your SUVs, fly often, and consume as much electricity as you like. Planet Earth will thank you.
i dont think the meat hate has much to do with diet as it does the industries that produce meat products
I am still curious about cultured meat, like lab grown beef. Why make the whole cow when I only need the steak.
I can think of a couple other enjoyable things that you can do multiple times a day that will never get old.  Err, well at least until you do.
Me who’s bulking and the eating ISS getting old 😭 😔
You too..
"When the last tree has been cut down, the last fish caught, the last river poisoned, only then will we realise that one cannot eat money."
I'm progressively switching to a plant based diet and I can really feel that it makes me feel healthier.  Meat has its pros, obviously, but there are things you can easily supplement to make even a vegan diet as healthy as a diet that includes meat (vitamin b12, D3 and Omega 3, mostly)
No, meat isn’t bad! Just for vegans.  I’m bassicly sokka 😀👍🏼
This is not complicated Kurzgesagt so I dont know why say it is. Starting off your video by saying its complicated creates an unfounded bias. You showed beyond a reasonable doubt the effect that animal products have on the environment.
You forgot to include the fact that red meat like beef is carcinogenic to humans, even moreso if it's been heavily processed. Smoking/grilling the meat makes it even more carcinogenic due to the compounds found in the smoke. So not only is it bad for our planet, it's bad for our bodies as well.
Hi guys just letting you know some facts  A well mangaed pastured fixes more carbone than a forest. Learn about racional pasture ,voison  Cows dont have peaks! so they dont have  a diggestive sistem for it.  YOur not counting the cO2 that is emited when making all fertilizers use to produce de grains.
Me: so basically the problem is food?  Kurzgesagt: yes, basically.  Me: so let's make humanity stop eating!  Kurzgesagt: wait no, that's not what i meant  Me: **in the corner starving to death** I'm helping the earth!
9:45 ferb where is my T-Cell?
I'll keep staying away from beef. Just sticking to fruits, grains, veggies, nuts, cereals, chicken and eggs
O yeah, Brazil bad. What a great idea, denying us farmland and staying poor forever. Only Europe and NA can extinguish their forests to make farmland.
I will go vegan when all the substitutes taste the same
Amazing video, great to spread awareness, but, when are you guys going to make a ring world video?
I like chicken nuggets so hopefully im some what good
Plant eaters eat more and fart a lot more than carnivores.
Very well presented--one thing missing is that "buying local" beef and other meat often involves going to a trusted butcher who has a relationship with local farmers, who are more likely to raise the cattle, et al., with better practices (giving the "high quality" meat that would show the 1/10x factor in emissions). Local farmers also don't have the capacity to over-produce like factory farms, so if all/most beef were local, there would generally be an increase in quality and a decrease in quantity; this should compound in benefits of reduced emissions and improved food enjoyment.  At least, this is my current understanding of localized agriculture as a butcher-going consumer, not an agricultural scientist.
I'd rather die 10 years early than go vegan.
This doesn't talk about inedible vegetable byproducts of agriculture like nut husks that are used to feed cattle. Agriculture gets significantly less efficient without livestock
I love how the writer/narrator concludes with a guilt free statement 😂
Now I crave steak!
I'm just bopping to the Kahoot! music remix.
I'd be curious to see your guy's take on Regenerative Agriculture and Holistic Planned Grazing. I'm convinced that it's the right step forward to solve our carbon emissions from the Agricultural Industry.
Hadn't eaten any steaks or burgers in the last year until Thanksgiving. Not because of climate change, and I still eat a lot of pork, chicken, and fish. It's because the price of beef has gone completely bonkers. Why would I pay $16 a pound for ribeye or $7 a pound for ground beef when pork and chicken can easily be found for under $2 a pound (on sale for the pork, whole chicken or legs/thighs I can get on sale at least once a month for 99 cents or less). If they want to charge 16 times more for a ribeye than they do a porkchop, I'm going eat 16 porkchops, thanks. Now for Thanksgiving, I made an 8 pound choice prime rib that was on sale for $6.99 a pound. That's value I can live with. Tuscan herb encrusted with a cabernet sauce. And it was exquisite.
8:33 he said my name. I was shocked😬😬        Damond
in terms of nutrition. meat is not bad. studies find that its the high amounts of saturated fat and preservatives in diet that lead to cancer not meat itself.
My dad loves me but beats me     I love meat
It’s quite ironic potatoes score pretty low on CO2 emissions, I happen to love potatoes! Boiled, slow cooked, mashed, smashed, fried, I just love potatoes! Saving the environment unintentionally with the power of potatoes!
As a vegetarian for over 20 years, I just find it weird that this video presumes that people want to meat and the whole goal should be to figure out how we can do it sustainably. Eating meat just does not appeal to me and if you could make it better for the environment to do so, I still wouldn't want to do it.
cows create hella methane
You just gotta love that they covered every aspect👌🏻 Also, that animation 🤩
‘
Veggie burger!? If I'm on a interstellar spaceship and that's the only thing on offer, I'll take it. But here on planet Earth, I'll pass.
I’m leaving a comment so the algorithm will recommend this to more people, this video needs to be seen by everyone
👎
If god did not want us to eat meat than why did he make them taste so good?
that vegan teacher before and after watching this video: Before: YESSSSS! After: WHAT THE **** IS WRONG WITH YOU!
All I read from reviews is that Skillshare is a scam. I'm sure they help YT channels out, but according to all the reviews they scam you, the customer, into a subscription and don't give refunds. Just saying..
Don't eat anything till u dead!   Problem solved
No. No it isn't
POV your eating tacos
Actually, chickens and pigs can be fed mainly food waste. Especially chickens, which you can feed bugs and stuff through compost.
9:44 HA! IMMUNE REFERENCE!
So then what is your answer for what to do with all those now unwanted cows? Unless it involves mass slaughter and near extinction of a domestic species, I don't see it changing anything. Also, just out of curiosity, how does Pork and Chicken compare if fed efficiently?
Me as a cannibal dislike this video
I never really liked beef the most, though it is good, but other meats like chicken are good
Thats horrible that we produce so much waste. Im gonna go make some pork chops to calm myself down
What about fish Co2 emissions?
Meat is literally all I eat. Going carnivore completely turned my health around for the better. I do try and eat grass fed as much as I can afford. Sadly I can't currently afford to buy meat from regenerative farms.
Porra Brasil
that vegan teacher just watch it
EAT MEAT AND BE EF HAPPY.
Remember Kurzgesagt,  *Nihilism baby*
ok so no more beef. Or better yet, I wont have kids.
watching this video while crying all over my burger and fries
Eat MEAT and never ever get Caries.
And when our worlds most intelligent scientists finally perfect lab grown meat it will be under the same nonsense contraversy as gmo's
Hello everyone
MEAT is the BEST thing in life.
I think it would have been useful to talk about average carbon footprints of various diets, for example the Mediterranean diet is renown for being much lower in emissions than the American diet for example.
Well your premise is wrong because CO2 is a lagging indicator not the driver of climate change.  You will soon find out in Germany as they turn off your fossil fuels just as  a little ice -age starts (lolz). You will be locked into your SMART cities and fed bugs and synthetic food.   People deserve it for believing all the lies.  It definitely has nothing to do with the magnetic excursion, the changing jet streams, the galactic sheet or (God forbid) the sun.  No. It is all down to cow farts.  Surely we are at peak stupidity by now?
So, like, go Vegan people ?
Anybody remember the time Kirzgesagt uploaded a video on addiction with the community calling him out for bad logic?
When you got to the cow fart argument I checked out. Don't humor fear-mongering nonsense.
Therapist: Demon Cow doesn't exist; it can't hurt you  Demon Cow: 6:59
Guga : *sigh
Interesting video. Its surprising to learn that transportation is not the biggest factor is climate effect of food production and distribution. And increased efficiency means increased cruelty (which might not be a scientific point but still holds valid for societal values). Looking at the current rate at which the climate change is happening, I feel that the best approach is to spread understanding about the impact of our choices on environment and make necessary lifestyle changes.
AND THIS IS HOW YOU GET PEOPLE TO GO VEGAN, THAT VEGAN TEACHER!
You don't eat beef because you care about your own carbon footprint and the greenhouse effect  I don't eat beef because i am poor  We are not the same
i would watch these video's during school in 5th grade when i wasn't suppost to and when i was allowed to
My father happends to have dairy farm. It is true that we would have to use large amount of grassland to even allow cows to walk freely on it. Not only becouse cows would eat it out, but as the walk they also destroy grass same as u see humans do when they make shourtcut on grass in parks, lawns etc. So we would have to have at least 3/4 separate pastures to get our cows to walk freely but also would have to restore grasslands (regrow and maintnace jobs) but also would have to have yet another ones to store some grass for cows to have smt to eat in winter. Another thing is that if we put our cows on mainly grass diet we would get much worse milk ratio from them. Dairy cows maight be 1t in weight but theirs stomachs are very delicate and they need special diet (we have 3 dietician and vet preparing healthy and efficient food for them) if not feed correctly they would surley cut on milk and probably ll lack some vitamins, proteins etc so they would surley become sick since they are not wild animals anymore etc.  It is also true that meat cows get worse food since if they fall sick we don't care if they cut on milk since they are not milked as long as they can just stay well most of the time and grow all is good.
con tro vissy
It's especially interesting how getting rid of all meat for everybody (except for the 1% of the 1% ruling class) still doesn't make a dent in greenhouse emissions, because there are poor countries that rely on fossil fuels and inefficient burning methods. Plus, it's also interesting how it doesn't mention that in the 20th century, forests everywhere around the globe actually started to grow back, not diminish. Why? Because people switched to coal and oil and stopped cutting down trees for fuel, and more CO2 makes trees regrow faster as it's their food.  So I'd rather conclude that while we definitely should address deforestation (only with nuance: did you know that most brazilian forest area cut down is converted to tree farms? Did you know that tree farms are more efficient in carbon capture than wilderness?), we have no solid reason for changing our dietary habits.
Literally didn't mention how important protein is and how impossible it is to get it through plants
"Rice releases methane"  So, the plants are starting to fight back?
Ironically the thing that encouraged me to incorporate more vegan options was that video going around that uses misleading arguments to try to convince people meat isn't all that bad really. For one thing I hate being lied to, for another the fact that the meat and dairy industry is worried about people cutting down on meat tells me my individual choice matters maybe (though we still need to work on systemic stuff like ag subsidies)
I think humanity just has to die. We’ve done everything to make life better for humanity and apparently everything good is bad. Maybe we should go back to medieval times and let poverty, disease, and sickness control our lives.
being vegan is still dumb so yeah
I just came to say, MEAT is the best and i feel sorry for VEGANS!
Im very disappointed that this video did not even mention silvopasturing or feeding seaweed based food for cattle. Doing things that way often times actually ends up drawing down more carbon than it emits
loved the vid keep up the wonderful work
Is meat really that bad? 90% percent of the video is about beef? No talk about fish? Not even in the graphics? Sorry, almost gave this video a dislike
Basically go vegan or earth will commit sudoku lol
I wonder if the veda predict this? Or just coincidence? 😱 🤔
Phew fortunately that viegan toeachar isnt here lol
To make a long story short        We are Fucked 💀
Ooohh the comments on this one are going to be spicy.
Can you make a video about oceanic plankton — drifting plants, algae, and some bacteria that can photosynthesize, as one of many series of climate change?, dissociation about why there not being talked about, why it's not being Cultivated, and how big of impact it will be to the earth if there're being cultivated and released in the ocean
So just eat less beef then?
Heart attacks and other issues correlate more strongly with the invention of processed vegetable oils than any kind of animal consumption. Diabetes, celiac disease, etc processed and refined sugars and carbohydrates. Nothing wrong with moderate consumption of animal products, issue really is excess consumption and things like corn-based feedlots.
I would eat vegan food if they taste as good as asain vegan food
Anyone feel they're wrong about the first scentence? I dont particularly eat food lots, but there is something i do every day that doesent get old.
Wow after eight hours the city I still don’t have one dislike
I have the best idea! It's called popup forests. All you do is plant a few Maclura pomifera trees and they do the rest!
what about fish
Grass fed isn’t about being environmentally friendly it’s higher quality meat
You can talk to me about meat after china and India stop being (by far) the worlds largest contributors to pollution
why was there a T cell on the table
Kurzgesagt: A vegan diet would free up around 3 billion hectares of land.  ThatVeganTeacher: *_[Visible approval.]_*
I’m waiting for that vegan teachers comment
Well backyard farms or growing food at your house could help
Sorry, I would rather doom this planet to a state of inhabitability for humans than give up meat.  And if it is outlawed, I will do it illegally.
Beef stonk only go up
How about sudden methane emissions by humans that switched to an all plant-based diet? 🤔
hello!
“Beef is bad and you should seriously consider cutting it out or at least reducing it from your diet” People watching: “yes I will definitely do that”  An few days later: ”I’m starving would love a burger and maybe some bacon fries on the side”   In my personal experience everyone who has tried cutting back has ended up slipping back into eating meat I personally recommend severing all ties with meat and going fully vegetarian or vegan
please do an episode on vat grown meat effects on the environment
also, y'know... cows want to live?
Really good to see a video with actual science and it being understood this time, as your last video on this topic was blatant misinformation or misunderstanding the science. Basically don't say you care about the planet if you aren't vegan.
i believe we should just switch to chicken
Who else saw the cow in the Monkey in the intro

Hey! I'm working on a project right now where we take yeast, edit them to convert methane into methanol. The goal is to get an A.C./filtration system that has panels of inoculated media to break down the methane. Methanol is toxic in our bodies as our liver breaks it down into Formaldehyde, but it's a clean-burning source of fuel, and we can use it to power the filters machinery. My hope is to get these panels to industrial cattle/dairy farms in order to cut down on methane released into the atmosphere. :)  My goal is to engineer the microbiomes of cattle so that they reduce if not eliminate methane production, but as it stands the only proteins to break down methane that have been discovered so far are ones that produce methanol...
Make a video about crypto and its effect on the environment.
Eating too much meat is no good but consuming fair portion of meat is good
I like the part where they talk about food

Vegan liiiiiife
Focusing on our personal carbon footprint is exactly what the world's biggest polluters want us to do. The carbon footprint was invented by BP!  The unfortunate reality is that you buying potatoes instead of ground beef is meaningless when we continue to allow industry to pump the atmosphere full of greenhouse gasses. Climate change is a problem only governments are suited to address. Petitioning your elected leaders will go a lot farther than cutting out many of the pleasures from your life.
Spoiler: yes
Meat isn't the problem It's America's overabundance of food and car culture. India and China's pollution and lack of ethics.
no
People in this comment section are kinda rude. Treating people like villains for eating meat is messed up.
the mad titan was actually right
This is great stuff! I hope people actually use this info & make some changes!
Informative. But the greater issue is ethical not existential or environmental.
After watching that I really fancy a double cheeseburger with bacon🤤
Bahasa 🙏
this animation style bothers me
Good points and presentation as always. These facts are an important part of making personal dietary decisions, though I also feel that the moral argument should also be a significant influence.
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old"  teenagers: are you sure about that
It's extremely unwise, I mean freaking stupid, to ignore human physiology and say that a calorie is a calorie. If a potato and a piece of meat have same amount of calorie, they have a total different effects on our body, namely, obesity and diabetes, and thus the whole downstream effects and burdens put upon the healthcare system and pharmaceutical industries which are also chemistry labs.  It is also unwise, I mean freaking stupid, to think going all out to raise animals in the natural way, won't change anything. Grass fed and pasture raised animals don't contain same nutrients as the factory farmed meats, which is quite obvious in my opinion.  All in all, I think the total ignorance of human physiology or even animal physiology related to food is the fundamental flaw of this video.
Generally good video but left out a few fairly important details.  Not all the grain grown is for humans yes, however not all grains grown for humans is of usable quality. When the quality is low it is used for animal feed, else it would be wasted and that carbon would be in the veg column.   Secondly, when food production has waste, either quality, or otherwise, the food goes to either landfill or to feed livestock in industrial farming. This waste is not accounted for in the breakdowns, only when first produced.   And finally, although mentioned, the calorific density of vegetables means that to get the same number of available calories for world consumption we would need to clear vast amounts of land, and we would need to ship, store, and distribute a vastly wider diet to make sure all nutritional needs are met. Which is fine in western countries, but presents a problem in underdeveloped places.   The answer is not as simple as giving up meat, switching from beef to chicken or pork is one way, but you can't sell that as a concept. Lowering beef consumption is more viable, but there are many issues with that as well.   And this is not even looking at the environmental impact that farming crops in areas where they are not supposed to be, rice in australia for instance. And the other impacts that monocrops present, and the increased usage of pesticides, herbicides, and fertiliser.
The single biggest problem with agriculture's carbon emissions is food waste. We cannot shut a global industry of this scale down in a century, let alone overnight, but systemic changes to our logistics and purchasing habits (as consumers yes, but definitely as suppliers) is the best and simplest changes we can make to reduce our carbon footprint. Buy less, and use our food more efficiently.
Fact: I LOVE TO EAT POTATOAS
Time to go vegan 🌱
Yeah not gonna stop eating meat anytime soon, nice try though.
In my case, it's not an option. I can't consume much fiber due to a half-ass surgeon. Meat and or other very low fiber foods are all I can do.
This was a interesting video when eating my Chick-fil-A
I am the dislike button
Animals are not food. Period
But when you say soy goes mostly to the animal industry, is this just the soy bean or the whole soy plant which is mostly inedible? This is a important part of the data, because the inedible parts are given to the animals. If you put it in a landfill or compost it you still get methane for it. If you give to the animals you make a nutrional dense food + methane.
Can you do an episode about seafood?
Cutting out beef and lamb? Alright, for the world. But like hell I’m going vegan
in order to save the Amazon rain forest then I think we should all go on a beef free diet.
I'm that one eating the helper T cell at 9:45.
After watching this, I think I'm going beef free.
In my mind the only mostly ethical choice for beef and meat from other grazing mammals. Is to take that 77% cut to how much we consume. And only have grass fed meat from land that can't be used as efficiently otherwise. This video doesn't account at all for all the wasted product in meat industry. Most of beef that is consumed makes up only a portion of what's usable. Muscle is far less nutrient, mineral, and vitamin dense than most organ meats. In particular liver or brain. But those are frequently discarded (or at least not consumed by humans; I'm no expert in how the meat industry handles less desirable parts but I'm under the impression there's a lot of waste). All parts of an animal are usseable and useful. But also just in grocery stores, restaurants, and other wise there's a lot of needless trashing of food.  People can relatively easily change their diet once they decide to. Give them a better alternative with more incentives and the will come. For example there should be a hell of a lot more talk about eating insects and how you might do that, especially in videos like these.  On a related note I'm pescetarian and would love to see a similar video talking about the impact of eating fish and other sea life, and where/how it's sourced. Including the impact it can have on local ecosystems. Which is something I also wish was expanded on in this video (or covered in it's own video).
As soon as lab-grown beef is safe and affordable I'm in on that shit.
I don´t even like beef....
These are some of my first thoughts for problems. So all Cow farms should be kept indoor as much as possible, sealed, and vented to remove the methane, and store it for energy use, that way it's At least double dipping for the cost. As Many crops as possible need to be converted to Vertical Farming structures, especially if it's just going to feed animals.
It is great they they can talk about meat being bad for the environment without being controversial! I love all of this content!
I want lab grown meat
Then to lower food production is to lower food consumption Fasting can both be beneficial for an individual and the environment
You should do a video about omicron next…
When you see a slightly opinionated video in a Kurzgesagt video, you know a whole group of people are about to get destroyed. Guess I'm 6ft under now.
It's extremely simple. Go vegan and you'll improve the situation.   Really is nothing more to it, no need to complicate it. It's common sense that eating animals, that eat plants, is less effective than.... Just eating the plants.
Wonder a bit, when it comes to farming meat, why dont the video mention the much lower impact aquaculture has compared to other agriculture?
I was eating meat while watching this video lol
There is a big problem here: Assuming that we can just "take out meat" without consequences. Living totally v** (censorship??) is not healthy for you in the long run, and not many people can actually sustain such a diet. It's complicated and requires that you keep close attention to supplements. Even if you do, you're still likely to suffer from brain fog, frail hair, nails and teeth, anemia and a wide range of mental problems such as depression and anxiety. These symptoms can take years to develop, so just because you've been vegan for a few years and still have all your teeth, it doesn't mean this is not true. Also, kids coming up on a vegan diet are not thriving at all. See Shawn Baker on IG for some perspective. Edit: Why the hell is this comment being removed?? Is YouTube so afraid of people not following the "approved narrative"?
I have been watching these guys for over 5 years and still they amaze me.
While this is very interesting and helpful, I feel like there is something missing.  What about homesteads, and livestock that have their diets supplemented with left over veggies from the garden? How does that effect the carbon foot print? And what about rabbit as livestock?
There is definitely a moral/ethical argument against factory farming of animals for meat (or other products, for that matter).  However, in every other aspect, it's less obvious.  Nutritionally, vegans miss out on several key vitamins and MUST supplement artificially to maintain health.  In recent research, animal fats appear to be much safer for human consumption than vegetable-based oils.  Starchy vegetarian diets (and especially industrially-processed food products) appear to promote diabetes and obesity much more than "whole food" omnivore and carnivore diets.  The bottom line is that we still don't really understand what foods are healthy or not, and ultra-processed plant-based meat substitutes are unlikely to actually be good for your health.  The video also missed several key arguments used by meat-eaters (and the meat industry I'm sure) to deflect some blame from the industry (although I'm sure it still deserves blame). 1.  Most animal feed is made from non-edible crops (mentioned) and byproducts of edible crops (not mentioned) that would otherwise be mulched and generate methane.  Animals upcycle otherwise-useless plant matter into food that we can eat.   2. It's not just that very little of the land area currently used for animals (and crops to support them) could be repurposed for other food crops (mentioned) - it can't, and won't.  That amount of land is exceedingly UNLIKELY to be "returned to nature" to reabsorb carbon - there would be too much pressure to use it for other purposes, e.g. solar farms for renewable energy production.  Pastureland is usually much too arid to be used for forests - it's mostly grassland.  Grasslands turn out to be most productive (and absorb the largest amount of carbon) if they have large herds of herbivores (usually ruminants like buffalo or cattle) roaming around them, to flatten the grass, convert grass to manure, and so on.  So... maybe we just need to figure out better ways of managing cattle herds? 3. Destruction of the Amazon forest (which is a significant ecological/environmental issue) is actually much less about cattle ranching than an issue of people not knowing how else to make a living.  Figure out a better way to keep people in Brazil employed, paid, and housed, and there would be much less pressure on the forests.  This is NOT an easy challenge though. 4. An environmental position that farm animals should not be eaten for meat is indistinguishable from saying that we should not have any domestic animals - including pets.  That is, if you ban commercial production of beef and sheep for meat consumption, where is the logical endpoint?  After all, dogs and cats also eat meat products, and other food that could be diverted from food used for people.   If you ban cattle farming, would there be ANY large herbivores left in the Americas?  There used to be an estimated 100 million buffalo on the North American plains, which presumably also produced methane.  Why are cattle having more GHG impacts now than the ruminants of the past (or are they?), and if so, is this something that can be adjusted through better feedstock techniques?  As the video starts out by saying - "it's complicated".
With more forests will come more wild animals(like deer) and then we can have carbon efficient meat as well
considering how serious of an issue heart disease and obesity is in America I think we could all live with eating a lot less beef and red meat in general. I'm not a vegetarian, but I don't eat beef for religious reasons and I gotta say avoiding beef is a lot harder than you think. It's everywhere and in everything here in America. When I look at the inhumane conditions and the contribution to global warming, and how unhealthy large amounts of red meat is, I can't help but think people just can't let it go because it tastes good, but there's a lot of other sources of red meat we could eat that would be better for our health and the environment and not contribute to global warming nearly so much.
These videos are always so gorgeous
So researchers have figured out ways of substantially reducing the methane emissions from cattle by the addition of a small portion of seaweed to their diets. This will dramatically improve the efficiency of growing beef. It won't, however, fix any of the land management issues which are the biggest concern.
I live in an area where beef isn't super common, chicken and pork are waaay more popular, I would be fine if beef just dissappeared one day. It doesn't even taste that good, it's fine but nothing more. I know there are countries like Argentina that practically run on beef, I can't imagine that
In before governments mandate eating bugs.
Question: If we sum up the nutrients of milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, and meat, wouldn't it beat the worst plant based food in terms of the CO2 footprint per 100g of protein?
I know this video is dedicated on carbon emotions, but specifically ruminants consume a lot of the by-products of various plant based products that humans can't eat, and without them that waste would be going to landfill. Also assuming that we remove all other emissions and only cattle are producing carbon/methane, that carbon would be sucked back into plants and recycled and in a perfect world would not negatively impact the climate. We should be eating less meat, I agree with that, and I agree with the video, just a few things that I think where missed.
This was much more neutral than the last video on the subject thx! You still missed a few point.  1- Humans are worst by an order of magnitude. 2- You just assumed that it was OK to use as many grassland as physically possible to feed humans. I don't think this is ecologically responsible. It's not because we CAN use the grassland for farming that we SHOULD. To me feeding grassland animals with the food produced from grassland is the sensible thing to do. The VERY LAST thing we want to feed with more grassland converted into farm is even MORE humans.  3- Humans destroyed the megafauna of earth thousands of years ago. Cows are one of the last remain of it and only a minute fraction of what was on earth at it peak. We need to work toward increasing biodiversity, not killing even more animals to feed more humans. 4- All grass eating creatures produce methane, cows are only mildly worst then horst or sheep once weight is being factored. The only way to produce less methane is to raze more grasslands. We don't need any special governmental pressure to do more of ecosystem destruction. I'm pro grassland.
ah yes beef stonks
I will make one comment: Despite being "greener", shipping vegetables by boat is only part of the emissions. Most of those vegetables had to travel either by train or by truck to distribution center, shipped from there to the port, from the destination port to another distribution center, and from there to the various stores and groceries. This is why vegetables have a high CO2 emission rating.
Aw man but meat tastes delicious.
Beef it’s what’s for dinner for for my family sooo sorry all
What about really accurate to taste/texture veggie meat replacement?
So in your previous video you specifically stated that nothing you can do as an individual would make a scrap of difference, except for voting in political parties that will act on climate change (right before the German election).  So why the change in tone? Do our individual decisions matter or not?
NO beef stonks
Alright, I understand how cows are causing all those emissions but what are we going to do? Make cows go extinct? And even if we did every animal on the planet passes gas, so in reality, if you stop eating meat it won't really help the climate even on a large scale.
Why do I feel like the next conclusion you're going to reach is that the REAL bad guys are the ones squandering their land?
can you do something on lab gown meat and organs
What do you mean by "use up our budget" of emissions? Does the world end at that point?
if meat would grow in a lab with all the nutrients and flavour, id buy it over conventional meat. Albeit of course if affordable... cant afford to do that 200x.
Would love to see a version of this for fish.
Guess who’s gonna continue to devour meat 🥩 🍖😋😋😋
i will never give up meat
They forgor to make “that” capital rip
why do i feel like thatveganteacher will come in and watch this.
Yeah, I'm still eating beef.
The worst thing about vegans is that they're right.  It IS the better way.
Could you look at cell grown meat?
Wow I’m glad you guys put it into perspective I understand the issue a lot better now however I must say I was watching while eating the juiciest 20 oz beef and let me tell you... beef production will not stop growing even if every single person knew about this
It's a shame you did NOT talk about cows being able to share land with other animals, and their POOP being a resource that gives BACK to the environment. So close, but this makes a huge difference. Cows can be raised with a net positive to the environment.
I know it's a lot of work to make all those animations, but you guys make it look so easy. I just want to wish you the best of luck; you're doing an excellent job. Greetings from Spain.
meat is bad at the scale it is produced. generally, it is not bad to have some meat in your diet but not eating it everyday like so many people do.
The only thing I don't really understand is (at 04:52); how is it that the distribution of plant based food has less emissions than the equivalent weight of animal based food, even if the animal based food traveled less distance. Wouldn't a kg of avocado create more emissions going from, say a port in LA to Wisconsin than a kg of beef going from the farm 10 miles away to the local butcher? It just appears to be a disingenuous comparison if we're only comparing the emissions of the ship to the emissions of a local truck instead of comparing the emissions from the ship and the cross country truck/train to the emissions of the local truck.   I say this as someone that gave up red meat over a year ago. I just don't like disingenuous arguments being made when they're clearly not at all necessary.
Can you make a video about iron star?
TL;DR -- we're all being poisoned by cow farts!!!
Fine I will try to eat more vegan 😔
B E E F   S T O N K S
Coooool. Yea I'm not changing my diet habits no matter how much people pretend it does anything.
Yes I also get my veg straight from the freighter ship
We need to plant more trees bois
Am I the only one who watches the German video first and then has a weird deja vu experience when watching the English video a couple days later?
also the amount of food wasted means way more emissions. I used to work at mcdonalds and its crazy how much beef went wasted
Isnt there some upcoming technology that allows you to grow meat in a lab? If it gets good to a certain degree, it could be a permanent replacement for the animals
9:34 Very visually misleading. It's one bar representing 100 years while one bar represents 1 year. The top bar is decisively larger than the bottom bar however, when looked at over the course of year, the top bar should be about 16% the size of the bottom bar. Edit: I agree with the message but it weakens the argument overall having this kind of obvious inconsistency.
Rare video where the answer to the question asked in title is "Yes"  PS Relying on individual decisions (with no explicit call to action) is how you get the bad endings in the prisoner's dilemma
Mmm, meat. Yummy-yummy
beef unstonks
This could be that great filter mentioned in a past video. No species can feed itself and remain large enough to develop advanced technologies required to become an interplanetary species
Ok but is it actually _healthy_
Between the sky-high price of beef and not being that much of a fan anymore anyways, it's rarely used at my home now.
For people looking for more of the ethical arguments around eating animals check out Earthling Ed and as another commented the video "A meat eater's case for veganism"
The problem is taste
What about lab grown beef?
"no other bodily plessure is enjoyed multiple times every day"
There's also all the water use and water pollution. Ever seen the pig farm waste lagoons?
yeah i want mine medium rare please
Let us all DIE. That oughta do it.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old."  Tell that to teenage me.
If they can make near identical tasting meat alternatives widespread throughout the world (which seems to already have begun) then I will happily go vegetarian but my love for meat is still too strong even though I know how damaging it is to the environment
Aha so we must eat all of the cows
go vegan
False facts
The point of talking about where beef is made is to take into account that if your local beef is made efficiently IE its coming from North America, Japan, Or Europe... then you can be assured that the carbon emission from your beef is of no consequence.  You don't need to go vegan. You don't need to start buying local.  You already are.  Restaurants and grocery stores are not sourcing their beef abroad.  They are already getting their beef from the shortest distance possible
"Debates get emotional quickly" Vegan teacher enters chat
Nice indirect answer to the What I've Learned channel. But I still have some questions about nutritional density... is it possible and affordable to obtain protein and B vitamins among other nutrients abundant in meat from other sources?
Didn't even mention you can simply give cows seaweed and they won't fart as much...
😢🔫 Eat the bugs
I need the year to be over so i can use my shiny 12022 calendar 💀
I appreciate that you try and stay unbiased but its unfortunate you don't call out the ultimate perpetrators of these carbon emissions which are big corporations and big agriculture. We can't have a debate on this issue without considering the context of who are the people building factory farms or cutting down the amazon or creating a market where beef is in demand on a mass scale. We won't solve climate change without targeting big business and the actual polluters.
Damn 100k likes in 8 hours
2:50 8:14 Kurzgesagt is putting more and more memes into videos and I like it
There are some studies that show that cattle is actually good for the ecosystem of plants.
Didn't mention cows improving soil and actually sequestering carbon into the soil.  Didn't mention CO2 emissions for cows in the western world vs the 3rd world.  Didn't mention cows eating alot of our food by-products and waste, think cauliflower leaves, broccoli stems etc.  Didn't mention food waste in general. If you care about climate change then food waste should be 1st on your agenda as it creates more emissions. But then again for many people this isn't just about climate change is it.
So short and simplified that it's basically misinformation. Information that was selectively picked and presented with dubious arguments.
I am in favor of lab grown meat, how would that compare to current plant production?
Any body else gone veggie recently to combat climate change ?!
go back to black hole videos
And this is one of the reasons I am Vegan.  Above all though, I did hate my self for "Enjoying my self" on other beings suffering.  Cows and even Chickens for the case are smarter than both Dogs and Cats, yet its ok for them to suffer but for a poor Cat or Dog not? (Just prove how much brain washed propaganda the meat industry fed you if you where not aware about it.)  If you see a farmer beat A Cow or let A Chicken rot in a cell cutting its beak so it won't harm itself while being jailed in a worse than holocaust conditions is totally ok, but if it would've been Dogs or Cats? full on protests.  Don't want to be Vegan? ok but at minimum stop being an Hypocrite or say you love "animals" or against "animal violence" when every time you eat a milk chocolate you support it.
Meat is bad for (1) the environment (2) health (red meat is a carcinogen) and (3) certainly for the animals.
.
BEEF STONKS
And 4hats why we should pump money in lab grown meat.  Done right should it be more efficent and more healthy plus the whole envirement things.
Thier are plant based meats that are better for the environment and taste almost exactly like real meat.
I have Crohns disease. Almost all vegetables,  fruits, and breads make me sick. Soy and legumes make me really sick too. But no meat or fish make me sick, so I'm sticking with them as my primary food source.
I like meat, but I wouldn't really mind beef production being massively reduced as I prefer lamb and chicken.
Use me as a dislike button.
I love this Chanel
Here is a video idea on a similar topic: Phosphorous - the extinction you don't know about Basically, we are all afraid of global warming, meteor strike, global thermonuclear war, the collapse of the monetary system, or zombie apocalypse. Barely anyone knows about that we are running out of phosphorous. The current global demand for food requires the usage of fertilizers for the plants, both for human consumption and the consumption of our livestock. The basic fertilizer, NPK, is made of nitrogen (which you are breathing right now), potassium (which is in abundance), and phosphorous. The latter one is a mineral and as such, non-renewable. Add to this that huge amounts of it is unavoidably wasted (for example washed away due to simple everyday things like rain), and suddenly we have a problem on our hand. A big one. Some estimates say we run out of it in 80-100 years, more pessimistic ones expect as little as 20 years considering that the demand is increasing exponentially. Imagine that suddenly bread vanishes from existence, so does meat, and fruit and vegetables become unaffordable luxury. Or, you know, we may experience a zombie apocalypse...
These videoes always go on trending
Me eating my steak: Okay, whatever.
If the majority of humans don't change soon, humanity needs to go extinct.
I'm eating meat right now and saw this video
For certain groups who think they are doing the right thing but abort fetuses yes, but for normal people, no
What about fish? Surely they can't be that bad for the climate
Not kurzgesagt making me vegan
Congrats on #3 on trending Kurzgesagt!
I like Kurzgesagt channel but sometimes they don't do deep enough research. Not sure if it is laziness or push certain agenda. Stating that animals stuck in cages are more efficient than free range animals carbon wise is half truth. They forgot to mention that cage animals need food to brought to them, that food was grown on some land and transported to these animals by some machines and fed them by machines - where is calculations of land used to grow animal food, production of all machinery and equipment for "efficient" stocking, transportation of food to caged animals? Free range animals just eat whatever grows naturally with minimal machinery and energy input and 0 fertilizer input which is another huge pollutant industry.  And if we are on subject of efficiency - why they don't mention useless green lawns "worshipped" in developed countries which are HUGEST pollutant contributors in humans living areas. Use of noisy lawn mowers, fertilizers, herbicides (Roundup) which kill pollinators including bees are much more destructive to ecology than couple chicken and sheep running in your backyard and eating all natural, local grass/flowers and trimming yard at the same time. Issue here is not animals but big Agriculture in general with non-ethical practices. That's why buying local not only the right thing to do but more efficient use of land and energy by all factors considered.
I too, love meats, I eat plenty of those every night
well if you put it like that, some males and some females would disagree
You can do what you want with this information  Best line of your channel
Focus of the billionaires private and stop this agenda against beef. Stopped watching your content when I saw through your BS
I just want them to hurry up and make lab engineered meat
Your videos are so interesting!
“The more animals suffer, the better they are in terms of climate change because they are way more efficient.” - That one stuck to me. Naturally, the whole planet runs this way, and humans are the only ones to realize this, and the only ones that have the morality to possibly change the system.
You guys are genuinely just the best channel. I guess you read this 1000 times, well, make it 1001
This channel is so impressively unbiased, that the only people who used to dislike it were either people who can't accept facts, or psychopaths.
I’m only one person
I will keep my beef thanks. Your green new deal can shove it.
love to hear how fish compares to the other meat. i assume fish carbon footprint to be very low. however probably the most cruel industry
What about the fact that alot of feed is things like corn stalks? Or the none eaten parts of soybean crops. I believe its some like 80% of feed is like this. Also the boats....would idk 90% (understatement) of the time be added to the  truck emissions.
Happy meat farms
I love all the food videos and videos that talk about actual actions we can take. Are you planning on talking about seasonal produce in more detail ever?
What I've learned from this is that a slice of plain cheese pizza has less of a carbon footprint than McDonalds.
Trust a German to love a good bratwurst
Co2 os not that bad plants need it to grow and the Earth was all co2 at one point in time then plants came and killed everything off by make Oxygen and then they adapted to breathe oxygen so it’s not bad and points still need CO2 to live so why would we get rid of it plants need you to live and they make oxygen so we’re fine
What about ultra-high density, quick rotation grazing?
You guys should talk about how to replace the vitamin B12 in vegan diet, this vitamin is only found in meat and is really important since it is used in brains cells (hence the assimilation of the grow of the human brain to eating meat). And is producing vitamin B12 in lab and then introducing it to our diet more green in terms of emissions compared to eating meat?
The duck at 0:03 looks like my 27-pound cat. LOL
So if Methane is the main output of Beef, isnt there a study that adding seaweed to cow's diets they dont produce nearly as much methane?
Lets get the Vegan teacher to see this
Well the high demand for meat is actually what made the meat industry to supply more, so to restore the balance i think the best thing we can do is that to cut our demand for meat to normalized the supply and restore the balance this is only a short term solution however. The longterm solution should be lab grown meat
The food that humanity ate for millions of years is bad some berries and tubers with oxlates are the best. Am not taking food advise from some cartoon guy. Thanks
If we discover that earth is going to enter into an oort cloud that blocks the sun will all these ideas turn around and become the best? Global warming to save earth!
whats up with the dislike?
Whilst I agree with nearly everything, there are a few points of contention. For one the local beef vs internationally shipped avocados. These avocados travel across vast distances by, often very outdated and poluting, trucks or cars to get to the harbour. On this side it still moves from the harbour, to auction, distribution centres, supermarkets and eventually your home. With the vast amount of variables it might be hard to calculate but if you count these things for local beef you might as well for avocados. One might even make the mistake of thinking shipping beef from South America isn't that different in carbon footprint to buying local beef. I agree with the sentiment of "buying it locally doesn't make meat better than exotic plants" but it does help eliviate the enviromental strain of meat in general somewhat.  As for stopping the meat industry would free up space for nature, in a theoretical sense maybe. Realistically the owners of these lands would probably want to keep earning money off of it and would switch to other means. Not to mention the carbon currently sequestered in some pastures would likely outweight the possible sequestration of carbon in forests/grasslands in areas otherwise too dry to support high density plantlife naturally. Switching to full grass fed beef could be a lot less poluting. Theoretically even an almost closed carbon cycle with some innovation.
I’m still going to eat meat place the combinations make prints go
My best recommendation to people is to stay open and go slow. Stay open to the possibility that you can make and find delicious vegan recipes, expand slowly your options while cutting meats little by little. I do believe as a whole we can reach a sweet spot where meat is a luxury item, but as a culture we are well educated so its not something that is inaccesible or hoarded. But overall look at your day to day diet, and simply consider how much you are missing on by having a heavy meat only diet.  Food is an experience, it's a ride, it takes learning and de-learning to stay open. I used to be a really pesky eater, all i could stand was meat and heavy carbohydrates, but with the time, education and the right people giving the example, i'm slowly expanding my food options, where sometimes i can go days happy having only fruits and veggies. Be patient with yourself, and please above all else, dont romanticize an ideal, don't fall in love with the way things are. Stay open to the possibility that it might be better for your health and that your life could take a drastic shift by slowly making the changes we need.
I appreciate the idea of using environmentalism to justify a reduction in our meat consumption, but I really think we’ll come to see our treatment of animals as just plainly abominable within the century.
8:16 [overused meme]
Also, attributing destruction of land to beef farms only is bullshit too. If people stop eating meat they will have to eat other stuff to survive, then all these lands will have to turn into other crops.  With these commercial crops, more wildlife will get killed by the huge harvesters, more emissions from chemical treatments to guarantee that the outcome the crop season is enough to feed everyone who is a veggie head now and last but not least, more risk of fire (intentional or not).
You missed a REALLY important understanding in your research !!! See Ted Talk with Allan Savory : How to Fight Desertification and Reverse Climate Change. A really Important watch  <3 Also you did not mention the seaweed cattle feed additive that reduces methane output by 82% Pretty poor effort on this video honestly.
It's honestly baffling that people need more reasons to go vegan at this point. The excuses and denial are insane
Now i’m hungry
Environmental destruction is just one thing, but seeing mass live stock farms is just heartbreaking.
Don't care Imma still be eating them juicy steaks
Great video! Though I was hoping to hear some pro-meat arguments (not the whole “we are omnivores” necessarily, but things like people who have a higher need for it due to genetics/disabilities & poverty). It does sound like this is more anti-beef specifically than anti-meat, though. I’m also curious about the methane production—is this the way cows just are or is it because of thousands of years of our intervention in breeding them?  I’m also curious about fully lab-grown meat, the carbon footprint involved in it, and whether or not that’s a good sustainable option worth investing in!
Really nice to see an honest and thoroughly researched take on this by Kurzgesagt. I was really loosing hope for the channel when I saw the last video on meat, that contains several misconceptions or half-truths, self-contradictions and other errors which confuses the issue a lot. I only think the wording was kind of off a few times or the focus was slightly off point. Why does it matter especially much how much protein vs emissions vary from beef to plant based alternatives, when protein is highly overrated and misunderstood as a food source? Why make the comparison, if it's not really a useful food source in and by itself, plus the package the protein comes in, can be problematic for the body, especially when it's in the form of a charred piece of bacon etc. Protein uptake is higher in raw food too, when looking at fruits. The body builds most of them by itself, it only outsources the most complex and work intensive amino-acids to food, and those aren't used in as many parts of our bodies as the homemade Amino-acids. Furthermore eating potatoes and cutting down on beef has historically shown to help grow muscles much faster than, while maintaining better health.   Another point. The difference was still very high even when comparing emissions 1000 calories. So why did you say that it wasn't a big difference?  That's all I had. Otherwise really great video on this highly controversial subject.
Another big problem is 3rd world countries, or people who face the problem of starvation and don't have many options for food. They aren't going to stop eating meat just because someone tells them it's better for the environment. They are going to choose to stay alive by using what they can. Before solving the climate change problems, we need to solve the economic and socal problems.
What kind of positive impact could we have on reducing carbon emissions, if all *processed foods* were outlawed?...  There would be less factories required to be supplied power or need to be serviced, far less packaging required - that would result in less trash produced...  therefore less trash needed to be collected by a convoy of trucks,  which means there would be less transport of trash to a processing plant,  and less processing plants.  Reduction in manufacturing /transporting of chemical preservatives  and less labs creating artificial flavorings.  Perhaps more importantly, people would be far more healthier and energetic…  most likely be happier for it too! A healthier and happier society would have less demand on health services, so that would mean less medicines needed to be manufactured, less health facilities required to be built, powered or maintained.  Lastly, healthier people would be more inclined to walk, jog or cycle to their destinations rather than using automotive transport…  Just a thought.
8 hours ago! Possibly the quickest I've clicked on a Kurzgesagt video ever.
My take on this video is, if you really need that meat, at least replace beef and lamb with pork and poultry more often. Its at least a step in the right direction.
Before industrialization, there were as many ruminating animals on the planet as there is today. They are not the problem.
How about you guys do corn
Keep in mind the idea of your own "carbon footprint" can be misleading. A vegan farmer for example would produce more emissions based on their job and likely using more fuel to travel than a city-dweller who eats meat 3-4 times a week and uses public transit and has the advantage of higher density/capacity grocery stores being more efficient.
what about the drawbacks on your health if you DON'T eat meat
I will stick to my beef.
H... How is the Chimp holding a cow? And how is it still alive? Kurzgesagt, you LITERALLY made a video on how changing the sizes on things causes those things to act.
i mean how many more signs do u need 2 go vegan 🌱 do the right thing <3
Who decided CO2 is the enemy?  We are close to extinction levels of CO2. We're at 400ppm under 200ppm most plants will die. Humans are saving the Earth by liberating CO2 that was trapped in the ground. We need clean air and CO2 is not a pollutant. We don't need a global government to save us from CO2. You want to be told how to live then move back with your parents.
Screw carnivores though
I knew beef was bad environmentally speaking, but WOW. Cutting out beef does 2/3 as much for the environment as going totally vegan. Not sure about anyone else but I’m going to try going beef-free for a while and see how it goes
If only we didn’t have to change food to change global warming. Even if we did, we would have to change other things to allow global warming to go away. I love life but man, humans suck.
Thank you for facts. I hate when people try to disguise themselves in "I only eat good meat" and "whataboutthism".  I have more respect for people who actually say they don't really care, they have made a choice.
'By buying locally you are trying to avoid emmissions from transport and packaging':  I feel it is a bit dishonest to say buying locally doesn't help beyond miniscule emission reductions during transport and then turning around and saying deforestation in the amazon is one of the main causes of co2 emissions during beef production. Most people live nowhere near the amazon. My local farmer also does not buy soybeans (or other crops) grown on brazillian fields as feedstock, using locally grown hay instead. If you don't buy locally you have no control over, or even much opportunity to even find out, what other co2 emitting practices are used during the production of your beef.   'Animal suffering is good for the environment':  looking at the studies provided I do not see how this conclustion is reached. The Studies point out that feeding cows high quality hay (which, again, usually is produced locally, on otherwise unarable land) is better for the animals, as well as better for the environment, while I have the impression cows in factory farming are the ones getting fed feedstock grown on those fields that still were brazilian rainforest not so long ago and then, on top of that, emit more methane?
Fun video, but nothing said in it is actually useful anywhere. Global numbers for this topic lump the US in with countries like India. 2 Countries with VERY different efficiency when it comes to beef production. A skewed perception for most will be the result. Even without mentioning the stuff you got wrong in the video.
There are so many comments in only 7 hours
Should follow this up with a video on the impact and feasibility of everyone eating crops only.
wonderful as always
I worked in the beef industry for several years and heavily researched the carbon impact of beef. I largely agree with the conclusion of this video. The biggest problem with beef production is a matter of scale. Scaling up production is "efficient" in terms of dollars and profit, but comes at the cost of slash and burn land clearing, intensive monocrop animal feed agriculture, extreme water use and water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beef absolutely can be raised in an environmentally friendly and low emissions way, but the maximum amount that can be produced without serious negative externalities is less than 20% of current beef consumption. Worldwide, there is not much land that has the correct soil and climate to be good at raising beef, but in a way that does not negatively affect the biodiversity of the environment. Basically only semi-arid grasslands that have historically supported large populations of bison or other migratory grass eating animals.
Comparison on 4:35 is bullshit. Regardless of the cargo, moving either meat or veggies via ships will take less and from the port to your market more.  But I guess that pointing that out wouldn´t fit the narrative.
Humans can't live healthily without meat in some capacity, so what would be alternatives to beef, pork, lamb and chicken?  Or fish?  It's disingenuous to suggest that veganism is an option.  Vegetarianism, yes, but not veganism.
You should make a video about team seas
It’s always nice to see another perspective on important matters, and it is exactly why I am a subscriber to the channel. I have a question: is the term ‘carbon footprint’ actually a good way to discuss these matters? After all, the term ‘carbon footprint’ was introduced by the marketing devils of BP the oil giant, and remains to this day one of the greatest misdirects of the fossil fuel industrial complex. Can we move away from that sullied terminology and come up with a better term that is actually based on science and not on marketing lies from evil corporations?
Is it wrong that I'm craving a double cheeseburger after watching this video?
If you want to help the environment, cut out the meat. If you want to prevent pandemics from overuse of antibiotics, cut out the meat. If you want to value the well being of non human animals, cut out the meat. So what’s holding you back?
So what you are saying is we should just enjoy our meat because we are screwed either way
crazy how he waits until dislikes are private to upload this one.   I recommend you all watch "Eating less Meat won't save the Planet. Here's Why" for a more accurate overview of the subject. Kurzgesagt purposely leaves a lot of important info out of this video that would damage his ideas.
so happy this was given so much attention!
The cow looks odd.🤔
0:03 i can think of like 1 other thing
what about lab grown meat??? Why arent we putting tons of resources into researching that? No animals needed!
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple time a day, and never gets old."  If you really think this and have regular access to sex, then you need to see a doctor or something because you're FUCKED IN THE HEAD.
Anyone find a bird that dies this episode?
Aight the planet’s screwed.
No ones gonna talk about how the monkey ate a cow?
VEGAN food is the best thing in life and has the ability to make everyone happy.
Get ready to be attacked by the veagan teacher 💃🏻🕺🏻
does eating Impossible or Beyond plant burgers have any emissions?
The idea that the CONSUMER is responsible for ANY significant climate change is a bold faced lie.
Another complication to the subject is people who have allergies my mother is allergic to most plant-based proteins so she has to eat meat
Finding out that is the British pronunciation of methane ruined my life.
Good video, but there are certain aspects which I am still not sure why you didn't cover.  1. How much of the CO2 emitted by the cows is "new" CO2? Methane breaks down into CO2 and H2O in the atmosphere, which along with other CO2 return to the earth in form of grass, which the cow eats again, forming a cycle where no actual new CO2 gets released into the atmosphere. How much of the CO2 being relaesed is this cyclical CO2 compared to the "new" CO2 released by, say, a fossil fuel engine of the transportation truck?  2. How much of the "crops grown to feed cattle" is actually fit for human consumption? For example, corn husks and almond hulls can't be eaten by humans, but can be eaten by animals, but these parts are still considered as "crops grown to feed cattle"? This seems a bit misleading.  Might add more if I see something else.  Edit 1:  3. Regarding soy. Around 77% of soy is grown for animal feed, but in the video that mostly discusses cows, this is very misleading. According OurWorldInData, only 1.9% of soy is fed for beef and dairy products combined. Half of animal feed soy (37% total) is used for poultry production and 20% of total is used for pork. In a video that discusses beef and cows for nearly all of its runtime, the statistic of 77% of soy is used for livestock feed is misleading. I do not think the Kurzgesagt team wanted to intentionally mislead people, but it is concerning. Another study prepared for United Soybean Board stated that of all soybean meal used in US as livestock feed, just over 10% is used for beef and dairy, which is still food used for cattle instead of people, but not to the degree the video implies. Overall, the fact that so many soybeans are used for cattle feed is concerning, but the main fault for that lies with poultry and pork, not with cows.
Land rotation. Conveniently ignored top soil erosion and arable production concerns surrounding flood plains. Animals can swim  Cattle also naturally recycle top soil by merely enhabitting the land, so free range cattle would help boost the viability of top soil. The issue is that we have fenced animals away from arable fields for centuries and not rotated the lands use. This has led to deterioration of the top soil globally. To remove free roaming grass fed cattle and livestock would spell the end of global food surplus and bring us into an age of famine. Not to mention cooked red meat is one of the greatest reasons we evolved as a species, removing it from our diets will only serve to degrade general human intellect, not hindering but accelerating us towards idiocracy
What happened to growing your own meat and cultured meat innovation
Just eat everything, problems solved.
I have a question so he sais that if 26% of our carbon dioxide is from food and we have till 2100 if we only count for that 26% that’s about 80 years from now but if 26%of our usage is 80 years isn’t 100% 20 years? So if we keep going as we are right now in this pace the carbon dioxide limit will be reached in. 20 YEARS???!!
0:45 why isn't the ape holding a smart phone
Great video 👍
Just eat the damn meat and stop crying, lefties.
No one seems to ever mention how useful cows poop is for fertilizer. Also did you guys ask farmers opinions on the matter.
Hmmm....so you only calculate the shipping efficiency of an avocado across the ocean, and then ignore the total cost of distributing the av.o. The total cost is based on growing it, then shipping it globally, and then distributing it locally. Thus the CO2 costs of an avo include production, then transoceanic shipping (which may be more efficient than the next necessary stage), and then local distribution - the SAME local distribution channel as that used by locally produced beef or whatever.  So clearly the avo, per kg, is far unfriendlier than locally produced beef. Ignoring or overlooking facts is a pretty poor way to conduct an analysis.  Thats why u get no subscription from me.  Fakers
Kurzgesagt: "It's complicated"  Me: "haha, classic"
Wow no dislikes
You can tell the very subtle bias on where Kurzgesagt stands on the issue of beef. @2:34 - the other 3 meats have a generic shadow.. beef has red blood spill down the pliar.
Nice try, I’ll be having a Steak sourced halfway around the world tonight.
I'm kind of confused as to why transport emissions are included in this video. It kind of gripes me how the video mentions that oversea shipping is the most efficient mode of transport but I do not know whether it being shipped further inland on trucks is accounted for in that number or not. If that isn't the case, wouldn't the shipping emissions just add to the solution of cargo trucks? And even if it is, the raw amount of emissions would always be more due to distance so purchasing locally would be less polluting in both cases. Besides, if theoretically zero emission transport existed the meat issue would still not be solved in the slightest. Mainly because it is a separate issue despite having some connection to the subject discussed in this video. Another issue I have is how the focus of the video was a lot on beef all though I understand why, mainly because of how polluting it is compared to other meat. Yet, I would've liked it if there was a focus on the other meat types as well. I'm especially interested in poultry because of its low emission standard in the first place and the fact that the video mentioned that beef could potentially be made very carbon efficient as well. If the average pound of beef would cost 71kg of carbon and the best beef 9kg, how much can the efficiency of poultry be increased? If that amount of reduction would apply to poultry as well, which I would highly doubt but its just hypotheticals now,  it would be less than a kilogram of carbon per pound of poultry. Would meat as a secondary product from dairy cows being more efficient apply to chickens used for egg farming as well? Since poultry is efficient how much more efficient can we make it with these points and can it be close to being as viable as vegetables?  And for the last thing, I don't see any metions at all regarding the meat discussion is about how much carbon is that is set free is already in the carbon cycle. As the video mentioned a large amount of the beef process is letting cows consume feed that is inedible for humans which could mean that inedible biomass can be turned into edible biomass without adding any carbon to the cycle. It would be good to know how much of the carbon is produced that way since that wouldn't be a net gain on the total carbon in it. I could probably find this kind of info online but I wouldn't know where to start looking. Liked the rest of the video as always. Usually your content always takes a pretty unbiased view on subjects which is something we could use a lot nowadays so thank you for that.
Yeab yeah, we get it. Eat the bugs...
thanks
Great video as always guys!
Didnt mark rober show off a vegetarian burger thats pretty much the same as a normal one just a few years ago? I mean if its so similar in all aspects why not switch? I am by no means a vegan just wonderin cuz id be totally fine w that...
If anyone is curious, I have the chrome extension and the like to dislike ratio is 115k/3.6k
or in other words just get rid of the shit companies trying to mass produce meat at high costs.
I’ll be honest, I’m disappointed in this video. Everything in this video points to one solution, and you just say “we cant tell you what to do”. No you can’t, and you never have, but you’ve never strived go not recommend the best things. You know if you come out and say it you will be attacked for doing so, but you’d be doing the most honest thing. And you don’t mention how a plant based diet is entirely safe and meets all dietary needs. You dont mention how our choice to not chose an equal option is costing us.
Allow me to raise a big steak for all the triggered vegans. Cheers.
That vegan teacher: This video is just factually untrue
unpopular oppinion: what if we killed enough of the homeless that the 1% becomes the 10%?  or more tactful way of putting it, what if we began the decline of humanized population rather than increasing the humanized population? Less humans = less food = longer expecgancy of life on Earth. Will this prolong our existance on earth or hasten the billionairs race off this planet?
that's why helal meat is literally the best, alhamdulillah.
This video is dangerous because it is mostly untrue or overdone.
What about reducing population? Seems obvious 😪
So one MAJOR issue that people seem to keep forgetting. What about the billion cows already on the planet? Do we just kill them all? Wouldn't that release an immense amount of CO2? What would be a solution to this? If you removed all the farms and released every cow in the world, how would this help our crisis at all? This is all saying that we completely turn away from beef altogether, which I really doubt will ever be the case.
Solutions for forest fire emmissions,   Reforestation  (Planting trees in area that used to be a forest)  and Afforestation (Planting trees in areas that weren’t forests before)
Global warming? Nuclear Winter!
If you get emotional when discussing diet, vegan or carnivore, you are weak.
If we kill all humans then we can eliminate the need for food entirely
Vegan for the animals, vegan for the future of our world.
The animal feed section is highly misleading. It ignores the fact that much of what animals are fed is the part of crops that humans can't eat.  You portray it as if 77% of the edible soy we grow goes into animal feed. This is simply not true.
Ima take a beef steak so big my toilet is never gonna forgive me for what i will do to it
XAXXXAXAXAXAXA PATHETIC VIDEO , NICE PROPAGANDA
So, long story short, the answer is: Yes
Ah yes my favorite addiction ***food***
8:16 beef stonks
ok people, the LEAST we can do for the world is reduce our beef intake. Eat less burgers 🍔 🥩!!!
Oop and there goes the dislike button rip
There are too many people or alternatively too high a consumption of meat. Either way it needs to be appropriately reduced to prevent more severe effects of climate change and the morality of having animals being abused to provide food through any means. People need to eat less meat but it's sad they probably won't even give that up for the sake of the future. The fact COP26 flew over this is worse. It is really sad, we should strive to eat around 200g a week (Now we eat 1000g a week globally mostly in the west.) if we want animals to live decently and pollute less but many of us eat around 1kilo or more a week and that is excluding fish. What is humanity? Meat is not unethical but the standards used to produce it and the rate we consume it is abominable.
i love the way he says tofu becuase its kinda funny lol, like he says it like tofwu
Nobody is going to talk about how at 9:30 he compared CO2 removed in a 100 yesrs to CO2 emitted in a single year?
I make a steak that will change your mind in a heart beat
Wow... THANK YOU... For the first time someone serious talks about this topic without taking a side!
It's a great video (so no change there) but I have a personal issue with educational videos asking questions they don't give answers to (not even trying to). I just don't get why information should end with a question mark. If it would be that way to make people think, then one might as well request guesses from the viewers. This will still get a like from me. I just wanted to make my voice heard.
It was smart they they waited for the dislike button to be disabled before posting this 😉
Such a good video highlighting how complex this issue is, and how there's really no single magic solution for it...
As a devout beef-aholic, you’ve made me rethink my ways
Just gonna throw this out there: a guy named Allan Savory discovered a method of grazing herd animals which can reverse desertification and improve soil health. Given the vast quantity of synthetic fertilizer used to grow food and the fact that mainstream modern farming practices degrade the soil over time, I think this is an important point to consider.
I really dont care about any of this
Love this video! Pure facts
Why doesn't anyone talk about how much protein is in lentils, peanuts and mushrooms???
I want a future were we could easily turn plants on meat or even the same result with other things that are not plants
Don’t care still going to eat beef
Great job once again!
Awesome video as always 🙏
Ok, so want you basicly want is for everyone to become vegan, so we can plant more trees, so then the earth doesn't become Venus 2.0.  Ok then. 😃👍
This video is obvious propaganda. I will never stop eating beef. I eat eggs everyday, I drink whole milk everyday and I eat about a pound of cheese a week, I'm the healthiest person I know, 6 foot 2, 170 lbs. Science is fake, global warming is natural, the biggest changes of our climate, just might have to do with that giant ball of fucking plasma and fire in the sky.
The answer to literally everything: “Well, it’s complicated”
I just realized that the monkey in the intro has something different in each video.
Well there you go! That was interesting!
I can’t believe it is #3 on trending in 7 hours.
Does anyone know how bad rice is compared to cows in terms of methane generated per year?
I am sorry but you said that while using meats some amount of space can be used for plants. But you never stated how much of that space saves CO2, much less compared to our CO2 production. This seems like it fails to show both sides of the equation as we could very well have more than enough space while still eating meat, if the areas are more optimized.
I am still eating meat.
I want steak now
Is meat bad for the enviroment yes. Should i stop if i want meat nope, can someone forze me to stop nope too. As easy as that.
I got from this that we need to convert to being elvish people? And I’m kind for that idea honestly cannot say I’ve tried being vegan but to live in trees and peace with animals I’d give it a shot.
In contrast to plants, a lot of deforestation and habitat destruction goes into making soil nutrient deleting monocultured crops like soy.
This is a fantastic and incredibly strange video. Imagine if someone made a video titled "Is Torture Really That Bad?", and the reasons listed against it were:  - You might get blood on you - The screams can be really loud - Your arms might get sore  Don't you think you missed something from this analysis Kurz?
How many people at Kurzgesagt are vegetarian or vegan?  Sadly the modern world has taught me everyone lies, for the advantage of their in group.
Short answer: yes
🥩
Anything about climate Change makes me sad, it is this unstable force that even if someone wanted to fix it, we can’t do anything other then slow it down.
If all emissions except for food related emissions were eliminated it would still be too much. To me that says it just doesn't matter. People are going to do what people do and the planet will do what the planet will do and there isn't anything that can be done about it. Can all the climate change nut jobs take a chill pill now?
why do you guys keep making videos about meat. do you have a meat fixation or something
the thing is i would be vegitarian but I'm just too lazy to make sure there's no meat.
Potatoes may emit little methane to produce, but it causes me to produce and emit lots of methane.
New Kurtz vid? Let's question our life choices together, lads.
One thing you didn't mention here is also how wasteful production of stuff like milk is. If I remember correct, it's about 1000 to 1 in terms of water spent to produce milk.  Basically, a lot of our food production isn't really very efficient, since we need so much land and resources to produce so little, but it's a difficult thing to change, because people want their milk from cows and meat from cattle.  One subject I'd love to see you guys tackle is the blossoming labgrown meat industry, since that, in my opinion at least, seems like a more feasible way to deal with with the crazy amount of land we use on farms, not to mention its benefits with being sterile.  The entire global warming honestly just boils down to people being stubborn and set in their ways. Plus, you have all the money-hungry corporations gleefully spending money to force politicians all over the world to continue to invest in global warming main contributors :/
Meat is not as bad as sugar or carbs. But too much red meat increases the chance of developing cancer.
This channel is absolute GOLD! One day people will realise the seriousness of this topic. The question is, will it be too late?
I'm going to start a tradition of eating beef for Christmas and having Turkey all year round!
Thank you Kurzgesagt. Can you do a video about the plastic, pfas & pfoa pollution that is ravaging our planet while simaltaneously threatening every species on it? Pretty please?
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old."  i could argue with that
How about we all accelerate research of energy self sufficient robots that don't ever need food? And those who refuse to join the life preserver host robot get stripped of their rights and executed on the spot by the local militia enforcer drive bot? That way we never need to eat again!
More peddling of vegan talking points. I’ll go eat two burgers sometime today. Thanks!
But this video focused mostly on beef. I eat a lot of pork and I do eat chicken. It would be nice to see what change in diet gives us the best of both worlds. People don't want to get rid of meat or other animal products. The global goal should be to keep the world neutral of emmisions. We can't focus only on food alone. We need to adjust the sliders and look what change frees up some emmisions. You don't want to get rid of all greenhouse Gases, because that would kill us. These gases keeps the temperature. Too much and earth gets hotter and too little and we freeze do death. Perfect would be to keep it neutral. Keeping it neutral is not good enough. We must remove some, that we produced too much in the last several years.  I can live with less meat and different meat. Alternatives need to be good. Today's fake meat have a different problem. There are highly processed foods, that contains chemicals that you wouldn't find in your typical grandma's kitchen. I'd rather have some potatoes than some plant products that have a lot of chemicals in it to look like meat, taste somewhat like meat but have questionable ingredients that are the suspect of health problems.  What also bothers me is that the World focuses on CO2. There are many greenhouse gases that do more damage by weight. We need to focus on everything. We actually did many years ago. There was this gas (don't know the English name) that created the Ozon hole. It was a pretty easy fix. We had a suitable replacement that didn't damaged the Ozon layer. This replacement is highly flammable but that is not always a problem. As coolant this can be a problem but it still works. For spraycans, this is less a problem.  For me I can live with a solution where I only need to reduce some products or need to change to stuff that for me works as suitable replacement. Plant based meat is not a suitable replacement for me (yet). Some people sadly only focuses on removing stuff, instead to give suitable replacements first. For example with cars. Here public transport sucks. Before they try reducing the car usage with laws, they should look that public transport gets better, so people are more willing to not use a car.
i love food, i'll eat it no matter what
BEEF STONKS 😂😂😂
9:22 I don't like this graphic, it feels misleading for no reason. 800 billion tonnes of removal over 100 years being directly compared side by side to  ~50 billion tonnes of output per singular year? Why doesn't this just compare 8b/yearly removed against 50b/yearly output? It's not as if 8b yearly is a paltry sum.
The world will end before I give up my beef!
🐦🐤🐧 🐦💥🐧 Science
Damn. One of the few meats I actually like is the worst. That sucks.
That's cool and all but now instead of happily eating a burger, I will just guiltily eat a burger
Grazing vs feedlot. Cattle that are fed grass only do not produce nearly as much methane. Proper rotational grazing is labour and management intensive but a lot more environmentaly friendly.
This is essentially Kurzgesagt roasting the youtube channel What I've Learned who is on a year long journey to promote meat using misleading information ...
As a Vegan for the last two years, thank you.
Thanks for the video but its pretty sad to see that the philosphical and ethical problems with eating meat is completly ignored in this video. We kill animals by die millions a day and the only reason we are talking about changing our diet is because the holocaust against them and ourselves is proving counterproductive to the ecosystem. I am shocked that not once in this researched video the animals perspective is talked about. Our sensitivity about what we eat and what we think we should eat is nothing compared to the lives eradicated. All the wile the planet is burning.
8:15 beef stonks
Babe wake up Kurzgesagt's posted
This issue isn't beef, or deforestation, or CO2 emissions. It isn't any of the other current topical issues either. The problem is to many people. Solve that one problem, and you'll resolve all the others. You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information.
Can some genius just invent something already so we don't have to compromise? I LOVE MEAT. but if I must I'll eat the veggie stuff for a few years...
Cows don't bring new carbon into the system as oil and gas do. No one makes the difference between new carbon and that which has been circulating for centuries.... This annoyes me
Stop breading people like ants and give me my delicious steak!
Thank you this information is vital and more people need to know!
Well plant based food produce more gas in the stomach so can we get some stats on how eating plants would change our climate
Thank. You. So. Much. Since I've turned vegan I have to discuss constantly why I did so. And I'm so sick of regurgitating the same arguments over and over and over. And I'm especially sick of hearing the same uninformed  non-arguments over and over again. Now I can just send them this nicely condensed video and go on with my day.
It's remarkable how recent our modern Western lifestyle is and how much damage it's already done compared to countless generations before the present. We're going into uncharted territory.
no other bodily pleasure is felt several times a day and never gets old? speak for yourself buddy
Apart from dairy cows, replace references to “cows” with cattle. Cows refer only to grown female cattle……
Another great video, but I'm a bit confused about the part at 9:35 The top bar shows the proposed 800 billion tons of CO2 that could be removed by 3 billion hectares of reclaimed/spared land over the course of ONE HUNDRED years. The bottom bar, however, shows the amount of CO2 equivalent emissions emitted by humanity over the course of ONE year.  I don't understand the choice to show these bars side-by-side without adjusting one of them to match the timeframe of the other. 800 billion tons of CO2 sequestered over 100 years averages out to 8 billion tons sequestered annually in that time period. While scaling either of the bars makes the positive impact of reclaimed land seem much less impressive, it's still a sizable positive impact.
No
Is no one going to bring up the hilarious thumbnail for this video?
Great video!  I'm just missing some more info about the water usage that farming does.  You always heard figures citations on the topic, like: ''a single burger takes a gazillion litres of water to get to your table''. How are those figures calculated? Lots of times it seems that it's just all the water the animal drank in their life, divided by the amount of meat produced. That to me seems awfully wrong, as cows are not black holes that take in water and destroy it.  But on the other hand, one farm might take in x litres of water monthly, that come out polluted. How long would this take to come back as clean water to the environment, or if that is relevant, or if all this is nonsense and I'm missing something, I have no idea.
I'd like to thank all the vegans for your hard work of not eating meat so I can feast on them... really appreciate it!  Cheers on this delicious burguer I'm eating while watching this amazing video!
Me watching this even though I eat copious amounts of meat and not changing
Is anyone quitting on eating meat because of this video?
I don't like bee it chewy but I am guilty of eating chicken and pork
Congrats on top 3 on trending!
What this all kind of brings to mind are two things: 1) so if we do start phasing out meat, how do we go about doing that? Namely what are we going to do with all of these animals we have? Because what immediately comes to mind sounds somewhat ethically questionable...  2) What about the prospects of synthetic meat? It seems a little too early to tell, but the idea of lab grown meat that is chemically the same but synthesized differently is quite appealing.
you should do a video on the carbon cycle next and how carbon emissions from animals differ from those from fossil fuels. I feel like a lot of your meat video's don't discuss it in enough detail.
What if ate insects instead of cows? Like it has a lot of protein too. Making an insect grow locally and then export it maybe is better?
title of this video should be changed to "Is Meat Really that Bad for Climate Change?"
"it's the only bodily function that can be enjoyed multiple times a day and doesn't get old" A bold statement that would be utterly refuted by any 14 year old boy on the planet... 😂
the animations are getting so good!! the dark cow especially caught my eye.
It's the circle of life
My relationship with meat is that I get it when I want it, such as a good quality steak, a burger from my favorite burger place, or some high-quality barbecue from a local restaurant. but I don't rely on meat to fuel my day-to-day living. For that, I rely on fish (yeah, I know that fishing is a whole other can of worms) and plant-based protein sources.
Is this pro or anti-meat?
I was hoping to hear at least a passing mention of cultured meat.
No
the Dogs are already in Heaven
Vegan teacher is prolly getting so pressed over this video right now
2:28 ya peta is not gonna be happy about that news but peta is horrible so f them
IMO eliminating meat from our diet is possible but most of us are not capable of doing so for several reasons. If we want to keep meat in our diet, we may be able to reduce its impact on our environment if every person who eats meat would reduce their consumption to the recommended 70 grams per day. Currently we are producing too much and wasting too much.
I went vegan two years ago because I'm not a selfish a**hole and I get the satisfaction of the other benefits to my health/environment that goes with it. Literally the best foods I've ever had have been vegan and I'm talking about burgers and pizzas etc. too. It's so easy!
Nature is like a puzzle, u can't take a piece by itself and expect it to have the "meaning" Livestock work great with agriculture In Africa they are transforming dead land into farmable land (over the years) with livestock and agriculture ...  If defloration makes beef bad, does this (previous african example) beef can be seen as carbon negative??? Probably it should
minute 9:32: are you comparing total co2 captured with co2 emissions for year? this does not seams right.
1 I don’t like the taste of the meat  2 is not good for environment  3 maybe vegan meat is better?
imma put it like this... meat has been eaten for millions of years i bet... and wf still here... there is no way we are just going to stop. humans need to look for other ways to help climate change without factoring meat. its just not happening.. thats like asking an american to not use their 2nd amendment 🤣🤣
What about lab grown meat? Even though it is not at the scale to support the general population, I really wonder if it would reduce emissions or somehow be worse
Kids, your mind is just not open. There is a simple solution to this problem: just eat Soylent Green. Problem solved.
Finally an honest take on the problem of meat.
we have devoured our future

Beef is necessarily carbon neutral, because they only consume grass, that grows by absorbing carbon from the air, or crops, that, you guessed it, grow by absorbing carbon from the air. All the methane a cow produced comes from the air.  If so, how could cows be responsible for carbon emmitions? They aren't. We add carbon to our carbon cycle by extracting it from where it was previously sequestered. We burn trees and oil we dug up from the ground and we'll have a problem until we put that carbon back where it belongs.  There's a hundred decisions that are made before I decide that I want to eat beef, that, had they not been made, or had they been made differently, would make my decision carbon neutral. If my decision of what to eat isn't carbon neutral I bear zero responsibility for it.   I was not the one that decided to burn the forest, I was not the one that decided to dig up and use the oil, I was not the one that decided to accept a bribe to ignore environmental issues and I won't see a dime of the cheater's profits, so don't tell me it's my responsibility to save the environment. Personal carbon footprint was devised by BP to ofuscate from their responsibility and has worked wonders for their bottom line.  If you want to solve climate change tax the activities that introduce sequestered carbon to the carbon cycle by enough to sequester it anew, and stop telling me what I need to do to pay for the decisions of unfathomably rich business moguls and corrupt politicians.
Go vegan. We don't have a planet B.
A good point in this for people to realize, as well, is that CO2 isn't the only factor to consider, especially as a more "friendly" environment in that regard can be a more ethically horrible environment for the animals, depending on how reduction is obtained.  Personally, my ideal situation is for the development of cultured meats paired with plant mixtures to take the place of the bulk of meat production (think ground beef and such where the form doesn't matter, fast food, grocery store shelves, in general the places where people aren't expecting 5 star anyway), with a smaller contingent of ethically treated animals left for those who are too resistant, or view it as a delicacy.    (Edit: A note for this, as I see misconceptions in other comments, cultured meat is just that, meat grown in a culture. It isn't GMO or otherwise twisted away from being actual "meat" (not that I inherently view that as wrong, but understand the difficulties both in tech and perception), but requires essentially tricking the cells to think they are still in a growing body. There are good and bad ways to do this, as with everything)  With cultured meats, I can imagine entire new markets of specially grown marinade baths that incorporate flavor directly into the tissues at the most base levels, and even finer control of hygiene for ultra rare dishes, along with control of exact levels of nutrients for health.
In a nutshell we are f*****
can you make a part 2 that explores the impact on wildlife and biodiversity please
Ah yes, my gigantic coal power plant is not the issue, it's bob and his cow that is ruining the planet.  Demonizing cows for climate change is the finest example of butwhataboutism you could ever make. They will teach this in schools in five years hopefully, if reason gets its way in the end.  There are a lot of studies about food impact on climate change and in particular beef, and a lot of them are bogus. This channel claims to be fact based and unbiased, but it stacked as many of the "facts" that paint beef in a bad light as possible and then said "we're not telling you what to think, you make the decision". That's bullshit. Selectively omitting truths that go against your narrative is far from being neutral.  Long story short, despite what this video wants you to believe, even if the majority of the people on this planet would suddenly stop eating meat, it would have an absolutely miniscule impact on climate change. You could literally make a bigger change by turning the lights off in your house more consistently. Fossil fuels are the real killer here, not a pound of beef.
Nice trend 👍
We shouldn't and don't have to eat sentient beings these days. Especially with our intelligence, we know for a fact we only do it for our taste buds which isn't justifiable. Damage to our body's, digestive system ain't build for it, damage to the environment and with all the food that goes to cattle we can feed the world population three times over. It's ridiculous people still die from hunger, for that alone we should be ashamed. The most important part I think it's the ethics behind all of this, never in history have the humans committed so much suffering and genocide as we do these days. We don't have to argue that humans in many important ways are totally different and valued more than a pig or a cow, but in anyway these non human animals do resemble us; in their care for their children, their ability to feel pain, their social skills... These are ALL characteristics we used to describe moral value to a human being too.. We should talk about how we should see them in our ethical framework, they deserve our ethical consideration and that we recognize the differences we share with these non human animals but only taking them into account when there actually morally relevant. In race for example we recognize it's not a difference in trait that gives these people of different races the same ethical consideration. But if you find the trait that you think it is that differentiate a human being from a non human animal that justify's the differences in treatment. The logic would work as such: you would find the trait, the characteristic, that those non human animals don't have, that if a human being would to also not have we treat the human being like we treat the non human animal.
Well in the future they may start feeding cows seaweed which may help there burping and farting.
what is omicron virus
okay, but how does that compare to lab grown meat?
I love steak…but maybe it the future there should something like meat rations? At least beef rations. Anyway I’m just spitballing ideas while typing haha
at around 2:40 I was expecting to hear "and soy has like 2 to the power of 15 tons of co2 per kilogram"
I consider myself 90% carnivore, but...  I recently tried a sausage that tasted and had EXACTLY the same texture as a nicely peppered kielbasa, even awakened my carnivore-like "bloodthirst" (when your hormones flood your body telling you continue eating da' meat). The future of meat is not bleak, not anymore!
if you care about the future don't have children
Hey Kurzgesagt ! Thanks for your videos. Can you not put some legend or description too low on the screen please ? Sometimes with the subtitles I can't see them. Thanks :)
Sounds like we've got a logistics problem first and foremost. Followed by a planning problem which could use some geologists and climate scientists.
Cutting out meat may free up land to TRY to grow grasslands / trees /etc to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere, but when a majority of the CO2 comes from the travel industry (car/plane/etc), you're only trying to bandaid a solution instead of solving the problem.  Drive electric
What about lab meat? Isn’t that the best way to go about it?
so if we were all vegetarian all the livestock feed would that be enough to feed us healthily? Also a few things we could do would be much better waste management like all the waste from crops, livestock, food, etc should be used to feed insects and the rest composted and used as fertilizer to use less manufactured chemical fertilizer. with those insects we could process into food or at least livestock feed. Also the reason corn(and prob soy) is so cheap to use as feed is government farming subsidies. Its funny how many people are against welfare and public healthcare but don't realize how much public assistance goes to others that are never complained about in numerous subsidies and tax cuts.
this video is very interesting in terms of variety in the topic, when i've done a medical check about my health exept not moving enough, at my ages 18 years old i was in a way better spot than others persons, but the profesionnal said to me that we need proteins from every type of food, even meat, even sugar, the problem is the high quantity of one proteins that can be problematic.  The thing we need to take in consideration is what should we treat cow for a good meat ?, is the nature of the ground were the cow eat is really good ? is the production of the meat too complex for what it should be ?  We never know, time and people will know what to do, everyone can change but depends on how we treat each other.
Who’s winning the vegan teacher will do an episode on this
But without beef where is milk? And cheeeese? I can live without meat but can not live without cheese.
SHORT ANSWER:           absolutely YES!
Nothing is "up to you". There is no free will.
Is meat really that bad? Idk ask a lesbian
I don't think the majority hates meat, they just hate where it came from and how it's retrieved
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old."   I can assure you there is a few drug addicts that would disagree with you.
With everything that’s going on in the world, I’m just going to make sure I eat as much beef as humanly possible.
"No other bodily function is enjoyed multiple times and never gets old"... Well, this is going places.
the duck in the cow suit is just soooooo adorable and cute. Would love a pin or sticker of that <3
I only purchase factory farmed meat to help combat climate change!
mmmm hamburger
no its delicouse
I've been thinking about switching over to non meat products at least red (due to my recent encounter with tofu) But I do have an honest question of if we do start switching over will the drop in farmland for animals be greater than the increase for farmland for us? As they pointed out in the video it takes a lot more vegetable matter to be equivalent to meat so would we actually need more farms?
8:18
Healthy soil nurtures plants and animals and absorbs carbon, monocrop agriculture and factory farming destroys soil. Destroyed soil cannot absorb carbon or support life. There's not enough discussion on the importance of regenerating our soil. Buying "local" is more about supporting soil sustainable farming practices. You can have your beef and eat it too while supporting agriculture that is carbon-negative and enhances local ecosystems.
SHHHHH!!! we don’t want That Vegan Teacher watching. ( this is a joke I am not hating against vegans
im eating chicken while watching this
I curious about considering grassland as carbon sequestering locations.  If cows graze on grass and the roots stay underground, making topsoil, doesn't this offset the effect of cattle to some extent?
This feels like the type of thing that Poison Ivy would commission if she was less homicidal.
I don't like when vegetarians and vegans say they don't like the fact animals are killed to feed us because they're living creatures. It's nature besides plants are living creatures as well that feel and etc. They just don't express it in ways most understand like the cut grass smell is a chemical response to the pain they're feeling.
Go vegan?
The unavoidable emissions 1:11 are assuming we must only use industrial agriculture practices. It's possible to grow food without fertilizer and manure and in existing space. It's possible to rethink the methods and scale we use for food growing. Smaller more localised operations especially people growing at home wouldn't have the same unavoidable emissions. Why don't you do a video about composting waste and repurposing grass lawns to food growing space.
i was dead at the beef stonks
I don't care what you say Im eating it anyways
To all vegans, just know that plants are a slower moving and growing animal that supports the growth of animals. Every time you eat a plant, you’re technically helping kill animals. Take that Vegan Teacher!
Imagine how much mukbang CO2 mukbang eaters produce.
How are you going to ask "Is meat really that bad" and then not examine the direct ethical issues of meat production?
I don’t know if hunger is the best bodily need in terms of satisfaction. Have you ever really had to shit and then actually did it after holding back? Like it’s awesome.
The supply of beef would go down so.. Beef Stonks Go Up
I don’t care, I’m gonna die someday anyway. I’m being selfish but I don’t care. I’m not gonna have descendants anyway because I’m a lonely virgin so I don’t care about the future. I’m gonna do and eat whatever I want because this is my life and for me thats the best thing I could do for myself.
I'd love to see a video about meat substitutes, as I mainly eat these 'fake' versions of meat these days and recently heard they are nearly just as bad in terms of environmental impact. There's been mixed reports on this though from what I can tell.
I dont like what im hearing, but I do hear it. Thank you for presenting the info the way you did.  I decided a while ago to reduce meat in my diet, I dont think I can personally ever get rid of it  but im am reducing it trying to have a healther more balanced diet.  I think alot of people have diets that are too meat heavy which is a health issue  but their choice
moo
I will always eat meat. Cope
Another great video! Thanks! I'd be interested in a comparison of different non-meat alternatives and lab grown meats (once they're scaled up).
So what I got from this is eat more beef. Therefore there are less cows and our carbon footprint is less! ;)
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old”  *Hmm…  I’m  Not  Sure  About  That*
Great video. I guess I'm interested to know - was it factored in that more vegetarian based food would need to be grown? I wonder how much more land would need to be utilized, or if the fact the animal feed land would be freed up would solve that. The caloric and nutrient content is so different between meats and other foods. Now that has me thinking about the nut industry since they are so calorically dense. This is a huge rabbit hole to fall into! Very interesting, despite the impending doom.
I have persuaded my mum to eat beef of sheep only once or twice a week. Even if we do I only eat a small part. We try and find more reliable brands and so far it has been good. My health has improved a fair bit
I don't eat meat because there's no reason for animals to suffer. Period. It's not got anything to do with climate.
Humans need to stop being lazy and start hunting, gathering and growing their own food..
Anyone else not eat that much beef? Like yeah i have the occasional cheeseburger but. I would be 100% happy to cut down on whatever beef I do eat and go to a plant based substitute. I'd be interested to see how the push for EV's and the effect of petrol / diesel cars stacks up against food production in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions.
So... Yes?
VeGaN:animal abuse
What about fish?
The CO2 graph at 8:33 is out of scale. You compare the CO2 removed from the plants and tree in a scale of 100 years. And then put the CO2 emitted per year. Yes ofc the CO2 removed is much higher (800B) as It is in a period of 1 century. If you multiple the total amount of CO2 in 100 years it's 5000B, that whole area we just planted doesn't even get rid of 20% of all the emitted CO2. Bad graph and people will interpret it wrongly.
No I would be brain dead without chicken and steak
Imagine believing in Chinese hoax climate change nonsense in 2021. Pass the burger, hippie, I'm eating double meat.
moral issue
all the talk about climate change and nobody is willing to take the political hit of saying that we will never have enough renewables to sustain our current ways of life. Change in lifestyle is the only way to actually reduce emissions, otherwise we're just outsourcing it to different places. But that's inconvenient, so it'll never happen.
This seemed mildly biased in my opinion... yes beef constitutes a decent sized carbon footprint, but what about all of the products the by products of the cows (or other animals when its not beef!) help to create? How does the carbon footprint of producing those products without the animals compare to the way they are made with them? What about the use of manure in order to increase crop yields with fertilizer? You didn't even mention the fact that these animals can eat large parts of the crops we farm for food that would otherwise be used as compost, such as corn stalks. What about a land comparison of the calorie production between raising animals and farming?  Great video overall, just left out a few key points that I hear a lot.
I'm really curious to see how hunting can be taken into consideration. From my understanding, at an individual level, hunting is the most environmentally friendly way to obtain meant, but hunting cannot be done at the scale of the human population because that will most definitely destroy certain parts of the ecology. The impact of mass fishing is a good example.
Came for the topic, stayed for the beef stonks meme at 8:15. Great video!
This video is much needed. First and foremost we need to ban private jets alltogether, and also stop Brazil from destroying our planet.
Hey just a merch  idea I didn’t get to post on the last video. Can you make a pin or shirt or sweater, with a happy duck siting on top of earth with the Kurtzgesagt text on the bottom? It would look awesome
If we stop all meat production what will feed the cats?
Even Kurzgesagt went woke...
kinda weird how theres this huge push to get regular people to give up the few things they still can afford an enjoy to lower their carbon footprint when multi national corporation and militaries like the US have dont really care about any of that
Just legalize cannibalism. Like with other animals you don't need to eat all parts of a human. So the illness caused by eating human brains and other parts would not really be a problem if you don't eat it. Emissions from cannibalism would be in the negative. Vegans are grain fed humans.
When the other 74% of emissions has been dealt with, I'll consider giving up meat. Until I see some real, actual dedication to stopping climate change I'm not going to worry about it. Life is too short to be spent worrying about how you as a single person affect the planet when there are giant corporations or countries even that are multitudes worse
now I know how bad eating meat is but I still am going to eat meat
Hello guys!  There are some informations spreaded out wrongly, mainly by non-specialized media, about my country (Brazil) and the situation of forests in the national territory (tropical forests are just one of the brazilian biomes). First of all, the problems with wild fires happened on a global scale due to a sum of many factors that are really hard to summarise in a few words. We've heard of wildfires across the United States, Australia, and almost every country in Central Africa, so please, don't contribute to a narrative that is enriched with hidden interests that are difficult to be fully traced.   Brazil is not devastating or burnning down the amazon area for the cultivation of soybeans. The vast majority of  national production is highly mechanized and efficient per hectare, coming from states in the southern and midwestern regions, therefore, far from dense areas of forest. I'm not saying that there isn't a challenge in Brazil to reduce problems with fires and illegal appropriation of forest spaces, or responsibilities with rapid climate change and agricultural production, but Brazil is a country that still preserves approximately 66% of it's total territory, with at least 84% of the tropical forest in a mature and/or virgin state.  Please, keep up with the great job bringing reliable and cientific content to your channel, because those discussions cannot remain shallow and inconsequential, especially in your videos.
Eating is the best thing about being alive! Now stop eating.
Personally I’ve been vegetarian since I was a very young for personal choices, but I really like learning about both sides of this type of argument
Eat the rich, problem solved
I’m perfectly fine with veggie burger patties. One of many problems seems to be convincing the Ron Swansons of the world.
Ok, I get it, but give us a video on how the vegan diet affects the human body. I'm far from an expert, but I do know that what we eat and how we eat is a huge part of our physical and mental health. Is vegan eating REALLY healthy for us? I'm not arguing against veganism, but is it really the way to go for our continued thriving on this planet? Or does it lower our own lifespans for the greater good? And that point, is throwing away our lifespans (if that happens to be the case). Really worth giving up this one life that we may have? It may hurt future lives, but we don't know what truly happens after we die, if we live on after, then this method is for the best. But if we don't, what's stopping us from being selfish to make sure that our own lives are lived to the fullest?
yeah i cant help but not eat meat im eating my beef patties and steaks bro
I can think of a bodily pleasure I do everyday that doesn’t get old 🤫😰😰
if its dead, yes
No
the real issue is that theirs too many people on earth  to live like Americans/Europeans  if we stop having kids we can but if we have more well... we will have to move on to not just vegetables but maybe insect matter
Good thing the dislikes are removed so stupid vegans can’t do anything LOL
yes
Nothing can stop me from eating meat😋
Essentially to stop this everything must die,that way no animals will be farting or adding any pollution through production or transportation,and if we don't exist we won't be making any pollution or needing food.
What does it mean some share of crops is used in industry? How can industry use it other than for feeding animals or people?
The thing I was confused about was how you didn't mention how cows get fed as well much of our food waste which would otherwise be useless to us. I feel like putting that into account could show how much cows save us from overfilling trash with food items.  Oh and I want to add it could've been easier for me to understand how much CO2 meat produces if compared to popular plant products like how nuts like almonds take extreme amounts of effort to grow like their high CO2 emissions and their insane water cost.  That's all, I would really like a response to help me fully understand the point being made.
I wonder, when they are considering transportation emissions do they take into account everything that actually goes into transporting? Like what it took to create those big metal crates and shipping containers that are on the boats? Or what the upkeep and maintenance cost and emissions cost difference is for a huge ocean transport ship vs a semi truck/food delivery truck? Not the emissions that ship or truck produce outright, what emissions are used in the process of maintaining them to stay in safe working order.... And what about hunting animals for your food? Like hunting wild invasive hogs, or fishing for invasive fish here in the US like Asian carp?  People hate on hunting so much, but it's much better for the environment than other methods of producing meat for you and your family, as long as you follow and respect hunting rules and regulations.
Go vegan,  Animals are living beings that do not want to die. They are a soul. Don't eat dead corpses, don't eat dead flesh. Simple as that.  Go vegan
A wise woman once said "I love animals, but I also eat them"
Vegan teacher: yeah I'll just use the negatives
I still wanna know how much emissions this over-produced veggie/vegan patty emits
I wanted to hear more! And the video ended on me! 😤
don't care, smd.
Demon cow is gonna be a core memory now
While do want to improve environment I just go without meat for more than a couple days.
The root of many problems is actually just a steep population growth. The more people are there, the more things suddenly become a problem.
Sounds like we as humanity need to act quick
There’s no dislikes? This is a monumental day!
ok so this answered the question "Is Beef Really that Bad?". Would be great to have the same detailled comparison with pig and chicken. And even more interesting would be a comparison to insects, although I suppose there isn't enough data around to make a solid claim.
8:07 I wish I could hold my burger like this
Now I'm seeing why YouTube removed the dislike button.
personally, I quite literally cannot go without meat - primarily due to a genetic disorder I have, causing my body to have trouble producing hemoglobin efficiently, and for a reason I don't fully understand (just going off what my doctors have told me) iron supplements are much less effective for me than eating meat. I try to go with the lowest-carbon options for my food, but going without iron-rich meats isn't an option for me.
video
The backing music to this video gives me "Plants vs Zombies" vibes.
Remember, it doesn't have to be all or nothing. Love cheese and milk too much? Cut out beef but keep dairy. Diet is a huge part of our lifestyle, so changing it bit by bit instead of all at once will be more successful.
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive"  Fat people: indeed
b'ah. As thorough as you guys usually are, it still feels like you missed some key things here that are skewing the statistics too much. I know this is really detailed, but there's a ratio of methane that was pulled from the air by grass. That isn't "new" emissions like burning coal/oil. That's emissions that were there and mostly got put back. Then as others have stated, the transportation examples seem to have left off the last mile. Feels like you compared shipping efficiencies with last mile cost. But you still have the last mile when shipping. You just now have the ocean liners emissions PLUS last mile emissions. So that's overal worse?  Then there's different types of cows. Especially in dairy. US dairy cows are waaaaay more efficient than, say, india's cows. There's a lot to cut down there alone.   So these potential misses in comparing data make it hard to know if your calculations are correct when comparing meat to vegetables. Did you look into how much is by-products of vegetables vs intentionally grown for cattle? Was the difference taken into account that when you remove 100 cows, then you also have to clear land for farming? Like you said, a decent chunk of land that is used isn't arable. That land will have to be replaced.   And then the biggest point of all. Food is 26% overall. Removing beef would clear up some 15%. That's great and all, but I think it's a moot point until we solve that other 74%. B/c that's asking a lot of peopel to give up something they really enjoy for a marginal gain. Especially when this is extremely hard to accurately compare.
I'm just waiting for lab grown beef. But obviously it has to be priced on par with regurlar or close enough to be a valid choice.  Truth is, I'm never going to stop eating meat but it could be better like the lab grown meat but how long will it take to get that?
F O O D
finally, a english version for this video
Been vegan for 2 months, I think animals deserve some rights, I'd I was a cow I wouldn't want to be eaten.
Congrats Kurzgesagt for 17 Million 🎉🎉
Good job brazil
Excellent video as always,  but i think you're focusing a lot on carbon. In terms of biodiversity, there are some advantages with breeding beef cattle. A video aroud the trade offs between carbon and biodiversity would be amazing !
The only compromise I'm seeing here is to stop destroying integral environments to create pastures, I'm all for replacing them with with factories because i only care about the emissions not the animals themselves. That seems fair
why not just use the methane as fuel? Why not use carbon capture?   I am all for letting people choose to eat less meat. But, I will happily eat the meat that they dont decide to eat.
It seems a significant portion of the meat problem is Brazilian deforestation.  If Brazil behaved itself and grew beef in a manner more in line with other countries' methods, how would that change the numbers?
Nice
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old”.   Ummmm yes that’s the ONLY ONE..:.
It's a good thing Rapid climate change is complete rubbish!
Meat is yummy 😋
Lab-grown meat is the answer 🥳
Meat is so obsolete these days. If you live in a developed country and have your basic needs met, there's no need to consume it whatsoever.  I haven't touched it in 7 years and as long as I'm still happy and healthy, I'm not planning to make it part of my diet ever again.
as of this moment the video has 107K Likes and 3.4K dislikes (I use the return youtube dislike plugin)
8:15 bef stonks*
Just save beef for really important events in our life. Do not consume it in low-quality burgers. There is no appreciation in taste in that burgers.
You guys should put "well... It's complicated" into a t-shirt
this is the worst climate change argument, sure meat results in more emissions than vegetables. But vegetables still produce more than 0, so following the logic that we should all just stop eating all together and save the planet that way. The true question is how much meat can we eat and live a comfortable life worth living.
I'm not willing to go full vegan. However, if we let a bunch of land go back to forest/grassland, doesn't that mean there would be more deer and elk to hunt?
8:14 *STONKS* Lol, seems like theh keep up with the memes
How does the current "crop" of lab-grown beef stack up?  I would expect it would be a whole lot less than growing an entire animal with it's ruminant digestion system (which is what produces so much methane, AFAIK).
Keep seeing the same comments talking about the first sentence of the video, but not actually commenting about the video. It hit hard, and is absolutely on point. I'm pescatarian, and I'm trying to reduce my fish intake, as it's also terrible for the environment, but mostly sticking to plant based junk foods, haha. The video and explanations were fantastic. Wonderful job as always.
B E E F S    T    O    N   K    S
Red meat heals.  A diet comprised of inferior plant foods is exactly what the pharmacuetical industry wants.  The more chronically ill people to pump meds into the better.  They failed to mention that regenerative beef agriculture can be net carbon negative.  There were more bison roaming the americas prior to colonization than there are cattle on the planet presently and now we think a vegan diet is going to solve the problem.  Something doest add up.  1 red pill a day keeps a dystopian globalist dictatoship away.
When you guys did the first meat video and suggested to go atleast one meal a week vegetarian, our family did. Would be great to get nation wide ads on this.
One issue with the "feeding cattles with plants humand could eat" is that it completely neglects that we humans don't want tk eat all the parts of plants. There's stems and other byproducts making up most of the weight of a plant that humans can't digest or are too picky to eat, but cows can thanks to their stomach. There's also lots of byproducts from food factories that gets fed to animals. Just think of all the peels from potatoes, apples etc. when buying stuff that has apples in it. Same goes for most things we eat. Even fish gets grinded into powder and fed to animals.  I'd have loved a dive into this topic as I'm curious as to how much food humans would *actually* eat gets fed to cows.
I'm going to keep eating meat, thanks.
beSOYds 8:57
I think the video needs another deepening taking into account how (for example) every country is different in the diet and how we can also change and educate our habits in consumption of meet... that is something that in my opinion has the potentail to play a big role in the matter... education and promoting it.
The reality of climate change and “carbon allocations” is that populations are unsustainable. We’re working with the idea of every country and city becoming first world and as such, pluck fictional “carbon budgets” out of thin air.   The reality is, places like India, China and Africa have really missed the on ramp of history in regards to development.   With billions of populations in these countries now being artificially supported by fragile supply systems. The sheer numbers of import/export just to sustain, let alone grow are immense and stretch this mythical “carbon targets” or “allocations”.  Just like Africa, with population increases after billions of $$$ aid, during what normally would have been population culling famine.   Human climate change is being driven by unchecked over populations in 3rd world and “developing” countries. Most 1st world countries have stabilised populations naturally (if you ignore rampant immigration, which in itself distorts any climate change argument, even food production)  Population reduction in 3rd world and developing countries is our only hope.
What if vegan teacher see this lol
Steve Taylor whispering at the end hit me surprisingly hard
Watching the video I had a thought. Grass fed isn't as good as other ways. What if a new grass could be bred or made that would be more nutritious so more grain could be freed up. Just a thought.
Thanks for doing this, it's a great reference. What the 'crazy' vegans have been saying for decades. Now what's the bet the comments are full of people trying to find ways to justify their meat diet. Just dig in and find the moral fibre to give it up, seriously it's the least you can do for the planet and the poor animals that line the slaughterhouses as we speak.
planting trees to remove CO2 Alge *crying cat meme*
wait didn't you already make a video on this
This is why I became vegan, I can't stand dead animals for food
Who ever has a body that will benefit from vegan vegetarian diet, should do it. People who’s body can’t handle full switch, cut down in meat consumption? I messed up my DT when I went vegan. I still support people who do it.
Stopped eating beef a while ago.  Dont eat much meat either.   I found i LOVE chick peas. And they are versetile so i use it in everything. From tacos to lasagna
The majority of this information is objectively false and has been debunked in recent statistical analyses and studies.
you lost me in the first 10 seconds, "we should change what and how we eat to fight rapid climate change."  nope.  "even if we took out all other carbon emissions.."  that's never gonna happen either, but 74% is bigger than 26.  We definitely should change how we produce our food and improve, but meat is part of what provides our genetics, those proteins are essential and I think there's something inherently dangerous about replacing them with artificial options, regardless of environmental impact.  YouTube really screwed the pooch taking away the dislike count.
many species extinct because of humans meat eating habit. so it is sure bad, badest
3 words Lab grown food
im watching this while eating beef
I swear before in the title it had climate change too "is meat bad for climate change" or somet
First world as a whole needs to buy a very generous price the Amazon traditional area but same for the worlds forests and jungle. Note these would still be considered part of that country they in but just that what the country could do in that areas very restricted. Direct buy out of people living there included don't let the government steel their share. Then defend it with a competent UN force that can shoot. Selling it not optional by countries involved sanctions to nuclear strikes if necessary for agreement would be used but probably nothing stronger than blockades would be njssasary. Making these jungle again would help greatly.   Mistake it seams comparing factory vs grass land there are way less grass land animals involved thus way less emissions. I know they were going for same level of production not the much lower production that only grass feed would be.   Mistake should briefly mention we don't have to get rid of all greenhouse emissions just enough to return to a correct level and there are greenhouse capture things that can be done. It a complex thing.   Termites produce massively larger levels than beef production. What can we do to lower this is a question without harming their needed role in recycling trees in forests.   Reason movement overall did not touch meat at first as they were talking about eliminating new sources of greenhouse gasses things already in the methane cycle were not consider a priority as it the massive increase of CO2 from new processing.   Me eliminate factory farming I can eat less meat.   The artificial diet of Vegans I still don't consider long term healthy. B12 and K don't exist in natural sources other than meat. And Vegetarian cultures produce much smaller weaker people although they are longer live when they avoid B12 deficiencies that the three most vegetarian countries have major problem with.   My Vegan sister in law had to start eating red meat as she can't absorb vegetable iron sources. The calcium in darry is a different chemical compound than artificial sources and way better absorbed the massive increase in bone density problem certainly fueled by people stopping dairy consumption by choice or fact that only whole milk good to drink so they quit milk after drinking low fat.  There is a milk fat that more and more studies show is very good for you. Low levels of red meat and a decent amount of whole fat milk is in the two healthiest diets studied in depth the Mediterranean and Japanese diet.   Me yep lets cut back meat production without causing these animals to go extinct letting them live as freely as safe there still are predators. And put efforts into massively increasing forest growth. Sea plant farming efforts should get more efforts as well.   The greatest threats in climate change are still the non food areas and the greatest threat in food area are massively increasing populations so unless your calling for killing massive number of them hard to stop but a few percentages of change from meat production in the food area.  Unfortunately I don't see climate change being fixed democracies just can't get populations to agree to cut back needed and even the same in dictatorships worried about revolts or just wanting to please themselves and their rich friends. Environmental record of totally socialist countries horrible.
Let's face it. Plants are sentient living beings that deserve life as much as something that happens to have a central nervous system. It's reprehensible that plants are subjected to horrific conditions of factory farming. It's an incredible moral failing on our part.
hey what if we put all the nuclear bombs in the Mariana trench and blow them up what would happen
I would love to see you do a video around trophy hunting.
I wonder about the emissions of lab grown meats. Sad that Kuzgesagt didn't get to it, but the video was well researched so I can't complain to much.
Yet another perfectly made video, made by one of my favorite educational youtubers. This one let me learn more about how meats and such impact climate change, and also how I could help against our current biggest threat, in the long run, anyway. I highly recommend subscribing to this channel, as they always include their sources in the description, as well as their music, and links to their several other communities with similar interests. They even support different languages.  Just know that every time this community uploads a new video, it's always going to teach you something, and you'll always enjoy doing so.
If we cut out meat and just ate the feed crops, would we be okay nutrition-wise? Because I know pure calories aren't the only thing we need food for. And what about cutting out eggs and dairy? What effect would come from using only cotton and petroleum products instead of wool, leather, fur, feathers, and silk? And how would eliminating farm animals affect the fertilizer situation?
I'm surprised your video didn't go into cultured meat production at all. It's a way to produce meat without killing animals and both frees up land and uses much less resources.
The animation on this one was absolutely phenomenal, it just keeps getting better. Great job handling a complex topic.
I'm honestly surprised that Kurzesagt wasn't in on TeamSeas, they are really passionate about climate change
In the case of the Amazon you forgot that deflorastation for pasture is even more inefficient. The Amazon rain forest has a self sustained cicle of life. That is a layer of fertile land that it is sustained by the decomposition of organic matter coming from the rain forest. When deflorestation happen, that cycle is broken and after a few years the layer is used up and what is left is a land that sometimes cannot grow even pasture.
i hope theres a part 2 for this, what about the state of cultivated/lab meat assuming there's any data that is available. and how big is this on the global scale, ie, if the whole world went veggy how much of an impact would it be or what if everyone suddenly only ate meat how much worse would we be off
An Idea to raise livestock that combines the space saving benefits of factory cattle and the better quality meat of dairy cattle:  We could build large artificial pastures that collect the methane released by the cattle, which produce meat and dairy products. These artificial pastures could be built to stacked on top of each other to save space and still keep up with the demands of he world. This design could be used for other livestock as well. The methane could be used to generate power that could bring us a little bit more off coal and some oil in terms of energy. I'm not sure if methane can be used for vehicle fuel. These structures could also produce at least some of the feed for the animals to take some of the pressure off the land the world has.  I don't know how feasible this is, but I thought it was a good idea.
One issue that wasnt quite touched on is that locally sourced meat doesn't just mean transportation emissions are reduced, it means vital ecosystems like rainforests arent destroyed for herds, which is a bigger factor than the transportation itself
vegan teacher is typing...
0:46 there’s a cow!
Well, good quality video as always. But comparison at the end of beef patty to other high protein or animal foods would be superb. Beef and crops feed people in different ways,  you need to somehow provide every person with around at least 40g protein a day, b12, d2.
Share this with @That Vegan Teacher so we can laugh
Short answer: no Long answer: it’s complicated
What about pesticides used in farm lands ?
So we basically should get rid of 99% of beef and lamb, as long as we keep chicken I'm okay with it!
Can you compare it to impossible meat as well?
Why is the Killer T-Cell on the food table at 9:45 ? =)))
loved the “stonks” meme scene
The good news: potatoes are awesome!
We may kill the cows, but the cows will slowly kill us
Lab meat. Imagine, a factory the size of a midsize building, making as much meat as a farm with enough resources.
Decrease non food first...
Aaannnnnnnnnnnnnndddd...... *FIGHT!!!!!!*
Honestly I wouldn’t mind being a vegetarian that much but vegan meh that shit ain’t for me
I have not eaten mammal in years, but I'm curious about the impact of beef on emissions here in the US specifically. I've heard that it's only a few percent of our total emissions and it's other countries that have a larger livestock impact. This video says we would have to reduce our beef usage by 70% if we switched to grazing only. That sounds cool. I imagine that would lower cow emissions to less than 30% of current since grass fed beef has a lower impact. I agree with the concern about land usage and using rainforest, but I don't know how I feel about getting rid of cows altogether. Maybe reduce and replace cows with naturally grazing Buffalo? I've heard on different programs that their used to be a lot of buffalo in the US and they are important to the natural ecology. I wonder what their methane impact was.
I'm not sure if that was included in any of the data you showed, but did you address that cattle can also eat parts of vegetables we usually don't, like roots and leaves? Wouldn't that make a difference in carbon footprint as most of these would be discarded anyway?
I'm not going to stop eating meat. But I'll definitely consume less and I like this video.
I'm eating a cheeseburger right now.
I love how the answer to the title question is "yes, it is".
Methane from cows is not a net addition of gases to the atmosphere. What the cow gives off was bound by the plant before.
A lot of the comments here are along the lines of:   'Great video. You're right about meat being bad for the environment BUT what about almonds, what about cars, what if raise billions of insects and grind them into a protein paste?'  Is the fact that meat and dairy are terrible for the environment  AND inflict a terrible amount of suffering on fellow creatures not enough of a reason to TRY and go vegan wherever possible?  If you go into videos like this not willing to have an open mind or change your opinions based on the facts laid out then what's the point of watching videos like this?
9:21 Why did you compare 100 years of CO2 removed to 1 year of CO2 emitted?
In the comparison between local and global food, was transport from the harbor to the shop to the home taken into account? The comparison only seems useful when comparing farm to home in both cases. Great video though, don't get me wrong.
But can you explain how animals lived roaming around in their habitat and now they are producing carbon emmisions (methane)? I can't understand this milions of years vs 100-150 🤨🤔
So sad that people in my country make fun of the climate change(
I wasn’t aware of the shop local part. Even better: try to grow stuff if you can 👍🏼 I wondered when you’d get to the land and feed issue 😅. It was sad to hear that being inhumane is more environmental 😬.
You're awesome like always. My beef is not going away. We have high technology, we have thousands of minds working on the problem and I can't conceive the ideia that we should dramatically change the human diet to save the planet. The beef stays!!!
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day..."    Wait, what about _Fucking?_
Soon we'll print meat and this whole thing will be obsolete.  Might take a decade or two, but we're there.
Stonks
yeah there is no way that meat will be good for CO2 so and giving up meat at a global level is unlikely so.... change the meat rather change the animal. Time for genetic engineering to step up.
I never understood the cow methane issue. I mean, if they are going to live, they will produce methane, if we stop eating meat, they will live more to produce more methane. Should we kill em? No. So that part of beef emission is not valid I believe
Im looking forward to the German Version so i can show the video to my parents
Is Immune still in stock?
Big Beef reporting this video in 3...2...1...
Everytime Kurzgesagt uploads my day gets 10x better. <3
I would like to underline something. Buying local is like individualised protectionnism. If everyone was buying local it would be like the country put down protectionnist laws : it would have the same effects. Which is forbidden by the International laws of Trade  PS : I m showing the irony of the situation not criticising buying local
OMG this is the best video! You have done well and taught the world well. I am trying to go vegetarian ever since Cop26, and it didn't really work. This might help, however. Keep it up. 👍👏
fuck no.
If killing animals is an holocaust.. Does that make me Meattler?
@kurzgesagt  Vertical farming for meat production. Is this something that could be used to counter, though definitely not reverse the damage the industry is causing? Land use is something this would help with, and depending on methane capture capabilities, could even create fuel sources.  Does this even seem plausible? Sure expensive as all get out, but any solution to climate change at this point in time will be.
Meat destroys the environment and it destroys your health.
Never ceases to amaze me with the quality of their videos. Thank you for stating the information and letting the viewer decide. Love all the cute and funny Easter eggs throughout the video. My favorites were at 8:16 and  9:54 🐦 haha
When my country gets mentioned in this channel, it's never a good thing... I really hate how the people of my country managed to elect such a garbage human being in Bolsonaro.
No! Don't tell us to do what we want with this info, we will continue eating the wrong foods that makes the animals suffer and the temperatures rise 😔
Meat is a necessary part of your diet to he optimally healthy and even if it wasn't and it would eventually one day lead to the end of the world if I kept eating it, I still would because I would rather die and condemn the rest of the world than give up my meat. I don't even care. Yes, I'm selfish. Don't care.
I love how we're just casually looking past the ethical stand point of consuming animal flesh.  Seriously, how are we even still debating this? There is no difference in pigs, chickens, lambs, cows and fish to say our beloved pet animals, dogs and cats in the ways that matter most. They all want to be free of pain and suffering.  Yet how can we argue that there is a humane way to do this? Have you seen the process of raising animals in factory settings and the last moments in a slaughterhouse? It is horrific! Most people can't even watch it, yet they are happy to keep supporting it.  So not only is plant based foods more appropriate to switch to help climate change and to even improve your health! but it's the most ethical thing to do which should be the most important thing, right?
What is the slice of the pie if you include all greenhouse gas emissions. Like what percentage are we making vs everything.
This all seems like it's building up to how practical and necessary a massive culling of humanity will be. Great reset fun times for 90% of humanity.
Thanks, Kurtzgesagt. I wanted to dive into this topic but it's so controversial that I was afraid of getting any information about. Thank  you, for real
kill all the cows before converting that land to crops, still get your meat and are starting to help the enviornment
Well, I'm just glad I'm vegan. Doing my part.
What if you only eat wild game
I just wanted to eat my big Mac in peace :(
Can you make a vid discussing insect diet? It's a seriously untapped potential where you don't have worry about animal abuse
What food, if not beef is equivalent in protein? It's not entirely about the carbon footprint, it's about what you do with the protein. If all you do is sit around and do nothing, then _yes_ the meat and emissions that come with it is put to waste. If on the other hand you use meat as part of a balanced diet to _do physical activity_ with and said activity benefits your society, suddenly that argument changes.  Humanity could _survive_ on soy and plant-based protein. But for objective which require strength, where protein is directly responsible for muscle development it put into question what foods could replace beef? There's a reason why it tastes _good_ to most people, and that's because not only of its buttery texture and rich taste if cooked correctly, but also because the body benefits most from it.  And what about emissions from wild animals? We never account for that. Humanity can't be zero-emission because we mammals breathe, fart and burp too. The ideal argument then, if we want for humanity to not be as impactful on the environment is a mass culling of the human race. But _that's_ not friendly to anyone reading this at all.  War — endless, ceaseless war — ironically then can be a boon for humanity not only technologically, but also environmentally. Disregarding emissions from heavy machinery, a mass death of humanity can lead to less emissions and less need to cultivate land for farm use because there are less humans to feed overall, and less nature being destroyed so long we have a gentleman's agreement to not go nuclear.
I don't eat local to reduce CO2 emissions, I eat local (and in-season) to support local businesses, and to not mess up the lives of local farmers elsewhere (for example, farmers in Chile who had all their water supplies robbed by big avocado mafias). For the CO2 emissions, I only walk or use public transportation, I limit overseas traveling, I don't go crazy on the heating and I live a semi-minimalist lifestyle (i.e. less pollution from producing and throwing stuff). And no kids. Besides, when you eat imported (and not-in-season) crops, there may be all this extra step in refrigeration + crops picked when they are not yet ripe and thus less tasty.  I do eat plant-based (though I always have, as a vegetables-loving half-Chinese), and avoid fast foods (and thus their cheap mass-produced meat). The price tag of a good local, non-factory-farmed chicken makes me wince, but oh well, I buy that only occasionally and that chicken gets divided into 10 portions (most go immediately into the freezer) instead of being eaten in just a couple of meals.

That vegan teacher is going to SPEEDRUN a commentairy on this video!
Thanks for this one! luv ya
Every time someone tells me I shouldn't eat beef because it's "bad for the planet" I make sure to eat a double cheeseburger for dinner. Environmentalists and vegans can f*** off.
i need my gainz 💪💪
These kind of videos are my least favorite, but it says something that this is probably gonna be my most memorable video this month
Is there a limit of how much pain a human can feel at once?
The turkeys at the start……. THEY ARE HAVING TURKY
What about eating fish?
I was dreading it but I still felt sad when I saw Kurzgesagt quoting Poore…that study was insanely cherry picked. Their ‘lowest’ emissions from beef was higher than I’ve seen LCA for various European beef production. This also leads to an incorrect conclusion that the best of beef is worse than the worst of plant based. For instance textured tofu has a higher co2e LCA than Irish produced beef. Why? Because Ireland has both high productivity and grass fed.    But it got worse…’cattle in factory farms’ not able to graze. These animals don’t exist. Even in very intensive systems in the US most calves are reared on extensive grazing before entering their final stage, the beef finishing process. That’s where you see feedlots (the term ‘factory farm’ is a dead give away for the bias of the researcher in this case). Interesting that Kurzgesagt didn’t use FAO study into this topic that showed 86% of feed for livestock is human inedible, with ruminants contributing a net increase in protein even including feed (source: FAO, Livestock: On our plates or eating at our table 2017). A far more reputable source. In addition the use of 25% rather than the more accurate 14.5% of global emissions related (source: FAO, Tackling Climate Change through Livestock 2013, IPCC 2021) Final conclusion as someone who studied agriculture with a focus on climate change mitigation, this looks like an objective video from Kurzgesagt but isn’t anywhere near their normal standard. Shows signs of cherry picking and bias, but more significantly a lack of agricultural SCIENCE education in the researchers
damn that animated food looks good
That’s really incredible, thank you for this video and the knowledge!  ..next book topic? 🤞🏼  ✌🏼 🇨🇦
Can you do a video on lab grown meat? Is it good for the environment? Is it ethical? Will it be replacing regular meat anytime soon?
would like to see a Kurzgesagt video about global economics and hypothetical scenarios/what if's. The old space & discovery videos were good, but the recent trend of environmental & political videos is getting starting to get old...
I started eating roasted cricket powder—not only does it have a lot of protein among other things, it has chitin which is an insoluble fiber that really helps with digestion.  I hope things like crickets and mushrooms become more common
meat made us humans!
I heard not long ago (it may have been via Veritasium?) that a recent study showed that changing cattle's diet with ~10% seaweed supplement can reduce methane emissions by up to 90%. I really hope this is true and further study can confirm, then it can be quickly adopted. Seaweed is pretty easy to farm, is my understanding.
No one will stop eating meat if the issue becomes political. Meat is part of evolution and humans aren't plan eaters, not even monkeys rely just on plants....
I'm poor
Cutting beef out of your diet won't do shit. The beef farms will want to keep scaling up production as much as they can even if demand drops. If demand drops the margins will drop, but overall they will make more money.
I feel like this video wasn't in-depth enough.
I heard : food is best thing that used to be alive
Almost thought this was gonna be about Happy Meat Farms
Cant everyone just stop coming up with excuses and saying that they are not excuses but they are. We should all just become vegans and save the planets. Because I dont want to live on the same earth as people that finds arguments to destroy earth. Just think about it. It is absurd
are you serious? Why aren't you speaking about ethical consomation? Eating beef or tofu it's not the big issue. The fact is most of the masse production are destroying our environnement. If you masse produce beef or masse produce tofu there will be hudge issues in our climat. If you go to the market and once a week to a local butchery working with ethical farmer your impact be respectfull for the nature. People thinks you must feer meat because of masse production industrie Same for palm oil. Jute think about this : - palm oil is the less ressource needed oil to use. If you choice to use other oil, you gonna use more water and nee more felds. Using a ethical palm oil is kinda the best way to avoid to destroy the planet -boar can be a pice of s*heet for local farmer. If you need to kill them when they began a pest, eating them it's not gonna make you a bl*ody  part of the GrowVegatalToFeedAnimals. Please release more immune system videos. Thoses videos about nuclear, food blabla are quite interesting but it's some real sensitive topic. (Sorry for my bad english ! wish you a good day)
How about labrotory grown meats ???  Made from cells grown in right  conditions for now its costly but in near future might be cheap
Всё, первые звоночки за тотальнейшую пропаганду "дерьмоеды"пошли. Видимо, капиталисты поняли, что больше не потянут объемы производства мяса и нужно срочно пересаживать население на чисто полевую траву
Lmao you bozos i dont live at the docks 😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 a truck comes and picks up the product and drives it around the city anyway who is so dumb to believe this shit 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 "Shiping is efficient" yea right. because no such thing as OIL SPILL EXIST
Since veggie burgers have become equally tasty as beef based, veggies are surely an alternative along with beef.
Perishable goods aren't usually shipped on freight ships because they can expire easy. I understand the example but it's kinda weird to put bananas on a cointainer ship :P
Humans are never going to stop eating meat & byproducts. The conversations needs to pivot from all or nothing, to moderation matters. Meatless Monday’s or things like this are a great way to reduce your consumption if you’re not going to give it up entirely. Great work on this video!
Hi
Well if we close down farms and release the animals. There's only one way to get some steak... (Loads Shotgun)             You gotta HUNT
Does this mean we could use GMO technology to reduce cows producing methane?
To me ALL these problems we are having is because the planet is over populated …simple ..global warming and everything else is is just a byproduct of it ….
You've ignored regenerative agriculture. You've ignored food waste thats fed to animals. You've ignored that the food "cultivated for animals" is mostly inedible by humans. You've ignored the real "problem" of climate change if you believe that premise.
lets talk nutrition. animal based protein, is 30-40% absorbed by humans. Plant based, only 10-20% absorbed. unless this is changed and we get whole governments to fix this, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ENERGY OR MONEY doing what environmentalists want. Enjoy that nice steak. yall dont want nuclear power, but dont want fossil fuels being used... Too bad. the electrical grid couldnt handle all solar or wind, and would require literal states filled with both to even me significant on a country scale. Im not wasting thousands of my hard earned income worrying about my extremely minisicle carbon footprint, this is a government problem, and they dont care anyways. its all about the almighty dollar.
Just gonna say that - for even animal you don't eat, I'll eat two. 🍱🍝🥚🥓🥓🍖🍗
You are coming at this problem all wrong. This is an over population problem.
Great job! keep up the good work
This video is the damn attack of the strawman
There’s only one solution to this: We must do all the farming stuff on other planets, or even space vessels, I know it’ll be challenging, but I don’t see how doing that would be bad in any way.
Look basically I'm not stopping eating meat. I know.... UGH.... I know! I'm sorry!!!!!!!!!!  it's just that I'm not stopping is all.    HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
And just like that, my week just got better.  Love it when he uploads!!!
Man, that ending had a "The Lorax" feel to it. Nice job all!
therapist: front facing kurzgesagt bird isn’t real, it can’t hurt you front facing kurzgesagt bird: 0:24
mee thane? con traw versy?  still an awesome video. just thought that the pronunciations were funny haha
Well....... we are fucked
It’s not even December and kurzgeagt posted a vid noice
I'm not sure whether it was cut in the editing, but in the transporting avocadoes from South America to Europe at a low carbon cost example, does that include the 'local transport' from the port of Rotterdam or Antwerp to the actual store? I mean it's not that people buy their avocadoes at the shipping port. So if transporting 1k of beef from a slaughterhouse to the butcher generates 18kg's of CO2eq, wouldn't the transport from the port to store of 1kg of...well anything, not also add the same 18kgs of CO2eq, assuming a similar distance?  Or is it just to explain that local producing has only a negligible positive impact on total emissions, _because_ shipping is so damn efficient these days?
Is it possible to filter out carbon dioxide from the air, turn it into dry ice, and package it to keep it out of the air and if so can someone else do it because I have a extremely small budget
Feel like lab grown meat would be epic. Imagine having meat without even having an animal involved.
One month for 12min 😔😔😔  Gg always a good one tho 💪💪💪
arigato gomeismas
5:10 the earth be like 👁️👄👁️
So we're just not going to talk about upcycling? Gonna ignore that humans can't eat most of the parts of most of the plants we grow and those are the parts that are fed to cows? The fact that half the world's fertiliser comes from livestock, and the other half is produced with unbelievably energy-intensive Haber-Bosch nitrogen fixation? Is cattle no longer included in effective crop rotation to promote soil health?
This video doesn't even mention the fact that since energy transfer is never a 1:1 relationship, it would be vastly more efficient to feed people using the crops we use to feed livestock, than to feed them using meat.
This video is incredibly misleading, watch the video from the channel What I've learned, he actually goes into details into his sources and proves why beef has negative impact and positive ones, disregard this bought bs!
4:29 Did anyone notice the little bug in the mic there?
I don't think this video makes any sense
Im scared
日本語字幕が欲しいです… (´･ω･`) I want Japanese subtitles
I don't really care 😁
The research that you are presenting is not objective. It's a shame even your channel is not accurate anymore. Surprised that you guys stopped mentioning Bill Gates as your funder.  But after the last video, how can you expect us to believe that you are being objective on this matter. You are literally being funded by the person who makes more money when less meat is sold.
Holy shit we all gonna die
This video has converted me to support factory-raised livestock.
I'm just gonna push the guilt to the back of my mind while I chow down on this hamburger.
This has bothred me for quite some time if plants can suck carbon out of the air why cant we build something that can and how woukd that work
doesn't stop me from eating meat
what if i walk to the farmers market?
Hopefully lab cultured meat will solve most of these issues.
Someone send this to That Vegan Teacher
800 GT of CO2 removed and 11.6 million square miles of extra land.  With 100 years of no meat and dairy.  That's the most amazing fact in this video.  Shame that you get branded as a hippie or a communist for bringing this up nowadays, but those numbers are pretty staggering.
Good video but you failed to discuss water use in food production. Admittedly, beef & other meats are still the least efficient uses, but it would have also been a good time to acknowledge the water inefficiency by almonds. Especially since almond milk is by far the most popular plant-based milk alternative.
Local also supports your community
I already don't like beef and drink goat milk so I guess I'm helping earth😂😂
So ooo. it's a good thing that i can't afford meat most of the time?
So what is the carbon footprint of eating venison?
Me, in the future, "Back in MY DAY we used to eat REAL Steaks, from REAL Cows!" "Okay Grandpa, we know" "And also they TASTED BETTER" "Yeah we know, Grandpa." "Well, this year for your birthday were going to have REAL steaks. I don't care how much they cost!"
0:03 i see cannibalism
So, the main issue is theres a lot of living ppl on earth. Just saying
So theres no Canada on the map?
It's a shame all that planet healing potential was scuppered once again, by the fossil fuel cronies at COP. I think no authority of any kind is remotely serious about climate change, no matter what promises are made. And that's not even before we get to talking about the destructive power meat can have, and I say that not even as a vegan, even though I know I should be.
There is no such thing as carbon budget
Banning beef is the right thing to do. Not everyone likes to go vegan, so leave other meat that isn't killing the planet.  Then slowly transition to plant based meat, if possible. Free the animals, from corporate.
cows don't fart they burp methane
This was really well done.
I am looking forward to days when plant based food or modern fermentation or cultured food (meat) will be main way of eating over the world. 🙂
If you are referring to cattle feedlots as factory farms the cattle sent to those only stay for about 60 days as a finisher before being harvested. In California at least you run cattle through the National and state forests on permits to graze wild lands and remove fire debris.
Good video. Please make a video about insect foods next time! They are known as pretty nutritious and low co2 emissions.
We often feed cattle the waste from mass production, waste that humans cannot eat. Seems like you didn’t touch on this.
It is evil if you are the animal being eaten.   😉
anyone else see the monkey was holding a cow, lol?
I'm happy that my 13 year old self 10 years ago decided to never eat meat again. It's wasn't easy, but i did it and today there are so many alternatives.
Please make a follow up video considering farmings impact from fertilizers, their feed being silage (waste products from crops) and take animal by product into consideration when talking about CO2/kg
lmfao beef farts killing the world
the best thing about being alive, enjoyed multiple times a day, never gets old... yeah, I guess that applies to food, too.
You're still forgetting that cows can eat things like straw and the inedible parts of food crops and that the majority of the mass of edible food crops contain mostly inedible like wheat only the head can be used for food the rest (leaves stem, roots) is usually used to feed animals as straw or hay which is never counted in emissions calculators for some reason
I'm so glad you talked about the physical land usage! I attempted to write a report on all of this a few years back, and all the issues you covered were things I wished more people considered! That said, I did learn a lot about local shipping, so thank you for this very informative video!
Beef Stonks
Unpopular opinion: Beef is overestimated! I would choose chicken over it any day
When it comes to eating beef - I personally find that beef is less than flavorful and delicious due to how processed and mass produced it has gotten. Not to be an arrogant middleclass snooty guy, but I feel like farming that focused on producing top quality beef, and thus marketing it as a delicious treat vs an every meal protein choice would be a good compromise. (Again this is all just a personal opinion)  Eating a steak that was raised by experts, coming from a cow that was fed well, treated humanely, and slaughtered correctly would be far better than saying stay-the-course or absolutely-no-beef-ever-again.
Person/bird: * casually eats immune cell *
Im curious if there has been any research done one the amount of methane humans produce from our own mouths and rear ends and whether our diet affects that. I wouldn't be surprised if people who have been vegan for years, on average, produce more methane than average humans.
I don’t know if they covered it in a video already but I hope they make video on the moon exit the earths rotation
they change it from Global Warning to Climate changes to Rapid Climate changes... jajajajjajajajaja  4:26 theres a problem in here, you arent counting the travel time inside the country before they got into the SHIP. and thats even worst because latin american regulations in CO2 are almost no existing. you transport your avocados in trucks without regular maintains, without filters and so on before they get into the ship. transport something overseas cost double that inside country. thats just how things work, avocados dont just growth in ships to be transported.  on the crop topic, this is misleading as someone that growth up in farm life, the crop you used for animal food, cant be used for humans used, thats why its used for animals, no farmer will sell they crop to animal when they can sell it to humans which will paid more money for it. thats just not how thing work.  meanwhile rapid climate changes supporter are telling you to TOP eating meat, they dont actually support any new technology to capture CO2 like Tesla SpaceX are doing making a Contest with money for the best tecnology to capture Co2 and converter into gaphene or any other carbon mineral we need. when someone tell you to stop doing it something, ask yourself why they are pushing alternative posibility beside trying to forced you TO STOP doing something you wanna do.  this  is the first video that i really dont support because its half true with misformation.
I probably won't stop eating meat until actual change starts happening. If the end is neigh then I'm going to enjoy myself before it hits.
I don’t know ask your mum
0:03 are you sure about that?  December is coming people.
In today's comment section, we have...  -"Well... it's complicated." -Sex jokes -Lab-grown meat (and the RealScience video on its current status) -Questions of Kurzgesagt's bias, scientific support, et cetera -Praise of Kurzgesaght's video quality  This has been the comment section news. We hope you enjoy your day!
What environmentalists from first world countries say about the Amazon.  "The world doesn't need more pastures, don't make the same mistake we did ." Now, what they're are REALLY saying:  "We've destroyed our forests and we're filling the air with pollution, but it's your responsibility to preserve the forests and save the world."
MEAT wort press
Kurzgesagt: go vegan, fellas
The English language is hopelessly inadequate to express even approximately how much I don't care about this subject and every preconception upon which it is based.  Ants.  Aliens.  Cosmology.  Birds.  Get on with it.
I love this channel! it always gives me something to worry about :D
The environmental impact of production animals should merely be a side note to the suffering we put them through. Imagine if slavery was abolished because it was bad for the environment.
Very early, the video refers to a "carbon budget," like I have any idea WTF that is or how it's calculated.
Great video but we should also talk about the health effects and ethics or actually lack thereof of eating meat
"We will need to eat less beef"  That's the solution.  Feed the silage (waste matter from crops) to the cattle, harvest the livestock waste products for fertilizers to grow the necessary crops. And when taking other animal by products like milk, gelatin, leather into consideration it lowers the carbon per kg of product than carbon per kg of just the meat
i love to hear that beef stonks 😂
Me eating steak while watching this 🤣🤣🤣
It's so hard to explain to corpse munchers why factory farming is the most environmentally friendly method of farming. You can solve the ethical and environmental problem of all animal farming by just becoming vegan. Double the moral superiority, easiest decision you will ever make (but make it for the animals or you WILL NOT stick to it)
Another argument not touched was that if the world stopped eating meat, they would need more food crops for humans anyhow. Which... is true, but not as true as some meat advocates are imagining lol. Especially considering methane and total land use as factors :S
Oh god with a title like that you guys are gonna get canceled I bet 😭
That plant meat that tastes exactly like real meat is gonna have to rise
Yeah, let’s uh go vegan I guess :/
Nice video though I must say it was a bit biased in the way it was written and animated, for example at 9:35 you talk about how the 3 billion hectares could remove 800 billion tonnes in 100 years yet you compare it to an annual co2 emmisions of 50 billion tonnes surely the correct way to accurately compare those things is to measure them both in the same units so 8 billion tonnes removed a year compared to 50 billion tonnes added or, 800 Billion tonnes over 100 years removed compared to a possible 5000  billion tonnes added in 100 years
I like beef
this took into account NOTHING about human diet as an evolutionary product and how we need to include our own needs for development into the equation. malnutrition has direct consequences on IQ, for example. "is meat really that bad?" how about "how much meat do we need?" ????
see, the thing is idgaf about climate change so meh
MOST PEOPLE DONT CARE ABOUT ENVIRONMENT OR ANIMAL TORTURE, THEY JUST WANT TO SATISFY TASTE BUDS.I feel the biggest solution  for this problem is to teach people how to cook tasty vegan recipes like in India, where the veg food is so tasty that even non veg ppl rarely eat meat.
vegan teacher would love this
For those saying meat is just too pleasurable to give up: why not try going vegan for a while and see if you still can't find pleasure in food? There are so many good vegan alternatives to animal products out there and you can really have a varied and satisfying diet without animal products, vegan food isn't all salads and tofu. Even if afterwards you still find you can't give up meat, maybe you'll find some new foods you like that don't contain animal products, which definitely make it easier to cut back on meat
If a debate gets emotional it's not a debate, it's an argument and no amount of facts or reasoning will solve it.  I'll still continue eating meat daily either way.
Now I want steak.
So basically… the problem is we have to many cows.. a caged unstable ecosystem.
Chicken and cows can't be sad if its engineered out of them.
I hate the youtube update because we can't see the dislike ratio Because it's being honest see the disagreement
This is a tough debate, both sides are utterly unmoovable
I don't like food or eating
I feel the biggest solution  for this problem is to teach people how to cook tasty vegan recipes like in India, where the veg food is so tasty that even non veg ppl rarely eat meat. MOST PEOPLE DONT CARE ABOUT ENVIRONMENT OR ANIMAL TORTURE, THEY JUST WANT TO SATISFY TASTE BUDS.
Dislike  Because there is still %74 of emissions that you can reduce before affected the life of individuals
Dude. tell me about vertical agriculture
No
How have I learned even more things about meat and its emissions even after 2 or 3 video about this topic!?
This may all be true. But what kind of future is being propagated here? A world where 10 billion people eat processed soy beans and algae, travel in cramped mass transit systems and live in small appartments in huge building blocks. This whole "changing of habits" will mean further reduction of the standard of living for the lower and middle class, while the very rich will keep their yachts and private jets, and will eat kobe steaks for dinner, all eco friendly of course. No thanks, there has to be a better solution.
Just got this channel in my recommended for the first time in years, and you guys are just as great as you’ve always been. Keep up the great work 👍
I think the meat argument is honestly the clearest indicator of just how fucked we are as a species. I like to be hopeful, but it just feels like such a mountain to climb. Ah well, good luck humanity, I guess. We have to go extinct eventually.
The worlds either gonna end or some insane change that will change all of civilization is gonna happen
The fact that most meat comes from holocaust conditions is enough not to eat it. Every dollar spent on animal products is a dollar spent on animal abuse but if people don't care about that then there's no way they are going to care about its impact on climate change.
So the problem is not the meat itself it's the way you raise and feed cattle on top of the insane amount of waste in the western world... I've lived many years in a rural setting, I've seen cows, pigs, lambs, chickens being fed, if not scaled into industrial production they do very little impact in the environment, if anything they do the opposite. Sheep and cows take care of the land, prevent wild fires and fertilize, the same land that can be used a few years later for agricultural. Pigs eat pretty much anything, veggies, fruits, nuts and other plants that aren't edible by humans. I've seen pigs be essentially fed on leftovers. All of these animals are very valuable to the ecosystem and when done properly they come at very little cost. The real problem is industrialization of the meat production business
This entirely leaves out the topic of hunting for your own meat.
8:00 yup, 70% less beef, grass fed only, fight me.
I have an issue with the methane thing. Plants absorb CO2. Cows eat plants and burp methane - CH4. Then the methane goes in the atmosphere and in time gets converted to CO2 + H2O. The CO2 then gets absorbed in to plants and the cycle closes. This suggests that cows don't really add to the greenhouse gas volume. They simply recycle a part of it. It's wrong to count the methane burps as emissions and there are papers that confirm it.  The real picture is of course not that simple. For instance methane does react with other chemicals and can have ozone depleting properties but in the interest of science I can't accept completely omitting the methane production and degradation cycle.
Dont forget where we humans come from, meat got us here. Instead of reducing our meat intake per person. Maybe we should consider reducing the amount of people we need to feed
Me waiting for vegans to trash this video without watching it while eating my beef popcorn
With out Meat, I don’t want to live.
Bull!!!
To me, stopping eating meat is pointless. I will not save the planet by not doing so. If I stop eating meat and it really makes a difference for the climate then humans will keep reproducing to a higher count and eventually a new problem with arrive. Then what? Water is going to be a problem. What do we do? We stop eating all these vegetables that takes too much waters to grow and only eat those that don't. Where do we draw the line here really? The no.1 problem isn't eating meat or moving with cars around. The no.1 problem is the fact that we are almost 8 billions of humans on the planet and too many of us live a modern lifestyle. If we start controlling our birthrate and reduce it to 1.5 billion then we can all live well and the rest of the planet too. Nature is going to regrow in almost all aspect: trees, marine lifeform, land lifeform, etc. This is the main problem followed closely by the fact that we are divided in competitive nations not trying to elevate each others to a equal level.
I have a question: what would be the ecological effects of lab meat? If we cut the cows out of beef would that lower the impact enough to matter?
waited for the dislikes to disapear before publishing this one eh? lmao
Why are we regulating the way carbon is burned? Rather, can't we regulate how much fossil fuels are purchased?   Regulate how much gasoline can come out of a gas pump. Regulate how much charcoal gets put in stores. Why spend all our effort regulating each individual use of fossil fuels instead of sanctioning the one industry selling the fossil fuels? Put a maximum on how much stuff comes out of the ground! Yes, some coal will be dug illegally, but in general, the supply of fuels should go down.
hey if you are working on new video ideas like this one id love to see something that compared the environmental impact of leather production vs vegan leather alternatives
MSG can save the world. Make vegetarian food taste good.
4:42 how do plants distributed locally compare? Or is it the same?
Excellent video as usual. Could you discuss the environmental impact of eating fish next? I could happily live without beef but not without seafood so just wondering if that change would reduce my carbon footprint at all...
Cool.. now I’m a go to Wendy’s brb
"Food is the best thing about being alive"  I don't care about food at all. I wish I could buy nutri-loaf at the grocery store. 🤷‍♂️
what needs to be done is to be k*ll*ng the rich landowners here from Brazil, expropriate their wealth and to restore the Amazon Rainforest, they are all a bunch of genocidal criminals anyways, no one would miss them
I just had 3 beef burgers today, couldnt be happier
Food is food XD
…gee…I can’t wait for The vegan teacher to react to this :/
how about making an artificial lung which gets co2 and output o2 for every human and house..it should be cheap & effective and mass produced which could be done in less than 10 years. it will help planet and also it may eliminate the chance of losing life because of gas leaks or similar situations.
I am a vegan as I oppose animal torture,,,, the environmental & health benefits are just icing on the cake.
plant more trees
I guess the most efficient solution would be artificial beef.
Why don't we eat the crops directly?
Another big factor is food waste which i think is the biggest problem in climate change although i might be very wrong
This is great. From the thumbnail I was expecting this to go down the whole “Grass Fed is best” route/propaganda, but thankfully it gave the honest, unbiased scientific data to show how damaging beef is & how we all must make a small sacrifice to save our children’s future. Keep up the great work. 🙏🌎🌱
I will still eat beef and enjoy it 😶
Haven't watched yet but I remember there was already a video about meat not so long ago. Something changed?
we just need a alternative for meat that feels and tastes the Same but isn't made from animals it's either something that isn't meat all aka copy or it's artificially grown meat.   im agree that meat isn't good for the environment but i also say that we shouldn't have to suffer to lower carbon emissions.  And that's what people who push veganism need to understand. Meat is part of a lot of people's lives and shouldn't be ripped away, instead of destroying what people love make alternatives.  we can save this world we have the technology. We just need to implement it
well we can force judgment day by killing fast planet
re upload?
Loved the video. I will keep doing what I've been doing my entire adult life. I will not deprive myself of any type of food. But I will eat them moderately (no more than 100ish grams of meet in a meal). I eat meat 1/2x per week and I eat fish 2/4x per week. The rest of the time I eat vegetarian/vegan food. And I think if everyone did that, food would be more sustainable.
i don´t even move. i love earth.
still eating meat, actually doubling my intake. too bad so sad.
Great segment!
What is the problem to produce and consume more pork and chicken? I personally do not like beef at all and always prefer other meat options. Plant food is nice but for me - definitely not when it is the only option.
It always boils down to the same thing. We're the ones that are going to make the sacrifices to help climate change, never the corporations nor the rich. We have to recycle while certain companies can just dump trash straight into our rivers. We have to eat bugs while the wealthy enjoy steak.  Everything sounds nice, but it has to be across the board, and it will never be across the board.
TY
wait so you count the actual CO2 being produced by burning trees to make room for farmland towards the meat side? Dont they use that land for other stuff?
Thank you for being honest. ♡
One of the best videos on this channel
I unapologetically would rather die and take the whole planet with me than stop eating meat in general and beef is specific.
I wish every fast food restaurant had a good veggie burger because they taste the same and they don’t involve animal cruelty and makes much less emissions
poor red bird just wants his meat
This video is wrong on a .ajor point.   Only 13% of cattle are grass "finished* a far larger portion is grass fed and grain finished, getting the majority of it's food from grass.
So, in summary: the government should stop subsidizing beef & lamb, and redistribute the remainder to chicken, pork, and plants
Even if everyone on the planet becomes vegan and all of our cars are “zero” emissions, we are past the point of no return.
beef is just sooooo good but it tastes better if you havent had it in a while so im cool with less cows
This doesn't seem to really engage with sources of wild-caught and hunted food. Obviously those still need proper management and harvesting quotas but humans have sustainably harvested food from those ecosystems for millennia sustainably.   If you restored all those natural spaces and the species that are native to them, you'd be having stronger local populations of animals that themselves would represent a source of food.   Between that and traditional diets that focus on smaller amounts of meat, fed with waste products that aren't edible for humans, that seems to offer a more efficient path forward than veganism.
to be fair, i don't think the songbirds in this video should be eating meat.
The message is clear: go vegan!
Yes, it's bad.
It would've been nice if you also covered crop and animal water usage since several crops gaining popularity require huge sums of water while cows on pasture at least use very little
Great video about lots of faces of food emissions. Thanks Kurzgesagt !
F skillshare
Once you appreciate the life of an ordinary animal, there is no turning back. Every Mcdonald's order is an order to slaughter another animal
There's only one reason I'm not vegan/Beefless, a single solitary person impacts the global market by nothing. 1/7billion doesn't do anything. Now if it because legislature, I would gladly switch.   I'm not attached to... well the vast majority of things emotionally. I love beef, but I can easily live without it. This needs to be a cultural and legal change, otherwise the impact of 1 person doesn't mean much and would negatively impact my life far more than the good it would do.   again, I'd gladly change to vegan or lab grown meat. But the good would have to outweigh the bad, and as it stands... climate change reversing is a pipe dream. Meaning my change of diet wouldn't be measurably impactful.
Yeah I just personally don't think my impact of growing my own meat in the form of my chickens/eggs and buying local red meat is particularly heinous Compared to other corporate sources of emissions.   I plan on starting a carbon negative beef farm in future. This has been demonstrated to be very possible with intensive pasture rotation and with the addition of feed supplements. Of course this doesn't speak to the transport of my product, but that's a problem for another business.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times everyday and never gets old"  Well, I can think of another one 😏
Such a meated topic!
Why don’t y’all make a video on animal ethics? Everything is always about “health” & “environment” but what’s always miss by these videos is the ethics. Btw, it’s not beef, it’s a cow. Weather you are eating or drinking a “mother cow” “baby cow” “grass fed cow” what should be talked about and considered also is that there is a conscious sentient being that that cow brain houses with emotions/ feelings & that’s not something that should be overlooked
I've been vegan for more than 5 years. I clicked on this video a little skeptical that the information would be truthful, because we live on a carnist biased world with a lot of misleading information. But I'm impressed that this was very on point with the reality. You guys always amaze me no matter the subject you dive in. Congratulations and thank you for the great videos.
Really important topic. Honestly might cut down on my own meat consumption. Although im unsure if I could ever go fully veg
Scientists are already developing machinery that can grow meats and other foods with the DNA of the creatures that you'd normally get the food from. Basically, let's start a charity to fund that research
*_This is the day Kurzgesagt is a full-blown propaganda ministry_*
now i wonder, is it really that bad for humans? cuz as far as i know we are omnivores and eat both meat and plants right?
You all forgot to mention water. We use disproportionately large amounts of water to grow corn and soy which are fed to cows that’s leaving entire regions of the west without water for anything else. We are burning up out here without a drop to put out fires.
It has no subtitles in Brazilian Portuguese 😔✊ Não tem legenda em português Brasileiro 😔✊
9:08 3 billion hectares is just between the area of Argentina ( 2,780,400 km2 ) and India( 3,287,263 km2)
I hope you guys make a video on the enamel rebuilding gel that is being developed I think it may change the whole dental industry.
Luckily I'm a pork and chicken type of guy.
The easiest decision anyone can make is to dedicate 30 days to be meat free. They don't even have to be consecutive. Every year I give up meat for roughly 41 days. But that's my choice. I estimate that if every American adult does this. We will not eat roughly 30 billion pounds of meat per year.
Okay, so now perhaps a video on all the food that is produced and thrown away because it isn't considered "fit for human consumption". You might be surprised just how much there is. Surprise fact, a lot of those crops fed to animals were originally grown for human consumption but was turned away.
You guys are the best really i watch even the adds without them annoying me but that might be the nice voice aswell. Keep it going love the content never knew that beef alone caused so much a mostly eat poultry anyways
cowe
I currently have over 20 pounds of venison in my freezer. Now my question is, is that meat that was shot processed and consumed all without industry farming significantly less carbon footprint inducing then say beef from the store. Side note the deer was not shot by me I simply helped process the meat hence why I was able to procure so much.
I'd like to point out an unacknowledged assumption which is that we must continue to produce food via methods of modern agriculture, which is not true.  Humans produced food for themselves mainly via permaculture for all of "prehistory" and that process did not drive anthropologic climate change.  Using a different essential logic is fundamental to making a meaningful systemic change.  Individual diets mean nothing if there is a systemic pressure to continue business as usual.  People need to not just ask if meat is an issue, but also what systems drove us to this present state of affairs.
Meat is the most nutrient dense food on the planet
Currently writing my dissertation on this topic! (I think I even used the same paper as this video as a key source lol) The more I read into the subject the more I was shocked to see just how impactful our diet is on the environment and I wondered why more isn't being done to change peoples diets. It seems like such a simple change to make for such a bit climate-positive payout. Of course, animal-free diets are not accessible to everyone and meat is a big industry tied up with politics in lots of ways but I hope more people can switch to beef-free, vegetarian, or vegan diets because it really is going to be essential if we want to make a difference in the fight against climate change. I know meat is delicious and hard to give up but if you're here watching this video and learning about this problem I urge you to try! Just one meal a week that's meat-free is an excellent start. And encourage friends and family too, it might not seem like its making a difference but a lot of research suggests that through consumer demand we can get big industries to change their practices to be more environmentally friendly : ) There are lots of animal rights issues that are concerning in animal agriculture too so it really is a win-win to stop eating meat.
So eat more pork and poultry
Now this is what I wish I heard when these vegetarians were screaming their airpipes out. There has been so many times I think to myself vegetarians are stupid, now that I understand more I see I was very arrogant :(
holy smokes i got the free thingy thank you so much!
Thanks God I eat meat.
Humans are like drunken monkeys, if left alone long enough we do whatever we want without caring about the planet. If leaders don't step up and say NO! nothing will change.
The massive environmental cost of beef (as well as the rising prices during the pandemic) is why I've mostly cut beef out of my diet. I will only have it for special occasions like my birthday. Otherwise, I'll only have pork or chicken if I want to have meat and I have a food scale for measuring out an actually appropriate portion size (4oz of meat is plenty if you're having it with a well-balanced meal with stuff like veggies and rice).
Bring back the viewable dislikes YOUTUBE, THIS IS BS.
Wow, great video. Covered all of the things I wasnt sure about and this in just ~10 minutes!
"Eating meat significantly increases your carbon footprint"  "I don't know tho, do what you want with that information!! lol"
Aliens dont have to eat, thats why they are so far
food is good
if there was option for full meal pills I would drop food instantly... It's the worst shit, you waste time, money and energy on food. My living room would so much bigger w/o kitchen, I would reduce waste to minimum because 90% of it comes from food products and save so much money.
Anyone that cant stomach eating a couple meals a week without meat is embarrassing
Jesus christ, anyone else really wants a burger after watching? i am headed out to a and w. screw this.
@8:00 The land could also be repurposed for year-round greenhouses
please put the subtitles in French 😭🙏🙏
This is going to make vegans/vegetarians very angry
Beef good
Why didn’t you use seafood. Still meat isn’t it not.
I love the calender, but I wish you would snap out of this war on carbon madness.
I think a lot of the push back you get on this subject comes down to it being just a stop gap measure that doesn't even address the root cause.
why dont we just return to monkey
Or we could just do a thanos   ........ just saying <.<
Meat eaters getting triggered in 3.2.1
"The best beef is worse than the worst plant."  So are we going to go right back to ignoring the nutritional density of those two things? Clearly beef is more nutrient dense and the only reason the first graphic and the third look so intimidating is because you showed the WORST beef in it. You showed the one but didn't use it fully.   This is directly deceitful in design because if you hunt your own game the emissions are even lower than the "best beef" and the nutritional data is still massively in favor of meat over plants.  Remember that it isnt just about what you see. Data is deceitful unless you have the entire picture. A fact can be a fact and be irrelevant on a grand scale if data is withheld.
Could you do a comparative use of farmland vs aquaponics vs hydroponics etc?
'no other body pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old' 🤔
Brazil has been called out!
Hey, would quickly like to hop into this domain and kindly mention, all creatures in your world have the capacity to feel pain. So continue to uncover the compassion you have discovered from watching this video and use it to see and understand that all life on this wonderful planet is interconnected, so not only the animals you eat and nature you destroy suffers, you do too. It’s all one! Realise this, and the solutions become clear❤️  Peace and love.
lets stop thinking of animals as resources please
"Rapid climate change"   "It's complicated" Just trust us   😂  This is why all the past climate predictions have been completely wrong since the 1970s..  You are an establishment drone
If people choose to not eat meat, that's their choice I will still keep eating it because I like it And no, I don't buy fast food
"Is Meat Really that Bad" Well we are meat so...
The worst part of Brazil's destructive Soy and Beef business its that they not only deforest most of their protected land ilegally to make land, they do the same on neighbor countries, and also start massive wildfires to clean terrain wich ends reaching actual forests, leaving nothing but smoke in the air to breathe for weeks.
I enjoy meat, but honestly... if I could just take one pill a day that would make it so I never had to eat, I'd take it.
I will eat real meat, don't like it.... Cry Plus if your actually do research Climate change will happen NO MATTER WHAT WE DO. Changing has been a thing since the the creation of earth. Plus if your look this up, and I hope you do. We are still in a Ice age technically. The we are on a decline of glacier. This decline started over 11000 years ago. So it seems like ice has been part of the Earth forever in which is totally not the case there's point of time of Earth's history where there was no ice at all. Sooner or later climate will change are humans speeding up the process? Certainly, should we slow down our impact? Yes no question about it. But there's certain things that in my opinion we shouldn't stress over. One of those things is meat. No matter how much we tried to stop climate change it will not happen, we will lose shorelines and we will lose ice caps, some places will have droughts others will become rainforests, Earth will always be changing. For another example the desert in Egypt and Syria was actually once a rainforest. But climate changed.....
“You will eat bugs and you will enjoy it” not an elitist class probably..
IMA JUST GO HUNT FOR MY MEAT THEN.
Here's a thought: What if humans didn't have to consume food to survive? How would that change the world?
Local, organic, grass-fed meat is perfectly healthy for you in moderation.
Personally, i think I'm addition to trying to live self sufficiently and transitioning to renewables, we need to create and perfect carbon capture technology. I think that emissions are an unfortunate truth that we can never completely diminish without culling everyone. Better that we learn to fix it ourselves
Yeah... no. No. I'mma keep eating meat.
Just spitting facts, not telling you how to think. Gives you the information to make an informed decision for yourself.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old."  I beg to differ.
Do a video on food waste, like when they dump whole crops.
800b per 100 years and 50 per year 50 x 100 = 5000. 5000 - 800 = 4200 We are still 4200b tonnes short
I was vegetarian for a few years and it actually was really easy. I think everyone could do it!
They’re smart to upload this after the dislike button has been privatized lol
Hä das is doch n reupload?
If we go vegan, we can take out 800 billion tons of CO2 in 100 years, if all goes well w land use and tree growth, and we emit 50 billion tons of CO2 per year at the moment. So, in 100 years we would have generated 5 trillion or 5000 billion CO2. 5000 vs 800 on the scale 100 years. This video is so on the big number vs small number thing, it's actually not very helpful with presenting any informative comparison.  I mean if u r on these hypotheticals, why not ask the question how reducing world population would effect these numbers?
Artificially growing meat when
what about lab grown foods?
8:55 These numbers are wrong. You’re considering soybean meal as equal as soy oil (meant for humans) which is the waste of soy oil extracted from soy and not appropriated for human consumption. That means it is actually, as for the greenland usage example, more productive to use this soy waste to feed animals rather than just recycling it.
But don't cattle consume crop waste products we don't eat ourselves? Like corn husks?
How do I report a mistake/misleading information in the video?
It's important to see animals as living beings, who wants to live and have their own life. We should respect all animals!
Plant based burgers, mince (ground beef) and sausages are now so good that I'm happy to eat them instead. Beef is only for special occasions now.
Watching this as i enjoy my tri-tip i just finished making lol..
Guys, let's just eliminate all cows from existence and eat only chicken, it's as good IF NOT better than meat in my opinion ;)
8:17 Kurzgesagt: Beef Stonks Every memer:  :|    :)))
in short we are doomed
I literally don’t give a fuck about the “climate” I have massive fucking biceps
Amazing video as always! I do have one gripe though. I don’t understand why you placed the emission savings per century next to our emission output per year as if to show how much larger it is. As far as I know everything else was great. Thank you so much for helping us understand several of the different aspects of the topic!
99k likes 3.1k dislikes right now guys
What if we drastically decrease human population?
Here's the thing. If you want to cut down on your carbon footprint, you don't necessarily have to go vegetarian or vegan. You just have to take a bit more care with what you eat. Reducing your weekly meat intake is not nearly as hard as obliterating it! And choosing products with less packaging or finding ways to reuse instead of throw away might not do all that much in the grand scheme of things, but they're still steps in the right direction. Also recycling, obviously.
How they fail to put things in perspective, that the "evil" "climate destroying" animals eat leftover crops which humans cannot digest. Yet they give us dairy products, which humans are so dependant on, and meat. There is no plant substitute for that.
I can't even see the dislikes to know if this was controversial or not
You do realise that only the plant parts that are inedible to humans get fed to livestock? We only eat the seeds off of corn and wheat and only the beans off of soy plants. The stalks and leaves are given to the livestock because they can eat the hard to digest plant matter like grass.
We need less people
Go Vegan! ... or at least go veggie! ......... or at least, at least eat less than 300g of meat per week.
Imagine the Vegan teacher reacting to this lol
Great video!
I love meat. So tasty
Okay, but what about the ethical reasons? Eating animals means a lot of animal suffering
bring back dislike count
The problem with vegan burgers us that they are massively processed and quite nutritionally deficient. Also plenty of people get IBS from  vegan diets so the majority can only cut down on meat and not cut it out completely.
"Lets stick with beef because its an outlier"   uh you dont use outliers in experiments, you exclude them, the vegan narrative is real, foh
I'm a huge fan of kurzgesagt! But I feel they missed some key points that biased this video. 1. Methane cycle: indeed methane is bad for climate change but it's in a different category than Co2. Methane falls from the sky, absorbed by the ground, used by plants then is released again by animal burps or just by dying and rotting. Back it goes in the sky. Unlike burning of fossil fuels, cows aren't not "adding" methane. Less cows may not mean less methane because of the cycle.  2. Regenerative farming: a type of farming that has shown it can be carbon negative and rejuvenate dead land where nothing was growing. I strongly checking out the work of Diana Roger's and Dr. Rob wolf and the sacred cow website.  These don't answer the consumption need but the video showed meat is by far the most nutrient dense food you can eat gram for gran. Reducing meat and dairy in developing countries for example has shown to be a disaster on development of children because they don't have access to the abundance of other food and supplements needed to replace what meat and dairy have. Being a vegetarian, and especially vegan, is a privalage the majority of the world doesn't have.  Just some thoughts from a girl trying to be objective
vegans fu......off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why don't we just replace cars with boats!
BEEF STONKS!!
Fossil fuel machines/factories are way worse greenhouse gas emitters than food.
nuke america  problame shovled :3
No matter how you look at it, it's people, not cows, who are responsible for green house gas emissions. So the only way to reduce the emissions and stop climate change is to reduce the number of people on the planet. Bill?
regardless of the environmental impacts, a lot of people (vegans) believe eating meat is unethical because it is unnecessary and causes suffering to others
Kurzgesagt is a vegan so he is a little bit biased.
The way I see it:  Free range cows  Moral, polluting  Factory cows  Immoral efficient
As a mom who watches these, you all should make animal toys cause they would be popular with kids for sure. Like the little birds could be toys. So cute.
This is sadly one sided and doesn't even discuss regenerative agriculture and grass feed, pasture raised beef!
Can u make a video on crypto currencys
“Hey kids, I’m sorry the planet is fucked but don’t worry because I had really tasty steaks back in the day :)”
You forgot to mention how certain parts of the crop are not eaten or edible by humans, and can be used for feed, but apart from that good video.
Don't eat animals - so easy... No kid wants to eat animals, because they don't want to hurt animals (like almost everyone)
wat bout hemp it will save the universe
you can raise animals in unfarmable land, also animals eat alot of farm waste like corn stalks and other things we dont eat.  fake meat takes alot of good farmland and expending farmland ads to global warming. also fake meet per foot takes alot of land all the oils take alot of footage to grow and the fill and the beets for color and then all the work to take all those veggies to make fake meat. am i seeing this wrong? like how many peanuts ect does it take to get the fat for the fake meat. this vid felt like it had an adgenda. also most feed crops are not fit for humans like dent corn but is efficient to produve anamal feed. co2 from shipping would be more effective make a safer thorium reactor. or turn the thawing marshlands into something like farmland to slow or stop the meathan there more gasses from thawing perma frost than from animals.
Just eat fish bro
In a Nutshell We could leave meat however the reality is it's not that easy let's look for more solutions to the climate problem.
Imagine if that vegan teacher watched this
I would have really appreciated it if you mentioned the health and nutrient benefits of meats compared to other products. From what I've learned, Beef has most of the essential Vitamins our body needs along with other micro benefits. While other foods like Tofu are actually counter productive because of the Soy in it, lowering our natural testosterone due to the estragon found in soy products. Many health experts and enthusiasts would likely then recommend Chicken, which I could get behind if the nutritional benefit, (not just the protein to calorie ration), of Beef wasn't significant enough to warrant its mass production. Especially given that according to your research, Cows that are less nutrient dense and healthy for you, (caged, grain fed), are better for the environment than the best, (pasture-raised, grass-raised), then having Cows that are worth eating, might not be worth the cost to the planet.  Though, y'all briefly mentioned the concept of eating less beef, and thus beef production taking a hit. But, as far as I understand it, that's already a good thing. While Beef is greatly beneficial for your health, ideally you should only be eating it about 3 times a week. Thus, if people slowed their habit of eating Beef every day to something like only on the weekends, or every other day, than that would inherently be lowering the demand for Beef, thus halting the need to produce more land for said cows and ideally sticking with the land we already have. A lot of product goes to waste every day, especially Beef, so, if we are able to recognize the value of Beef, while limiting our consumption, then we could in theory give Beef farmers a better idea of how much product we actually need, which in turn would decrease cow production to the point of Beef being a specialty item that you only are available to get every once in a while, like truffles but not as extreme.  These are serious questions that I would love to have a conversation on, ideally with sources of research I can look at to disprove or amplify any of the points I have made. Thank you for your time, and let's make this planet a better place, together.
While this is a great look at meat production and it's effect on the environment, I always find these kinds of videos in very bad faith when not out into context with other areas of carbon emissions. While moving away from beef all together can absolutely have a huge impact on the environment, there are two problems with it. First, this would be a massive undertaking both economically and culturally. There would be massive pushback from lobbyists and normal folk alike. Second, and most importantly, it perpetuates the notion that climate change is an induvial, moral crisis instead of the systemic capitalist problem it really is. Saying "you need to eat less beef to save the planet" is simple a great marketing tactic that shifts the conversation onto consumers, when we really need to be talking about both our consumer practices and (much more importantly) the contributions corporations or organizations make towards pollution. A few piece of legislation that heavily regulate industrial pollution would have as much, if not more, of an effect on climate change than getting everyone to stop eating beef. Of course this has it's own massive problems, but we already have a massive movement of people who are concerned about climate change, we just need to shift our focus from consumer choices to government and corporate entities to make a real impact. At the end of the day, it's very profitable for large corporate polluters if we are arguing with each other over our own consumption choices, instead of focusing on them, the much larger problem.
If you want to become a vegan after watching this kinds of videos, please consult first a nutriologist. I stopped eating meat just to save as much money as possible and I got a tachycardia for lack of vitamin B12 and it was really bad. Meat is important for you and you need to eat it. I need to eat at least 700g of meat at week to avoid to get sick.
Really fair investigation and factual information, Kurzgesagt! 😯👏🏻  You've been one of the most unbiased, reliable, objective, and a practical infotainment channel with any topic! I trust Kurzgesagt 93-99% 🥲👏🏻  Vegan is truth, truth is vegan! 🌱 A progressive journey towards veganism is all i can ask and hope for from our humanity.. spread love and peace for all sentient beings and get happiness for both self and others! What else we need in life 😀✌🏻
Is this different to the meat is bad for you vid?
2:58 meeting the protein requirements eating potatoes would mean you eat too many calories, and then diabetes and obesity kick in. Yes it is "complicated", and this graph is misleading. A healthy balanced diet cannot be achived by looking at CO2 emmisions. Eliminate the externalities (subsidies) and let the market solve the problem. It is also not honest to make graphs about CO2 kilograms, CO2kilograms equivalent, later talk about methane... and 5:00 even if methane causes warming, it is not *agricultural methane* that created most of that 23-40% warming.
Oil barons have left the chat
Too many humans. We should put a max cap on the planet just like how we do that on elevators :D
A lot of the grain used for animal feed is sub-standard; failed malting barley due to nitrogen level or germination issues, or milling wheat due to low protein/hagberg.  Essentially this is recycling an otherwise waste product
So glad I ordered McDonalds before watching this so I could enjoy a burger with the cartoon birds, instead of watching them destroy the planet without me. :D
Humans are so selfish, that they'd completely eliminate and torture animals to keep their planet burning longer.
Meat is often riddled with tumours and puss filled abscess that butchers have to drain. It also causes cancer and heart diseases. Not to mention the drugs and chemicals the animals are pumped with.
The cows farting bit seems like a red herring likely supported by the fossil fuel industry. If the number of ruminants on earth is not increasing, which seems unlikely due to the mass extinction humanity is causing, then ruminants can't be responsible for the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to the methane they produce disappearing at the same rate that it is generated.  Surely fossil fuel use and deforestation/burning are the real culprits here, not farting animals?
I love food!
Pfft we will never stop eating cows lol we'll just have to figure out a solution even if we have to build giant warehouse size Truman show type buildings and have all the cows roaming around in there and collecting all the harmful gasses via the air filtration system and have simulated sky and sun rays etc. That way no methane and whatever else goes into the atmosphere also no worrying about predatory animals and you'll probably have a more significantly reduced chance of any infections transmitted through bugs etc. And just let the cows graze the grass and shit that was planted in the warehouse (cause you know you'd place a shit ton of dirt on the floor enough to put Grass above and let the roots have plenty of room and shit) as well as the proper safe bugs and microbes to eat the dead roots and shit so it all self cleans itself naturally AND not to mention since you're essentially building a whole ecosystem you can literally build it anywhere in the world any dessert or frozen tundra etc. So we can just move them to more strategic locations which I'm sure is probably not ideal for such a massive large industrial scale and probably too expensive for local farmers but for the sake of the planet and atmosphere and indefinite continuation of the human species we would absolutely end up needing to do something similar to that I mean a local farm that's doing well could build a whole ass massive warehouse fill it with the vegetation and shit and just farm his animals and have plenty of room left over to grow produce through hydroponics and if they really manage all the space and everything well they could probably do a whole ass aquaponics thing built into the warehouse too so not only would they be farming cattle and whatever tf else but they'd also be farming produce and fresh local fish which if all done right could probably really pay off in the long run
HOW MUCH DOES HUMAN PRODUCE? MAYBE WE OUGHTA START CUTTING BACK ON HUMAN?
Meat should not be eaten primarily because the meat industry is appalling. Animals are as sentient as humans, of you would not eat your neighbours then you should also not eat any other animals
Can we get a video on fish. I’d like to see whether or not it could function as a kind of solution to parts of this problem
Planet isnt getting any bigger but the population is, at some point eventually the controversial side of the equation cant be ignored any longer.
I think the way forward is not only restricting our diet but being smart about where our food comes from. Petri dish meat, hydroponics, genetic modification, green/nuclear energy...the way forward is already here and its been here for a rather long time. But what I find disappointing is that most people are stupid. And when most people are stupid the people in power that want to keep power need to keep the stupid people happy. So there is no change
Has this channel turned into another propaganda machine?
Good job with an honest take on the issue. Even cop26 left out the huge issue with food
In conclusion,go to KFC
If its bad then how did some native american tribes survive mostly on Bison?
CARBON CAPTURE TECHNOLOGY WOULD LIKE A WORD PLEASE.
could we not just farm animals in the forests or jungles that we need? I remember seeing a short doco of a cow or bison farmer who uses local forest vegetation to feed their livestock, they produce less methane and their waste helps the plants grow, and they just cycle the cattle into different areas of forest or pasture as to not overwork said areas of land... thoughts?   I just feel like its much easier an realistic to change the systems that cause this than convince everyone not to eat a specific thing weve been eating since the beginning of humanity (and thus contributes a lot of important cultures and such). I agree we should be eating WAY less but one problem that will cause is if we produce less say, beef, then the price of beef will skyrocket meaning only rich people can use it and poor people get left with nothing. That is a problem of capitalism itself tho which i believe is one of the main hurdles we need to dismantle before being able to make any real progress...
No. We literally need protein to survive.
Drinking game: watch the first two minutes of a Kurzgesagt video. When you hear "Well, it's complicated", take a shot and begin your next video. Can you do it for all?
I'm sorry but myself and many others will never become vegetarian or vegan, regardless of ecological science.
It was irresponsible to cover this topic without mentioning lab grown meat. You should be ashamed of yourselves.
I like the video is divided by Polish history
Beef Stonks     *Invest*
I honestly wish I never had to eat or go to the bathroom it's fucking annoying.
No, not really. That horrible manufactured stiff is for sure but actual high quality, normal meat as we were supposed to eat thousands of years ago to the not so distant past before industrialisation of it was pretty ok 🤙
"Buying locally does not impact on climate emissions" "Food reared on areas of burned rainforest is the worst for emissions"  Therefore if you don't live near a jungle- *buy local*
If anybody is thinking to start eating vegetarian food, I'll highly suggest our Indian food as it has a variety of vegetarian and vegan foods (~85% of all Indian food).
The 1st sentence: SEX.  But NO to your question. WE ARE CARNIVOURS. I HAVE SIGNIFICALLY INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF MEAT I EAT WEEKLY. GOTTA LOVE MEAT.
I choose to eat chicken, beef, pork and picked fish such as tilapia so I do not need to eat other animals because it will only cause harm to those and might go extinct which is still happening. Its easier to breed the animals I choose than other animals that people eat.
Some videos are sad when you find out the truth this might be one of the
Basically, reduce the demand for beef by advertising a better alternative so that more non-pasture herds can be removed and beef can move to more of a delicacy than a staple.
My bad I'll start eating bugs and dry grass.
isn't this an old video?
Also, torturing and murdering sentient beings is morally and ethically wrong.
The problem's further compounded by subsidies keeping the livestock industry afloat, in the U.S. at least.
I love how none of this matters cause the oligarchs controlling the world give 0 fucks
*Disslike*
This is a waste of time because the climate change will ensure 90% of the human race will be exterminated anyway and then the process will start again
8:14 Beef Stonks
The more I think about it, Thanos was pretty spot on in that halving the population was the best way to save resources.
Me who eats chicken and rice: pathetic
Meat is all bad and shit but god damn a nice ribeye steak after a hard day of work is so satisfying
Hey, great video! Say, I was wondering, can we go take a look at cultured meat or cheese? Possibly re-visit GMOs? Just wondering.
6:54  It would be out of touch, but this doesn't mean anything. It doesn't change the fact that we don't need meat. And even less so in the fucking absurd quantities that are typical today... I'm vegan. I don't demonise cows, I don't even demonise humans. I just point out that the food they eat emits more than needs to be. And is hih ghly unethical. I don't say moral, and it's not "evil". And certainly it's also not "ethical", because we just don't need to kill 50 billion+ animals per year... Why is that number not mentioned. Veganism is ethically motivated and thoughts like this date back to early medieval Islam.  And fuck that: "meat is one of the most delicious foods"...!?! You're just a bad cook if you can't fucking cook PLANTS.
Thank you <3
I hope you guys know, we appreciate the small changes in the intro every video! Had to clarify just to be sure :D
Lab-grown beef is infinitely better but some of you aren’t ready to hear that.
We are fucked tbh
Just saying, I realize a lot of people here may be just say “ well I can’t stop eating meat/beef” or whatever the situation is; however, even if you just cut your beef consumption it’s a big step to the reduction, don’t need to go cold Turkey but just lower your beef/meat in take.
lol nice government propaganda
to summarize, we're fucked :((
Maybe just put gut microbes in all the cows to break down the methane
less food production is the key. how much food is unused every day.....?
As someone who recently began working for a local butcher, whose primary farm is 3 miles away from their main shop, this is very insightful. Of course, all Kurzgesagt Video's are insightful
Biggest climate change factor is a over populated earth tbh. Less people would be ideal. Sounds extreme but
This channel just keeps getting worse, yeah keep pushing the global agenda of the elites... You know they will have enough money to keep eating meat after it gets banned
I will not stop eating meat, i just love meat in my mouth
"It is up to you what you do with this information."   *Turns on grill*
I am rn eating a sandwich with 3 different types of meat sorry but I can't stop
This vid has no dislikes, wow
This title is misleading because it only addresses one aspect of meat’s negative impact: emissions for sustainability   You have to combine it will the other relevant arguments: Health and ethics.
The fucking answer is yes. Its worse than you could possibly imagine.
You also shouldn't feel like you have to cut out all meat from your diet. If you want to only cut out beef but keep chicken and pork that's totally okay! Also, try vegetarian Indian food, it's really good and might make going vegan/vegetarian easier.
As dislike counter is hiden i just will be vocal about i hit that button.
"beef makes most klimateBS" well tough luck i love burgers, ill burn the world down before i stop eating bacon burger, and im fine with you`r contry dying for my burgers. oh and btw, Vegan is an ancient word that means village idiot. the guy who was unable to hunt or fish so he had to relly on berries
4:49 Does that mean the emissions per calorie of beef takes into account calories from the dairy market?
that little jingle around the 2-minute mark sounds a lot like Eminem's "B**** Imma kill you". Was this just a coincidence, or...?
At a chemist, I looked up this information years ago. Methane consists of 0.00017% of atmospheric gases. Yes, it is more potent of a greenhouse gas, but the concentration is far too low to have a significant effect, even at 10 times the concentration. This is not about climate change, its about veganism and animal cruelty activism, climate change is the Trojan horse that is widely accepted and socially more effective than veganism. Meat was responsible for humans larger brain size, and veganism is responsible for humans inflated self righteousness.
I would really like to hear more about the consumption of fish over land animals like cows/pigs/chickens for climate change because it really wasn't touched on in this video.
My "Save the Earth" plan is basically "The world is going downhill and humans will destroy each other anyway, so it doesn't matter".
I love food
Daring today aren't we?
we don't need to stop, just need to eat a considerably smaller amount of meat
That vegan teacher: YES IT IS THAT BAD
I will eat as much beef as I want
In summary: PLEASE limit your use of animal products, if possible, but especially beef.
9:46 Anyone else see that T Cell at the bottom left.
Do one about eating insects :)
Sadly, I Don't think Humanity has a chance, our leaders are too power/money hungry, government officials don't care about us, only them. This will inevitably cause the downfall of Humanity.
The bottom line is that you MUST NOT criticize the mode of production and how transportation and energy is responsible for most of emitions. You MUST stop eating meat (in general) and start consuming veg(etari)an food. You can change the world, consumer!
Reupload???
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old." Not in November no.
As each day progress, my reasons to be a  vegan is exponentially rising.
ate chicken breast while watching this.
He wasn’t lying.. this was complicated..
Quick answer-*no*
Quando seu canal favorito, fala sobre seu país kakskslsl
some self acclaimed vegans love beef and shun people for eating chicken. i never eat beef lol. so what i got was eating chicken isn't as bad as eating beef and lamb?
Animals eats parts of plants which we don't use too. Animal  protein is better than protein from plants. Animal meat  is essential for rigth development of childrens. I agree that problem is complicated, but your intrepretions is one sided.
If i would get a dollar for everytime he said “well, its complicated” i’d be a millionair
Waited a month and I get know the thing I already know.   Meat - tasty and Bad. Veggies - not much tasty but good.  @kurzgesagt please do a video about universe stuff.
At 7:38 when you say 65% of beef grazing grassland cannot be converted to cropland - what is this based off? Do you have to limit the meaning of the word 'crop' to only mean foods that can be harvested with machines?  (I did try searching for 'Moffat et al' and a few relevant keywords but couldn't find the study you've used)  The reason I ask, is because I live on land that is supposed to be unusable as cropland so generally gets used for sheep, but I've found that I can quite easily grow nuts, berries and other fruit on the land, just not annual crops that require a plough or a combine. The terrain means I have to collect the harvest by hand, but the money I spend on labourers is the money I save from not buying and running a tractor/combine.  I find a lot of agricultural research makes assumptions about farming methods, when these vary wildly from farmer to farmer. In much the same way that agricultural college often teach you to take on 30 years of debt as your very first move in farming, when other routes can be far more desirable... but I digress.
beef stonks 😂
I really would like to share a dubbed version of the videos of this channel. It gives so much information for the world. Brazil needs it.
One consideration not included in the video is the role cattle play in preserving grassland ecosystems. Globally, native temperate grasslands are one of the most endangered ecosystems in the entire world and they need a large grazing herbivore to provide essential services. Cattle now mimic the historic role of bison on the rapidly disappearing Great Northern Plains. Removing that grazing pressure leads to dormant plants, loss of habitat for all sorts of species (like grassland birds that need varying heights of vegetation to nest in) and decreasing soil quality. Watch the short documentary, Guardians of the Grasslands, on our channel to learn more.
Can you please make a video about something other than climate change for once
this video talks about the ecological impact of production but doesnt mention that we wildly over produce more than we need. Posing this as a "were fucked either way you cut it" is severely unnuanced.  Great video regardless and is very educational on how capitalism is fucking us if you look a little past what they present at face
Why look at emissions that pertain to food. It's FOOD!! Why not cut down on steel, concrete or damn plastic production? Also, cows should graze and roam, whether you milk or eat them afterwards or not. They're COWS! Same goes for chickens.
sick of this channel
ok I was following along until the soy stat. because I am a bit of a factoid goblin I know around 70% of a soy crop can not be used for human consumption and as such is recycled into animal feed. are the people you are using for the stats using the parts of the crop humans can't eat as part of the total yield if so that is incredibly dishonest, at least on their part.
What? chickens only living on grain from humans... wtf that is sooo wrong i cant even laugh. If you have cows, you get chickens. they eat bugs, they kick the cow shit around so its not sitting in piles, they eat grass and other green plants. they do eat grain yes but its a small part of their diet. Now sure if they are factory chicken places that is true but any small/medium sized farm does not do that.
The ecological argument for veganism is one of the main things that convinced me. Though I have since learned that I don’t care that much about meat or eggs or dairy food. My goal to convince others is just to regularly make vegan food for them and hope some of them find some recipes worth adding to things they eat sometimes. Do that enough and meat consumption naturally goes down (I hope).
good thing i mostly eat chicken anyway lol.
After watching that how to make a kurzgesagt video I wanna know, when did you guys start working on this video?
Maybe I'm missing something but OK.  The video claims beef has an emission of 71kg of CO2 per 1kg of beef. Later it claims beef transportation is responsible for 0,5% to 2% of emissions. Yet several seconds later it claims transporting 1KG of beef emits 18kg co2 transport?
What about MURDER of animals though...shouldn't that be enough in itself?...
I honestly don't think I would reduce carbon dioxide emission if I stopped eating meat.
Grass fed pastures suck down 10 times more CO2 per area of land than forest do. Better yet the grass primary captures the Carbon in the form of abandoned roots which builds soil.
Video: meat bad  Me: mmmmmmmmm meat
as an individual I can't do anything to have a big enough impact,so I am not going to make my life harder just for something that I can't do anything about
Great unbiased video on the topic :) I love kurzgesagt. I will still eat meat but it might make me pick up a chicken burger over beef more often
And you don't have to be a lifestyle vegan to eat less animal based food!!! Some change is better than no change! Very good info on the transport emissions/local food thing.
And where there were millions of buffalo, elk, deer, zebra, elephants, etc, etc on this earth before humans decimated their populations, we had a much better climate.  Because they are actually part of nature, and so are the emissions from animals.  The absence of natural forests is another matter entirely.  JMO
This may be an stupid question but how exactly is the carbon amount in the life cycle calculation actually calculated?  The reason is aside from transportation of feed and animal product wouldn't any carbon livestock have come from the environment?  They are eating plants which are trapping Carbon and then the carbon is released again forming a cycle.  So wouldn't this make all animals carbon neutral?  That would mean all of this carbon being added is from how we manage the animals which is a different discussion on better techniques and cleaner energies being used.  From that perspective the villifying of meat is a red hearing to the other more complex issues. Again feel free to correct me with actual details on how the life cycle calculation works, because my poor brain and common sense says something isn't quite right here.
I'll never be vegan, no matter what
B E E F S T O N K S
Segue o líder no desmatamento de florestas por motivos idiotas 😎
with the logic of the title and thumbnail then the cows loves to eat itself  now it dont
I ordered the book about the immune system that they made and I'm super excited to read it
I don't really get the argument of shipping being efficient. The food you produce in other countries has to get to the harbor in the first place and then after the ship has arrived you have to transport it again. Basically you neglected transportation on land twice and only compared pure shipping with single transportation of meat to the store; which is not the full story at all.- Or am I missing something?
Systemic change will be necessary. Meanwhile, we can do our part by researching our options.
Wow
Hmm, but what would happen if most humans would turn to a vegetarian/vegan diet? I mean, such a large numer of people only eating vegetables and fruit would have its impact, yes? I mean, you have to eat more of that stuff if your job is physically demanding too. We all can't be soy boys drinking soy latte in a Starbucks somewhere, typing away on our laptops how cool it would be if every one was vegan like him.
Don’t show this at COP23 👀
comparing emission reduction over 100 years vs our emissions in 1 year side-by-side like in 9:33 is misleading. The lower bar would be much larger if it were scaled to a similar time scale, accounting for some nonlinearity in the growth of CO2 emitted.
Well, it's complicated.
Oh that vegan teachers going to love this
Nobody feeds crops to cows. We feed crop WASTE to cows. Parts of crops that CAN'T be eaten.
there were so many elements of this question that were completely omitted and i'm very disappointed in this channel for not being comprehensive enough to justify their obviously motivated reasoning
Still eating meat
Food is great, and you only get one life so we can choose what we want to eat. Vegans can eat their food with less choice of tasty things, and that’s fine. We don’t go around telling them to eat meat like they shove down our throats that we should be vegan. Other than food, most non vegans do a lot for the climate and vegans belittling us only annoys us and makes us want to do less. Just like the annoying Extinction Rebellion group who are annoying the people they’re trying to attract (people who care about the planet and climate).
I really like Immune book, it was worth it and it's one of the best books I ever read, keep it up!
vegans are disgusting
Is there any research on the quantity of meat that is wasted/thrown away because not sold in time or w/e ? i would be curious to know if optimizing meat distribution/selling could actually help produce in more realistic quantity (less production for less waste) and therefore help the overall problem.
Watching this while eating my burger has made me feel like a bad person.  Guess I could try veggie burgers again.  Seriously I need lab-grown burgers with a negative carbon footprint like yesterday.
How much of the cereal plants is not suited for human consumption is then fed to cows? Also LCA calculations per nutritional value for well Developed process seems to be more in favor of beef than veggetable food.

this video is EXACTLY what i needed nowadays AAHHH THANK U KURZGESAGT ILY
Great way of being called out Brazil.
beef stonks you added a meme
In a nutshell, humans will die to climate change because we cannot and will not stop eating meat. Time to enjoy it while it lasts I guess
Beef is the best
4:08 Now we have the actual impact of transport and packaging on food emissions, and I didn't think it added up to very much but how is the rest actually calculated ? Because presumable this is caused by the organisms them self that will extract at its carbon from the atmosphere. This make it a short carbon cycle just like biofuels. how is this taken into account in the calculation. You also talk about our carbon budget which make sense for fossil fuels since they are a net positive on the carbon cycle (atleast for a few million years), but the food part of food is net neutral so why do we still have a carbon budget for them?
I never liked beef anyways
And not even talking about the impact meat has in the human body…
It's actually pretty easy to eat less beef. All you do is just stop buying it, and maybe have a cheat day every month or so. This is how it has to be.
So what would we do with all the cows?  I mean if we got rid of them kill them all and not use them?  Letting them all free and go would still have its issues.  The issue is all those who consume so much.  If we were more efficient with food the waste would carbon emissions would drastically go down and landfills wouldn't release all the garbage waste either.  Pigs can eat the food waste to a degree but that would involve local farmers.  We are huge creators of waste.  I think we need to learn how not to always flip one way or the other and find balance to survive
What about lab-made beef?
it's like in a pun. Animal rights activist and Eco-activist arguing: A: How could you buy this fur coat? You should've bought the one made from artificial fur! E: What are you saying? Can you imagine how long will it take to decompose?!
Hunt for wild game in your area. Stock up your freezer with elk meat in North America!
For context, 71kg of CO2 is equivalent of driving a car 500-600 km, at 120-132 CO2g/km. That means a typical burger with a 100g patty will set you back 7.1 CO2 kg, equaling to 50-60 km drive. An average commute distance in US is 16 miles, equalling to 25 km.  Add it all up and we now get that having a single burger is as destructive to the environment to as a car commute. Or, if you commute by transit, a single burger will negate all positive effects from transit commuting. 🤗
Yeah no thanks.
Assuming we phased out the majority of cattle ranching for dairy and meat in favor of lab designed cultured beef replacements, I'm curious what the comparitive emissions of _that_ process will be, or if they can be contained on the factory floor for filtering before exchanging gases into the wild
I will stick to meat and veggies till I die, and I know it's, egoistic way of thinking, but hey why shouldn't I use life that I was gifted with, on doing things that are enjoyable. After all, all that thrives the world are money and the greed of those that are on the top, hypocrites that  claim that they will do anything to fight with the climate change, in reality its a cheap marketing trick silent lie.
It’s very simple for all western countries go vegan. Anyone who can go vegan should. Murdering animals for a moment of taste there entire life is worth more then a few minutes of taste for you. Go vegan
ok thats the cons for meat and what about vegetables?  i recommend aquaponics then takes up less space
it reminded me , last time i cooked chicken i was watching your video.
Uh oh they're trying to change our consumption of meat behavior, soon this channel is going to convince to eat bugs instead.
Sees a helper T-cell at the end on a plate....
I WANT to see a vegan react
STONKS
F o o d
Your CO2 emissions completely ignores all of the soil repair cattle does and all the CO2 grass sucks down when grazed.
No
Esse canal recebeu o selo comunista pelo bolsonaro
As a Vegan hearing about people talk about only wanting to stop eating meat to help the environment is very upsetting. They're sentient beings, pigs are more intelligent than dogs. They're the fourth most intelligent animal. Yes being Vegan causes crop deaths, but it's far less than if I eat meat as well and the crop deaths they contribute too themselves. You wouldn't eat a dog.
Food is the best No doubts
Great video! I'd love to see a companion piece about the crisis of biodiversity loss and how beef and other meats contribute to that.
is there not already enough farmland to feed everyone? can somebody explain why we’re still cutting down forests to create more space for food? is it because the population of the earth is still growing? or is the old farmland no longer any good?
4:59 Okay, so the answer is Bovine Genocide? I mean, the cow just existing is causing the problem, but the cow has existed for Millennia. Even if we do cut down on beef production, eliminating the cow shouldn't be the answer.
Beef stonks
I will do absolutely nothing with this information
Well lets be realistic we are 8 billion people and 6 billion want to live like the other 2 billion, what do you want to do about it, and they don't care for the planet but for them selves. Every one who is in a bad place cares for them selves first and foremost, we would be acting the same. Its a symptom out our over boarding leak of imminent problems that we can spare a thought about the planet ant the not so imminent future. And you know what? It does not mater we don't have enough impact to lower global emissions enough. Or what do you want to do? Wage war against the 3rd world, bomb their coal plants for the sake of the planet?! I see it simple CO2 emissions are here to stay until we eider go full in on nuclear or invent sustainable fusion, period. And my personal conclusion is I don't waste my thoughts on the climate, the only thing I could do is to damage my standard of living for nothing.
<3 I am going Vegan
Just perfect the matrix already and we will happily enter a box and consume nutrigel only :D
Better question is will it make a difference to stop eating meat (before people reply with statistics please take into account that a meatless diet is not feasible for the majority of the world)
I'm curious how Fish play into all of this. Is it on the same level as like Poultry or is it up there with Lamb and Beef for Carbon Emissions?
This video was.. uncharacteristically dishonest for Kurzgesagt. You guys missed a lot of important details, and that graph at the end was actively misleading. For the whole shipping vs locally sourcing argument, sure, sending things by boat is much better then by truck. But it's not like it magically teleports onto and off of the boats, it gets brought to and taken away from the docks by truck. So at the end of the day it's just as bad, if not worse then locally sourced food. And for the grain feed argument, yeah, some farms do grow grain explicitly for livestock. But most livestock feed comes from grain that simply wasn't good enough for human consumption. Farmers generally don't grow crops explicitly for livestock, because it's more profitable to grow food suitable for humans.  While I do agree that we would be better off eating less meat, I don't agree with misrepresenting the facts. It's so unlike your videos to be this way, I'm almost tempted to chalk it up to poorly done research, but you constantly talk to experts. There's no way you missed that, and absolutely no excuse for that graph at the end.
Make a part 2! Fish & seafood wasn't mentioned and they didn't mention how many cultures in our world eat insects as a good meat-type food resource.
Hope people don't turn him into another  vegan teacher. If not vegan at least go beef free
The only thing I think was missing is the total water consumption needed to produce beef, since you also mentioned the amount of food used. And maybe some insights about how obesity is related to meat consumption.
ive been waiting for a new video and here it is.
ThatVegonTeacher on her way to call Kurzgesagt the head of the animal genocide:
Buy Irish food cuz we are the most sustainable 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🥩
Freeing up 3 billion hectares would be amazing, but as soon as that land isn't being used for agriculture, corporations will buy it up and use it for something else, nullifying its usefulness. Companies and corporations go livid when they see undeveloped land. After all, plants "just sitting there doing nothing" doesn't make any money!
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old."  OnlyFans stans: "Wanna bet"
i rather keep eating meat and dont buy a car
One thing that isn't talked about enough is that you can still make a big impact by not eating *as much* meat as you do now. Try to limit it to once a week even and you're making huge strides, especially if people started doing that collectively. The "you must be vegan or vegetarian" argument is too extreme for most people. Think if you had 7 people cut meat out one day a week it's almost like one of them became a vegetarian.

NICE, another episode
the entirety of existence, reality, evolution and the human experience led to me enjoying a nice serving of butter chicken tonight  edit: and a chicken suffering :(
Hi, can you guys also make a course on skillshare about how you do your research? That would be helpful and I will buy the skillshare membership for that.
good point, unfortunately im in your walls.
Was genuinely expecting arguments pro or against how healthy they are...
That "Well.. it's complicated" gets me everytime hahaha. Love This Channel ❤.
i watched this whole video and my excel spreadsheet still hasn't finished refreshing a pivot. LMAO
Personal I'll say that a vegan diet is a horrible idea. It's not that I think that we should only eat meat, and it's not that I hate vegetables. Meat just as enough protein and carbon to build you. (And I'm not going to bring up global warming and climate change since I believe that it's just a load of cow crap)
2:48 "A kilogram of beef will keep you alive much longer than a kilogram of potatoes"  Mark Watney: "Not if you know what you're doing!"
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive." Allow me to introduce you to hash oil sir.
i don't eat beef i only eat ham and chicken, mostly chicken. so im already a good person for not contributing to climate change. then again its tyson chicken patties so make of that what you will
Uhhh… fish love?
you forgot the fact that the remains of food that humans eats are going to animals like the remains of Crops...
I'll keep eating beef thanks very much
damn *beef stonks*
This needs to be trending
Game meat, is more environmentally friendly than other meat as well as vegetarian diet.
does this analysis factor in the rate of which people eat beef per country?... places like the USA use too much beef compared to places like north african countries where beef is a once a month at best kind of food (thanks to poverty and general cultural and traditional principals)
Cow farts? Cow farts is the way the world is gonna end??
fight the source of the problem, not the problem itself
i am every day more certain that we as a human specie will not be able to overcome the HELL that we denominated "Global heating" that we ourselves are creating, this is soo sad but its becoming more and more a reality
So basically if we get rid of beef we deal with a significant amount of global warming via food whilst keeping a lot of other meats.
Upvote this comment to actually downvote the video.
Why would you include the co2 released in the burning of the amazon rain forest for farm land in the beef industries co2 emission percentage. it just skews the numbers. if they used the land for growing wheat, wheat would have the same massive co2 emission range. you are literally including the industrial burning of thousands of acres of rain forest in a statistical analysis of the co2 emissions generated by the production method of types of food. co2 that is generated by an industry that is at best a fucking stupidly unsustainable land development program. that land can be used by every industry that needs cheap land. if you want to use it as an example of shit land management go ahead. These co2 emissions should be in the land development category not the food production category.
Ok I will eat less meat
Everyone in this comment section who's concerned of animal product emissions but isn't really that sure about how bad factory farming can really be, should watch Dominion and Earthlings.
8:56 What about the part of cereal and soy crops that human can't digest? When you say 19% of them. Do you mean 19% of the weight of the entire crop or 19%of the soy beans produced?
Do you think they'll ever do anything on replacing protein rich foods with insect protein??
*Dislike* —use this as dislike
When India refuses to commit to cutting out coal, what will cutting meat do in the long term. The way to stop global warming is to educate developing countries and make sustainable energy as cheap and as available for everyone as possible. Anything else is a drop in the bucket.
If im the head of the animal holocaust, does that make me Meatler?  -Ray
I'm only one getting tired of these??? Solution simple, don't waste and make as much is needed, but what you gonna do, bad business and sort of illegal/dictatorship for the win.
Laughs in Hinduism
And to think that those were only the environmental aspects, not even touching on the ethical side of meat.
NICE A NEW VIDEO FINNILY WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS MOMENT HAHAHA
I wonder how did you learned this things :D      IM A GREAT FAN
Look at that cow in the thumbnail
What about artificial meat? Assuming it can be scaled up, be cost effective, and  would be co2 friendly ofc. A significant portion of meat we eat is processed anyway
How is buying local food don't make much difference ?!!, You forgot the journey of the avocados from their farm lands to different ports of Brazil via TRUCKS.
13 seconds and Im already hungry. I dont get hungry otherwise. Is this meat addiction?
Keep it up
video suggestion: an explanation of schrödinger's cat. thank you!
Oh no, the Vegan Teacher is going to be knocking on your door, Kurzgesagt.
Against Youtube Nazism. I disliked this video. Comment or like if you did too.
“ No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old” are u sure about that
Eating living walking things are wrong 😭
“So what’s the worst part of meat production?” “Deforestation.”
is this part 2?
I LOVE MEATTTT
lab grown meat ?
Oi, vim só pra dizer FORA BOLSONARO
Personally, when plant based alternatives cost the same or less than meat I'm switching over. The new stuff tastes pretty good 👍
I know that not everyone has the same luxury, but if you can, consider hunting. In my state, you're allowed 3 ungulates (deer,elk etc) 1 black bear, and 1 horned (mountain goat, bighorn sheep etc) per year. Plenty enough wild game to get you through the year and no animals suffering from factory life.
PFFFOOOD
Fitting that a video about food would be so easy to digest.
Love this channel, hate how much you push vegetarianism/ being vegan. If they take away farms, im buying a gun immediately and ill just start shooting them myself.
How does hunting and foraging stack up? I know the obvious of possibly overhunting or over consumption of resources, but it seems like a good way for people to appreciate and truly understand the privilege of having meat and certain plants in our diets. Overall, I feel the problem is over consumption and not meat being bad.
That vegan teacher: I’m gonna pretend I didn’t hear that.
There should be a merch saying “well..It’s complicated.”
Animal protein is the most costly, we really need to eliminate human race, not cattle.
I get sad everytime i watch your videos, but such is the price of knowledge, keep up the amazing work!!
Cows and Chicken would eat you if they could. So appreciate the fact that we have the upper hand, for now.
Honestly not the best comparison at 9:25 you compare the CO2 removed from it over *100* years and compare it to humanity’s yearly production of it, it’s a little misleading is all
0:00 "No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day..." Depends. 😏
Not being vegan is kinda sus. What do you want an animal's meat in your mouth?
A distinction needs to be made between feed lot meat (probably not good for the environment in any way, but neither are acres of monocultured crops) and more traditionally raised animals, especially those raised in an intentional, regenerative way that can actually be EXTREMELY GOOD for the environment (breaking up and refertilizing soils that have been depleted and compacted by years of mechanical agriculture and are now being eroded massively due to no life holding them together...for example). Emissions are not the only part of the story either. What is growing in a region has a direct effect on the climate there. Planting trees in an arid region for example can begin to trap moisture, increase local humidity, slow down rain bearing weather, and improve the fertility of the soil - and the diversity of the local ecosystem. Cows, ranched or pastured appropriately, create a number of positive effects on soil biodiversity, which caused positive changes up the chain, too.
Another good video that fails to bring up the indigenous perspective...
There is another human activity that is better than diet for curbing greenhouse gas emissions - stop making babies.
Talking about methane emissions from livestock and not saying that this methane comes from the food they are given, which is fixed atmospheric CO2, is manipulating.
I was eating a giant cheeseburger and chicken nuggets when this video hit my play list lol
From my opinion drasticaly increasing the number of trees and also drasticaly decreasing human pupulation (aprox 2 bilion) would be a great eay to slow down by alot the CO2 increase, are human lives more important the health of the Earth's biosphere? Only a nuclear war or mass masacre of the human population can help in this diraction fast, cous kant rly say that 200 years are anoth for reducing global population.
Vegan teacher is in my opinion a Karen
In 2022 we are leaving behind the notion that personal consumption choices can or will adequately address climate catastrophe.   Imagine you have a pen pal in the Marshall Islands who’s curious what you (a citizen of the overdeveloped Global North) are doing for climate change action. What will you tell her? You’re personally abstaining from meat and plastic products? Or are you organizing your peers and neighbors to change the system as a whole? Which one do you think will be more effective in the coming decades?
what about meat produced in a lab?
Send this to a VEGAN and they will be mad but I’m a carnivore not a Vegan
💯 Lies remember kurzgesagt is founded by Bill Gates the greatest producer of Artificial meet all of data in this video has been manipulate to look as a meatpocalipse why? The want to think for you so you can feel guilty and change your mind set and eventually rare and conveniently you make your own research looking for alternatives and surprise surprise Bill get the big Prize
What is the carbon footprint of fish, specifically things like tuna or salmon ?
Overpopulation is never a discussed topic in these videos, the biggest problem and the uneröying reason to all of this. Also meat has been eaten through our time as a species. A biased video; statistics can lie
I love meat, allow it
It is the difference of CO2 produced in the transport alone of the food plus transport. I am sorry for the inconvenience but that is the only thing that is not clear to me.   Thank you very much
The main reason cows produce so much methane is because of their diet, so throughout the years people have been trying to find alternatives to the food cows eat so they produce less methane. Apparently researchers found that a species of Red Sea weed can be fed to cows which in turn lowers their emissions to nearly 0%. Maybe beef doesn’t have to be so dangerous to the atmosphere. But I’m not sure if it’s that effective at reducing methane, and I’m also not sure if it’s too expensive to feed to cows on a global scale. It’s just something to look into.
There's so much more we use cows bodies than meat. Somehow it should be divided to meats, hides, fluids, bones, tissues and all other matter.
Good video as usual, but I think it could have been slightly longer and could have covered so many more important points e.g: the moral aspect of looking after a cow for its full life and killing it humanely vs mindlessly killing thousands of small animals per hectare of cereal crop production. Kris Kresser covers this aspect really well as well as the nutrient quality of meats vs grains. I feel like you played it safe waiting until the dislike counter was removed!
It is about animal suffering... not just climate change
6:25 It's true for people too.
Personally, I've dramatically decreased beef in my diet. I almost never order it, with the exception of one restaurant's beef gyōza, and at home I only use it for meatballs (but I should switch that to chicken.) I can't remember the last time I had a steak, and I always get chicken sandwiches instead of burgers. Beef really should be an occasional indulgence, given its climate expense, rather than a staple of many diets in the way it is. I know I can't make a huge difference individually, but I hope I can encourage at least a few people to do the same as me. None of us can be perfect to the planet, and we should hold the systems that cause so much damage to the earth to account, but there are small things we can do as well! Honestly, I don't miss beef in the places I've cut it out.
this makes me wanna be vegan but i like beef so much :(((((((((
To me, it feels like the only way we can survive is by reducing the world's population. Was Thanos right all along?
Just to let you know, lately scientists discovered a way to make meat from animal cells
Yes beef is very bad. We should be eating insects for animal based protein. Like crickets.
Not a single mention of the carbon sequestration of grazing ground? I would argue cattle are carbon neutral as they only emit what they have already consumed. Just like all living creatures.  It’s the fossil fuels creating the carbon footprint.
Planting 3 billion hectares of forest has it's own set of problems,including endangering animal species. it's not as easy as it sounds.
I'm vegan
Teacher: So, what did we learn from this video?  Me: *Beef Stonks*
Imma still eat meat but um all vegan ls and vegetarians thanks for saving meat for us and carnivores thanks for saving plants for them.   It's an absolute win win
how does transportion of meat differ from vegetables'? about 7200 times more CO2???? how the?? are you sure you're not exaggerating?
Well anyway, I've dined on a steak sandwich tonight.
You should watch the "What I've Learned" video on meat consumption. Great amount of detail and no propaganda
beef STONKS!!!!
Just a question could you capture cows methane for use in pyrolysis (a way to gat a lot of hydrogen)
Vegans make me sick.
"Food is not optional" i dunno, i've been living off of cosmic rays for the past 2 million years and i'm just fine
Based on this information I'm going  to do nothing except start a family and help increase the total number of mouths on earth to feed like everyone else is doing.
What about lab grown meat?
About the transport part, you only included the ship part, so what, the ship goes directly to your home? No trucks are required to move the food from the docks to the super market? Just have that question
What about hunting? Could that work to fulfill the meat needs of households without a giant meat factory?
meh i dont care if the world ends after i die :D
Hi! Question! What about how the U.S. Government pays farmers not to use a majority of their land; could we not turn that into grass-fed land for Cattle to graze and replenish the land naturally? Was this considered, just curious!
The unthinkable solution to ending impact of humanity. Kill all humans. The Bender solution. If this is the goal of those opposed to human impact on the planet, let them kill themselves first. I am not expected anyone to do that, cause those who are completely opposed to human impact on the planet would have already done it already.
i feel like videos like this just totally goes against the concept of its "eco facism" to suggest that the earth holds too many people argument. if there was simply less people, all of this would be happening at a smaller and thus more manageable rate. PERHAPS it would hold credence if the technology, money or willpower was there to do something about it, but it's not HENCE the only solution I can see would be "perhaps less people would help" but even the that's obviously not gonna happen either   i wonder how lab grown meat ties into all this
819,286th
Lol... Birds doing bbq in nutshell 😂 😂 😂
Nope, it's best kind of food forever and ever!
Normally I really love your videos because I feel they are well researched and unbiased. But this video seems very biased. Why did you not bring up that hearded cattle allowd to graze in more than 1 area actually trample more carbon into the earth than they sometimes produce in methane? Or that scientists are already producing vaccines that reduce and sometimes eliminate methane in cows. I do believe humans need a more varried diet and we shouldn't rely so much on beef. But this video seems extremley biased and only offers the solution of vegetarianism or veganism. They don't get into more varried meats or any other options. They brought up regained land and possibly putting trees back which I think is great. But you know what produces more oxygen and eats more carbon and doesn't require huge land mass? Algae. My point being there is more than the 1 solution presented here and for the first time I am dissapointed.
I like how you post this when the dislike function has been disabled this is also your second video on the subject. Interesting 🤔
I feel like Kurz is doing too many videos on climate and trying to single-handedly make people change their habits. This is inefficient and basically useless, as the few people who would change their ways of life because of this video will have zero impact on the climate. If you really want to make use of your influence, you should try to make your audience be able to make changes that matter without needing half the world to do the same to have an effect, such as inspiring the possible futures of lab grown meat.
The solution to climate change is to get rid of 3/4 of the human population.  You first.
No one is talking about the US military...
It's funny how countries like India have much less meat production (specially beef because it's banned). But it has very high carbon emissions due to the vehicles, industries etc which is so much due to the population.
Kurzgesagt: Feeding billions of people is impossible without causing emissions... (proceeds to tell us exactly how much emissions and the insane significance that has). Also Kurzgesagt on their population video: Oh no, we are totally fine with 8 billion of us and growing (almost at a rate of 2.5 births for every one death), this is totally natural and we'll just slow down on our own someday! In fact we already have kinda! All nifty in this world! *thumbs up* Also Kurzgesagt: Climate change is SERIOUS AND WE NEED TO FIND A WAY T----  Pick one.
Yes..... Meat is shit
I think we should just like, stop eating food, give it a week and the world will be much better
0:04 CHICKEN FAT, CHICKEN ON THE TABLE    CANABALISM??
All i hear from your amazing videos is " yes, we are fu*ked, get over it"
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old"  I beg to differ.
Cuckedgesagt
i will eat meat and it will get warmer and I do not care
Meat is healthiest food that humans can eat. It’s the best thing ever
Could you have indoor farms with air filters using natural wind?
They are not "beef' - they are cows! They are alive cubs or adult. And that should be very important.
In my humble opinion: there's nothing wrong with having beef or meat in general as long as you eat your fill and not in excess. A huge problem with first world countries is that we waste *so. much. food.* Literally half of all meat we buy we forget about and eventually throw out because it goes bad. I've tried to make a more conscious effort to turn beef back into a special treat. On average you should only have about 16oz of red meat per week at max, but a lot of people go to like 32-40oz a week maybe even more. All that cholesterol isn't good for you anyway. So I would only have red meat like twice a week and fill my days with chicken, fish and leaner meats as much as I can. Makes steak or korean bbq feel special again and not something I take for granted.
When you blink while watching Kurzgesagt videos you miss 40 hours of work
it's not
Great work kurzgesagt,  👏  don't worry about the graph, people always redirect attention when they don't like what you are talking about. When the truth becomes hard to argue with they do this just to avoid being wrong. It's human nature. Being wrong is energetically expensive for an organism.
Thank you for this video. I hope a few anti-vegans could learn something today.
Its not about the emissions, its about compassion
borger > future generations
What is we eat ALL the cows?
Meat is tasty but it’s morally wrong
I like so much the kurzgesagt button :D 0:27
Food stonks was the best thing so far today
Please consider if the entire world suddenly went a plant based diet and what that would actually reflect in emissions (current theoretical research shows it really wouldn't be very impactful positively on the environment and in a lot of ways, be worse). Our diets are not an issue even worth talking about in terms of emissions; our overconsumption and demand for anything and everything all of the time is the problem.
CO2 IS NOT, IS NOT, IS NOT POLLUTION, BUT THE GAS OF LIFE. OF LIFE.
Go vegan! Most of the time :D
we should genetically modify cows to fart less or use another waste material than methane
Americas eat so much beef, the rest of the world could live with eating less oft it. At least I could. :)
The Bible may be a compilation of knowledge,    Perhaps so well picked that once you read it no philosophy really impresses you anymore,  now I  long to understand the physics of the universe.
Has kurzgesagt done product placements before? Like skillshare this time at the end?
I’m a simple man. More plants means more less CO2 released. Less cows and animals means less things that consume them. So i’m consuming meat keep them from even more multiplying anyway.
if we didnt eat the cows, they would still die and rot on the ground and cause the same emission though so it doesnt really change much.
k **efwareq _-asdasd-_
Thanks for the vid. It was not he answer I was hoping for, but ... well, at least now I know.
Is this one a reupload ?
I'm gonna preface this by saying it's a joke, some people don't know what a joke is so yeah.   So in order to fix global warming, we just need to use Africa, there's nothing important there anyways
We dont necessarily have to stop eating meat ( even thought it would be the best option ), the best solution for people to stay at least bit happy and dont get angry because of non meat diet is to decreese meat consumption and to decrasse food waste.  People dont need to eat meat every day and they should stop buying unnecessariliy too much food.
I don't think it's that bad, in fact I'd say it's quite tasty
No.
The highlight of my day!
You know what you're doing with that into
Raising livestock basically means we'd have to sustain a population of billions of people AND billions of animals, which might just not be sustainable. It's the demand for food that makes this such a difficult problem. We'll have to see how much artificial meat development progresses, because although inefficient in some ways, we can't entirely remove meat from the diets of everyone and substitute it with something equivalent.
Will there be anything covering cultured/ lab grown meat?
I guess I could give up cheeseburgers; I’m addicted to chicken though
We’re never going vegan it’s impossible
So impressed!! I was worried this video was going to try and justify the consumption of meat for some BS reason. Even remaining completely objective and keeping ethics aside, the winner is clear. 💚🌱
What if we find a way to capture the methane produced by cattle and use it as fuel?
what abouth hay that comes from grain fields it has to be used some how too?
This just means that we shouldn't focus ONLY on the 26% meat produced carbon foot print. We can eat less meat in general but if we don't work harder on the 74% remaining it would all be basically pointless.
where is my turkısh subtitle
I couldn’t live without meat personally, but I can see the massive impact it has. Is it possible for you to look into methane processing and see if it would be complicated for a company or government to develop processing plants which uses reduction agents to form methanol, or even combine the hydrocarbons to form ethanol, both extremely valuable fuels and resources? Might be worth investment in the near future.
As a meat enjoyer myself, I've had a personal dilemma over this topic for a while now. It's good to see it boiled down to something easy to process. I think, based on this information, there's no need for people to stop eating meat per se, but I think we should all eat less meat overall and hold the meat industry more accountable where needed and encourage or subsidize cleaner, more humane practices. I'm sure the solution will come with time.
Isn't misleading that they only took the carbon emissions for the shipment of avocados to the port but they didn't accounted for the truck from the port to the market? Your sources also said nothing about it   Also the graph at 9:32, why are you using different time scales? Isn't it misleading too?
no matter how I hard I try, I just cannot imagine how the speaker could look like based off his voice
BEEF STONKS ⬆️
I feel like eating a hamburger now after watching this video
who else watches these while stoned?
peepepepeppeee
Wah cow fart bad 😭
That's great and all but what's the point if China and India keep doing as there doing? Why am I meant to be sacrificing stuff like this if these two countries make my sacrifice amount to nothing? It's really hard to take this stuff seriously when I'm supposed to sacrifice but the two other largest carbon emitters don't do anything at all.
I love meat 🤤 yummy
video released 5 hours ago and already has over 11 thousand comments.
please stop making so much video about how bad meat is. it's just enough already.
We're meat.  What's the climate impact of 7 billion humans eating, breathing, pissing and shitting?  Maybe we can eliminate more than enough carbon footprint through sterilization of the most unproductive population.  Oh, wait.  That runs afoul of politics that are even more insidious than the climate's.
Stopped eating meat on May 30, 2015 and it had nothing to do with emissions.
well i think you should make primarily cliamte based videos now since it could make a big difference with the viewer  base you have
“Food is the only bodily pleasure enjoyed multiple times a day” Are you sure about that?
Maybe the worst offender is lack of ethics and morale. So yes, meat is bad.
I suspect the calculation on the transport cost of food is not correct. Global shipping accounts for around 12% of global emissions from memory.
I want my beef, let this planet burn!
Carnivorism = Speciesism = Cannibalism | That's it. It's a sin to overcome in a world filled with sinners, made by beings of low vibrational cultures.
Could that title be any longer chandler reference? Hmmmmmmmmm?
So don't eat local and use cow factories 😂
Now I feel bad. But here's your like.
The problem with this discussion is that we forget that the biggest producer of pollution and greenhouse gases is the industry, in addition a large part of the industry is focused on consumerism, disposable products and cheaply made electronics that are very useless. So, I would definitely prefer to have more durable electronics than stop eating meat.
9:21. That part is super misleading.  It says that 800 billions tons of CO2 every 100 years would be sucked up by the amout of land freed up by everyone being vegan.  They then compare it to the 50 billion tons of CO2 get emoted each year.  The problem is it is 800 tons/100 years vs 50 tons/1year so a better comparison would be 8 tons compared to 50 tons emitted each year
I like food.
“It’s complicated” should be another slogan of the channel
no?
👍
Maybe in the future a video about how much more effective sea grass is at storing carbon?
Maybe in the future the matrix will be real, but instead of for humans we'll have animals living their lives in a simulation while stuck in growing pods. Cool concept really, not sure how to feel about it.
You cut meat out of your diet, then near the end of your life, a volcano erupts and puts more emissions in the atmosphere than all of humanity.
The first 4 seconds is the reason I love this channel.
I'm eating a fat juicy steak while watching this
That thumbnail is getting dangerously close to being an ahegao cow. An ahecow, if you will.
Stopping using beef would save 500 billions tonnes of co2, without bringing problems that comes with meat less diet.
So that means we should just remove all food problem solved.
Some numbers don't add up. You said getting the 1 kg of beef from your local butcher to home emits 18kg of CO2. If so, getting 1kg of vegetables from your local supermarket should also emit around 18kg CO2. How are total emissions for vegetable less than 18?
Meat is bad for the environment. However, one must consider that if the entire US decided to go vegan, it would only reduce the US' total emissions by 2.6 percent. Look up the research article "Nutritional and greenhouse gas impacts of removing animals from US agriculture" by Robin R. White and Mary Beth Hall for reference. Becoming vegetarian/vegan is a good thing, but there are much better ways to reduce one's emission footprint than to become vegan/vegetarian.
why should i care about the "carbon footprint" of my burger, it tastes good, thats all that really matters, the world wont end because it gets 2 degrees warmer, it will simply change, and change back again.
this was below the happy meats farm video I was watching
As biological life forms we have our needs, until mankind as a whole invest and cooperate into scientifical breakthroughs in transhumanism we'll always have these earthbound problems such as food, shelter, mental health etc.. it's the only solution against certain and unavoidable human suffering
What about the capitalistic supermarkets that are completely garbage, they  have too much products available at all times, which is inefficient. How much do these big corps actually throw out in terms of products? Yeah, our ways of enjoying and buying food non chalant is bad
how bad is it for the enviroment to hunt moose as they walk around in the nature anyways?
Can we get more space videos? Something about Dark forest solution to the Fermi paradox would be awesome
The thumbnail is scary
The cow farting in the lab. I can’t even XD
ngl beef isnt even that tasty, im trying to cut out eating meat and animal products all together and the hardest thing to cut out is chicken (and ice cream, only bcos my grocery store doesn't have vegan icecream or sorbet)
Between the pressures of culture, habit and cost, I don't think anyone reasonably expects the entirety of mankind to turn vegan overnight, but..... Maybe, just maybe, we gotta cut back a little? At least those of us that can? 😬
me after waching 4 seconds: NO! THAT'S NOT TRUE!  (i don't hate kurzgesakt by any meany, infact i love it, but this is the one of the most stupip thing that i heard!)
Perhaps you could model out what would happen to food demands and global greenhouse gas production if world population was halved?
Interesting thumbnail
And I thought they gonna talk about gout
Doesn't the decomposition of wasted food also produce methane?
But I like hamburgers.
What if the problem is easier then we think.... What and how would it all be like if all food came from one area.... And not spread around the whole world.
You haaaaad to make this a day after I had a project due on this topic
Only rich countries care about climate change caused by food. The rest of the world just wants a full belly.
Eat moose and raindeer meat. They live in balance with the ecosystem so the emissions are very low.
I feel like this channel twists the truth. Specially with cargo ship. The supplies came from farms then drove to most local port then load onto ship. Transport to ship and loading didn't produce emissions. But driving local growing meat to local market will produce more emissions. Starting emissions count from cargo ship leaving Port is false. And again unloading cargo from ports to markets doesn't create emissions. Also in European countries truck and cars are on average newer more environmentally friendly than some countries of food production
:/
If we can produce a dense brick of crickets that tastes like a red-robin burger and is good for you, i'd switch in a heartbeat.
Please run us up on the health of Seed Oils soon. II was a massive proponant of beyond beef and impossiburgers til I learned more about the suspicious history of them.
I am now sad
I’m done with this channel
I would like to help with translating the captions to portuguese
I imagine at some point there will be government regulations to restrict access to meat for the common people and offer up insects or something as an alternative. Until then I want to enjoy my occasional serving of meat.
I'm sure the vegans are going crazy in the comments, but saying "we should just stop eating meat" is about as much a solution to climate change as "we should just reduce the population by a few billion people".  1) What we should actually do should be policy-based. Emissions need to be taxed, which would make the price of meat, especially expensive beef, go up, ending in reduce consumption... or more efficient production methods. The entire population eating 30% less meat would have the same effect as 30% of the population going vegan, but it's a much more realistic goal. 2) Bleeding-hearts and hippies need to stop going on about local suppliers, organic foods, hating GMOs or wanting to only eat meat from grass-fed cows who get a hug at least twice a day. Half the time it's just a marketing gimmick, but it actually makes production way less efficient.
Where do the local emissions come from? How much better is it if you walk to and from the butcher?
Helping us make informed decisions - thank you!
Kurzgesagt: Food is, arguably, the best thing about being alive.  Zuckerberg: *adds to 'How to act alive' list*
Cows produce 2 more thing other than meat.  Milk and leather .... Where those factored into the calculations?
“Beef stonks”  It’s great that Kurzgesagt keeps up with current culture lol
So if humans were not around and cows roamed freely, and they were hunted by other types of Apex predators, their farts, and 💩 would still be doing what they’re doing anyway.    How about we turn our attention to just the  F🤬king non-living man made environmental hazards, than blaming meat eaters.     Vegans and Vegetarians have a high enough horse to sit on as it is.
Title-Is meat really that bad? All vegetarians and vegans-we have been summoned
All this is good and all, but I ain't giving up my Chicken, beef, I'll give up, but I want chicken.
Just go vegan. It was never so easy and tasty and will only get better over time, the more people just do the change. You could safe so many lifes and the earth if you just stopped eating corpses and cow breast milk.
Honestly I think motorcycles and mopeds are a better step forward for most. Better gas mileage to and from work and more capable of being converted to electric than a full car and more affordable too.
Yay upload
you will eat ze bug.
While individuals have agency to reduce their footprint, as per Kurzgesagt's other video on climate, the only way this works is large scale enforcement. Beef, lamb, and dairy can not be outlawed, but it can be made significantly less attractive to businesses and consumers. Carbon taxes are one example, companies have to pay for each ton of emission. This would increase operating costs, and either make said industries/restaurants less money. And/or push costs on to consumers, causing other food options to be more attractive. Now of course, this requires policy makers to enact them, but this _can_ be influenced by an otherwise political minority. Vote for people supporting green policy, and vote for them again IF they follow through. Be outspoken in your community, and petition your representatives to adopt climate policy.
There are questions I have that I don't think were completely answered in this video (and maybe I'll have to dig into Kurzgesagt's sources later).  1. What is the complete impact of the diet of ruminant's (cows) to the overall food production climate impact? It's well known that cows can 'up-cycle' certain foods that are inedible to humans such as corn husks. Does the data presented in this video consider this?  2. In the estimates for greenhouse gas emissions from cattle, does it consider where the 'origin' of the carbon /methane come from? Burning coal emits from a previously isolated source of carbon, where as the carbon that a cow would emit is likely from their diet and not 'new' to the carbon cycle in general. It would (in my best estimation) come from carbon that has already been absorbed into plants etc and then just be re-emitted by the cattle post-consumption. Although the total numbers of C02 and Methane are not changed, I think its dis-ingenuous to treat the emissions as the same as say coal and natural gas emissions.   In general, should we try and optimize the efficiency of ranching and beef production? Yes. Should we generally eat a little less meat? Probably. But I would be opposed to the idea that the answer is a completely meat-free diet. In developing countries, they might not have the agriculture infrastructure required to usurp meat in their diets or have the resources required to import the ingredients necessary to eliminate meat from the diets of the citizens.
*watches this while eating a burger*
Around three quarter of men would rather DIE than give up meat. So unless you feel like fighting a war outnumbered 3 to 1, it ain't gonna happen.
Being a complete vegetarian since last 24 years( i.e my age😛)!! Makes me feel a Lil good about being on this planet.
Come on, just don't eat beef. There are so many pleasures nowadays, really one can easily find something else to do/eat.
Obviously a well-done (see what I did there) video. Unfortunately it treats all foods only by their emissions and not by the their actual qualities as food for humans, and so by omission (emission?) perpetrates the false equivalency of, “Meat is bad for the environment, so just go vegan everyone!” I realize that to deal with this the video would be twice as long, but perhaps a future video will deal with the science of actual food quality as it relates to health outcomes.
This is a very intresting topic.              But can you nuke something next time?
let's just all be anorexics.
Communist Propaganduh
Why don’t we address the elephant in the room: human population. Less human less food required less production overall. Alas we won’t , economy needs consumers!
what about seafood?
It's a good thing YouTube removed dislikes because you're about to get ratioed for spreading this commie propaganda bullshit!
Honey wake up, there's a new kurgezart video!
Great content, I'm very glad to see this video as a vegetarian, I also like that this channel audience is very educated instead of a bunch of cave people who seem to despise diversity in any form for some reason, props to that.
I feel like a lot is missed out here. What about all the food that is wasted due to overproduction? The UN says that around 17% of all food goes in the bin. How much food and emmissions are created for food that arguably is not needed like Potatoe chips, candies, etc? I feel as though the situtation is significantly more complex and to break it down so simply is a little misleading. Unfortunately, many (most) don't eat for sustinance anymore. Most are gluttenous to a certain extent (look at global obecity and how it kills more than malnourishment now). I wonder how much of all this food actually needs to be made and how much is made just for money and greed.
Wait what? So we will just ignore the entire rainforest problem if I buy avocados from Brazil (even if the shipping is super efficient)? Isn't the whole point of buying locally (when living in the US/Europe) that you can rely on the produce being made fairly, according to the local (ecological) norms as they're way more strictly enforced than in some country where the norms don't exist/aren't enforced as much?  Lost a point there...
I will make my part and stop eating at all. You welcome.
🌱💚
Beef S T O N K S
That co2 comparison graphic is misleading. It makes it look like freeing up that land would give us 800b co2 removal per year instead of 100 years. We’d really be removing 8 billion and producing 50 billion but your graphic has the 8 billion bar way longer than the 50 billion one…  I love your vids and I don’t think you have much bias so I hope you will correct this and maintain your credibility
Only 13% of cows are sustained by pastureland.  You mean 13% of cows are sustained by pastureland ALONE right? Or its cows that are only sustained by grazing. You cant be counting in grass silage from pastures with this number. People have tried feeding cows with only mais/corn silage with some protein fodder as supplement. Often that being waste from soya production for human food.   It does'nt work. The cows get health issues, and sick cows does not earn the farmer more money. Quite the opposite
The _unknown amount of dislikes_ are oppressive vegans trying to convince everyone to eat beans instead of beef.
The thumbnail with the cute cow and the hearts that says meat love above it makes me sick.  This channel is disgusting. Cows are being needlessly and brutally slaughtered. Do not depict cows as being infatuated with the idea of being meat. It's heinous and psychopathic.
what if we can duplicate animals that will drop the CO2 at least by 50%?
I’ll eat tofu and lab cell growth meat but not the estrogen soy boy crap
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old."  ....should someone tell them?
As a meat eater this is very interesting! I feel like a big thing we need to do as a society is reduce our meat consumption. No need to go full vegan/vegetarian! Not to say those diet preferences are bad of course.  I've struggled with my weight for a long time (fluctuations of 45 lbs, very seasonal with our farm work hours varying as well), but the times I was leanest and most energetic was when I kept my meat to veggie ratio low. I haven't researched it fully, but this diet design seems to be common in lower income countries I believe. Not only because of the cost, but also because it's healthier!  I also believe our population has grown to such a number that we can't support it without high emission food production. Especially because of high rates of consumption, when the rate at which we consume is far too high in developed countries, much more than it should be to support life.  Beyond that, I subscribe to the belief that the human race would benefit greatly, in many aspects, from smaller scale agriculture/ranching. Plus wild game consumption at a sustainable rate. If we could cut back a bit in America, I think a lot of our climate issues would lessen substantially.  Anyway, my two cents
Just go vegan
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive" Wdym having to eat is just a hassle
P O T A T O E S!
Going vegan won't necessarily help, since destroying the forests to plant soy instead is no more constructive than destroying forests to raise cattle. Unfortunately it's up to those in power to actually fight climate change instead on just pretending to do so. At our scale it's not like we can do anything significant...
funny thing here, USA is the primary consumer of beef worldwide...
you can use livestock rotation incorporated with crop rotation to increase the fertility of the soil and reduce desertion and erosion.  They can make crops stronger.  The majority of carbon created by the livestock itself is sequestered in the immediate environment.  If you co mingled forests with farmland and livestock you would have a great biome for producing healthy food.    The elimination of roaming livestock has had negative impacts on the earth.  factory farming and veggie burgers is not the answer
i cut beef out of my diet since 8th grade (5 years ago) after my biology teacher told the class about its extreme impact on the environment. Since then I've only had one or two bites of a burger that a family member had ordered, and I can say that I really don't miss beef. Anyone out there thinking about reducing how much beef they eat i believe in you!! you wont regret it
Orgulho do Brasil, quando vai aparecer em algo internacional é como um exemplo ruim
My takeaway from this video was - meat isn't that bad, but burning down rainforests sure is
a subject suggestion: *SOY* armful or great I heard a lot of bad stories about men getting weird hormonal "things" when ingested a lot for example, a man switching to a heavy soy diet and in some months, growing breasts. While on the other side, the usual suspects call it the best thing ever.  alright the man soy breast story turned out to be quite an outlier however, there are books calling it a scam or the worse thing ever  point standing, interesting subject : *SOY* pros and cons
Food is both the best and worst part of life.
You completely glossed over the fact that although cows eat crops, they mostly eat the non human edible parts. Cows eat soy husks not actual soy beans. You can even sustain cows by feeding them rice straws laced with ammonia.
Its just incredible what u did for us im always so exited when i see a new video but im also thinking of the hundreds of hours and the frustration behind...thats why im so gratefull to evryone on kurzgesagt team,and remember were here and we are supporting you guys evry step of the way.Gongrats on 17M subs,u deserved it!
I've telling people for ages now. There is something is fundamentally wrong with the way we treat innocent animals and exploit them cruelly for our own sensory pleasure. I've been Vegan for years now, and more than the health benefits,being Vegan actually saves planet. Thank you for the informative video Kurzgesagt
Crap, and here I thought this video would change the facts and declare beef production harmless so I wouldn't have to worry about my eating habits no more.
yay, a German channel financed by Bill Gates is telling poor proplr not to eat beef because reasons.
Go vegan.
Rest in peace dislike button! (Not that I use it on kurtz vidoes)
im bulking so idc
I’m curious, what about fish
Yeah I’ll take my steak medium rare thanks
Hum,time for us to find a way to eat meat without polluting the planet. This will be very hard,but i believe the love for the taste of meat and the fear of losing such taste will make us think a way to do it.
I suppose I'm lucky that I don't even enjoy beef that much. I'll eat a hamburger if it's made for dinner, but I won't beg for it as I might for chicken. My brother has given up beef entirely, after extensive research, and is trying to get the rest of my family to do so. I have a vegetarian sister, but that's mostly because of her love for animals and not because of their emissions. I think I've heard somewhere that for every 42 calories put into a cow, you get one calorie out of it . I don't know if that's true or not because I can't remember the exact source I got it from (I might've even gotten that fact from this channel, come to think of it), but it's an interesting tidbit to think about.
Seems meat isn't that bad! Guess just the animals lives is the problem!
7:40 warhammer referance?!?!?!?
Tough subject. I love your unbiased analysis of these topics. Overall best channel on youtube!
Ah, then the only viable hope to keep what is the favored part of many diets seems to be synthesized meat. Not talking about some vegan trying to convince me beans taste and feel like beef, but cloning a steak and eating a lab-grown piece of meat. If we can manage to advance that technology without making it worse than what we're replacing, things just might start looking up not only for the climate, but  for the ethical problems with meat that drive people to avoid it all together as well
Short answer: yes  Long answer: hell yes
Just leave the animals alone. Simple.
faka kylian
Why are the avocados and bananas stuck at the harbour?
Unfortunately the moment I read the title I knew almost exactly what was going to be said. The current narrative demands this particular stance, and the very dodgy chart that was shown at around the 9 minute mark was clearly skewed, as can be seen by the number of comments pointing to it. Given that it is so very easy to skew numbers that most people wont go and research it throws into question every single thing said in this video.
even if it would completely stop climat change if just me stopped eating meat i wouldnt do it
Never gets old? Talk to someone doing hardcore bodybuilding and they'll tell you all about how eating can get real old real quick.
Drop the skill share advertisement and plug your own merch! Kurzgesagt is one of the best YouTube channels out there and I fear they are going the way of Wendover and will soon only offer click bait videos via YouTube  all in a guise to mention a sponsor. Keep your tegridy! And keep being awesome! Skip the sponsors.
Vegan beef is expensive.
Tbh I can live without chicken or pork beef ehh maybe not it wouldn't kill me tho
Plz make a video on bipolar disorder, autism and schizophrenia? :)
How much land would we need to spear if we planted moss or clovers on it?
this video doesn't talk about health hazards associated with a vegan diet, such as bones that break more easily, reduced muscle fat and increased belly fat and a lot more. Make of that info what you will.
You didn't even mention that beef is very unhealthy. Most doctors recommend limiting red meat consumption because it's not good for your health.
Read it as "Is Meth really that Bad?" at first and I was intrigued
Hello Kurzgesagt   My name is Erick and am a vegan, and maybe came with a solution that can make most people happy, not all but most people and maybe a slower incline to our carbon footprint which can help the global environment as well as possibly create new job opportunities and deprive others on their careers . As a vegan I am upset that we all can't be vegans but to each their own. Anyway, my solution is that what if the world became vegan/plant based for a total of 9 months and then during the last 3 months (where most holidays occur) anyone can consume the meat they prefer in portion of 150+ lbs of animal protein per person but since the decline of consumed livestock (this also includes seafoods) the quality of livestock increase as a reward for resisting to consume livestock.   If you are reading this, what are your thoughts, questions and opinions. I would really appreciate your feedback.
I was brought up vegetarian anyway, so I'm not all that bothered.
Meat eaters anxiously trying to find excuses... BuT liOnS tHo
Yes. It is.  Scientifically that is, Humans dont have enough acid to break down meat effectively unlike actual Carnivores. Our teeth is generally rounded and sometimes flat which is also not effective in chewing meat properly. Carnivores have very sharp teeth that allows them to rip apart meat from the skin. Lastly, as humans our instestines are bunch together along with the other vital stomach organs, also contributing to the very slow process of meat digestion. Carnivores however, have long stretched apart intestines that allow meat to flow and digest very effectively. It's why meats cause so many health issues In us Humans as years go by.. In conclusion, scientifically speaking to live the most healthiest and strongest, humans cannot eat meat. We just have the conscious power of *choice* .  Also for all those who say we need meat for protein, you can get protein from at least 15 other plant-based foods. Avocados being one of them at the stop of my head.  But.. if meats your thing because it tastes good by all means go ahead 😃
No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day? That's definitely not the case no matter which bodily pleasures you're referring to :-P
I think it's better if we just switch to mass producing and eating mealworms. And I'm not talking about whole mealworms, no no, I'm talking about dried ground up mealworms. That way, it's like protein powder. And Mealworms aren't exactly intelligent, unlike cows, pigs and chickens. There could just be a huge building with feeding that the worms live in, then once in a while a big strainer comes up and just strain the worms, wich are sent on a conveyor belt into an over where they get dried (and killed), then over to a grinder where they will be ground to a powder and then packaged and shipped of to your local store
Where does fish lie in this argument though?

This is a very good & well reasearched video that doesn't fall into the trap of oversimplifying as: "MEaT baD!"
VERY and BYND must be struggling
meh-thane
No particular technological or specific solution is valid or practical so long as capitalism, the underlying social arrangement that led to runaway climate change, is not addressed.
I'd rather Doom humanity than stop eating meat.
You know it’s a good day when Minecraft updates the same day as Kurzgesagt posts     Spelled it  kurzgesagt right
i want the cow to fart on me in the fart chamber
so basically reduce meat consuption especially beef. You can eat it just we have to cut it back a lot. Eat more low carbon footprint plants. Nothing needs to be banned. the proportions matter. Also we might need to use GMO to produce crops that can whitstand much colder climates to increase lands where we can grow crops so we dont have to cut down so many trees. Or GMO trees thats capable living in useless enviroment like artic to suck up CO2
For me I want to understand whether the impact of harvesting and processing plant foods along with the manufacture of pesticides and fertiliser not generated from animal waste products is included in the calculations stated?
My recommendation... Step 1: Skyhook for more efficient orbital access Step 2: Kick off drone-driven mining of asteroids for ice (water) and construction materials, to reduce pillaging of Earth resources Step 3: Construct orbital rotating habitats, to function as solar powered greenhouses and cattle farms. Capture emissions for reuse in space... even if no chemical use, can use as Newtonian reaction mass in engines. At the same time, these can help shade the Earth somewhat. Step 4: Reclaim land on Earth for biome restoration & conservation. Step 5: Encourage development of permanent orbital colonies, Lunar colonies, Martian colonies, and Venusian high-altitude colonies. Incentivize as a new frontier for settlement (like back in the first days of North America; they paid people to populate the territory) to drive an exodus off of Earth. Step 6: Repeat steps 3-5. There'll always be some people who refuse to leave Earth, but that's fine.  The key is reclamation, restoration, conservation, and regulating sunlight exposure to tweak the Earth's climate. At the same time it satisfies the Human drive for expansion & consumption. Greed is not a problem if you can channel it into something benign, or even useful.
If you want to eat meat, at least eat poultry or fish.
i do not care
Now if only the vegan patty is made without wheat I could actually help. Oh well, ecological destructive food it is then.
Does anyone know a good place to find out how to make an healthy plant based diet?  Thank you!
Save yourself the 12 minutes. The answer is a resounding YES.
cattle eat, cattle fart, gases are reabsorbed by plants that cattle eat. man drills pit, man gets oil, oil is burned, releasing carbon that was stored for millions of years.   same thing.
why don't they just grow meat
yup it tarrible, all ya all folks better stop eatin meat. its obvious that veggicans will live much longer than meaticans. BUT  wait plaints have feelins too so you ought not eat thems either. So maybe veggicans will need to stop eatin plaints too. Maybe they can be solarcans and live off of light and water only. I beilieve they should try.
What hit me is that converting to vegetarian diet would free an area twice the size of the U.S. and vegan diet three times! That's just nuts.
Meat is so good don't say it bad
Yeah, i will not give up beef. Nature can go hug itself.
No mention of health? Meat causes a number chronic illnesses. A whole food plant based diet is the only diet PROVEN to reverse the number one cause of death in humans, heart disease. Shouldn’t that be the default until someone comes up with a healthier diet?
Yeah i am absolutely never giving up meat
Factory farms should be using livestock to grow grassland like how Matt Damon grew potatoes on Mars 😝
People must me asking you the same question over and over cause I think this the third video you've done for this.
Kurzgesagt went full on hippie, vegan unsullied virgins so fast. It's disgusting. We all get it, can we move along with propaganda?
I'll still continue to eat my steaks.
The answer no one wants to say is; extermination of humans to solve climate change.
*EAT YOUR BUUUUUUUUUUUUGS!!!*
gamer
I need to decrease earth population to 1 Billion
Nothing get disrespected more than nature hahahahahaahaaa
In the old testament, god said to eat animals, but in the old testament, god still advocated fighting wars for holy land. The new testament suggests that eating meat is bad and ive seen several biblical references against harming or being mean to animals. I think that the words of Jesus mean that it is much less of a sin for us if we do not harm animals for food. All humans have sin, thats why we forget these things
Amazing video as always!! I'm just curious about a thing that a few anti plant-based diet people that I've met have mentioned.  Would these numbers change a lot if we considered that some animals eat some parts of the plant that humans can't digest (and would go to waste if harvested for human consumption)? Or would they stay pretty much the same?  And a different topic now, What about insects as an animal protein?  :)
I feel like this video is deeply flawed- Prior to the year 1800 there were an estimated 60 million bison in North America. Bison emit methane at similar levels as cattle. Currently in the US there are fewer than 35 million cows and less than a million bison.  That means that net emissions from bovines in north America has dropped significantly from pre-industrial levels. The fact that this was left out of the video feels dishonest to me. In the past it seemed like Kurzgesagt did a good job of trying to be fair and present a balanced view of the material covered, but this one definitely feels tilted towards a specific conclusion.
As always, as clear as possible, while not trying to oversimplify a complex question.
Is it just me or they changed the title?  I swear it was "Is meat really bad for the environment?" when they uploaded it, I might be wrong though.

Veganism is the future.
Are we gonna die or something really soon cause of climate change?
AYYY
Is there a possibility that you could make a video on molten salt reactors? I feel like that could be a great way to let people know that that's the future  for everyone.
"Fun" fact: In Poland, pastures were shelter for hundreds of plant species like orchids, carnations, mulleins, louseworts, buttercups etc. When cows were closed to farms, pastures were turned into forests or farmland. Now thanks to this, 30% of polish flora are endangered species. So in Poland, the closure of cows on a farm resulted a mass extinction of meadow plants.
Beef is simply an extremely efficient use of land for food. Non arable land can be used to provide food, it costs far less actual usable fresh water, virtually everything about cattle make them an exceptionally efficient use of our land currently.
Forgetting Regenerative Agriculture and Ecosystems Farming! The emissions from fertilizers and deforestation can be greatly reduced!!! Also forgetting diversification of protein sources! Instead of just beef, chicken and pork, what animals of the local ecosystem can we include in our diet?
Me as a vegan watching this:)
Nice Vegan propaganda! Most of your sources are antimeat. What a joke this channel has become!
straight up the best content on youtube
I'm glad I love chicken more than beef.
Nice informative video, but I am very disappointed Kurzgesagt did not make any mention of lab-grown meat, which would nullify (at least, I would imagine so) most downsides.
Disliked
Thanks for touching on the transportation problem. I hear that argument a lot. The whole buy local gripe. I did research on that myself years ago. Depending upon how local stuff is distributed, there are efficient ways of doing it, but the common farmers market is so bad you might as well put your grapes or lettuce on a private airplane and send it to the other side of the planet. Its stupifyingly bad. Transportation of food across the globe is insanely efficient.
And God said, “See, I have given you every herb that yields seed which is on the face of all the earth, and every tree whose fruit yields seed; to you it shall be for food. Also, to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life, I have given every green herb for food”; and it was so. Genesis 1:29‭-‬30  In The Beginning He Already Decided What Good For Us   Hare Krsna
i think its gonna be big some filter machines be working in the future. transforming unwanted air to wanted stuff. people will never give up what they like or how they profit. at the end point of humanity, everbody will be working together(!). but untill that time nothing will change
No thanks Bill Gates. I will not eat the bugs.

The main reason to not eat meat is ethics. The same phenomenon that makes you not kill other people or steal.  The same ethics should apply to all sentient beings
I'm impressed the vegan teacher did not comment on this video
how about we decimate 40% of the world so that we will have less humans to feed so that we can keep trees?
Man should’ve talked about the link to aging and too much meat consumption. That’s why I switched. I’m only 20 but I’d rather look 25 when I’m 30 than the other way around
(Dislike) If your video about the nutrition of meat was wrong, this video is wrong.
What if we started hunting our food again like our ancestors?
Why don’t we all grow our own and eat chickens we keep, eegs too!  Also people are still going to eat that beef burger ….
The problem we face with carbon has very little to do with our eating habits, and far far more to do with the huge number of people we're feeding.  There are too many humans. The most positive thing you can do for the world is to have two or fewer children. Don't expand your family's footprint. Maintain or reduce it. If we all do that, ALL of these environment problems go away. As well as a lot of other concerns.
I wish I could see the dislike count on this.
One meal a day is the solution. We dont need to eat more than one meal and one meal will actually make us live longer. One vegan meal a day is the ultimate combo. You can even survive eating every 72hrs which is hard but that will save even more resources. Our body is more efficient than you think
Conclusion of the video.  Stop eating meat. Except a healthy diet specific to you isn't by choice. Everyone is different and how your body handles certain food isn't a one size fit all. Some people can be healthy on mostly vegetables, others not so much and their health deteriorates. For example, there is a woman that was diagnosed with a life altering diagnosis ( I forget her name) and when switching to 100% meat it literally went away. Yes it's been medically proven for her case. Again, one diet doesn't work for everyone.  So to just slam veganism on everyone is not an answer. Take your fairy tail future story elsewhere. I've been seeing this trend more often these days when I've already got some knowledge on the subject of the video before hand so I'm noticing BS more often with you guys.  I'm gone.
"And food never gets old." Eh... I could go a week without having to feed myself constantly.
thx
We would be better off with a lower overall population. Earth isn't getting any larger, it's pointless to grow for the sake of growth, much better to have fewer people with higher quality living standards for us, and also the other life forms that we share this planet with. We can use the opportunity to breed for desirable traits as well.
when you seen that Kurzgesagt accepted money from the bill and milinda gates foundation.... propaganda!
But doesn't the plantbased food that's shipped from wherever to here also have to be transported by a truck from the harbor to the store?
Vegan rant coming. Vegan diets are not scientifically controversial at all, both the US and UK dietetic associations say a well managed vegan diet is perfectly safe for all stages of life, including adolescence and breast feeding. Given that, why eat meat? If the answer is cultural and taste one must ask oneself if those are good enough reasons to damage the climate so heavily (even ignoring the ethical dilemma which for me is greater). If I told you I kill animals because I like the sound they make (sensory pleasure), you’d think me a monster. If I tell you I kill animals because I like the way they taste (sensory pleasure) that seems to be ok. For me this is flawed logic. I fully understand a vegan diet is not possible for everybody’s circumstances. But almost all western people can safely and affordably convert to a vegan diet.
the music reminds me of plats vs zombies, love it
Wouldn't be a Kurzgesagt video without leaving you sad and pushing you further into depression
Hate me or not, but I've been eating meat for 23 years and I will continue doing so
Let's not forget the exciting developments in lab-grown meat! If that technology matures into something scalable, we might be able to have our cake and eat it, too. Lab-grown meat is significantly less resource intensive because a steak is grown as a steak, not part of an animal. This is especially important when that animal makes so much methane!
Stonks
does anyone actually think capitalism will let us reduce meat production?
i've thought about fixing these problems with technology, we dont have to keep raising animals how we have been, in large, inefficient, open fields. instead, have factory farms, possibly vertically stacked, with the methane produced being collected, and the space freed up being used to grow animal feed, reducing space used to raise animals, reducing pollution, *and* now producing methane which can be an extra form of income to pay for this change in infrastructure.
Thank you for making this very useful video, hope people will think twice before eating their next piece of meat!
Brilliant video!!! been trying to say this for the longest time ever. Haven't had meat for about 2 years now.
Here we go again: comparing the nutrition profile of beef to that of potatoes and arguing one is healthier isn’t very scientific. Try comparing beef to broccoli, barley, or beans!
How about talking about the exploitation and inherent abuse of animal agriculture for once? I'd like to hear some philosophical and rational arguments, if you can think of any
From a cold-clinical point of view given the information presented the optimal solution seems to lock all the animals away in sealed environments, this serves two important factors, it A reduces energy use, thus increasing meat/calorie efficiency, in turn reducing overall emission/calorie expenditure, and B allows us to capture all of the methane excreted by these animals before it can escape into the atmosphere and damage it.  As an added bonus all this extra methane can be reused later for another product, the only real downside here besides the irrelevant ethical one is that concentrating animals together in such close quarters leads to an increase transmission of bacteria and viruses, which means antibiotics become less effective due to increasing mutation of said viruses/bacteria.

haven't gone fully vegan yet but yeah, vegan is the way to go.
no, isn't
This is misleading, bordering on misinformation. Please, if you are genuinely interested in how you can help combat climate change, watch 'What I've Learned' 's video about eating less meat. I will link this video in an attached comment below.   Kurzgesagt, people look to your channel for unbiased, informed, evidence-based information. Please take a moment to consider the harm your video may be contributing; misrepresenting how we may achieve progress in the fight against climate change.
It seems like all the YouTube channels I watch are convicring me to go vegetarian.  On purpose or otherwise
a farmer in Canada recently discovered that feeding his cows a special type of red seaweed which is widely available and can be farmed reduced his cows carbon emissions by 80%
Something that  wasn't covered is the high amount of carbon that pastures remove from the atmosphere by just existing/growing, which offsets the carbon created by the ruminant animals.  I've seen interesting stuff on "carbon negative" pastures in ted talks.
I guess this channel is going downhill and becoming sloppier. Some of the things that are with this video:  The transport calculation is plainly wrong - avocado coming from a container would still go through several dispatching centers before reaching the store, thus still traveling a significant amount of road.   In the best case scenario, that cost would be higher.  Second, effects on carbon soil capture due to grazing animals (grass root systems) are not being taken into account, and that alone would make pasture-raised beef barcon neutral (if not slightly negative).  Third, the comparison by protein content, while well-meaning (I hope) is misleading.  Some nutrients cannot be get from vegetables (heme-iron, zinc) so if you really want a beef-to-vegs comparison you should adjust for bioavailability of both micro and macronutrients.    Please improvise a bit less next time.
I think you should make a video about cats.
Good news is chicken was always my favorite meat, so I can sacrifice a burger every now and then.
Humans can't live on a vegan diet
9:20 - 9:35 Ok so 50 billion tonnes per year, that's 5 trillion tonnes over those same 100 years that 800billion tonnes could be removed (should be a much bigger graph, not a smaller one lol!) So doesn't this mean that by sparing those 3 billion hectares of land, as a vegan diet would permit, we would only cut our CO2 emissions down by less than a 6th - still emitting 42 billion tonnes per year? Which is 4.2 trillion tonnes over 100 years? (800 billion /100 years = 8 billion/year. 50 billion - 8 billion is 42 billion) Anything is better than nothing, but I'm just trying to maintain the proper perspective.
You want to make a difference to climate change? Don't reproduce and stop buying shit you don't need.
i do feel like it should have been mentioned that feed dont compose entirely usable human-consumable resources  ie: the green part of ears of corn or the wheat skin
Making veg taste like meat is really really important
bird in a cow fursuit
What about fish?
😁
We don't eat that much beef anyway in my Country. Mostly pork and poultry
Don't go vegan, or even vegetarian, start by cutting down on meat, do you eat it every day? Start having one or two meatless days a week. Do you already have those? Add one more. If you think you can handle it, have meat once a week.
vegetarian food is the food my food eats
If there's one channel that I'd never unsubscribe, it's kurzgesagt . Totally love your videos
I honestly appreciate the facts and arguments made, although I really hate them as I do love my steaks and burgers. You are right, and I have nothing in hands besides „ok, so I shall reduce“
If meat kills me faster ill gladly keep eating it so i can be done with this shit (for legal reasons that is a joke)
9:45 there is a cell on a plate, lmao
X de e r e
You've already made at least one "You should feel morally bad if you eat meat" video, how many more are you going to make? Just out of curiosity.
No mention of well-managed grass (pasture) sequestering carbon and methane??   Really???
This video made me crave some beef
6:24 - The only time my country is cited in a Kurzgesagt video is to mention how bad it is at protecting rainforest. I hate what the rich land owners are doing to my country.
kurzgesagt: literally named in a nutshell also kurzgesagt literally every episode: its complicated
Kurzgesagt: making a clear point that meat sucks Comment section: there is this one graph though
With regenerative agriculture the beef is carbon negative... big miss
This title is clickbait, should be isn't eating plants bad.
So the solution would mainly come from having less people on Earth, and political courage from our leaders to make the right tough choices to transform our industry at global scale. Well... shit.
wrong coooming is superior
Because of your videos on climate change and meat emissions, I haven’t had any red meat in 9 months! Aside from one time I accidentally ate ham thinking it was turkey… I haven’t stopped thinking about it since…
H E C T A R E S
Issues with clear right or wrong answers are always framed as "complicated" when it requires someone give up privilege. It was that way with slavery, and it's that way with eating meat. The only thing "complicated" about it is that the people with the power to change it _don't feel like doing it._
Nice video but you didn't touch on the main reason why people aren't vegan: vegan food is fucking disgusting.
Really hate that we can’t see dislikes
Not gonna lie I love chicken and steak and not gonna stop eating meat any time soon.
The comparison between local and long-distance transport was not fair. The efficiency of maritime transport can only be invoked if the destination is exactly the location of the port. In all other cases, the emissions of local transport add to the emissions of long-distance transport. So L + l >> l.
You forget what types of protein do to the human body and male and female bodies
Previous videos. Vehicle emissions is a large part of the problem. This video. Vehicle emissions is at most 2% of the problem.  .................You wonder why this gets argued about all the time.
A like to this comment is a dislike to the video.
Eating meat is arguably one of the most idiotic things we are doing as a species.  We weren't originally evolutionary designed to eat other animals and just because we figured out we could doesn't mean that was the natural order of human evolution.  Case in point.  You can take any human on the planet blind folded to a fruit orchid and they'll recognize they are in the presence of food.  Now take the same blind folded human to a pasture of animals and there's NO biological trigger that food is present.  I could make this comment into an entire article but I'll leave on this note.  Humans are ultimately going to be the reason we become extinct.....and I would imagine the rest of the planet can't wait either.
Thanks for your amazing work!
But why can't we focus on the other 74% of the emissions instead of part of a part of 26%
the truth is Thanos was right
Bruh  The amount of people coping in the comments is staggering
i love you kurzgesagt!
I’ve started switching from beef to chicken. It doesn’t solve much but I’m just experimenting to see what it would be like
I personally find veggie burgers (the less expensive and actually healthy ones, not Beyond meat) to be much more delicious than plain meat. Plain beef isn't very flavorful on its own without sauce/spice.
Avoiding the non controversial topics I see.
I think that people are tackling this problem all wrong. If we're trying to reduce carbon then why don't we cultivate organisms that dispose of it naturally like algae? Since algae is a water based organism we won't have to worry about utilizing our limited walking space.
i have ordered the book immuun but i stil don’t have it i live in the netherlands so can some 1 explain
Carbon emission is a nonsense. Climate change is a lie.
Hey, wait, what about fish?
Trash
I'm vegan because it's trending vs I'm vegan because i know the math.
Question: Would it be possible to create a machine that if released in the atmosphere could filter oxygen and suck up the CO2 and Methane?
I think once lab made meat gets popularized and commercialized food carbon emission will decrease by A LOT.
I love how he says Hectares
I love this video. It shows the facts that both speak for and against meat and shows it benefits and shortcoming.  I really like that they took so much into account and didn't just focus on one aspect. Love it
You will eat much less meat. Remember.
Just stop: 1) Reproducing 2) Eating any animal And Start 1) Spreading Silence 2) Education And ask yourself- Why we fail to love the nature? And at higher level- why we fail to see the same source of life inside all living beings?
It is not bad.
At one point in time someone decided to measure the amount of methane coming from a cow.
Appreciate there's a lot of context and complexity to the argument on meat's impact on the climate. For me, it's purely down to all animals having a right to life and us having made so much progress in meat replacements that I just can't do it anymore. Spent 28 years of my life devouring meat cause it's fucking delicious. But last year and a half, it's been so easy to go veggie (eventually will do vegan). So many replacements, I don't feel like I'm truly missing anything. Maybe it's just me.
pov: you consider turning vegan
1kg of beef would keep you alive for more time than 1 kg of potatoes... yeah.. i don't think it works that way.. people are eating beaf every day not just because its gud nutrition and necessary for survival.. but most of the time it's just because of its taste.. and that means.. they'd b eating 10s of kg beef in a month.. but if they eat double of that in terms of potatoes in that month they can still survive.. and enjoy a gud meal.. and that's the difference.. eating beef is not necessary for your survival you eat it just because it tastes gud and make yourself obese in process while vegetarian diet will keep u full and provide u with all the necessary nutritions.. but you'd never want to eat that just because it doesn't taste as good to you as meat beef chicken does..
In the next episode:  Are vegetables really that good?
I'd be more interested in a comparison of things like chicken and lettuce. The choices in this video are the extremes. Also is the difference in wastage accounted for? Meat products are wasted at half the rate of vegetables.
Thanks, I was waiting for a good debunking of that video by WIHL!
now factor in micronutritional value and bioavailability. vegan people tend to be frail and die sooner, both now and historically. the drive for lower meat is the drive for the return of the slave diet.
Fuck the world I'm still eating meat
Thank you @Kurzgesagt for the free month trial of skillshare. I will be using it to learn American Sign Language and dance classes. Thank you.
Most humans in the "developed" world would literally rather DIE than give up natural meat. Let's just accept that the species is in decline due to climate change (and multiple other reasons), and enjoy what we have left. Humans cannot stop Climate change.

I know no one is going to read this but- 1. These guys explained how individual acts like not eating meat have no effect on the climate, unless meat was literally banned on earth it would make no difference. 2. Green spaces in non-natural areas like southern California or the SW in general cause more carbon then all the cars in the world COMBINED- ban lawns in deserts-easy Ban meat on earth- pointless
carbon carbon carbon it's always about carbon
At the end of the day what you're basically trying to preech is turn in to vegan -the fucking-hell-nah buddy!
So the few rich people can eat beef and the pleps may eat plants? Or do we rather need reduce worlwide population numbers FAST.
dont forget that we actually feed livestock with mostly waste products from plant farming like corn husks in America, and in I think, soya bean sheels which are inedible for humans, can be fed to cattle
Just a hypothesis for thought- if the population is lesser in future (due to people producing lesser babies) and people on an average consume lesser (as opposed to just needlessly stuffing and become obese and/or due to greater proliferation of diet based research and education), then maybe we can reduce the environmental impact of food, especially food impact on greenhouse gasses.
NOOOO NOT THE BEEF STONKS
I have a feeling that the elite of this world just want us to back away from nature more and more. And go to a more of a fake/virtual/dystopian world. This story fits that’s narrative perfectly! How about stop cutting big portions of trees and go back to nuclear energy? Or is there still a lot of fear mongering around that topic?
I'm genuinely curious as to how many people would need to be vegan for the 3 billion hectares of land.
✨ chunky duck✨ love it
Okay, Youtube, help me out here. The video gave us the following facts,  1) If everyone went vegan and there was no eating meat, that would free up 3 billion hectares of land.  2) If we then converted all of that land to CO2 'eating' plants, that saves 800 billion tons of CO2 in 100 years (or 8 billion tons per year).  3) We emit 50 billion tons of CO2 per year right now.  4) Early in the video, they said 26% of greenhouse gases come from food production, with beef being the highest producer.  5) I could not find if they said exactly how much CO2 all animals produce, but estimating based on the food graph, it looks like all meat makes up around 70% of the gases produced by food.   If I math that, 26% of 50 billion tons a year is roughly 12.5 billion tons. And if 70% of that is from meat, that's roughly 9 billion tons. If the whole planet went vegan, we would have a 9 billion ton reduction in CO2 emissions. But then all those calories would have to be made up by plants. It seemed like there was roughly a 10x difference in gases released by calorie, so that would add about 1 to 2 billion tons of gases back. The new food would need land, but since there is currently farmland growing plants to feed livestock which wouldn't be needed, we'll call it even and say that same land is now making people food. Alright, then if all that land now available from no livestock was turned to forest of grasslands, that would further suck up another 8 billion tons a year. So our overall CO2 emissions drops from 50 billion tons to 35 billion tons, which is a little less than 1/3 of all current emissions.   Is that enough to make a difference? They talked about our "carbon budget" at 1:45, it seems like saving 15 billion tons of CO2 a year gets us about another 25 years. Did I do that (mostly) right?
I don't care if it is, will continue eating it.
But, how about lab grown meats? It is possible, just not jet alowed on the markets. Wouldnt that have significaly less co2 emissions?
Ok then I will only eat fish, what are fish farms fed with?.... corn, soy, and vegetable oils   dammit :(
For someone like me eating meat is okay as long as the animal said meat came from didn't suffer
In the first 30 seconds: “One of the most delicious foods, meat…” Why is meat delicious?? Spices (plants). Take away the seasoning and nobody would eat that nasty crap. Who here sees a living animal and starts salivating with hunger? Roadkill? How about raw flesh at the grocery store? That smell ALONE is atrocious! Now think of fresh produce. Cut up some strawberries, bananas, pears, melons, lemons… those aromas are enticing, right? I’ve paused this video to write this but I can already tell I’m going to have to hit pause again soon. This channel has jumped the shark.
the soy milk's making a soy face!
just eat vegan meat, in a couple of years its going to be cheaper and tastier than real meat.  You can have all the fast food you wont with a bit better health.
oh to be the kurzgesagt animator who animated a cow violently ripping ass inside a fart-o-meter
Finally you are back
We really need to devote more money to researching and developing synthetic meat production.
Funny you say that, I saw a stick of beef jerky the other day and I fornicated with it.
Still won't do much we need to get rid of mass manufacturing and cut down on the population over time because even if you go 100% vegan with possibly 10 billion people by 2100 we will still have too many people for the planet to support.
So the facts support plant-based diet and concius consumer decision-making. Nice :)
Theres a lot wrong with this video
You can’t even convince a small group of people to stop producing huge emissions from generating low-quality pictures of monkeys how is anyone going to convince the world as a whole to switch off of meat?
I would just like to point back to your video in September.
meat can be created in labs...the flavor can too...Let's stop being fkin lazy.
I was really hoping you would talk about the carbon footprint of lab-grown meat. I understand it's a relatively small and insignificant portion of the market right now, but that could start changing pretty radically over the next 4-5 years. It would be nice to know if it is significantly better than the traditional ways of making meat.
It would be interesting to know if those studies account for the amount of CO2 that is being absorbed in the the process of producing the meat.
5:00 Someone should calculate the methane emissions from humans. I'm sure that it would be much more than the number emitted by cows.
I wonder how much we could reduce CO2 emissions by if Vegans and Vegetarians disappeared instead of cows.
One factor that wasn't touched upon is that arable land and land useful for crops isn't distributed equally around the globe. If a country (or region) depend on trade for a large part of their food, they are at risk if anything disrupts that trade. Not all countries could even afford to import much food, and unless they let their population starve, they need to use the resources that are available to produce food.
Here's the thing: a lot of environmentalists are also sympathetic to certain animal rights causes, and there was already an anti-meat agenda based on shoddy science claiming red meat would raise your cholesterol and cause heart attacks.  More recent research has called that into question, so now the anti-meat forces have to turn to another argument.  Now, instead of meat killing you, they say it kills the planet.  We've gone from "meat is murder for animals" to "meat is murder for you" to "meat is murder for the planet."  Well sure, cramming livestock onto feedlots, feeding them an unnatural diet and pumping them full of hormones isn't good for anyone, much less the environment.  But meat doesn't have to be made that way, and wasn't until about the end of WWII.  That's one reason why our ancestors lived perfectly long and healthy lives eating lots of red meat and didn't destroy the Earth by doing so.  If we just go back to humane, natural ways of raising livestock, then all of the supposed health and environmental risks of eating meat will go away.
I'm going to be eating more beef the amount of calories per weight and the quality is too good for me to pass on. I do obviously believe in climate change but I'm looking out for number one first and that won't ever change.
This whole video is based on the idiotic premise that each individual should consider the carbon footprint of everything they buy. If that's your strategy for combating climate change, there's a really, really high probability that you will fail. A much simpler and practically automatic solution the problem is to simply put a carbon tax on every product, and economics will take care of the rest. If the prices of different types of food at the grocer reflected their emissions in proportion to other products, beef would become much more expensive and that would automatically make people buy less of it, and buy more of other animal proteins or plant based proteins with a lower carbon foot print. No one would have to educate themselves on what is ethical, good or environmentally friendly, nor would anyone have to make personal sacrifices to satisfy their conscience, because everyone intuitively understands the value of money.
One HUGE thing you didn't cover is that for a lot of crops cattle will happily eat the parts of the plant that we don't. Soybeans and corn for example, we only eat a small part of it whereas the cows eat the leaves and stems as well.
I have a feeling fruit and vegetables should be alot cheaper than they are. But  all our money and resources are going into meat
The amount of butthurt carnists here is.... I am glad to see it.
I'm so glad they didn't sugar coat things like people usually do
i do love the content of other creatures bodies.
We as human beings are omnivores, and nothing can change that fact. I blame mother nature for causing all these emissions, and eat meat happily.
This channel always makes me feel happy that I am a pure vegetarian because people eat meat before even thinking how it would affect not only their surroundings but also everyone on earth. We kill animals for our taste bud's pleasure but we don't ever try to think that we are killing a life that also breathes the same air we breathe and stays on the same planet as us. Makes me think if we are practically cannibals.
Don't care. Not my problem. I will consoom beef and hope the planet becomes unsustainable for future generations. This world is doomed.
When you’re referring to the international transportation of food (e.g. avocados) and comparing that to local foods, do you also include internationally shipped food being transported locally afterwards?
A lot of these projections are tied to how actively and quickly we’ve developed “emerging” countries into westernized consumers. That was an environmentally unsound decision made by politicians, big corporations, and the quotidian bozos whom they duped for support on moral grounds. I never asked Billy Boy to go play Medicine Man for alien populations with enormous reproduction rates. Anyone who’s got a problem with environmental sustainability projections, take it up with him. Dont get between me and my grass fed burgers.
The container ship veggies v. trucking meat comparison seems a bit misleading, when those veggies arrive at port they've still got a long truck ride to get to the Williamsburg Wal-Mart.
First off great video, loved it.  Secondly, I ask this as someone who loves meat, as someone who has visited wet markets in China and still eats meat, is their really no alternative?  Also, as a side note, you didn't mention the over-arching social political problems with stopping deforestation in general.  Even though first world nations need that land to offset our greenhouse gas production, third world nations need that land to grow their industries and to survive in a global market (if you need examples look specifically in Latin America).  I think talking about that as a whole would make a great part two (or you might have already talked about it in another video and I am forgetting it).  Anyways Cheers.
Only in 2021 can Kurzgesagt use the word 'Stonks'
Christians always say... "Well we can't blame god for him who gave us meat to eat"
Big oversight on the avocado transport vs local beef?   So when the boat reaches the land, please tell me how it gets to store/or homes? Is it the same types of transport as the local beef?...
You can't stop me.
Grown food goes to animals as feed  because its not for human consumption
in regards to climate change in general  the annoying thing is its not even a lot of peoples fault. its big corps who dont care and wont be held accountable by governments. people are tired of their shit but it doesnt matter because the general public cant force them to change. we can try, and it'll help, but only to a point. massive changes start with the people who made the problem in the first place.
Zero discussion of entomophagy is kinda a huge oversight
I heard that methane from cows should be weighed differently than co2 from coal/oil. Because that methane is part of a cycle anyways (air - rain - grass - cow - air) and would end up in the air eventually anyways. But other sources of emissions are dug up from deep under the ground where it would usually stay burried for thousands of years.  Would love to see an analysis on that by Kurzgesagt!
yeah nah sorry climate, till we get some good and cheap lab grown meat ill be enjoying my burnt cow.
Great video. So instead of asking India to stop its coal led economic growth, the world can learn from Indian dietary habits 😀
I eat the chicekn
I'm going to go buy a Bigmac, Double whooper with cheese then go to Texas road house for a steak dinner.... 😆 🤣 😂
I had a little bit of a deja vu at the beginning before I realised I already watched this video on the German channel.
Great vídeo, but it Will be greater if You talk about alternative protein sources. Like insects for example. I know vegan life sounds great because we Will be using plants instead of "kulling animals (cries in vegan)".  But a fact is ,that we don't have What it takes (like rumiants) to have a completely plant-based diet. Our anatomy just can't do it. We don't have the same adaptations as monogastrics like rabbits or horses.
You inspired me to be vegan lol
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
One thing worth pointing out is that the emissions from cow farts are part of the carbon cycle and thus irrelevant. The carbon gets captured by plants and fed to cows once again, it's a cycle unlike fossil fuels.
Could you do a big video of what you would like to do to our world and future space travel if you had unlimited money and didn't have to worry about Governments. Like how we would get to a type 2 and 3 civilization all in one video. Basically what we should do from now to be the best species possible.
This is an extremely simplified, skewed view, leaving out a large number of facts that oppose the initial argument.
In India we worship cows and so we don't kill them. We are practicing it from ages. In our culture cow is metaphor for earth. It means that if you're killing cow you are killing earth.
There is so much wrong with this video. From outright erroneous or irrelevant information to completely ignoring the carbon cycle.
Meat is death
I'm surprised you didn't go into the viability of fish farming, because while beef is basically the worst thing ever, I wonder what the impact of large-scale fish production would be, especially given that we still don't really have a clear picture of its impact on global ecology yet.
Thanks for the data, this made me want to eat a great T bone. Cheers
What about the nutritional differences between the various items shown? There was a brief mention of nutrient density, but what nutrients? Can an individual get all those nutrients they are missing from the plant based alternatives, or is there a need for a complete change of diet to ensure the inclusion of the nutrients missing?
going to keep eating beef
Do w*stoids really eat beef every day? Where I live in the balkans, steak is eaten only on very special occasions while the "bad cuts" and remainders are eaten sparingly and usually mixed with pork. The vast majority of people eat meat only at lunch and some even follow orthodox fasting which might on some days be vegetarian, vegan, fish allowed etc. Our ancestors didnt really eat meat every day and I suppose you should do the same if youre really concerned about climate change
9:31 why compare something over 100 years with a  yearly value. Over 100 years it would be 800 billion removed, and 5000 billion emitted. Be professionals, your channel should not be propaganda, it should be informative. I believe in the message, but i dont like your ways.
Your sources arent very good for this video. Some of the things they dont consider in their paper:The livestock breathing, the land deforested for livestock, the transportation of livestock and their feed. These are just a few that arent being considered.   Whats the point talking about a topic if youre going to cherry pick the data...
I appreciate this great video, and we should all do our personal best to fight climate change at home. However, beating climate change will only happen with systemic change, so remember this information when it’s time to vote.
Why dont we start eating humans instead of beef, wouldnt it be better?
Thanks for the great video!
soooo.... kill all the cows? oO
Although I do believe most people should have a mostly plant diet, and I believe animals should be pasture raised, I have to ask.. why, with all of your research, have you not addressed the question of methane released by cesspools??? Every time vegans talk about methane and cows, they only ever talk about burps and farts, almost like they're deliberately ignoring the main things that could genuinely challenge their beliefs.
What about lab grown meat?
3:51 _Let's steak with beef_ I see what you did there
I wonder if growing parts of cattle and other animals in food lbs rather than whole animals would help emissions. That and you won’t get sick from it as it would be isolated from the outside sort of like plant factories. In time perhaps.
I think a video on the topic of speciesism would be really interesting and discussing the moral side of our use of animals in general!
While I don't disagree on anything in this video, it doesn't cover the health costs of a meat free diet. While being vegan may work for a minority of the population, humans need meat to be healthy. It gets a bad rap because it is conveyed as a burger from a fast food joint which is by far the most unhealthy version of beef, but a steak with some butter is the healthiest, nutrient dense meal a person could ask for. (Generalizing for simplicity, I know some people can't eat red meat for one reason or another.) Also, how much more farm land would we need if everyone became a vegan? They are not nutrient dense, so we would need a a lot more of it.
I'm really tired of everyone telling me that all the bad things in the world are my fault, that I'm oppressing people and polluting the atmosphere and it's my personal responsibility to change those things. I didn't ask to be a part of any of this, didn't ask to be raised on a meat fed diet, didn't ask to have white colored skin. I literally just want to be left alone, read my books, play my games and enjoy the short amount of time life offers. The implication that I owe everyone my very best effort to improve their lot in life (because it's my fault) when nobody is doing the same for me is rage inducing. What's even worse is having an opinion like this makes me, apparently, an even more horrible person.
I don't have kids, and I don't own a car. I feel fine in eating all the meat I want.
Here fishy fishy fishy..... what about fish?
I feel it's not fair to leave out the calculations that for example in the United States 52 % of all fruits and vegetables go to waste, but only about 22 % of meat.
Lit emoji lit emoji lit emoji
Overpopulation it is .. again
They gotta start plugging up cow booty holes ☠️
Go Vegan!
I wish this video would've addressed the fact that cows mainly eat byproducts of crops like wheat, corn, and soy, which would've gone to waste otherwise.
You forgot to account for the healthcare costs and productivity decrease of a vegan or vegetarian society... Do more reasearch next time guys because I don't see any real vegan olympic gold winner
K. So the issue I always have with these analyses is they fail to account for the natural emissions of equivalent activity. Buffalo vs cows for instance. We can and should do grass fed beef but when we say that areas like the southern and western great plains are suitable for things other than herd animals and then pretend that these activities represent new emissions we are lying to ourselves. Slash and burn in Brazil is one thing but this is a little silly.
Decimate 2050
The fact is that we make too much food. We could down scale production alot without changing our diet much at all but that's bad business for corporate giants. Profit is everything and they gain alot from over production. These carbon emissions that are destroying our planet is directly linked to our political economic system. Capitalism.
Me: sees video Me: I’ll eat beef anyway  Me:when lab grown beef comes around I’ll switch to it completely
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times everyday and never gets old"......my right hand disagrees with you
Short answer: no  Long answer: no it’s not
So, we are all going to die🤷‍♂️
You are wrong about pigs they eat anything and everything pigs will eat other pigs compost chicken any vegetable or fruit grain a rotted corpse pigs don't give a shit what they are fed
Meat yummy though
I personally, I wish  what will find a industrial way to produce lab grown meat, to make this meas as normal day dish, and the real meat for the special events like christmas, birthday, wedding. Because personally I love so much the taste of meat to renounce that.
Do you make vidio about brown dwarf star
Well yes I made my choice, I'm now a omnicarnivore
"Best thing about being alive"- that's why people have most biased opinions. You don't need meat and i'm living proof, and i'm stronger than all of my friends i didn't become tho, i always were but im healthiest as i ever were, so are my 60yr old mom, she shocked nutrition experts with better blood picture than theirs... And stop nonsense, best thing about life is being alive, as depression is disease so the opposite can become happiness, you can be happy from no reason, enlightenment best part of life, not food. who are we to dare to judge if other beings are worthy of living they natural way of live, not imprisoned and not tortured???
I hope this helps someone watching to stop eating meat
Lab-grown meat and vertical farms using solar concentrators to capture waste sunlight from city rooftops to light and power themselves and their surrounding neighborhoods are the only long-term way forward as far as I can tell. Take cold, CO2-rich air from the top of the building, pull it down while heating it and having the plants take up the CO2, eject it at ground level as a bubble of balmy, fresh air that surrounds the building. Probably also have a counterdraft taking air from underground and sending it up to expel the remaining waste heat at the top of the building, or in cold areas maybe a citywide central heating network fed by waste heat from the farms and other industry. Put a park and high-class restaurants around it, sell excess generated power (there'll be a lot since most of the building's light is provided directly by the sun). Bam, food production, town square, lots of power generation, citywide thermal management, and significant air quality management all in one spot.  Massively reduce the amount of energy the city needs to expend to cool its buildings by reducing the sunlight that falls on places where people don't go while also using that sunlight to grow food in places where a typical farm is actually just impossible, producing enough food to feed a significant portion of the city in which it's built, if not producing a surplus of food, almost totally removing the need for transportation as well as the reliance many geographical areas have on other places that can produce food. Urban areas wouldn't instantly collapse if they weren't being supported by vast farmlands.  Actually, that would be an interesting video, look at the future of hydroponic farming and what it's going to change about how we approach food.
How much money did you guys make at the start of this channel to right now?
I kind of hate that this is framed from a "rapid climate change" perspective. Climate Change is anything but rapid. Calling a 0.01% increase in CO2 over 150 years rapid, is obnoxious.  Before someone says it's actually a 50% increase, from 280-415ppm, I already know. It's still only 0.028%-0.041%. Statistics, am I right?  If CO2, methane, etc. are too negligible to actually matter, it makes for a very weak argument for ending animal slaughter. There's plenty of other reasons to stop.
9:33 that's a weird way to put these numbers. Did you mean 800 billion per year for 100 years? Or did you mean 8 billion tonnes per year?
ate a whole 15oz pack of beef sticks watching this
Then please why is plant based diet so expensive compared to normal diet
100% agreed that not all people will be vegan but people are getting more aware of these things especially those who love animals and care for the environment and ofc their health cuz just knowing that there is a diet that can be very healthy with more benefits than the omni diet so I think it's important to spread the word even if you can't go vegan, be sure that there are ppl how to have the courage to value animals and the environment and ofc their health
9:15 Wrong. If the world turned vegan, the land used for pasture would have to be, somehow, converted into crops for all the plant eating necessary to live. You have to eat a much bigger volume of plants to even try to compensate for all the loss of nutrition when cutting the beef. Not only to say that people would start to literally and have deficiencies because a vegan diet is impossible to sustain for long periods of times.
Stop eating, save the planet!
Vegans pressed asf rn
Ok I'm sorry..it may be in the description, but you neglected to mention how much CO2 plants use getting from ports to stores.. They don't just teleport, and that drive is a lot further than Mr. Jenkin's farm down the street lol
I would like to know more about what effect plant-based meats have on the environment and if it's a viable, large scale replacement for the beef industry.   I've tried plant based burgers and they're really close to the real thing and if it becomes cheaper I would definitely replace the meat I eat with plant based meats. I'm expecting the taste to be so close to the real thing in a decade that there would be no real difference except maybe nutritional value.
So what could happen going forward?  One scenario: Government pressure means a poorly thought through and implemented tax on meat to discourage its over consumption. Common man deals with the lack of protein in diet and meat gets reserved for the rich (how its been historically in Europe). 70% of the worlds emissions comes from only 100 companies, producing rubber, dyes for clothes etc... Wealthy, who are invested in such companies do not want their profit returns impacted, so make sure the public demonises something the wealthy can afford to be made expensive e.g. meat.  We will still buy neon Nike shoes and live a vegan diet. Chances are most will adopt vegan ready meals that are low in nutrients due to over farming of the land and the common man ends up malnourished. The historical cycle is complete. Only one possible future out of hopefully over 13,000,000.
this video is gonna get a lot of views.
Where would we be without the meat
Aren’t grass fed cows carbon neutral since the carbon they emit was taken out of the atmosphere by the grass they eat?
pig only has 1/6 of the impact of beef.  Guess that doesn’t matter much for those eating kosher and halal.  So don’t annoy me please with telling me to go veggie.
Carful your corruption is showing
Nice video but I’ll keep eating beef while it’s available.
Okay but what about hunting, is it viable to have the people really stuck on meat to hunt for their food and keep a roughly approximate diet?
10:10 damn it, i want a burger now
“Well…it’s complicated.”  That should be Kurzgesagt’s motto lol 😆
Let me put it this way.   Either we all sacrifice together, or we die together.    I will **not** sacrifice while Bill Gates eats whatever he wants, and politicians fly in private planes everywhere.  Guess this ship is sinking.
What I'm getting from this is 'we need to develop better ways of doing a wide variety of things'. This has always been my core belief on the matter - the question of cliimate change is ultimately moot because the basic principle would still hold true if the world isn't burning, it benefits us all to find ways of doing things better and the big challenge is identifying areas where we need to do better. Safeguarding nature is one of those things currently.  The biggest change and biggest problem both is to cut down the amount of beef we eat. Make beef a once a week thing, supplement it with other kinds of meat - pork once a week, lamb once a week, chicken the rest of the time. The problem is this is a social change, which makes actually doing it hard - a large group of people will be unwilling to make this change, another large group will be unable follow through. Thus, this kind of thing would need to be a mandate, which will be hard to swallow. Maybe if it was combine with an effort to improve the culinary quality of food with a system like Blue Apron and the like. What would most be needed is to inform people of quick and easy alternatives to shoving their face full of meat and dairy.
The CO2 is a non-issure. the sun-cycle controls our weather.
I assume lab grown meat can also improve a lot
So not eat cows. Got it. It's not like it was a big part of my diet anyway. I don't think it's unimaginable to make large portion of people consume less beef when there are other meat types available. And veggie burger ain't that bad either.
Instructions unclear, chosen starvation at the best lol!
2:50 I would have liked it if you shown another bar. The body absorbs nutrients differently. For example spinach has more iron in it than beef by weight and calorie, but we absorb so little of it which is one of the reasons why vegans often get anemic. Furthermore what about our gut bacteria? There is some research saying that they play a role in things like cognitive development and mood. We can't just make cuts to foods without first seeing if it would have a negative effect (between you and me I find vegans a bit unhinged. I had an aunt who went through a vegetarian phase and she turned into a karen. when she got out of that phase she seemed much better/tolerable). I use to like Kurzgesagt videos and though you maintain your diplomacy on handling sensitive subjects like these it doesnt quite excuse you for your scientific malpractice and pushing politics whilst trying to call it science. 4:00 I think buying locally make a huge impact, not just 11% as you say. I understand why you may be accidentally using "doomsayer" data. Our science is being politicized and manipulated to fit an agenda. Yes growing rice emmits green house gases like methane, but that is not all that bad. Some bacteria NEED methane like plants need sunlight to make energy. In other words it gets reabsorbed back into the environment, breaks down, and makes the soil they live in more fertile for all kinds of methane producing plants. The methane that escapes this cycle ends up has CO2 in less than a decade but methane is 28x more worse so I say there is no harm JUST AS LONG as we are not producing TONS of methane each 8 year period. But if it is given the time to break down I dont see why we should be concerned about it. Furthermore rice use to be a wild plant mostly to feed insects and crustaceans that evolved with the plant. By removing those organisms as if they were weeds ofc things will be more out of balance. Animals like crayfish can grow in tandem with rice as they each complement each other and create an environment for beneficial plankton to thrive in and their 'denning' behavior along with plankton in the waters producing O2 can control the numbers of methane producing bacteria so it doesnt get out of hand but not so far as it would kill the rice. 70% of the oxygen we breath come from plants like seaweed to rice and not the inland plants like trees (which TBH are more of a carbon sink than an oxygen producing machine).  If we farmed caring about the enviornment more and not just to make harvesting easier for farmers I dont see why we cannot greatly reduce the CO2 footprint of our food. Why keep up the same ineffective farming practice even if we reduce its scale? Nobody wants a reduction or prices to go up because we are forced to produce less. We have an opportunity to produce more while also lowering the impacts of climate change just as much as cutting back, if only we change our methods of farming and harvesting... That should be the worlds solution Kurzgesagt. Not these dystopia future where we poison our planet by the inefficient way we farm and we just say "well, we have to make even MORE cuts to what we grow. Hope youre all fine with eating nothing but potatoes". I am sure people would rather start wars to cull the population than just shut up and obey the master that tells them they can only eat so few varieties of food.
One more thing about the Amazon Rainforest, we have in Brazil a really poor land and pasture management. So when a big farmer expand into the forest, not only he's cutting down hectares of very important forest but he's also unprepared to reuse that land and some cases the land isn't fitted to crop as Kurzg said. Leading the cattle further and further into the forests :(
Use me as a dislike button,  (I liked the video, fuck youtube)
yall really need to find some new content
no mention of health concerns of eating vegan burgers?
I think we are forgetting about something:  *F I S H*  E: come to think of it, probably its emissions are pretty high due to transportation and cold chains
Lol, if we limit human population to few millions - co2 emissions will be resolved
I don't know man. I recycle all the time when given the option, use public transport, and release as little carbon as possible. But becoming vegan is something I'll never do. Why should I consume less meat when what I eat won't even matter compared to a handful of companies and a few countries still be responsible for more than half of the emissions today?
vegan meat tastes like shit tho and is way more expensive
beef stonks
Yeah, no, I will keep eating meat. I can't fill myself up with plants.
This video is so biased...
This is an important video. We need people to change their diet if we're going to have a future. Thank you for making this.
Well this video isn't going to stop me eating meat... Guess I'm turning to cannibalism now
what about feeding farm animals on mealworms instead of soy?
Please don’t look at the CO2 emissions only but all and especially Methane emissions.
I used to eat probably more beef than most. A steak atleast once a week, burgers all the time, tacos, it was a lot. Then I completely cut out beef in summer 2020 and it's been great. Beef alternatives are great and since I still eat chicken I never have to worry if where I'm going I'll be able to eat.
I like this clime change videos but man, when u go to tell this to nestile, meet companys, apple, tesla, big oil and coal companys,... And so on then we might actually do something. Cuse now it looks like we will suffocate, burn, or freeze, in abouth 2, 3 generations or so. To me it is no problem cutting some of this stuff off,thees animals get treated like garbage anyway.
Everything was true here, but not about Brazil. Brazil is by far the cleanest economy on the Planet.
sale asadio y pollo broster
With so many alternatives that we have nowadays, it's actually not that difficult to replace our meat consumption with those. I think many people prefer to eat meat more out of habit than anything else, as I've tried many alternatives that were delicious. Admitedly, many were also horrible. I just stick with the good ones then!
Hi guys I really love your videos but I wanted to ask you if you ever made a video about agriculture you should research how to lock up carbon in the soil and what a difference that could make I would really like to know and I think it's a really good topic
Still don't eat meat as it is torture for the animals
"They" took vegan side this time!
Just go vegan, it's honestly not a huge change and did not effect quality of life at all. Most restaurants have a vegan version of whatever food they serve, and meat is expansive in general, AND tofu is delicious ✋😔👌
Video: starts Me: oh boy what will the monkey be holding today??? :D
Im hungry now
You can't measure the happiness of a cow. If you could you would see that pigs and cows do not care whether they are inside or outside. Infact, there are advanced hog confinements that have a pasture that tracks pigs coming in or out and pigs will actually prefer to stay in a temperature controlled confinement that they know will keep them safe. Very very few livestock producers actually "keep animals in tiny cages where they never see the sun" as you have pictured here but those are the only ones you ever hear about
I really hope cultured meat is relatively low CO2 and can help with this in the future.
Why are the dislikes not showing?
Sure would be nice if beef wasnt (artificially) the cheapest meat, you cant expect people to be able to change their eating habits significantly when wages are stagnant and plant based foods remain expensive and difficult to access. If we want people to eat more plant based food we have to make it affordable and widely available!! People in food deserts earning minimum wage dont have that many options, and thats got to change
so lets kill every wild animal, because they produce co2
thanks for the disinformation! i suggestion to any user who thinks my comment is inappropriate to do a self research on transport emissions especially o ships.
So conclusion: Cow Farts are increasing the global temperature level which eventually will destroy the environment and humans. Ok noted. Thanks Vegans for saving the planet! :)
Ah shit here we go again
Honestly, it really doesn't matter. People will buy/eat what they can afford. Earth be damned.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old"  Speak for yourself ^^
Id love to have one of these kinda videos more focused on commen veggie crops and how they compare
Porc is the best one... and good.
I think mentioning the sustainable hunting of Native and Indigenous people is also a thing to consider and mention and also how much meat has been added to our diet recently.
Nah
*10:10** "You can choose yourself what to do with this information."* *Kurzgesagt knows full well about subliminal messaging and yet they deceivingly animate putting down the burger as they say you can make your own decision.*  *This is actually a scientific fact. Certain actions make you prone to make specific decisions and maintain a thought process.. Almost like taking a toy away from a dog or playing with the toy in front of a child. The moment the action is committed... The other party reacts.*
The worst thing you can to for the climate is to have kids. So I feel that once you have kids you should no longer be allowed to eat meat or fly. And then leave the rest of us alone. Sounds fair.
Lets not forget that a big part of this debate is ethical and not scientific.
Meat is awesome, I could not live without meat, I tried once and I lasted like 1 week, after I came back to eating meat I instantly felt way better, stronger, not that exhausted anymore.
go vegan, the only moral choice
Nah there’s def a bodily pleasure we enjoy every day that’s better than food lol
Wait, what happened with that "No, you can't fix climate change yourself, even if you,as an individual, did everything right it would barely scrape the surface of climate change problem, and that it's actually The Big corporations and The Governments and Politicians the ones that are the most responsible for climate changing and that they are the only ones that would actually be able to make a dent to the problem of climate change, if they wanted to".
There is 1 big problem with trees... when they grow they do capture CO2 but nobody ever mentions that when tree dies it releases the same amount that was captured in its entire life (by decaying via micro organisms). Dont get me wrong, they are very important for eco system and beautifull in general but they cant solve our problems long term. On the other hand i wont cut down meet (i strongly support artificial meat if possible) while corporate scum is destroying our planet in every posible way. Main problem is that capitalism prefers short term income above all, and alternate (green) solutions are often more expensive and curently mostly ignored. In short, that 2050 carbon goal will probably be a joke...
I am wondering if switching to Bison or elk as opposed to beef would help. Personally I think both are a rather tasty alternative. But what is the methane emissions from those animals?
Just have less kids , less kids less food less food less eco damage
Just stop eating, drinking and breathing and climate change will stop.
It's really annoying that you post videos on 2 channels, but they don't reflect each other 100%. I already watched this video in German... took me 6 minutes to realize.
I think Beef-Free Diets should be promoted as much as Veggie and Vegan Lifestyles since it has the most significant Impact.
Eating meat is such a waste of energy, and space. It is also terrible to do such a cruel thing while we don't need it to live perfectly correctly. So selfish..
Really not a fan of these climate arguments that have the average citizen fundamentally changing their entire lifestyle while we ignore the fact that around 100 companies are responsible for 70-something percent of our emissions and we still run on a fossil fuel grid.
Explained beautifully..
Ngl... this is just horribly overthinking about everything, why become vegan when we can just convert to solar energy and make electric cars?
no
9:45 Why you be eating helper T cells?
Fantastic! Let's all go plant based!
whe shoul eat insects and mushrooms. Because bot of them can eat plants and produce more energy then normal meat.
nope. humans need meat simple as
I'd love to see a video on the actual consequences of climate change. Is it apocalyptic, or otherwise profoundly destructive, and if so, how do we know or predict this?
Beef stonks
It's sad that my country is still screwing our nature so much :(
In previous videos on the topic of food I was disappointed that the fact that most land used is unsuitable for crop production, and the use of cattle on native rangelands is a significant benefit for habitat maintenance and conservation, but these benefits were not discussed in previous videos. So, I am glad that they did touch on this in this video. However, they do add the stipulation that grain products are supplementally fed to cattle. Unfortunately, this is a half truth in practice.   Grain production has many different classifications for the use of different grains. Grains are graded on their quality, and poor quality grains that are not up to par for human consumption are fed to cattle. An example of this would be different types of wheat flour. The highest quality and protein grains are made into things like pasta, followed by bread, and finally pastry and baking flour which is the lowest quality wheat that is still suitable for human consumption. Grains that fall below these standards are then fed to cattle. Yes, there is land that is used to grow grain products that could have alternative use for human consumption. However, '41% of grain that is used to feed livestock' is misleading, as a significant portion of this is not high enough quality for human consumption. Grain for human consumption always goes for a higher price, so farmers will always prioritize growing human food when possible, because they make more money. However, some grain inevitably will not meet standards due to a number of factors, this is then sold for a lesser price as livestock feed.   I think there is an important differentiation to be made between different countries, and the impacts they have. Here in North America, the impact of livestock is intensively managed and studied. New and exciting technologies and strategies are implemented every year that increase efficiency, decrease environmental impact, and create a more sustainable food system. Developing countries with poor food security, education, and infrastructure make up a significant amount of the total pollution and environmental impact from ecosystem degradation, due to poor management practices. As mentioned in the video, Brazil burns areas of forest. First, to grow soy products for several years until the soil is degraded and can no longer support soy production, which it is then converted to grazing for cattle. India imports tonnes of grains to support growing populations and artificially feed cattle. The impacts of cattle grazing the North American plains is not the same as developing countries that feed poor diets that result in increased emissions (yes, I understand it is to maintain their livelihoods and feed hungry mouths, but the impact it has remains the same).  As an agronomist, I know that smart people are studying and implementing new strategies to mitigate impact and maintain ecosystems. Experts in the field are coming up with new and novel products that are safe and sustainable. Meat production is an integral part of the food system.
we're too wasteful. too much food in the wrong places.
No matter what we eat, or how much energy we consume, the human population would produce a lot less carbon if there were fewer of us. The number of humans in 1920 was about 1,912,000,000. A hundred years later it was 7,794,798,739. Some countries still have expanding populations. Rather than ask all of us to give up meat, shouldn't the countries, where the population is growing, be asked to stop having so many children? And, for feedlot beef, the amount of methane produced is greatly reduced by adding a little seaweed to the feed.
What about fish? Is it better than other kind of meat? How much does the way of production impact?
best solution is to do ye olde dutch special  to you local bureaucrats
That reminds me, I need to pick up some charcoal briquettes to grill hamburgers today!
You missed the part about “animals eat most of the soybeans” they eat all of the unusable parts not the parts we eat
Nutrition is not only protein. Also not all proteins the same. Local grass fed beef is the best bot for health and environment. Methane is part of the carbon cycle, should me be counted as an emission. Methane is produced my microbes not cows. This will happen either-way when plant mater decomposes as part of the circle. With cows the circle just runs faster. The other part of the circle the grass grows also faster with cows. All this is totally different form burning fossil fuels.
Incoming all triggered vegans to boast and tell us how they eat soy cubes for a living
4hrs in and 80k likes lmao whaaaat
Plant more trees,  And recapture the gas for commercial use… there’s a shortage of energy is there not? problem solved 🤦🏻 point to the problem and fail to analyze a logical solution. You make Amazon warehouses that span acres, there’s no reason why you can’t do the same for cattle pastures and capture emissions in a air duct.
Kurzgesagt  is accurate with concentrated information one can take seriously- .
Something overlooked by this video is that not all foods are equivalent for all people. For some people, a plant based diet makes them sicker and dramatically reduces their quality of life. It's not a black and white issue that can be prescribed a single solution. For many people the choice is a conscientious option, but for some it's an ultimatum to sacrifice themselves.  Imagine if instead of beef it was insulin: The vast majority of people don't need exogenous insulin. Even T2 diabetics can choose to manage the disease before insulin is absolutely needed. Would we just shrug and tell T1 diabetics that their deaths are necessary? Obviously this is an extreme example with radically different economics, but there's an uncomfortable truth to be seen. Any all or nothing measures will kill some people if we don't make good-faith efforts to produce alternatives. Plant-based diets are not the panacea some make them out to be and it's a slippery slope towards eugenics to argue like they are. "Beef is a luxury for me" translates into "Go ahead and die if it's a necessity for you".
Well I am vegetarian. And this makes me feel really good. I will never go non vegetarian.   If I ever find myself lost in forests. And can't find something vegetarian to eat. Then nature allows me to kill and eat. Only Because Nature allows that.   But we are no longer living in forests. And we have a Choice. So it's upto you how you wanna play.
you vill eat the bugs
Title : *ask simple questions Kurzgesagt : "Well, it's complicated"
Okay wait, so we all go vegan, free up TONS of land to plant trees, and that takes 800 Billion tonnes out over 100 years. So 8 Billion tonnes a year. We emit 50 billion tonnes a year. I don’t think that’s worth it at all IMO
Everytime I read a comment talking about holding corperations accountable I remember how any extra fines or taxes just end up being passed off onto the consumer with a price hike.
The answer is no, it’s not bad. liver’s legitimately the most nutritious food out there
I eat beef, I like beef, I eat about 3-5 steaks a week. And I have no intention of stopping for disgusting soy beans.
I'm under the belief that life must consume life in order to sustain itself. The more complex the life, the more life it needs to consume.
Be vegan
So stay as a vegan!!
We can't just look at calorie density, we're not robots consuming fuel. Their is an emotional value to food that also needs to be considered. How much happiness are you buying with those emissions?
Simple, if you want to save planet, kill humans!
idc how bad people moan about climate change im not swapping meat out for plant based foods im not no puff
reference to sheet music boss in kurzgesagt ost: the beginning  of ost are like rush b - popular piano music from piano channel SHEET MUSIC BOSS
Yes
It would be easier to have war and eliminate billions of humans who need all that food plus housing, roads, etc.
is Philipp Dettmer an vegetarian? :P
If you buy fresh from a butcher, then no. Fresh cooked meat is packed with tons of proteins and other healthy vitamins and minerals that your body has a hard time getting from plants. Don't give me that "but plants give you that too" crap, because it's simply not true. The vetgetables  and fruits we eat today are heavily modified to grow very large and seedless and therefore lack alot of the good stuff because they simply do not have the time to accumulate and develop those minerals and vitamins before getting harvested already.  50 years ago, an orange was 100 times as healthy as it is today. Simply because 1: The soil becomes less healthy and 2: because the fruits are modified as well.
Well i think its about time we all subscribe to ThatVeganTeacher. Cant wait
Some time ago I decided to reduce my meat consumption. What I was doing before was buying the cheapest, lowest quality meat from animals living in the worst conditions, just so that I could have meat as the centerpiece of the meal at least twice a day.  Nowadays, I eat meat in two or three meals per week. But if I do, I go for high quality, local products, from animals that are hopefully treated better.  And regarding the environmental impacts? Well, we rich people don't suffer much from climate change. It's the poorest people who take the brunt of the negative impacts. And I believe that, at least for now, focusing on lifting these people out of poverty, even if it causes more environmental damage in the short term, is the more productive approach.  China burns huge amounts of coal today. It also pledged to replace all personal vehicles with electric cars in a decade or so. The pollution is an ugly byproduct of this rapid technological advancement. But once you overcome this initial stage, and there is a large middle class with enough resources not to worry about their survival, they can then invest their time and effort into fixing the mess previously committed. And while some damage is irreparable, much of it can be mitigated quite quickly.  Anyway, that's just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt.
Nothing is going to make me give up meat.
Kinda wanted to see the dislike ration on this video but thanks youtube i guess
Am I really willing to keep eating meat 3 meals a day if it continues to destroy the planet? Of course I am! Note: this is not sarcasm. I am completely serious and there is nothing you can do about it
So what does the carbon footprint of a hunter who killed and processed a deer him or herself look like?  How does that stack up against plants?  I doubt you’ll garner much support for an end to eating red meat but I feel like there may be ground to give when it comes to processing your own meat.
GREAT VIDEO IDEA: Historical evolution of the partnership between man and dog!!!
What about fish? Like does catching my own fish (wild) would that be lower than going vegan? Or even catching wild animals like pheasant or rabbit and using them would that have no carbon impact?
Militant Vegans: Choose your words very carefully
'If everyone went vegan we could free up 3 billion hectares'  and what would be the point in living in such a world?
I think if we humans would make a unrealistic collective effort on reducing all of our emissions, let's say in a perfect utopia where every human being wants to save the planet , without modifying too much our comfortable lives,we could reduce maybe 50% of human emissions. I don't think we could do more than that.
I'm not giving up beef, you can pry it out of my cold dead hands
No. Quite literally the opposite. Meat is the single best thing ever for your body and for environment.
7:20 that bird at the corner better get answers
Answer: No
i love vegetables and meat
hmm... interesting...  *shoves face into half a roasted pork*
Finally something to throw back at those free range cattle hipsters.
Wanna help climate change ? Stop buying new trendy cloths every week and buy quality product and use it for long time but nah most people care about helping climate just for the because it's trendy
I can't seem to find it, but I had found a study that compared not just the GHG emissions per gram of protein, but of the viable digestibility of the protein for human consumption. Plant proteins are overall less effective per gram than animal sourced proteins. I recall that pigs ended up with a little better score than some plant sources, due in part to their eating of waste streams, but cows and sheep were still the worst emitters.
Already watched this on the german channel but good to see the differences in scripting between the two languages
I really wish Kurzgesagt would make a video on biochar! All of this is important to talk about especially because we have a carbon negative way of making better fertilizer than anything on the market (charged biochar - we really should subsidize it for farmers to use!), but methane negative in a commercially productive way isn't possible yet. So someday we'll equal out the carbon we take from the atmosphere and put in, but methane is a whole other problem.
cereal crops are not exclusively grow for livestock  they are grown for human consumption they only end up as feed stocks if they don't meet the quality requirements for food processing. cereal farmers want there crops to go towards  human consumptions as this is the most profitable outcome as it is worth more per tone but if there grain dose not  meet the requirements of the factory's that is when it ends up as animal feed. For example to make bread the wheat grains needs to have 13% protein in the grain farmers cannot guarantee that every single harvest they will get at least 13% of protein in the grain so it is good to have another uses for this gran interims of animal feed instead of it being wasted. another item many people miss from these arguments is that animals provide more than just there meat.
veganism is not the answer
3 billion hectares of land would only remove 8 billion tons of CO2 per year (In reference to the claim starting at 9:22). This compared to our 50 billion tons of CO2 equivalence omissions per year, this land is arguably not that big of an impact on climate change, as otherwise advertised in this video. Not saying it wouldn't matter, it might matter a lot, just wanted to call out that I didn't like the subtle dishonesty this video tried to sell the viewers with the size of the bars making it seem as if it would solve/greatly impact climate change. The rest of the video is great though. (I might be wrong in my analysis, please let me know if I am)
Whoa whoa whoa hopd the phone.  A graphical fallacy in a Kurzgesagt video?   09:32, states that 800 billion tonnes can be removed over 100 years, so 8 billion tonnes a year  But we emit 50 billion tonnes a year, so removing 8 billion subtracted from 50 billion is 42 billion tonnes emitted net.   The graphic makes it seem like 800 billion tonnes is a lot, but also compares one year's emissions to 100 year's removal.   All my years watching these videos and I've not had much at all to complain about or pick apart, but I'm calling this out.
I switched to primarily a pork, chicken, and fish diet when I watched Leonardo DiCaprio's documentary.
Such a good video to see while eating a whole chicken :)
Quitting meat is just like quitting any other habit.  It seems daunting and impossible at first, then you realise it was easier than you thought.  Then you wish you'd done it years ago.
Please inform me when you stop beeing an acolyte for an idiological narritive you almost certainly dont believe yourself. You actively making the world a lesser place, its absolutely disgusting.    Cow farts, exact numbers on how much methane increased the human made temperature (we dont even know how much we actually contribute to the warming, because its impossible to know...).. all the typical buzzwords from an ideologically possessed persona just so sell some merch? :(  and then the classic method at 9:34 to make it looks like that this is huge. the right way to show this would be our emission in those 79 years until 2100. it would be 3950 billion tons per year, saving 800 billion tons when everyone would go vegan, what makes you think this is actually a good idea? arrogant and hybristic are the two words that describes this nonsense most accurately.  if you would excuse me now, iam out for a nice gras fed steak and, if that wasnt already clear, iam also out of this channel. adios.
let me guess... "yes it is"
This is a vegan channel speaking to a non-vegan audience.
I ate meat for Over 30 years but Just 1-2 years ago, I reduced my meat consume almost to 0%! If I could achieve this, then *YOU* can do that too! 👍
Least not forcing people to change their way of eating meat, though I personally despise the meat industry and farmining industry, they're essencial for life of us humans, but they burn forests with the though for money, I live on Brazil, and what Kurzgesagt said it true, us brazillians are burning the amazonic forest, home of many species and how people call it "The lung of the world" (Not really, trees consume as much as they produce of O2, algaes are cool)
I mean the thing about Beef emissions, like yeah they make up a fourth of human emissions, but you also have to realize that humans don't need to have 0 total emissions to restore the balance. For centuries, humans have lived and emitted greenhouse gases through raising cattle among other things, but that didn't cause global warming. What did is when industrialization kicked in and completely swung the natural balance, making it so that there was more emissions than being absorbed by plants. If we simply strive for low-emission beef, while decreasing emissions from all other human factors, as well as employing Carbon Negative solutions like CCUS, we can go back to the natural balance, where we still emit some greenhouse gases, but they're not more than the planet can handle so they disintegrate instead of pile up.
everything has to be balanced in both side
Now imagine if they did a graphic that estimated the total methane produced by Americans while consuming the average American diet? I'm a total windbag whenever I eat cabbage, broccoli, onions or garlic in any quantity. I swear we'd all literally be getting taxed out of our arses for our emissions! lol
wake up babe new kurzgesagt video
@Kurzgesagt-in a Nutshell
i heard that shellfish is also very expensive to produce. why were figures for seafood not included in this video? (is seafood meat?)
I'm here only to say that the thumbnail for this video is awesome. 👏
luckily the dislike button is gone other wise the vegans would destroy it
Good video but focuses too much on just the climate impacts of meat production. We’ve identified 9 planetary boundaries and meat is a massive destabilizing force on biosphere integrity, nitrogen/phosphorus flows, and land systems change (touched on here). If you ask the question “is meat bad for the planet?” the you’ll have a hard time continuing to equivocate and say “it’s complicated.” The answer is just yes at that point.
When billionaire sell their jets and own only one home instead of 5 ill consider reducing my beef intake
what im gonna do with this information?...im gonna eat more roasted cows i guess
ill be honest folks, i like meat, all kinds of it and i am not ready to give it up.
enjoying a nice burger to this video 🍔🍔
I would change over to plant based meat substitutes since some of them pretty much replicate the taste and texture of meat. Problem is, buying one kilo of beef costs me way less than 1 kilo of plant based beef substitute. I don't do well with money so my only choice is to buy beef. If the prices for these alternatives go down then i'll gladly change over
BEEF FOR LIFE!!!!!!!
I couldn't give any less fucks. I'm not giving up meat lmao.
Agronomist and farmer here.  In previous videos on the topic of food I was disappointed that the fact that most land used is unsuitable for crop production, and the use of cattle on native rangelands is a significant benefit for habitat maintenance and conservation, but these benefits were not discussed in previous videos. So, I am glad that they did touch on this in this video. However, they do add the stipulation that grain products are supplementally fed to cattle. Unfortunately, this is a half truth in practice.   Grain production has many different classifications for the use of different grains. Grains are graded on their quality, and poor quality grains that are not up to par for human consumption are fed to cattle. An example of this would be different types of wheat flour. The highest quality and protein grains are made into things like pasta, followed by bread, and finally pastry and baking flour which is the lowest quality wheat that is still suitable for human consumption. Grains that fall below these standards are then fed to cattle. Yes, there is land that is used to grow grain products that could have alternative use for human consumption. However, '41% of grain that is used to feed livestock' is misleading, as a significant portion of this is not high enough quality for human consumption. Grain for human consumption always goes for a higher price, so farmers will always prioritize growing human food when possible, because they make more money. However, some grain inevitably will not meet standards due to a number of factors, this is then sold for a lesser price as livestock feed.   I think there is an important differentiation to be made between different countries, and the impacts they have. Here in North America, the impact of livestock is intensively managed and studied. New and exciting technologies and strategies are implemented every year that increase efficiency, decrease environmental impact, and create a more sustainable food system. Developing countries with poor food security, education, and infrastructure make up a significant amount of the total pollution and environmental impact from ecosystem degradation, due to poor management practices. As mentioned in the video, Brazil burns areas of forest. First, to grow soy products for several years until the soil is degraded and can no longer support soy production, which it is then converted to grazing for cattle. India imports tonnes of grains to support growing populations and artificially feed cattle. The impacts of cattle grazing the North American plains is not the same as developing countries that feed poor diets that result in increased emissions (yes, I understand it is to maintain their livelihoods and feed hungry mouths, but the impact it has remains the same).  As an agronomist, I know that smart people are studying and implementing new strategies to mitigate impact and maintain ecosystems. Experts in the field are coming up with new and novel products that are safe and sustainable. Meat production is an integral part of the food system.
I wonder why people argue over this when its really simple to solve: Just eat meat once per week and fish once per week.   "moderation is the best thing"
This isnt a troll post as I am Vegan. You didn't cover what would happen if we actually switched to all vegan diets. What would be the result of that?
I see a lot of people arguing about the "thought provoking" comparison of CO2 Emission captured by Lands that would be saved if we cut out beef by 100 years vs. our yearly CO2 Emissions. The idea is not for you to crunch numbers but see that there can be an impact to the change even if its 8 Tril to our 50 tril per year. Currently we don't even have that 8 Tril rather we are going into the negatives every year. If you don't understand the point of the graph and is more worried about its inaccurate representations, then you are overlooking the message. We are not doing anything to stop or slow the emission so arguing about a "what if" scenario is a waste of your effort so shut up.
Bro he changed the title
just use permaculture instead of capitalist agriculture
한국어자막 안주시나요 ㅠ ㅠ
This defenitely makes me think. I love meat too much to be a vegan, but it could be interesting to decide to be vegan for a certain % of the year to cut on my meat consumption
Honestly, a lot of the problem with a LOT of the things that produce climate change (not just meat) is that we do not force the corporations involved to take ownership of their publicized costs, as it were. If the transport, energy production, and meat industries had to factor in environmental impact into their balance sheet then we'd see that shit get properly worked on in a very big hurry. After that, we might not even need to worry about individual action, the real engines of destruction will have done it already before we get a chance to impact things.
I don't care if it is.
For the meat eaters who think they just can't enjoy food to the fullest without meat, I used to eat approx 150-200g of protein per day - much more than the average person -- mostly from beef, and chicken. It's a big cultural thing, plus I was a powerlifter who liked protein-heavy diets.  I've been vegan for a few years now, and though it was hard at first, I now have virtually no cravings for meat(still miss some cheese occasionally though). In the last year or so it's actually getting to the point where I'm a little grossed out by meat, something I was convinced would *never* happen. I always just assumed I'd suffer the rest of my life for the animals and the environment, and part of going vegan was accepting that. But instead I honestly enjoy food now more than I ever did in my meat eating heyday (in part because I was forced to become a better cook, I suppose).  Not saying everyone will have the same journey; there are definitely vegans who miss meat more than I do. It can be hard having limited options at restaurants (though it gets better every year). But just letting you know it is possible even for some of the biggest meat eaters to make the switch without feeling like they're sacrificing the joy of eating for the rest of their lives. And even if you don't make the switch completely (for a while, I didn't mind having occasional meat as long as I was mostly vegan), just cutting your meat consumption significantly can make a big difference.
Conclusion: meat as a substance isn't bad, but agriculture and the way meat is produced and raised in mass quantities to meet demand is?  Solution: Eat every cow and set up sustainable hydroponics for raising fish and crops in place of land for cattle?
Go vegan
Could you make a video on sea food like fish
We live to eat food, and not vice versa.
The comparison at 9:33 is extremely misleading, since the top shows the amount of CO2 that would be pulled out over 100 years vs how much we put into the atmosphere in only 1 year. 800 billion divided by a 100 year span means it would only suck out 8 billion tonnes per year compared to the 50 billion put in per year.
Not to mention the cruelty and slaughter of the animals  to have your steak.
I still hate this I wish government and food companies would just wake the fuck up and stay awake for 100 years to see what their greed has done to the planet and the organisms. They either have to stop destroying forests and other natural habitats entirely or get their fortune burned and bombarded with firearms and chemical warfare. We should restore all forests and natural habitats. That should be a planetary goal if people cared to listen and take the right set of actions to save the planet and its many flora and fauna (humans are basically parasites and don't count as fauna)
well ..is fish okey???
why not feed the animals hemp seeds and the hemp would clean the air as well.. and thorium energy for clean energy
What about fish and seafood? Is it just as bad as the meat/beef or is it better or maybe even worse?
Can we just link bomb these videos to politicians?? They probably won't care but the media stories it generates should do something at least
1:07 "electric trucks" Like trains?
The only real reason for climate change is fossil fuel.
A plant-based diet is more healthy, so if people all ate mostly plants, people would live longer and create more emissions. I don't think this makes a plant-based diet worse for the climate, but it is an interesting point I've never heard being discussed in any bigger sources.
Big rip for dislikes. F'in google.
No more Krabby Patty, tell that to Spongebob.
my choice is... i will eat more meat now because i honestly dont care about humanity that kill each other, steal from each other, hurt each other, you humans are no good in this age and things are getting worse, so yeah, good luck everyone
Very nice video. One thing that bothered me though was at 9:20, where you graphically compared the CO2 we could remove *over 100 years* by sparing land for forests and grasslands to the CO2 we emit *over 1 year.* That comparison is unnecessarily misleading.
If they got rid of my beef I’d have to start hunting long pig. I wonder how many emissions people create, i mean theres only like 8billion of us….
Damn... Well my beloved meat, I guess our journey will come to an end very soon.. Maybe just once or twice every now and again.
TL; DR: Go veggie.
I wonder how they account for the fact that most of the carbon that food produces is just part of the carbon cycle and will just be reabsorbed, not new carbon introduced from fossil fuels
Okey I will try to eliminate meat especially beef from my diet! 🙈
During the time I took to watch this, the view count went up by 70,000. Awesome feeling knowing 70,000 other people just enjoyed that with me 😊
Stop eating beef to make a change. It's simple as that.
The problem is that we have way more people being born than what's sustainable. We are screwed pretty much. So either we control natality (and while we're at it, we improve life quality) or we destroy ourselves. But thats just an informed opinion from some guy on yt comments talking to the void
I don't wanna Completely give up on meat. I just wanna eat less of it.
Ion care, we are already doomed anyway
So, we need to diversify our meat culture in order to lower our beef consumption. Like introducing seafood culture or invent sea-animal husbandry. The ocean has so much larger areas that we are currently not utilizing.
If animals has taught us anything, food is food, don't be picky, eat the meat.
TL;DW? Go vegan. Not being vegan is not only morally injustifiable but, as the video shows, it's also environmentally absolutely unsustainable
Quality level : Kurzgesagt.  Really tho you guys are making benchmarks for other channels. Impressive
I refuse to stop eating meat. I require meat. Earth can go fuck itself if it wants to take away my steak., I will fight to the death on this hill.
"listen lady, i don't care about the planet  when I'm hungry" Diego, Awkward Puppets - Food truck
I feel the video tries to be unbiased, but already have come to its conclusion before researching the options.
So... What is that other ~4% of soybeans being used for? 🤔
We'll talk for yourself but I can think of some other things I'd list over food. I find food boring tbh and don't really enjoy it that enjoying unless it's something really bad for you..
Maybe the vegan teacher was right??????? NVM
"A kilogramme of beef would keep you alive much longer than a kilogramme of potatoes." Well, that's all I needed to hear! McDonald's here I come!
Any news on adding seaweed to the feed for cows? I would love to see how that impacts the numbers. Otherwise, great video
But isn't most methane emitted not by animals, but by food waste anyway? We're talking about the waste of plant matter that isn't used for our consumption, and requires animals to consume them anyway (the stems of cereals, for example). You mentioned it quite deceivingly, because you indicated that the majority of cereal is used for cattle. Well, yes, but we use a minor part of the plant anyway.  You said nothing about that aspect to promote some vegan position.
Hooray, once again a YouTube channel from a first world country will tell me what a bad person I am because I eat meat and how we are all going to die because of it. I love it!
4:23 yeah, but they don't grow food on the ship, it's gotta get there somehow. How does this (probably not very diminute) terrestrial logistic affect the numbers in the end?
I am not going to stop eating meat. No way. Definitely ain’t eating some lab grown Meat. Based around a big theory that is very inconsistent with data and predictions all while being a money cash cow behind it all.
What if you use your own meat? My grandma and grandpa have cows and chickens
Sponsored by fake meat
OK, Kurtzgesagt, you got me this time. Now I want some juicy beef burger.
nice video, but it is kinda biased, because cows dont have to eat cereal per se. They are mainly fed by cereal plant parts that cannot be eaten by humans.
2:49 "But they're both a kilogram"
I'm eating meatballs while watching this
kurzgesagt REALLY wants us to turn vegan
Well, for meat loving people, once we get Mars going carbon emissions would be a requirement on Mars to keep it warm.
Cant answer that.
Oh great another globalist propaganda video. Honestly I love this channel but whenever y’all talk about meat consumption or climate change it’s fucking ridiculous. We aren’t going to stop eating meat fuck off. I’m not going to eat the rabbit food and I’m not going to eat the bugs. Literally fuck off. Climate change happens and these climate change doomsday theories have been consistently wrong. I literally don’t care about climate change and no one else should either. The planet has survived much worse
If we consider country of origin, are some countries better than others for Beef production?
How can you ignore the suffering the meat and dairy industries cause in a video like this? To me it feels like the environmental aspects pale in comparison.
We’ve evolved over literally millennia to eat, cook, and process meat. We are in no real danger from eating it.   This just in- I’m eating a burger from steak and shake
Wow, Kurzgesagt actually made a useful video
Watching this while eating chicken wings 😂
What do you think people, why is your dogs/cats food so cheap today? Thanks to the massive amount of animal byproducts in these industries, your cats get the nutrition they need. And don't tell me they could be fed a vegetarian diet also
But…. What about bacon?  Everyone: “Vegan bacon.”
I think Ill have burgers for lunch.
Wow new upload!!!
There is no emission if CO2 is constantly in circulation. Only the burning of fossil fuels and the logging of trees can increase the CO2 content in the atmosphere. It is like persuading people to save water, but water is not destroyed and is constantly in circulation. If someone wants to ban meat production, he should look for a better argument than CO2 emissions, maybe it's really about empathy?
beef forever:D but less !! it's good for the heath good for the planet and also good for the moneypocket
"Carbon Budget"? WTF is that suppose to be or even mean? Just tax the air we breathe already! Oh look, the more humans there are the more food we need to produce, ergo eradicate human activity in general. Problem solved!
I'm watching this while eating hamburger steak
Can’t we harvest those methane farts as sources of fuel ?
no mr soy biden i dont want to eat bugs
You know it just sounds like your advocating for animal abuse and using the existing system not the ideal for your claims.
8:49 the soy face on the soy milk killed me
Next video: Is sunscreen bad?
Serious question. Why don't you guys only upload your videos in 480p to save on emissions?
k sea vegano dise :o
so what we should do a mass extermination of all the cows living in pastures and give the land back to nature, pretty sure that would mean extinction for the cow as its not really a wild animal its to domesticated by humans. i see no solutions here, other then legislative action.
Order a MC Donalds
They dont want people to eat meat because of how they treat the animals
What the point of liking the videos anymore?
You know, in a video titled "Is Meat Really that Bad," you'd think you would at some point mention the horrifically unethical treatment of animals in the animal agriculture process. Maybe this is strategic framing and you're just trying to avoid alienating your audience by pointing this out and making them feel bad. But if that's the case, that's pretty sad that we have to appeal strictly to environmental pragmatics rather than discuss the cruelty and suffering inflicted on billions of animals a year.
dont care im still gonna eat meat
Seems our best option is to somehow grow the meat synthetically.  That would also completely annihilate the mistreatment of animals as well.  But of course, people would freak out about it more than accept it.
meh, i dont really care at all about climate change. by the time it gets too bad, i'll be dead, so i dont care.
Regarding the shipping emits less than a truck: You still need to get the avocados off the ship and to the store...
Just a small note on the calendar. Kurzgesagt is not lying when they say it's extra shiny! Love my calendar, worth every cent!
I like deer and moose is okay but I think some hunters over do it and should be regulating on those who take Cree status. I dont care what you choose. We still need to respect life
If I can't have beef and beer on weekends, my life quality will will weaken noticeably. It's one of my big things to look forward to during weekdays. I just can't
So many vids "meat are bad", i hope meat will still be a thing as i get old, do not want to eat grass.
Yes it is.
assuming govts would actually "waste" all those 3 billion hectares with grass and forest, they would only place cities and factories making the problem even worse
So, as a mostly carnivore, I feel great eating very little, because the food I eat is nutrient dense. I could make a "difference" by going plant based, feeling like garbage on nutriently empty foods, but I can "feel" better about myself...  Maybe... we can just stop buying stuff. If the last year taught us anything, shutting down all the manufacturer plants, that produce unnecessary crap, made the biggest difference to the environment.
I guess I've got to stop having beef with people then.
BEEF STONKS GOING DOWN!!!
Climate change is a myth.
I feel like moderation is always important. I personally enjoy vegetarian food and meat, but learning about this more in depth has me wanting to adopt a more vegetarian dominant lifestyle. I don't think we all have to stop consuming meat altogether, just limit our consumption to maybe once a week or so.
Can you make a video on building death star
As far as i know we are trying to make lab meat. It has all the things we want from regular meat but without the cattle or other animals used for it. But we need a break through on how to make it without the use of animal cells.
This video kills the "i eat meat but i care about the environment" argument... Well, time to reduce/stop consuming it then.
Les go
This is just absolutely not true... A cow, properly managed on pasture, will sequester in the soil 4 times the co2-equivalent emitted from producing the meat from that cow. Giving cows less grass and more grains increases their methane production. Methane does not come out as farts. The methane it produced in their first stomach through anaerobic fermentation and is almost completely burped out. The biological responses to a well-managed pasture pattern provides far healthier ecosystems than for example monocultured grains. Food waste is a far bigger problem than choice of cultuvar/production. Almost 100% of fertilizers used in organic productions are manure, will someone claim that only using mineral fertilizers is a sustainable route? Before European colonization; the american steppes were filled with bison. Some say over a billion animals roamed the plains. The result? Incredible fertile and carbon rich soils, not an increase in temperature from the greenhouse effect. What happened when the bison were hunted down to extinction? The grasslands were replaced with monoculture crops and today these same fertile lands have had their stored carbon released as co2 and now farmers are relying heavily on mineral fertilizers while ploughing intensively, further diminishing the stored carbon... check out regenerative farming or silvopasture if you want insight into climate-friendly animal production. Stop reducing complex subjects down to simple slogans. Be more informed, throw less food
I smell bull shit , its all about the big bucks !
So much "sTatIsTiCs"
Kurzgesagt: Well, it's complicated. Me: As all things are.
Now, I won't be surprised if this doesn't change the overall picture, but how significant would post-consumption emissions be? It certainly feels like I'm letting out more carbon emissions after a vegetarian meal...
ahhhhhhhh. you say ships are insanely more efficient. but then what about emissions getting the goods from the port to the shelves? I must say though, I am suprised how efficient the ship was in terms of CO2 per kg of cargo, but then again they do carry literally thousands of tons when lorries carry maybe 10-20
Hmm.. I kind of want a steak now. How's that for irony.
I used to eat a lot of meat. But i stoped and mostly consume YFood now. Its something
The only answer for this is to limit you meat consumption. If you do not want to become vegan atleast only consume animal products twice week.
How about practicing some self-restraint. Meat is still good for you, just not if you're eating like a fat fuck and consuming pounds of it every single day. Not to mention, if the CO2 caused by farts is so great, humans are the number 1 culprit of contributing to this. And how about we stop using oil, that would be a lot more helpful than cutting back on eating meat. Not making a very good argument here.
the solution- Cannibalism  will reduce both population & world hunger!
Now i am hungry
This has got to be the first youtube video ever where the answer to the question in the title is just "yes."
nah carnivore is the way to go
Kurzgesagt I’ve never known you to deal with maybes  You should keep your beak out of this topic It was sad to watch you dredge on about this
Can you do a video about lab grown meat please.
much of what cattle eat is food waste that we cannot eat, such as the cores and leaves of corn. is this considered in the graph at 8:41?
Man made climate change is a myth
You know from my knowledge, in the past before the populace were able to eat whatever they wanted, I'm certain meat was a rarity, and only for special occasions was bought, whereas grain and legumes and the sort were the main staples
im glad they came back to this topic and really addressed it. These are facts that most people don't know and refuse to listen to when it comes from a vegan person, i appreciate a neutral take on this topic. it could help a lot of people make better decisions
The thing about chicken is though we don't HAVE to feed them with grain. Chickens are omnivores with a heavy reliance on insects when they are allowed to go feral. I am sure the same pasture land they use for cattle could support a flock of birds much much larger then the physical mass of the same amount of cattle and you striat up would not HAVE to feed them if they free ranged. (At least mine don't) The only thing you would have to do is possibly supply some calcium supplements if they are prolific layers.
Just going to add here that he neglects to mention bio waste created by farming is used as feed for ruminant animals. This actually increases the efficacy of beef abit. Not to mention maneures which helps keep land use efficient. Idk to what degree, I just remember watching a good video on it.
Amazing video! Thank you guys so much for putting all this research into an easy to understand format
The problem with this, and every vegan argument about cutting down on meat or going vegan, is that the consequences of doing so are CATASTROPHIC on the environment. Not a single damn vegan has yet to explain to me what we do with all of these farm animals if we suddenly stop eating meat. We can't let them out in the wild because that completely destroys forests, and wildlife balance. We can't let give them all the free space to roam around without destroying more land to give them adequate space. We can't let them breed as they like because they would have zero predator's and population control. And because they still rely on us so much, we have to continue to feed them as they populate uncontrolled under our protection. Which means more land needed to grow food specifically for these animals. The consequences of switching to vegan diet without a proper solution that isn't "murder all the animals", is more damaging to the environment than any other alternative.
Simply by deleting all Factorio megabases, we can cut global emission by 77%
insect based diet when?
As usual- need to cut down on usage and food and travel etc. Bill Burr is right - there’s just too many of us. We need to cut down on humans.   Bottom line is earth can’t support this many humans living their lives like we do.
A lot of plants that are fed to cows are often the inedible and discarded parts humans either cant or dont want to eat. So its disingenuous to say all the plants are entirely used for one or the other.
@~9 min - What about a Fish Diet?
Why no mention of buffalo? In the 1800s (when things were natural) there were ~60,000,000 bison in America. There are currently 93 million cows in America. That's only 1/3rd more animals producing methane than there were before the industrial revolution. Cow farts are not that much different now than they were before modern meat production. Plus, as noted in the video, the production farmed cows produce less methane than free-ranged ones anyway, so that narrows that gap between pre-industrial levels and modern agriculture even further.
Caramba, Brasil..
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive"  Being a nihilist who gives meaning to life through food, I can confirm that.
At first I thought, they were talking about pp and veve. But now I know. But meat, I need my protein. I ain't giving it up to be a soy boy!
My sixth spider sense is warning me of an internal agenda pushing…
On the subject of feeding human food to livestock, the video didn’t mention that some the food that they give are the not edible to humans like husks and stalks
You can make an argument about anything. Meat is causing pollution. Avocados are causing droughts. Fish is destroying the ocean ecosystem.   You can argue anything but it's where you get your food and how it's made. There will always be trade offs.
9:24 this was very weird,  I suspect you are trying to exaggerate the effect by saying in hundred years instead of per year and why you compare it with emission per year in the graph, sneaky
9:32 this graph is deceptive. You are too intelligent and knowledgable to make such a basic error (comparing a 100 year emission reduction to a 1 year emission) why ?
Hi kurzgesagt nice work as always!! Could you do also a video about fishing industries? :)
It's 12:15 AM right now with my phone charging being 14% but I just can't sleep without watching this video
I found the pork emissions figure to be surprising. Especially given the later revelation that pigs are exclusively fed cultivated crops. I'd be interested to see that explained further. Exploring how fish compare would also be interesting.
The trick to solve the beefy problem is to standardize the introduction of Algae , Seaweeds and Sargassum in feedlots worldwide in order to reduce methane emissions from livestock via burps and farts.
There are too many people. We need a pandemic. No wait..
Video suggestion: can you guys make a video on carbon capture and how we can scale it?   Would also love to see a video diving into the theoretical faster-than-light spacecraft - the Alcubierre warp drive! It would be cool to see an animation on using man-made black holes (or kugleblitz) to power a warp drive using the “black hole electromagnetic amplifier” concept you guys animated in your black hole bomb video (use a giant mirror and an electromagnetic wave gun to induce superradiance scattering around a black hole).
So if we eat meat only two days in a week (2 meals in these days) will it helps
Can't wait for this to be a really big political topic in a few years. It's going to be an absolute shitshow.
I heard from Raymond Redington that rabbits have a very low carbon footprint. Is this true?
Do one with Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, Vivaldi and Haydn, please!
this video sucks. the whole argument is that food makes co2? did we forget about all the companies releasing tons and tons of co2 that have nothing to do with feeding people? stop blaming the individual for damaging the climate, the true culprits are taking advantage of this kind of false propaganda. stop this at once. thanks kurzdeeznuts, no thanks, veganism will not save the world, stop being so goddamn naive.
burn the world not the meat. just walk it through the kitchen.
I know that this is a very broad subject to cover , but I am a little disappointed that the spread of disease and overuse of antibiotics associated with factory farming was not touched on. Kind of important if we don't want Covid 2.0.
Unfortunate the focus was on Beef. Gives an easy way for people who think local produce is way better to ignore that the move to local is such an insignificant reduction in energy and CO2. Factor in how much more local costs and the impact on the Environment (your work to get the money causes emissions and energy use) may be quite a deal worse for local produce.
In 1700, there were more Bison in North America than there are cows in 2021…all those bison farted too…  Calculating cow farts is a great example of climate alarmism.
Amazing video! A good follow up might be a video about the risk that we will live through another world pandemic in our lifetime, and how meat consumption adds up to that risk
bold move to release this video when dislikes are removed lol
this is so difficult. Meat is so important to our diets yet it is one of the worst things for the environment and the treatment of animals. And its not like we can all go vegan, because without meat you would be very unhealthy.
Time to watch Kurzgesagt new video
I really think you guys should publish your background music. It sounds really beautiful, and I suspect not only will it bring about a multitude of profile for you, but also people get to enjoy it
What is the scientific consensus on the viability of vegan diet. Do we know if evryone could be vegan without health problems and without animal based supplement ? What is the difference in emission between an ovo lacto vegetarien diet and a vegan diet ?
"You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information".  No, can implies objective permission, which is ultimately don't have.
Thank you for the video. Finally something I can easily share with my friends so they can understand my reasons behind becoming vegetarian without trying to explain it while sounding like I'm a Jehova's witness. Show them this, let them decide.  (although I can't see how someone can live with themselves while knowing what they eat is harming the planet & us all)
I’m surprised you guys didn’t talk more about the importance of dairy, in particular in the raising of children. It’s also strange to zero in on carbon emissions, when food production is mostly a measure of water & land use. There was exactly one line about fertilisers, which is also an intensely odd omission since fertilisation is *the* critical step that makes modern agriculture so effective.
The title is missing "For The Climate" because they completely neglected to mention they myriad health risk of eating and meat.  Or the unnecessary cruelty to the animals.
Really no reason to eat meat.  It’s also worse for health, worse on water consumption, worse on water polution and ethically it’s a huge fail.  I’ve been plant based for 15 years, my brother and parents for 10.  Everyone has better health markers.
What are you going to do with all these cows after relasing them? (ingoring they are not suitable to live in the wild) stop them from farting? lol
what about fish?
Sadly the thing is that not everyone can rely on the vegetarian equivalent of beef, for the simple reason that they can't afford it. I live in France and in general, 100g of veggie "meat" would cost 4 to 6 times as much as 100g of beef does. With the constant inflation and the stagnation of the salaries, it is very difficult for families and low-income people such as me, a student, to pay 4 euros for that little food. It is mainly a commercial issue in my opinion, since we saw that meat is theorically more costly in general in terms of production, in fact vegan or vegetarian product are subject of a huge marketing, making it "trendy" and it incites shops and super-markets to sell it at  higher prices. I don't think it is an issue only in France and I'm sure much more people would use this alternative if it was cheaper, but it implies some economical sacrifices which I'm not sure big industries are willing to take.
Thumbs up for that great thumbnail! I would do anything for meat! ;)
I dont eat beef because it tastes terrible anyway
Idc what it is  If it tastes good  imma eat it
More unscientific videos... Kurtzgazet is losing it. :/
If you want to live more than 90 years, better stop eating meat. Most centenarians, Jack LaLanne and Clint Eastwood are predominantly vegans/ vegetarians
That fart-o-meter lol
So, eat less beef and more pork and chicken.  And they both tend to be cheaper than beef.  Save money while saving the environment.  Porkburgers, anyone?
Will the rich people stop eating meat? Or is it just for us poor people? I think we all know the answer to that. I’m not gonna make a sacrifice that a billionaire or a senator won’t make
I don't like that you guys conflate all animals feed with cattle feed at the end. Yes a sizable portion of food crops are going to livestock but most of that is going to pigs, fowl, and work animals; not cattle. Around 70% of the grown feed that cattle get is inedible stuff like soybean hulls, or cornstalks. Plus a lot of the edible stuff is low grade and marked not for consumption by humans.
Wait, no carbon cycle mention at all?... How much % of beef emissions are methane? Really bland episode tbh
Maybe a weird question but if we somehow managed to reduce food waste to zero and kept everything the same, but lowered the amount of food we produced (since we need less because we waste less) how much would CO2 emissions drop percentage wise?
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day, and never gets old." ... I can think of another..
It depends on the person. If you're Penn Jillette or Kevin Smith, with clogged arteries and risk of heart attack, you should go full whole-plants vegan. If you're Jordan Peterson or his daughter Mikhaila, and you have auto-immune issues, you can go the no-carbs, meat and veggies route.  But what's definitely good to get rid of is sugar,  synthetic preservatives, dough conditioners, and seed cooking oils.
The background music was a jam
You know that most of the humanity's problems, including climate change can be solved by having less population, right?
"Is meat really that bad?" Looks like some vegans were arguing with them lol
Where's fish?
Vegan Karen disagrees to all and wants to speak to Kurzgesagt Manager
Sex is better, than food.
Cow go Moo, Cow go Beef, Me eat Beef!
Make the artifical meat cheaper then lmao
Guess I'm exclusively eating meat from factories! Thanks
I would prefer a prime cut of steak compared to a veggie patty but hey thats my opinion
Big agriculture is the problem. Without everyone having a small farm like 60 years ago everything has a long transportation requirement. Beef, chicken, pork, mystery meat has nothing to do with it. Transportation is the real problem. I know for a fact that my cattle aren't using any emissions at all. You say my cattle emit methane, my local white tail deer heard is over 100 head in the corn field at night, I have no where near that many cattle even though the deer are smaller their is a total of more deer. Cattle and deer are both ungulates.
burbger
Why is the dislike bar hidden this is so stupid
Did they mention the fact that if we were all to eat the "less impact" beef, there would be not enough of it? Not enough land, not enough crops...
This information has opened my eyes to a wide variety of useful knowledge that I can use to improve my decisions in my newly entered adult life. Although nothing drastic had changed in my basic ways of eating, as I've always had an omnivore diet, I would say that what was presented here speaks more to what goes on behind the scenes and makes me feel more motivated to buy a sack of potatoes. Thank you for this newfound knowledge sire, I will treasure it safely in my mind and heart.       Now to eat this burger.
Thanks, I will keep eating beef
So what you’re saying is that we should switch all livestock to chicken and essentially duplicate what happened to horses during the automobile revolution.  The number of horses alive around the world dramatically plummeted when automobiles overtook horses as the main source of transit.  So should we stop using cows for food, basically de-domesticate the cow, and breed a form of cattle well suited for the wild to preserve the species (or at least the family which cattle is a part of)? Sort of like what (and I hate to mention his name) Hitler tried to do with his project to bring back the aurochs? Don’t get me wrong, Hitler was a bad dude, but we could use that same idea here.  Besides, who doesn’t like the idea of eating oodles of chicken wings? Chicken is insanely lean, good for you, and as it was shown here, efficient!  Bdubs would make a killing!
I don't understand what everyone says as cows generate carbon from nothing when the carbon comes from their food of which is coincidentally the biggest carbon capturer plant its a cycle not something like fossil fuels taking carbon that already left the cycle back to the atmosphere, the only real point I see is destroying the forest for farmland of which is 800 billion tons in 100 years when other sources produce 5 trillion in 100 years
This video is missing the part where it provides alternative ways of producing beef that are less carbon-intensive. Don't present problems without solutions.
I’ve said multiple times that my personal solution to the problem is to triple the price of all meat worldwide, that way less gets eaten so less need to die so less land is used to keep them. Not to mention it would drastically improve the diets of all humans.
Brainless test tube animals in 5,4,3,2......
Good job on the video but it seams unfair to discuss the consumption of meet being "bad" and not talk about animal suffering nor health consequences. Staying with the topic of animal suffering, most people would agree that, if every time a cow was killed for its meet a puppy or a cute cat was also killed, they would reconsider or at least think for a moment about their decision of consuming it, which implies animal suffering would be a valid factor. Its no secret that basically no one cares about the suffering of  cows, pigs and chicken, but being a Kurzgesagt video, one would expect that the holocaust of a few species related to the subject at hand would be brought up at some point during the video
Gonna keep eating meat but will reduce my carbon footprint in other ways.
great video. atleast you expose the cruel meat and dairy indusy and how they make animals suffer. im a happy i only eat plant based vegan food.
A plant based agricultural system is necessary, also lab grown-meat should be standardized, mock meats like beyond meat should be subsidized too, vegan food is quite tasty!
hmn cost them almost 7 months to respond What I've Learned's video
Finally some honesty and SCIENTIFIC communication about animal products!  I feel you missed the chance to make a shout out at the end apologizing for the innacurate and meat promotional videos you released before, with much more hype from the Kurzgesagt team.  I hope you turn this around and complement this video with the many ways that new agricultural models are possible and necessary, like permaculture, agroforestry (instead of monoculture, which are always unsustainable and exist manily for producing feed, as you finally reported in this new video), not burning forests and savannas (also part of the monoculture/animal industry system), refloresting and expanding forest and other biomes  or (even better) their reserves, carbon footprint impacts of less need for our expensive health systems (that aren't very ecologically efficient as well), by how much the letting go of polluting animal industry would allow the oceans to be restored (fertilizers and animal feces are the dominant pollutant that create the ocean dead zones - which also have costs in carbon footprint for us)... Between other often forgotten benefits and necessities that a so vegan as possible world is.  When not also incentivizing people to be sensible and act according to reason as much as possible.
Like you said in your prior climate change video, if everyone who had access to YT lowered their personal greenhouse emissions it would only hold off climate change for so long without major greenhouse emitting nations like US, China, India, EU, etc making a quick transition to renewals. COP26 showed China US and India aren’t going to. Why should I sacrifice a fleeting joy if the world as we know it will dramatically change regardless?
Many are saying if there are any possible alternatives to reduce meat emissions, wow so many people still want to eat cows OwO 🤣😭
And now "What I've Learned" will make a video contradicting this hahaha. Let's see.
in addition to its significant environmental harms, *meat is murder.*
Might I remind everyone who is arguing for eating meat: you are arguing for short term human pleasure over the destruction of our biome.
Take that vegans >:D
why can we only see likes and not dislikes?
What's the best beef tho? Grass feed locally sourced?
tl;dr  Carbon footprint is huge. Best meat is worse than worst grain. Buying locally doesn't help since transport is cheap in carbon. Grasslands can't be cultivated... But grass fed isn't efficient; they need grains to sustain them. Better grow forests than grasslands.  Now go use our sponsor: Skillshare.
I want to be vegan
I just noticed something!!! But at... totally makes it seem like... 16%... not bad by any means... good rest of video... My point is...
I bought 7.5 KG of meat today...YUMM!!!
Ok so... most of this raw data seems somewhat useful, but I feel it totally glossed over agricultural practices as being a huge contributer of all of this carbon emissions, like how about tilling soil? Tilling soil alone causes huge co2 spikes doesn't it? How about Cattle grazing rotation? Last I checked grazing Cattle help trap carbon, one problem I see is you take cows  away from nature it can't do its job of grazing, last I checked Cattle are animals that are in nature and animals in nature always have a job of some sort whether it is a pest like mites and snails or its a predator. In nature we just would  not see cows present at  the current amount amount, and certainly not crammed together like they are now.   it seem to me that agricultural techniques need to be refined and people need to get more connected with the earth and have a balanced diet rather than this weird lop sided diet that's going on. These days big box  farming is packed together so tightly and it's so efficient that it kills local farms, which have better agricultural practices, we need alot  of small scattered farms not a few big ones.  And these small farms need alot more variety of both plants and animals. People tend thrive on a varied diet not lop sided ones, too much  soy can and you can get allergy issue,   too many burgers and  you get all sorts of problems. I agree that beef should be produced far less than it is And burgers should be more of a treat, but this data is only a small portion of the picture.
tysm for this much needed video
Now I want a burger.
Beef is bad beef is bad beef is bad beef is bad...  ... you can decide what you want to do with that information.
Thank you 🙏 now cover health issues regarding meat and maybe people will hesitate even less to stop eating it.
Honestly I care more about overpopulation than what we eat. It's much easier to solve by providing reproductive rights and availability and making sure that people have access to jobs that provide a living wage and treat their workers fairly. I'm not having kids so I have zero guilt any time I eat beef or any other meat. Sorry for the run-on sentence.
I have the best solution, focus on technological advancement in heavy industry and leave meat alone. There's other problem, we can do anything with any information but ultimately fascists will not care about it and will force you to eat soy.
So are vegans ok with killing cows??
What's the environmental impact of consuming crickets and insects? I'm seeking more insect protein products in grocery stores
What about biomass technology though?
While I won't ever eat a veggie burger as they are just not the same I know at least Americans eat way too much beef. I'd be ok if beef costs went up due to going all grass fed or whatever. Make Beef a  monthly or yearly treat  for holidays and such.
The life time carbon footprint of an average American exceeds 20 tonnes. If each person's carbon dioxide emission were made into a solid mass of carbon, it would be 1,540 tons and we would need 40 trucks to carry it. If you really care about climate change and your impact on the environment, HAVE FEWER KIDS.
Can someone please experiment with methane capture technology at these cattle factories? We may be able to reduce some amount today while it may take some time for consumer behaviour to change
What if instead of livestock farms. What if we convert them into hunting lands. A deer can feed a family for a long while
9:34 basically it only dropped from 50b to 42b tonnes after we have removed all the land for livestock. Comparing 100 years with 1 year is just misleading. Kurzgesagt should make this clear and not try to mislead people. It somehow shows their agenda when presenting this video, which isn't good if they are presenting this video as a "factual" and "objective"  Apart from that, I have gone through some of the studies they cited. Some of these studies actually suggest "increase livestock and pasture productivity" instead of outright saying meat is bad like this video implied. Just to say, is Kurzgesagt nitpicking facts?
While factory farming is better for the environment, the moral cost is not worth it to me. So I’m just not gonna eat meat.
That vegan teacher would be so happy to hear this
The video didn’t even touch on how unsustainable it is including the other livestock (ie chickens, pigs, etc.) as well as the fishing industry, which is a whole other mess.  Also, unlike how the video presents, we aren’t “demonizing” the cows with their CO2/ methane emissions. They (plus other livestock animals) had no choice BUT to be artificially inseminated by humans, abused, and grown at an insane pace so that it can be slaughtered and feed the worldwide carnivore population.   Being vegan is the single best way to reduce our carbon footprint, not to mention the benefits it has in reducing the chances of cardiovascular disease. It’s ethical, morally sound, and significantly reduces suffering amongst animals.  It’s sad and infuriating how most people will watch this and the information will flow from one ear to another. It is true that +70% of these crops go to feed the animals, NOT humans. If we used those crops to feed humans, there wouldn’t be a problem with world hunger—what a concept.   If people want to argue, for example, that almonds take up a lot of water to grow, well, it’s not comparable to the amount a single cow drinks in a day (not to mention how much it takes to create 1 lb of meat).
question, if we stoped eating meat and there products, the population of theas animals would plumit, would you think they could at some point be considerd and endagerd spicies? Also if you can have animals to eat the grass, wouldn't then all of the worlds farmland turn into fields? I don't know how many people like looking at corn in there back yard insted of grass.
P
It's funny how all these "scientist always find that the multi-billion megacorps are never to blame for all the ships and planes nah their not the probably it is all the poor family farms to blame just trying to make a living.  It would be interesting to see where meat lies in Fossil Fuel Consumption Chart which is the actual cause of global warming but I'm sure your "scientist" would find away to stick it to the little man.
Wheres my vegan squad at?
I’ve been having this debate internally for a while now. I stopped eating meat because of a lot of things I heard concerning health and other negative factors, glad you made this video literally RIGHT on time to answer a lot of my questions Lol.
If everyone just went vegan, vegetarian, or even just pescitarian the world would be so much better. It's a moral evil and bad for climate change. I'm open to debate.
For people claiming food is the best thing.. Just ask yourself, whether it’s one better than the health (physical or mental), of your unborn child in the near future! Amazing video..
More soy. Yeah, that’s what we need.
Grass fed beef is more nutritious than other types of beef
no
Fine out interesting the types of videos that have come out since the YouTube stopped showing dislikes.
Omg I'm so sad. I just found out that I wasn't subbed this entire time😔
Food is arguably SHUT UP
Everyone is talking about the 9:33 graph. But They had no other options. The empty lands with tress won't reduce much CO2 in 10-20 or even 30 years from now. Only way to show how much they will remove CO2 is by the scale of a century. On the other hand, you can't surely say how much CO2 we will make in the next century.
Sintetic meat
Grear vid, would have been good to mention that aquacultrually farmed mussels are an extremely good replacement for beef and other meats whilst still being one of the most sustainable protein and nutrient sources around :)
0:04 My right hand would like to have a talk with you.
Thank you so much for this video some other youtube channel were trying to spead selective miss information about this particular topic
Getting Succession theme song vibes from the background music.  But also the 20% human soy and 80% animal soy argument is fallacious because the 100% equals the entire soy plant. Humans eat the 20% of the plant animals don’t eat; and animals eat the 80% that humans don’t eat. If we relied more on soy we would still need MORE soy plants and MORE factory farming and deforestation.
I just feel like we are doomed when I hear climate change
I love to see when that containership pulls up at my local market to deliver fruits. oh it’s just amazing how they move on land and avoid all the cars. The way they calculate beef emissions is over inflated. they factored in elements that are not considered in any other CO2 calculations for any other food.
Really? Meat? bad? I have some backing evidence that its not...Since the beginning of time. Have a look.
what about feeding cows seaweed or kelp?  does it actually drastically reduce the methane from the cows and is it something that could be even cultivated at scale to be effective?
No Too much, yes
But how close we are to synthetic meat? Can it be a real possibility?
Eat the bugs, bigot
Rip my J.B Peterson only steak diet
Food is THE only reason I haven't committed suicide yet.
Great stuff still gonna eat meat
I love to eat meat (not beef so much, my stomach has a hard time with that) but would love for there to be a way to drastically decrease the carbon footprint of eating meat, since I don't think we're going to stop eating it anytime soon. I live on a cow farm and know the owners. While not using as much land for pasture would help reduce carbon emissions, we also need to figure out what those people would do once they don't have a farm. It's how they bring money in to feed their family and it's what they've known. Not to mention the fact that grass-fed beef/meat is in high demand since it's considered healthier/more ethical. There's a lot we would need to do if we were to all go vegan - it may have a positive impact on climate, but maybe not so much for the people who were running the farms in the first place.  Something I would love to see you guys talk about is the cost of farming plants as well. There are still issues such as with fertilizer and pesticides that wouldn't go away if we became fully plant sustained. There's also the issue where only a small part of the crop may edible - what do we do with the waste? I want to know the pros and cons of this as well so I know how to accurately compare eating meat vs not eating meat. While I love your content, this still feels a little biased. You made a video about a year or so ago about this that was definitely way more one sided. While this one is executed much better (and presented tough questions), I still feel like it would be fair to talk a bit more about the issues with crop farming.
While the video is pretty good, it does skew a bit of information. Others have already commented on that. Also, an individual's choice in what they eat will not have any impact on climate change so long as we don't keep petroleum companies and other main sources of carbon emissions held accountable. In my opinion, we should focus on the true drivers of climate change, not on what Joe from Walmart is eating for dinner.
The only solution really is to have less people to feed
I would rather hunt for my meat than eat disgusting plant meat wannabes, so yeah don't anyone dare try to say that bad, the whole factory farms thing is a lot more inhumane than one clean kill for a year worth of meat.
Yes
pepole seem to sleep on the best source of proteins : mushrooms
Somehow it fills like "Merchants of the doubt" or "Thank you for smoking". A lots of information with no particular answer. I feel the urge to research this stuff myself
Phenomenal video. Well done Kurzgesagt. Thanks for tackling these delicate but important issues, I love how you don't hold back.   (Also, your book on Immunology is amazing. Even as a physician I find the new perspective fascinating!)
great video! i am however a little upset to see no mention of lab grown meats in the section about solutions to meat CO2
Sooo if most of the emissions from beef comes from the cows themselves then the only option here is to cull the species. Which is a whole other issue and is not ok ecology. So if all these cows were just roaming free in the wild their emissions would still be the same....
But the main thing is that where your humanity while killing someones mother or father for your 5 minute plate pleasure...Go vegan 🌱🌱🌱
There is one other bodily function that we can enjoy multiple times a day and never gets ild
Don't let your body be the coffin of animals.  Humans have turned this planet into a horror story for most the animals here.  Humans are monsters.
However the grasslands the cattle use take in carbon both from the manure of the cows and the air, healthy crops take in much more carbon rather than the mono crops used for humans and animals. While yes the cows do release greenhouse gases the soil they walk on makes up for that footprint. You pointed out the carbon being released from the forest soils in deforestation but not the carbon captured with grazing cattle
No other bodily pleasure gets enjoyed multiple times every day? I disagree 😂
Why not talk about the regenerative farming and forest farming that not only creates carbon zero animal farming but also gives all the nutrition back to the soil, unlike mono crop agriculture?
What makes us think that our lives are more significant than our fellow mammals? Cows are some of the most intelligent and peaceful animals on Earth and yet we breed them on a mass scale to die. Beef is just a word that means cow flesh, and cow flesh is bad for your health overall. Cultural paradigms hold us back as a society. It is hard to change one’s perspective, when they are not willing to confront themselves and ask why are they defending meat consumption in the first place. Think for yourself, and choose differently. Not for you, but for the animals!
urgent Turkish subtitles
When are we going to talk about how the earth is overpopulated and that too is a huge factor in polution? Whats even with all these high HDI countries encouraging people to have kids to solve short term problems like the pension system?  Noone really gonna talk about this??
People always talk about cow's farts but nobody talks about human farts.  I always get super farty when I introduce veggies into my diet, And let's not even talk about legumes, because my body + legumes will introduce too many toxic gases into the atmosphere
That is not taking into account the fact that cows mostly eat the plants that we cant eat
I'm quite surprised that the main point of consideration, at least for me, when I think about eating animals is mass-scale suffering and pain. The title should be 'Is Meat Really that Bad for Global Warming?'.
where's the moral arguement? maybe we shouldn't eat meat because it was once attached to an animal. in order to enjoy animal flesh, an animal must suffer, and then we must murder her, in front of her friends, all for our addiction. when you eat an animal's flesh, you eat their suffering, and all the suffering she ate. you can not eat animal flesh and call yourself moral.
So much meat eating copium in the comments. Meat is bad for the environment. We have known this for decades.
Hey! You compared on a graphic amount of CO2 that can be absorbed by grasslands and forests if everyone go vegan per 100 year, with emissions people do in a year. In 100 years it will  only be 800 000 000 off 5 000 000 000. Only 16%. Someone must be very vegan in Kurzgesagt to lie to their audience by comparing 100 year graphic and 1 year graphic without showing that on the actual graphic.  Perfect reason to unsubscribe.  Nice to see straight propaganda on science popular program.
0:04 "No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day, and never gets old." Oh how wrong you are...
I remember seeing a documentary about the evolution of intelligence. One of those factors was cooking meat and changing the proteins within giving us an advantage. And it explains vegans to the T, for me. I dunno if a lack of animal proteins make you self absorb your brain, but I look forward to the end of the world if vegans go with it. For being so animal friendly they sure like riding high horses.
Thank for vidio
I suffer from sibo. Protein has kept me alive as I go through different treatments. I’m severely underweight. While I think we need to focus on the planet, the first step is examining and reducing waste. The amount of meat I see thrown out from restaurants, it’s heartbreaking.
This channel always makes great content and approaches topics really well. I've been thinking more and more over the past couple months about eating meat. Im not going to stop, at least not right now, but I am starting to eat less meat, less beef, and trying to get into cooking and padding out meals with other things. For me it was partially climate change, but also the moral aspect. The more I chewed on it the more torn I became.
Next you’ll be telling us to eat insects
What always blows me away is when you see people in rural/tribal Africa, Southeast Asia or South America, they always have perfect, white teeth, because their diets are nearly completely void of refined sugar.  Refined sugars *really* mess up your teeth hard, especially when you're a child. It's also where the British smile comes from. The UK loves their treacle and sweets.
What a bad video, full of flawed facts and heavily biased. Lol kurzgesagt do you remember when you had to delete that immigration crisis video? I hope you delete this as well
Vegans are shaking
Hey, don't forget that in the middle of the Amazon rainforest there is a country, Brazil and in that country there are people, many people!  people who depend largely on the economy of soy and cattle raising to supply a historic demand in the global market!  Combating climate change is very important, but it cannot be done at the expense of the livelihood of an emerging and peripheral country.  The fight against climate change needs to be done jointly and on fair terms for Brazil too, as we are one of the most interested in climate preservation, as we are also one of the countries that suffers most from environmental degradation.  Criticizing the Brazilian environmental degradation being in North America/Europe is very easy, but remember that you also create the demand, you also create the problem!  So let's settle this together, on fair terms
I don't know why people are genuinely discussing the effect to environment and meat cultivation necessity , In an era where food was scarce and animals have to eat there kind to survive is still acceptable ,  but when you have plenty of cultivated agricultural food no one needs to eat or go through    meat / killing / butcher / annihilation / Death   and to make this there daily life routine , It is no less then monstrous and if you posses kind heart and eyes , its not that difficult to think like an    educated / intellectual / Nobel / almighty     being rather then an animal
The way you guys set up the local versus global food argument was a little disingenuous/misleading. When you compare the emissions per kilogram of a huge shipment of goods like a cargo ship versus a smaller shipment of goods like a truck the smaller shipment of goods is always going to have a higher carbon footprint per kilogram. However this is assuming that we absolutely have to have global distribution to feed everybody, the truly best situation for the environment would be for all food to be locally produced therefore eliminating all global shipping emissions. Obviously that’s not realistic we can’t just shut down the global economy but this is the problem we’re up against global shipping is a huge impact on the environment just because you can break it down to a emissions per kilogram argument doesn’t stop the fact that shipping is a huge percentage of the overall problem.
It is really bad. The reason is not saving animals, but we need to destroy our monster DNA. Instead of destroying weaklings life from raping, slavery, leeching from third world countries, destroy animals/environment; let's start protect them even sacrificing some of our cravings.
Ok this seems misleading to me personally, the 800B is for a 100 years meaning 8B tonnes per year. While the emission per year is 50B tonnes. But hey that's 16% which is good I guess...
BEEF STONKS!
Man this video really showed me how biased you can be. The first two times you made this video I was willing to give a pass since maybe the research was too new but now skipping out on key parts of arguments and laying in only the information that makes your argument look good goes to show the little neutrality you have on certain topics
How about humanely farming humans till we die of old age?
“Beef stonks”
I don't even eat beef that much. like twice a year maybe, or none at all. I only eat pork, chicken, and turkey. And the rest of what I eat is vegetables, bread, and I won't lie, I have a really bad sweet tooth.
Space cows!
Why don’t vegans moan during the deed? . . . . . Because they don’t want to admit that some meat makes them feel good 😉😏
I can go beef free and get rid of milk in my daily diet, but I can’t imagine a life as a vegan…
Plant meant tastes bad. I’ll always advocate for real, healthy, cow meat. 🇺🇸 🥩
9:41 oh yes, i would like to eat my T cell
The thing is no matter how many people made a switch to vegetarianism, it's just like recycling - no amount of "personal contribution" is going to make a dent in the global industries so that only leaves the moral choice of it all - do you or do you not want to be able to know (not say, no one likes preachies) that you have a smaller carbon footprint? it's like wearing a mask, you may not be making a difference (you are) but at least you're doing your part.
So While I don't consume a lot of beef, I do use a lot of dairy. How bad is using those products for the environment? I imagine it's still pretty bad, because in order to get milk from cows, you need to constantly be making new cows, but I don't know for sure.
8:56 I think you are kinda wrong there. Yes, the graph is technically true. We turns the beans into soil. And we end up with 20% soil for human and the rest mostly for animals.  But those 20% in mass represent more than 60% of the earnings of the farmer. And that's the only things we should look at. The reason why the farmer cultivate those beans is because the soil they can sell to human is profitable. The other 80% in mass are almost useless waste. Well, they still have some value, but no human would ever eat that, we litteraly can't digest it. So we are kinda still growing thoses crops for humans.
i like meat
Is there anyone out there who doesn't enjoy eating like me ?
Meat... Agian?
why do people not realise everything has a beginning and an end. Try to use resources efficiently, and wait for the end, but not causing imminent death of the planet
Isn’t it funny how all the comments are trying to point out mistakes? 😂 people start getting defensive when it comes to meat
This video did not upset me. It made me hungry.
Isn't saying that most of the crops go to animals a bit unfair and misleading. What percentage of the crops that are consumed by animals can be consumed by people? 10-20%? How much of a problem is that? I'm not saying we don't need to lower the consumption of red meat just that maybe the figures you are showing don't cover even the surface level of the argument. We all know you are pro-green initiatives but maybe do some better research on the green ideas you are presenting.
We all know vegans and vegetarians fart more than anybody and produce copious amounts of methane. Far more than meat eaters.
I'm not going to switch to a vegitarian/vegan diet r a diet consiting of lab 'grown' meat.
The emissions chart is flawed in the same way the data is always skewed by activists.  Cows don't release any *net* emission of gas. Cows first remove emissions from the atmosphere, then return those same emissions, for a net change of ZERO. The actual emissions released are only from the machinery, and are *less* in total than agriculture. The chart also conveniently ignores the emission heavy plants like Avocados. I stopped watching at that point, because it is clearly a very biased video pretending to be objective.
share the video please and make changes.
"Meat" isn't even food, it's someone's body.
Let's talk about fishing
can't we just eat insects?, they give a lot more protiens. And they cost a lot less food
Certainly is for the animals you eat. Veggie since 1982 👍
Not eating meat is literally unhealthy. End of story.
I would be nice if we had factory’s here instead of buying from places that don’t care about the earth or people that work their
Please do another space video soon!
But, but, but asado is sooooo gooood
You knew what you were doing in those first 10 seconds 😂
I love these videos but I'm not gonna lie, the first sentence of this video is something i disagree strongly with. Food is nice but I feel like a parasite every time i bite and chew, and feeling like a parasite is not nice.
0:01 why there’s a chicken?
My fave meat hate fake fact is that beef uses an insane amount of water when in reality most of the water used to produce beef is rainwater on to grass
This is the entire reason I’m vegan. People tell me “but humans are supposed to eat meat!” Like yeah, of course, but WAY less than most people do (even outside of the “western world”).
A few days ago, I made my 17 year anniversary of being vegetarian!! If if could live another life, I would do it again! I’ll never forget how energetic and lighter my body felt after making the change.
I am going to eat more meat now 🥩 🍖🥓
Nobody busts quicker than Just Some Guy Without a Mustache
I think Kurzgesagt avoids giving a bottom line answer to these big topics, since it can lead to fights and heavy criticism. Some of us just want the YES or the NO. Do I stop eating meat or NOT my guys????
this is all well and good, but shouldn't we focus on factories and such? Don't they produce about 50% of emissions? It's been a while since I last checked, so maybe I'm wrong...
Plants can't run.
So how plant based food transport on global scale and still need last mile delivery is more efficient, than meat that is only using last mile delivery? I’m disappointed you compare two that aren’t compare.
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive" I don't know, there is also se- "Enjoyed multiple time everyday" Oh, I see your point.
Short answer: yes Long answer: yes
Always easier for people in first world nations to pick at these topics when the rest of the world can only dream of eating steak.  God bless the bit of stewed pig head and tin mackerel i been chewing on the last week. Chicken prices are so wild I can't buy that except occasionally.  I often times watch yt videos about how people keep in usa keep their dogs healthy with organ meat and the dog gets more meat and organ meat in a day than I do in three. I'm not searching for sympathy but man, sure is irritating to hear debates on meat ethics. Not that it shouldn't be discussed
you really picked up the paste of your uploads from 1.75months to 4 weeks
Wow I didn’t realize they burnt down forests for farm land that’s brutal 😯 very, very wasteful.
Honest question here. Without human intervention, would there be more or less methane-producing bio mass? I mean, less animals that produce methane. If so, is the argument about methane actually suggesting that having less mammals is a good thing? Is making the world mostly plant-based a solution to green house emission, surely, but is this coherent as an argument against eating meat?
cool video as always  But only scratching the surface really. no talk about the nutritive aspect / impact on health etc...
Tbh, I was thinking of going vegetarian but I would eat meat rarely because I like it very much. So... this video actually helped me! Also, very interesting congratulations once again! I will be back to tell you guys what I am feeling from this lifestyle! Cya in a month :D
Just stop eating food dude if u r so concerned better to die then live through this bullshit
Kurzgesagt is gonna be taken out by Big Local for this one.
What about the fact that a lot of animal feed is part of the crop waste?  Corn husks for example, are something that humans don't eat but we can and do feed to animals. There's large amounts of materiel that would otherwise just go to waste which your stats don't cover.
For people not sure if they should stop eating meat because their reduction in personal contribution to global emissions would not make a dent anyway. Consider this:  The more people eat meat, the more it is the norm, the easier it is for people to justify eating meat. On the other hand, the less people eat meat, the harder it is. Not eating meat makes it more likely people around you choose to not eat meat.  The more people eat meat, the more revenue the meat industry will generate, the more it can grow/maintain. The less people eat meat, the more it will shrink.   This is just the rough idea, one could come up with more of these the more/the less paragraphs, but notice that stopping eating meat not just reduces your personal emisions, a very linear result, but it also contributes to an amplifying feedback loop that pushes the entire system towards sustainability.
This is actually what we do in our state: Non-veg is considered as a specialty or something that you can only eat on special occasions (This was followed before due to how poor the economy was and people can't even afford 1Kg of rice, meat was such a delicacy ). We still follow this to an extent where we eat meat only twice or thrice a month . It's not that we cant afford it now but we simply decide to consume less of it.
Nice. Just wish there was more about the ethics. Maybe that's a different video though? Even if there was no impact on the environment it's still immoral to eat sentient being that are bred into a life of pure suffering for your appetite. All this doesn't even matter. It's like debating if serial killers should get a traffic citation or not. Stop eating meat because it can't exist without torture and murder. And you pay for that to happen when you buy it. That's all you need to know.
There's no climate crisis or climate change, the sun is biggest variable in temperature changes
lot's of local transport in poland is done by EV
A lot of half truths on this video.
I used to eat all kinds of meat till 2019 November. After that i left meat due to CO2 emissions, now my reason also includes animal cruelty. I will go vegan next year. We humans have caoabil
What about all the CO2 human produce by farting? I'm not saying this to be immature. I'm being dead serious.
4:43 can someone tell me how delivery emits 18 kg of CO2 per 1 kg beef?  That doesn't even make sense. Does shipping meat across the country in a semi really burn Several times its mass In fuel?  I call bullshit, fuel costs money, and that is completely uneconomical.
The fact that despite all of this information the United States continues to subsidize meat production is indefensible. Tax it.
I personally think that it's extremely unrealistic to expect us to completely get rid of meat in the near future. Even if everyone on the planet turned vegan, we still have billions of livestock animals that we have to get rid of somehow.  That being said, I think it's also important to note how much demand for meat has gone up in the past 30 years. It used to be considered luxury food but now many families practically eat meat every single day and don't really consider a dish complete without it. Iirc studies have shown that Americans households eat 5 servings of red and processed meat per week, while Europeans eat between 2-4 servings per week, depending on the individual countries.   But while we can't give up meat (and god knows how much I love me some poultry), it's good to try and incentivise eating less of it. It would go a long way if everyone in the world (or at least as many people as possible) participated in Meatless Monday, and some coherent nutrition guidelines actually came out.
Matter isn't created or destroyed without a nuclear reaction. Cows aren't creating carbon. They eat carbon and then release it. This video completely disregards that fact.   What we need to focus on is: why is more carbon being added to the cycle? The answer is we're pulling up carbon from deep in the earth and then releasing it into the air via natural gas, coal, and oil.  Not only are videos like this very wrong, they also hurt our ability to work together on this problem. You're just making enemies of meat eaters, not winning allies in the fight against climate change. Renewables and nuclear are the answer, not taking a narrow view of emissions that doesn't factor in consumption of carbon.
You made my Monday milk less  You made my veggies poison less   Now you made my life meat less 🥺🥺
What about the 75% that's not food related emissions instead of focusing on the 25% of meat
Meat isn't bad, it's feeding and raising the animals that are because it costs a lot of resources. Animals don't turn 100% of what they eat into meat, there is a lot of waste along the way as the animal needs to use most of it to simply stay alive, rather than to grow. Lab grown meat should help with that by using far less resources to produce the same amount of meat.  Also, I'm curious to know whether the emissions comparisons consider how the whole animal is used, or if it just looks at the meat. After all the guts, skin and bones of animals are also used, but often for things other than as human food.
Important factor - crops take a lot of land and water that could be used for growing trees. Espetially soy.
Yes, it is.
no.
Well I guess the narrator has never had/ heard of s3x
I dont care what this video says eat meat.   Don't be a soy boy beta
What about game? Hunting you own food? I know most people think it is absurd, and moraly wrong, but i disagree. It is actually sustainable and better for the environment (if done properly)
So basically we’re fucked lmao. The population is just getting bigger and we’re gonna need all that forest land eventually to build homes for future humans. Might as well invest in space exploration. Our only hope.
0:04 Ummmmmmmmmmmm  Do we need to have the birds and bee talk?!? 🤣
I mean yeah, but what about food consumption according to income and wealth? Enough of blaming the poor for pollution when rich countries pollute the most and consume the most meat.
We are fucked.
Keep getting money from Bill Gates and lying in your propaganda. Just eating 2lbs of steak  watching this and laughing at you.
conclusion, I will keep eating meat and I will not feel bad about it. or at the very least I'm not going to consider changing it drastically until billionaire companies stop getting rich killing the atmosphere.
Basically the price of meat has to go up, so less will be bought and thus less farmland needs to be used and less cows that produce methan.
8:32 Keep in mind that the crop feed that is fed to sheep and cows for example is not the part of the crops we eat. sheeps and cows are not given the grains of wheat for example, but eat the husks instead, things we can't use anyway.
"Hek - tares"
It may be me but it seems there's something off with this video animations.
I love this channel so much
To be honest, I will gladly sacrifice all of the Polar Bears if it means I can still order a Ribeye.
Did I miss it or did you guys not mention/cover artificially grown meat? The meat grown in laboratories which is more environmentally friendly if I'm not misteakin'.
4:30 Comparing national fruits shipping to local meat shipping. How does that make it a fair comparison? national vs national and local vs local
What do we learn: The best way to sustain the World is by leaving it as it is and completely live like it used to be a few thousand years ago!
the graph at 9:33 is pretty misleading, comparing a per 100 years stat with a per year stat, which makes it seem like the CO2 removed is higher than the CO2 emitted.(an actual comparison would be 8 billion tons per year vs 50 billion tons per year, or maybe 800 billion per century vs 5 trillion per century). I'm pretty disappointed you guys did this.
Meats just too tasty mhmmmm
Love the information in this video but one part that I feel is overlooked is that every counties ecosystem is different and what can be farmed in those areas and climates can be very different.
One more thing to consider is that most of any grain plant is inedible. Only the seeds can be eaten by humans. The rest can be eaten by cows and turned into human edible food
Thank you for the video.
A video suggestion. The blue revolution and how it could offset climate change, feed the world, and lower ocean acidity.
The conclusion points out something that a lot people that rage about the "20% of companies that make up 70% of emissions" thinking that they ought to fix that with zero sacrifice in our comfort
I would argue it's less of a personal responsibility issue and more so we need better regulations and checks in place to prevent shit like deforestation.  I would even wager we should also investigate into our supply chain to see if we can better optimize and prevent meat going to waste.
Good Vid! Plantbased as the normal baseline couldn't come soon enough!
Wait, didn't they already make a video on meat?
may ı ask what about fish ?
I appreciate the moderate view on this issue and the acknowledgment of how important meat is to cultures around the world. Personally most vegans have turned me against their message by attempting to shame those that consume meat. I try to consume mostly poultry or fish these days to cut my impact, but plant based diet is not for me.
8:15 Negative Stonks  People who discourage eating meat don't give alternatives. It's the equivalent of saying "don't be depressed, be happy"
We're all screwed :)
3 hours in. LOVE YOUR VIDEOS!!!
Dislike
I only eat meat now
This channel is seeming pretty wishy washy in narrative when compared to the "Can you fix climate change" video. Definitely question the financial motivations of this channel before you decide to make any change.
meat good. simple.
I think regulations are more important than individuals changing their diets
fuck the meat industry... going vegan is easyyyy
Any particular reason why you guys left fish and seafood out of this video?
i can't wait for What I've Learned to make a response video without calling it a response video and explain how "IT'S NOT THAT BAD" using biased sources and calling said biased sources valid because he's arguing for that point. the only thing he has right is that the US beef industry is highly efficient and self sustainable. but that doesn't excuse how shit it is in the rest of the world.
Wouldn't the entire human race switching to 100% meat free diet actually use much much more land for agriculture? What of the animals used for meat then? Do we just let them die off? Because they won't survive on their own.
I personally realy don't like eating
Kurzgesagt mentioned the vegan diet and the suffering of animals(partially)!!! I'm crying from happiness 😭😻!!! 🌱
BEEF
Dang this video is probably disliked to all living hell . But we wouldn’t know now would we .
Thank you for making the arguments for this more clear
*beef stonks*
very interesting, thank you!
Did you take into considération the CO2 absorbed by pastures ? And the cost of what it should mean for human food crops if we don't use manure anymore ?
No.
Mii thane
You missed out on a couple things. The transport of vegetables from ship to shop (which would be comparable to movement of beef) because you have to move food inland. Also, what about the impact of a vegan/vegetarian diet on peoples health? Also, don't forget about the ecological damage long distance shipping causes. There's more to this conversation for sure, you only hit the tip of the iceburg here, I'd like to see more.
Holy hell STOP blaming food for global warming, it's distracting us from REAL problem - burning fossil fuels (I wouldn't be surprised if this was done purposefully by oil industry). Meat has been in our diet for millenia and it didn't cause any problems. Two main changes that happened over the last 200 years: fossil fuel and there's much more people on this planet. So focus on THESE issues, not a cow that burps methane. Before Europeans came to America, there were as many bisons roaming the continent as there are cows on farms today. So their burping is completely irrelevant.
Nice video
people know smoking is harmful, it won't stop them smoking..
Fine. Vegans are doing the more ethical thing. I can't find up meat though, not until it's easier sorry
I had tofurky for thanksgiving
So if we ate 1/10 of our current beef production as grass fed then it would work 🥴. Won’t happen lol, but I still only buy grass fed beef for health reasons.
9:32 this graph may not have been the best choice. A direct comparison between two things measured at different rates is difficult to understand at best, and deceptive at worst.
how about you guys  stick to making videos about things straight out of a textbook, just like the immunsystem series. You don't have the right qualifications for more complex videos
Meat is what got us to the very top of Earth's food chain, so it is more than food; it is to be worshipped
Meat is good.
just plant more damn tree fucksake
We're all gunna fuckin die.
look at likes
meat
Video suggestion: Can you do a video on the mammoth plain it's supposed to be better than forests for collecting and storing methane
We love your videos and accept and expect the existential dread that comes with each. Hopefully lab grown meat saves us, because we are hooked on animal flesh as a species.
5:08 Something I really dislike about the argument used that methane 'only' lasts ~10 years, even of it does have a stronger warming effect than CO2, is that atmospheric methane mainly decays/reacts to form carbon dioxide.  So even after the methane is gone, the initial emissions are still having a warming effect.
Watching this video while eating
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive"  Ok but let me introduce you to memes.
Yea ima go buy some Five Guys. Nice animations tho!
Kurzgesagt waiting for the dislike button to disappear before releasing a pro-vegan video.
theres only 2 solution,  dont eat and less people
New Zealand beef emits 22kg of CO2 and Lamb 19 Kg, so eat New Zealand beef and lamb
Fair play, this is a good video.
I'll sum up the video for you. IF you have the means and the access fresh produce, stop eating meat. That includes seafood. It's as simple as that.
nice try, Bill...
i have still yet to try lab-grown meat but the concept interests the hell out of me, i’ll have to give it a shot soon
If we remove a few hundred million people we simply don't need those 3 billion hectares.
Who else found out that the ducks are eating their cousins
Sooooo essentially we need to just stop eating beef and lamb. Gotcha.
Isn't it a bit disingenuous to show a bar graph comparing "emissions per year" with "absorption over a CENTURY"?
We don't NEED to USE ALL land...
If beef / meat is much more nutrient-dense than a veggie diet, would it not hold that more space would be needed to produce for a vegan diet, than a beef diet?
Continue the amazing job
you didn't include the emissions from building the cargo ships ;-)
How much emission does 3D printing beef?
I'd have loved some info on fish in the "meat" category for fishtarian diets.
Ok
Me watching it as I'm mauling beef from the pot. Ps. I wanna be a vegetarian:(
Really hope that misleading graphs like the one at 9:30 don't become a trend for the channel.
Unsubscribed. That's enough of your idiotic propaganda for me.
Didn’t you already say it was in another video?! You telling me you were wrong? Make up your minds guys.
This bullcrap fails to acknowledge the harsh truth about factory farming , that most diseases and parasites come from factory farming. making it not nearly as efficient as u say it is for the environment
The cognitive dissonance is real. The video pretty simply and clearly lays out the information and half of the comments are like 'hmmm well I guess it's just complicated! guess I'll do absolutely nothing differently given the nuances and complexities of this subject 🤡'
Question, and I think it was skipped over in the video. Wouldn't the carbon footprint be significantly lower for local beef if everyone drove electric cars? Because most of the carbon is produced by vehicles used to transport the beef
What is the avg emissions off a human. which generation they were born will give multiple avgs and projections can be estimated for new generations. also geography right? could also compare a green person vs polluting person within respective sample
There is no climate change. There is the weather. The end.
no one is ready to have the conversation that would solve most of our issues. less humans. people need to stop having 3-5 kids. its not needed in most areas of the world anymore. the highest birthrate per family is usually 3rd world country's. how to solve this issue well far short of a gynecide, I don't know. its hard to tell a human you cant have children but you need a license for everything now days, maybe we need one to have children. verify you can afford to and intellectually raise children would be a start. would help with all the government assistance as well.
I’m sticking with beef until it becomes  Illegal or some shit
me eating beef stew rn while watching the video
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old." I beg tp differ.
Wait sorry are those birds in this video eating chicken? Is that cannibalism?
Od rather eat meat
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive” Anorexics: -_-
There is another aspect. You can add CO2 in soil by grazing cows properly (regenative agricalture).  And Natural grasslands in brittle environment need large herding animals to survive. without them  grasslands are desertifying. You shoud check out Allan Savory books or ted ted talk
I dont really understand. Most sources i read says that buying local food is infact matters a lot. While container ships are efficent, the land transportation is not that much.
Yooo. Check out Fabio cow over here!  5:58
Still haven't let me down guys... You always make me think you will but you don't. I appreciate the way you try to appear unbiased. Great work! ♥️ (long time vegetarian speaking xD)
Is meat bad? Great question, great video. The moral implications of meat consumption, especially by virtue of industrial practices, will be something the future descendants will look upon with shock. At least that's what I think will happen.
Hemen turkce altyazi gelir umarim 🙏
Yeah 71 kg per 1 kg meal. Guys you must use facts
5:06 - does that mean focusing on cutting sources of methane will have more immediate benefits than the same CO2 equivalent of CO2?
I am indian we can't eat beef but when I saw the thumbnail I was like what the f
The thing we will never forget about november 30th 2021. the minecraft cave update, Kurzgesagt uploaded!
Lets see a breakdown on pollution and environmental impact of meat vs plant based argri as well as solutions, active or passive to these problems. Carbon impact is often the argument against meat but what about other factors ?
You can find solutions in beef production if you think creatively. Ideally beef production should be reduced in favor of poultry and pork, but not eliminated entirely. There are other facets to eating beyond pure calorie intake. Humans need the vitamins and nutrients of a balanced omnivorous diet. The ketogenic and paleo diets emulate a more hunter and gatherer lifestyle they are in my view flawed. I hold the same view in regards to the extreme veganism. Humans are surprisingly complex and any solution regarding our diet must be thoroughly reviewed and tested for validity, sustainability, and diversity. Validity means that the diet must meet the minimum nutrition requirements of a human body within two or three meals a day without external support from artificial supplements. Sustainability speaks for itself, the diet must be able to meet the demand of the global population while having a minimum impact on the world. Diversity while seemingly odd in regards to a diet is one of the most critical aspects to a diet. Diversity can establish redundancies in the case of crop failure, allergies or individual distaste while also providing stimulation to the five senses. This is a very tall order and quite possibly impossible to achieve, but anything is possible and who knows what the future may bring.
This was such a well presented and well-balanced fact-based research video. Really appreciate all the efforts!
I really don't think that a hundred years of industry is going to destroy a planet that's been around for 4 billion years. It's all a lie lie lie lie
I feel like the mention of beef stocks crashing due to switching to grass-fed beef is misleading, considering that the argument here is that eating meat, and especially beef is damaging to the climate. If we eat less beef, no matter the reason, results will be the same. I think the actual argument here is more nuanced, but I realize it can be hard to add everything to a video that you're trying to keep interesting and short.
Skillshare looks nice, but it costs 1/20 of the yearly basic income here in the 3rd world :(
In the transportation part you ignored the fact that veggies ALSO need to be transported locally on top of the international transport so the footprint is highly innacurate
One dislike on behalf of me.
KWAAAA! love black duck plushy! didn't expect it will be so big :D great idea with bean bag on bottom
en serio, when is the "Well... it's complicated" shirt coming out? :P
this video makes me want to burn a forest
This doesn't solve the root cause. Human population that is reaching 8 billion and beyond is the main issue here. Vegan or not, if we reach 10 billion humans, there will no room for nature, agriculture, and whatever.  Population is the issue, not the diet. Any living being would face issues, even if you're a deer or lion. Everything proposed as a solution climate change so far is still human-centric, That's why we can't solve anything.
The other catch about methane is that when it breaks down, it breaks down into CO2 and water....
I'm confident this video was made because of What I've Learned's video on cattle. His video has much more information and it debunks a lot of this video.
Just stop eating beef💁🏻‍♂️
The only thing ive learned over the years is that we're fucked, no matter what we do. Cant eat meat, cant eat fish, cant eat plants. The problem is over conumerism and over population i guess.
I was today years old when I figured out that the monkey in the intro holds something relevant to the topic. For instance, the cow haha
Fck it, abuse the animals more if it helps the environment
People will choose to die before giving up meat but this video was spectacular nonetheless.
A bit wierd to go on about how grass isnt enough to sustain cows when cows feed on byproducts of crops that humans cant digest. Which is on its own already waste friendly
Vegan "meat" tastes like shit, nothing is comparable to the real thing so it really doesn't matter the impact to the environment, no matter how many doomsday scenarios I see on YouTube, meat will always be the number one food on my plate everyday.
Thanks for the good research (according to my current knowledge)! Pretty incredible how much easily understandable information was stuffed in this small video.
commies !
'Is Meat Bad for You? Kurzgesagt Response' By Mic the Vegan.
9:26 800B in hundred years, avg. 8B in 1 year, we produce 50B in 1 year that's 16% less CO2 if we completely go vegan....   Kurgzest seemed a bit confused there
No. It tastes good. Therefore it doesnt taste bad. Thats what i assume the title is talking about at least
Lmao soy boys in comments thinking your diet as any impact on climate change 🤣 😂
aaaaaaand ordered from burger king
Well measuring per calorie emmision isn't accurate either, not every calorie are equal, net protein utilisation makes a huge difference, not all proteins are made equal either.
"You can decide for yourself what you  want to do with this information."   I want to eat meat, but I also want there to be snow...
I love how you teach us
I did an entire internship on this life cycle analysis content. It’s great to see it applied to food now
The sad burger bird is making me sad cause it look so sad :(
Almost everyone is dancing around the issue if we where serious about the environment and emissions we should limit china's production infrastructure emission generated per year
Humans need to consume less meat.  BUT I'd rather die rn than go vegan
What about lab-grown meat? Are there enough data yet to make informed decisions? I think this could at least have the potential to vastly decrease emissioins.
I was just about go for a burger (beef, bacon, cheese etc). This would be my first meat in about 10 days... But I guess it's gonna be hallumi burger instead. But, to be honest, they are great too :)
Cows throw CO2 in the atmosphere, but the CO2 is catched by the pastures (through photosynthesis) and then eaten by the cows. Was it considered in the values shown in the video? The methane in the atmophere almost totally comes from oil extraction. It's not ok to blame the poor cows for it.
dont let that vegan teacher see this
Plant-based foods, specifically organic foods, often rely on livestock production. Byproduct of livestock production is manure. This is used throughout the agriculture industry to enrich soils.  Currently many farms use mined phosphorus  to fertilize their fields. But this is a finite resource and it is being depleted quickly.  Resting fields and planting with cover crops do help rehabilitate the soil but so does resting the field as pasture for livestock. Food systems are exceedingly complicated and it's likely that no one solution will be the magic bullet to solve our climate problems.
The only meat I eat is Deer, Moose, and bear.  I hunt for my meat I don’t buy it in stores.
The fact I hate the most is that meat is a good source of some nutrients and vitamins, yes...but we throw away SO much. We slaughter cows and use tons of parts from them, but when the time comes to talk about the meat its a jumbled mess.  Some countries actually have cultural problems around the meat cuts they consume or not, so tons of meat might end up wasted or rotting away if you are not crafty enough to use it for things like meat stock, pet food or even gelatin production. It can also be generational.  The thing that will always annoy me about meat production is the fact that tons of the meat might get wasted if you are not careful, and that just sits so wrong with me.  An animal grew, was slaughtered and butchered for humans to consume it...and sometimes we might eat SOME of that animal, the rest of it might go to absolute waste. It just so wasteful and somehow cruel; if you are going to kill a cow, eat the whole damn cow. We use the bones, the hair, the leather. Intestines are the only thing we don't eat and we used them for tennis strings for years. Horns were used for buttons, and in Argentina we still use horns and hooves for some Mate bowls.  Wasteful consumption (or lack thereof) of meat is also a huge problem that the meat industry has, aside from the use of lands, and the awful conditions we have to grow the animals in order to get more meat (that will actually go to waste anyway!).
Good Hindus don't eat Beef. Proud to be a Hindu.
I'd give up beef forever If I just got to hug  a cow there so gentle when there calm
Baby steps are for babies. Go Vegan today.
I am 17, the world I will live in will be far more different than you guys lived in. Maybe there won’t be one at all.   Think about this guys, the pleasures you enjoy, we wouldn’t even have a chance to fight for. I know that rich countries and short-sighted individuals won’t let it be an easy ride, but couldn’t you just do something which doesn’t affect your life much but has a positive effect on the environment.  I am not asking you to not eat beef, or do anything for that matter, but I don’t wanna be in that generation which sees their life cut short because of climate change.
Yes how ironic. The way to go is unethical farming or to slaughter our livestock for most of which will not be able to survive without us in nature. Maybe we all should just cast ourselves off cliffs for that would have a much more immediate impact.     Regardless just from the comments it seems you're preaching to the choir and even if there is one percent of people that watch this video who are on the fence that you convinced. It changes nothing. For to change most people's lifestyle on earth you would need to either for them to feel immediately in danger or through threat of force and there's not enough force in the world to change it and judging by how there's people living in places that they have to wear masks so they don't breathe in the thick industrial smog that lingers in the air yet they still don't charge their way. the former seems equally unlikely. This video is an example of futility which I find reassuring.          Regardless of what happens life will continue on. I fail to see why just because humans is the spearheads of this more recent change on Earth that we should stop everything that we're doing.
Every vegan within a 50 mile radius:          👁️ 👄 👁️
Didn't watch the video but no it isn't...
What does it mean that food production alone would use up all of our "Carbon budget" by 2100?  If food alone does that, that would theoretically mean that it would only take about 20 years with all of our current emissions to use up our "carbon budget".  What happens in 20 years if nothing changes?  I'm 32 years old.  Should I expect to see major and drastic changes to the world within my lifetime due to this?  What can I expect to see happening?
one argument that got missed is: Overall human health would drastically be impacted if meat was no longer consumed. Not to mention, that the so called Carbon-Budget is itself a politically slanted target and the climate is far far more complex than a simple measurement of gas emissions. Also, a warmer world would mean extended growing seasons and better environments for farming globally speaking. So really, a warmer planet, like that of the era of the roman warm period (still warmer than today by a few degrees) is beneficial.
As a bull.  I find this topic very fascinating an important. Thanks Kurzgesagt for the bovine mascot! And a hardy Moo for the rest of Mootube.
Short answer: "Yes" Let's go vegan! 💚
I still think we should just ditch animal rearing and just grow the meat we eat directly. Read a book where this farm on an alien world had racks of nonsentient muscle mass growing and having electrical stimulation move the muscles around to stimulate growth.
I've never heard hectare pronounced "hectair"
This is misinformation. The largest amount of CO2eq emissions for beef IS NOT methane from cow farts, it's from having to transport kgs over kgs of feed towards the cows. That is why grassfed is so much better than factory farmed trash. And the impact of methane on human-made global warming is about 3%, not 25%. Also it's not just 13% grass-fed beef worldwide but rather 35%. Maybe not exactly grass-fed but in the efficient category of a very prominent WHO study where for example plant waste products are upcycled into meat. Chicken don't exclusively eat feed crops. They are specialist carnivores, they thrive on bugs, slugs and worms etc.
Thanks for existing. One of the few channels im literally learning something new on every video. I love it
So... seafood?
Do you have beef with meat?
Not to be NSFW on main but I think there are multiple bodily pleasures that can be enjoyed multiple times per day and never get old.  Like the obvious one comes to mind, but some people like walking multiple times per day, or doing stretches, or scrubbing their face.  Cute line but I call shenanigans
Meat production might be bad for the environment, but you know who fucks the environment the most? Big oil. Knowingly destroying the environment and discouraging renewable energy so they can be rich
I am really dissapointed in this video. Dont get me wrong , i love Kurzgesagt and i have probably been subscribed for 4 - 5 years.  But the fact that they overlooked probably one most important factors of this debate and posted the video without proper research and context behind the numbers makes me kinda mad.  When you farm wheat (used for making flour and bread) as an example, only a very small percentage of the plant is edible to humans.    We pick out the small wheat kernels and then we throw away more than 80% (by weight)of the plant - because we just cant eat it! Thats where cows come in. Those 80% of the plant - that we would usually throw away,burn or maybe use for some other industry - can be eaten by cows.  This means that you have to take this in to consideration when you state that   "49% of soy production goes to cows while only 48% go to humans" (paraphrasing).  What if those 49% which are given to cows are not even edible by humans in the first place!  Also the enviromental implications of being able to grow a crop that feeds humans AND feeds cows are huge. The potential to setup super effective farms that can use the bi-product from one food industry to sustain another is literally the kind of technology that can save our world.  The fact that this is not talked about in the video and that the numbers are not clarified is terrible.  What does those percentages mean? Weight, Volume , Calories?  Hopefully this comment gets some traction and Kurzgesagt gets a chance to clarify all of this...
Meat eating is a thing that most predator do, and humans for hunred thousand year.  Also quite important nutrient, protein and other element source If the best case sceranio of meat eating is insufficent to live with the climate change, isn't this mean that we are overpopulated?
I'd love a follow up story on which type of meat is the least environmentally damaging. Because as much as I love fish its expensive and overfishing is an issue. Even with farm raised fish we run into the feeding crop issue that we do with Chicken and Pigs
What I got out of this is that bacon is awesome
I love your content could you make a video on insects as a food soure  I did a school  presentazion on Meat atanatives an found out that the most climate frinedly is  oisters, frogs, and insects
Very nice channel
Just give me a good and cheap lab meat!  I won't eat 2-3x more food to have the same amount of protein I consume daily. I love food but I can't eat too much food at all due to childhood issues.
Nice one vegans, I'm still gonna eat beef tho
Turkish subtitles pls
So this complicated animated short film with so much information is just there to make us feel bad for being happy. Please let us be T-T
I'll eat what my body is designed too, aka, I'll eat meat and veggies
The problem isn't what people eat, it's the number of people.
in Brazil they don't cut the rainforest to raise cattle, most of the cattle come from the cerrado, which would be something like the savannah. It's a common mistake people make when they talk about raising cattle here and the same is true for soy
Use Me as a dislike button
The title is so stupid. I never thought of it being bad to begin with.
Is that a Jojos Stone Ocean reference?? 5:27
The fact the bird at the very end didn’t die after pulling off the cow hat is very upsetting 😭 XD
at 9:33 the information is presented in a way that could be interpreted as devious, since over the same time period we would be producing a lot more CO2 than what is removed. I'm not against climate prevention efforts but if we're trying to convince people it's bad we should be completely honest to avoid tarneshing the reputation of this cause. especially if it's coming from this channel.  other than that your work is stellar and very mutch appreciated as always.
in america buying locally doesnt mean having farmer john drive it to your house every day in his pickup
I'm making it a tradition of buying your team's calendar every year. I would never spend more than what I need to on anything really unless I know its worth it. And your team is. Thanks for keeping learning fun even in my adult life.
I find the arguments put forward by What I've Learned's video much more compelling. I am a meat eater but I think there are better things to focus on rather than this herding cats approach of individual sacrifices will fix the problem. Commissioning nuclear power and decommissioning fossil fuel would be an example where the population's emissions can be reduced without expecting millions of people to maintain making the "correct choices"
I wanna point something out, (I will edit this if he mentions it later in the video)  near the beginning he says that food is 26% of all CO2 human emissions. Note that he says human emissions and not world emissions. Idk why he left this out because all CO2 human emissions only contribute a small fraction of the total emissions. Can you please explain Kurzgesagt?
So if beef causes the most pollution, can't we just k$ll/eat up all the cows?  This should solve the problem.
Hei kurzgesagt, what would happen if every single person in the world plants 10 trees? I mean, we are 7.5 billions how many square km of forest would we gain? And what would be the impact on CO2 level in 10 years?
food 26%.. and the rest? please tell us what is the rest too.. is it from big corporation? or alien technology?   and its food alone will overtake by 2100 right? what if we combine it with the rest 74%? im just curious.
The biggest problem with this video is that it's a single variable analysis of a massively complex issue. It doesn't address the fact that farm land requires a large land area which leads to deforestation and importing water. All this to say that the sheer fact that life exists produces greenhouse gases so the solution is carbon capture and reducing greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere not reducing emissions because emissions will never be zero. Taking things to the extreme, if your goal is reducing emissions entirely then that leads to mass murder and genocide because that's a real argument that has been made by real people past and present.
Don't you think it's a little dishonest to fixate solely on beef and cattle, when a) you admit in the video that they're at the extreme end of the scale, and b) they're already forgone by a large number of meat eaters? This is like ignoring wind and solar power when talking about green energy sources.
what a wishy washy bullshit video. eating animals is unethical-- referring to them as merely "resources" is the epitome of callous disconnect . animals are life forms, deserving of respect, consent, and moral personhood. "decide for yourself what you want to do with this information"? for a channel that presents itself as dedicated to science, you sure did expose your own cognitive dissonance with this one. bad for the environment, bad for human health, bad for animals. bad on all fronts. "is meat really that bad?" Answer: yes. and to anyone saying "oh they wanted to stay objective" then they shouldn't have named the video "is meat really that bad?" because "bad" is a moral judgement. if you guys are too spineless to say "this is wrong" maybe instead name the video "is meat wasteful"-- of which the answer is also yes.  glad i never bought that poster from you clowns. unsubscribed.
From cows you also get leather and natural fertilizer.
Question: What about Fish and Aqua Foods like Crustations ?  If we remove beef from our diets, does switching to a Pesictarian diet help?  Also, its a tricky subject to tackle as we're still learning about the effects Cows produce on the environment and honestly, I could go my whole life without Beef, but Poltery , Fish, Pork and  Lamb are foods I like a lot and would find it harder to give up
Very happy to say I've become a vegetarian! After your last video about meat I was always wondering but a while ago, I made the decision and I must say, I only very rarely miss the taste of some things. It turned out to be quite easy :)
9:34 yeah... i don't like your misleading bars. 800B tonnes of CO2 is over 100 years, 50B tonnes is over 1 year. the numbers should be 800B tonnes and 5000B tonnes.
Dislike Button 🔴
I feel like this is missing the point.  Types of emissions matter.  Where the carbon originates from matters.  The carbon emitted from fossil fuels is carbon that was locked away for millions of years.  The carbon that cows emit was locked away for only a few years if not months in the grass and food they ate.  It was already on the surface of the earth in plants.  Plants that would  decay its carbon *mostly* back into the atmosphere anyway.  So saying that the transportation doesn't contribute much is really really problematic.  We NEED to keep fossil fuel and coal IN THE GROUND.
"No other body pleasure is enjoyed multiple times everyday, and never gets old" 👀
Just stop buying meat, learn new recipes. This video didn't even mention the ethics of treating animals like food slaves, pretty messed up to do that to our fellow earthlings
the thumbnail be like “meat love😍” like cmon that’s just sus that’s sus
If everyone reduced their meat consumption by half, it would be as if half of us went vegan.  If you have beef six times a week. Try only having it three times a week.  If you like having a double double at In-N-Out try only having a cheeseburger.  If you can do that, try  cutting it in half again it again.  Try having beef only on special occasions and instead using proteins with less carbon footprint.   Also if we stopped having so many children overall human carbon production would go down. The number one cause of carbon is a human being.
Lots of soy oil goes into biodiesel. Important to take into account.
Hey Kurzgesagt! I know that human going vegan/vegetarian will help the world pollution, but I'd like to know how real the ""free up land" and "CO2 removed" claim is. Let's say if I go vegan today, I stop eating any kind of meat, but I doubt the local market in this little village will reduce their chicken meat just because one person (me) in this 1000 population go vegan. And let's say if there are 10 of us in this village go vegan, enough to make the meat seller reduce their stock, but the local factory farm that produce meat for 2 millions people on this island (including our village) surely won't change how many chicken, cow, etc they breed per month/year. In this case, 10 of us didn't make any real change to this world, I know we will be healthier but the claim of "reducing X amount of pollution per year" seems disputable. I really love meat, chicken specifically. I don't think I will ever go vegetarian, I don't think the whole world will ever go vegetarian, but if there's a large production of substitutes for real meat, I guess it will help this world a lot.
So you’re saying that the more animals suffer the better it is for earth.
This channel has become propaganda for commies
Wait…y’all eat?!? 🤨
You might want to consider the cost to people's health/healthcare systems when eliminating meat for a high carb, plant based diet. People were all but physically beaten into believing they should avoid meat and eat more grains/sugar to improve their health around the 1960s+... what followed was the greatest increase in metabolic diseases, obesity, and heart disease ever seen in history. The combo of chemical plant crafted high omega-6 polyunsaturated vegetable/seed oils with the switch to a diet heavy in grains, corn, soy, potato, etc. was a 1-2 knockout punch to people's overall health. Now we know that animal products and monounsaturated and saturated fat are actually protective against these issues, and a high carbohydrate diet is the leading cause of most modern disease and healthcare cost.
Best as always Watching this video after german version
Sure, we can switch entirely from meat as a food source, but cows aren't only raised for it's meat, the milk industry, cheese industry, butter and leather all come from the very same cow. In terms of economic benefit, cows are the most efficient animal there is, nothing is wasted. Keep the cow industry growing, while simultaneously co-existing with non-meat alternatives is the way to go. Let people make their own choice, don't shove your ideas up their throats. That way, they choose their own style of living and is more likely to stick to that style compared to choosing it because of the influence of other people.
Lol all the people getting butt hurt bout their meat, sounds like arguments when people said oil cant run out
well ima stay non vegetarian lmao
Watching it while eating pig sausage.
aren't insects the most efficient? when It comes to proteins per kilo
I cannot get over him saying ME thane all video
That vegan teacher would be triggerd
So the most likely outcome continues to be self-destruction. Let's gooooooooooo.
Thanks for making another amazing video! Love the work you guys do!
Question, how bad would it be if we make plant absorb more CO2 ?
People who only eat chicken-Guess I don't have to change anything
watching this while eating a burger... whoops
Information should be unbiased so that we can create our own biases and debate with other strangers on the internet and fcuk up our good night sleep thinking about the debate.
Great i dont eat meat
I just want to know what the impact of practical solutions would be. What would happen if everyone switched from beef to plant based beef? There needs to be a comparison to the bigger picture.
You are the school I needed. You make me want to learn and cultivate myself, so much. You are an inspiration for us and for future generations who will be blessed to discover your hard-work. When I have kids, I will be so happy to see them discover the passion of learning new things through your videos.
Animal products are harmful to human health and the animal agriculture industry is extremely destructive to the environment and it's really messed up to torture and Slaughter billions of helpless, sentient beings when you live in a place and time where you can get all the food and nutrients you need without intentionally hurting others. If you get mad because some people eat dogs but you also eat cows and pigs which are just as intelligent and capable of affection and bonding with others, then you are a hypocrite.
what about seafood?
Oof! Well, I as an individual have a bit of a problem. I'm allergic to tomatoes. Now please, if you will, take a look at the ingredients list of every single plant based meat alternative and tell me how many have tomatoes, tomato paste, or something like that somewhere on that list. Yeah, it's the vast majority. In fact, my options for vegan food are so limited by my allergy, that I'd most likely literally die of malnutrition if I went vegan. So unfortunately, I don't really have a choice. I do appreciate the dairy free milk alternatives, though. My mother is lactose intolerant, so on her birthday, I made a chocolate pudding cake with almond-coconut milk instead of cow's milk and it tasted much better than the cow's milk variant! I do what I can and I appreciate what's available, but I do have my limits that are beyond my control.
At the base of the equation, people are the primary driver of climate change--our food, our fuel, our waste, our concrete, our manufacturing processes all drive climate change; which is why, at the heart of it, the phenomena of climate change is ultimately the product of overpopulation.
Should we go vegan? Short answer: Yes Long answer: This video*
:(   Was hoping more would be said on the suffering of the animals in agribusiness.
The book An omnivores dilemma discusses these topics in great detail
EAT THE BUGS!
Take care of the 100 companies that produced 75% of all C02 emissions since the late 80s. THEN come after my meat consumption.
Be vegan 🌱 💚
"Me-thane" - Kurzgesagt
the lesson here folks is that: climate change and veganism are 2 topics that are REALLY complicated and you shouldnt make your opinion based on 2 minutes of research. this video helps, but if you want to make the best option you NEED to research more
*Is BEEF Really that Bad?
Hello, folks talking about lab grown meats. Please remember that you can eat beans while you wait for lab grown meat to become available. Be the change you want to see in the world and stuff
Still no ethical arguments. Do you know you would lose that or is it just too difficult to use logic?
Reefer > food
ERGO: we have to immediately remove at least 99% humans from the climate equations
I already don’t eat meat like beef or lamb that often so I think I’m good
4:50 And how did the avocado's get to the ship? They walked there?
Consuming food releases (plants or animals) releases carbon. Reject humanity. Return to photosynthesis
What about lab made food
I don't give a shit what accent you have. If you fuck up the word tofu, you got issues.
We humans will always leave a carbon footprint,even if it gets a bit smaller.(I read your mind,I know you will criticise me but you know I'm right
Pork and ham. However it comes. It seems that a spiral ham is quite inexpensive toward the end of the year, especially in December. And pork, ham, and bacon are my favorite meat forms. (Spam notwithstanding.)
Climate Change: "Vostok Core and Milankovic Cycles"
This video seem like it's advocating for veganism and is delusions
Glad you mentioned the bit about factory farms, even if it's unfortunate. That's sort of a general trend, things people want to do to "get back to nature" (growing your own food, moving out into the countryside, etc) are often actually the worst things for the climate. Manhattan has some of the lowest emissions per capita of any part of the US, while rural Vermont has some of the highest. The best thing for the climate would be if we all lived in giant skyscrapers, never traveled, and got all of our food from factory farms.   That's a tricky thing about environmentalism in general, often a fix for one problem actually makes another problem worse (like organic food has far more carbon emissions per calorie).
Buy locally to support your local farmers and your local community’s economy. Don’t sell out local farmers for international TOFU. Illinois stands with Wisconsin and Illinois pig and cow farmers
ANDI Score (Nutrients/Calories) for Meat is 21, while potatoe is 28, Brocoli 340.  Meat is not that nutrient efficient... You retracted your Addiction video because of inaccuracies, what about this one?
Yes.
Thank you.
Very insightful information
I don’t really much so I’m not really going to change what I do. I cannot really eat a large amount of vegetables and I can’t stand imitation meat so normal meat is where I get most of my food.
after months. i realized the monke holds a diffrent object for each video.
soo... can I eat meat or nah?
But most of the cattle feed is made with food waste or parts of plants that humans cannot eat. I think that they should've included that as well.
Start : "The reality is : well it's complicated" End : "Food is a urge driver of emission. Meat but especially beef is the worst food"  Not that complicated ^^
This video is absolutely stuffed to the brim with misinformation
Should have mentioned that far more plant based foods are thrown away than meat products. This is also an important point to consider.
TLDR Yes
I guess eating meat is like sinning: it can be tempting, but we can overcome it with enough Determination.
everyone by gangsta till that vega teacher teacher makes a video on this XD
The transport part really shows us the ineficciency of cars.
Supporting factory farming? Wow
1.7k dislikes. Plenty of vegans I assume.
Thanks, Kurt n' Zack!   I will use this information to make some changes towards my attitudes and habits surrounding food.
One important thing you did not mention is hunting. I’d love to hear about how elk and boar affect local environments.
7:20 "Could that title be any longer?"
Meat is epic I will never stop eating beef, chicken, etc. Ever
Reduce your consumption, go veggie, go vegan :))))). Love you Kurzy
I wonder what the impact would be if we got over our animosity about eating insects. As far as I can figure out they have an extremely low impact and provide an excellent and healthy source of protein.
man, people gotta stop pedaling the "carbon footprint" thing. it was propaganda made by oil companies to convince individuals they are to blame.  They are also completely missing the carbon cycle. digging oil out of the ground and burning it is a one way street. a cow eating grass, emitting carbon, and that carbon growing back into grass growing back is a renewable cycle (at least to some extent, when compared to oil).  Still a great video as always, I love this channel :)
I don't think most of us show kindness to our meat. I mean, about half of us beat it all the time!
There's always a lot of focus on beef. The arguments against beef are very clear, but it'd be interesting to apply those to poultry and fish.  Many people do reduce their red meet consumption, but is it enough? Can a diet of poultry, fish and vegetarian meals can be sustainable?
Is direct carbon capture technology in development today able to capture methane and other greenhouse gasses? Or is it only limited to CO2
Grass fed beef emits more methane than grain fed! I feel like you're video was misleading in that point.
“Food is arguably the best part of being alive”  Literally I have never agreed so much with a sentence
Definitely don’t wanna leave this earth without knowing who’s behind this beautiful narration
I would love to see something on the topic of aquaponics powered by renewables.
Not going vegan but it's good to know this
Vegan since nearly 3 years and honestly it was the best decision in my life.
I encourage everyone to at least try going meat-free for at least a week. It's really not difficult at all with the amount of meat substitutes out there today! I found that meat wasn't even all that delicious to me, it's all in the seasoning of your food! Deciding if you'd like to go vegan from there is always an option, but going meat free is huge for our planet, reducing animal suffering, and affecting the profits of the meat industry (factory farming). Just give it a shot, it's really quite simple and your arteries will thank you.
You will eat ze bugs
Even if we lower our personal CO2 emissions by stopping eating beef, would that make that much of a difference in a global scale? I was waiting for this topic on this video.
The carnivore diet is extremely beneficial to your mental and physical health. This has been talked about with many doctors and psychologists and they have said that it improves mental health and overall physical health.
guys there is a clear solution         JUST DON'T EAT
vegans are not people
Also, it needs to be said that the Methane, while short lived, is destroyed by oxidizing ... in other words, it consumes breathable air and produces water vapor and carbon dioxide ... both long term greenhouse gasses (though, yes, there's some places that'd love a little extra water.)
You never discussed the issue with poor waste management which causes pollution and lack of biodiversity with factory farming which effects local biomes.
TLDR; Go vegan
Nice opinion. One small issue. Meats taste nice.
There is no limits of human's stupidity.   We fight over geographical, religious, cultural differences which are just waste of time.   We need to change ourselves according to the needs of our planet 🌍 but instead of that we put ourselves and our religion over everything   This kind of behaviour will definately going to destroy our planet with our own actions.
Vegatarian food stuffs are still ten to twenty times much more expensive throughout the world alas
how much does seaweeds suck co2 up
Heres an idea rather than pushing for veganism or vegetarianism why not push for meat as exotic food like champagne or any designer dress. Only limited amount of animal would be slaughtered in the most climate friendly environment and released into market so only higher bidder would have it. Plus like any high demand orders put a cap on individual order so as to avoid monopoly of seller would largest money. Remember a 2 century ago most of humanity was surviving in bread and potatoes. Meat used to be novelty eaten on festival or once a month if you made good money. Funny enough that time is what people now considered as healthy lifestyle. When we could have survived (thrived in other sectors) why not do the same now when its need of hour.
We really need a video about Xenobots
For all those asking why they didn't cover artificially produced meat - it's because it doesn't exist on a commercial scale yet. Nobody has managed to scale artificial meat production (as opposed to meat substitutes) to a scale where it's capable of being part of the solution. If it turns out to be possible to produce artificial meat cheaply en-masse then that would be great, but you can't rely on a technology that nobody has yet proved works (and is economically viable) on a large scale, and nobody is capable of predicting whether technology that doesn't currently exist might exist in the future. It's the same reason why nobody is going to suggest humanity will depend on nuclear fusion in a video on future energy - it'd be great if it became feasible, but nobody knows whether it ever will.
The more I learn about this topic the more I feel like moderation is going to be the big answer here. Portion sizes have GOT to play a part in all this. It has to be possible, to eat enough to fuel our bodies - and still FEEL like we've eaten enough. Speaking as a person who very much enjoys animal based proteins - not having ANY meat in my diet is depressing. Possible? Healthy? Yeah. But DEPRESSING. Why the hell should I want to live longer and healthier if I'm going to be miserable? "You'll live seven years longer if you give up bacon" - yeah no.  So then, finding ways to rethink what we "expect" to get on our plates makes the most sense. Of course meat demand is high - marketing has made it so, and that was on purpose. But what if we look at the dinners of the past? No, I don't mean the Middle Ages necessarily - but taking a good look at pre-Industrial age ways of eating might help inform us as to changes we can make NOW. We could learn a lot about what nutrition looked like back then - and adjust as needed to match our current understanding - a task that might be much EASIER today, since we do have a global economy and can transport foods from all over, or grow things in places they didn't originate from (with caution, of course). Too, we can alter our thinking from "a working man needs a lot of calories!" For SOME jobs that's still true, but the greater majority of folks have sedentary jobs or at the least, they aren't weeding fields and herding critters and other forms of back-breaking labor.  But the marketing schemes still want to portray "ideal dinner" as being the sort of thing that feeds a half dozen adult males who do hard labor all day long.  That's just not reality anymore, and the food industry doesn't want us to know that! SO figuring out how to change that, might be the most effective thing to do.
Cow meat production is very closely connected to milk production, because quite a few cows get slaughtered after they can't produce any more milk. I think it is wrong to only think of cows as meat producers when they also produce milk
Can we get a video that shows the issues with veganism and the lies they push to convince people that it's healthier?
first world problems when you know already the video ..
How does dairy and eggs compare to beef/meat in terms of emissions?
why does this video feel excessively long?
food stonks
vegan for the animals
9:21 - Wait, the comparison here seems a bit skewed.  The land would save 800 bil. tons of CO2 *over 100 years,* and we emit 50 bil. tons *per year.*  So wouldn't that mean we'd emit 5 trillion tons of CO2 over the same period of 100 years (50 bil. x 100 = 5,000 bil or 5 tril.)?  If so, then all this land is only sequestering... 16% of our total emissions over the same period of time?  It's a significant amount, for sure, but the graphic makes it look more like this one major change would fix the problem by itself.  All of ^this being said, I'm not saying this is a bad idea, by any stretch.  I recognize that tackling the climate crisis means have to implement a wide array of changes/fixes, and there isn't going to be one single thing that magically solves all our problems.  Incremental steps like a 1/6th reduction in emissions are still really good!  My comment here is more strictly about the implication made by the one graphic, rather than aiming to be a takedown of the entire video.
Dislike button counter post
This video gets progressively scarier and scarier lol
I wish this would have gone into CO² from other animals, seafood, and dairy
1:35 even if we deminish all other sources our carbon budget would be used up by 2100. Yeah that way we are doomed no matter what .... because it is calculated by ignoring all other factors.  That carbon in these emissions comes from the CO2 in the atmosphere. It is a cycle that goes through all lifeforms fueled by the Sun and photosynthesis. So no, as soon all other means (mainly transport and heating) come from renewable energy then these 26% are far less of a problem than this video makes it out to be. (If any) 4:40 Also, the comparison between the Avocado shiped between SA & EU and the local beef ... seriously ignoring the fact that the 1kg Avocados ALSO have to be shipped from the port to the store?! 4:50 is still a correct point but notbecause of this really bad shipping comparison, but because of your next point, that meat needs a lot of plants to grow at the rate we consume it at the moment. But in the end it comes down to the fact that NATURE has a cycle in place that makes carbon go thourgh all carbon-based life forms fueled by the sun with photosynthesis. The issue interfering with that cycle is carbon-fossil-fuel that was in the earth for millenia and is now burned in an exceeding rate.  I like Kurzgesagt, but this video is a good excapmle how to misread and misuse (can easily happen unintentionally) "science", data and facts in order to support one's view. If i got anything wrong, I'd be happy for anyone to point that out.
I don’t care meat is just good. Sorry.
I've been vegetarian for almost 3 decades, I wish people would not harass me about meat, when they used to see me.
Basically just eat less meat, good for environment and good for health.
Lol, so much propaganda 😂
There is also a grand problem in which continents cattle live and produce, for that I live in the Netherlands where the climate is superb for great production of diary for Europe. A country from Africa would not be able to to this like the scale the Netherlands does it.
Dislike ; Skip.
My diet is mostly beef pork and chicken and I'm not changing anything.
So just grow more trees and don't destroy land, got it.
So if 3 billion hectares would remove 800 billion co², then if we would spare just around 300 million hectares, would it slowly stop the 50 bilion emisions per year?
I think it should also be noted the nutritional benefits of meat and dairy a side from just protein and carbs some of the essential nutrients need for human growth and development are found in animal products, like how much dairy products are important for early stage development of children talking it away will almost always result in malnutrition and the substitutes for meat and diary are not as sufficient and to get all the needed nutrition from a vegan diet is way harder.
It baffles me that they just put data and statistics into an easily digestible format, and there are still people trying to argue with them and say they're trying to push a point. You're so deluded by your need to be privy to 'special information', that you can't even take facts at face value. You aren't special or intelligent just because you go against the 'norm' and ignore facts, you're just plain ignorant.
Really well explained, only if we combine local food production on grassland that is not suitable for crops, while eating 90%less meat would solve the problem right? Some conclusion like that would be nice on the end to get all the facts straight although I understand you want to leave it to peoples own decisions and interpretation
And that’s why I have no faith in stopping carbon emissions… I’m not going stop eating meat, and majority of others aren’t. The only solution is lab grown meat, but apparently that’s bad for the environment too… so… this is how the world ends…
What I'm curious about is why us humans aren't starting to move our agriculture into space.  After all, it's a win-win for the planet: More food can be produced up in space-based capsules than down here on Earth (and we can even use Luna, Mars, or Venus if a food requires gravity to properly grow, such as animal products), and it frees up land for other uses, such as energy production and carbon recapture.
haha ''what i learned'' was right lmao
Meat cell farming.  That's your answer.
I cut red meat/ pork / poultry around 7 years ago and then fish (never liked seafood that much anyway) but I believe it really depends on the person. In my case it made me fell better energy-wise/digestive-wise, but I have seen people open-mindedly and sincerely try it but had to step back reporting feeling weak or hungry all the time. I don't know the proportion of how much psychology vs. personal physiology play a role here.
But it's delicious.
Hold on you missed a stat. It's about the animal feed being something like 90% and up being made from chaff. Parts of the plants that we can't eat like corn husk wheat stalks ect.
just don’t eat
I will eat bacon.
I used to eat a lot of beef. I still eat beef sometimes, but I’ve mostly switched to lamb and chicken. It’s good to see that those use less energy.
I'm disappointed that the comparison is made to the  altruistic utopia where that land is converted directly into counter carbon fields. In reality what is always missing from the calculation is that the land is profitable in the current model and needs to do so in any future model. Its just as likely that that plant covered animal feed land would become houses, commercial property, or even factories. None of which would offset or dramatically produce a different result and potentially end in worse. Focus should be on how to drive the value of the land to producing clean air in addition to a different and marketable source of food. Then the shift to more rare and more expensive meat can be a reality. If it isn't market driven and that includes demand, it simply isn't likely to happen.
Yeah well, I really don't trust that much those numbers, and o won't ever go vegetarian or the extremist way: vegan
Damn. That's complicated.
Just let hunting become the norm again. Can't hunt a huge number of animals but enough too feed. Everyone does that and the world may spin
no documentary can make me go vegan but this video is making me seriously consider it. damn
So we had to start eating meat to evolve enough intelligence to know that eating meat is bad for the environment. Humans are walking disasters
I have a steak waiting on me
This should be the headline on veganism, it does not forceful trying to demonize meat eaters or gets too exaggerated about plants being environmentally friendly. It rules out facts and gives constructive yet easy to understand information about our world. After all it is our choice to change our behavior, this videos actually change my mind to more of a plant based diet and decrease meat consumption. Great video!
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive"  There are only virgins on the Kurzgesagt team.
"You can decide for yourself what you want to do with that information." The most important lesson to learn from these videos. Some people act, some acknowledge, some ignore and some oppose.
Answer: Technically no, but actually more yes-no.
Going to make a nice steak now.
I don't give a crap about the environment.
What if I grow my own chicken and don't buy from the shops? They make eggs and I've got meat from them and I barely use any land for that... I don't want to go vegan I've tried it and it's difficult
Interesting video, but have you considered this: Meat yummy
I am wondering how hunting compares when it comes to carbon emissions and such.
Lies in this video: 1. Grazing cows allow soil to sequester more carbon, to the point of being carbon neutral (How do you think millions of bison roamed many years ago and there was no problem then) 2. 13% of cows are pastured - false, 100% of cows spend 3/4 of their lives on pasture, then are fed 90% human-inedible grains in the last 1/4 3. The idea that humans could avoid eating meat. There are over 15 nutrients only found in meat that we cannot live without (you can manage for a few years, though) 4. Methane being a cow issue. There are many bigger sources of methane like swamps and natural gas. Cows are part of a natural cycle of producing and capturing carbon, oil is not    What I've Learned has a much better researched video on this with an actual climate expert.
5:33 This is going to awaken someones fetishes I can feel it
cars, planes, and most forms of transportation are even worse for the environment than beef. But most people need transportation. We all cant walk or bike to our jobs. I look at beef the same way.  Large industrial companies pollute the world more than your typical beef-eating neighbor. Humans are omnivores we are not rabbits. If you want to only eat plants be my guest...but you will need to supplement what you are not getting from your nutrient-deficient diet. I will never stop eating beef. Most women are deficient in iron. What is the best source? red meat. Also, there are the same amount of large ruminant animals today as there were 400 years ago roaming the prairies. So how are they worse now than they were back then? I am not saying that they don't pollute the earth, but I honestly think we are blaming the wrong thing. Humans and our polluting technology are the issue.
I mean, we should just eat less beef. The world stopped smoking and drinking soda pretty quickly. I feel like eating beef only once or twice  a month could be come a social norm pretty soon.
I really wanna know where "fishing" will fall on carbon emissions scale.
We are all going to die because the cows fart so much
Kurzgesagt: no it isn't.
My only real problem with the video is right at the end, that 800 Billion Tonnes graph compared with the 50 Billion Tonnes graph. The 800 Billion Tonnes graph was over 100 years, while the 50 Billion graph was over a single year. Yeah reserving the land would do the atmosphere good, but it wouldn’t solve our problems like the pairing of those graphs would imply.
The points made stand on their own, so I wish you would stick to like for like comparisons.  For example directly comparing 100 years of absorption to 1 year of production or locally sourced product to imported product really confuses and cheapens the presentation.  I do enjoy these series otherwise!
Poggg video!
Thank you for this video. Unfortunately people will still cover their faces and keep eating meat while waiting for a magical lab grown meat alternative
Mmmmmmmm steak
I'm pretty sure I would rather hunt wild animals than eat whatever tofu meat substitute is on the market right now
Okay but when will the Megacorp stop blaming me for global warming because I eat a steak while they get into a little oil spillage?
Why didnt you talk about fishes? Aren't they better than eating beef or chicken?
Why are we demonising cows anyway? Wouldn't there be about same or fractionally less number of animals if it wasn't for humans invading their land? I am talking about ancestoral method. Like let them live their life and hunt them when you ned them?
I personally feel the best thing to do is to have meat free day or more per week. I don't advocate to go vegan or even vegetarian because meat is delicious but you cannot ignore the facts. We all have to cut our emissions and less meat is one way to do that.
Your conclusions are conditionally based, on too few- and biased- studies. The entire premise is simply a diversion propagated by the fossil fuels industry, since there is no rational way to condemn an agriculture primarilly based on existing stocks of grazing and arable land to *anything* they do by their very existence.
Beef is the name we give to cows after we kill them.
Kurzgesagt- Talks about serious meat stuff. People in comments- Those Kurzgesagt cow animations are so good.
Vegan imitation meat is getting *really* good at actually tasting like actual meat, so a switch to that is way more doable than it used to be.
Isn't this like your 3rd video on the same question lol
what i hate about this video is how it tells us to cut off meat completly .  but that is not a real or sustainble solution.       a much better solution would be to eat far less meat.   if everyone agrees to reduce meat consumption by 70 or 60 %   it would have a huge effect on the entire production chain by reducing total demand.    many nations world wide already treat red meat like its a special luxury and only have it on special occasions. iran my home nation is included.                 americans for some reason think they have to eat  a whole sack of meat every day and eat all sorts of fast food all the time  and fill their plates with full beef stakes or multi layer burgurs or a bunch of hot dogs.   when in other nations like iran  meat consumption is so low that basically the majority of the meat is locally produced and  consumed with little to no visible damage.       the truth is that there is nothing we can do other then learn from each other and  change how we behave.     you dont need your entire plate to be meat .  it can be 80% plants and a small doze of meat for flavor and texture like most iranian foods.     our most loved dish is 95% plant based with small peaces of beef for extra flavor and we havent changed how we  make it for more then 500 years.   its freaking delicios BTW
Who else is watching this while eating meat ✋
When you say that cows are eating crops, I think it is more complicated. We grow crops mainly for humans, but since we only eat a part of the cereal, we give the left overs to cows. For exemple, soy is made of 20% of fat: fat is the part that us, humans, turn into oil to eat it. Then there is 80% of the soy that we don't know what to do with, and we feed it to cows so everyone is winning in the deal, farmers who grow crops and farmers who have cows.
Its not complicated. Climate change is a hoax.
there are some other aspects that you might not have covered. I know me personally, since I started eating exclusively meat, I have been eating less. a meal a day if that pretty much. I also have been losing weight, and thus been walking more to different places instead of driving. and in general lost weight is always better for the health care system, so less resources are spent on that. not sure how these other indirect Co2 contributor's are effected but I am sure it amounts to something at least.  regardless I am going to continue to eat meat, I just feel so much better on it, it is really a night and day difference. occasionally I will have some veggies as a snack, but my main thing is staying away from grains and that sort of stuff.  In regards to climate change and Co2 levels, you guys should do a video on historical Co2 levels and its correlation to planet wide greening, and temperature for as far back as we have data for. I think when you look at the bigger picture, Co2 might not be as sinister as you might have thought ;) I am far more concerned about plastic, garbage, and chemicals in the ocean and what not, stuff like that, then I am with Co2 levels. At the end of the day Co2 is just an atom of carbon, a building block of life, it is literally plant food floating in the air, and two oxygen atoms. I am no ecologist or anything, but it would seem like we are just distributing plant food throughout the planet. and historically when there is high Co2, the planet gets a greening effect, cause we are feeding all the plants and what not. that greening effect then cools the planet once it gets to a certain level, as those plants are absorbing and using sunlight instead of the ground or bodies of water absorbing it an wasting it as heat. I realise this is counter intuitive to what we are always told, but in my opinion this is the only thing that explains these correlations in the past, because we certainly where not around producing Co2 at the time. I know polar bears have survived 4 or 5 warming periods due to warming cycles caused by higher Co2, and those cycles where all harsher and happened faster then the one we are experiencing now, and they made it though just fine, I think we will as well.
then again...you would need a lot more plant based food for a kg of beef for the same amount of nutrients.
Yeah but beef tastes better than grass and sticks
Imagine seeing the stonks meme in a formal video.
Guys please, use this information to turn vegan and save the planet in my behalf. I'm still eating lots of beef anyways tho.
Vegan propaganda, left wing channel. I WILL NOT STOP EATING MEAT. Unless you learn to create it from lab culture with the same taste and different meat parts/quality that we have today.
We can feed the vegans to the cows, problem solved.
Ah, I see they are retreading their 'Meat is bad' video but putting a positive looking thumbnail.
I would go vegetarian but sustaing diet that doesn't make me feel like shit cost at lest 3-8 times more depending on season. Not only that i also have problems with eating larger quantities of food and if i have. A choice between meat mased diet and synthetic suplements just to meet my body's need id rather kill some cute juicy 4 legged stakes
I find that most papers forget that we can use meat and plant based alternatives together in one product in order to stretch that meat, especially if you mix mushrooms with beef.
Ok, but why no one is talking about movements like Permaculture? It is the methdology of turning food production into fully functional ecosystems that each year make the soil better not worse. The whole premise of the movement is to be carbon negative and prevent desertification of land (unlike today's agriculture). Animals are essential part of every healthy ecosystem and they can be carbon negative when part of whole ecosystem (acutally the ecosystem needs them to function). Spoiler alert: it still means less meat and more expensive meat than today :)
I love the thing of Kurzgesat , that this doesn't say what to do, but says to decide on your own. Ahh   FREEDOM !!!
Chickens exlusively eat feed crops? I guess I should go and feed them for the very first time in generations or else they'll starve! Kurtz is definitely informative and entertaining, but one thing they certainly never are: Unbiased. Every single topic they choose is not out of curiosity, but because they've already got an opinion about it.  Methane... really... Just bring back the mega-herds that once roamed the Earth and let's see how does it compare to animal husbandry in numbers. You start looking with an ounce of objectivity and the numbers start falling apart very quickly.
5:51 hold up, some medications can be considered a dairy product? or did I misunderstand something?
can we appreciate it that he is cooking a kind of the birds but the birds dont know it
I’m just waiting for general food grown in labs to come out.
09:29 - Really should have worked this out a little differently. If it was 800 billion tonnes of CO2 over 100 years you should have done a per-year estimate of 8 billion tonnes to compare that against the 50 billion tonnes per year bar, explaining that although this doesn't solve climate change it does help a lot.
As always, remember that the fossil fuel industry is doing a lot more damage a lot quicker than anything individual consumers can do.
5:58 I know this is a serious topic but... That a handsome cow you draw right here 😂
Im a proud climate denier. Its all a hoax.
Now waiting to see what BS that one channel will come up with.
For the first time, I have an observation.  The stuff cows eat (parts of plants, like corn) are mostly inedible for humans. It's a big oversight not to mention that.
is it okay to say that this video might cause some Beef in the comments
Honestly i don't care if meat is bad.. but this animation is LIT!
Funny how the chicken is going meat shopping... 3:36
What's with this channels new obsession with carbon emissions all of a sudden. I remember when this channel wasnt so preachy....
But what is the comparison between locally sold beef and stuff that comes from further? You made the comparison between an avocado and beef, why..??
This is one of the most biased videos I've ever seen. Ever heard something about avocados?
So, in a nutshell, if you eat local, grass-fed beef only from time to time (not being reliant on it), it's decent. Everything in the right proportion.
when are we gonna admit that there is too many of us ?!
I love eating meatWe die we die we don't we don't you live your life to the fullest.I love eating meat.I don't like plants.What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.I got run over 10 times by pickup truck And I'm still kicking
Awww🥺🥺 “5:20” the sad planet earth, it almost made me cry.
O v O
Hmmm burguir 😋😋😋
I’ve been vegan for over six years now. It’s really not that hard. I will probably not eat lab grown meat if it becomes a thing for many reasons, but the projects that aim to produce food with air and electricity intrigue me.
I’ve seen evidence that the proteins in vegetables are better for humans than the proteins in meat
Well then, only one thing for it.  Eat the rich. Most flavourful. 🤣
Food is about nutrition, energy and what is ESSENTIAL for human health.  COVID of course will cut down on the human population but that's cruel.  After the trees are 3 years old, you can grow beef in among the trees. It is called silvaculture. Honestly, what we pour onto croplands is far worse than what beef production does. Especially when you also include the damage plants do to humans who eat them to excess because crops are subsidized so they're cheap. Big Parma makes a bundle when these sickened humans need drugs to stay alive. I do wish Kurz would remember that humans, animals, and grasseslands evolved together as a unit for the past 4.35 million years. Stop buying into vegan propaganda.
Sure raising cows is pretty bad, but take a look att raising humans
Alternative Thumbnail suggestion: YES
You know, even if we take it to be one of the worse causes for climate change, it's only a small part of it. We are just too far gone, still growing in population, consuming more and more, exporting consumerism to every culture. Being vegan would not solve our problems, as the problem is with our whole technological society not being sustainable at all. Veganism, in fact, is contradictory in this manner, as it requires a whole technological infrastructure to become possible, from shipping, to fertilizers, supplements, etc. Even if they're less polluting, they still need a whole network of very polluting industries.  We are just falling into an abyss and no change to our lifestyle can save us anymore. A quarter to a half of the population will be dead by 2100 compared to today. If anything, we need to reduce the number of humans as well (you should make a video on antinatalism), our whole concept of the economy, where consumption no longer drives our survival and where producir stuff is not the only valuable activity anymore. We have to abolish capitalism, destroy the first-world purchasing power, and quickly get rid of all ancient fossil fuel industries and transportation. This, to me, seems unfeasible and no government will act to destroy it's own "society" to save everyone. We are fucked.
For people wanting to eat less meat but not knowing where to start - try stir fry. Onions, peppers, salsa, and a little chicken makes for a hearty dish that you can cook in under 15 minutes. Just substituting that for a normal meal every week or so would be a big help.
Wait but the grass or whatever crop that has been eaten by a domestic animal also binds CO² when regrowing so that has to be taken into consideration right? Or am I missing something? They didn´t mention it in the video right?
I would argue on the local point. My decision to buy local isn't primarily environmental concern so much as an ethical one in terms of the treatment of animals.  I think this has a knock on effect to the environment because I am eating less meat because what I am eating is higher quality and more expensive.
I come from India where 35-40% population is vegetarian
The capitalism is geared to non-stop growth and short-term profit. The climate and "saving planet" is very unprofitable and hence it is nothing but a trivial hindrance.
As humans we are lucky we can eat and survive on both veggies and meat
I was really nervous when I clicked on this video, wondering if I was going to regret buying merch from Kurzgesagt, the first time I’ve ever done so from a YouTube channel. But they nailed it. I’ve made basically every single argument in this video whenever climate change is brought up, and typically receive heavy negative feedback.   I’ve only really been able to link the vlogbrothers video about the Amazon being burned, and had to formulate the rest of the argument myself, every time. This’ll be a fantastic way to explain most of my points.   Another point talking about the environmental impact of meat would be to bring up water usage, as people often bring up almonds being super water intensive, without realizing that beef is still significantly worse.
Good video. The only thing I didn't like was the graph at 9:31. Felt a bit misleading actually, and I had to re-watch it again to understand what was shown.   You are showing the amount of co2 removed over 100 years from the point where 3 billion hectares has already been restored to wild grasslands and forests. Starting from that point, it would take 100 years to amount to 800 bil tonnes of co2 removed. Then you put another line under this, showing co2 created PER YEAR of humans, which is 50 bil tonnes. But the comparison isn't a good one since the upper line talks per 100 year and the lower per year. And you never really clarify this IMO. Maybe I'm too picky, but it almost looks intentional since you bothered to write "PER YEAR" on the lower graph, but not "PER 100 years" in the upper. Should've used 8 tonnes – which would be the yearly co2 removed – to our yearly 50 tonnes co2 emitted. Which would amount to 16%.
To summarize, we're fucked.
This video makes it sound like protein in plants is equivalent to protein in animal products. This kind of propaganda makes people develop nutrient deficiencies, depression, anxiety and many other health problems.
Short answer to almost all the questions in existence: "it's complicated"
You didn't talk about food waste.  How much meat is going to waste, how much veg is going to waste?  Does that change the emissions charts?
I'm surprised the calenders didn't run out! Did they preduce more this year?
How about we fix our diets last.... There are more important factors.
Sure, use meat as the escape goat. A little biased IMO.
The CO2 removed versus emitted per year was super disingenuous. You can't make a graphic like that without having them on the same time-scale (9:32). For actual comparison, per year on average the CO2 removed would be 8 versus the 50 produced. Over the 100 years it would be 5000 produced versus 800 removed, a reduction of 16%... Normally I really enjoy your stuff and I'm not even opposed to cutting back on meat consumption or vegan lifestyle but this is just terrible communication. You do not need to deceive to make your case.
Yes
I'm looking forward to the day that Impossible and Beyond meats are cheaper than actual meat. I still enjoy meat, but I've cut back a lot from twice every day to maybe three or four times per week. Plus, beef is saved for special occasions. I'm really into cooking. It's taken some patience to find new recipes where meat isn't the focus, but there are plenty out there. I recommend dried beans! There's a whole world of beans traditional bean dishes that are huge on flavor. Just don't forget to stock up on the digestive enzymes!
shouldn't be up to me to decide what food is better for the enviroment, if banning non-grass fed cattle is helpful so be it, beef will get more expensive but whatever.
Can you make a video on earth mass extinction??
I started to make my own veggie burgers (with false meat made out of beans and others plants). And I must say it's pretty good !
Personally,  I'm mainly eating kangaroo and fish nowadays. We unfortunately have to cull roos anyway so they don't starve 😔 So thanks for the meal, skippy 🙂
I simply don't nor will care.
Go vegan 💕
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive"  Well, I could think of atleast one thing that's better
Will's video has to have inspired this
Buy local do matter, but not because of the carbon footprint of the transport chain. It matters because it creates market incentives for the existence of small familiar producers and only small producers are capable of producing without using too many fertilizers or herbicides. A big farm works more like a company with some employees and needs to profit, so it is a good trade to have fewer employees and use more fertilizers and herbicides. A small familiar farm is not like a company, it has a fixed labor force and they want to cut off expenses in fertilizers and herbicides. So, it is more likely for a small farm to use organic fertilizers and herbicides (like manure or cover crops) because those things are labor-expensive, but require almost nothing else than labor. Therefore, small familiar properties are capable of addressing the enormous carbon footprint of fertilizers and herbicides.  But the existence of such properties is not a given because of inequality. Take the case of Brazil, my country. Unlike the USA, where the Homestead Act made the property of land easy to have, here the land has been concentrated since colonial times. Even so, most of the good food produced here to feed our people is produced in small properties, while huge properties focus mainly on soy and cattle for exportation (Brazil is the biggest exporter of beef and soy in the world).  As always, it is impossible to address climate change without addressing social inequality.
Long live the Meat!! 🍖 🥓
I was a little disappointed to see that this video didn't address certain issues, like that cows aren't supposed to emit that much methane if they weren't being fed corn-based feed, not to mention the total omission of traditional methods of acquiring meat that many people still rely on today that are environmentally sustainable, like the Inuit whaling non-threatened species of whales for food and materials. I understand that this video is directed at people living in large urban areas, but we can't forsake nor condemn those who don't simply because of OUR unsustainable lifestyles, when most of the colonized world had figured out sustainable lifestyles long ago, before colonizers came along.
Kurzgesagt telling its first lie within 15 seconds smh
The best thing for carbon emissions is to start a Nuclear War! More dead people means less people eating. less carbon emissions thank me later.
I am made out of flesh
Going vegetarian or vegan would be easier if those people weren't already the most insufferable humans on the planet
Hold up hold up when he was talking about emissions and transport he said that cargo ships are much more efficient... but I don't think I've ever bought a steak at the cargo ship lol those goods still have to be unloaded and driven to their destinations soooo it'd be the same as buying local... with extra steps lol
Q: what is the carbon impact of 1. Crypto mining 2. Social media 3. Cheap travel 4. Throw away fashion 5. Useless over consumption 6. Large families 7. Too many people on Earth.
the real problem here is only money and greed, lets be honest, as long as beef makes more profit then lose nothing will change.
Meatloaf better
Me literally eating beef nachos during this video
These videos are such eye and brain candy that's the best way to describe them. Keep up the good work guys❤️
Arent gas emissions emitted by farms cycled back into the surrounding environment? I thought i read the net positive emissions after carbon captured by the enviroment is around 7%.
Fish?
i disagree eating is arguably annoying  I would rather photosynthesize if it gave the same results (in terms of caloric intake and nutrients etc. which obviously it could never accomplish)
Nice, now i know it all
The most "green" thing humans can do is create less humans
Hmm, I guess my takeaway is "what about pasture raised goats?" ooo! I could see rotating goats through farm fields after harvest which, theoretically, would make farming even more efficient since it would result in non human consumable biomass being converted to tasty meat, and at the same time using previous energy investments in farming to pay for much of the goats' food would bring goat meat environmental costs down quite a lot. . .although, that math might be double dipping to get a desired result.
Meat will disappear in the future, it just take to much land, insects are something we now do not want to eat for we been taught how yuck they are, but other meat as horse meat is also seen as YUCK even it is very good meat, so when coming generation overcome this the insects will be more common to eat and even smaller mammals that can have several generations within a year, then we can form this to any shape by printing it in different layers to create taste and texture. Maybe we in the future do not need animals and plants at all, we may be able to create taste, color,  texture and all the vitamins and healthy stuff we need in a lab by just recycle everything that is organic, like we have to do if we want to live on mars where wee need to use dead bodies to get better dirt to grow things in.
Next video idea: How much emissions does the internet cause? And why streaming polutes more than downloading content
It used to be the case that when humans faced problems they thought about solutions to overcome them.  Nowadays there's never a complete solution, it's always "don't do this don't do that".  All of these issues already have solutions but our politicians need them to push authoritarian agendas. The solution is: reforestation of non-arable land. Reducing land usage through underground production via hydroponics and stuff, part of the production happening in the place of consumption. Nuclear energy and/or renewables. Genetically engineered livestock, or just grown/farmed meat, not raised/killed meat. And, most importantly, free markets, because markets regulate the resource allowance of most people in a reasonable way which means that if our profuctio  capacity doesn't keep up the habits will change voluntarily due to price fluctuation and meat will be consumed less.
So basically the source of everything is our human and animal population is way too high. We can’t afford to cut all animal products due to not having nearly enough productivity with other food resources, and the carbon emissions will still greatly increase with the gain of vegetation due to demand. What’s contradicting is the fact we can let all the animals continue to live outright because they will also play a big part in emissions.
The thing is, even if a couple thousand people stop eating meat, meat production will still continue at the same rate and therefore cause zero change. It needs to be millions upon hundreds of millions of people to actually make a dent in the production line.
lab meat wen
The problem is that people are eating too much meat... in many cases eating meat 3 times a week can be more than enough, with adding more dairy, fish, eggs, and eating less in general. For me is still shocking how much food goes to the waste in US, is kinda normal for people to throw half of the plate of food.
all you anti-vegans getting triggered rn
Boring
i just love how we keep turning the fault on consumers when its 100 companies responsible for most CO2 emisions
It's refreshing to see an unbiased video that tells the whole picture instead of just one side!
I have to say, this is probably the worst Kurzgesagt video they've ever done. There is so much blatant misinformation here it is astounding. "We won't dive too deep..." Yes, please do dive deep! Set the record straight.   For example: Avocado's still have to travel from the port, through perhaps X amount of countries or states before it ends up in a supermarket. Where are the calculations of C02 produced for that? They just compare ships and trucks, show a ship travelling half the globe with a truck travelling 2 blocks. Kurzgesagt's intention is pretty clear here. They picked a message and worked they're way back to find arguments supporting it.   Grazing ruminants on land that used to be rainforest, yes that's obviously terrible. So do a video on that. Don't say "meat is bad because it kills jungles!". This is just lazy. They tried to set the record straight by adding in that some land can't be used for growing crops. But glossing over it and giving buts. This is a much more nuanced tale. Some land can't be used for different kinds of crops because the land is so poor, or the weather is not optimal for anything other than feed crops. There is so much more information to give to show a complete picture that people can use to gain a better understanding of the topic. But no: meat bad, look this. This is just lazy.  Let's talk about the fact that ruminants graze on feed that is grown naturally. The feed (be it grass or corn or whatever) is actually carbon neutral. It takes carbon and methane from the water and air, stores it, the cow eats it, burps and poops most of it out and thereby releases it. Net zero effect. What about the fact that there have been ruminants in the millions for millenia on the north american continent that have lived perfectly fine and have not destroyed the planet just by eating?  This video is entirely skewed and just lazy.   I recommend watching the video on meat by the yt channel What I've Learned.
I am curious why fish wasn't discussed. I am curious where that sits in all of this.
Meat is only bad if your diet and existence do not involve rigorous exercise and conditioning.  Eating a balanced diet without overextending your MR keeps your body humming in sync. I know lots of out of shape fat vegans and out of shape fat meat eaters, and the same for the healthy side for both.
Wait, is it actually a common belief that cattle use "useless" land? Ive never heard of that. But im a long time vegitarian and so had to repeat the "most crops are used to feed animals" stat when people asked about cops so thats the only reason I know. But, if long distance transport is so efficent and some places DO have "useless" why not just make meat rarer and ship from them?
Even if most of the countries reduce their carbon output by 75%, there is one country that will continue to produce and increase their carbon emissions. Not to forget, this one country decimates fish population that it depletes the world’s oceans to lead to collapse since they do not follow the rules. Yes… it’s the same country that allowed the spread of the plague that is upon us today, China.
Really liked the video! But it completely missed the subject of byproducts from growing food for humans that are fed to cattle.
Regardless I'm going to continue to eat meat. Yum yum.
only facts...
i like how they fix some of the problem on the previous vid about meat.. like the 3rd part
Gonna make a fool of myself here.    Are ships so insanely efficient because of friction? Or is it something else?
Is it just me or have you begun making videos about topics you have already covered? Why even make this video when it's obvious what your answer is gonna be?
What is causing the biggest amount of emissions that could be avoided - is the wasted food. We spend insane amount of energy to produce food that later goes to wastebins.
Can you do a video on the health effects of the carnivore diet?
Fuck no. You shouldn’t need a video for this topic.
But we don't eat the ENTIRE crop that is grown. We eat the seeds of wheat but not the rest of the plant, THAT is "plant matter we cannot eat that's fed to cows that can eat it".
How can human eat beef.
Up for an hour - over a third of a million views - this is reliable virality. Also another r great and thought-provoking video. Ohmygod, I'm *soo* gonna say it... *tries to hold it back* - Food for thought.  (damn)
I got your app and im loving looking at things I've never heard of or things i know of but never knew more of ^^
great video. I would love to know what is the best and worst food for our body
I'm eating beef rn, so good
There are some caveats to add, first of all, plants need rich arable soil to grow, the manure produced by animal husbandry is a big part of keeping soil viable for agriculture especially in poorer countries. In those situations, no animals=no crop  Also, it does not take into consideration lab-grown meat at all, which might just be a more viable option without having a need to move away from meat altogether.
4:23 that feeling when you live in Finland, but you gone:
I think eating meat is given cause human are top of the food chain and it gane from tons of generations made it  it's arrogant to saying eat meat is cruel and being savage  it's natural for all animal and even if human do little more cruel for other animal it's including by earth normal  Vital activities
Off topic : But I got the book this week! It looks gorgeous, can't wait to finish reading it!
Sorry fellas. Still getting my meat tornado
I'm carbohydrate intolerant.
Moral physics: *Stops Existing.* Lmao IMAGINE what the topics covered would be, IF Kurzgesagt existed during ye olde slavery days!! "Could slavery be bad for the environment?" Just face it and move on to the change. What's these soft attempts at completely dodging the moral elephant?
Which song plays 8:19 to 10:12 ?
i would really want to translate this video to my native language so i could send it to people here ad they would finally understand. I live in brazil , and currently here there are more catle than people.
Excellent video, I really do feel bad for the vegetarians and vegans who get a bad rap and hate from obnoxious "anti-vegans" or whatever despite their lifestyle choices being an objective good. Speaking as a guy who loves his meat its easy for emotion to cloud our judgement when something we enjoy has its costs pointed out.
Can't say I like your liberal agenda here Kurz, i'll be real, I am NOT eating a VEGGIE PATTY that is overloaded with Estrogen, besides most carbon emissions are coming from industrialization as a whole, not just COWS.
thanks `developed` countries very cool now fix it
Another video about mostly beef. I'd love to hear more about the impact of chicken or pork
Oh no here come the vegan Karens
eat insect : low emission and low use of water, plus it contains a lot of nutrient
Overpopulation, let's ban factory smoke filters ! So less human exist on world!
I've been on the fence about it for a while now, but I think I'm gonna stop eating beef now
That very circular bird holding a burger didn’t press a button directly related to science but instead the kurzgesagt logo
yikes. talk about capitalist propaganda. devaluing things to nothing but numbers and money value
In all honesty I don’t care where my food comes from as long as it doesn’t fuck up the environment
9:45 apparently someone's having a helper T-cell for dinner
This channel sucked ever since bill gates started funding it.
2:14 Chick-fil-A could use this as an argument to get people to eat their chicken instead of competitors' beef.
I've always hated eating...I hate having to do something or else I'll die
Love it or hate it the only way for a sustainable  future is mostly vegan  Unfortunately and fortunately.    One more thing they forgot to mention is that the government give animar farmers about 90% of all the money to support animal raising so let's  say that they stop giving the farmers  our tax money to them the priice of stak would literally  be 90 % higher  for them to make a profit we would have to go back in time and only the rich could afford  it like it was the case back in the day or if you had land you would race it yourself but guess what you would wait 2-3 years until the cow is ready to be killed,  crazy ah?
Why did you fail to see that the amount of soy used for animals is mostly comprised of parts of soy we do not and cannot consume, and is produced also from the soy grown for our consumption?
I feel so validated in my decision to be vegan.
Just Print the meat...
When the world needed them(the kurzgesagt team) the most, THEY FINALLY UPLOADED!!!!!  Edit:Kurzgesagt i can't buy your stuff i live in malaysia
Necessary!!!!
limit the population, limit the emissions. We need to educate more LEDC's about contraception.
Why only account for carbon dioxide emitted by livestock when we don't account for what was sucked in by plants to make this emission possible in the first place. It's like having only likes counter without dislikes counter, totally unrepresentative.  Carbon is not created from nothing inside a cow. A cow gets it from plants. And plants suck this carbon from atmosphere via photosynthesis. Boom! No extra carbon is pumped into atmosphere except for the one which was there already. That's why planting more trees doesn't really solve the problem. The tree sucks carbon from the atmosphere and uses it to build its own flesh. What's happening next when the tree dies? It decomposes, and all the carbon captured is emitted back. That's why oceanic microorganisms are so important: when they die, they fall to the bottom and captured carbon in their bodies stays there forever.  These 40% of crops that we feed animals with - the thing is these crops are not human-edible anyway! For example stems of the corn. You cannot just stop feed animals with them and start to feed humans for this reason. It's embarassing you didn't check for this fact.  About fact that my local products transportation is more expensive per weight unit than overseas transportation: dude I don't buy my groceries in the sea ports, okay? They still need to be transported to the local shops, as the locally produced meat does, so these expences cancel out and we still have overseas products being heavier than local (not dramatically though)
make a video about NFT
Are we humans the only creatures that "play with our food"? Other animals simply consume their food as is, yet we require our food to be cut up, seasoned, cooked, etc.
How does this video stack against your 'Climate Doom' video? Does it really matter then if we stop eating beef animal products at all? You mentioned that even if we stopped our personal carbon emissions, the doom clock would only be delayed by less than a second. So, is there any point in going plant based then? Is the impact still not enough to stop climate doom? This is coming from a vegetarian point of view.  **Your video actually was 'Can we stop climate change'.   Thanks 👍🏼
Wouldn´t be fish then as good as a vegan diet, because they live in the water and so don't take up as much space
video suggestion: please address the harnful effects of a vegetable oil heavy diet  thank you for all the effort put into this channel!
I had chicken yesterday was gud mmm
This is a perfect non biased video. Even both sides of the debate can agree on this video.
OMG FRESH VIDEO
0:07 what about getting your d... yeah food is alright
woah, that's a little underhanded at 9:23 - "Remove 800 million tons over 100 years, humans generate 50 million tons per year." So for the loss of space, it would take out 8 million tons per year from what humans generate. I'm not saying that it's bad, but the way you have it presented makes it sound like a far bigger impact (as in overwhelmingly larger than what humans produce) than what it actually is.
This entire video is skewed by methane emission "equivalents", which are a fundamentally broken measure that overestimates the amount of GHG emissions that beef produces.  When CO2 is emitted from fossil fuels, it will stick around practically indefinitely, making it a long term problem.  Methane emissions on the other hand only stick around for 12 years, before it is broken down into CO2 in the atmosphere by chemical reactions. But that CO2 originally came from the atmosphere! (it was absorbed by grass from the air). This is simply part of the ongoing atmospheric carbon cycle that has a short term effect on warming. Moreover, if the amount of methane being released by a herd of cows now is the same as that being released 12 years ago, then the net effect is ZERO over time (it is being broken down in the atmosphere at the same rate as emission). It's a bit like if we asked people to pay a carbon tax on the CO2 that they exhale every time they breathe out; that CO2 came from the atmosphere originally, and shouldn't be taxed. Yet we ask farmers to pay a carbon tax on methane emissions? Do they get that money back 12 years later?
The fact that he said "well, its complicated" instead of "short answer, you'd die" means that its possible
Wait I thought we already had a video like this
I don’t eat beef anyway, just don’t like it. Prefer chicken and mostly not a big meat eater myself. I mostly like seafood, veggies and nuts.  I mean that I won’t have an issue with cutting meat anyway. I guess it’s my genetics
I think it all boils down to human population, which is too much in some locations. And also, you see there are a lot of activities other than food which are un-necessarily causing emissions. I agree going full vegan may be extremely advantageous, but it's almost impossible to get a large factor of population to go vegetarian. In my country, meat is specifically not connected to culture but still about 60 Percent families are non vegetarians. So I think population play a much important role and population increases consumption of resources and emission in multiples, so in my view population is a major concern.  And for those who might state that population doesn't account since we also observe lack of manpower in several places, I would say it's because of uneven distribution of population that some people feel the effects of over population while some witness lack of manpower.
"a kilogram of beef will keep you alive a lot longer than a kilogram of potatoes" this was kind of a throwaway line, but could you dig into it a little more?
I’m at peace with my love of meat…I don’t drive a car or travel on aeroplanes very much at all so I feel absolutely no guilt about enjoying a nice steak!!!
Insects are a great source of protein.
This video won’t make me a vegan, but I have feelings for both animals and environment. Omg, help 🥺
The issue I have is that half the so called meat emissions come from the change of land usage. So as long as global meat consumption just remains at it's current level, the emissions in the data have effectively already been made. The other half is methane, which degrades down to something like 1/16th of it's greenhouse gas potential after about 12 years. So again, this is a largely temporary effect and, assuming meat production remains as it is, is only maintaining greenhouse gas levels rather than adding to them. Therefore as the video points out, stopping eating meat won't so much reduce your greenhouse gas emissions as enable the banking of pre-existing emissions. Ultimately if you go by the stats in the video, if everyone went vegan immediately then we would only bank something like 16 years worth of emissions and this would take 100 years to achieve. So my point is that while it is very much beneficial to cut down on meat, it is hugely more beneficial to focus our efforts on fossil fuels.
Climate change is so stupid. Yes it’s happening but super slowly so stop the fear-mongering. Al Gore told us we’d have no polar ice caps by now and no polar bears. Polar bear pop is thriving. Fuck this propaganda channel.
"chickens produce CO2", plants use CO2 to make oxygen" "Conclusion, KILL CHICKENS"
Ooh I can watch this :) u don't need like/dislike ratio on good uploaders
Why was it re-uploaded?
yes
@2:47 As a Minecraft Veteran, I approve this is true
Meat is great, its healthy, tasty and best of all eating it pisses of the vegans 👍🏻 Triple win
take away my meats and i will start eating climate activists and progressive liberals.
So what ur tryna say is that we need to cut India off the planet 🤔
While eating isn't the greatest joy of my life, I'd rather give up cryptocurrencies, NFT, air travel and a myriad of other stuff totally unnecessary for quality human life before meat. Meat should only be a topic when imaginary currencies and so-called unique art is totally banned. I'm not giving up on my diet when an equivalent of Argentina's energy consumption is wasted on those.
Summary: Eat potatoes and save the Earth 🌎
i am a pescatarian so i can judge others
what i got from this is that we simply MUST stop brazil from chopping down the damn Amazon forest
What I love about videos on this topic by Kurzgesagt is how you take away the judgmental aspect of the conversation without leaving out the tough questions. You present it in a way for the viewer to make his own choices after providing all of the key information.
so how did humanity go extinct?  cow farts
not sure its fair to say all beef production must shoulder the carbon bill for jungle/forest loss, would be interesting to see one based on Europe/US. Obviously it would unlikely bring it below veg, but close enough to be ok depending on what land was used. Doubt it will be the ways things go, it will be a shame when they are all culled/destroyed to slow the climate change acceleration we blame them for.
Changing diet won’t help the world it’s the production of these products. Your diet is your diet eat what you want but changing your diet won’t really help the world. One thing that will help the world and what everyone can do to help the world is waste. Waste effects the world ,especially in America and China. Reducing the amount of waste will help the world greatly. Everyone should stop wasting so much food.
The issue with the methane argument regarding meat is that there is a carbon cycle similar to the water cycle so really there isn’t much net positive carbon produced like it is generally thought. You can see further discussion in “Eating less Meat won’t save the Planet. Here’s why” by What I’ve Learned on YouTube .
Here after the title change
only 1 thing, the avocados might only need 2.5kg of co2 to be shipped but theyll also need a truck to get them somewhere from the harbour just like the meat does.
Me who is currently questioning my sexuality looks at the title bashfully turns away.
Great. Nothing will change. Ever. People won't change. People are dumb simple animals.
Not vegan, but I do think that we should disincentive meat production and subsidize vegan alternatives for sure. People eat way too much meat.
You can't make me quit meat. I will not eat the bug. I will not live in the pod.
I will never give up meat, way too fucking good
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old";.... yeah...sure....
meat taste good
Actually, consuming locally in some country like in France may be better since it doesn't destroyed rain forest
Veggie substitutes have gotten amazing in the last decade or so too! :D  The best veggie patties taste like they actually fit with everything else in your burger, and the best veggie milk almost has that milky taste down. I'm really hopeful that I will be 100% vegan before New Years :D
to be honest i prefer the
Great video! Now how about making a supplementary video about fish and seafood consumption compared to vegan diet? In most likelihood the environmental impact of seafood consumption is somewhere between meat and vegan, but closer to which end of the spectrum? In this order, perhaps?? 🥩 🍗 🐟🌽
And I'm here just waiting for people to realize the most effective course of action is to simply stop eating meat. And no, you're not giving up on taste or pleasure by giving up on meat, there's lots of delicious vegan food out there. Go vegan, for the planet, for the animals
So, lab grown meat?  Ok, gotcha!
Go vegan c:
I enjoy your video's guys! I only miss the subject of what part of a plant like grain is useful for humans and what percentage of the useful portion is fed to animals? As far as I know, The useless part (the stem) gets fed to animals as straw, an the grain is the food for the humans.
This is a very complicated subject but if most beef is produced by cows from the dairy industry then shouldn’t life cycle assessments also consider factors like cows providing milk to its benefit but also it’s Co2 from these products also or is that too tough of a question?
i will never stop eating meat, because i dont want to be a weak little men having to take 20 pills a day so i dont get malnutrinion, its not my fault there are 7 billion humans and china and africa dont stop procreating :)
But I love meat...... Ok By the way Could you do a video about the great attractor? Thank you very much for all of your videos!
What about fishing, Kurzgesagt?  Are you going to address the estimate of 1-2.7 trillion fish dragged out of our dying seas every year and how that can devolve in an ecological disaster?
This video all fun and smart until you realise that there's a whole chicken fest on the table 0-0 0:00
Americans please stop doing barbecues 3 times a week
Seems pretty clear that the answer is yes. Not sure what the complicated part is lol.
The days of McDonald’s is at its end… :(
Your co2 emitted vs remove graph is misleading as your comparing 100 years to 1 year if there was no time difference between the two the co2 emitted would be 5 Trillian per 100 years. 9:33  Love the videos
1:00 BRINDZOVÉ HAĽUŠKY :3
one glaring omission here is there idea of not just shifting our entire diets all at once which is completely unrealistic anyway, just trying vegan meals a couple times a week can change so much
Just tried getting my family to stop eating beef, not sure how well it's going
Easy solution: Decrease the amount of humans on this planet.   Theirs only 2 ways to do that and the global warming crowd wouldnt be happy with neither lol
I'm sure people will still ignore the central message this video gives, but go vegan
THANK YOU, I was hoping that you would cover this subject
we're literally start to talk about how much land and resources left, next generations might consider the ringworld concept on the orbit
Yes, but how about other kinds of meat?
Go Vegan 🌱 💚 🌳
No other bodily pleasure enjoyed multiple times a day?? You were obviously never a teenage boy...
Hoax
Maybe one day in the future people will mostly eat 3d printed foods that will taste similar to the real thing. They might look down on us like if we were inefficient 🤔
Touchy subject. I'm living on a whole foods plant-based diet for five years now. Gains have been consistent, so I'm not complaining.
Go vegan
A plant based food system is the future for humanity. There's no getting around it. Sure lab grown meat is an exciting prospect, but until then, best thing we can do is to reduce our remove our consumption of animal products.
You can still eat meat , beef or what ever you like, just eat a good health portion of it every month.  Back in the day people ate only once  or twice in month meat, if we do that then we are ok, cause we will have both environmental friendly but also health diet.
If they make meat illegal, ill be the first underground black market meat sellers.
Watching this video while I eat my beef burger
“You can decide what to do with this information”   Well unluckily most who watch this who are staunchly anti vegan will not give a shit because enjoying the rest of their lives is more important than protecting the world for future generations regardless of consequences.   We need a Revolution, meat needs to be taxed massively and people need to wake up that there’s more to life than consuming so much.
So natural grass lands and forest can help reduce carbon in the atmosphere but you give no credit to crops or pasture land for their absorption of carbon…. And you forgot to mention that the avocado being shipped via boat has to be shipped via truck to get to market from the boat. And it’s also safe to assume there was a truck that brought the avocado to the ship from the farm with a few stops in between. Also in terms of methane emissions, what is the +/- of methane output compared to the absorption of methane of the planet.
Sorry I'm still eating beef
Soylent green is people.
I dont understand this comparison made around 9:30. 800 billion tonnes of carbon removed in 100 years compared to what we make in one year. It feels a little bit misleading comparing 100 years of removed emissions to 1 year of emissions.
If I remember correctly a large portion of the crop used to feed beef is human inedible. e.g. Soy Hulls
Why are we focusing on 26% of emissions tho ?
I hope the lesson people take away from this video isn’t to simply eat more chicken in place of beef. Mainly because the poultry industry causes significantly more suffering than the beef industry. But also because it takes many more people passing on beef before one fewer cattle is bred, and you’ll have a bigger immediate impact by cutting out eggs and poultry.
How about we address the elephant in the room first. Capitalist Enterprise which is the world's biggest polluter.
"Buying locally does not have a big impact on food emissions". But you just said there's a 10-fold difference between the best meat and the worst. Buying locally does not just mean in the close proximity. It also means it's better meat.
You used carbon imprit by calories and nutrients between meat and plants, then forgot to compare what happens once you look at the less polluting ways of making beef.
Heres a compromise to increase quality of life and longevity GMOs they could increase the best of both worlds
Monke in the intro holding a little cow
Food for thought. I mean, …
I wasn't expecting for you to talk about this, that's an awesome surprise. I've been vegan for a month and a half and I'm really enjoying this new lifestyle. Give it a try if you are interested in it.
It hurts my head that world leaders aren’t doing their very best to plant trees. It’s insane.
I'm not eating bugs.
Save the Planet! Boycott Beef!   By the way, I kept hearing about a suggestion to replace meat eating with food made of insect. Many people countries you probably never heard off eat insects as main courses.  I wonder when Kursgesagt will make a video about that?
not stonks hahahaha
I don't see the reason why we shouldn't make them suffer? I mean, less pollution!
Idea for a video:Time traveling, truth or fiction?
Even if it doesn't have an impact on climate,  I wouldn't like to or promote murder and torture of innocent animals for the sake of taste and luxury . (Unless one cannot afford otherwise)
I have developed too many personal relationships with the bovines here in India to ever eat their flesh again. I am discovering the joy of vegan. 👍
I'm a little confused as to how you came up with the figures for avocado and beef transport CO2 costs. Why does transporting 1kg of one thing require more CO2 than transporting 1kg of another? Do truck diver only drive in 1st gear if they are transporting meat or something :-) It's really got me questioning the rest of your figures.
There's a million different edible things but everyone just wants to eat the same 3 dead animals every day. Sad.
You know what : its really good actually. Feel bad for the animals tho. Wish meat  could grow on nature without harming the animals 😑
Wait, I'm not following on the transport calculation. Does the last mile from the port to the store also count? because those happen in the same trucks as the locally produced meat? It might be that I'm misunderstanding the thesis there
Can't wait to tell stories about meat to my grandchildren since it looks like they won't get to have much if any
Co2 is important, but you're not mentioning the impact on the actual nature habitat.
Still gonna eat beef regardless
No, vege-anarians are worse, next question...
The real moral of the story here is that I would rather die than give up eating meat.
I’ll enjoy my meat and support meat alternatives best I can, hopefully lab grown meat is the future and we don’t have to settle for plants that taste like meat
Lol can't wait for some other experts to debunked this and then other "experts" to debunk the debunker. Literally the science community disagree with each other so much that its hard to say one thing is correct. Love that the comments are filled with pseudo intellectuals though, and pretentious vegan who think so high of themselves for applying a bandage solution that is veganism. Literally the whole world could be vegan and then other industry can just scale up their operations and produce more co2. Only innovations can solve these problems of climate change not just stop eating meat.
There are few channel which explains complicated topic clearly, and this channel stand top on those list
"The more animals suffer the better they are for the planet" that isn't only true for livestock. We would have to cut out a huge number of luxuries from life to make a real positive impact on the climate
I'd like to know also about the newer field of lab-grown meat, along with its advantages and disadvantages.
I read that the whole “crops for animals” statistic is a lie (I’m not saying I believe it!).  As in, humans don’t use all of the cereal crop for direct consumption, and the remaining waste is used for animal consumption?  Is this true? How does it affect the CO2 system?  If the crops are grown for humans, and the non human edible waste is used for animals, surely that offsets some CO2. Food waste is large emitter of methane, I wonder how much methane would be produced letting the cereal waste go to landfill if it is not fit for humans?
One of the most delicious foods "meats"? Talk about bias.
Great video missed out the fact that the majority of cereals/soy used by animals is waste products though
What about Fish?
Tons of misinformation in this video. First most deforestation is not in Brazil, Other South America countries count way more deforestation then Brazil, and major players today are in Africa. Brazil is being bashed because of politics and because is big.  Also, the calculation of co2 per kg of meat uses methane data, and there is major logic flaws in these calculations.  Anyway. No one cares.
Depressed and chronic fatigue for 5 years.. Tried vegetarianism for 2 years and wow! Didn’t work at all, unfortunately, cause I love veggies and fruits. Then I tried the opposite, carnivore diet, and in 7 weeks 80% of my symptoms were gone. No medication, just meat. If you’re struggling with mental health and autoimmune conditions, give it a try, it’s magical how meat heals.
Gee, maybe 'beef' shouldn't be used in crappy $2 fast food burgers, but should be regarded more as a luxury good.
Meat is great. I won't elaborate.
doing less trouble is not a solution
unsubscribed
Short answer: No. Its nowhere near as bad as it portrayed.  We should focus on the food that gets wasted and 2/3 of that its non animal products.
Transhumanist agenda for dummies smh
Why more when faster and better?.
Unfortunately all the vegans I know or interact with are judgemental ass holes with a superiority complex. Sad as it is, that’s one of the reasons why the lifestyle isn’t for me
Great video and research but I was really surprised how little attention plant-based meats got in this video. Also, no mention of lab-grown meats? That seems like it could potentially revolutionize the issue :)
Beef is bad because yes we need to feed 15 billion people by the 2000-something. Maybe we should also start to think about controlling our own population number. We do this with every other land animal. Do we really need to be 15 billions?
I wish there was a video comparing all meats. I don't care much about beef (well maybe except dairy products - I am crazy for cheese, but tofu is a pretty nice substitute actually), but I don't want to substitute all meat that I eat.
we should stop eating foods
To graze cattle you don't have to burn fossil fuels to transport food.  But you do have to use fossil fuels to feed cows in a Cafe
I must be weird, I don’t like eating, it’s a chore for me. Maybe that’s why I’m skinny. I’d rather do other things with my time.
With the complexity of this episode, alongside the climate change one, I highly doubt humans will figure this one out. Greed, finger pointing and blame will edge out any viable solutions.
We all know problems are getting out of hand when kurzgesagt makes 2 videos about the same topic.
These types of PSAs are funded by special interest groups that want to monopolize the inherently decentralized market of food production with lab-grown meats, similar to how BP's marketing came up with the slogan "reduce, reuse, recycle" to shift blame from institutions to individuals while the entire recycling industry was a scam dependent on bundling and reselling polyethylene plastics in China. The same companies are invested in annihilating the environment with seafloor mining ventures and lithium stripmining while their executives fly to fancy summits on private jets. Don't be a sucker.
Why not eating the vegans? :)
How about carbon sequestration and soil improvement? Some farms with grass fed cows are reporting negative carbon impact.
Every human should watch this
Love the HOI4 sounds 4:25
What about alternative meats? Synthetic meat anc such? Or are these so far from industrialization, they cannot have meaningful impact in time?
Love these ones. Thanks, guys!
Overpopulation is a serious problem, there are too many people for this planet.
What happened to that poor cow?!
[DISLIKE]
meat tasty
chickens are the most dangerous. It is the chickens that eat our beef :P
At the end of the day Humans are Animals as well. Who cares, just eat what you like and enjoy life
Beef is the third leading contributor to anthropogenic climate change, after coal and fracking. Our civilization needs an alternative to all three if we stand a chance of survival this century.
A follow up question would be what about artifically grown meats? How efficient is it to have vat-grown meats and if not efficient yet, how efficient can it become? Wonder if this could be the step to take instead of trying to make meat-eaters stop eating meats. Meat eaters would be happy. Vegans couldn't complain about animal suffering, since it would just be cells growing in vats, and eco-fanatics could eat a burger and still not feel like they were raping the earth.
Sure, but what about fish?
OMG YES A HIGHLAND COO WOOOOOOOO
Most people don't need meat but there's semi rare medical issues that require meat. I didn't have those medical issues but my mom did. I specifically am ovo-lacto vegetarian.
this is vegan propaganda
Watching this while eating a 450g burger 🍔 😋
soooo... what about sea food?
Honestly those plant-based patties are really good these days. I buy them at the grocery store and also whenever I go to a fast food restaurant. Yeah it's not exactly the same as "real" beef but it's enough good in its own right that I see no reason not to eat the plant-based ones.
Vegan propaganda... I'm actually ok with this. I do belive that vegan is the future. I'm not vegan but I see myself changing in the future. Sadly my taste in food is kinda strict, I don't really like a lot of veggies, I wasn't grown on then. Picky eater I guess. Wish I had better "food education". Well nowadays there are some meat alternatives that I'm ok with, veggie burgers are getting very close to being just as good as meat. And I imagine vegan cuisine is developing new things and tastes. So in a very close future I can see going vegan being more attractive to me and many others. This video was great to give a little push in that direction, way better than those annoying vegans that are always screaming and are super judgmental about people that don't yet share their point of view. There are a million different reasons for people having different diets, like culture, economics, comfort, pleasure and so on, it takes time for that to change. I had a bad vision on veganism because of some individuals, maybe a vocal minority, but a loud one. Try educating people, share a vegan meal with them, be nice about it. Positivity generates positivity. Peace
If this was school id just listen to the person talking this is so educative
Stonk Bird 8:13

As a farmer it is easier for city folk to say that beef and other livestock are awful for climate change which it is but going vegan is running hard working farmers out of jobs when farms are needed more than ever in this age. It really is a horrid mess we have our selves in here
Damn thanos kinda had a point erasing half of humanity.
The book Apocalypse Never is a great supplement to this information. It is a fantastically written book that changed the way I look at certain things this video talks about.
9:33 is that graph manipulation which I see?  One is for 100yrs and the other is yearly, assuming that our CO2  emission remains the same, which it wouldn’t, those 3 Billion Ha wouldn’t even cut a fifth of what we would be making.  Now that’s how to use graph to subtly manipulate, I am impressed
First of all: don’t forget, people: ALL animals that are used for human consumption suffer. No animal that we can eat is killed with a nice shot of morphine to go in peace. The animal would taste bad and it costs too much time, and thus, money. It’s not only about emissions, it’s about NOT supporting a system that induces animal suffering. Is the good taste in your mouth worth all the killing? Second: Animal produce isn’t that good for you. Switching to a diverse plant based lifestyle is better for your health.  Third: Did you know that almost all viruses, including COVID-19, SARS, MERS, EBOLA, et cetera, exist because of our bad relationship with animals? If we were to eating plant based, none of these viruses would have spread.
I WILL NOT EAT THE BUGS.
Has anyone else noticed that the monkey in the intro holds something different depending on what video it is?
Now that's what I call a topic to test the new Youtube dislike design - Volume 1
It's not easy to make videos on topics that aren't straight forward and can't follow a simple formula or solution. +1 respect.
6:30 Peta: 'i'm gonna pretend i didn't see that.'
Also, most people can easily live on a meat free diet so why allow more animals to die if you don't have to?
Most likely it is, but I don't eat that much meat anyway so what do I care :D Halloween is good example of waste; pumpkin carving. Wtf? what a waste!
What about lab grown meat!?!?
~~by reducing the population , less food would be needed~~
Idk about the climate, but its 100% sure not very fun for the animal.
Hi KURZGESAGT, great vid as always 👍🏼
Hello Kurzgesagt or any other people who can answer that, but what is the impact of Milk, butter and other product on animals and climate change? I would like a greater picture ^^
"You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information" I love how they treat their audience like adults. Many media should learn form this.
There is a factor that wasn't included in the video that I would like to point out: what about the animal food that are processed from byproduct of human food?   For example in my country, rice husk and food waste are fed to animal, also hay is byproduct of wheat and rice production are used as food for cow, buffalo, etc.
No, meat tastes pretty good!
I will never stop eating meat
Eat to leave not leave to eat
is cannibalism better or worse than more common meat consumptions?
Hope y’all do more space videos soon!
Oh god front facing kurzgesagt bird
I have idea lest stop eating
is meat bad? are plants bad? doesnt matter. what matters is that we are digging up that sweet oil and coal. THIS is what introduces more carbon, and therefore our favorites, co2 and methane, into the system....
My mother used to tell me that back when she was young meat wasn't something that was eaten everyday, and when it was people made sure to not waste anything because it was supposed to be good stuff. Over time with economic growth meat became a readily available good that could be consumed every day at every occasion.  My take is that there's probably nothing wrong with meat, aside from improving the production aspects to decrease emissions and improve the conditions of the animals, but there is probably something unsustainable in the modern demand for meat, and meat should return to be a rarer good to be consumed less often compared to pastas, vegetables and fruits.  It's not a vegans VS carnivores argument, eat whatever you want, but keeping up an industry that must sustain industrial quantities of meat and cow herds for billions of people daily may be too much going forward. It's still going to be something very hard to sell to people, but I think a reduction in production, that keeps meat available but as a semi-luxury food, could be a good way forward.
These videos are beautiful thanks kurzgesagt
I bought my calendar back in October...and STILL waiting on it. Hoping it gets here sometime within the next year 🤞🏻 Oh and in case anyone is wondering, it's not cheap 😒
I have cut beef out of my diet and my family doesn't eat it either aside from my sister. The only problem with veggi based stuff is that I have the texture and have a lingering trauma from a horrific cook at our primary school.
I cannot help but feel worried about how much my farts contribute to global warming now :(
Videos about climate change annoy me, because everyone is too spineless to mention the massive elephant in the room. Population control and reduction. Blame corporations and industry all you want, but the simple fact is modern industrialization only exists to meet the demands of billions of people.
Great video.  It made me realize I would like to know more stuff about agriculture that I rarely hear: -impact of monoculture on an ecosystem  -impact of agriculture on the soil quality in the long term  -are things like fertilizers and pesticides production included in statistics ? -would having more smaller farms be better than less but huge ones (like I assume it is right now) ? -are farms with both animals and agriculture with rotation over the year better and/or possible on a massive scale ?
LETS GO FOOD
He still didn't do the same energy density comparison after he talked about beef that's raised right.  Only weight
This video reminded me to put hamburger o my grocery list.
I have a question: Were there not more grass eating animals in the world before man started domesticating them? Would they have not farted? so there should have been more back in the old days. So the only difference I can think of is the Trees. So stop cutting tree down and start planting them? I await your Knowledge, Thank you.
isn't it bad enough that whenever you are buying meat you are killing an animal ?
Scuze' me, I made a food emission.
Have you ever heard of cellular agriculture and how it is a win-win-win for meat eaters, the planet & the ANIMALS?  It is a fact that soon enough meat will be grown in cellular agriculture reactors vs. by coming from murdered beings.  And it will be the tastiest and most "nutritious" meat available.  We are seeing GOOD Meat already serving chicken in Singapore at a restaurant.
i will happily eat my beef until plant based substitutes are available where i live. as soon as that happens i switch.
Thanks for this video.
I’m super broke and had to improvise I made a veggie and cowlyflower rice burrito and with enough taco sauce it was surprising good. But I’m still a meat and potatoes type of dude. Just my income doesn’t allow that right meow
Don't care still eating meat
**Insect Meat enters the chat** 😂😂
Even if eating flesh were better for the environment I'd still be vegan. If you only refrain from eating meat because it's worse for the environment and humans might indirectly suffer because of your act you've completely missed the point. They're sentient and capable of suffering. Get a spine.
But I love ribeye steaks...
vegans link meat to climate change is because it gets attention and nobody cares about the other arguments to avoid it.
It's because the meet is being raised wrong 🙃  wanna talk about why
The guy who made Fart-o-meter is probably a billionaire by now (5:37)
Jeeeez. Might as well have put YES on the thumbnail.
cowspiracy?
Nice to see Mongolian rep in videos let's go
Thanks sounds more like a good guy every time I hear this argument….plus, people suck
Is meat actually that bad.  Kurzgesagt: *Yes            yes           yesyes* *Yesyes      yes      yes         yes* *Yes  yes    yes     yes            yes* *Yes    yes  yes     yes            yes* *Yes      yesyes       yes        yes* *Yes        yesye           yesyes*
As usual your videos are incredible but I just like to say that cow doesn't emit methane by farting but by much more by burping. And I do agree that's it's not so important...
Correct answer: I don't care. And if someone tries to take meat from my menu, better be ready to become part of the menu itself.
So we’re screwed?
meat is optional, pasta is life
"But only 19% of global soy production go for human food, while the rest is destined to animals in farms". This sentence is not wrong, but it's really missleading. Humans can't eat soy plants at all, we can only it a small part of it and the rest is something that is simply not edible by us. If everybody in the world stopped eating meat we would have massive problems with the CO2 from plant wastes.
If only plant-based food could truly replicate the taste & texture of meat...
With this information i want juicy beef. Your video made me really hungry, crawing it.
Nah I love meat too much 🍖 🍖 🍖
Thanks for your efforts ☺️
Even more so of a reason for me to hunt my own meat 😋
I hate eating. it's not a bodily pleasure, it's a chore.
Ahh guess it’s time to cut down on beef lads and lass
Kind of wish they would have gone more into detail on the arguments for meat. like looking at water usage (green water vs non green water), or the fact methane is atmospherically sourced and is adding no new greenhouse gasses to the environment as the carbon used to make the methane was sequestered from the atmosphere.
my class literally just finished talking about beef and climate change in transitional cooperation wow you guys are like psychic!
Now I am even more proud that I am a Vegetarian... : )
PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO ON NFTS NEXT thank you
So those of us who love meat are just fucked, huh? You either suffer a life of meatless misery, or swallow a nice dose of guilt with every bite of your steak.
I think for everyone that is able to should try reducing meat and animal products in general consumption... that would already help greatly the planet
4:36 but won't that same Avocado also need to be shipped via overland transport to a grocery store, causing the same emissions as the local beef; PLUS the international shipping?  Food isn't loaded directly from a shipping container into your grocery store.
I always thought buying food locally made it less polluting. Is there really no, purpose in buying local food ?
I never liked beef anyway, they are often chewy and gives out a lot of grease when you cook it, I'll just stick with pork which emits 4x less so I don't feel as bad lol
Eat a mealworms! They are source of protein and can digest styrofoam.
Hey! I clicked this video with the thumbnail "Beef love" because I was expecting a video to confirm my bias about what I currently eat. I do not appreciate being led down a road that promised lots of possible reasons why I don't have to change anything only to have each argument that was supposed to save me, be meticulously demolished by this so called "science" thing you preach so much. Beef is delicious and if you don't change this "science" thing to align with my previously held beliefs well I'm just going to have to take my views somewhere else! I'm sure there are definitely videos on here that talk about how good beef is and those videos are probably way better than this one and they don't even need to waste time with that pesky "science" thing either!
You messed up the numbers with shipping food vs buying locally. You excluded how the food arrived at the origin port, where it goes from the destination port (typically a warehouse or distribution center) and then how it gets to a market. You also have to look at seasonal crops and how they are distributed. This is why it is hard to compare and quantify the impact food (the general) production and distribution has on the environment.
☻/ This is bob. Copy and paste him so he can take over youtube and return the old dislikes. /▌ /\
I would still eat meat even if every ounce consumed added 50 quintillion gigatons of CO2 to the atmosphere
Even if we made windmills and solar panels they wouldn't be a reliable source of energy mostly cause it only gets their power when the sun shines and when the wind blows but alot of those nonrenewable  needs rare minerals which cause more damage to our planet just pointing this out cause it kinda bothers me ;-;
I've been trying to go pretty beefless in the recent months. If the option is between beef, chicken or veggie, I'll usually go chicken. Not quite as good as going veggie I know, but does make me feel good without completely losing the fun proteins, which I'm pretty sure I wouldn't commit to if I did try to force myself.
Probably this was the reason our ancestors wanted us to stick to Veggies. But we still eat non-vegetarian sometimes a month for our pleasure 🙃
no
🥬
I'm amazed there are people left who aren't completely black pilled on the climate future
If only i wasn't allergic to soy, peas, nuts and all the necessary vegan stuffs:(
For reducing CO2 so much, algae converts far more that trees, we should just have dedicated algae paddies. (They’re not nearly as beautiful as a forest, but it would work better.)
Propaganda. Explain more, that part where you said we won't go into this now. How is it there used to be herds (multiples of them) of +1 million bison roaming the plains for hundreds of thousands of years and the earth was fine yet now we can't eat beef because it MAY raise the earths temperature by 3 degrees in maybe 100 years? Is that how the past (5) ice ages happened --when dinosaurs ruled the earth and all farted on their grass fed pastures? This doesn't work out. There is more that isn't true about the beef vs. veggie transport that you aren't mentioning either.
what about china
I like meat and I don't a rat's ass about climate.
Beef: Bad Vegan: Good  "The reality is,well,its complicated."
Or we can just stop making babies. That would solve a lot of problems.
I love meat!
Please make a video about gravitational lensing
You also seemed to forget that we feed a lot of non-edible things to cows. We don't necessarily eat 100% of the wheat we harvest. We just eat the seeds, which leaves a whole lot of plant material we don't eat.   Furthermore you also need to account for the distribution of cows and their uses. For example India has millions of cows they only use for dairy due to religious beliefs. Thus they're vastly more inefficient than American dairy which slaughters unused cows for meat.  Plus then you have to account for water usage, as well as decay potential for plants. Rice relies on vast irrigation and plant decay for example. Tree related plants also either relay on flooding or in the best cases drip lines. But regardless of that the trees still drop their leaves which decay on their own.   Furthermore you also need to account for how trees aren't even the most efficient co2 converters, algae are.
Go vegan For the environment  For the animals  For your health
A bit disappointed to see a cow's farts blamed for their CH4 emissions, when in fact the vast majority of it is via burping. Farting is funnier, mind you, to animate.
I will eat what I please. The day when others tell me what I can or cannot eat is the day I leave that society for good.
Me: waits for the introduction 'conclusion' Kurzgesagt: "well, it's complicated" Me: "called it!"  Also: "Could that title be any longer?" ~ hey, that's me :o
Some people literally need meat, sometimes, pure carnivore diet, to live healthily and majority just can't switch to vegan due to their nutritional needs
some flaws in this video:  1. yes, the destruction of forests does release CO2, but so does tilling of cropland which also leads to runoff in waterways. 2. All human-edible plants have waste ie. corn and soy husks which are used to feed animals, because it would be a waste to feed human edible food to animals. 3. Protein synthesis from meat and vegetables are not the same, as the body can more efficiently absorb the nutrients from meat. 4. Additionally, meat from beef has a lot more micronutrients necessary for life compared to any vegetable and isn't comparable based on calorie and protein intake alone. 5. The comment about methane being the largest emission and most powerful despite not providing any evidence that cattle provide a influential amount is kinda biassed.
the best thing about this channel is they are showing you possible things figured out by different studies, it's up to you what you trust in
10:22 I agree with that bird, if your sleeve can phase through a sewing machine, then you might want to get rid of it as fast as you can!
Basically, we are all doomed.
I feel like lab grown meat would solve most of these issues.  Wouldn't need the grassland anymore so we could plant trees, less cows would be needed and no ethical conscerns about eating it since no animal is being tortured and killed.
What would happen if 10% demand of meat stopped,A drop in demand means a drop in price and increase in demand,but a continued demand drop should show up in data of producers making them reduce supply?
I haven’t finished this yet, and can see loops holes already. Most soy & corn ( around 70%) is grown to feed livestock. Not people. We forcibly breed (rape) feed, water, and provide antibiotics for over 59 billion animals a year. Over 59 billion animals are killed a year for food. That doesn’t address non terrestrial either. Those numbers are in the trillions and seafood kills over 5,000 whales/ dolphins annually. Grass fed beef has be irrefutably shown to be bad for the planet. Locally produced meat doesn’t do a damn thing. Feed & water still has to be provided for these animals. Antibiotics to boot which is losing efficacy. If you think Covid had been rough, just wait until you can’t get antibiotics to solve a previously easily remedied tooth ache caused by bacteria. The meat industry in the US alone- alone- is subsidized by tax payers to the tune of $38 billion A YEAR! Who profits off of that? Fast food. The same companies that are feeding you expensive garbage while profiting wildly off of it. Protein also “feeds” tumors. It’s almost impossible to have low protein if you’re eating foods that aren’t packaged and at the gas station. Please learn how to read studies! Industry funds A LOT of studies and it is dangerous not to know the source of what you’re reading. Almost done and this video is good, you guys did a good job helping people to understand. I’ve been vegan for almost 20 years. I look about -10 younger and my annual blood tests make my dr super impressed. You can be a broke, lazy, cheap, vegan. Please try to kick animal products out of your life and quit giving fast food companies insane profits at your expense.
every single cientific answer starts whit a "well its complicated"
My girlfriend and I absolutely adore every video you guys produce. Thank you so incredibly much for continuing to produce such high quality and informative videos for free.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day, and never gets old" must I say it out loud
Now make the same video but for crops
Great video as always. However, I would add the impact of food waste. All resources invested (water, soil, transportation, etc.) just to overeat and throw the rest in the garbage.... Growing tons of pumpkins just to put a candle inside in Halloween then throwing it away to rot (just an example). I think the best and most impactful we can do right now is to minimize food waste. Planning for better land use, reducing meat consumption (or others)  will take time (and education).
what is most concerning is the antibiotic abuse which the meat industry does. who knows what kind of superbug  we  are making
don't care. gonna eat meat til my last breath. so will me children.
so in general meat is worse for environment than other foods, well i agree but imma stick with my burgers
Lab grown beef time
No!
Be vegan just because we can and can feel animal emotions ourselves.
Jesus... WTF happened to this channel. It's pure propaganda now.
But since we need proteins in our diets, using protein supplements to replace meat, is it a good chioce? Or is it a good chioce only if the supplemets come from a vegetables? If so, how big is the difference between supplements from meat ad supplemets from vegetables?  Someone could say why use supplements instead of just legumes, I say that if you need to be an athlete you need certain doses of proteins that only meat and  can give you since there aren't a lot of carbohydrates as 'raw' legumes.  What I really mean with this comment is: use supplements to replace meat, on the ambiental side, does it really matter?  A big hug from Italy! (I'm sorry if I made any language mistakes )
That moment when you never eat meat before and hate eggs and dairy :|
Would have liked it if more information about the science and philosophy about animal suffering was included. That topic is often (in my opinion unjustly) pushed aside as non-relevant or too emotional. Maybe something for a future video
Any Indian who feels the depth ❤️❤️❤️
WHOA you left something out .....feeding a small amount of seaweed to cattle cattle each day can cut back on 82% methane.
Banning cattle meat won't do anything except deepen the class system where ultra wealthy get natural meat and everyone else gets imitation meat and it's beyond inhumane
Nope, but marxism is definitely bad for your freedom.
I will never eat a veggie burger, sorry not sorry
I appreciate you highlighting that the least emitting version of meat is the one where animals are treat the worst. Sounds like a pretty open and shut case for cutting out meat
and here I thought Kurzgesagt would bring out an unbiased video
Here before 1mil views
9:45 Who is eating that T-Cell?
Me: is meat bad for the environment   Kurzgesagt: yesn't
What about the carbon cycle? Things like grass or cattle are simply a carbon storage, the carbon in the system (the earth) are never going to change (increase or decrease) regardless of it's being consumed by cattle as feed or human as a meat product?  But yes, we do have to control the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, if it is not stored statically.
So what will you do about it? Invade Brazil with EU NATO Army? LOL
It’d be so nice to be able to build a world where our kids can be optimistic about the future. A world with sustainable energy, honest governments, friendly worldly relations and naturally and sustainably harvested food. It’s sadly a dream at this point but maybe we can take it one step at a time 🤷🏻‍♂️
"The more animals suffer the better they are in terms of climate change because they are way more efficient"   Indeed a sinister truth. Makes me rethink what is morally right– Saving the planet or making the animals suffer.
XD
Kurzgesagt:- Is meat really bad for environment Me:- well well well, let's find out
Well i tried it and its pretty easy to reduce meat to nearly 0% consume. The alternatives taste relly good ❗ I didnt know that untill a friend showed me some of the best alternatives 🔥👌
Why can't we just grow meat in a lab? With no animal attached? Seems better than farming and meat substitutes to me.
This is kinda sus... You say that cow burps CH4, it goes into the atmosphere and stays there for decades and then you cut off there... Like for us who don't know we could just assume that it will break down into water and carbon dioxide and just sit there almost forever, but no the CO2 and H20 just rain down back to the grass, the cows consume it and so on so it's a closed system unlike burning fossil fuels. Also other data says methane only stays in the atmosphere for like 10-12 years so why all of this huge variation?
Can explain what would happen if you stop time like in JoJo's bizarre adventure
Meat eating isnt bad for the environment  Vegans are look at the windows xp background then vs now  Vegans are eating all the grass
search on youtube the ted talk "it's not the cow it's the how": it says that using regenerative agriculture to grow meat is actually carbon negative, even better than carbon neutral.
how many hectares will we save if we do a cannibalism diet?
You are saying that beef-free diet  would  free-up 3billion hectares that could be use for growing forests or wild grasslands. But pastures already take CO2 from air and convert it to feed, but also sequest carbon into soil. When pasture is menaged right by rotating cows and preventing overgrazing, you are making soil more fertile and capable to hold much more water, which really help fight droughts.
All this comments about going vegetarian... Well, more meat for me I guess.
Would love to see a video on lab created meat, maybe as a short epilogue to this video?
I would look into lab made meat
But what about vat-meat?
As long as we can still have fish
Please consider going vegan! Besides the environment, we are needlessly torturing and abusing trillions of animals yearly.
The problem is, as always, the prisoner dilemma. Even if I turned vegan tomorrow, will everyone else? Or a majority? Or even a significant portion of the population? Probably not. And my own individual impact is minimal, so me doing it alone will affect nothing but my own dissatisfaction. So if doing it alone will affect nothing, and few enough people will do it to create an impact, why should I do it? This is why collective action is necessary for any kind of meaningful change. Talking about the data isn't enough.
Thank you
Could we talk about the elephant in the room regarding co2 emissions? That is, global shipping using huge and inefficient vessels that no government dares to talk about or regulate.
Solar Foods is developing technology to produce dietary protein from single-celled organisms. Using hydrogen, CO2, water and nutrients, they may be able to supply all our protein needs without animals. Fascinating!
Cows make lots of fertilizing compost for the earth.
MEAT.GROWN.IN.A.LAB
In the end he only talked about carbon emissions, not protein per mass production... So alienated
Love you Kurzgesagt, thanks for doing your best!
I dunno... I kinda like meat, although I'd like to eat much less of it than an average person in a developed world does now (so a standard portion once or twice per week). My neighbour breeds cows on meadows around his house, he didn't burn down a forest to make space for them and he uses their faeces to fertilize the fields around, on which farmers grow crops mostly for people. Is this kind of business really that harmful?  Crop rotation has been a thing for centuries. How are we gonna keep our soil fertile without any livestock? Not talking about the fact that the human brain developed in a way to require specific lipids and proteins that we get from animals and it's very difficult to make a balanced vegan diet for a child that's still in development. I don't say it's impossible, but many parents are struggling to feed their children proper food now when they have meat at their disposal.   But meat factories need to end as soon as possible, while we reduce our consumption of meat to make it possible to sustain our needs by these more eco-friendly methods.  If this comment gets noticed and somebody starts a discussion in replies, I'd be grateful if you kept it civil. Thanks in advance.
10:08 Imma cook up a steak for dinner tonight.  Medium rare.
The reality is that fossil fuels are by far the greatest source of greenhouse gas emissions and blaming meat consumption is just another way to pass the buck.
So basically, eat more pork ?!?
I have an extremely hard time believing the reportedly low emissions from international shipping. It makes no sense that food that travels a few hundred km during its entire production emits less than food that travels thousands. What about packaging and additives? How do they play into the combined emissions for plant based products vs meat products when considering shipping?
Well if you just see the studies that Mr Bill gave you the video make sence, other than that, Regenerative agriculture was not even explain.. well money first jajajaja
There is so much lacking of information and this  actually succ
All this in a nutshell. Less mouths to eat meat, less car drivers, less need to produce many same but different company electrical devices, Less people, less viruses and slower spreading. And most in a nutshell version / Most avoided topic there is: Less overpopulation, less stress on the earth. But everyone are just too scared, emotions over logic nor naive person to speak about that. We just keep trying to avoid the unavoidable with everything that is not going to work for eternity. As long as we don't balance everything then our planet is sentenced to die because of stupidity and thinking with emotions and not with logic and common sense. And all lives matter is not helping. I know it's hard topic. But sooner or later that option will be taken on the table. Just start with insane terrorists, dangerous criminals and child raping pedophiles. Also communists can go too. And certain type of Karen (You know in America what I mean) And voila. Years work done in much shorter period of time. And if that is never and option. (Might sound crazy) But then we just have to make one Chinese law globally accepted. You can make only 1 child per couple. If you want to have another one. You must pay money in order to have another weight on global warming. But those Covid vaccines are not helping with overpopulation. I think viruses always come for a reason. Too much humans. Must lighten the load. It's not working. Then it must do something to work. And that virus mutates faster than new vaccine is produced and made to work againts that virus.
Vegan people are underrated
i feel like we need actual population control in tandem with environmental efforts to make any meaningful impact
So less meat, especially beef. What else can we do? :) It's easy to eat more chicken or just meals without meat, or maybe meat twice a week. There have to be more things everyone can do that actually makes an impact
I continue to wait for artificial meat to become standardized.
FUTURE IS VEGAN
For those of you who really like beef or meat, want to stop or reduce eating it but are reluctant to remove it from your diet, go with impossible or beyond meat. It's close enough that you'll get similar satisfaction without needing to consume beef, and it's cheap enough to compete against meat prices. That's what I do for the majority of my meals
Nitrous oxide is 300 times as potent a greenhouse gas over carbon dioxide. Nitrous oxide comes from plant agriculture. So less emissions, but stronger emissions are coming from plant agriculture. It comes from synthetic fertilizer. Synthetic fertilizer is partly responsible for desertification. Grazing farm animals can reverse desertification by spreading their droppings, returning nutrients to the earth, and don't emit nitrous oxide. It's not so simple.
Once again  Your content doesnt dissapoint
Vegans are clowns
I would genuinely like to go more vegan in my diet, but my allergies simply don't allow it. Most greens and fruits I simply can't eat, along with soy which removes a whole swatch of vegan food. I get most of the stuff most people get from veggies via supplements as it is, and if I cut out meat and animal products I'd basically be one step away from eating nutrient paste (which I would 100% be down for if it was made home available)
Id like veggie based products that taste exactly like meat to me more available for me (where I live we don't gen any). If I could find anything from chicken to beef and everything in between but it's made of vegetables id change without a doubt. What I care about is the taste, nothing else honestly.
I'm in a fairly lucky situation with a local dairy farm and local butcher shop not far down the road, also Midwestern US plains land so it's not really useable for normal farming. Basically the perfect area you can be in for animal farming. Don't eat as much beef anyway but anything I do eat comes from my local area.
I think lab meat could be a good substitute for farm meat.
"Even if we cut out all other forms of pollution aside from meat, we'd still burn  through out entire carbon budget by 2100"   - Sometimes I think we have a chance, then I hear this and realize we are doomed
How many Heck-tears? 😳
I choose my food based on nutrition and cost. Any plant-based suggestions?
hmmm, while you share your sources in the description like always, I got the sense that this video felt largely more sensational compared to your other meat videos, throwing data and statistics at the viewer without providing even short blips within the footage of where said information came from.
thank you for using your platform to spread useful information 💙🌍💚
If we work with the assumption that all humans are selfish (including myself), which I firmly believe that we are, knowing beef and other meat are costing us the environment will not likely stop us from consuming meat for pleasure (or consuming meat for other factors that we deemed not substitutable, of which I believe there are always another way when it comes to food).   This video has provided good evidence that we have an issue, and motive us to work to a solution. However, if my two sense is worth anything, the solution is unlikely to be giving up meat, but some form of alternative meat/carbon reduction method that will worsen the animal right issue.   That brings me to my question, are there any promising technology/farming methods that we are working on right now to solve the aforementioned problem?
Sorry but veganism is not a diet, is a lifestyle where you can't consume nothing that in his process damage an animal (food, cosmetics....). The diet is call plant based :)
Way too many numbers here, and statements made thereupon, can be stretched to favour anyone's position (eg: Beef pollution numbers might aggregate worst case numbers of diesel transport and not developing electric transport).
I don't care what happens to the environment, I want chicken
Being vegetarian, pescatarian or vegan can provide equally as delicious meals as a meat diet. Changing diets does not take away great food!
I love this channel but the fact you just dismissed 75% of the problem seems disingenuous.   How many people who are not eating meat, or have reduced meat consumption are cutting back on needless consumerism? The focus should have been on realizing that you don't need a bunch of pointlessly manufactured tchotchkes, gadgets and do-dads. If we are trying to passive aggressively bully people into changing, then take a look around your house and ask yourself: how much of this garbage do i NEED?   It all has to be made from resources that took energy to attain whether through mining, harvesting, or manufacturing. Then it has to be transported. Then it has to be stored. Then it sits on a shelf or is used until it breaks. Then thrown away. Then repeat.   I would say mindless consumerism is the biggest culprit. Wasting time and money on collecting resources for a bunch of shit we don't really need, just want.   We need food, we don't need new phones every 6 months.
I was vegetarian for about 2 years, but then I got anemic. It was my fault, I absolutely hate eating vegetables, so it was insanely hard for me to get the right diet going. I hope we can develop better food alternatives in the future. Good luck to all the veggie heads out there in the meantime!
RIP beef stonks if grass was mandatory
Nah, sex is the best thing about being alive.
What if instead of trying to fix climate change we adapt to it? While I don't have the means yet to start researching about this idea I think a method of trying to create a copy the plants process of photosynthesis and attaching it to humans will be a possibility to solve climate change and will allow us to greatly enhance some of out energy creating methods (since we won't have to worry about co2).
My biggest problem as a vegetarian 100% of the time and 90% of the time a vegan, is that is so damn fashionable to hate vegetarians/vegans. You see it everywhere there is any vegetarian discussion; “oh well I’m gonna go and have a big steak to counteract this person being vegetarian”, and this person will have waves of support. Like, why?  I’m not saying everyone needs to stop eating meat and I’ve never pressured anyone into it. Hell my wife is the most hardcore carnivore I know. Maybe just eat less meat, and stop this bizarre unbridled hatred for anyone who has chosen to be vegetarian/vegan.
Let me cut to the chase of what democrats are ultimately trying to get at. YOU are the carbon source they are trying to reduce.
In my family we already start to reduce eating meat once we realised how much we still have in the stock.   We still cook with some sort of meat but we prefer more veggies than meat.
3:10 this scene from the video seems to suggest outdoor grass-fed beef is better than factory farming, but then at 6:32, they say intensive feeding is better ?? Finally what is better for climate, and how come the worst beef emits 10x more than the best beef? And why do transporting vegetables emit less than meat?  please next video about some non-vegetarian alternatives: lab-grown meat, insects, genetically engineered beef to emit less methane...
So I should make a beef farm surrounded by trees
One thing that confused me: you used beef = cow as such all the costs to make a cow = costs to make the beef however, you can eat a lot more from a cow, a more fair comparison shouldn't be everyhing one cow produces vs X food?
Awesome! What about the ethical side? thats the most important because That's what makes us humans and not facts remembering machines.
9:32 there is kind of manipulative information there becouse on both diagrams there is different time scale used, to be clearer it should be 800 to 5000 there or 8 to 50 bilions of co2.
I only know that without meat we wouldn’t have better brains in the early humans
In the video of can you fix the climate change you said that agriculture uses 50% of all world habitable area that is the size of Americas, now you say that is America+ china...
What about how effectively animal protein is digested, all the macro nutrients in beef, pork, etc. What about easily oxidisable fats from vegetable oils compared to natural fats. I feel like you nitpicked a bit on the nutrition section by only talking about protein and not all the factors that surround it.
"Food is Arguably the best thing thing being about alive"   Minecraft Players : Reality is often dissapointing
Go Vegan guys. Save lives. These animals bleed like you do, and feel pain.
the fact that this video barely even mentioned animal suffering and it was still so convincing, just goes to show how many points the meat industry has against it
Incredibly misleading, for example, the majority of soy being used for animals. This is not explained well as the soy that is used for animal feeds is not able to be used for human consumption and is simply a byproduct or the production of food for human consumption! I like this channel, normally very informative, however this video is misleading.
ignores the fact we can push to grass fed cattle, ignores the fact forrest burning occures for plant crops as well, switches back to total CO2 when comparing best cases, ignores the fact that meat from china and meet from next the next door still has to be driven to the local market, so the emissions from the boats are strictly more then local.  What's going on with this video, they're usually really good.
Ok, this video has officially convinced me that I would be willing to eat lab grown meat
I would just like to express appreciation for using the poo emoji on the fertilizer truck. For some reason, that made me bust out laughing. Tuesday conquered!! Oh, and love the calendar by the way. New annual tradition for me!
I suddenly want steak
BROOOOOOO
I encourage people to participate in Meatless Mondays.
why cant we release co2 to space ??
"it's complicated" should be the indicator that this discussion probably shouldn't be in a 12 minute episode. There is so many moments I wanted to say 'yes, however' in this. (for context, yes I am in agreement of cutting back on meat products/ looking at other options.)
I just stopped eating meat because its unreasonably expensive: 20lbs  of beans is $20  and 5lbs of beef is $21-$22
Fuck off from my diet.
No I will not eat the bug, but I hope the weather is good in tel aviv
There’s over 70 billion farm animals to feed 7 billion people. It’s obvious that you have to grow more food to feed the animals to feed humans and that is very inefficient way to feed a global population. Is it absolutely necessary to have nutrition filtered through an animal. Feed crops produced in North America are enough 5o feed the starving populations of the world 2.5 times over according to the industries own data. Time to change protein is not an issue there’s no protein deficiency wards at your local hospital. It ain’t a problem.
Comparing locally produced beef with fruit that is shipped across the ocean is incomplete since also the transoceanic food needs to be transported to your local grocery store. So you have the environmental impact of local shipping plus the transoceanic shipping.
Certainly there's a significant economic and cultural argument in favour of beef production in some parts of the world, northern Britain and Ireland being a good example.   Here there's huge amounts of otherwise unproductive grassland, and the agricultural economy is almost exclusively livestock, cattle in the valleys and sheep on the hills. Abandoning that land would be very costly, you'd either have the government buy all the land at market price at a cost of at least 80-100 billion pounds and be saddled with millions of hectares of money draining grassland, or they can permanently subsidise farmers to basically do nothing with their land, which would be even more expensive in the long run and even more unpopular. Telling the farmers to lump it isn't politically viable, they're a very vociferous minority with the power to cause a lot of disruption.  It would also have an enormous cultural impact. Some villages and small settlements owe their entire existence to livestock farming, without it there would be little reason for anyone to live there, other than perhaps a few retirees and hotel owners. They're often a long way away from towns, so have already experienced a population drain as agriculture has become less labour intensive. This would probably be enough to be a final nail in the coffin for some of the most isolated places.  I don't have a good answer to this really, in an ideal world we could just leave the land to nature and every government would have enough income to sustain over a fifth of their land being a money sink. But farmers need to be placated and a historical agricultural culture needs to be preserved, or at least able to adapt without losing its essence.
All the people who understood the German video from 3 weeks ago must be feeling pretty classy now.
I'd love a steak right now
Love all the graphics! Some really beautiful scenes in there! <3 As an addition to the amazing facts in this video, I would like to add that we need either cattle or wild grazing animals in order to keep a high state of biodiversity! Grazing animals help keep areas of grassland from closing up into shady forest and therefore help all the flowers and insects that depend on them! That said, we would only need a fraction of the cattle we keep now, so it's not really an argument against the current cattle practices.  Anecdotally, the dairy farm in my vicinity probably has hundreds of animals, which they cycle in the pastures. We wouldn't even need a third of those.. And I would personally prefer if we didn't hunt the wild grazers and help them manage the grasslands instead, like they did for many moons before the human explosion.
CO2 and methane emitted by animals come from crops and crops get the carbon from the atmosphere, it’s a cycle. The focus needs to be in stopping emissions coming from fossil fuels, CO2 trapped for millennia, that is now being released.
Did you Ignore the carbon cycle or ruminants and did not discuss the possible usage of ruminants to discard what remains from crops? Ruminants do not add carbon to the atmosphere if you actually look at them. They use carbon from the plants, release it to the atmosphere, then the methane breaks now and is absorbed by the plants as CO2 and water. this is not excusive to the ruminants as any and all crops will release methane once they start to decompose, so if we get rid of cows we will have huge decomposition landfills in order to create plant based fertiliser, which will just release constant methane and be a definate explosion hazard as current landfills are (there have been cases of former landfills which were converted into something exploding). Cows allow for us to do this exact same thing but more safely, we do use manure as a major fertiliser afterall. Why is no one asking where the Carbon comes from?
Isnt there a thing where if simething is more efficient you use it more or something? Like if you have an led lightbulb which lasts a long time, you will be more comfortable leaving it on because it costs less. Might something like this happen with the land freed up from everyone not eating meat? Im vegetarian btw
who gives a shit meat is amazing
So basically it's not complicated.  Meat=bad
that’s precisely why i’m vegan, and they didn’t even got into all the cruelty that also goes in the meat industry
I say we should take the Soylent Green route.
Is meat production really that bad for the environment? Short, over-simplified answer: Yes, definitely! There's a reason my wife and I have moved towards reducing meat in our diet. Besides, diversifying your protein intake is tasty, healthy and fun.
7:20 could that title be any longer
The thing with talking in generalities about "beef" and "pork" and "chicken" is that it assumes that all breeds offer the same returns and the same inputs.  This is incorrect.  Over the decades a single breed has come to dominate production in each of the big three. This is due to breed associations lobbying and marketing as well as industry pushing for, size, shape, weight etc metrics.  Take beef, the most prominent breed might just be the worst one to be producing when it comes to inputs and CO2 costs. where they can  get 50-60% cut-ability rates, while other breeds can get 70%+ while requiring the same or less inputs.  Agriculture has a huge role to play, and once of the first things that can and should be done is looking at the breeds that are being produced and changing to more efficient breeds.  Couple that change with feed input changes, and reductions in CO2 grow while also increasing quality (this is just another way of saying, stop feeding animals corn). I am glad thee video, even lightly touched on this subject, since it never gets any attention.
The thing is that it doesn't matter. Hear me out, the carbon from beef comes from the carbon in the plants which comes from the air. That's the carbon cycle. The only reason the CO2 is climbing is by the introduction of new carbon to the cycle (through fossil fuels). If we stopped all fossil fuels now, the carbon cycle would stay in place exactly how it is now (minus some little variations over time of course). So let's just stop it, bury the excess carbon and fuel ourselves with wood.
Who cares about climate change when 100 corporations cause 70% of carbon emissions.  I expected an episode about health impacts/benefits of eating meat. It's disappointing that you focus on climate change for views, as it's the "cool kids" subject nowadays.
I eat chicken and pork almost exclusively for meat now... who can afford a 20 dollar steak for a meal every other night?
This video single handenly made me vegan.
Guys there's an easy solution! Just stop eating!
Thatveganteacher watching this video....
Lol I always find it funny, the earth will be fine. We won't destroy the earth. We'll just destroy are ability to live in it.  It's a giant rock, our existence is nothing more then a bad cold for the earth.  It will over time, fix itself.  Climate changes isn't about the planet, it's about us been able to survive on it.  Imma eat my beef now.
Solid video, i appreciate the summary at the end where you fix any false implications people may have drawn as well. One of the main issues as far as i understand is that our expectations for food quality is exceptionally high, resulting in all the lower quality food being used as animal feed rather than as regular produce which just confuses the issue more. Though people should be aware that there are outliers on both sides such as almonds which take vast amounts of water causing desertification if not properly managed.
Ooh Kurg upload means it’ll be a good day
If we spend our entire lives worrying about the future, we'll never have an opportunity to enjoy the present. Of course global warming is an issue, but if the solution is to become a vegan, or even worse, eat lab meat, then I'm sorry but I'm gonna be selfish. I am never giving up real authentic meat. You'd have to make real meat illegal for me to even consider switching, but what is more likely is I'd just replace my meat consumption with an increased consumption of high sugar/fat/salt foods instead. I've tried cutting meat out of my diet and it was literally the most depressing half a year of my life. Vegan alternatives just aren't the same.
While I love meat, it's sad it causes so much emission. I really hope that meat alternatives and lab-grown meat get what they need to develop further and thrive, so meat lovers like me can still enjoy a big steak without killing the environment in the process.
I think eating 70% less meat is feasible. Americans eat most of it anyway.
You should do a 'what will happen if climate change doesn't change
Minor peeve, but the thumb for this video is pretty... tasteless. Cows don't love meat. Cows HATE that we LOVE meat. Whether we'll care or not is an ongoing debate, but to depict the slaughtered as loving their slaughter is just... slimy.
Rather than removing meat entirely, you could replace beef with mutton and chicken to reduce emissions significantly.
save the wrold stop eating now!
Dislike here.
I hope lab meat develops further and becomes the new meta and efficient way to generate meat without animal suffering.
All vegetarian and vegan campains are just bull crap to  make food more expensive.
make a video about how to turn into a bird
'The main issue with beef are the gasses related to simply being mammals'.  People are mammals, and the gaseous emissions are the issue, so the conclusion is that there are too many people, gotcha ;)
Few weeks later in my youtube recommendation: The Vegan teacher attacks Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell
Me who lives on a third world country, only eating beef in like once every three months: *Interesting*
So, if you have less population, grass fed meat can be enough for all. That kinda suggests me that you are overpopulated.
Watching while eating beef
@kurzgasagt you guys are always so influential and it's always crazy how much information you provide per video to become knowledge but.... im sorry I just love meat to much to be willing to give it up.
I'm gonna replace beef in my diet with vegans. The way I see it, it's the best thing a meat eater can do for the environment. Prove me wrong.
me eating a burger while watching this video
People can't stop eating beef, but they can eat less. If we only keep the luxury grade beef that people can only afford eating a few times a year, it will make a change.
Oh man, can't argue with that.  Unless you like this. In which case this is an argument that eating meat is good
Question: Let's say Elon launches a Falcon 9 Heavy Rocket into space. How many people would have to quit eating beef for a year to offset the emissions of that one rocket launch?  That might give a little perspective to how the consumer class is not pushing climate change; it is the industrial class. We don't need to change our behavior. We need LEGISLATION.
*"When you first saw meat, were you blinded by its majesty?"*  I love meat. If there's food that as tasty as meat that's not meat, I'll gladly change to it 😂
Does human food include pet food?
I wish I could see the breakdown of differences that make some beef 10x more efficient than another?  That seems like a cray scale
Meat is good. Eat more meat, less sugar and less bread.
Kurzgesagt is the best channel on Youtube. I said what I said
I would like to see a similar analysis on what our crop yields would be if we discontinued the use of polluting petrochemical-derived pesticides and fertilizers which are definitely doing dramatic harm to the planet but are conveniently ignored by focusing exclusively on CO2 equivalents.  I guess since animals are emitters the fact that plant based agriculture is leading to massive disruptions to natural ecosystems and a key contributor to the ongoing mass extinction would be considered a good thing by this framing.
am vegan
watching this video while having my steak really have me thinking
We here in Brazil are not able to eat much beef anymore bc we dont have money to eat. All our land is taken by mineration, beef production and soy and a large part of it is for exportation. Our actual president has financial suport from the guys of these industries and, unless the world stop to buy these things from us, forcing we demonetise these production, we are fated to see our forest burn without political power or money to do anything.
Now do a video about buffalo meat. Bcz people who are forced to give up beef end up eating buffalo anyway. It literally has happened in my cuntry. They banned beef. So everyone who ate beef switched to buffalo instead. What good will that do?
I prefer farm animals to people, people are the problem
Don't care. Ate an extra burger while watching this video :)
Just bought your book "Immune" It's awesome! Keep up the good work.
Is Meat REALLY Bad For The Climate? (Original upload title of the video)
CO2 and methane is a joke compared to water steam which makes 95% of greenhouse gases. Sooo we are trying to make our lifes misarable to chip away 1% from 5% which won't change shit. Great idea, think again.
The other down side to telling ppl to only go local is not everyone lives in an environment where they can just go local. Some places are just too hot and some places too cold
One thing i think is worth mentioning for trying to convince people to cut out animal products is you go directly to the sorce of energy instead of the food going from growing, to be fed to the animal and then to you
i love  how kurzgesagt is so high quality its insane how good the videos thanks for some great content
9:27 it is quite misleading to compare the carbon dioxide produced in a year to what we could save in 100 years. You make good videos but that stuck out to me.
Im the dislike button
For the most part I hunt for my meat. When I can at least
4:30 this didn't correct for nutrition value right?
i'm still waiting for your video on Thanos and his CO2 footprint
I knew most of this and understand it all. Still would eat a T-bone steak every day of I could...
Stuff like this has led me to the conclusion that veganism is the only real "organic" diet. (Organic in the sense that it minimizes animal suffering and climate impact.)
I've seen this in German already and wanted to see how other countries opinion is on the matter. But then I remembered dislikes have been disabled *sigh*
The angry anti vegans are hilarious in the comments.
so at the end of the day if we want to go full vegan and stop beef production to stop global warming we will also need for all cattle to go extinct, right?Else they will still emit methane and co2 just by being alive.I wanna see what a vegan animal activist will say about this lol.
Meat is awesome.
4:44 and how do the not animal products get transported? Thats not a fair conparison (when taken out of context). I think this visualization, at least, is wrong.
Okay you talked about beef, because that is the biggest influence. But why do you then grab all the agriculture land. That is not a good comparison, because even if we stopt eating meat there is a big part of that land that is still needed for production of feed for people and animals including cows that are held for milk production. This is also where the debauts are about, because I see a lot of people that are like no more meat from animals. But what do we do then with the animals that are left after they stopped producing for example milk and eggs. Do we just burn those animals in a big pit and where do the gasses from that end up?
It's rapid climate change now?
Throughout history there's always practices we look back on and wonder, why couldn't they see how harmful this was. Meat consumption will be part of that category. A plant based diet is the future for humans.
Even if you dont eat it, there will still be people eating it and meat on the shelf.
Am I bad to not care too much about meat producing animal welfare?  Even a 5 year old can figure out industrialized animal farming is 'better' than free range, natural, biologic,  or whatever marketting word you want to put on it.  People who champion that usually have plenty of money.
Eating meat, cheese and eggs is an addiction, you can even have withdrawal symptoms
Luckily for me, I don't even like beef that much ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  That burger made out of veggies that is indistinguishable from real beef is the future Bruh. Ppl need to just eat that instead.
I’ve always understood where meat comes from, and had be considering going vegetarian for years, but after a recent passive experience I had with cows being turned into meat, I’ve finally decided to try to go vegetarian (currently a “pescatarian” at the moment 😅).  Cool to see that my decision is also helping out the world though.  Nice bonus to my decision 😅.
Please watch gary yourofsky's speech on veganism on YouTube please and end animal cruelty also check out earthling Ed and joey carbstrong for more information please 💚💚💚💚😇
Imma eat more beef
I'll just fucking die already
What's the carbon foot print of Printed meat?
Meat isn't the problem, its what we feed our animals that is. Everyone needs gigantic cuts of the finest steaks and pork and it involves shoveling massive amount of cultivated foods, the largest user of fresh water, into them and having them be insanely large. Ruminants like cows, chickens, goats and (noninvasive) pigs are literally nutrition up cycling machines, they eat the grass, tubers, and seedlings that have no nutritional value to humans and turn it into many pounds of nutrient dense meat. They do this quite well on land that cannot otherwise be cultivated due to poor ground conditions such as rocks and a lack of vital minerals.   2/3 of the livable land on earth is like this btw, yet we find it necessary to dump insane amounts of resources into making land  farmable with a majority of what's farmed not even being used for human or animal feed and is sent straight to a factory to use even more resources to be further processed into some kind of oil or sugar that is killing us.   The most devious thing about all of this is that they've somehow managed to convince people meat is the problem when its just a symptom of the real problem which is our food system. People claim good science because they quote 10 year old articles from the WHO which have been debunked and the researchers have even admitted to omitting or out right misconstruing the information presented. Methane only lasts much longer in the atmosphere because most CO2 is quickly absorbed into the ocean, which acidifies it and makes it much harder for the algae that convert it into O2 to thrive and keep it in balance. Much like CO2 and water methane has a cycle of it's own which does not keep in the atmosphere for long and for all intents and purposes (unlike just about every other natural system on earth) has gone mostly unmolested by human activity. The amount of methane producing livestock and the methane they produce has flat lined and hasn't risen or fallen dramatically in the past 200 years, and yet suddenly now it's causing global warming. It's disingenuous at best and overtly malicious at worst to continue to point to methane as any sort of factor when it comes to global warming and the use of resources such as fresh water at large when researchers and climatologists have had the emissions of CO2 into the earth's atmosphere pinpointed as the number 1 cause of climate change for YEARS.   Just remember, history repeats itself, if you see companies like Beyond meat and the like claiming they are sustainable and forward thinking and "not your grandma's typical corporate conglomerate" you should be cautious. Companies have overthrown governments to make an extra few cents on bananas, millions of dollars were "charitably donated" to the  american heart association in it's infancy by vegetable oil companies when they dominated the cooking fat market and convinced america it was the healthier option despite the rise in heart disease and metabolic issues that rose sharply and lock step with the rise in the use of said synthetic cooking fats, and just a few years later the AHA comes out with their first health bulletin for the american people and suddenly animal fats which humans have consumed in excess for thousands of years are the cause of heart disease and that everyone should switch to vegetable oil. Point being the game of making money has not changed, and a majority of science is funded by companies, the fad today is sustainable and healthy, if a company can't pay for research that solidly concludes that their product is that, then they can definitely pay for some research that says the alternative is worse, has happened, and will continue to happen.   Note: i have nothing personally against beyond i just used them as a well known example, if you want meat made from plants then that's your decision and i support it, a big part of living in the free world is having the options and the freedom to choose what you consume and for what reasons, even if it kills you (sugar)
I would rather die early and eat affordable meat, than live a long life as a vegetation
9:44 Did that pizza have pineapples on it? Respect!  Also, this is probably a big reason why some veggie patty producers (Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods being the big names) are specifically targeting meat-eaters by making their plant-based "beef" mimic the real thing as closely as possible, down to sizzling on the grill. I had a vegetarian phase when I was in high school (I'm 26 now for reference), and veggie patties back then _sucked_; but I tried an Impossible Whopper from Burger King, and I probably wouldn't have been able to tell if it wasn't beef if I hadn't already known. (I also gave mom a bite without telling her what it was and her only comment was that it was a bit spicy.)
I'll never eat the bugs Klaus
It’s really not hard to cut meat from your diet providing you live in a country with alternatives, which accounts for pretty much every westernised country in the modern world
Thanks for posting again!
"The more animals suffer, the better they are for climate change." This is patently false. The reason they give is that they're spending less energy and the  food comes right to them, thus less gasses. This, to me, reads like a high school physics question: "Ignoring the energy used by the technology transporting the food, how much energy is saved..."  The quote source is also unsatisfactory. It is legitimately as if a high school student skimmed as many essays as they could on the topic to get a good quote and slapped in the first one they found. The source says, to summarize, that grain fed animals emit less in total green house gasses because they reach weight faster, and spending less energy grazing. This ignores several critical aspects of green house gas emission. First of all, I've already addressed how that grain is transported to the cows and how that would not be any more efficient greenhouse-wise than the cows finding it themselves.   Second, cows that graze are generally in grasslands. Grasslands are awesome for carbon capture. Grasslands need grazers to survive. Thus, cows grazing in grasslands means better carbon capture in that grassland. As for the methane and co2 emissions of cattle, most of it comes from their dung. That dung happens to be the best fertilizer you've ever seen, especially for grasslands. So cows not only do the necessary grazing to maintain the health of that grassland, but it also fertilizes it, speeding up the whole process.  This has been studied extensively, and is generally common knowledge to those who are actually involved in cattle farming (not factory farming). I can source it too, look up University of Alberta "Grazing livestock could reduce greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, study shows".   That's not the only source, it's actually hard to find anything claiming that factory farms are worse for emissions than grassland. In my mind, factory farms are the enemy, both in their treatment of animals and the affects they create on the environment. I don't know what their reason for it is, but to explicitly claim that the humane alternative is actually worse for the environment when that's not only false, but actually very hard to argue it's in any way true. I'm having a hard time imagining any intent here other than nefarious, unless they really did get that lazy in their research which might even be worse.  Making this claim discourages people from seeking or fighting for a more humane alternative. If they assume this to be true, then they're effectively forced to make a moral choice between factory farms or no meat at all. Why would you fight for more humane meat when it's worse for the environment, and why would you let meat be a thing if there's no humane way to do it? I seriously can't tell if this video is propaganda for meat factories or the anti-meat population, it honestly kind of serves as both.  Long story short, you're wrong, and the in which you're wrong actively discourages every productive course of action that could be taken in the meat production conversation. I normally like these videos but shitty misinformation and half truths like this are exactly the reason no progress has been made in getting rid of factory farms.
Thank god I can't see the dislikes on this video
no chance you see this comment, but i have a video idea, when will humanity end?
There are farming methods that do not rely on deforestation. That is, people have farmed crops in harmony with existing forests, cultivating both the trees and the useful crops that grow among them. I'm no expert on these farming systems though, so anyone interested in learning more than that they exist, please google.  Other than that nitpick, excellent video!
im acutally curious if they accounted for feed that is not human consumable such as seed hulls, pulp of tomato and sugar beats, etc. i imagine it could effect the total and perhaps even in a substantial way.
Please add Turkish subtitles too!
I will live a maximum of 80 years, I ain't spending it eating veggies.
algorithm comment
Okay, so what is you guys' opinion on the notion that water vapor is the most biggest/impactful greenehouse gas?
Hi. I used to be a meat lover, and still am somewhat. However, over the past few years, I've found myself opting for vegetarian options when I eat out. There are lots of perks that come with it- vegetarian dishes are usually cheaper, they're healthier, and for the reasons described in the video, they're better for the planet.  I've tried meat substitutes and they are honestly delicious. My favorite is a black bean burger!  My point- just try vegetarian/vegan dishes every once in a while. You'll develop a taste for them, and you might end up liking them better than meat.
well there is impossible burger
Can't wait until lab-grown meat hits stores
Because of "the Science", half of the world is in the totalitarian regime... And the same for the last 50 years happening in our food chain. Sound ridiculous, if you think about it, that some farts from animals, that lived with us for 10.000 years going to destroy the planet :D
I'm doubting we could ever cut the other 74 % of emissions, so maybe 26 % isn't too much for food. This reminds me of the Bitcoin energy debate. It uses as much energy as (insert small European country), but at the same time we build an entire F1 track for racing combustion engine vehicles, then turn it into a parade of lights for the holidays. There is just no will to cut emissions or energy usage, so this is really more of an 'angels on the head of a pin' kind of discussion, because we are not getting rid of beef...
You can feed cows sea weed that emits less greenhouse gases.
If you want a good video that argues that changing you diet away from meat won't make much of a difference, have a look at What I've Learned's "Eating Less Meat Won't Save the Planet: Here's Why" and his various follow-up videos and articles, since it is probably the best researched and most nuanced take on the debate that I've seen so far.
Please make a video about lab grown meat!
No meat for 2 years and I feel great! Dropped weight. What made me make the choice to change was watching the movie mr.Rodgers
Thanks for this video, there are a lot of "educational" videos on YouTube now that are thinly veiled attempts to comfort people who already eat meat from the reality of the damage it's causing. It's good to see a channel that doesnt shy away from the truth even if it isn't what people want to hear
Soooo... Eat more meat then? Okay.
Most part of Brazil's farms are in "cerrado" biome, there are almost no industrial farm in Amazon rainforest biome.
I'm not exactly going to go vegan, not now nor ever. Even if I can agree that meats tend to cause a lot of emission production. Because as said in this video, meat can keep us alive for far longer than plants. So we must make plant production increase tenfold if we're going to sacrifice all meat, or maybe more. And if we do so we solve absolutely nothing.   Just eat your damn peas, stanley. And eat your chicken.
I’m glad I was eating a vegetarian meal when I put this on.
For first 1000 people? It been one hour and this video have 324 000 views :D
I'd like to see the comparison between meat and organic produce. Not that one is better, but to better understand our food production
What an amazing channel, You guys keep putting out nothing but gold, can’t wait to use the gold Dino calendar for next year, super cool
This video overlooks that the beef industry is not just food. Resources from a single cow are used in multiple industries while crops have a much more limited variety of uses. It's comparable to having a single wild card in in uno vs a single colored card. I'd much rather have a hand full of wildcards than a hand full of red cards.
Meat production has clearly gotten out of hand. We don't have to stop eating meat, just reduce consumption, and be a bit more clever about it.
I like how they detailed how ass-backward meat production is for 10 minutes and then end it with "its complicated". We are all slowly killing ourselves in large part because so many people can't imagine going an hour let alone a couple days with stuffing a sausage down their throat.
Is kurzgrsart vegan?
It’s official: ‘stonks’ is a word
I've missed you guys
As a person with many food intolerances and allergies I wish I could feel toward food how this opening described it...
Kurzgesagt: Beef is bad Indians: **smile in cow love**
"The worst emitters are farms burning down rainforest for farmland, especially in Brazil"  Sounds like Brasil is the bigger villain in the climate change war. You could try mentioning that only 7.6% of Brasil land is destined for farms. While the US has 45% and Europe has 39% of its land dedicated to farms. Sure you want to make a point but this kind of statement seems a bit too aggressive when you put other countries' statistics in contrast.
OMFG! This topic again. I've seen so many documentaries, media, the most recent one being Dominion. I surely have reduced consuming meat. Red meat I quit long back. Chicken, I am conditioned to the taste & can't help myself. No matter how brutal visuals I watch, I can't omit this from my diet. I mean they are made to be eaten. Fish & prawns, I relish.  And India & beef don't really go hand in hand, so I can't relate to the CO2 emission thing. And what about regions which aren't agriculture or vegetation friendly? Arid & icey regions? Should they stop eating meat? Realistically, all these arguments against meat seem stupid at a certain point. In short, demography & geography matter when it comes to meat consumption.
Meat is murder 🙃
“Mm yes, eat the bugs to save the planet”  Why not just eat urbanites at this point since they’ll produce far more greenhouse hasses than a bunch of cows farting while also contributing infinitely less to society than cows ever will?
Just genetically modify domestic cows combined with these "alternative" solutions like we've been doing for like what, ever since we domesticated plants and animals? It wont be easy, but it ain't easy to convince people to change either.
Not hating the video but basically all this happens ..... In your dreams -Yae Miko
Great video!
Nicely done. There are some who are methane calculations are incorrect at the 25% number but that's ok. Please make a video about entomophagy. It could be the future of meat.
So grass fed beef CAN be worse than factory raised. But how often it actually is worse? The possibility of something being worse does not mean that it actually IS worse.
Nice try Bill Gates, I'm gonna eat my steak now.
Co2 is good for the planet it is a bakance, the more Co2 the more vegetation and forest growth which eventually lowers Co2
reminded me of What I've learned channel's criticism video
The problem with all these LCA is that they presume ecology of scale rather than prove it
Imma be real with you Bill, I don’t care if the planet dies in a fiery explosion, I will never stop eating chicken or beef.
I think the video is fine overall but it's trying to make a very complicated thing seem very simple, and in doing so, takes a few shortcuts.  The style of farming, the country and the feed all change the results quite dramatically.  Besides the type of meat itself is probably rhe most important factor, glancing over the subject and talking only about beef which is supposed to be the "worst" Really tells something about the biases of the makers of this video.  I think putting pressure on the people to change instead of the governments isn't the best way to move forward.
Obviously we can't stop doing what we are doing, so lets just burn it all down! No way that will back fire. -.-
Go vegan for the animals. They feel pain just like human animals do.
i am curious how lab-grown meat factors into this, because that meat doesn't come from nowhere. does lab-grown meat, based on current technologies and projections, help this problem?
"150 times less than" is simply wrong...
So I should switch to a french fry based diet is what I'm hearing
Climate change could be resolved to pre-industrial levels in the next few years if every government planted 1 tree for every 2 people in their respective countries. Here in the UK all we have to do is plant 40 million silver maple trees taking up less land than our smallest national park, the South Downs has a area of 1,641 Sq Km this is enough for over 70 million fully grown Silver Maple trees, this would take out 11 tonnes per tree over the next 55 years reducing the amount of Co2 by 775 million tones in 55 years and after that all that needs doing is to build houses with the lumber and replant. If the UK did this with every available unused plot of land we could remove our quota of Co2 in a few years. I would rather plant a few trees than give up beef :)
Bro just use hydroponics and aqua ponies for fish and get grassy patches/enclosures for sheep chicken cow ect
Thank you for this video! It has really helped me confirm that beef is the most dangerous food for the environment!
is this a deja vu or did they already upload this before
Global warming is the great filter
Nah I think I’m just going to keep eating tons of beef raise and eat the cattle etc
What will I do about that fact? Continue to eat meat :D
Well yeah, but i've seen other kurzgesagt videos about this topic, it seems that they got a really strong bias, this one is a bit more hidden but the other ones you could feel it xD Nice vid btw, didn't know ships were so eco-friendly
Kurzgesagt: Methane is a greenhouse gas.  Me: I ain't gonna fart anymore.
Wowww , really opened my mind. Thank you kurgezagt for this lovely video. Turning vegan right now
Thank you so much for putting this together! This is probably one of the best produced videos about meat consumption and CO2e emissions I've seen before.
What can i do about the situation?
I normally like your content, but animals do not burn fossil fuels, so all their carbon comes from plants that pull it out of the air the first place. Cows are not ADDING any carbon to the air. Converting to methane is bad, but any wild animals (like buffalo did before people killed them all) would do the same, or unkempt forests or swamps would produce methane too. Maybe there are more animals on the planet than before human cultivation, but they are not add NEW carbon to the atmosphere -except for the fossils fuels used to transport the food that you mention. So, this is all natural.  Deforestation is different problem. That is about fixing the situation of poor farmers, not stopping rich people eating beef.  The climate change narrative is a Luddite anti-progress religion that offers to replace the Western Christian guilt complex -with a sprinkle of Marxist anti-capitalism mixed in. The World was hotter in the stone-age (before the last big ice-age). This is scientific fact not a computer model. Let’s just get over ourselves.
I try cut back on meat but sometimes like yesterday I eat a whole tone of it.
What are you doing . Make videos about our galaxy , universe as fast as possible ....
Nice Video!
What a very one sided video
Not all crops grown for animal consumption could be used for human consumption. Here in Canada, animal feed is often made from screenings or heated/otherwise contaminated feed that is not safe for human consumption. Erogot for example, humans can only safely consume wheat that is 0.04% ergot. Animals such as cows can handle a fair bit more than that. You have to be careful not to use too much ergot in either case because a high enough dose can induce abortions in livestock.
My main thing about vegan diets is the fact that you have to supplement A LOT of vitamins and essential amino acids and nutrients. That consuming meat, especially red meat, covers in spades and is the reason why we as humans are omnivorous. I feel that just cutting meat cold turkey isn't the entire solution here, sure environmentally speaking it would aid a lot. Yet practically speaking I'm not sure it would be the entire picture, given you would would have to look into other resources in order to make up for the missing nutrients. As a society I am unsure if we are entirely there to transition to a full vegan diet, along with some may not be able to even partake in a vegan diet in concern with allergies and the such.   I know a lot of vegan like to peddle that its a natural diet, or is healthier, but the truth of the matter is that vegan diets are not natural, nor are the necessarily healthier. Go ahead and burn me at the stake for saying this if you wish, but in truth a lot of vegans can be in poorer health than people that are omnivorous in their dietary intakes. Given vegans tend to be insufficient in important nutrients, like vitamin B12 for instance, given plant based foods. Do not contain an adequate amount, and means that you have to supplement your daily intake in through pills and the such. Along with vegan diets sometimes can be less healthy if you consume a lot of processed foods, which tend to contain a lot of sugars in them. Which is counter intuitive to a "natural" diet, with the latter being means your not exactly eating the healthiest diet.  The other thing I feel that wasn't covered well was that even if we remove a lot of these meat farms, some of it would still be taken up by new farms. That would grow plant based crops given the surge in demand and need for plant based foods. That would to me mean that all of the land being given back would have to be taken up again,  in order to ensure enough food is grown. With famine and crop diseases being another consideration that wasn't covered. As another issue with plant based crops is companies tend to grow clones of a single crop type, which as seen currently with bananas. Doesn't end well as if any singular disease were to crop up, entire crops would be annihilated before new ones could be grown to replace them. In which we would need crop diversity to avoid and compensate for all of this. Which in turn would cause a need for more farm land to ensure that crops are grown separately to avoid cross breeding given how our society works when it comes to crops.  Meat helps to bridge this gap by proving an alternative source, which sadly to me makes it a bit necessary to perpetuate currently, until new solutions are found.   While I do agree that we need to do something about our carbon impact, and I tend to agree with most of your videos, this one I take a little issue with. I feel that there are other solutions to the beef issue that aren't being considered, like lab grown meats. That would cutout the animal entirely and seriously reduce the amount of carbon emissions, and give back land that is currently being used in meat production. Achieving the lessened carbon foot print, while also maintaining the supply of meat, with the only solution I could possibly see for a practical global vegan diet. As suggested, would be highly processed foods fortified with nutrients that are missing from a vegan diet. To ensure that dietary needs are met, which is again is counter intuitive, but the only practical way to pull this off.
Except when you eat carbs from these "low emission" food, you fart a lot more and you store any fat you eat when your brain starts using Glucose specifically rather than using ketones broken down from fat
Cool new video. Still not eating vegan.
"And just for a moment, Life was perfect" 🎵🎶
Unfortunately, you as an individual can't actually affect anything.  If one person stops eating meat for a day, that just means one more steak goes bad in the market.  Doing simething about climate change on the foid side would require a mass change in diet and the production chain.
I dont even buy beef or lamb from the store anymore, I savor it as a special treat for restaurants. Meat at home is pretty much just poultry, pork, and occasionally seafood or wild game. It's much easier on the wallet and I just dont find daily consumption of beef as pleasing as daily consumption of poultry or another meat. I dont plan on going vegan/vegetarian (tried it for a year, not my thing) but I am definitely for making some meats a luxury again.
Well it’s complicated
Why westerners just can't be vegans if climate change is such a big issue.
One of the only pleasures you can enjoy daily... Lol
fuck it imma eat beef and bring the world down with me
Who else saw the immune system cell Easter egg at 9:46
You are mixing Poison with honey.
Yeah nice video, but i dont see how i can continue a healthy ketogenic diet without meat soooo.... Lets chop some cows up! Daddy needs his ribeye.  Oh and f off with that soy bs, i dont need that estrogen. There are already enough mentally ill people out there...
OK so gonna have to fact check your information on feeding soy to animals because the soy products we feed to animals are biproducts of soy production that humans cannot eat.
Why no one ever talk about the fact that methane emitted from animals is part of a cycle and as it goes into the atmosphere, it also come back? The carbon you are emitting while eating meat has been taken from the atmosphere by the grass the cow has eaten, not from the underground. This is different if u drive a car, because the emission you are doing is NOT part of a cycle. You are taking Carbon from underground and pump it into the atmosphere. I say this is game changing and NOBODY talks about it! Emitting greenhouse gasses from eating meat is substantially different from emitting greenhouse gasses that take the carbon from underground.
0:02 is food really that enjoyable ? Idk i just don't crave food. I'll say being able to spend time on phone alone by myself is more enjoying than eating.
Can someone crate the" beef stonks" meme?
Noooo way am I going for local beef, I love my imported Australian beef just how it is thank you very much
Me as a student living in dorm Involuntary vegetarinism
What if we normalized eating plants and animals from the environment? Up until the industrial revolution we still hunted and gathered for a solid part of our diet. Of course there was still plenty of farms and stuff but people still ate the local flora and fauna.
Lesson from this: Be Vegan for Earth
but meet is sooooo good...
Please make a video about moving to our insect based meat production diet because I’m thinking about starting of insect farm for using as substitute for meat products
If Kids were Shown, how Beef is prepared in slaughter houses, They'll definitely stop eating it! 😀😀😀
yeah still eating beef but good to know? maybe I'll cut down on beef consumption  to once a week tho
I'd love to stop eating carbon-releasing meat products, but BEYOND and IMPOSSIBLE aren't there yet. Maybe someday.
I’m going to invent a livestock burp and fart capturing device
10:21 THAT SWEATER WENT STRAIGHT THROUGH THE MACHINE BRUH! I WANNA LEARN HOW TO DO THAT!
Sounds like most people have gotten unhealthy these days due to our reliance on highly processed foods, seed oils, and grains.  Unhealthy people are the biggest cause of climate change due increase in diseases, cost effectiveness, social and political impacts.  Our reliance on soybeans, sugar, gains, and processed food only profits large corporations, and are the worst destroyer to people in terms of obesity, increase in cancers and other neurological diseases.  I can’t believe that meat gets the worst reputation these days, despite the fact that it’s the most nutritious food to us in terms of human evolution.
10:08 I decide to throw this information in to the bin...like the veggie patty
Feed the body not please the tongue - I do eat quite a bit of meat, but also be an opportunist to eat healthy stacking fruit and veggies when available, seldom consume refined sugars opting for natural sources, and sparingly or avoid anything too heavily processed when possible.
I think this video emphasizes too little, on the fact that we need husbandry to fertelize the crop land, after being degraded too much by farming and in need of a "reset".
What if it was made a requirement for all animal farms to collect the methane and store it? The fuel could be used for power as well
thanks for this vid
You didn't hit on the nutrition difference in practice. Beef and meat is way more nutrient dense than plant based. So how much more would we have to farm and eat to get the same amount? Once you multiply that into the mix, the difference is so little that it's virtually pointless. The larger problem is the population growth for humans on top of that. Even if we get rid of cows and their emotions, the human growth would just replace the cows. Besides, without the cows, there wouldn't be any fertilizer for the crops for humans. So we are in a symbiotic relationship with our farm animals. They can't live without us taking care of them, and without the shit they produce, we can grow food to eat. So we can't even go completely vegetarian because the crops won't grow.    I get the idea that food production overall is high emissions, but food should be lower on the totem pole of problems when we need to be switching to long term nuclear and geothermal energy and leave solar and wind behind as the failures they are. On top of that, we need to switch back to steam power and using clean burning fuels like natural gas and biofuels for engines. A stems engine turning a generator to power electric motors would be more environmentally friendly than electric cars that require coal burning plants to recharge. Not getting a real difference accept you can't go more than a few hundred miles. A steam engine/electric would work like a normal engine with no dangerous emissions and could replace everything.   Lots to discuss, and need to figure out how to proceed. But in all honesty, we outgrown our planet. We need to either down size or colonize the moon and Mars, possibly Europa and the asteroid belt.
NO, meat is NOT bad!
Video suggestion: Can you guys show us the current status of lab grown meat and vertical farming technology? Love your work!
This it the 2nd video you've made on this EXACT topic atleast!
Can't wait for my beef stew later today :)
I don't really care
Judeo communist nonsense
Wonderful video!
First off, nice clickbait thumbnail.  Second off, you really glossed right over the factor of human food consumption. You managed to touch on some of the key information to that line of discussion, from the calorie density of different foods, to a brief nod to the amount we consume, to the fact that eating food is mandatory, and yet you all but ignored the issue of actually feeding the human population. Maybe instead of analysing old remarks about climate change and beef exclusively, you should analyze the practicality of changing this at all and still succeeding to feed the population at the same degree or higher.  It's all well and good to say replacing ranchland with wildlife and rainforest land could reduce carbon dioxide levels by vastly more than we produce it, but you might want to stop and think about how that'll reduce the human population, given we already can't successfully feed our global population without cutting out the most calorie efficient food sources we have access to?
Nah, meat is great. People are bad, i think we should stop manufacturing more and buy them online instead.
Human life > Any animals life
So lets see here. 1 Cow gives us rounded up 200kg of beef (199.518kg). 1 kg of Beef gives 260g of Protein. Which is enough to feed a Family of 5 with a average weight of 52kg per person. So a single cow in this case, produce enough food to give 1000 people with the average weight of 52kg food for a day. This is if we go by that each person need 0.8-1g of protein per kg of weight.  So how much potatoes do we need to do the same? Well 12kg of Potatoes is equal to 1kg of Beef. That means we need 2400kg of potatoes to feed the same amount of people for a day (Rounded up from 11.818181818181818181818182 per kg of potatoes to 1kg of beef in protein value).  Now anyone who can figure out why eating 12kg of potatoes is pretty much impossible gets a +1 to their intelligence stat. But eating 1kg of beef is way easier. But we can't sustain ourselves on Just beef or Just potatoes either. We are Omnivores, we eat *everything* because we need *everything*.  As an example with Iron. The average man age 18-50 need roughly 8.7mg of Iron per day. 1kg of Beef (Depending on the cut) gives 3.6g of Iron. Meanwhile Potatoes are difficult with Iron. A single 295g of Unpeeled, Boiled and added Salt Baked Potato, gives 3.2mg of Iron. Where roughly 50% of that comes from the Salt, and 50% from the Skin. And it also depends a lot on the type of potato and where it has been grown.  So it is very complicated, and there is no real answer. Also people take up how much water cows drink. Forgetting that most of that water comes from rain, rivers and lakes. Where over 70% of our drinking water goes to plantations. And the worst offender of drinking up water supplies are Almond Trees, but no one bats an eye about that, since they want their Almond Milk, which takes even more water to produce. So again, there is no good answer. And we can't just cut out food from our diet, since everything has something other things does not. And we need a lot of different things.
I hear you but I've already given up a great deal. I'm not giving up meat.
I think a lot of people view meat as a very nutritionally efficient food that they can't cut out of their diet because they're worried they might not be eating enough protein. As a society, we're not nutritionally educated enough to be able to plan our diet effectively, so we resort to the same foods we (and our parents) grew up eating.
We need more insect consumption. Oz for Oz they are the most protein packed option and they also require a fraction of the area to raise and a millionth of the feed.
I eat beef one time a month
Just replace urself and feel the pain  Is enough to make world vegetarian omm shanti omm❤️
I think the road block for most people is that it seems difficult too give up meat. But let me tell you - IT ISN'T. I've found it so ridiculously easy that I can't understand what all the fuss is about
Poghers
The sad part is that informative videos of this sort don't have more reach and are most likely to preach to the converted, while the average Joe is out there getting bombarded by fast food ads encouraging him to buy the latest whooper. Thanks for addressing this controversial, but important subject!
I like that Kurzgesagt stuck to the environmental issues but didn't completely ignore the ethical issues. Ultimately, the vast majority of meat consumption is voluntary rather than necessary, so an animal is being raised and then killed on purpose when it didn't need to be. Some people don't care about that, because they don't care about animals (or selectively care about convenient animals like pets), but that is a whole lot of voluntary killing. Then there is the suffering of the animals before they are killed, which as Kurzgesagt pointed out is directly related to the efficiency and environmental impact of meat production; less suffering is a result of production methods that also have a greater environmental footprint.  So, yeah, as much as meat is an important part of our culture, it is still voluntary and could be voluntarily given up. Doing so would be the ethical choice.
This is a one to one video from the channel What I've Learned
this is your third video about same topic, but I'm still gonna watch it

I'm a biochemical engineer and we might actually have a solution for global food issues  : I won't go into the details because there's a lot of interest and it's a very important technology but here that. This solution is so environment friendly that it's actually green and most people who tried it say it's like a ray of sunshine in there life. That's why we're thinking about calling it green sun or green soylent or something.  I'm sure you guys will love it.
"One of the most delicious foods: meat" is a very subjective statement. I look for objectivity in videos like this.
Thank god millions of people in India don't eat beef.
I say this to the crowd you would be better off growing your own food instead of giving money to factories that cause trouble to the environment you all do know that having a grass yard meant you were rich enough not to grow but can buy your own food. Help the environment and start using your yard have chickens and if you can't then you shouldn't be living in that area or at least changing that area to help yourselves. Also mind the fact you all think you all won't need too but as someone who knows what is coming you better start learning how very soon.
why was this reuploaded?
I wonder how bad sea food is if meat is that enviromentally damaging
CO2 this CO2 that. I think you can't have a discussion about meat if you don't mention the consequences of ruling out meat all together from peoples diet.
I got the calendar, it looks great! The illustrations are so pretty 😍
Love your videos as always, but why is it that you guys never talk about the advancements being made into lab grown meat? Particularly by harvard students?  It's a nigh ultimate answer to all of the concerns with meat production. It comes with absolutely no suffering to the animal (one need only an initial harvested sample of muscle tissue about the size of a rice grain to begin the culturing process), it entirely free of risk of contamination or disease that factory farming brings about, is real beef unlike the impossible burger, is the single most resource efficient way to develop and harvest meat because you are -only- growing the muscle tissue, not the whole rest of the animal along with it, and even addresses local transportation emissions because lab grown can be produced in urban facilities that are much closer to market as opposed to out in rural areas. And certainly doesn't require any deforestation to make room for it or for its food.  If the world invested into switching over from animal harvesting to complete independent muscle tissue culturing, all forms of meat would suddenly become morally vegan, and ecologically very similar to plant agriculture.
The vegans just haven’t had a properly prepared smoked brisket or perhaps a tri tip or ribeye or even flank steak cooked slowly over wood …. Beef is delicious!
Wonderfull propaganda piece. I loved the part where beef is the only meat people eat and the very reliable sources that are full of statistics without context.
I'd rather die than eat grass.
Really wish the topic weren't so emotional, so we could work together at a solution rather than shout at each other.
I don't know why so many people only care about the meat industry when it impacts global warming. The suffering of the animals should be enough.
Transport is overlooked here, yes shipping is more efficient but shipping food also has to be transported to your local shop, so it's like shipping + transport instead of just transport for locally grown and raised.
It’s a shame you didn’t talk about regenerative agriculture
💟
So happy you made this and are combating the animal ag.lobbies marketing lies. Great job!
There are some veggie burgers which pretty much taste the same or sometimes even better than meat... Ofcourse it's more expenisve, but I think a lot of people wouldn't mind switching if the taste and price gets better.
Buying local produce may not have an overall large impact on the environment, but does is at least have an effect on the local economy? One of the arguments I've heard for trying to buy locally produced products (food, items, etc) is that it increases the demand for work locally, which can help keep job opportunities within your community, and often with smaller local businesses, instead of large mega-corporations that will farm out labour (pun not intended) to foreign countries, where the pay is much lower and working conditions are not as good. From a moral and/or economic standpoint, is there still a benefit to buying locally, even if the environmental impact is tiny?
Angry vegans incoming
Lowering CO2 emissions is more important than anything else brought up in this video.
If gardenia burgur patties are sold in your country they are vegan and taste like meat!
Dislike button MIA (not that I would hit it here, great vid) but dang this is the first vid I’ve noticed it gone
Finally a new video!! Have a blessed day 😊😊
In one breath you guys discount the carbon sink that is cattle pasture (grass) and then say if the cows weren’t there we could have natural grasslands (grass). It’s literally the same thing, we just control which animals get fed by the grass.  Also, you may want to consider how grass and rumenants (animals which eat grass) evolved. Codependently. Get rid of the rumenants, the grass begins to die, bare patches are formed, the soil dries out, the soil microbes die, MASSIVE carbon is released and the land dies, turning into desert. Removal of roaming rumenant herds kills grassland.  The American Midwest was once a sea of grass with an average soil depth of ten feet as measured by the USGS. Nowadays the soil is only 1-2 feet. So where did all that soil/carbon go? And did slaughtering tens of millions of Bison perhaps contribute to the slow death of the prairie?
Would love a video about the James Webb Space Telescope.
Grass fed cows emit significantly more methane gas than those fed corn and beans but they reduce overall carbon emissions because they help soil sequester carbon. They also produce better butter and milk. This face should be taken into this video.  Do your own research.
this video making me sad
Unpopular opinion: I don't like meat but I like poultry
Climate change lies are a weapon for people to use to get there way with anything. It is nothing but a political manipulation tool.
Ok but I like the way meat tastes
If we can't eat beef let's eat the vegens
But are those vegan meat really better though? Because someone told me that vegan meats dont really make a difference
I like to point out to vegans that there are more microorganisms in their greens then there are in a cooked piece of meat and therefore the entire argument for not eating animals is based on ignoring that microorganisms exist.
4:26 and so on; not true you don't count the avocado transportation to the ship and from the ship.
The solution is easy. Go vegan and plant-based for the planet, animals and your health.
Screw eating, me and my homies photosynthesize.
Spoiler: yup. See: your non-offering of yourself at the local slaughter house.
Okay, that's disingenuous of you.  Humans don't grow crops just to feed herd of cows or sheep or pigs. We grow crops for us humans. The parts of the plants we grow but can't eat is processed into animal feed. 48% of any cereal crops is used feed humans but, the remaining 52% of the very same crop is used to feed animals. So is you have 100 acers of wheat 42% of the wheat crop can feed humans because that all we can digest of the plant. The other 52% of the plant is used to feed animals because they can digest it.  Same for soy and any other crop that we humans grow. We don't grow crops just to feed animal. We feed animals the parts of the plants we grow but can't eat. While I agree on the emission amounts, presenting it this incredibly vague and inaccurate way in regards to how crops are actually used by humans to feed ourselves and the animals we eat is just propaganda in my opinion.
There's no way in hell I'm gonna stop eating meat, it's just too good. I'd sooner just build an enclosure that filters and stores cow gas.  If what has been said is true, then that would solve the majority of the problem.
Can you do a video on dead internet theory and internet rot? Love to see your take on it.
finally I get an answer to those questions ! thanks a lot ^^
IN MY PERSONAL OPINION  If:  1) You care a minimum about animals 2) You're aware that we don't need meat to get the right nutrients  You don't need an evniromental reason to not eat meat, there's the ethical reason. Only a childish person couldn't agree with it. ( This is valid for people who share the 2 points i've made above, is someone doesn't care at all about animals obviously dont' share the ethical reason )
Thanks for this video :) No i can show this to all my friends who argue 'bout this topic without any knowledge. Now they get smarter
I think we should not think these sentient animals as food. We view them as food because of marketing. They are similar in terms of our ability to feel pain and suffer emotionally. Killing them means we are robbing their lives and freedom. We won't accept if same fate happens to us. Now we have plenty of options to choose from. Even our ancestors were plant eaters before recent ice age 2.5 mya. The  animal products are associated with increased risk factors for chronic diseases. Not only they are not good for long term health, they are detrimental to earth's resources and produce pollution and cause environmental destruction, not only beef, dairy industry is also among the contributors. Do what you have to do for overall wellbeing of all. Think logically. When it is practically possible to obtain taste, nutrient and energy from other sources for better health, why not switch to that?
is it wrong that i want less people over less cows if it means i could keep eating cows
And you Uploaded the video on Tuesday??
Sad you didn't talk about technologies that are fighting this, like animal food that makes cows fart less.
Artificial meat exists. Public pressure is demanded to make this into a viable option.
No way individual decision is going to make a change on this matter without the governments around the world stepping up and giving a damn.
Is meat really that bad?  Kurzegesagt: "It's complicated" Also Kurzegesagt: "But ya, it's really that bad."
Theres something psychotically selfish about thinking satisfying appetite (not even actual hunger) is worth killing one or several animals. How anyone who has ever bonded with a pet or any animal can just ignore what theyre doing is one of the things that makes me feel most of the world is completely insane.
What about reduce human population? It will solved most of those problems. :)
That 800 vs 50 comparison is misleading - 800 over 100 years. Vs 50 per year It should have been  8 per year vs 50 per year Or 800 vs 5000
At this point even if humans, livestock and pets were to go extinct overnight climate change would still be unnavoidable.
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive”  Proceeds to show that one of the tastier foods is destroying the climate. What am I supposed to do? Become vegan?! That's going to change one thing only, my life. The climate, society and everything won't change with me. Besides, I don't want to. And by "I", I mean human being, as in me and everyone else. Make a vegetable based meat that's as good and as expensive or cheaper. Then, and only then, anything will start to change.
I tryed soy spagetti and I loved it even i dont saw a diffrence from pork bolonase spagetti !!! :-)
Bullshit
Go Vegan
Is this also taking into account the nutrient density of grass fed vs factory fed? I’m sure it’s not too significant but I’m just wondering on how much of a difference It could make.
Bro seriously, how are we people actually killing living beings that can feel pain? Whether it emits carbon or not according to statistical data, killing animals is just worse. Especially when you are aware of it. We humans, are not just social animals. Humanity is literally 0% when we people are eating meat knowing that the animal is killed alive. Homicide is not a problem when we are actually the reason for thousands of animals getting killed for a meal which has better alternatives. No need to be a vegan, being a vegetarian is more than enough. Control your taste buds to prove that you are human and above other animals. Hope this changes some people's lifestyle in a positive way
Would really have appreciated a comparison of food to other sources of carbon in our lives. Also would've been nice to see a discussion in terms of carbon offsets. How many carbon offsets would I need to purchase to offset a meat heavy diet compared to vegitarian. From my research it was something like <$50 a year
Cultured meat is an option, I've also heard recently that giving cows seaweed as part of their diet reduces methane, and that doesn't take up any land area at all to grow.
Lol all the people in these comments thinking they know more than a channel that literally does a SHIT TON of research
Next month: Eat the bugs!
The biggest polluting places are big cities. Cities are creating their own atmospheres they pollute so much. You can watch a radar map of a snow storm turn to rain and back to snow as it passes over a large city.
SUIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
I sure do love my meat
Let's all not forget viruses come from animal agriculture
oh look im a popular youtube commenter im going to make a low effort meme about the first 20 seconds of the video because i don't actually care about the subject matter and i just want clout
"Let's stuck with beef, since it's such a outlier" - how's that fair, when the most consumed  meat is chicken? It's not like I expected fairness from Kurzesagt though. Also  carbon emissions all depend on the type of energy that is used. Because this is the only carbon that can be outside of the short cycle of carbon (meaning air-plants-animals-air) on Earth. I agree about deforestation being bad though.
Beef = Bad    (understood) What about pork or chicken? Can you compare that with vegie diet?  Or event better since there is such a great deal of research you have done: please tell/give a list of foods that we should not be eating because they are very destructive?  So far there's beef on that list, and some would argue almond milk and cashews are also super high on the list. Can you clear things a little bit?
Thanos was right
Now I am just really curious about how fish, mussels, snails, and insects compare🤔
8:15 free Stonks meme button
We just need another planet
this is so aimed lmao
I do have something to say, most of the food produsing plants only give like 25% of  the plant mass as something we can eat, the other 75% go to farm animals, and those are parts that we cannot eat from the crop.
Please no more virus videos , I’m here for the Final border type videos pleaseeeee🙏🏽💞
Time tu treat animals as junk to save planet then
This is one extremely misleading video which contradicts their own previous standpoints on things.
This is interesting but could you please make more videos about space, space travel, aliens and Sci fi stuff please? 🥺
imgona enjoy my horse steak so mutch now
I find the argument you make about transport cost faulty. How can something that is produced localy and transported directly to the store give more carbon emissions than something on the other side of the world? It still have to be transported from the production place to the nearest harbor, transported by ship to a harbor in the other country and then transported by truck to the local stores around the country. Is there another variable you are calculating with? Or are you just showing some parts of the transport cost?
9:27 this comparison is still concerning or is my math off?
Nope
No
Unforunately this video doesn't offer a lot of helpful info to folks who are trying to decide if they want to keep a handful of animals for their own or local use on land that really definitely is not suitable for crop or forest.  Here animals may have many uses besides just food.  Consider, for example, that a small herd might be used to regenerate a field between harvests, or that chickens might be used to keep a lid on pests.
Meat is good.
If we stop eat meat for climate change we also have to massacre a lot of animals
Vegan teacher when she sees the title:   Congrats!! you PASSED!!
👎
The real issue is not what we eat but how many people that need to be fed. If nations started enforcing policies that regulated reproduction and started thinning the human herd we would see significant reduction in several of our environmental problems.
First While I appreciate that you did cover the land use side of thing, I feel you could have done better on the feed side of thing, as just as not all land is equal, not all plant material is equal, and even with my limited understanding of animal feed I know it often contains material unsuitable for humans consumption Second many actually don't have much choice as not all food stuff cost the same, and on the protein front ground beef is amoung the more budget friendly options in my part of the US. Which leads into a common problems for many "solutions" to climate change, the inconvenient little people are inconvenient
Have you noticed how great the tune of this video is?
Grass-fed and grass-finished beef is the absolute healthiest version of beef so that's why I eat it. Also it would be really difficult to cut down on the amount of beef you eat considering 1 lb of beef is enough for two maybe three meals for me. But this is where fasting comes into play, since I'm only eating one meal a day typically one pound of beef can get me two to three days worth of food.
Thank you for this important video !
Short answer: yes
I once went accidentally vegetarian for few days and I decided I'll eat meat every day even if it kills me tomorrow.
Not leaving the beaf 🤠
Meat is not bad. I love meat. Meat loves me.
1:41 "entire carbon budget" hahaha lol who writes this bull s hi ts
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old”  Me on my 7th fap session: 😏
"The reality is, well, its complicated" Ah, Kurzgesagt. Never Change.
Amazing video. Thank you.
man i have to see the new video about meat as im eating a chicken sandwich
It's unfortunate you didn't mention that "doing your part" with climate change is ultimately fruitless because the majority of your audience's carbon footprint comes from government, and even then a 100% reduction in your carbon footprint frees a second or so of emissions. This is because the term carbon footprint was popularized by BP.
For the bloody agorthom
Let's use the vegans to produce more meat, they like to eat like cattle let's treat them like it.
0:04 I can thing of another bodily pleasure that can be enjoyed multiple times a day…
Corporations and bad practices are the most important part of the problem and the conversation on what the little man should do never stops, while the greedy elite move on without changing much at all. This is aggravating.
team trees, team seas, team airs?
Crickets
Lmao just after I click the vid mcdonalds ad suddenly showed up
In conclusion, the best way to reduce your carbon footprint is to die. You will produce carbon footprint anyway even if you live as hunter-gatherer.
im sorting by new comments to see some vegans that disagree. so far not seeing any though
This is such a heated topic. People usually get mad whenever I talked about this
Meat is meat and man must eat. I will not eat bugs, I will not eat “cultured” meat. I will not love in a pod. I will live my life and eat what I want to.   To think we can actively stop climates from getting cooler or warmer is ridiculous. “Trust” the science is what’s happened for the last 2 years and it’s killed economies, livelihoods, people, etc. I trust what I deem is trustworthy.
Amazing video as always! The only thing that I wish that you guys covered was lab-produced meat, but I guess that the video was long enough already...
Just ask a simple question: Do you eat bones? If not, artificial meat or veggie meat will be a more waste-less option.
Ofc meat is bad. It's gross smelly makes me wanna puke.
I've been in past countering Vegans in for of the argument about Non Vegetarian food being not so harmful with useless point. I now agree that Non Veg is harmful. But I won't change my diet that's all I can say. When Artificial Food with cost atmost 1.2x of original Non veg will come, I'll switch to that. But I won't be Vegan ever. That's all I can say. I'm not forcing anyone. It's my personal decision about myself.
So then Thanos was right.
Once again Kurzgesagt saves the day with a reverse clickbait
So I learned we need to send freight ships up the motorway to cut CO2 emissions
You WILL eat ze bugs
75% less meat production doesn't really seem that bad. Price of quality steaks and veal and tenderloin would get much higher and hunted meat would become more valuable but most likely stuff like mincemeat which we get in McDonalds beefs anyway wouldnt since its part dough anyway. The ratio of cheese vs meat on a pizza would start to favor cheese more heavily so I don't think most people would complain either. Just enough meat there for the same taste, the bulk of stuff filling your belly would be something else instead.
What about seafood?
is pork so much lower in emissions because it's less popular? Or is there something about it that makes it more efficient?
Thanks for the video. Have sudden urge to make beef Wellington.
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive” no it isn't. its a constant task given to us in order to stay alive. its not "the best" thing about being alive, its a criteria to staying alive.  if we could use some other way to fuel our bodies with energy, in a way that doesn't require hours of work each week to prepare the energy for consumption, and doesn't require us to risk food poisoning, ruining the environment, hurting other life forms, etc, it would be much better. basically, we need to remove the digestion system from the human anatomy and replace it with something more efficient.
How about the ethics of killing a sentient animal?
Thank you for sharing the information while making your opinion clear, but also not claiming you are right and not claiming or "hinting" (for lack of a better word) that people who disagree are dumb and wrong, like most people do on both side of the argument.
BEEF STONKS!!!! 💵 💰 💵
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old!"  There is another...
What about fish ????
Could you guys do this same sort of informational video about hunting and wild game? I'd love to know the environmental impact of that kind of meat consumption
What about deer meat you hunt yourself? Is that bad for the environment?
damn dude, what kind of gourmet stuff do you get if you think food is that good?
Keep the population of the world under 2 billion people... all problems solved. No need to kill anyone, people, fortunately, die out naturally. But require a permit to have a child. Don't allow criminals, trash, dumb asses and influencers to reproduce and you're done. Humanity's saved forever.
Nope, it's the best. I'd say the most important invention ever was the dawn of barbequeing.
"The more animal suffer, the better they are in term of climate change" Dayummmmm This is a real life plot twist for me, flip my believe upside down. :O
Cut government subsidies to the meat industry, and make meat more of a delicacy than something so commonplace.
To all the people in the comments promoting or hoping for some miracle tec to make cows not emit co2 or to make meat in labs, I come to tell you that your prayers have been answered. There is an amazing technique that, even not being new or revolutionary, is 100% at your disposal right now and will reduce your co2 emissions by a lot. Eat vegetables and let the cows alone.
"Specially in Brazil", I felt that. Great video as always, a really necessary reflection with true data to make us think for ourselves and make a decision
Love you Kurzgesagt <3
Kurzgesagt: You should eat less meat because it'll help the environment. Here's why.  Also Kurzgesagt: You should eat less meat because it's better for you. Here's why.  Also Kurzgesagt: You should eat less meat because it'll reduce the amount of animal suffering. Here's why.  Meat-eaters: I still need to see all the facts...
I love the way they are able to deliver such an impactful issue and still keep a neutral stand. They don't take any side, but give points for and against. This is a true skill. And I love this channel
2:38 PEACE, LOVE AND PLANTS!!!
I'm in favour of reducing meat consumption to a manageable level. We're not meant to eat this much meat anyway and we're already overproducing massively as compared to the reasonable needs of a diet that includes meat in it.
Why the focus on climate change? I think there more pressing problems in the world that are much easier to solve.
Nice vid, heres a gud vid idea. Make a vid about eating bugs. I have heard that its better than most other foods for the environment
I respect Kurzgesagt a lot. I even bought their new book! But this is by far their most biased video. Meat definitely has a not insignificant effect on the environment, don't get me wrong. However, comparing it's effect to only two separate plant items on the chart and not all vegetables is definitely going to make meat look bad. They have even said in their own videos that methane is barely a factor in global warming compared to carbon dioxide. They mention how nutrient dense meat is compared to other foods. People don't realize how many chronic and acute health problems one can avoided by not being nutrient deficient. Meat is a very convenient and easily accessible way to get the nutrients you need. Especially compared to this hyper processed "wonder" meat. You'd be dead in a month eating only beyond burger. They show how much better pasture raise meat is in this video, yet still demonize it by only mentioning transportation emissions and comparing it (again) to individual plant products instead of vegetables and fruits as a whole. Renewables in general have a massive impact on the environment. Huge amounts of land is consumed for wind farms and no one talks about the hundreds of thousands of birds (endangered included) that are killed by them. How about the massive toxic waste that is produced by solar panels that still have a short life span and can't be recycled? Or that 90 percent of what you put in the recycle bin doesn't get recycled? Properly implemented renewables are probably the long term solution, but right now, none of them come without major environmental consessions. Nothing humans do is without consequence and it is irresponsible to live life acting like it is even possible. Educate yourself so you can take care of your own health and that of your family in the best way you can. If that means eating vegetables do it. If it means eating meat, do it. Don't try to virtue signal. You'll just come off as uninformed and morally lazy.
Great video! Going to eat at mcdonalds a cheese burger with extra bacon tomorrow :)
you can eat your soy while i enjoy my steak, cheers
Kurzgesagt is vegan confirmed?? :O  jk, he's just stating facts ofc
Just eat less meat, It's that simple
Beef is almost fully banned in India
If we can ethically justify gassing pigs, electrocution of animals and slitting their throats when they see it happen and are aware (eg halal torture, I meant slaughter) then eat whatever tf you want but we still have no ethical arguments for meat consumption other then necessarily for surviving in a rare circumstance that majority don't even go through, if you value taste over morals then that's your choice ig, for vitamins you can take multi and those works just fine, b12 is stored in the body for years so going vegan won't cause b12 deficiency until later in life, there are no sound ethical justification for eating meat but arguments from lack of empathy and taste buds objectively speaking
I will eat the vegans high horse
theres millions of hectares of room/space around the world that are fit for growing forrests, its only a matter of time untill someone takes the damn lead and doese something for the world... the main problem remaining is the humans tho... but weve invented enough ways to kill ourselves its only a matter of time XD
The first point missed the mark. Yes calories and protein are better than weight, but we still need more insight. What about specific macronutrients plantfood is not providing? (B12, biotin, choline, creatine etc..) The cost to human health via healthcare, the cost of supplementation etc...  I was happy when you mentioned nutrition, but the point is unfortunately incomplete.
10:08 He gave us Information and it is our job to turn it into Knowledge and wisdom.
第一次看到这么新鲜的kuz视频
Wow, incredible video! I'm actually into intermittent fasting, so I'm doing my bit by just eating less in general 😉
This video in a nutshell: Go Vegan! Me: There has to be another way.
Cow be like: *I dont wanna become food*
Well, I basically always need to lose 10 lb so if I just stopped eating it's a win win :D
Me watching this video: "Daaaamn, that's crazyyyyyy😲"        Also me: 'orders KFC'
No, no it's not. Actually, it's great.
The only way forward is through innovation. Climate change is here and it is not going away. Focus on controlling the damage rather than trying to reverse course. Carbon/methane capture, nuclear power, seawalls, and heat/drought resistant crops, resettlement of those people that will suffer extreme danger.
I say we  eat the  weakest and poorest(healty) humana.
That's why my foreign friends try to decrease the amount of beaf consumption  As an indian i also avoid eating meat as much i can I eat chicken only once in 1-2  month  So please let's make earth a better place 🙏🏼
What about eat more shrooms and bugs? I know everybody won't do it, but, can it be a better solution to climate change and deforestation?
Is meat really that bad? Spoiler: yes
I’d love to see you make a video about inequality between developed country and less developed country.
Thanks for the new video

I think another point people don't make that often is what will happen to the livestock if demand for meat falls to really low levels? Farmers won't keep cows around if their value is less than the cost of maintaining them so lots of domesticated farm animals will either be culled, not allowed to breed or potentially set free into the wild - something they have not been bred to cope with. These animals are so differentiated from their original ancestors that they only really live to serve humans and if they can't do that then I can see a large number of species becoming functionally extinct  Edit: I didn't say demand was going to fall in a day. Over a long period of time this will happen. Livestock will become less and less valuable to keep.
While i understand the whole problem and the fact that the climate change is rapidly increasing, i strongly disagree with us "regular people" changing our ways. 100 companies are responsible for 71% of emissions, even if the entire world goes vegan that's still a problem, and it doesn't seem eager to change
Wow, no other video can compare to a kurzgesagt video!
This video made me incredibly hungry.
wait so is it better if i eat more chicken than beef? beef isn't really my thing, but i love chicken  this isn't a threat, relax science birds
Everyone drop some good affordable beef alternative dishes below we can help each other out.
Thanks for the video! Beautifully put as always!
Beef would keep you alive longer than potatoes for multiple reasons other than protein. Beef is much more nutritionally dense and rich in various vitamins and minerals, especially iron and zinc. Using only protein as an indicator is terribly misleading.
Loved it. Finally the whole deal with meat
So I guess the anwser is to kill all cows.
I feel such a hypocrit knowing all of this and still consume meat almost everyday...
The only thing I miss about this discussion is a good middle ground. A year and age we will all still see, for a world that isn't completely engulfed in change. There are plenty of theories going around in which meat consumption is still part of society, but changed in a way it is very expensive, the animals have quite a great life and the quantity of meat production is within manageable tolerances. I still feel we live in a world where "you are either vegan, or you aren't ready to be vegan yet" - type's of arguments. Because even vegetarians know their dieet is helping, but isn't solving the issues we have, and changes we need to make those changes.
“Potatoes have the least environmental damage”  *Irish anthem starts*
Mad respect for the beef stonks meme
I was positively surprised by this video, a lot of people act as if factory farming isnt the most efficient method of killing animals for food and end up saying that everything would be fine if the cows where grass-fed/free-range.
I have a question:  Facts from sources:  Tempcontrolled transport:   - sea 0,02 kg CO2 per tonne-km -rail 0,06 kg CO2 per tonne-km -road 0,2 to 0,66 per tonne-km  from sources in description:   – For example, shipping one kilogram of avocado from South America to Europe generates about 0.3 kilograms of CO2 equivalents in transport emissions and around 2.5 kilograms overall – while one kilogram of beef from your local butcher will come in at 18 kg in CO2 equivalents at least. So even when shipped at great distances, emissions from almost all plant-based foods cause lower emissions than locally produced animal products.   Most of the avocados coming to Europe are from Central and South America. The biggest exporters are Mexico, Peru, Dominican Republic and Colombia. We based the calculation here on a freight route from Peru to Belgium  which is around 12000km, and generates about 0.3kg CO2eq.  12000km * 0.023kg per tonne-kilometer / 1000 ~ 0.3 kg CO2eq per kg   I would agree with this if all stores and warehouses would be situated around ports but from experience I know this is not the case so we have to accept the fact that these products still require road or atleast rail transport on top of it. (Which is an increase of x10 to x33 and x3 respectively for every extra kilometer to the stores/warehouses/markets inbetween.) Where locally produced meat only has the higher emissionsrate for a shorter distance without the sea transport on top.   My point being: the argument that there is low emissions on transport of these goods doesn't really hold up.
great propaganda video.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times everyday"...  You guys are eating more than once a day????
Dislike button.    P.S: I actually liked the video. I'm a vegetarian from the birth and want to remain same throughout my life to save our culture. So, I want to see how well this video is received by people around the world (especially U.S).
Would be interested to see how the use of human byproduct for animal feed affect the data. I know a lot of farms around us get most of their feed from by products such as, from cereal manufacturers, crisp, sugar beet mills. Lots of our land in the Midlands England is being used for maze but for bio digesters for power
Meat is love
I don't mind beyond meat stuff, I just can't afford it. And then human instinct kicks in so that I would rather keep my self alive with my heating bill instead of eating the plant based foods.
+Is meat really that bad -No /Thread
Only kurzgesagt can make the most adorable cow animatable
By the way, I don’t think meat should not be eaten due to climate change but because slauthering animals is inhumane
Cattle can eat things other than grass that we can't eat though. You can grow crops like corn and feed the cows the stalks, eliminates waste and feeds the cattle. This same principle can be applied for other crops too. Making both meat and crops while preventing massive emissions.
9:45 bottom left. Is that a cell ?
I am shifting to vegan diet. For better tomorrow.
This is why i love this channel, it tries to be unbiased they talk about facts and often you end up leaving realizing that the issue is way more complex than you were led to believe.  Problems like this will require complex solutions, some of those solutions might be reduction and prevention but it seems we also need to come up with ways to deal with the realities we cannot prevent.
problem is that maybe your right yet this will be rules for thee and not for me the poors will have to eat the bugs and live in the pods while the rich won’t change. y’all have already helped Bill Gates whitewash his atrocities and I don’t trust him.
Really informative and well put together video!   This is how we make people implement more vegan alternatives into their diets. Present the facts in a respectful manner, and let them make the choice themselves. No conflict has ever been solved by screaming at each other. Let's focus on what we can do better, instead of what we do wrong.
When the discussion goes to cow farts it's getting ridiculous. Watch why 'your carbon footprint' is a lie from Climate Town.
So... Yes, meat is really that bad.
Your video fails to answer the title question, yes, yes, meat really is that bad, stop eating it.
I LOVE MEAT!!! IT MAKES ME FEEL SO GOOD!!!!!!! I LOVE MEAT EAT MORE MEAT
I'm not trying to attack anyone but I'm genuinely curious. If an alien race came to the Earth and took over, would you be okay if human beings were farmed for meat and dairy?
eating a nice steak today
There are plenty of carbon-negative technologies in the works, so the argument that our carbon budget will be exhausted in any time frame is assuming none of them pan out.  Which, I mean, is a reasonable default assumption to *start* from, but it's also a pretty pessimistic place to land when talking about making major life-altering decisions that impact the entire world.
I don't care if the World is on fire, i'm still eating meat.
"A vegan diet would free up around 3 billion hectares of land."
b e e f   s t o n k s
Without dislikes how I’m going to know how well the video was taken in by people
The impossible foods burgers should be invested into more, here after watching mark rober's video
we are at one of the lowest levels of co2 in billions on years.  Look at the 100 million year chart not the 800 thousand year charts.
Sorry, tried not consuming meat, I don't even last two weeks without it. I feel depressed and low mood when I'm fed just with plant based food
Me: Sure i don't mind eating less beef.   Walmart: beef $4 a pound impossible meat $7 a pound.  Me: im sorry mr.cow.   However good alternatives i found are lentils or turkey for taco meat, turkey based chili, eggplant lasagna is delicious with mushrooms no meat needed,  still trying to find an affordable alternative for burger patties. Turkey patties just aren't the same. And impossible meat has hiked its prices thanks to capitalism.
Ngl the incogmeato stuft doesnt even taste different from actual meat
I used this for the students and they're so engaged! Awesome materials for kids to learn new things!
With three videos about meat and one on dairy, would it be possible to just make a video on veganism outright? Or maybe dietary choices?
My problems with veganism are as follows;  1) Other vegans, when I've been doing 10 hours of physical labour and you come to tell me how much of a murderer I am while browsing meat selection for something quick and easy to eat... just f off. I don't want to be part of your pushy culture.  2) The taste on a lot of the vegan foods I've tried is bad or plain at best. If you have to use 3kg of spices to make something edible, what's the point?  3) How much do you actually have to eat to get the feeling of being full? And how long that lasts? How long to prepare a meal with enough calories?  4) you have to be very careful so you don't miss out on any important nutrients. B12 being one you can't get naturally from vegan diet.  5) Humans are not naturally vegan. You cannot survive on it unless you take supplements/fortified vegan foods
As far as I know, cows don't fart, just burp methane.  Is this not true?
I wonder how fish factors in
Quitting meat from latinamerican diet is almost impossible cause eating it is part of our culture, things not easy man
But, we can't be healthy if we don't eat meat. Some people says that we can restore wastelands recreating the old lifestock roaming path behavior that they was doing before we took them into farms.
I think no matter what, there is no reasonable way for human civilization to be carbon neutral or negative without having dedicated technologies running to counter our actions. Even if we become as clean and efficient as possible, if we want to have a good standard of living, there will be emissions. However, not only can nature handle some extra carbon, but if we had dedicated carbon capture tech running off of clean power, then we could all "have our steak and eat it too" with out having to worry about every single kilo of emissions.
*IF ANIMALS DIDN'T WANT TO BE EATEN WHY ARE THEY MADE OUT OF FOOD?*
"Food is the best thing in life... ...and never gets old"  tell that to the pizza slice i found under my desk. that thing got hella old. it already has grey hair
Meats awesome
Yeah, all those facts are cool and all, but realistically, you cannot stop people from eating meat. It's impossible
Vegans cheering violently without realizing that millions would starve without meat.
I've been (mostly) vegetarian for the last several years, and I've switched to fully plant-based this year and I'm never looking back.  It is so easy to find delicious and nutritious recipes online that the only effort needed is to do the shopping and cooking.  I understand not everyone has easy access to a market that offers a good assortment of vegetables, but for everyone else I'd recommend trying out vegan meals for a couple days, a week, or whatever you feel like.  You'll be helping the environment and reducing the demand for slaughter at the least, and if you chose good meals, you'll be helping your health as well!  Best wishes to everyone =)
Statement: sex >> food. Prove me wrong
Beef all the way...  becoming a vegan is like driving electric race car... it's better, faster but has no heart throbbed orchestra created by exhaust and engine noises...  so it's fine to eat vegan most of the time but summer weekends needs meat on The bbq...
I will send this to the vegan teacher lol
definitely not state sponsored malnutrition like in cuba where cows are PROPERTY of the state.
I mean, food is PART of the system. Carbon-emissions and FOSSIL-carbon-emissions are very different things, with very different consequences. One is adding more carbon into the system and driving climate-change, the other is releasing the carbon already inside of the system and driving climate-change.  It might seem like a "semantics" kind of thing. But the difference is basically that "cutting down a forest" (whilst problematic for a variety of different reasons), doesn't actually really cause any more carbon-emissions than simply allowing the forest to rot away on its own (it'll just be a more "rapid impact", which is admittedly not great in the middle of a crisis). So unless you're planning to BURY that forest several kilometers underground in order to properly remove the carbon from the system, simply having "more forest" isn't going to do anything more than temporarily delay those carbon-emissions from being released once again.  It's a bit like saying that "cows fart methane" without acknowledging that the food that the cows eat would produce that methane ANYWAY, even without the cow to facilitate things.  There's definitely an argument for changing how we farm various things. Mono-cultures are for example notoriously bad for wildlife, and fertilizer can easily contaminate water-supplies. But this idea that some foods will inherently produce the kind of carbon-emissions that would drive climate-change forward (rather than the methods of "harvesting/transporting" those foods being the actual villain) sounds very disingenuous.
This video has a pretty misleading title. You don't make any references to climate in it. With the way the title is phrased, I expected an equal amount of video time to be dedicated to ethics of factory farming, and nutritional hazards/benefits of eating meat. The perspective in this video was much more narrow.
So basically this video tells us that the birds in this universe are cannibal as we see a turkey
Good job for making this video! A lot of hate out there for scientifically backed evidence against meat. Shame you didn't touch on the ethics a little more, however.
Don't the plant products also incur the local distribution cost? That suggests electric or fuel-cell trucks are important to reducing the emissions of last-mile delivery
What about the most recent report by IPCC which states the emissions by beef is overblown by a factor of 4.  Also, methane is very different from co2 and stays 30 to 100 times shorter in duration in the atmosphere. Why no one talks about that?  And global cattle population has been the same for years. It doesn't grow. So the emissions are very stable. While other factors on emissions are growing significantly every year.  Lot of misinformation on this topic. Also, meat is significantly better for health which is also something we don't hear from the media. Meat made us evolve into what we are now as a species. Veganism is never sustainable or healthy.
can't we capture that fart and covert it into something usefull?
9:35 am I missing something or comparing a 100 years worth of CO2 absorbtion to 1 year emission is a bit flawed there? Yeah in 100 years the plants' gonna absorb 800 billion tonnes of CO2 but a single year of it is still 8 billion compared to the 50 emitted. That will conclude only with the fact that we have to strictly change our whole lifestyle from the food consumption to car usage, especially for the US because the point made at 4:36 is for places where you strictly have to use cars, while here in Europe you could just bike to the butcher and be perfectly fine!
PLEASE CREATE THE NEXT VIDEO ON SPACE TOPIC, ITS BEEN 3 MONTHS
If someone makes lab-grown meat that can replicated current meats, I don't care if it's lab-grown I just want my meat :P
I just want to say that there is no point in convincing anyone who doesn't want to be convinced. People here are saying that its a heated debate whether or not eating meat is alright. If you ignore religion and culture its undeniable that eating animals is bad for the environment and quite frankly unethical with the way we are treating them. Anyone who says otherwise without sharing where they got there information from is an apologetic. If you're sensible you will ignore their comment since its equivalent to talking to a concrete wall. If you could get nothing from this video at least understand that their are better alternatives to beef and if a vegan diet cannot be maintained in your area, reduce your consumption of meats. It requires courage to accept the facts, but it takes a mind with strong resolve to do something about it. Something new that I learned is that cruelty free meats actually cause more damage to the environment then cruel methods. Quite depressing actually
Mmm beef stonks
Grass fed grass finished beef everyday and pastured free range eggs. Raw milk from my local farm and raw cheese. A ton of organic fruit. Carrot juice and celery juice. Organic 100% cocoa and raw honey.
It doesn't matter how many times you guys repeat that meat consumption is bad for the climate. Someone like myself who's been deprived of meat due to inequality will tell all of you to shove your opinion in that spot. Remember that while you guys worry about YOUR environment and your people, there are millions who don't eat meat because of the price. As always, most people only care about their own ass.
I don't know how is it with soybeans but im a farmer and the wheat that goes to feed livestock can not be used for humans there are a few factors why. So i don't think that that chart was used in a correct way.
“If we eliminate all other sources food will use all our carbon budget by 2100”. Wait so how long do we currently have, 3 days?
Eat the bugs. Live in the pod. Face the wall. _You will own nothing and you will be happy,_ *BIGOT!*
Finally this video gives the information in an easy to understand and from a neutral point. Now I know what to do to reduce my carbon footprint. Thank you!
It must be said: The way that Kurzgesagt draws cows is cute as hell.
"Is meat really that bad? Yes." - Kurzgesagt 2021
26% of total emissions for all food not just meat? That's no where near as bad as people make it seem. Since food is unavoidable does that mean it's better to focus on renewable and low emission energy production? I know that is a big transition that will take time but it sounds worth it if we start now
Sounds like, damned if you do damned if you don't.
Thank God India has that holy cow thing going on, imagine a billion and a half people also eating beef ,lol we would have climatic apocalypse by 2050.        I wish China had holy bat situation though hehehe
Left out is that much of what is fed to cattle is, in fact, crop byproducts.
I feel like using a life cycle analysis for animal products raises some weirdly existential issues, particularly if you're talking about the cost of raising an animal to maturity for food. By that logic, a genocide of cows would be one of the best things for the environment. And a genocide of humans even more so. Is that something you're ethically ok with? Because the cow doesn't cease to exist just because you've stopped eating it. And it will still try to live, consume and have offspring unless it dies. Then the counter argument becomes, if animals co-exist with humans anyway, why not make them part of our food systems. Like I said, LCAs have a nasty habit of simplifying some extremely complex issues particularly when they have to deal with living things.
the only thing that this video fail is to mention synthetic meat that is mmeaby in test but its kinda groing up idk i just see a notice about it 2 years ago idk about that today if is still a thing
Let's kill all the cows, easy
There’s zero dislikes so everyone must have no objective to anything in this video…
What an excellent episode and one that brings some very interesting answers and possible new questions. Thank you very much, it was very informative to watch.
I’m just jamming to the narrator telling me that beef production ain’t the best
Plants + Animals (including humans) = zero CO2 emission. None of these two should grow in number.
I wish people would mention hunting as a substitute when discussing these subjects.
What about cell based meat?
Veggie patties come with vegetable fats which are known (by now at least) to be the most unhealthy source of fat there is though. Beef is good for you, bad for the environment I guess.
I'm wondering now what the comparison between producing a veggie patty and producing a beef patty looks like. Growing the plants does less co2, but what about taking the plants and forming them into a meat-imitation product? Would that add up to more than the best beef or not?
I actually never ate beef though but i eat poultry.  I love kurzgesagt . DON'T let vegan teacher see this.
I WILL NOT DRINK THE SOY I WILL NOT EAT THE BUGS I HATE THE ANTICHRIST
The way he said “controversy” did me a discomfort
The fact that it's a practice predicated on the massive scale suffering and death of sentient beings is enough to argue against it, even if climate wasn't part of the issue.
Please someone invent that burguer meat printer already!
I think the only real solution that stands any chance of success is lab grown meat.
3:47 maybe people are getting this wrong. You don't buy local meat bc of emissions. You buy  local bc you want support animal protection.
I like how there are many videos about meat in this channel and I too am a pure - vegetarian can't call myself vegan since I eat honey
I’d be interested to see a world where we simply subsidized beef with other meats such as chicken in our diets, essentially cut down the biggest emitter but replace it still with meat rather than just vegetables
Finally, a video that justifies my lifetime of vegetarianism. Respect to the makers for making it so simple to understand👌🏽👍🏽👍🏽 Love from India.🇮🇳
I was hoping to see a comparison to cultured meat :(
I’ve been vegan since 2016 after educating myself on the topic of animal exploitation and the effect industries that exploit animals have. I read this analysis referenced in the video in 2018 when it was published and have read and watched so much information.   It’s clear that animal exploitation is a status quo which causes severely more harm than good, suffering to animals, workers and environmental destruction. There’s no moral justification for needlessly killing animals especially at the expense of all being. Go vegan is proven cheaper in studies published by again, Oxford. Foods like potato’s, beans, oats, berries, texture soy protein, lentils, tomatoes, apples, bananas, nuts, seeds, pasta, rice etc  Even in the U.K. stores like tesco are matching and or undercutting the more processed or “meat” products with their plant based alternatives, nuggets, burgers, mince etc for those who want to still experience those kind of foods.  Climate change means diet change, meat belongs in the past for those who do not require it for their own survival. Go vegan, respect all beings and the planet.   🌎🐝🦉🦞🐄🐓🐖🐃🐫🐑🦗🦂🌍
They want you to eat bugs and soy. Saved you 12 minutes.
Very misleading information at times honestly.   For example, when saying that 48% of our crops go directly to humans as food, and 41% to animals, you completely ignore the fact that a massive part of our crops cant even be digested by humans.  Usually we eat a very small part of the crops we grow, the seeds or the fruit of it. The husks or stems from the crops are inedible to us, but NOT to farm animals.   Not giving that part of our crops to animals would mean throwing it away currently. But this is completely overlooked here, framing it as if we give loads of "human food" to cattle.
I think kurzgesagt could mention insects making part of our diet for the future, since it would be a new diet revolution for the world and how we see our food, combine with efficient crops, like beans and potatos and we could have some interesting discussion about the topic
We eat meat to get proteins... But where do those animals get proteins?.. from the greens they consume... So we should just remove the meat from the cycle and directly consume the green... Easy peasy... And if you think that veg food are not tasty... You just don't know to cook.
The chicken ate it's brother
with every food chain layer, energy output decreases by around a factor of 10. So 1000J of animal feed is needed to produce 100J of beef. There is no valid argument for sustainable meat because it would always be more efficient to give the energy the livestock is consuming straight to humans.
Very interesting video, it really helps putting things in perspective! I didn't know that transportation has so little impact on the overall CO2 emissions.
"You can decide by yourself what you want to do with this information" Unfortunately we live in a planet full of egocentric maniacs who won't care about the burning rainforests of Brazil as long as they have some meat to grill.
billions of animals needlesly slaughtered each year: isn't it tho? 👁👄👁
Feeding billions of people isn’t possible without meat
It is important to remember that meat is an important part of any diet, you need to eat some sort of meat to survive. One of the B vitamins only can be found in meat (can't remember if it us 12 or 6). With out it you will die. Now it is true you can take supplements but they are also meat based. Be smart with your choices but don't think you can cut it out completely as some vegans have found out, you will get sick, your thinking will become impared...
I really don't think people get how we're probably all going to be eating synthetic meat in 100 years.
Ok, so beef equals burgers?  We should start with wasting less, the amount of food we just burn up is humongous! But we don't want that, we want our food to come with different labels and different imaginary ideals they entice. The result is, we have not progressed at all.
Im ready for Synth-Beef
The simple answer is that the human population is getting too big for the planet to sustain. No matter what we do, we're still gonna cause pollution. Either we stop eating meat daily and only eat it on important days as a luxury food or we're gonna need thanos.
Eye candt
shitty neoliberal propaganda  imagine thinking that cows farting is a problem other than big corporations
I was hoping you guys would talk about lab grown meat and how it might affect the world.
Great 👏
Those who advocate to not consume meat probs aint see the rest of the world yet.Just a flex
I feel like eating a meat hamburger. .... no, better.... A juicy steak! ......... even better...... wiener sausages! (that's will eat now)
Not the best video to watch while eating a big mac
Vegan food is actually very good. The problem is most people are very uneducated and think they have to eat meat to live. I've even heard people go as far as saying they feel sick if they eat fruit and vegetables. Humans are very selfish and only care about their wants and don't care about the needs of the planet overall. A lot of people are also insecure and feel eating meat makes them tough or strong.
You're oversimplifying things. In cold places like Scandinavia you absolutely must rely on meat and cheese products because your body consumes much more to stay warm. Furthermore animals are the only things you can farm, on account of being too cold to grow things for half a year. Even so, the system here is thought out that every little bit of value is extracted. From cheesy products, to locally produced meats, to extracting biofuel from their dung and finally using it as fertilizer for the few months things can grow. Why are these not the standards throughout the US and the rest of the world?  In fact, how about we just put a leash on the worst offenders of the industry first, private companies, before talking about restricting our diets and energy demands? Cut the outsourcing jobs to Asia and punish companies like Coca Cola for being the terrible companies that they are. It might make certain things a luxury but at least we don't sacrifice things essential for human life.  "HUR HUR WHAT YOU DO WITH THIS INFORMATION IS UP TO YOU". Stepping in the virtue signaling passive aggressive territory I see? Bad video.
Just eat both...
I'm fine with less meat, though I'd never want to give it up completely and become one of those obnoxious vegans whom have to announce every minute that they are vegan. :> At the same time I'd be fine if we produced less humans as well... yes eventually populations would plateau, just takes too long and the global number would still be quite high. But its never a popular view to limit people on procreating.
More misunderstandings of methane dynamics using outdated CO2 equivalence methodology. Simply put, if the global number of cattle doesn't change, the climate influence is zero. They do not contribute to climate CHANGE. Unlike fossil fuels, whose emission is additive and cumulative in its impact. Scapegoating at usual. Most people would be better served, by simply throwing away less food, but then people would REALLY have to change how they eat.
Great video :)
Dislike
Every time Kurzgesagt uploads a video I always think to myself that I'm gonna have to sadly wait another 3 weeks (most of the time) for the next video
I think I will try and avoid eating beef on a casual basis now and only eat it on special occasions.
I have been vegetarian my whole life :) My parents thought it was healthier and it really was! They saved the world from 10+ tons of CO2 without even knowing it
Excellent explanation. 🗺️😉 To move to a plant-based diet it is as hard as we make it.
Switched from talking about beef to feed for all animals. Cows are ruminants so can digest the parts of corn and soy we don't eat.
The major problem with Vegan diets is the white supremacy and indigenous exploitation.  Not to mention the harm to bat populations that live off Agave.  Please make a video exploring the up and down sides of Vegan culture and diets.
Conclussion: eat what you want, we're f***ed anyway
Love that they don't pick a side they just explain it so it's easy to understand!
I say lets go Vegan 😁
I know what I will do with this information, I WILL YEET IT OUT OF THE WINDOWS, WHILE EATING SOME MCDONALD       (it's a joke, don't get mad, im just a dude online who wrote a stupid YouTube comment, everyone has different thoughts and ideas)
Bruuuuuh . The last thing we need is to have ppl more inclined to consume and in fact overconsume meat and overescelate the surrent ecological disaster Edit: after seeing this i have to say it was some Drip content as usual . Although you didnt mentioned one crusial thig AT ALL! The method of meat plants is highly threatening since they use way more than human cobsumption of anti biotics in it . Meaning it hyper super doper escelates the super bacteria issue and result in mass extinction of most species .
Post-viewing comment: Yeah nothing changed I'm just pro-meat and anti-animal abuse. Idc about everyone having as much beef or anything if it meant ending sustained animal abuse. But then I can also go into the woods and harvest a wild-raised elk that'll feed a family for half a year or more, so I don't think I'll ever be worried about running out of meat.
Just stop producing food and make the world survival of the fittest
Legit video. If you care about minimizing global warming emissions aim for plant based foods.
Veganism is pro climate change: they only eat the very things that consume CO2 and provide the oxygen we need to survive.
Will there be a video on Beyond Meat or Impossible Meat as a alternative to meat?
Have been veggie for over 9 years now when people ask me and they doooo more then I put it under their nose! I use this info in the video as one of my 5 reasons for why I am not eating meat. I never missed meat. There are so many good alternatives and they are getting better literally every 2-3 month. I know they are not really healthy either but well. @Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell at 8:50 would have been cool to see how many people you could feed with the same amount of cereal/soy that you use to produce the same amount of meat.
STEAK TIME  MM YUMMY
I think you missed one of the most obvious arguments against meat, and that is the one with ecological pyramids. Let’s say you grow 10 kg of crops, you can either feed that to an animal and get 1 kg of meat or you can eat the 10 kg of crops yourself. From an energy efficiency perspective eating the crops is a whole lot better. If you’re wondering why you only get 1 kg of meat even though you gave the animal 10 kg of food? It is that way because when the animal is alive it releases heat (energy), so when your animal has eaten all of the food and grown into something you can eat, it has released 90% of the energy you gave it —> 1 kg of meat.
IMO: consuming animal products is unhealthy, not environmentally sound, cruel, and unnecessary.
6:24 an open wound the current government pretends not to see.
Afforestation of Sahara  Please make a video on it
Doesn't matter if it's bad or not, I'm still going to eat more meat just for the sake of making vegans feel more offended
i can notice that this video, this time, is... way more neutral or negligent, i guess...? like, in 10:09 "you can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information" that's... interesting. like they're refraining from saying a certain thing  or maybe i'm overthinking
As a Brazilian I have to ask you all, stop buying our beef, and give us the the opportunity to have a non agricultural industry, we aredy have clean energy and the climate and spacial environment to produce clean products, as we speak our forest are burning and your jobs disappearing
Of course meat isn't "really that bad". Humans, and their ancestors, have been eating it for millions of years.
Look up your national numbers. The US is far lower carbon footprint for beef than other countries.
industry is to blame but some genius capitalist pig came up with idea to make people blame each other instead of them
I only eat meat, as I'm on the keto diet. 😋 I only eat every other day though, as I fast 47 hrs and eat in a 1hr window. And I'm continuing to do so for however long I see fit.
Very incomplete picture painted here.  Among the omitted points are:  1: It's takes an average of 660 gallons of water to produce 1 beefburger patty, with all the attendant energy use to process that water for consumption. 2: Animal (not just cow) waste is often dumped or leeches into the sea and rivers, destroying ecosystems, especially microbiological, i.e. coral reefs. 3: Much of this arable 'non-viable" land could be used to grow hemp or other hardy, multiuse crops, which grow under very harsh conditions, and require little cultivation. 4: Most of the world's grains are actually grown in order to feed livestock animals. Meaning that much of the carbon footprint caused by crops is actually caused by livestock rearing.  These are to name a few off the top of my head - there are more omittances. Don't believe me, check these facts yourself. If you want a compelling watch, check out a documentary film called Cowspiracy. It's not the most up-to-date report, but it highlights many effects on the environment, which are left out here, to further your inquiry.  Main thing to take away: meat production is very bad for the planet. A move towards more ecological farming encourages and incentivises animal cruelty. If you think it's bad based on this video alone, it's much worse than you think.
I am a vegetarian, but the thing is it's just a food chain, vegans, vegetarians and non vegetarians all play their role equally in the nature. And by the speed we are building concrete jungles on top of the farmlands and how farmers are treated by the nature and the government, we are in deep trouble foodwise in the future.
Ok ok that’s the argument when assuming carbon dioxide and methane are bad for the environment... but are they really? Some studies point out that with increased carbon levels, plants would have more “food” for themselves.
"You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information." This is the reason we'll never solve the climate issue.
I Love eating meat, almost exclusively at times...knowing that my choices are helping to create a positive affect on the environment is a bit of extra soul food.
Ethics, Water Consumption, Health Issues, Future Pandemics were not mentioned at all in the video.
Try a vegan burger, more specifically a beyond burger. You'll get hooked trust me
Getting a meat ad just before the video
I R Carnivore. Cooked Low and Slow. Over a wood fired smoker.   How many environmentalists get triggered by this? Bet most of them would not turn down a free BBQ dinner.
On the topic of cows, they are social animals, which means that each cow percieves the world through a complex set of emotions (like us) and needs stimulation like  being outside with other cows. Think of all the trauma a cow is experiencing... it's all just so heart-breaking and indescribable
the meme game
Why are you comparing the carbon removed over 100 years with the carbon produced in 1 year?  That comparison seems to inflate the impact to me.
Can't believe this video has to be made, and no I'm not vegan or vegetarian.
The worst thing about what happens in the rainforests is that they don’t even chop down the trees to sell the wood, they just burn the whole thing which wastes all of the resources of wood they would have gotten and emits a lot of CO2
Cringy vegan comments incoming in 3...2...1
It's more the cruelty rather than the carbon for me.
Dislike?
Viruses come from animal agriculture, so maybe instead of mandating masks you can mandate not eating meat in order to prevent all future disease and block anyone into a supermarket who isn't vegan.
I've been waiting for this video for a long time
9:31 how are you comparing different units? Co2 per 100 years and per year!???  The right comparison would say that we can take our 8billion tons while producing 50!
Being vegan makes so much more sense. It's much more efficient to just eat plants instead of feeding and growing animals for months/years just to eat them and enjoy for a couple of minutes.  It's unnecessary and we can thrive on a vegan diet, so why go through all the effort, inefficient, immoral and polluting nonsense of growing animals just to enjoy the taste on our mouths for 5 minutes?   We need to wake up!!!!
So, how much carbon did all the plants capture before the cows ate them? If they were left to rot how much methane would that produce?  The 'crops' used to feed cattle are often waste product. I haven't seen too many bails of hay in the fresh produce isle.  Eating local eliminates the carbon footprint of the trucks that cross countries and even continents. We don't all live in container ports.  Rainforests should be protected. Make them cost effective.
Love the video!! Go vegan y'all!!
I am amazed that beef is the most CO2 causing thing in food. India has banned the beef, so it would be ranked low on the emissions, right? can you please make a comparison of CO2 emissions from food based on countries please.
Buying locally subverts systems of control--very much worth it
This is mostly, pardon the pun, bull shit. Ruminate animals are 1) an incredibly important organism for keeping soil resilience and that’s why then even exist and 2) are the most bioavailable foods for human consumption. This is mostly a neoliberal analysis of a neoliberal problem: the global supply chain. Eating local beef and supporting regenerative agriculture and permaculture is GOOD for the environment, not bad.   Anyways, meanwhile in Germany…
Food is arguably the best thing about being alive  Sex : WHAT ?
I hope lab grown meat becomes mainstream. It has the potential to reduce the emissions that meat is correlated with immensely.
GO VEGAN.
Vegans aren't going to like this and im here for it.
when it comes to food, it is very hard to overcome emotions, our body is way too smart to figure out a veggie patty is not the same as beef, so really for majority of the meat eater, changing diet has to be a exterior decision not based on loving for food alone, like being with someone vegan, health and environmental conscious and so on
No birds were harmed during the making of this video
Not watching this video, but I'm assuming it has something to do with trying to convince me to go vegan under the banner of global climate panic/alarmism.  Still eating meat. Not sorry.
This video is beautifully made, and gives a lot to think about. It is not a black and white discussion,  but I do not agree on everything though:  What about co2 storage by cattle and poultry when done right? (Checkout holistic grazing, Savory institute). And what about damage to the soil and soil life by the "dig" approach by plowing for tofu, potato's, corn, grains and more? This a very broad discussion and topic and very interesting! I personally do not believe that vegetarian is the best idea. No judgement here if you do believe that .  Manure kickstarts soil life and makes it more resilient. Better for plants, humans and animals. But is it a bit of a quality/quantity and awareness thing?  I do not have all answers, but happy to see a different view.
Very informative,  Anyway
Vegan propaganda
Great video. I only wonder, doesn't the carbon from methane farts come from the grass the cows eat i.e., carbon that was already present in the carbon cycle?
Why not mention the warming and cooling cycles of earth..? Why not mention we, and animals, are only a small fraction of the actual causes for planet warming..? Because it doesn't serve someone's agenda... How naive most people are.. 👀
I feel like Kurzgesagt has really fallen off
growing animals in the factory is in fact more carbon intensive since they are more likely to catch dieseases. Then we need area for factories to produce vaccines which could be used for other purposes. For shipping you also have to see other pollutants like SO2 and NO2 since they can combine with water to form sulphuric and nitric acids respectively which can kill phytoplankton.
Beef stonks
Oof so many cry babies in the comments trying to cling on to any possible hope for continuing their flesh addiction. Plant based diets are better in every way, change by your own choice now, or be forced to change in the future. The outcome is the same, byebye animal holocaust.
9:46 Who wants T-Cell!!
@vegan teacher
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive”  As a rock, I can't relate.
The crops going to animals are often by products of getting the parts humans eat. Cows especially eat a lot of crops that would other wise be thrown away and turn it into food. If you got rid of meat all this would go to waste and would result in the need for the increase of farm land. Not to mention the emissions made by cows are already part of the natural carbon cycle unlike fossil fuels which are putting carbon that has been locked away for millions of years back into the system. I feel like the crusade against meat distracts from the real villain in our climate crises the fossil fuel industry.
not worth 4 weeks of waiting, a little dissapointed , but good knowledge
Two years ago i learned that i should thank vegans.  +1 vegan= more meat for me and the meat lovers.  Dude like, ez pc. Come on, we all meat eaters benefit from them, more meat for us i guess... :D
I guess it shows a clear priority to follow at least for a time, until developing technologies allow us to change impact or make production of some foods more efficient. We should eat little beef and lamb, mostly rely on plant diet, suppliment it with dairy, fish and to an extent meat, most of which should be poultry. A varied diet is best anyway, so it's even healthier for most people to not just eat the same stuff all the time. I'm a primary dairy and meat eater due to health, but I try to make things varied every now and then. It's not hard to do it in a tasty way.
Like many of the comments I would be interested in methods of making animal production more sustainable while being humane.  I've heard of methods of cattle farming which can produce a net 0 carbon emissions before.
"You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information."  Okay, I have decided to not eat 4000 calories a day like the average westerner. Climate change solved.
Fun Fact: The gorilla, ape, or whatever it is that shows up in the intro of kurzgesagt are eating different things every videos
so how big a imprint do lab grown beef have?
« Food is arguably the best thing about being alive »  Wait about sex, wait about sex....
Lentil soup is a vegan dish which is tasty, easy to make and forgiving to experiment with.
What I would do with this information is simply wait. I am convinced meat is bad for the environment, but I see no perfect alternative. Maybe in 10 years, we will have something exactly like meat being mass produced, then I would choose that.
Best time to release this video now that the Dislike bar is removed xDDDD
Great info. Even if this was entirely false, though, we still wouldn't have any sound moral reason to defend what we do to living creatures because they taste good.
What about fish though?
Okay, but find me a veggie patty that doesn’t taste like crap
"Food is arguably the best thing of being alive".  Not if you have an undiagnosed eating disorder that causes you to get ill from eating carbs and 10 years of doctors failing to work out even the slightest thing about what it is has gotten you nowhere. I despise food, it's nothing but hassle, expense and torture for me.
What about lab grown meats are they any better for the environment and could they be used to produce beef instead of normal farming?
So you're basically saying that the easiest way to stop, and maybe even reverse climate change is for everyone on earth to become vegan? We're all screwed.
love it
Every year In Britain 10 people die Because of cows.
I watched this video after ordering a burger. Now I feel bad...
The music got me vibin at the wrong moments
One thing that literally everybody fails to mention is the emissions your own body produces after eating, and how that changes from diet to diet
"Food is arguably the best thing of being alive".  I literally watch Kurzgesagt while eating...and still am eating...(typing with left hand)
Best time to upload this video, as dislikes have been made invisible
I love me so flesh 🖤
And what about those meats that are grown on labs? I wonder what would be the outcome if this type of meat production was used on a relevant scale, like what would be the net outcome given the natural resources consumption during production and the bio products.
I don’t care. I’m having steak a couple times a month. There is just far to many people to sustain properly. And it’s expected we’re going to have billions and billions more people to sustain in a not distant future. Our existence is a problem.
3:10 You know what they say, *cracks open beer* birds will be birds
And now I am thinking of becoming a vegan or vegetarian 🤔.
0:32 that bird hitting the Kurzgesagt button is me whenever something I don't understand comes up. Don't know it? Maybe Kurzgesagt have a video on it..
It's kinda sad that delicious things are often harmful to us or environment.
Yeah, right... Eat the bugs, plebeian.
Interesting that pork and chicken are MUCH better in emissions. Wonder how better it would get if we switched all meat consumption to pork and chicken.
Yeah, but what about foodwaste and some people not eating certain parts of the animal?  I kinda think that the choosy mindset of people is a big problem and I can't understand why nobody talks about how not beind picky will help fixing this sh*t.
If the food industry, a sector essential for survival, accounts for 26% of emissions, I'd like to know what the share of other sectors are so I can draw educated conclusions based on the whole picture and not just one side of the story. How much do we actually emit from non-essential activities? You point out that even if we cut all other sources of emissions, there will still be so much emissions left. But conversely, even if we do cut out the entire food emissions 74% of the emissions will be left. I also want to know how much meat production contributes emissions-wise in respect to the gross produce as compared to per mass of each product. If meat is 100x worse than plants but we produce 100x more plants, the carbon footprints are equal. And my intuition is that by total mass we produce much more plants. Some genuine questions I'd like to know the answers to and I think I'll go do some research on my own too.
send this to the obsessive anti vegan people they'll definitely shut up! amazing video:)
A shame trying to stop it is just about impossible, with countries like India and China releasing the most toxic emissions, those countries aren't exsactly known for their eco training or safety in general, they produce at low cost with high amounts of accidents or overwork. Big businesses won't enforce better work enviroments due to losing money, they pick those countries due to their low cost.
I just love this Channel so much 🥰
In a nutshell: eat more chicken
I've recently went vegan, and it's surprising how many options there are. Even if you're fussy. I don't miss meat or dairy or eggs at all.
Former vegetarian here of a decade here
We don't have to lower our emissions. The 100 companies that make up 71% of the emissions should lower their emissions.
The thing about climate change is that it is happening but it’s being used to lower the quality of life for people in the western world. Eating bugs, living in pods, and taking shorter showers will not be something that the elite do.  When Obama joe biden and aoc start doing those things then I’ll consider it. I will continue eating meat.
I devour meat I want meat  I need meat For I a meat
i'm waiting for lab-grown meat then i'll just switch to that
Meat isn't that bad i dont know why everybody beats it😕
One of the videos where seeing dislike count could be interesting but youtube did their thing .. shame. The video is amazing as always, though!
I am a proud vegetarian 😎🔥🔥
"Even if we extinguished all other sources of emission today, the emissions from our food alone would still use up our carbon budget by 2100."   Me(an environmental activist): Guess I'll die (without food)
I am saying it all the time! Do not scream over petrol cars, the renovation of food industry is more game-changing.
But if you feed cows and other animals powdered bones and other parts humans do not eat, they will not eat way less of grain and soy.
4:18 It is interesting, when you hear people talk about those big Freight Ships that burn "crude oil" and are so very bad for the environment. Turns out... that is so very much better then carting everything with little trucks and cars around the area you live in. I think the first thing to do... is to not waste any meat by letting it spoil.
I died when I saw the beef stonks lmao
In a nutshell Go Vegan🌿💕
Even if you can't fully give up on meat, please, just try to REDUCE your meat consumption. It's really not necessary to eat meat every day, and everyone is tired of talking and hearing about the climate crisis.  Eating tons of meat should not be a norm, but an exception.
Can you do about "Abortion"?
My big question with it all is really: How much of the emissions contribute permanently to global warming, and how much of it is reversed with the next set of feed crops grown? Sure, we can make a one-time investment in forest lands but unless we sequester that carbon back, we're just delaying by ~15 years. Which is in itself commendable, but that's if *everyone* goes vegan. Meanwhile, if we transition to no-fossil-fuel meat production, then every bit of emissions from the animals could only come from one source: That which is absorbed by the plants they eat. Methane breaks down to CO2 and water, CO2 is used up by the plants that feed the animals - it's a closed cycle. So my question ends up being whether this would be a solution to the problem, or if not, why not?   Not that I'm arguing that that's realistically feasible now, necessarily, but it makes me curious.
But muh beef
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive”   as an Indonesian i can agree
Meat is like here for good time not long time.
I'll just still chicken, sorry kurzgesagt :)
I can choose to not have kids but I am not turning vegan.
Wonderful video but I wish to highlight "beef stonks"
Vegans saying that we must stop eating meat as they produce a lot of methane Humans: you forget us
Makes no sense at all
I turned vegan earlier this year mainly for the climate, glad the topic is receiving more mainstream attention
There's no climate crisis, and I will continue to eat meat every day and be healthy.
All their suffering just for our greed
Don't kill animals
I've got a short question! In the video it said that all carbon budget would be 'used up' by 2100. What would that mean for the world?
You will eat bugs and you will be happy
At first seen, i see cannabalisum(chicken on tha table)
Ban paper money first then all other problems will go away
Bruuh, so those plants teleport from the harbour to our kitchen? 😂
I would eat people before going vegan. Well I probably would start eating wild animals I can catch then transition to people once everyone trying to not starve eat all the birds, squirrels, and pets. A thing in China is cities are empty of birds because people just eat them because they had to during the communist famines.
Lemme put this to you in terms ThatVeganTeacher can understand.   Yes.                      For us, not exactly?
I love these kinds of educational videos. Keep up the great work!
I just want my tank beef already.  Grow me a steak please.
Yeah, I fuess the point of buying locally isn't effective for climate change, but it could be effective towards breaking rhe monopoly of the industries in capitalism..
The future is still meat, more precisely, lab grown meat The only carbon emissions from lab grown meat is the electricity used, which if swapped to renewables isn't a problem
I will still eat meat. treating a cow by how much she fart is racist :)
Paper money is the root reason for climate problems
How about carbon cycles. Every plant a animal eats is buitlt up from the carbon it gets out of the air. So unlike oil which comes from the ground and gets carbon from millions year old fossils and doesn't grow back fast. Atoms cant be destroyed. If a carbon atom goes from plant to cow to human to CO2 or from cow to methane to CO2. The plants that started the cycle should consume the same CO2 or at least a large part of it. I see the earth built up out of 3 carbon batteries. Fossil reserves, surface carbon(trees plants materials) and the atmosphere. Surface and atmosphere can exchange pretty quickly using combustion and photosynthesis. While fossil can only take from surface at a very slow rate. Right now we are taking all the fossil carbon and turning it into atmospheric carbon faster than it can grow back. The whole food chain is surface. So apart from burning large amounts of forest and using the surface for usage with less capacity it should balance itself out right? I dont know if im thinking way to simplistic but it seems logical this way and i never hear anybody else about it.
Virgin vegans vs Chad meat eater
Yes, there is more human meat on the earth than any other and that is VERY bad for the entire Earth.
No
I will eat more beef
Lab cultured meat is the solution i think? I am a indian vegetarian though.
I aint stopping on eating beef - its not like i can eat them often without gout stabbing at my toe joint
proud to be a vegetarian .
i see so thats why veggies burger taste bland, they dont have enough carbon emission
the way we raise the animals on massive scale on a small footprint, is very irresponsible.  no doubt there.  we can raise animals in a way that is not bad for the environment, we just don't do it, because we're f*ing greedy!  there is actually evidence that animal husbandry can be beneficial to an ecosystem, but there's no way to get rich at it.  i've got a CRAZY idea....let's cut our food wasting by 50%, so we don't need to grow so much food!  that might be a good start.  some people could eat a lot less, but that's another story.
I like the video, but in the last part you say if we switch to eat less beef or go full vegan we free up the space. How about our calorie demand still? Something has to replace the beef then we have to grow something more, hence use that space for some other crop/plant based food. And you mentioned that beef>plant will sustain you longer because has more protein and calories. So you actually need more plant based food to keep up the calories and protein. If we talk about greens it’s heck of a lot more.
The duck using a cow costume was really cute
So, just eat me if you want if not, don t. Ez, problem solved.
let me correct the image of 0:17, meat eaters or Omnivores, aren't angry trying to convince the other one of anything. They just wanna be let alone.  Its the Authoritarian vegan he one that complains. I never see videos about Omnivores, I just see videos popping out of vegans complaining about how the others choose to eat. In my opinion you'd look less biased if you changed that sort of things.
This is why I tell my non-veggie friends in conversations that the best first step they can take is to just cut out beef and have some pork/poultry if they want to have a lot of meat in their diet. The fact that over half of edible crops is fed to animals is just a dazzling statistic that shows just how massive the industry has become.
Dislike.
I can personally get behind choosing to eat less meat overall, but I refuse to cut it out completely. The human body is not so simple as to just throw a bunch of x-y-z  nutrients into it. We have enzymes and all kinds of unknown gut bacteria which all work together in a great web to make us work, and eating meat has been part of that equation for at least 100K years. Some people are lucky enough to have the right make up to make do without, but most, I dare say, will suffer without meat.
That demon cow animation was epic!
No, it's great
I'll stick with chicken
Would cloned meat be a viable alternative to this?
Great video as always. I think we've gotta realize that we're simply too many people for this planet. I'm not going to stop eating meat because honestly, I don't want to suffer when there is so much else we should be doing. That said, I think meat probably should be a lot more expensive to incentivize people from eating less of it. Instead of eating a lot of meat that is cheap and badly produced, we can take better care of the animals and the environment and charge more for it.  The biggest outliers is still large companies and global trade. People who buy the cheapest crap online and don't care about repairing things etc etc.  I am doing my part in recycling everything I can and I am trying to buy things responsible but it's very very hard. Just go in to any clothing store and 90% of the clothes will be made of plastic (polyester, acryl) as a very quick and visible example.
Imagine how the world would be like if Kurzgesagt explained math.
Noice!
Hehe stonks
Well vegans take ur pick its ethier we warm the planet or we factory farm.   Because i and every child i have will never give up beef.
Is this a reupload?
omg i should eliminate half of the population
Vegans are storming the comments lmao, bashing everyone who disagree with their ideology
i refuse to eat any "plant based" options,
We must make it illegal for Guys to have epic bacon and  Minecraft
Please add Turkish translation.
Short answer: YES
Tofu emits way more emissions. But of course because it's waste, the great majority of it's volume and weight, is sold to cow farmers as forage despite it's extremely low nutriment value (a cow will be full on soy waste alone and still starve to death), soy producers use it to artificially deflate the emission of their main products like tofu or soy oil. It is basically tax fraud but for carbon emissions.  Edit : You can literally see that in the video the amount of soy produced to feed the cow is taken by weight, not nutriment.
And they didn't even mention anything about the morality of it. This is only the environmental factor,  Which is only my second priority. The number one factor is how you could possibly live in line with your moral principles while you kill innocent animals every day just to stimulate your tongue.  Please go vegan people and open your eyes...
I wish the video talked more about fish
Mmmm. I'm gonna go get a steak for dinner tonight
Please try and make a video on the Banach–Tarski paradox. Its a very complicated yet fascinating theory.
Great Video , eating animals is harmful to planet and it is also cruel.
I think that the comparison of emission between transportation of local meat and far away through ships might be the stupidest thing I ever heard, perhaps I am missing something or the meat is produced just beside the port so they don't need to be transported to it???
Is the demand for beef is really that high, to worth talk about it this much? It's just seems very strange to me, cause where I live, beef (and even lamb) has become rather unpopular, cause they cost around 3-4 times more than chiken or pork. It's not affordable even to middle-class households.
I'm hungry now
Be vegan be healthy
Well, if we are to fix the carbon thing, it was said we have to go back to the hunter gathering soceity and a lot less people. I am not quite ready to give up and go back to that life, besides... I want both meat and vegetables in my diet thank you very much. One or the other doesn't work for me, so I will gladly take my potatoes with fish or beef with potatoes and a salad.
beef stonks lmao🤣
youtube: **new kuzegazgt video** me: *dababy less goo* 👆🏿😀 ☝🏿     it was the closest emoji i could find
i would rather do anything else than work on my classworks
Here’s an idea for a future vid; In a society that doesn’t need to consume animal products in order to live perfectly healthy lives, what is the moral justification for the unnecessary killing of animals that feel pain, suffer and ultimately do not want to die?
Only to remove like 10-15% of our emissions we had to stop eat beef! Bruh what about other 75%? Isn’t it bigger and reducing that will help us much more and impact our lives much less? Capitalism is blaming you a human for ass capitalism putting us in. My life won’t change with less car models or phones, will yours?
It was not so complicated. At the end, there was a very clear conclusion. Meat is BAD for the environment. People want to make it look “complicated” to justify their decisions and make themselves feel better but it’s clear what science says. And they didn’t talk about the health issues related to meat consumption and the morality of the topic.
I prefer real steack instead of veggie shits
This is NOT a free month, it's an introductory month. Disappointing to see this mis-labelled here on YouTube.
So, if methane is oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water vapor, doesnt it mean, that the new grass will just absorb the CO2 back again? It sounds like a natural cycle. But of course, we should eat less meat in general and be more careful about what we consume.
the US of A "but muh hamburger"
Welp, i guess i have to get used of veggie burger
There's one problem. I like beef
I appreciate that kurzgesagt says that it's a choice whether we use this information or not, instead of saying "no, you have to do this" like so many others do. there's a lot of people who have allergies to substitute meals like soy. I have cyliacs, so, I can't just fill myself up on bread and call it a day.  but at the same time, I do agree that we have all have a problem. I know there's technology available that can just pull the pollution out of the air and turn it into usable resources, but i also know it's very expensive. Another idea I was thinking of was to just directly install miniature simplified versions of the tech into the factories we use and nip our problem at the bud, but i don't know if compacting tech like that is possible with our current understanding of it.
"The more the animals suffer the better they are for the environment" so dark I can't see my hands
Nothing about marine life, food wastage? This video feels incomplete.
Love the rooms…. After thinking deeply about the matters….  I am going to fry Bacon 🥓 while I eat my salmon 🍣 then go get a big huugggeee steaks 🥩 😃
Nuclear power and indoor, vertical, hydrophobic farming. Let the farmland return to forest and grassland. Let the animals roam the forest and grassland. Hunt the animals.  Problem solved.
According to burgers advice eat less meant with a lot of Weggies😋
Just go vegan already, its better in almost every aspect..
I guess I'm going vegan..
Increase your meat consumption,  ignore the fear mongering
Sounds like keep making our meat and free up some land and use it to invest the 800 million ton reduction in co2 over the 100 years by sacrificing the vegans food source.
It's MeTHANE, not mEEEthane.
I like how we feed cows corn and beans, and other feed they never evolved eating when they should only be eating grass, and wheat products. Then, when they produce gas because of the foods they should not be eating, we label them as a source of greenhouse gasses.
7:21 chandler bing is here
Well if we switched over to eating only plants it wouldn't be a good thing it would be a bad thing it would cause even more problems. I'll tell you why one how do we make plants well we need fertilizer and pesticides to make it grow and so bogs in other things don't get to those plants. Okay how does that become a problem well when it rains or the water the plants where does all that stuff go into our sewer system which leads into the ocean. And then algae starts to grow on top of the surface of the ocean okay how is that a problem well coral reef needs need sunlight in order for it to grow which the algae on top of the surface will stop that from happening. And so it will kill all the coral reef which the fish that live in the coral reef don't have any homes and they get eaten by all the predators and those sharks and other predators don't have any more food in those will die out. So we should not switch over to eating plants also people think that the plants don't have feelings and emotions they do they just can't speak it doesn't mean it doesn't exist just because they don't speak or show it actually they do show it just in a microscopic way. Thanks for reading this I'm not the greatest typer so if it looks sloppy that's why you're awesome keep learning.
My local vegetarians have been real quiet after I showed  them this.
Now give me a moment, I have a lot to think about.
Sikh and hindu not eating beef ;)
Glad you make a video about it! It's a necessary issue to be talked upon. Let's see how many of your viewers are gonna make a genuine change in their lifestyle.
So if we all switch to a vegan diet, won't that mean that required farmlands expand exponentially? Would that not cause _more_ deforestation? I'm not trying to be a contrarian, I just want to understand.
What if you’re the one who owns the cows?
To recap: everyone eat substantially less or no animal products. This didn’t even touch on the human health cost. This industrial food system is certainly not sustainable, going along with it isn’t the righteous choice
Love the food but dont waste it
whatever i am not giving up meat
I'm still going to eat beef!
I kinda miss Kurzgesagt's physics/ astrophysics videos
⚠⚠⚠NOW IT'S YOUR TURN TO DECIDE. DO YOU WANT TO EAT DELICIOUS FOOD OR  A BEAUTIFUL BLUE PLANET WITH HAPPY HUMANS AND ANIMALS⚠⚠⚠⚠⚠
Too bad a vegan diet will kill you, that plant based Patty is loaded with tons of toxic ingredients. Seed oils will just give you a heart attack
This was my topic for my end of university project and the research on it isn’t good and it’s just buried in lots of long paragraphs that really don’t make much sense unless you dedicate weeks and months of reading it all. You guys have made this topic so visually easy to understand and have made more people think about this topic :)
This made buy a burger for lunch.  I will never stop eating beef
nah,do now about possible co2 emission of labgrown meat
Sucking all that Co2 from the air will significantly raise the O2. Oxygen is a greenhouse gas too.
of course it is, instead of feeding humans we give our food to animals which in turn give us 25 times less food than we gave to them
Good Video - Go Vegan
"BuT KuRzGeSaGt, YoU AlReAdY dId A WhOlE vIdEo oN MeAt!"
Instead of trying to lower our meat consumption we need to fix the bigger problem, wasting food.
Man, people just gotta split the difference and stop being so weird about chicken sandwiches. You can't tell me a Popeyes spicy chicken sandwich is worse than a McDonald's hamburger. Chicken and fish are pretty solid improvements even if you wanna keep eating meat
There are far more environmental implications to meat other CO2 emissions, such as water, land and supplement usage . It seems to me that no matter how you look at it, meat is just an inefficient way of obtaining the calories and nutrients we need
2:00 the pumpkin reminds me of farmville 2 for some reason
Were vegans... right?
vegan burgers are okay but nothing compares to a well cooked steak
We Hindus worship cows for this very reason all along.
270k views in only 1 hours wow
Vegans screaming right now
Before I watch, does the video say "climate change" ? 😂
Vegan sponsored video
Yeah. Very much so, only in that we make too much of it. We need a massive culling of the population.
My oppinion: Completely switch to Lab-Meat and then kill most cows. The problem of Meat is solved and it will never come up again!
When are we going to return to being concerned over human population growth in general?
D-did the title just change it was called is meat really bad for the climate
The poultry industry can, should, must, and will engineer an ethical, genetically lobotomized GMO chicken incapable of feeling pain or discomfort, to facilitate ethical, high density, low emission factory farming.
7:13 ah yes everything is a resource for me meme
yesnt
0:03 There is another (from tomorrow on)
WHY CANT THE THINGS I LOVE BE SIMPLE. I WANT MEAT BUT ITS SO BAD *SOB*
Climate change induced by humans is bullshit
Bolsonarooooo porrra!
Like it or not meat is part of the human diet. Without it you can't receive the proper amounts of nutrients you need to thrive. Our ancestors only developed brains the way they did because of the meat in their diet. All of our close ancestors also eat meat. Most Herbivores such as deer are know to eat meat on occasions as well. It's part of life.
Not having children is the best thing you can do for the environment.
How much carbon do we save by eliminating vegans and vegetarians? 🤔
It’s not and will never.
Why people don't consider fish as meat? I know "vegetarians" that eat fish
Did Anybody else notice the cow in the intro?
What about fish?
What the fuck is "torfu"?
What I've been trying to say for years: the (part of much more complicated) solution is simply reducing meat consumptuon enough to just keep the ones that are environmentally useful and ethical. Win-win-win. No "go vegan or we're all doomed since it's the only problem with the world" neither "I mean, it's just a steak a day, I don't even eat it every meal!". In media stat virtus, cut to your steak a month + weekly other-kind-of-meat/fish and much of the work is done while still being able to enjoy those delicacies.  (also why it's so difficult to explain that "the old good natural bio bullshit anything" has more impact on the planet and without GMOs we'll be pretty fucked?)
👏👏❤❤❤
Yeah but isn't real grass fed meat healthier than veggie stuff? that seems like a super important missed point. Human health is most important.
It really isn't complex at all, in comparison to all the cars and vehicles burning fossil fuels compared to PURELY the cow industry alone, the cow industry uses 15 TIMES THE AMOUNT every vehicle on EARTH use.   And that's only the cow industry, imagine all the industries together, now that's a fucked up problem we have.
One important thing omitted in the video: Animals don't get fed the part of wheat and cereals humans usually eat. They can use the stalk and leaves and everything we can't use out of them. So simply going by produced raw weight of material and comparing which goes to human and which goes to animals is not really an accurate way of seeing how much we "waste" on animals.
I love that everyone is suddenly an expert in the comments. This is based on research done by scientist who spend their life researching this. Of course they could have missed/left something out if their models but probably not something that's going to swing the results. I have a masters in ecology and I don't feel qualified to argue these points.   I'm not saying we can't discuss the contents of the video or any hard topics. I just feel that some people could be a bit more humble in their opinion-sharing.
Me: meat is delicious The vegan teacher: OH SH CUT THIS VIDEO CUT CUT CUT
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old.”  *Yoda voice* :  No, there is another.
My whole family has been vegetarian. No meat, no eggs, this is India where 30% of people are vegetarian
YOUYHOUUUUUUUU :))))
“No other bodily pleasure can be enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old.”  Hand: “Am I a joke to you?”
i eat a pound and a half of beef daily none of it is CAFO CO2 is not a greenhouse gas - watch TONY HELLER millions of bison from the 1800's are laughing
Haven't watched the vid yet but you guys are making quite a couple videos all seemingly on the same subject! Maybe this introduces an interesting new noteworthy question or concern, or perhaps the channel is turning more into a business, with maximising views top priority?
There are many ways to improve the environment. Talking about overall health and nutrition, i will stick to omnivore diet. My red meat intake is very low, but high in chicken fish and eggs.
One factor I've never seen addressed in the meat vs. plant impact on global CO2 emissions: In the US, a lot of beef is raised on land that used to be roamed by bison. Not arguing that two wrongs make a right, but we killed off most of the bison and so the methane they used to emit is gone, replaced to some degree or another by beef cattle. I realize, that doesn't impact all of the carbon associated with the meat biz, and I'm certainly open to arguments that it's an insignificant factor, but I would at least like to see it addressed once.
Just had a beef sausage. Fucking delicious.
Fuck the world. Meat
While I won’t be giving up on eating meat, I should be eating less of it. That way, I’ll at least be doing my part in reducing my carbon footprint 👣
...
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change.  They found that under the most extreme scenario, where no animal products are consumed at all, adequate food production in 2050 could be achieved on less land than is currently used, allowing considerable forest regeneration, and reducing land-based greenhouse gas emissions to one third of the reference “business-as-usual” case for 2050.   Even if you want to deny the evidence, this can be proven with simple math and logic:  In which scenario will we need more land, water, food, and overall resources? 1)	Feeding, housing, and watering 70 billion animals and 8 billion people. 2)	Feeding, housing, and watering 8 billion people.  And don’t forget, all those animals create A LOT of urine and feces. And they make a lot more of it than us. It all has to go somewhere and multi-billion dollar companies may or may not be too picky about where it goes. All that urine and feces also creates a lot of gas.
OK guys if you see vegan teacher completely ignore because giving her attention puts higher on the list. Got it? 🙃
I help with this cause I get rid of meat by eating it :) therefore we should all eat tasty meat
Why do we care about the environment? To have pleasant surroundings for ourselves while killing other inhabitants of this planet? Why are we at war with every other sentient lifeform on the planet?
Me here never eated beef😑
And despite all this, nobody will do anything because nobody cares anymore.
Is it?
I dont care tbh in 60 years im dead so idc if in the future the earth is inhabbitable, id rather have nice life with daily meat consumption then "depress" myself so other who i dont know/care  about can life in the future .  Fuck that
Very interesting that it wasn't mentioned that we could switch the type of food we feed animals. There is a kind of seaweed diet that drastically decreases the methane they produce.
I will never stop eating meat, ever. Nor will I cut down the amount of meat I eat.
Funded by Bill Gates and Big Soy.
I'm fine with an energy revolution, and a transportation revolution but I don't want to see meat priced out or banned from consumption.  Yes, the Forrest Burning is bad so should be easier to trade for meat. But I like having the option to enjoy some meat in the meals I choose to eat.
What about insects, fish, and rabbits? How do they compare?
Meat is super nutricious. Leftism is a disease.
I love Kurzgesagt and highly appreciate what you do! As of right now my comment and thumbs up is the only way I can support your channel!
Honestly, as soon as were capable of building habitats in space the emmissions of meat will be a non issue considering a farm located on the moon will be able to jettison those emmissions into space. I also believe at some point someone is going invent a machine that draws methane and converts it into either something less destructive or actually helpful.
when you compared the best meat to the worst plant is the 9kg beef the best? why did you no use the best "chicken"(I believe it is the more efficient could be wrong)  I think that would make more sense since we are comparing to all plants
Kurzgesagt: "No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old"  Teenage boys: "Are you sure about that?"
So maybe, just maybe Earth can’t support infinite amount of people. If we manned up a bit and controlled birth rates for a few decades we would barely need any adjustments. If we never admit this problem, by the time we’re 12 billion our diet will have to consist mostly of shoelaces and tree bark.
What is with youtube not showing the dislikes? Cowards.
This video is the closest I've ever come to wanting to be vegan but chick fil aaaaaaaa
Thank you ! Amazing ! That's exactly the type of video I wanted to see :) ! I don't know if my former comments influcend you but i am glad this video is here :) !
Love the channel but I think you guys are misinformed in a lot of points on this . You should watch the What I Have Learned channel's take on this subject for a better understandment.
Meat is actually a major cause for there being so much hunger in the world. 80 percent of all agricultural land is devoted to growing feed for farm animals. Most of those calories are lost when they are transferred into meat, eggs and dairy. Thus, if the world's population ate half as much meat as we do now, we would in an instant be able to feed the 800 million people who go to bed hungry every night.
to be safe, let's be flexible on the types of food we enjoy eating. Considering how nice it must be to be eco friendly, I would *try* eating less beef
Let's postulate this.   Plants, especially crops, need fertile soil. (Otherwise they don't grow, obviously.)  Now a lot of fertiliser is made from animal bones, blood & manure. The nutrients from these then go back in the soil, making it fertile.   If (hypothetically) everyone stopped eating meat, and farm animals were no longer a thing, how long before the fields used to grow food crops become totally devoid of fertility? Considering that EVERY person on the planet now eats a 100% plant-based diet. Would that then result in deforestation simply to have access to fertile soil?   Would that deforestation then lead to less carbon absorption, and leaving areas unsuitable for farming for years?   So the question is, would ending meat consumption eventually lead us to the exact same situation?   Something to think about.
I've been waiting for so long.... it was worth the wait
In terms of beef's impact, I have two words for you: cultured meat. The tech is still growing, but if we keep developing it further, we could potentially grow meat at a lower cost than farm-grown, causing it to become cheaper than traditional meat. Hell, we've already seen it applied to Waygu beef and foie gras, and those lab-grown versions are apparently just as good as their traditionally-made equivalents, so it's not like cultured meat is a non-factor to be glossed over.  What's more, with the flexibility and compactness of growing meat in a lab, a smaller start-up could potentially price their varied products lower than farm-grown and still make a profit, meaning that traditional suppliers would potentially lose business unless traditional meat was subsidized enough for it to compete with cheaper lab-grown stuff.
Uh boy..."What I've learned" is gonna have field day with some of these umm informations.
Meat bad or not, cows will always be important because of milk.
happy for have mentioned Brazil 😯  sad for our deforestation 😭  Beign a colonized country it's tough, agriculture have a huge impact here since we don't develop our industries, always have seeing as "the land of the world" in terms of food, our president is dumb, and the people that have control of agriculture, they don't care for our people, just want to sell his good in dollar, since the coin it's getter higher and higher
"Guys let's stop eating meat to save the planet" will never work because things are much more complicated than that. Most won't know though
If we have less humans, especially in developing areas, will we have a noticable on emissions?
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive” -Kurzgasagt 2021
So, in a nutshell don't buy Brazilian beef
Please mention that organic plant based produse are impossible to make without animals.
Well no, but actually yes also darn it i eat beef a lot
I think because of the 17m sub poll, thing, I think it's hinting to a new ant episode
Well, people are made of meat, so yes.
Go vegan
DISLIKE
So this video is telling me that i should eat potatoes for the rest of my life
Right off the bat you are wrong. How about taking a dump? Daily bodily pleasure.   On the point of meat and climate you have to be a news watching brainwashed :sheep: to believe these concepts are within mans realm of power.  SMH.
most importantly it has a very negative effects on teh rights or freedoms of other animals
I love meat, and with this video i will eat chicken wings later and some beef before sleep
You are miss one thing most framers who raise cows and bull have to move them all the time cow can eat faster than grass grows way back then famers grow kudzu causes it grow so fast so yes cow do used alot of land but when u move them it equals out but other and that sound 100 percent correct to me alway wonder why we spent so much cut down Forrest when the south is been eaten been weeds and vines perfect for cattle
“You can decide for yourself what you want to do with that information”  As if you left me any choice?!
did kurzgesagt really use another meme
Also, remember that still are many people that don't have anything to eat and so much food that is wasted.
"Food is arguably the best thing of being alive".  Say you're a virgin, without saying you're a virgin...
I decide I'm only gonna eat meat where animals are trapped and can't move so I can lower climate change
"Pasture land alone can't support the ruminants living on it." This is patently untrue. Pastures can support a LOT of animals, it's just that leaving a lot of malnourished animals on an overgrazed, fenced in pasture and finishing them with corn in a feed lot produces far cheaper beef than herding those same animals over pastures using a rotating grazing system. Needing people to constantly look after and tend to the animals is far more expensive than just putting them on a small fenced in lot and basically forgetting about them until they are grown up.
There are two points I feel should be included: the role of bovine and other ruminating animals in the process of regenerative agriculture, and diet supplements to reduce emissions(seaweed in particular).
Yes we should use less animals products, but it's not realistic to go 100% vegan.
"no other bodily pleasure can be enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old" *are you sure though* (¬‿¬)
it’s also really bad for the animals you’re consuming, unnecessary cruelty
I do think there's some misleading things in this video. One of them is how the numbers about soy are reported. It starts off by having 2 sets of numbers. The one that is spoken tells about 19% soy being used by humans and 77% by animals (the rest is industry but this part isn't spoken). However at the same time you have the bird's speech bubble telling that the majority of beans is crushed into soy cake for animals and soy oil for processed food and biofuel. And the sneaky thing here is that the numbers here are percentages *by weight*. What this means is that even if you stopped using the soy cake part for animals, you would still need the same amount of actual soy plants to keep the same amount of soy oil required for food and fuel (and probably more for food since you need to replace meat). All you'd have changed is that we now have a bunch of soy cake that we need to find another purpose for.  The same thing goes for other types of feed, though this is highly dependant on the country. A lot of plants come with extra materials that we humans can't eat (or sometimes just won't eat just because it's deformed, humans are picky like that). One way to dispose of this is to feed them to animals. If we don't, they would just rot away and also emit a lot of methane and CO2.  Another thing that bothers me about the conversation of food and CO2 is that nobody ever seems to mention the circle of life. Plants grow from CO2 in the air. Animals eat plants and other animals. And when animals breathe or die, they release that CO2 back into the world (Over simplification). This means that within this circle, it's impossible to introduce carbon that wasn't already there to begin with. Which means that in order to increase the CO2 in the air, you have to introduce an outside source of carbon. Hello fossil fuels. But for some reason people are more interested in how much cows eat and burp than the fossil fuels required for beef and the alternatives.  Lastly, according to Wren (the CO2 calculation website) changing my mainly carnivorous diet (showing my bias here) to a completely vegan diet, would save about 5% on my total CO2 footprint (which already was about 30% lower than my country's average). So it doesn't really seem like meat has that much of an impact compared to the rest of our lives.
I don't understand why everyone is so concerned with decreasing our carbon footprint like literally just let everything happen that's a problem for future generations to solve
Chickens do not eat exclusively crops.
I have been on the fence about factory farms but this settles it!
The smiling cow is kinda creepy   Edit: ah now it’s a demon cow lol
Our vast overconsumption of meat is a recent change in human history; with effort, it can change back.
I think doing away with vegans, vegetarians and climate activist would be better for the environment than getting rid of my hamburgers
The problem is not meat, it's the farty animals and their life long farting
beef stonks
I would rather die and take you all with me than give up ribeye.
The one problem we have is: we are to many. It doesn't matter if I stop eating meat when we are 11 billion in 2050, it literally doesn't matter. And as we aren't cruel enough to kill off 80% of humans to get to a more sustainable 1 to 2 billion mark, we will get more extreme climate and more extreme famine/droughts. Like the grasshopper plagues. They multiply so fast until they can't sustain themselves any longer and then collapse with only a few surviving. That is our problem. And being vegan or driving electric vehicles only slows this down, it doesn't solve the problem that 10 billion people is just too many for this earth.
Thank you once again for such a great video. I hope more people realize how unnecessary and destructive the meat industry is.
What I don’t understand is that an avocado has to Travel far to europe, but then also has the local - high - emission from harbor to supermarket?
All of this and still people don't understand why Hindus don't eat beef
Don’t eat meat, I suggest.  For the sake of the animal.  Stop making babies.  Overpopulation is the root cause of climate change.  I have spoken.
reducing human population would also help. Humans also release methane. Let's erase half of the people, without discrimination at random.
Raise this topic in india and you're doomed🤣🤣😅
Great video, but I think it'd be much more interesting if beef wasn't the prime focus of every meat discussion. Since poultry and pork are more widely eaten anyways it'd be interesting to see if we could keep eating meat but only if beef was removed
私は日本人です。 私たち日本人はより母国語でこの内容を理解したいので翻訳に日本語を追加して欲しいです。
WAIT!! you missed one huge argument that I've heard though, which is that animals eat the part of wheats and such that we cannot digest. Im guessing that it is not entirely true, but maybe a good portion of what they eat is the leftovers of the agricultural food we eat which would change the numbers
Nothing can save Earth unless we reduce our population.
Go green...!
It's admittedly easy for me to refrain from eating beef as I've always hated the taste, anyway, safe for some mixed beef/pork products. By contrast, I love most pork and poultry, which, while worse than plant-based food, are close enough, that I consider my environmental conscience sufficiently clean in this regard, as I also try my best to limit meat to once, at most twice, per week. And deforestation has always been my main source of aggravation. ... When did "saving the rainforest" stop being hip?
"spetially in brazil" thats is such a shame for all the country, I'm embarassed to be brazilian, we need to change this bad habbit
I think we should see different food not as economic issue, but more like a dietery issue. Eating only beef is not going to make you live healthy life even though it contain so much more  proteins than plants. Well ballanced diet is essential for all living animals including humans. Let's start from there and later we think about CO2 and climate change. There are way more ways to combat climat change than actually attacking our food sources.
We have to seriously start investing in artificially produced meat from lab grown cells
i read the thumbnail as "meat lore"
Mai aagaya 🎉🎉🎉
You're making a category error at 8:30 in, Cows are not necessarily eating the same parts of the plant(or even the same plants). For example humans eat just the kernals of a corn plant but cows can eat the whole stalk, leaves and cob, the same with cotton plants (which we don't eat) and wheat and oats etc. So it's not an apples to apples comparison.
Pre-viewing comment: I am a hunter, but I am for destroying industrialized real-meat production and requiring all animals raised for food to have adequate access to outdoor space and can't be kept crammed together their....entire....lives. Once different forms of faux-meat become more prevalent they can help fill that gap. Climate change.... I mean I want us to do all we can to fight it but here not torturing animals is my prime reason.  I have no intention of ever not eating meat-like food and I'll only make a switch to faux-meat (sometimes) when I literally can't tell the difference. Don't care whether that means plant-based or real meat grown in a tube, as long as my body thinks it's food and my mouth thinks it's meat it's all good. But an adult elk can feed a family of four for half a year or more so I doubt I'll ever NEED to have alternatives often.
Oh wow, i just relised this channel is originally german. So german video's get uploaded first. Sadly i dont know german though
as a vegan i disagree
Although there is so much more to food than protein  I mean, there are reasons why we don't just eat a dense protein bar a day
i havent watched the video, but i have a guess. no meat is not bad for the climate, what is bad for the climate is the mass breeding of the animals.
What about production of artificial meet in labs?
Climate Change shouldn't even be a topic to discuss over animal meat , It should be their life. Over the years it looks like the people literally forgot that those animals also have life.
9:28 You Said we could remove 800billion tones over 100 years  And than you compared it to 50 billion tons a year  If you add it up 50*100= 5000 billiontons in 100 years
I always figured the worst part of raising beef was the land that had to be cut down.
As a vegan I’m extremely happy that a balanced viewpoint has been presented by this banger of a channel for it’s millions of viewers. This really will help people ask the right questions. Sometimes somethings are just more important than your preferences.
We should try and grow meat in a lab
Bad or not, as long as there's no real replacement then people will keep eating meat, even regardless of how much it costs Vegen meat either smells differently or tastes differently or feels differently Hopefully science will find a solution
“No bodily function can be done multiple times per day and still be fun”   My right hand: 👀
really seems like it only provides one side of an argument and cherry picks arguments and statistics to support it.  not that it matters either way.
Wow
Did soya meat solve problem?
Poor mascot bird I hope someone help them
But i like it
when you want to live, becoming meat is not a happy place.
kurzgesagt, stop making these climate videos, just continue on the space ones.
no
Kurzgesagt be like  Video 1: meat is bad Video 2: or is it?  **vsauce music plays in background**
i'm eating a vegan meal 3 times per week
Animal grade grain and human grade grain does not have the same regulation so if you have a bad year and your grain does not meet the human standard you can still used it for animals without wasting it.
Can you tell us the dislike percentage ? I want to know how f*cked we are...
I think Imma just cut beef out my diet and maybe eat it like once a month max for a special occasion
I was a child when I told my family I would never put the rotting flesh of murdered slave animals in my mouth ever again. It was 1968 and I am still a vegetarian.
so, by this video, we can confrim that ..........Kurzgesagt is Vegan
TLDW: No it's not.
So you omitted a point: altering cattle feed and even gut bacteria of cattle to produce less methane.  I recall a study where mixing seaweed with cattle feed suppressed the emissions of CO2 significantly.  If our current cattle are methane factories, putting a price tag on methane production would both encourage less beef being eaten, but also encourage beef producers to alter and breed low methane cows.  Also, a point you omitted is that methane that enters the atmosphere decays into CO2, so a methane emission is just a deferred, more potent CO2 emission.
Good thing I like Tofu.
For any person who wants to try Vegetarian food Try INDIAN VEGETARIAN FOOD you will love it .
Don't fall for that story that Brazil is burning down all of it's forests. It has today the strictest environmental laws in the whole world, and pretty much everyone is enforced to respect it, the fines are massive.
just eat veggies ppl lol
The most obvious  answer is that there's too much of us on Earth. It's a reality and we ask too much for our planet and its resources.
This is absolutely brilliant! Great questions to answer in such times! So so so important and relevant!
I love the "Everyday is leg day". No.
The answer is no. There were far more "cattle" before humans expanded. We aren't even close to numbers that used to free roam. People continue to be upset there are people. Oh and climate change isn't human based either. News flash, it's been 15C cooler and 10C hotter than today in the past.
not that i would dislike this video but god do i hate that they removed dislikes
I think the best argument is all the food we utilise to feed livestock. The overwhelming amount of food grown goes to livestock. We should just eat less meat and cut down on the amount of livestock. It’ll help famine too.  Edit: so yeah, the 3rd argument. Switching to non-agriculture land only would reduce how much we eat, improve health and give more to go around.
i just realize a lot of art effford on this video X)
there is a such thing as responsible meat consumption (eating less than one cows worth of meat every 6 years) but the amount of plant based food that has to be grown just to create the meat in the first place is dramatically wasteful when it could feed 30 humans instead of one cow.
someone spent hours animating a dead meme
Thank you for the follow up video on meat! Thanks to you and previous videos on meat, I was able to write a paper on how meat affects the environment, and personally made the choice to become vegetarian.
Just stop with this agenda...
Short answer: yes.  That's why I've turned vegan even if I used to love animal products, our future is more important than my own individual pleasure.  Thanks a lot for this video 🙏🏻
this is state propaganda the carbon they want to remove is us. they want us slurping paste thru a tube in the matrix, i use think alex jones went to far with shit but every day he seems more sane
Most indian :- that not a problem ...we don't eat beef anyway 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Love it!
really hoping lab grown meat takes off and is good
So, "it's complicated, but yes"...?
finally a upload
So you’re saying switching to vegan diets could have a huge impact on nature in future?🤔🤔
Food waste was a huge miss of this video. Plus the large majority of carbon emissions globally do not come from food production but yes from transportation and the energy sector. Stop blaming food and look to the elephant in the room (energy and transportation industries). These industries benefit from you blaming your burger while you happily drive in your combustion car. Making the world vegan is not gonna stop global warming.
Rapid climate change...... lol More Globalist trash
I would love to consume less beefs, but chicken is waaaaaay more expensive and tofu too... Weirdly !
Love to see that you are talking about both sides of the debate about meat
How unusually depressing. But informative. But depressing.
"Our diet" is easily relatable. However, as someone who lives in Brazil, whose meat and soy production is largely funnelled off-shore to feed livestock and people on other countries, assessing my diet's impact on the environment loses credibility, because brazilian food feeds foreign livestock and people. The Amazon rainforest is being burnt down at an ever-accelerating rate not because brazilian people must needs eat meat, but because in capitalism, my country must needs produce ever more in order to keep the economic growth going because economy gurus said that is the only way to exist in this world.
Meh, don't care at all. This topic is dead and dry. I liked this channel more when almost every video was about something actually interesting like civilization scales, stars and the immune system. The only people who are interested in how much CO2 is exactly emitted while producing a certain variation of tofu are either agriculture researchers or braindead manchilds, who spend all of their time trying to look morally superior on twitter.
In the 1800’s there were around 60 million Buffalo (Bison) in North America.  Comparing that to the 40 million total cows that we use for dairy and meat, I would say it has no to very little effect.  We also have to take into account the manure produced by the cows help to create more trees.
No one is going to stop eating meat. Like the video says its incredibly hard to get people to change their diets.   The ONLY solution to our meat problem is lab-grown meat. Even THAT is going to be a hard sell. Prices for natural meat will have to go way up and cultured meat will have to represent a cheaper alternative. Governments would have to break from their neoliberal laissez faire economic policy to make it happen, and we all already see how much they're willing to interfere with the economy to fight climate change (that is, not at all; they'll let the planet burn to ash before they interfere with the wealthy's $).
4.3k comments in one hour….incredible
Something that gets me upset is how much food goes to waste. I'm sure it's hard to preserve a lot of it, but if we cut back and started actually using all of the food we produce, I'd be curious to see how that effects the climate.
Yeah.... Lets ignore every authoritarian shit is happening in the world and just point at Brazil for all fucking problems Because CHINA dont produce a single Kg of Pollution, since you didnt show a shit about them, but Brazil that is getting BETTER at Reducing the Impact on the Amazon Forrest, now that is not Enough, the Worst Stage of deforestation accured during the 13 years of LEFTISTS and Socialists Party in government here in Brazil, and Only NOW you demonize us? This was a Great Channel that showed lots of info that many didnt want to show because of politics, now its the opposite, you HIDE information Because of Politics, . What china is doing to the environment makes even climate change deniers agree that this cannot continue. THEN WHY YOU KEEP PROTECTING THEM ??? Why you keep attacking those who are improving?? I can only think one possibility, POLITICS and IDEOLOGY. Because NO ONE looks at all data available and tells there is Nothing Wrong With China. . "why you are so mad with china, there is reason for that" Search for the channel China Insights and pick Any video the tittle may catch your attention, or better, watch the video about Why 80% of groundwater on China is very contaminated... . Kurzgesagt, enjoy the socialist money you are receiving from every authoritarian socialist government in the world, not talking about china, they are not the only one, Canada, Australia, Europe, Half of US. Waiting for your next video about "you will Own Nothing and you will be Happy"
What about feeding algea to cows to reduce the emission of methane?
I am getting hungry while watching this
Much of the "food crop" used to feed animals is agricultural byproducts that would end up in a landfill and directly converted to methane.
We can do forest farming which is better I think because trees absorb most of the emissions. You can take this consideration...... ✌️🍂🍂🍂
Stop cutting down treee and go to Kansad
I enjoy being environmentally friendly meat.
Its impossible to talk about that topic without mentioning the huge deforestation occuring in the amazon rainforest, for soy agriculture to feed the cows with it, and more deforestation to give space for growing them. I'm brazilian, and its sad to see gringos knowing much more of the amazon situation than the brazilians, and the president don't care about that, he even supports. What revolts me the most is that the brazilian people is going to suffer a lot with the amazon rainforest deforestation, in my city we are on water rationing, because the rain that goes to the whole country is formed in the amazon, through the flying rivers, because of the deforestation its not raining anymore. Without the Amazon all the brazillian economic system will collapse, because our economy is basicaly selling cows, soy and vegetables. Such a complex theme, but with a simple solution, *stop financing deforestation in the amazon buying brazillian meat.* If you are a foreigner, search if the meat you are buying is from Brazil, if it is, don't buy it. That protest will make pression in this shitty government that we brazilians have, to find a more susteinable way to make money. Brazil is the largest beef exporter in the world, sadly.
Instead of less beef, what about less humans?
Maybe Thanos was right with snapping us in half
Yes but... I catched on some deceiving graphs and comparations... Ex. 800 billions removed every 100y vs 50b emitted by year... You make it sound like there is such a surplus, but if you compare both on a yearly basis its 8 vs 50 emitted... Also, I know the theme of the video is meat, but you only talk about it related to human emissions (as individuals), but a small compare vs industries emissions would put all in a much different perspective...  It seems that you are presenting curated info to justify a point of view, rather than presenting objective info...
Watching this while eating a double  Angus from burger king lol
Really good video!!
"You can decide for yourself." These are powerful words that separate the grounded opinions of Kurzgesagt to the rampaging hordes of vegan moralists around. Human freedom is one of the reasons life is worth living for in the first place, and without the freedom to eat as one wills, such worth is heavily, if not utterly, compromised.
Im gonna like this video anyway but it's always nice to see more likes than dislikes.
there are more sufficient and more economical  ways to have farm animals it's all about balance and what you are trying to grow for food.
Suggesting that avocado that came on a ship aint gonna get packed on a truck and go hundreds of km after all.  Also plantations of veggies also take alot alot of space, degrades the soil and cause deforestation. Also alot of crops that cattle eat is made out of crops that are leftovers from production that are not good enough for humans.
Hello there, I'm some random dude on the internet, and I wanna share my opinions about vegan hamburgers. I gotta say, as someone who eats meat but lives in a vegan household, beyond meat and other vegan options are great! Obviously other than beyond (I haven't tasted the impossible burger) meat is the only one that compares to real meat but still the other other options are really good nonetheless! And seriously, when they do get better, I'll switch. Like seriously I already eat sandwiches with vegan cheese and butter and it tastes really good!  - a personal recommendation from some random dude on the internet
Please make video on Amazon deforestation and rapid wildfires and what can we as individuals do to stop that.
i do not want to live without beef, where are those bio engineers with the labgrown beef?
I'll only eat factory farmed meat now.
Fun fact that is often missed out in videos like this is that livestock dont just randomly create greenhouse gases naturally inside of them like some sort of industrial factory, they get it from the plants thy eat which in turn get it from the atmosphere so it is carbon neutral and not like fossil fuels that we dig up and release into the atmosphere.  Also, another fun fact, we all cant go vegan as our bodies are all different and so while some can go vegan with no issues, others will have severe health issues which is why nutritionists nowadays dont advise a single diet for all of humanity but suggest to try different diets out to see what works best for you.
EPIC
Epic
Nice video
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day..." Is that a challenge?
My chickens eat our leftovers and rarely have to be fed grains so I would think eating some meats also help in removing food waste.
if you see this, you have been bed.
I love meat
kurzgesagt really does a good job here explaining the relation of meat and carbon releasing.  I knew a chinese youtuber did the same topic but only ended in angry chinese attacking on him because they thought the video prohibits them from eating meat...
There is meat and mixed meat and crop production with negativo emitions that the cited studies didnt took into account.
CHECKMATE VEGANS!
Hmmmm.... thought vegetarianism was worse, cuz u need to eat a lot more to get the same amount of energy as from meat
Torfu?
Disliked
One day in a month will be my non-veg day inshallah.
This video made me crave a steak so I think that's what I'm going to do with this information go get me one
bruh yesterday i had towrite a history report so i decided to write about co2 i researched in your videos and where were you in the last 10 hours
TLDR: Yes, but no.  The issue is also, Meat is seen as a status symbol for the LEDC regions.
In the end, it's mostly overpopulation as the root cause, like with most things.
Only way I can see people actually reducing the impact of meat is if we figure out how to grow it artificially at commercial scale.
Nothing is gonna stop me from eating a big fat burger.
The methane released by cows is acually in a closed loope system, they consume grass, transformed it into methane, than then transform into CO2 into the atmosphere and get absorbed by grass to be eaten again. So in the long term, there is 0 net emissions.  One other aspect not talked about here is waste. A third of all food produced ends up in the trash, if we were less wasteful, food production wouldn't be suche a problem, whatever the diet.
I have no influence in politics, and I don't want to play martyr and sacrifice my creature comforts in vain while the corporatocracy continues to do orders of magnitude more damage to the earth than the entire subculture of individual citizens concerned about the environment... so I'll just eat my meat with more guilt than I did yesterday.
Top quality video as always!!!
Don’t care, gonna keep eating meat either way. You will not make me eat the bugs.
My problem is that I still can't afford going vegan, meat is expensive, but in my town, a vegan burger costs 3x as much as the beef ones. I have tried many times doing some of the simplest and cheapest vegan foods I could find, but then sometimes I can't even find the ingredients in my local supermarket, and also, I'm not good with kitchen and anything that is complicated, takes too much time, or wastes too much gas is a problem for me.  Going vegan is not just a matter of deciding to do the good thing, that's easy, it's a matter of being able to afford, and having access to the things you need to do that change.
Honestly i don´t care, im not going to stop eating meat just because it´s apperently good for enviroment
Good that i eat the best meat, Chicken (home killed)
No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day you say?  Apparently you do not drive Georgia highways throughout the day.  We all enjoy flipping people off whether it be morning, noon, or night.  Our favorite middle finger salute.
Some people have diet restrictions that pretty much require regular meat consumption.
Veggie diet is just superior in many ways except for calories per gram. The taste though... I totally get why people don't want it. I wonder if humanity got no choice but to go vegan, will it finally taste good?
Me watching the video-damn i think I will stop eating meat from now on   Me after watching the video - mom lets eat the steak u bought yesterday
Might I ask: When comparing the transport of avocados to the transport of meat, I feel as if it is not considered that, when the avocados arrive that they are also transported locally to different markets. I feel like it would be a more fair comparison if that was considered.  Thanks again for the great video!
No matter how bad it is, meat eaters will not stop eating it
Avoiding controversies like pro.
Congrats to everyone who is early and found this comment!👑
I have IBS and i turned flexitarian (only eat meat when i visit someone who cooked it) and I rarely have symptoms anymore.
Simplistic take, but is this not an easy problem to solve? We can (as shown in video) have (i) a smaller carbon footprint, (ii) consume healthier sources of protein (sure a larger volume), and (iii) never have to worry about the philosophical and ethical issues of exploiting animals against their will; just by switching to vegan diets!
This video feels like someone had a very annoying argument with a meat eater and they decided to document all the counter arguments to save anyone else from suffering through it haha
Can't wait to suck on that insect juice
So we have the optimized beef numbers, what about optimized chicken? By dollar to protein, it’s the cheapest option in my area at 1 dollar to about 120 grams of protein. Massively cheaper than any other option.
Well for now I'm still not vegan yet, I guess I'll switch to lab grown meat when that's affordable (Now it's like 8$ per hamburger, so no)
Yes. Yes it is
Ive personally decided to just cut out beef/steak as much as possible
If you think climate change is more important than factory farmed animals suffering then I'm sorry you're brainwashed
Itd be interesting to see how a full implementation of lab grown and synthetic meat production would influence CO2 emissions.
go vegan
Everyone: how much information are you gonna give us this time? Kurzgesagt: *Yes*
I'd love to see you make a video about entomophagy, the consumption of insects for food. I've read that it is a much more sustainable method to feed humanity, and would produce far fewer carbon emissions than meat and crops do.
It's one thing to tell the masses to get a long and follow along. But when the elites virtue signal and then are hypocritical about it, it's hard to care.
the arrow go down*  Beef STONK
The bad thing is we love beef
4:45 Star Destroyer freight ships
I pretty much only eat meat, I don't care how poorly animals are treated
Like yeah it would help to go vegan on the other hand I literally walk almost everywhere and barely ever use public transport so I feel like I am not gonna change my diet any time soon.
Good effort, but as other comments specify, in trying to condense this topic into a few minutes, you've left out a lot of important details. As a result, the conclusion that you come to is innacurate and misleading for those uninformed on the topic. I won't be writing a youtube comment essay on all of the missing info, but feel free to read some of the other comments that do.
Anyone who has been subjected to days of Thanksgiving leftovers, knows eating does, in fact, get old.
what this all boils down to is that we cant use sustainable methods due to the scaling, which then makes it a problem of overpopulation. We aren't going to be able to solve climate change while the world is still over populated, climate change is just a result of stretching earths resources too thin.
Kurzgesagt please turkish cc plssss
By buying beef locally you are trying to avoid bjp
I always preferred pork or chicken, so I'll stick with that.
Mind-blowing but true
Vegans be over the moon ryt now...💀

Turkish cc pleaseeeeee
Climate change is not a crisis. We’ll be fine
"You can decide for yoyrself, what you want to do with this information." THIS! This Right Here is why Kurzgesagt is AWESOME!!!!
Late!!
One thing everyone forgets about is that those brazilian farmers arent billionaires who can choose to do something else. Most of that land in brazil is being cut by people who need it to feed their family. Fixing the deforestation of the amazon forest would require us to address poverty in south america, brazil especially, as a global community.  Also, "using that land to grow forest", wont be economically viable for a lot of people. They'll probably do something else rather than have a patch of land that does nothing, so again brazil would have to intervene directly, something it probably wont do because its already having an economic crysis
Turkish cc where are youu
I heard (not sure about the truthfulness of it) that certain additives to feed can drastically reduce emissions (farts and burps) like seaweed for instance. Have any of y'all heard of that?
Eating 🥓 🥓 🥓  while watching this 😎
Good work
So, best way to use livestock is by feeding it things that we can not consume, and using most of agricultural foods for human consumption.
Add seaweed into the animal feed. Legislate it into law.   This will reduce the methane emissions from cow burps.
Is this a vegan propaganda? Because this is how you make a vegan propaganda.
Tbh, the beef you get here where I live nowadays tends to suck. Just like many other products, the "middle ground" has ceased to exist, so the one they sell at the supermarket is cheap and tasteless, while if you want to get the good stuff you must spend a fortune, I only eat it when I'm at my parent's and my mother prepares a goulash, otherwise I am more into pork or, better, seafood.
0:00 Meat? Don't you mean specifically beef? Idk EDIT: 2:20 ok there's beef 💜
Rising temperature is not the only climate crisis that meat contributes to; the ever approaching water shortage from the staggering amounts used on crops and animal feed, coupled with human pollution contributes to another type of climate change. Yet another crisis that is bound to start conflicts and tensions in the near future.
I saw a T cel on the dinner table
So... We should strive towards veganism.
Please turkish cc
So, if i stop eating meat, will there be a significant difference? We need a great change in agriculture in every country, talking about individual responsibility is totally nugatory which kurzgesasgt pointed out last.
"Is meat REALLY bad for the climate?"  No. Case closed. Vegans, cope harder.
Solution, invest everything into carbon capture technology so we can continue to eat meat until we nail down artificial plant based meat like beyond burger.
So what you're saying is: we could greatly combat climate change if people stopped being addicted to meat?
The best kind of meat equivalent is insects.  Easy to produce  And a competitor in protein
The fact that animals living in horrible conditions, is more efficient and produce less pollution is so sad.
it looks like kurzgesagt is against meat
What i love about them is the fact they're always open to debate and never goes " all things wrong in this world is cause of one guy or one group"
"Only grassland can not sustain the diets of cows" Yeah but they also eat hay and we don't.
Despite being 5 times more populated, our country's carbon footprint per capita is 15 times less than that of the USA, and roughly 37 times less than that of Qatar (which is also 650 times less populated than India). And most of it is also due to us being a "developing" nation.  Our country's food based carbon footprint is almost negligible compared to all other countries. Much... *_much_* lower than that of the States.
Please make a video on planktons and their role in the ecosystem
I am from India I don't eat beef or pork or lamb or horse and will never do that in my life. Also, I decided to decrease the rate of eating chicken, fish and mutton.
So Mark Rober made a video about this topic. According to his video, Humans tends to get their energy (calories) & proteins more on plants (90%) over meat (10%), making them worse energy converter (from the Sun). You also said in this video that meat (beef) will keep us alive much longer that plant (potato). I don't understand since if we get the majority of calories & proteins came from plants, then technically they'll keep us alive much longer than meat. In other words one of you is lying or didn't research properly. So the question is which one of you is wrong in terms of data?
Im not sure if its intentional but the title in ingenious, It makes you think that meat really is not bad and it will be proven in the video so even people who argue eating meat is not so bad will watch it:P
Eat the bugs wagie
Short answer yes Long answer:
Thank you a lot for the free first month
Short answer: Yes. Glad I'm vegan
Meat itself isnt bad , it's even neccessary,  the issue is that we make too much of it for too few and we need a lot of cattle for it witch a lot of the problem comes from , a better way would be to make better markets that allow a lot more diversity in foods , that way everyone can eat and theres no need for such dense farms witch in the cycle make the food worse and thus us less healthy but if we lessened our need on one type of food alone we'd manage to force companys to take quality into consideration and through care we can not only solve world hunger but also manage to lower the immisions significantly bow put that along side everything else we can do and things can drastically be made better without just getting rid of somthing for no reason
Yes yes it is
Food is not optional  *North Korea wants to know your location*
Epic video! Very interesting and controversial topic… I am going vegetarian because of the reasons listed in this video. (also quick everybody buy the calendar now or literally never again I have already ordered mine!)
time to go vegan i guess
Way to miss a massive detail y'all. I'm sorry but I'm fed up with the lie that cattle cannot be grass-fed. Beef production could be shifted 100% to grass-fed (with GAINS in efficiency) if we simply converted the fields currently growing crops to feed to cows into pasture. The math has been done, any field can produce the same amount of calories in grass as in corn and soy. As well grass does not suffer from major disease or pests, does not require fertilizer, acsesses deep nutrients, prevents runoff, and stores rain water more efficiently. Simple math will also tell you that this method would also take less transportation. Cows gain 1 pound for about every 5 they eat, thus if you are transporting the cows from the food instead of the food to the cows, you are likely to require significantly less transportation. Not even including the reduced need for pharmaceuticals since the cattle would be spread over a much greater area (and actually exposed to sunshine) compared to a CAFO. Please look past the lies you have been told and think critically about the problem. Cows are adapted to eat grass, they were never meant to eat corn.
Well reducing consumption and switching back to traditional farming methods would solve most of these issues. Feeding pigs and chickens food waste like in the old days can't be much worse than letting the food rot.
It would be interesting to see co2 data for beef substitute products like Impossible Foods.
Yes.
idk what the big deal is about eating less beef, it doesn't even taste that good anyways, pork and chicken are way better hell id be happy to eat way less meat and fish in general me & my family have too much of it
So you wanna kill cows and not even eat them?
Always remember: a product of beef bought will not effect the fact it was made. Buy your beef if you want, you won't boycott anything successfully.
I think the only reason why eating meat is "bad" is because we humans are the only species capable of herding a reliable meat source. It's the mass production to make food readily available to mankind that thus make eating one type of food a "bad" act. As far as I know, no apex predator has ever done such a feat. Heck, we humans sit on the top of the food chain not because we are deadly predators, we are just efficient enough to utilize herds into food sources but not efficient enough to reduce waste.  The way I see it, changing diets merely slows that effect. One can only wait until the inevitable destruction of the planet or until mankind (as they often do) invents a better way to maintain and produce all kinds of food. Until then, I'll keep eating what I want to eat, thanks.

Some things to think about with this;  1. A huge majority of the 'human food' we do end up sending to feedlots are actually the inedible parts (oat hulls, soy hulls, wheat stems and leaves, spent beer grains, etc) of plants and so you could argue we are simply using our resources more efficiently than letting it rot in landfills (which is a massive source of emissions btw)  2. The argument that the non-arable land used for grazing animals (grasslands, mountains, etc) could be used for ecological restoration instead is misguided for a few reasons. One is that you are ignoring just how much of a carbon-sink these grasslands are. if they are properly managed and grazed, they are an important tool in restoring the climate. Grasslands absorb carbon and sequester it by building soil (which forests are surprisingly bad at). This cannot be done without grazing animals (or people having to manually mow grass or have controlled fires) because grasslands will actually die if there arent animals. Look into some of the Siberian and African restoration projects involving grasslands to understand this a bit better. They key is proper management, however.   3. The transport emissions issue comes down to a flaw in the scientific method. Many of the early studies (mostly done by IPCC) that measured emissions from vehicles ONLY measured tailpipe emissions. Even the authors of some of these reports admitted this later. They did not measure the emissions cycle of the transport method in the same way that they measured the whole life cycle of cattle. This means the numbers are very misleading and I fully believe transportation (and buying locally) actually plays a massive role in this debate and is being underplayed in this video.  4. Countries like the United States are astronomically better at land management and farming practices than third-world countries. If you look at the agricultural emissions of the united states, its comparatively very low despise the massive cattle herds. Using a 'global average' is misleading. We need to spread better farming practices globally.   Overall I liked the video, but I think there were some important things missing and one has to be careful about the data sources as they are largely based on flawed and/or politically driven studies. Some degree of common sense, deductive reasoning and logic needs to play a part in this as well.
Vegan teacher would have given 10/10 on this video 😂
I can learn to live without beef. Because theres other meat options.  However I couldn't live without no meat. I like ham and there could be a way to make hamburgers of ham that's why there called hamburgers :p.
Eating only 13%of the meat we currently eat is fully duable in my opinion. It means basically eating meat only every 15th time we do now. If we assume we have meat for lunch and dinner (if a lot or a little, doesnt matter) wed simply have to go back to eating a meat containing meal once a week. Perfectly doable.  We can even supplament with fish. As that has a way lower co2 output.  Or instead of 7 meatballs on your dayly spagetty, put 1 on every day. Or  2 every 2 days, and eat your spagetties with pesto in between instead.
Fuck off I like meat and I will continue to eat it twice a day
Soylent Green is the only answer.
What I'm getting from this: the problem isn't the consumer, the problem is the way we produce our food, and bring it to the masses..
9:34 You compared 100 years of co2 removed with the same scale as ONE year of co2 emitted, that is some of the most misleading shit I've ever seen in my entire life. Unsubbed. I'm even a green advocate but you just basically tried to LIE to people to get your point across.
sorry commies, I'll be bench pressing you vegans till I'm 70 with my beef diet
"Because of this feed demand, less than half of crops are used directly as food." -> Incorrect. Farmers are not stupid. For example, before a farm harvests wheat, the quality of the crop will be assessed, the crop sorted, and animals get fed the portion that does not make the cut for human consumption. You get 2-3 times less money for your wheat if you sell it / use it as animal feed as you would if it can be sold for flour, so why would you? Plant production exists in parallel with meat production and not to supply it. You get all sorts of social problems, beside the environmental ones where that's not true.
You guys missed  some of the advantage of beef: - They create natural fertilizers. Without beef you would need to almost dubbel fertilizer production.  - Cows are not only eating the crops, which  we could eat, but all other parts of the plants, which would be just waste otherwise.
That vegan teacher: yes yes it is bad for the climate
Eat more chickn'!
I just love kurzgesagt
What about seafood? I notice this wasn’t mentioned at all.
Dislike
"No amount of bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day"   Teenagers - you underestimate my power
I VOLUNTEER AS A TRIBUTE FOR DISLIKES
Not eating the bugs, not taking the vax, not living in the pod.
It's crazy to think that we alone can stop climate change... yet China sits there and has no regulation... if China doesn't cooperate we are only gonna extend the time we have by a little bit.
what about a lab grown meat?
This would be twice as good if you explained that the future of meat/dairy mass production is not on the field but in the lab, since we already have several companies making actual lab meat and dairy protein. A mention to labs like Aleph, Just and Perfect Day would have been very very realistic to what the future actually holds.
I’m seeing a lot of people say “its still unclear what we should do”. It’s so obvious, we waste so much resources raising animals to kill, whether you want to hear it or not.
0:04 I think there is another boys
Short anwer; MEAT PRODUCTION is bad for the climate, not meat in itself.
What about Fish?  They are farmable and don’t take up land used by trees. Fish is also really yummy.
It would be way easier doing your part if it wasn't for the corporations, politicians and rich ruining it all for everyone.
the part about factory farming being the main way to reduce meat emissions without stop eating meat was probably my crucial realisation when I decided to become vegan
So vegans are right
Watching this while eating beef .-. …
"Kurzgesagt" always uses the veil of "science" to promote the agenda decided by billionaires. Watch What I've Learned's video on the topic to get to know the truth. Meat is an essential food, that they want to deprive you of because they want you weak and stupid.  "SCIENCE" is how they sell you on giving up on your standard of living. You remember how over the last 2 years they locked down western economies, killed millions of small businesses and added 10 trillion to the wealth of the worlds billionaires, because of a virus with a 99.9% survival rate? Trust the science guys! Give me a break.
It's not really complicated. We can't continue to eat the way that we do now. A vegitarian or vegan diet would have a massive positive impact on the issue at hand. It's all sunlight energy being converted into chemical energy. The more steps you take from the source the more inefficient it is.
The 100 companies cost 70% of the Co2 if if 50% switch to clean energy Co2 levels will dorp to 60%    Also Nuclear energy is perfect for the environment
This looked a lot at beef specifically, but chicken has about the same CO2 emissions as broccoli does per Calorie.   I would have loved to see this addressed, but it definitely feels like this was just a push for veganism, and not actually discussing how meat production could be a viable option still, just without red meat. I support veganism, but chicken and eggs are invaluable for the diets of a lot of people, especially those in poorer communities. Veganism is still too expensive for the average person to live healthily on. We can't just look at the science, but have to look at the socio economic impacts our decisions would have as well. Red meat is really bad, but there's more meat out there than just beef.
Perfectly well timer im making a speech about veganism!
It's really not difficult to stop eating animals. I've been at it for more than 5 years now and have never felt better in my life. For protein you only truly need something like .5g per kg of weight, and that is very easy to accomplish without animals. Also, real whole foods taste so much better now that I no longer consume all the salt/sugar and oils that I used to. I find it sad that people really want to cling on to eating dead animals.
Feeding cattle a little sea weed can reduce methane emissions by 80% !!
Better ti eat less meat than eating only vegetables.  We're not gorillas, can't digest cellulose. Even chimps, our closest relatives, need meat. For me the solution is A) Bugs B) Sinthetic meat. Or maybe we could just stop getting burgers every day for a dollar and grill every day
Meat should not even be a topic due to it been a food source regardless on how a country is responsible for the way it's produced. The deforestation is a discussion that will never go away but in some places logging is needed to boost and maintain a whole country economy I think it's a African country.  Has for the Amazon we are all hypocrites expecting things to change whilst we moan about it on our technology in our homes that aren't energy efficient and snacking or drinking on stuff which we won't recycle the waste after. We are the problem the consumers not businesses or a country.   Lastly in some countries it is a cheaper option and convenient to eat processed foods or meats than eating healthy when it should be the other way round.
I agree we need to bring back a ton of forests to help deal with this issue, until the day comes that we can technologically make carbon capture either far cheaper, or even profitable. However i'm not gonna stop or reduce my meat consumption. You only have one life, and if you can't enjoy the little things, there's no point to having it at all.  The solution to all of these issues is technological innovation; -economical lab grown meat (will love to see how the vegans respond to that one), -genetically engineered crops that's way more efficient in food production requiring far less land, or hopefully no land, as in multistory indoor farms, -renewable energies that's more profitable than fossil fuels, -economical carbon capture.
That fartometer really got me
Lets see how that stupid vegan teacher would react
Even if the explanation was somewhat complicated, the conclusion was simple, if you care about the animals or the environment then go vegan.
So gen Z will be the generation to fix or help climate change exponentially. I was hoping I could be lazy, and just like the generations before me, that I could pass on the responsibility to gen Alpha or something like that. Now I know why the issue is only starting to become important and aided. Unlike my parents lifestyle, I will have to be more careful.
This video is making me hungry
Regardless what happens, the elites and the Greta thunbergs of the world will be eating prime rib and flying private jumbo jets, while you live in a pod and eat bugs. Meanwhile co2 is plant food.   This climate push is not about saving the world, it's about the elites enslaving humanity.
Beef: It's What's For Dinner
I honestly feel like i'd rather be alive to witness the extinction of the human race than stop eating meat, I eat relatively little meat compared to the average person but it's not something I'm willing to live without
MEANWHILE ALIENS TALKING ABOUT EATING HUMANS OR PLANNING TO INVADE EARTH
According to "A History of World Agriculture: From the Neolithic Age to the Current Crisis" much of the grasslands there is today were made by agriculture.  We already know rational agricultural techniques which can restore forest at the same time as producing food, for example sintropic and sucessional agriculture.
Oh shit, the vegans are in the right. Who could have known ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)   P. S. They didn't even mention other harmful effects like antibiotic resistance (80% of all antibiotics are used for meat), usage of plastics while fishing, epidemics, and of course, rape and killing of the animals (you can't get that choccy milk without some forceful impregnation boisss).
Please make a video about humans killing marine life and how that affects everything
I can't even imagine how much research went into making this video. Kudos to you guys!!!
I'm curious how fish and seafood stacks up against land-based livestock. I imagine huge fishing trawlers aren't the most efficient things in the world, but it's not like we're planting forests or grasslands in the ocean right?
Grass is not useless it's edible
Monkey in beginning holds cow instead of banana
Very well-presented video. I didn't realize how... I think the word "efficient" is best... freight liners are. I have on several occassions justified a long road trip with the fact that a single freighter emits so much and we have so many of them that reduction of consumption is more worth it than reduction of personal travel. Of course, reduction is still the best "R" out of the re-use and recycle mantra.  A graphic that confuses me is at 9:08--why is 2 billion hectares represented by a green South America and 3 billion hectares is represented by deserted Africa?
I am so sad because there is no korean support anymore 😢
Even eating is destroying the planet now
Kurzgesagt "It's complicated. But actually it's not and don't eat meat. "
Please add Arabic to your videos ☹️
Recently, people have been cultivating meat in laboratories and not via pastures or factories. I'd like to see Kurzgesagt delving into that and discussing the pros and cons of that, and whether will it or will it not cut our carbon footprint.
You are comparing the harm from 1 kg of meat and 1 kg of plant foods. But how many plants does it take to replace meat? How much energy does the body spend on digesting plant foods? How does a large amount of indigestible plant foods affect the human mind? All this needs to be considered
Thank you Kurzgesagt! I'm vegan and I'm so glad there are non-biased channels like this looking at these issues critically, and sharing the problems with a wide audience.
Hey research and make a video....on " IS GENOCIDE OF HUMANS THE ONLY BEST WAY TO SECURE THE HUMANITY'S FURURE?.... PLEASE 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
even if we were to free up the land for potential forest growth, we would rather use it for any other commercial use because humans are greedy
Nuclear power . I will never change.
Couldn't help but notice Kurzgesagt waited until dislikes were disabled before posting on this subject matter 😂
food is hard
Sorry, but I'm not stopping with the meat, I would rather grow the animais and kill them with my own teeth than to stop eating it
Watching kurzegegsat video is the best moment to do away with blues..meanwhile deliberately getting the same...lol🦍
I feel I am missing a fairly important part about the usage of Soy. It says 77% is used to feed animals by feeding the animals Soy Cake. But would us humans be able to consume 100% of the produced soy? I thought a fairly large part of soy production (soy byproducts) isn't suitable for human consumption anyhow and cows are "helping" us to make good use of this?
Support with 💕
The solution is obvious! Let’s give cows gas medicine!  Idk probably not
There really is only ONE way to stop global warming, and it's the one thing that is totally unthinkable to politicians. Start taxing people heavily, based on how many children they have. It's fair, too. Why should childless people pay for the education of children? People follow incentives. End the welfare state and stop global warming with one simple policy: care for your own damn children.
This is a bit misleading: I know they said that beef is an outlier, and they mentioned that several points are controversial, but then they continue to roll with only one animal and one side of each controversy. The short term climate effect from beef is large due to methane, but the effect in 100 years is negligible.  They say that even the best beef is worse than the worst plants. This is not true. Most vegetables are worse, only grains, beans and roots are better. If you remove the methane contribution (because it is short term), then even mediocre beef is better than broccoli. Furthermore, beef is by far the worst "offender". Chicken have a calorie conversion ratio of 1.7. They are fed with animal feed. This animal feed is grown much more efficiently than comparable food for humans. This leads to Chicken being better for the environment than all fruit and leafy vegetables. Also some roots are worse. Only grains and starchy roots are better. You can not make a meal based on grains and starchy roots that is comparable in quality to a mixed meal. If you substitute the meat portion of a mixed diet, then it would be fairer to compare with fruits and vegetables, and not with grains and potatos.
What if we reduce human population? More controls on birth.
Aren’t vehicles the major problem for climate. I don’t recall Meat being a major contributor to that. Is that vegan propaganda?
I hope they will also discuss not just the emissions but as well as the other causes (water usage, plastic.. etc.) for climate change, kinda broad and long topic but it will be interesting to know keke
Animal agriculture is one of the leading causes of climate change. There's no single bigger thing you can do than to switch to a plant-based diet. ❤️
This video makes me hating my major animal husbandry even more
its comical how many people missed the other video about the whole reducing your personal carbon footprint being propaganda by what I vaguely remember being something along the lines of standard oil to shift the blame to you
Climate change doesn’t exist
Got it steps to solve global warming : Stop having so much kids (like 4 billion should've been enough ) Eat your vegetables ! Put laws on packaging(like honestly we don't need 1 meter of packaging for a usb) Drive electric and try to use renewable energy  💥problem solved...well maybe significantly lower
5:20 why isnt there Finland?! Im very dissapointed
As always, you guys made an amazing video. That being said, still plan on eating beef when the opportunity arises.
The only channel whose videos I watch at 1080p or 1440p
Just eat crickets 🤷
This is the dislike for this video
Well, we should at least reduce the amount of meat we consume.  Maybe meat free Monday?
The Brasil part is blatantly a lie. Brasil has one of the most strict laws when it comes to environment around the globe, if not the most. Every Farmer is obliged by law to save up to 80% of it's land to conservation, 80%!   Not to mention that most of Amazon is under ecological reserves that can't be touched.  There's a documentary on Brasil Paralelo that covers this quite well, since I can't show you all my ecology classes, that one do the job, it's called Smoke Curtain (Cortina de Fumaça, if you don't find it by the other name).
0:49 i only know that cowfarts are bad for the ozone or something...
He is moving more and more from science to propaganda.
another definitely maybe
This analysis is entirely based on the "carbon budget" thing. Lol
The ignorant creator didn't study anything at all! This video is biased and prejudiced.
I have so many good ideas
I don't want gurzgasaght video to end
Why not just make co² sucker?
Maybe those animals do not think the same way we humans do, because we know physics, chemistry, biology, and history. But I guarantee you they sure do feel the same way we humans do. Pain is a universal constant.
beef stonks got me
if ships are effichent instead of trucks we can just use ships for transport. even if u live next door
I love how in the intro the ape is always holding something connected to the video
Very valuable video
What if we stopped eating beef altogether?
WOO
The best way to solve this problem is by reducing the world's population by creating a virus and only give the cure to selective people.
I have decided based on this information that I will have a burger for lunch.
I really hope lab-grown meat can become environmentally good and be cheap enough.
the vegan burger patty is just not healthy tho (ﾟﾍﾟ)ゞ
Plant-based and vegan pilled
does seem that complicated, beef is bad for the environment
The only solution is active Cleaning of the atmosphere. Make the people and industries that produce co2 pay a tax to clean double what they produce. This will make meat more expensive driving down meat consumption.
Use impossible burgers
So it basically comes down to banning beef.  Which I never ate so yeah suck it vegans I will eat chicken.
Sooo, the revolutionary idea we need is a pill or something to make cows stop farting?
Really good
Would going to war against Brazil be a viable option to stop deforestation, if they refuse to stop themselves. They are smoking with the planets lungs and we cannot let that continue.
"chicken and pigs, which exclusively use feed crops..." Um... in most of Southeast Asia, chickens are basically allowed to roam free and eat whatever they can catch. You just catch them when you need them for dinner, and/or make nest baskets for laying eggs. Pigs are mostly fed with leftovers + wild-harvested plants like wild sugarcane or water spinach which grow abundantly on land unsuitable for agriculture without need for cultivation. But then again, these are basically backyard "farms", which don't exist anymore in most of the western world.   The problem with these calculations is that they assume agriculture is industrial by default.
dont talk to me about the climate if you arent willing to mention that china and india produce ridiculous amounts of pollution compared to the rest of the planet
As far as I'm concerned, "factory farmed" beef is just putting cattle in feedlots where they are either finished on grain or they eat forage left from the harvesting season.  I am studying about the meat industry and debating about these topics is very interesting, especially within the US.
Nah thanks, we'll keep eating our meat since being a vegetarian is just not sustainable.
Kill all cows. It's easy. Reintroduce them lightly in 50 years. A bloody but necessary sacrifice humanity needs to make.
Your videos are the one of the best thing to see in all YouTube. Thanks for what you do.
I would go the Polish way for continuing to eat meat. Most villages have one butcher and his supply of fresh meat is sold out every day. Some meat is hard to get, depending on where you live. All of it, however, is sourced from local small farms where the animals have calm and spacious living areas. You can't say that about all of the megafarms in western nations. On a yearly basis I read at least a dozen times than hundreds of thousands of animals have died in a single fire. These kind of farms simply should not exist.
so what happen if you make meat in vitro and vertical farming
Can there be a followup about pork and poultry? I would struggle to completely cut meat from my diet cold turkey (no pun intended), but I could certainly cut just beef immediately while slowly trying to eat less and less meat in general, but what difference does it make? According to that early graph it would be a lot, but that doesn't take into account the best beef vs the worst pork for example. But how do I know what good/bad pork is? Especially if it's all fed with crops.
Love the video I’m vegan and I support most of these ideas please drop a favourite
But on the other hand: A full vegan meal: 15$ A common meal: 7$  Yeah, in the first world countries that won't be too much of a deal, but anywhere else...
Regenerative agriculture may be the real solution. Thoughts?
Not STONKS nooo
In summary, the problem is not beef, pork, poultry or veganism, it's too many people on a planet not designed to feed this many people.
Buying locally sourced food doesn't contribute much to reducing emissions  because the majority of emissions come in the last few miles where food travels on trucks & stuff compared to extremely efficient cargo ships
Stop Hurting Cows!!! 😡😡😡
Oh I know the best thing to solve this. Inject plant DNA into our body and now we can do photosynthesis by sticking our tongue out beneath the sun to feed ourselves.  SCIENCE 100
No, it's not complicated. Kurzgesagt just doesnt want to trigger people. Meat is bad for the environment, even if you u buy the most eco friendly meat there is. Changing to a more plant based lifestyle would do the planet very good.
Wow, just wow, I spent 50 hours of research for an article I'm writing and you just make an amazing video on the subject. way better than everything I could ever write! I am both upset and amazed.
Would we be fine eating only 13% of the meat we currently eat? Personally, Id say yes. And I for one am willing to do so!  Removing meat is both pointless and way to big a demand! Especially because we are omnivors.  What we must do is argue for a reduction in meat consumption! Not removing it.
I've been debating limiting my beef consumption. This video has inspired to do that. Steaks are a treat and can be eaten every so often. Burgers can easily be replaced by better options, even chicken sandwiches, which are much better in regards to CO2 emissions.
Most of the grown crops used to feed cows can not be eaten by humans. So that part of the video is not representing the truth
Every single video from this channel is globalist propaganda. I WILL NEVER STOP EATING MEAT
0:03 Birds eating birds 😂
Seriously, you get paid by Bill Gates and all you can come up is avoidance? Why not mentioned a way we can still eat meat and solution to counter it? and not to demonize it? Propose a new technology to solve this problem? Why always repeating the same video over and over again? What is the Bill Gates money for? To promote avoidance? We do not need to be told meat is bad bla bla. What we need to know now is eating meat is bad and here is the solution to produce meat without causing green house effect. You have made this video many times. Can you guys be creative? Geez
Carbon budget is BS. There is no set amount allowed.
to be fair tho while it is true per 100g of protein in chicken costs more to manufacture than 100g of plant protein you cant really eat 100g of plant protein that easily. 400grams of chicken is easy to eat while the same amount of protein from something like brocolli would be 4kgs or 1.25kg of tofu which i dont think is really feasable to eat, especially in a single sitting
Me who doesn’t eat both lamb and steak: LETS GOOOO
Some fine and very subtle propaganda, as always. If food is 26% of the whole of emissions, how come we don't focus on the insane pollution of large industries and whatnot? The 4 biggest cruise ships in the world emit more than all of the cars in the entirety of Europe. Why must we look towards 'electrified tractors and trucks'(some Elon Musk battery shit), when we could instead look to free up land by doing hydroponics or aquaponics? And the video states that industrial livestock farms are somehow better than free-roaming animals. When those animals in those massive prisons called farms are constantly fed antibiotics to avoid diseases, which eventually leads to the potential of a super bacteria that can survive those antibiotics.  Whoever is driving this channel knows how to hide what they are actually saying behind all these pretty graphics. Take what you will from what I said. Just know that there's more going on beneath this channel than meets the eye. Just going vegan is not going to solve anything and this is just another distraction to what people really can do to stop climate disaster. Might be a bit too late for that regardless.
I wonder how the Amazon will look in 5 years
I have a question won't the animals still be alive if we switched to a vegan diet so wouldn't that still cause the same amount of emissions (loved the video btw ) Also what about fish ?
how not to mention also the antibiotic resistance that is spreading thanks to intensive farming 👌
This was actually really informative and describes perfectly well why a vegan diet would be best for the environment. Now the only thing that remains is to make people let go of their ego and stop feeding their hedonistic pleasures at the cost of our planet and our ethics. Sucks when most people on the planet are selfish and couldn't care less about the future.
They should just introduce CO2 tax already. I can buy a kilo of beef in the supermarket for 5 euro. Just make it more expensive... Force the choice, don't wait for people to make it willingly (won't happen anyway)
Do a video about insects based food and its benefits.
The ending part on the calendars didn't have any subtitles. I assume that was a last minute addition.
I missed you posting videos.
We are so boned as a species. It is a shame we will also take 90% of all life on Earth with us on the way.
You know a channel is quality when all the comments are just praising the video
from the video itself it seems we are screwed in 2050 no matter what we do.... even if everyone go vegan we will still not solve the problem we are only delaying it
I'll keep eating meat. Nice video.
The amount of lies in this video is off the charts. No mention of carbon sequestration. No mention of the grain that we feed to cows being byproduct (waste products) which would be produced anyway even in a vegan world. No mention of the methane emissions being steady for thousands of years. No mention of the environmental damage from all the pesticides that are needed to farm crops. No mention of desertification caused by intensive monocrop farming. No mention of how cows improve soil and make it more resistant to floods. No mention of how grasslands require ruminants anyway to thrive even if we stopped farming them. This video is pure big oil and vegan  propaganda. Nothing more, nothing less. Makes total sense why you released it after the dislikes were removed.
What about someone who exclusively hunts for their meat and eats wild game? I know this probably couldn't sustain the entire Earth's population, but would this see significantly less emissions per kg of meat for the individual?
Oh, I see. Now that the dislike button is disabled you are TRULY free to say what you think. Clever.
Just use a fire aspect 2 and looting 3 netherite sword
While it's truth that meat causes emissions I hate that peaple just blow shit out of proportion.
You are the best
What a great video. Here's another point in favour of plant alternatives: Most corpse meat we eat bears absolutely no aesthetic resemblance to any part of an animal carcass (think burgers, sausages, and nuggets for example). This is by design. People are kind of grossed out by the idea of eating corpses, so companies do their best to hide the familiar anatomical shapes that might put people off. This is an own-goal for the corpse meat industry, because plant matter is a universally better building material than corpses. So any shape you can make out of blended up corpse meat, you can make it easier and better out of blended up plant meat. And there's never accidentally a beak in your nuggets.
8:17 i like how it's an educational video, and then they just throw a meme in there.
lets invest in labgrown meat! especially for house pets, it would be so much better to feed cats with actual mice and bird meat instead of that bisquit bullshite we do now.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiples times everyday and never gets old."  👀
arguably, reducing the human population has to be the best way to reduce our carbon footprint
Real question if I ate every single tree on earth how much would I weigh
If I stop eating beef, it doesn't mean it will stop being produced
Watching this while eating a steak (๑•﹏•)
One thing that is mostly ignored in these debates is the price of the product: Look, the best thing for the climate would be to consume nothing. Dumping your monthly check onto a bank account doesn't hurt the climate, buying things will. The more you can buy from your paycheck, the more the climate will suffer. Thus, the best thing would be to make products more expensive. People will be able to consume less and this will benefit the climate. Saying that mass-produced meat is better for the climate is technically true, but not if you account for the low prices. In the end, it comes down to this logic: People won't buy a specific amount of things every month, they will rather just spend a specific amount of money. Making things more expensive will directly benefit the climate.
I'm going vegan now
Its almost like there is no such thing a free lunch. Either you accept that living in the pods and eating the bugs (Or some other form of absolute squalor), are the only acceptable state of living for the 99.9%, while the 0.1% live like kings, preaching and imposing the squalor on us, supposedly for our own good. Or you enjoy life, and accept that innovation will have carry us, pretty much like it has until this point.   Also being an advocate for nuclear power wouldn't hurt. Just saying.
Now you have from 25 to 30 days to upload final video in this year.
what about the bioavailability of animal protein synthesis compared to plant protein? this would improve meat's number on these charts.
🖕🏻 WE WONT EAT THE BUGS or SOY EVER 🖕🏻
ah yes, i love forcing dead animals to become part of my body
Food=\=parents love
I see the issue but I'm still eating meat
Very nice video still waiting for this entropy video tho
Eating beef while watching this video is truly a great experience now i want to eat more beef
So: Yes it matters. Cut down meat consumption/production by 70% and eat them when they only feed on unused grassland that aren't needed for endangered species of insects and so on.
HUE BRASIL CAMPEAO DO MUNDO EM FOGO POHA! Jokes aside, I wish my country would do a better work in stoping agriculture growth into Amazonia.
Short answer is yes. Too bad it won't stop the literal billions of human beings in the world to stop eating no matter how much you screech at 'em.
So basically, just stopping eating beef is already quite helpful
My proposition: BECOME CANNIBALISTIC.  We would solve a lot of problems in society, we would resole the fast-growing population, we would have more land, and reduce the overall human carbon footprint.
I'm here to learn about meat not bang my head to this fire music
Can we get the same depth of video on the veggie patty? for a one to one comparison.
good video, but probably won't change much :/. im willing to bet that the people who watch kurzgesagt videos already know this and that meat is pretty bad, and are fairly unwilling to change.
Recently I have seen a documentary on Netflix called Kiss the Earth, in it, it is proposed a solution for Global warmin based on using the soil propely, i think it would be nice to have a video based on this idea.
I m proud to be a vegetarian
So does veganism help the environment or not I don’t understand
Wait, so if we use beef to feed the cows instead of grass, we won't have to destroy the forest anymore!
I hope you safe to make a new video about everything’s;)
Does it even matter tho since we are getting lab grown meat?
We should get rid of volcanos too.  That would reduce greenhouse gases by an incredibly large amount.  I think we could put windmills on them too.
Been beef lamb and pork free for 3+ years now. It really ain't bad and I can recommend.
I love the end of part 2 because you tell us the facts and then give us not a real answer but ask questions like you don’t know. What is basically true because it’s also opinion based.
you forgot to mention plants cattle are eating is the waste product of plants we grow for ourselves like the stalks and the leafs of the plant we dont eat they dont grow more crops just to feed cattle
I'm so happy I have a much better picture now. You always get just a part of the data from someone who's pushing a propaganda. Kurzgesagt just wants you to be informed so you can make your own decision!
nice video to teach western countries
If you are not a farmer this information is useless.  Either tank a industry by making them go out of business.  Or eat plants while the meats are produced and wasted on autopilot.  You can't control nothing.  Because you don't produce meat.  Also if we stop buying meat the amount of cows will increase unless we neuter or straight up genocide them.  The basis is half-A only thinking about marginal numbers that may or may not be true because it's hard to actually get this data.  If cows is contributing to global warming so are we by existing.  We emitt green house gasses and live in a concrete jungle with no way to absorb CO2.
Me eating beef rn:
"Beef has a high nutrient density lets see how it compares" -> Only compares protein (which itself is made up of 20 key amino-acids) not any of the 40 odd micronutrients....  You can't look at 1 variable out of 60 and expect a useful outcome now can you. And that is before looking at bioavailibility, and nutrient form (K1/2, DHA/LA, iron/heme)  Considering how important the argument is, I don't see why people only look at protein and calories. They are important but beefs big selling point is how rich in things like iron/zinc, B12, etc. it is, yet they are not calculated in...
this upload made my day.
I love youre work i love it the animation is amazing.
It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.
Could we possibly solve the issue with synthetic meat?
Horrible video
Meat is murder. It's about ethics first.
in the first half I was thinking the video is only looking at CO² emissions, which would've been far from the complete picture. habitat destruction & segmentation, deforestation, desertification & ocean dead-zones are all greatly driven by animal agriculture and major factors in environmental destruction. animal agriculture does not just emit green-house gases, but also destroys the planets carbon sinks. and here, pastures are often even bigger culprits than factory farming.  it's also nice to see that they debunk the idea that "we couldn't use that land for something else anyways". while some pasture land may not be suitable for fields that grow human-edible foods directly, there's of course plenty of other environmentally important uses for it, such as actually leaving it as natural habitats for bio-diversity.  I don't agree that it is complicated at all. you simply have to look at the input and output of animal agriculture to see the obvious issue and understand that it is inherently unsustainable. it is extremely inefficient to channel our resources through the bodies of animals - generally large mammals - over a period of several years. the output is puny. as long as we have this inefficient middle-man for converting calories, there's very little room for optimization (and any optimization comes of course at the cost of even more horrendous conditions for the animals), while on the other hand, there's still massive room for optimization in animal-free agriculture.  without a doubt, animal agriculture at scale has no future if we are to achieve sustainability.
Released just around lunch time... Great...

A decent analysis, and I appreciate that you do not push. Merely lay things out. However, I will never, *ever* eat a soy/ tofu burger. It is not meat and never will be. While I am open to farming with different animals, I just find the concept of a veggie burger to be utterly repulsive.
Mate, eat your greens and it's all goody. More of a junkfood person? Already tonnes of vegan options. Not that big 'a deal anymore.
I wish food was enjoyable, I havent felt hunger since like 3rd grade
So yeah, keep eating beef.  Show those fucking Communists.
yes it is lol
Tldr; meat is bad, kill all cows
Dude i don't get it If beef just didn't exist or wasn't farmed I truly wouldn't lose anything only weight ofc.
LMAO just when i saw the vegan fiasco with mrbeast
As a South American, I should say it bothers me to some extent being on the spotlight when it comes to deforestation. I mean, I realize we have lots of work to do to improve in that aspect, but Europe also did an awful lot of deforestaion back when the cities started to grow larger and larger. My point is: South America must act against deforestation, but so must Europe and all other continents, which should include reviewing its own cities' development to claw back some of the lost original flora.
0:15 no i hate food. i wish i would only want to eat once a week
Is your being alive bad for climate? Perhaps you should just end it all …or realize that climate propaganda is ultimately based in nihilism
I was surprised you didn't talk about plant based meat...
I have a very good schedule Sunday: Chicken Monday: Veg and Fish Tuesday: Egg Wednesday: Veg Thursday: Veg Friday: Veg and Fish Saturday: Veg and Mutton(only twice a month) This has kept me very healthy I also eat fruits everyday
This is why vedic hindusim is the most superior religion.
CO2 tax solves everything

Spot the vegan
I'll stop eating beef when it goes away or my government starts seriously working on reducing carbon emissions. In the last 20 years we've shut down 7 nuclear power plants and built just one.
I’m wondering how marginal human related emissions are to pre-industrial natural emissions though. Simply measuring the emissions per cow does not take into account how (in North America at least) 2/3 of methane emissions are inherent to the naturally occurring ruminant herds native to the continent. Speaking on a geographical time scale, wouldn’t simply eliminating cattle eventually have diminishing returns as animals, like bison and elk, repopulate to their pre-industrial numbers? Certainly a reduction in beef consumption is necessary, but if the goal is emission reduction, would this mean beef isn’t as bad as the current measurements would suggest?
I eat a good amount of meat but t h there's so many good veggie options out there, just look up some tasty mushroom recipes and you'll get tons of different options. The big thing here is that you don't need to abandon meat entirely, just consider alternatives when you can!
Interesting video. I wouldn't mind a more direct comparison of pork and chicken with vegetarian diets in the latter part of the video, given that they're a staple in many diets. and a comparison between carbon emissions caused by the food industry vs other fields, for scale and context.
I thin we need to develop technology to capture methane produced by livestock for use in out energy and heating
I literally just don't care I will now eat twice as much beef.
I mean insects is technically meat that is better for the enviroment than plant based food
Yep, it’s good when it’s alive 🐔🐂🦧
Don't we eat a small part of for example a grain, cereal or wheat plant? So it's not surprising that a large part of crop production goes to feeding livestock. The alternative would be to compost the parts of the crops we don't eat. Unless we find some other good use for them.
Nice
i want a beef burger....well it is a good thing I dont really care and will order one
I eat only plant meat
Your mom
you know how it is, eat bugs, live in the pod. Don't enjoy life, suffer all the way up until the end! You know limit carbon emissions, so wild fires caused by negligence or natural disaster can make the last few decades of not doing shit pointless. Volcano's earth quakes? Bad weather? Ah no that'll all stop if you juuuust eat bugs, live in a pod, ride a bike all year round, even in the winter. You just gotta give up meat the masses. Blah blah blah. I hate this shit. Champagne socialists and Champagne environmentalists.
End humans and every problem related to environment would be solved
.
The problem I have with this topic, is that it shifts the problem to the commoneers. Yes, beef  has the biggest carbon footprint, and food alone accoutns for 25% of our current carbon consumption.... but why is the commoneers fault, when 3/4 of all the emmisions are produced by goverments and corps that do not care about emmisions, or care but won't do anything because of earnins and bonuses and money? And what about wasted food? and what about carbon being recycled (crops are made of carbon, as well as meat. This video accounts for carbon output but hasn't mentioned carbon input as part of beef/crops growns).  It's a very hot topic, and I love it being discussed. But "blaming" on meat consumers, when allll the meat in the world for alllll the population accounts for as little, compared to more destructive (and fixable) things in the world
What an emotional rollercoaster this was!
Cowspiracy is an amazing documentary available on Netflix on this topic
"800 billion tonnes of CO2 removed from the air over 100 years compared to 50 billion tonnes we emit per year." That's a dumb comparison. In 100 years we could emit 5 trillion tonnes at the same rate. Or forest land could remove only 8 billion tonnes per year. I don't see the point.
*feels uncomfortable watching something about not eating meat while eating meat
A bit more on why lamb is so inefficient: slaughtering an animal when it's not fully grown, on top of being even more ethically dubious than slaughtering adult animals, is incredibly inefficient as there isn't enough meat on its body yet to equal the amount of food that it's eaten.
Saw the thumbnail, clicked. Here we are <3
Go vegan! 🌱
"Beef stonks" had me on the floor for way too long
This video doesn't abide Betteridge's law.
Make the billionaires take trains and fuel efficient boats before we make everyone have to give up regular meat consumption.  I'm pretty sure the top 1% private air travel is three times as much as all of us eating meat. If you want a morally righteous act to help the climate destroy a private jet
Climate change is a hoax created by AL Gore because he lost the election to George Bush Jr. That's it. Stop trying to explain it. Our planet's climate is has changed a lot in the past millions of years with ice ages, mass extinctions. It feels like people are obsessed to be trendy, like the vegan and anti meat eating activism. I like to eat meat and steak. I would it steak every day, that's how good it is. I eat chicken, pork, turkey every week. I also like sausages with eggs every morning. This is my choice and I'm not yelling on the internet to say vegans are nuts because they don't want to eat meat. Guess why we don't use the appendices, because we don't have any use for eat, because we no longer have a exclusive vegan diet. Cheers and give me your arguments. I'm eating my Porc snit zel now.
i dont know how to pronounce tofu but i can tell this is the best ive ever heard someone pronounce tofu
Just an hour since uploaded and 200k views. This just shows us how great is this channel
Great vid! I always think about how local Italian Prosciutto or Swiss Cheeses are immeasurably better for the planet than all livestock factory produced goods.
You don't need to become a tree-huger vegan, just eat less meat! It already helps.
For me it simply doesn't matter, trying to somehow stop the consumption of meat is one of the most stupid ways to go about controlling the climate.
Fun fact: You can't make a hamburger in a lab.
I am not going to stop eating beef.  The planet will be fine.
8:16 haha beef stonks
Imagine what the emissions would be if all poor countries became developed and had plenty of food like the US, not to mention a full infrastructure.
This video is extremly dissapointing. Starts talking about the differences between meats and also speaks about Co2 / calorie. Suddenly ignores all of that and starts talking only about beefs and Co2/kg.  And suddenly ignore all previously said again just to say "there is data that says that vegetables produce less CO2 and need less farmlands and therefore less CO2 is produced". Well, I don't need a 12 min video just for that...  Due to the good begining, I expected more comparissons during the video, for example, see the difference between the best meat with average vegetables and fruits etc.
I'd like you to have a discussion on this with "What I've Learned".
GREATEST teacher back at it again
I refuse to go vegan until the rich as well as politicians are forced to do the same, as they'll just keep eating meat and create envornmental problems just to sell us the solution.
could u genetically engineer cows not to fart?
Lol don't care. Will keep eating meat, and if you try to stop me, I will fight you 🤗 being a vegetarian or a vegan because of global warming is for dorks.
Kurzgesagt, what would I do without you? Probably nothing, but let's pretend I'd die without you.
I think this is the last video of the year 2021. I wish you could have uploaded more awsome video per month but its always worth watching videos really you  give quality over quantity❤
Feels good that being a cheap f*ck and eating chicken all day can be good for the environment.
Would these next animals then go extinct? Or would we just leave natural herds alone
We will definitely need to reduce the amount of meat we eat.  Otherwise, the whole world will be screwed.
2:50 Yeah buddy, lightweight baby!
To be completely honest, and I am sure many can relate to this, meat and dairy are such a big part of my diet (for many reasons), that I am not willing to part with it, no matter how many facts and studies you throw at me about it's effects on health or enviorment.   That being said, I am not unreasonable and understand the fate that concerns us if we don't address climate change in general, not just meat production. I would be willing to switch to lab grown meat for that reason - which is more ethical and much more environmentally friendly, that is, if it can match the meat that I can buy today from the store in every aspect, without any exceptions.
I eat meat alternatives from time to time, I found pretty good ones, but the only issue is the price... I can't be expected to pay 2x-3x for an "alternative" to meat. Aren't plant products supposed to be cheaper? Animals eat that stuff so why is it so expensive?
Pog
Let's go vegan!
I heard about a study today saying cows could be trained as calf to do their business in a specific location, which results in far fewer greenhouse gas emissions. This would be something great to teach cows here in The Netherlands. At the moment the government has gone as far as reduced the speed limit on our highways because of the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted by livestock. At the same time, a vast majority of the products from this livestock is exported. We definitely need a new way of thinking and less selfish livestock farmers.
Maybe people could, you know, just stop having so many kids.  Then we don't have to live on bugs and grass or whatever.
Food
I would like it if everyone else stopped eating meat so I could go back to eating it regularly without feeling bad
I would like to see the fact that most of the crop products actually used for animal feed isn't useful as human food such as examples like soy bean hulls... distillers grains (a corn ethanol byproduct that would otherwise be waste) and the vast majority of animal feed.... some of it probably could be used for human food... but not nearly as much as many of these type of videos suggest.
love this new video keep it up
❤️
Everyone has a different opinion on this topic, one expert says something, the next one says something else and the numbers and "facts" they use are always wildly different. I dont even know what to believe anymore.
All these anti-meat narratives are just pushed by far more polluting industries. It's the same when oil corporations funded Greenpeace to go after nuclear reactors. Now we have lack of nuclear reactors and greenhouse gases are running rampant.
I’m literally giving a speech on this topic for a contest on Friday. Awesome to hear some stuff I didn’t know. I’m for sure gonna incorporate some facts from this into my argument
So we stop eating meat and the animals just disappear?  No.
Dislike
It's not that complicated. Animal farming contributes to more than 50% of all pollution and has several indirect consequences. If you want to eat meat then just shut up and eat it, but don't make up nonsense to justify your actions or make yourself feel good.
In conclusion, humans are a parasite. There's no 2 ways about this.  Our existence / thrival results in the detrement of the planet. I'm sorry to say this but the world is overpopulated.
What about the new lab grown meat? It is supposedly better for the environment than any other production means.
Nah human meat is still da best 💀
I somehow feel like you could've gone a little bit bolder with your ending statement than "you can decide for yourself what you make out of that lol anyways here's skillshare and merch"
Is food the best thing of being alive? Have you tried drugs, son? 😂😂😂
The factory farm scene made me feel sad.
Don't really care if you want to eat meats or vegetables, just remember this, demand for avocado destroy Mexico's pine forest and consider the damaging environmental impact of the wool industry. Everything has consequences for just existing.  We can't escape from consequences, what we can do is to shutdown greedy industrial activities like the wool industry or avocado farm industry, remember, *greedy industrial activities* not all of them. Good things if it is too much, will end up worse than the last.
Hello from russian vegans!
you guys always give us alot of great quality content and so many info in a simple way in wich everyone understand and not get lost and could change life yet it doesnt get to alot of people you guys even deserve more subscribers 17m even 25m btw when is the nuclear waste video coming?
We should all start eating more mushrooms.
you know what the biggest issue is about beef? we have way too many farms, while most meat gets thrown away. imagine if we stopped wasting food and by that didnt need as many animals, that way the emmission would go back too and so does the land we use. its obviously impossible to make a law or something for this, but we should really motivate people to stop wasting food and come up with ways to fix this issue. but another huge problem thats going on is agriculture dying out and being replaced for buildings. buildings are even worse then grassland with cows.   the solution isnt all of us going vegan, its to stop buying and producing as much, while we dont have even most of it! and besides, is it really needed to eat meat every day? no, it is not
A
Didnt you do a video about how the meet industry is ruining the world?
Congratulations on laying blame to Brazil. But how about the analysis on what Brazil would be like not being a 3rd world country? Brazil is currently unable to use a vast majority of its land due to the Amazon, and fake scientists who claim the Amazon produces 20% of the worlds oxygen as well as “prevents climate change” don’t pay attention to 2 things. 1. The Amazon uses most of the oxygen it produces, making it useless outside of “CO2 storage”. 2. 1st world countries can actually care about the environment. One of the many reasons Brazil remains a poor country is due to the Forrest they can’t cut down. If they were allowed to remove most of it they could actually pull themselves out of poverty. And let’s also not forget the fact that “climate change” itself is an intensely vague science. Originally it was global warming (it still is really) but it was changed because it was proven in scientific communities that the earth is not always warmer. Also anyone actually studying all aspects of climate change know that the margin of “change” is so low we can only barely say “the earth is getting hotter”. In the last 5 years the earths average temperature (a ridiculously difficult concept to calculate in and of itself) has risen like a degree or a few. Extend that number out to 50 to 60 years and the margin is not even 1 degree. That implies (using simple logic) that the earths temperature balances itself. Trees store CO2. Trees grow faster and larger in warmer climates. The earth gets warmer when CO2 is released. This implies that cutting down trees and increasing CO2 levels actually increases tree growth, ultimately reducing CO2 levels. The entire world works this way. It recycles material in order to make new material. The death scare of climate change is nothing more than a political talking point to allow the rich and powerful to scare you into letting them take control, to stop having kids, to keep 3rd world countries in poverty and not be contenders for the worlds wealth, and even to keep the wealthy countries in greater poverty (you see this in the United States gas and transportation crisis right now) Pretending that these are actual crisis issues is just feeding the elite the power to control the way we think and it prevents us from holding them accountable to their bad actions. The intense influx of lumber from the Amazon would also increase supply of lumber worldwide, reduce price of construction material, and even reduce the price of housing worldwide as it would be cheaper to produce. All around and in every direction the “climate change” argument does nothing but give more power and money to the elite, keeps the poor poorer, reduces current quality of life and lifestyle, polarizes people, and even convinces some that worldwide human population needs to be reduced. (Essentially calling for genocide with a few extra steps) That is what they want, and we all need to stop playing this silly game.
I would like to start a public debate   Motion = nonmeat food is better and should be banned  Proposition:  Meat harms animals and is bad for the environment
Well then.... maybe I should consider consuming more chicken and pork rather then beef
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel you failed to mention that apart from local shopping produce (which maybe doesn't have a very large impact), buying fresh and *seasonal* produce has a quite considerable impact, if I remember correctly. *Edit for clarification: I'm talking about plant-based produce.
09:20 800 Billion tons over 100 years against 50 billion tons annually
A few years ago scientists discovered a seaweed that when added to the food of cows cut the methane they emit by as much as 90%. In a bit shocked this video didn’t mention this as a possible solution in the future.
Methane harvesting from cows could dramatically offset their CO2 equivalent wouldn't it?
“Do with this information as you please” UMMM  I need an adult
Can't see the dislike button, but bound to be 0 Keep up the great work Kurzgesagt!
“There is no other bodily pleasure we get to enjoy multiple times a day and never gets old” Me, with a couple terabytes worth of porn tabs open: “You sure about that?”
2:19 love that the corners are food, you guys a very detailed now!
Before I watch the video, I want to make clear one thing: I will eat meat even if it kills me.   And now let’s watch the vid
Good to know, but when it comes down to it, I just don't care so long as I get beef tacos 🤷🏻‍♂️ and fake beef is too salty. Sorry-not-sorry, find another way to save our environment.
Imagine if instead of focusing on changing the food we focused on nuclear and investing into it, I know we are still far from it but they've made some pretty big strides recently and things are looking up
I have a solution what is the most co2 producing animal    Its humans so what if hear me out what if we      Kill all humans
Humans are not the only one eating meat. Pets like cats and dogs also eat meat. So if humans would stop eating meat we would still have meat production for cat and dog food and all the other animals that we have as pets that eat meat.
I haven’t eaten meat in over 20 years (I live in a place with plenty of alternatives available). This video has great visuals but I didn’t actually learn anything new. I’m hoping a video like this can be made, but with plant stuff central. What plant based food is wordt in termd of emissions. Should I buy local potatoes? Or avocados from Chili? Should I buy lentil based or soy based meat substitures?
Great to see informative, entertaining videos covering what we ought to be more aware of ❤️ 🙏
Forest fire aren’t that bad for the environment. I invite you to watch the video about the forest fires on the chanel « DirtyBiology » you will learn a lot and maybe you could talk about this subject in a video !
Beef stonks!
And what of people who live off there garden and hunting
<Youtube disables the the dislike button.> <Me: Worst choice ever.> <Kurzgesagt launches a video about meat eating.> <Me: Thank God there is no dislike button!
Super easy for me. Cheap high quality plant based proteins are wonderful. It's about ethics regardless of the biosystem. Plant based diet happens to be a benefit to the environment as a plus. The 2nd law of thermodynamics demands plant based and the ethics of plant based.
Kurzgesagt is kinda repeating the same topics over and over, please bring something new
I'm eating whatever is cheaper. So far, vegan food vs regular food is like 2x the price. So no thanks, vegans
Instructions unclear, ate raw beef. 3/10. Not bad.
Kurzgesagt: "Short answer - Yes. But we are afraid to offend, so... It's complicated." XD
"BRAZIL IS BURNING THE AMAZON"  That shit is burning for 500 years but if Globohomo corporate loses power there now it's a problem. XD
This made me hungry, but what to eat?
All CO2 we "produce" is taken from atmosphere! This is the truth about "climate change".
My contribution to the problem of the difficulty of changing our habits regarding food comes from the experience of losing the sense of taste as a symptom of covid. We should not separate pleasure from moral obligation (or practical urgency) on these issues, because in fact, pleasure, taste for food, and appetite (among many other emotional and other factors) are closely related. The fact of not feeling the taste of anything drastically lowers your appetite and even saddens you (imagine eating a cake and it feels like eating a sponge). Many people say that the worst thing about having covid is the loss of taste. How does this translate into action? Diversifying taste and making taste, social and emotional connections with other types of food, including the acts of cooking, sharing what is cooked, enjoying experimentation, giving our palate time to find new tastes. Etc. Unfortunately not everyone can change their habit so easily. In those cases, it must be done in a positive way for all aspects, and that it is not just a solitary task or a form of punishment. Thank you for reading.  Mi aporte a el problema de la dificultad de cambiar nuestros hábitos respecto a la comida, viene de la experiencia de perder el sentido del gusto como síntoma del covid. No deberíamos separar el placer de la obligación moral (o urgencia práctica) en estos temas, porque de hecho, el placer, el gusto por una comida y el apetito (entre muchos otros factores emocionales y otros más) están intimamente relacionados. El hecho de no sentir el gusto de nada te baja drásticamente el apetito y entristece incluso (imaginá comer una torta y que se sienta como comer una esponja). Muchas personas dicen que lo peor de tener covid radica en la perdida del gusto. ¿Cómo se traduce esto en una acción? Diversificando el gusto y haciendo conexiones gustativas, sociales y emocionales con otros tipos de comida, lo que incluyen los actos de cocinar, compartir lo cocinado, disfrutar la experimentación, dar tiempo a nuestro paladar a encontrar nuevos gustos. Etc. Por desgracia no todo el mundo puede cambiar de hábito tan facilmente. En esos caso hay que hacerlo de forma positiva para todos los aspectos, y que no sea solo una una tarea solitaria o una forma de castigo. Gracias por leer.
"Food is arguably the best thing of being alive". Truth. I once went to study abroad in a class with lots of international students, and it's funny how everyone agrees that the first thing they miss from their home country is the food. Not a location, not people, not music, but food.  I started to feel the loss on my 2nd-3rd week out of my 1 year study. It's pretty weird.
I greatly appreciate the tact used in this video to approach a delicate subject, but for the sake of furthering an important conversation I'd like to point out a few things that I feel are, respectfully, misrepresented in this video.    Firstly, I was very glad to see that pointed out just how powerful carbon sequestration can be. You mention the value of "restoring wild grasslands'', so I'd ask for anybody viewing to consider exactly how wild grasslands came to be in the first place. The North American Continent, for example, was not long ago a vibrant grassland ecosystem precisely because of the 50 million-plus buffalo that foraged here. Large grazing ruminants like cows don't WASTE more land (as stated at the end of the video), they RESTORE more land. This is the entire thrust behind the regenerative agriculture movement. Large herds of cows and other ruminants have already been used to restore millions of hectares of (non-arable), thanks to methods that mimic the natural grazing patterns of wild animals. When raised properly, large grazing animals aren't a drain on grasslands, they're an essential component of them. If you take issue with this claim, then you're left to defend the notion that ecosystems like those of the North American Continent around 11700 were so abundant IN SPITE of the ruminants that lived there, as opposed to because of them.   Second, with regard to methane emissions. If cows are such a large contributor to this issue, I'd like to ask: for how long has this been a problem? Cows and other methane-emitting animals have existed for millions of years, of course. So haven't they been putting methane into the atmosphere this whole time? Well, you say it yourself in the video: methane only stays in the atmosphere for about a decade. That means that the methane emitted from today's ruminants is effectively only replacing methane that was emitted from cows 10 years ago. Methane isn't simply deposited in the atmosphere, It's a cycle. And while it's true that atmospheric methane concentrations have increased, the number of grazing ruminants has decreased over the last several centuries. So why point the finger at cows when it's the other methane producing sources that have grown?   Thanks for the video, and I hope you don't mind my contribution to the (hopefully polite) conversation.
"Meat Love" gotta use this term more often!
The truth is: the amazon is being burnt down for mining but we just don't hear about it because the companies come from the countries that love pretending they're the greenest or something like that. The ground in the amazon is not fertile for us to be there planting for more than a couple years.
I like how USA blames developing countries like India and China for pollution and GW. Western countries are the largest beef eating population as they don't have enough farm land available. Exploiting developing countries for cheap labour and resources and also blaming them for emissions. China and India also increased green cover on earth as reported by NASA. What did other countries do? Nothing. While western countries munching on beef and turning keyboard warriors on iPhones produced out of child labour it isn't good to talk sh*t about others without backing up. Atleast acknowledge efforts of others who actually do than all talk.
But realistically speaking people will not stop eating meat. There's just no way plant based can compete with an omnivorous diet. If we just look at calories and nutrient per price then there 's no way a vegan diet will be cheaper. We're just privileged enough to chose a diet not based on price, we are not looking those who aren't fortunate enough to make these decisions.
IM ADDICTED TO KURZGESAGT
I've been vegan for almost a year now, so it really means a lot  to me when you make the effort to deliver objective facts supporting not eating meat, which are not loaded with ideology bullshit. Thanks again for the code, I also have ypur poster on my wall, love you guys, great work, greetings from Poland!
In other words. Meat in small amounts is not only sustainable climat and world wise, but also healthy. However, to muchmeat, and high demands for it like today, is not only unhealthy, but also unsustainable and highly damaging to climat and body in the long term!
So, essentially, meat IS bad for the climate, I did know that fact previous to watching but now I see the reasons.  I don't know what to do with this information though and I doubt anyone who wasn't vegan before watching would change their ways from this alone. I mean are vegan diets viable in terms of nutrients? if not, what kind of supplementation is needed, where would those supplements come from, and how would the production of the supplementary consumables affect the climate? From what I've seen the impact would probably be less than that of meat but maybe some other disadvantage comes with the production or our health (although meat is not very healthy either, red meat in particular). This focuses on the impact the sort of meat that is consumed as of now has, but what about the insect farming idea? So far the only disadvantage I've heard is the cultural adversion. They would also free up a lot of space we could use to reforestate (since they don't need much space to grow and don't eat as much before being ready to be eaten). Idk about their carbon (and methane??) emissions, probably less? Maybe the change from mammal to insect meat would also require nutritional supplements? I have no idea. The bigger problem is even if an unbelievably perfect solution came to be it's possible it would still not be applied. From the economical side of things, the bigger companies in meat production would snuff it out (kinda like what's happening with power plants, I think). From the social side of things, it's just too damn comfortable to keep doing the same shit we've been doing since we were born, even if it SUCKS.
The question of the video: “Is Meat Really Bad For The Climate?”  The answer to the video: Yes
Would stopping all human or freezing them reduce climate change? Like plants claiming our lands and less carbon there is on Earth 😶?
Thanos we'll need you 😭
No idea why diet is such a sensitive topic for people. Facts are facts.
You guys should make a video about regenerative farming it's really interesting and could have a huge impact on our climate
Well, I am allergic to dairy products and can't afford beef (also, should not eat it since cross allergy) so I am pretty good in this department.
Buying local may not effect climate change but if makes a big difference in local economies and local small farmers as well as food security of a nation and genetic diversity of crops.
Yeah there will always be emissions.  But the problem is that there is too much.
Even if people say meat is “bad for the environment” I’d still eat meat until  the day I die.   Don’t be pushed into the agenda of eating bugs and living in pods. For the sake of quote the “environment”
I would appreciate if you also mentioned whether that farmland is suitable for crops for human consumption. There are some crops that can only be used for animal feed and these don't always compete with human food crops for farmland  Edit: not to mention inedible byproducts of food crops that also get used for animal feed
There's some details you didn't touch here tho. Comparatively with other emissions, meat is not that relevant to climate change, even in the most utopian scenario where all Humanity becomes vegan (which is impossible for some people due to how their digestive system works) the carbon emission reduction wouldn't come to even 15%. Realistically, if most of humanity turns vegan, we would look at something between 3 and 8 % reduction, that's nothing compared to the carbon ratios of industrialization, transport, energy etc... Our diet is not the problem here
Por que esse vídeo não tem mais de 1 milhão de visualizações e uns 500 mil likes? O cara fez um cover perfeito de Unisonic!"
Beef stonks
my opinion: let vegans do their campaigns and such kfc and mcd arent going anywhere, cheers!
IT DOES GET OLD AND I'M TIRED OF IT
This still seems like an incredibly imbalanced coverage of the production of meat and its implications for net carbon emissions.  You sure are keen on emphasizing that plants can absorb carbon (9:35 graph), but completely ignore the fact that plant feed too absorbs carbon to facilitate the feeding of cattle etc. in the first place, you completely avoid making any complete life cycle/net carbon emission assessment of what it takes to produce x amount of meat (which is much much lower than the total carbon emissions giving people the wrong idea).  You do correctly state that transport accounts for very little of the total carbon emissions (which is the the only actual net contribution to the carbon contents in the atmosphere, as it relies on releasing long inert carbon into the atmosphere, unlike the carbon neutral cycle that is plants to animals repeat.)   There is still an increase to the steady state equilibrium resting average global temperate, for a giving amount of meat production, as it "upcycles" some carbon to methane (which is a stronger greenhouse gas, which is eventually broken down with a half life in the atmosphere of ~9.1 years), but this still deferrers importantly from the combustion of fossil fuels for power, as a static amount of fossil fuel based power will keep increasing the total carbon in the atmosphere, whereas a static amount/size of a cattle herd has a constant (not increasing) contribution.
Here I thought I could trust Kurzgesagt but I guess not, really makes you wonder about what else they might have lied to us about
i am sooo wanting a cheeseburger and steak right now.
Let's say we free up that 3 billion hectare for forests and grassland and let the wild animals populate it. In the US bizons, deer, wild horses and other animals were emitting about 85% of methane before Europeans colonizes the continent compared to today's beef and wildlife emission. So yes, we can save some methane emission, but it is not as huge as this video suggest.
Thanos was always right
As a farmer who groves full organic cattle. I know that we humans will never stop eat meat. But i'm always trying to make more climate friendly chooses to my farm. To changing my animals diet or what crops i'm planting. But most important thing to me is that my animals are happy as they can be!
WOOHOO YEAH BABY! THIS IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!
loveee uuuu
Hello
Nadima
Hey kurzgesagt, here's a question for you you to answer in your inevitable followup. What percentage of those cereals that livestock produces could have been used by humans? Also how much of the world's food waste is plant based versus meat based? Food for though. 😆
Love it! I could really benefit from a video explaining the relationship between gravity and time. You guys have the best way of explaining things in a way that makes things easy to learn.    Edit: ayyy thanks for all the likes and comments!
i was eating while watychng the video
Me being a vegetarian: interesting.....
Short answer. No. But maybe a little bit
Thank you. This is excellent!
Best  educational channel
N E W  V I D E O
I'm eating vegan patties + vegan sauce while watching it and it makes me feel like a good person.
Livestock in the amazon? what?!
One question that I'm thinking about is  What if we added bugs into our diet? How does it affect the industry and the climate?
Basically, veganism is actually ba good idea. We only have to wait for people to abandom their ego
This is all our responsibility. No government or company is going to make the change for us. If you truly care about the environment, eat less meat.
However, you can't be vegan and organic. Main sources of fertilizer for organic production are animal manure.
If it means I can't have my nuggies, then fuck the environment.    In all seriousness though, this is quite a predicament. There's gonna have to be a lot of delicate balancing between more meat produced and less of a carbon footprint.
What I dont understand is why we arent concentrating our farming. Build enclosed superstructures for growing, multiple levels with uv lighting running on solar/wind (because it wont require much energy). Depending how tall or how many levels we could make, we could significantly reduce the amount of land we need for crops. Even if we do it for easy to grow hearty plans like wheat, soy and corn
Personally, I follow a simple rule: Don't eat animals that you wouldn't kill. As I have killed a few chickens in my life and occasionally go fishing, this is where my food chain ends.
I've been eating less beef and more chicken for other reasons, good to know it helps the carbon footprint math that politicians claim to care about (even though their own actions show they themselves don't think it's actually a crisis.)
No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day... No further comment
Can you go on next NAtional Climate meetup and explain them whats going on? Maybe they will see how stupid they are and.. come back to made their businesses..   And those calendars, amazing <3
Going meat free is certainly a potential step in the right direction (although I'm a BIG meat eater). But would that not mean we would need more more land to grow enough crops to feed the world hence not freeing up as much land is stated in this video and increasing the carbon footprint of said crops? Also would increase the risk of famine resulting in more measures to protect the worlds food supplies and again potentially increasing the carbon footprint even more?
Excelente video, y eso que ni tocaron el tema de la cantidad de agua dulce que consumen los animales de ganado o qué porcentaje de lo que consumen después se transforma en tejidos (cerca de un 4%).  Al final, el futuro va a tener que ser vegano o nos vamos a extinguir en el camino.
Damn vegans
hear me out here: Kill 99% of the human population Win
Replacing your beef dish with poultry could be a step. Comming from someone who doesn't like much lamb & pork.  But I do love my steak with pepper sauce T_T. Mostly the sauce though.
Information given in this is very misleading... you didn't even talk about the methane cycle, or the fact that most of the agricultural crops that are fed to the animals, are not edible by humans, like the stalks of the plants. Edit: on your point of transportation, that is incredibly flawed the same sort of transportation is used for plants as well. That argument only works on coastal cities
On soy: it's important to consider there is sizeable crop waste that is used to feed cattle e.g. with soy, the inedible byproducts, or with corn husks, are sent and processed into cattle feed.
Everytime we talk about an issue with climate change or anything affecting Earth I keep thinking of this quote: "Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment; but you humans do not. Instead you multiply, and multiply, until every resource is consumed. ... There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern... a virus." Agent Smith - Matrix.
I don't want to hear about how I need to change what I eat from a billionaire with a company that dumps hundreds of times more emissions in a day than I will make in my entire life.  71% of all global emissions are the result 100 companies, most of those companies oil, gas, and coal producers. They refuse to make changes that would reduce their carbon footprints because it would hurt short-term profits (actually said by a representative of one company when interviewed on the study that claims the 71%).  If we taxed meat and made it so expensive it destroyed the meat industry, the same rich people lecturing us on meat would still be eating it. The people who would suffer most from this are farmers who would be forced to sell lands that I bet would be bought by the same emission-spewing companies and would profit massively by it.   Meat is a distraction, target the real problem.
moo man go brrr
Who else here is or is trying to go Vegan/Vegetarian?
you animation is so adorable that i forgot about the contents.
Drivel
So electric local transportation and chicken BBQ! I am in!
You calculations are 100% off seeing as you didn't equate for transporting from a shipyard to a local store.
If we transform crop and grazing land into wild grasslands and forests, wouldn't wild ruminants live there, emitting methane too? Something like 30 milion bisons lived in the US before the arrival of the europeans. So having 30 milions of cows should be considered carbon neutral. Or if not, we should also kill all the wild ruminants to fight climate change. Is there any error in this argument?
Finaly he understands!
Climate crisis is a hoax. Climate has been changing since earth has been around. 140 years and the average global temperature has risen by 1°C despite massive industrialisation and large scale wars. 24000 years of data shows that climate has been getting hotter regardless of human activities. And those who argue that the cause is us have zero evidence to show for it.   Climate has been changing since humans weren't around and it'll do so even when we are gone. These climate crisis alarmists are egotistical maniacs to think that humans being so insignificant in comparsion to the massive scale of the planet are somehow solely responsible for climate change.   It's even ludicrously suspicious how they never talk about Carbon capture and Artificial Photosynthesis as a viable technology to counter carbon emissions. Even when they do, they talk about how expensive they will be yet somehow forget that weather based energy production takes similar amount of cost in production as well as management.   Also the fact that in unfavorable weathers like in winter you end up using fossil fuels anyway. It's all a ploy to make nations invest in weather based energy production backed up by the global mafia called the CCP.
I’ll continue eating meat, thank you.
I'm disliking this video as a protest to YouTube, not because the video was bad.
Very interesting video, definitely puts things into perspective. Perhaps it would be worth making one as well about lab grown meats and how that could potentially impact the use of land for meat production and the resulting climate impact?
What would happen if we had two suns?
Food is food no cap detected
I'm watching this while eating Chick Fill A
And what about the large companies that do almost all of the pollution? Are they gonna stop eating meat?
I'm vegan
I love when they redo an already done topic and improve on it  This shows that knowledge has no end point
I loved this video, good job to your team. Can you please do a video dedicated to the effects of not eating meat or about vegetarianism and veganism.
Sooooooo, u basically saying, yes, being vegan or at least vegetarian do make some difference....well, I think I got something better to discuss with my family this Christmas tan politics!
i feel so privileged that i get to watch these for free
THats sus
Hey Kurzgesagt, is there a chance you could make your merch available via Amazon? The shipping fees internationally are a bit too tough to digest atm ><
5:00 does methane release from other animals contribute to climate change, or is it only cows?🐄💨
Getting sick of these damn climate vids. We get it, the earth will be a wasteland for my great grandchildren when I'm dust in the grave. It doesn't affect me, so I don't care, get back to actually making interesting videos for once.
Imma eat more fish now
Hang on though, food that is shipped from the other side of the world still need to be shipped that last mile, you can't just compare the transatlantic shipment to the local one.. also i think the argument would be stronger if you don't ignore that people who stop eating meat would eat other things instead, so it's not like the climate footprint of meat would just disappear, it would be replaced by other things, like greenhouse farmed vegetables.. it doesn't take production yield or processing in to account either really  While this video does try a to be a bit fair it still falls short in that department. (Like you even state that you focus on beef because it's the "biggest offender" ie supports your agrument)  Sure meat has an environmental impact but so does all food production, and there is alot that can be done to minimize it. Simply "going vegan" is not enough
Im gonna eat that beef until we all are doomed, espicially those billioneirs who are not doing a shit about it
I think I hit on all the points except for transportation? I currently have a Patent Pending status before the USPTO, to transform the way meat is made that: Dramatically reduces G.H. gases ON TWO FRONTS, is useful for all ruminants, it can be scaled to any size of production, it provides a faster birth-to-slaughter time, the meat tastes BETTER than any commercially available beef, it frees up soy to be processed for human consumption and IT SAVE A LOT OF MONEY, for everyone involved, during the whole process! I´ve been doing this for the last 7 years.
I'm I the only one watching this video while eating a T-bone ?
I love Kurzgesagt.
Are they saying then that cargo ships are not that much of a polluter? Because, I have recently learned otherwise
honestly, what do we do about this? Move everybody into kowoloon walled city and have them eat bacterial monoculture?
The opening sentence is wrong! The best thing in life is to crush your enemies, see them driven before you and hear the lamentation of their women.
Whether it's bad or good for the climate, you should go vegan regardless.
This subject is too complicated for Kurzgesagt and therefore shouldn't be made into a video.
It's hard to intersect some things said in this video without the raw data. Cause on one hand meat seems to be much more calorie-packed food, on the other hand it needs plant calories to grow.  My question is - how realistic is to eliminate all meat production and still feed people? Would we have to have more farms growing plants, even after adjusting for all the plants that we currently feed to animals? Keeping in mind that there's only so much wheat and soy we can eat, compared to animals, so there would have to be more diversification of land for farming purposes.
Every video that comes out is ALWAYS so Educational!😄👍
I feel like this ignores a crucial point. The problem isn't just greenhouse gas emissions. It's extra greenhouse gas emissions. Animals producing methane and CO2 is normal and they've been doing that for over half a billion years. Raising animals for meat doesn't actually create more animals or more greenhouse gas emissions, because we prevent other animals from using that land. Killing off a bunch of other animals.  Which isn't to say that's any better. It's definitely also destructive to the environment. But it is destructive in a different way. We're not creating more animals, just changing the composition of the planet's animal population to be more "useful" to us. And thus, we're not increasing greenhouse gases by raising animals. If not for cows, other animals would be burping and farting instead. So, it's really just the transportation, processing, and storage that is a concern as far as I can see, and that can all be taken care of by switching to green electric energy sources.  Then, there's also the option of lab grown meat which hopefully isn't too far off.
This is why im vegan
too bad you didn't really mention alternatives like plant-based meat, and meat from cells
Reasonable again!
this video might be convincing for some people, but I don’t think I can live without meat
Misleading comparison at 9:34. Comparing absorption over 100 years to emissions over 1.
I came uneducated and now I feel myself being educated im buying any product you guys sell for now on
Fuck it, more beef. Gimme more meat. M e a t
Vegan propaganda LULE  If Forsen read this V1 ZULUL
yes
If meat is bad for the environment then the environment deserves to be destroyed.
just an experiment, use me as a dislike button.
Such splendid propaganda
I realize it's only been an hour, but this is the first video I've ever seen without a single dislike.   If only we could feed the world kurzgesagt, 100% satisfaction, minimal bird sacrifices  Edit: Kurzgesagt should make a video on the stifling of our ability to show our negative emotions. Because now I'm upset, and I blame cows.
I would like to point out some flaws. Firstly, in the second comparison, they used shipping avocados, a fruit to compare shipping beef, a high carbon footprint meat, locally. Thats an apples to oranges comparison. Secondly, the climate talk is focusing so heavily on issues on the western world, we forget that China, India, and many other countries in the eastern world are very heavy polluters.
If the only way to save the planet is me stop eating meat then the planet can go ahead and die. Cant stand 99% of vegetables.
Wow no dislikes
My family eats beef once a week or so. Otherwise it's poultry and fish occasional meatless meal. Even with this info we aren't gonna stop. I'd rather try and focus our efforts on fusion power that would make a larger impact.
The problem with vegan and vegetarian diets is that they need supplements to stay healthy after long periods of time and not everyone knows or are able to afford a nutritionist
Kurzgesagt shouldnt worry, they are just birds
10:09  Yes, im gonna completely ignore it ;) Great vid btw
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old" may i introduce you to fifty billion hilarious and original jokes in the comment section
Ban meat, is something Americans will never do. Maybe Lab Grown meat will be us carnivores' saver.
Kurzgesagt! You should do a deep dive into mushrooms. I feel they can be key to helping us as a species
"but no bias thought"
At the time of this posting, this video has 25K upvotes and 572 downvotes. This has been your anti-dislike-removal service and have a nice day.
Until China lowers theirs emissions - I'm not gonna do squat to my own carbon footprint.
Meat is bad because shitting on it is good
I'm always amazed by how well you animate everything, I'm not an artist but I'm really curious about animation.  This is a very controversial topic, but the truth of the matter is, land ownership and uses is one of the biggest issues in the planet right now, governments should be more proactive and regulate them. But bribes seem to be too high.
Wouldn't it be reasonable to try to attach some kind of air filtering system to all factory farms. One that could recycle the methane and use it as gas fuel. Wouldn't that help the operations become more ecologically sustainable while offering financial incentive to impliment?
How much carbon does fish emitted
0:40 THAT COW IS SO CUTEEEE
Id like to remember that "we" does not exist. All that land is private property. We dont  decide anything. The owner does
So, the moral of the story is, "Eat mor chikin"? Also, why no information on lab-grown meat?
Great video! If you ever do a follow-up in the future, I'd love to see a price & cost analysis (esp. in relation to the graph at 2:56). Keep up the good work! :)
i don't care they removed the dislike button ,  Everytime  I see the new video on my screen i give it a like before watching it cuz i know it's gonna be great .
How does the rain forest burn if rains every single day there ?
Me who watching video while eating the dinner.
Do what you want but if I can’t eat meat I will start a war
I'm in love with the passive aggressiveness of the last sentence "you can decide for yourself what to do with this information."
I left this video with depression...  Thanks for the video <3.
I will legitimately never stop eating meat. However I have general disdain for beef pork chicken lamb. I enjoy venison, game bird, and fish. I grew up in the american northwest so to that extent, I had the creme of the crop for hunting and fishing.
This is half of why I'm trying to eat less meat. The other half is to try and lower my cholesterol.
Wow i'm kind of early
Except the emissions from beef dont contribute to overall levels as they are part of a closed cycle. I thought you would have at least mentioned this.
I am sorry but after watching the video of "What I have learned" I could not believe your videos on this topic
What if we somehow managed to build a technology to collect all that carbon pollutant from the air and make it useful lol or maybe 4 dimensional space so that all of the humanity can live in a much smaller area and reset of the planet could be used to plant more tree's to eliminate pollutants. Because if we don't find a way now then it might be too late, not to mention a 3rd world war will decrease the life expectancy of entire human race.
So are you telling me that Vegans are right?
What the F*** does meat have to do with the climate
The thumbnail cow's name is Meat. Everyone loves Meat.
iunno
Another masterpiece by Kurzgesagt! Beautifullly covered the sensitive topic with a great summary at the end. Loved it!
Wait did I saw Cooked chicken at the beggining next to the Alive chickens
Meat eaters in shambles 😂. And this video doesn't even point out the moral issues of causing great suffering to billions of animals every year.
Yall should do an episode on oxygen producing organisms in the oceans. In my opinion, 2 major things need to be addressed. Firstly, regulations need to be enforced in the Far East to limit their CO2 and Methane production as a byproduct of their super fast growing industrial sector. Secondly, it needs to be a worldwide movement to fully clearing our oceans and supporting life, specifically for oxygen producing organisms. These organisms by far outmatch the production by land based ones. If we can foster a more economically friendly culture, especially being conscious of our waste, we can help the world in not only recovering, but also fostering a world that can produce more life and support for said life.
It's good for my body
fat boomers in the comment: i buy more meat
Time to disable the adblocker
Nah. The real problem is not meat nor any type of food. It's human overpopulation.
I guess we can ignore the missing of the dislike button on this channel xD
steak still tastes good so i know what im doing
Free idea for an episode. The summer of 1816, otherwise known as 'The Year Without a Summer'' when a supervolcano in Indonesia erupted and sent the northern hemisphere into a volcanic winter. North America, Europe and much of Asia reported snowfall in July. Crops were ruined and widespread famin caused panic leading many to believe the world was ending. Although the worst of it occured during 1816 the effects didn't really fully go away for over 50 years. It's a forgotten event that is both historically and scientifically interesting
sTONKS
What about lab grown meat
*beef stonks*
Great video
nah not buying it
Yes but chopping down forests for farmland is a huge problem for all the animals that originally lived in it. If vegetarians were serious about their dedication to minimizing their footprint, they would convert their property into a personal garden instead of relying on corporate to destroy forests and natural habitat for their virtuous signaling. Live what you preach or nobody gunna take u seriously.
Did anyone see the cooked helper t-cell
The whole video parts from the false premise that CO2 is bad for Earth or life on Earth... Higher Co2 increases green areas, forests, fauna, fertile land, it even allows plants to survive in arid zones that wouldn't if CO2 levels were lower.
Isn’t it the keeping of the cows that’s bad? Like the massive farms (he might’ve mentioned this idk I haven’t seen the video yet)
Sad thing is since America won the culture victory, healthy and helpful for climate "Mediterranean diet" is disapperaing even in Mediterranean world. In a same manner Europeans started to drive SUV.
What if I told you, I don't care.
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure..." What a disgusting hedonistic sentiment. How sad and meaningless the lives of materialists.
"considerably less than a veggie patty" is that true? vegetables, sure, but most veggie meat substitutes that aren't super rudimentary use a LOT of extra water and energy. there's a reason they're so much more expensive than meat
That would be super great to quantify the impact of artificial meat with all the bioreactor and things!!
So uf we stop eating beef we can see less co2. But what would happen to the overpopulation of cows and the increase of Methane emissions? Wouldn't we need to cull cows in the end anyway?
If there's cheap beef I'm going to buy it. If beef becomes more expensive, I'm going to save up and have it as a treat. Switching to vegan alternatives is pretty much only viable if you're middle class.
This is such a small part of the Vegan argument, but it does touch on the fact that there is zero reason besides taste (which in more and more cases becomes irrelevant becouse Vegan food is getting better by the day and would get better faster of there were more demand) and convenience (social situations) to eat meat.  How do you justify torturing a wast majority of these animals, and killing all of them against their will, just to be able to have a slightly more convenient and tasty meal?   Thirld world countries might not be thete yet, but most of civilised world has no excuse.  The fact we would drastically change our carbon footprint is just a cherry on top (if half of the people in the world went Vegan, it would be the equivalent of ALL the poeple in the world stopping the use of all cars, planes, ships or any other carbon emitting means of transportation).  Go Vegan, do the right thing
'No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old' Well...
I just wish that artificial meat like impossible and beyond burgers were as good or better than real stuff but every time I try them they just don’t do it for me. I feel bad for eating normal meat but it’s SO GOOD
How about fish?
nice
Ok now I’m curious. Where does fish fall in with CO2 emissions
Do a video about is a person born smart or does he just work hard
I feel like there needs to be a follow up on how healthy vegan and vegetarian alternatives to meat are. Right now things like the impossible burger are actually really bad for you because they have a lot more bad cholesterol and other elements in them. People like eating meat and there appear to be very few true alternatives to meat and even less healthy options.
what about lab meat?
I love your channel so much! ♥️♥️♥️
i loved it can you also do fish
This is really gonna change the way I meal prep.
Just remember, if climatologists numbers are correct about the human race's contribution to the climate, and that this contribution is directly altering the trajectory of natural climate change, then there is just about nothing you could, or an entire nation, could do to change it short of a nuclear war.
With this information, I shall continue to eat meat. The world should burn if I can't eat my bbq lamb chops.
To be sincerely speaking in my humble opinion without being sentimental and of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my opinion but rather looking into this serious matter with perspective distinction and without condemning anyone's point of view, I honestly think and believe that I have nothing to say. Thank you
Could we maybe get an update on how meat printing is going for the best alternative or even insects as our main food source.
I haven't cut all meats, but i've cut down on eating a lot of meat, and have been eating more greens. It's like the whole scientific thing about how the President Climate change plan would limit people down to 3lbs of meat per month or so doesn't really sound all that bad, sure beef prices would crash and some farmers would cry about not making money but consumerism is getting out of control when it comes to purchasing food.
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times during the day and never gets old." sex?
Come here in india .especially in up   And try to eat beef ,soon you will be in jail ....... Cause we do not take a life for our taste. Thank you 💀
Vegan teacher is gonna give you a lot of check marks after watching this video😂😂
Please just reduce your meat consumption by swapping some plant based meals in your diet.
Biden needs to watch this if his deteriorating attention span can handle it
I love how they try to combat climate change but dont realize china, india and africa wont change their emissions so even if we did 0 emissions in the usa and Europe it doesnt matter.
I gonna still eating meat, and someday Illl taste plant based 'burgers"
Install an everburning lighter on each cow, to prevent methane emissions.
Just ask yourself why to kill a living being with senses for the sake of satisfying our taste buds?  Isn't that evil in the first place even if beef and pork didn't create emissions?
Just enjoy the life and let it to god
You need meat, no matter who you are, or what your argument is, you can't survive without meat. Whether it be proteins that come from meat or different nutrients, the only way to get them is meat. We can definitely cut down on the amount of meat we eat, but we can't  eradicate meat eating, it's impossible.
I would like to see them making a video about the importance of sleep
god damn youtube removing dislikes
I watched this after looking up the Alex bale ARG. I have regrets.
People on specific diets like Keto can't just forgo dairy and meat, it's a huge part of our diet and where we get alot of our essential fats and protein from, unless there is a stable alternative to dairy that is high fat, we can't just switch it off.
Meat is tasty, especially when it's attached to a human
Its always the middle class and the poor that are expected to sacrifice their standard of living to fight some virtuou signaling elitest cause...that can never be solved completely..and thus we will continually be told "you cant have that anymore", forever.  When are *you* going to sacrifice anything? How about the climate footprint of that new iPhone 30, or the big house, $100k car electric or not, private planes, vacation resorts, everything people in the higher class enjoy....I'll be waiting for *those* videos on *their* climate footprint next. 👌🏻
Save cows!!!
What about lab grown meats? This is not a full discussion without discussing this as well.
Maybe people should now realise that going vegetarian will save both the environment and also lives of those innocent animals.
Get ready for some "I'll watch this while I'm eating my steak" comments
If everyone just ate pizza everything would be so much better 🍕
I'm actually okay with reducing my meat intake if there are easy to find plants that are high in fat and protein but low in carbs.
This video is misleading on many levels. Let's see why (wall of text alert)  1- we need food to live so we could be the problem, not the food. But erase ourselves is not a solution, it's just nihilistic thinking. 2- changing to veggies is a false solution. You don't just stop meat and eat another thing because the nutrition is different. Meat is what made human brain superior. When agriculture became a good food source, humans still risked themselves to find meat because the benefits are worth the risk. Also, the land and the problems meat causes have a huge economic impact. If it exists an equivalent nutritious substitute with less real estate use and money spending, we've had already found it. 3- if "elites' profit" is an argument, it's "the elites" that are trying to stop us from eating it. Anyway, only poor people would stop consuming meat even if it becomes law. Do you really think that the very rich will stop it? They don't even follow mask mandates around themselves.  5- insects are not a solution. If they were, asian countries like China would stop consuming meat looking for the economic challenges. They eat bugs for centuries. 6- the video itself pointed out that transportation and oil emissions are not a problem on the food chain, which will guide us to the elephant in the room: climate change is caused by the energy industry, which uses mostly oil, gas, coal and others. So: 7- Even if we reduce meat consumption by 90%, the environmental impact would be less than 20% overall. That means we could make the entire world change its diet forever, climate change will still be a huge problem. That means meat is not really the problem here. 8-  (see 2) if meat is really so important to our diets to the point that we became smart (like, not animals) because of it, removing it will not only NOT solve the problem at all, we could still become less intelligent, therefore less capable to make the world better because we're risking to lose brain power. And if you assume (3) has a chance to be true, then don't be s1up1d.  We don't have a meat problem.
Beef stonkes
Excellent video.  I was aware that beef is the worst, which is why when I became an adult I switched to primarily chicken, but not by how much.  I wonder how efficient vat cloning beef might be or become?  (Not that people would buy vat meat, probably.  Which is a shame. I'm not one of the people who believe it's the animal slaughter that gives meat its taste - meat without an animal sounds good to me.)
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have your pudding!
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times per day and never gets old." Masturbation comes to mind.
It all comes down to too many humans. Team Thanos.
so wait, the addition of the 3 billion hectares = 800 billion tones over 100 years, so thats 8 billion tones/year CO2 removed and we emit 50billion/year,  so this helped how?
Factory farming   minecraft video??
Gotta be very careful when saying about land that can be used to grow forests. It is very misleading to false hope as most new forests are also major carbon _emitters_ for their first 10, 20 years. And we don't have that time.  They only store more carbon than emitted when they're lush and tall, and not growing much anymore. Preserving standing forests is extremely more important.
So the vegans were right all along
grass fed only means less beef? good. The meat will actually be better in quality and having a steak becomes more special again.
Kurzgesagt videos are the only ones I hit the like button before the ''play'' one.
I'm making a fob with a button and a speaker such that when I pressed it, it say's "well, it's complicated", and I wanted to use this voiceover, so I was wondering if I can sample the "well, It's complicated" from different videos to play... all my friends get the joke because we all watch your videos, and currently I'm playing it from my phone, and I have a link to a timestamp to one of your previous videos with the exact timing to get the phrase, but having a fob would make it so much funnier... let me know!
Shame on you guys for promoting a free trial to 'the first 1000 people' that requires credit card data.  £120/$150 annual payment is taken and I'm sure there will be people that forget. Love your channel but not your sponsor.

I wish there was a name for eating in a sustainable way. I used to be a huge meat-eater (the kind of guy to get the extra meaty with extra cheese pizza) and I went vegan earlier this year to reduce my climate impact. What I wish existed was a name/clear diet for sustainable eating. Being vegan is great for reducing your climate impact, but avocado's are awful for local environments so I don't eat them... which can be difficult to explain when there isn't a diet or name for sustainable eating... other than sustainable eating, which is pretty abstract
If you reduce beef to only the small percentage. Only the rich will eat beef in the future.
We can't start another potatoes war
but then again some people in some poor countrys can't actually afford to be picky about food, so i think that affects this topic too
Can we get a peer review study on White Oaks Pasture already? They claim to have a net negative greenhouse emission with their grass fed beef and it looks very promising. They have universities looking into this but would be very interesting to see the solution be "the problem". It would be interesting to go to the grocery store and grab beef as the best protein source for the environment lol
will go vegan!
Nice vid boss
Finally, you stopped avoiding this topic. Too bad human life on this planet is still doomed.
Still gona stick to eating meat.
What happened to the original upload?
Isnt that the world average of co2 emissions doesnt matter?  Also, in like 85% (just made that up if you couldnt tell) of the Co2 that's damaging the climate coming from fossil fuels that dont have a life cycle, not food co2 emissions.
Its important to mention that we are EXTREMELY overconsuming meat, and beyond that, we are wasting ridiculous amounts of meat. Of all meat consumed, we waste about 20-25%, and thats mostly on the consumer level. Thats the meat you bought, but didn't ate. That's the hamburgers in fast food chains thrown out, cos they overproduce every day to meet the demand for a burger served in less than a minute.  If we just cut our meat consumption by half, we would still eat a lot of meat, just maybe not every day, or less every day. That would benefit our health and the environment.  We don't need to go vegan to make a meaningful change. Eating more healthy would already change a lot.
In short, the meat itself, no. But making it, and it's excessive production, yes. Made by a Mediterranean diet enjoyer.
So basically the rich made the mistake of polluting the earth and the poor should pay with their food? Everyone knows that meat is the most efficient and cheapest way to get nutrients vegan food is way more expensive if people start rejecting meat less farms would produce it which would make it even more expensive overall this would make food way more expensive than it is some privileged people think they are wiser by rejecting meat but we should look for other problem like big corporations, factories and energy sources.
This is interesting
The animals who suffer the most are the ones who emit the less.  That's a terrible truth and I hate it.
Wait, methane is a fuel, don't farms use it as fuel?  Also, don't wild bovine (ei bison, wildebeest, buffalo) produce this gas too? Surely there's more to this as nature was healthy with cows around anyways. Like, there's more cows now, but still.
And let's remember the US military emits more than 140 countries combined and 100 corporations are responsible for 70 percent of emissions. Blaming individuals for climate change reeks of Libertarian Neoliberal ideology
There's another bodily function you can do multiple times a day every day 😏
I'm not ready to stop consuming beef.  I do eat it less frequently than chicken or pork when I can.  Eating meat no more than once a day is another decision I can make.    Can't wait to see better beef substitutes, be it lab grown meat or vegetable alternatives.
Walking my dog and found a mostly  edible turkey next to the garbage.  I drove back and bagged the bird for my bully.
Cows are part of the carbon cycle. Also, humans will always need cows for fertilizer, especially if people want "organic" foods.
I've been trying to cut down on meat these past 2 years, there are some really nice vegitarian dishes out there, and it makes meat more special when I have it :)  If you haven't tried it, Halloumi is fantastic! And baked potato? don't get me started... Man i'm hungry.
I feel like an argument that could be dealt with in a future video, for completeness' sake, is what percentage of the current cattle etc. production could be sustained with the byproduct of a crop production system wherein no consumable crops are destined for animal upkeep. Discussing the repercussions this would have on prices, jobs, which crops would be produced less and what they could be replaced with etc. would also be very informative!
What is the worst plant? Cant see it being named anywhere
NOT THE BEEF STONKS
Topped in video quality again. But I don't know how people will receive such controversial theme.
Btw, if you don't buy beef in the store, you changed nothing, it will still be there on the shelf and new ones will be there tomorrow
hmm i like the new style for the birds (:
I'll think about it while I'm cutting up my scrumptious sirloin steak. Oh yeah........
Loving these percentages. % is everything!
Dislike... but everyone else please like. Less competition for better cuts at the store.
so ... chiken ?
If you guys didn't know we would be existence 🤣 if we didn't eat meat because if we eat some plant we will die because we didn't have a Brain back then
Brazil? What?? That's completely untrue!
How does food waste factor in? Almost half our food is just thrown away without eating it.   Also there is something in here that I think is misrepresented. A big part of soy that is fed to cattle is the part of the plant we cant digest, along with the bean.
moral: we are too many for this planet
This is so depressing. We are screwed, but with superb animation thanks to Kurgesagt. 😥
As a researcher in Ag I think it would have been relevant to discuss the issues with life cycle assessments and the need to look at net changes in emissions. Almost every number in this video is someone's best guess. I won't say they are reliable enough to be an estimate even. It would not be surprising if they were ten times higher or lower than calculated.
i like the memer man reference
You really are just one decision away. I used to think I couldn't change my diet, until one day I had enough. I was watching a video not unlike this one actually. So i decided to stop eating animals and I've had no problem doing it for over 4 years now. If you've been thinking about going vegetarian or vegan but fear that you can't do it, I'm here to tell that you'll figure it out. You can take that step today.
Thanos was right ...
At this point, it's better to find ways to remove CO2 from the environment instead of stopping it. That 26% of food emissions will stay because we need to eat xD
I say we just use lab grown meat
Being vegetarian is like eating respiratory plants that sucks CO2 and releases oxygen. How about that climate change.?
Yes.
So takeaway: strongly consider a whole food plant based diet.
I have a few questions:  1. If we cut the meat production by 100%, does that free up 100% of the land currently being used by meat production? As stated in the beginning of the video, meat is one of the most nutrient dense foods. If we want to replace that source of nutrients with plant based alternatives, we need to increase the production of plant based alternatives by A LOT, right? What kind of resources will that require?  2. Animals eat a lot of food that humans can't consume for nutrients, right? I.e left-overs from what humans produced but weren't able to consume for themselves. Is there something else we can use that food for? Or will it just go to waste?  3. There is a statement here that we have significantly more methane in the atmosphere now than we did a century ago (or some time period back). At what rate has the population of cows grown over the past few decades?  4. In a previous video by Kurzgesagt, "Can YOU Fix The Climate?", Kurzgesagt stated "The concept of your personal carbon footprint was popularized by the oil producer BP in a 2005 ad campaign. Argubly one of the most effective and sinister pieces of propaganda that still seriously distracts all of us from the reality of the situation".   In that same video stating, in the context of making a change for the climate, "Even the most motivated person can't even make a tiny dent [by changing their lifestyle]". Then in this video stating "You can decide for youself what you want to do with this information", implying that you should change your lifestyle? Is it strange to judge those two statements, or ideas, to be inconsistent?   Sorry if this comes across as negative, I just want to ask questions and broaden my perspective on the whole climate situation.
As with anything else, if you moralize it, you will be ignored and fought against. The truth is skewed by those who panic around this topic.  I wouldn't mind paying a little more for rotation meat, however if you want a unified front against meat consumption, I will literally fight you on this.  Democracy means that all groups are heard and we find solutions together, it doesn't mean majority rule, so that's why I'm willing to compromise, but it has to be according to the ideals of liberty.
that's funny, i have a slideshow to finish about this exact subject for today
It also depends on what kind of "meat" you are talking about 😏
Pray for Brazil.
You guys can start eating your bugs. I'm going to keep enjoying my steak.
My continent (North America) use to be full of large herbivores like bison, elk, bighorn sheep, caribou, moose, and so on. These so called science videos with clear agendas never seem to factor that in.  So did bison farts pre industrial revolution not count, are we going to count it in the future and other natural sources of emissions. Its because this show is made in western Europe by people who don't understand what real nature and wildlife looks like. So they think by removing a pasture of cows nothing but carbon sucking trees will replace them. When if it were really returned to its natural state the cows would just be replaced by aurochs.
What about lab grown meat?
Ayo vegan gang wya😤
What I've Learned would like to have a debate on this lol.
Hey yoo love from BD 🇧🇩
Talk about ripping out my heart and stomping on it just to make me feel bad.
your thumbnail disturbs me
STEAK. STEAK. PRIME RIB. PRIME RIB.  or eat salad to make hippies happy. and people who don't realize the climate has been changed so many times.  And life is still here.  THE CLIMATE HAS CHANGED MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT HUMAN CIVILIZATION. LET ALONE HOMOSAPIEN AND ALL OTHER OF THE HUMANOID SPECIES. BEING ON THIS PLANET.
Dislike
The big problem I see is that people are either in the camp of “no go to hell” or “get ride of all of it not matter what they want”. There seems to be no middle ground and honestly food is one of those things you shouldn’t touch or concentrate on it later. Focus on renewable energy and better batteries right now so we can last longer.
the fruit from the freighters would still have to be brought to the supermarkets via trucks
I do not disagree with what is said in this video.  I'm uncomfortable with what was left unsaid.  There are factors that need to be addressed if we stop farming meat and only focus on plants.  - Modern agriculture uses pesticides that are bad for the land, wildlife and you.  Organic methods cannot produce enough food to feed billions of people. - Fertilizer has to come from somewhere.  If you eliminate the population of farm animals that will increase strip mining. - What is going to happen to the species that humans domesticated?  They cannot live in the wild.  Extinction is normally thought of as a bad thing.
Has Kurzgesagt not heard of regenerative farming and capturing carbon in soils through practices like intensive rotational grazing of livestock. We can literally offset the methane by capturing more carbon with the use of livestock like cattle. We can turn the sad mostly under-productive pastureland we have into much healthier more productive and ecologically functional land this way plus capture a greater amount of carbon than is emitted from the meat production.
It's interesting that freely roaming cows more emit CO2 than 'jailed' cows
In an Ideal World, I would hope beef would be regulated to a luxury again. It's undisputed that trying to to make a cheap as possible commodity is really destructive. If we only had beef every other week/month like most humans used, it prettty much could be supported on grassland.
I swear to god if kurzgesagt say 'it's complicated' or 'we just don't know yet' in there next video
I still feel a bit disgusted that the creature which had been given the title of mother in my country is been eaten by some people...well, thats pretty messed up you know.
48 to be exact
5:25 you mean controversy ?
I think this is a vegan agenda.  Ofacuse we know that the huge corporate food industry like the other mega corporate industries are whats causing majority/most of the global CO2 emissions.  Can't we argue that it this is that is the main issue instead of the traditional omnivorous diet?
Haven’t watched yet, but the problem isn’t meat itself, it’s factory farming.
Using all that wood of new forests to give everyone a great apartment with lots of room?
Wow just in 50 min
FOOB
Massive potato dub
Fantastic animation as always! I wish you brought up regenerative agriculture though, because a lot of the farming we do now (both plants and animals) is done with industrial/degenerative methods. I definitely agree that we eat too much meat currently, but we also waste *a lot* of food. I believe switching to these sustainable regenerative methods could combat a lot of our carbon emissions. Also, I don’t believe everyone going vegan would be sustainable either.
look, without meat in my life, i would be very very sad. if the "Impossible burgers" (actually good meat free burgers) are buyable at where I live, I would totally only eat that. but sadly it isn't, and the amount of choise in vegan meat replacements isn't very wide yet. till that day comes, I hope mother nature forgives me for eating meat.
You guys are really going at it with the meat/dairy consumption huh. Great to see. Please now do a video on animal suffering.
Kurtz pushing agenda here again
This makes me not want to eat beef or meat in general  Me on my way home to eat a steak:
"No other bodily function is enjoyed several times a day and never gets old" Me: maybe not for you... 😂🍆
make a video on  new version of corona
Use me as a dislike button (not that i hate it but i wanna see how the video impacts people)
I will continue to eat beef and there's nothing you can do about it. Maybe you should worry about the oil industry. The term "Carbon Emission" was their idea in order to shift the blame of climate change to other industries.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old." You've apparently never been a teenaged boy.
"meat is bad for the climate...."  we live in a clown world!
Thank you for new information. I will still eat beef. But I am happy you are promoting eating vegeterian food as I agree more people should eat less meat. However it will not be me, sorry.
🖤🖤🖤
As big as America... Yeah, I guess it's not too bad... Plus China... Fuuuuuuu
This video has facts SOO wrong in so many ways, fuck YT for disabling dislike count...
Haha stonks meme is great use?
How many videos are you going to make on meat ffs
Thank you for doing a video on such an important topic!
Or we could just start eating each other that way we solve the population crisis and we have plenty of food
Just go vegan already. It's the best thing you can do for your own health, the planet, and the animals.
Another Kurzgesagt video, another climate change fearmongering attempt.
it seems that kurz has change their mind after misleading info in their previous video about climate change…
I will eat the lab grown meat, I will not eat the bugs
So all we need to do is get rid of normal meat and spend billions of dollars to re-arrange the atoms of vegetables to make meat without emissions, seems worth it to me!

"the more animals sufer, the more climate is beter." - Evil Kurzgesagt 2021
The thing about vegans is that they don’t explain it properly because they’re fucking crazy and Kurzgesat ACTUALLY explains it so the IS a proper reason so go vegan or vegetarian. Or even just cutting your meat consumption by 20% will help very slightly. Or even just keep your diet and make a garden or plant a few trees
Just go vegan.
When one discusses beef, methane, and climate change, one has to mention the methane-eating bacteria that lives in the pastures and grasslands.  Look up regenerative agriculture and Gabe Brown.
no... we're bad for climate. too many humans on this planet.
Sex : Am I a joke to you?
propaganda channel... for every animal you don't eat, I will eat three.
I don't need to buy the meat, my dad is a hunter so he shoots it himself
Well, over-grazing has been a problem people have trying to deal with forever so... Yes, dummies, it destroys the land.  That's why we put most of the cattle in plains with land unsuitable for growing vegetables humans can actually eat.
Can't wait for that Vegan Teacher reaction to this video
'You can decide for yourself' is maybe not the right message. This is a collective problem, people should act together. That's why we created National and International bodies.
Basically, the only way to help it is by reducing OUR numbers.  Food is not optional. The only way to help is reduce our general need for it, which can only be attained by having less humans.
Well we better get accelerating the extinction of land animals then...   I hear elephants do more damn then cows!
I gave up beef for chicken and fish years ago, but once in a while (about once or twice a month) I get myself a burger.
With the way technology has been advancing in the last 100 years I don't think climate change has a chance, and even if so we'll just go destroy another planet in 500 years. What I'm saying is I'm going to McDonald's...
There is one thing missing in this video: junk food. How much CO2 out of those 26% goes into producing sweet or salty snacks, sweet drinks etc? Maybe we should start with that.
Whats actually really bad for the climate is the existence of the person who hide the dislike count. If that person ded well be living in a more futuristic civilized society and mars would be inhabitable..
neat
Maybe its time for another gutten tag
Theres a bunch of issues that I have with this argument.  Number one, the emissions by livestock like farting and burping are not used fairly. No one ever mentions that the methane released by the animals is taken from their feed in the form of carbon dioxide, which is then turned into methane and released. This is very important, because the methane turns back into CO2 in the air, and is absorbed by the plants again. Its actually carbon neutral, much like biofuels. A massive chunk of meats emissions can be taken out of the equation right away, but this is never mentioned.  Number two, the feed. Many people like to point out that most meat livestock aren't fed on grass (for cows specifically) but crops. That's true, however it's never mentioned that about 96% of the crop feed that these animal's are given is left over byproducts that aren't even for human consumption (think stems and leaves of corn for example). Livestock is a very important part of removing waste from crop farming in an economically sustainable way, getting a second use out of crops is very good. Yes, 41% of cereal crops are used to feed animals, but most of that cant be eaten by people anyway. Its lies by omission.  Number three, water consumption. Not mentioned in this video, but still important. People always go on and on about how much water meat production wastes. Not true, it wastes slightly more than agriculture. Most of the water that's always used in these equations saying "ohhh livestock waste so much water" is green water. Green water is literally just rainwater that's been sucked up by grass and crop feed that gets pissed straight back out into the water cycle. 90%+ of the water consumption in the meat industry is green water. Almonds from California takes more water waste to produce than meat does.  It's so annoying when these things are never mentioned so I thought I would say them. Big fan of kurzgesagt but I dont agree with them this time and this is why.
Ok I agree with the points in the video but at 9:33 when they compare the 800 billion tons of CO2/100 years to the 50 billions produced/1 year, isn't it a bit dishonest ? Because if I'm not wrong ( I may be ), that means the quantity produced in 100 years would be 5 000 billions. Or did "50 billions tons équivalent per year" mean they already counted it as being a 100 years ?
You are the carbon that needs to be reduced. Not meat, not electricity. YOU.
Grass fed cows produce less methane though!
are eggs are count to meat?  I mean it uses its productions of meat for producing the egg. I'm asking this because I just like egg
perhaps talk about meat from wild animals like boar and deer?
I don't like beef (gets into teeth too much and it's chewy) and i don't eat lamb since it's expensive. I mainly eat pork and poultry, greatly in favor of poultry (i love me some chicken breasts with veggies).   Also, it's absolutely impossible to remove that part of our diet. I can even use myself as an example. I can't eat anything that produce a lot of gas when digested. I get diarrhea and stomach pain. So a lot of vegetables and grain go bye bye. I also can't tolerate fructose so no fruits for me (though i love them). Meat is the only food source that i don't get that severe reaction to. At most hard to digest meats like turkey ,duck or beef that bring me pain, but it's not so severe.
I wish they brought up that most(some) of the feed that animals eat are unfit for human consumption and would be wasted anyway.
Thanks for giving me documents to bully PETA :D
that vegan teacher would say: yes its bad
Stop changing the thumbnail lol
It won't change anything, humans will be humans, greedy as usual
Food: exists  People: And i ate that
Wow this is a very informative video. Thank you for posting it
fish
Ya im still gonna eat beef sorry
just gratefully eat the food which put in front of you, they (plants or animals) turned into food for you, the thing you should do is consume them. this is also why cooks should respect their ingredients and cook them properly.
Always a great day when Kurzgesagt uploads.
so, the vegan are true
Guess what I am vegetarian by birth  Not due to circumstances.  And even 75% people in my area  about 45 million people are vegetarian and even non vegetarian barely eat animal products twice a week.
Idgaf. Just let me live my life peacefully, this climate thing will sort it self out
What about monetary incentive? A good part of meat production gets shipped to US and UK because it sells better there, maximum profit but because that reason a lot gets wasted, that just makes the numbers even worse, we produce enough food for everyone, but doesn't gets properly distributed, so you end with shortages and overpricing on some countries, and overpricing and a lot of waste on some others.
No it is not. I will not eat the bugs, and I will not live in a pod, Kurzgesagt.
I like how these are only 12 minutes long, yet feel like an eternity. And that's a good thing
But I am a cheese. Does that mean
Wait. What about seafood? Cuz I’m down for eating that
This a hot topic to tackle..
Use this as a Dislike Button
I love meat. Gotta *consume*
Truth be told I say we don't even have to give up on eating meat but keeping it as a luxury would be a good start we can't expect everyone to just give it up overnight.
DISLIKE
No Bill Gates, im not eating cloned meat no matter how much you pay my favorite youtubers....
so the world population is to big   to sustan us     wat do we need to combat this ?       (war)  (pandemic)  (vegen food)  (kill of all ather lifeforms)  ( or do noting and let mother eath do her ting)   she wil survive  until the sun wil swallow her up
The price of beef is still likely the biggest deterrent.
There is a very simple solution to climate change and it is less people.
Meat eating till the world ends , but if you wanna go vegan more power to you
I look forward to the What I've Learned response.
Banana
What about lab made meat? I'd like to see a kurzgesagt video about it.
man, watching this really made me rethink everything  I think I need a burger
Like here if you dislike the video.
Thank God the Americans wiped out almost all the bisons... no more emisions from them I guess? Let's continue with other animimals like deer and wild sheep. The more the better for the environment, isn't it that way?  And very nice to know that these big cargo ships deliver avocados directly to my local store.
Yes we Indians worship cow.. , ox..  hope indians become pure vegetarian one day..if you  follow Sadguru..  even he said this thing abt land used for animal food ..
I'm always driven to confusion by this topic. As much as I'd like to stop climate change and prevent the next generation from living on a wasteland planet, I'm human. Meat tastes good, I find comfort for my stress in food, and it's just all around annoying that WE have to enjoy things less because of the past generations' mistakes. I don't know...I'm just overwhelmed and feel very bad with myself.
I expected to be disappointed again by this one tbh because this is the one topic you haven't really done justice before, but was pleasantly surprised. Hopefully this will inspire some people to make smarter choices based on the planets health and their own.
This channel is a great exemple of how you can take big fat lies based on perverse ideologies and make them very pretty with colored images and nice sound...
What about kettle that doesn't get used as food? For instance India has 10x as many cows as for example the US, but most indians don't eat any beef. So because of religious believes the emissions of these cows are just pure waste? Does anyone have more information on this?
9:30 I may be dumb but I really don't like how you worded that and the visual there. Why is it important to compare 800b tonnes per 100years to 50b tonnes per year? Also you don't specify "CO2 Removed per 100 years" so the image can easily be taken out of context. Rest of the video is awesome! But that part is misleading at best.
oh god i cant look at this video without feeling guilty
'Meat Love' was my nickname in college.
Listen if someone pays for my bills and stuff and gives me money for the vegan food imma change my lifestyle
Yet we dont bat an eyelid when our ethanol fuel production and other processes venting out hoardes of methane as a side product ;D
They have so much helpful info
In the end the question is irrelevant, no realistic amount of environmental damage caused would convince me not to eat meat.
Something tells me that Kurzgesagt have waited for the removal of the dislikes counter before posting this video lol.
I think Kurzgesagt should address the problem that many American and European countries wastes tons of pumpkin every year just to make decorations for a few days.  I am talking about you Jack-o'-lantern.
Cow Farts
I'm not too worried about our diets. Half of us are going to die in the climate wars so the earth is gonna be fine 😊
TLDR: Yes
I like the Nikocado Avocado bird cameo
Ok it still complicated, but can we just eat less meat i mean just eat beef once a week or only for special occasions . And how about emissions on egg is it bad?
B e e f S t o n k s
No.  It isn't.  If anything it is better for the climate.  Regenerative agriculture can actually sequester CO2 in the ground. Those studies saying otherwise are absolutely lying due to political bias.  The train is because they don't take into account the fact that it is a CYCLE.  Any CO2 or methane a cow releases has to come from the plant foods they eat, and those plants have to first absorb that CO2 from the atmosphere.   And again, with regenerative agriculture, you can actually absorb more CO2 and methane than is released.
As a brazilian, I feel shame for the destruction of our rainforests, especially by the use of fire which boosts emissions, wastes resources and burns animals alive. Unfortunately there is very little I can do individually, as these phenomena are influenced mainly by politics, which is currently mostly giving incentive to these practices with the argument of economic growth. Truly heartbreaking 😔.
Does the cereal figure of over 50% being used for cattlefeed exclusively focus on the human edible bits of the cereals? Or does it also include things like eg. cornstalks and such?
i will end   climat exchange
It's interesting as well when you look at how healthy each diet is in comparison to the green emissions. Veganism is indeed green, but I for example can't eat a large portion of the vegan diet from dietary restrictions, which means I would become unhealthy due to the issues there. What then? I as an individual need to remain healthy, and yet my lack of choice causes more climate destruction. It's quite the issue too when looking at overall health as well, since beef has a large portion of protein and nutrients. So many things to consider with it all, but education is the first step to making change, and at least you guys are doing that incredibly well.
One important aspect that should have been addressed is the quality of the plant crops that go towards animals. The standards for animal feed are far lower and as such yields can be far more efficient in terms of resources. And a significant portion of plant based animal feed is made mostly of side streams, like stalks and casings that are useless for human consumption.
How dare you kurzgesagt.  Cows that never get to roam are better for the environment!
Be like Hindus, dont eat Beef.
Instede of Macdonalds eat in KFC If you care but you do not want to abstain from meat at least you will abstain from cattle and lamb Until lab maet will be available for all
6:28 was literally a mind-blowing to me. In a good and bad way.
I watched this video while devouring a beef burger
Maybe we could try growing synthetic meat in a lab or something.
Umm no, the problem is not what we eat, is how many mouths we have to feed. At 10 billion souls in a few years, no feeding method is sustainable. If we were on 1 or 2  billion people on the planet, we shouldnt have any problem with livestock, crops, land, emisions, etc. Same applies to other resources we use for energy, infrastructure, and so on. We need to be less people, stop breeding and expanding like rabbits, thats is all.
_“You can decide what you want to do with this information.”_ I'll just decide it's all lies because I like beef. And I'll not just say that it's lies, I'll actually believe it. Because I'm able to do that somehow.
Use this as the dislike button. I dont expect many dislikes.
Wow. and like that, out of nowhere, the ''Troubles of Meat'' (or something) has become a really solid unofficial trilogy!
I wonder if any members of kurzgesagt had any of their opinions changed while working on this project, and to what extent?
You know the answer
We would not need to worry about it if a certain big red county would take responsibility for their own imessions. But we are not allowed to talk about it
Don't demoise meat perse please.  We have our own pigs, goats and our own chickens, which we are fed like 50% with our bio-trash. So we have "green" eggs and occasionally green meat
what fkn liberal shyt is this
Since I can’t see the dislikes anymore I’ll say this before the video, I don’t care how damaging meat is to the environment, I’ll still eat it and will never change.
Honestly, in terms of beef consumption, the only thing I ever go for is steak and that's not often. Living in the south, we get a lot of deer either from family or friends so, most of the red meat a lot of us consume tends to be wild caught. Not to say that doesn't have it's downsides either, but I feel hunting your own food such as red meat and such is a good step for people to lower their foot print and also continue to enjoy meat they like or substitutes while also learning how to appreciate what all even goes into getting the perfect little 6oz portion of Filet Mignon from eating grass to steaming on your plate.   It'll always be a sensitive topic, which is why I'm really on board for lab grown meat and stuff. If we can nail the technology for it, we could probably make real beef to the point where it's all treated as Wagyu, and only eaten on very special occasions in specific places that can serve it.
eyy another confirmation that its good to be vegetarian like me
So basically, I can keep eating steak right?
2:30 I’m doing a project all about making a green choices to better climate change and I actually got the same statistic here! You know your information is good when people as good as kurzgesagt use it
There's A LOT of bs in this one, yikes.
What I learned from this is that if we want the people we have on the planet, we need technological solutions to our problems.  Time for those solar shades.
No. its not
What a thing...  Meat of animals that are left in peace before their death are bad for the environment. The meat of stressed, tortured, crammed animals in the other hand is better for it. And in either circumstance, you are still being selfish unless you're vegetarian or vegan.
Great stuff, Kurzgesagt
Consumption of meat is not bad. It's how we manufacture it. That's the major issue. Factory farming, while great for mass production, just isn't reasonable anymore. We dedicate too many resources to too little gain, it is destined to fail from a resource and economic perspective. It's best to end the process now while we can and adopt better practices. Yes, meat prices will go up because of such a thing, but it'll also go up even HIGHER if the industry collapses in on itself.
Governments should invest in lab grown meat.
economics plays a huge roll in this debate because for those of us living in third world countries going vegan is just not an option
It seems to me that in the metrics about beef they mixed all kinds of factors that have nothing to do with the food itself.  If plant base diet were more efficient energetically no carnivorous animals would exists.
As a Brazilian raging with the current government, I highly appreciate you calling the country out for all the deforestation going on in the Amazon for rising cattle and growing soy to feed them
Disliked. The elites still eat meat while I’m supposed to chew crickets? Everything’s rolling out in sync now. The other day I saw Tom Holland saying eating insects is cool. Can just be a happy coincidence, not some kind of propagandas am i rite?
I'm glad factory farming is better for the environment than all the free-range bullshit, one less argument for the supporters of "ethical meat"
great video, could someone please try to explain what happens if we abandon the beef (or meat in general) and we need to make more crops for us to get the "lost" calories from meat? or is there already a study or comparison somewhere that shows how much less of co2 we use even if the substitute meat with more crops? thank you guys (i did not find such study by quick scanning google)
Sorry I’m still eating meat
The narration tho
European channel criticizes South America for producing too much food.  * (protectionist anime voice) *WOW!* *
*beef stonks*
I am curious of the impact of something like a Beyond burger versus a Beef burger along with their differences in nutrition.
BEEF STONKS
my questions is, is that eating flour more good than eating a meat?
🪐     I love kurzgesagt I really do
fallout is right, we will all kill each other by 2077
I would turn vegan once they make a cheap meat alternative.
Alright. Only chicken meat, and that too only once a month. Is that good?
For anyone who wants to know: if at all possible when cooking burgers use beyond meats patties I have tried them and they were virtually indistinguishable from regular meat.
I don't get why people are so offended by plant based meat honestly, if it looks like meat, taste like meat, has nutrition like meat, then hey, I don't give a flying fuck.  Also, lab grown meat is a thing, so really, these people are just operating on feelings, whic is odd since these people are the most vocal about "vegan propaganda" which basically means "Idk what science is".
how about you not open up your air conditioning and also get rid all of your private jet
You had me at the first part immediately. Food is superior to every pleasure in life.  Stop loving people  Love food
All this is moot compared to the real issue which is overpopulation.
I literally don't care and will always buy meat. I literally started raising chickens so I could keep eating meat. I learned to hunt so I could keep eating meat. And I am an anomaly. Realistically the masses will fail to adopt plant based diets simply because of market demand. People will revolt and never vote for legislation that limits meat to the amount that it ought to be to limit climate contribution. The solution has to be some combination of climate capture and future sustainable energy industries, people will literally die before they stop eating meat on a societal level.
The video seems to suggest transport doesn’t matter but I’ll bet you it’s better for the environment to buy local meat than meat that has to come with an freight ship from the other side of the planet.
Most of the world wouldn't do shit about this information, sad truth but no one is gonna care about global warming until some mega city is submerged.
While buying locally might not save much in transport, it does save emissions of removed forest. I think the video did not make that clear and therefore moved the result very far to the bad end. Locally farmed grassfed beef has to be the best kind of beef.
You have forgotten to discuss about fish. In asia fish is largely taken over any kind of meat. And rice is staple which is largely grown in floodland and depends on rain. Even though fish is firmed gradually and rice is fertilised, but we Asian will love to know a comparison. 😁😁
Vertical hydroponics and lab grown meat are the solutions
Go Vegan!
f in chat for that one bird that got domed in the head by that potato :/
making "fake" meat that tastes just as good will be a real game changer
IT TASTE SO GOOD THO
Turn cows into giant meat producing abominations to make it even more efficient :)
Comment where you can reply with debunking and reaction videos whatever the outcome of the Kurzgesagt is:
I was going to write a text-wall here, dealing with rhe econimic impact of all this, but halfway through I realized we're all going to die anyway
I think the biggest problem is that the positive side to cutting back on beef is the idea that the land would be used for something useful for the environment. Let's be serious, humanity isn't likely to do that. It will just be used for something else. It could very well be less environmentally bad. But regrowing forests or restoring wild grasslands just isn't happening. That requires a kind of selflessness that isn't in the cards for humanity.  Good points made all across the video though. Bringing a lot of information to the table which is a good thing for people making increasingly informed decisions? Am I going Vegan? Absolutely not. I'll stop eating meat when I'm dead and not before. I do try to do what I can in a reasonable manner. But yeah, that's one luxury I'll draw the line on. Even if we're just talking about beef that's still too far.  Sorry Earth. But we'll have to find a better solution for you than slaughtering all farm animals on the planet and giving back the Earth to nature. If humanity wipes itself out we can explore that option though...
i'm really craving a video about edible insects as a replacement to most meat
"Well clearly science can give us an answer!" * everyone turns to look at science * Science: "...It's complicated."
Well, it's complicated...
Its looking dire and dire everyday. Seems like only way to live in enjoy now cuz things wont be as fun in the future
Imagine Vegan teacher react to that video
I think overconsumption is just a larger societal problem. In some cultures things like fasting and eating until your full are broadly excepted which is why when you look at diabetes rates from some eastern societies and compare it to the west you can see a stark difference. One thing however is I don't think giving up beef is a good idea. Beef and chicken (and by default eggs too) are strong sources of nutrients for humans and as a man, I dont think I can give these up. Nobody wants to eat soy products and be low energy
Science supporting a vegan diet? Where have I heard that before?
It gets even more complicated when you consider national food security. Sure it doesn’t make economic or environmental sense to grow locally but it could if you consider how fragile our global supply chains are.
When the earth was sad and crying 😭 i felt that
Have now reduced meat consumption to 15kg a year. for this, attention is paid to quality. Biodiversity certified. We call it Sunday roast in Germany
Could you do a video on the comparison between meat and meat alternatives? Diet is very  complicated and ive always been suspicious that the soy based protein products aren't as good as they claim
no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old...          Well
Meat by itself is pretty flavorless. KFC isn't famous because of the meat, it's because of the spice blend and the breading they use. You can completely replace meat with plants based options and use the same seasoning and get the same flavor. It's been done now for years. Stop this nonsense.
I'm honestly surprised you didn't discuss lab grown meat and if it could be a solution to the meat problem of climate change. Perhaps it needs its own video?
In short, dont eat meat.

"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old"  No it isn't, it's a fucking chore most of the time. Like I legitimately would never eat if it wasn't a requirement to not keel over dead.
beef is the worst meat for summary...thats why I only chicken and mutton,...and anything that issint cow
Plant more trees and increase renewable energy production, then you wouldn't need to worry about animal greenhouse gas emission. It's relatively simple, but the world doesn't seem to want to make the changes because of politics.
Thought you were gonna have a cringe take, but you just shared my previous conclusions lol. If we can make meat imitate cheap (because it already tastes indistinguishable from the real thing) then that is the best solution.
Dislike
Food is good
So to summarize… eat less animal products, especially cows.
Everytime a new video: well, it's complicated
I'm only here to watch the animation
I think it says a lot about the mental health of humanity today if people think food is one of the best thing about being alive...
I'm about to be depressed aren't I...
Nice point, but I will stop eating meat when those advocating this policy stop using airplanes, private jets, personal islands ,....  At best decreasing meat production will turn meat eating a class symbol
It's funny to see the birds enjoying a feast and on their table the roasted corpse of a bird. Are the Kurg' birds cannibals???
Not only is it bad for the climate but everytime you eat meat you pay people to kill someone for you. How can that ever be ethical! Go vegan
what the fuck is a kilogram
Eating meat does not add new Carbon to the Carbon cycle, which means that in the long run it doesn't make climate change worse unless we increase production (more methane and deforestation). Keeping production of meat at the same level will won't have as much of an impact on the environment as there is from fossil fuels.   Decreasing meat consumption in the long term will lower methane levels helping us lower our CO2 equivalent emissions, increasing it will create more methane and deforestation and increase CO2 equivalent emissions.   Lowering fossil fuel consumption will be the most important part of solving Climate Change, meat is mostly a distraction form it.

Beef's CO2 are terrible. This is exactly why I haven't eaten beef since 2015!
One nitpick: You say chickens exclusively eat feed crops. There *is* such a thing as pasture-fed chickens tho. They don't *have* to live off crops
yes it is  lol
the cow was crying i could feel it  GO VEGAN RESPECT NATURE
Since we can barely afford food anymore, and 1/3 is wasted in production, 1/3 at home, how about stop pooping out half a dozen kids per family?  Cut it down to 1/3, have 2 kids.
beef stonks
TLDR;Meat (Beef) is bad for the planet.
Shifting all the blame on consumer, classic
Hjsjsjsjss
Saw a T cell on one of the plates
9:45 why there was a memory cell 😂
Don't worry, in the future: we'll all decide that meat is WRONG.
Key points seem to be:  * Food production creates 26% (a bigger percentage than it sounds like) of all man-made greenhouse emissions.  * Meat creates WAY more emissions than plant-based foods - even if we look at it as emissions per calorie as opposed to emissions per kg of food. * Beef is the worst meat for emissions, standing way out above all other meats.  * Bigger issue - cow FARMING requires destruction of land (incl burning forests) which makes the emission footprint way, WAY worse, releasing sequestered carbon in trees and soil. * Cows - (meat in general, but cows FAR more so) - requires a HUGE amount of agricultural resources (grass-fed is something of a marketing ploy, still requiring quite a lot of feed). 41% of the word’s cereals are used for animal feed, e.g. 77% of soy production is used for animal feed (and the rest doesn’t even account for tofu and soy milk). * Ethical issue - ‘crueler’ meat = less emissions.   * Going beef free ALONE would free up 2 billion hectares of land (and fully vegan, 3 billion).  * If said land was used to grow forests, restore grasslands - anything that could suck out emissions from the air. This could remove 800 billion tonnes of carbon emissions over about a century (though for context - we produce about 50 billion per year atm. The above scenario would reduce that number by 8 billion tonnes.).  Key takeaway: PURELY in terms of emissions (and ignoring ALL other nutritional/cultural/accessibility/potential cascade/ethical factors), it seems that reducing meat production = better for the environment.   Key action (implied) for those of us that eat meat: less/no beef would be a good first step for everyone, since that causes such outsize damage in terms of methane, which is an especially damaging greenhouse gas. For those who want to go further, choosing less/no lamb, and then less/no pork would also help reduce emissions, if we can turn that into reduced overall demand.
10:08 First step is to choose pork or chicken burgers instead.
the vegan teacher might swarm you 😓
But I don’t want to be vegan. There has to be a solution. Something to satisfy the taste for meat and the lowering of carbon footprint
If we maintain below 5billion. Everything in this world will become less problem.
This one is tough because there are a few facts in here that, while not necessarily wrong, are misleading. And if I can recognize that as a layman I wonder what else is wrong.
Interesting how there is lies on both sides lol
Sharing my reaction to the title before watching the video: I stopped eating meat simply because I grew uncomfortable about the fact that someone had to bear pain and torture like conditions throughout their life for me to enjoy one meal. I do consume dairy and eggs from sources where I know the source animal was treated "humanely".  Now lets watch the video get some  interesting facts, figures and perspectives from the awesome KG team♥♥!
Hey
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old"  Gotta disagree with you there fam.
I think the problem also has to do with this idea that it's the responsibility of the individual to fight climate change, not the collective. When you tell people "you have to stop eating meat to fight climate change", it makes people dismiss you because the idea they themselves can do anything really to impact climate change is a silly notion. We will never get to a point where enough people stop eating meat that it has a noticeable impact on climate change. Instead we must use a top-down approach: Ban factory farms, strictly regulate all meat production, ensure they are producing as little emissions as possible. This will in turn raise the price of meat, which will decrease both supply and demand.
Can you make a video about nihilism? I love your videos!
dont care. burger
Is there any information on potential footprints of lab grown meat? Or are we not close enough to that technology to know?
Personally i understand the carbon effect but; 1: 1 person won't change much 2:  literally the best food ever and drives my day
what's with the comparison of co2 removed in 100 years to co2(equivalent) emitted in one year?  if the year scale was the same it would look like this 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 800 billion tons removed 🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪🟪 5000 billion emitted in the same time(assuming no change in emission)  I mean don't get me wrong that's alot  especially if you subtract the emissions made by the livestock industry that would have to to be eliminated for the first number to exist in the first place  by why the confusion????
1:50  Vegan teacher: NO IT'S ONLY MEAT THAT DOES THAT YOU'RE WRONG I'M RIGHT LALALALALALALALALALALALALALALALA
i give up.. let's just die everyone.. no silver lining here..
To the people like AOC who want to ban cow farts, just remember that the factories that had to produce the batteries, which involves lithium for Tesla's are terrible for the environment but no one seems to care. My family had been dairy farmers for a total of a little over 30 years. The levels of disrespect that farmers receive is unbelievable considering that just about everything that everybody buys at a grocery store comes from farms.
Why do cows have to fart so much, it would be so much better if they didn’t because they’re so tasty
Hmm... this video somehow feels worse than usually. The same birb with the same animation shows up trice, which doesn't hurt nearly as much in the outtro, but still kind of does. That's insignificant tho. The jumper... oh the jumper phasing through the sewing machine. Turns out Kurzgesagt artists are indeed humans.  Anyways besides that enormous amount of single mistake, the quality is still top-notch. Keep it up~
"It's complicated" when all of your ancestors have included meat in their diet whenever they could get it, but the modern commie press tells you that you are the devil for doing it at all. They also tell you that, since trees and plants don't move around, they're not really alive and you are not killing for your food.
Fuck, why are the vegans right. Now I gotta change the diet. *Damn Daniel sound effect plays*
Congratulations on well deserved 17M subs, Kurzgesagt! ❤️
Congratulations! 17000000
Finally, beef stonks
Let's please not ignore the fact that over 70% of climate change is a direct result of the top 1% of major corporations.
This video is fantastic, but it doesn’t even touch on the fact that if you factory farm animals, you also massively increase the chances of new pandemic emerging.
cool video  i'm still not eating the bugs
Do a bit on the uncanny valley and how we constantly see monsters in the shadows
I regret eating meat o after this
Stopping eating meat is a good but I have found that actually buying stocks and shares in companies that engage in climate cleanup projects is by far the best thing we can do. Thankyou again for another amazing video 💖 👍
Bird eat bird that's sus
So basically we should revive team trees and put it on steroids
this is the best day , first my exams are done and minecraft is coming out today , AND kurzgesagt releases a new video
What im taking from this video is "Chicken is tastier and produces less CO2 than beef"
It would have been nice to see food waste in the equation. Americans waste tons of food.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times per day and never gets old"  There is another
Djdjjdjdjdjdjdjdd
If we assume that the current consensus of environmental science is accurate, we're going to have to decide how many billions of deaths is necessary/acceptable to maintain the environment.  But, current consensus is usually not accurate. Climate models have been proven to have no predictive power whatsoever. Strip away the thin veneer of 'trust the science', and all that remains is a doomsday cult.
Though I understand it is irrelevant to the main topic of this video,  another intersting point to consider is the high use of water on animal farming. The water is redirected from sources and damaging areas of wildlife, and the water that returns to the system is riddled in waste. I have not double checked the sources on this though, my bad if it is not the entire truth. I know that this is more of an environmental issue than climate issue though
eating meat is ok because animal breath in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide which is bad for earth altough, human do the same, We are not allow to kill or eat human but killing animal help by reducing carbon dioxide produce and give us food. Edit: do not be vegan because plant take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen, eating it will not help but make it worst.Btw what ever you eat,do not waste food.
Thank you for the awesome content!! Your animated infographics are *chef's kiss*!  Kurzgesagt Team, would love to support your store again! But the shipping fee to places like Singapore is 50% of the price of your calendar. 😥Any way you could find another shipping partner?
I kinda want a steak now
I hoped you'd also cover the fertilizers. I'm not entirely sure, what's the deal with them is, and you research resources would definitely be able to shine more light on the issue. However I've heard, that most of the fertilizers are byproduct of the meat and deary production and if we'd move away from animal products, we wouldn't be able to produce the amount of crops for the new diet.  It makes some sense, but I see some issues with it but I'm not sure about their impact. For example, by not producing meat, we'd need much less crops which would also need much less fertilizers. In a way, we're probably using a lot of animal produced fertilizers to grow their own food.  Also, the fertilizers are basically just the minerals and compounds which will be transformed in some way into the grown crop and it will not just disappear. We should always be able to capture that but some of it is probably result of some  metabolical process.  I think we would need to get comfortable with fertilizing our plants with our own waste
Watched this while eating steak
Is meat bad for the climate? No Just the way we get meat is bad. If we used trains or electrical energy for shipping via clean energy it would be better... If we also didn't use cows that take up a lot of space... Basically the Trophic Pyramid. Eating animals means even more expenditure of energy than if we just ate plants grown where the animals graze.
Zero disliked video on a controversial topic. Damn
I really hope many people will watch this and take responsibility on their food choices accordingly! This video summarizes some of the reasons why I went vegan more than 1 year ago. Education is the first step for change. Thank you Kurzgesagt for such a high-quality content!
Rearing an animal is carbon neutral as the carbon emitted from one end came in through the other in the form of food, usually a plant which got it's carbon from the atmosphere. Methane decays into carbon dioxide and water within the span of about a decade. Global warming is caused by fossil fuels.
Tldr - yes.
Beef also has a water footprint far exceeding most other foods. Most of this is tied up in the fodder crops used to feed them. In countries like Australia where water can be scarce at times, cattle represents quite the strain on catchments both directly and indirectly
*Use me as the dislike button*
It's not a climate argument, it's a moral one. You're eating something that can feel pain. Do you want to be eaten? Can you feel pain? Why make it about climate? There's a clear moral high ground here.
This video is so well done! It explains all the reasons why I went vegan and why everyone should reduce the mean consumption at least. I'll totally share this with my friends and family
Great piece of entertainment. If you believe that what you do in your personal life has any useful impact on climate change, then well.. it doesn't. Donate blood, help someone nearby, volunteer with a local charity. These are ways of having an impact through personal actions. If you care about what's happening around the world, be it climate change, war, or famine, get into politics and start changing the world.
It's a very very important topic but people don't take it seriously at all. For example on tiktok I see people who try to educate people on why meat consumption is bad and all I can see in the comments is "Mmm tasty burger" and shit like that. Kinda sad
just drop a gigant cube of ice every now and then and we're golden
Nope, not switching. can't stand vagetables.
Eating meat isn't bad by nature. Most vegans will agree with me. But the amount we eat, and what we destroy to get this disgusting amount of meat, is destroying the planet. and our blood veins :p
Turns out people would rather eat meat than work to prevent our own destruction.  It's hard because I love meat.
9:35 Why the hell are you comparing 100 years to 1 year?
i love this video, very informative. think im gonna go vegatarian lol
Stop eating cow .simple..just dont eat cow
Meater
Thanks for breaking it down for us!
TL;DW: The only way to be ethical to animals produces more CO2 than it would the be less ethical, thus it'd be far more ethical to remove meat from your diet, at the risk of your own personal health

Hey great work Can u guys make a video about anti natalism
suuuuuuup
0:05 Tennage guys: 😐
One consideration was left out. If you grow your own animals for your own consumption, how does that affect things? Also, the assertion that a beef hamburger is more carbon emissive than a veggie burger was made without all of the evidence. The processing of the veggies into the patty was not taken into account. I would imagine there is a big difference between the delivery costs, in terms of carbon emissions, between raw vegetables and veggie burgers.
Fu*k science!
Pretty much every logical and moral analysis would come to the conclusion that we need to stop eating meat. For the most part all arguments against are just emotion
How about we use the food we produce already (enough to feed 10 billion) and we get rid of the system that demands pure profit. Or are you still getting paid by bill gates?

Isn't the goal of ending climate change to restore the carbon cycle's balance? Because I remember learning that the carbon cycle was necessary for life on Earth to exist, but we're producing more carbon than it can handle at the moment. So the solutions should look less like "we need to stop all carbon emissions on Earth, regardless of what they are" and more like "we need to stop unnecessary and excessive emissions and facilitate the carbon cycle's continuance so we don't wreck life on Earth". I don't pretend to be any kind of expert, but I'd imagine that animals and plants producing carbon-- as carbon-based life forms-- would be part of the natural cycle and therefore ok?  I just think it would be more logical and efficient to focus on things like carbon free energy and on projects that clean up the messes we've made, rather than targeting things like food and livestock, which are largely necessary AND scarce in certain places. Food itself is just not negotiable and should be factored out of this argument. Processing would be the only thing we could target in that particular industry, and regular people can't do anything about how their food is processed. Regardless of how little meat we eat, it's still being produced.
Eat more chickin!
Even if eating meat is bad for the environment, I'd much rather enjoy a steak than prevent the weather from getting a few degrees warmer.
i just think about making a turducken with all those birds
Politicians definitely will put a big tax on meat after seeng this video
Wait why dont we geneticly motify the cows to stop producing methane
then what we should? ı can tell> plant based nutrition
How long will people have the choice? How long until some of the authoritarians running wild now with needles end up forcing the populace to go vegetarian/vegan in the name of climate preservation?  How many of you here would be perfectly fine with that, mouth agape in glee?
I'll still eat it
Damnit, now i wanna buy beef stonks, just for the name alone.
Oh yes. My day is made.
I love meat and I don't want to give it up.  But since I'm not alone on this planet, next time I'd rather choose chicken than beef or pork.
hey, did Kurzgesagt just used the stonks meme?.. hey Kurzgesagt just used the stonks meme
Wow, another video with same topic, you should do next video about black holes for sure 😐
6:58 I would say it's less to demonize cows and more to materialize them
At 9:35 why are you comparing CO2 removed per hundred years against CO2 generated per year? Wouldn't it make more sense to scale the lower bar to 5 Trillion Tonnes?
Lol just eat less meat guys eating meat all the time gives you colon cancer anyways
Can't wait for science meat! Even if it emits the same amount of pollution, just the space we could free up alone would make up for it.
Short answer: No, hippie.
just in time for the hidden dislikes
Happily went vegan over a year ago. The biggest change we can all make is at least stopping the consumption of beef.
Beef is overrated. Chicken is superior 👌
8:12 beef stonks
The graph comparing 100 years of CO2 removal to just 1 year of CO2 emission is a bit misleading, no?  Rest of the video was excellent though
I have heard a lot of arguments against meat diets bashing and you tacled them all. It is indeed very hard to find the right information about this topic, so thank you very much for your outstanding work
MULTIPLE TIMES PER DAY? dam. where you livin'. :p  so what im getting from all your videos is that i should eat food that doesnt have carbon emissions and yet i should eat food that isnt cruel to the animal
6:16 "This ASSpect" *Shows cow ass*
We really need to low the CO2 emitions from other sources couse being realistic food is a complicated think to reduce xD we can stop using cars but well, stop eating is not a option  :(
It's a huge lie, that rain forrest is being taken down to cattle creation. The area where cattle is not where the rain forrest is, but in central west region of Brazil... The research for this video was not accurate enough, or there are any hidden intention involved?
"The more animals suffer, the better they are in terms in climate change."  Well, fuck.
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times everyday and never gets old.”  Are you sure about that?
I'm not going to eat the bugs
This video should be recommended by YouTube everywhere to spread awareness about this topic
I'd let the Earth burn before I stop eating steak, sorry
👍
Your uploads are better in 4k. It doesn't deserve just the mere 1080p.. The quality 😌😭
Stop all needless death!
i wonder why vertical farming wasnt addressed..
Quick! They removed the dislikes!
I like story type vids like The Egg, wish could have more like it.
and not one mention about enzymes. red meat has an enzyme that we can not make synthetically. people have different need of this enzyme including those who need none, but some like me, if i dont have at least a burger worth of red meat every two days i start to have problems. with in a week of no red meat i become irrational, uncontrolled, and psychotic. i will feel like im looking down on me and something else is in control. so many try to say everyone should be vegetarian, but some just cant.
Except the emissions budget is made up and ignored by much of the world.
wow
If we went vegan we would be healthier, more ethical and more environmentally friendly
My argument that i as a person grown up in country side always use against angry anti-meat activists. I will stop eating meat when you will consume what my pig and cow ate.  Aaaand thats where it stops, cows and pigs only consume foods we cant eat or the leftovers that we wont eat.  All that stuff would be in compost rotting and creating co2 and land would be taken by the crops anyways. just more waste. Then again i live in small country that doesnt breed like rats.
This is the only channel not affected by the dislike button disappearing, because they only have accidental dislikes
Your research process is flawed, CO2 emissions have no environmental impact if the carbon in the CO2 does not come from underground. Also methane is an unstable molecule with lots of energy, that's why it's sometimes used as rocket fuel, since nature does not like instability it naturally decays in the atmosphere in about 12 years. Those are not EXTRA emissions. Furthermore, cattle don't eat the part of the crop in animal feed that we eat, it's mostly the parts that humans can't eat that are fed to cows. You are however right about the land clearing and habitat destruction.
Nice video, I ll be vegan from now on. Actually I am vegan since my last meal, I haven't eat meat about 12 hours now
As always, you guys make incredible videos with love and care. Keep up the good work!
So, it's better for the environment if my tomatoes comes via big container ships from the Netherlands or Spain to my city's port than import it via truck from our neighboring state Brandenburg? o.O
In this comment section:  - “wow veganism sounds great, haha sucks that I’d rather watch the world burn tho!” - “nobody: X Me: I love this video” type of comments - “lol vegans be like: ” - “I’m glad I’m vegan, it helps the earth” - pointing out the obvious “bodily pleasure” joke - endless repeats of “food is the best thing about being alive” “I felt that” or “sleep: “ - talking about not eating bugs, which was never mentioned in the video, or saying they “won’t eat bugs and become vegan” (???)
Finally, another quality content upload from one of my fave channels 😌
Humans are omnivores and can’t live on plants alone, and meat protein is needed for healthy brain development.  Going full vegan and even to an extent vegetarian requires a lot of supplements to keep the body going.
I wish Kurzegast would tackle the biogenic carbon cycle on this matter.
"The sea was angry that day my friends, like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli."
My new goal is to eat less beef.
Are you going to bring up the negative health effects of avoiding meat entirely?
Sup bros
dislike for the MEMES
Super helpful! thank you so much!
Who else is a vegetarian here 🥬🥬
Oh ok, so in other words eat what you want...... Got it!!!!
8:14 never realized I needed a meme reference in a kurzgesagt video
Lotta bias against meat and vegan propaganda here - Best beef emits 9 KG CO2  per 100g protein  vs 4.5 KG CO2 per 100g protein against worst plant rich in protein.  So it's not that bad in terms of protein because meat is eaten primarily for protein. Also Beef is ~20% protein, you can eat 0.25 KG of beef (or any meat) to meet the bare minimum daily protein needs. But one has to eat 0.85 KG of tofu or 1.7KG of Potato per day which is plain stupid. Already majority of the world isn't getting the daily protein needs and in order replace it with vegan alternatives, one has to spend 4 to 10 times more (and still may not get all essential amino acids). Going vegan is a clear propaganda against the poor and putting people to guilt trip even those who are trying to meet ends meet.
_"The reality is, well, it's complicated."_ Kurzgesagt sums up reality as usual.
Haven't watched the video yet, but I'm gonna go ahead and say yes
0:46 fun fact: the *MONKE* is eating a cow
Not gonna abide by any restrictions or limitations, until I see the elite do the same. Not gonna let anyone shove bug meat down my throat, not until the science advances so far, lab grown meat is both cheaper and tastier than the real thing, thus more competetive, then the problem solves itself, though I somehow doubt the freed land is gonna be used for forests. Again, it's not the regular people who can just buy land and have it be forests or something, it's the rich.
too bad this wont change any peoples minds.... ): I'd love to be proven wrong.
I've done a life cycle model of potatoes vs pork for a university course since I'm studying Environmental Science. And despite the fact I was pro meat and everything, the numbers still had the pork producing a lot more than the potatoes. Even when both farms were relatively small, and even when both farms were local.
Why are the ethical arguments against eating meat ignored almost completely and only brought up to argue in favour of factory farming?
The nutritional profile matters. If many of you are perfectly fine foregoing optimal health just to signal for phoney status points, then that’s great for those of us who still want to eat the best available food and keep the supply reasonable.
Meat is murder. All animal products are inherently cruel and come from exploitation and slaughter. Be vegan. Be ethical.
"No other bodily pleasure is experienced multiple times a day and never gets old."  Me:  ...  Yeah, theres another one, bud.
This is your dislike button.
SO what you're saying is PETA is the reason why my meat is so inefficient.   This is also a great time to remind people not to make all your dietary decisions based on climate cause it can be very dangerous for your health.
Im a meat eater and I appreciate this video. My takeaway is that vegans are half right when they blame meat. This video wont change my eating habits tho, I want my meat
Ok but how does me eating a nugget change the atmosphere
Yay new vid
0:03 "No other bodily pleasures are enjoyed multiple times a day" You sure about that😏😏
The animation has improved so much
Well, I'm too poor to afford caring about this stuff but I do not like beef and lamb and only some parts of pork are ok (I get grossed out easily unfortunately). I much prefer poultry cuse it is cheap and grows in abundance where I live. I eat it alongside rice/bread and whatever vegetables are in season. But I gotta admit that I eat onions and garlic all year and almost daily. So I guess I'm kinda helping the planet :))
Congrats for the amazing video as ever.  I'd really appreciate a comparison about the impact with some other options for beef, like cell growth meat or insects by example, or some other kinds of agricultural production like multiple crops and forest rather than just an enormous wheat field.  Take this as maybe some idea for the future and thanks for the amazing hard work!!!

DISLIKE BUTTON
I think the question here isn't about whether our decision will change the world for the better, but whether our decision will make the companies in charge of those production change for the better. With this in mind, the question suddenly seems far more complicated.   And I do hear you already, 'production increase and decrease according to thr demand for it', which stands true for most cases, but take a moment to consider that while production will almost certainly increase if the demand does, as no one minds having a bit more profit, it may not be entirely true vice versa. Think about this, if you started to lose profit on something that normally sells well, your first reaction wouldn't to immediately stop stocking up on that item, but instead try to figure out why, and if you can make people start to buy it again, with the 'stop' button saved as a last resort for when you give up. It's not as straightforward as 'demand go up, production go up, demand go down, production go down'.   So then what next? Wait it out? Until the companies in charge of meat production goes out of business? I think it's pretty clear that neither will the government force that to happen, nor will those companies just stand and watch as their brand burns down like a rainforest.   To be honest? I have no idea what to do either. I'm certainly not against the idea of a vegetarian lifestyle, but the question remains whether that'll actually reduce or stop meat production remains.
I'm interested to see if "What I've learned" will make a reaction to this, this video felt like a response to his videos.
this is a biased video backed up by nothing, just angenda.
simple, just dont eat
I won't eat cloned meat and drink chemical milk. And if someone forces me to, I'm running to the woods or eating lead.

Why dont people just reduce their meat consumption? Rather than "not at all" completely... Is it better that 10 people doing it imperfectly rather than 1 person doing it perfectly?  I live in Indonesia, we eat tofu/tempe (soy produced) almost everday, and im not even vegan.... Just be balance
I can't wait for that vegan teacher to give her opinion on this "presentation"
I expected a 3 second video with "Yes, yes it is"
"Much meat, much malady." Thomas Fuller (1608-1661)
It's not bad for our environment
Would of liked to have seen some kind of discussion or acknowledgement about how much of different types of food are wasted and sent to the dump and their effect on CO2 emission. I know grocery stores don't sell all their meat or produce for example and have been caught throwing away massive amounts of food and then there are restaurants to consider as well and household waste.
Even if it didn't cause any pollution, it causes immense suffering.  Go vegan guys, no need to eat meat ✌️❤️
I like how the argument from people who purport to care about animals always amounts to the fact that we need to wipe them out.  You can't leave them alive at all if the biggest problem is their natural biological functions and most people aren't going to bother to keep them as pets anyway so if they're not food they are extinct shortly both from the practical notion that there won't be any reason to keep them alive and that they're actively harmful to the environment to be kept alive.
im already seeing That Vegan Teacher talk about this
Can you do a video on plant based meat?
Even if a beef burger was no worse than a veggie burger it would be moral to choose the later as you wouldn't be enslaving and killing billions of innocent animals.
So grow your own food in your living room or yard.
How would the so-called "lab grown" meat (like Aleph Farms, or Upside Foods, former Memphis Meats) come into the equation? It feels like this technology would help us face most of the problems, while still getting real animal-cell steaks...
The problem here is also ethical and is about using animals as food and keeping them in bad conditions
I hate removing of dislike button 😤
I first thought this video was about love when I saw "meat love", I thought it was "meet love".
"no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old"  damn we only 10 seconds in and you already lyin
Mfw they've answered this question
Don't forget, meat (livestock) is a commodity!
I know this topic is massive, but I really wished you could touch upon how much of what animals eat is non-edible, aside from grass. I am actually confused in this topic, but the video makes it sound like cows either eat grass or crops that we could eat, but that is not true. They also eat a lot of crops byproducts that we cannot eat but that we generate regardless with our agriculture, byproducts of corn, wheat, soy, etc. But I don't know how significant the numbers are. But surely most farmers would rather feed them cheapr or even free byproducts of their agriculture than food for humans.  Also, glad they finally ditched the water argument, which was allways hugely overblown. And glad you mentioned how actually factory farming is the most ecological friendly way of producing meat. People are often sold on the marketing of the bio-products, buying into consumption that is worst for the environment.
There is a video on YT that I watched about a guy that was heavily invested in saving the world by changing his habits and spending less. It was eye opening when he realized that everything he achieved i changing his lifestyle is being annihilated by a single steak in his fridge. He was living as all humans should live - caring for the environment that ultimately keeps us alive, but his feeding habits were throwing all that in the garbage. He set off on discovering why meat was so bad for the environment and he got shocked when NOBODY from both sides - environmental protection agencies and cattle raising business wanted to have anything to do with him. He got a wake up call. His own "buddies" that he supported for years didn't want to stand with him on this one because "meat supporters" had a big say in both places. So it the industry could pollute with NO RESTRICTIONS WHATSOEVER, as long as it delivered cheap meat in the stores. Meanwhile you can still get your green environmentalists money to fight climate change by any other means, as long as you don't touch the subject of changing the meat industry. Meat is as dirty as oil. But nobody wants to fight that fight. Green activists, politicians, big business - nobody wants to touch it. People try to stop trucks with meat exist, but some of them have been killed. You can check that out as well. Inhumane conditions also exist when producing meat. Those movies are hard to watch even if you like gory slasher movies. Neither the guy who made that video, nor me are vegans. In fact I think vegans are wrong. But fighting the meat business is virtually non existent. And so it is one of the reasons why no matter what you do - you can not avert climate change. Because people are not even considering tackling the real problem where it hurts. It is much easier to buy solar panels and feel good about yourself doing something to change it. Putting a bandied on a pimple when you have a gushing wound spilling all your blood.
Here before the vegan teacher makes a video on this
Kurzgesagt never disappoints with the quality of the animation and the importance of the topics they choose!
That vegan teacher is going to make a video about this... i sense it.
if you wanna make change then make the mega corpos and goverments change. don't go around  shouting meat bad.
Im not THAT obssesed with beef, in fact my family almost exclusively eats vegan for health porpuses, but this is still a bit hard to hear. I do like you trust that us viewers are thinking reasonable adults who can make the choice ourselves based on the facts.  Also, I cannot believe you used the Stonks meme :P
I eat meat everyday But not that kind of meat ;)
I hate food, wish I could just stop eating
I don't think beef and meat is worth that much of green house gas! It's not that hard to feed on vegetables! Trust me
just give me the damn mealworm burger already
yes, it is
“one of the most delicious foods — meat” am i the only one who never really liked meat
Have to mention India alone has like same amount of cows than people in US :D     Accodring to google India has about 300million cows and again according to google it would be 1/3 of dairy or poultry or whatever called in the world :)
Não enche o saco
As long as I have pizza and kfc, I’m happy.
Early
Yay finnaly
Okay, but what about synthetic meat?
Interesting but contains a few straw men arguments. Hence a dislike from me.
Where does fish sit on this footprint? Seems like it would be the most efficient meat and maybe better than a lot of crops.
Meat was a luxury in human history but it’s been marketed as a normal diet and been priced that way. Meat is just worst for the environment in every way.   What’s wild is this video doesnt even talk about the WATER required to raise meat, not just what’s directly used but the virtual water for the feed grown for the meat. If that was added in, it would be a clear win for vegetarianism but there’s a lot of marketing and discussion against plant diets, a change bigger than a person, only a movement would push against the meat norm.
I was hoping they'd talk about lab grown meat. I think that will be a game changer. Still not going vegan/vegetarian.
So the best way to save our planet is kill like half of humanity
Did anybody else notice that youtube removed the dislikes?
Love topics like this. Don’t eat meat eat bugs they’re more sustainable. Coming from our leaders who fly to climate conferences.
I pick beef, beef is good. I like the environment but....                                                                                                                                          *B E E F*
Can't wait to see that vegan teacher in the comments
Honestly a little disappointed that this video relies so heavily on a single source
Sunflower oil crops are FAR MORE destructive for the environment especially the Amazon and probably cause carcinogenicity. Though big corps and Green parties DO NOTHING for that and ask us to stop consuming meat to protect the environment.
Ngl i'm very happy with this one.
I love your guys videos so much I've been going back and watching old videos for fun
Genoside is the only way
I do my part by not having a wive and not getting a child to combat climate change, you are welcome.
Vegans must be felling hella mad because they cannot dislike this video LMAO
9:33 comparing the amount removed over 100 years to the amount emitted in one year using bar graphs is extremely misleading. You should use the same timeframe for each bar.
So vegan teacher you have a point
Well its better then  the "balanced" cucumber juice that actress' drink
The area we occupy that nature isn't being allowed to use at its own complete discretion is a very, very big problem. If there is a morally acceptable thing we can do to give more surface space back to nature, that is a thing we should be doing.  Instead we are continually taking more and more of the surface of the earth for ourselves in an unending attempt to achieve economic growth. The current meat industry is merely one of many symptoms of an underlying problem that is ultimately the cause of the climate crisis. Unfortionately, the people in the positions best suited to do anything about this underlying problem are also among the people who, at least in the short term, benefit the most from doing as little as possible about said underlying problem.
Go vegan
Your videos are always beautiful
The same people who are telling us we need to worry about climate change are the ones who have multiple mansions, private jets, etc.
Handsome bison.  Handsome bison.
every new episode of kurzgesagt convinces me more. humanity needs a purge.
What I don’t get is the avocado. So meat goes to a local butcher and that transport is more wasteful than a cargo ship going to Europe and than like 10% is at least thrown away due to higher quality control. And it’s transported from Rotterdam to Berlin or Paris, in the same trucks. So how does this add up? Not to hate on Kurzgesagt, but I just don’t understand it completely ✌️
Cows apparently emit more methane from burps than the other end.
2:47 "1 kg of meat keeps you much longer alive than 1 kg of potatos" That's just plain incorrect.
Funny how these people who care so much about what I eat tend to be obese while I'm fit and athletic.
Sorry, the BBQ ain't stopping for anyone
But beef is tasty.. And believe me, I know >.>
"no other bodily function is enjoyed multiple times a day" 👀 uhmmm
100k only so far
Just when with decided with my girlfriend to stop voting to animals products with our money!  Great stuff here! It doesn't mean i'm vegan. I would still eat meat that are presented at christmas for example, since its already bought and would only be wasted. It is out of my control to make others rule out meat from their diet, we can only focus on ourselves by these terms.  Thanks for empowering this decision!
One like here equals one dislike in the video
Your argument against eating locally grown is kinda flawed I think. Yeah, shipping might be very efficient vs source to store, but you left out the fact that all of that product still has to be transported to and from the ships. There are all kinds of vehicles involved with loading and unloading those vessels as well. So locally only (on a very basic level) has 2 vehicle trips involved (to and from the stores), whereas shipping involves 4 trips, to and from the source, and then to and from the store, with the addition of the shipping itself and all of the vehicles involved with that. *Eventually* all of those vehicles will ideally be electric or hydrogen powered, but that'll still lead to situations where one end of the supply chain is using clean energy, because they can afford it, and the other is still using fossil fuels.
@8:06 Because of the low crude protein(N) in foliage, ruminants take longer to achieve their useful weight thus, grass-fed cattle sheep & goats are actually WORSE for the environment!
And the conversation will always boiled down to "too many humans on the planet"
A lot more nuanced than Bill Gates' "buy my synthetic meal to save the planet" approach. Keep up the great work Kurzgesagt!
I have some issues.     Cattle are carbon balanced, they eat the same amount of carbon as they release back in the environment  Yes they released methane and carbon dioxide but  carbon dioxide is cycled back.  Methane does take longer though.  The arguement against cattle should be related to water wastage   No mention how cattle can actually benefit for the environment by sinking carbon back into the ground  if  managed correctly with  techniques like  field rotation .
50b CO2 production per year: when freeing up 3 billion hectares of land (restores in 100 year 800b CO2) can support our current production of CO2 for 16 years. Thats not realy a lot...
so... cows should go extinct?
Our problem isn’t that we’re eating meat it’s that we’re eating too much, especially Americans like me. Our country, me included, need to learn to start eating a more balanced diet.
They say everyone should live green. Let us guess who is the biggest emiter of carbon gases. Saw an anti vegan joke saying "I ate the cow because he was eating your food." Like the 1 about cuting the homeless in half. We just need to half the humans.
The grass fed and feed part of the video is very misleading. While we do use our crops to feed the animals, we mostly use the parts that humans can't eat in the first place, such us wheat stems. Pigs are also not exclusively cereal fed, they can practically eat anything, and a lot of wasted/unsold food goes to them
Humans are Omnivores and it is a huge survival benefit to have a stomach that can burn as many organic substances for fuel as possible. So to become either Herbivore or Carnivore would be a major step backward in evolution. Therefore we must continue to farm both, but I support efforts to do so with more humane and environmentally friendly methods
I love when you make videos
That summary really helped... I was lost for a while there
really hope lab-grown meat tech would mature faster, so fewer animals will have to suffer, and hopefully also help with cutting emissions
The future is vegan. go vegan
100000 in less than 1h unbeliveble
Human's account for majority carbon dioxide emissions 👀
Amazing and detailed summary, thank you!
The could have gone a little bit more into the details this time... Especially when facing the topic or the use of marginal lands, which is the main argument AGAINST blaming cows for climate change. Anyway, as always, great animation and very stimulating video! This leaves me with a lot of questions
What about lab grown meat?
ah yes meat now i fear meat
Does this analysis take into account the possibility of expanding Regenerative Agriculture, such as the methods used by Joel Salatin on Polyface farm? There is something fundamentally different about his approach to farming than other methods that allows for higher production with lower land use, whilst building soil to lock carbon away.  We would definitely have to eat less meat, but arguably this is the only way we should be raising animals for meat.
bro, if you don’t agree with the video, just dislike and move on, their point it valid and is heavily rooted in research - plus you’re not even being forced to not eat beef, they are simply highlighting the impact of beef consumption and the benefits of the beef avoidance
I get this video's point but the thing is  If food production is responsible for around 25% of global emissions, and individual actions are just around 10-15%   Then why don't we force governments to attack the rest which is... y'know  Big corporations. Corporations could easily cut off that same 25% of emissions without sacrificing quality, supply, or productivity. The thing is, it requires investment, and it requires hurting the oil industry which is one of the most powerful industries in the world. We as people shouldn't have to sacrifice something we enjoy, like meat, for the sake of letting big corps get away with incredibly contaminating BS.   But that's why politicians want you to focus on 'fart clouds' and recycling, takes the heat away from the bigger issue. Not throwing shade at this video either because it's an important and interesting topic, but we have to always consider the other options.
What about lab grown meat? We could get rid of all the animals and still keep eating meat
So you talk about how comparing food by weight doesn't really makes sense then go right back to doing so?  Your wrong about the grass fed part.  Some farmers have started growing grass in doors (very efficiently), so this method can be used to grow more cows on less land.
And ya know, not eating an animal that probably doesn't want to be eaten.
stonks 😂
That’s really sad because beef is so good!!
I am trying to go vegan for ethical reasons more than reasons like how it might help with the climate crisis :)
And here i am, ready to take my dose of disbelief in humanity and our not so distand future.  Every time i watch Kurzgesagt i get more and more depressed. The future looks dark and grim. We're going down the drain real fast. :(
in a nutshell indeed...
Coming from a Mexican American, that ate a heavy based meat diet, it was difficult transitioning to a vegetarian diet. For the first month I was cranky, hungry, and frustrated. BUT, it is worth it trust me! I am much happier now and my life has improved so much since becoming a vegetarian.
I'm a meat-eating pos. thank you vegans 😂
People always want to go straight to the extreme but miss the part where stopping eating beef reduces land use and pollution by over half compared to going completely vegan so just like substitute beef for chicken or fish I'd argue it tastes better
Did anyone else notice the "Stonks" reference?
Propaganda
why was the ape eating a cow
only when those at the highest echelons of society change their lifestyles to save the earth will my broke ass change the way I do things. Until then I'll still be eating pork while the world burns to smolders. A lot of it has to do with example because those who often want us to change the way we live are the ones who wont make a lifestyle change themselves. Big corporations responsible for the lions share of emissions want us to sacrifice more and more of our lives and freedoms to benefit their coffers and life choices. It always gets dumped on those in the lowest rungs of society. I'm done with it, if they don't want to change we can all go up in flames in the next 10 or so years. so be it.
Não sei, não gosto de ter que mudar a minha dieta... eu sou tão magra e não consigo comer os alimentos considerados saudáveis sem sentir náuseas.
I am sure 99.99% of viewers still don't care to change a meat-free diet.
Bro this got 85k views in 26 minutes😅😅😅
Majority of Soy farm was used in meat production..  This Climate change won't be as easy fix as Hollow ozone layer 10 years ago as food is Primary staple of life and many people latch onto it unlike CFC to HFC..
We could use the impossible play burger but I'm not sure but like 50 billion tons of co2 a year is just alot
It is not good for the climate, but i gonna eat it anyway! How dare you? Well, i don´t fly with an airplane, i rarely use my car, i am recycling my trash, i donate once a year an amount of money for something good (doesn´t have to be especially climate related), i NEVER used or gonna use a cruise ship in my life (you should look up how much polution these ships are doing) AND i just eat it 3 times a week. So i would say i am "allowed" to eat my meat and i will never stop eating it, doesn´t matter because of animal handling, climate or anything. You will come to a point in your life, you will realize you can´t save everything and you can´t agree with all people, BUT if you do something good and you are feeling good with it, stick with it! And don´t judge others, it´s about YOURSELF with such things.
Oi Brasil, tá quente né?!
I’d rather die than give up meat.
Thank you for making this case and staying neutral and scientific. It's strong case for veganism even though you don't explicitly say it.
Aren't there some catches to this?   For one, isn't most of what's fed to animals byproducts that we can't consume directly?  Additionally, how does animal produced methane quantitatively compare to other sources of methane? Given the cyclic nature of where an animal is getting the methane, and the short lifespan [of methane], is it actually comparable to methane and other products from resource extraction?
I'll watch this again later with some chicken on my plate
I really like how comprehensive your explanations are
Honestly didn't know how much emissions beef and other animals let out. I'm willing to switch to plant based meats as long as it's more affordable than real meat, and it cooks and tastes the same. My biggest problem is I can't find something like that :/. If someone knows of a product like that, please tell me.
No one:    Not even her dog:   That vegan teacher with 0 facts: wHo Do tHeSe PpL tHiNk tHeY aRe?! tHeYrE nOt EnCouRaGiNg pEoPLe tO bE vEgAn!! tHiS iS hOrRiBLe!! eVeRyOnE nEeDs To uNsUbScRiBe FrOm tHeM!! ,*shows video of animal cruelty*    Btw, I'm not saying tht being vegan is wrong. Being vegan is great but the way that vegan teacher is doing it is wrong....
Ahh! Another great video of krugzaget like always :)
Well researched video, it's funny how a lot of that info is stuff you already knew if you have friends or family that are vegan or are vegan yourself
I eat double the amount of meat since greenies cry, I leave my car running while I shop, and I burn full smoke coal when I don't need it.
We need a huge reduction in human population. That is the only true solution. We are the problem.
Unfortunately, as a brazilian we can say our actual government is not giving a shit about Amazon Rainforest, we got the biggest loggin since 2008. :/
Not to take away from the message, but the visual at 9:34 is super misleading. I expected better from you guys.
0:03 mmmmm cannibalism...I mean food is arguably the best thing in life...❤️❤️❤️
no.
You can not make the farting cows argument without sounding like a loon
Mmm I love meat
Ah yes Another Reason to be vegan
That’s the importance of the Plant Based Treaty 🌱
I'm gonna eat whatever the hell I want. Ain't my problem what happens to descendants hundreds of years from now. Besides, I ain't procreating. And let's be honest, that's the real solution here. Stop popping out children. The less people have kids, the less people the world has to feed. If we start declining our population, we won't need more land or animals.
Yay a new video i watched the old ones like 100 times now
Vegetarian and Bug activist's meat taste like beef.
i just reset and there are 91544 views!!! in a few mins!!!
This makes a powerful argument to change your diet.
Apparently termites produce more methane than cows. So why are we focusing on cows as the problem rather than termites?
I'm early haha
Im gonna be honest, this wont change my diet Why? Well, simple. *Argentina is known for their meat and its culturally agreed on that meat is the best food* This also means there are like no vegan options
Because 26% of all emissions are caused by agriculture, not just meat, we should all stop eating meat forever. Please ignore the other 74% of emissions caused by other industries, those have to keep going to keep our funding.
I like how you don’t drop the fact that meat is delicious, it’s common to see anti emission posts ignore the emotional value of something and judge it negatively just based on the numbers so it’s refreshing to see you take both perspectives
This video made me realize that vegans are right. I understand now why they want other people to be vegans too. They are trying to improve the world. Sure some of them are egocentric, but the goal behind is big and we could contribute by simply change some of our ingredients. From today I'm not eating beef ever again and I will reduce other meats till zero gradually 🙌 thanks @kurzgesagt
RIP the American Beef stonks
Yeah, but, WTF is a kilogram though?  I'm in the US
o we should torture animals to save emissions
We can change our diets. We do not need meat to survive. I am a meatlover so it hurts to say it but, it's the truth.
Nice try but I won't eat the bugs or live in the pod
The animations are always S tier for the simplicity and the way they do it. And I do think people will be able to make actual beef made out of plants.
African kids: confused uunga buunga*      For legal reasons that's just for  memeing purpose
You guys really need so much reason to stop killing stuff ?
"The more the animals suffer the better they are for the environment". What a bitter truth to start the day with!
so who is going vegetarian or vegan?  give a like
ive been meat free for 7 years now, i live in brazil, and im 100% sure my decision affects nothing in society, since we live under capit*lism the only thing able to change the world would be if big corporations wanted to do so
6:21 yeah, our bootleg Trump doesn't help with that either
Hi
Hold on. What was that part about reducing our emissions by 3/4ths and still getting screwed in about a hundred years?!
Irresponsible unsustainable food production is bad for the climate. Not eating meat
Dislike button    Like this comment = dislike.  I’m not saying I dislike or like this video. I’m just trying to get around YouTube being dumb.
I've heard that the methane produced by cows can be partially absorbed by the ground but the problem is that we'd need giant farmlands and that would cause more climate problems
Sponsored by Bill Gates And why you hiding the dislikes?
A really excellent video, I was waiting for it!
Most problems we have on planet earth can be solved when Elon Musk can make Mars a habitable planet. Then we can move a big portion of the planets population to reduce our emissions.  Edit: If we all would become vegan no way in hell the planets leaders would be smart in using that new gained ground in any good way.
On a non serious note those cow animations are cute
The real problem is over population in many countries (Asia and Europe mostly.) The planet just has too many people on it and most of them are concentrated in those regions.  You want to fix the environment? Start with  countries that have high populations densities such as (all have above 140 people / Sq km):   Bangladesh  (1094 / km2)  Taiwan  (652 / km2)  South Korea  (511 / km2)  Rwanda  (467 / km2)  Netherlands  (457 / km2)  India  (411 / km2)  Burundi  (402 / km2)  Haiti  (401 / km2)  Israel  (380 / km2)   Belgium  (376 km/2)  Philippines  (356 / km2)  Japan  (337 / km2)  Sri Lanka (324 / km2)  Vietnam (289 / km2)  United Kingdom  (277 / km2)  Pakistan  (267 / km2)  Germany  (233 / km2)  Nigeria   Dominican Republic   North Korea  Nepal   Italy  (201 / km2)  Uganda   Guatemala  Malawi   China  (149 / km2)  Indonesia  (140 / km2)
Florests dont suck CO2!!!
I ain't dropping meat from my diet. If CO2 emissions from food are inevitable, then we're doomed anyway. The only viable way of stopping climate change is to capture that CO2 and transforming it to something else, which requires a lot of energy. That's right, instead of changing the diet habits of billions of people around the world, better spend billions in advancing Fusion energy.
If it is bad for the climate, then I'm afraid the earth is doomed, I freaking love the taste of meat.
Shifting the message from "we should all be vegans" to "just don't eat beef" would probably get a ton more people on board. Obviously not as effective as a full vegan diet but might be worthwhile just in terms of quantity.
stonks
Congratulations on 17 million Subs 👏🏻🎉
There are no moral or practical arguments for the consumption of meat
What should we do then? I know that there are countries such as my own third world country that, without meat, many would quite literally starve to death  Are environmentally friendly diets the responsibility of the privileged? What it the way forward and what are the economical impacts of going vegan worldwide?  There's just so much to cover in this topic, and I'm very thankful you're covering it  I hope more will go into such a vital, world-scoped debate
は、早く日本語に翻訳してくれ！  Please hurry up and translate it into Japanese!
I don’t care about the environment tbh
I don't care about the climate or future generations because they don't care about me either .
Everytime I watch these, I feel like: The rich doesn’t care. Their special interest groups determine the policy. They won’t care about saving everyone or the planet, they know eventually sh*t will hit the fan and people will die by hundreds of millions per year or decade. They just need to wait until enough of us die, then nobody needs to work on renewables or sustainable food.
Instructions unclear. I'll just start eating humans instead 🍖
Is Meat REALLY Bad For The Climate? Honestly, these hyper-simplified questions rarely have yes or no answers. Moreover, there is a severe lack of both research and data on these issues.
I will NOT eat the insects, drink the soy and live in a pod, Kurtzgesagt, most times i agree with you, but not today.
yeah but i still like it.
Go vegan! they say. Eat vegetables more! they say not paying attention to the fact that where i live, tomatoes and cucumbers taste like grass, avocados and nuts are ridiculously expensive and different grains take way more time to cook and require way more attention to make them anyhow tasty.
"Food is aguably the best thing about being alive." Already had me and my whole attention just with that line.
It's weird how most of us living on Earth will never meet or even acknowledge each other's existence. For example, if you're reading my comment; this is probably the first and last time you'll ever see me.
So glad  to finally see Kurzgesagt talking about the problem with land usage and specifically citating Brazil (my country). Currently our president is a global warming denier and science denier overall, while being aggressively religious. I hope the world helps us.
Disliked because I am a vegan.    JK! I would _never_ dislike Kurzgesagt...One of my all-time favorite YouTubers. ;)
Fuck the climate ! Let’s MEAT !
The strange irony with grass fed and factory beef is… interesting. On one hand, animal rights, on the other, climate change. It’ll be an interesting topic to share with others. Excellent video as always Kurz!
It seems that reducing human population, which will also reduce meat consumption, is the best way to solve the problem.
This channel has continuously improved its quality of videos and I hope it continues to do so. I still remember when I was excited at the sight of the new intro.
Bruh. THEN why do we live?
A pasture allows a multitude of plants, including flowers bees need, to grow.  It also provides habitat for small animals.  Then you have how 1 pound of beef contains far more calories and nutrients than say 1 pound of spinach or soybeans.  On top of this, if you replace pastures with crops, you've destroyed acres of habitats, and need dedicated machinery and chemicals to keep the plants well fed and free from pests.  As well as draining the water table far faster than if the fields were used for cattle; the aquifers in America's breadbasket are being drained faster than they can be replenished due to over farming, and we are en route to a new dustbowl epidemic.  This whole meat vs vegetable argument completely falls apart depending on how you look at it and how biased you are.
Me eat cow, cow uses air, me good Vegan eats plant, plant gives air, vegan bad
yo
"Fart-O-Meter" 😆
Was that monkey eating a cow
Food
baby human is the worst carbon footprint. eugenic regime is the only solution!
can we please start cloning meat already?
The good news is you can make meat out of plant-based ingredients that makes it less bad for the planet and better for your health. So there.
Topic: is complicated  Kurzgesagt in a nutshell: well, it's complicated, but we make it so the viewers are interested.
I hope veggie meat become more popular.
I became half-vegan(veg and little dairy ) since 2 months, after watching your another climate change video.
There’s a difference between a veggie patty and an impossible burger. If you want to decrease meat, just do that, don’t eat fake meat!
Next video topic: Is there any way to escape this world? Do we can space travel?
It still screams of trying to find a scapegoat for our own daily impact upon the world. Aka deflecting personal responsibility. Other animals and us produce methane as well (not to mention the carbon footprint I made so that I can watch your video and write this reply). At this point, no matter what we do there will be an impact upon the environment.
Remember, eat your vegetables.
“No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times per day and never gets old.” I mean there is another one
Well I have never tasted any kind of meat in my whole life and I am proud of it
Never saw a vegan say anythin other than   "Killing animal bad. you suffer in hell "
Biodynamic agriculture, Organic farming, Hydro farming  Be Like ---  May I come In to reduce co2!
The grains aren't fed to cows. The stalks and other unusable wasted materials are. It is NOT taking food out of human mouths
If it weren't for your distant ancestors eating meat, you wouldn't have the brain power for your moral choices about diet.
I wonder how would intreducing the lab grown meat into the equation would change it, taking its perfect for process meat that is the one of the biggest shares, and biggest polutter. It would allow for great reductions in emissions while not cutting on meat products
Disappointed that this doesn't mention cultured beef at all.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple tes per day" ...😳
@Kurzgesagt I'm not eating bugs!
It's definitely not good for the animal that dies that's for sure.   Another great video as always!
Well, at least you say the fact that emissions from transportation and electrical production are bigger.
Your guys’s video topics are such dumb and lies
What about plant based meat for replacement ? We already have some plant based meat don't we ?
Right after the dislike button removal... interesting
Collect ur within an hour ticket here..
Another reason I adore this channel. Thanks for all your hard work!
Before I even watch this the answer is a massive the meat industry is one of the worst if this video suggest otherwise they being paid off.
Feed cattle red seaweed - it reduces emissions of methane from cows by 99%.
80% of CO2 emissions  are done by China. Mass immigrants to the West also consume 20 times more.
As much as I liked your video about "Can YOU Fix Climate Change?". Then this one feels to me very biased. I agree with statements about meat production is taking a lot of land, the statement about livestock contributing to climate change by producing methane feels invalid. Since methane breaks in atmosphere afaik around 12 years, then we can claim, that if we would have constant number of animals, then amount of methane also should stay constant. It's not cumulating same way co2 does. And all that co2 is plant based, not from fossil fuels, so it's closed cycle. I agree, that reducing meat consumption we could reduce hunger worldwide. But I strongly believe, that animal based methane doesn't contribute to the climate changes, at least not as much as stated in this video. However, all I can hope is you to change my mind in future, or your own, depending on the facts. Cheers!
1:39 Seriously, humanity will not reduce emissions low enough ever. Reduction to just 26 % is unrealistic and still is not enough. Either we will get a miracle CO2 removing technology. The governments will start a giant mass murder to stop global warming. Or we have to prepare for it to come.
When did Kurzgesagt became kinda weird channel? Just me?
Brazillian president Jair Bolsonaro is a big part of the problem, he is in line with big agro corporations and helps destroy the amazon, we are doomed as long as people like him are elected. We need to do better.
Kurzgesagt only explains in term of carbon footprint. They don't explain the reasoning, what caused them, or what will happens if certain things was done to counter them. So, the title is actually quite accurate. If you do care, do more research as there are more things to consider.
Keep Up The Good Work, Your Animations Are One Of A Kind
Love me some steak
just had my beef kebab
I believe there's more to be concerned then the effects of food production and consumption.
There is a reason why the wild is full of herbivores and very few omni/carnivores. There is only one lifeform on this planet that can convert sunlight into organic matter. Vegetation depends on the sun and everything else depends on vegetation. No sun = no vegetation = the end  The food chain pyramid is wrong. Instead, think of it like a circle. The outer layer is vegetation(90% area in the circle). The inner tiny middle layer is omnivores(8%). The little spot in the center is carnivores (2%).
Fries, food of the future!
Damn y’all hit 17mil congrats ive been watching this channel for a very long time I’m glad to have seen your success considering how informative you are.
probably the only channel on the internet where talking about this topic doesn't bring all the trolls on earth to the comment section.. well done.  I'm not sure if that video will make a dent in animal product consumption but it exists and that's a lot already thanks Kurz you guys are awesome, made me even happier I bought your great book.  people nowadays can't eat their burgers and say "I didn't know". Also frankly we have SO many great alternatives nowadays you don't need a beef in your burgers etc, take whatever beyond meat or hertas or whatever moke meat they're as good if not better than meat and healthier for you and the planet.. so yeah why choose the worst option?
"It's complicated"  *procceeds to easily explain why consuming animal products it's worse for the environment in any way whatsoever*  Didn't sound that complicated, just feel like people are still stubborn about giving up animal products in order to help the planet. Just because currently net 0 is impossible doesn't mean you can't strive for lower.
Who is watching this eating meat, because I am?
The great reset narrative intensifies ;)
Food is love, food is life
You can be a vegetarian or vegan or whatever and I'll keep being an omnivore.
I honestly wish I didn't have to think about food or eat food, it's a chore 3 times a day I have to do.  Then I have to clean up after the cooking, the plates/silverware/cups.  And last I have to deal with it coming out later.  The entire process is gross and takes up too much of my life I hate it.
Climate change doesn’t exist
7:19 Chandler as a bird
What about the nutrients? Meat contains a unique range of them, which is VERY hard to replicate with just plants. Plus, farm animals often eat plant parts that are inedible by humans anyway, so the statistics about crop use are a bit misleading. Sure, eating less meat may help the environment, but to completely cut it? That is just impossible.
Veggie burgers are still expensive - compared to meat - where I live. If you give a solution and sort that problem out instead of rambling, I'll become a vegetarian the next day.
You forgot to also mention the danger of the great use of antibiotics in large-scale farming. The risk of antibiotic resistance is a big threat!
Give me the lab-grown patty already!
Sadly, I think the realms of genetically modifying crops and animals to suit our changed environments have been greatly held back. I would love to see if we could somehow try to engineer this problem (coming from an engineer, no hate).
i wish meat was better
I can't wait for the Kurzgesagt video where the title is: "Is the planet doomed?" It'll be one minute long and the only actual content will just be: "Yes."

Hello there
It’s been 7 years since I first went cow and pig free. I call myself an ecotarian

5:32 this is the best thing they ever drawed in this channel, change my mind
Eat carbon dioxide two problems gone with 1 solution
I love eating animal flesh. It gives me joy.🥰🍖🥩😍
thx for the effort you put in these vids i wish i could do things you guys could do
"potatoes emit 150x less than beef"  so... i guess french fries are good for the planet?
Why there isn't a LOVE button to press?? A like isn't enough! I LOVED this video! Keep the great word kurzgesagt <3
Make a video on food waste!
I'm curious about something, quite a lot of our crop output is used for feeding livestock, but I think I watched another video where they explain that this percentage is unsuitable for human consumption, or is that percentage accounted for in the video is food we can use in a better way?
Animals: *exist for dozens of millions of years* Now, suddenly: bad for climate
What if used the Sun and "materials" found in the air and the ground to make food/"meat"? (I.e use solar energy to create meat)
"Food...it never gets old!"  Check in the back of your frig...
Meat is the root cause of all evil.
@4:40 OMG... I so much want a Transport Tycoon style game with these graphics!!! I want it now!
To paraphrase past Kurzgesagt video: *_"Eating meat doesn't make you a horrible person, not eating meat doesn't make you a better person than the other, its complicated."_*
Short answer: yeah, it is!  Go vegan❤️
What about the methane cycle?
I never felt so proud of being a vegan before! My carbon footprint is among the lowest!
Eat what you want really, as long as its clean, hygienic and healthy for you. Just know not to cause damage in excessive terms to your surroundings. Other than that, this whole concern about meat this, meat that, and this food this, this food that, is plain idiocy!
I had to watch it again to see if kurzgesagt say Stonk
why do those boats look like star destroyers?
What would happen if we changed our diet to eating insects?
Fun fact: tah ape in intro holds diffrent things in the each video :)
Climate fear has been going on for decades.  They slander red meat because they want you eating soy and becoming sick,  weak and feminized. Just look around. Soy is literally in everything and just take a look at the “men” today.   All this while they push more authoritarian policy’s ... with no real men to stand up to them.    1st it was the ozone layer disappearing. We’re all gonna die.   2nd Global warming - We’re all gonna burn to death - After decades of that not happening now it’s...   3rd climate change - ahh yes, now anytime the weather changes, they’re right.
Bjørn Lomborg goes over this stuff in detail. He shows how things will look if we do nothing, if we do a little, and if we do every possible thing we can. He goes over the actual $ cost as well.  To be fair, we CAN NOT ship meat the same way we ship other foods. This is as bad of an argument as well, comparing apples to beef.
Lets goo eh
7:42 surely we could genetically modify a type of food crop for humans that can grow on land currently used for grass pastures? Definitely seems like something we should be researching and developing right now to help replace livestock
Personally I can't imagine a future where I don't eat meat. But I wouldn't be suprised if in 200 years or so the future generations demonised us for eating meat and our treatment of animals the same way we rightfully demonise slave owners and racists 200 years ago.
Methane is flammable. Why can't we just make bio digestors to convert that methane to usable energy?
me, definitely not sad about those cute animated cows 😞
I’ve only seen first 10 seconds but I’d argue sleep is better
I was chuckling at the animations a little more this time around, so well done! I love the pumpkin life cycle, and the bleeding meat slab lol
8:16 BeEF sToNkS
dislike was removed just in time
Honestly I don't care about food. It's not something I particularly enjoy and is something I take no pleasure in. I do it because I have to, not because I want to.
Unfortunately, as a student whose family insists on eating ground beef In most meals, i cannot do much right now. Hell, I've floated the idea of eating less meat. That's a good way to start a fight with one parent in particular...
Yes, that title could be longer
I now figured out what the solution to climate change is! And we dont even have to give up on meat. We just need to eat each other :)
GO VEGAN!
Don’t ruminants like cows and goats eat only the byproducts of our grains? Byproducts like stalks, and shells around the grains would otherwise be left out to rot and produce methane anyways. Converting them to food is a plus.
Dont eat meat
Penny: I'm a vegetarian, except for fish, and the occasional steak. I LOVE steak!
Thanos had great idea how to cut the carbon emissions by half with just a click of fingers
plzzz someone tel is being a vegetarian goo also plz give reasons plzzzzzzzzzzz!!!!
Ok? Still gonna eat it.
The bit about Brazil is kinda unfair tbh, since a majority of brazilian agriculture production is directed for export, mainly for Europe and Asia. When we talk about deforestation it seems like the whole amazon is on fire which is just not true, all of the forest fires are caused by criminals which unfortunately goes unpunished, it's a major negligence of security that always has happened, it's not something new and isn't any worse than it always has been. Beef is at an all-time high in Brazil RN and the consumption of it dropped expressively in the last 2 years. Being honest and realistic, food consumption especially beef will keep on growing forever, conscious people unfortunately are the vast minority.
huge thanks to jair bolsonaro, the president of brazil, for not only allowing but also encouraging the destruction of the amazon rainforest for soy plantations.
:)
dont you consider the manure full of carbon getting dumbed back on and in the earth. Also, animal nutrition has high tech industry aiming to reduce the energy waste and better efficiency of feed
solution:don't eat
no the short answer
BURRITOS
One river in China dumps more pollution every 2 weeks into the ocean than the entirety of the EU and US do every year. Everybody blaming the average person for environmental issues is genuinely stupid.
"worst beef is worse for enviroment , best is 10 time lower" beef lovers = ok imma buy good one's "best beef is worse then worse plant base food" Beef lovers = BruH!
Why do I hear hands rubbing
I’ve been totally vegan for about 7 months now. Guys, it’s really not as hard as you think.
9:40  mmm T-cell. Delicious!
Don't give the vegan teacher more canon ammo
.
There are many flaws in your arguments, and also in your data. Of course 50% of our agricultural plants are fed to ruminants, because 50% of the plant is cellulose, stocks, leaves, etc. Only a tiny fraction of the the grain plant is the actual grain we eat. The rest is a waste product that cows can eat. Ruminants are efficient in converting cellulose garbage AND grass (not human usable garbage) into consumable food. Non-ruminants are by far the biggest problem. Chicken, Pork, etc is a higher problem because they eat exactly what we eat.  The carbon of deforestation is a problem yes, especially if its burned. But this is bio-active carbon, that has been in the cycle for a while now. This carbon, while its a problem, is nothing compared to the insane amounts of un-systematic-carbon we pump out of the ground. That carbon hasn't been in the system for 300! million years. Our carbon cycle is not in equilibrium with these carbon sources. There is no balance, that takes million of years (Spoiler: Which we don't have).  So your are making a false assumption on the 2 biggest issues against meat. While the meat industry has many issues (inhumane animal practices, antibiotics resistance, bad working conditions), the climate is not the issue. And while we are talking about the meat industry, we are turning a blind eye on the one source that is killing our habitat: FOSSIL FUELS. Arguably 99% of climate change is created by that. By focusing on other issues except fossil fuel, we give the fossil fuel industry exactly what they need - time to make the most profit available before the market runs dry.  So please do some more research on these. Meat is not the problem. Fossil fuels are.
Such a terrible video. Who did you get your info from? Klaus Schwab and his agenda buddies? So much omitted information and just taking the official narrative as gospel. When if you look deeper it's a load of nonsense.  Failed to mention actual nutrition and needed nutritional value in food products, skewed information regarding animals roaming naturally on land and eating grass, failed to mention the sheer huge amount of unnatural types of fruit and vegetables needed to live on an actual vegan diet (not local and shipped from all over the world, where they too have destroyed the natural land to grow them all), failed to mention the laboratory-made "vitamins & minerals" needed to be on a vegan diet (and even then they aren't absorbed properly as they aren't in their natural form for human consumption). Your gut bacteria gets destroyed, meaning your immune system, just look up gut and immune problems in ex-vegans etc.  So regardless of the official narrative, even if true, you still can't be vegan as it's unhealthy and unnatural. The China study and blue zone societies that were studied were again skewed and information as omitted.  Oh and this is coming from somebody who was a vegan for 7 years. It makes the vast majority unwell eventually and the funny thing is all vegans can parrot off is "B B B but you didn't do it right!". Oh I know for a fact that I did it right, hence all the information I know. Short-term coming from a Western diet it's definitely better and allows some recovery for your body, but long-term it's still not good for people. It only really wins, from unbiased studies, when it compares against the awful modern Western diet. That's not saying much then is it?  Let me guess your next video... 'why eating bugs and living in a pod might not be such a bad thing'.
im aware the video isnt about the morality of eating meat, but i think if you really take a step back and look at what meat is (dead animals), it may help you reconsider your intake. we take animal lives and force them into awful living conditions for the entirety of their existence, so that we can digest its muscle and fat tissue at a later date. its really an abhorrence of human behavior while we consider ourselves to be an intelligent and empathetic species. that said, im not vegetarian. i only really eat chicken meat anymore. it tastes good and has good protein/amino acids. but i have cut back significantly and prefer to go plant based as often as i can.
McDonald's Veggy Burger is delicious.
Could we use methane extracters (to remove it from the atmosphere) then use methane as fuel? (We could even use trees/algae to clean up additional co2 from recycling methane, plus cleaning up more co2)
I would be interested in a video about how lab made beef would compare to factory farmed beef.
★★★★★
The root problem that nobody wants to accept is our absurd population, too many people wanting to eat meat. If there were not that many humans, we could be eating good stuff. Now if we keep reproducing at this rate, we will need to start eating tasteless food to be able to control global warming.  I prefer living in a planet with less people in it rather than having to give up quality of life.
Why hasn't the previous video yet received a Turkish subtitles
Kurzgesagt: No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old Me, nearing the end of the NNN challenge: well there is one more
Nice informative video
no it's not bad, people are bad.
I was aware that meat in general had a big CO2 footprint. I was not aware how much greater the footprint of beef is, compared to other types of meat though. Great video, as always!
I love this channel
Good summary! I study environmental science at Uni, and this appears surprisingly accurate from what I've learned!
I love the animation of your videos
beef
We have the technology to culture meat in a lab,do we not? With that in mind,if all meat production pivoted to such production,what would that do to meat's carbon footprint?
You Tarzan, methane
They should pass a law in American saying that every baby born after Janurary 2025 cannot consume meat, subject to the parents being forced to go to jail. This would work for everyone: the old people like you and me would not have to give up bacon and at the end of century, after all the old people died off, there will be a free meat societ.
Kurzgesagt never disappoints with the quality of the animation and the importance of the topics they choose!
Beef stonks
Food is a medical prison in modern times.   No one has land,  no one has fresh water.   Life is meaningless
what about canibalism?
EASY ANSWER: FACTORY FARMING IS BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT NOT MEAT.
I don't think we should stop eating meat completely, but It should be greatly avoided, instead of consuming meat everyday, we should eat once two weeks, and that would solve so many things, crops would be used to feed humanity at a way chepear price, and that would save millions of starvation, the thing we need to do is to stop beeing selfish (in that case eating a meet because taste good), and change for the greater good
nice kurzgesagt posted
Hi
Go vegan! It’s okay if you start slow.
It’s sounds great to save the planet but I love beef.
Just remember if you stop eating meat also stop using air conditioning.
Truly food is amazing
Watching this while eating a beef burger 🍔 😋
CO2: mom, it was the methane's fault.
In conclusion dont eat cows and soy
yummer
Very Nice
Let's just appreciate the improving Kurzgesagt animation.
The only thing I think they missed was that beef doesn't eat the parts of plants we eat. They eat the leaves and stalks of the plant. We eat the fruits and seeds.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old"... Really, that's what you're going with?
10:13 awww
No matter what we must make food production be responsible for 100% of greenhouse gas emissions
No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed several times a day?
Best day of month :) Finnally upload :D
Hi there Kurzgesagt, i have been following you guys quite a while for now. Each and every video is as fun and interesting as the next one. Since you guys also made some explosion/nuclear bomb scenario video's and you already mentioned chernobyl in "worst nuclear accidents". How about an in dept analysis about the tragedy of Chernobyl and what happend with the liquidators and firefighters.
If it doesn't affect climate change I would enjoy it a little bit *LESS* I want to make change, climate change so Baltic can be second Mediterran like it was until 1700's
Sacrificing one's own liberty should never be a choice when pursuing climate changing. Always think "Win-Win" in terms of climate pursuit: when we want to make meat more eco friendly or 'ethical', it often results in a superior product, thus a Win-Win. When we say "Stop eating meat" to someone who eats meat, we are telling them to compromise to something that, frankly, won't make as large of a difference compared to changing your Retirement Fund, search browser or other products you use. I'm a meat eater, but I also switched my super, use biodegradable products and limit my plastic: its a Win-Win for me to do so because I get to enjoy my lifestyle, as well as reach greater health in myself, as many 'cheaper,' less eco-friendly options, are also less healthier for myself. You can be self-centred and still care about the planet.
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times a day, and never gets old"    Erm, my left hand has something to say about that!
All those environment-oriented arguments are such a big reason to turn vegetarian/vegan and there's still such a big moral aspect to the decision. If you wonder about becoming a vegetarian, do it instantly. It's much easier that it seems and it's actually not limiting. After I became a vegetarian, I tried much more food than ever before and I'm still getting surprised by how good vege food can be.
what the monkey(in the intro) holds depends on the subject of the video
i wouldnt go vegan but imma just stick with eating chicken, not a fan of much else
the problem is we can't just make everyone vegan. It just gets to the root of the problem, people love it. What if electronic devices happened to make the most emissions and they will either scale back your allowed usage or ban them outright? I wouldn't doubt if some of the people who read this would oppose this!
What would happen to moon if the meteor that ended age of Dinosaur hit moon
man i feel bad cause whilei was eatin meat while wacthing
This video is actually incredibly helpful, Ive alwats struggled to find reliable sources on this topic
Amazing
i wish veggie burger were more acessible here in brazil.. the price of a box with 1 veggie burger is the same price of a box with 12 regular meat burgers...
No.
Do a vid on monocultures, the real problem
Eating that nice meat and saving the world would be a cool deal, but maybe we don't get our cake and eat it too. Btw, this video is so great because it doesn't say on your face "that's the way it it's", instead, it shows how complicated this matter is and put forth the arguments so every side and opinion can have its saying.
the truth is rather sad tbh
The reality is, well it’s complicated.
I am from Brazil, and the way that the current government is actively destroying the environment and invading natural areas makes me so goddamn angry and sad. Not sure if other countries have a clear picture of us, but it has really been a disastrous government under the current president, with unprecedented destruction of the natural environment and suppression of basic human rights.
watching this while eating beef stew
The easiest way is to just have less human population. That way everyone can get more.
And that is why veganism is the future.
5:37 My family’s reaction when I release MY methane
Sounds like we need to be careful about the amount of meat we eat
hi
Conclusion: yes. Meat is REALLY bad for climate
yaya
Plants make oxygen for us, animals take that from us. So obviously: we should eat vegans who eat all the grass and who keep animals alive.
soy boys propaganda
I'm curious what the @hasanabi take is going to be.
Kurzgesagt in a phrase: - Well, It's complicated
I find the graph at 9:30 to be misleading—you're comparing tons-removed-per-100-years to tons-produced-per-single-year. It should compare 8 billion tons-removed-per-year to 50 billion tons-produced-per-year. Perhaps presenting it this way would be an oversimplification (you have clearly done much more research than I) but I found that graph to be a bit suspect.
why are this ships at 4:48 look like Imperial Star Destroyers
Cow bad hummus good
Wow such a thorough analysis! I've read/listened to multiple discussions of the interplay of meat and climate change from multiple sources. But none looked at this complex topic in such depth. Points such as buying locally is less important than what you buy are indeed eye openers. Thank you once again Kurzgesagt!  Edit: by "in depth" I mean enough detail that can be squeezed into a 12 mins video without it turning into a snooze fest. Agree there are many more nuances to this topic and many will disagree etc. But that's the point. It makes me want to learn more.
I would rather watch the planet melt than give up meat 🤷  Although I will admit, now dating a vegetarian, plant based meat alternatives have come a LONG WAY. I just can't imagine such highly processed foods are a) at all healthy or b) significantly better for the environment.
i want to fart (troll face)
Its interesting how this video goes back and forth and doesn't feel like it takes a very harsh stance, in contrast to most other pro or against meat media. Also not guilting people into a decision is kinda nice.
Why does everything have to be so darn complicated?
aahhhh shit, am i a vegetarian now…
YES! Another video
Amazingly well made video
well, a typical kurgesagst video
I never felt so proud of being a vegan!
What's worse: taking meat away from 9 billion people, or, telling a few people to take a few steps back from the water? Everyone is so afraid of sea level rise. Is it really that bad? People have been adjusting to where the shoreline is since there were people!
The root issue is honestly overpopulation
That first sentence.... I want to cry
4:42 18kg of CO2 for 1 kg of meat for transporting it few km? Sounds like the car as a whole produces  less co2.
Another video! nice!
Are nuclear strikes good for global warming?
Finally another beautiful video. Thank you for this beauty.
Maybe a cool future video idea would be about the many utilities of hemp. It's insane how many products we can replace with hemp based equivalents that are exponentially more eco-friendly. Literally the only downside is the negative social stigma surrounding it.
I'm so glad they made this video, I was planning on stopping eating meat just for the climate, but I cant stop myself from being selfish lol
can we just eat food with rice
"You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information"  Global food prices and global wages: "Go ahead, decide."
in the Netherlands we build farms on the sea and not in the woods. also this debunks the cant grow crops there we turn salty sea soil in groweble soil in a few years
Meat still da best!
Cows can revegetate deserts if left to roam, grass fed cows are better than grain fed, only logical to let cows about
Tor fu😆
1. Unavoidable emissions from agriculture. Cut forests, NOx from fertilisers, manures. Food= 26% emissions. Real driver of climate change.  2. Life Cycle Assessments- full life- tells us that- beef emissions largest. Lamb also high. Then pork , then poultry. Least are crops.  3. Nutrient density, if taken, animal protein is still costly.  4. Worst beef comes from certain practices. But best beef is worse than worse plants 5. Local food? Will it make difference? Transportation and packaging doesn't much. Only 11% emissions. Last few supplies make most pollution. Shipping in contrast is very efficient. In markets themselves, the emissions are higher. Transport doesn't play a big role. 6. Methane highest from direct farms. Then CO2. Powerful methane, though short life. 7.  Diary methods, geography, etc. Destruction of forests for farm lands is the worst. Much emissions. Farms burning down rainforest damages.  8. More animals suffer, more emission efficient. e.g. animals not allowed to pasture, less destruction of lands of vegetations. But on other side, unused resources can be used in pastures. So pasturing can be efficient as food can't be grown there. But there are other factors, just grass feeding won't suffice. High demand of meat is met by crops grown specially for them. 41% of cereals for animals. Similar for soy which destroy rainforests. 9. Food is a huge driver of emissions. Buying locally doesnt solve. Pastures alone doesn't feed animals.
Thanks for the advice I will not support free range food anymore
Just watched the big bang theory video and found your channel its amazing
Listen me, u can survive without eating any food, by just watching kurzgesagts video
Be part of the future - go vegan 🌱
Lets All Tag @Mark Rober
everyone who loves food  = everyone who is alive
Feed cows kelp, they burp less and you can make use of all that new oceanfront property.
POG
This is by far, the most polemic video ever. I never knew grass fed was as bad as it is. This made me think about my diet again
They've lied to us about covid, why wouldn't they lie to us about climate change?
How about we stop trying to desperately hold onto the idea that meat is in anyway ethically or logically viable? :b
Whoever does the music for Kurzgesagt knocks it out of the park! The music is so catchy, convays the theme perfectly, and is just well made!
Wait until that vegan teacher finds this lol
I think we do need to eat less meat as a whole, specially if we talk about the United States, but I could never become vegan or vegetarian, I’m willing to eat less meat, but not to stop eating them forever.
8:49 the fucking soyjack face is sending me
Is the nutritional value of the milk produced per cow also put in the emission calculation?
Great video!
YES BEFORE 50 K LETS GO
I'm super sensitive to taste with my sensory issues and I wish there was something that would be excactly same as meat is but veggie based. Thankfully tho I don't eat meat based foods everyday or make one food that will last long and has little bit of meat and lots of veggies. I want meat to be for me something more special like fish is, something eaten on special days to honor the animal. I'm not giving up on meat completly bc it is super good tasting but I'm definetly eating it less and usually buy meat products from sale before they go to waste
I've omitted a car in my life, reduced my meat intake and produce some of my own vegetables in communal gardens.  What have you done?
“You can decide yourself what to do with this information”.  So 99.9% of everyone watching this will simply do nothing because eating meat is convenient and they don’t want to change their lifestyle.   Some will lie to themselves and say “well I’ll eat less!” but still continue to buy animal products at virtually the same rate and convince themselves they’re doing their part without suffering a single inconvenience.
I'll still eat meat everyday though
Eating animals is absurd at this point. Cruel, unsustainable and unhealthy
So you're telling me, even when a lot of people are still starving food is causing a big hit in the atmosphere?
(no i still didnt watch the video) meat is bad because cow's lethal fards? lol idk
Ok, hear me out: floating islands. We pull all our resources and discover anti-gravity tech, and then create floating islands. We move lots of soil and micro biomes onto the islands creating ideal circumstances for forest growth and then let the islands loose into the atmosphere by the hundreds of thousands. The trees suck up the CO2, boom, no more climate change.
Kurzgesagt: "Food is arguably the best thing in being alive" Me: *KILIMANJARO*
Congrats on your new milestone guys!      Ps. Can you do termites vs ants?
Thanks to Kurzgesagt, I made the change to eating about half my meals meatless and only rarely do I eat beef. The simple thermodynamics of the situation convinced me. In addition, the result was a better balanced diet for me with more fruits/vegetables so overall a win-win.
Protect the cows protect beef sales
hi kurzgesagt I liked the video keep up the good work.
We wiil be farted out of existence... enjoy while it last...
I can think of something else that is the best thing In life and never gets old...
how does hunting for Elk or Venison fall within this video?
9:55 The First Ever Owl.
Ok. Avoid beef from now on.
Hey Kurzgesagt, fix your Immune book hardcover issues.  Half of the hardcover books have a cheap cover and the print is of terrible quality.
I was unfamiliar with the argument that buying local would reduce emmissions from travel. I always thought it was because buying local means that you can do reliable research on local ranchers and growers.

Comments for the Algorithm God
Can't believe that we might die due to farts
A big problem me and a lot of other people have is when people say to not eat meat, because it saves the environment. But in my head that's just not true. Me not buying meat off the shelves at my local publix isn't removing CO2 from the atmosphere, its just leaving food on the shelves to be thrown away, and go to waste. The meat producers arent losing a customer, my local grocery store is. The producers already got their pay, the grocery store is just trying to make a profit. I'm not doing anything other than wasting meat. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like thats why a lot of people don't drop meat even if they are told its better for the environment.
Yes, eating meat affects the environment, but cows are not killing the climate . Meat the meet, and be sweet.
rule of thumb: question in the title? the answer is No.
One way to solve this could possibly be lab grown meat, since they are pretty much better in alot of aspects compare to traditional ways but so far countries accepting them and production is on the not so well side
Thanks for the awesome video Kurzgesagt! Maybe you can also make a video about lab-grown meat and how it may change the future of our diets? It seems that would be a big game-changer.
I mean. If there's less people there's less food that needs to be made...
I will double my meat eating, thank you.
the process of making meat is bad for the planet
Hello there
Damn-it, I just bough 0,4kg of shoarma....
I just realised Every Video has an unique Intro... I mean Everything is the same Except what the Monkey is holding... if you did not know this look at older videos.. This one Shows a cow... Dino shows a feather... Immunity shows a sandwich... Pollution video shows Drink a In Giant Virus video there is a virus mini-figure In the Immune system 1 Sausage, and in black hole one a coin etc... This just shows how much Kuzgesagt - In a Nutshell Team works on details Of every video... Really appreciate it!!
Shouldn’t this video be called “Is beef bad for the climate?”, you haven’t really talked much about other types of meat and didn’t even mention fish.
Man, i fell so sad knowing that the entire world looks at my country and think "Look at those idiots, they have the biggest rain forest in the world and they are burning it down for money", greed is what is going to kill us
vegans love this
food is yum
Globalist fascism is completely out of control. If they are not stopped, the next holocaust will be in the billions.
*i need to see dislike ration to know if people take this topic seriously , apparently Google made everything seem joke* 😒
The quality is just so amazing
I've been saying this for a while now! Sure, we can move cattle to an all-grass diet, but we will still have to give up our egregious levels of meat consumption!
My whole lifetime carbon footprint is just bill gates air travel emissions
So basically in the future we may actually have to change to a vegetarian or vegan diet   (Vegans "I knew it")
i'd say no. but only because i like it.
1162nd
what about cell-based meat/lab-grown meat would that make a larger difference?
you have a point,but you forget animals also take the plant waste product such as almond hull and hays
awesome video as always
Kurzgesagt just casually destroying Betteridge's law of headlines with this release
Cow farts are ruining the planet 😁
A soylent green future is coming, isn't it? It would be even more effective if a vegan one is cheaper.
Video idea/question: how much emissions transport produces are busses better then cars?
Has this channel ever posted an after effects tutorial?  I would love to see that!
*Half way through the video* Blah blah blah blah blah blah (Ugh here we go again) But that's all bullshit, isn't it? (Oh my god, did they just call out greenwashing?!)
As far as I can tell it's bad for 🐵🐔🐶🐷
I will now be eating MORE meat
Lab grown meat needs to happen, especially for steaks.
and thats not even mentioning the future pandemics that are going to come out of factory farms
who else plans to go on twitter and see people argue in the replies to this?
Take that vegan teacher
If everyone was vegan the US alone could feed 13 billion people
Can't wait enough for lab-made beef.
Notification squad
Go vegan, folks 🌱 It's gooood!
DISLIKE BUTTON
I worked out how much carbon I’m saving by not driving to work and its a fair chunk more than from the meat I eat so I feel ok in terms of existential guilt… I’ve heard that the shipping industry is actually a heavy polluter when they’re in international water but no one calls them out on it because who’s going to enforce it
STONKS
8:30 did they just say pigs exclusively eat something? My understanding is pigs eat practically anything...
Why this channel is getting boring
I wish vegan people talk more logically like in this video other than talking with emotions. ill try to eat as less meat as possible now!
it'll be funny if in 2060, when 5% of countries got totally wiped out because of climate change, where oil corporations still bribe politicians, where we eat bugs and live in a pod, for us to find out that "cows are responsible for _% of climate change" turns out to be a hoax pushed for by oil companies
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive" Literally everyone: "Yes"
NO NOO NOOOOO GAWD NOOOOOOOO
FOOD!!!
Making food choices without ethics? Lmao. Only if animals could speak or raise their voice through something.
8:14 ayo kurzgesagt stonk meme??
9:45 is anyone gonna talk about why there is a giant cell on a plate, wonder what a giant cell would taste like though
U didn't talk about lab meat
When I saw the thumbnail I was like sheeeeeeeesh
and then there's the ethical argument of the mindboggling animal suffering as well, just because we like the taste of something. if you consider yourself a morally justified human, cutting out/back on animal products is simply essential.
beef is mostly banned in India it should be banned everywhere
What about farming techniques that require a range of animals and crops? Like would a varied farm with beef as a small part but where everything feeds back into everything else and it's all connected, be better than a soy monoculture?
super cool
votes who loves food i love food tell your openion
Great video
This channel has given me so much knowledge about science, technology, and other complicated things. I've learnt so much here, That now I'm a genius in the real world
Due to general  religion, culture, learning about health, and learning about carbon emission, I am vegetarian and it is not as bad as it seems. I hate people who promote veganism but their points aren't bad either honestly.
Solution: Stop having kids...
Seeing the cute Earth crying while showing the methane's climate-changing power almost left me in tears 😭
Became a veggie 4 years ago after being a meat eater for 27 years. I did it purely for environmental reasons (I honestly do not care about the slaughter of animals, they are tasty let's face it) and this reinforces that decision. I still miss a good steak though.  Great video.
Food is everything  If we are hunger we eat food We are alive it is because of food  So don't waste food (Lots of people are dying because of hunger and you are lucky to have food)  (Lots of animals are dying and in 1 or 2 years there will be no animals in the earth we are not producing more only killing not breading animals)
I would like to know what the impact would be with lab grown beef and other meats
Don't care. Gonna have a steak now
Claim your "Before 1 hour" ticket here
well I guess I'm going to have to a beef free diet
Gonna go buy me a big fat steak. idc
Great video. It's perfectly possible to eat meat and care about climate change. It makes you a massive hypocrite, but the thing about hypocrisy is that no-one has ever denied its plausibility. Go vegan  for the animals, as a bonus save the planet.
E
So... Should we help Thanos to find the stones?
What about lab grown meat?
am i the only one who feels good after eating 🍖 ?
i read the title as "is meat really bad for the chinese?" lol
Gathered some knowledge today
I disliked this. So much stuff was left out. Like cows eating parts of the plants we can't eat. Don't have much time right now, remember seeing a good vid on this
I saw a video a couple of years ago claiming beef is actually fine ecologically. While I knew many of the arguments were iffy and could even debunk some myself, it's not even close to the level you got to here.
0:45 pretty cool thing: that monke holds something new every video
With out meat what will we do to live  Vegan:allow us to introduce ourselves
really nice video, R.I.P dislike count
Like always a wonderful video👍
fun fact: an average human spends around 4.5 years just eating.
Does anyone else watch these videos and try to figure which of the birds are liberal and conservative?
Honestly I almost never eat beef or any red meat for that matter, usually only eat fish and chicken
Is it weird that I find the left image at 5:59 attractive?
9:22 50 billion tons pr year over 100 years would be 5000 billion tons, meaning less than 1/5th would be offset by the 3 billion hectares of land, and that's if we get to use it for pure carbon-absorbtion, what if large portions just get taken by companies for other uses
I think you missed, if you remove the cows and sheep, don't the deer or other wild ruminants fart? At least cows and sheep are nurtured and controlled by farmers?
nice
*The belly rules the mind*  I can't say no when my belly says it wants a burger.
If only Kurzgesagt ran the world
We must avoid animal products specially meat ASAP! Great video. I’m glad I’m vegetarian and I hope more people be so.

kurzgesagt: food contributes to climate change me: ok, but not by a lot, right? kurzgesagt:... me: NOT BY A LOT, RIGHT?!
That thumbnail convinces me that meat is good.
I've never listened to a voice this sexy before, like ever
The graph at 9:33 is a bit misleading, comparing 100 years to 1 year. Good video as always though.
Go vegan!
Watching this while eating a steak!
Present :D
The worst thing is when people humanize animals while their cognitive view on life is so much different. They do not have the ability to judge in differentiation, its all trigger related affect of hormones, metabolites and (second) messengers. I find it really insane how the highly previleged upper class with their sky high morality attacks humans for having certain diet while the have on average 7 slaves in asia and africa existing to supplement their lifestyle. Humanity right now batshitcrazy  As a life loving biologist, i really hope climate change eradicates humanity. In Caspar david Friedrich´s misquoted line, i love life, i hate people but people are a vital part of life.
You think food is the best thing about being alive? Wrong. The best thing is shitting.
My carbon footprint is nowhere near the size of those rich hypocrites who continue urging me to reduce mine and everyone else's. So I'm going to stick with meat.
Nice
Only humans bad for climate, don't look for any reason to ignore our effect.
Wow I'm early (vol.2)
Aye, these little animations are so cute!!!!! It makes the videos a bagillion times better
"me who cant do anything and can just watch every person in this world make the world burn in time or have a solution on problems on ourselves and on our surroundings": let me thee watch thy world go
It's a bodily function that is enjoyed multiple times a aay and never gets old.  Masturbation has entered the chat
factory farming can convert animal waste into biogas and reduce methane emission.
this video came 15 minutes ago for me and it already has 5.4k likes  damn, this channel  is good love it keep going, dont listen to any haters also, the memes are just perfect, 8:18
''no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old.'' are you sure about that
Soo true fact appreciate whole team's work and honestly you present facts 👍👍👍
What's your favorite food?
Best educational channel 🙏🏻🙏🏻
damn 13 minutes ago
I Will nevera stop eating meet, and i teach My sons eating meet is good been a vengan is Bad, wy? Look at vegans, they look older with realy Bad skin and mentaly i'll,  if your diet needs suplents it's a wrong diet simple as that
I bought calendar and it is beautiful!
Hey! Love the video but i was wondering. What about animals that are hunted? Such as deer {which is near and dear to my heart). Are their carbon footprint so minimal it isn't even visible really or is there a dark side?
Kurzgesagt can you guys make a video on sound? I mean the topic sound and properties associated with it. Please? Please?
No, I'm still not going vegan, shut it
Me : Studying about food in Book  Kurzgesagt : And we took that personally .
I've decided to keep eating beef until the world crumbles I don't give a fuck
"no other bodily pleasure Is enjoyed multiple times a day and never gets old"....  Speak for yourself ;)
Good . Or not ?
As you said vegan food is void of nutrition. Carnivore and keto diets are the only diets optimal for full human health.
Use me as a dislike button. Not saying the video is bad, just giving the option.
I only eat on 2 occasions, when it's mealtime and when its not.
Cattle are FED CROP REFUSE and/or crops that WE DO NOT EAT OURSELVES!
IT'S. ALWAYS. COMPLICATED.
The thing about crop and meat emissions being bad for the environment is that we make way too much that just ends up getting thrown away.   we make enough food monthly to feed every human on the planet twice, but a lot of it ends up going to places that don’t need it (the us and Europe). This is because food sells better in those places than in places that need it, so if we’re going to need to get rid of the profit incentive.
why cant we dislike this video?  we arent allowed now to rate anything nowadays.
The climate change scam should and must be debunked.the human race will never alter the climate. The scam is financed by those who make a fortune. Co2 is not the cause of global warming. Remember we are in glacial phase as we move around the sun our temperatures will change this has happened for millions of years and a warmer climate is comfortable.wake up everybody you will be robed
Amazing video!
😐
I predict a rise in lab grown meat.
I stopped eating meat because I did not want to be responsible for so much animal deaths and suffering. The amount of people who are indifferent to this made me indifferent to their suffering.
Eating an animal will never give us peace.
kurzsdnalskdnf: says first 7 seconds teenage boys that just discovered waking: actually, i beg to differ
Fuckin corpos want us to eat synth meat and plastic
This climate change stuff is annoying. Humans will do what we’ve always done. Adapt.
7:14 ok i didnt break and laugh till that bird on the bottom right lmao. Congrats to the editor your a GOD at making funny remarks mid video like that. Never stop doing that
pre 1000 coments
crypto mining IS bad for the climate stop it
whoa I'm early
woooo
This is why im going to get into hunting. I wont eat beef but deer and other creatures
One thing I have noticed that Kurzgesagt always make videos on most relevant topics. Clearly my most favorite channel on YouTube.
This video's got beef with beef
Love this channel... It seem that nowadays every other science or stuff like this channels are biased...
Very interesting but now we need solutions, can a veggie burger safely replace the nutrition content in a beef patty for example? Vegetable oil ain't exactly super healthy for you due to it being heavily processed afaik. Do veggies patties carry this same problem? Also do we know the corrected carbon numbers if we exclusively used land that supports cows and thereby limiting beef production to a more sustainable approach? How do beans fit in this as a protein replacement? Just filled with more questions...
bruh my connection so bad i can only load some comments
8:16 beef NOT STONKSSSS
yet meat is needed for humans, we cant really only eat plants as we are omnivores
"Food is arguably best thing about being alive"- So true :D
i'm realy corious if they considerate that when the veggy are plants, they actualy consume CO2 . could i find it in the source?
"The reality is,well,its complicated. " Kurzgesagt explained life in a nutshell.
I think it's important to state that a lot off feed we grow for beef is the leftover materials from the plants that humans can't digest
Environmentalist who eat meat crack me up.
I'll give up meat for the climate when the largest polluter's start pulling their weight
Vegan=blm=isis=you hate yourself and belong in a hole in the ground stop pushing political views
Eat lesst meat
Humans are really bad for the planet.  Not animals
The crops grown for beef are not "Grown for beef" the livestock feed are seed husks, cobs, and other plant matter that comes from human crops but can't be digested by humans and hence would only be wasted anyway  but cows and sheep can digest it, so instead of letting that indigestible waste from human food production rot, we feed it to cows to make more food out of waste...  surprised you diddn't go into this kurz... but then it wouldn't support your agenda
It is known fact for long years but didn't we bored to watch meat episodes for years? What is this, 5th meat episode?
Tl:dr artificial carbon sequestration is gonna be required to keep loving.
I am pure veg 🙄
So i was right..
It's hard to pay attention because I'm tryna listen to the music in the background  It is absolute fire 🔥
“Food is arguably the best thing about being alive” Sex: *left the chat
Being very vague just calling it "meat"... focus on beef
Yea that's cool and all but... steak
This is a cycle, not a mathematical test.  You cannot measure or solve this insanity by the matter of showing statistics animatedly.   The argument is missing the principle of mother nature from the start.  That everything is in a cycle.   I see that climate change rather becomes an artificial religion built on fear and misleading than an actual problem with viable solutions.  theres not much here to talk aboot.
"Food is arguably the best thing about being alive. No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old." hm... i wonder what OTHER bodily pleasure can be enjoyed multiple times every day by discord mods...
So what's your favourite cut ?
I still don't think this covers all the points in, say, WIL's videos
My Nightmare: Kurzgesagt - In a Nutshell turns into That Vegan Nutshell
8:17 beef stonks
Short answer: yes Long answer: yes
Hello  Im here to watch this video
Quality keeps getting better and better.
Great Animation as always :p
Meat is sooo good...we're doomed
Jvh jgv
“You can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information.” I’m going to enjoy the f%ck out of this bacon cheeseburger. lmao
Yes, let's all stop eating meat and become nutrient deficient.
more.
This channel is going to get the first 1 B subscribers
Rather be a villain than a saint...
I like meat
What abaut fish
Kurzgesagt=İlluminati
Cow methane farta can be reduced by 70% by simply seasoning their feed with a type of seeweed.  You can also train cows to use a spacific pin to collect waste.
Interesting 🤔
Love how digestible this is 😁
Already made my choice - if buying meat on my own, only chicken
This the best explanation I could ever ask!
Congratulations on hitting 17 Million subscribers.
We can't say for sure. But people are!
Yea its totally moral to pay people to tourture and murder on your behalf so you can “enjoy” dead flesh.  Survival of the fittest, kill or be killed - but factory farming is an abomination that can only have been birthed from the mind of satanic loons.  Go and shoot a buck or somthing
Anorexics would beg to differ with that starting statement
When you question the morality of unnecessarily killing animals, it becomes quite clear that we should change.
spoiler: yes it is
Nonsense
At this point just sterilize all humans and the planet will heal itself🤷
We should eat less cereal since it's not that good for us anyway and feed it to the animals.
MOST ANIMALS ARE USE LAND NOT SUTED FOR CROPS! No forests are destroyed for cows.
Im eating while watching this
Whoa is me
10:08 "you can decide for yourself what to do with this information" No. Soon it will be mandatory to have your buyings registered and your emissions calculates and limited.
Yay! Finally a kurzgesagt video after 84 years.
Veganism is bad for the environment. Your videos are usually rly good. This one not so much
Meat is good.
Don't you need to add the transport emissions you state for beef to the plant ones. Else how are you transporting the 'avocado' to the local shops? Why should it matter if you transport 1kg plants or 1kg meat to local shops?
Lab-grown is the solution.
Wonderful
Lol "rapid climate change, isn't it 0.01C every year?
Welco to why I want to build a house ASAP, so I can switch to hydroponics, and only eat what I grow and get from a butcher.
I never would have guessed that pork has such a similar emissive footprint to poultry let alone a smaller one than lamb!
Ah, a video they’ve already made
So u saying we have to bring back Thanos....
I dont like meat because animals suffer AND it doesent help the planet  AND it would be more efficiant to be vegan Animals need more food to grow less meat Most importantly ANIMALS SUFFER THEY ARE OUR FRIENDS  THEY FEEL PAIN JUST LIKE HUMANS
Eating meat doesn't make you bad. Eating plant doesn't make you good either . - Kurzgesagt
Spoiler: Yes, please go vegan to help our planet, the animals and our health
Demonizing animals while humans' consumption is what cause disproportionate CO2 emission. As if the earth is for humans-only.
Vegan teachers sucks
People keeps talking about amazon rainforest, but dude. That thing is burning since 1000's it's absolutely a gigantic forest. You can't just put the fire away. What people really want is to internationalize that thing
Chicken eating chicken
Meat is life
Kurzgesagt: Meat is not unhealthily for you. Also Kurzgeasagt: It is unhealthy for the planet.
"no other bodily please is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old"   has no one told Kurzgesagt about puberty?
"My family has a small farm and the best thing about it is that all food that we don't eat goes to our animals. We even buy old bread and stuff from bakeries that would otherwise go to waste, though I doubt it would actually go to waste since there are plenty of other farmers in our area." - Nigel Thornberry
Why are random subscriber beggars commenting random nonsensical comments in the comment section?
Vegan Teacher left the chat!!
Cows are the sweetest, biggest dog-like animals. Watch, for example, the cow playing fetch with a ball video and consider how similar they are to dogs.
When I saw a notification from kurzgesgat in a nutshell I was like  LEZ GOOOI FINALLY ANOTHER VIDEO
You really said container ships are efficient just to spite me? They burn heavy fuel oil, a lot of it and there’s 18,000 active ships. These and commercial airplanes are awful for the environment but no one talks about it.
I think the cargo container stat is the one I take issue with, I’ve always heard, and looked up and found, that cargo containers are among the worst polluters?
Its always worth the wait
They did not just add the HOI4 naval move sound at 4:27?
Early!
Wow I’ve finally been decently early for one of these vids, I love your vids and they are fun but also very educational. I definitely loved all of your space ones and I learnt a lot of stuff.
I am willing to completely cut out meat for just one more year of petrol cars.
The amount of damage we do to the climate is the average emission, pollution, etc. times the amount of people there are. Why focus on reducing the former but not the latter? What use is it to postpone the problem and lower the quality of life by focussing on the former factor?
Goddamn youtube getting rid of the dislike button. I wanna see the stats.
"food is arguably the best thing about being alive" taurus energy right there
Thank you for bringing me watching Kurzgesagt tell is meat really bad for climate while checking out delicious food from my home country.
Why humans are vegeterian: * Canines are vestigial organs *  Long intestines like herbivores *  Side movement of jaws *  Drink water by gulping instead of forming cups by tongue
I am imagine it depends heavily on which type of meat you're talking about
Yes. Next question?
There is much more to the nutrient density of meat vs veggies than grams of protein or kcal of energy. Anyway, brilliant presentation once again.
Ah yes legendary video by legendary channel
I kid you not I am actually working on a project about this precisely, great timing
Let's make farting a crime. Those humans destroying the climate with their farts
Hey Vegans! This Animals eat your plants. So we decided to eat them. Your welcome  <3 .
We really need that vegan teacher to watch this video
This video is trash
Just 3 minutes and already 800 comments????
It's effect is almost insignificant in the climate.
I’ve been vegetarian for a year now and I don’t think it’s made that big of a difference in the amount of waste I produce alone. All it’s done is made me healthier and stuff.
Beef
Literal lies. Ok.
hej
Theres this scientist that is trying to make meat without killing animals and the scientists says the meat they are creating are more healthier and less expensive i really am hoping to eat that meat one day!
Yes
Finally early to one of your videos!
Thank you for ALL the videos. The best thing on youtube. You own the internet xxx
@UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q giving hard to swallow pills to everyone.
Its fine, imma eat my meat, humans deserve to die anyway, might as well enjoy the end while eating a cheeseburger
This channel's videos are always the best!
You watching this video with Sausage in your hand
Yes it is. Thank you and goodbye. No need for a video.
I'm gonna go eat a potato :]
Yes
Babe wake up, Kurzgezagt uploaded a new video.
Summary: bad, especially cow meat. But hey, it tastes good
Stop industrial farming. Use the whole body of the animal that is sacrificed to feed you. Bone narrow and organ meats are what predatory animals go for. It all would be a huge blow to certain industries, but consider that they are making you or other people unhealthy anyway.
Go vegan.
Quoting a morbidly obese man "Food is like masturbation for your mouth" as a fellow morbidly obese man i have to agree. I need a good to fill my belly, meet my nutritional requirements but has no taste. Im fine in between meals but once I start eating even when im painfully full theres still more food and it tasted so good so why not?
Wow
YT: Is meat really bad for the climate? Me: Watching this as I eat meat, *hmm, interesting*
living itself is bad for the environment
hello
🥰🥰🥰😍😍🤩🤩
Yes meat IS bad for the environment!
And yet the people that promote an all vegan diet are treated the same way as karens
Renounce to a diet, become a just potatoes eater
Hello 👋👋
So your telling me all climate change is because of a bunch of farts. How unpleasent
Just tell the vegans to eat climate, an healthy alternative to save the earth.
17mil!!
2:36 happy irish noises
Here's your ticket to celebrate to be the first person to wa tch this video
Wubba Lubba Dub Dub!
Keep ignoring the carbon and water cycle. Eating animals is not the same as pumping billions of tonnes of stored carbon under the ground into the atmosphere. How about a video investigating how actual heat(combustion engines, cooking, energy generation, air conditioning, heating, lighting, etc...) affects the global temperature variant?
Well... I eat Rendang from Indonesia         I Indonesia. you know
No. It's not. End of video.
I AM NOT GONNA CHANGE MY DIET WHILE CHINA DOESN'T GIVE A FUCK ABOUT ANY INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT AND BUILD NEW THERMAL REACTORS AND FACTORYS EVERY SECOND  !!!  which I already can't buy any meat cuz I'm living in Turkey
"No other bodily pleasure is enjoyed several times every day and never gets old"  You sure about that?
So we can make videos on climate change but we wont do anything to stop it the governments should start to think on this because its so serious and if they dont do anything then humanity will go extinct by 2070
It’s nice that Kurgesagt made two different videos to examine both aspects at meat, nice.
So basically cow farts are ruining the earth’s atmosphere..
I don't care about co2 methane and other shit i just want to eat some tasty food thats all
I love meat
Literally everything poor/ middle class people do is bad for the climate. The elite hate you beyond measure but most will bend over with a smile for an extra social credit point
Carbon budget? 🤣
Behold the Cell based no kill meat had entered the game, 90% more eco-friendly & healthy than traditional meat, with absolutely 0% antibiotics. Only drawback is that's it's expensive, damn expensive, but it's a price we can pay.
Nice video sir
Can't wait to see vegans rage like a kid in this comment section
I will not eat the bug. I will not live in the pod. I will not wear the Meta headset. I will continue to hate the Antichrist.
Yeah, the real answer is that it doesn't matter what you buy to eat, it is important that you eat it.  By the way, buying locally where I live is not just about emissions, is also about quality, here cows live in open spaces and eat mostly grass.
Beyond meat will save us
most researched and accurate videos are made by kurzgesagt and it gives a two point of views.. Nice
I really cannot believe that we get these type of quality content free ....will support you kurzegesat....love from india .......while Indians who don't eat beef .... interesting 🤔
Last time I was this early, the climate haven't changed.
My problem isn't the science or vegans. It's the rich hypocritical people who ask the majority of people to eat meat substitute or whatever. While the rich dine on real food and put out more carbon per year than the majority of people. There is an real agenda to make Meat the new lobster. An world where majority of people dine on meat substitute while rich people get the real thing.
Well. This bacon sandwich just turned a bit bitter.
6 :(
=D
If climate change was this extinction level event the """scientists""" claim it it, why don't we have nuclear power?
this reminds me of vegan teacher lol
Implying if meat is bad for the environment. I'd plant a tree for every ounce of meat i eat.
You know what, just don't eat. Solves a lot of problems and if you don't eat long enough, includes solving personal ones.
awesome!
As a meat lover even if it is thats a risk im willing to take.
Love this topic 💝
The only channel that i listened and trusted
Not having dislikes means I can't really tell how well-received this video is. Which sucks because this is such a heated topic.
“Congrats to everyone who is early and who found this comment”!
You should make a video about the YouTube dislike button if it's good or bad that they removed it
I mean, obviously "yes" - but it all tastes so good!
This time, the Easter-Egg Monke is holding the miniature of a cow
Finally after 2++ weeks without video   Now its the TIME  LETT GOOOO
This video is twitters arch nemesis
Remember, you don't necessarily have to choose between a vegan diet and a carnivore diet. There are options in between. Less meat and more vegetables might be a option.
I will start eating human meat if I can’t eat animal meat
Haven't finished the video yet, but I feel like I will have: A. Existential crisis B. Ethical crisis C. Anxiety
Yes its bad. So I beat it every lonely night
I love how Kurzgesagt always combines genuine information, cool animation styles and 'subtle' humour.
You know what eating animal meat IS really harmful towards?      The animals.
IM HEREEE OMG HI KURZGESAGT I MISSED YOU
ngl this dude makes the best videos on youtube, i learn more in this video than 3 days of school
The Climate is always changing. How about everyone focuses on Pollution, but that is a subject that politicians and World leaders look the other way.
I literally found this  video 4 minutes after it’s posted
I’m vegetarian, so I love these meat videos and I’m grateful for not consuming meat a lot. This 3rd video helped a lot. I do know a lot of other factors must be considered and this isn’t good or bad. But, I’m happy :))
.
humans is bad for climate they need to be purged. or rich ceo and companies that's kills the environment.

Aw sweet, can't wait to see both sides getting angry at the vid for not demonizing the other enough!
Ooh new video
Lol
This video is gonna make Gordon Ramsay lose all of his money...     Poor man... he didn’t even have the chance to find the lamb sauce...
Well it's complicated If it wasn't complicated Kurzgesagt wouldn't make a video about it !
We need a better way to get meat, like lab grown meat which makes meat less polluting.
Meeeeee
Congrats on 17M!!!
This is a psyop, they want you to eat bugs instead of healthy meat. Don't listen to this propaganda. Most CO2 is absorbed by algae in the oceans, growing more trees won't change anything
doesnt a cows digestive system cause a pretty substantial chunk of that ~25% of emissions caused by food production?
Here within 5 minutes
I’m gonna keep eating meat.
"hey, how did your race become extinct? Space virus? Meteors? or maybe another advanced life form?" "cows"
it feels illegal to be this early. only 5k views
Food is arguably the best thing in life and has an ability to make everyone happy.
I ❤️ Kurzgesagt
you know the voice will give you an existential crisis but you click anyway
unpog
Will this Soundtrack be on Spotify too?

Lmao
I think about kurzgesagt meat videos every time I’m out for a steak or burger. I’ve actually gradually settled into a mostly vegetarian diet, but still have chicken, and beef is an infrequent treat rather than a weekly staple.
Wow I’m early!!!
true  food be bussin
Sadhguru
Some people are vegans because they care for animals Some people are vegans because they want to kill plants
hi
From climate conference straight to climate video
That vegen teacher be like: of course yes!
just found out the early comment section is hella wierd world
Stupid Question: Why don't we consume the blood, the organs, and the fat like other carni/omnivores?  Arent we missing a lot of nutrients just eating the outside meat?
🤔
good thing since i love eating tofu
Good to see you again
It is really a disgrace to see that consuming meat is widely defended as the very normal in western countries regardless of its impact …
Fun fact: everyone reading this comment hasn't watched the whole video yet
The animations are so astonishing. I can't believe this is free information-
Kurzgesagt upload a video Me : Another blessing from the lord !
But how to fight against the internal conflict of Taste vs individual responsibility towards climate change
You really explain in the easiest way possible. Waiting for your next video 🤩
This is the best week, I get to watch Mr Beast's Squid Game, and now a Kurzgesagt video😁
This is why we love this channel
I still think the core problem is overpopulation and overconsumption, not the eating meat itself.
Hmmmm meat.. i should eat something as i watch this
reupload?
"no other bodily pleasure Is enjoyed several times a day and never gets old"  Yeah, about that, most teenagers have to disagree.
Yes
Thanks YouTube the only thing you do right on 3 year
I don’t know but good meat just tastes good but you don’t have to eat it every day 😌
I am finally at the first 500 comments and first 10000 views! :D
The timing. I am writing an essay next week about the ethics and effects of meat. Thank you for this video!
Vegans: Eating meat is a very unforgivable inhumanitarian sin against the mankind.
I love all these videos
This youtube channel helped me at learning science and biology
The vegans are 🔥 right now.
Wait havent I see that one before ?
Go Vegan!
Hit like if you are reading Immune the book.
Darn! Have been waiting for this for so flipping long
May or may not be bad for the environment but the cruelty to animals is unbearable and immoral.
I literally opened youtube at the end of my day to search about some immunology video's from Kurzgesagt and there they are in the recommendations!
Remember!! We use sheep as a sacrifice for God And God recommended eating meat bruh
Methane - it has to be some universal joke that farts quite literally turn the earth into a dutch oven.
Chicken is delicious though...
Never watched Kurzgesagt video this early before.
Early lol
Short answer - yes. Long answer - [See video].     Just a little parody :D
Don't be fooled by the thumbnail my carnivorous friends, this is vegan propaganda in disguise!
Viewers : how ? Kurzgesagt Voice actor : well it's complicated
I've been Waiting for this. Pure Epic
early but not enough
i'm so early... omg
For vegans --- " Yes, it is 😑"
Kurzgesagt never disappoints with the quality of the animation and the importance of the topics they choose!
Ah youtube recommended a random animation about a random subject and i still love it
Meat is good for the climate because it makes me happy, you wont like me when im not happy...
Damn I am first
Is this REALLY still a question?
This video exist :  my Frnd KFC freak :Cap 🧢

MEAT
It is true that people who say meat is bad for the environment also eat meat
I respect the fact you don't eat meat. Please respect the fact that I don't eat fake meat.
I'm so glad there's an English version of this video now! I will send this to so many people
We made it to the early club 😩 😩 And we stan an informative king ‼️‼️

I’m so happy that y’all are doing a video on this topic.  I’m sick of these “Vegan Influencers” saying that all people who consume are bad and pollute the earth.  We finally have facts and statistics to prove whether or not this is true.  Thank y’all
I don’t eat a whole lot of meat but hey since it’s Kurzgesagt, I’ll have look at the menu

I was just looking at meatless meat on the internet and this video got uploaded.
The quality of these videos continues to amaze me!!  Congrats on 17mil!
As someone who doesn't consume animal products, I love that u guys talk about this topic because u are not only rational but also calm and look at FACTS not OPINIONS  🌱
Not sure if it’s bad for the climate, but you know I’m not giving up my Bacon 🥓
I don't think people will stop eating meat just for the sake of climate when there's bunch of other reasons for it
Nice
This is the content i want
I really do appreciate how much effort you guys put into every of your videos, good luck and thanks, Kurzgesagt !
first saw a video on it on What I've Learned, now - here. are we finally waking up?
No, eating meat is part of the natural circle. The massive industries on the other hand....
All the vegans are in the comments ready for him to say something that mildly brushes against they’re values
BE VEGAN ^________________^

COMMENTING AND NOT EAVEN SEEING THE VIDEO LULE
No. Locally sourced it is not.  Most vegans and vegetarians get their fruits and vegetables flown or shipped from all over the world, in plastic packaging. Being vegan or vegetarian naturally in your own climate is impossible, thus you need to burn tons fo fossil fuels to get them sent to you around the entire year – apart from a few select countries.
Finally you are here
top 500 pog
Incredible subject 😭💘💘
Wow.
