Definitely under-shooting the calories on that burger mate....
Simon Wilson yummy 🤤 x
Needs green chile.
Poor Ruldolph and Bullwinkle.
i somtimes drive 3 hours from narvik just to go to this little place the food is amazing
Poor Rudolph 😢
Simon can you show your helmet in a video soon ? On the slong
Hi Simon the Ketchup King love your videos but are you going to do a Coast to coast video of Canada the most friendly and generous country in the world. Would love to see that as my wife is Canadian and she loves your videos
God I'd love to try that food, especially that burger.
:)
I want that burger
I love reindeer it's delicious
LOCATION?
1 key, 2.2 lbs of WEED!
We ate there in December and I had the reindeer and moose sandwich you had. The food is great and the people that run the place are super friendly and hospitable. Great experience.
True way to intermittent fast with that burger
Poor reindeer...rip What's Santa Gunna do now
The Americans are like that was easy xD
I’ll eat 3 of those easy
Ah yes That’s where rudolf went
I am from Sweden but live in the very South, so have never been further North then Stockholm. Always more tempting to go South, to other countries. Nice place though! Was it Kiruna?
Simon’s a Tomato Ketchup
this looks so god damn incredible
Steak sub + 4 patties pack of bacon and 9 slices of cheese!  Simon ''I don't think I want another one''   Swedish cook  ''are you sure?''    the quality of the food looks great even though it is not part of my diet!
better than mcdonalds???? everything is better than mcdonalds . im beat it's good but 1kg??? it's too much SW
I could really go for that burger right now
I was born in Finland, so moose meat was on the menu during the hunting season.
Next day, three flusher
More like 10,000 calories.
For God’s sake, Swedes speak better English than most English speakers. No need for subtitles 😂
When is Simon leaving Sweden?
Lol
that would be more like 3-4000 cals
I clicked this thinking it said attic loooolll
Baldr & bald would be proud. Super friendly place too
Simon had reindeer stew in this video 2019 and now pretends he never had it before? Anyways, I am hungry now, thx.
Lmfao always knew you were saucy.
Santa Claus is going to be pissed 😆
Simons first breakthrough
The best thing is, that he is comparing burgers to mc donalds burgers as if that was the standard... lol
How much did that costs?
Bald and Baldr will be so proud of you! Cheers from Sweden!
BETTER THAN McDonald's... wow Simon, never thought I'll see the day,
enter whaat.. surfshak" lol
I'm coming to Sweden soon yummy...
Haha I prefer the moose to the raindeer mmmmmm
Fuck eating a burger with a fork just get 4 burgers made right
I feel bad for the toilet he must have absolutely destroyed later on that evening.
Bruh my guy doesn't even remember he had reindeer when he stayed in the arctic circle in those huts lmao
2500+ calories a day, and that is your daily allowance? Is not that like a bodybuilder diet or something... But then again you are building your body :-)
better than mcfonalds lol, anything is better than mcdolands
bro where the fuck is your drink to the food man
I want to eat that for suuuuure right meow.
A packet of bacon 🥓 it’s a calorie bomb 💣
Aw Simon, you are so clueless sometimes it is cute
That´s how to get a diabetes in one night.
As soon as I get my vaccine I'm flying from Ireland for that burger.
u sound just like ANDY TATE. Manc born and bred lad
Hi
I LIVE IN SWEDEN HOW THE F**** IS KIRUNA THE ARTIC??

Food looks sexual! Still working through your vids, amazing work, love from Leicester
Hi Simon your vlogs is awesome.i really looking forward to your new vlogs hope you do some New ones soon.

2500?a whole day bite1🤣
You protein pig,  that was impressive
My man ripped it!🤟
His selling out... No reason to .. unsub.
Jesus Christ I've had some big burgers before but that was crazy. I would love to get my hands on that!! Even that moose and reindeer sandwich looked tasty 😋. Congrats on finishing it as it looked like mission to finish 👏👏.  ✌
i got a heart attack just by watching this
Ayyyy
Jesus, you ate Rudolph!
Little did he know the raindeer he ate happened to be the raindeer that used to lead Santa's sled Rudolph made it past the meat factory
So jealous
You could do without that burger simon mate wow
Wait a minute. They have a fire inside an enclosed tent? I’m pretty sure that produces carbon dioxide poisoning.
This burger looks so good though
you still in sweden ?
4:36  the rock we found you go back to wwe
After finding out most of Simon's videos are sponsored I feel kind of cheated now knowing all them times we thought he had no money or was stranded, he wasn't.  FFFumin !!
are all swedish ppl are this cool and frndly???????just wow...i would make that guy my new bff ....
800k!!!!!! Finally 1 Mill 🔜 Covid lockdown has us binge watching all ur vids!
My mouth is watering
There was deffo more calories then 2,500 in that there’s about that in one pack of bacon
This burger ruined all the fast food burgers for Simon. From now on nothing will be the same. Keep up the great work, Simon.
Seeing him in Tomato Ketchup looks normal to me lol
Huh.. ive had reindeer before and i'd never say it tastes like beef. Very different.
Gordon Ramsey should try that XD
We need the no money challenge back please 😭
I watch Harold's vids so thought I'd check out yOurs I love moose I'm from Alberta Canada 😂
That food looks awesome mmm 😀
Give it up for fuck sake.
Dona kebab was that a pun at Santa's reindeer🤣
Eating street food I never thought I’d see the day tbh
Simon, you are a dead set Legend 🍻
I would still want something sweet after that 😂
I"m thinking about Bambi right now....are you prepping for another Prague kg challenge?👍
As a Finn I was waiting for the moment he'd say where he is at... And yeah, the answer was what I feared, Sweden. Why, why Simon...?
Yeah bro I dont think you should do no more no money videos. And videos with a budget instead. That would be cool
You are finally growing up foodwise
now i really wanna eat it
Omg Simon you've given me serious late night burger munchies! I need something like that in the UK! 👄👅👀🦌🍔Grrrrr
Living your best life. Bald is back, Baldr is back and Now Simon is also back. Though to be fair Simon has been uploading while the other 2 were under lockdown.
The gifted oyster gergely amuse because event speculatively cause under a irate hydrogen. superficial, resonant thomas
The guy actually ate Moose and Reindeer!!! 😂😂😂
All the vegans crying right now haha 😄
"Can we smuggle in the reindeer?" 😂
Congrats Simon! Think of all the good stuff you've been missing while eating that McGarbage!
This man eats like a hobbit.
Serve shack?ohh surf shark!
We stumbled across this place when we were hiking in Northern Sweden, also had the Moose and Bacon ... food was incredible as was the random setting! Great to see this cheers 👍🏻
Hello I been watching herald your friend video now I found your channel and subscribe to your channel today new Sub
The guy love to say the artic Aaaah tick
You don't pay for McDonald's 🤣
Poor Rudolph 😂
If u say its better than mcdonalds, then that means its amazing in simon lanuage!
Better than mcdonalds is not a shout.
Food truck robbing the tourist because no one else would buy it
Now you got to ring them up Simon and say I'm missing a 1000g burger off my order and a coke. 😂🍔
You need a good Intro music
if its a weird food,just put it in 2 buns,no gagging lol,bald and harald would be impressed
Amazing burger you bought. :) In Sweden we call the Moose. The king of the forest. / Skogens konung
omg that food looked amazing guess Sweden doesn't offer vegan options . Great to see you back doing vids not been many with the virus your a true star. Maybe you'll do some of Wales (your home land )
What?!? A tip from Simon! Harald taught him well 😂😂
Better then mac ds. Thats not hard. Mac ds is utter crap
I approve the ketchup
wonder the price of the burger?
What a lovely place to go eat some really food. Such lovely people and an amazing place to go sit and eat next to the fire 🇬🇧
Can’t help myself from getting hungry 🤣
Now I’m hungry 😋
Wow that looks amazing!
Welcome to Simon's paradise! Maybe better than Mac!! :D
Damn I hope these people got extra business from this vid. They seem so friendly!
Shut up peppa pig 😅😅😅
Simon is due a huge dump tomorrow.
You are such a bloody nice bloke.
Harald and Bald have changed you. Gone are the days of just chips and ketchup
Billy Bobs in Branson Missouri I believe has a burger 50% bigger. Specs in Topeka Kansas has a pizza size burger.
Open fire in a petrol stn forecourt :/
This is great banter... it really is
Video starts at 1:15
Humbugs, you forgot the fries. FAILED...LOL..
Damn that was really horrible to watch, and not even having a taste of it.. Good one Simon, it looked amazing and what a great bunch of workers their, so nice polite and friendly people..
Simon trying something other than McDonalds, Subway and Burger King. Harold and Bald smiling right now
That’s looks Devine........
Alright Simon, You're in my Neighbourhood now!
Awesome people
Oh i dont know how i miss you spamming ketchup left and right on ur food
I love your channel. God bless you!
Good video, yamyyy😋🍀👍
All of this and then washing it down with a coke. I feel so sorry for his arteries.
Simon, I've missed you mate!
Seemed like an awesome place with cool people.
You are eating Rudolf :( :( :(
Would love to see you travel to the neighbour country Finland! Damn covid just makes it quite hard right now.. Be safe Simon and keep content coming!
Imagine the poop after that burger...
holy shit he didn't go to mcdonalds
There is way more than 2500 calories in that burger I guarantee that. You can double that easy
Moose meatballs is top class
@beardmeatsfood needs to visit Sweden.
Great video Simon, how do you like Kiruna?
Is this a food lovers dreaaam
I read this as 1kg reindeer burger in the attic
That place was awesome!!
Am I the only one that has noticed how awesome Simon’s eyelashes are!?!? Thick and lush enough to make any girl jealous! 😆
Holy crap, that was probably 10,000 calories that you ate Simon.  You won't need to eat until next week.
Haha, amazing
You mean...extra queso?
Wait, he's trying something new??  Blokes a fucking weirdo when comes to food. No wonder he's not done anymore videos with Bald etc. He brought so many negative comments with him 😁
Wooo delicious, enjoy all man , thank you for your sharing,so funny you all ,
trying new things, im so proud of you Simon!!!
Seeing him eat besides Mcdonalds when he's with Harald and Bald make my eyes tearful.
would you eat mexican street food?
I got so hungry watching this!
Another sleek video.....................Excellent editing
1 heart attack with a side of gout
Why did I watch this before bed now I feel like having a massive cheese burger
Aren't people lovely when they are normal & cool & friendly. So rare these fucking days! None of the Covid-19 Mindfuck, although I did notice the 'hand sanitizer' in the shot. Food is great for breaking down barriers.
Derpy derp that’s a Swedish chef if I saw one
You eat thole reindeer and his buddy the pig
Omg! You are back! Why i didnt receive na notification. Huhu.. we miss you vlogging
Reindeer Smugglers you know what you need to do!
More like 4500 cals
Disappointed that he didn’t try the McDonald’s trick here!
They speak amazing English tbh. I’d love to go there for a holiday.
Those people are so friendly. Amazing
miss your vids simon !
So you just upload videos randomly nowadays and not really having a theme like before ( few videos of one area back to back)
I love how he’s travelled the world. Probably ate some amazing food but the standard is still set to McDonald’s 😂
You ate rudolph  😭
Fair play Simon, smashed that burger!
More of this, please!!!
Everyone was on his case when he wouldn't try out foods in Mexico. He just compensated for that.
that's the same place Naick and Kim travel went .. Lapland
That strand of cheese on his chin drove me mad lol. Moose is delish though😋
I am harold baldr and i am proud of you!
To the people like it's reindeer, meat is meat .... survival is survival
83% off sounds legit...
At least you decided to stay in the correct country during this lockdown
Those people running the shop seem really nice!
Big up lamb doner lovers
Very abrupt ending. Also how much.  Also location?
Nice one Simon, was looking for a new VPN and waited for a vid so I could sub via your link,  and earn you some moolah, cannot wait for this bloody lockdown to end, so we can all travel again!
Only reason you’ve uploaded this is because of people moaning that you’re arrogant toward other cuisines 😂
Please tell me exactly where this is Simon. I'm planning a trip to Sweden from Wales and the food looked amazing and the staff there were some of the friendliest I have ever seen
Thank god we missed you bro glad your safe god bless you bro and that new intro screen is fire brother!! 💪💪🙏
Sorry but for me Surfshark was hopeless as sky WiFi and MacBook does not mix and would not work no matter what I changed so had to get a refund and went back to Windscribe as I found them much better indeed
Fair play bro 😎
I ate reindeer pizza once. Reindeer tastes pretty nice.
Looks delicious 😋 Simon, awesome 👍🏻 Netflix 👍🏻 😁
This can't be real, it isn't McDonald's.
Brilliant read your messages son
2 mins 50 seconds and adverts!. Really Simon??
I would have smashed the granny out of that burger....
My neighbours cat would be better than McDonald’s
Seeing Simon eat something that isn't McDonalds Burger king KFC or subway actually brings a tear to my eye. Go on Simon son 🇬🇧
My shite tastes better than Mac Muck burgers
Did he pay for it?
Doner the reindeer in a kebab
Competitive eating at its finest 🍔🍔🍔
I’m a new subscriber Iv just watched few of your videos I’m now kinda gutted I ain’t been here since the start 😭 great content man keep it up
Were they out of unicorn meat?
Finally he’s back 🙌🏻
Great to see you eating local food! Finally
When you take 3000 calorie burger and diet coke 😂
The Shit that man had to take after eating that burger must have been intense! My God
Hi Simon, please post your video regularly. I really missed those before pandemic.   Look after yourself ;-)
Big boy I knew you would be able to smash both sandwiches up. 😂😂😂😂
I hope you finish your Polynesian tattoo one day
😬
where is this? looks awesome!
2,500 in that burger? That's the daily calorie intake for the average man just in one burger. That's insane.
Where in Northern Sweden is this? Umea? Lulea?
After that feast you would have been backed up for days....
What a great video! Made me so hungry! It’s ok to want a burger at 9:30am isn’t it haha. Good to see you uploading. Stay safe
The King is back 💪🏻
I can't wait for Simon to be in the TLC show
Just a touch of moose shit in it, Simon Wilson: AAhh mate that'd be fantastic cheers
I'm surprised you're eating it too because you do like Mexican food
Im suprised you follow the lockdown rules, you are the same person that travelled to mexico in the middle of the pandemic. You’re such a hypocrite its crazy.
You're the best! Love your videos! Love from Raleigh NC!
Is there anyway u can come to Nynäshamn while you are in sweden?
Looks incredible!  Got to love little restaurants.....always eager to please
You’d eat this. But nothing in Mexico but Burger King smh
where exactly is this?
What happened to being fussy and saying  I want to eat from McDonald's
You know the lockdown isnt actually real you can go out as long as you know your rights lol
2000 3000 calories not that bad sweer a large metor dominos is 2500
This is the most haram video I ever watched 😂😂😂😂
Are Heinz paying you as well as the rest of them🤔
Trending mateeeeee
Simon Wilson: aye
that food looks amazing
Wow there so friendly
Has anyone checked if Simon is still alive? There is a high chance of a stroke after this video 😂
Simon your the man!!!! that burger is a beast. puts any other burger to shame
His English better than Kane’s
Nice seeing you back Simon
Oh how I’ve missed that intro music
Those guys seem so so nice, I would just want to talk to them all day....
Angelica Larsson the truck driver was at this former city on her last video moving a crane ( there won't be two cities moving in Sweden)  , The last time I had Raindeer in Sweden was Christmas 86 remember Chernobyl had happened in the April of that year and the Raindeer came from the North. Personally, Id rather have Bernard Mathews finest. Great vlog Simon and remember Slimmers World 2 quid a week cheaper than weight watchers!
I was going to say Harold and Bald would be proud had u eaten like that in Mexico
when was zip wire in dubai done ? as sure i seen it dated today 04/02/2021
😂 Lol Simon you legend 😀
you should try some  taco's..  😂😁
SIMON WE MISSED YOU!!!
This place looks amazing, such a simple idea that works. quality sells
We’re watching Simon slowly become Gordon Ramsay
I can't believe Moose and Reindeer meat tastes good. That's unbelievable. Add a bit of tomato ketchup and you'll be sorted!
Am sure you're gonna hit a million subs this year
I'm just surprised that there's a naked flame in a petrol station.
I enjoy watching all of your videos Simon! they are really good.
"This is better than Mcdonalds" like every Restaurant should be😂
Love seeing your adventures. Please come to Denmark sometime!
Your old traveling Videos are saving me ❤ Love your NY to LA Trip, just saw the whole series in like 4 Days,   Amazing !!!
After simons eaten the burger Waiter: here is desert
Simons reaction after realising the moose and the reindeer were just an appetiser
Simon should’ve wore the ketchup outfit the whole video
Lol ketchup simon
That looks amazing, the food and the dining area. So cool.
Come to Västerås
Simon mate, come to the city Umeå north of Sweden if you want to have a good time 😁 ill gladly host you😇
I was thinking harald and bald would be proud and he mentions it👌
That burger was closer to 4000 calories than 2000. 9 slices of cheese, a packet of bacon, 4 beef patties. Yeah. 4,000.
They sponsored this video to help with your takeaways 🤣 meanwhile most the UK are unemployed and cannot afford to buy shopping
We'll Over Due Video 😎
WHEN U TAKING ME OUT FOR A MEAL SIMONE
OMG, I ate the exact same bun in the exact same place this summer when I went to Kiruna. It was delicious. And the people working there were really funny people. I think I actually prefer reindeer meat to moose though, though moose is good as well. But I think I had reindeer at least once per day while in Kiruna. Definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Kiruna, it's really worth it, really great food. Think the name of the place was Stejk. Greetings from the south of Sweden.
Any shit is better then McDonald's !!!! This Simon should avoid McDonald's !!!
1.17 to skip paid promo
Simon please do more Arctic and UK Vlogs, love them more than anything.
Meat is murder . Save it
raindeer meat would be awesome bro
How to determine if Netflix has a movie you wanna watch? First, ask yourself if you'd like to watch that movie. If the answer is yes - that movie isn't on Netflix.
Howbe on red dip dip 🤣🤣
No one: Simon: It looks like a Dona Kebam  It‘s Doner Kebap mate haha
5:59 ‘cheesus how many of them is there’
Great vid, someone is not getting crimbo presents this year 😆 cheers Andy. YNWA 😁😷😷
Loving the ketchup fit lad💯😂
Stick surf shark where the sun don’t shine, can’t watch videos with shameless plugs like that
I'll give it 2 months before Simon has moved to Kiruna!
SIMON U HAVE A MEXICO KETCHUP?

I missed that intro
HAROLD AND BALD 😂 👍

Went there in the weekend with my wifey after seeing this video it was an 8 hour drive for me and had to stop for raindeers 6 times but it was soo worth it! best burger in my life! 😀😋😋😋
Damn Im Swedish but we have nothing like that in the South :( Im gonna have to go up there and try it.
Which city is this?
Where is the location of this place ?
Was it better than crocodile
Go to switzerland
Love your content
Seems like a great country Sweden!
Does the king reply
Cool video Simon i didn't think you could finish that LOL .I couldn't finish that
A friend of mine I work with in North Sweden just posted me this video! For the last 6 winters I've worked an hours drive from this place. Every time we visit the town to buy supplies we always call in here and get a reindeer sub! It's a great place shame I'm not working up there this winter!
Man the reindeer sized turds he must have doing the next day...
Better than McDonalds 🤣  literally everything is better than McDonalds
Unsubscribe, look what His friend ‘ the hack ‘ is doing and what Simon is , no video for over a month and he’s gone from New York to la no money to ‘ me eating a burger ‘ even with covid good content is possible , shame
Simon Wilson eats reindeer and he is loving it
😁😁 Simon loves food😁😁
Love that you sampled the local food offerings instead of McDonalds this time 🙌🏼
I’ve had deer before so I know it’s good. But honestly anytime anyone uses McDonald’s as the standard I’m done. McDonald’s literally has the most shit food u can buy. At least in the US
Awww Simon we miss you!!!!
I am starvin
Simon is eating something that isn't fish and chips or McDonald's??
A bloody gorge fest love it
I would definately try a Rudolph/Moose burger! This made me hungry Mr Wilson! :)
Me, opens the video* Wild Ketchup Simon appears
4:10 - better than macdonalds LMAO...hi praise indeed...
the place looks great and the people who run it seem so nice,definitely on my bucket list
Extra cheese! 😂😂🧀 Food looked amazing!
This is an example where a comments section has made someone a better person. Possibly the only time this has ever happened.
4:10 "This is better than McDonalds" isn't really a meaningful statement. 😂
I was there on March 20'...It's a very EXPENSIVE place to go as a 22 yo student..But it's worth the full experience
Huge ass buger with no ketchup? I’m so confused
♥️Thank you so much this is nice 👍        Big Street Food  🍱!!!!
Yesssssss I'm glad your back mate !!!!
Nice one bro, watching in Ibiza as always
Do collab with indigo traveller
Welcome back bro. Missed you
It's 9:39am and I'm now craving a burger. Thank you Simon! It looked incredible!
Finally discovering McDonald’s is dog shit compared to independents.
This was a sick video
Which one are you tweedledee or tweedledum?
I was here a few weeks back as well, ended up being stuck for 3 days because of a massive snow storm which caused the trains to be cancelled for 3 days, made a lot of new friends that were all stuck as well, absolutely unforgettable trip
This has already been posted boring
Mate I miss your video's can't wait for more content from you once this lockdown is over
Simon eating Rudolph lol stay safe dude
Simon, bald , harlod need to go on a Noone challenge!
I'm missing the British accent 😀 besides that I'm wondering how many animals ended up on his plate 😁
the heart attack channel
Bald doesn't like filming while eating food  I think😂
Simon: One kilo? Take my money!
I’ve just spent 11 minutes watching Simon eating food 😂

To be fair... anything is better than McDonalds.  I had Reindeer before but never Moose. If i'm ever there I'll have to try that.
Where is Harald and Bald 🤔😷😆
In the thumbnail you look like Ph1lza
Underrated Simon comment.....  'I prefer the moose to the reindeer to be honest' 🤣 😂
Simon fair play to ya, for putting that burger away.
Yet my man won’t eat a taco in Mexico. He confused, fo sho.
Mention of Herald and bald makes me go back to their Mexican vlog...AGAIN
Bro come to northern Canada and hunt a moose with us. It’ll change your life.
The new camera is sooo shaky anyone else think? I miss the canon man! Love the videos dude and I hope one day our paths cross and we can do a video together! I’m just starting out tho! And my videos need a lot of work! Love your style and confidence dude can’t wait to travel again
Ah yes finally a video to give me hope to live lol
Who was waiting for a video ??
Moar videos
The food looks amazing... I've got to go get one, as Soon as it's safe to travel there. "There's only hunting and fishing here..an burgers" sounds like fucking paradise.
Hi
Love all of the vids 💯💙
What great people
Um, if you have 3 or more devices on a network then you have a Private Network. So why pay some stupid company extra money to make yourself a Virtual Private Network when you can do it yourself for Free!
you should have given them the empty burger container and said they forgot to put a burger in there - could have gotten a free on to go i bet
Thanks for this simon... Good to see you're back 🤓✌️
Wait you ate street food nooo way !!!
Imagine Matt Stonie came here
Woohoo portion size Simon! Crumbs I think your bowels must have worked overtime the next day!
Just another budget gordan ramsey
lol love your vids
I hope you scheduled a cardiogram as soon as you got back to england.
Now I'm hungry!
Would love to see you with Herald and Bald
Ayyy finally mate I thought you was never coming back 😂
Simon: Reads out whole menu. "They have steak burgers, steak butty, steak and fries, steak, steak, steak. Wonder what I will have?" "REINDEER" 😂😂😂😂
Time to hit a million subs!!!
Simon makes people repeat themselves like he's wearing a wire with the FBI listening lmaooo
Simon you got me really hungry. Im thinking i can eat 2 of those if i was really hungry
save Myanmar\ save Burma reject military save AUNG SANN SU KYI
That burger looked so good. Would love to visit Scandinavia.

Simon vs food You greedy pig 😂  did i hear right it was better than mcdonalds 🙀😂 looking forward to seeing more videos at some point 👍
I am so jealous right now of that burger. 🤤

Great Video!!!
That is one thing I love about sweden is the hospitality is amazing!! Great video simon. Food looked incredible. I need to go back to sweden now as I only went for 2 days last time

We all miss President Trump :(
Had one late night in Vancouver totally smashed but it was more like a regular burger. 10/10 delicious though!
love the video, Simon. Please put out more!
YES! At last! I've been waiting for ages!  Me: Mom I want Ketchup! Mom: We have Ketchup at home Ketchup at home:  Edit: just finished watching. That food place was awesome! From the videos, the people in Sweden are nice!
I've missed your videos!
Awesome outfit Simon. Styling
Love the Ketchup Outfit
Traveling or no traveling, please upload more Simon! even just to update us on how you’re doing throughout UK lockdown! Hope all is well and that you can get back to what you love doing most in the near future, traveling Skint!🙏🏼

More like 8000calories
Being in lockdown is driving you absolutely tomatoes mate..
No shit Sherlock it's better than McDonalds
Rudolph does not approve 😂😂😂 You smashed that burger Simon 💪💪💪
Watching this at 1am and it's making me really hungry, why do i do this to myself lol.
Simon your videos are always great! Can't wait for new content
And then Simon slept for a week!
Love u Simon!
*That looks so good* 😮
The legend returns
Nice people there
Who needs a vaccine when you have ketchup! Stay safe and healthy out there!
lol you love your ketchup
Where’s Harold
I would go to extreme lengths to try this food wow 🤩
Proud of you mate.. for a guy that hates streetfood (mexico) .. to now trying new things.. well done!
They seem like very nice people who work there
omggggg ahah i hope you were able to digest it well after :))))) (In Iran, when we eat massive feasts and heavy fatty starchy food, we drink dough (yoghurt drink with mint) to aid digestion afterwards or tea with a saffron infused rock candy thing on a stick - i highly recommend it or even peppermint tea after a heavy meal, it'll really take away the heaviness afterwards!
HOPE YOU IS ALL WELL AND GOOD AND HEALTHY. YNWA
Is no one going to talk about how he ordered a Steak Sub than ate a 850g burger after?
Man vs Food!
The people working in that little take away restaurant are incredibly friendly. Sweden looks amazing.
Good to see you making an effort with local cuisine after all the people complaining on balls channel about when you in Mexico. While I didn’t agree with people complaining as you should be you I am loving to see you do it
Yes a new video
They're so friendly.
I would eat lol 😂
Heinz plz sponsor Simon✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️✌️
Great video Simon
Nice 2 see you back
YESSS my wednesday is so much better

How much was the burger simon
Eats a whole kg burger but at least you got your Fitbit on 😂😂
Such a great video
Don’t Let BeardMeetsFood see this  He will completely obliterate the current record 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 You know he’ll try and have 4 of those 950g burgers & complain about the mushrooms 🍄
Wow im hungry now
Best intro on YouTube 😍
I AM SURE IV SEEN YOU EAT REINDEER ON ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR VIDS MIGHT BE WRONG LOL
Reminds me of when Baldr ate a similar burger in Athens -- you guys can trade stories...
I’m so happy to see a new video from Simon. It’s been way to long

That burger looked so big how did you finish it @simonwilson
That Burger looks scrumptious
I love your videos, but don't harm yourself just for a video. Take care of your health mate! I'd love to see many more adventures similar to the U.S. one, it was truly amazing and inspirational to see how you connect with people and survive on your own without money.
Yes Simon clicked straight away great to see another upload :)
Watching this gave me indigestion... I had to pop two gaviscons soon after.
Hi simon
Half of Mexico hating this video. 😂
Long live Simon Wilson. Hooray!!! Best channel on YouTube!!! Thank you for letting us tag along.
You wouldn't eat street tacos in Mexico.  So why Sweden 🇸🇪 🤔.  Looks like its missing double cheese and extra extra mayo haha
Where is this burger obtained exactly?! Bucket list.
Did he say Sweden is moving? I’m kinda confused lol someone plz explain
That looks awesome
Simon Rickman man vs reindeer
“This is better than Mac Donald’s!”
Harald and bald prob near died watching you eat street food lol
this was awesome !!!
Good to c u back with a new vid ,, I'm  feeling bloody hungry now 🤣  stay safe mate 👍
Taste like beef to be honest. Reindeer "I ain't no Cow don't disrespect me like that".
unsubscribing ... not the amazing videos youre known for and other channels have surpassed you even with covid , one vid after more than a month? and it was boring af , shame
FairPlay id have struggled to eat that ! Looked amazing I’m starving now haha
Just had a cheeky Wednesday roast dinner and now want a burger!!! Lucky bastard,,,,food looks amazing.. Chris,Liverpool,yes that Liverpool...keep up the good eating my friend.....
This new series of Man Vs Food is not as good without the cheering crowd of cheering Americans
The most sharp-ended video
You should maybe visit Iceland
🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊🙊
The fellas English is remarkable. He speaks & explains stories better than myself.
It’s good to see you back Simon 😁
In the North Pole only Santa’s Reindeer’s are safe...who knew?
That's amazing eat the full burger but first finished off a cheese steak nice job Simon keep up the good work !!!!
Video starts at 1:30
What town is that in?
First tobas video is up now Simons😂
You need to go to finland. Amazing street food at the docks in helsinki
You’ve already had reindeer in Norway did you not?
You think the McDonalds trick would work for an 850 burger?  😂  "I was here about a half hour ago, and you seem to have forgotten an 850 burger..." LOL
Upload more even if it’s just vlogs!
Eating animals is wrong Simon Wilson I'm not going on I have a brain
The intro song on your videos gets stuck in my head all day, love it 😂 hooked on the no money challenge videos great stuff lad keep it up
I wish I had this burger! Great place to visit! *booking flight to Sweden 🇸🇪 *
Oh I really thought there was more content but it ended at 11:42. Good video, I was glued watching it
Didn't try the McDonalds trick on them then? XD
For real, man, your video has done a backflip, snapped the bad guy's neck, and saved my day. I'm so tired and sleepy that, at first,  I thought that you said at 6:40 "I'm gonna eat it with an iPhone four" instead of "with a knife and fork
Did you just eat a meal without ketchup?! 😱😆
Oh now he wants to eat street food...
No ketchup I'm impressed..keep them coming..💪
What is the name of the city you visited with good street food?
Best notification seeing you've uploaded this. Keep them coming literally sat up rewatching your no money trips this past month after working 40+ hours x x
I want to see Simon get a free delivered maccies. I was in earlier and you missed a big mac meal...can you bring one to my house?
i miss the no money daily upload challenges!
Big mac got 508 calories xd
I wish the was something like that in Manchester or Liverpool I world go
What a neat place !!!!
bonne appétit simon
Hope you're well Simon, glad to see you uploading videos despite the current circumstances
Perfect! I’ll be in Kiruna at this gas station in 2 weeks and I’ll try this!
Si-Man vs Food incoming
I wish I was pals with Simon!!
so i am now in the kitchen cooking a burger cheers simon haha
The people working at the street food place were very polite and friendly. McDonalds will now be bringing out a Mc Reindeer Burger now that they know Simon likes it.
Did you spend the whole day just eating there hahaha
Two days into a low carb  blood sugar diet, drinking water and eating tofu and vegetables and THIS pops up in my recommendeds!  Simon, you enjoyed it for both of us..  :D
Nothing I’ve missed more than Simon and his vlogs
Oh man, now you make me hungry. I need fries and ketchup and burger omggg🍟🍔🥤
hey bro can u do a vid in alaska in the artic circle or try nunavut canada if ur up for it i’d love to see that yerno da merererer
That looked amazing,  I now fancy a burger 🍔 😋
Simon, you HAVE to wear that ketchup costume on some of your travels! Maybe Bald would like a go in it?!?!
I have a challenge for you! Once the virus settles down, you should challenge yourself and try to travel to every country in the world, even if you have been there before. I believe you could do it! It may take awhile, but you should try! Or even if you do 100 countries! Either or, I would love to see those type of videos! Maybe you could stay a week in each country! Thanks for reading, bye!
When I took my 7 year old daughter to finnish lappland skiing a friend cooked moose the first night. The second night we had reindeer I said just try it if you don't like it I will finish it thinking she would be squeamish about rudolf. She wolfed it down and said that was far better than the moose. This was 20 years ago.
That burger looked amazing 😍
Glad to see you back! Simon does a food challenge!
Hope you’re safe in lockdown love the vids
love all your videos plz do more
Heinz ketchup is bar far the best. 👍👍👍
Loved meeting you today you can in to my petrol station u are so polity thanks made my day meeting you love your videos
Watching this one later :)  have been looking forward to the next Vlog! I’ve just uploaded my latest Ibiza Vlog and have to admit for this Vlog I stole your intro music
Your videos are awesome! I love watching them!
Better than McDonalds..to be fair, everything’s better than McDonald’s! You need to expand your pallet and explore more options and you’ll realize that.
I get that he is now a travelling blogger!!!! But travelling while there is a worldwide pandemic!!!
Happy days
Nice to see you back simon

Hooray! You are back!

I love ketchup @Simon Wilson
Simon, aged 8, writing his Christmas list:  “Dear Santa, I wrote earlier and ordered a LOT of reindeer. I just got my order and a large reindeer meal with ketchup was missing. Can I come to the North Pole and pick it up? And no, I didn’t keep the receipt. Assuming the answer is yes, happy days!”
Woop simon uploaded
does the legend reply?
Simon please come to texas  We miss you a lot  Reply to this message if you want video ideas. Can't wait for next vid  👍👍🙏
The people working on the stall seem so nice and friendly!
So good to see you back Simon!!! Missed this theme tune !!!! Stay safe
Yes! Been waiting for Simon to give us another video!!
Oh my god I screamed when I realised you had posted lol 😂 I love the vids !!
As a Half British raised in Japan raw horse meat and beef and fish are delicacies. Can't have it due to the COVID19 pandemic. And the ketchup outfit was a crack up.
Long story short.... Oh hell no, he can't eat anymore!
So whats the address of that petrol station then?
He's eating moose, meanwhile I'm at home eating a bowl of cereal as I watch him
Scamdemic.
Happy Day ❤️

Simon must be finding it hard to carry out his job at the moment with the lockdown. But he’s still trying to give us the good content. Thanks very much mate. Can’t wait for the next video
