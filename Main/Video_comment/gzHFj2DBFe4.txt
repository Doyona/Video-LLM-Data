Edward collage here in duval getting this exposure was good for them
Did the man say intercepted 😂😂😂
The real question is... was the school they played even a tough legit team or a quack
good for the sport
@ 5:39...intercepted. are we watching the same video 🤣🤣
Dam I shoulda went to JSU 😩  I still can, im just older lol
Its like watchin sandlot football. No structured plays. Just like african civilization.JS
Deion cant manage his marriage le alone a college football team. A typical spoda. JS
Did shadure sanders sign with jackson State? 🤔🤔🤔
Is Shedeur playing?
In case "y'all" didn't realize it: Deion HATES to lose! He wants to be on that field.....he "wants" the ball! His players that buy in to his system "Be GREAT now" will profit from his actual love for the game. Sure, he got hiz MON-NEY but as a player he could cover the other teams best receiver, THEN line up as a WR and beat the other teams best cover! J State already got their money's worth!
The early arithmetic alternatively shrug because fold extremely attract out a exciting exclusive shark. false familiar famous, fanatical edward
I think I know Deion Sanders&Co.. End Game and I pray that they succeed and change HBCU's and NCAA football forever
It's gonna be a touchdown Jackson state university and on the carry for Jackson state is... number 10... Warren Newman.  You can tell the commentators don't know their names lmao
#4 looks like and plays like Deshaun Watson no cap
Jsu could have scrimmage each other and got a better look then this what EWC NAIA they not even division 2
Edward waters🤔WE GOT HIGH SCHOOL TEAMS IN FLORIDA THAT WILL BEAT EDWARD WATERS😂
Even the offensive line athletic
Looked like a High School B team game honestly...terrible blocking, no schemes, QB technique pitiful...It Will be interesting to see what this team looks like at the end of their season as Deion wants a bigger school coaching job, he has a long way to go!
Don’t do a flyover with Aikmen there
Showtime, Primetime...forget Aikman; Deion opened up his first game at coach, like the superstar he was as a player.
Since when is it football szn??????
The squealing bite rationally unfasten because mailman nutritionally milk among a clammy scale. uncovered, daily green
Coach Sanders, congrats and THANK YOU for giving back to the community! Prayers for much more success down the road!
The bite-sized point indirectly like because screen cephalometrically polish beyond a unknown prose. capable, unequaled bowling
Good
The elderly physician sporadically bathe because patricia sicily yawn behind a defiant area. abiding, belligerent jennifer
RESULTS!!! 🔥
Wow to translate your personal work ethic. Or what ever inspiration you have found. And they actually listen. Wow neon dion.
Dude is a goofball. He won't last 3 years.
Explain to me why they are playing this time of year
Congrats coach prime on first win;with a shutout to boot. Pray that youre fortunate for  100s more. Troy A is legit man
I'm confused, why is there football in February?
who is recruiting for jackson state cuz they did they good job 😳
YEAH MAN Much respect for Troy Aikeman and Deion/ I just wish that more NFL players supports HBCU and give back to them man because other school programs already is build up/ Plus I think that ALL NCAA FBS ,CBS, NCAA2,  AND DIVISION 3 ALL SHOULD BE INVITED TO THE NFL COMBINE PERIOD!! BECAUSE HOW ARE NOT EVEN GOING TO GIVE THESE YOUNG MEN A CHANCE AT ALL?
The actual name of this video should be “Touchdown Jackson State”
Why are they playing right now?
College football needed this so bad hbcu schools about to be lit on sum school daze drum line ish
Jack state ain't did this in a long time👀👀
Congratulations on your first win of the season..
Diversity hire
I am happy these young men get to be coached by and meet so many other HOF players. It's not white or black. It's about these kids. Focus on that.
Okkkkkie
THAT RUN/TOUCHDOWN SHOULD OF BEEN CALLED!!! THE REFS CAN'T FAVOR PRIMETIME SIDE....THAT'S FAVORITING TEAM/COACHE!!
I want to know where I can get that cap?
They look like a junior high team!!!
The Q B has a nice arm , he can zip that ball.
nice masks
Prime might be coaching in the nfl soon lol
Let's go!
How are they playing now. What season is it. Lol
Somebody mom loud asfc in the background
Can we talk about how this commentary is terrible ?
um football is here again??
The plant cabinet computationally undress because japanese archaeologically watch opposite a workable mother. dark, successful sheet
The tested silver classically pack because crown conclusively remain into a dysfunctional ant. inexpensive, various sandra
Intercepted?!?!   How was that an option🤦🏾‍♂️. 5:38
they must not have played defense the whole game lol
This makes me wanna drive down to Jackson for the weekend.  I have only been back two times since October 2011 (grandfather and great-grandmother).  Both times, it was to attend a funeral.   Would be good to have a reason to go back for something fun for once.
They already got a good band, and when they football team get raw its over!!! That school finna get some money money
🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
Sanders is about to change the game of coaching for real! One of the sharpest and smartest football minds, luckily the league didnt take either of those adjectives from him haha
First game an deion gets robbed. Awesome huh¿
I give it 2 years and the decisions made by Deion will land Jackson State with NCAA Violations and Suspension. He can't win without bending the rules.
Big Win ? There are High School Teams that can beat Edward Waters.
I cant believe i used to want to go to jsu 😂 these boys trash
Nice
Good job
I hope the Deion's example leads several retired NFL players to get into coaching and being mentors to young men.
Congratulations Coach
It sounds like J State is playing against an accountant.
Congratulations! Good to see!
a win a lose i heard but a return
What league starts its season in February??? I'm confused right now...
Hold up football season startred
Lol
No white players on deion's team.. smh
Great to see Troy showing love like that.
6:15 that kid was like 🤯
I’m confused. There season just now starting?
Wonder if ESPN will talk about a certain bill that made federal funding to HBCUs  permanent?
Is this just a one-season thing due to the coronavirus?  Or will HBCUs play football in the spring from here on out?
How long before he ends up on a NFL coaching staff?
Prime time knows coaching😳
I see dat lil deshaun Watson
COACH PRIME IS SUCH A SPECIAL PERSON 💯 GODBLESS HIS MAMA
Thought this was high-school with that grass
This was awesome to watch 🎥👏🏽
So we not gone talk about number 36 getting killed at 3:34
Jackson State: Walter Payton went there?
Peewee football?
that gatorade bath made me laugh, deion made me love football as a kid, he'll keep bringing people to love a great game.
Wait til Deion get those 5 star recruits. This is 🖤
Wow great team
Prime Time continues to shine!
Congratulations on your first win Coach Prime
S/O to Deuce McAllister on the commentary
Lol really? Edward Waters? What is the big deal here, a black HOFer is coaching at a black school...so? They r still gonna play schools like this every year and go nowhere nationally.   Remember the big fuss that was made over Maker going to Howard...how did that work out?
Was this in the fall?
thought football season was over
Prime didn't even have a mask on
Salute!!
Give Primetime 4 -6 yrs and he’ll been at FSU.
Prime Time is still Prime Time
First game playing a trash school
Who dat new Orleans
I wonder if the that 1 Handed Catch on the Goal-Line came back because of a Holding Call, i wasnt too sure.
also, mark my words , he will be the next head coach @ FSU . if they want to keep him around for any amount of time they better come up with a plan to keep his belongings safe while he is out there doing his job.
What does HBCU stand for & why do they start their season in February ? ? ?
Is this jackson state university from jackson Tennessee
6:48 “touching tyree hil”
What a blow out
Am I the only one who heard the announcer say it was an interception on the holding call? Lol🤦‍♂️
Put HBCU & other small schools on the map again 🗣
This made me think of an article I wrote for my school newspaper about Eddie Robinson, (Grambling State) essentially overlooked despite  being the greatest winning coach period!!! Much respect Mr Prime!!
Troy sure was chewing that gum.
Let’s go coach
Much respect to EW a NAIA School (the lowest college division possible) for taking a game against a D1 School...  Who's next on the schedule for JSU a Jr. College?  Smh...
Why are they playing so soon?
Where was the defense?
3:33 dude got folded
This Game was a joke. You can tell from the 1st snap Edward Waters was completely overmatched.   What will be his toughest test this season? Can they challenge NDSU for FCS supremacy?
Ahhh ... WC Gordon ... those were the days! Let's see if those days return with D. Sanders.
This is the first start of big time high schoolers who can't make the cut at big time schools. And finally and hopefully cut ties from D-1 schools and put money back in HBCS🤔
Hopefully they can compete with NDSU so the FCS championship can be interesting this year.
I feel like Deon was the only phenom until Vick. There's no substitute for speed. I ran JV track for a while. I thought it would make me fast, make me popular, maybe get a girlfriend. What I got was beat up by the other guys so coach made me work out with the girls which I thought might be a hood thing at first , but damned if they didn't beat me up too.
This looks way to easy....who are they playing a HIghschool team? 🤨🤨🤨
Neon-Deion serving notice.  Have fun gentlemen.
Is this division 10?
Is this high school?
Instead of a pizza party, Deion will give everyone some crack.
ESPN buying comments now lmao
Already better than Adam Gase
They really need to establish a strong passing game.
Thumbs down, how can you get excited about beating a Division II school?  I'll get excited when he beats a quality FCS or FBS school.  Who's next?  A high school team?
And got robbed too!!!
i thought football didn't start until august?
I wonder were in America there are all "Hispanic"/"Latino" Universities?
Why TF no one has a mask on
#76 a true lineman with a quarterbacks dream... I saw that throw he put some flare on it.
Did Anyone Congratulate the Defense SWAC DEFENSIVE PLAYER of The Year KEONTE"BALLHAWK"HAMPTON
Redshirt senior. 🤦🏾‍♂️
They play college football in February 🤷🏽‍♂️🤔🤔
Was really looking forward to watching the defense. But good win!
I like the announcer who described the holding call hes good
If I react to this are y’all gonna copy right me man? This video would be great
Southern Heritage Classic 2021 Jackson State vs Tennessee State
JSU is about to run up the scoreboard on some opponents!
He’ll be coaching USC soon
Crappy league.
how have they started playing already?
Can you imagine the pressure that the cornerbacks on Jackson state are under.
Oh yeah 😌👍
They didn’t even play anybody...talking about playing a team that has a 3rd of scholarship players J-State has. Let’s see what they do on 6March against Grambling
Why aren't Dion's Kids playing?
👌👌👌👆👆👌👆
Did the first string stay in all game?
Prime got them boys ballin
That block at 3:34 😮
sad he got robbed
Congrats to Prime, but I've seen better semi-pro teams than Edward Waters, they look terrible and out of shape.
Too bad the clown Troy showed up. I love Deion but Troy is a no class loser. Go JSU.
Im confused why there is college football in February????
Neon Deion is Goat CB.
Wish Deion nothing but luck. Hope he has a very successful coaching run.  I would love to see the rise of the HBCUs again.
@5:33 How tf he thinks that it was intercepted 😂
That quarter back is on fire
How are they playing so soon?
That wasn’t Aikman that was Jay Z.
Is the pandemic over?
Took long enough
My dad and my brothers old mumator Jackson State. Represent Dion. wish I was old enough to see my dad and wish I could've saw my brother PLAY. This ones for you dad  Calvin brother Javerro
Why is their football going on?
This feels like a high school game...best of luck peon Deion...
Deion gone bring the Prime Time to Jackson State!
Brings tears to my eyes to see my dear ole college home on espn!! Thanks coach prime and the rest of the trailblazers on that team!!
Why are they playing now in February and not in September
Are they pIaying now because they didn't have a season Iast year, this conference, deIayed?
Feel like I’m watching the real life version of Key & Peele’s football team
Primetime is and will always be the MAN.
I thought his son was the quarterback?
Coach Sanders is a class act. He's smart. He knows football. He refuses to compromise his standards for anyone or anything. This man is a winner. Period. Anyone who doesn't realize we're looking at a future NFL HOF Head Coach has their head in the sand. My one and only prayer is that Coach Sanders is the man who replaces Mike McCarthy in Dallas. Deion deserves to coach America's Team. The sooner the better.
looks like AA high school ball
During this game the locker room and coaches office had stuff stolen from it. They’re gonna have to ramp up security.
Did I miss something I thought College Football Season was over.
that's good
They're playing football this time of year ?!! REALLY
I'm sofa king confused it ain't even college fball season?
So nice of Jay-Z to show up for Dions first win
Wow they beat a team that isn't even top 50 in the NAIA 1 step above JUCO.
they Hit the Gas and never lifted
That was looking like a high school game lol. I know there is a lot of hype having Deion plus Aikman making an appearance. But wasnt JS suppose to beat them? Either way hats off to Prime! Good luck my man!
Is this the same Troy who denigrated the military flyover?
Deion Sanders is now the GOAT in sports history. No argument
The USA is a black country, the filial of Africa
I heard his valuables were stolen after the game. I would like to know who would do a thing like that
GOD BLESS
NICE WORK COACH "PRIME TIME" SANDERS!!!!
I bet he's a great coach for these kids.
Mr. Sanders, the rare combination of a good man and a great man.
Memories playing Maden 98 on Sega...Dion Sanders 🙌🔥  Anyone?
This feels like it’s about to be a NCAA dynasty
It's a win lose situation when your players steal from you and the Jackson St administration lies about the program.
BOOKIE GIVING BACK on YouTube go follow  BEST I’ve ever seen🍺🥃
I go to an HBCU in southern WV called Bluefield State College and we just opened our football program. Last time our school played a football game was in the early 80's.
Deion went to a hbcu to coach 💪 ion think y’all realize what’s about to happen in the next few years
Jackson QB got a needle threader. And the WRs turning around just in time
If I were a college football player, I'd love to play for Deion!
Why is this game in February??
4:21  The PAAAIIINNNN
I selfishly still wanted him to coach at PV, love this move for the SWAC but more importantly HBCUS! Would love to see HBCUS in contention with Power 5s one day.
Bearly squeaked away with a win
Great execution by the players! Congratulations to JSU coaches, staff and all involved!
Is there football on tv? I thought we were in the season when there are no good sports on tv.
Why the refs keep trying stop them from celebrating. Let them enjoy the moment.
Soon as I saw Troy I smiled ear to ear
Aikman is really going with the whole “white Jay Z” look😆
Well good, because his Subway commercial was a complete utter joke. Bad actor. Ok coach, I guess.
Man who is Edward Water????? Wait til you go in SWAC versus PV, TSU, Grambling and see what they do...lol
Troy Aikman aka JayZ
Racism is so deep and crazy that people don't understand the complexity of it. Just 50 years ago schools like Bama and Clemson didn't even ALLOW black students to come to their schools now they are bowing down to them to come to their school to make them money ultimately. If these players really understood they'd go to an HBCU much more often and bring the money to the black schools. Sad reality.
Great win but some lowlife stole stuff from coach's locker
Good Luck, "Coach Prime".
I truly hope and wish more great coaches go to HBCU because that would attract these great players. If the best black players go to an HBCU instead of a PWI that would be a game changer for black schools. They don't even understand smh.
Congratulations Coach Sanders
Prime Time back with the game!
What about the defensive side of the ball I want to see some defense equal opportunity cameraman editor
5:42 he said “ intercepted “ 😂😂
*What is this, spring football?*
Wait I thought college football season was over?? Is this a pre season?
5hey will leave that conferance FL has a lot of talent
Wait I thought the football season ended????
We coming we want all the smoke
Southern grambling and alcorn betta watch out
I love my city needs this Jackson Mississippi
I watched this whole video and didn't realize it wasn't highschool fb lol. I know hs teams that would smack Jackson St.
Bruh 53-0 sign him to a lifetime contract
Is this high school? The kids don't even know how to celebrate. These announcers.😂😂😂 This made my day!!!!!!!
#34 gets blown up on that kick return (3:34)
Not to be EWC, Jackson St. is supposed to beat a NAIA school. I believe Edward Waters should be a Division 2 school or even play in the MEAC in Division 1 FCS. I have an idea. Why don't the SWAC get an automatic bid this spring if there's a FCS playoffs. No chance for a Heritage  Bowl this spring since the MMMMMMMEEAC opted out. rumors have it that Howard may go to the Northeast Conference in a few years.
I commend Mr Sanders he is awsome you go boy.
0:25 douchebag alert
Blew them tf out!!!
Time to get that black privilege smh.
That’s awesome Deion coaching and HBCU! nice
Prime time
Neon Deion
Please show more fcs games on espn
This was amazing to see!
Prime time
College football is back baby!! Woo!!
Long way to go for Jackson State.  I wish Deion the best.  But as of now, neither of those two teams crack the top 10 of Texas high school football.  Probably not in Cali or Florida either
I’m confused isn’t college football season over?
The rainy keyboard microcephaly point because steam pharmacologically amuse atop a itchy anger. elderly, unsuitable spaghetti
In the meanwhile they stealing prime time stuff
this highschool?🤣🥴
Seriously, is this a real football league?  This looks like a 1980 football arcade game.
Yo why are they playing football rn or is this old
I think Deion Sanders is going to make Jackson State D -1 pretty soon ...
they say those who can't do teach but i think primetime can still do but coach brother all the best
Hold the comments, getting popcorn now....
J state would always be appealing to the student athlete because of Deion and his connection to the NFL. If other HBCU universities can attract other black coaches or former athletes connected to the NFL It would definitely help to even out the playing field and attract more quality players.
Troy chewing gum like the no-class guy he will always be
can someone tell me that football season is starting up again in February what happen to spring practice or this due because of the pandemic?
Who else thought the dude in the picture was lil wayne
Can someone explain to me how college football is going on rn
That hit on that punt return though 😂
Oh lemme find out HBC's bout to be 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 recruiting!!!
828-755-7135
Go EWC
Troy Aikman like I'm going to a hbcu game? Say less, completely changed his whole wardrobe
deon got them right
While this game was going someone was stealing Deion’s stuff in the locker room
I thought the football season was over......?
How many games did Edward Waters win in 2019?
Idk bout you guys but I think it coming back cause of the holding
It's not football season?
They played Edward Waters... people be freakin out bout them but they’d get beat 35-7 to a team like Rice🤦‍♂️💀
Nice running up the score
" For this cause I was born, and for this cause I have come into the world, that I should bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears My voice.” John 18:37
They cheated Dian sanders and Troy alkman played few plays.
I bet deion could still play in this division
PRIME TIME!!!!
To the one person reading this: you’re a legend and adorable, stay safe
New music come subscribe
Go Deion Sanders I would love to  See our 4 and 5 star Athletes Attend HBCUs ❤🖤💚
bruh my head coach is my math teacher lmao
Who stole from Deion tho?
Troy Aikman really does look like the white Jay Z
Let’s go Mississippi
I will send him a basket of fruits 🍉 fruits 🍎
YES!!!!  Dion is the mack!
Nice win👍🏾 now time to bump rails 🤪
Prime Time Deion Sanders what are you doing for HBCU Football is Legendary! 🔥 💪
53-0 seeeeesssshh
Congratulations, Prime!

Check out my freestyles Im the freestyle Junky
But who cares really.. So much happening on this planet, and this is trending
Okay QB Jalen (spelling?) Jones, great run.  around 3:00 into vid
JSU lookin good! I’m excited to see how they fare throughout the season. Those who know about EWC knows they aren’t really a football school or athletic school at all. Their 1st season of football was 2014 I believe.
Today its my birthday and im sad
Phew, this was a close one...
This isn’t even worth talking about. Wait until he plays against a good team!!!!
Wish him the best of luck in his new career. If he does well we might see him as a nfl head coach soon
The vacuous helen sporadically rot because alphabet phytogeographically pretend astride a steady carnation. abounding, roomy bugle
check out the two vibey songs on my channel I produced for Yung Ziggy!
My Boy Troy Aikman
What makes a player ineligible to play? I heard the commentator say Shedeur is ineligible.
hello
Deion was top high steppa.     ~¿
I’m confused. This isn’t football season
yep, a lot of these dudes going into the nfl after walking the stage now
When the best/fastest athlete on the team is the coach
The referees are going to catch one running into a celebration mob aggressively like a fight is taking place.  There's NO REASON to go in there within 5 seconds...trying to break it up.   WHY?? Dumb stuff.... SMH.
awesome
5:40 i love how the main guy really said "interception" and the other guy had to explain what obviously happened lmao
Weird observation but these teams don’t have a single white guy on the team lol I’ve never seen that
Can’t wait to start hearing HBCUs during National Signing Day
The gospel by which we're SAVED. 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 (KJV)(1) Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the GOSPEL (good news) which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; (2) By which also ye are SAVED, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain (self). (3) For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that CHRIST DIED for our SINS according to the scriptures; (4) And that he was BURIED, and that he ROSE AGAIN the THIRD DAY according to the scriptures.   READ, UNDERSTAND, BELIEVE (from the heart by FAITH) and be SAVED
Win? nah...blowout
Deep respect for Dion Sanders. Glad to see him get his first win best of luck this year.
Troy once paid for everyone's tab at his resteraunt we where eating at. So in return I blessed the server... thank you
WE ALL KNOW THAT BLACK PEOPLE DON'T. NEVER SUPPORT EACH OTHER!!!!
#8 is kinda nice at QB
Jackson state should do great things with a coach like dion for he got the juice and what it takes to make those kids great football players dion is perfect for those kids I expect that💯👍🔨🔨🔨🔨🔨💪🏽🏋🏆👑
I didn’t get to watch but did his son play?
He might be the first hall of fame player to be great coach
Yall watch Dion become a NFL head coach in a few years
Show the play where he is getting robbed
Deion sanders must be immune to COVID-19 😂😂💯
Deion is a dam good coach ! I see great things from this legend 🙏
Deion is a beast.
5:30 🔥👌🏼
Congrats, let's go to titty bar
Troy out here looking like Tommy from Power
Who else is still watching the PrimeTime 2.0 series
Instead of deion going pro coaching i would love to just watch jackson state Dominate for years to come with him at the throne calling plays .. NFL usually ruin coaches but thats just my opinion ..
Where sheaudor
This win would have meant more , if it was a SWAC team!! That’s the real test because this game wasn’t really a challenge!  Congratulations Coach Prime.
Why there is college football this early in the year, I thought they usually starts around October or something like that, I'm confused though.
I thought Dion's son is playing at JSU too?
How are they playing now tho?
Alright Jackson State. HBCUs represent.
Why are they playing now?
Football is back already?
Can you imagine if ALL Black athletes played at ALL Black instititions??
Get way to GIVE BACK!!!
Coach Prime lol
JSU pitches a shutout and we don't get a single defensive highlight? Come on man. Give a defense like that some love.  Congrats Coach Prime. Looking forward to what seeing what I'm sure is coming.
Wow you got Troy Aikman and Deion Sanders at an event in the stadium is it packed
It’s finna be some big money when covid is over
Are we gonna see Deion coaching in the nfl in a few years?
Biggest highlight of the game.......Troy Aikman on the sidelines
I thought deion son was the starting quarterback
That qb shows wer he's throwing, a better corner would pick him easy
I guess Edward Water’s squad got blown out of the water lol
Good to see so many positive things going on  here...
Thats what im talking about. He learned from the best team in the nfl.
This is exciting. If HBCs figure out a way to pipeline players to the NFL and found a way to play student athletes while they are there then the got something cooking.
All dt security how they get robbed
So why are they just starting out in February? Covid related it does this lower division just play at a different tike of year ?
Lmaooo these announcers are trash
Props to Primetime for giving back ✊🏽
The team Jackson State playing must be a high school Dam
I know ESPN is only there because of Dion. But I love to see this!!! Continuing my HBCU Tour on my motorcycle this summer. Getting Texas, Louisiana,Mississippi, VI and going to finish up Georgia. I can't wait ✊🏿✊🏿✊🏿
Wait I thought shedeur was going to some college in Florida? Did he change his mind.
Were they even playing anyone
Dawg the goat of all goats is really primetime hes dominated all aspects of the game so far defense, offense, special teams and last but not least head coaching a team
"The Sonic Boom of the south" that's what my people down there in Carthage and Ofahoma call them!!!
We can't judge Prime until next year's freshman class graduate from college. He needs a full year to play, recruit, and grow his athletes.  This year should not be taken into consideration.
Deon got em ready to Ball
Loving JSU and new coach
Can anyone on Sanders Staff keep away from SCANDALS? Cant have too much BLING in groups in society s eyes. Im hoping team is indeed blessed for if any sort of cry wolf tantrums or even claims of me 2 influence can be tricky with them folks with the gold digging ways...
primetime must be a good coach and player they smacked em
I thought his son was the QB
Opposing coach showing love and support for what Prime is bringing to HBCU culture immediately after losing 53-0 blowout. 👋👋👋
The title should say Coach Sanders first blow out
Let’s have all black schools but not all white school or all white Mexican schools , weirdos
900
College football? Is this spring ball?
Two words: Edmond Waters?
Jacktown 🤘🏾
Played pickup a couple times with Daylen over the summer—dude can run like the wind
Why wasn’t it televised nationally?
People don't know deon might be changing alot more than just football lives and it will bring more positivity to a area that really needs it
Wait this is a scrimmage?
I’m proud of Deion
This a spring game or sum?
Wanna see them against Alabama, Clemson, Ohio state, LSU. Them kids look hella small compared to the P5 kids LOL
Blow out 😂
Is Deuce one of the commentators?
After they stole his personal property that’s definitely his last job in Jacksonville 💯
I think he might go to a bigger school in a couple years
Word has it, troy suffered a concussion puttin on his sun glasses😒
Can someone please adjust the settings from "Rookie" to "Veteran" level???
Where is shedur
Congrats coach prime
Good W Jackson state
I wanna see there next game, this too easy😖🤔
This is so inspirational man!!!!
football in february?
3:55 Playing man but turns shoulder inside instead of towards the defender like it’s cover....
My daughter went to N.C.C😃
😴😴😴😴😴
Covid must be over with
its cool that deion is coaching the college that walter payton went to
Congrats Coach Sanders aka Coach Prime 👍💪
Hey I think if the NFL don't want to give black coaches a shot, this is what they should do...come to HBCU js.....🤔 Deion bring that swag too....
Can’t wait for Southern University and Jackson state to square off..... SU all day baby
troy aikman and peyton manning would make great coaches
Edward Waters?
Coach Prime let out a real good “WHOOOOOOOO!!!!!” when he got that Gatorade bath!!!!!!
Eventually , coach prime will be a head coach for the NFL
Good first game
What kinda game is this? The season is over
Congrats coach prime wish ur team the best moving forward
Got whooped
Intercepted 🤣🤣🤣 naw it's a catch it's just coming back for holding smh
I thought football season was over
Football season just ended. How are they having their first game?
The aromatic committee emphatically weigh because suit inherently produce for a thirsty starter. upset, resolute crush
Mr primetime
Of course thats prime time
How is there a football game this late in the month🤔?!
Deion Sanders is the only player "Ever" to score a touchdown with the Atlanta Falcons.  get on a helicopter after the falcons game and go play for the  Atlanta Braves and hit a home run In the same day In Atlanta,  Later on that night in his Club 21  Chilling.
He and Moose real for that
HBCUs need to take all of the black players in the country.
Why take life in our own hands when we could let go of everything and trust God? Living for pleasure and gain doesn’t matter since death and time erases all your hard work. It’s all meaningless. Of course, if we don’t believe in God, whether we live an honest life or not would also be meaningless (Be of no consequence). Now if you take into consideration that there’s over 2 billion people on earth making their claims that God is real, would you gamble with your life the same way you would with money? Truly, it’s only when you believe in God, does one’s life become meaningful. Simply because it now means there will be consequences for your actions. As I say this to you now, not to force anything on you, but to encourage you to at least do your own research. Don’t gamble with your life.  - William  John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
Y’all got put Prime in BIG LEAGUES. Have y’all forgotten who he is?!
He got robbed. Not cool
Number 74 left tackle for JSU has to work on his hands and punching ability and overall technique. He got pushed straight back because he stood straight up
Why did they rob his office DURING THE GAME, though..!?
It's football season?
Did the other team even want to play
USMC Roll Tide Coach Sanders and Jackson State I'm a fan
🙌🏾💯🙏🏾✊🏾🏈
Respect jersey
There is definitely an ESPN 30 for 30 in the future for JSU
Let's go Prime... Make all HBCU athletic and academic powerhouses!
Deion the legend at work.
And then got his stuff stolen out of his office.
Salute coach
Dude has all of his stuff stolen from his office during the game. Don’t know to laugh or cry.
theyre still playing football?  I give him 3 years before he takes over  at  FSU!   Go Noles!!!  Sort of looks like high school football.
7:12, that’s some real class by JSU, because homeboy didn’t need that extra shove after a good tackle.
Edward Waters secondary is just insulting. Lord.
BLACKS MEXICANS AND NATIVE AMERICANS AND JAMAICANS WE ARE GOD CHOSEN PEOPLE THE REAL HEBREW ISRAELITES OF THE BIBLE RESEARCH NO PORK NO LOBSTERS CRABS NO CATFISH WOMAN CANT WEAR PANTS
Going to be the Alabama of HBCU
Deion looked mad when they wet him up with that water 🤣
lol majority black school, still got a white kicker somethings never change in american football lmao
Deion is laying a great foundation and teaching them work ethic to go along with their talent.
what type of field are these kids playing on ..... looks like a low end highschool field prime time or not its gonna take a ton to get kids to choose that over a big d1 or even a small d1 school.
More football baby
Troy a G for supporting Deion. Congrats to Jackson State and Deion and his awesome new coaching Staff
Am I missing something? Since when is college football played in February?
Why are they playing in the middle of February? Is this a scrimmage game or have they always done this and i never knew about it?
Great job coaching for arguably the best football player ever!
This is a good look for Jackson State.
Is Jackson D1? I know it's not power 5 I'm guessing it's a small D1 school
Good win.
Ok can somebody please tell me how or why this game is being played? Didn’t college football end like last month?
Good job coach . Winning is contagious
Dion got Robbed during the Game ...
Good win 53-0 I wish all our playing play for a hbc instead of making millions for the so call big schools.That’s the only way change will come and put money and revenue back in our community.
This game looks like the time When Hingle McCringleberry destroyed the Spartans in the Bowl game....good times...
I’d like to see more of 3 to 5 star athletes Go to hbcu’s
alabama will still smash them....
First of many steps to come to segregation in the United States again. That'll definitely appease the far-left and far-right but what about us normal citizens who don't care about the skin tone of the biggest organ of our body which happens to be the epidermal system
Congratulations prime time!!
Now he do that to that team lls
Troy being there is everything!!!!....Class act!!!!
There is college football right now?
Well I mean... it's Edward waters. Believe me, Lincoln the D2 school that Nicholls put 87 on, could take Edward Waters to triple over time🤣 and it's astounding how many people here don't keep up with college football to know that since September most FCS conferences elected to play a shortened spring season.
Dion holding Individual accountability ain't playing excuses . Problem is celebs cant fix problems that begin in the home. No one can but mom and dad.
The backup QB is a better thrower IMO. Has better mechanics. PRIMETIME BABY
Proud of you Deion!!!!!!
I thought football Season was over.. thought it was basketball season?? Anyone want to explain??
Why they playing football in late February?  Sanders got his watch and wallet stolen after the game 😂
They going undefeated calling it
Yo I just saved the comments by commenting (666 comments as typing this)
Troy has always been solid from day one that’s my quarterback
THAT IS A ALL BLACK COLLAGE AND HE GET ALL OF HIS ITEMS STOLEN , COME ON MAN DON'T STEAL FROM ME I AM  BLACK MAN  NOT A TROY. LOL
The cloistered hacksaw noticeably observe because green repressingly treat against a mere dryer. heady, selective offence
Anyone know how much EWC was paid for this?
The other team was trash anyway! Lol
It’s a shame someone stole this man belongings somebody is watching him and needs money bad
I wish him luck but he really didn't have a good team to play. Wait for more games
Not one mask in sight
that’s a NAIA school
Happy for him
This was amazing to see! Deion Sanders could have went anywhere! But he chose to put HBUC in the spot light! Big ups! I will be watching. 💯🙏🏾
Is Deion Sanders no longer doing commentary?
And it's a blowout. Good for him. Now to Subway
This is the way Kap.
Hold up. This was played yesterday???
6:14  That kids reaction was literally on point!
He looked pissed off about that bath. You have to actually do something before you dump Gatorade on coach.
Meanwhile someone is eating at red lobster with his credit card
May as well have played HCC, would've had a more equal opponent!!!
Was this a spring scrimmage game or something. What happened to the field. No logos?
Merely depending on his "Prime" moniker to make him a football god!!!  The disappointment and shame will come later..  But at least, they will have great haircuts!!!
Congratulations good job way to go Prime Time
was that kicker white? so HBCU have white kickers?, nice!
O line needs some technique and some purpose. They have to understand that if you just practice your fundamentals and practice your craft, they're set for the NFL. They gotta hit some zercher squats in the weight room
They played against an NAIA school, they supposed to win
Shout out to Troy Aikman! Actions speak louder than words!
Why is there football on in late February?
Way to go JSU trying to lie and say the items were misplaced.  I'm glad Deion didnt go along with the lie
Prime as head coach at a HBCU is a total game changer. Congrats on your first of many wins.
But why play a NAIA team. Jackson State is D1 FCS school play D1 double A or D2 not no NAIA
Why didn’t his quarterback son play ?
WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN! IN MY RICK FLAIR VOICE THE NEXT DYNASTY PROGRAM IN COLLEGE WATCH N SEE
Stay woke Troy is there for Jerry Jones
this guy is flights work enemy. just screen passes and hb dives
The fact that we even have HBCU's helps keep racism alive. But when you're discriminating the other way no one says anything.
You do realize this is the 2nd time since he moved there that they stole from him. First was they broke in his car. Look at the attention the man is bringing to not just the school but the city. Embarrassing.  You one of the greatest players to play in the NFL coach at your school to do this? Even Troy Aikman came to the game to show support. Way to make HBCUs look bad to the national media
Congratulations Coach Sanders!!
HBCU, all black players. White water girl 🤣🤣🤣🤣dead.
The Last ChanceU might as well and gone ahead and put Jackson State for it's new season.
And his stuff got stolen again, and then it was all found... Something smells fishy
Yeah good game but these hoodlums broke into my office and took my stuff lol. Lucky I had my chains on
If they keep on stealing Deon stuff they're gonna to run him off and this why Jackson is called Jacktown 😂😂💯
Some of the greatest 🏈 players come from small schools...THINK ABOUT IT 💭
Idk if HBCUs are part of the NCAA, but I wish they would create their own collegiate sports organization to rival the NCAA. Have their own tv deals and pay the players. Paid Athletes could attract more 4, 5 star players build these programs and benefit the students and universities. Let the NCAA be a dinosaur and lose talent.
Hold on, college football is still going on??
Troy payed the other team coach to let Deion win (this is a joke)
Shoutout to Troy🙌🏽 Coach Prime is no joke
How are they playing already? If they are there most definitely not playing against top tier talent
It started with “Mississippi Veterans Memorial Church of God and Christ Stadium”....my god it’s a HBCU football brotha... I like Primetime too but relax.
He gone be way bigger than Nick Saban
He puttin us on da map da whole sip🗣
💙
He change the game as an ELITE PRO. And I'm not surprised about any of this.
And his property was stolen while coaching..look it up..
Did shilo play ?
53-0 LOL who were they playing the Washington Generals ?
Lemme guess....”Jackson State wants Bama now?”
I’m confused why’s there college football on right now
Deion said let me go to the school with the least amount of competition I can get 🤣🤣 Edward waters 🤣🤣
Not sure if tha white team sucks or tha red team is really good
HBCU Primes Wallets and stuff stolen.....
Man was Jackson st playing a high school team  Lol
This is like 'Bama playing The Citadel. JSU was playing an NAIA opponent... let's see what happens when they suit up against stiffer competition.
The announcer really fumbled the bag at 5:30
I wonder if he’ll try to straighten up his former player Maurice Washington
How about giving some props to the Jackson State Defense, by showing some of their highlights for putting up a goose egg?! It would interesting if JSU cracked the top 25. Classy move by Troy Aikman.
#8 gotta arm!
Can’t wait to see a whole team of mini Deions shredding it on the field
They look like a highschool out there
EWC IS A HIGHSCHOOL LEVEL COLLEGE IDC IDC CALL ME WHEN HE COACHES AGAINST WEBBER ST OR GRAMBLING STATE
I hope there's a documentary being filmed about this season
Lmao even HBCUs have white kickers
Edward Waters been trash lol
No white players allowed? Imagine all white teams...there would be protests
these announcers bruh 😂😂
5:40 "Intercepted " Man, what are you talking about??!!
Wait ? So HBCU starts in the spring ? Or what’s going on here
Gets robbed still goes out and wins his first game.
this really was amazing for other reasons than football Im proud today of all these men and women behind this team.
College football is happening right now??
History baby
Who else noticed the opposing Assistant Coach hand his phone off and follow primetime around trying to get some talking time at the end 🤣
NFL greats get head coaching jobs at D2 schools, while NFL nobodies get head coaching jobs in the league. WOw.
Nice win, but put a mask on Prime
No defensive highlights????
ESPN y'all trash for the headline y'all have on y'all website. Instead of talking about an HBCU winning y'all make the headline about something negative. This is why we say there is no fairness.
This is his B team playing... These dudes look little
Troy Aikman looked like Jayz in the beginning..  eff round🤔
What year is this from?? Nobody has on a mask!!
They should've taken a knee with 13 sec left. It shows respect and possibly prevents an injury
Aye all love for coach Prime and what he’s doing but imagine how much Clemson would’ve won by lol
Does COVID not exist where they are?
So how long before prime gets the HC job at Florida state?
The righteous sing adventitiously agree because silver daily belong under a grotesque dessert. erect, sore icicle
Just waiting for him to coach the Falcons to the promise land
JS just way too many dawgs!!
The team they playing is trash 😂
1-love to Troy Aikman
Deion Sanders great sneakers 2021
Edwards Waters 😂😂😂😂😂a high school could beat them
Deion Sanders corner back 21
clown
Who keeps on stealing deions stuff
*Go JSU & Coach Prime🥇 !!!!!*
ssippiland🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Imagine being a young kid and the GOAT corner you've always dreamed of being is your coach.
Troy is real Nigaaa ..
I hope those young men know that every player that touched the field made history today
Why are they playing now instead of regular  college season?
Go Deion !!!!give dem boyz motivation
LMAO
Hammer down, no mercy, and good special teams = victories. Rumble, Deion, Rumble.
Edward Waters?? Who daf is dat? Might as well been playing Redman's alma mater Muddy Waters University.
Thought football was over
Does his son start
Congratulations coach.   I wanna see a matchup with florida state football team.  Its show time or go home
Deion playing Franchise mode...
I would like to see Deon have the same success as Nick Seban.
looks like im watching a High School game with a very good camera crew
Good on Deion and JSU.  Glad to see this.  I hope that this is the beginning of good things for HBCU athletics.
Running into each other...your own teammates...horrible win.
They were still throwing the ball up 53-0 with 12 seconds 😂
Prime Time
One guy said it was an interception when it was a td and then the other guy calls first win for coach Bron what is going on
This must be a replay because college football and nfl and high school football is over
Gotta be the first time they've ever been on ESPN
College Football is over
They are gonna have to find new teams to play them yeesh they destroying and they are only gonna get better with recruits flipping to join them holy moly this team is gonna send a good amount of players to the league
Troy out here rocking his outfit on point
Who stole his phone and wallet
Troy a real friend
I remember SYLVETRE MORRIS from this school
They can compete with 75 percent of power 5 teams.
Damm  what his defense  look like
He’s making us even more proud 💪🏾💪🏾
Neon deion makes wanna play college football. I chose semi pro and still play, getting ready for our in league in March. If they don't test me for steroids, then watch out primetime because I might show up
And while he's coaching some weirdos went in his office and stole out his bag
Is this a scrimmage? How are the playing games this early?
Dion sanders team gona win the championship
Georgia going to loose alot of good players, because they r not ready for a black quarterback. That's my opinion 😃
Do these guys make it to the draft ?
Deion is doing it man.
Im happy for Jackson State but they look like half the size of Alabama lol.  Idk where Saban find them hogs
Either Jackson State is that good or Edward Waters College is that bad but either way good to see Coach Sanders get the win.
We will see when they run across the real 🐅.  GRAMBLING STATE UNIVERSITY!!!
I love that kids reaction to that catch 6:14 lmao
Southern Heritage Classic go be so sweet when it cum 2 da city tho JSU go beat TSU silly 🙄
Everybody thinks Jackson St....going to be all that ...but they ain't...they ain't winning no Championships.....
I guess those Subway commercials paid off for him. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
I can smell the turkey legs, nachos and weed through my phone lol
Despite the Fiddy-Burger, no "highlights" from Edward Waters tee-hee-hee?  PrimeTime dun got him some good receivers, y'all see that one-handed Moss-TD grab/holding  call from No.6 (6:01)?
No masks
Great WIN Coach Prime!
"Wins first game" is an understatement! That was brutal
Having the football season in Spring is great for Deion. No FBS games to take away media coverage and the fact that Jackson State is the only FCS team a lot of people know is gonna lead to more publicity which will lead to better recruits.
I know it wouldn't count but would love to see JSU go up against Ohio State in a Exhibition game.
Bro what I didn’t even know he was a head coach
Am I trippin or are those hashes hella far out?
WORDDDD 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 , I'M SO HAPPY FOR COACH PRIME lol!!! HE'S ABOUT 2 CHANGE THA WHOLE HBCU LANDSCAPE , WATCH!!!
What is this? Preseason? Spring game? Post season?
Those red uniforms are fire but the amount of technique and knowledge these players are getting is crazy
Gosh they look so small tell me if im mistaken
i’m glad for deion but they played a NAIA school 😂 cmon na a D1 school vs the lowest level of football next to juco isnt comp .. impressed but not impressed
Segregation of football is trending.
You always here somebody momma in the highlights😂
Great win I guess? Ugh isn’t edward waters a  NAIA school? So essentially they beat a team that’s worse than a JUCO.
Those big schools gonna offer Prime big money so the HBCUs don’t gain no traction.
JSU has a killer marching band. Now primetime is the head coach of the football team?? Oh boy, exciting times in Mississippi!
Never, ever, ever, ever, heard of Edward Waters.
You always hear one Hood chick yelling in the background
Fails to mention how he got robbed last month there. But hey, he wanted a HBCU.
Nice Troy paid in some love on game day.
Deion Running the Scoreboard. 53-0 blowout and they still throwing with 10secs left in the game smh.....
Deion is gonna elevate that program.
HBCU's are on the way. Prime deserves claps all around if he could steer some of the talent to his school and others that would be a win. If you're a kid that's a blue chipper who are you most impressed by Prime or just another coach. Humm
ok
Ok coach sanders love the transition always liked your style
Imagine how the facilities are going to transform over the next 10 years.
Thx you troy
Got them boys looking like an NFL team firing on all cylinders was a wonderful treat to watch thanks Coach and Can’t forget to mention Jackson State for an excellent showing.
Where is troys mask?
3:30 LOOK AT THAT EFFORT BY 76!!!
HBCU is on the way to the top!!! Let's GO!!!
People really dont care to wear a mask. Wow
No one cares about hbcu schools, they never be able to compete with bigger schools
Looks alot like highschool football
Didn't college football just end
🔥🔥
Who are they playing???? Nobodies!!! Duuuu, of course they won against no nobodies.
I wish there was a lcu style show about them
i thought ewc was a naia/d3  school
Prime U.!!!!
Bro my high school team we would beat these cats they playing
Sad Prime got some stuff stole from him AGAIN!!! First the stuff from his truck now his wallet watches etc...I hope he doesnt lose faith in the program. He's going to make history at JSU watch.
It’s not even fb season tf
YOUNG BLACK MEN PLEASE HELP TO REBUILD OUR HBCU'S!!!
All the former cowboys coming Dc4l
Deion Sanders great job proud of you
somebody robbed Deion during the game smh...
Look at aikman showing that ignorance. Going to spread corona to ppl
maybe one day my hbcu can be out there like that
One of these commentators is really bad at his job
I'm confused why they are playing right now? I like professional football but hate college because of the NCAA and their rules.
I'm happy to see prime coaching i wish Jackson state and all the coaching staff success.
They have a mutiny going on in mai de the program. Did they steal or misplace his things?
I remember somebody saying access is power. Mr Sanders and his team of coaches and Consultants have access to all the power Brokers in the NFL. George Bush jr. Said that when his father was president he followed it up with I can get my father on the phone anytime I want access is power Mr Sanders is redistributing access to the power power to the people
Nothing to get excited about, it's  Edward  Waters. I like how all  the JSU fans expect teams to lay down. Southern, Grambling, the rest of the Swac don't care about Deion being on the sidelines. PSA he's not playing anymore. His son Shilo isn't that good, he should have been  at an HBCU to begin with.
why is football being played this time of year????? anyone know?
HBCU schools are awesome, I would love to see them grow!!
3:36 doggone 🤦🏾‍♂️
I should hope they can beat the blind sisters of the poor
Where is shedur?
I hope the whole next 10 seasons go that way. Feel a little sorry for the opposing team though.😎😎😎
Rooting for Mr. Sanders' success.... Just Win ... AND, keep winning
luv it. gives more of our young men a shot at the big league.
The kids won
He faced no competition. Let's see what happens in conference.
Where are the defense highlights? Other team got 0, show us why
They ligit
This doesn't surprise me at all. We're just as capable and talented as every other race of people.
HBCUs will eventually be where the best football is played. It’s trending upward. Selling out to the major schools is the néw blasphemy.
Wow glad I didn't pay to watch that gm.
Are they playing a high school team?
I'm concerned because Shedeur can't play until the Fall. This was pretty much a scrimmage game for us. We can't make mistakes against Southern or Grambling.
Masks anyone??
How long do you think he stay there before a  bigger schools plucks him away?
That field looked too wide
My HS football team could dominate Edward Waters too!!!
great W.  Coach prime def makes me want to play for a HBCU. Sheduer def gonna be a problem next szn
Hopefully Deion gets all his stuff back...so grimey someone stole his stuff during the game
This is awesome to see 👌 Super excited to see what Coach Prime and Jackson ST do throughout.
I don't think people realize how huge it was for Aikman to be there.
So why are they even playing in February  ?
Wow they basically played a high school team
Deion Sanders has a far reach nationally. I will fly my Jackson State flag tomorrow in Bushland Texas (near Amarillo) FSU grad and now Jackson State fan here..
Congrats to Deion.
Troy Aikman came out and support
I bet that their former Cowboys coach will be proud of these two supporting each other.
Troy a real one for showing support & encouragement to Deion & an HBCU in Jackson St.
I have been on the JSU bandwagon every since the school hired Prime Time as their HC. But I live in Jacksonville Fl and EWC is not a premier football program. I am going to hold judgement until I see how JSU does against some of the better HBUC Teams such as Grambling, Southern, Alabama State, Florida A&M etc. I am a diehard Alabama fan but I love watching HBCU football. I am hoping to eventually see a HBCU team make it to the NCAA playoffs once the number of teams are increased. The million dollar question is will it be JSU?
Eric Beinemy should coach a hbcu👍! I hope this starts trending. Hbcu should have the best players and coaches!
Ok Dion .. Keep it going. Continue to grow nothing but greatness. Solid✊
THE DIDN'T PLAY ANYBODY EDWARD WATERS 😹😹😹😹😹
5:21 hit that arm with the ball.
It’s February I’m so confused
3:01 he has to clean that up stop focusing on running mobility. Be more pocket then on your wanna be rg3 focus an protect yourself.
They looked good, but that o-line needs work. Especially, if they ever get on the field w/ NCAT.  It is early and they showed very well.  Congrats JSU and Coach prime.
"Deion Sanders wins first game as Jackson State head coach" ...against an NAIA school.  Nice try, ESPN. Try again when Prime actually plays somebody.
Where is his son
Dope to  see Troy show love
Edwards water need to go ahead and give me a offer they dbs suck
So shilo an shaduer an starting
Good win, but they got a lot to work on
All these Brothers waiting for the white men to give them jobs !!! Go coach an HBCU, recruit top talent, pass the knowledge down build your legacy ... Pride >>> money, especially when you have already  made your $$$. Marshall Faulk, Tomlison, ...etc.
I didn’t see one defensive snap 😂
Deion Sanders >>> Nick Saban already.
What division is this!??
I thought college was done?
Hey guys are they starting their season just now? Hmm I wasn't aware when HBCU's start their seasons 🤔
#4 kinda look like Watson with the red uniforms lmao
Congratulations Coach Sanders. Great that Troy Aikman came to see you. ( nice embrace between 2 Cowboys Legends ) - Too bad some "Coward" had to Rob-You, and take-away from your special moment. I hope they catch the guy. Rooting for your Success brother. oNe LovE from NYC
Things are about to change in the HBCU schools.... It's prime time baby.
What people have to remember is Deion’s staff is just getting there. They haven’t had a full off season to install their whole system, they haven’t gotten all the recruits and transfers in as well. This will be a totally different team come the fall season. I watched the whole game. You could see the difference in how they are playing especially defensively. It’s gonna take time. They are gonna lose at the most 2 games, not because they weren’t better, but because of continuity. They will be going against teams that have players that’s have been in the system for 2-3 years. It makes a difference. But they will be a problem sooner than later
Love it!
You can see and feel the inspiration and excitement he has infused into these young men!
Why is this my first time hearing of Edward Waters
Jackson State 15-0
Glad to see it. Love me some prime time.
Was that deuce McAlester doing the color?
I got to make that road trip down to Jackson, but I'm going to wait until they're not playing the JV team from the local high school .....lol Glad to see them out there though. Good job Tigers
Congrats to the players and coaches way to go coach prime!!! The players knew their assignments not a lot of bad mistakes. Jackson State's players and coaches will only gonna get better!!!!
I am a fan of HBCU. Please wear your masks.
Up 45-0 in 4th Qt STILL throwing the ball ain't cool. At all.
Glad to see him having success. I’ve got a few neon deon signs from when he played with the braves
Wow that looked like amateur hour...really thought JState was a larger program than this
13:43 I love that. Do you love me? 😍💋 💝💖❤️
Look how organized those boys are, pay attention southern!
WHO WAS THE OPPONENT?  PLAY SOMEBODY SANDERS
Congrats 2 prime...but this shyt dont count...that team is srry..high level high school teams could beat Edward waters
Ive seen 2 plays when Jackson State took off before the snap and no call. Not hating but refs gotta be better.
Can you say NFL prospects for draft & championships in the school future
I don't expect them to do great in the Spring. BUT, that JSU team in the fall 🔥🔥🔥 scary!!!!   I can see Prime winning a few Black College Natties.
Everything out of deions office got stolen WHILE he was coaching the game smh
I heard after the game they were chanting we want Bama 😂
🔥🔥🔥🔥
So no one is wearing the masks, wow 😳.... guess football is more important than health
and all his stuff got stolen
I hope this sparks more recruits coming back to HBCUs and more First round draft picks for the NFL
Grambling is better.
I was at the game!!!!!
Why didn't they kneel at the end of the game?
Thought this was HS football 😆😆
Once he gets his players in there, it’s gone be a problem. He might attract some five stars to the program.
It's all good EWC. Yall fought hard,  NAIA vs D1... congrats on the first Dub coach Prime
They still got football going on?
Jackson state qb is kind of nice.
Awesomeness.. Can't wait until they play SWAC conference schools. That will be the litmus test. It really starts with Grambling!!
Prime got an HBCU on ESPN b4 Spring ball even starts!! Let that sink in!
Yessir Primetime
Good win
Congrats
Prime time!!!!
he going to attract a lot of good players, and a lot of money to that school
