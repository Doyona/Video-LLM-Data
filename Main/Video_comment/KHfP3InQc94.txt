Zastanawiam się, czy siedzenie z laptopem na wyspie kuchennej jest wygodnie?
I dont really like this house except for the bedroom and closets but I do like his cars lol
i judged you travis, mostly cause of the tats. you seem like a beyond nice guy
❤
I dunno...for some reason I find this guy totally off-putting and insufferable.  The only upside here is that Kourtney deserves nothing better, she's such an ungrateful B.
If he likes it, that's great. I find it all a little...underwhelming.  Like those are rooms I literally could have in my house.  There's nothing special about any of it.  Kourtney keeps his Christmas gifts in bags in her closet?  lol
The most dull basic unmemorable hotel house ever. Kortney propping herself in full makeup & hair preplanned to look unstaged & casual in just a pajama top lol I can't.
Very , very nice !
It's very understated compared to korts house or any of the kardashians houses. I love how he thinks it's minimalist, he needs to check out Wayne's version of minimalist.
Is there such a thing as delicious vegan food?
Bland
Also did kourtney sell her house to move into his?
He looks like Adam maroon five
Justin Bieber?
Two people who are happy!
Is a boring, normal house. What is the big deal people are suckers.
Scorpios always bring the vibes
Very nice except for black counter tops
He seems so sweet
You not allow to sit on the bench...it is for the FOOD 'PRE.... TELL HER TO SIT ON THE CHAIRS😮.
I love that there are comfortable  chairs.
👏🏼
He’s such a Pisces 🥰
Why people need so many t shirts?
Very European decor
Skinny 😂 why?
He is vegan but it looks like he is wearing leather?
Alqeda
know a hysterical pregnancy is do ya?????
kootan hooss....big talent in bed!
Matcha and tea leaves are afraid of light and should not be stored in transparent jars, as they will spoil quickly.
Looks like you'll be spending this house by yourself.Because you can't keep a partner.
has to be awful watching you build this incredible house to have your daugther fill it with a different rapper every month lol
Who's Travis Barker?
They make a great couple❤
That’s he’s house or Kourtney house?
He's always been very handsome to me. He has a bad boy look, but he seems so nice, very articulate, humble and calm.❤
Il est  trop  moche  je sais pas  se lui trouves  courth il es bcp  plus  beaux  scott
He went on tour while the designer handled everything — which is exactly why I have zero respect for celebrity homes. On the other hand, I have endless respect for people living in tiny rentals with tight budgets who still manage to create magic in their spaces.
I don't understand why a person look like this. Scary. 😅
Nice but I don’t want to see the cars. This is about architecture not cribs
❤
I'm very happy for his beautiful family ❤❤❤❤
It's very beautiful ❤️
Strange they didn't show the bathroom.
No one cares
not a single thing in this house about blink 182? am i crazy?
I love his house
Es irónico pensar que Travis tenga una casa tan ordenada siendo una súper estrella del punk rock, mientras que sus fans deben tener una casa normal y súper desordenada. Realmente es irónico! 😅😅😅
Love the outdoor space and him being polite to AD in the end unlike some other videos, I have watched.
L'impression la maison d'un sorcier et l'atmosphère des ténèbres 😈😈😈😈😈😈
I like the living room, the kitchen and the fireplace. Big doors and nice atmosfere.
I like Travis alot, but boy did he mess up with Alabama Barker 😅
He is so humble
Looks pretty plain Jane to me. Nothing special
He seems romantic and very cool. He's so chill.. He is a drummer in fact
Dont brag. Save your marriage
Black bin bag is back in fashion
Why does Travis Barker's voice give me singer vibes? Despite being a drummer. I bet hes a great singer.
My house
Great house!
🧦
Que cuadros mas feos que tienes 😖😖
His energy is calm and attractive
The counter we play on
You shouldnt show off your wealth!
Effing w****
You probably sold them to Diddy
Hey can I put my thingy and Courtney's mouth
I luv your obsession for your wife!❤
Could Kourtney not bother to get dressed for this?  It seems...tacky.
Travis barker still creepy
Travis barker.  Him the only controlling.Relationship.
Yawn. Found that so slow and boring
Love it🎉
I am not giving any item 's you have there.  Just in case.
Impressed
Very chill dude.
I DREAMT ABOUT JASMINE, AND SHE WAS CALLING ME DADDY
İkinizde çok iğrençsiniz
macha macha macha 1
Love his 3rd Eye Blind jumpsuit
SATAN👎👎👎😨😨😨🥶🥶🥶
👎👎👎👎👎
Beautiful house and perfect family
Beautiful house and perfect family
Can he get any cooler... I don't think so. I want that lamp. LOL put that outdoor fireplace on
2:40 Now, a bunch of different guys come and go through his house because of Alabama. 🤔
Pee Wee Herman in leather. Dude is a creep. Was stalking the kardasions for a long time. He coudnt get KIm so he settled for Kourtney.
I suddenly like this guy now. You go travis baker! You’ve got impeccable taste and great calm vibes bro
Con el intro ya vi todo, gracias y bye xD
Is this the new mtv cribs lol
This is the most boring house I’ve ever seen
Travis Braker que casa más sosa
Most annoying couple of all time
i love Travis   such a beautiful soul love Kourtney as well
He is a proper family guy. I love how minimalistic his house his, there is nothing particularly extravagant in the house and that's what makes it special and the fact that he remembered everyone's names is just beautiful. I love this for him and Kourtney.
just so happy Kourtney found a great guy esp. knowing what she went thru
I see Kourtney and Travis lasting. Strong values ❤
House is meticulous and beautiful. Just he talks like Kadarshians.  Gone are the days, American men spoke like men. Women though, most of them are went ten step ahead of Kadarshians.  And Kourt, even here, pulling her shirt up to show the thighs.  Seems like she is happy now, and enjoying a better life.
First of all, I absolutely LOVE the painting Kourtney got for Travis, that is too cool!..but how come there's no other paintings up? It's so bare! They don't even have photos up of the family either, I see that a lot in celebrities homes, it makes it so unhomey!
That’s cool, but wtf is matcha?
There house is plain and kinda creepy
What a beautiful soul. I enjoy him very much. I'm sure he'd be a great person to chat with.
THE. BEDSIDE. CANDLE.
Obviously she's not attracted to him for his appearance. He's got money, fame, musical skills and he's probably a likable guy.
What is that outfit 🧐
Looks sterile and unlived in.
FREAK!!!!! UGH!!!
He is so weird.
❤️👍🏻❤️
I’d drink his 🍵 😂
Fake .... Anyone who watched mtv cribs back in the day knows this isnt authentic. He's kardashified. It's pathetic
Wow my tv is bigger, i feel great lol. Crazy its only one floor.
Perfect never judge a book by  their cover
My brother had a Buick Gran National, black out package. Brand new in 1987. Hit the gas and head hit bsck of the seat! Awesome car!
He is the epitome of therapy lol
Everyone style is different I don't see anything in his that I like
money make them clowns
thank you traivis barker!  blink 182 fans 💌 and its nice to see this video as a form of success in your life.   thanks for your examples🎶
Kendrick Lamar approves that GNX
Apparently you don’t need a bank acct to pull out money would love to know those
I have move out codes
Wow so punk... ha
This has to be one of the more livable celebrity homes featured on AD.
What a boring house.
Proof money gets you laid
Who is this baby boy junky with tats all over him? Strange world.
I get why Courtney and Travis qrk he is so humble ❤
And like wooo
This is a wonderful couple. I pray nothing comes between them🙏🏾
He looks like a skeleton
Cracked me up when he said he doesn't like when people put a bunch of things everywhere, while he has a bunch of Tattoos everywhere. Loves minimal and his skin isn't 😝
They have more chairs than the average person in that house yet there’s Kourtney sitting in the counter 😂
Waldo knocked down the wall to make windows. Call him Walno 😂
Travis barker
Where all the dudes Bama has in her room all the time lol
Hes accepting,warm and reserved , he'll take care of her and respect her very well
can Landon make more songs?
His voice is really calming lol
It"'s unnecessary excess. Ridiculous. Doe's he even really own those cars as they don't look like they've ever been driven. The tyres look spanking brand new. A lot of these celebrities don't even own their homes if you really take a deep dive into their lives. They are owned and controlled, that's part of the deal for fame. You don't need to have talent, they have ways of buffing them up
At 10:56 the back pillow moves up! 👻
8:53 i wonder if bama recorded the diss here😭
as a blink 182 person, i did not expect travis to sound like this speaking
"how you rich and still acting rachet"
Bet it’s not tranquil now lmfao
His closet is my dream closet All those Tshirts!! A dream come true
now Divorce 🤣😁
Nothing more tranquil than a leather jumpsuit
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 I literally said, EW, WHO'S THE GRANDPA WITH KOURT!?!? lmfao ooooops  that's Travis lmao. GET SOME COLOR BRUH!
Just a place to rest my head😅
im sorry but this so bad
Awe I’m happy for both of them and he is so genuine I’m shocked as well
It’s satisfying listening to him like a brain massage
who should I talk to to get a red tattoo
Due persone tossiche ma curatevi
They are discusting!
Leather coveralls are bold choice.
Hahaha watta stupid outfit
Whist all this they still broke up
Silence of the Lambs answers the door lol..Great video.
U ruined ur kid tho so???
So happy for Kourtney
Another person the kardashians have ruined…”I want it minimal and humble…” then shows off his 10,000 sq ft house
هو انت لابس كيس جثث
beautiful house. I hope not burned down with wildfire
He is so flippin weird! She definitely downgraded lol
Holy 💩 that Grand National 🤯
Wonder if it's still there due to la fires
Love the fact that he has these framed photos of his family everywhere I haven’t seen this in other house tours
That’s a lot like our movie theater room
He looks like a serial killer
He needs some sun
She's not pretty like Kim
Listen close at 2 min and 15 seconds into this video and tell me what you hear?
not an AD house for sure, zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
That house is cold and soulless.
I'm very impressed. great story telling of the house tour :)
Not Kourtney being sleezy on a counter being an absent mom....
she looks JUST like Miss Kris Jenner in this!
I've never listened to Travis Barker before. . . But he seems nice.
Wait.. y'all eat ACTUAL vegan food or?
travis is soo cool and humble..i love it
What is he wearing😮 plus are all his cars vegan and organic ...oh these rich hypocrites vex me
Love this one!!
“If he wants to entertain in his bedroom”? 🤨
Wooooo manifesting this ✌️
I love how he is all about family 😊
These rich weirdos are so unrelateable
My dream car, Buick Grand National
SERIAL KILLER VIBES
I love Kourtney 😊
Kourtney wouldn’t have that 😅
Looks way better than when Shanna lived there
He has such a calming voice it was actually really relaxing to watch this
Ive been a fan of him my whole life. That woman is going to destroy him. Hes such a dainty soft soul. She’s going to rip that family to pieces. Watch…
Is this the house that burned down
How do they keep bugs out of the house
Are they still together?

His interior designer needs to be fired!! Why are so many books out on display?! Are you having a book club?
this is exactly the saying says never judge a book by its cover
Beautiful and well decorated
It's amazing what money can do 😁 when a person don't let it all get to their head 🗣️
James De Wolf PingPong table. 20k
why banksy is blured
he seems like a calm cool guy. I suspect his early life was difficult.
TRAVIS: "ALL I EVER WANTED WAS A BLACK GRAND NATIONAL" (Kendrick voice) KOURTNEY: SURPRISE, FACTORY STICKERED.
That car that Kourtney gave him for his bday is so fire
That’s a very nice house 🎉
Not mob out 💀
I like the fun things in here
His closets are clothing stores 😂
an annex kardashian  now I recognize him
selling your soul just seems empty.. you can have all this but it just feels empty, everything but nothing inside
Kourtney is so cornball with just a shirt on drinking whole sitting on the counter
Creep
this guy is very weird
I'm going out.
Made me feel like we were back on MTV cribs 🌹👅
He looks totally unattractive with that outfit on
THAT BUICK GRAND NATIONAL!!!! 💪🏽💪🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
You could take a 1000 years to explain to me how he and Kourtney got together got together and I still probably wouldn’t understand. He so calm and chill and kind, and her and her entire family and situation… is not. Lol
11:28 "A little bit of shoes" *more stock than my local skateshop.
He is such a cool guy !!! Very welcoming and kind ❤
Lil baby and Travis Barkers are my favorite houses.
They're both creeps
Very cool video but what's up with that outfit.
I wonder if the seats in that Rolls Royce are vegan.
What a scumbag. I wouldn't let this guy watch my dog. He looks like a scrote bag in that outfit.
“is trav still looking for the gold dior bike? lebron never came and picked it up” LMAOOOOO this had me cryinggg
May the light of the Lord shine in their lives and may they receive Him
Your so sweet Travis. I hear your a great dad.please never change. Don't let them change you 😢.stay private
I love his voice so calm
Dudes a tool what’s he wearing 💀💀😭😭🤣🤣🤣
We just sit here and eat delicious vegan food🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ Mega weirdo
He looks like a skidrow dad
Terrible design. Sorry. It just is.  Fire that designer. It looks like somebody just moved in and barely has anything.
Isn't he I just watched him with fans he backs security away he's absolutely so normal x
Duivel
❤😂😂❤, Скарфейс был... Тревис я NFS играл... Смерть героя 1 мировую войну... Слушал Барабанил... Блинков почмотрел мы голые бегали
What a cool guy!👍 And a perfect house.👍
People on about his voice lol
Travis seems like a sweet guy, the house is relaxing.
And now they are divorced!!!  Joke 😂😂
This is the adult version of MTV Cribs.  LOVE IT!  Travis is very calming, he should narrate books.
pura kaka
So minimalist so classy 😍
She couldn’t get dressed and sit in a chair ….ruined the whole thing for me
Love the house
The front of the gate I saw mgk performing bloody valentine
He cheated on her the day before her wedding with 21 women on a stage in Vegas and recorded. Humble where ? She has another Scott but worst
Nice house 🏡 can I crash on couch for a few days ?
He’s the pure definition of “never judge a book by its cover “. 3 Cs- Calm, Cool and Collected. Kourtney you are so lucky
Smith Susan Thomas Charles Brown Scott
so many many sofas and chairs and seatings just to sit on the kitchen countertop
Looks like a SSMan
Bmx 🚲🌟🎸
He is so gross
Never judge a book...
3:55 mocha pronounced like that is so annoying and American. Pretty sure its MOKKA
lets do it
This video just called me poor
What is he wearing? 🤣 nice house
He seems like a wonderful person! Beautiful House.
the fireplace in the bedroom is such a wise choice. I had never seeen that before
I'm also a big lover of macchya^^
Nazicore.
He does not look like a normal person to me
That was nice. He makes me want to go chill. He's very soft spoken. KK hit the lottery with him. No wonder his ex is so jealous. And the house is beautiful.
I wanna be rich so bad
Hint he said his house, she is no longer happy as when they met
Love when he said :" this is where we eat vegan food". Awesome house Travis.
So happy for them both lovely couple ❤
'Mokka'
Any idea what all 5 albums are in the picture. Can't make them all out.
Soooooo basic !!!
He cheated death and is a great drummer. So live your life.
wow not what I expected. Seems like a calm kind homey kind of guy.
It's decorated, almost in the same color scheme as Kim Kardashians
Demonic people they
He talks a lot about Kourtney, it shows how much he loves her! It’s inspiring
Could anybody come to eat with Travis and his family?
He talks like an 8th grader 😂
The way he says her name. He loves her and she loves him.🙂🤬
S
dude has an organic mattress
🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Perfect Match, true soul mates 🥰 so glad they found one another 😘 ❤️‍🔥💕💖💝💘❣️💗💓💞
Nothing says punk like marrying a kardashian lizard and living in a villa
The style is amazing❤
There is absolutely nothing punk rock about this dude….. jewels clipped a long time ago. He claims punk but that community disowned him long ago…. Don’t know who this weirdo is
he is so peaceful <3
So beautiful this is a masterpiece ❤
I love Travis
STOPPP IT!!! That Grand National is Mint!!! Absolute Awesome car! I owned an 86 Monte Carlo as my first car in 1997 , which has a similar body style. There was a kid in town that had a grand National and I was so jealous of him because GN’s were so hard to find. Everyone in my town in Boston had hot rods back in the 90s. THOSE are the car you want to have! Not the plug-in Tesla! Gimme a break! Chevelle, grand national , Malibu ,,,, cars they you never see anymore
The couches in the movie theater bother me. How can you watch a movie comfortably when you have no back on the couch. Pillows don’t give support. Homie needs some nice comfortable recliners
u. G. L. Y
Acres of blandness for a couple of vapid morons. But I’m sure they’re extremely happy in their giant boring house.
He is hot.
He is so sweet
Is it just me or are his eyes pinned tf out lmao hes hi asf on something 😂
But his choice in women🥴…👎🏼
i love how much of an intellect he is
Casal lindo demais ❤❤❤❤❤❤
You can just tell his publicist is the one responsible for this whack episode
This girl outta All the karda-crew is the thirstiest. Just pathetic the way she is just pathetic
🤔 Sort of confused by the title,  doesn't his wife live there too? 😂 Is that not also her house?
You can tell they're doing it. lol. Such chemistry. "this is a small house that's under 10.000 sq/ft" lol I love it. This house is not AD worthy but they are in love so it was okay, lol
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ADAM LEVINE FOR A SECOND
Always liked this guy , his music and his taste in decor!
Looks like a fruitcake … sounds like a fruitcake…. Must be a fruitcake
Glad you are happy 🤷🏽‍♀️
You wanted Kim but accepted Kourtney instead 🥸🤷🏽‍♀️
Poor people find it hard to have clear space...or any space lol
I think this is the first time I heard Travis speak…so soothing & lovely, I wasn’t expecting that!
this is the best one in the whole channel
He seems like a genuine kind person 😊
Wab😅😅😅
His personality is so attractive 🤍
Fame in the USA some how eventually turns people gayer and gayer
RIP
That jumpsuit is 🔥
His whole style has taken a massive dive. Used to be edgy and cool now he just looks like a spaceman.
Of course Kardashian had to be on camera…. She can’t resist because she’s a narcissistic talentless hoe
Wow, what happend to this guy? Absolutely no character. Makes sense he is with a Kardashian now.
Kourtney bugs...so staged
His wife is a real DOG, look at who she really is before all that plastic surgery.
He looks like a meth head, who is he?
All your body is covered by tattoos and you’re afraid of tarántulas🫢😂😂😂😂are you fking serious 😂😂😂
When he said he has an organic mattress 😂 that was so Kourtney lol
❤❤❤
Vegan giner 😂🤣
Cool guy!
Every time I see Travis he strikes me as such a lovely guy. Kourt is a lucky lady!
Meu Deus ele fala!!!!
I'm happy that they are both happy.
why is he dressed like a binman. ?
Barker! I got him confused with Travis Scott 😂..so happy Kourtney found her piece 💍 lord knows she went through it with Scott. YASSSS!
JUST 10,000 square feet-yep, minimalist 😂😂😂 it is beautiful though. Looks super chill
He did this with his last family. I can't wait to see what he does with his next family.
What is the name of this organic mattress that can vibrate? 11:00
4:15
travis is so dope
Punk is indeed dead.
all those tats did not say ur a minimalist guy. sheesh huge surprise great house btw
dream life
If yall love him now go back and watch the show he had with his ex wife. She wasn’t so great but I now LOVE him because of that show.
Love his vibe...he's always had a sweet and genuine vibe! And that grand national wow!!!!!! Lucky lucky dude!
Amp
So punk!!!!
Travis has always been a legend and a calm force of nature. Smart and talented really centered and family oriented. People are surprised to see how he is because they judge his exterior. Him and Kourtney match because they have similar values.
the esence of a true punk rocker...sell out
Watching this literally broke , but one day I will achieve something like this 🪐
Didn’t like it. Just not my style. I like very cozy, warm houses.
he has nice taste. minimilist and doesnt hold onto junk
LOVE hearing him talk. He has a beautiful voice tone ❤️❤️
His a beautiful soul..as a person❤❤
I love one story houses.
what’s he’s jumpsuit brand ? just insane !
Yes it’s a beautiful large house but he does it for his family. Truly inspiring
CLASSLESS
The natural light is stunning. Nice design.
quavo 1hour new 💸🛍✉📬🎁
Oh, I like the long cabinet handles on these tall cabinets. I like the wooden square legs of this ping pong table. It hardly looks stable if someone touches this table but I like this idea. Convert this room into a studio and I’m for it. Oh ok a short headboard is something I like. This outdoor dinning room is in how it’s fully covered by the house and by the pool. I like how this garage has room for 4 cars and it’s clean.
I had no idea who this guy was. Had to Google him. The comments are correct...his house doesn't match his appearance. He seems like a very calm and centered person...but his appearance comes across as wild and crazy. Seems like a nice guy. Marrying into the Kardashians though? Although he is with the somewhat normal one of the bunch. 😁🤣
Hahaha
I just realized… I need a matcha station!
Ah!  Anche ai punk piace il lusso quando fanno i soldoni 😂
Nice guy...calm n simple....
dudes turnd into a modern day tiktok kid. what a shame considering who he is and his background.
it's obvious that you're so fake, and you're always playing a role.
I feel more relaxed just listening to him…
Where can I get that candle? @ 10:35
hay 80 sillas y ella pone el 🍑enla mesada
If having a house like this means I have to dress like a jackass I’ll pass
I can’t describe how much I hate them two
He seems like a really cool person. I've always been a fan of his but this video gives me a new appreciation for him.
I personally don't care for minimalism but this is a nice design I will admit. It would be nicer with more wall art, or at least any color other than white for the walls.
What’s sad is that house is probably $20 million.. move it to Texas and it’s maybe $4 million ☠️
and tomorrow he is having tea with king charles  like a boss rockstar boss
why does all his sentences end with a question mark? 😂🤣
Does anyone know the name of the plant on the kitchen counter?
So fake
Cool video Mr Barker
Great vibe! <3
Of course she's gotta be sitting up in the kitchen in her drawers
That’s normal for her to sit on the counter like that while recording typical kardashian
I dont know what it is but this just seems weird
Beautiful house Travis and thanks to Architectural Digest for the video❤
The irony of someone covered in ink saying they got an organic bed...
Vegan 🤢
Travis might be a rock star but hes so chill and laid back i feel like he could be an awesome person without the money. He has great taste and money didnt ruin him.
I love how softly spoken, kind and down to earth he is, I can clearly see how him and Kourtney fell in love and joined families  Stunning house!
красавчик
Meh
His dress style seem to be the exact opposite of house decoration.
Why does kourt like men with recovered addicts or addicts?? Lol hey I'm the same
You pumping Kendal too yeah
*Travis Kardashian is a vegan.*
"Omg my last house was too big this one, just under 10,000 Sq ft, is perfect" okay.....
Note to self: Never hire Waldo
He always looks like he's on death's door
Kourt: who chooses the color black as an option for couches.  But her whole life now depends on the color 😂
Der Typ ist so ein Opfer…
Dude looks like someone sucked his soul.
bigger tv mate :)
Not too many people or families eat at a table like that anymore. Or at least not on my side of the world. So it's nice to see that he's into that.
Sorry Travis but your attire makes you look like an  S/M janitor
Is voice is very calming and the opposite of what you think a rocker would be. As he talked I felt the zen.
POSER
Omg why did you marry her she’s so Fing Annoying! That whiny voice!😩🙄
I love the look of the matcha station, I’m Trying to replicate it.. does anyone know where I can find the same board and little jars with the spoons ??
What a junkie.. methhead. Looks like walking dead.
My cousin was his neighbor. She said he was really nice & humble AF! 🤎🪶
Kravis forever
multiple layers of fake🤣🤣
Absolutely stunning sheek and tranquil if only I was a millionaire 🤔 beautiful vibes Travis and Kourtney ❤️ Eat delicious vegan food.....
That Sid Vicious painting very large 😁
Open door isn’t the same once you find out everything is staged and start to notice all the profit placement. Funny how the house was put up for rent after this aired.
It's a great house. Hopefully,  he'll get to keep it in the divorce.
Why do Kardashian women have such a penchant for tacky and unattractive men? I guess bc they're tacky. Can't buy class.
Be my car guy...be the guy that gifts a regular car w lifetime insurance & registration. Be that awesome person for me. No, seriously.
It's the "how much Kourtney works" for me
THERE SO FAKE
HE  PROPOSE TO KOURTNEY  BECAUSE  HE KNEW SHE WAS THE ONE AND HE WASN'T GOING TO LET HER GO  I HOPE HE MAKES HER HAPPY 😁❤
wait, what? You have Lebron's huffy?
he who shall not be named
wow, i literally couldn't despise anyone more than this dude
I never realized how soft spoken, and gentle his vibe is. Perfect proof you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover.
Wow😮😊..October 17th..My birthday❤❤❤
cha!nsaw
🥱
Scott visits to have some matcha
As a diehard Blink fan, sometimes you might forget how people on the outside might perceive him based on how he looks. For those of us that basically grew up with him, it’s just seems obvious that he’s a soft spoken and mild mannered guy but I guess for those that weren’t really into the band or got to know him because of his wife it can be a bit surprising. The comments caught me off guard with how many people were surprised at how family oriented and genuine of a guy he is .
I think this is a fake relationship publicity stunt they don't see like a real couple.
hes so soft spoken its amazing haha
Kourtney I see it girl. Also his house is perfectly minimalist it still has character and has significant objects while still maintaining such a clean and fresh feeling.
Don't judge a book by it's cover. Guy seems super chill.
i wish i had the time for a "zen" life too
Crazy, never realized how soft spoken and feminine this dude is.
AD is not what is used to be
soul sold
Привет из России!!!❤
Крутой чел🎉🎉🎉🎉
That kitchen is gorgeous.
Dior BMX bike
There is NO WAY the outdoor grill doesn’t hit the wall when opened.
Wasn’t the Cadillac shauna bought you the best present ever ??
Wait, who is this guy and why does he live like that?
I absolutely love that he's had the same house for so long
Materialistic
The Calm Capitalist
I think it’s just human of so many to be so JEALOUS of others
Who cares what her age is, or what some say gravity is setting in! She’s very beautiful and a real person who has achieved so much. A Bunch of HATERS on here and Social Media, Seriously
It's so beautiful, I'm obsessed with arches and there are so many ached windows and entryways, it's beautiful. It's just a little too perfect, it's missing personal items and pictures
Bikes, skateboards and motorcycles.  What no elephants?
I absolutely love Travis Barker!  So super chill.  He’s a walking miracle.  If you have not read his book, read it!!  My favorite drummer hands down. 🙌🏾
Loved the way he profoundly talked about his interior designer. It really shows the impact the person had on Travis' life. I'm sure the guy wasn't expecting a shout out. It's dope.
Nothing more punk rock than owning a mansion
Listening his voices I really could fall asleep anytime. So therap6
Zero personality, like living in a sterile modern arts museum, everything done by someone else, all the celebrities so called homes look alike, completely void of any humanity.
Dudes the ultimate role model for straight celebrity men
They have more clothes than a shop stockroom.
Dude survived a plane crash, hope he can survive a Kardashian
This is just amazing.
Leave it to a vegan to let you know their vegan if you know you know😂
How punk rock...........
Does anybody know,  what 5 albums are on that painting?
Lmao absolutely thought that was Voldemort for a  second
I like minimal I had a three story house but it was just too much (for real appreciate him saying that) but now I have a modest just under 10,000 square feet
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉   😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
I love you Trav, but that’s your wife’s house now
This is absolutely perfect ❤
Travis is a vibe okayyy
Money + no brains= THIS
love Op Ivy. wish Members of Rancid would round them back together for a reunion tour
Travis Barker is so healing, and Alabama is so cute. I LOVE PROJECT X
Y’all don’t get how  fashionably European tacky it is but I love it and I’m jealous of it
Wow! I’m not a fan of his music but Travis seems cool, centered, cultured and worldly and obviously intelligent. I love the layout of the house and the kitchen is awesome! I love the clean lines throughout if not his tastes in furniture. I used to live in Southern California and driven by Calabasas many times and the place is like a monument to massive mansions with the shrubbery and tress to match. Side note: Kourtney is the fine and natural one among the Kardashian ladies. RESPECT.🙏🏿
these people are living in a simulation.
💫🍂
His calmness is zen
I love TB, but I can't help but laugh when a millionaire w/ a mansion and fleet of luxury cars describes their aesthetic as "minimal".
both these psychopaths have been following me around like the crazy people they are. More Hollywood idiots trying to drug and Sodomize me to death.
Honestly threw me when he said Escalade, I thought it was a sedan.. Then I realized it was cause it was sitting next to the G-Wagen 😅
Anyone ever thought his voice doesnt match his face?
Life goals: "LeBron didn't pick up his gold Dior bike - if you want it, it's yours today."
He seems so settled and mature. I'm glad Kourtney found stability and certainty.
Tanto lujo y nos morimos y era..y no somos nada
Travis just gave me an idea of some settlement with his 5 favorite albums, but of my favorite
He looks like the young Heaven Gate leader Marshall Applewhite.
So edgy
Travis B is like a tatted Shaolin Monk. 🔥
I love Travis barker and I really wish I was rich!!!!!
I agree with Travis it’s easier to live in a house with a flat ceiling as opposed to a vaulted ceiling with recessed lighting
Loved this tour. Life, family balance, all his loves incorporated in a really beutiful way. Stunning design :)
That's really punk rock, lol
The buick 😮‍💨
His outfit is goofy and stoopid looking.  Who sold him that jumpsuit.?  Why is is Kourtney sitting on the counter.  Sorry. What a foolish couple.
Dudes honestly kind of a weirdo
Horrible colour, very de-energising and soulless.....to bring vibrancy and to lift ones spirit and be calm, colour needs to be in-corporated and I've noticed that many so called celebrities use that awful colour, why!?
I like driving cars. Im a car guy. I love cars.
3:55 well that seemed natural
SID VICIOUS
Only
I wish you guys would show more of the exterior elevations of homes so we can get a sense of the overall architectural style of the façade.
Dude, i love travis, but this is too much. Its like a satire of cribs. "I love this wooden post. Its just... my vibe..." "This is where we eat delicious vegan food.". "what are you doing schmookems? Oh, just drinking your world famous matcha tea.". Its comical.
Now he’s with the witches so does that make him a warlock?
Omg that Buick is amazing
Just to create his closet room takes a forever
Is he wearing a leather straight jacket?
this is so punk rock!
travis looks like in the wrong house
SUPER ❤ LOVE ❤ SUPER ❤ 🎉❤🎉❤
The Buick Grand National GNX was also available in 1986 as well. C'mon, bro. Get your $h!+ straight.
“ what are you doing?”   While he’s looking at her and can see what she’s doing
Such a chilled, family-oriented guy
I'd love to know who cleans this house. I mean, when you're rich you aren't going to do it yourself.
Blink 182 is fire
Dude is a straight clown now.
One of the most humble men in showbiz.
I like Travis. He is such a chill person and his house is a dream.
I saw that before i think, and i loved it ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
boring!
wtf is this weirdo wearing lol
House is gorgeous. Obviously they omitted the 5 or 6 kids rooms in the house.
"It also vibrates..." 😮
Awesome house! Fantastic backyard!
Did  u see that pillow move? wtf!!
I'm obsessed with deor furniture
GENUINE VIBES - I LOVE IT
I don't know this gentleman or his music, but I can certainly see what Kourtney sees in him. I am impressed 🥰
I found the video to be exceptionally enlightening.
I hope they have happiness
Wow this was nice Travis seems so cool calm and collect. The house seemed very believable and liveable, not overly in your face I guess very cool calm and collect lol .
Travis sounds like a decent human. His attraction to serial marrier unexplainable. House is okay a little staged and showy.
How did his 1st wife let him go! Top quality!
cool Travis
So classy ❤
I love Travis he is perfect for Kourtney ❤
That’s funny I got married on October 17th. Best day of my life.
Do not talk about matcha if you dont use  matcha whisker to make it 😂
Ha he's married to Kourtney... That poor poor soul !
the house is “minimalist” until you see their giant walk in closet with all their stuff  what a hypocrite
I think it's so hilarious that he walks into the kitchen. And Kourtney's just casually sitting there.... drinking a Macha and  on her laptop in a perfectly pressed oversized button up... That happens to match his outfit.. LOL.
This is Anna Wintour!
Your macha sucks
not a single sign of 182 on his house, very disappointed.
I wanna see your real house. If this is it then i wanna see how you really live in your house
Modern, yet rustic n serene, I like the vibe
Kourtney is just so funny to me 😂😂😂
Motorcycle is his choice of exit lol sweet
He definitely did not design or even care. He just did it for the camera.
Just watched. Very cool. Travis is so humble.
Who the F*CK   is this  CREEP ????
Without helmet where does he drive...to the pool ;-)
house without character
I love rich ppl that know how to spend their money
Trav definitely has one of the most chill and cozy celeb homes I ever seen
The best tour guy ever.he can do that too😀😀😀
My IQ just dropped.
Well done!
SHE CALLED FOR YOU ALONG TIME, HUH 🤔
Travis is a dope human being
Thats Not how I expected Travis Barker to live 😄
10:28 the name of the candle.
Amazing video. New fan for sure... That Grand Nash tho? EPIC! :P
Travis is such a chill guy
He's such a soul vibe 😍
I like him now, after watching this. He just seems so kind, calm and grounded. You can also tell he is an amazing dad.
Amazing! Love for Travis and his family!
Absolutely awesome travis, stay strong my friend. ❤🌏✌
He's about as punk rock as Ed Sheeran and MGK are.
😊what were the records? Noticed the wall pink floyd
organic mattres and vegan food🧐🧐but does he love this two things only cuz are Kourt's favorites?
❤❤❤❤❤
The G Wagon.... it's the best "part of the house tour"
My favorite ❤
My OCD makes me wanna go and put all same colored pillows together OMG why intercalated colors? 😅 love this style the way he speaks and how they’re all vegan! ❤
Grey
What a weirdo
So classy I absolutely love it
I love how lovingly he speaks about his girl.
🔥❤
its refreshing seeing a celeb staying in one house and not constantly moving and changing homes for trends
him saying or referencing his family in almost every room and items in the house makes my heart melt
Veľmi pekne bývanie pozdravujem všetkých ľudí a prajem krásne leto ❤️❤️❤️
he honestly speaks a lot different then what he looks.
Travis .... a Dior BMX bike??  I thought u were show off a prized Diamond Back or a Torker or a RED LION OR A HARO.. instead a Dior....
The designer did a phenomenal job!  Love the huge spaces!!. The designer did a phenomenal job!  Love the huge spaces!!.
I never heard of him before Kourtney
Lol I love the way kourtney is just sitting on the kitchen worktop
4:20 that doesn't look like matcha station to me. I don't see no bamboo whisk with holder or matcha mixing bowls and the matcha looks like it's low quality of I had that kind of money as they have I would have bought premium ceremonial matcha the highest quality and proper tools.
I am floored by how calm and collected and in the moment he is. He is not your typical 'celebrity'. He seems more human and relatable than most.
Beautiful  thankyou for sharing Travis
If he was working a 9 to 5 job.....not a chance
xoxo
🥁 🥁🥁
Omg, That Grand National is FIRE!!!!!🔥 Love it❤.
I am so happy for kourtney... let her live her life.. so proud of her......I hope travis and kourt lived together forever
I love the fact that Travis is a family guy. The way he’s explaining the seating arrangement is really cute. He even mentioned all the presents with pride! Hope he and his family always blessed 🎉❤
Ur such a nice guy Travis :)
I don't see anything special about the inside... I love the Front door Entrance
What an absolute bell end
@12:15 a tarantula in Calabasas? Had to look this up because I thought he was full of it. Aphonopelma eutylenum is a species of tarantula that lives in California. Sleep well Californians with arachnophobia
He speaks just like Kourtney - its bizzare
Gross 🤢
He feels so feminine to me now
Travis is so gentle and calm total family guy ❤️
Don't show it will be shown against you
I love this guy’s being!! I’m so happy for Kourtney!!!! Yesssss
Every description was around FAMILY, REST
I love kourtneys smile ❤❤❤
Count how many times he says the word "Like."
They are perfect for each other
I love how kourtney and Travis don’t live together but are married
Wow I can listen to  him all day
Seems like a chill dude , but Scott must be reeling
It's incredibly lovable how he always brings up Kourtney's name as soon as his eyes laid on things his fiancee gave him.
Travis comes across as such a chill person.I have to say though I am not into his plain jane colors in his home.I would expected him to have color everywhere for some reason
Serial killer vibes 😵‍💫
He is seriously the sweetest.
Ugh...it's soo pedestrian 😹
freeky dude
Aka paint it all cream, keep it minimalist, a few palms and done
So glad the both of found each other now where’s the baby’s room lol
You have such a big heart ❤
Very nice
Beautiful couple
I see what kourtney sees in him more now..his soo cool and calm ❤
So I woke up this morning, and was like, yep, today is definitely a leather jumpsuit today. ... I totally get it. I have a tough time myself choosing WHICH leather jumpsuit I want to pick outta my OWN closet. Decisions decisions😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
WTF SHE SEES IN YOU .. DAMMM
travis barker been that dude. he was the quietest one in blink 182... i love this for the both of them. such a cute couple!!!
Phenomenal video…would love to see his vintage tshirts
Many Blessings  to the entire family.❤
B-E-A-U-T-I-F-U-L ❤
Such a sweet guy.
Hey, my name is Travis Barker and i was just cleaning the sewers
Kourtney Kardashian has lots of boundaries. They are insane.
Why is he in a body bag ?
❤️‍🔥
Something very calming comforting and real about Travis...
Adorable couple ❤They seem so loving and harmonious 🙏
As a dude i see why she choose him, dude is a boss.
Loved so eloquent and Kourtney is very fortunate
He seems like such a sweetheart too bad he's with Courtney
They're both so calmed and relax. I see why Kourt fell for him. He's so gentle , intelligent, and family oriented. Its actually refreshing to see
Omg, Travis on lil wayne album. When I first heard him play, I was like I want to look this person up and take interest."you are phenomenal,  magnificent, and humble. You deserve the best....
You Really Rock
Love his design. I must say I was a little surprised by this!
Funny he started with his house, his room, his this,l and that, but the dining room is "ours" lol.
I love how he always says “I love, I love, I love” about all of his things.
October 17th my B Day Kourtney is the only one who hasn't sold her soul like the other WITCHES AKA MOM N ALL SISES
Travis! Market the table lamp you designed with the skull pullchain. If I could buy one for my daughter, I would be the best mom ever. Think about it, sweetie.
Thank you Mr n Mrs Barker Love It
Omg ...Travis n Adam Levine look alike😮
His voice is so chill. I could listen to him read a thesaurus and still feel comforted 😂
Such a humble dude. Relationship goals. 😂
What is the attraction?
Yay vegan food ❤❤
The grand National😍😍
He's obviously better for his wife then Scott but I really think Scott's way cuter but did not treat her as well. Scott cared about his variety instead of the woman he really loved. Pretty depressing but I get it
Kind of funny they have such a small TV I would have liked a theater room if I had his kind of money orr at least a gigantic TV
They both give me the creeps
Very soft talk in a men I like that .Never thought he was so calm.
I can see why kourtney loves him, he seems to be so happy and laid back! Beautiful crib!
Trying to keep up with The Lord on cars? He has you beat...
DUDE you are a smuck offer nothing to society...
Lol vegan that likes to grill hot dogs & burgers 🤔 not a true vegan I guess
Travis is cool but then came Kourtney
Despite how amazing this house looks, the best part is actually Travis… He just looks like the most fun and genuine person you could meet.
This house says it all. Simply classical. Ur both twice blessed by having each other. Always admired Kourt for what you value n having Travis seals it all. May the Lord richly bless you n your lil bundle..soon.
I like Travis he's the nicest guy in the whole world
That has to be one of the most boring designed houses I've ever seen.
“I love lamp”
Wow, this proves never judged a book by its cover !
I loved all his cars,I’m a car person I’ve owned a bunch... I don’t think I would want all my cars black... He has a gorgeous house...
I love seeing these two together.  They have such peace as a couple.
Nice
I wonder if they'd even be together if either one wasn't rich and famous
LE FALTA CALOR DE HOGAR
Why couldn't I have a dad like this.
Nice and homey.  Very comfortable and beautiful.
What a cool life this dude has lived and is living 🤗
It’s just dawned on me that it was the Kardashians who introduced the word ‘like’ in almost every sentence. I live on the other side of the planet and it’s prevalent here. Can’t stand it.
V🌎👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️👁️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Kim Kardashian wish 😭😭😭🤣
I love it so they are such a beautiful couple 🥰
I never understand how they don’t wear helmets on bikes in the States.
Travis is really cool and love his house. Kourt is one lucky lady!
This was more like a Cribz episode.
Beautiful house
Nice
jumpsuits r neva gonna happen gretchen quit trying to make jumpsuits a thing.
WOW HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS, TRAVIS I LOVE THE WAY U LOVE KOURT😍😍
WTF is he wearing LMAOOO
Love the furniture
That outfit 😂😂😂😂😂
I gotta say you can truly see how much they care for each other and how he’s just about her and she seems like she can relax. Everyone deserves that in life
Wtf is he wearing
His house is very amazing❤
Felt so calm watching this 🥰 I forgot what I was doing 😅😅❤
The way Kourtney looks at Travis is pure joy. It is nice to see her happy
Its not my taste but it is beautiful and I can appreciate it.
Just cold.
love the fireplace with the stone seating!
(July 3, 2023) 11:12. 11:37
I can see why Kourtney fell for him. I didn’t get it at first, but l definitely see the appeal.
Cool to hear him speak!. 💥 Nice house!. 💥
Very relaxing demeanor. He seems kindhearted and loving
Love the band, but he's only famous/rich because he's the last standing member.
wow! He's a really nice guy!
Kourtney is ew
He seems like a beautiful person!
So rich !
If Travis and Kourtney were smart they would move as far as Kourtney's nutso family!!!!!!
❤️
I like the look of his house, which is odd, because I don’t like the way he looks.
Шкафы бы открыл
Congrats on baby sweet couple have a healthy safe delivery Kourtney dear lots of love
He has achieved every form of celebrity status. Best drummer on earth.😊
Gorgeous house
💝🇲🇦👑🌟👏💝🇲🇦👑🌟👏💝🇲🇦👑🌟👏💝🇲🇦👑🌟👏💝🇲🇦👑🌟👏💝🇲🇦👑🌟👏💝🇲🇦👑🌟👏💝🇲🇦👑🌟👏
He says.."My house, my everything".
I love how he downsized because he recognised that a 3 story house is just too much. Although this house is still a Mansion lpl
I really love that he can name where each of his family members sit at the dinner table, that’s beautiful
Stupidity incarnated !!
I’m over here just trying to survive in America in 2023. Meanwhile …… look at my mansion ! 🙄
The pretentiousness is so off the scale.
I hope he and kourt can get one more baby after their son is born lol. I would love for them to have a combined like 12 kids lololol
I love Travis ❤
He’s literally the male version of Kourtney. They are so perfect for each other. When she’s with him, her eyes sparkles. I’m so happy for her!
I know why Kourtney loves Travis so much now. He's calm, centred and values his family so much. 16 years in one house is something else and shows his personality x
I love how softly spoken, kind and down to earth he is, I can clearly see how him and Kourtney fell in love and joined families ❤ Stunning house!
He is a cool guy
he sounds so sweet
he used to be the cool drummer until he said matcha station...
This is best house i seen.
When you re such an empty narcicist that you have to fill your life and ego with "stuff".... I don't know if I feel sorry for him or contempt.
WOW
“Are you still looking for the gold Dior bike? LeBron never came and picked his up so you can have it”  What a different lifestyle we live lol
He looks like a freak
This is illuminati poeple.
Travis seems like such a nice guy.  I like the cross on his head that sits upright and NOT upside down.
It’s cosy minimal it’s not minimal minimal ❤
Kourt was a stylist person and now she’s a emo 🖤 person wearing all black.
Now you like automatically inclined cars or zigzag cars that shift
You should try a Chrysler cordoba
My broken phone works better than my brand new phone why is that
I was gonna say I love this red and black montecarlo and I had a red and black car I ain’t never heard of parked in my driveway so I just thought setup because you know lol 😂 ummm GTA real life
Dude do you own the tarantula I’d smash Um
Omg there’s other people in legend movie now idk how they arrived I’m listening to Travis
Grayscale is in my headdddd zombie ahahahahahah yinz wanna go to a cabin I got a few of em
October is the best month
I paint 🎨 on my grandfather’s walls up in this house it used to be part of the Underground Railroad
This is like a bootleg verison of MTV cribs
I LOVE hearing him talk, express himself,  and feel his energy.  I wish Kourtney and him much joy and happiness.
Being famous and rich is one of the worst things to happen to this boy.
I wonder why he had so much tats on his body, especially his face….his house seemed peaceful.
Travis' energy is so soft , gentle and warm.
I hope I can build a house like This for My mom One day 😭😭😭
cool guy but he looks like clown.
Gorgeous!! I love your taste. It’s chic modern yet cozy.
Hearing Travis talk about energy makes me laugh, being around Kourtney everything is energy or epic....LMFAO 😂😅😅😅😅😂😂
Looks can be deceiving, people. You wouldn't even guess that a tattooed rocker lives in such a calm and zen place. I've always admired Travis. He's so chill.
Why is he speaking like that lol
The Buick grand national 🖤🖤🖤🔥
Kourtney needs someone soothing and uncomplicated like this.
Se callo delante de todos  los pupis ricos bye nene.
Is that Ghee at the Matcha station?
10:59 Anyone else see the ghost during this clip of Trav’s bed?? 👻
Everything in his house hold some sort of sentimental value to him and I love that. I didn’t know if enjoy this video as much as I did, he’s really a great guy and his house? STUNNINGGG!
I love her with him  best thing that ever happen to her  she don't have to worry  about anything anymore  😊
i wonder is he ever really read those books ?
I’ll take “when you lose touch” for $1000
Wow ❤❤❤❤😮😮
Lol what is he wearing?
Did he dress like a Scorpio on purpose? Lol 😂
Kourtney and Travis truly are soulmates. The years they spent alone and torchered payed off when these two found each other. I am so happy for them ❤
So this is what selling your soul looks like?
What a chill dude!
Travis always been one of my favorite celebrities!! Always loved his personality and style🖤🖤🖤
im surprised theres barely any trace of blink 182. not even a mention i think?
Those paintings are really tranquil!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Stare, slack jawed at money, you sheep.
Homie is pretty dope
Kourtney acting like she just woke up, while posing on the table with a full face of makeup 😂😂
Se me aflojaron las heces de la emoción.
His vibe, the way he speaks is just amazing
He
beautiful soul. great musician and a peaceful mind. Big fan
Boring  sorry looks very puer and fantasy less
I so hopes this works out, the last thing the public needs is more kardashian divorce nonsense.
عادي اقول رأئي بيتك شرشوح فيه قطع صغيرة بكل مكان زحمة وتوزيعة غلط والوانه غلط وباين فلوسك قليله بيت كانييه احلى من بيتك
so much negativity in this house...wow
The Low Rider S at the end was cherry
Beautiful house! Travis works hard and deserves everything he has. I'm happy for him.
You cant say you love cars and have that collection. Only who shares the passion of what it is to have love for need for speed will understand.
Agree, his voice is very soothing...love this.
Just another r list celebrity dropping names
loving his house style a lot....
So travis is vegan?
Kourtney is a lucky mother f
He has such a soothing voice lol
yo its tha homie!
He seems so amazing
vegan food???? 😂😂😂
Dosn't anyone wonder that the rest of the world lives in poverty and in basically mud huts and shanties. Mortages cannot be paid, homelessness is rampant in the USA and most of the western world and here we have this channel showing the wealthly basically bragging. Look at me I am a 1%.
Talking Kourtney like they've been together for centuries lol Calibasas........bunch of extra'd out people doing the most.
First time I’ve ever heard him talk
Esa no es la casa de un rokero, es la casa de un pijo, mucha pinta, pero luego...
Satanists who had a satanic “wedding” “married” by a literal satan worshipper. I hope zoe la see this comment. Evil scumbags. I pray you are brought down.  Matthew 13:9 KJV: Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
I love Alabama ✌🏼
got mad TV cribs vibes
There ain't nothing in Calabasas but it's better than the celebs that live in Ohio. Travis seems level headed, chill and his own person. He has a calm energy. Bless him and his family.  He's also dressed like a Blade movie club vampire lol 🧛‍♂️
I want a vibrating bed!!
does anyone know what that picture is at 7:20 -thanks
He acts just like a female😂😂😂😂😂
I really enjoyed this tour so much! It is breathtaking and I'm so glad that he and Kourtney are happy together. He's such a cool guy!
This made me realize how badly I need to clean out my garage and my junk drawer  Ughhhhh if only I could pay someone to do it for me 😅 Hey Travis! Do you need keyboard 🎹 player? I took 9 years of piano lessons. They only place I’ve ever got to play is at recitals and church lol It’s been a few years since I’ve been able to play. I’d love to be able to play music.
ALL THAT MONEY LOOKS LIKE A PIG DRESS LIKE A PIG THEY ARE PIGS
Helmet when riding a motorbike …
Concrete ping pong table is the best idea EVER!! Weatherproof.
Beautiful Ya'll.  So happy for you two.
"I' "my"
That’s my bday hahah
In german we say: schön spießig!
Skulls??
Tattoos are scary.
Well if you think Courtney is going to clean your house either crazy she's about to leave this thing you ever met but you'll find that out
Very beautiful and calm ..awesome taste 🇨🇦
he totally talks like the kardashians like totally...yea totally
What a super guy. So relaxed. 🫶🏼
I'm bored?
So this is what punk rockers become with money.... martha stewart
Love the house, but I sure would like to know how to make the best matcha!!!
What a calming gentle voice and presence he has. I fell asleep listening to him. I love that he has a love for details.
Wow. It’s minimal, but not… empty. I like. And, that jeep was inSANE.
cool
I cant explain how much I Love your Love, I am Soo happy for you both, your relationship is very inspirational to me and the house is beautiful and soothing
The guy is never home to truly enjoy that beautiful place, whats the point of being rich and famous then..
Wow, what a genuinely lovely home & man. He has such a calming voice and energy. I trust a man that is that into matcha!
Wait it is just me or the pillow moved by himself 10:55
Wack
Create doors that open? 🤔 He means automatically
Wow, I’m surprised. Travis impressed me. Beautiful house. I’m the same way- less is more.  I love that he appreciates the history his family has created in that home.   That’s how it should be
🎉 super video! I love watching and making positive videos! Hello everyone from Missouri!🎉
what a nice guy!
Everlasting happiness!!!!
Looks like he's taking fashion advice from nerf gun larry.
Task 14
Nice
Hi
Nice
Such a great guy, can so see why he and kourt gel so well.
I literally watched everything without skipping. I enjoyed watching... Love you both...
So happy for Kourtney Barker. She looks so happy and her life is shared beautifully with a beautiful person.
Wohnen die da oder ist das ein Ausstellungshaus ?
That candle scent at 10:28 though
Travis look is nothing when he speaks. He seem so soft spoken. This is really literal that we can never judge a person by how they look. He is so calm and collected. Cute that kourtney ended up with him. Hope that they would last longer.
Wow! Courtney looks so like Chris here
Gorgeous home
Clive Barker’s passive aggressive Hellraiser 😅
Lv u and kourtney Travis beautiful home
Pure Punk Rock 😂 Dont touch it
May bee next wecan
Giga ills call vert da fanpire
If I had a choice of Wich car to Dash in it be the one heading to your Rd because being a little bit of a demographic transition of consumed image yours has remained reflecting agitation over forced connection desired curves and your shade highlights it your cue to hue from day one it's personal security to provide footage of how your sister and mom became idolized over a sex tape turning girls going wild into politics visual version of run the jewels and Why for me it's obvious it's What your dad would of wanted just deserts and next level friends going covertly cray cray ola color of shade is a ray bow and arrow is phobia. I'm not the problem your family isn't the in go rinse is and gargle Mel trust me I love to pick on the one I love the most due to great expirations and as an underground member of the rail road check the booker T Washington Heh heh heh..in my best Gaga voice trying to be the Quinn but just a at one  point in the Womb penis that became a lady twin
Very nice. What an interesting story. Awesome house and collections. Have to confess he surprised me. He comes across much more down to earth than I imagined. Seems they're quite happy.
🩷🩷🩷🩷🩷
Im sorry to say it but it looks like a house that's for sale...there's no random cups or newpapers or bottles....it doesn't look like someone is living there yk....but at the same time im asking myself...how do u keep a house with so many people in it so clean?
What a beautiful home! Travis seems nice! Wish I were rich!
“I like minimal” covered in tattoos lol 4:51 nothing against tattoos just pretty hilarious a minimalist with head to toes in tattoos
Aww what a nice guy :) !
Literally multiple chairs in every room…. Guess I’ll sit on the counter top
Wow i never expected him being such a calm nice soul
What is he wearing? Good lord he looks absolutely ridiculous
Is this guy on chemo for fun?
Can I mention how I've always only seen pictures of him, and now, after seeing a video of him, talking, it literally just changed how I viewed him on a total 360...I should've just trusted Kourtney's judgement 🙃
how do you turn on a fireplace and chill ? loljk
Beautiful home of a beautiful family……..❤
He so ugly
😏Excuse me , my bad wifey! but that man is FINE asf -🤫🤭😜I just HAD TO SAY that🙃
Beautiful home,  and amazing FAMILY  memories
Sell out, not even one nice car as well, so sad. Btw your idea of art is crap, on your body and on the walls. Yes you play drums well, but never have you been in a band that needed it or wanted it.
You would think with all that money his lamp looks like he got it at DG
These houses always look like expensive hotel rooms, instead of a home. Sad. Empty. Lifeless.
Why is everyone saying “never judge a book by its cover.” Just because someone has tattoos doesn’t mean they’re an inherently bad person. Just like someone whose clean cut doesn’t mean they are not inherently kind people. Why does someone’s external appearance ever factor into who they are as a human being?
such a calm guy
Very clever guy … 👍🏽
Very tasteful and very Nordic
Quiet and tranquil place 💕
抹茶おいしいよね꒰ 🍵 ꒱❤❤❤
Seeing him and Kourtney in the kitchen made me really happy for some reason , I’ve never seen yet so happy in a relationship
Good lord his house is beautiful
1:44 that wooden page holder is sick
HE SOUND SO SOFTTTTTT
We'll just have to see how long he's going to stay with we all know she's the laziest one of the Kardashian girls
Your house is so beautiful ❤️ what's going to look like when Courtney moves in it won't be that beautiful
Yes you do got a beautiful house see how beautiful it is when Courtney moves in that house ain't going to look that good
Elio via sta andando in campagna poi lo mandavano a parlare con mamma per riportare alla nipote figlia Francesca via a Olbia e parenti a Lula alle sette e poi in fontana
Seems link nice guy, but wtf he be wearing? Not everything looks gd just coz u famous, or got money! You look absolutely f'ing stupid. #jussayin #werewaldo
Its not ugly, but as far as luxe renos go, this one is vanilla.
he is an ideal men
L🖤VE Travis
*them sunken in eyes with absolutely no eye socket fat, screams "VEGAN" -- no need to even mutter it*
Plane
Hotels 4. Record. Also wifi
There's no squatters rights in Greek
2 annoying people
Travis is sooo comforting
PEACE OF MIND in your OWN place of residence Is the most important thing to have. 🎉
This guy surprised me, but when he showed the bikes I was shocked 😃🤩
Travis Baker idGAFf about goddess... Man just cuz my dad lame doesn't mean to make my life lame
10:27, "this smells like kourtneys orgasm" hahaha
He really loves it seams, she is always in his toughts. So sweet!
Sweet bro! Peace
So cool you guys!!!!!!!! ^_^ gorgeous !!
I do like a bit of 'evidence of the hardcore life of Travis Barker'.  This is easily the funniest thing I've seen in a long time.  Thank you Travis, you always provide us with a face-palm and giggle-cramps.
I like this man.
El es horrible viste feo
its actually pretty simple and chill
Beautiful home 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
When did he go so woke
Typical punk rock home 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
that has got to be the douchiest outfit ive ever seen
How has nobody mentions the candle that says “This Smells Like Kourtney’s Orgasm?” I respect
God bless y'all with more Travis 🙏
With his money he should be able to dress nicely.
Koja govna
When he said “ a little bit of shoes in here…” I feel broke 😂
Der ist so nett ...ich dachte immer das wäre ein voll Deep ...bin positiv überrascht.
Who cares
Why give this cheating piece of sht any attention?
Why is he wearing a trash bag
❤❤❤❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
But how do we get paid for viewing this in their app
Oh ya ternyata putuskan aku saja, jangan sakit gigi lagi lagipula beberapa persembahan rekreasi sedarah mencari kamu hmmm terbuka lebihnya mohon dicatut kiumennya seperti purbakala...
Travis seems like a humble, nice guy. House is really boring tho ngl
Lovely home for Travis and Kourtney! They seem very happy there.
where is scooter?
🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Nice digs, who are you?
What the hell happened? He’s wearing makeup, super feminine, vegan. I don’t care what anyone says Macha is gross. The Kardashian’s ruin everything they touch.
I love ❤️ how she let him do the house tour and didn’t take over like her family of women normally does.She let him lead as the man of the house and I absolutely 💯 love her for that.Keep shining Girl and keep your family at a distance if you want to continue to be happy. Much love ❤️
I’m like him.I do not like a lot of people in my home never have.No shade but Kourtney has found someone just as weird as she is.This is a different Kourtney and I like it.She has broken away from her family like she always wanted to.This house is so not her,but she seems to be happy and that makes me happy for her.I wish them the very best…🎉Change is good…
Sublime character
This dude is so grounded, jeez. Just love his energy
it’s the succubus and the tattoo
Plane crash please!!
"This is a one story house, just under 10000 square feet." 💀
I love the idea that a punk rocker is dating this super exotic beautiful woman, Gives us other Punkers hope we can land normal non-alt women
His voice is so soothing, and this house is just amazing
I came for the house I stayed for the life stories
3:52 lol so weird
Dude sound so humble and down to earth. Congrats to him as lots of people in his position sound so cocky.
One story houses are so underrated. What a beautiful house and vibe throughout this whole video. Zen accomplished ❤️
Seems like a genuinely nice person
Goofball extrodinaire
He looks so weird like a horror movie thing
That's a nice house. Compared to how Travis grew up. Wait he's always been a rich suburban kid. Next please 🥺😗
its nice that this kardashian is cool enough to disappear and not be the center of attention
Love how they have the same seating arrangement!  Amazing tradition
Wow. He's such a pretentious w*nk. Worse than my videos.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Wow they got six kids
What a magnificent house 😍
Best home tour I've seen. All of it has so much meaning, Travis is a great father, to remember his children growing up having a lot of fun in that house and where they sit every time they eat is very special. Them cars though, great taste 👌
Kourtney really looks happy
Who would of thought a bodybag would be so fashionable? Thanks Travis
how much are the property taxes ?
Haha these people have such. OVERBLOWN EGOS that they actually believe people care about this...GET HELP !! UNTREATED EGOMANIA is not Cool, pretty, or Attractive.
10:29 the candle💀💀💀
WHAT a JOKE..BOTH HIM & HIS "WIFE". LOL
What band was he in? Is he the most famous band member?
I really Love Travis's Home Style. Its a place for living. Not for show people how rich and famous you are.  this is Home. it could be my home perfectly. ;-)
I thought the lady from Happy Days died
Guy builds his unmodern house thinking he has some villa. My friend who is definitely not a millionaire has longer windows without those stupid frames than you. The kitchen handles are terrible. Learn something about modern architecture, go to south America, and ask some real architects. But yeah, there is obviously a lack of good taste considering the music he is producing.
Omg his presence is so calming!  Like how down to earth he is.  Beautiful home
Ok but why does he look like Jeffree Star if he was straight
This guys voice and tone is so calming
Beds can be toxic.... says the dude with so much ink injected to his skin....
delicious vegan food yes!
Yo Travis you have come a long way since Physico butterfly and Fontana.
Isn't that dude nearly 50? Dress your fookin age mate
he is a Kardasian now. will identify as a women soon. that what kardasians do.
What are you wearing as an adult man. Sort it out mate.
His fiance is hot as hell
I pray to god that this man stays the way he is. The women from the Kardashian clan have a knack for sucking the soul out of the men in their lives.....
sellout
he used to be a punk
Dudes straight wierdo
It's a beautiful home ..... not just a house .... I love it !
There is no emotion here...flat, dead...lifeless voids. The music is terrible...wtf is wearing and how can anyone honestly find this entertaining?
How long will this cardashian marriage last? My guess, 1 kid and 2 years. A long commitment for kourt
10:57 WTF
tyű de gazdag vagy vaze tesa aggyá egy cipőt gecc
his voice is so soothing, whenever i’m having nightmares i put this on and listen to him idky but somehow i feel very calm. love this man!
My First fav band was blink182. My First real concert was here in Italy in 2004 by them. Travis live Is a real topPlayer beast.even in the other things seems He Is the best guy out there. Realest and a real O.G in music, Realest lovely dude in Life.  Solo Amore
“A tarantula scared the crap out of me and loves vegan hotdogs” lmao 😅
did he say he met that girl and proposed to her the same day? huh
Did they catch him in the middle of decontaminating the place or somethin'?
He is so creepy
What is the purpose of this flaunting his relationship? Looks like kourtney made him SOFT now... LAME
Damn this guy looks like a meth head ..!!!
Super chill dude. Always been a fan of the work and now I'm a fan of the person
Sid Vicious mugshot!
This is the non fake version of MTV's "Crips". Nice. Love his house. Smooth and clean. Minimalist. Perfect dude!
Dude, you are so normal!!!  Just kinda like a normal guy who gets up in the morning, puts on his pants and go does his thing.  Except, you are a rock God, way talented, and super duper rich after you get up in the morning when you put your pants on.!!
Me, again.  Btw, love your band & the music.  I’m 75;, so old broads get it too
Travis…….super glad to “meet” you.  You look very unapproachable and kind of off putting, in magazines , & papers.  I should have known better.  You are way cool, nice, and seemingly it would be cool to talk to you.  Hi Kourtney……
looks like you still don't have enough chairs in your home...
I love watching celebrities trying to imagine a normal life of eating at a dinner table.
I love You and Kourtney together I hope it last forever bless your family you guys
Perfect example of a Vegan telling everyone they are a vegan!
Big, talented, hard-working rockstar with a normal house 😄
16 years?? Did he go broke and this is all he has? Unless he bought the entire cul de sac, it’s sad
I thought Kim said Courtney doesn't work?
Amazing drummer but a knucklehead. Face tattoo is first clue
07:58 - It's a Banksy's Flying Copper there
Love you family
Travis, I love your house Frankly in French style 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Ok what IS he wearing?
Not a fan of the band at all, but he seems nice and it is a truly astonishing house! I got curious why some objects and paintings are blurred?
What a super down to earth guy
So this is my trash bag…,.. I wear it.
Even dressing like a kard..   Sell out.
veggan food..... the look says he was told to say it haha
Borrriinnggg...I guess the only interesting thing about him is his wardrobe.
He’s so real. Why the kardashians
post-"punk" always heading the sellout way 🤡
What a beautiful home!
Why are the pans so choppy?! Change the camera settings or something. @4:33
nice crib
Ő kicsoda?
Scott Raynor was and still is the better drummer.
So calm😊 Give him a drum kit and he will turned into totally different person...
@2:23 "Eat delicious vegan food" while waiting a leather jumpsuit?! 🤣
All Kardashians homes and planes are beige ,beige and more beige. No personality. Kris' new house is warm and feels more like a home. Beige has no personality
Wow , their home is the definition of order, Beauty , comfort, uniqueness an love.
Awesome house.  I give it 5 to 8 years before Courtney turns you crazy and takes it away from you.   Sucks bro.
certainly not punk
This is the thing about big houses: you have a big wall, you build shelves or you put a shelving unit, the shelves are open, only serve to put decor instead of stuff that you actually use. I look at those shelves and I see clutter.
Strange child
Hmm.. no record room? i hoped to see a lot of Vinyl and Hifi Stuff. A bit dissapoiting :D But he is a nice dude :D
He looks awful
Like... I like it. Like really.
Was this kanye and kims house????
I’m a fan of Travis Barker now. Solid guy.
ewwww
Who is this guy!? Gross.
Did I just watch Derek Zoolander on MTV Cribs?????????
YES! October 17th is my Birthday...I knew it was a special day but not this special! Awesome tour Travis...Thanks for letting us tag along!
So what nothing impressive 😢
there is no excuse for wearing that nonsense......great drummer.....walking californian cliche
Absolute no need to mention say vegan every single time you mention food 🤦‍♂️
A 10,000 sqft ranch!
Man can speak
@3:54 kinda cringe
Travis I have one question did you enjoy playing the drums for Kennyhoolpa and do you enjoy playing for bling-182 and on more did Jenny hollow tell you if his is a new pop punk or a original pop punk and do you skate and ride dirt bikes like you said your kids have in the house
Damn, when did Moby get face tatts?
how could you marry a kardashian and how can you wear such a suit?
As soon as he gets done interacting with her he starts using the word love alot 😊
Мача - это санина по русски
My house is 13 and is rag 🥲
Operation Ivy on the painting, big wheel BMX, Grand National, .....
How much kourtney works 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
So, this is 'punk rock'. Interesting...
all those videos are fake and staged, nobody lives here usually you hang pictures of your family on the walls but there is nothing
He is the definition of don’t judge a book by its cover definitely.
WTF is he wearing…?😆
He seem want to be the matrix
Imagine living in that home but your only allowed to eat vegan hot dogs
Seems like a super sweet dude. I need his outfit.
Fair play 16yrs it's very unusual for a celeb to stay so long.
There's a lesson in here: Of all of the luxuries that this couple can afford, Travis admits his and Kourtney's sentimentality towards candles that they gave each other for Xmas. Whilst we all strive to own a huge house or 5 cars. Happiness comes from the little things.. We should all reevaluate what we NEED in order to be truly happy.. The rest is just noise.
He is pretty ugly, but seems like a kind person!
this is who mgk wishes he was
he is said to be the greatest Drummer that has ever lived
God these people are everything that's wrong with society.
hmmm
I love him even more after this video!
He has such good energy and good vibes he’s so relaxed and soft spoken
This is the most pathetic comment section in the history of life.
just made me love Travis even more
Am ii da only one dat saw pillow movedd ?!
That was very satisfying. Didn’t think I could like him more. 😍😍🤌🏾🤌🏾
Travis speaks woker nowadays.
Travis...thanks for the peek into your life.  We definitely see that you and Kourtney compliment each other. Wish you guys well.
Shout out to someone appreciating Raymond pettibon
I don't like Kourtney,  or Travis. If this marriage lasts 2 years, I would be very surprised
Oh so tight 🙄 always been a Travis barker fan but this is so cheesy, “we watched the ball drop and my prerecorded show” 🤦🏼‍♂️
wow. he's so narcissistic
This video made me feel so warm. Blessings to this family bro
Damn he's a mess. He looks sick or something. Whoever told these people face, neck and head tattoos were cool lied. They lied big time!!!!
A very surprising tour. I loved how he was family centered and that the people mattered not the stuff.  He didn't name the designer of every piece of furniture in his house.
for me it does not look like a home.
who is this?
Is he sick ? Looks frail as
❤❤❤
What's a Motcha?
“eat delicious vegan food” No
what id do to b rich
I love how him and his wife are just enjoying what seems like an amazing peaceful life. They’re truly blessed.
When Travis is describing his home in such a soft spoken  voice,you can sense the love he truly has for his peaceful space. What a humble guy!
Why would anyone spoil their bodies with those... tattoos?
what an absolute bellend
So he's gay now?
DON'T FOLLOW THIS GUY'S DIET, HE'S A VEGAN AND NOT ONLY LOOKS ANEMIC BUT HE ENDED UP IN THE HOSPITAL!! NOT A GOOD ROLE MODEL AT ALL...
These two are inspirational
Gorgeous house! And to be honest i had my opinion about him. But he comes across as a very nice genuine guy.
Hells teeth, what an utterly delightful gentleman.  Seriously, he is such a thoughtful & intelligent young man....with a lovely voice.  Thank goodness for him.
People seem  so surprised about how calm he is. Most rock artists are edgy on the outside but they are genuinely nice  people  on the inside!
I love how honest he is about not liking too many guests! most people brag about throwing parties, how crowded their homes are, etc. but in reality I don't like too many people at my place either.
He's an entire vibe on his own! Nothing but love for this guy 🖤
Doooood is a talker.
Cobeke iku maen vis
Number one I love his house and if I was rich I always say to everybody I don't want a million stairs and s*** to go up and down I want it all one level people who have a lot of stairs and big houses they don't use them stairs I'm telling you they gravitate to one or two rooms and they try to avoid those stairs so what it what good is that having all those stairs and not using them that's why I would want one level just like he said under 10,000 square feet right around there that's perfect who needs anything any more than that nobody
this guy is totally lost
Gla I stumbled on this video...cool home and even cooler guy x
Always nice to see that these stage rebels always live like any other materialistic bourgeoisie !
Makes me sick
Ugh. He’s so hot. 🫠
I wonder if still has the classics, i remember a show he was showing them on a while a back
He has good taste! Love it
What a lovely home. Inspiring and how proud the man is. I just love this. A homeoriented man that is so healthy and loving. It just shows how he loves his home. Good for you. Nice calming voice that guides us through. Thank you for inviting and  inspiring to my own house I am now building and soon finished..exciting with a home made and created for oneself and the most important people in our lives. Sanctuary and peace where only invited positive people and loving energies are so welcome.
Got good minimalist styling in the home...shame about bin-bag clothing though.
what a cool, calm, family oriented, down to earth person, this short film completeley changed the way I look at him now.
This home is about as punk as a corporate law firm. What a fraud.
wow. And his still hetero
This is the most cringe video I've seen. Vegan... minimalist really barker... w e floats the boat. Nothing but love but wow did I not expect this... lol
Yeahhhh wik+Wkkkk💪💪💪
Your abundance is very visible. So much blessed. I hope you inspire people who is recently in their ups and downs.
I never like Courtney Ex, I find him to be very arrogant!
❤🎉
vintage Bauhaus T 🖤🖤
Lots of people in the comments never learned to not judge a book by it's cover I see 😂
Is Travis B Asperger’s ?
Love your closet
Such a class act you really can’t dislike the guy even if u tried
Damn, if I saw a tarantula in or outside of my house, I might have to burn everything and start over. I wouldn't be able to sleep in there.
That jumpsuit, though...
What are the five albums on the painting?
Yeahh it would awesome to be able to come home and dive in that… the pool that is.
His so humble like he can actually give you some good advice I like it his awesome 👏
This is a nice space...a little too overly simple for my taste, though. Seems celebs tend to swing with super minimal or over the top lux ...If I had their money, Id be aiming for somewhere in the middle. His house doesn't match his industrial look. But he's clearly more grounded than he looks. Its easier to keep a space like this tidy cuz, you can tell when stuff has been left out ! Would love to see these spaces - with them actually living in it...with real life mess : D
Wow Travis, you’re such a punk Rocker more like a goof and sell out
Love travis, but mate if you buy the missus a bag for Christmas, then don't see it for three years,she maybe don't love it!!
And am in Africa struggling to pay rent in a one bedroom house
His voice is very calming
This is the most annoying home tour I’ve ever seen. I never want to hear “matcha” again
I still remember the days when he lived in Corona😒
That painting of his favorite albums is a really cool gift.
What a contrast with his tattoos and jumbo size condom suit, lol. It's really cool that he seems like such a good person and a good father. Makes me happy to see celebrities be able to have a calming space they can relax and be in private. Lots of other people give shame to famous or wealthy people but no matter how absurdly lucky or fortunate they may be, they still put tons of work in to get what they have; with the rare exceptions of people who just inherit wealth and are complete trash celebrities.  Me personally, the house is not my taste at all, too suburban and stale. Very Calabasas. I'm more of a mid-century modern or natural feel type though. Kudos that it brings him so much peace.
Why is he wearing a hazmat suit?
Who is Travis barker?
👍❤️Home...
He WAS so handsome. Stick ur D in a K ur contaminated. Sad.
If there's a camera, there's a Kardashian.
The vibe of his clothes are garbage bags?
Travis Barker doing a walk-through of his house is an SNL skit of Travis Barker doing a walk-though of his house.
I make the best Macha.......wtf
Does he really wear that outfit when no one's there?
sorry had to turn off after he started stroking her legs.... creepy weirdo
I'm a car guy   Leaves in motorcycle 🏍️
Such a nice dork
TB is so softly spoken
So they got engaged on the first day they dated? 🧐
The Wall, Op Ivy, and what are the other three albums?
He needs help
Very hip
It's hilarious to me how these preppie artists have images of Sid Vicious. If alive, Sidney would show up in this dude's house and barf and rampage all over. I met Sid in the 70s. the dude was a loser. But maccha coffee drinkers like this dude still don't get Sidney.
i bet his kids go in his closets all the time lol
I had no idea he was in a horrible plane crash.  I don’t know anything about him or his music.  I am not a fan of mega tattoos (I have a tiny one), piercings, shaved heads or Doc Martens. ..  but I could listen to this guy talk for hours!  What a human!! This guy is the real deal!! 🔥❤. 🥁🎸🎶
It surprised me how cute he actually is.
Wowwwww
Thank god he shouted out black flag and op ivy so he could keep pretending he’s super punk rock.
So he changed her wardrobe and she changed his interior design ok
Haha mrs kardashian wearing a ridiculous looking costume.
He looks sickly
I loved this guys vibe and how honest he was, but he had a somewhat snotty outlook or perspective and ONLY because of who he is now with lol
Beautiful
I'm sorry, WHERE are the FRENCHIES?
who told him he looked good in that
By far the best open door I’ve seen. Travis was chill, articulate and really detailed. Vibes
Tiene bonita casa el plomero
Beautiful house
I love your pool.  It's so glam like an old Hollywood film star's pool.....😁🇬🇧
now I know why Kourtney fall in love with him. he's cool, very calm and kind person. Don't judge a book!
IT’S TRUE WHEN THEY SAY “NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT’S COVER”… WAS NEVER A FAN SIMPLY BECAUSE I DON’T LISTEN TO HIS GENRE. IF I WERE TO ASSUME… HE LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE THAT’LL DRINK YOUR BLOOD. LOL BUT THIS DUDE IS SOFT LIKE A FEATHER. PERFECT EXAMPLE OF BEING 50/50 PASSIVE/AGGRESSIVE. EVERY GOOD GIRL WANTS A BAD BOY! IF HE UNDERSTANDS THE 50/50 BLEND. THIS GUY HAS THAT, 🤝🏾! I THINK THE LADIES COULD RELATE… FELLAS “THE FORMULA”: ALPHA IN THE STREETS/PASSIVE AT HOME! ALONG WITH COMPROMISING, & LISTENING! 🤝🏾
Omgoodness, I love their love for each other and the way they value family!! Love them!!
Having been bred, born & raised in Az., tarántula, scorpions, diamondbacks, horny toads, havalina, etc. where my toys to play with as a child. 🤷‍♀️
I saw Blink in 99 at warped tour.. I was 15. Such an amazing memory
I love Travis energy, no wonder why Kourtney fell in love with him. He seems like a nice guy!
Great vid. Awesome home and fleet! I like the minimalist vibe and agree it's great for clear thinking.
She is the only sister that's married
This was the best celebrity tour I've seen. Not cause his house was the best but because he truly appreciates everything he has and has sentimental values allover his house, but also a gorgeous house specially pool area. Courtney really traded up! After being cheated on so much by Scott now she has literally THE COOLEST guy on the planet👏👏👏👏👏
“How much kourtney works” LOOOOL
Travis looks so much happier now that he's w Kourtney ❤️
He has very good taste. His house is so beautiful, so inviting, the perfect place to live.
Not enough color in the house and every vehicle is black 👎
Omg she sounds like her mother,what a beautiful home
Omg she sounds like her mother,what a beautiful home
He's gonna be the best husband kort so pleased for you both
17.10. was also the date I found out I^m pregnant and I dreamed of being a mom all my life. AND we^re even having twins :D
👍👍
Everybody see this hard exterior I see a sensitive person lol he prolly a cry baby lol
Who cares about them lol.
Why do you look like a freak?
DEPRESSING...all that black, brown and beige in his/their decor. Morbid is the word. A home decor reflects the owner's personality.  I like color, lots of pretty Nature's colors. But to each his/her own.
Kourtney is the best the Kardashians have. Congrats
Travis Barker is so beautiful wow ..Him and Kourtney are blessed to have found each other ..Perfect couple , love from Australia
I would love to find a man like Travis he's so loving nd caring
I love that kitchen and art work!
Oh God you can tell he’s hanging out the Kardashians he sounds just like them so like literally
Thank you very much & you are very handsome person   With love from Moscow   🇷🇺
Got rid of the vaulted ceilings ?? Nooooo getting rid of that adds nothing to your minimalist look  , your interior designer just wants more money off of you lolll
delicious Vegan food haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
I loved the IKEA shelf unit.
Love that is not a house but a HOME.
Kourt is a lucky girl ❤
Hes a tranny loving pee pee smoocher! Kardashian was born a male! Gotta sacrafice the gender of you 1st born to be included in the Luciferian Secret Societies! WAKE UP ALL YOU HOLLYWOOD NUT HUGGING SHEOPLES!
are we gonna gloss over the candle that's names 'this is what kourtneys orgasm smells like'? bc i feel like that's not entirely normal
Hey I have this magazine you guys should definitely get it if you see it has a lot of beautiful homes he's the only guy that's in the book
......boorring
Amazing Travis 💙🏡💞💝👍🌞🦋beautiful life!!God Bless!!
Who is this person
It's the #SUPERORGANIZED house i've ever seen.. There are lots of super doooper expensive mansions and palaces AD had featured but Travis house is beautiful, neat, clean and just sooo #Perfect... I ❤️ it!
Never heard of him.
WHY IS KOURTNEY SITTING HALF NAKED ON HIS KITCHEN ISLE??? Gross!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wawoo I love everything that's in the house and the cleanness looks like no kids around yet they have kids
Literally feel calmed watching this, Travis & Kourtney have the most wholesome energy. Happy for them both, loved the video!
simplicity is the ultimate sophistication!
Travis Barker is the definition of never judge a book by its cover. He’s so amazing such a lovely man who adores his life and family ❤
This comments S_U_C_K
"This house is JUST 10000 square feet" 😂
A very beautiful home… but finally Kourtney with a laptop embracing internet, WiFi ate home😂😂 I just remembered a chapter when she said ‘it’s not about affording it’s more about radiation’😂😂😂she was hilarious
I'm very organized person, and his aura, mindset, the way he talks, and how he organizes himself is so satisfying!
You know for sure kourtney taking it up the butt now.
❤❤❤❤
Kourtney is winning! She deserves this man. Travis ur so amazing;)
What are the 5 albums?
What the hell
“When I spoke with him he had such a amazing energy” what a poser God it would horrible to be around this vegan a$$ not to mention Kortney and all the others he mentioned. This could be a PSA how not to become the worst humans on Earth.
Bro why is he wearing that outfit? It looks like hes about to get dominated 😆
This a table where I used to drink coffee
"How do you like my quasi-futuristic uniforms, Mr. Powers?"
I never knew white and black could look so good. I love the clean lines and not having too much stuff everywhere
did this dude say he proposed the day they first met?
this is just one story house with 10,000 square feet, he says it so calmly I cannot even picture a 10,000 square feet home
baa
His voice kinda reminds me of Aaron Carter
This home feels so desperately normal. My first guess would have been that whoever lives there must be really boring.
I like the house and the car at the end.
Dude has that feminine thing going on not to mention he’s a big simp with women if you have any discernment you can tell it’s written all over him and not in ink 🤦🏽‍♂️😖
Her voice goes through me like a rancid curry…
Kourt está pareciendose cada vez más a su mamá, y la voz de Travis es realmente relajante.
I wonder why they named one of their kids Alabama? That’s my birth State
My brain is fooled and I just can't seem to believe that he really isthis soft and calm person😂
Such a cool.guy.
********************TRAVIS IM YOUR SINGER*************                   ***CATER***
He looks like a zombie
I love how he is so proud of the things that Kourtney s kids do for him or have done; AND EVERYONE IS SO INCLUSIVE AS FAR AS FAMILY AND NO ONE CHILD IS "NOT INCLUDED"!!!! HE RAISED ATIANA AS HIS OWN SINCE SHE WAS A TODDLER...SO that's his daughter ALL Day
He looks like he was dipped in a morphine bottle he looks so pale and sick what does she see in him! Ugly!
the best.
The gold DIOR bike story cracks me up, they live in another world... But he seems really nice and down to earth, that's cool!
Wtf is he wearing
I have been a huge lover of Blink 182 and for a while now MGK, and as an Architecture Student this video just makes me so happy.
love his energy, seems very authentic and genuine
we as people are very strange
Anybody else see that name of the candle beside his bed?  LMAOOOOOOO!!!!     I'll save you the time to go back and see, The candle name is "SMELLS LIKE COURTNEYS ORGASM!"   I bet it smells delicious.... the candle too!
i need a link for his matress
This guy is definitely a homosexual
love Travis but wtf is he wearing ?
He sound sane than Scott disick
Is he gay? And I do not mean that in a bad way cause there is nothing wrong with that. I just find him to be very feminine and the way he talks to kourtney is......and vegan food? Omg please.
Kourtney and her new favorite color, black... I wonder why.
This is just sad. They’ll be divorced in a few years.
The essence is not the things you have or the house, the essence is the wife and children in their warmth and love that is priceless and true genuine love will not even have
Age and experience changes everyone. Yeah he was a very different person in his 20s than he is in this 40s. Granted... there are a lot of people in these comments who obviously haven't grown. Lol
I like that the house is luxurious, yet seems authentic and "livable" nothing over the top
Love it
very bland lad
I have a dream that all celebrities pool their excess $$$$ and save the starving and sick. I know I'm a dreamer but surely Travis doesn't need all those cars and a gold Dior bmx. I don't think he'd miss it much anyway. He has a wonderful family and a great way of expressing himself through music. Makes me feel sick when these wars are happening and the civilians are left with nothing, but everything is OK cause some celebrity got their house remodeled. I'm not just picking on Travis but there are so many of these wealthy people who could make such amazing change to hundreds if not thousands of peoples lives.
so many fireplaces.
HE LOOKS LIKE A DEMON THAT'S HER HOUSE RIGHT?
Average drummer living wealthy life.
Not a punker anymore.What happen to this dude?these Kardashians always change men,any1,ever notice that
His perfect for Kort xXx
he talks about toxins in a mattres but doesn't mind ink toxins in his body from all these tattoos 🤔
What a simply peaceful, considerate,genuine & humble man.  He is super chill,calm, cool & collected...new fan here...🙂
How do you live like that, so that you can't tell by the house that people live there. No pictures on the walls, no belongings, no dirty fireplace...
I cant get over how much what he is wearing looks like a body bag
"I like real clean space" Has a kardashian and tats all over himself. Lol opposite of clean space
that is a great title for a punk record... "I interviewed several designers"
Travis is cool, but His House Looks Like every Others celebrity Home. I would Not live there
Definitely a good match for Kourtney. Family-oriented, not obnoxious, sense over money or trend. They're aspirable and successfully their own person. Love them
If you get a mediocre artist, be in charge. If you know the artist is great, let them do their thing for you
Woah, spent his millions well
❤🤩
awesome
And eat delicious "vegan food" ..ok? Want cookie?
Solo dire q las kardashian si saben escoger a sus minitas de oro , son lo q en estados unidos se les dice gold digers.
He looks so asocial.
Like Travis but the dude is going to fall apart when his “fiancée” leaves him.
Why are some pictures hidden in the video? I mean they are hidden by the AD team for purpose. I saw it in many videos but still don’t have an idea why, could somebody explain?
Why is Travis wearing a gimp suit?
His house and demeanour totally does not reflect his insane amount of tattoos and overall appearance. What is going on here? 😅  Never judge the book by its cover.
Travis is a supercool and respectable gentleman + father to all his children. Much love and respect!
What the fuk is macha?
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿
This video is so impressing, because he is such an impressing person, awesome🤩
Such a sexy couple. Young and wealthy.
Beautiful 😍 😘 house
Is Kourtney partly Asian?
I hope its not turned in to a Kardashian style house dat they all seem to hav, his home has a lot of memory xxstay true Trav
Dressed like Pin Head and talking about heating up Tea.
This guy is very creepy
Great drummer, still a tool.
Yup. Operation Ivy on Lookout. Kids today don't even know.
I love that he says his house is under 10,000 square feet as if it’s small
He's sutch a nice kind person always a good father he's just a nice kind mellow person  him and his pretty wife will be very happy
Wow!!
Nice that he has a modest home.
This is exactly what I would’ve expected if this were a parody of a celebrity doing this. Imagine Andy Samberg lol
Satan
He’s so calm and I love his energy and his home definitely reflects that.
no wonder kourtney so in love with travis ..he suchs a sweet guy and romantic..soft spoken
Kardashians are witches that means children are abused. These people are sick stop idolizing them!
zooming in on the Digital synth while saying he has a Juno got me.
Ruined by a kardashian haha
She’s my favorite K… nice to see these 2 together
drive it TRAVIS your rich enough and YOU ONLY live once...so why die and give it to someone else to drive or make more money you will never get and spend either!!
That is the most boring and dull looking mansion inside. What a let down. Looks like an Ikea display room.
Travis ????
What's wrong with his NECK?...... oh my
Seems like a really nice guy 💙
Fantastically nice dude, and an absolute demon on the kit. A Kardashian finally got it right!
when he said, when Kourtney is working... Where? I thought she didn't want to work. It wasn't her "thing"
He’s way too cool for Kourtney lol
Well after watching this and hearing Travis speak, I really want him to do a song with Perry Farrel now.
14:03 to bad she’ll take it back during the divorce.. 😢
Travis likes style but he's also realistic and grounded.  His style clean and simple.
Madonna or carillo
Sell
Lol people try so hard
Pretty soon he'll only have half of all his nice things that he work hard for
Dude's a G, wow. No wonder he made it.
Why does he look like Dr Evil with that outfit?
Nice prison suit
Machine Gun Kelly
Blink 182 is one of the worst bands Ever but obviously made this freak some big money
Nice jumpsuit dude. Assuming the mrs told him it looks good and 😂😂😂
This house is actually warm. I really like it. I thought it was going to be another concrete box. Designer well done!
This dude is BONKERS.
Konb
“I’m a vegan… hi, my name is Travis Barker.”  “I am a vegan first, drummer second”  “Did I mention vegan? Ah yes, that is me.”
Not just food… vegan food.
A lot of people judge him on his looks ect but he seems a decent bloke 👍
awesome cars too
Wow. Machine gun Kelly really hit the wall
I’m minimal.  Also has 10 cars.  A fun drinking game would be to drink every time he says “like”
Of course Kourtney needs to be on the laptop 💻 🙄
Enough of the PDA    if they put as much energy into the PDA as  she might be knocked up already without the IVF OR IUI treatments !!!   The constant PDA is strangely reminiscent of Liza Minnelli & David Gest.....
How can you possibly care what this moron or Courtney has to say. Hate this country
Awesome house and awesome man , it's not hard to figure out why kourtney gravitated to him.
So pretentious it makes me want to hurl 🤢
T-Kash
TRAVIS is getting so old looking and to skinny.
Who cares he's probably tired of it. Doesn't even get to spend much time there.
"Cribs" is back!
Delicious vegan food 👎
This dude is totally fake 16 yeas lol... just few months ago he had a video looking to buy this house...
I feel ya on the less is more on the people in the house lol less is great
I thought Pauly Shore lost weight and shaved his head
What the hell you wearing bro?
Generic McMansion.
I love to hear that these places are functional and lived in instead of being a show piece , He is doing it right.
That dude looks like disco garbage man
Such a kool guy. Earthly. Dope crib
The amount of times he says "love"
Why on God's green earth are we hyping these people up?? 😑
This dude got so soft over the years. These Kardashians really ruining people. Look at MGK, aka the biggest sellout of all time. Gangster rap reppin cleveland to wearing pink and being 🌈. Insane what 2022 is like, imagine 5-10 years from now🤡
Mr. Kardashian getting his affairs in order after the plane crash would of been better if he went out like Lynard
He unironically speaks like Chad and J.T.
Beutiful house Mr. Travis, happy holidays
Sigh .....🤷‍♂️.  I prefer his house from MTV Cribs lol
Basically a girl’s house 😏
After watching this I have a new found respect for this guy, always thought he looked and acted like a D head, but yeah that's changed...
Bark bark woof woof.
Love the home. Kourtney looks so natural sitting with her laptop lol. with all the comfy  chairs every where she sits on the counter lol. They really make a cute couple.
WTF is he wearing??!!  🤣🤣
THose clown shoes tho
He actually seems to have great taste … not like 98% of the other celebrities
Word up. 👼🏽💯🌊
I'm 65 and I have been to many concerts throughout the years. I saw Blink 182 in Houston. It was the most disappointing, disrespectful concert I had ever been to.
what is courtney doing with that laptop?
Lmfao you are queer!
I love travis barker... But he dresses  like a FUNERAL DIRECTOR  FROM THE FUTURE...🤣🤣🤣
This dude is whipped
Is this a comedy skit? Truly one of the most surreal things I’ve ever seen.
He’s a damn crack head
He should stay away from the Kardashians. They are blood sucking leaches.
what a nice person and a lovely home.  I honestly didn't realise he was such a cool guy.
Those aren’t bikes as you say.. Haro master  mate
Wow, so punk rock
Maybe they just fixed up the house for this video because it looks so dull and plain, every room he goes in I just feel sad that they don't do anything with it... It just looks "ultra blah" dead, boring, I don't think I'd want to go into that home but I think Travis is a really really cool guy ⭐ ultra talented.... •••My brother's been a professional drummer his whole life He got his first drum set when he was just a little kid.
This guy made a mockery of punk
pretentious why does she need to sit on the kitchen counter like a teenager?
Should have bought some clothes instead of spending all that money on a house , that plastic bag he got on must get hot !!
I love the way he talks about Kourtney
Seems weird to me Travis is speaking in straight 16 minutes.
Meh....dumb
if its a kardashian you have pretty much zero credit. zero.
you gotta pluck the eye brows too. otherwise you just look like a hillbilly.
I’m a car girl and I’m in LOVE with your collection!
cringe
ugh, I love this guy
I wish them the best... He's a cutie 🥰
Wtf is he wearing
Awwww this was rad. I'm glad it was about Travis and not focused on his wife but definitely introduced his fam. This was really cool to see
13:45 I remember when I grew up too lol😂😂😂
Stink 182
BAHAHAHAHA what a pansy
po o cara ficou milionario e famoso por causa do blink 182 e não tem nada na casa dele sobre isso !
Wait so all I have to do is set up a kitchen matcha station and a leggy Kardashian will just start hanging out in there?
Matcha station is very cool.  Ping pong is so much fun… addicting for whatever available moment.  I swear… you are my male version doppelgänger…. even my passion to play percussion and guitars.  Aquarius?  Your taste is dope!
The designer did a phenomenal job!  Love the huge spaces!!
Dont share..if you're not willing to take it
Sir..ur are too much ..I guess our real people can't relate..all feels planned..edited..what do I know..??? In in Canada
My absolute dream to have a life like this 🥺
Where the crack at TRAAAAAAVVVVIIISSS??????
Looks like a museum. Nobody lives in that house
Travis and Kourtney - You are gorgeous; My only concern is your association with Marilyn Manson who is well known for being abusive towards women.
Having a gnx says all i need to know about travis. A man of taste.
A celebrity house that you can actually live in and you can tell they actually live in
He's so considerate.
Noticed how he says " WE " from line 1 ? In his house ?
Kourtney likes interior design. They have a common ground.
He's the textbook introvert with top taste.
Travis is a surprise. Almost too good for her. He survived a plane crash with DJ AM ( rip ). Good soul.
Love it
Lucky man  can live 9 lives
Travis was my idol as a teenager. I loved his cars tattoos and personality. Now im 33 he still blows my mind how cool he is and his just the chillest guy to live. looks cool af as always. keep it real brother! one day ill import a 1970 cadillac and cruise around like you did 10years ago
Nice ❤❤❤
Obviously being groomed  SHAME
Very nice !! It looks like a home not a museum Didn't he do MTV cribs !?? Have always liked Travis  But Kourtney! How many millions between them and she can't put pants on?  Meh guess more power to her
Blink182 FTW + G*d bless you for surviving the plane crash = saw you live at shoreline amphitheater when Blink182 reunited after the accident. You deserve the good life brUh.
makes sense someone with such perfect timing would have a minimalist and clean looking house
Happy for you guys!!!!!
He is on some serious pills . Xanax and pain pills maybe
He's dressed like he's about to chop someone into 6 pieces
What a great guy! Would love to see it in person being someone who loves a lot of the same!
Everything looks like it’s from IKEA
❤
this is the epitome of a scorpio man
Hey what are the 5 albums? Only saw The Wall
I honestly love Travis and kourt
I really love Travis for being such a great father, step-father and human being. Wish him and his family all the best for the future and many more happy times in their beautiful home
Wow very beautiful 🙏
imagine thinking your not completely gay but you are.
Ah that was awesome. Such an articulate guy. So chilled with a great vibe. I adore the love he has for the house and his family.
Absolutely beautiful you guys stay happy
I loved the tour except for the random Kardashian on the counter lol. Idk y I just can't stand any of them!!!!
IS he gay ? Did he turn gay
That's why Kortney & Travis are MARRIED, because they're VERY DOWN TO EARTH & LOVE TO CONNECT with their KIDS during their times off.  :)
he has a house with no soul like his empty looking eyes .. i cant belive what one of the best drummer turn into ..
He’s so cool and has an amazing home
C'est plate
Anyone else catch what the nightstand candle said? 🤣
The K's are indeed everywhere!!!
His inner vibe is completely different from his outer vibe! Surprising.  He has great taste.
I remember watching one of his cribs on MTV. Fully party house.
PAEDOPHILES BALENCIAGA
I never heard of him until he hooked up with Kourtney. And he seems to appreciate the fame she brought him unlike Scott who abused it. Foolish Scott.
Ain't that something??!! As if Courtney doesn't already have a platform of her own, she has to pop up in or let herself be known, in his!! Them Kardashians are created by evil!! Vanity for sure!! I like Travis and his other wife with their 2 kiddos. More family oriented instead of a "look at me, I got money" story!! Poor Travis!!
He's so genuine and I love how he a kourts kids have their dining table spot. .
edi wow
Uuuuhhhh
hmmmm
What on earth or distant planet from a galaxy far far away is he wearing! Holy crap!!!!!!! Paired with a body suit of prison tats….. nice!  When with this crap rat anti “fashion” trend go away! Hey I want to look like both a prison inmate and a trash bag! Ok…. Here’s what ya need to do! Perfect!
The bmx bikes did it for me. The white one stands out 🤩
Girls are gold dugers
botox barker
Full house but I feel bad that you married Kourtney Kardashian cuz every guy that hooks up with a Kardashian their life is ruined so good luck to you I'm sure Courtney changed you a lot and not such a good way but whatever I was a big fan but now that you married a Kardashian not So Much Anymore!!!
I used to think he was this crazy partying man who never really ‘grew up’ so to speak. And hearing him talk about his memories he definitely had those years and I bet in his job he gets to have that oulet. But wow, am I amazed at how calm and zen he is. It now really makes sense to me why he and Kourtney are together actually and I can’t be happier for both of them.  This goes to show: never judge a book by it’s cover.  What a beautiful home btw. The memories with the kids make the home even more special
Saw Blink 182 at MSG back in 2002 - Travis is an artist and a thoughtful human being. Kourtney’s ex couldn’t hold a candle to Travis’s talent and peacefulness. So happy for them both!
Amazing home 🫶🏻
Mom n dad
Ive never been so wrong about someone
"...HELLO THERE!"
Like. Like. Like. Sounds like a airhead. Just like his fiance. FFS.
do y'all see that fiddle leaf fig tree?!?!?!?!?!?!
Damn Travis wear a Helmet when ridin your bike man, Always Stay Safe King!
Beautiful home and styling. I always love the clean minimalist look with lots of windows and big doors. This guy seems healthy and in tune with himself, seems to know what's truly important in life. I find it kinda odd he is in love with a Kardashian, but I don't know her and I guess I'm passing judgement by what I've seen of the family thru different forms of media. What matters most is that he is happy and she is good to him, I wish them the best and hope he never moves from his beautiful home where he has created so many fond memories with his children. Love the home and his style!
What does he see in her and that family
https://youtu.be/BVH5b6f3cSU  Frida Kahlo contemporary art 🌺💐🌼🌹🌻🌺
This dude has  to have mob ties or so.e connection to the government.. 😬
WTF is he wearing??
This is exactly my style. I love it.
Lost all respect for this when he got involved with this family...
He should focus on not saying the word like.
why is he dressed like Jp from grandmas boy????
Me watching this in my underwear eating pringles:  “What a lovely aesthetic.  I should look into doing something like this.”
how many people have done mtv cribs and architectural digest?
Comme il fait peur ce mec c'est abusé
He is a awesome musician 🧑‍🎤
No more words, he is absolutely a decent person than I thought.
Dying 🤍
I'am not jealous but modern Americans are most consuming and surrogate culture in the world and literally everything here looks dead without life in it like big-mac from Mac. For me it all looks like total plastic.
Legend travis
Dressed like he’s in the matrix
He went from hero to zero getting involved with chick.
This is definitely a Favorite. Elegant, modern, understated. Their Designer did a Fabulous job!!
no photo frame that includes atiana? if I was her id feel so left out
Dude seems like he has brain damage I swear
It’s very funny how celebrities seems like umpa lumpa in their giant houses
he's so tasteful and intentional
He is a wonderful human being. Period ❤
What’s with all the LIKES.? Homie like work on your likes!? Like right now!
Watching this straight after his MTV cribs edition from the early 00s really shows how much time has passed... where did his box of ketchup sachets go?
Travis such a legend as a drummer myself I remember when he hit the scene and to see how high he's elevated his skill is incredible by far 1 the best to ever play the drums glad to see he's happy and living his best life
travis is my type. kourtney won at life omg
Kourtney there are literally a million other places to sit and you choose the cold counter top  lol you’re trying to balance your laptop when there is a table with chairs right there 😂
awwwwwww, kakav secer od "pankera". Bas je simpa.....prava pichkica :)
Absolutely beautiful house, very contemporary and modren which oozes warmth and serenity 👌😍
Never judge a book by its cover. He speaks so calmly.
This is a long way from his MTV cribs episode in Norco. I liked early 2000’s Travis better.
good vibes from travis seems like a nice humble guy
Just hearing how he talked about his designer for his house speaks to his character and who he lets in his life. He’s intelligent, spiritual, and calm.
Calm and collected guy. Never judge a book by its cover.
Nice taste dude .. perfect!!!
He’s gay. Gay accent. He should just come out
Awesome badass everything the house etc and so beautiful familys Travis 1# !!
He is The Man.
He is ugly☠️
Hello Travis welcome to the Kardashian business / band / men collection
Damn, Travis is so chill, I had no idea. You’d never get that vibe just looking at him
Never judge a book by it's cover. I would have thought his house would look more Gothic. I love the style
Idk but sounds like they had a thing going on for years
Such a decent guy
So crazy that the punk rock tattooed crazy vibe he gave off 90s has evolved into this zen matcha vegan tranquil family man. Bravo to not letting Hollywood destroy you.
I bet he was told, growing up: " With all those tattoos you would have a hard time getting a job"
I had to stop and laugh when he said mattresses can be toxic, the guy covered in ink and hooked up with a Kardashian is  concerned about his mattress being toxic.   Thats hilarious.
Nice house
La vida es muy interesante muchas Bendiciones ayer hoy mañana y siempre.
Among the siblings.,Kourteney got the right man this time. Find a man tht loves kids ,not love woman/womanizing insteead
Such a great home and design. Suits Travis so well. I loved it. Understated and zen.
I am so happy for them 🥰
Wow the country is in the crapper and I'm watching a KK lifestyle.
Looks sterile
I would give my first born child to trade closets with Travis lol
looks so comfy nd neat I love it
crazy to think this dude survived a plane crash, big ups
4.04 is that kardasian ?
The house is ok and such but he just need to get one more tattoo
Dude what the €$#%  are you wearing ?  Ps. I like the Banksy above the BMX bikes. Oh yes and the cars ... awesome. I’d just live in the garage.
و V.
و كوير ما رأيك.
بالظبط زوج كورتني.
Como essa mulher teve a coragem de se casar com esse cara parece mas com um gibi cheio de tatuagem ela não tem medo dele fazer mal aos filhos dela ou à ela mesma ele não parece ser confiável  👀
Wow, this guy is amazing, calm soul, clean and down to earth. I now see wat Kourtney saw in him. They match each other really well. I like how he framed the picture his kid drew of him. I mean he screams family luv
Been a fan of him since Blink but dam... he really got weird. Trash bag suit, vegan mocha, organic mattress..... WTF!
I wish Travis and Kourtney the best genuinely a great couple
did he just say he proposed on the same day they hung out as more than friends for the first time? wtf
So cool that travis is all tatted up with sick tattoos and everything and he is just the most mellow guy ever
Because Jared Cameron from eclipse said so.  Look at Kim Jared Cameron s imprint abd see if it doesn't remind you of Kourtney.
I had a colonoscopy and two endoscopies due to me being exposed to fentanyl without my knowledge.  I am still having breathing problem s and random bouts of anemia but it's waning.  So stay strong Travis
I watched it til he said he eats vegan.
Travis is so calm and collected. It’s so nice to see how chill he is Kourtney truly deserves to be with someone like him
This was so boring, I expected so much more excitement from Travis. Kourtney has really made things bland.
This dude looks like MS-13 gangster
HEAVY SLITHERY SUIT THING !!
Can't believe how calm he speaks in contrast to how loud he plays the drums
So punk
How much Kourtney works??? She doesn't work! She's a mom!
The Kardashians love chasing men with money.
Awesome house but maybe eat a steak bro you look like a walking skeleton. Luckily you probably won’t need to get into a physical fight
This guy is satanic
mal décoré
Travis Barker looking like a prisoner from 2055
You  lake te basura verga
I never felt like I ever wanted to meet anyone famous,  but I wouldn’t mind sitting down and talking to him at length.  Seems very down to earth.  And she is just stunning.
Its hard to see anything about famous stars and straps in his closet. 😥😥
He is with a kartrashian...he'll be ruined soon enough
Only Travis can make wearing a trash bag look cool.
Must be nice to be rich....
You all really don't see this dude do you
The Kardashian curse will ruin him too
What on earth have the kardashians and MGK done to travis 😕😕
Is nobody going to comment on the name of the candle at 10:35?
His voice tone is so relaxing, I love it he could do some ASMR easily!
If you pass there :🔥🔥https://youtu.be/J7hXqqo0Q0I
I dig the drumstick photo over the fireplace! I need it!
Geezus Travis! What a pad broski! Straight up party pad. Where all in this home have you nailed Kourtney?! 😂 😂 😂
This guy went through so much suffering, you wouldn't know just by looking at this video.  I am glad he has found peace and that he has a place to chill when not touring.
He looks like an axe murderer
Black and white contrast everywhere, checkerboard tattoo, kid named Mason… ok we get it bro 😂
This is the difference between a home and a house
I love his home, very beautiful. His home has light color and feel, I would never have pictured him liking that.
THATS MY SONS BIRTHDAY
you can have this all too if you sell your soul to the devil lol
Just goes to show, you should never judge a book by it's cover. He seems like a truly lovely family orientated person. Although I found his house beautiful it was a wee bit boring but like he said he's not there much. The thing that made it special was how every member of his family is there, with all their memories. Who'd have thought.
anybody who has fake books on the shelf is as empty as the books
I'm sorry but that kitchen looks horrible
And you would think she would be fed up of cameras... :)
Waldo removed the wall 😂
Beautiful delicious vegan food huh? 🤢🤢🤮🤮
Why is he dressed like a bank robber:D
Soulless and bland
Excellent.
His so skinny i dont mean to be rude he needs to put on a little
I love his voice and energy very calm but focused and relaxed 😎
Hint: This isn't their real home.
I can see why Kourtney fell for this guy. He seems quite humble and totally chill.
I had this guy all wrong, actually listening to him he seem like a really nice human being 👍
looks like Ian MacKaye's house
she is just vomit
I love his house. It’s minimal and simplistic. One story but roomy. I don’t care for huge two story or 3 story homes.
Great definition of don't judge a book by its cover.
Travis is one my favorite drummers but damn he needs a mohawk back or something. I hate that he put tattoos on his FACE and wtf is he wearing lately???!
“i don’t like when people put a ton of stuff everywhere. i like it minimal” i think it’s so funny he says this while covered head to toe in tats 😂😭
When did Travis turn into Hansel from Zoolander? (Not in appearance but just in terms of WTF).
Sick crib
This what environment cut at From jungle and put where and how you like it This what all Rich people dose because they have lots of bloody money
I wish you would show people that are actual role model's that had to work to get what they have. Not people that got their money by stumping all over everybody else. I guess Travis Did work hard, but his wife over there..
He’s like 28 yr
I have always had huge respect for Travis Barker but after watching this and hearing how he loves to spend time with his family makes me respect him even more
Don’t judge a book by the cover as they say
I've seen Travis so many times performing at The Palms Casino whether with Blink-182 or by himself. He's such a gentle and humble guy.
is he dying of something? Dude looks sickly af
Oh my God he is so gross.  What's that garbage bag fashion?  These plastic but nice looking women with these thug inmate gross guys.  What's the agenda?  Will he be made insane like all the other Kardashian men?  Dirt bikes in the house, so classy!  The mindless idiots look up to you so much!
waalaikum salam, kene-kene mlebu kene
is that MTV cribs? oh the memories
🙃I have a feeling, it wasn’t just matcha in the mug🤪
What are the albums that changed his life
I, me, mine... Trash Boy.
nice!
Now we know why the blink tickets are so darn expensive
travis was adam levine's brother? cause they lookalike
He’s so calm when he’s not behind his kit. So unreal
For such a rich rock star he had a perfect car collection. Wasn't overdone or too much, a lot of class. Definitely love the house!
Love how humble Travis has always been.  You can tell his Fontana roots never left him.  Huge respect for this guy.
Weird how this got recommended to me on October 17th!
Travis is too good for any Kardashian, even Kourtney, by far the best one of them all, bro! what were ya thinkin'?!
You definitely can't just a book by it's cover. He's a great person, father, husband, friend...
What the fok is he wearing? Some fetish overall? Rubber? If that is haute couture, what a joke. It sure ain't punk...what he never was anyhow. Boring interior too.
Dude needs some vitamin D
ADD looks good on him
this the most i’ve heard him talk lmao
What in the goofy is he wearing and boy do those Kardashian hookers get around
He is mentally and physically so damn fine 😍
Save the animals please
Most normal celebrity house I've ever seen.
Tough seeing Travis become this LA/Hollywood rockstar, but whatever man. Do you
Waldo Fernandez business contact please
Travis is definitely my favorite drummer and one of the kindest and at the same time coolest human beings.
Travis is a goofy looking dude.
DAYUUUM!
Beautiful home.
Marrying a kardashian is bad news. Nothing good will come out of it
Considering I have the same 60" Wolf range and built in Miele coffee maker, I must have good taste.
I love Blink, +44,BCR but this is just embarrassing his daughter is basically a perfect representation of future Bimbo and unfortunately split roast material for some folks but what can you expect when your step mother is the dirtiest hoe on planet earth, I would not touch that with a stick 🤢🤮
nice guy. understated and stylish home!
Who watches pish like this.....
Pure Radical Artist, dinner guests, millions of dollars of Art, lovely freezer, nice realter commentary = Rock and Ro!!
wow! very impressed with his speaking skills, and not because i expected them to be bad.  refreshing
Isn’t money. Great thing?  Can even out this into a nice light.
Who is Travis Barker?
🤣
He must not have many punks over.
it is obvious that nothing in this house is him. 😂
Jesus Christ, he looks like a zombie, get this boy some MEAT!
Definitely hot the bes/hottest  kardashian
He seems so 😊 ♥️
he seems like a really sweet guy
Im surprised the ping pong balls arent white
I’m so bi
He speaks like Walter Jr
I love Travis man,stoked to see the guys back together on another note.
What a gentle soul!! Never judge a book by its cover!!
1 word: Calming
Seems like a decent person. Anyone that cares about his family that much is ok by me. Can’t stand the tattoos but it’s his business. ✌🏻🌹🇺🇸
You look like a prisoner
Given what this man has endured - surviving a horrific plane crash that took the lives of several of his closest friends and being burned over 60% of his body (and understandably not being psychologically able to fly for 13 years) - it's awesome to see him healthy, happy, emanating such a peaceful vibe inside of a gorgeous home surrounded by creativity and those he loves. Beautiful to see another human being go through literal mental and physical hell and yet endure to shine with so much peace, love and humble gratitude/appreciation for Life.
These people are hysterical..they look like the walking dead 🤦‍♀️
Travis has a gentle spirit about him. very nice.
Mr Travis your going to find yourself in the same state of delusion as Scott 10 years from now the only difference is that you're a musician who's a multi-millionaire so once Kourtney divorces you and takes all of your assets you will be in the same boat as Scott the only reason why Kourtney didn't marry Scott is because he wasn't as rich and successful as you are
Rich people act like they accomplished something when they buy things.
Who dis???
Nice!
Nice.
this dude is living the best life he is literally dating Kourtney kardashian
Wow this is super dope 😮
A very beautiful home! It’s good to see Kourtney so happy! ☺️☀️
wtf is he wearing.. dude wtf
"i make the best matcha;..LOL what a wierdo
Love it!! Very scandinavian😍👍🏻✨
when he showed "his room" its sounds to me that they dont sleep in the same bed? did i get it wrong?
I love it!
Why is he wearing rubber clothing?
Life isn't fair
Hes such a creepy old weirdo.
Travis is a calming presence. He and Kourtney deserve each other. Much love
Can we talk about that G-wagon for a second! They need to bring that style back I love it Travis seems like a down to you earth genuine guy, I’m glad AD put him on here.
Kourtney and Travis are so fun! I love watching them! They both have style!
i love how he has a candle that says “this smells like kourtney’s orgasm” 😭
bonito vive tipico de calabasas tranquilidad..
I love how travis made a name for himself before Kourtney so they can't say they made him, unlike scott
wow I judged prematurely. He's actually a nice guy, and very humble.
WTF are you wearing dude? I feel like I am having a DEVO flashback....
Love him & kourt as a couple. Just so cute.
I love how he looks like he's still in Blink-182
Lovely calm and peaceful home
Travis has a beautiful soul
Just move out of California end of story because your wife wears the pants of the family. Learn to actually make a fire. Ok all your cars are suvs?
He seems to be love bombing Kourtney.
Perfection is what defines this house.❤❤
'I like to live minimally...here are my 8 cars'
I thought he was Jeremy Scott for a second
He’s so sweet and calming. I know nothing about him and have never watched an interview of his. So happy for them.
Very Punk...
Whoopie Jackie Poooie
He sucks her toes alot I do it with my women and they absolutely love it
Why is he wearing contractors trash back ?!?😂😂🤣
I was wonfering why she fell for you now i know
Yeah loved the zen minimilast good taste
I would like to have one luke that
The zen vibe fd9nt teflect his thousand tattos cudos nice taste
Vegan? What this guy do drummer
His life is mainly centered around family time.   This is beautiful to watch.
Wow impressive.
I love his personality. He seems so sweet and family oriented!❤
Congrats  to them both, she deserved a good match. She looks so happy with him. Good for both of them!
STOP paying attention to the Kardashians and they will go away
I love how much he loves her
imagine seeing this guy naked..lol
Don't ask me how, but you can just tell that he gives amaaaaazing sex 😉
I hope their love last forever. You can tell they are in the new stages of love. Unfortunately, that wears off quick. Enjoy it while you can
What a fukin beige dull miserable looking house
That Kardashian’s changed him. Mind he was a punk rocker. Now he’s a bampot prancing about in a rubber boiler suit 🤨
Thumbs up
What a men !  I love your personality Travis !!!❤
I have see a lot of star’s houses , but I think this is the beautiful house
Really suprised that i wasnt expect such a lovely person in that tattoes body , i dont really like tattoes, he is so amazing calm and the way he talk such kind and warm
What the hell is he wearing?
When you realize you have the same kettle as Travis lol
SO FAKE
Man, Travis Barker has aged really well.  He doesn't look half as old as I would've expected. I'm just really glad he hasn't gone absolutely batshit insane like some other Blink members...  **cough** Tom **cough**
Dude sounds exactly like Courtney...  yiiiikes!!
NICE MANSION
How set up is kourtney half naked in the counter ... i think the house is great kourtneys half naked appearence is kinda desperate attention seeking antics ..
Yuppie/punk = yunk
I like Travis. But celebrities just can’t get over themselves.
I'm a car guy  Then picks some of the worst cars ever made in the fleet.
The rich people they have everything.
Of course the sextapeashian hag needs to sit in the background performatively
The devil worshipers
probably my favorite celeb house ive seen on here
13:45 he's so soft :(
12:54 SO CUTE :(
omg...its giving 90's mtv cribs vibe! loved this... so love Travis now
It’s crazy how him and kourt was neighbors now they are married
Why didn’t he show Landon and Alabamas room?
omg whoa 16 years??
Nauseating
I guess Kourtney is the only one in the Kardashian family who doesn’t want to try a black guy 😄
Hes dressed like he about to go to vampire nightclub or like a gay sons of anarchy themed nightclub
Absolutely beautiful home and so refreshing to see it has been lived in and enjoyed.
I was never thinking that Travis is a family oriented person, but by watching this video, I realized that I was wrong. Travis talks about family and children and fiancé which makes this video so much more interesting to watch. Good for you guys. To Kortney: ( mishd Lav gyank)
Why dress like a lunatic?
TB is just a pouting ponce, who also plays the drums reasonably well.
For just a second though, did anyone think… CRIBS?!
Does anyone knows whats the style of the house called?
He looks like VOLDEMORD
I love him so even more now. I was feeling so tense before watching this. Now I’m somewhat relaxed. Thanks man
If he wasn't rich said Mr. Gardner.
He is so cute, and the way he rubbed her leg so sweet
That candle though, must be one of Gwyneth Paltrow's
Love to see a celebrity not have a house with 15 bedrooms for no reason. This looks like a home.
Where are the two of them going to live? Did Kourtney move into his house?
Why does he stand like that?
It’s the cullinan for me😍
Nice pad. But keep your disgusting PDA inside behind closed doors. Nobody wants or needs to see that sh!t. Respect your kids. Trust me when I say they don’t wanna see that either.
Ooohh he proposed on my birthday that’s cool. I love the minimalist layout. I hope to have something similar cuz growing up we never had space barely somewhere to put your cup down. It looks so freeing
Travis looks like a Matrix character.
I really like this dude, but MGK really blows and it’s really bad Blink 182. I know MGK is making millions and so is Cardi B !
It is a very nice house. But how nice are their souls? Travis, pray God for your wife and children, pray and pray, cause I see a lot of proud there😒 your souls are worther than all the treasures of this world.
No wonder hes so miserable and lifeless now ....  he's with a Kardashian 😂
he looks very manly but from this video i can see that he is quite a soft person. Love the kitchen!
Hes so chill
His voice is very calming
Kourtney always gives sentimental gifts I loveee that!!!!💗
All these house videos of the rich and famous and yet not one house ever looks lived in! They all look staged. I'd rather see how famous people live day to day
Love it 😍 the vibe is so calm 🤍
I remember having serious society anxiety & had exams and the same morning, I looked at this video & it was so calm, I felt a sense of peace with the positivity of the way he spoke & the way this video was portrayed.
This is guy is very likeable he's chill as and down to earth 🌎   Prefer my music heavier mind u
I love his vibe!! Makes sense why he and Kourtney worked out ❤️ so sweet and humble! Thanks for the tour !!
Funny to think that Travis used to be punk!! 🤣😂🤮
Thank you 4 sharing
they really make me believe ..than i wake up
i fall in love with this man,,, he is so sweet
I’m so happy for you and Kourtney. May your love last forever ❤
Nothing special, quite sterile
The fancy version of mtv cribs 😄
This house reminding me how poor I'm 😭😭 it also reminds me on how to put More struggle to the hustle
I see now what Kourtney sees in him!
Congratulations to both of you Love you,
He‘s a calm person seems to be a verry nice guy ,opposite of her ex,
DID ANYBODY SEE THAT PILLOW MOVE?!?!?! 10:55
Minimalist? Come on, So many objects, rooms, cars. The fact that s it s a clean and  sleek house has nothing to do with minimalism. Minimalism means FEW things that you own, nothing to do with the design but with mathematics
He has a nice Health warm colors it does make you feel comfortable I don't know what it is not just with the Kardashian some other people wear everything is white I can't handle it I need some warm thing warm decorations
So much comfy Furniere and she is Wittings in the countertop. Ok…
It would be so cool if you and Kourtney spoke more about your friendship days/years. You two are so perfect together. I feel Kourtney found herself / embraced who she is with you.
Beautiful home!
Sometimes I forget he even knows Mark/Tom lmao I think he forgets too!
Geek
I love how theres a random :30 of soft core pourn real quick. lol
Kourtney works???lol😂
I thought his voice would be a bit energetic but he sounds so calm and chill like it makes me insane
He reminds me of Pauly Shore
y te veras bonito vaya pintas tiene, ni a la altura de tu mujer estas madre mia personaje
This house resembles Kim's house
Beautiful! Home 🏡
these people are ridiculous
Ngl, I was expecting to see pits of lava and other things that people who have sold their soul to Satan might have around the house.
They should do these interviews later on in the day so these people have time to take a shower, brush their teeth, and get dressed in their regular clothes.
Love the kourtneys orgasm candle right by his mothers rosary.. wholesome lol
The Designer or Architect did a Fantastic job with the renovation. I love everything about the house especially the kitchen and the combined indoor and outdoor living is amazing. Love the car collection
Oh blah blah overpaid look at how rich I am what I have (fart noise inserted )as we step over all the homeless outside
I love that there's a candle that says "this smells like kourtney's orgasm"
What the heck happened to the old Barker.... this new PVC latex onesie and Kardashian toxicity is over the top. Ffs. Go back to your roots homie. Stop tryna live a Kardashian life full of falsities and lies. You didn't want a remodel. Kourtney did. You're whipped. Whipped and bent over her lap like a little dog. Wtf bro
He gives me this vibe that he’s low key gay
Why are you here? Why are you alive?. https://youtu.be/EdCO0BmG6hA
You mean her home
I agree about guest! Some of it is mainly because I'm an introvert, but my house is my oasis. I don't like a lot of guest...if any at all. I have to mentally prepare 🤣
aethetically pretty much mainstream mixed with bad taste. K. Kris Jenner knows how to place her babies
Wtf is he wearing?
Can we say FAKE!!!!   Good chance when he says “babe” he is talking to his BF🤣😂
The house is so calming and beautiful ❤️
Kourtney Just trying to casually work in the computer is giving me vibes kkk
His voice is so relaxing
Damn this dude seems so chill. Would defintely love to kick back a night and drink some beers and just talk,
Travis seems very chill. Although, his home doesn't match his wardrobe look. Peculiar lol.
He's become such a dork
Damn the house that Blink 182 built.
Damn the house that Blink 182 built.
Love Travis Barker since his Blink 182 days glad to see him happy he's been through a lot. Cool to know he's Vegan
what's up with all the blurred art
Did he propose on the first date or did I miss hear that?
10:55 i thought the pillow just moved on its own ahahah
Travis is like the guy version of kourtney😩😩goals ps personality wise
🙋‍♂🚘
Why is the art sladded
He should do audio stuff like audio books and stuff he has such a soothing voice I could listen to him all day. Is that weird
Check out our restoration if you see this ❤️ https://youtu.be/kn576NG0xQw
Wow hes has very nice personality! Kourtney is cool as well  Xxx keep it guys
Wow 🤩
regards from Indonesia 🤘💀🤘
I love this guy, hun and kourt make me gush 🥹 he’s such a family man they gone feels very homey and how he describe each things aw
Wow. What a great tour of his home and sneak peak of who he is.
Even the Kardashians know they out there picking up the doofiest of dudes. "That movie with the huge X in it?" 😬 "OMG!"
I could work til  4 or 5 am in the morning, and everyone would...be asleep. Look out Prince.
This is a ping pong table...I like ping pong. I googled it. This came up.
Dude can't have any character around him or it isn't easy to live.....
I knew a lot of "Thinking" artists in Seattle. Society called them junkies, and hobos. If they only knew that there was a chance one in a million could plug into some money if they were to just promote photos of themselves by pretending to play to countless different versions of one over-processed song.
"Allows me to think. And doesn't like...crowd my vibe." Alright people back it up, let this man work. Think it through Trav. The power thoughts that come out of this guy is money. Watch and learn.
Absolutely stunning. I love the calmness. I'm happy for Travis for his success.
I wasn’t expecting much from Travis but he really was interesting to listen too. Pretty cool dude, I can definitely see what kourtney sees in him. They seem like a cool pair.
His voice and presence even through the screen is so calming and comforting. He looks like a great father too! Him & Kourtney are definitely matched in energy they’re a very beautiful couple.
it's moc-ah not motch-ah.
Hey im having trouble reading the 2nd and 3rd album on the picture. I see Op Ivy! Dre and Floyd. I would like to do that myself! Pretty cool.
Noodle men hahahahaha. The K family will soon be judged and hard.
The fact he dedicates a space for matcha and other teas 😭❤️
Ummm organic mattress....the LA air and homeless people SB more of a concern to you.  I mean c'mon
What's the source of the interest in skull and bones?
Living room color scheme is way too cold for me.  Yet, that really tall vertical painting over the fireplace is EXTREMELY bold, it's perfect.  A lesser designer would not have thought to go vertical and fill that entire space in order to turn that entire vertical wall into a strong contrast and complement to the horizontal shelves on each side.  Knocking out that wall to give direct access to the pool is a great move too.
Loved the casual kourt sitted on kitchen bench, all glamed up in pj. Who wakes up looking like that and sit on  kitchen table drinking matcha! So fake!!🤣🤣🤣🤣
I was not expecting to have so much in common with him tastewise
Boring ZZZZzz….
Oh.  I thought he was married to that one Victoria’s Secret model.
Dressed like a weirdo.
I wasn’t sure why kourt was with him. After watching this I can see why she’s worth him. The house is stunning.
His voice 😌
my mom's a vegan and she has that same pasty white skin ...
Really a nice and humbled man.
How can a DRUMMER afford all this ? He's not even a real musician.
He used to be cool
Travis seems so nice and like a genuinely kind person. I’m glad Kourtney found someone who seems like he really loves her!
Isn't "mocha" pronounced a bit differently lol
He is one disturbing looking dude.
Looks like every kardashian home.
Kourtney I totally get why you fell so hard for him. Best wishes to you all in your Happily Ever After❤
lets be honest, we all came to see kourtney
The fk you wearing brother lol
kind of surprised we didn't see anything referencing blink 182.  regardless, hes a great artist in his own right.
Duuudddeee that grand freaking national is the sickestttttt….exquisite taste my man
i cant believe he is Vegan. comparing to his punk lifestyle
Why some of the artwork is blurred? 👁👁
Vi amerikanci se proseravate sa tim ogromnim kuhinjama,a niko nista ne zna da skuva
That's the worst fake fireplace I have ever seen. Sorry but that just really stood out to me.
Are you power washing the house with that outfit when you’re done with the tour
Officially my fav place ever.....until this - Adam Levin had the first spot - Travis has it now....I am so impressed with how real he is....I mean....kind, calming and real.
Idk I expected Travis to have an extremely deep voice, this is the first time I every hear him talk lol.
Beautiful? -yes, calming? - certainly, but minimalistic??? - ykhm
I love that his space looks like an actual home
He seems like a really nice guy 😊
happy soulmate😍😍😍😍
So soft spoken😃from the way he looks I though he would sound gruff or growly but WOW 😍😘💙💙💙
I'm so confused?... He said they have Christmas and Birthday gifts from years ago they spoil each other with but they started dating in 2021?  What?
Wow what cool bloke good on you
Doesn’t get much more punk then this.
These houses are so clean. Looks like no one lives there
like yeah bro
The only KS sister who go for white men ‼️🙂 hope that didn't came out racist ‼️
My God, he sounds like her was born and raised in the Kardashian clan. Same primitive yet pretentious language, same name dropping, same posing in everything he does...
They were getting each other gifts before hand. 😜
His house looks like an office building with conference meeting rooms and waiting rooms.
Awesome!
I remember building a house for movie producer Thomas Tull the next block over in my 20's. All my buddies and I were so excited that Travis was the next block over. I believe he or someone gave some guys from the site some stickers from his clothing brand one day.
Sell out !!!
Well this is an upgrade from his MTV cribz tour. He had just got famous like the week before and bought some art just for Cribz
Money is the root of all that is evil !!
A minimalist, a vegan, Zen, he is such a contradiction....his look does not match his lifestyle.
A guy who used to be cool.
Was he working on his car?
I’m honestly surprised I was expecting much different. Very beautiful home
Kardashians probably haven’t even heard of the transplants 🤦‍♂️ good luck Travis can’t imagine what ur knew sound will be like!!
Also a Dior bike wtf is this world coming to?????
Nothing more punk rock than dating a kardashian😂
These are good people
I love the irony when he is talking about being minimal? Dude literally has twenty tatoos on his head and face.😆
Kourtney got the best man out of her family.... don't get pressed kylie kim khlue fans..  Its just my opinion 😊
Cool trav!
Now this is what we call a Home..
The fact that bozos who contribute very little good to society can live in extravagant homes like this shows you how far America has fallen.
They say  If you got it flaunted. I think this is sickening for this man to flaunt his home and blongings on YouTube. So many people are living in cardboard boxes and he has to flaunt this
The kardashians and jenners are worthless
Do this segment with Littlemix members too..
Who the heck is this ? 😆
Now i can see why kortney loves him , he is such a caring man
Must be nice see kids follow your dreams and live in Cali but you better gross atleast 5 million a year
So basically the houses used to have no windows but walls lol
Travis has this calm energy which I think suits well with Kourtney.
He's not slow buy he's not boring he probably does need to retired. Needs rest 😴
The two things the house couldn't do without the 87 grand national and Kourtney
Odd couple but happy for them
staged....everything is staged...even  the  girlfriend  with the laptop sitting  on the  kitchens workbench...basicly  get a ton of money, buy the  most expensive designer furniture from high-end  brands...place 'em around the house and get to call yourself an interior  designer.
Ok, this was a total surprise! I never heard him speak before. He’s so tranquil and seems down-to-earth. Sounds like this is a real oasis for him and the family.
They met 5mins ago and now living together.
i don’t even know who is he but i was guessing he’s a scorpio bc he seems to be a sentimental person by the way he talks, and present each part of his house and i was right!!! 🤭 SCROPIO gang 🫶🏼
New drinking game: take a shot every time they say Matcha
Boring
Does he know the Colorado Avalanche use his song?
The funny thing about this guy is when he almost lost his life he cried to God and beging God to help him and now he showing inside of him house he as nothing that represents God only things that represents the dead but when you are in trouble you cried to God but when you get better you glorified the devil who wants to kill you. You see how foolish you are
I was believing the journey until he said “and how much Kourtney works” ….. yeah not sure lounging around picking through salads for the camera constitutes “work”.
I love that Travis says how he loves everything, he's so genuine 🥰
You can tell how gitty she is around him it’s so cute, she’s very in love and smitten over him. love works in mysterious ways.
Unreal
Uggly man.
Second time watching this video and wao wao wao what a guy ❤ he pays attention to everything, love how he knows where everyone sits at the dinner table ❤ this man pays attention which is rare for someone who is so super busy as he is. I also like that he doesn't like a lot of people in his house, that's me also. ❤
Homeboy is looking like his soul has been sucked out of his body.
love barker but this is a soulless interior with all the spark of a mortuary
it's amazing to see how relaxed kourtney is around him. im so happy for them and they have a beautiful home!
Scott Disick is wayyyy moreee handsome than travis
Yes a nice and gentle man blah blah He’s genuine.  That’s the real thing
This seems really staged and all I can keep thinking is like...  This guy isn't even that good a drummer, what vacuous crap.
Surprisingly very basic interior. His wardrobe had most of a character
easy on that Warp Stabilizer, friends. lol. ;)
Never judge a book by its cover. Never heard his music.. had I seen only his photo somewhere,  i probably woulnd hv guessed what a collective n classy guy he is. Loved the calm vibes and oh boy.. what a family man.
Apart from his interesting trinkets the design is really bland. Each to their own but hopefully didn't pay that designer too much
His voice and this house goes together quite nice
This smells like kourtney’s oragsm💀
I love him and his family! So nice family inside and out!!
Who wants to date this tattoo mistake
and his kids   shanna
i live with travis
kids and home
two
who men
Travis Barker , Where did you get the Matcha Station. Superb lookin’ life you got 🪷🪨
Good Lord what is this Bullion Fringe hair-don't wearing don't tell me POOP GUN HEINIE got him a discount at IMMATURE SISSY he's a junkie once a junkie always a junkie & a show off a drummer's job is keep the beat not look like you should be on the Coney Island Boardwalk luring customers into a viewing of the 2 headed baby in a jar you kids are the worst keep it up
Drinking this matcha that you made me ,,,"oooioooooohhhh lmfao drive er Courtney
Lane splitting in Arizona 🏜️ https://youtu.be/b9UH54BhI0E
they look so in love and im glad cause shes been thru alot
This house would benefit from a blazing fire or a huge explosion...serious, it looks like a Bauhaus museum, not like a place where real people live in. I like Travis and his music very much...but this house has only one piece in it, which I like...the wooden bench at the foot of the bed in the master bedroom. Even the garden looks sterile. But as long as they are happy with it, I guess my opinion doesn´t count that much 😗😄 I wish only the best for him and his family. It seems to me that they are great and loving people and that is most important. Chacun à son goût ♥
Every room is just the right living size. Xplosive! 😉❤❤❤🤜🏾💥🤛🏾
This living room is incredible!
Boring....
What a very kind and friendly man!! It’s so rare in these days to have somebody so famous with such a deep peaceful vibe! GOD BLESS HIM and his family!
Awesome house, Trav!!
So much for rock and roll, what a melt!
I love Travis Barker! He is so sweet, calm and gentle and really loves Kourtney! Happy for both of them! ❤️🙌🏼
he feels like prison mike but just never went out of character again.
wtf is he wearing????? I couldn't watch this train wreck....
seeing how some paintings (and sculptures?) are blurred makes me REALLY intrigued
He even talks like a kar dash now
Pure Punk Rock :*
wish i could visit, his place was dope.
Dang. This dude is boring even in his voice.
Seems like a dope dude
Very peculiar people. It’s not really a home is is? It’s a house full of objects.
He is an absolute sweetheart 😍😭
Thank you for sharing. As an older British woman I admit I don’t know who he is but I know some of kourtney as I’ve seen some of the family shows .I really like her and I’m extremely pleased to see how happy and glowing she is obviously being with him in this video .he seems like a lovely man and that reflects in his home it’s simple and beautiful and she’s reflecting back at him how he makes her feel..lovely to see.
God I can't stand what he's become with the Kardashians. Still an amazing drummer and I will appreciate his musical talent forever, but man this guy has become so much like MGK, just annoying.
I love how, despite having a mansion, his home is still so humble, warm, and homey. It's not crazy lavish full of ridiculous expensive things just to have it. It seems great for a family. I love it!!!  Edit: ok, after listening to him speak some more- this man is perfect for Kourtney!
"two thousand twenty one" that's a disciplined grounded man.
Perfect for a poodle!
He really likes his fireplaces.
Vegan king and queen 💙
Filming and editing of this video is not good
فیلمبرداری و تدوین این ویدیو خوب نیست
Your a joke
I’m just like WOWWW never expected this from him.  Good for you man you are a good Human , wonderful father n I’m sure your a great husband wishing you a happy life ❤️
The art work is absolutely phenomenal, love his beautiful home
like watching you soft spoken guy and humble one
This was so calming to watch.
Such a clown show. You don't even sound like you use to. This mutt will do anything to stay relevant.
Who is this guy?   Was he an original member of DEVO?
Travis gonna f9ght for that matcha
Outside he looks like a Lion, so at home he can really be the lamb he really is…
Was that a cat behind the pillow on his bed at 10:57 ? I'm curious
Who names a kid Alabama 😂
Why does this feel like a comedy sketch 😂 right when she's drinking he's all "i actually make the best matcha" I cried laughing I don't know why 3:45
The best thing in the house is Travis, coolest vibe.  🌼
I was not expecting him to be this calming. I love the energy of his home and his life there.
Oh he's vegan? I couldn't tell by his complexion and soy boy tone!
I wonder if he really reading  those books on the table?
i iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii me me me me me me me me me me me mine mine mine mine mine mine mine my my my my my my my.
Прекрасный дом
Nice gaff
Two no talented  doosh bags
i think the thing abt travis is he bought a house he adored made memories in it . remodeled it into something he loves and is prob gonna live in it forever
What a freak.
this house and this guy are so scary , where is  travis  from Enema of the state ?????  frack off us back Tom and Scott
I will probably get shot down in flames for my comments. I have no idea how I ended up watching this video (other than a love of interiors and nosing round other peoples houses) and i have no idea who Travis and his girlfriend are. Travis seems like a nice man - verdict is out on the girlfriend . What I find painful though is knowing how many people are living in complete poverty and  struggling to keep a roof over their heads and feed their children. Travis has either done something amazing or is very privileged!
Oof! To have the money to have a home created especially for you...what an amazing life. So envious 😩
He’s gold! Sheer Zen!
That looks like a ikea prison
I wonder what Toms house looks like now lol
He’s a fashion accessorie
Travis is such a cool dude. He seems so gentle and kind.
I Love your and Courtney's love srory! I believe you two really found your soulmate in each other. ✌❤👣
Is it just me that saw that candle umm-
Love the home, don't like your outfit <3
I dont know Travis at all except from dating Kourtney K. But after watching this tour, my opinion of Travis seems grounded, articulate, calm, serene, grown up, mature. I dont know how old he is either, however,  seems very mature.
My brain is trying to convince me that this is a voiceover of Travis... 🫠
You can tell they've lived in that house. The chairs and cushions  look like they've lived and aged in a good way. It's a home it's suppose to have love and history. Other people's houses don't feel like they were lived in.
10 : 28 i..
Does anyone know what the 5 albums are on his artwork?
Kourtney always knew what was essential for herself and her children.  Her strong resistance to  frivolous fame didn’t make her popular, but she didn’t cave. That’s admirable.  She and Travis developed their friendship and came to be melded souls.  This marriage is going to survive.
10:29
sweet man ♥️
Hmmm 🤔 there are so many things that resembles Kendall Jenner and Devin Booker’s house. Vase pingpong-table bedroom-setting teapot-area pot-filler longtable-rattan-chair. Is khloe jealous of Kendall?…
Something weird about celebrity homes why are some of the paints blurred out.
Love the interiors!
Kourtney definitely had this made to show courts this man aint a bad man🤣🤣🤣and filtered all these comments of him being a family man😭😭😭what money does omg
when youre so rich that you get bored of affording anythinf so you are just amazed by boring plain furniture
Such a beautiful home, very peaceful setting!
Didn't expect to like Travis, he's a cool and chill dude.
What's he done tho he looks offit
C husband nasobrahan sa poraga bes
I’m Happy for Travis & Kourtney 🥰He seems like a pretty laid back katt ✊🏾
Oh Kourtney,  keep him please. Because he's a keeper and a romantic and  loyal type of guy. I think you need his calming presence.  Oh, and nice house. 👌
12:56 such a beautiful laugh! Like playful, childish and cute🥺
I love this so much. A very modest but super fashionable home. This look is easy to imitate.
You good?
Linda  linda l love Brasil!
The tree in the living room is cool
Absolutely love this house and Travis’ personality but I wonder what parts of the house have a touch of Kourtey? It feels very his
This is the new MTV Cribs but with a classier spin lol love it
😮
Nice setup 'BUT' nothing better than his 1987 BUICK GNX .  Courtney knows hows to give a gift.
Very nice
his appearance 😈 but his voice and attitude 😇😇
Kourtney works?
Kourtney has good choice though in men..
Posers
WASN’T EXCEPTING HE VOICE TO SOUND LIKE THIS, ITS CALMING
Beautiful home, this is the first time I've heard Travis speak, he seems like a lovely guy.  Love how family seems so important to him.  I think that Kourtney and Travis make a lovely couple.  May they have long, healthy and happy years ahead of them.
Courtney seems so happy now
Beautiful 🤩
All I kept thinking did the wife dress him like that or was it him..lol
Just terrible how boring and unpersonal it looks. Why can't famous people do some decorating on their own instead of having a designer that makes your house look like standart exhibition home? I mean look at this home cinema 😂 I always thought this dude is a different.
Sweet suit bro
Ugh vegan
Love this home. I've never noticed how pleasant his voice is. One of my favorites, AD 🙌
THE FREAK SHOW
I'm surprised that he kept the same place from the 'Meet The Barkers' series!
such a cool video ! loved it
Never judge a book by its cover. He gives off calm and peaceful. blessings to him and his family.
Honestly I don't think I've seen Courtney smile this much in her entire life since she's been with Travis witch clearly shows how good he is for her I don't think I ever sore her smile when she was with Scott so it just goes to show what kind of man he is
oct. 17 is my birthday 😍😍😍😍
I have been fortunate in life, but this explosion of materialism...based on things he said, not his possessions, made me sad.
Wow one of the closet?? And had a few? Wow.. Very organise house & stuff but i dont see it on him physically
❤️❤️❤️ so real and down to earth 😍 love everything and such a beautiful couple
I've literally never heard him speak.  What a nice surprise!!!  Gorgeous home for a beautiful human being.  💐💐💐
i want a guy that make  me a coffee and enjoy some steak on Sunday 😆
He's a sweet, shy guy <3 Kourtney in background... is so Cute. Praying for their Salvation. <3 Jesus Loves you
They are perfect for each other❤
How sweet is this man 😍
Lovely man. Lovely family home🫶
He seems like such a gentle sweet soul, I love this for Kourtney 🥹💛✨
Surprisingly comfortable.  He's made a home for himself instead of crib, cave, pad or whatever rock stars hole up in.
He is so soft spoken and very sweet ❤️
Wow!!!
Super cool guy
You are nothing like I thought you would be. I love your style!
so many places to sit and kourtney picks the counter top lol
He owns a National?!?! What?! The only other person that I know who has one is my husband’s friend.
Peace and Love to 2 beautiful souls that found  their way to each other on this earthly plane.
Wow!! What a beautiful house🙂and couple🙂he deserves a great wife like Kourtney. He's a awesome guy
I love 💕 this one, he is such a nice guy who loves Kourtney. Everything she deserves… God Bless them 🥰😇
What beautiful spirit you are.❣️❣️❣️
ZenPunk hell yeah.
His voice is so calm and I love it
These “stars” are absolute d bags!
Awesome dude, vegan all the way! Delighted for your success 😊
Whatever you want to be in life, just be the best at it. Proof passion brings abundance in a different forms.
LoL
At first I thought: oh my god this house is nothing like this person  But later on It became clear to me that it’s not the house that doesn’t match his personality but it’s just Travis’s appearance that doesn’t match his personality and subsequently everything else.  I mean he seems to be so badass but as soon as he starts to speak you realize that in fact he is very gentle and intelligent.
Very stylish and tranquil🖤🙏

is there anybody on this planet that hasn't smashed a kardashian?
How to do school work in this house? No need, no need to work
Noticed those celebs drink tea are slimmer than those drink coffee or toilet water
Why is the drummer of Blink 182 talking?
Everything is so sterile and cold. Not my vibe.
Why is he so obsessed with fireplaces?🤔
I've always loved him since the show with his ex. He's seems like such a person with depth. House looks great and not over the top
I’m sorry to say it but I’m offended by his swimming pool.. never seen a swimming pool that small
When he said " I'm a car guy " well I can relate to that !
The guy needs a tanning booth...
Finally she's with someone that seems so in tune with her personality and they actually really compliment each other so beautifully
i literally gasped when he said "just talk and put our phones away and eat delicious vegan food". Let that be your sign to eat vegan today <3
Wow #TravisBarker so very beautiful for having it for 16yrs. Just love it.. I really wish I could have a stunning home like yours #TravisBarker I really do! But lol wishful thinking!! Thxs for sharing with us!!
You're one lucky woman Kourtney. That man loves the hell out of you.
What the he'll is he wearing 😳
i think his house was full of wal
She will destroy him like every other man she has touched
Wow! To think I could get into an argument on what car to take……..Some of us just have better problems than others! I would like my little condo to be that clean!
Not sure if he’s mellowed but he is so centered and chill nowadays.
Nice house!!
I don't understand what she sees in him
Seems like a nice, down to earth guy who’s really into his family and those closest to him. His voice is very soothing. Hope it works out for the long term for him and Courtney!
Is this the same house in Meet The Barkers?
He looked a tad bit healthier when he was with that girl Pink.
He can put ya to sleep. 😴 💤 Seems nice but very boring.🤷‍♀️ WOW he is so monotoned that ya can't pay attention. Sorry but VERY BORING.
Lebron doesn’t pick up his Dior bike & sold it to travis is what the business industry is
Anyone know where kourtney things are shoes, clothes, cars furniture house ect.
I love his voice, its so soothing and matches his home.
They’re relationship is a lil weird but I think Travis brings out the best in kourtney he loves her the way no other man would
interesting...at 8:05 I have the same cowboy (also designed by Matt) tattooed on me - exact same image, but the quote is different. That's awesome.
Would love to quarantine there lol
Shoutout to Travis for wearing a black leather jumpsuit in California.
This seemed more like MTV cribs than Architectural Digest! I sure enjoy all AD videos!
This life is but a blip, in time. Can't take any of that into the after life. No thanks. Everyone needs to remember that you must be Born-Again (of the Spirit), to get to Heaven. That means a change of heart or repentance.  1.) Believe that Christ YahshuWaH/Jesus (The Son of God) laid down His glory in Heaven, so that He could be born of a virgin  2.) Believe that He lived a perfect and sinless life 3.) Believe that He love's❤️ us so much, that He shed His blood on the cross, as a living sacrifice for our sins, so that we could have a path to Heaven, even as we are yet sinners and unworthy of Heaven  4.) Believe that He arose from the dead, after three days and ascended up into heaven, to be with the Father, until His return (Soon to come) 4.) Accept the free gift of Salvation, by faith, in believing in Christ and His finished work on the cross is the only way to Heaven. He already paid the price for all of our sins. *FINISHED:* YaHWeH/God wishes that none would perish, but it's your choice. That's it. You can be saved. Now go and spread this Gospel.👍👍👍
Such a surprise. He's so calm and centered. I love that he values the people in his life. I now see what Courtney sees in him. Well done!
Love their energy together
Wow he sounds the opposite of his music! I love it!!! Never judge a book by its cover!
FREAK SHOW!
you just wanna skip to the part where he shows his home music studio here is the time stamp start and end 8:26 - 9:29
Gosh, lovely man, a FAMILY man! love his home, peaceful vibes! Blessings!
“Watched my NYE performance that was pre filmed” 🫢🤫
Travis is PEACE personified
I love the way he tells us about his home. So calming😊. Seems like a nice guy.
bruh- this candel 💀💀💀
DOPE G WAGON
This is such a beautiful and calm home 💚😍. Interior is to die for, my goodness...
So much for being vegan and living a natural life when you have all those clothes and shoes and cars! Some people just like to put on a show and say oh I care about stuff I’m vegan and my bed is all natural!
I'll admit I pre-judged him. He seems so sweet. He >s definitely family oriented & involved in what ALL the kids are doing. This is an important part of him he Isa heat match for Kourtney. Congrats to both families enjoy, respect, & love one another.
Jesus......sooooooo boring 😴💤
Hope Travis is okay he was just hospitalized for pancreatitis 🙏🙏😇😇💫⭐💫😪
Show me a millionaire without a modern tranquil home
what are the 5 records
👊😎🌹
Awww he’s such a sweetie
He has a gorgeous home, don’t get me wrong. But if I walked through I would’ve  never guess Travis Barker lives there. The decor is reminiscent of a hotel. It just lacks personality imo.
He talks like her or am I hearing wrong?
GOSPODYN IDOMOWA
I love him even more after watching this. A very calm, composed, responsible, loving and caring man
"Minimal" down grade to a small home "under 10,000 sq ft" ... out of touch. But I guess it;s better and he's happier than when he was with that crazy groupie stripper he married for that MtV show back in the early 00's. His tee shirt collection is amazing tho.
Now I know why Kourt didn’t marry Scott because she is meant for Travis.
I feel like the line about feeling like you’re in a cabin somewhere is a dig at Tom.
Love his house, he’s a good guy bravo 👏🏻 I hope he had chose the right woman,
Iam happy for you guys😀
And not 1 thing shown about blink 182, the band and music he's most iconic for. Disappointing, house is beautiful but even in his studio there was nothing about them or mentioned. Idk just made me sad as a fan who grew up to their music as a young kid/teen.
lovely home be happy you too
Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved and thy house Acts 16 32
He seems like such a peaceful gent
He’s like Kourtney but with talent 😂🤣
Travis doesn't talk very much, but I love his personality. Such a nice guy. Plus, it seems like he and Kourtney are genuinely in love, and not marrying for media attention.
I will never understand why some people feel the need to sit on their kitchen countertops.  It seems so unsanitary.  The house is beautiful and Travis has such a tranquil disposition.  Best Wishes to the happy couple.
I went to see Jaden hossler on April 28 it was my last year birthday gift I'm about to be 23 he is such  a  good  singer
Can't believe he got with this basic chick. I was expecting a goth tour. That sucks....
🤟🤟👏
Looking forward to a tour of Kris Jenner and Khloe Kardashian's homes
It seems like a very peaceful space to live in. I love the whole design of it 🤍
Travis Barker came a long way.  That rockstar lifestyle gets old and every man wants peace, a beautiful family and a beautiful home.  Great job from the Architectural Digest team!
Everything in his home matters so much to him,he seems very down to earth thoughtful and loving.
Lovely modern look for a house...very calming...awesome about the Matcha tea corner.
Services across between Bieber and Marilyn Manson to look at his obviously much nicer person
WILL SOMEONE GET HIM IN A TANNING BOOTH DEAR LORD HE IS A GHOST
I like that his focus is really around maximising the quality of time with his family, and that the house feels like a clean homely home.
This is the new and improved Cribs. Love it
I really likes Travis energy
He’s a vibe fursure ♥️
How do you know when someone is a vegan?….they will tell you
His house is so relaxing.
I feel kind of smug knowing I have the same bed as them lol
Travis is the most adorable introverted emo in the world, like this little thing i want to protect at all costs (big blinker myself)
Need Home Decor Inspiration: https://youtu.be/PeODG6QNPcQ
Great humble person and an awesome drummer!
omg omg omg
I think he is amazing  personality no wonder Kourtney fell in love great couple
I want Tim Dillon to do a review of this nightmare on his podcast.
Is the same home from The Barkers?
Car collection...OMG 🤌✨
My heart just keeps thanking you and thanking you Dr Igudia for all you have done for me, you gave me your words that you could heal any sickness or disease, thank you for permanently curing me of my herpes simplex Virus you are amazing
It still has that empty hospital feel…
Wow he put out the gifts she gave him and he said she had a candle and bags of gifts he gave her in a closet?
I love these videos. You learn a lot about people from these. I just watched Nina Dobevs house tour and now this. They seem like really awesome and genuine people. I also love that he’s kept his home for 16 years ! It’s beautiful and relaxing and not some cold mansion
He has calm, intelligent and gentle energy. He also has good taste. It makes sense why she chose him.
Good lord can 1 room have color! Reminds me of prison….or like an asylum
So fake! So fake!
I wonder how many ppl know he use to have his own reality show on MTV back in the day. Meet The Barkers! That was the show, they have some eps here on yt.
BALANCE - OUT NOW!! ⚡️🛸 UFO 88
🔥🔥🔥
Dude give it with the stupid tats and wearing your mom's clothes
I think of California in 2020--2022 and I just see Studio McGee's influence EVERYWHERE. It could always be worse: I could envision the hideous state of Australian architecture and interior design and decoration. Now THAT is one loooooong conversation. The so-called luxury homes are hideous, soulless, half-done characterless monstrosities. That sector seems to ape whatever's going on in America or caters exclusively to wealthy international buyer's tastes (at the expense of all other considerations, which is shameful beyond words). Whatever rich Chinese people want, that's what these developers will keep churning out. Hideous. All glass and concrete with wanky indulgent flourishes that are impossible to personally decorate a REAL home around. Soulless corporate nonsense.
Told ya not go get married , but you went and did it anyway. Singing ;oh sweet sounds of American you Never miss a Sunday Service never got tattoos
Ohh, I just fell in love with Travis and Courtney 🥰🥰. Their voices are sooo therapeutic to me.
vegan hot dpgs so sad
I’m so glad Kourtney waiting and married someone that adores her, Travis is so sweet and well spoken
WTF are you wearing.
He’s not Dave Grohl I’ll tell you that. Talent and personality included
I love the two together and l know what Hod has joined let no man separate. They will be together forever in Jesus name
The only thing this video is missing is seeing the 4 frenchies!!!!!
Such a relaxing guy to meet, this was an amazing tour, AD!
U are blessed man I like you  my God blessed me love from 🇩🇰🇪🇹🙏🙏
He's as deep as a shallow pool. "drinking the Matcha you made me" hahahaha! You guys are pretty lame, you might have been cool in the 90's but that ship has sailed. You are just another rich snob.
Lmao he’s so weird. He really needs to gain some weight. He looks unhealthy
He’s so sweet
The day he proposed was the first day they hung out as more then friends?! I’m so confused.
Dopo aver visto quella di cara Delevingne mi fanno tutte schifo
placid vicious
He is so cute...And he really cares about his children
Who cares ..what did you have to do for your money and fame
Fucken vegans.
Oh wow, a Kardashian that’s not with a blk dude, good to see ONE of them not have a blk man fetish. At least THIS one is with someone for his inside and not JUST the color.
he got on the BDSM prison suit
Bizde de ekmek dört lira.
The grand national is dope!
Love it
10:34 WHAT does that candle say??
Looks dated
Oh Wow , Kourtney I totally get it now~Pretty amazing, nice house too. X
The vibes inside this house is so positive and calming ♥️ spacious warm and comfy 👍🏻
He used the word "like" at least 50 times😕
This dude is girly. He talks like a valley girl
BEAUTIFUL HOME,. GREAT TAST REMODEL. MAY GOD BLESS YOU , BEAUTIFUL FAMILY YOU HAVE. YOU ARE GEART PERSON, WITH GEART BEAUTIFUL ❤️ POSITIVE VIBES. KEEP MAKING 🎵 DRUMS, YOU ARE AMAZING PERSON , YOU ROCK. MUCH 💕 FROM :BOLIVA JOON.
i wonder what happened to all of his classic cars. wishing him the best. God bless you travis!
MTV cribs
Court jesters have come a long way since the old days..  hillarious chaos at it's best
I think Punk rockers are more cool n open heart than pop and rapper singers. Travis dont mind what others home are better he's just polite.
Kourtney is so beautiful
This is why you can never judge a book by its cover. I was obsessed with Blink in my youth—also watched the Barkers and repeats all the time—and my parents were unimpressed with the “tattooed drummer”. However, decades of seeing Travis interact with people, how he treats his children (both biological and otherwise blessed with), how he speaks about others, his centred/calming energy and his mindfulness have proven how incredible this human is (even my parents have acknowledged this). Kourtney is truly blessed, as is their family. Very happy for his happiness. I totally relate to so much of his vibe—we have our family home and don’t open it up to many people as we work almost always and our main family home is our sanctuary. We also have an organic mattress because he’s not wrong—mattresses can be very bad for you.
Wow his house actually feels and looks like a house.
He says "like" more then a Kardashian

Beautiful and inviting home. Travis is one of greatest drummers  of all times.
Travis Barker is the definition of Down to Earth, chill dude and Kourtney is Authentic and true. All in all, they're both Good, solid people.
Scott dont got this
Love this Guy. Back in the day he played in the Bowery I wanna say, I yelled to him. Hung over the balcony and tried catching 6 sticks he threw my way. I couldn't catch them cause my arms were not long enough lol .good times
all the money in the world and he is still bitter and wants more. says a lot about someones character
Everything he talks about is centered around his family, his children, and creating a peaceful environment. I find that so beautiful. I really think he and Kourtney will build a beautiful life together and I wish them both the best in the place that they call home.
It's lardashian designer.
Travis looks like a meth head with ok teeth. Money can buy you anything!
Such conspicuous consumption is revolting ...
I'm sure the decoration of this house has been a surprise for many viewers like me.A note to myself: don't be fooled by people's outward appearances.💀☠️🪦⚰️👻😀👍
What's macha>? Im I saying it right?
I’m just gonna say it… I hate his outfit! It’s like an outfit for an early 2000’s Backstreet Boys music video. Or like something Sisqo would’ve worn in a music video.
❤️
😻❤️🤲🏻
Now back to eating ramen in my apartment
I've seen his face scrolling through social media but never stopped to see who he is. Still don't know who he is but loving his vibe. Beautiful home•
So softly spoken and sensitive, I love that about him
Such a peaceful home did not expect this
The atmosphere is so peaceful and the decor is amazing.
a bit underwhelming
When he said he is a car guy with 4 cars in the garage and rides a motorbike
To be honest he still slanging dope
Being totally judgmental. I did not expect him to be a nice calm artist man . I get why she like him now
9:05 billie eilish acoustic guitar(with the blosh)
https://youtu.be/QqphB-_7KA0 mgk
Super loveeeeee
Literally,his voice doesn't match with the looks so called 'Travis Barker'😅. He sounds very soft and cool.😮
I'm one person who was always wondering what rily Courtney wnted or saw in Travis...now i know....his appearance doesnt match the calmness in him...God bless him and his Fiance
Hope you're better soon.
Go away Kourtney stop acting like we are here for you, don't speak.
Is this the same travis barker from that band my mom said i couldnt listen to in the 3rd grade?
Interesting how kourtney works on the kitchen counter 😂
He seems like a nice gentle soul. Great house. Lot of history
I'm surprised he's intelligent and expressive about his home. Surprising.
I have to agree with everyone in the comments. His outward appearance does not match his pleasant personality.
IMO Kourtney & Travis are one of the most iconic couples!  I truly love their energy, dynamic, the love, unity of family. It's really beautiful!
Nice guy, talented too… but why is any of this ok when hundreds of thousands of Americans live on the streets with thousands more living in their car. Watching these celebrity home tours is like the upside down world.
Travis Barker was a breath of fresh air and will be looking out for more of his content.
Vegan food! 🙌
I feel very connected from the way he speaks, very calm and well spoken. and I like his house especially that half circle wall and glass window, then I remember kendall’s house with the aisle bcs someday I want that half circle wall dan aisle in my house. Then suddenly I think about his zodiac then guess what? he’s scorpio. And all makes sense to me😂 we’re scorpio.
Mattresses can be toxic.....sounds like kourtney is in his ear.
Such dope cars! Screw electric cars fossil fuels Forever!
He seems to be so calm, and his house shows it as well. Lovely that he’s had it for 16 years, says a lot about him doesn’t it? I wonder though… why are some of the paintings and vases blurred out?
I give him points for being Unique!!.. He seems like such a true Artist!-
I love Travis but he said “like” too many times for me 😩😂
She surly did not get married to him for his looks because he put the Ugg in ugly and she’s probably got as much money if not more than him but he he so so talented more than she is in her profession.
Looking like a convict is the latest fashion 🤦🏼‍♀️  Why do people do this to themselves? Do they hate dignity?
I absolutely love this house!! So very relaxing and beautiful 🖤 Also, love his passion for tshirts 🖤
I love men with calming voices. Travis is just a surprise..have to give it to kourtney
such a beautiful home, omg. would probably never leave if i have a home like that. lol!!! 😂
10:29 if no one talking about the candle sent😭
Nice
Why he look like a zombie with all these tattoos this is disgusting and really awful Another thing why you have a tattoo on your head?!!! Looks like a mud
Travis seems such a nice person , i bet hes such a loving dad
His voice, and vibe… so chill and relaxing actually. Loving the house too. So not what I was expecting 👌🏾👌🏾👌🏾 Good for Kourtney she gets the best of both world.
Wow what a nice guy and beautiful home
crowd my vibe. i love that.
I love him now !! So glad I sow this, such a calm soul
He is so calming I enjoyed this wow. But also,….we not go talk about the candle that “smells like Kourtney’s orgasm”???  That caught me lol love that for them
Nice man but i can not see him so many tattoos
Bakr e kortunee são muitos amados no Brasil saúde muita saúde
A far cry from his MTV cribs long ago
How beautiful! I really like and admire the clean, minimalistic lines and feel of their home. It's special without trying too hard! It feels like love and family are in the bones of the home. Thanks for sharing. I hope  Travis is feeling much better!
The candle that says "THIS SMELLS LIKE KOURTNEY'S ORGASM" when he talks about his sentimental things 😂😂😂 10:26
Just seen mtv video of his house .... tons of changes but same cool chill guy 😎
Love his home and that he’s had it for 16 years. Shows that he loves stability for his family and that just because he’s a “celebrity” he doesn’t have to move every few years to have the “latest and greatest”.  Great job Travis.
Looks like a clown
Obsessed with the outdoor living space!!!
TOKSYKOLOGIAMARKAPERECZKIMACOIERZYNSTDAWUWIDAWSKI
Im Broke
I give this marriage 5 years tops !!!
Travis is the complete opposite of Scott in spirit. He’s fire and peace in the same body.
10:34 lmaoo I love this candle 😭
I really appreciate this home. You can breathe at it.
MTV cribs was amazing back in the day lol
I actually quite interested in his shoes collections thou
Зек
Damn Travis
I think Travis Barker and Young Thug are   A few of the most handsome men in the world besides my husband of course
rest in peace technoblade❤️🐷✝️
Boring
this is the least minimal house lol
I’m a big fan. He is so calm and sweet. Love him more and more. Very chill and genuine.
This os the punk rock mansión. Absurd.
Nice what a story, can't believe he survived that crash, God definitely gave him another chance.  Do the best with it!
Never heard this guy speak, just some ferocious drumming...he has a very calming voice, I'm falling asleep immediately
He looks like he escaped prison and house has a creepy vibe nothing tranquil about it. I doubt they are rarely together as a family. Notice he had to mention where they eat their VEGAN meals. Celebs simply push an agenda because they are puppets to their handlers. Trust me their lives are not something we should envy. I’m rich and have a mansion that makes them look poor. I will inherit it someday soon. You can too by accepting Jesus in your heart. I’ll attach plan of salvation. He loves you so much please take the time to think about why you stumbled across my comment. NOTHING is coincidence.   The A B C's of salvation:  A-Admit that you are a sinner Romans 3:10 Romans 3:23  B- Believe that Jesus is Lord , died for your sins and rose from the dead. Romans 5:8 Romans 6:23  C- Call upon his name. Romans 10:9 Romans 10:13  Jesus Christ is coming back as promised. Rapture of church first, 7 years of great Tribulation then he returns. Do you know Jesus Christ as your savior? Where will you spend eternity? Heaven or Hell! The choice is yours.
DANG ᕕ(ཀʖ̯ཀ)ᕗ now he's hospitalized....
I LOVE YOU TRAVIS ❤️💕💋I LOVE THE CALM IN YOUR VOICE YOU SHOULD MAKE CALMING INSPIRATIONAL PODCASTS AND ALSO MAYBE PLAY SOME SOOTHING MELLOW TUNES TOO 🙏PALEASE #TravisBarker
I’ve never seen her smile as much as she has w Travis… she’s beaming.. then I find out she’s pregnant…
Wait wasn't she with Scott three Christmas ago?????!!! 🧐
Wow. Just wow. How to make such boring interior design with big money.wow. Is this HG TV ??
His bold, abrasive exterior is an absolute contradiction  to  his calming voice and vibe. I'm digging Travis.  He is a prime example of not judging a book by its cover.
Who would have thought ?
His home looks like a sterile 5 star hotel.
This dude literally looks awful. I can just tell by the look on her face the way she looks at him when they talk that she’s with him solely because of his net worth and nothing else.
I don’t even know what a “Macha” is… I’m way behind the times
Looks like a modern resthome
Funny  it's all about money if see that dude  on the streets. I would thing he's a drud addicted
They way he said he only eats vegan food and how he looked into the camera was scafy
Such decadency, luxurious self-indulgence. Disgusting.
His house is beautiful I love the style very clean and minimal🔥
Oh under 10,000 sqft okay that’s nothing lol stfu rich ppl
4:01-4:07 if she talking about Mocha ☕️ its pronounced (mow-kah)
kourney sound like she on the kardashians rn lmao
Grand National GNX🔥🔥🔥😱😱
🤮🤮🤮 can we be more full of ourselves?! Yuck..
Nice Place!!
this is how real "punks" live. hahaha. pff
Good taste..good drummer..survived a plane crash..Kudos for him
Glad he survived the plane crash. He might be the only guy to ever accomplish that. Must be really close with the platforms owners.
His home seems to be liveable unlike Kim's. It feels homey and and like you won't be uncomfortable seating on his couch.
Lord what’s with the tattoos
Anyone notice at 10:58 when he was showing his bed there was someone behind the cusions
🤑🤑🤑🤑
That’s a Virus Not a Juno LMAO lol
They look happy, and he seems really nice. Enjoyed this one. Thank you for sharing your house with us ❤️
I can listen to him talk non-stop.  literally ASMR
"Welcome to my home. I'm Travis douchebagian..." 😂 He has favorite artists... who can draw a female butt like a grade schooler.  WTF is he wearing? 🤣 The house is actually decent.
O triste de gostar de um artista é que você não conhece sobre como os clipes não tem muito a respeito deles, esperava ver muitos grafites, mas parece a casa de um advogado sei lá, não me sentiria bem neste lugar.
This smells like Kourtneys orgasm.
Дом отличный,телка заезжанная)
98% of comments "I never knew his voice was so calming" "wow hes nicer than what I expected" in other words 98%of yall judge books by the cover and it speaks volumes on your own character. I appreciate this warning bc definitely keep my guard up with all these phonies on earth 💀
“I have like four frenchies”  WHERE ARE THEYYYY?!
“I have like four frenchies”  WHERE ARE THEYYYY?!
Love the modern organic vibe🥰
Travis seems so cool and laid back,   I see why Kourtney was so attracted to him!❣️🙏🏾✨
The home is beautiful 🤩
Kourtney is so lucky. He will not cheat on her thats for sure!
Oh wow, beautiful house. Such nice vibes from it and them as a couple. ✌🏽
“The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.” ‭‭2 Peter‬ ‭3:9‬ ‭NIV‬  ROMANS 10:9-11 “If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved. As Scripture says, “Anyone who believes in him will never be put to shame”   Matthew 11:28-30  “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”  “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”” ‭‭Luke‬ ‭19:10‬ ‭  God wants us to believe in His One and Only Son, Jesus Christ our Lord and Savior, who died for our sins :D When we truly believe in our hearts that Jesus is the Son of God, who died for our sins so we could have eternal life with God, we are saved from the eternal fire and have eternal life in Christ Jesus!! 💖 May God bless you all! 🤗
Alabama is so gorgeous tho knowing that she's still 16 years old. She will still grow and will definitely glow up!
A beautiful home for a man with the most beautiful soul.
I'm in love! That Grand National!
What a beautiful home.
Booooring
Am I gay for watching this?
He's starting to look like an old man with a bunch of tattoos lmao
He seems so down to earth 🤍 also Travis man..very jealous of that t-shirt collection I can’t lie🤙🏻
who else remembers travis mtv cribs when blink was good?
Exactly, don’t need a lot of spirit’s in your home
He just seems like a very genuine kind family oriented guy who knows how to have fun
Lots of blurring items in your videos in people's homes... is it because of nudity? private pictures of the family? copyright? It kills the vibe of seeing someone's place as they are key features of their interiors.
Really someone so calm but just entered turmoil to come. Kanye anit crazy
i,m not a tattoo fan but this guys style is exemplary
This is the coolest home I’ve ever seen
Ok but that candle 🤣
wtf is this dude wearing
That mickey mouse voice doesnt match the way he wants to look.
Why do vegans always look like walking death?...oh, that's right..they don't consume the nutrients humans need for optimal health.
Way before yall were together you spoiled each other? Huh..interesting..
Fireplace on all the time is way more toxic than a non organic mattress.
Travis home is is sm better than kims
What the hell is a VEGAN HOT DOOOOOG?
Cool 😎
I love this guy! Love his house, his ideas, his vibe, his everything is top notch 🖤
Look like someone Puked dull and boring  everywhere. How disappointing for a "Rock Star".
Is home is beautiful and refreshing but he doesn't look ideal father looking around kourtney's kids he looks quite scary and it must have been difficult for the kids to get use to him mothers don't think outside the box he may look trendy but might look different in the children's eyes for beautiful home
What a badass. He has more cool in his baby toe than my whole body..lol
🥰🥰so happy for kourtney
Wow i really how he explain
I love your vibe and personality. I totally understand your Zen- cleanliness, open space, clean eating, low key entertaining, family time and just feeling at peace.… you get to think clearly and away from the chaos, it’s refreshing. Your home allows you pure clean vibration. You both match that energy well. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home and vibration. It speaks volumes of who you are and why you are successful. Stay Happy❤️
Travis has great vibes and Kourtney seems to be the only sane sister of the bunch that deserves a real man.  Good for her.
Scott watching this: 😒 Also, LOVE the fact that Travis is one of those people who sits in a particular chair. That is so dad of him
I don't get those celebrities who spend a lot on their clothes and body to look that ugly !
Travis is perfect for Kourtney, and visa versa .. beautiful souls. ❤️❤️
Who the hell gets rid of vaulted ceilings? Haha
Le chemin du bonheurhttps://youtu.be/L9G-52XAt34
Bro why does he sound so feminine haha how u gonna be a punk rocker and talk about being vegan and drinking “motcha” haha
Only took him 02:36 to say his vegan.
Why do I feel like Chris Lilley would do the best impression of him
When I first saw TB I was so taken by him. Something about him, not his tats or rocker image, it was his aura, can't really say for sure. Kourtney is my favorite Kardashian. She seens down to earth and "normal"! She the most naturally prettist one of the  Kardashians  for sure. I'm so happy for ya'll ! 💓
all of their houses look the same. Khloe’s house was shown in the new show and from the living room to the in-home movie theater, it’s all the same especially with that muted color palette. most of the personality comes from his explanation, not from the actual things we’re seeing. it’s boring.
He needs some mr.cartoon art
Travis Barker looks like old Adam Levine
Travis Barker is so cool. Such peaceful energy and so is his home.
I’m just looking at the candle on his bedside 👀
Wtf happened to this guy,
A BEAUTIFUL HOME AND A BEAUTIFUL HOME OWNER. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS. 👍🥰
They said don’t judge a book by its cover.and true to that.
His home? Lol
MTV cribs vibes 😂😂😂
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Beautiful
I love how in America you can just ride a motorbike with no helmet. It’s insane.
cool dude
Gay
Travis isn’t the same after dating kourtney he’s not the same guy I use to kno
LOVE IT
Baldy!!
What's with Kourtney sitting on the counter in just a shirt? Did she hike it up?!😒
The term ‘welt’ comes to mind?
Lord disick >
Barker is a creepy punk.
It's boring just like you and Kourtney
I didn’t know much about this guy until now. But that voice is so relaxing. He could read me a book every night. 😂 WOW
he seems so nice, calming voice and beautiful home
🐐
i'm sorry, i couldn't help but notice " this is what Kourtney's orgasm smells like ", candle.
a little bit of shoes lmao.. i have 3 pairs xD
I really admire this guy . He's so calm and chill and he loves kourt and makes her really happy .  Much love bro 🤛❤️
Now I get it. They are so similar in thier personal life but lead different  work lifestyles . I get why they work so well!
What kind of head pillow is that on bed? Looks comfortable
Alien
This guy has an interview with death lol
Really hate the loud music during transition
Oh lawdy 🤣🤣🤣 the state of these idiots and they ment to be role models 🤣🤣🤣.Absolute over privileged spoilt twits.
Next to Keith Moon I think Travis Barker is the best  dummer of our time.
I watched it because of Travis. Not kardashians
The BEST house tour I've seen so far.
You need some food
How does some random persons home get 10 mil views
His vibe is beautiful. Thanks for the home tour!
His energy is so beautiful 😍. This is why you should be friends before partners. I'm so happy for Kourtney she deserves all the happiness 😊
https://youtu.be/8TEAwXeyGk8
instantly wow just wow, his image is kinda bit intimidating and dominant looking, but the way he speaks its just so gentle.
This is why you should never judge a book by its cover. He has a beautiful house but more importantly he seems like he has a beautiful soul.
😍
He seems so genuine and earnest. I hope she’s good to him.
Omg he has the WOLF OVEN. God I want a fricking wolf oven. Not that one, I like the ones with the small second oven not full sized. Im so jealous I bet they barely use both at the same time
I've never heard of this dude.
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE CANDLE IN THIS BEDROOM
For God so loved the world that He gave his one and only Son that whoever believes in him shall not perish But have eternal life. (John 3:16)✝️
I miss when he was a drummer
The way he talks and his knowledge does not fit his physical image, it's un-real when he talks. I really enjoy see him talk! So relaxing. Can't explain.
10:26 look at the candle This smells like Kourtney's .......... lol
❤❤❤❤❤
I wonder if Travis talks like Kourtney naturally or is he just mimicking her. He has that laid back energy like Kourtney as well.
Beautiful home , isn’t Travis such a lovely person, so Happy for Kourtney & Travis
Oooh Travis... Your so CLASSY, I just love you and your new wife... Much love 😘😘
It's giving basic. This house could use a little colour. It's not very inviting with everything white and muted. Doesn't give homey vibes at all y'all trippin
Nah Kourtney is in this too much lol I understand they're together but this is Travis’ house for 16 yrs not hers like can he have his moment without her. This is so cringe.
I think Kourtney found gold with him! He really seems like a wonderful guy
Bling bling BLING
He is the complete anthesis of punk.
Zen style more like shabby sheik you mean with that Kardashian motif going on 👎👎
10:28 pls look at the candle
Nice house, creepy guy.
I see stuff like this and wonder why I'm struggling to pay rent in a 2 bedroom. 2 grand would make me feel like I'm living here in paradise. Bills suck. Paycheck to paycheck sucks.
his voice is so calming and relaxing
Come on!  put a pants on Kourtney and stop guys with all the touches and kisses 🤢 - we're here for interior decoration!
If you think anything worn or just what he said was normal where all screwed, god damn makes me dream of my grandpa’s generation and real men.
His house is pretty clean and elegant but where does his kids sleep?
Very zen 😌 he seems like a cool guy
Dope spot
He is too good for Kourtney, she has no path, and is entitled, but love is love or lust
Wow, that woman turned him into an idiot! Matcha? WTF
this is so beautiful and simple! love it
Are we not gonna talk about the fact that his bed vibrates 🤨
Kourtney!!!!!!!!
There is something very comforting to know you have a seat at the table and 'that's your seat'.  It centers you and re-enforces the understanding and  knowing of that's where you belong.
The house is ok but really ugly furniture and no comment on the curtains!
Satan seed. Sedomites. Your time is short. Devil you were defeated at the cross I invoked the authority in the name of my Lord Jesus Christ who sprinkled me with his blood atonement to give me the victory Amen
If this man is a cultural icon, we deserve it
Im not a fan but I like him than Scott, I thought he was like bad boy or like arrogant but hes soft. They deserved each other Kourtney I mean
I know everyone thinks they're kind of a nuts couple. However, he seems like a very calm, well adjusted human. I'm happy for them. 💖
It's like we got MTV's Crib back but in classy!
Hopefully the Kartrashians dont hurt you or change you... stay strong, Kourtney was always the most down to the ground of them all.
He also kame a long way
I felt wierd watching this kuz he had no blink 182 memorabilia
Trav is always so nice ☺️
They really made kourtney sit there in a pajama shirt on the counter for what?! To pretend she’s using her laptop? 😂
🥰🥰
i can see why Kourtney is so in love with him
<3
This guy seems very thankful for what he has
Wow...I actually love his energy. Nothing like what I thought it would be. Guess I was expecting skull and cross bones all over the crib...but again...the wow factor tho👍🏽💕
This dude looks like a scarecrow, or ichabod crane lol he's so creepy
who is that ?
Travis>Scott
Extremely tasteful!
Do an episode with Jack blacks crib!
TRAVIS BARKER IS AN ANGEL 😇 ON THIS EARTH...HE BRINGS SO MUCH JOY TO THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO GO INTO HIS LIGHT...
Beautiful home
he seems very down to earth
"This smells like Kourtney's Orgasm" 🤣🤣
I really love how he actually talked and explained the meaning behind everything in the house. I feel like I haven't noticed that nearly as much or as in depth with other house tours that I've watched. Really personalized it a lot more, and kept it interesting. I like how minimal and clean it is, and how window-focuses the spaces were, to allow a great view of outside at all times.
Tavis please make a matcha line I will sell my kidney for the best matcha
I don't know so many people like him. But it's very clear you women have never dated an absolute master manipulator. The way he talks to Kourtney in that low creepy voice gives me chills. And not in a good way. He literally tells her "people just don't get us. All because we are affectionate." It's like no. The way he pulls her in real close and cuts her off from her surrounding and love bombs her. I've experienced it. I've lived it. I recognize it. He freaks me out to the max.
I have to say Travis is a real jewel! No drama no stress. I can't imagine what broke down his last marriage.  His love language then was calm and zen. Great union! I wish the best. Oh and the house and cars are cool too! I think I'm going to binge watch Meet the Barkers!!!!!
Let's go to the studio and check out those 80's BMX bikes!! #Hutch #SEBikes
The only place i like is the outdoor kitchen where he has bbq grill n open door oven... There is something about him, just couldn't put it right.. There is something always in his mind, n he is a very careful guy...
The design  of the home Travis  and his architect designed  is perfect  im really  into the plain and simple styling it's a perry much open home with just about every straight up and down in the main areas  and rounded off a few areas.. just beautiful
Too stale for me, needs more flavor
All this is doing is proving that middle school me picked the right member of Blink 182 to crush on.
He's all about his family. Never knew this side of him, totally loving it!!
Wow. He has a wonderful aura. Kourtney is lucky
Does anyone know what all five albums are in the painting?
Dude survived a plane crash 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️ crazy man
Dude survived a plane crash 🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️ crazy man
Tavis looks like Veran from the series Britannia
la casa me gusta. su prometida es una patética sin personalidad
Is this a joke? 🤪
He’s very grounded. Near death will do that. Kourtney Is so right for him. They are adorable and have a happy family. Blessed ❤️
One of the most beautiful celebrity houses I've seent.
I understand now why Kourtney marrired him. He is a nice guy, calm, interesting.
The house is brilliant.
Omg I love matcha tea,lucky lady!
The fact he can have anything he wants but cherishes the little things like a plate with a painting on it! Just shows money can’t buy this
Of course the house comes with a Kardashian to drain you of time, money & bodily fluids!
What a cool guy, calm and seens realy centered and genuine..
What a gen
Why is Travis wearing a large garbage bag?
sid viciuos poster makes it for me true punk
Q
As a fan of Travis for years I’m not happy about him being with this woman BUT as a fan I support him and his decisions if they make him happy
Keren
Is this an add for some heavy medication?
Petty bone  I had some of those
This is not what i imagined but i am inpressed
On the show she hasn't looked this happy and comfortable in years,good for her,he has a nice house
How much money did kourt blow on that car jesus
He has my dream home
Tattoo those walls! The house looks too conservative and proper!
Dressed like the janitor in a futuristic space prison.
Does he ever smile?
I'd love to meet someone with the same personality as Travis. She's one lucky lady ☺
What a Sweetheart. Now I understand what Cortney sees in him. Very happy for you Cortney!
Both of them Travis and Kourtney are Scorpio
10:72 not the candall
who was the record cover artist?
Beautiful home. Big Travis fan!
He seem so paceful and his home looks just like that. Love it.
i love how his home is very lived in. some house tours they just moved in a year prior while his is 16 years in the making. he’s a very calm, centered individual. i like him.
I am not really into his music but knowing what kind of music he makes I'm really surprised to see how simple his home is. I mean it's huge (not for a celebrity though) and nice but its not fancy.
I adore how much he emphasized his tables. They eat together, and that is so important and he realizes that.
Damn he looks awful
😪
Why did his pillow move by itself when he showed us his organic mattress?! Am I the only one who saw that
10:29 travis? em the candle?
Great home ,I love his kitchen
I like his voice
I would love him on a podcast. So lovely to listen to.
So crazy if yall seen him on Cribs back in the day to now
It's really cute how he finds a way to bring up Kourtney every now and then.
Whoa, I never would have expected this chill, simple type personality from him!! It’s funny how he’s the exact opposite of Scott.
Kourtney just becomes whoever she is dating, she doesn't have her own personality. It's kind of sad but at least she seems happy with Travis.
Hahaha he is so funny his "bed had the ability to the lift the head and base" like its so unusual and elite when its so common now. Good on him for being so blown away by something so common
He seems so nice 👌😘
Delishious vegan food , he said it really sad
The Kardashian women must have the best pu**y ever. Otherwise🤔 I just don't get it. Also, he gotta Nosferatu/mechanic look going on.
Wish there were photos before the renovation for context.
He lives in her a$$
So happy Kourtney  found love and a nice guy
Love the place...hate the *FACE*  #UglyTattoos
Did anybody else see the candle at 10:29 ???🥲
Okay so nobody saw the pillow move on his bed ??!!
Look at the candle in 10:28🤡
j'aime bien
Can’t believe I used to think this dude was “cool”
I love how calm he is
Vampires can now been exposed to light, thanks to a new technology included in sun-screens. They are n longer required to live in caves or castles. The same is for reptilians.
Deserve it travis.  Work hard.  And reap the rewards. 🙏👍
Did anyone see the what was written on the candle at travis's room 😂😂😂😂
school work
new information
Okay how Travis sounds Kourtney might just be the first one in Kardashians who got a good partner
The way he talks is soo different from the way he plays drums 😂
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I am really surprised to learn that he sleeps horizontally... I just assumed he slept upside-down.
Material People! ....Kardashian's life style. He deserves a better couple  than Kourtney.
This is an offensive amount of wealth. More people/families living in tent cities than ever. No one needs to live like this.
bonus points bc hes vegan ✊🏻😭 kourtney really won
He speaks very calm  and clear   awesome
That's a dream house and with fun too. Very nice
The place has absolutely no character. It's bland like a house for sale with rented furniture. Nothing personable. Just blank.
Loveee love his taste. Minimal but still interesting and classy🖤🤍
Ping-pong became my family's thing during quarantine too!
Yo wtf is he wearing like dude how do u not get heat stroke
AD is like MTV crib but the people featured in AD actually own the house they show.
This dude is in money heist right? 🤣🤣🤣
He's voice is so tone and nice, he's so calm, focused, kourtney found the perfect person. Good job girl
yeah I would even respect him if he didn't work with mgk
https://youtube.com/channel/UCTzoqjACsNh25pWxel7Xplg
What is that trash bag on his body?
Why does all their homes look like this?
Ugh.. the walking dead home tour?.. he literally looks like a zombie wearing a hefty bag..
Of course his shh is nice it’s fuccin Travis Barker 🤟
Why are you wearing a garbage bag
Amazing person! First i did not like him. The more he talked the more i like him. The house is: WOW! I love the person, the house and the story! Thank you for sharing.
I have never heard him talk. He sounds so young.
Damn so no one talking about that candle in travis room? lmao
Good man! May you see good and positive things only in life 👍✌️
“And have the coolest ping pong tournaments” He sounds so real and natural! Makes me feel a lot better about some of these so called “privileged celebrities” honestly… humble man fr 🙏🏼
When I celebrity worth $50m says a house with elevators is “too much” that’s gains my respect so fast! What a humble guy.
I think the Kardashian has got him to be more Zen, kids riding dirt bikes in the house to being all calm and relaxed, and he also sounds like her, this is how she talks, all low beat and unbothered.
I now see why she’s with him, he seems very thoughtful and calm 🤍
if he wasnt in a 1 piece leather jumpsuit I would have stopped 10 mins ago.
Ko je bre ovaj kao da je pao sa marsa e pare pare shta uradishe od ludi neznaju vishe shta da rade😱😱😱
Classy and sophisticated, except for the Kardashian 😵‍💫
Skin head?
Every single detail is dreamy!!! ✨✨✨
is no one going to talk about the “this smells like kourtney’s orgasm” candle at 10:35
He is vegan, because, yeah, let's save the animals (and consequently the planet), totally agree with you, now check ONE of his closets (11:17 – "this is one of my closets, I have a few"). He has a FEW, guys! Imagine if each individual had this amount of clothes, would the world be a better place perhaps, or perhaps apocalipse would finally be upon us? Hollywood, right? Consumerism is way more damaging than eating your meat, mate, and the example you're setting for the other 98% that barely has money to afford mainstream brands, is disgusting. Who else needs that many t-shirts? We all, of course, because we all wanna be like Travis.
Travis's home feels so warm compared to Kim's
Travis´s voice is so calming and so is his house. I never realized how sweet this guy is.
I love his taste. Gorgeous home
I absolutely love this man
"I really like driving cars, I'm a car guy, I love cars."
Watching him on the show.i immediately saw what she sees.what a peaceful soul he is.so affectionate.so well mannered so fatherly.i really like his personality. I love their love
I am guilty and now I get it.  I had this guy completely placed in the wrong category.  Based on his looks, I just had the wrong perception of him.  He sounds like a very chill guy, family oriented, and an overall nice and genuine person.  I do apologize, I learned from this for sure.
Bruno mars and mark ronson also have the album paintings in their houses 🔥
Travis literally forgot he has the Cadillac badge tattooed as the center peace on his chest 😂😂😂
oh no, a kardashian. how has this mans life not fallen apart yet
He says that he and Courtney just hooked up and got engaged in October 2021 and yet he says that she has candles at her house hidden the closet that he gave her years ago what’s up with that thought she was with Scott years ago
love travis but idk why he looks like hes becoming a hellraiser character while this is going on
Congrats to Travis and Kourtney! They make a beautiful couple. Very, very nice home. Love to see it!
Something tells me that Travis is the kind of dude that has never laughed at a fart.... disgusted actually. He's one weird cookie.  Sick house though!
sooooo boring zzzzzzz and los angels media lovey dovey vegan zen tabloid non offensive out of touch easily fooled public glossy mag lap it up like lemmings.
I would buy this house if I had the money
Heard he moved there because of infatuation with Kim so weird
So zen!! A matcha corner ahha
I pray for Travis and Hourtney to have at least two more children. One should be called 'Love' and the other, 'Prosper'
Is any one gonna talk about the. Candle
Looks like an upscale apartment lobby with a few showrooms attached lmao
Why do Kardashians bfs always have to talk like them
I pray them and their family get saved. John 3:16-21 💝
I need me some stable man like Travis
I love this guy
he sounds gay af
His body full of tatoos, but he loves 'peace of mind' and his voice is calming, well i kinda see why kourtney fall for him...
I am literally liking this guy more and more
That's Charlie Zelenoff.
🤩 wow what a beautiful home.. perfect
Greetings from Finland!
they creep me out, it's sad how little talent it takes or frankly no talent to become successful
Travis is such a calm cool dude 😎
I need that mattress. Does anyone know the brand?
This house makes me feel depressed & not nice. Not sure why maybe as it’s not my cup of tea but just doesn’t make me feel nice I’d hate to be in it let alone live in it
Foof  I like his house style
HIS BEDSIDE CANDLE 🤠
Thais is by far the coolest house I’ve ever seen
I'm watching a game character who is emulating crazy - shame I loved Blink182
10:27 THE CANDLE WTH
Travis seems super outgoing. Green flags all over him
Heyyy!!! He is very normal guy. I was expecting something funkyy
these people are so rich and on such a different level socially it's scary, like frfr the guy specifically is weird monotone and sounds demonic
He was waiting for Kim to be single n DTF again. Not Kourtney, he did not move there for Kourtney n Kris knows it. Idk why she said “you know what Travis said to me? That he moved to calabasas just so he could be near Kourtney. Wether she was w somebody or not . He just wanted to b near her.” Why would she say that when 16 years prior he had just started dating Kim, and wrote, wrote in unerasable ink in his book, that right before Kim blew up n she was in a club w Paris Hilton, he saw Kim, and knew immediately “that he only had eyes for Kim.”
This house is my aesthetic.
house of mauve
10:29 guys look at what's written in the candle.!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭
OMGOSHHH WHAT A SCARY INDIVIDUAL :p===
Strange looking human being. He’s like a skeleton with tattoos. Really bad tattoos. Obviously he must have some money for any of these women to be interested in him.
lol courtney appearance was a bit cringy
The reason we all like how it’s modern but not cold/stiff/unwelcome is because:  Almost all the white (including the walls) are actually off white and have a touch of warmth, same for many of the gray tones. There is not a lot of high contrast, rather there are gradients in every room.  Motifs are smooth and subtle, there is a mix of shapes and textures- with no strict adherence to a particular theme  There is a good amount of furniture in most rooms but no clutter or unnecessary decor, the furniture layouts are also very “normal”, the types of layouts you will find in many middle income homes- just with larger furniture and bigger rooms. There is also no unrealistic or uncomfortable furniture (like square plastic chairs or pure white fabric furniture)  The lighting color mimics natural light, it is soft and allows for shadows, the lighting is really consistent throughout the house  There are meaningful mementos rather than “just for show” decor - and the house is lived in!
That's an $18,000 ping pong table.
this guy literally type i vibe with and hang, humble laid back just cruising enjoying life
Where are all the old caddy's?
The Kardashians have a great taste
No tattoos like that :( https://youtu.be/qZEITEeRV18
My dad helped him with his mortgage for this house lol
A very beautiful home <3
A very beautiful home <3
Travis Barker seems like a good guy.
He looks scary, why are all these tattoos on his body, God made us beautiful, why do we spoil this picture?
Best house 🙌
This is probably my favorite AD house tour.  So clean and simple and so much love and sentimentality invested into it.  Such a cool guy.   ♥️🏡
So cool, he seems cool too
Absolutely dreamy place
He's pretty wholesome
I love his music and I love the fact he’s a vegan fellow ( and been vegan for years ) and he’s never bene afraid to say that, even when it wasn’t well accepted.  The kitchen is really beautiful, minimalist but not too much, still with that calming and comforting vibe. And I like he has fireplace basically everywhere.  I find him a very nice and down to earth guy. Much respect Travis 🤍
Sick freak
His vibe is so beautiful matches the house full of peace
ok i'm happy for kourtney now
I've always loved his voice it's so calming and relaxing,he seems like a really great guy,I'm happy for Kourtney & Travis.
Travis so cool you are there for them … all the small things
Very nice, the house, his voice and the vibe. Thanks
why is half the art blurred?
Gangster looking
is he wearing a leather onesie? Seriously
"My my my my me me me." It just never ends. Dear Lord, please wake this person up.
He seems so cool. I love his energy ✨
His voice is so nice to hear ❤️
Good grief Wtf happened to him
Thank you. 👏👏👏
I just really love this man! Keep on shining Travis!
Beautiful home. Travis, despite all the heavy tattoos and dark clothing, seems like such a gentle soul. His home seems to reflect his calm nature. My favorite area is the backyard.
These videos are so fake. They are like product placements for the rich.
I've asked myself a million times: "what is Kourtney thinking! This dude is creepy." Fast forward, he is so chilled; so smart; so calm.. Remind me not to condemn without truly listening to someone's heart.
Not a fan of the house or the way its styled. But it's his home. He can do what he likes
I’m loving Travis and Kourtney! They’re so cute together! I would have never guessed she’s be into a punk rocker type, but it really works, I feel like when I look at them, o can see why Kourtney and scott were all wrong. I’m loving this house! Every room has “zen” vibe
I thought this guy wider 😀 Somehow I see sadness in his eyes or 🤷‍♂️
Is the first song an actual released song? Does anyone have ID? Sounds so fresh 🥶
12:17 - Sorry, a what? In California? Just randomly at night? FML I thought you only got this in Australia :P
Every time I see Travis, he reminds me of Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. Same vibe 😄
... he's actually such a cool guy, I've never seen or heard him talk or seen more that a few seconds of him. Love his vibe and his home. 👌🏾
Great looking house… terrible outfit though haha
I love his home. Its appeal is very calm, smooth, comfortable, and homey.
Absolutely love seeing people eat their judgement when it comes to Travis. SO MANY judge this book just by the cover. Its pathetic af!!! Travis is an exquisite human being that just happens to be covered in tatts.
Your Awsome Travis❤️   happy for you and Khourney❤️
I love This for kourtney. Scott was so traumatic and Travis is so peaceful
Wow….Never judge a person by his or her outward appearance! Lesson learnt…
So clean and peaceful 😯
LOL you proposed on your first date? 😕
When he said the house is “just under 10,000 sq ft” like it’s small 😂
Travis married a kardashian to stay relevant
He's an example of a person who should not be judged by his appearance. Such a beautiful  home😍
Tangnang Kourney yan di man lang nag suot ng robe!
I was surprised! what an awesome space!i am not a fan, i knew nothing about him, just like architecture and design. but what a chill guy & seems like great dad. i like him. hahahha
His house has a Very cozy vibe unlike all the kardashians, which looks rlly artificial to me😑
I really like his low key energy. Very calming
Beautiful home  Wish you and KOURTNEY all the best of luck and happiness  Good bless you all 🙏❤
did any one  saw that pillow moving by itself, or am i the only one 🙄
😆 they are so in love
Never expected to be so soft lol
"minimal"
They are not living together?
Just 10000 sq feet is all
Be looks like the missing  Painting off the Wall. Courtney had to be Blind folded  or Having a hangover.  Scott  should be happy.
Travis the zen goat
Kourtney works? lol
Honestly seems like a really nice person
I love the fact that it’s not that big
This stuff completely lacks character, sad.
His house and personality seems calming
Never judge a book by its cover, because  Travis is full of tattoos most of us assume he's a certain way but this video has certainly proved us wrong. Never imagined he's such a soft spoken down earth person
CHIC!!! Waldo is amazing. Good decision Travis
Well, I was judgmental at first. HE IS SO CALM AND COLLECTED. I expected punk rock and mess! THIS IS THE OPPOSITE! and beautiful.
Nice place but get rid of the Trash Bag overcoat.
The first minimalist house that I like! Looks like an actual home, instead of a museum or dentist waiting room :)
I love his and kourt's energy so much but is it true he dated kim first? 😭
use the helmet bro
i wish he was my father figure omg
"Maw Chugh" does he mean "Mow kah"? Or is "Maw chuh" a brand of station?
Such a humble man seemingly and abouve all a family man . I love how he managed to unknowingly include his fiancé as much as any normal guy should. It’s so nice to see them happy and together with there kids. She’s always been the only “K” who I accept and I respect as human . Salute 🥂
Great video but if you come to New Zealand don’t sit on table tops 😊
Travis has always been cool!
whos watching in 2018//
Is this the way most people want to live? Scary.
what s cool, calm beautiful man!  She lucked out!
Wait so the same day that they became more than friends was the same day he proposed? Did I hear that right LMAO
Have to say one of my favorite parts is when he said they love to eat vegan food. 😍
Cool.
He seems like such a sweetheart
It’s the fact that he has a piece of Kourt and their kids in most parts of his home. So cute!!! And the fact that all the couches can become a place to sleep😭awesome
all that money an his house is kinda lame an boring 😢😢😢
Thank you for sharing your home with us. You have excellent style.
Does his outfit at all match with the interior design? What is his style?
Cozy
hilarious. These people come from another planet
way too sterile looking
Pelo que a midia fala , os filhos da esposa atual dele é bem agitados,  ele deve ser muito da paz e gentil mesmo!  sejam felizes
Hollywood is like a different planet full of weirdos.
He’s definitely sophisticated person. Lovely seeming person.
Ppl judge him from his tattoos being all over the place. His home says so much more about hm & the fact he’s lived in the same place for 16yrs say so much more. He’s a well put together guy! I like him.
I love the minimalist style of his home and I totally get where he's coming from when he talks about a home that doesn't clutter his flow and is zen. When we recently moved into a bigger home, we didn't have a lot of stuff to fill up the space but now I like the fact that it's very clean and uncluttered. The curved windows in his home are also really special. I would actually like to see a comparison between how the home used to look and now.
Alabama
🇺🇸 where's the lines of coke, the needles, condoms, strippers pole, the swings, toys!     This is so bland.   It's a setup for publicity.  😌😴😴😴😴😴
Dude is wearing a bodybag 😂
I love his voice. Soooo serene
the house is okay.. im more interested in the BIKES and The cars he had. Phenominal taste in cars and bikes
Pretty boring and lifeless...idk...somehow I expected that famous people with all that money could spend it to create something special instead that generic stuff we see most of the time. Sure, it looks kinda impressive...but would I wanna live or raise kids there? Idk man.
His voice is so soothing …omg, he can just read me like recipes , and I would listen and enjoy lol
Is this about his home or Courtney ugh lol
Wtf makes you stupid enough to think that anyone wants to see this stupid sociopath who doesn't have enough sense to not tattoo his own face and neck?
Has Courtney moved in permanently? Also how does he cope with the ex?
Now LeBron knows where his bike is.
Travis has such a gentle voice.
That is the worst art possible on his wall)))
Typical California dwelling: Obnoxious and lifeless. Next.
i LOVE him & kourt together. their fam is the cutest ever.
Ugliest people ever
Beautiful  home Travis. It seems to fit you and yours. Stay safe, God bless.
I met you a few times I would love to meet you again. You are my hero
“ I Murdered it out” 👀😒
Where is Tom's seat?
LOL we were wearing DOCS in the 80’s 🤷🏻‍♀️
He LOVES those pillows. Every room
who loves cali
hello i love the homes
He’s so icky!
The way he talks about his wifeeeee 😍
I love everything about this so much 🥰🥰🤩
He’s soo calm ..I’m just happy for kourtney ❤️❤️
Kourtney and Travis are the real deal
loveit❤
John 3:16 “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
I did not know he was. A catholic no wonder he married in Italy in a catholic style .Very sacred wedding .
What a beautiful,tranquil,modern,minimalistic home and he is also very kind,warm and peaceful no wonder Kourtney loves him he is a great guy better than scott by far
DID EVERYONE MISS THE NAME OF THE CANDLE ?
WTF is he wearing?
I’ve watched a bunch of these celeb home tours- most of them are SO boring and the celeb always seems pissed off. Not Travis! This was so interesting and SO genuine! He really opened up about his life and who he is without any arrogance or pretentiousness. And he’s a good storyteller!  Just a great guy with a great heart and phenomenal talent!!  Kourtney is so lucky!!
I used to be very material oriented, I would shop for cars, jewelry, shoes, and live in a beautiful house. I used to travel because my job (......) took me all around the world.. But, not any more I just focus now on my health, GOD, and my KIDS waiting for them to get married. Life is not about materials specially all this stays here, we can't take it with us. SAD. but, I enjoy traveling, praying, meditating, and eating healthy the rest NOT MY INTEREST.  I gave away many of my stuff, isn't what would happen when we are no longer here? SAD again. but, hey don't get me wrong.. Nice house TRAVIS.
Kourtney the lucky one😘
He seems so down to earth and he seems so peaceful. I’m getting only the sweetest and kindest vibes from him. I’m so happy for him and kourtney ❤️
He is so smooth 😍
I am so glad I watched this! Travis is such a deep, centered, caring, present, human being. ♥ Thank you universe!!!!
That grand national though..*thumbs way up*
Isn't he wearing the rubber suit a coroner wears
Lol
Un couple de satanique
Beautiful to see you together ❤️
This place is lovely. He has good taste
He's a sweetheart.
"LeBron never came and picked up his gold Dior bike" That's a line I didnt think i'd hear
Wait ! What ? Mattresses can be toxic? I just found out about this smh 🤦🏻‍♀️
Man you've started talking like them Kardashians
Not expect this is how he is.. he is soo chill compared to psycho immature scott. He annoying af
I thought he was just a drummer?
Where does he keep the Costco boxes?
This guy seems normal isn’t he a rock guy?
What a genuinely nice guy 🙂
Such a comfy looking home.
Img I totally understand why wen fall in love with him. He speaks like a 90 year old sweet lady 😂
Bruh they ain’t a matching couple she should be with me “
😱😍😍😍
Haha
WOW! First of all, Travis is such an old soul. He is pure zen, the way he talks, walks, decorates. His home is stunning. It is warm and inviting.  He seems like the best father and sweetest guy. I can always tell when a man loves his significant other by the way he talks about her, cherishes her gifts and really cares about her and her family. Thank you Travis and thank you AD for the fabulous tour !
TrAVIS sIR.. you are a poser!!   jk 😁
What a great guy.  They are both very blessed
He did a great job.  Just beautiful
So he broke up with Behati Prinsloo? When was that.
that kitchen is PHENOMENAL OMG
Beautiful Home n Very Sentimental Guy.!!    Best Wishes to You n Kourtney 💚
I hope their relationship won't change after marriage🙏🏻
who r u???????????????? you freak.
Travis's house says a lot about...Kourtney!!! 😅😂😂😂
Il a une belle voix 🥰
This guy looks like a Mara salvatrucha Salvadorian drug dealer.
He seems nice, but what excess! It's a little obscene.
I see why Kourtney loves you, Travis ... I think I do too!! ... I hope you and your family have the best life ever ... ♡.
That Buick OMG!
il est trop mignon dans sa façon de s'exprimer, lui et Kourtney sont très inspirant <3
where is the adrenochrome room..
Yea I’m team Kourtney on this one! He has a beautiful energy.
I’m a minimalist. And this is my dior bike 😂 straight up comedy. No judgement, he’s the greatest drummer to ever live
I’m like, a minimalist, so I like that this house was under 10,000 sq ft 😂
Congratulations
I always like this dude I hope the marriage works out between him and Courtney and I hope they keep it off of the Kardashians TV show I just have their own happy marriage without all that crazy TV mess
I can't put the picture of Christian-bale in a translusid poncho with an axe , OFF my mind.
what have they blurred on the wall ?..
he looks like a punk and is calm like a monk.
Minimal but let me have a huge closet just for t shirts.
Fontana boy living that good life. Stay blessed Travis.
Travis has to be the most zen drummer ever.
They’re such a good couple
How many marriages does that make between these two?
Jesus is love
This dude sounds exactly like a kardashian  And he’s Out here showcasing a multi million dollar mansion with 8 cars and is Out here calling himself a minimalist.  Whilst being dressed like a half hellraiser villain half priest villain.
Very nice
Wow. I most definitely see why Kourt is head over hills ! 👏🏻 beautiful home and human.
Love the house.
Who knew Travis Barker was an introvert🦥...  I'm lovin' it and his house is so zen 👻💆‍♀️💆‍♂️
watalaga sa pang labas na anyo ang kabutihan nang kalooban  mukang mas mabuti siyan asawa kay kourtney kisa don sa isa na puro sama nang luob ang ibinigay kay kourtney
Is this the same house he showed in MTV Cribs years ago? I mean remodeled, but the same location?
Vibe vibe, grow up punk and stf u
Of course vegan, hahahaha, very punk rock, this little show
Energy energy, STF U punk
Ever since his plane crash he hasn't looked that good and like looks sick and malnourished I hope he's okay because he just looks sick
He grew up not too far from where I live now, 15 minutes away. Small town (Fontana, Ca). He is surprisingly calm and humble. He seems like he is a genuine, kind person. I see why Kourtney and him get a long. Same laid back personality. I'm happy for them!💕
It’s time for some art in that movie room. Cheers from Utah.
HE IS SUCH A SWEETHEART!!! that calmness in his voice is so comforting
the candle at 10:34 "this smells like kourtney's orgasm" lmao
He’s so adorable and the only thing more lovely than his home is the smile on Kourtney’s face when she’s looking at him-
Kourtney is identical to her mother. Pretty much twins! Lovely 🌟
Wow this is true proof you don't judge a book by its cover! What a cool guy! I never knew!
He is such a great guy! I see why Kourtney married him. He seems like a very nice man.
Damn all that money and he wears slacks doc martens an a t-shirt lmao if u where broke you wouldn't wear that but the house looks great
Damn 10,000 SQ feet,, how big was the other house lol and you know that Sunday get together "brunch" sucks lol because vegan food boo boooo.. people lived to be 100 yrs old and never stopped eating meat 🍖🥓
Best house I have seen with just the right amount of things in it. It resonates zen. It also has the vibe of relaxation. You two are forever. Perfect home! ✌🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Im so impressed with how well spoken he is, very intelligent and thoughtful
Love the house and decor.
Sit together, put our phones away, eat delicious vegan foods... it's so inspiring 💖
Sorry but this is so bad decoration
The house is boring
Beautiful
Hi from Russia 🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺🇷🇺 Travis Barker - the best 👍💯
<3 !!! so romantic
kwl place nice tatts
10:57 Pillow  🤔
I love the cadence of his voice…so calming
Whoever this guy is, he seems nice and down to earth.
Fontana dude
A very beautiful house
Hahaha when Kourtney magically appeared… I thought when she picked up her laptop it was really a black bar edited in after the fact to hide her couchie.
I enjoy his convict chic look.
LOVE YOUR HOME, The house is nice, but your home is amazin
That grand national 😍😍😍
@5:00 I'm the same way 👍
This guy Travis beside being rich also very lucky . The women who loves him not for his richness but for his personality. It's good to be loved.
Nothing special about this house, it's decorated like several of my friends' homes. AD, what were you thinking?
Just a beautiful home indeed
He looks so odd and awkward on the outside but on the inside, he seems like a really nice and kind person.
The house of my dreams....💖
Never heard him speak before he's really pleasant
He looks like a prisoner.
Who would have ever known he was her true match all this time
I told you Travis talked!
him and kourtney makes so much sense now
His tone is so relaxing and so calm…
Seeing his home and lifestyle , him and Kourtney really seem suited to each other. Good match
Bruh looks like a gang affiliated inmate in a jumpsuit who just got out and is reintroduced to the world and all the new tech.
Not like any other celebrities house. It’s such a welcoming home! I adored this video. He seems like such a calm and loving person.  🥰
I would have never guessed.  Very cute couple !  This is exactly what Kourtney needed. I don’t know Travis personally but I get the hunch he’s very chill, stable, and loving. I’m super excited for you two. Not to mention that Travis mentioned the cramps which I hold close to my heart. LOVE !
JAMES SCOTT NICHOLSON,ONTARIO, CANADA 🇨🇦 I AM A 50 YEAR OLD, 40 year guitarist and I AGREE WITH THE CONCEPT OF WHY ARE THE DRUMS SET AT THE BACK....I THINK WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY THEY SHOULD HAVE THE KIT ON A SLIDE,IT COMES FROM BACK TO MID WAY AS YOU ARE OPENING YOUR SKILLS AND FINALLY UP FRONT WHEN THEY ARE THE MOST PROMINENT,AT THAT POINT IN THE SONG...CALL IT SCOTTY FOR ME LOL TOP LEFT ❤️❤️✌️ WHEN YOU PLAY IT GETS ME SO HYPED I JUST WISH I COULD GET HALF OF THAT AND I WOULD WRITE NUMBER ONES I SWEAR ....ROCK ON
10:34 ☠︎︎☠︎︎☠︎︎
Honestly seems like a pretty sweet guy i giggled the whole video- their relationship with themselves and their children is wholesome♡︎
Was thinking..Travis is pretty chill man, then he shows the National...yup, very cool. I've driven one of those. It had such killer suspension  the quick pulling torque on it is very exciting for sure....two thumbs up Travis!!
He's decent 👌he makes me want to drink matcha!! Zero ego here. Best guy I mean guru 😄
He sounds like a sweet man but he’s a manly man.
Who needs that much room?
I watched so many millionaire house tours that I cant believe he has only 4 luxury cars
Todo muy minimalista... menos su vestimenta... plástico puro !!🤢🤢🤢....imitadores del reciclaje!
Listening to Travis speak without seeing his face he sounds like a 20-year-old to me 😵 I think he’s very youthful at heart and has such a calming energy. Loved the house and the tour!
If you remove the word "like" from this interview it would have been 12 minutes shorter. Kourtney couldn't bother to put on a pair of pants?
WTF is up with that outfit?   Just imagine wearing that and going about your day.... people would think you're from fcking Mars.  He looks like an edgy version of Mork from "Mork and Mindy."
Travis , you most definitely do not drive your self 😂🤌 stop tryna convince , you be chauffeured boy
Nasty hot in that nasty Calabasas. Can't stand that city.
As a architecture student and drummer, I really want this home lol
Sorry, but the iterior of that House look Ugly af. 🤢
Wow. Such a glorifying  Advertisement for communism. And I’m from a communist country too. Jesus please help us all.
I love how he said 'I have 3 children' even though him and his ex wife were already over. He still seeing Atiana as his own. I really adore that kind of mindset.
Precisamos aceitar que essa casa é de um bom gosto incrível e lindaa
What is motcha  ?
Come look at my home while I wear garbage bags😂
Ok seriously Courtney?  You can't just let him do the interview?  So pathetic.
His voice is so calming
What a nice Person, with a nice Family in a nice Home 🍀
He is so softly spoken
I hate them both
First time I've seen or heard your essence and learned you are so very special. I am so honored to share your beautiful home. I pray that you and Kourtney live beautiful lives together for the next 100 years
Nobody lost his doll and I’m happy about it 😬💅
10:56 the pillow moving upright by itself? scared me for a second 😅
All big house and no kids around .just sick souls around.
I love how his future wife walks in half naked with only his shirt on like she doesn't care. Those are wife goals right there!
I miss meet the barkers
I hate he's a Kardashian now
Ugh, can't stand those two😖😖
Je sais que vous finirez toujours par divorcer🤣🤣🤣
lleno de libros, ninguno leido seguro
Amazing house
He should make a podcast , such a relaxing voice .
I'm proud that you're in a beautiful home and you make memories there and congratulations on your engagement.
I’m officially obsessed with Travis. He seems so sweet and genuine. I was expecting the house to be black and have skulls everywhere lol.
Jeeezzz he looks so blown!
Anyone else think he's voice changed?? Sounds like her alot
Travis do you drink human blood?? You worship evil!!! Oh!!!!! 🤢🤢🤮not attractive.
Vegan 🤮🤮
It’s all about the cash with the Kardashian’s!!!!! This guy gives me vives of a Salvadoran Maras, no thanks, even if he is nice and calm walking around his house  No thanks!!!!
Love the home and love him for Kourt.
OBSESSED with this house. It's so well put together. Anyone else in love with it?
I never expected him to have a humble personality. So likable.
Great house
to say that man made mansion money of his skill as a drummer and music and to devote a closet to it is discustin.
Don't care about him or his wife
Love his home and I think he made Kourtney a better person because he is just so calm and sweet and Kourtney needed that. The space looks light and peaceful. Full of good vibes and family. I love it.
Aww he’s been in the background for years over kourtney so cute there first night hanging out as more than friends he proposed to her
What a beautiful home
Tantas sillas para q kourney se siente en la mesada 😏cuando va a madurar esta mujer?
Not to make this about khourtney but she is glowing in a way I’ve never seen. They are truely in love.
Wow well done Kourtney, she finally found a decent man!!!!
Wow well done Kourtney, she finally found a decent man!!!!
Talk about not judging a book by its cover.
Nice !! He seems   like a nice guy ! I love the house
Love Travis Barker & Blink 182
Beautiful house!
💯💯❤️❤️simplicity
nice crib...
Beautiful home could really chill out there.
Omg that thumbnail makes him look awful
Very cool beautiful home. Very impressive!! 💖
The stage Kardashian was the worst part of the video.
No mural of the body guard he used as a pillow in that plane crash?
Kourtney smearing her grotty ladyparts all over the kitchen counter is just what I'd expect. Put some clothes on you grot.
Sweet
GNX MY DREAM CAR ID MARRY KOURT TOO😭😭😭❤️‍🔥
Not going to lie his cars were sick
Thought this was jack Harlow by speech until seen the bloke
Late stage capitalism, when your identity is so tied up in a brand that you tattoo it on your body.
Travis Barker had what it takes and a mind blowing  personality ! This is why Kourtney married him as fast as she did ..  The marriage will with stand everything ..
Lol we all knew you were a creeper..lol cats out of the bag ...you wanted Kim but you settled for Kourtney....your words you wrote Smh
Poor Scott he is a Loser
I am not hating on this guy but at one time he had to be friends with Scott living so close and going to the house so much I don't care how much I was in love with Courtney could never do that to another man sorry just couldn't do it little weird something like a stalker
Sounds like Travis sleeps on the couch, ALOT!
Awww! He’s so calm .. it’s so cool .
Delicius….(pause)…vegan food 🥹
Nothing makes you appreciate life more than almost dying
KOURTNEY QUE MAL GUSTO TIENES ❗ PORQUÉ NO TE ENAMORAS DE UN HOMBRE NORMAL ??
Dude needs to quit the vegan diet, poor guy looks like a zombie and has no energy.
Very peachefull home, love it
Anybody else fall in love with Travis more after this?
Genuine guy!
I'd love a peaceful human like this tooooo
@casimiro olha essa mansão
Sure the house is very nice, if rather boring. But who knew he was such a pretentious, self-interested narcissist? For someone so talented and successful he seems oddly desperate to drop names. I suppose it makes sense that he married a Kardashian.
He is so calm ı shocked . I was expecting him different . His voice tone is so pretty and i am happy for Kourtney because he act her like a princess 💖
lol i hate being poor
How soon will this relationship go sideways?  They just don’t know how to pick’um.
He doesn't like to many people in his home because this is where he gets his peace of mind and relax. I can relate to this, you have to be mindful of the energy people bring to your home. Glad to hear I'm not the only one who is selective on who you invite to your home.
Why is he wearing a glad bag as a outfit?
I still don't understand why he married a Kardashian
Why is he wearing a garbage bag?
Very organised and put together. And im glad Kourt only appears for a few seconds and not ruin it with her Kardashian vibes .because this one is all about Barker
He is very calm its what i like about kort she has always been my favorite.. The fact that she passed the law to not put bad things in makep is a huge thing but how is Victoria secret doing it still?! I found 3 bad things in the sprays
Amazing home!!
First off im so happy for the both of you hope i can take a trip with my daughter to show her the ocean in California and everything else thats amazing
I love how much they treasure the simple things and family despite living in a large house, and it shows with how he describes his home after 16 years.
Dam house needs a lil work
Something jumps from the trunk of that Royce in mid interview, it’s the TARANTULA!!! 🕸
If I had a house like this I would never leave my house.
they are soul mates
SO SICK GO VEGAN
2 czubki oderwane od rzeczywistości
His house make me so calm sooo peaceful. Love it.
Love his house is so modern but I love the open design
He is so posh
"Avril Levine" lol
He gives the vibe of "Really don't judge a book by it's cover"
I noticed that his and Kourtney voices are so similar. They both have such a calm, sweet tone.
my man lives in cali and is wearing a latex jumpsuit. bruh do you like to melt?
SWEET
Esse homem tem cara de doente,  Crem Deus pai !!!
Anyone else noticed the plant switch at 5.10? They placed a different plant on the table for the close-ups lol.
His house has a very cosy homey feel unlike kim's
Travis has such a lovely energy about him. His interior architect definitely captured it in the refurbishment of his home.
Who is Kourtney? Hahaha
Just a super nice person.  Good luck to the newlyweds
A lovely person.
Maybe its kinda rude,but i want to share that, once i did unfollow Courtney because she shared photo with Travis.  I didn’t want to see him! But his calm voice & personality make me follow him directly 🤫🤫🤫🤫
I must admit until I just watched this I couldn't see what Kourtney saw in him. WELL I DO NOW!!! He is such a sweet soul. I love how he was constantly talking about his kids and Kourtney. His house is full of things that really mean something to him, not just meaningless stuff. I'm so glad I ran across this. Kourtney is one lucky woman and he is equally as lucky to have Kourtney. They are too cute together!!!
Why is he wearing a garbage bag
Kourtney kourtney kourtney kourtney  It’s all he has to say  He’s favorite word  This is so acted ..!!  Ridiculous
1) Monocrome Supervision to inspired me of HOME DECOR. 2) Skull! Finally I know how to decor something with skull everywhere. 3) Supervision car in black ever. And driving motorcycle in the end of the video is so fantactic ending.
The way he went through and named everyone's seat but just so loving sweet I dont know lol.
How he caresses Kourtneys leg😍😍😍😍😍
Zen 🙏🏻
He has a beautiful soul! I'm not a fan of the kardashian media image, but I hope he normalizes the family.
I'm impressed with this man! Wow
Beautiful house! Look at the home and it tells you alot about the people living in it
what a sweet man!
Beautiful home.  He seems that such a nice laid back guy. I can see the love between them. Seems real. Wishing them happiness.
His energy is way calmer than I imagined….like even his voice
Travis Braker is dope, The Kardashians are not.
I am not a fan of Kourtney, but Travis is much more thoughtful and articulate than I was expecting. As many others have said, it is surprising.
Love your vibe.God bless u & Kourtney
Okay but the fact that his house is so simple, only has 4 cars, and drives himself everywhere is honestly the most humbling thing. I was honestly surprised by his simplicity- was not expecting that. I was expecting his house decked out with Renaissance-gothic vibes lol
I need a matcha station
This man has a pure soul i believe. He is so calm and seem so gentle. And the house is amazing really
I have always liked Travis & I love that he & Kourtney have found each other to spend the rest of their lives together:)❤️🙏
I hate travis barker with my entire heart n soul
As an interior designer I love that he mentioned his interior designer and appreciates the work put into remozeling his home 😊
I like that his home was a home, it felt very relaxing and personable. I understand why Courtney would go for him because he’s just a chill guy and he is a family man.
He is really intelligent!!...he should have a vlog -i could listen to him all day #forever
He has a nice voice.
Why do celebrities open their homes to AD for a tour and then require them to blur out their art? The art is such an important part of the design. The obvious conclusion is that they are concerned about theft, but unloading art is difficult. Their clothes (which Travis shows off when he gives a tour of the amazing closet) are WAYYYYYYY easier to steal and sell. And if you don't think homes get burglarized for designer/rare clothing, I've got news for you---happens all the time. Those musical instruments are also far more of a target than the art hanging on the wall. C'mon, AD, let us see the whole design, not just part of it.
Is no one gonna talk about the candle in his bedroom
“The house is just under 10,000 ft.²” said in a casual, doesn’t everyone have that voice.
Seriously in every room, this man said he loves having the fireplace on 😂😂  He’s such an amazing guy!
He seems a really nice & calm guy -
Travis is so cool.
Very good family man and looking! 👍👍 You both are right to each other, perfect match! ❤️❤️
I'm not being funny, but he looks around 70 years old. He will not age well.
I didn't know much about Travis, but now I am a fan.
I’ve admired Travis ever since Meet the Barkers, his calm energy despite what many may think is what has always been my fav.👍🏽  This home is goals!  Love the fact that instead of moving, just remodel and keep the memories.🤍  Thanks for sharing!
I love his voice 🥰
I've never heard his voice and didn't expect a calm voice
That was the coolest house tour I've ever had!
It's hard to watch someone who looks like they just got out of a german concentration camp.  I hope his veganism is "saving the planet" because it sure in the hell looks like it's killing him.
turning the fireplace on.. most american thing i've ever heard/seen
Then it must be nice to live off dead Woman’s death money. You know that’s what they’re known for their work they are only know because of Nichols Death because of their father
looks straight outta pottery Barn band the like 🤷🏾‍♀️
Hes all about kourtney
He's the man he got a couple Kardashian in the sack I bet you Scott is going crazy right now
he's got way better taste than his family-in-law
Okay he gets the award for best kitchen cabinets for sure
I love you guys
Omg i luv his house style its like what i want a very minimal vibe plain colours nothing drastic
A little bit of shoes... Shows about 100 pairs of shoes 😆
Beautiful home. Very tasteful and delicate…the vinyl jumpsuit…not so much 🤢
I think this house belong kourtney's first husband
I really like his calming aura and how he turned a house into HOME for his family, especially for his children. I can see how much he loves them by the way he's talking and trying to build memories in this home!! 👏👏👏
He seems like such a genuine person and really soft hearted.
He seems like a nice guy.. But the tattoos on he’s face makes him look evil.  Kort when from a normal looking men to this….    But he seems like a nice guy.
what is blurred on the bar? and why did they blur the painting behind the bikes?
Pause at 12:55 ...  sweet home Alabama
They seem compatible. God bless~
Meh, beige beige beige beige off white off white  blah 😑
Wtf is he wearing
Hes sweet and calm ,, far from the way he looks,, thought hes some kind of crazy guy ,, just like other celebrities,, but hes so humble and affectionate and kind ,,,im like bewitched instantly👍
Got a migraine from his abundant use of "like" so I turned off the audio
Que buen gusto....preciosa casa!!!
You know God damn well a Kardashian isn't moving into that hovel.
Travis barker has a very calming voice and I can understand agree he wanted a zen home something minimalistic to his home.
I love this ❤
I won't even lie.. I wasn't a fan of him because of those darn tattoos.. But listening to him speak... how calm he sounds is everything.
Im happy for yous keep on showing love for one other
Very minimal.  Definitely a stress free environment.  He’s easy going.  Style matches his vibe.
Just by the way he touched her, I know he's a big freak!!! and Kort loves it hahaha
Lovely home
the shoes on the counterrrrrrr😖😖😖
Travis baker is cool af 💯
Who's getting AIDS with his junkie face?   TRAVIS BARKERS
I like Travis he really seems like he has a special soul ~ his house tour no no no only this is only my opinion but I like homes that have personality, all the white walls and no art on the walls I would die and run out of the house..... I could never stay in an atmosphere like that of course I know he likes it and that's what's most important but I like homes with character I like homes that are full of meaningful objects and plants and little waterfalls etc..... This home has no character 😒☹️
no offence, but its giving ikea
His looks : 💀☠️ His personality: 🌻✨🌞💗💝
lol
This smells like kourtneys orgasm..I’m dying 😭😭
I see why she married this guy.  He is so stable and calm.  Cute too.  He has an attractive vibe about him.
the amount of people who don't know him lmao drummer of blink182 and was always on mtv
Like like like like like
love his style
Yes organic mariguana mattress
Its basically a mix of Kim's and Kourtney's house. Nice.
The bedside candle 👀👀👀👀
Ad should do Tom cruise house.
His tone of voice matches his home. So relaxing. Good job Kourtney, you needed peace. 🫶🏻
He really doesn’t love himself in a healthy way but he like to project all the control on the external environment 😂
Fantasticó - I love deco n Kort led me here- love love love 💕
Was good till the Kardashian showed up
I love him!!  He seems to be an authentic person!
He is completely different than I expected him to be. Very tranquil and deep. I never realized he and Kourtney had been together for a long period.  Wish them much 😊 🙂 happiness.
You folks need to change your video thumbnail design. For the first week of these videos coming up in my feed, I thought it was an advertisement based on the "AD" being below the title in the thumbnail. I only JUST realized this is not an ad for "Open Door" and is actually celebrity house tours, lol. Your designer needs to take a few courses.
His home is nice & homey but what the heck is he wearing?😂😂
What a lovely home and a really nice guy!!
I see Pink Floyd: The Wall, Operation Ivy, Purple Rain(I think), Dr. Dre The Chronic 1, but u can’t make out the last record on his painting, The blue one? But I love the fact Op Ivy is one of those records lol that’s awesome, I love this dude.
I am not sure if I have just watched an AD video or just a glimpse from a reality show. Who the hell cares which kid sits at which seat. Who the hell care about what he got from Kourtney and what he did not. Nice home, but came here for the unique style and design, which is lets be honest, there wasn't really any. If the owner has to show the closet and cars u know u wont see AD, just an MTV Cribs episode.  I am not saying he is not, but its ridicoulos that if a celeb speaks nice in a video which was obviously directed and planned, the fans go mad that how niiiiiiiceee that person is. Gosh. No surprise why the trash celebs rule US. So easy to applause, fascinate you.
Bro where  is the chair for Tom ?
She’s so lucky 😍 he’s an amazing soul ❤️
He’s a proof of the quote “dont judge the book by its cover.”  Kourtney saw this side of him that other people dont.
Im so in love with Travis!
Got to listen to some Blink 182 after that calming house tour.
his voice is very calming
He so calm, he seems so lay back and earthy! I like his vibe!
Can I record my music in ur studio, sir🤪🤪😂
Travis seems like such a sweetheart!!  I love his voice and gorgeous blue eyes! <3
VERY NICE AND TRANQUIL JUST LIKE HIS VIBE IS. i love the trust he put into the home designer because it came out beautiful!
Calm guy
Was that where your xwife lived
Where does Kourtney work.
Please can someone explain to me why some art pieces were blurred is it like copyright thing ?
2 full tables with bunches of chairs and a big couch and Kourtney was sitting on the kitchen island... okay 🤣
wondering if the kardashian generation knows about his importance as a musician. blink 182 was one of my favorite bands in the 2000s and i always loved travis
He does not age
Ilike him, he seems so down to earth..not pretentiois!
I love him 🥰😍
I wanna see the dogs
Wow!  I'm glad I saw this. This is embarrassing,  I only know of  Travis because of the Kardashian konnection .   Love the fact he's been there for 16 years, stability and humble also. I feel better about kortneys choice for her husband now.  Travis- your home is beautiful. 🕉
Adored 🥰
Wow I just find it disgusting that they want to show off’ what they have while everyone is struggling through this economic crisis 🤢
Some ppl may think he and kourt is cringe and shows too much pda and such, but im kinda feeling what they feel rn with my bf and let me tell you, telling your so you love him everyday is just not enough! I feel u kourt!
i feel like travis mite do a bruce jenner the way hes sounding
He is so damn sexy and his voice so calm and soothing I can imagine he makes good love to Courtney 😂👌🏽😅😍
What you get when you sell. . . . . out.
Strange boring dude
WOOOOOOOW✨ HE IS ✨IRIE✨ AND ✨COOOOOOOOL✨ ✨WOOOOOOW ✨
I could've done a much better job. He's so phony
Not that impressed why doesn t Kardashian get dressed??
R u serious. It's so boring inside. Needs a Decorator
It’s not surprising to me that he’s sensitive and well-spoken? Look at all the rockers, kurt, Chester, Kate Bush, loads of them have great big hearts.
I like Travis he gives me a vibe of how a retired psychopath would be like.
Kourtney acts like a little immature goth chick. Teeheehee I'm drinking your famous matcha. He makes the best matcha. Show them your little matcha set up. All they do is suck face. In other videos Penelope asked them to stop french kissing. Show some respect towards your children.
Wow, this house is amazing!!! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT.
Anyone count how many times he said “like”?
Oh my God I'm so in love with Travis he's very soft spoken he's very sentimental I would never thought that oh my God he's an overall great guy I'm so happy for Courtney she deserves him.
Theres something about him speaking that is so calming. Normally I just play this in the background but I watched this whole thing. Love it.
Dudes energy is peaceful as hell
His home 🏡 or her home 🤭
Lol😂😂😂.. my first bike was a BMX Bike it was black with the black and white checker foam going across the handle bar 🤣 best bike ever!!
Is a home of kourt, he don’t hace any interest
If I'm not mistaken, he did a MTV Cribs episode
I lie Travis kourtney is the perfect example of have patients do rght don’t settle cuz eventually what’s for you will find you i so don’t kno these ppl I could be wrong but from his energy alone these two are meant to be it’s crazy how u can be happy for ppl u kno know but I truly am it’s like they balance each other what girl doesn’t want that or man as well
Minimal, but not cold.  This was unexpectedly sweet.
Waouhh nishimiye kukumva uvuga😊. Imana iguhe imigisha
The fact that he doesn’t fear fire is admirable!
i feel like all that's missing is a love live laugh ornament tbh
Travis Barker says "slacks"!
travis is just like kourt
He is so calm and kourtney’s gift is really thoughtful
Travis your next endeavour has to be ASMR ! You have such a relaxing voice ❤️
This just goes to show how u should never judge a book by its cover. Don't judge someone before getting to know them. ✌
He’s a joke
No wonder Kourtney fell in love with Travis, he's adorable 🥰
did anyone else see his cushion move randomly by itself on the bed 😂
My goodness I wasn't expecting that 🤣 he has a very calm pressence I can see why she fell for him and this is the first video I've every seen of him.
Lovely home 🏡
scott disick punching air rn
Give me a show w/ this same premise and 'hosts' where they get a pie in the face right as they open the door to brag about their material possessions... I'd watch every single one.
The fact that people expected him to be a certain way says a lot about how people judge others by appearance.
i get the feeling he doesn't like pillows lol
Really enjoyed this one. Feels like a home 🏡
Nice 👍
This is a home,very niece.Hope they make it.
Tqm Travis
he has his preferences and individual style, respect
Love his vibe
FONTANAS VERY OWN
Why does he look like her ex husband?
I'd rather be broke living in a trailer than look like this mess
Yeah bro..
It was classy until he added a Kardashian to it!!
Your home is stunning!!
Que hermoso hombre
I love Travis❤️ so down to earth and so sweet... I love him and Kourt together...
His closet looks like a department store! 🌹 He gives off beautiful vibes!!! Awesome home.
Travis the whole video: yeah and this I got it from Kourt, that couch I bought it with Kourt, this is Kourt’s spot on the table, that corner kind of reminds me of Kourt, oh and here’s Kourt I put her in the kitchen this morning😍
i absolutely love this home it gives such good energy
Vegan people never look healthy..he is too skinny
all their houses look the same. he seems sweet though
I like you travis but this straight up looks like blank ikea furniture vomited on everything. 0 taste or uniqueness.
Stunning.
Rick Owen's home is one of the best homes I've seen.
She’s turned him into a Tool
I like this guy, very beautiful person
No helmet on his bike
Every woman needs a Travis barker lol
STUNNING
Cool
love the furniture and great vibe, love the art pieces but I would actually have all the same pieces except three times as big. luv oversized paintings. dont love too many white walls. magic wand.... double the size like Harry Potter lol
His energy is amazing
why is no one talking about the scented candle on his bedside table 😭
Such a random couple hopefully it lasts
I got her a candle 3 yrs ago for Christmas and it's still in her closet, in bags🤣🤣🤣
Vegan food 🌱🌱🌱💚💚💚🙌🙌🙌 I love you even more!!!!!
so clean all people want clean house that real human
Good Men.
He’s real chilled !
Anyone else see the candle that said “smells like Kourtneys orgasm” nope, just me? Okay😂💀
I’m not a fan of the Kardashians, but I’ve seen things with her and Scott and I also watched the show of Travis and his ex-wife. Those were like watching square pegs trying  fit in round holes. I know a lot of people may not see it, but this two fit together. It seems to me these two speak each other’s love languages and I truly wish them a lifetime of happiness.
I don't know why I thought his house will be more goth, but this is nice also
man I miss blink 182 and u young uns wanna see something class? look up Travis playing the drums to "crank that" by soulja boy.
Your really starting to make Scott look bad 😁
Family stability is awesome 👌 I need a good "pre owned" CADILLAC!
wow. i love his vibe & how he talks about him and kourt.
it looks fake
100:01:91
33:32:19
Sophisticated and classy.  He seems calm and soft-spoken🤔.   I thought he was a punk rock FREAK!!!😂😂  I am pleasantly surprised!
Of course he said AD you really think Travis got time to say architectural digest nahh it’s trav
I Luv that home, little furniture and decor, he's simple and classic 💀
Kourtney looks so much like Kris
He looks like he just escaped prison damn
if you look for something without kardashians.............and then.....
It looks like kim’s style 😳
freaks
So healthy 😳
Cool
Wow I think Travis is very down to earth...his home is homey not over the top very cool..I'm surprised..
Can’t believe this is the dude from the Aquabats
I hope he and Kourt stay together till their old and gray ❤️❤️I Love them together...they truly complete each other 🤗
When you’re so rich that people let you wear a leather garbage man outfit.  The emperor’s new clothes.
Nobody talking about the candle on his bedside table
Her sitting up there looks ridiculous.lol
Beautiful home god bless all of you. You work hard for you money enjoy it
https://youtu.be/LGeLsM4iTcc
House and cars are nice. But that monogrammed trash bag jump suit is ??? 😩
I like how he did the minimal style because it’s not boring looking
So unexpected. He seems truly centered. Beautiful home.
All I see between him and Kourt is peace. She's my favorite Kardashian. So real
His voice is so soothing, makes me want to listen to him talking. He seems like a down to earth person, caring, sweet, and very soft spoken, no wonder Kourt fell for him. What I like most about him is his relationship with his kids, such a good father!
pasty looking freakazoid
honestly so happy for them. people said their pda is too much but if we were to put the jealousy aside, it's really awesome to be kissed and hugged and showed love all the time! #goals
“Lebron didn’t come and Pick it up”
So Cool!! Love Him!🙏❤💕💯‼️ @drum Travis
I love how Kourt just appeared suddenly😂😂😂they’re so cute and chill together…
Wow i was expecting a funky ambiance looking house. He's neat
I love to hear him talk..he's very calming. 😍 I see why Kourtney loves him...he seems kind and sweet,  Serene..Anybody feel me? 🤗
I love his voice!
He seems like a mature man, sadly most men these days are very immature so very cool.
Soft spoken
gross looking dude looks like a plastic action figure
The vibe i got from him is sooo calming & pure. Loved him
Beautiful home. The candle killed me 💀
He is so chilled..... Delicious vegan food, vegan hot dogs...🥰 thanks for that Travis🙂
His voice is so calming
👍🏻
His voice is very soothing, I could listen to it all day
What a humble man he is.. He is great
I will love to see more of this family ☺️❤️
This home looks sterile and absolutely soul-less. Home of dead beauty.
I was sold at Matcha Station!
Bem legal.
I love the old rolls
Ill take the rolls hell yea
Sweet house..omg that buick 😂 sorry but i remember those cars in cal on that year..lol
Eww i grew up in la and as a teenager begged my mom for a trianchla and my cat let it out lol
Im so freaking jealous of your closet and vintage shirts love it
Lol i want that bed
Nice movie room 👌 i bet you had some crazy fun times 😂
I like the design of your home..where is it located?Hollywood hills? Beverly hills?
Sweet glasses
Sweet love the white bike
With all the tattoos I was expecting spooky stuff but is simple and nice. I really feel ashamed of myself for judging him cus of his full body tattoo. He's absolutely different frm what i thought, he sounds calm, gentle, focus and family oriented.
Omg! He's actually a real nice cool eazy going guy, I'm wasn't expecting 😍
Travis is a very calm and chill human being. make no mistake tho he is very much a stone cold rocker!
House is merely a structure. Home is relationship among occupants nhofwiw
Beautiful house. I love this style. And, he seems to be a nice guy.
The way Kourtney hyped him up and was like omg babe show them your little matcha station was so pure
“I’ve never heard Travis speak” these are all kardashian fans. Did you ever watch a blink 182 interview or a Travis barker interview? Please stop showing Kourtney. If you want a kardashian, throw Kim in there. They had a fling anyway.
Pettibon. I'll have to check that out.
If you’re going to show Travis Barkers house can you please not have Kourtney there. Talk about annoying in every way. There’s a reason why people love Travis and hate Kourtney. Because she tries way too hard and isn’t even a good person.
How does he reach the top cupboards?
I saw him interviewed some years ago and he seemed so nice. He does again here, he has a HOME not a house. The fact that he's had it for so long says a lot about him, also that he mentions his kids so much. He's lovely
Kourtney have agreat man by her side goodbless to you travis
I liked what I saw ! Courtney is there ; she needed a man like him . I wish them good luck and love ❤️
He is really soft spoken, lay back and treasure things that Courtney give to him. So sentimental I love it.  I'm so happy for Courtney.  Beautiful home❤️
"Travis is so chill and Mellow he's mad real, I love his vibes!!!!!" "Wishing Travis and Courtney Much Love!!!!!"♥╣[-_-]╠♥
I'm am speechless, this has to be the best home, not house but HOME in America!!! Just watching the video it brought a calm over me. I can see why he lives there!!!
I'm am speechless, this has to be the best home, not house but HOME in America!!! Just watching the video it brought a calm over me. I can see why he lives there!!!
That is why u don't have to always judge a book by it cover
Is it REALLY necessary to have your half naked girlfriend sat on a kitchen countertop?
Aka kourtney helped make it over
10:35 NOT THE KOURTNEYS ORGASM CANDLE UNUSED
That’s just like, under 10k feet LOL
He seems like such a put together, calm, kind, and sophisticated person. Really a good soul.
Indeed. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder ❤️👏
I want that skull pull lamp <3
I can say this is my favourite celebrity house. It is so nice and calming. It gives you a sense of serenity. I expected his house to be full glam or something but its damn beautiful. Good job to the designer. Perfect home for me <3
It's adorable how associates memories with certain pieces furniture..
I love how he left the house which has a lot of memories it’s always hard for me to leave my house or move because of all the good memories I had. He so simple and I respect that. Such a beautiful house.
Does he want to get robbed? He is literally telling all the robbers in LA what they can go steal.
The Gnostics humble celebrity
Nothing weird about this guy at all, haha, koncentration kamp chique with a kartrashian handler, they wanted his children probably, next.
Kourtney got lucky with this one
now i realized why kk fall in love with this man
He literally turned into a kardashian, even has the same stuck up voice they used, sounds gay also 😅😂😂
I'd love to just chill in his studio, bounce musical ideas off of each other and see what happens.   I love how grounded and sensible he appears to be. Seems very grateful for his life.
He is super cool and seems very kind.  He has great taste, and this home is so inviting  and beautiful.
so lovely home
Idk he seems like a nice guy but also like my childhood got crashed 😅
He is so sweet 🥺 His energy is surprisingly calming for a drummer! ☺️
Vegan food and that leather one piece. Tf is wrong with people when they get money. Dude is a weirdo
Nice house, family house 😍 I love it
But he moved there for Kim 🤡
Looks like people are watching Travis Barker speak for the first time. Yeah, he is a well-mannered dude. Just give him a drum set and then see, lmao.
That family is making some really weird unions though 👀😒 does she even appreciate bands like Bauhaus lol....I really doubt it
i have judged Travis by his creepy looks and his way too much clingy behaviour towards Kourtny but as an individual his choice is great
How can his voice be so calming????
That Grand National though! Dope
I really love how humble he is. He just seems so grateful for everything, like he really appreciates every moment and doesn’t take anything for granted. love that sm
Travis, bring Tom DeLonge back to blink-182!
Love Travis and his kids.  It’s awesome, that he’s had the house for 16 years.  He’s given his kids such great stability.  He seems humble and kind.  Lovely home; hope he keeps it forever.  What awesome memories for his babies.
kourtney ur so insecure what on earth r u doing marry this freak, cantu meet a better looking dog 👹👹👹👹👹👹👹💩
YAY AREEEEEAAA YouTu.be/PuOlF7d7k70
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
Kary Mullis
His way of speaking is completely soothing!!
He is very eloquent...
I'm in love with travis.
Thats whats up positive love ....n congrats brother u been around for so long .....keep it going .....#TB...#BT...stay safe n blessed
I guess, as someone who doesn't quite care about the Kardashians, but who grew up with late 90's pop punk, it's just really bizarre to see Travis like this. I'm not judging, it's his life and I'm now onto different music. I just never thought he would be the one to sell out to this kind of life.
There’s no way that’s under 2k sqft 😂
He's hella soft spoken hahaha...
what a need for kourtney to be there semi naked on the kitchen island??? this couple make me feel  so much cringe 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮😬😬😬
the pool is amazing
this is the perfect example of not juding a book by it's  over <3
Travis and Courtney are fantastic couple forever together and fantastic home
Thank you 🙏 for sharing your a lovely young man so talented I wish you blessings for you and your beautiful wife Courtney and both of your sets of beautiful kids! Love ❤️ from Cabo 🥰
You didn’t show the revolving door this woman has and how many men have walked through it.
Travis's energy is super chill. Also, can we have a moment for stitch in the closet haha
His voice just soothes my soul
He is a cool dad, I mean apart from his tattoes and being a band guy for years..I am surprise with his esthaetic taste, its so refine and he surely had a good taste. I am  curious that after he married one of the kardhasian there will be a reality show about it, like "Keeping Up with Barker and Kardhasian" but I like the way they decide to hv the joy and everything else for themself..I think Kourtney deserve it.
I can’t believe he’s 46
How is this man so ZEN? Oh my god I aspire to be so calm.
✨VINAGE T-SHIRTS✨
Almost 50 and Travis sounds like a teenage boy. "and then it was like... and like....chill and like... (starts stomping*) and like, this table and like...the vibe and like..."  I wonder if he's just nervous and like excited and like bored and like never grew up. lol These are the people we look up to....and like.   Please.
so no ones is going to talk about the candle
wheres all the cattys
artistic minimalist.. very nice.
U can not judge a book by its cover. I really expect med a dark gothic ambiance in his house.  However, I taken aback by the modernistic appeal of his home
This dude is one of the coolest guys around
Don't judge book by it's cover 😅  Well same like punk rock singer do sing song like that but their fans do represent them as their appearance than singer themselves 😂
He looks like a good man. Keep each other safe. Congratulations
i love this vibe so simple. neat and says about how he is as a person. his voice sounds so relaxed. Wow
What a soft, beautiful, intellectual soul.
Wonder why he doesn’t drink coffee anymore 🤔
he's such a dad and family man and i'm here for his chill vibes
This a modern day version of mtv cribs
I love it so perfect and paceful
Beautiful Travis 🤩🤩🤩
It's weird to think that Travis Barker has a kitchen.  Celebrities, they're just like us.
Never did i think bro would listen to NLE Choppa
He sounds like a Kardashians
it's really nice but where are the colors???
All i can say is what a Warm House... this is rare to find in a world where everyone want to own fancy things in their houses.... This house is very special i love it so much 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I like travis but he scares me sometimes
I like it, but was expecting something more artistic, original and different, it just looks like other houses I’ve seen in Calabassas.
So we’re gonna just brush past the name of that candle?? 😭😭
"my aesthetic is minimal..." *is covered head to toe in tattoos*
You can tell Kourtney really upgraded her husband. First time I hear him. This guy is awesome.
This, THIS IS A HOME❤️
He has such a calm vibe love this home too
His home is gorgeous, but his look..Oh Lord. He looks like someone in his late 50.
Normal ppl don't have just Mills in the bank, a movie theater and 10 cars in the garage like I said I'm gonna be a hater for a sec
I'm really really sorry but I'm gonna be a hater for a sec. But I just hate how almost all stars try to pretend like .     We're sooo normal.   Your not..no matter how much you try
They’re really so good together love Travis such a sweetheart and kourt is so in her element . I’m so glad she’s finally found a man to marry her
Bro what is he wearing, he looks ridiculous!
💀💀💀💀
Does anyone else see the pillow move at 10:58? I think someone's hiding in his bed.
Travis, pls drop your matcha recipe!!!
Best house tour ever
His voice is so soothing 🥹
👀...👍🔥😎👍🔥
I love how you updated the pool area from the jungle theme you had on Cribs
Besides the fact that this house - at 10,000 sqft - was a downsize, he’s surprisingly down to earth lol
I like that hes been there for 16 yrs. I think hes a good dude. And the way he loves his SO's is intense interesting and very sweet i just watched a few of his videos with he & his ex...hes definitely a lover thats for sure. Lol
Can these two please start their own reality show?? 😍😍😍
read my name
I strongly recommend you guys watch a video about how people from Oaxaca,Mexico live after watching this… 😉
He was involved in an airplane crash in which only few survived , he was burnt very , very badly . He never travelled by flight after that accident until Kourtney came in his life and supported him and travelled with him everywhere by flight and helped him to overcome his fear of flying , he still relive those scary moment but is in a far better place than he was , he is a beautiful soul and  behind those tats are badly burnt marks and he went under tons of surgery too. I wish them both a beautiful life ahead together and forever .
I loved this tour. He really went all out and gave us a lot of personal detail! I don’t like the home tours where people show us very little and say very little.
Nice home and nice personality 👌
Me waiting for the car collection👀👀👀
anyone notice the candle?? ahahahah saying " This smells like Kourtney's orgasm 🤣
Love this place, great style.
A lovely warm and inviting home just like it’s owner! I’m sure this is why you Travis feels so relaxed in it. I’m impressed with your family values and the beautiful difference you have made in Kourtney’s life! All the very best with your life together! 🙏🏻🙏🏻👍👍❤️❤️
When I was younger, I used to watch meet the barkers and I remember how I used to think wow he’s such a stand up dad! And he really is still a badass mofo!
Travis Barker seems so cool. I like how mellow and calm he is. I love his style as well. He comes across very humble. It's refreshing to see a celeb who isn't contrived. His house is so beautiful and homely. I love the minimalist look - it's my taste. Travis and Kourtney seem so in love. I'm wishing them all the best.
I get it but dude he looks like a true vampire
I love this home.  Travis sounds like a great guy, listening to him speak like everyone said he is very calming.
Is no one gonna speak about him being "minimal" but having like a thousand tshirts
MTV Cribs.2
Looks hardly  lived in and the furniture doesn't seem cozy. Celebrities and there love for a museum type home is trippy.    Still nice tho. Would of loved to see some roses or colorful vase or a red apple somewhere.
Like the aesthetic ^_^ Awesome, Congratulations!^_^
Hey you all I wish I knew this when I was younger but I have to share this with you that : hey darling you yes you....I have good news. The greatest love story ever told in history includes you! Jesus Christ  loves you that’s how special you are to Him.He is real.He sacrificed Himself so that you could be with Him forever in Heaven. You are so loved!If anyone rejects you disappointed you His love is unfailing and real it never ever changes regardless  of your mistakes. God Defines His Love For You. God’s love is far superior than mankind’s love. It is deeper, broader, higher and completely fulfilling. It’s a Great Love!His love is greater than all your sin. Jesus Christ is ready to forgive you today if only you will accept His love. It’s a Saving love.  God is not the problem. He is the solution! God went far beyond declaring His love for you. He proved it beyond a doubt. Never has there been a greater demonstration of love than the sinless Son of God dying for sinful man. You have nothing to offer God that He needs. You have no way of earning your way to Heaven. All the good Do you believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross to pay for your sin, was buried, and rose again? Will you believe on Jesus Christ today and accept Him as your Savior? In faith believing in your heart that He will keep His Word, ask Jesus to forgive you now. You can pray something like this: ”Dear Lord  Jesus, I confess that I am a sinner and that I deserve to pay for my own sin in Hell. But I don’t want to go to Hell. Today, I accept you Jesus as my Lord and Saviour. I believe in my heart that you died on the Cross to pay for my sin and rose again from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sin and take me to Heaven when I die. I am trusting you alone as my Saviour and you alone are God. Thank you for loving me and saving me from my sin. Amen.” If you asked Jesus to save you today, let me know so that we can get you more information to help you live the exciting and abundant Christian life. Salvation is the beginning of a brand new life for you in Christ. He will never leave you, nor forsake you!michelle.stokesy@gmail.com  we would love to hear from you email us !!!
man replaced his hair with tattoos , to hide baldness!
OMG! he's like the female version of Khloe, esp the way he speaks
Love this 😍
Join the SQUAD https://youtu.be/umwNrZSU5y0🔥
👎
Lovely stylish practical home.  Beautiful exterior, pool & garden.
Beautiful home filled with happy memories
He's very HUMBLE👏
lol lol
ironic. a man who survived 70 % body burns ... loves fireplaces . hmm
This house is beautiful
The way he was talking about the bed is the same speech I give about my bed 😆
his skin is in fair every single day.
So it is big, so what! It’s all for the furniture, appliances and objects. How much it is for the residents? Not much! Lol, How silly people waste so much time earning the things that they seldom use! Wasting life. What is the value of the life? By the end, he would feel empty and lost!  We will see…
Travis is such a dear ❤️
Another Meet The Barkers movie lol
Thank you for sharing your beautiful home and congratulations on your engagement praying all  continues to go well.🙏
Ok...So..I love this crib! Beautifully done. Although I've not been there, it feels as though I have. We forget sometimes it's the memories good or not so good that makes a home. Not to mention, Travis is one hell of a drummer.
He is the personification of "dont judge a book by its cover". He is such a gentle soul. Now I understand why Kourtney fell in love with him. Also, such a wonderful tranquil warm welcoming home.
He ist perfect for Kourtney, and for me!!!😛 good vibes... beautiful House!!!!!!!
My man a Pyro lol
his home is so beautiful
I really don’t think any of these are real and seeing the artists gas up the fake decor and making up stories is hilarious
gorgeous home..very warm and cosy with all those wonderful fire places
Was Travis always a vegan or did he change for Kourtney?
Travis.... loves himself, can be romantic, eats right, talks a lot.... I see why Kourtney likes him
Do they live together now? Or no?
This is literally perfect
I am a little bit sad. There is nothing about blink182 in his house..
His house is so calming , didn't expect that
hes definetly been in love with her for years
im so jealous of kourt. she has a real catch! his house Is beautiful!
I want that matcha recipe 🤔🤔🤔
And they try to say Lebron is cheap 😂 scam
Omg the Grand National 🥰
If I had a “Like” for every time he said “Like”, I would have a lot of “Likes” 😂
Good lord. I have an old car that doesn't run. I can't afford to fix it. Life is strange. You either have alot or  a little
This was more content and modern then what we all were expecting.
Did he share this home with his last family???
He’s such a wonderful loving person…
His calmness is everything.
I love that his home actually looks lived in. Most of these towards the homes almost look fake because everyone try thing is perfectly untouched. You can tell this has been his home for 16 years
October 17th is my birthday
He's such a kool guy love the home
Wow u cannot judge a book by its cover ae not my style of house too large & far too much cleaning it's a No for me
Soo happy for u ex wife jealous she crafty Aries
Awww he loves her❤️
I am so happy for Kourtney she scored a good one.
Is nobody going to talk about the candle??
So he will be destroyed in 10…9…8. Dude you married a kardashian….do you still have your balls?
lol you dummies love anything.
Everyone wants love like these two 🥰🥰🥰🥰🙏
Lost all respect for Travis marrying that thing.
Once he said we eat vegan and sleep on an organic bed I knew he was the right one for kourt lol. That’s literally her type of guy. And he seems sooooo chill. Very calming I’d assume.
imagine having sex on a bed that vibrates…wow!
Alot of these celeb homes are very cold and boring. But his looks warm and cozy. Nice job. Beautiful without being pretentious.
I love this house so much. It’s very tasteful.
"I really love these chairs, that is like where I sit when I come in here"
I find him so unattractive what does she see in him
He speak like an very authentic kardashian
being poor sux
Don't judge a book by its cover 😍😯
okay I love how calm his energy is
Absolutely God awful outfit but seems like a chill dude
Oh my geerrrsh I was seriously expecting such KK you win. 💕👏🎉
Why does he say "my" instead of "our"? Hmmm. Celebrities just weird me out. I think they all are narcissistic.
Now trash bags are fashionable??
Crazy Courtney look soooo much like her mom!
His house actually feels very homey
Too many fireplace
ZZzzz
Good video 👌
He seems like a really chill and cool guy. No wonder Kourtney is so smitten w/ him.
Wack jobs!
Idiot
His voice could put me to sleep
Awesome video ! I learned so much about travis and the house was a vibbeee❤️
If he say “just like” or “so this is my” im like fina so…lose it 😂😂😂
Jesus Christ loves you https://youtu.be/F2TSJgDh2tA
I use to have the biggest crush on him… he still sexy to me tho.. I love how chill he is
That house is about as exciting as Travis Barker is entertaining.  Talk about zero personality.  Apparently Courtney is looking for ratings.  Nothing like a room that feels like a square box. If you can do dry wall from floor to ceiling, you too can design this house...no wonder they were riding motor bikes in the house.
It’s giving MTV cribs
I thought he was a crack head
Very nice Modern Contemporary archtecturally designed home! Enjoy!
One of coolest drummer . Also who said you have to work hard at school ...😉🤘
Iv just found out I need a travis in my life lol… his so chilled and I love it
I can see what kourt loves about him now his so chilled I love it
Beautiful very serene.
I love him after watching this
I love how he pays attention to his fiance. Does he have a brother lol?
I'm surprised in a way but I like your taste & style. The colours too. Obviously I don't have such a posh house, I have a flat, but my livingroom colours are dark grey with copper accessories. I do like my flowers & nik naks, candles.
Beautiful and classy home
All those teeshirts.  Wondering if he’s ever given a thought to real minimalism and given away those silly teeshirts to homeless shelters.  Minimalist?  With all those cars?  Lol, give me a break.  Celebrities haven’t a clue.
One of my fave celebrity homes so far honestly … esp the taste in artwork
Nice to see a normal sized house
Does he have three children? I thought two
I love this, this is the perfect balance. Love him. 🖤🙌🏼

i soooo love this home. it's so cozy. <3 <3 <3 <3
real life Dracula 😃
God blessed him  what all  he have.
I love the house!  Hi skin is also soooooooo smooth, clear & amazing:)
This house is just so cosy and comfy feeling. I’d love to live there myself!😅
So much style and grace. I love that he he keeps slipping in the vegan food, he’s pretty cool.
Anyone gonna talk about the candle in the bedroom? No?
Blink and Travis was my childhood, so good of him to share
Looks can be so deceptive!!! This is the first time I watch him speak and he is so calm, so zen, so mature and gives such good vibes. So unlike Scott Disick. So glad Kourtney married this guy, God bless both of them.
Oh wow his voice sooo sweet and calm unexpected
Beautiful home but wow... that outfit....
Too simple
there is no amount of disinfectant that's going to get a kardashian used minge off the kitchen bench. better to burn it and start again.. lovely design and he's not what anyone would think by his look. having that plane crash was a blessing for him in one way.
Great sketch, so so funny 😂 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Please make a muchdank edit of this video purely just showcasing every time he says the word ‘like’.
it's a nice and great house we wish you the best for all  your family. Thank you for sharing.
Don't forget your helmet!
Travis really loves pillow at home. It’s everywhere.
They are really utterly cringy and the opposite of classy. No money helps here.
Peep his bookcase 🧐
Onde será que ele e Kourtney irão morar?
Why does Atiana sit so far away
Why does Atiana sit so far away?
How do you chill after turning on a fireplace?
Good bless you bless I hope you both be happy
He and kourt are definitely prefect for each other after watching this they both love family and calmness and soft speaking lol and kourt spoil him
A skeleton wearing a trash bag.
What a waste,  I am jelaous5
Travis is so humble and that’s why he was perfect for Kourtney
Travis 😂 you don't come across like you will be afraid of anything let alone a spider.
Very warm house
He's cool. So different from Courteneys first husband. Nice guy. Good they were friends first. Always marry someone who will be your best friend.
Curious….where are they going to be living 🤔
Balling my eyes out In my free housing watching this . I’ll never have a nice life like them and it really hurts
Complete pleasure. Thank you!
I’ve always love Kourtney! I am so happy for my girl it’s such a breath of fresh air. Being loved the right way and by the right person is so rewarding. Did anyone see the candle? “That says this smells like Courtney’s orgasm” lol that was funny. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
He got a chill, beautiful vibe.
Loved this episode, Travis is just so cool
I loved this - until a Kardashian came into frame. gag
Wow sixteen yrs ago alot
I love the way he speaks. He’s so cool.
His voice is soothing asf, lol.
WHO🙄
Omg this guy is so chill and his voice is so calming I love it 😭
Travis is so passive! love the home
Kourtney winning 💯💥
I’ve always loved Travis. He’s always been a beautiful soul in my eyes. I can totally see how he and Kourtney fell in love with each other. Blessings and love to them and their blended family.
This man is so sweet
Their relationship is eerily affectionate
This is so not what I was expecting. Very beautiful, tranquil home. This is the first time I've ever heard Travis speak, he seems like a pretty chill, down to earth guy.
Travis Barker the man that has everything but keeps it so simple! You are truly refreshing and down to earth! More beautiful fond memories in your home! Congratulations 🍾
I see you kourt lol she's like yeah that that man😂💯
Thought Courtney was a Designer...Wonder how she feels he didnt choose her as Designer?
So full of s&*T!
What does Kourtney see in him? He is lame, not good looking, akward, has a body full of tatoos and just lame!
Hes never all there
did anyone saw what l saw on his bed when he was talking about toxic thing on the mattress
Happy for you guys
I really don't like the way he dresses but I love his vibe and his voice, he seems like a really nice and cool person to hang out with and he really seems to LOVE Kourtney !
I freaking love Travis Barker. Always have. Love his spirit. I see why Kourt married him. Love his home. His wardrobe,  his taste, everything. ❤
Kourtney and Travis are goals. However you feel about celebrity, these are two people who love, respect, support, and are wild about each other.
I kinda love him.
He seems nice but how is he so rich? I heard of Blink 182 back in the day - Im from England they had ONE famous song and that was it - nada mas??? How is this dude so rich? His life is perfect.
10:55 the pillows moved
Those tattoos ain’t minimal that’s for sure lol
There ain't nothing to show lol
I Feel like Kourtney win. Travis seems to be good guy even if he is posing as a badguy ☺️ he acts natural, care about the kids. Hope him to be happy
The man loves a fireplace. 🖤🤍
These designers decorate everything the way they want and even change people's personalities by imposing what they think is "cool".  It is a decoration with very expensive objects and furniture, but very simple.  Decorating it yourself, it would be the same thing but 3 times less the value. 😉
Love him
Dude loves his fireplaces!
He loves everything. Including bimbos and several weddings.
Wow, I don’t think I’ve ever really heard Travis Barker speak. I mean, sure I’ve heard his voice, interviews, tv shows, etc…but listening to him, like actually listening to the content of words while he talks about the home where he raised his children??? I bet he’s an amazing dad. He really lived a whole life and I thought he was just a dude who did guest spots on rap songs.
he so humble, I see why Kourtney fell in love with him
Travis seems like a sweet gentle soul.  I wish him and Kourtney much happiness.  It's nice to see.
Kourtney k is glooowing😍
Very cool, I'd love to film a video like this! Maybe one day!
ok AD is just cribs now
Very well represented and detailed home tour i have seen, with a calming voice, definitely not boring. Travis Barker seems like a nice and genuine guy for Kourt.
His voice is soooo calming ughhh
love how the walls with the flooring look it’s almost like there’s no base trim or if it does it doesn’t create a shadow
Beautiful house
Sounds so chill and kind.
Funny how all the comments are like “I didn’t know Travis is so soft spoken”. Shows you who’s never followed Blink-182. Travis is the best!!
I wonder how much he paid 16 years ago comptes to now
Finally kourtney finds someone who love her no matter where they are. Travis is hot love his style , tone of his voice , his thought process. Love them both.
A MAN THAT COULD MAKE MATCHA?!!! YES <3 NO WONDER WHY SHE MARRIED TRAVIS! I WANNA MARRY HIM TOO!
He’s so chill, and humble. I love him for Kourtney 🖤🖤
Literally kourney
Who the hell is Travis Barker???
I had no idea who he was until he started dating Kourtney. That is a lovely home. He seems like a very nice guy.
Team Scott
I think the decor is bland the only thing I like is the damn drums 😂😂
one of the most beautifull and classy home, also he seem so happy and blessed.
Travis is awesome 😎, you did good Kourtney. Wishing the two of you the best ❤️😘.
love ittt
In the beginning I couldn't see Kourtney with him but now I see why!
I fukin loveeeee kravis jajajaj
He's the best person a woman can have.  Kourtney you're the Luckiest ✨✨
So funny to never hear him talk and see his super unique aesthetic and he just sounds like a normal dude lol
He loves his fireplace
Travis Barker on MTV Cribs 2008 much better IMHO
P's drawing of you was so sweet of her to make...and sweet of you to frame along with your other special pictures. She must get her artistic talent from her momma...that skeleton plate is sick! Love seeing that side of her and the awesome things she gifted for you! I still have my 1st Blink poster from high school & my red 182 shirt from seeing you guys on tour with Green Day in Ohio. I am 36 now lol. BEST DRUMMER EVER!! You're such a cool dad/stepdad. What you do have in your minimalistic-styled house speaks volume of you as a person. I LOVE love! Seeing people in love, expressions of love, love languages and so on. LOVE YOU ALL!!
Stopped watching @ delicious vegan food
Listening to him talk is like meditation
I loved Kourtney already and must admit I've missed out on music in a long time in life and didn't know Travis that much. I absolutely love him too now. He is so mad awesome. Him and Kourtney are PERFECT FOR EACH OTHER!!! I love they are vegans and still madly in love. They will be forever...4 eternity I predict. I KNOW!!! They are both just mad awesome. Kings and queens. I have always loved her brilliant mind and knowledge of what she puts in her body and soul, now she has a man who matches her. You guys wedding was a true love and gorgeous celebration of two families uniting. Kourtney your dress and o OMG your veil, but what was inside that dress n veil topped it off. Travis u looked like the awesome beautiful king you are and both your kids are just jaw dropping. Thanks for creating our future kids to be Kings and Queens too. Everybody there was beautiful. Thank u for letting us into your life, it totally reflects how awesome y'all are. Love u guys. I would love for u guys to do a movie. Y'all rock!!!
Bellísima ❤️🤩
SUPER COOL GUY!! MUCH RESPECT, YOU ROCK!!! NEVER QUIT!!!                   🇺🇸💪🌞🏝🍹🤙👍✌❤
Ive never heard travis speak but he's sooo chilled out and the calmess coming from him had me mesmerised. He seems a really lovely guy xx
He’s so awesome!
Love that house!
He’s so calm,like kourt they’re a perfect match ❤
Grounded ,and loving person.
Travis is so talented! I’m definitely a new fan!
Travis has such impeccable taste and he seems such a family man! I loved this video!
He seems waaay more mature than Scott ever
he has explained every single detail in a clear way. well spoken , very calm <3
I really liked his vibe, and loved his vibe!!🤍
I was thinking ‘Hellraiser’
Aww he seems so chill, a vibe. I won’t get as grossed out by him and Kourt making out lol seriously it’s sweet they were friends so long
So punk rock lol
dude looks like a serial killer
I actually like the vibe of his home. It's not ott minimal, where everything is so shiny bare with random sculptures like an art gallery. It's minimal cosy and lived in.
As a teenager I was obsessed with Blink 182, travis has always been one of my favorite people in the world because he's so normal and genuine.
I just concluded that he is a simlple guy that likes to keep his space very clean. So relatable
I like how he speaks!
I still can‘t get over the fact that he is involved with a Kardashian. I mean Kourtney always was my favorite if you could say so bc she seems to see through all the manipulation and mobbing that is going on from her sisters but what is it about rockstars and beautiful women? Can you help me understand that?
Ugly boy but rich
He is so sophisticated when he talks.
She doesn’t need to be there for this. I guess they’re setting up the groundwork for their own reality show..
So shocked his is so calm and very loving person.I guess we judge people with their looks.Very beautiful home he has.
Regards Art Deco https://youtu.be/qCuzWlvHVyY
Such a calm person and he is really down to earth.
I bet they have a fart pod somewhere. A little tube where you fart? Sounds logical to me.
I wonder where you would go to rip a fart??? Weird sanitized atmosphere. It’s soooo bizarre!!!
He might be a alien?? Bizarre.
11:09 why can't they feel the bed😹
Americans are so strange with their pronounciation... Always thought mocha was pronounced with a "k" and it souns like "moka", lol. Wtf is moCHa?
Just from this video I can totally see that he is Kortneys soul mate🤗🫂
Loved seeing this side of him! So calm, grateful, gracious, focused and at peace! & him showing us little things around his house, even years of gifts him and K exchanged.. is simply beautiful! And honestly he’s never been MORE attractive IMO 😍😌 so happy for their families, children and each other!!
This dude is so weird and obviously heavily medicated
seems like a terrific bloke, but what on earth is he wearing??
Travis, you have such a great voice!
I love travis home inside is like old fashion but at the same time it kinda have a luxurious or beautiful view away from people and stuff it look really like a home
Kourtney is in every room he talks about 🤗
The grand national 😩 literally my dream car. Some people give me flack for liking it so much but, i don’t care. It’s so badass and pretty. Really a classic car among classics
this house is actually surprisingly really pretty
Now I wanna see MGK’s house
Scott got nothing on this dope boi 🤷🏽‍♂️😉 kourtney is freaken happy bro just his character as a person ud think his house would be filled with dark demonic stuff only to realize nah bro his energy so angelic and inviting lets not talk about his dope style
Nothing special about this house, but it seems very special to him. I liked the door to courtyard and the outdoor area.
This the same house from his Cribs episode way back in the day?
Not him proposing to her the day they became more than friends #IKTR
This interior is super boring to me. Perhaps tooooo calming
Hopefully when they divorce it won’t be too bad
❤️
Nice guy.
........so this is why Kourtney loves this man ❤️🇬🇧
Such an excellent man,he loves her so much
He used to be handsome :(
So stupid and ridiculous how these people think they're so much above most people and just because they have money makes them better.
Who cares, he's nasty

I like him.
Disgusting people
Holy crap I didn’t know he sounded like that!! He sounds so sweet!!❤️🤭
Travis has been my crush since the late 90s lol.
Is he depressed?  I don't know anything about him.  But I look at his face/ eyes and see someone unhappy.
Thank you for sharing, all that belongs to your private life, but it is inspirational!
REMEMBER WHEN KOURTNEY CALLED KHLOE'S BLACK COUCHES DISGUSTING. "The furniture should be neutral to the floor".... What do you have to say now Kourtney...
What a sweet guy. Seems so chill and easy going. Kudos for Kourtney!
I don't follow celebrities but when video pops up I'll watch it, so I don't know much about celebrities. But is it just me or does Kourtney, even Kim, seem WAY more chill since these men came into their lives? Kourtney is not posing for the camera,  trying to get the best angle and look perfect. She's just at home comfortable with her man, her voice and body language is just "go with the flow" & happier. I noticed that in Kim too. As a woman it's just nice to see ❤️🤷
Such a sweet guy !!! Congratulations on your marriage!!
I know nothing about this man but he seems like such a down to earth caring family man. He has a calm demeanor.
Love his voice, so clear and soft!
Wow… these two really seem like soul mates made for each other. I wonder what   Kourt is going to do with her house
I really like Trav...awww, I wish the best for him & Kourt 😊
Sounds much more intelligent then I thought. Respect
No lie he is a keeper when it comes to a husband men need to take notes he takes the time to remember the cutest smallest details about Kourtney and the kids. She seems more calm with him. Beautiful home 🏡 💕
Loved seeing Travis like this!
I thought his place would be viva la bam style lol
I havent watched this video, nor do I intend to...I just cant comprehend how 8 million people watched this??  WHY would they care??  I'm so confused!  and I'm out!  LOL
He’s talking to Scott when he’s talking about those candles
Good job kourt !
To me it is Boring
A lovely house and home. Feel a bit sad that it'll prob be sold and he'll have to be in a bigger, less cosy house now..
Congrats Travis & Kourt wow what a great amazing fun life you too will have!  Best Wishes & many blessings! The house is exquisite and so enchanting! Love ❤️ the spiritual vibe. The outside reminds me of some homes in Brasil 🇧🇷 Love all the Details & colors so calming and beautiful 🤩
Expectation versus reality so different   Beautiful home 🏡😊😊
I'm in love. What a gentleman. A Kardashian may have won the jackpot.
I think Kourtney and Travis should have their own show! I love their spiritual vibes together!
Travis is a very sensitive guy
He talks about the stuff they got each other years ago. That's because they've been seeing each other sine 2007. Just saying
“I can heat up a tea very quick “ dose he have special powers ?
I like that he still looks kind even with the tattoos
I love how he knows where everyone sits 🤍
I really enjoyed this one. He’s really BIG on vibes in an environment and this definitely fits his aesthetic! Very on point Trav!
Wtf?
Love it, such a good taste
Fabulous home Travis. Congratulations to you and Kourtney. I love love love your vegan!! Melts my heart!! ❤️❤️
Love this! Ty for the tour
He’s changed not bad but like weird
Dang mtv cribs
It’s such an elegant home. And now I want to get a matcha station 🍵 💕
I iam happy 😀 for them booth a big congradesulayshions Ms korney kordishion barker
Not at all my taste but it’s nice.
he looks so rich is he that type of person business
Simple,clean,nice to lives.
Daaaaaaamn, he old
What is the plastic bag that you are wearing....you must be so sweaty.....yiaks
I wonder what they use the vibrating bed for???
what is on his matcha station? I see cinnamon, nutmeg, matcha, cacao.  But what is on those two bigger jars.  And the other jar in back?  Maybe we can all make his famous matcha if we know what he puts in it.
Gorgeous Home.
Kourtney and Travis God bless you and your families. And Congratulations wedding.  Beautiful couple. We love you all. 🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😃
I wonder everyday what it would be like to be this rich
Really don’t judge a book by it’s cover What a nice surprise!! I am a fan now!!!
Tarantula??? Umm ok moving time, pack it up kids!!
Oct 17 is the greatest day I will gladly share it with u both. 💖🤎
someone make a tutorial on how to build this is bloxburg rn
Anyones houses better than Kim’s house 😅
i like this style because it still has personal touches. with all the black
i never heard about him before the Kardashian, he looks weired but sound so simple and humble
labrego
Dude what happened to Travis barker ????what are you wearing bro…
His vibe is golden 🥹💕
Travis is so open , I am soo happy for Kourtney
That is one of the best house tours ever.  Beautiful  Thank you
Mean i looked at him so much fer so long (skulls n tats)but hearing him speak…. Dude ur personality as much as I picked up…. Ur sooooo chill ur energy iz interesting 🖐🏾👏🏾💯 loveeee ur home 🏠
So happy that book said JENNY Savile
What? An actual warm, inviting, home? I'd watch more home tours if they actually looked like homes.
vegan and organic kinda guy him and kort are really a perfect match
A house that actually looks lived in and liveable
Aww the art work of his five favourite albums from Kourtney is a perfect sentimental gift
oh brother this guy stinks
Very nice beautiful home and Travis very sweet kind man his voice very kindness respectful person.  am very happy you and your beautiful family may god bless you all .
I'm not hating but why would your kids need to skateboard and ride dirt bikes in the house? You have a yard.
Wow! Beautiful house ! Not going to lie I wish I had .5 of the space . Live in a 1 bed 4 children two adults… spare me some of that space lol please
Humble
What's the brand of his clothes?
Beautifull And Creative Home Congratulations🌹 🥰👍🏼❤💙
Just wow
I had high expectations of skulls n tatoos haha its actually elegant.  And 16 years is priceless . Go Kravis!
Good luck to him and hope he to continue being such a calm and relax person.So not being destroyed by that  frivolous and trivial kardashian curse
Since Travis and Kourtney are now married, I wonder which house they are going to live in?
I am worried for them like they seriously need to know God
They need to know Jesus !! You… need to know Jesus ❤️‍🔥
Probably not the fanciest celebrity house but definitely feels like a true home. My heart is warm just by watching this tour. He keeps mentioning his family and children. 🥺🥺
His bed side is too cute. My heart is melting 😭❤️😍☺️
Great tour, thanks for sharing!
Why do I see Penelope face In Travis ???
Do one with Jason Schwartzman  please !
I would love to be famous for a talent and buy a house like this but In Atlanta
Watching this has been so delightful. Such a beautiful home. He is so different from what I expected. Seems such a lovely caring family man. And his voice is oddly soothing.
Nice hazmat suit in the beginning.
No way this is the guy who made sicko mode
Who else was suprised at Travis's voice? Idk y i never expected his voice to be so calm an nice😂. He seems a nice person from his design sense
Man, The Kardashians really would be nothing without Kanye. Here Koutney got this guy to remodel his house to look just like Kim's place with the furniture to match...which is all Kanye's taste and style when it comes to Architecture.
i reaaaallyy love this house omg
The portrait 😆 so cute ...he's genuinely a cool dude .
Travis was always a calm sweet guy I remember his first reality show and he was the sweetest husband/father
Travis baker is a delicious human ❤️❤️  The k’s better treat him right
Sweet   Bro, it must be 50 degrees in there. That is the only way you wouldn’t sweat to death in that trash bag……
Y'all did them dirty with the thumbnail
I’m having a de ja vu moment while watching this 😅😂 other than that I really love how in tune he is with his home and his family. It’s refreshing to see this calm, zen side instead of the glamorized side the Kardashians are used to
He sounds 🌈
Certified Rockstar.
ok, so the Perfect Man and the Perfect House DO exist. Did not have any idea TB was like this. Loved this
When they go out to dinner who pays?
He is very intelligent and soft spoken. A genuinely good spirit and extremly nice. I see why Courtney is head over heels with him!
Would I be wrong to say that Kim visited this house and perhaps got that hallway idea for their museum house with Kanye? Also...I don't know why I expected a different voice from Travis lol
Everything was perfect.  I love it!!!
Beautiful home.  Now that they're married , I wander if he is going to sell or keep?
Ok so Kourtney really couldnt wear a pants
Kourtney is a sad excuse for a woman!
WOW I CAN SEE WHY KOURTNEY  LIKES HIM.
You're house is so .so beautiful
❤️
Okay the Price tag. Sickening
Oh no they r going to brag over his home . How much did it cost. Again here we go.
That's some surreal stuff. I love to hate, but I'm having difficulty hating on y'all. That coverall is dope. Space age polymer, RFID, breathable and waterproof. Congratulations 👏.
Crunchiest couple ever
Im sorry who t f is this guy?
Damn this content is sick really unexpected 👍
I love his home...he seem so soft spoken & sweet..."U cannot judge a book by it's cover...open it up to see wht it is abt"
I wish my mind was open enough to believe this is a man home lol. Because females do everything and a man just lives there.
I just realized, this is the modern version of MTV Cribs.
The is confirmation of Travis' real personality. He has kind eyes so I could always tell he is a good one but this really shows he is a calm chill person. A real contrast to his outward appearance. A very beautiful home 👍🏼😍
Uglx
Why did Travis look like a tony hawk video game character in the outfit selection section right at the beginning?
Waiting to see what kind of schmuck the Kardashians turn him into in 5 years
Interesting how so many assumed Travis is the opposite of calm and zen. Just watching him with Kourtney proved that he was a really cool sweet and passionate guy.
why nobody's talking about the "this smells like Kourtney's orgasm" on the candle 😂
Damnnnn Travis is in the matrix now.
im   kind of shocked    two white guys smashing a kardashian
exactly the style and kind of vibe I would want for my house. who knew travis barker was such a level headed guy.
he was the only one that survived the  plane crash, God has plans for him
Anyone know what material is used for his floors?
wow what a calm and chill guy. "when im here, i wanna make it count"
Wonderful person, wonderful home. Kourtney is very lucky.
So not a Kardashian fan, and even less a Shanna fan. Don’t know much about Travis either. However, I do know this guy has been to hell and back. Listening to him talk about his plane crash, and DJ AM, breaks my heart everytime. He’s battled so much. His eyes were so sad for so long.  But since the day he fell in love with Kourtney, he’s alive again.  Yeah, old people PDA is gross, but seeing them together, Is incredible.
What happened to Travis face though 🫢
poor people, I wish them the best and some kind of relevance.
Beautiful house and decor
No envy no  jealousy   Its a beautiful house
His house is very Kardashian
Omg,he is amazing.. he knows where they all seat
Can we please take a moment to acknowledge that candle 😭😭 10:29
Wow. Really did not expect this at all. He’s so calm and at peace!!…just love this. Such a family man🙏🏼
I always wonder: with these floor to ceiling doors that open up to the living room (and how popular they are), how do they keep bugs out? I open my door for 30 seconds and it’s fruit flies and fungus gnats EVERYWHERE (I live in Northern California so it’s not like we have crazy weather or giant bugs)
He talks about veganism and organic stuff but for one person he generates probably more than 20,000 villagers carbon dioxide emissions.
Really love the aesthetic
https://youtu.be/YwdESVF_7_M
Read his memoir. Nuff said.
No one's talking about that candle beside his bed?
all respect to you Travis! This video showed us how simple person you are and a loving father, I noted how many times you mentioned your children and what they do
Absolutely stunning exquisite home! beatiful
“This smells like kourtneys orgasm” lmao
Very beautiful home 👏🏽👏🏽
I'm a car guy and sets off on a motorcycle
What are the blurred frames
I love how Travis basically doesn’t want a museum of a home but like a real home that looks and feels like a lived in home with regular everyday souls yet every piece has a meaning 👌🏾✊🏾💖
Travis looks like  a white supremacy gang member  with the nick name crowbar
Wow beautiful home tu for sharing
It’s so sweet how Travis cherish and is so appreciative of everything kourt bought him♥️
Travis is so chill & sweet I can see why Courtney is marrying him
He never smiles.  Artistic expression and endulgences are for the rich.  99.8 percent of the world have no idea what you are talking about.  Even the ping pong table is an artistic expression.
Dior called my assistaaant. Uncah Jahms
Beautiful soul. Congrats❤️❤️
Not to compare but I like this couple way better than Machine Gun Kelly and Megan Fox (who got conversations out of this world) Kourtney and Travis are such domesticated and low-key couple
Contradicting to his exterior look, he’s actually got pretty elegant taste and the interiors are exquisitely done
I love reading these comments and seeing everyone discover how lovely Travis is. I’m fortunate enough to have met him myself and he is the exact same without the cameras on him— one thing that struck me in particular about him is that he’s brilliant at listening and maintaining eye contact; he cares about what you have to say and he makes you feel that energy too. He’s just a pleasure to speak with, even if it’s a seemingly trivial conversation.  They say “you should never meet your heroes” but turns out mine is an absolute gem!
Uh hell no who's Travis baker I'm living under a rock bruh
I really like his voice, it's so relaxing!
This house sucks
Amazing ! Just watching him give this tour of his house was so calming, I felt his peaceful vibe.
He talks like Cindy lauper, such a girl. Awful.
I love it! Beautiful home 😍😍😍
He seems like a nice guy, but looks so thin and pale
This is a great guy!!!!! SO happy for them
I’ve never seen Kourtney adore someone the way she adores Travis
Jas realised he's the most kindest soft hearted man!
I almost spit out my sandwich when he named his kids.
Top 3 fav tours. Just feels worn in but like the best worn in jeans that have been fixed up perfectly
I guess I shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  This guy seems very cool and the house is just beautiful and tasteful. Bravo.
Just beautiful 🤩 and he’s so calm and Zen his voice is making me so sleepy
Travis is the gym such a nice gentleman I love his home and if you listen very closely to everything he's saying he's really into sentimental stuff. He is far from being a shallow person a good human being that he is I wish him and kourtney the very best
So I'm the only person who hates this?. .   Tasty vegan food Really Travis!
What a gentleman, articulate and sweet
“Just 10,000sqft”   My house is 1,100sqft 😆
ngl i wasn’t expecting that. ngl i loved that.
“SOME of my shoes are in this closet” has 100 pairs of shoes in that closet
So happy there rich and happy must be easy and nice
Thanks Travis ! Loved your tour and story.  So calm and relaxing.   Awesome !
His tattoos make him look intimidating but wow he is so sweet by the way he talks and his likings. Kortney definitely found a great guy.
You know Kourtney happy as hell to have her back broken on that organic mattress 😍
It appears that he’s very thoughtful and holds on to family memories and traditions.
I didn’t know who Travis Barker was until now. He seems like a very peaceful and good-hearted person! His zen-style home is exquisite and timeless!
What the F are you wearing....!???
Wait they JUST got together in October?? 😭
Just what we need, more people bragging about what they have. This is getting disgusting!
Beautiful home
Beautiful
Mu first time watching this dude. I'm impressed very humble.
She found a Keeper! I'm glad she recognized his worth because anyone who dedicates 16 years to a home will no doubt spend the same on a relationship. He's in it for life.
His vegan 😍
No way dude no way 😂😂😂
He’s creepy
I hope this man stays him and that so called Kardashian curse doesn't ruin him. Ijs
He's a middle age man that is stil into Goth?
Very tasteful, very clean and uncluttered but still warm.  This house is lovely.
The thought of him christening every room with kourtney makes me want to 🤮. At least it is better than his face….
I totally and completely understand why she married him.  He's devine
His voice is really soothing
TRAVIS IS SO CHILL.
Beautiful!
I am curious, why photo frames and a vase were blurred 17:17😞
He’s so thoughtful ❤️
Aren’t they talking about selling their homes soon and building a new one? This is a great sneak peak for any potential buyer.
So amazing
I really have to ask thiss question but do these famous people walk around dressed like that just to chill in their house?
Freak
I just love them together♥️
The fact that he framed Penelope's portrait drawing of him says a LOT <3 Such a genuine person..
That is a home experience not just a house tour... loved it ❤️
Sooooo.. at 15:16 what the hell is the thing that jumps from the back if the RR..?? Like for real, there cant be someone back there.. a cricket? ..tiny ufo?? I genuinely am stumped or I wouldn’t have spent the time to write this lol. Someone enlighten me! 🤷‍♂️🦗🤑🛸
I like him from he was one of the first reality shows I used to watch years ago, he is very calming and a family man...I like them together   beautiful home
I love your home. I think this is the most I’ve ever seen Travis Barker speak in one video. And now I’m craving Macha tea 😅 and tattoos all over my body 😁😆. That sound room 🙌🏼. My favorite part of the video, “My kids learned how to ride their bike inside this house.” I would’ve been whooped with the metal end of the belt and grounded if I biked inside as a kid. 😅😂 Those toys in the garage 😎. All around just epic everything. Cheers. 🙌🏼
He’s such a good guy, great taste and gives out so much warmth. Looks are deceptive I must say and never judge a book by its cover. Travis proved me wrong
Love his house. Happy for him and Kourtney!
Omg those green stools!!!!
wow, i break my back and work so many hours and i cant even afford an apartment, these people are born into the right family and have more money than they can spend
i hate when people put their butt on the counters
I see why Kourtney loves him , truly.
Weirdly obsessed with kourtney for years
Travis is dope and super chill! He's always been gracious and iconic!
I am A minimalist...too
he is the opposite of how he looks like, and what he does? The house is very neat, and not overdone- now   know he can make Koutrney happy.
Wicked Sweet Guy's 👍
FELLOW kettle for the matcha.. this man knows what’s up. 🫖🍵😌🏴‍☠️
superficielle
Even Though his house is a mansion his furniture and everything is very normal and chill. It’s not like most celebrity houses where it looks like a museum. He’s super down to earth and soft spoken.
Its so LA
Lol seeing the pillow move forward lol 🫠🫣
Why was the scene with Kourtney so contrived? You get with Kardashians everything is made for the publix.
What a lovely person.
woah i thought his house is gonna be all black and dark but it turned out his house is nice & calm not messy too haha😆👏🏻
Sooo Down to earth 💕💕💕 and I think he did alright choosing Kourtney too 😉
This is no doubt & no kidding the best house I've ever seen
that man LOVES Kourt & his family so much, I love to see it !
That is exactly how I would love to live ❤️
I have never heard Travis speak before and I did judge him because of his harsh looks and rock songs.  I was so wrong about stereotyping him, but now I love his personality. He is the perfect man any woman needs. He is  just gentle, chill, family oriented, attentive, respectful,  artistic, detail oriented and has great values. Kourtney is one lucky woman. He has definitely taught me not to judge a book by its cover. That house is beautiful and peaceful.
i see why he and kourtney get along
Wow a minimalist... In colors.. he really seems a better match for Kim!
I'm pleasantly surprised, impressed actually. Shame on me for thinking Travis would be anything but a chill and nice guy because of all his tats. He seems so down-to-earth and likeable. My apologies for prejudging. Best wishes to the newly weds!
I would love to see before and after pics.
Only me? Who is wondering what happened in her house?🙂🙂
I wonder if it’s a kardashian’s architect, as it reminds me a lot of each of the girls houses. It’s nice, but does seem very similar to their style.
Why does he say “my” everything?  That’s MY pool… this is MY movie theater… normally people just say “the” pool, movie theater, kitchen etc.  It seems a little narcissistic, doesn’t it?
He’s so sweet
His voice is so sweet
Me: 😶 looking at his face skin Him: He has such a peaceful Spirit 🦍
Travis looks like some creature from an alien movie... The walking zombie. 🤮 But an excellent drummer.
I really like Kourtney & Travis together ❤️
Why did you spoil your face with tattoos??
Wait, what? Is it unusual for celebrities to keep things from "3 christmases ago" or longer? What else would they do?
Why so much tatoos?? It looks terrible. A nice house.
Nothing of this I expected. The calm talk, beautiful home etc.
Being a vegan is def a trend. Lol.
dude he is so cute and looks like such a centered person, ily Travis. I hope u are happy
Very chill place. Love the zen vibe
That house is absolutely beautiful. Everything is so clean and in order. I hope to one day have my own house the way I like it. Doesn’t need to be that big or fancy, but just open and clean with immaculate vibes.
Love your energy.
Love these two together!!  ❤️ ❤️💕 💗  Congratulations on everything Kourtney and Travis.
His voice is so soothing
Hey I wonder if anyone ever told him he looks like CELEB POLLY SHOOR
Hes so chill but in an old soul way..I gotta remember Travis almost died and that does something to a human being. It makes them see life different..either they cherish every moment or struggle with why they are still here.  Either way at some point Travis came to a crossroads in his life, he decided he was going to really live it.  So happy for him and Kourtney, she also broke a cycle of unhappiness.
Syurga Dunia
Very impressive. Congrats!
Why does he look like Reign?
How does that guy even have any money? He was in blink 182… lol
Promotion video to sell and get the highest price before they pick a family home to settle down in?
Brooo, like I do wish that I could have a huge long humble hallway to teach my kids to ride they bikes 🥺
He is so nice person
Travis is my new fav male celebrity/musician. I love how he took his time explain every details and he is so calm ! He wasn’t even rushing through. And whenever he’s with kourtney he smile instantly. Just such a really really really nice guy! ❤️
HE HAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL HOME!! VERY ELEGANT, SO PEACEFUL....😊💕💞
This is one of the best house tours because of the way he talks about the things in his home the way he breaks things down and why they are there love the store
Hmm so im obsessed with him
Ewww sorry not my cup of tea!
I thought it's going to be super dark and messy goth house but his house looks normal and clean. He also talks very calmly, wow!
Smart to go with an electronic drumset. It will be easier to pack in the trunk of a car when they inevitably split up.
So, this is how some of us live. We’re having trouble paying for gasoline, food, and all the bills shooting up, but this guy? I’m sure doesn’t have to worry about stupid stuff like that.
Every room is well set, cozy, with personality yet has its own purpose, really loved the house, it’s one of the houses where I’d love to live
He is so calm, what a great human being.
This is actually such a tasteful, classy and homey house . Makes a difference from lots of celebrities houses
That was the cutest thing I’ve ever seen. Kourtney talking about her Macha.
The matress is Organic😏 Kourtney ❤
M so surprised that you love matcha and you are vegan 🌱 so healthy wow 🤩 much love travis ❤️congratulations on your wedding
Mocza haahah
A dream that I really wanted.
Bougie Punk
I love you guys ❤️🙏🏽
Kourtney looks good in the house❤️
Love it!!!!
He’s a simple man who doesn’t love a simple man.
Team Kravis!!
All that Scott should have done and been finally she gets her boaz I hope it’s forever.
You guys are saying he’s this he’s that you have to remember this is a person who faced serious near death experience. Plus actual death of ppl he loved you don’t survive such a thing and not be a special person I know I’m one.
I'm surprised no one said it yet but at 10:27, he has a candle that smells like his wife's orgasm XD we love to see it
Honestly, his house looks and feels homey! I actually love it and I'm surprised by that lol.
Dude seems really cool and chill, love his energy
I have always loved Travis baker from the blink 182 days.  He is such a sweet genuine guy and the way he acts with his kids and Kourtney is absolutely amazing 👏.
What a Beautiful home Travis and Kourtney have. Looks cozy
Celebrities have the most soulless houses
Love love this tour 😍 also, a lot of you guys are weird as HELL in these comments. You guys did not like him or thought he was a bad person because of tattoos? DRAWINGS? It’s 2022 … really guys? Really need some growing up and soul searching to do if you honestly believe that people with tattoos are some kind of monster/aggressive people.
Always loved Travis! From his Blink 182 days and now! He’s been the same chill type of vibe and it’s so refreshing that fame has never changed him. He’s been true to himself and has my respect. ❤️
Travis is such a calm and cool guy..and so sweet to mention also kourtney's children as his own. GOD BLESS to you guys..KOURT's such a lucky girl.
His voice is🫠
nice and calm home...
Beautiful home,Travis is such a humble yet Kool person,and an amazing dad.
Oh yea Courtney you're just casually sitting on a counter looking all cute with a laptop drinking a cup of tea LOL fake. She just haddd to be in this video huh, everyone knows y'all are together.
I like you Travis Barker!
His home my house
Really enjoyed this. Got to see Travis in real life, at home with his favorite things. Beautiful home, glad he decided to remodel and not move, great job 👏.  I’ve never seen him, other than working, or loving on his Kourtney, which I think is wonderful! Very blessed 😇
Wtf is he wearing a leather boiler suit in cali.... what an idiot
Wow, he is nothing like what I envisioned. He  seems so calm and gentle.
His candle that smells like kourtneys orgasm wtf 🤣🤣
well he is nothing what i expected, i am positively surprised ,he is a very genuine calm person
He seems like he doesn’t yell or argue at all and I am so happy him and kortney found each other that’s what she needs
Beautiful home and congratulations on your both marriage life. 🤟🏻🌺❤️
I'm positively surprised. This house is elegant and cosy. Love it!
I Love you guys.
I actually liked it. I never expected Travis to be so calm and gentle. The whole aura was really soothing and that he remembers every details of the house really liked this video
i love how he keeps saying, "we". He's so in love.
Just learned a new phrase “murder it out”…..   okay, alrighty then.
Wow.  I’m a changed individual.  I wasn’t a fan of Travis Barker, don’t like tats on anybody, but this video has changed my attitude about him.  Great mindset about “home”.  Under 10K sq feet home is something to be said for a celebrity.  Most of them have 25M sq ft.  Love the fact that his home is his real true home.  Nice.
Danger Danger . ⚡ .
Looking at him I was like his a no go once I hear him speak I fall in love with him instantly
Standard home, or mansion
Sucks we never get the kid's room but I get it. He has teens and they need their privacy.
He impressed me
How do they call this style??
Epitome of a punk in 2022, what would Sid think
A sophisticated home for a sophisticated person. Everything harmonizes so well.
A Beautiful and personal home! Love it! 👍💕
He's such a nice guy nothing like Scot this guy is humble
Lol... "and I'm like whooaaoo" 🥰
punk who went full enterprise
He's so soft and well spoken.
Hold up... he said, Oct 17 was the day they were officially together, the first day they hooked up and hung out more than friends and the day he proposed to her... I thought he proposed to her just recently. But anyways, carry on Trav!!!
I could watch this over and over again. I love how his home is very cozy and tranquil.
Vegan king
He is so calm. Looks can be deceiving.
kourtney looks pregnant 🤰
The framed photo from Penelope 😭 he’s such a sweetheart
This house is stunning!
I love Travis Barker & his aura. I’ve been a big fan of his since his Blink 182 days. (He is the KING OF KINGS when it comes to the drums. IYKYK!)🥁😉 I can tell Travis is such a humble soul, with all the vibes! & he married my favorite Kardashian, Kourtney! 😍💙 This tour was great. 🤘🏼
What a tool. 😂😂😂
He’s a genius living life I hope everyone who reads my comment accomplishes all their goals in life much love from Saint Louis
What a great segment!
Peaceful and elegant home ❤️❤️
Why do I suddenly love him so much  😃 🖤
And now am with another celebrity it's time to show it off your wedding was tacky  and you and kourtney are gross best energy you're full of sxxt your wife did it and put you in contact what does kourtney do kourtney used to be nice but she's been a total bxxxh for agesxxx
He’s actually not that ugly kinda cute
Travis Barker is actually a pretty sensible man, observingly so. He radiates such ZEN
It’s okay
I’m so happy for Kourt this man is the one for you siiissss
Oh my goodness, he's talking on and on, just from the heart!  😂Aww...He's so SWEET!  Definitely could see anyone falling for him!!  Great conversationalist, he MUST be!!

He seems like such a great guy! Such a family man. Plus his home is amazing. It's cozy, yet elegant. And definitely homey.
Everyone is acting like they know Travis personally now just from this video “he’s such a kind gentle person I love him so much he’s so humble” LMAO chill he’s just showing you his house
Omg that Buick 🤤🤤
surprising. really nice.
I can't focus on the house tour because his voice is so soothing.
I would never do it again, I like this life better ! !! <3
I can see why Kourtney fell in love. He has such a peaceful soul
He’s nothing like what I imaged he seems really chill and a humble sweet person to be around
Everyone cares about travis now that hes with a Kardashian !!! Sheep🐑
Oh sh** i thought i was watching the walking dead lmaooooooo
Modern man at day, punk rock superstar at night
Always loved him since I was in high school haha 😛
I really like him. He's so cool and calm. The house is beautiful. Kourtney is one lucky woman. They look great together too. I wish them a happy life together. ♥️
Hollywood house arrest? Every badboy been in them homes.... 🍟
Omg I see why Kourt loves him🥰I love that for her❤️
"It's Kourtney sitting in the kitchen counter for me!" So happy for them!
black dildos in the living room
this make me love Travis even more
He’s “that girl”
His everything is very calm
He’s the cutest!!!
When he said “I like this life better!” 😌
So many sitting arrangements and chairs But miss girl Kourtney decided to sit in the island table.
Didn’t realize he was so chill. Loveee his space!!
Yuck! I hope they cleaned the counter where Courtney was sitting.
Judging from the comments I think I'm the only one who recalls his reality show with former wife. He was a great guy back then too. Here's an episode: https://youtu.be/pw2Dh1YEyCs
Love your house and great vintage tee shirts and love your zen home! I love the openess and the windows and view amazing! Thanks Travis it was a great visit!
He's the perfect example of......NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY IT'S COVER.... Egg  on  my face.🇹🇹
I love it all .. he has my life with my favorite kardashian .. Travis you’re the man
I love the house ..simple and classy
So many books for decoration 📚 📚 📚
Who came here to see Kourtney 🤚?!?!
Dear gawd she married a blink 182 member i guess the pickings are slim
He seems so sweet 🥺💖💖
Please tell me someone noticed the candle the master bedroom?! Love it!
this is the first time i’ve heard his voice. i didn’t think it would sound so soft.
Beautiful Home and Sacred Space 🤍🌸🙏🏼
Steve O's apartment in early 2000s is the real punk rock. 😂
I love hearing the seating arrangement at the family tables…. the stories in general.. it’s sooo beautiful 💕 as well as how the two interact with each other.. 💓
This marriage is not going to last….. she must be on to him because he is so unattractive ….
Such a cool level minded guy. Happy that him and Kourtney found love with each other!!
Anyone else catch the candle in the bedroom? Lmao 🤣  10:34
don't want to here about kort
His looks: 👹⚙️⛓️🔗 His voice: ✨💞🌺🥀
He’s so sweet
I like his vibe..stay off the Kardashian show you guys will be fine
His outfit is giving Michael Myers vibes..
He´s really such a scorpio! (but in a very nice way)
Travis seems super cool and down to earth
so stupid that people even pay attention to this moron
Look
"gave it to her years ago... three Christmas ago, wow"  bruh what
He seems so nice and such a good human. Love his vibe. Super cool!😎
Lovely home. Jealous of all of your space. In the north here I could never afford to heat such a space but my and my books, plants, collectibles would LOVE such a beautiful welcoming home. Congrats to you.
Beautiful home.
I loved the running commentary of your awesome home Travis.  You are an amazing husband to Courtney and father to your children.   Continued  success in your life.
I love Travis, he's so calm and seems like the most genuine soul, I'm so happy for Kourt and I hope their marriage lasts, they both deserve happiness
Why does certain artwork get blurred?
that 87 Buick... 600miles... 😮‍💨
A little bit of shoes...
https://youtu.be/cWe0C0Anczc
Man dresses like a mechanic who fixes sex swings
Massive props for having a beautiful home and living in it like a king Travis Barker. 16 years deserves a big congrats my good sir and to your newfound love.
This house has such a good vibe. Nothing is too much, everything is just in the right place 🙏💚
Don't judge a book by it's cover it is..this man is great, the way he talks he's very calm, organized and full of wisdom!
Such a house, and then you are wearing what looks like black straight jacket suit. Come on son
It makes sense why Kourtney and him is together. They have the same family values. Children is #1 to them
This is a very humble kind man. Kourtney found her ONE!
I love the seat arrangement at the dinning table, method is too powerful! This love is so genuine I'm crying rn!! 😭♥️
No idea who this guy is,.. I have to google it.... But the house really rocks
lmaoooo did i just see a candle on his bedside that said "this smells like Kourtney's orgasm " HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAH am deaad , it's kind of cute
I fell in love when he sad 'Our kids' I already love Koyrtney super cute self
so humble travis muffuckin barker 🤘🏼🔥
I don't think he knows what "minimalist" means.
I so love Travis! So talented, so chill. Been a fan for years
Wow, Travis, can I pick car? Beautiful home! Congratulations on your marriage!❤️
Beautiful home! Very cozy and zen. He has such a soothing voice too. He should do meditation audios. Great place to live all in all. Great job to all who were involved 👍🏻
I'm from South Africa, and man oh man, I am truly inspired. I'm all zen'd out right now. One of the best homes I've seen in life. Travis, you're blessed. I can only aspire to live in such a tranquil luxurious home. I wish I wish I wish 🔥🔥🔥🔥
love how his kids rode motor bikes and skate boards in the house....finally a big house with a big family to fill it up happy for you both
"THERE'S A THOUSAND YOU, THERE'S ONLY ONE OF ME", that like fits so well for Travis bc Travis can easily find basics like Kourtney but Kourtney will never find a guy like Travis ever again!
He is a good guy you can tell he have god on him he is great  full for everything  he got and he love everyone  god blessed  him many year health and happiness. ❤🙏🇱🇷
Pure élégance 🤩
He really seems like a really cool, nice and chilled person. Never judge a book by its cover for sure!!! ❤️
Oh my goodness! It's a man version of Kourtney!
Candles she got him years ago? Lol 🤔 How long have they been together?   Love this dude
This was the only Kardashain I actually liked. However, now that she got with this moron machine penis face Kelly I have completely lost all respect for her. SMH what a blood sucker.
He seems like such a sweetheart
@xavier      okay dude, are you tired of the Johnny , Amber trail?   You are still everywhere. Did you do the last cleaning house video on BBC also? The banana oatmeal bread recipe is somewhere between the pile of chrochet and knitting  i send you. Not even a thank you from your side.... do you get all the stuff or are you sick with flu?.
terriblemente limpio y ordenado  y frio
Not an ounce of bad energy in this guy.
I don't like the decor and furniture.  So bland.
Doesn’t she have kids to raise? Or is it the nanny’s job?
I have to believe that he is as absolutely as amazing of a human being as he seems. ❤️❤️❤️
I envy everything about this man
He’s rich yet he doesn’t have show off vibe at all he is somewhat like kourt calm collective guarded Kourtney was stuck with the wrong man for so many year I’m glad she found love happiness and peace
Never judge a book by its cover
I love his moms rosary next to kourts orgasm candle
The vegan diet is killing this dude lol. He looks super unhealthy
Is he living in the same house he did MTV cribs with back in the day day? This palace is gorgeous
Love the fact he loves to cook vegan meals. You rock, Travis. Thanks for being that kind of human being 💪💛🌍
Really he’s a genuine person and and good father sure a good husband
I've never heard him talk before, but now I understand what Kourtney sees in him. He seems to have a great heart. I hope this love lasts forever!
2:23 Wow.. I love art, and it's what, this is, indeed, appealing, pause-provoking, and lingering, to appreciate the creative mind of another being: artistic. I love art.
Wau wow wau. So stylish. Never would have thought Travis Barker had this kinda clean looking modern home. Love it.
Its the happiest I've ever seen Kourtney
He has such a soft voice. Feels like an ASMR ❤️
those candle holders are like the shrek earwax ones
I don't like big mansions they r not cozy at all.
He comes across as level headed and  someone worth knowing.
Tranquil while looking like a federal prisoner with murder under his belt...all I can see and feel is the devil from these people
These people are total weirdos and the way they dress is hideous.....new age BS
its going to be sad when she fucks him over
After hearing and seeing all this you are totally perfect for Kourtney and she Purrfect for you. ❤️
there's so much love in this video !
Absolutely beautiful home! I love how minimalistic and simple it is. However, if anyone sees this who helps him with his house... tuck the wires to the floorboards and hide them behind the furniture. In the front room you can see them from the tv and the lamp. Having that tucked away will help keep everything looking clean. I'm surprised AD didn't fix that before they filmed.
That Cadillac is my dream vehicle 😍😍😍
Travis Barker is a VRIL .
Wtf is he wearing...a loose gimp suit
Wtf is he wearing?? RIP FASHION
He looks like a walking trash bag
That Buick is clean asffffffff
No hate but A LITTLE BIT OF SHOES!?!?!That’s a hell of a lotta shoes
Rumor has it that's not matcha...
Unlike other Kardashian's lavish homes this house architect is just like normal american home but both of them looks happy and very calm,peaceful in it.
Travis earned and deserves everything that he’s accumulated over the years, every piece he showed us has a story to tell behind it bc he respects and cares for it enough to not only take care of it but make it a fun & loving memory! He’s such a calm, and beautiful soul! I’m so glad he found love and happiness, what a beautiful family!! Idk why/how anyone would want to hate on someone so loving, peaceful and real.
Not us falling in love with him as a person 😭 I'm so happy for both of em
lo amo
Wow, super cool🤩
His voice is so soothing,
Congratulations to Travis Barker and Kourtney Kardashian for getting married 🎉
Kourtney was just waiting for the camera man to finally come to the kitchen 🤣
At top of my head, dont exaly sure where this tough came from but i kinda wanna see MGK & Megan on this channel too somepoint.. 😅😂 yes i know it may be sound odd or etc but cant help it
Why is no one asking if Kourtney is the right woman for him?
Very nice house! I like that it's one floor! 💕
so cool
Travis is a minimalist like me 😆. I love the bedroom the most
Heads up....watching Martha Stewart's tag sale last night on tv and THE MOMANGER made a cameo: look for some new decor coming soon with Kris: jadeite pieces and also she is already getting ready for Halloween keep an eye out for some new fall/Halloween themed baskets from Martha's line😂😂😂😂
Travis is the definition of don't judge a book by its cover. This man is so sweet and soft spoken 🥰 I swear he use to cuss and pull on his crotch 🤣🤣
I like that he remembers who sits where around the table. Good Job Kourtney- he's  sweet!
"Minimal"   Has more cabinets, tables and chairs than a furniture store haha
Kourtney over there looking like kris
Oh so him & Kourtney spoiled each other WAYYY before they were together huh 🤔? -Scott has entered the chat 🕵🏻‍♂️
wow i really like the house. its so zen and minimalist. I am also a minimalist i can relate to what he is saying about destressing and peace of mind.
I must say the very nice home
Travis sincerely seems like he is a really nice guy. But I found it amusing that he owns an "organic" bed, but he seems to do most of his sleeping on a living room couch or the furniture in his home theater. - I'm not too surprised. I purchased an organic mattress, and found it to be as hard as a rock. Really painfully bone-breaking to sleep on!
Looks like an Air bnb, clinical and with an Ikea vibe.
The Thug and Gunna being in his studio didn't age well lol
I want to have e house like this in USA
Wow he’s a chill dude fr
Ok... He looks like a great guy! Kourtney think you hit a jackpot.
he sounds so much younger than he looks
I love TB soooooo much and kourtney to. The Energy of love and chemistry between them is pure magic when they showed kourtney and he touched her I felt a pure real clean strong gentle love that not even time can touch!! Wowzzzzza!! Very Imspirational.
This is not so much punkish))
is that voldermort?
showing their homes is just a reflection of them : they r highly superficial & snobby
He seems very laid back and calm. Definitely not what I expected. Goes to show you, you can’t judge a book by it’s cover! 💕
"Yeah so like the light in here is so good and yeah we eat here". 🤣 I love listening to people with money, that have no actual intellect or ability of explaining design. "So yeah I just threw some money at it, and wholla". 🤣
I love how kourtney is just hanging around an letting him do his thing.
Not sure why I watched this to be honest
Typical California, Zen, Vegan ,Macha ,nauseating… The inside of the homes in California all  look like furniture stores ; white ,gray no color all sterile looking,eeww…And NO. not jealous
Nice video .
Nice but too plain .. doesn’t feel cozy ..
Money can definitely buy a whole lot of happiness. Hmm.
Wow what a true Punk Rocker he is
Very good 👍👍👍
First day you hung out you proposed?
This is MTV crib re-done
He has way more personality than Kourtney
Awesome house! So happy for you and your family! 💕🙏💐
This man is so grounded. His family is probably the key.
wait he's a really cool person and i smiled all the way through the video.
He's cute.
Travis has a calm vibe about him. ❤️ it
He seems so dang in love!
To hear you talk, one would think you and K have been together Foreva! Opulent Lifestyles like her Familys are sickening to me. Why cant Ppl." Live simply so that others can simply Live?! You seem like a level headed Man, hope you dont become tainted.
Doro it’s open I wait for him  Okay  Super
Amazing!!! Absolutely amazing!!! normally I would be very beside myself with all the money because of what you can do with it to help the world,  but if we all had money I think you nailed it, because you have light amongst the darkness and light SHINES more than any of the darkness, I so appreciate your values!!! Absolutely amazing! Love it.😍 Shine on!!!🌞🌞🌞
adorable, minimalista, mesadas despojadas...Amo esta casa, se respira paz
What a top guy 👦 he is so chilled 👏 fabulous property 👌
I can't believe he's 46!!
Kourtney found her peace thru him.
I live thid guy. His spirit  seems so cool.
Why all the houses literally looked the same jn Architectural Digest? The celebrities probably dont even live there... 😂😂😂
This guy put me into a coma droning on about himself and his stuff
Can never understand how anyone can justify having that many pieces of clothing !! There’s some pieces there I can guarantee will never be worn again hahahaha No hate though he seems very grounded and house is very classy and simplistic which you have to appreciate considering their celebrity
I never realised until just now how much I love Travis Barker! What a lovely guy 🥰
Gollie no wonder Kourtney loves him......
Yaar kya banda hae, pata nahi itna gentleman laga,  ek number
beautiful home! what a sweet gentleman travis is.
Aroha Love from Aotearoa New Zealand.🥂🥂🥂☀️☀️☀️🌼🌼🌼
I am kind of ashamed to admit that I prejudged this man based on his looks... all these tatooes just aint sitting right with me. BUT surprised to see that he is very well spoken and quite nice
I love his house! He's got style and good taste but not so much in his choice of clothes 🤣 he looks like a janitor 🤣
weirdly enough, i can see them living in the house… like i expected to see a cold and uninviting space, but i can picture them eating together, playing, just lounging altogether
Lovely
Yes he is so legit
Beautiful home. Good taste. The cars... Impressed
Congrats
First episode where y'all show the garage..love it..y'all should do it everytime coz we wanna see the cars and gadgets more..
l love black as well 🙂
Beautifully curated by Mr Baker.   He comes across as a gentleman, a sentimentalist, an aesthete, and he epitomes thought of William Morris:  have nothing in your home that you don’t believe to be useful or beautiful.
I use to be a Barker fan, but who the fook is this guy?.. 🤨🧐🤔
this is LITERALLY so cute.  Him knowing ... were everyone sits ❤
The fact that he has kept this house this long.. JUST because of the beautiful memories with his kids says so much.. Do we need more reasons to love him 😩😍
finally, kourtney settle down with someone i believe would make her the happiest woman alive <3
Funny how he mentions “ vegan” but has leather seats on all his cars
I love him , he’s so sweet so calm
very modest
Travis looks like he's coming out of the matrix in that black jacket. Corona virus keyboard 🎹✌️🤘
He got a soul,hope many happy years to both of them.
I love how his house feels and looks like a real house. I love the style of the house. And he surprisingly has a calming voice
Is this the house he had with his ex
“IF” he wants to entertain lol : he was was engaged lol
Cool Dude, beautiful home
I actually kind of like this dude. Seems like a warm guy.
Travis is a cool dude
I'm surprised.  I expected something crazy, but this house is so calming. 16 years in a house as a celebrity, and his stepdaughter is still with him. Everything is about his kids, kourtney and comfort....And matcha tea, puzzle and pingpong instead of what I expected. And this really tiny scull. I'm positively shocked.  Never judge a book by its cover.
I always wondered what a vampires home looks like
Here for the comments 😅 I like seeing people giving their expert opinions about the life of other people, that's my thing 🙃
This home is so elegant and comfortable.   Very well done by opening walls and extending windows to bringing in the outside in, so beautiful.  Home is furnished perfectly and love his attitude about his space in coming home to tranquility and enjoying his family.
The thumbnail court's face looks identical to her mothers.
Fake
Beautiful 😻
🤮
Jesus
Did no one notice the candles name on his nightstand @10:29
Kourtney seems happy and honestly, she deserves it.
His voice my goodness I didn’t expect! So calming and relaxing.
Scott don't watch this!  You'll be siiiiiiiick!
Well this relationship won’t last
This guy has a calm and friendly voice... Don't think I ever seen him speak 😂🤣😂
Interessante, ela usava um pijama estilo campo de concentração, será que mais alguém notou?
Beautiful home 💕💕
dope af bro!
Request Harry styles plsss
Love how down your earth Travis is and so happy for him and kourtney! Love how much he loves family and actually made memories in the house for 16 years ❤️
So this is basically 2022 version of mtv cribs
And he's vegan - so awesome.  Can he be more perfect.  I want a man like him.
these rich people need TVs bruh
This smells like Kourtney Orgasm that's definitely Travis bedroom 😂
Beautiful home but that leather jump suit ain’t never catchin on bruh
a
he literally is not what you expect from what you see and I love not saying I judge a book by its cover I dont but literally I can see why him and Kourtney work so well together
Are we not going to talk about the candle?😹
First year full love and romantic  Next year divorce paper
Very classy, clean, modern, yet comfortable. I was quite surprised.
The way he talks a lot about kourtney. Says it all ❤️
Estas mujeres es puro cuento que se casan con este y con aquel todo para sacar dinero de sus escándalos. Al rato se divorcia de este hombre.
his voice is calming
I actually like the guy…
Please don't crowd my vibe.
Just realized how much Kourtney looks like her mom
Why is there just a bunch of women commenting on how much they want to suck on my boys nutsack
💖💖💖💖
Beautiful home   It's perfect!!!
a very humble person..a very simple house..love it..
My favorite two people met on my birthday Oct 17 🤎🤍🧡
Liberal 🤡s - real title
Nice content mate! So happy to announce that I have gained financial freedom by investing in digital currency. Now I know that multi creation of various streams of income is the ideal Principle for financial sustainability.
Sid Vicious picture lit
I could see his and Kourtney’s compatibility. Wish them a happy union! Nice home Travis!
Anything for ratings. Yuk.
Ewe
“This smells like Kourtneys orgasm” 💀
Any one know where the movie room couch was from?
https://youtu.be/gkARBCOoIXI
He looks sick
Sick of seing peple with money and them having such boring homes.... I want gothic castles and dark black vampire Dracula vibes.... like wtf is this Travis? Basic girl stuff? ahahaha! jk! If this is what makes you happy I am glad you got the perfect designer for what you wanted! And that wall becoming doors and just opening tot he pool? So cool!
I love his energy, very calming. The home is absolutely beautiful 😍
Beautiful house
I feel really poor right now
What a lovely man.
Kourtney in the kitchen lol They’re such a good match!
Is he starting to TALK LIKE THEM TOO? or is it me.
The cars are SICK!! Especially the Buick and the rollz!❤️❤️❤️
I feel like Kourtney prefers her own house
in tears over the "this smells like kourtney's orgasm" candle on travis' bed at 10:27 fjdksljfkdj
Cool video
I love how every single room is homey
Did he say doors that open 👀😬 okay!
You should  play Bruno song open door
after he says " i wnt to count' HE WILL BE A GOOD PARTNER N FATHER rest of his life. Kourtney, you  r lucky. U catch good fish
Such a sweet glimpse into a soft spoken soul filled home. I LOVED it! He seems like a really nice guy. So thoughtful.
He in Cali . Where is his helmet when he took off? :o
😂I raised 3 kids in my 1200 sq ft home .. I couldn’t do it any other way 🤣
Beautiful home
is it true that he threatened to kill Shanna?
Money is a best friend
Well my mind has been changed about Travis....I never thought much of him....he's a real chill guy and seems like a really stand up kind of person.
This actually feels calm.unlike kims house which really looks depressing
What are the 5 albums that changed his life?  I can make out Pink Floyd The Wall, Operation Ivy, Dr. Dre, but can't tell what the other 2 are.
They both Santana’ fans...
Waldo knocked the wall down. Nice:)
That was a homey home for 10 000 ft. Travis is an intelligent, thoughtful and sensitive guy with insane talent. Kourtney is easily the most interesting sister, this relationship is fascinating- they really were pretty good friends before! Now about where in that house she's going to put HER clothes... and what about a nursery?....
It ain't gonna be tranquil for much longer...brace yourself Travis.
Gross,  gluttony,  excess and why marry?  It's a business arrangement that won't last.  Breaking up families is the Karjenners  way.  They'll suck him dry, and more on.  Too bad he sacrifices his own kids, family, and career for $$$$$$.  So wrong,  no loyalty.   He wanted kim, but settled for  Kourtney.   A cheater, liar.  She's a mess too.   No regard for the kids, but hey....they get what they deserve.    Travis Barkers career  was dead.  Another guy cashing in.  So disgusting,  !!!!
This was so wholesome! 🥺
THIS man is literally the coolest 😊
2 years ...
I knew he was a real one from the look in his eyes 🖤💯🗣
I love You  Cort. Are Together She Is a great Mother Travis Yall are the Great Couple
Kourtney looks happy!
What a nice house! What a nice guy
He looks so chill
I understand not liking too many people in your home 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 I’m the same way
what a life
travis is a G
When he’s counting the seats, it’s like he’s trying to remember all of the kids names - lol 🤣
He has such a calming spirit. Lovely  home.
What an amazing transformation of space.  A very clean house/space does indeed give a certain edge-vibe to it. Beautiful home.
The candle 😂 “This smells like Kourtneys orgasm”
Hey guys, just casually sitting on this counter without pants on.
He's so laid back.
his energy is so calm and he just radiates good vibes
Beautiful house what a calming voice you have
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Loving the simplicity and elegance of his house. Reminds me of Japan
Did he do Thor Reno before Kourtney?? It seems very family and very Kourtney? They seem to be very similar so a good  match…
Let's fight
Ca-cow
This is the BEST HOUSE TOUR I have even watched.
I could have never imagined that I have the same home aesthetic as Travis
Love when an artist appreciates another artist. The way he talks about his designer was very nice
I like this dude, I’m happy he found his happiness.
For a minimalist he sure has a lot of shoes .... and t-shirts.
I love his house, calm and peaceful.
This is a beautiful home! Finally a home and not bland like Kardashian houses.
These people are so weird
Wow...100 percent  Scorpio
This is a lovely home. Nice layout.  Kourtney looks calm, happy and settled in her life..However,  this guy looks like a  straight up,  Freak!. Kourtney baby Daddy Scott is a lot more pleasing on the eyes. However,   this is what Kourtney Kardashian married,  a weird, Freak looking,  scary looking White guy.
This is my great home just like this simple clean gorgeous 💙🤘🏽✌🏽 Fukin love Travis huge Blink182 Fan here
Dumb & Dumber.  He married the homely Kartrashian.
Travis Barker looks like penelope
Am I the only one who think he might be an obsessive compulsive person?
I love
I have 3 pair of shoes 😢
Honestly I hate being rich and famous people showing what they have can you imagine will be feel poor people may you show this around supper I’ll go to the sicword
How are you like a lot of things and you love a lot of things I get it keep saying
He's so awesome and Kourt has always been my favorite Kardashian ....they make a great team. Low key, lux, vibe ....and I like their parenting styles
wow
He's a very zen & spiritual person it seems like. Peaceful and connected, the way he speaks and his manurisms is so calm and collected.
did y'all see the inscription on the mug? Kourtney's orgasm??????????????????lmaooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Did anybody peep the candle by the bed? Lmao 🥰🥰🥰
Travis gives very zen energy and his house is very beautiful with a warm/clean/cozy decor.
Travis seems like such a great person inside and out! He is so calm and has a peaceful cool vibe about him. Im sure he is a great husband and father. 😊👍🏼
C'est magnifique !! C'est dingue jamais j'aurais imaginé cette déco chez lui. ( ps : je le connaissais pas trop)
So much courteous, decent soft , but doesn't show on his clothes.
I feel so calm listening to this guy talk. What a spirit
😳
😍
❤️
I see why him and  Kort are together they talk alike and act alike I felt like I was listening to man kort there perfect for each other 🥰
I dislike the Kardashians but I always liked Kourtney. She seems so nice and genuine. I am happy for both of them. They really look in love. Good luck to them. She seems like a good mom and he seems like a good dad too.
everytime i watch videos like this,im thinkin,: and lot of people literally dont have 2 dollars to buy a piece of bred..
Travis is so loving towards Khourtney she seems so much happier
Beautiful home Really calm vibes 😍
His voice is actually so calming
I love them together ❤️.  Kourtney is the best thing from that tacky family
My dream home
They are definitely meant for each other.
I hate those Sony Bravia TV's too.
His voice is so soothing....✨✨✨✨
All people know travis barker when he hang out with kardashian but the real people know him when he starts on blink 182, hes the best! And he is my idol when i was kid! Blessings 🤘🏼
Tatto ni Dukan
Goofy outfit travis
Travis is my new friend in my head..this guy is cool as all get out..just would love to hang out with him and chill🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️
Something about that Travis Barker I like🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👌🏿
Who u Who is Travis Barker ? 🤔
Anyone count to see how many times he said Kourtneys name? Lol
I have never listened to Travis Barker speak, but he seems so calm, centered, focused, and relaxed. Such an inviting presence who loves his family. This is awesome.
he sounds very homosexual… and has a lot of gay qualities too he seems DL
Boring interior.
Travis is such a great and sentimental dude! Kourtney n him r perfect together! Sorry Scott
Love his voice so calm ❣️
Wow, my anniversary is October 17th. Been together coming up on 16yrs this year. Loved the entire vibe of this place! I love how soft he comes across. Beautiful. 🤍🖤
Fontana! Wo!
Such a calm guy... best vibe tbh
Love his home and that he’s had it for so many years. That’s a home.
I could listen to him all day , his voice is soothing . Love the fact he went into detail about basically every room and the sentimental pieces he has.
I've never seen Courtney happier!
"We eat vegan food here" yeah you do. Courtney taught u well😂
omg and hes vegan <3
“This smells like Kourtney’s orgasm” I LOVE IT hahahaha
All I will say is pull blindfold from off your eyes. Celebrities are not perfect
Not him having a candle that smells like kourt orgasm😂
Everyone humble and zen when they are rolling in cash. I think something is wrong with anyone who gets with one of the Kardashians. He seems like a good dad though, I'll give him that.
What a freak!
Wow, what a chill fella. Very nice going Ms. Kourtney.
I love him for Kourt. Seems like a really genuine, caring, family man. A beautiful and homey home for a beautiful family.
wow sounds like a down to earth humble kind of guy!!! actually really enjoyed this video.
Kourtney please don't let him put anymore tattoos on his face...
If she dont get her funky tail self off the counter
Delicious vegan food is such an oxymoron 😆
Nice
Ok cute but WHERE IS WHAT HES WEARING FROM ?
What the hell 😂💀
I never knew who he is until now, seems like a cool guy, I love a calm person.
Shocker he’s a minimalist like Kanye 😂 find your own coolness people
he seems like such a chill and gentle person, with a soft voice,, which you might not expect from his exterior ~
Vomit worthy 🤮
S̊e̊e̊m̊s̊ l̊i̊k̊e̊ h̊e̊ s̊t̊år̊t̊ h̊i̊s̊ l̊i̊f̊e̊ åf̊t̊e̊r̊ h̊e̊ m̊e̊t̊ k̊o̊ůr̊t̊n̊e̊ẙ
New found respect for you mate. Your home is serene, tranquil, and beautifully understated. Thank you for sharing.🥰
How can i find out who built their kitchen cabinets or the designer?
She never sits there, that’s clear haha😅
Love him. Being zen...and vegan...why is she sitting her behind on the counter half dressed... Nasty.
Love how this house just feels like a home 🏡 🙃 😌  so calming
THE UNUSUAL FIXTURES LOL
Typo I MEANT THE....USUAL FIXTURES
HEY TRAVIS I AM SOOO HAPPY FOR U AND KHOURT...YOUR CHEMISTRY IS SOOO UNIQUE....YOUR HOME THE USUAL FIXTURES SOOO MIND BLOWING! WISHING YOU Both THE BEST.TIL DEATH DO YOU BOTH PART...I YOUR MY BLESSINGS...GREAT FAM
Beautiful living 🙏🏽 one day we all can live like this and have the mentality to earn it and keep it
Take a shot every time he says “Kourtney” . Lol he must really love her so much
Drinking this Matcha that you made Me😆🙄 with Matching  pj bottoms..
He just seams like a great guy all around. Especially when it comes to being a father. Idk how he was when they were young but at least now you can tell just how he talks about his kids how much he loves them. I truly hope for both him and Kourtney are able to have a kid together. They would make such a beautiful baby.
What a gorgeous home
Wow! ❤️❤️❤️
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱
He has the sweetest soul.  Congrats to you both
His voice is sooo soothing 😴
Dude you need to eat some meat! You look like you are sick!!!!!
Thus white man is the mist living down to earth guy any of the girls from that family has been with.   I hate tattoos  but he seems more normal  to me and polite and cool anchildren.  He comes off empathetic  and living Has such a good affect.
Such a man 🥰❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love how sweet and soft spoken he is.
I've loved Travis since Blink 182. You could tell when he had his reality show on MTV that he was the loving/comforting parent. So happy for him and Kourt.
She went from Beta boy to drunken Scott....to Super bad boy Travis.....let's see if the Kardashian Curse loves on.....he's next!!!!
Beautiful home
Such simple humble man, the way he lives and how  he constantly mentions his children is so beautiful and you can tell he is a great father .
WOW
I can see why Him n Kourt work ♥️
I love them
These nicest simple house thus far. Not too much and over extravagant. Just perfect 👌🏾
He's real and cool.. Wow I wasnt expecting that.
he's so cool man
I bet Travis has the best t shirt collection of all time
His energy feels calming even through this video. I’m so Happy Courtney has that in her life…. She deserves Him and vice versa
🥰
Yeees. Very 'modern'. Makes the garbage bag stand out I suppose.
Definitely new respect for Travis Barker!
Hiiiiiiii
When he shows off the plate that Kourtney made him at Color Me Mine and it’s sitting right by his bed?! I can’t. 🥺 So pure. So so happy for them both. ❤️
Did anyone saw the pillow moving by itself? 10:56
Wow!! That is good
I'd like to try a coconut milk matcha of his 😁 it's hard to find good matcha lattes
This house  looks so relaxing
The candle tho 😂😂😂
More than the house, beautiful for its simplicity, I liked the naturalness of the explanation, without artificial comments
I remember watching Cribs with blink-182 like twenty years ago and it is so unique that Travis stayed the same normal humble person he was when this all madness started for him. It is so rare. I’m sure he is one of the few who works the most and he totally deserves what he has. Glad he finally found true love too.
Travis is very humble and sweet I love him ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
He actually speaks very well.
I came here to learn how to trade after listening to a guy on radio talk about the importance of investing and how he made $460,000 in 4 months from $160k. Somehow this video has helped shed more light on some things, but I'm confused, I'm a newbie and I'm open to ideas
Omg Travis sounds so loving and nice never judge a person with tattoos
Travis is a whole asmr 🥰 love it 🥰
I feel old AF...
Kourtney so 😎 love her love them
Travis is the most chill person. Kourt did good. Of course.
Love him 😍
I love Travis’ home. So calm and peaceful. My seventh grade teacher would get on him for his generous usage of the word “LIKE.”
Minimalist and beautiful house
Simple and Comfy!… doesn’t have the museum Feel!.. Loooove it!..
Kourtney casually seated on a countertop with messy hair but a full face of makeup. Lol
I loveeee them as a couple 💑
I don't think anybody's going to understand what these girls go after the most dirtiest unclean looking dudes. Very fitting
I love your house, especially the concrete floor. Is the floor polished concrete or something else?
They both speak so slowly. They are a match💖
Didn't realize that Travis's voice sound so calm and smooth
Kourtney is the most interesting to look at, and Travis is the most interesting to listen to my Goodness 😭😭 just listen to this man talk people 😫😭now I know why Kourtney fell in love with him, you don't have to know him or be close to him to find out why this is it people this is it, I mean the way he treats her my God this man is just incredible ❤️ dear God thank you for their union please bless them forever and always 🙏❤️❤️❤️❤️
I still remember one episode from MTV Cribs, this is not the home I watched! There was skulls, punk rocks and Cadillac paraphernalias all over the place, I guess he is a lot mature now.
Love your home,just curious as to why all black? I love black to but every car and bike?
are Americans still obsessed with kardashians? lol embarrassing
ew weird
Zen~~~~~
Gorgeous home.
I have never heard Travis's voice before. This is the first time hearing him talk. Wow! His calm soothing voice, the way he talked and the way he articulated his home design in a very soothing manner. Its really mesmerising. They say, dont judge a book by its cover. Its indeed true, I guess. And his home is BEAUTIFUL just like a calm beautiful soul!
I'm so happy for her 💓  I want to find my soul mate too ❤
Why didn't you tattoo all the walls in your home
Oh god 🤮
Your house is amazingggg.....i stan
Travis seems nothing like what I had imagined. So many preconceived notions especially about people who do rock, he's so calm, seems kind also, knowledgeable, humble, and seems like a fun guy to have around, his home also just makes so much sense, all that touring, you definitely want a peaceful home. I like this type of insight, thanks for sharing it.
Only here to see the bikes
Very simple guy, he's good
He's family oriented and loves his privacy and he got the right woman to respect that. They HV lot in common
👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 I adore you even more calm and peaceful soul you and Kourtneys love is forever I can always tell. ❤️
Travis is so sweet and chill man I'm so happy for him
Can someone explane me why some of the art peacces are blured and some not?
This cenobite has great taste.
Thays   not  Travis  its a  clone
We need a matcha recipe lol
His house is a dream so beautiful ✨
It's so easy to judge this guy by just looking at him. My God his energy is so zen and very transferable. I love me a gentle dude, Kourtney scored herself a gem here.  What a blessing💕
Now I know why Kourtney love him so much he is very calm,and the way he speaks it sound like very responsible man and loving,,
Ya know what they done last night right!
That was such a beautiful tour thank-you korteny and Travis .and Alabama 🙏🙏🙏🙏🏠🏠🏠🏠❤️❤️
“With how much Kourtney works”…. Does she work I’m so lost now
i was watching the barker at the time with the osbourne and kourt and him wooooow !!!!! <3
Please share your matcha recipe.
Such a calm house and nice to hear its been lived in. Giving kids freedom in the home good on you. ❤️❤️
Guy seems interesting.. definitely goes threw alot.. genuine vibe from him under the circumstances of being on tv
Cool house, cool dad. I Hope their familiy make great Memories there!!!
He’s come a very long way from his episode of MTV Cribs. He’s just so likable. Now give us the matcha recipe, Trav!!
He just looks a good man & made kourtney finally happy
Excellent video and Travis is relaxed and talented
I don't know much about him nor did I watched an interview of him before, but after this video this is what I think about him: He loves his children, his wife, he seems like a gentle person and pays attention to details!
That's amazing how Kourtney discovered Travis's heart and soul so happy for you too
he is so handsome :)
I have never heard him speak, I've seen pictures of him and Kourt but never really watched anything related to him or them as a couple. He is so cool, calm and collected I am happy Kourtney found love again, she deserves to be happy. I hope they treat each other well and continue to be happy.
Nice guy! He's real and his house is authentically him!
Creepers!!!!!!!!!
With all the Tatts I expected him to be different but he is really chill 👍🏾 good for Kourtney she found a solid man. I am rooting for them. You can tell he truly loves and appreciates her by the way he mentions all the nice things she did for him 🥲
He activated my Google assitant when he said "I Googled ping-pong table" 😂
His looks: 💀🕷⛓️⚔️🖤 His voice: 🧚‍♀️✨🍬🧸💗
I mean if he was not rich, with that appearance nobody would date him.
why does americans in particular always claim that they make the best of everything? he said he made the best macha... wth Japanese should be worried then 🤣🤣🤣
I can now understand why Kourtney fell inlove with Travis. 🤍
Wow I love the sofa and those pillows wow
what a creepo
He’s so gross looking🤮🤮🤮
That was the most wholesome thing I’ve watched in a very long time 🥰🙏. Thank u for sharing.
Tdonc elle a quitter scoot pour ça
ja and she is just chilling there in her pjs...really😅
he's sound like kim when he talked
I couldn’t be more happy for them ❤️❤️
Why do Kardashians sounds horny all the time ? 😂
Oh he got a soft tone
He really is her twin flame. So similar wow!
his voice is so unexpectedly soft omg travis seems like an absolute sweetheart
Wow beautiful house 🏡
Bro Travis actually seems like a sweet guy . Happy for Kourt
Looks like a prison.
He is sooooo diff from scott! Def is NoT a narcissist. Lucky family
I'd kill for that G wagon 😍
A beautiful house and elegant.congratulations to both of u..kourtney deserve to be happy..❤️❤️
why does travis's voice surprisingly relaxing troughout the whole vid
The bikes and recording studio, so clean and professional.
This house is actually beautiful
Have y’all realized that he love feet 🦶 😂😂😂😂 check his page he love grabbing her feet 🥰
Why all this??🤔
Everything was so interesting until kourtney appeared
yo travis yo
When did he die and come back to life?
Why are people from La so weird open the door wearing a garbage bag outfit
Travis looks like that person who would laugh at your jokes but wont take it seriously.
Travis has always been a clean and organized for a man
Omg Travis looks like death 💀!!
Rad! My husband and I love doing puzzles and just enjoying each other's company..
So punk 🤣
GOES TO SHOW COURTNEY HAS ZERO STANDARDS AND VERY LOW QUALITY TASTE. BECAUSE SHE IS A LOW QUALITY PERSON. MY OPINION. I AM STICKING TO IT. THESE PEOPLE ARE PITIFUL EXAMPLES OF HUMANITY.
He's very affectionate with her, sweet.
Give much love for rasing mija and your own children be blessed
Courtney has a really good Guy 👍🏾
After seeing this I would marry the the guy! So calm.  Didn't get it... now I get it.
Him and this outfit but loving the fire place lit 🔥 is so me 😂 good and cozy 🥰
I'm so happy for Kourtney!
Omg that grand National is everything
Evolved Scorpio gang 🥰🖤
Thank you for sharing nice house
What is it with Americans and their insufferable use of the word "like" four times per six word sentence???? I can't stand it. They are rich and can't learn to speak with out fillers....
I'm so glad kourtney found herself a mild mature man.
I remember when Travis was on a reality show with then wife Shana and she was pregnant with Alabama. Travis on the show was a great guy I’m happy he has found a great companion he deserves it!!!
It will last maybe 1 month.
He seems so chill
10:30 read the candle 💀
so pretty, congratulations, God keeps blessing you !
Anyone know where his dining table and dining chairs are from ?
Wow... spacious, calm, clean, earthy. Love it.
It’s incredible how little sense of style Americans have. Nothing in this video shows a feeling of anything worthwhile (love, tenderness, discretion, tradition, creativity, contemplation) everything is just a display of possibility. The possibility of affording stuff. Pride in money and pride in some sort of futile status.
The Kardashian girls have the WORST taste in men I've EVER seen...WOW!!!
He's so soft spoken & cool love him for Kourtney ! 😍❤
He really went deep on explaining every detail of his home, i love that. Every room has bits of his personality. definitely a W
I love his refrigerator looking like cabinets...gorgeous
absolutely love the kitchen
I literally thing this is the first celebrities who house doesn't look like museum. I love it!
Seems like a cool guy
He looks nothing like his home! 😂 I am pleasantly surprised! The epitome of Can’t judge a book by its cover
When can I move in?
Great taste, beautiful home
Love how this AD videos are like the new version of mtv cribs 😭🤙🏼
he sounds, speaks, looks like a Kardashian. Travis went from pop punk to hiphop to rich hollywood Zen celeb hahahahahahahaha
Ok. Very good. More man than the prior one. Good taste.
https://youtu.be/ufiJiyA5A9A
Who is this guy? It's boring.
Peep the “this smells like Courtney’s orgasm” candle on his bed side table 😂
His vibe is everything 🥰
Love that kitchen!
No privacy, no class, everything up for sale.
OMG 2:58 is so cute how he names the seating arrangements! 🥺
❤️
I am so glad that he is happy, healthy, and genuine. I wish only the best for all of them !! 👍 It is nice to know he totally appreciates all of his belongings and knows the value of having a peaceful home, where he can rest his head !! 👍
Except from the cars, I was so NOT expecting this from TB. And I dont just mean the house.
Travis house literally so Elegant, Calming and Homie 😍 but I dont understand why Kourtney choose to sit there out of all the chairs and couches in the house 😅😅
He looks like a White Walker from Game of Thrones. He also looks like he'd be more comfortable in a mobile home. Lol
Gorgeous!!!!!
Very calm and I agree simple easy
Yea cool house.... but that GNX is something else....
So happy for Kourtney! What a thoughtful, sincere human Travis is🎯
Ok but this is one of the best houses I’ve ever seen! I will definitely use this as inspiration for my house someday
WTF is this dude wearing?
💕 Travis thou I hope to find a exotic man like him one day 😉
I did not expect this personality from him ! I’m confused
so passionately explained
Now that is a home not a house 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Tbh WOW HE IS SO CHILL OMGG
no cap if i was rich enough to design my own home it would look something like this the vibe just feels right and i would also have all black cars maybe some matte black cars
Every room looks the same
Is this supposed to be cribs
I can see why kourney is very in love with him,travis is so calm,intelligent ,
Never judge a book by it's cover such a calming energy
Boring! There’s no cool ideas in this house. It can explain so much about the person…. Disapointed
He’s such a genuine, chill person who’s also a great father to their kids. And he makes kourtney her favorite thing, matcha! She found a keeper.
They are equally calm and monotone lol
ONLY ,KRIS JENNER, DAUGHTERS 2 FROM 3 ,CAN GO IN BED WITH THIS!!!!!!
This is the grown ups version of MYV cribs..
10:09 things I don’t usually hear people say….” When I want to entertain in my bedroom….” Lol….
Will we be expected to get equally excited about their inevitable divorce?
Beetlejuice art.
Pleasantly surprised by his unpretentious choices…..I will easily admit I judged him to be completely different but he surprised me with his depth and decisions to make things smaller, cozier and  less “ celebrity attitude that I have millions of dollars and want everyone to know it….”. But it shows maturity.
❤HONESTLY !!!!! I...LOVE....THA....HOUSE !!!!! ( BUT ) PERSONALLY...... I....TOTALLY !!!! DISLIKE....ALL...OF...THAT....PLAIN SIMPLE...LOOKIN....FURNITURE !!!! THA....ENTIRE....HOUSE...LOOKS THA...SAME !!!! JUST...TOO...DULL AND.....BORNING !!!!! WITH...ALL THAT...MONEY...AND...ALL....OF... THA....BEAUTIFUL !!!! THINGS....IN THIS...🌎 ( WORLD )  MY... QUESTION IS....WHY ???? WHY ?????  WHY ????? WHY....IS...YOUR....HOUSE... LOOKING LIKE....THAT !!!!  WHY ?????
Travis is such an amazing human!
They look like they drink blood.
So interesting that he's a "minimalist", those tats are quite the opposite
God, listening to him, like, speak, like, a teenager, like, every fkn other word, like, hurts my, like, brain cells, like. And Kourtney sitting on the counter in JUST a shirt is so pretentious.  When he "entertains" in his bedroom.....can only imagine.  ick.
I love Travis speaking voice!, so calm, just a very well spoken person! ☺️
Sorry Scott,  He is Great and Adores Kourtney
They are so cute. Really hopes the happinesses lasts, she deserves it
Thinking a majority of his fans live in small dark smelly rooms with band posters covering every inch of the walls lol
I like him.🌚
So she been a sneak for a while then huh 🤔🙄🤦🏽‍♂️
Beautiful home ..definitely love how he always mentions he’s kids & family.
One boring punk rocker. Sounds like the Kardashian’s sedated him
I liked the affectionate way he touched Kourtney's foot! ☺🥰
Just stunning that’s what it looks like  when you have 💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰💰
Cool!! 😎
I wish there was some tribute to like blink 182 somewhere in the house
He seems like such a sweet, down to earth guy. I’m so happy he’s found love.
How cool is to be vegan and own 4 luxury cars which price could feed several people for a generation or buy several artifical organs and save lives, at the same time? But hey, look at me, I'm vegan!
i used to "unlike" him b4 coz of his tattoos..... but Travis seems a cool, brainy guy (and humble) we want to be friends with
Lovely energy♥️
Damn his talent. does not stop. He has. worked with everyone. in demand still. Amazing
Intro gave me “welcome to my crib 2007 vibes”
This made me Love him more.... Courtney is blessed to have this Love!
You do realize you're a walking contradiction, right?  I give it a year or two and you'll be divorced.
Wow, he is so real (regular). I love it ❣️
Vegan is for the rich.
Beautiful!
he just seems like a dweeb
I'm really glad Kourtney picked you .
Yes MK is paying off for Courtney well 😜
Lebron watching this like, " Damn, that's where my big went" lol. Love the home - would totally airbnb if I could afford too. = )
Kourtney made good decisions as an adult!! good for them
wow! I didn't know much about travis other than blink 182 & Kourt. But his house is so nice and homey! Completely different than the rocker persona. And he seems so down to earth. Also, the # of times he mentions Kourtney!!!
y does this guy sound like a teenager in an old mans body
WoW q punk rocker la casa d ese man😒
This was such a great house tour, Travis has such a calming and relaxing voice and it's so nice to see people who love their home and fill it with rooms to do the things they enjoy and décor that they love (I just feel like I've seen a few too many where the celeb seems to have rooms they barely need and art that's expensive and rare but they don't seem to really like it, this was a really nice change)
Sweetest dude EVER!
Please watch this.. Make sure to control your own emotions first. (1578) Along with the Gods: The Two Worlds - YouTube
He seems like a nice guy
His home is gorgeous, he's definitely chill, congratulations to him and Kourtney on their nuptials.
He’s so genuine and self less! I love this SO much for them. Definitely never judging a book by its cover.
he is wearing a rubber suit, what a disgusting man
Bieber but covered in tattoos.
I'd love to meet someone like Travis. A room full of sentimental things while having a minimalist approach is definitely right around my corner. This video also shows how involve he is with his family. Kourtney's definitely lucky🙂
And these are the role models in the jusa how disgusting. HE can hardly articulate.
Is that a Devo outfit ?
They have the best give together no act no weird vibe!❤️❤️
That was my family car in 1980's my parents had n my brother in law in 89 got into an accident n totaled our Buick that brought back memories seeing that car, but my parents had a silver one same model. Crazy.
Damn.. he proposed to her on their first hook up. When a man knows your the one .. he knows
I really enjoyed his house and him.  His tone was so soothing and pure which totally matched his entire house.
Wow Travis barker looks sick I hope he’s ok
Joe Rogan mentioned on his podcast that Travis is a truly genuine nice guy, and I got exactly impression from the moment he greeted the camera.
The story about him originally being infatuated with Kim isn't getting enough attention.
Now I see why kourtney fell in love with him, he is special and so 😎 they’re cool together 👍🏾
love him so much. he makes u want to learn everything about him and where he grew up. pure gentleman. i wish guys my age acted like this! so happy for him and kourt❤️
im literally not surprised anymore why kourtney fell in love with him
Travis is like the drum master of the music  industry such a family ,friendly man ,so romantic ..hands on dad 🔥🔥
The "Smells Like Kourtney's Orgasm" candle 🤣🤣🤣
looks staged, good lord where will they live?
Who’s the mother of his kids?
You look like sin
there's something really wrong with the Kardashian girls
Travis seems amazing. Kourtney, you’re so lucky.
Him n kourt have the same exact taste literally. The fact Travis son Landon was dating Josie n Jayden was literally friends with Landon n Travis helped Jayden n then Jayden cheats with Landon's Girlfriend says a lot about character n why ppl are not trust worthy is disappointing. I feel for Landon.
Ok, so I’ve always thought this guy had too many tattoos. Like I understand them, but let’s get real. But when you see him talk in his element you see him, know what I mean? I just feel bad for him that he fell for a Kardashian. I have nothing against them personally, I don’t even know them, but they are all about attention. I get it, I do, they’re all so beautiful, but they’re all so shallow too. Anyway, glad dude has a comfortable home. I love that he doesn’t like too many people there…hilarious and perfect.
The candle🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 yo
I love kourtney
Travis you’re so calm. I guess you’re bless beyond measure! So happy for kourt and you may God bless you’re union forever 🙏🏽❤️🙏🏽❤️
MOCHA????? hahahaaha like MOTCHA??? nooooooooo
When was the last hit Blink 182 ever had???? EVERYTHING IS KOURTNEY's MONEY!!! He is getting a career revival thanks to the kardashians!
If they remember to keep Love, Respect, and Honor for each other, they Will last Forever💖💖
This is absolutely my dream home!!! So cozy, minimalist yet so well designed! Love it
He looks scary but comes across as a softly spoken lovely guy.
He looks like he is fresh out the clone lab! 🤣
⁰wait. Until nasal voice gets her way with it.  We shall see
Can this 46 year old behave like an adult and not a high school kid. Like look at him.   He looks ridiculous
comgrats u to never she so happy till now try an make it last fam
They're a little ridiculous to watch.
Hes got such a soothing voice. Seems like a decent guy.
I can see why she’s so in love with him 🥹❤️
What a beautiful soul.
He's a keeper, good for you Courtney.  I wish yall the best.
Wawww amazing ❤️
Looking like a clown
What a nice guy,  I just feel he is so kind and gentle.  I'm in love )) haha lucky Kourtney ))
I love this home, its beautiful
Loved everything till you mentioned... tarantula 😵
The way he says kourt…. Is so sweet…
Anyone watch the video for long enough to get to the scent of the candle on the bedside table??!! (10.28)
He is ntelligent , and comes across as a humble man.
“We” as his ex or Court?
I love his style so calming and cozy
I really love the kitchen area. Very simple and welcoming.
The candle: this smells like Kourtneys orgasm
I miss scot ): lol
Wtf you wearing fool
When did Travis become such a lame turd
I love the color’s, and flow, and how sophisticated, and just sexy, and grown it looks!   So he said the first time they hung out as more than friends was when he proposed?  Wow talk about when ya know you know!
Why can she put on some clothes?? She can wear his shirt just put on a pj pants or leggings or something. AD is very well known show some  respect.
That weird onsie though 🤨
HELP THE CANDLE
Why do people sit on counters? Kitchen counters?
Love his home. He's lovely.
Yikes! No thank you.
I like Travis so much. So happy for Kourtney
I like how Travis’s appearance and style contrasts his personality. His fashion/style gives dark, loud, edgy, gothic vibes but under all that he gives us calm, sweet, angelic, gentle vibes.
Wow after watching this i realized her man is a really down to earth cool person. What a great couple, all the best and lovely  home.
“Kendall - Kourtney’s sister” is there anyone that doesn’t know who Kendall is? Doesn’t everyone know every member of the karjenner klan?
Wow ! I am enjoying his voice so much like can travis just keep talking.
I like how it's not so extra fancy like the Kardashians it's more like a laid back cozy home... tell a lot about him
You woudnt expect this from a punker like Travis
Who saw the "This smells like Kourtneys orgasm" candle ;)
I really enjoyed this
Is everyone blind? This weirdo has tattooed his face!!! This is a satanic act. They both need to repent and find Jesus fast.
omg hahah did anyone else notice the candle on the nightstand?
Nice hideous candle holders, you mediocre drummer. God Bless. And, ugly feet, Courtney! Yuck!
I love this guy he is really kind and talking about everything but different celebrities are like this is just a car
I met this man some time ago at Power 106. I was just hanging out with some of the DJ personalities. He came through and just how he is talking in this video is how he talks in real life. Dude is very cool and a nice person.
Awesome. I love me some Travis and Kortney. Cute, cute, cute couple.
A forced family so werid
I love that KK and TB got married: Don't follow but was truly happy for them and wish the Best! deb in Sunny SC🕶
I love it I’m so happy for you Travis and Kourtney many blessings.
Like, really?
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ He’s so awesome 👏🏽💯👍🏽👍🏽😎
I guess I had misjudged him all these years. He seems amazing. This was the best house tour
sounds gay
Travis seems to be a really cool dude. Positive vibes
Just beautiful , OMG  he is  so sweet   love ❤️  love the house
gorgeous house, I mean.. mansion, they're a very beautiful couple, I can see Kourts shine in her eyes, and her smile, I've never seen pics or videos of her so happy. Blessings for both of ya and to your beautiful family
Travis is the best thing for Kourtney, I definitely see it. He is all about family!
I see why Kourtney loves him. He’s so grounded, thoughtful, creative, calm and gentle yet firm and sure. I’m insanely happy for them.
This was the best Open door I've ever seen. Travis is such cool guy and has the best taste.  He's with me since I was a kid and listenened to Blink182.
Every one of these videos has a celebrity promoting their art so it appreciates in value. In reality they take down their family pictures and put up the art specifically to be featured in the video.
Travis this was a great video, you seem so mellow and genuine 💕 love that for Kourtney
My favourite couple travis have combined between calm beauty and charm in his life style and creativity in his professional life and most important  thing the love ❤️ wish u a happy life
One is literally fighting at the court with his ex and looks like other is the on the way.
It's true " never judge a book by it's cover what calm human being, our ..yes ..dude l was scared of you but l see another side , sweet man...
This is giving mtv cribs lol
He is very much a typical 9-5 nerdy businessman.0
I just imagine Kourtney giving this speech. I believe they are soulmates
Clearly we are all Happy for Court! I think he's the real deal.
Travis is so sweet and gentle.  Lovely home.  Enjoy life!
I honestly pictured dark colors/ goth vibes
Love the VEGAN vibe which extends to Travis' personality & the soul of his home. Wishing you & your wife much happiness🌞
Love his vibe. Such a lovely person. I hope she makes him happy and vice versa 💕🥰🥰
He’s so chill
I just love Travis!
2:28 Travis you’re a sweetheart but we all know that Kourtney doesn’t like to work. Or work much….if at all. According to Kim she’s the laziest one…..🤭
Is this the same house he lived in with Shana?
Kourtney works?
10:57  ... what' was that ... behind his white pillow😳
Just wow 🖤
His house is so peaceful looking, not a lot of “stuff” just enough things. He seems so at peace with himself, just like his home.
They got engaged on their first date??
Nice and chilled!!
I love the fact that he is vegan cause it is so not easy to be vegan
I love ur home it's beautiful 🥰
"Project X, come on Dad" 😄
Travis Barker's home is fabulous, I love everything about his cozy space! Wow! to think he's been there 16 years speaks volumes for him as a person. I applaud him👏👏
Wow he’s super calming. Love his home it’s so relaxing.
may I say that I genuinely loved this tour!
So MTV Cribs, but with better camera work?
Sorry to say this but amongst all her siblings, she has the longest relationship with Scott tho it was toxic she sticked with him through thick and thin. I'm just so glad that she found Travis, she deserved all the love and happiness. 😍
He is a very very very passionate man 💓
His sounds peaceful, but his tattoo is too scary 👻
Beautiful!
He’s one cool dude…perfect match for Kourt! ❣️
Now I can see why Kourtney fell in love with him lol
No one cares !
he seems like a family guy..and very down to earth..happy for them!
His voice is so soothing and calm... Way to go Kourt! You got a good man there💕
"how much Kourtney works"....emmm, what does she do exactly??😂
Magnifique...
i thought he didnt talk
This homenaje looks grear and very warn like home
They seem so happy together, nothing fake about it. May their union last forever. ✌
I love their love and hope I get someone who genuinely loves and cares for me as I do them.
I love these people, they're all do genuine and kind. I think it's wonderful that he's spent so much time here. I'm sure it's given his kids a good sense of home and being famous, they definitely need that!! Good on you Travis, happy for the love birds (now husband and wife).  ❤
It’s sad to say but she’s going to ruin him as well, but I really like Kourtney but them Kardashians will uplift men and later tear them down. Sadly, but true. Example Lamar Odom, Tristin Thomas, TYGA, KAYNE WEST , now it’s Scott Disick watch out Travis Scott because Travis Barker you’re next !
He’s really peaceful
Beautiful♥️🤟🏽🖤
So happy for Kourtney...and for travis! Seems like they finally found their person
dream home!
He is the besssssstttt
The moment he said vegan food is when I understood why he looks like the walking dead 💀😂
Now this is why we don't judge a book by it's cover..... he's so humble, his voice is so calming.. he seems like a really nice person
Idk but I don't understand why rich ppl living in houses that looks kinda empty and cold w no vibes or colors it's so dry simple and alot of things missing and empty spaces and the colors give no life and tooo calm ...
Love Travis, he seems like a very sweet man, very kind.
Thank-You AD, and Mr. Barker for sharing with us, your success is deserved and you are a talented gent whom I greatly respect, and you've influenced millions, without question.
You and Courtney make a perfect match both so materialistic it's a shame you guys are so disgusting you make me want to vomit
Anyone notice the candle by his bed? "This Smells Like Kourtney's Orgasm" 🤣
I just love the way he talks about Kourtney. He is so kind and nice to her. She deserves the best.
Okay well I think I make a pretty good matcha , so Travis, matcha competition?
Organic mattress? No wonder Kourt fell in love
Such a chilled guy. Happy for him & Kourt 😊
AD is the new classy cribs 😂😂
I LOVE THIS HOUSE!!!  Honestly, I watch Architecture Digest to see the architecture.  And he seems like a diwn to earth man. But,  I could care less about Kourtney Kardashian who has absolutely zero clue what it's like to work hard.  I have heard her say "iconic" so many times.  Lol. It's ridiculous.  To me, Cher is iconic.  Michele Obama, Princess Diana and her work with Aids and Land Mine clearing is iconic!!   She is not iconic in anyway....lol. it irritates me to death.  And to see yet another Kardashian invade my line of sight makes me ill.  Sorry, just sick of them!  But this home is really cool 😎!!  Can we see some unique homes regardless of who lives there?  And solar powered homes would be cool to see!
*This* *period* *making* *a* *good* *profitable* *investment* *should* *be* *in* *every* *wise* *individuals* *list* 🔴🔴
I can’t wait til they have a baby omg !!! 🙏🙏🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 May GOD bless kravis for ever and ever amen
THE CANDLE ON THE NIGHTSTAANDD
He loves feet!
Travis voice is so.... relaxing, I remember when I was a teen, I wondered why he hardly spoke in blink-182 interviews, I definitely wouldn't get bored listening to him, he's so calm & interesting.
I love them !
He surprised me with his house I thought It would be different but I love the decor and he’s right it has colors that warmed up a home… love it!
Travis, I love it. Spacious, calming, it's modern but soft and comfortable.
I love how he loved on her with touch. Im happy for her. (Them)
Kourtney moves sooo smooth 😇 who woulda known she was building a trusted relationship with along time FRIEND🥰
Like sands in the hour glass so are our days living this life
The fact that his step daughter is still with him instead of her mom say so much about how much of a great man he is
Can anyone help explain to me why they blurred out the frames? genuine asking
What a genuine, kind, loving man. so so happy Travis is getting the respect he deserves. It's always a pleasure to hear him speak. His home is absolutely lovely, excellent vibes with that great balance of homey + sophisticated.
I was enjoying this until the camera got on Kourtney and she started talking/ sounding like Kim 🙄
That kitchen is gorgeous.
Thanks for keeping your shirt on  you seem to have a happy home  don't let others spoil it for you two individuals 😊
Not bad for a guy from Fontana!!!!
I like this guy. Very cool, very normal. I hope the Kardshian crazy does not hurt him in anyway.
Travis is so relatable,a rock god with the most soothing voice,congratulations to Kourtney and Travis on their wedding !
Finally someone who gives credit to the actual designer
Wow I didn't realize how soft this guy sounds. Looks can be deceiving.
I love that they are together ❤️ Kourtney is my favorite.
Wow Travis is such a man. Clear. Spoken. Calm. Sexy. Strong. Damn Kourtney yes yes yes you made it mama I agree here... Damn the sex must be amazing... Wow wow wow
I love how you LV the fire places the first thing I do when I get   home is put on the fire place and lamps and I feel calm and relaxed
Travis is a better match than Scott. Scott is a party boy who doesnt value his home or family and is all about showing off materialism. Travis can give Kourtney a true family.
This guy is genuine. Kourtney is lucky.
What’s the name of the color on the walls. So peaceful. I want to steal it
Please do Justin Bieber home tour
“It’s like an organic mattress.” Doesn’t get more punk rock then that.
That was amazing I loved your taste 💗💗
He has such a beautiful home.
I just know him because of his fiance but he is actually super nice
I’m so confused. This is what he sounds like? 😂😂😂 perfect definition of looks can be deceiving. He sounds so soft and gentle which is the opposite of what his aesthetic is like. He seems so likeable
He’s definitely misunderstood lol
I don't understand this change of Scott for this character
I see the Aries touch!! You got the best K #kourtney
Perfect couple some of Kourtney styles
Who?
https://youtube.com/channel/UCdFYS3wKmKrZMft86C608nQ
Very laid-back.  Kourtney is a winner
He bought that house 16years ago.   That means he has had money for a Looooooooooong time.
His energy is so soothing, I get it Kourtney.
Beautiful house!
So amazing- I love the zen vibe
So happy you guys found eachother. All the best guys❤️❤️😍😍🥰🥰 love watching you guys together
Beautiful home. He has great taste
WTF happened to you Travis......
What a lovely guy, he’s so down to earth xxx
His voice doesn't match his vibe at all. he's super soft spoken but gives off a brash loud vibe
WTF are you wearing
He’s voice is so calm, it gives such amazingly relaxing vibe. Love it. 👍🏻
Nice Sid Vicious canvas 😊
That moron should quit heroin, looks awful
Beautiful home! Family environment. So happy for both Courtney and Travis!! They fit each other perfectly!! Congratulations 🎊🍾🎈
Great House 👍🏽💕
This video was so surprisingly calming. Big up yourself, Travis! You got some good vibes.
I didn’t know Travis is so cool, calm and collected. His classy home and his love for his family says it all. Now we know why Kourtney fell hard for this sweetest soul ❤️Love rules 🌹
Beautiful house, the design is perfect!.  Cool guy with a nice calm voice. He seems chill. Not a fan of how he looks but that's not my business
I find him so hansome his style and so kool how he has his tatoos very chic  his tatoos fits him please Mr Travis dont put tatoos on your face you look so kool just like that ........
Been a fan of Travis since day dot  he has always been down to earth...
I am actually very glad to watch this as now my perception of him has completely changed, he is perfect as a man as a husband as a father. His home is beautiful i would have never imagined him to having such a superbly designed home. It sure is true you can definitely never judge a book by its cover and he has proved this just by existing ❤️
HE IS VERY HUMBLE SUCH A GOOD HUSBAND AND DAD,  HE APPRECIATES LIFE PLAIN AND SIMPLE...
😍HIS VOICE😍
Now go find his MTV Cribs episode from the early 2000s 😊
Oh wow he's so calm and know exactly what he wants out of his living space. Beautiful couple may God continue to bless you both with pure happiness with y'all family including kids and dogs...Travis Barker a humble soul 🙏
I am convinced that this guy is the male version of Kourtny
Travis is more famous than Kourtney right?   I'm a Travis fan him and YB should do something together.
“Extra ping-ball balls because we loose them all the time” in out exquisitely clean lounge room. …😂
He uses like 10 words to say something that could take simply two.  Travis “I have 100 speakers so it sounds like a movie theatre where you have all these different things going on around you”  Translation- my home theatre has surround sound.
Matcha is my favorite! I love Travis 🥺...such a cool guy.
Kourtney is literally the mvp of the family... she broke off engagement with scott years ago.. because she saw scott wasn't the one & she was so right, years later Scott cheated on her in 2015. her sisters got married so many times while she didn't believe in marriage, took her time and finally found THE ONE & married him! 🎉 Kourt is the true mvp
He seems very well balanced and responsible. I pray their marriage works out 🙏🏽
Dude needs to eat a hamburger he looking like he gonna pass out 💀
Is that a kardashian
Thumbs up👍 next to Alicia Keys and her hubby's house tour, this one is definitely my second favorite 🙂👍
I like his house, his vibe & his voice is super chill🥰
Thank you Travis for the warning of mattresses. I'm going to change mine now. Lol
Yo YouTube what’s up!?
Wow him and Kourtney are so aligned with one another... God bless their union
4:00 hahahahaha  this is hollywood at its worst haha, how fake
is this guy even physically and methally healthy? What a vague portrait haha
I would love to send him one of my homemade candles, a real tranquil one
Beautiful home and chill style 👌
Beautiful home xxxx
I could never imagine Travis being like this 20years ago. This is crazy haha! That jumpsuit is crazy aswell, what’s going on ;) Nah I’m glad he’s doing well, I’ve always liked Travis he’s seems like a good together kind of person
I cant take how much im in love with them!!!!they seem to be  Absolutely perfect for each other🙌🥰😍🎊🫂❤❤❤❤❤
I bet he's bitterly regretting all those ridiculous tattoos
Seems a nice guy
Kourtney is THE only One of her family that is into White guys lol . Travis  He looks like such down to Earth person . Good job 🤗🤗
that painting kourtney gifted him, was so thoughtful ❤
Love  this video. I 'm so happy  for the both of you.  Love the house.
What was he talking about matresses??????
so punk rock
I'm a maximalist at heart, but this home definitely appeals to my decor pallet. I hope you hold on to it for eternity! There is a tranquility and peace in the atmosphere! Congratulations on your wedding to the beautiful lady. Continue to love and cherish her. Love is what you make it! ❤️
Looking like his 19
I wasn’t expecting how nice it looks inside .I was expecting skulls everywhere .
The NO CELL PHONES standard is what's missing in many families‼️ Travis is making sure he is "In Tune" of what's going on in his family's life & big on spending QUALITY time. They literally have his undivided attention😌‼️... Kourtney, I get it girl. I get it 😌🤗
Doesn't look like anything he would have decorated... this is Kartrashian's influence with their decorators.
He feels like one of the coolest, down to earth humans ever to land on earth. 🙏🏾
I’m sure you not happy inside
This guy sucks and so does his shwag music
So he has tons of tattoos and piercings on his body but his home is bland modern chic banal .. he likes hard music and rock but drives luxury  cars … makes no sense but I guess the masses gobble up the garbage that feeds this nonsensical world of his .. yikes
Nice house but it just looks out dated .... the vibe is 80’s
Nice house
I thought thdy were going to start humping each other when he introduced Kourtney lmao 😂
So sweet how he mentions his kids every 2 mins. Honestly did not expect that. Seems like a cool guy. ❤️
..love how this house is so classic and minimal..👍❣️
Really homely and peaceful love it heres to more beautiful memories shared at home with family xx
What ??
They seemed to be very compatible. I see Kourt with him than I can see with Scott Disick. Travis is more of her style..
His house is so calming
So you can take in some Ukrainians
Loved this guy , from the first interview I saw of him.Hope they are just happy always.
Why is he dressed like a nazi and she like a concentrationcamp prisoner? Is it some kind of kinky thing?
I love them together ❤️
I love him.
Not a fan of rock music but I’ve always liked his vibe. Hard core is still one of my favs. He’s been chill for years! I was so happy when he survived the crash. I hope he and Kourtney and their family have a lifetime of happiness ♥️
He is sounds like Adam Levine.
I’ve never heard him speak before. Based off this video, I’m starting to like him
Kourtney, just go sit on a sofa or use a desk, you re obviously uncomfortable with your laptop on that counter
Anyone else notice the candle at 10:29? “This  Smells Like Kourtney’s Orgasm” lol
He seems like an actual nice guy. No wonder Kourtney locked him down.
Stop saying Matcha, you idiots.
I love Travis he is so humble. His energy is impeccable.
Beautiful!
He proposed on the first day they were more than friends? I thought there was lots of pics of them before that day?
all in all, the guy really loves a good fireplace 😆
Jesus… did I just fall in love with this man??
Travis Barker has the same voice as Faze Rug
Love this videos ❤ good job
I hate his art. Ugh. I like him but I don’t see any of Courtney in here.
quattro libri in croce usati come soprammobili
Well...I'm kinda disappointed.....its a normal house.....??? With all his money....??? Really nothing to show....
Not 1 blink 182 mention?
I thought his voice would be like deep and husky but ngl, his voice is so soothing.
Like like like like. Oh vey!!  I wouldn’t  last 5 minutes on that furniture.
All the years I’ve seen Travis I never would have expected him to be who he is. Just goes to show you never know some just bc they are famous.
he's just the most adorable guy ever!
Kourtney and Travis are beautiful together. So glad they fell in love
Nice
Que casa maravilhosa! Tão clean, sofisticada e minimalista. Wow 🙌
He has a beautiful home. He is  sentimental and a romantic...notice the things that means a lot to him? Happy for both of them and their family.

Is this a skit?

Absolutely love this house! But tell me I am the only one who saw the candle that says "this smells like Kourtney's orgasm" at 10:27????? This couple is everything, I love it!
So happy for Kourtney and Travis , wish them all the happiness forever and ever💐💐💐💐💐
BORING. FITS YOU WELL.
He said "i wish you guys can feel my vibrating bed but you cant " lol... he seems so calm and down to earth
spiritual
Regular humans: I don't see any reason to sit on the kitchen's marble with my laptop, I have a table. Kourtney: 03:55
"Before we were together we used to spoil each other" That is such a Hollywood statement...
So cool how he respects time with his family and his love for K.
Kourtney is so lucky to have this great man, but I have to admit they do seem like a perfect match. 🥰
Look at the picture of the arse above the sofa
Somehow has no personality ..
Excess is gross
He looks so dumb. I love Travis , he was such a good stepdad and boyfriend on his other reality TV show. I wish Kourtney didn't change her entire style to Goth since she started dating him. She used to have such a cute buyable look. But this video is CAP because they just started dating last year.... laughing at him saying that she bought him gifts 3 Christmas's ago she was with the cute young model.
7:20 that ping pong table is 19,000$ 😂😂😂😂
Love it!
These people always have the most dull homes 🙈
I need me a Travis in my life he has the best of both worlds bad boy/ family man
What a gentleman. Classy.  Not familiar beforehand. So pleasant intro. Wishing the happy couple the very best
Finally, a house I’m not jealous of lol 😝
Notice how he notices kourts kids seating arrangement ....like bro worry about ur kids first
How much I work ...how much Kourtney works...ah ah ah ah don't take credit for nothing about kourt...u just met her
Feels like all houses in calabasas have same architecture.. kim, kourt also similar like this
His energy is so calm
I love this sweet guy. So beyond happy for him & Kourt.
How do you know someone is a vegan? Don’t worry they’ll tell you
Seeing the grand national was a treat. 🤘
Boringggggg
Wow he is so calm, grounded & down to earth. He has a great vibe yet is sophisticated at the same time. Very soft spoke such a soothing voice & energy.
He’s so calm the way he speak 🥺❤️
Is this cribs ?
Wow, had no idea he was so humble and genuine... rare for fame.
Did y’all see the candle in his nightstand , I absolutely love them ♥️🖤
Wow his closet is so organized lol need to be like Travis lol
Wow. I did not expect this. Travis is such a gentle, calm person and I love his home. You can tell that it's actually lived in.
Its so unreal how so many people are shocked that he wouldn't be the typical artist to move every few years and that he's really a normal humble man. Even back in Blink he was always so down to earth and himself, not thirsty for fame or being in the spotlight. I'm so happy for Kourtney. This was definitely meant to be, at this time of both of their lives.
“Like”
Amazing design !!!! I love the vibe of that house …. So chill …
Sweet guy
Oh don’t mind me, just working on my kitchen counter.
He's has a good vibe!!  All the best to both of them.
Beautiful home.
Organic bed..NICE
you have a lovely home
His voice is so soothing, his personality seems so cute! I see you why kourtney fell for him! He seems really down to earth and goofy (in a good way) in that little interaction he had with his daughter. Also affectionate, the way he rubbed kourtneys legs in that short 3 seconds interaction with her. Never judge a book by its cover. He looks tough, but he seems to have a soft side when it comes to the heart.
While she stinks of Sriracha and pork
The sentimental value that he holds for the things Kourt has gifted him is truly beautiful 🖤
I like the house
why do artists decide to live in southern california??? I mean really all you have is left wing crazies and CRIME EVERYWHERE. CLOUT ISN'T EVERYTHING JESUS.....
Love them both! They compliment each other so well! Beautiful home for a beautiful family!
Love you both so happy for you and your beautiful family blessings
Seems like a pretty cool dude congrats to him on all his success
Man team kravis.... he a great dad a step-dad and now super step-dad. How he totally involves all the children. Kourtney is on cloud nine. 👏
Weird that Kourtney bought him almost exact same car but better that Shannon surprised him with for his birthday on their reality show. 🧐❔
Thank you for sharing your house with the world, it is beautiful 🤩!!!
Kourtney used to always say she can’t be away from her kids for more than an hour. I thought I was about to see ONE video with just him that they’re not mooching in. Nope!  Lol she’s thereeeee!  Scots gonna be a full time dad pretty soon.  But I really hope this works out
First off they're literally so cute together. And listening to him talk made me feel really relaxed. That says a lot about him. ❤️
Kort did gd in picking this man. He’s responsible and Responsible!! 👏👏👏
This is a perfect " don't judge a book by its cover"
What a lovely house for lovely couple
Let me find out La bron Did not pick up his bike  super dope bikes 🚲
Aside from those red flutes, I love that it’s all cool colors and earth tones. The green in the cinema, other blues and greens on other upholstery. Even the rust velvel. Love it. Can’t stand primary color, warm colors. Yuck. This is super chill.
You gotta love the chill of Travis. In a time where everyone is so loud and hype, he's just laid back California skater chill.
Beautiful, calm and peaceful home. Travis is so humble and sincere, a lovely man. Best wishes from the UK 🇬🇧
Seriously, I didn't follow Blink 182 in the 90s, but thanks to Kourtney K, have become a fan. I am all about keeping it simple and appreciate the approach to the interior, but the examples of vintage shirts made my day. Bauhaus, Public Enemy, The Cramps, My 80s childhood trifecta. Nice!
This is where we eat, we move the giant fern out of our way most of the time, but I’m vegan so after I have my tincture I occasionally eat a small piece of the family fern just to treat myself. I tell kort sometimes you just gotta do you and make sure the vibes right. Keep a positive headspace.
They are already married so this video is old lol.
Nice house I love the kitchen💖💖
🥲🥲🥲🥲 miar beautiful blended family! 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
Love it thankyou for sharing... I love family happy days always from NZ
Calm dude!
Love the house and the decor. Travis has a very positive vibe to him. Cute couple.
Travis is such a dope person! His house really shows us who he really is, like homie is super chill and relatable.
I am Japanese but don’t have a matcha station at home. Well..I don’t really drink matcha at all. So cool
is that a leather jump suit? lmao
His outfit is so terrible. Ugh
He’s seems so nice.
This man has such good manners.
I had no idea that Courtney was dating/married this guy.
No one told him how lame the jumpsuit looks.
He seems like a really nice guy. Very catering and loving
WE need the matcha recipe!!!
I just wanna be on covers
She’s definitelywith him for his money
He is so gentle. I’m such a fan
He is so gentle. I’m such a fan
He’s not what I expected. Kourt is lucky
I love him… he’s mindful and very insightful. I can truly see why Kourt loves him!!! Love wins❤️❤️❤️🥰🥰
He is perfect for Kortney!!!! Very chill and don’t want to be around a lot of people and all about family. I love that for them. They’re perfect for each other. I totally get it
Their marriage won't last. Look at all the guys they dated and married.  This isn't going to age well. The Kardashians have a way to make men run away. Good luck.
So do u practise evil worship,?? Jus asking
So impressed by Travis' vibe. He seems like a real humble connected guy❤️
Travis Barker is a legend. He’s so humble and proud of his kids. He loves being a dad and it oozes from him. It’s so wonderful to see. Kids kids adore him, too. And then he sits behind a drum set like a killa 🥁 💪🏼🤘🏼
I love his house and I love his energy. And love how he cares for his family
i love travisss.. seems like a real solid dude
I love his personality he is so down to earth and he clearly loves Court ❤️
He is such a cool good spirited man. This is why I have never prejudiced a person that I don't know. This video of him made me realize no one should judge a person. With a bunch of tattoos. I'm so happy for him and Kourtney they found real ❤.  She looks so very happy finally you win beautiful.
*damn don't judge a book by its covers. Travis' personality is literally the opposite to how he looks*
😭😭😭😭😭😭 bro he loves her sm.
Kourtney’s album painting gift is amazing!!
🔥🔥🔥
He is great, but I don't like him w her....but live ya life and watch your back. Hopefully she doesn't ruin you
What a Boring Person
Not sure about his outfit though....
Kourtney hit the jackpot. He is respectful of her and so gentle. Love how he talks about the kids🤗
Eating vegan is why you look like a walking skeleton
Loved hearing that he geared his house around his kids! Great dad!!
Is Travis younger than Kourtney?
He is so chill and relaxed. I love that so much
I actually like this couple over all the other Kardashian’s couples
I love Travis he has amazing energy 😍😍😍❤️❤️
This is a great example of don’t judge the tattoos over the person. He is so calm and collected.
I worked at McDonald’s in corona california and he came into the drive thru it was like 2014 and I had to park him because the food wasn’t ready and he was like “you’re gna park me?” But jokingly and I was like ya sorry. And then when he went to park I realized it was Travis barker! I was upset with myself lol
Travis you are such a humble person.  You and Kourt make such a nice couple. Your home is such a peaceful environment.  Beautiful!!! Thank you for sharing.
This is such a roast to Lord Disick 😂
His “gf”. Looks old Asf
PUNK!!!
Kourtney really doesn't have to be sitting there and come out dressed like that on Tv 😂 but hey she looks happy. Lol
I want to come over! So  peaceful
I wish you both many years of happiness together!
You may want to rethink turning on the gas fireplace that often if it is using natural gas.  Natural gas is a very dangerous fossil fuel, especially for children.
I had never really heard him speak. I thought the voice would be deeper by his looks.'but he seems so welcoming and calm and zen ✌🏻
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwtQD9ioOc4  here is an episode of Cribs he did ages ago, enjoy!
A gorgeous home, loved it! A true home to live in❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
So sweet
Lol Kourtney just randomly sitting on the counter top😂
i never got the hype for this man his drumming style isn't for me but totally love his vibe how calming he is/sounds. a 16 year house is AMAZING  because celebrities move a TON so seeing him never moving basically for 16 years says a lot
Travis, instead of becoming a Kardashian and helping MGK, why don't you ask your old friend Tom Delonge to come back to Blink-182? Your an amazing drummer, and rock star, don't reduce to that level man.   And yes, I know he's technically not the original drummer, but he's what made Blink-182 popular.
His house is lovely x
He seems so lovely but look wise I’m shocked this is kourtneys taste tbh. He does seem so zen and calming but yet dark x
The best thing is that she looks pleased, after so many years.
This house is definitely a home! I love how he talks about Kourtney, the kids and all the memories they have made in this home. May they all have many more to come!
Kort you found a gem! Enjoy your life and ❤️
Now I need an organic mattress😩
He’s perfect for her 🤍
I want his pool. It's beautiful
No wonder Kourt fell in love with him,such a chilled out dude wit the nicest sexest style.
Such a great guy, proud of his family and beautiful home...he's loved her so long..and still so fresh. #couplegoals
He has the most calming voice ever! I would love for him to record meditation…
Men, this guy forever rich, when he young he rich, when he at 40's he still rich and still got exposure like he was young, bless you and your family
Señor Adonay ten piedad de Travis de que NUNCA se rinda de luchar su vida como trabajador, proveedor, padre de los muchachos y esposo idóneo en su hogar de familia. Bendice también a Kourtney Kardashian como mujer sabia del hogar.  YaHWeH Dios le bendiga cada día. Shalom 🙏🏻✝️✡️🇮🇱
Travis is incredibly fascinating and seems like such a cool dude. His home is beautiful!
I’ve always thought they’d make a great couple. I absolutely love happiness for Kourt. Idgaf how much people try to bring Kim into it, Trav is for Kourt. I stopped watching the family but I’d love to watch these two and the kids on a spin off 👏🏾🥰💕
Love that they're all about family and play board games and put puzzles together. Very nice and peacefully decorated home.
This dude is the real deal. I’m happy for him.
What a genuine and nice guy.  Beautiful home for his family.
I always am curious on how do they clean a big, full of things house like this?
I recognized the windows in the studio from all the videos he released during covid or whenever!!. Also I think the front doors is from Bloody Valentine (The Late Late Show With James Corden At Home Performance 2020) where they played on the porch. I just adore Travis. He has a very calming soul.
Love how he mentions Kourtney 👍👍
They are definitely soulmates. Great match!
I’ll give it 8 months.
I really love the curve windows.  The colors that he has chosen does give it a very zen vibe.  If I had the money, I would definitely hire Waldo to remodel my house into a mini version of Travis’s house.  I live in central Midwest in a medium size home.  I wished my midwest salary would be enough to hire a professional who has Waldo’s visions.
I can see why she likes him.
Freaking  #LEGEND  🔥🔥
Love that he’s been there for along time🙏🏾🤍
I can totally see why Kourtney loves him!!!
What a nice man
He frames P's doodle?? OMG who does that?? wanna cry cuz I haven't found my person.
Say it with me......CLONE.
What a chill dude ...
Travis looks like a great dad. And the way he speaks just proves that he’s cool, calm & just being himself
We’ll Said. “ Very Eloquent “
How can someone who looks like that. Have a sane  nice  place like that
Surprise !
He has such a soothing voice.
He seems super dope...
This dude is a f in mess with an f in mess hagg.  But loaded.
The windows and beams❤️. He really made me want some matcha
They are such Soulmates.  You can feel his mellow vibe and how it matches her honesty.  Many years of happiness to them both. CONGRATULATIONS KOURTNEY & TRAVIS BARKER 💕💕
I'm happy for Travis. He's been such an influential person in the rock scene and to see the peace he brings Kourtney is very fulfilling. I hope they have a happy ever after.
Love his calm demeanor and how he expresses his love for Kourtney.
This video is the definition of “don’t judge a book by its cover”
So bool, balm and bollective
Wth hell is he wearing 😂very materialistic. These people do nothing to help the poor , weird. When they die can't take nothing with you !
Wow this is the most in-depth house tour I’ve seen! he is really a dope dude!
Nice
anyone else is like relieved hearing travis talk? or is it just me? cause his voice is so calming
The whole time before I saw this video I always thought that they are a weird couple like they don’t match but hearing him talk they are a perfect match they are the same
I don't know why I feel Zen..
I swear to god between  this and the Kardashian stuff this dude is an absolute clown 🤡.  Love the house though.
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME WHY THE PILLOW MOVES AT 10:58 WTF!!!! IS THAT A GHOST!?!?!?!?
The way he walks around the table like he’s a warden assigning seating arrangements 😂 “it’s always this way” Mark my words this man is toxic and covering his 🚩 with this vegan tranquil vibe. Merely an aesthetic and it will come out in the media once they get a divorce
Kourt in the background smiling like 🙌🏾 I’m teaching him well 😆 you can tell she is so proud and excited that he gets it lol
I enjoyed this video, Congratulations on your marriage. It’s great when you find someone so you.🌹
I like it relaxing not a bunch of colors kind of simple but luxurious
What are Travis's 5 favorite albums?
https://youtube.com/channel/UC_nOjNmFA5TlWCVy-Kxloag
I'm always shocked that people don't know what a soft spoken, kind soul he is and he's always been like that. Even back in the Meet The Barkers days he was the absolute sweetest and most polite person, and a fantastic, attentive dad. Kourt did well for herself.
wow i love his personality
How many times did he say kourt. So annoying
God I love them together ❤️ the softness in his voice I wish you nothing but happiness Travis + Kourtney ✌🏼
How punk rock to live in a multi-million dollars
I’m surprised that this hasn’t turned into a meme
Travis is a good dude. 👍🏾
i would love to be friends with him
This alien in his space suit has done better than most.  We will certainly be overrun by our Martian overlords.
He is so soft spoken but a beast on the drums!
LOL he was SO inconsistent with his narrative throughout the video...
This man is a original af
He seems so humble and down to earth! Judging him from his appearance he would have looked more crazy dude with no stability...but he is a box of surprises! Good for her 👏 I think she found a good man.
Is it me or are these people just weird I don't like a dirty house I like everything to be clean I get a bad vibe from a dirty house but yet allow my kids did trash my home with dirt bike that's a smart idea
I love it, I would totally buy it if I had the coin haha
She was so lucky to have waited for a real MAN as he is instead of someone like Scott! He seems to be really STABLED, CONGRATULATIONS Courtney & Travis🌹🌹🌹🌹🌹🎶🎵🥰❤️❤️❤️
such a down to earth person , refreshing
What are the 5 albums that changed his life (in the painting)?   Operation Ivy - Energy Pink Floyd - The Wall Dr. Dre - The Chronic? ??? ???
Aw, 100% see why Courtney is so in love. I fell in love with Travis voice, calmness, home and family values. Great tour and wish your blended families a fabulous future 😍💖🥰 xXx
"This smells like Kourtney's Orgasm" 10:28 lmao
How can a house look so basic so.. simple and affordable but SOOO EXPENSIVELY RICH💀he just called me poor in so many different languages
P is definitely awesome! I just love the pic she drew for Travis. She knows his style! I also love that he put it in a frame and just more memories for that wonderful home to have. Ok the Bewick is sick!
oh man... Kardashian has my boy wearing a leather trash bag
so if he’s vegan is that just a pleather jumpsuit? lmao
This house is beautiful but I feel like I'm the only person alive who gets weird vibes from Travis, always have.
With all the crazy physical stuff Travis does it’s hard to believe he’s in his 40’s lol though his house does really show it
Awesome house 🏘️
We need an ASMR video with Travis and Kourtney.
it's A very Tranquil Place Mr.Travis Barker ,+Very Happy place +Welcoming For Your New Blended Fam ,Congrats +,/God Bless To U ,Kourtney +Family ,Rae From Boston Ma
I literally watched from beginning to end. That good!
Loved this tour. He’s got such a kind soul. Kourtney really found a good one
I love how he has so many memories in that home.It’s honestly really beautiful he is so soft spoken and makes Kourtney smile so big.💖
Extraordinary beautiful house
He looks like a tattooed-bald Celine Dion
Lol Kourtney’s orgasm candle
I love how there is 100 speakers in that room and you can't see any of them.  That's high end interior design...
I can see why Kourtney fell in love with him...great guy. Loves his kids, family, doesn't swear...he just seems so peaceful. 🥰
I love his soft demeanor/tone/ and he shared memories of his house….simple no showing off love that. Minimalistic and focused on family
I love the simplicity of his home
Yeah baby
gross
I wana be the 3rd party in this marriage 😂😂😂
Am I the ONLY person that thinks his house is 🥱🥱🤔
Be careful with that with your new witches family here ur now a part of I pray God makes away out for you and that you’re not little Sloth like her ex that she kept around till she was done and met someone else it’s sad what happened to his parents keep your children away from them please
Where’s ur soul man
I was fully prepared to not like this tour at all.  While it is not my aesthetic at all, it is lovely.
He loves vegan everything him and kourt we’re meant for eachother
his home looks like a home
Love Travis, grew up on Blink 182. He seems like such a calm guy.
I thought he was strange until I seen this video he is a nice man 16yrs n one house ❤️❤️
Beautiful home.  So homely.
Omg hes so calm i love his  vibe ❤
He just has this soothing persona.  Also, I love how he is so involve with his children.
Wait…Kourtney works?!  Beautiful & peaceful!
Am a fan now cos don’t judge the book by its cover
I don't know this guy, I don't know what it is but I like him ..... Chill vibes
He’s got that maximum security inmate look down pat 🤣
They look so genuinely happy. That's awesome!
Such a decent guy and his home is so homely and beautiful.
Him and kourtney are so perfect for each other like they literally have the same spirit. Like the way they talk about things and love their children.
Alabama >>>>
Love Travis
I now regret not becoming a famous drummer when I was younger.  Follow your dreams and don't listen to your idiotic high school counselors.
Oh I didn't expect his house to look like this! It's SO, SO Nice! It's prefect! Of all the houses I've ever seen in my entire life this is more my style than any of them ...and I do mean *_EVER!_*
So who’s house will they move too. Travis’s or Kortneys? They both have beautiful homes. Maybe keep both?
Shame he’s connected to a Kardashian.  Spells doom.
Weeeiiirrrrrrdd
I love Matcha and Kourtney is my favorite Kardashian she deserves to be happy. Love your house as well.
Such a beautiful home❤️  I loved the closet lol
I've never heard him speak, his voice is so soothing.
@travisbarker open up your own Matcha spot called "Matcha Station" pls
It still surprises me how soft spoken Travis is. He seems like a really nice guy too
He’s just so cool I stg
I have a detached 4 car garage with 12 lifts for all my toys
Devil is in the details. Literally. Devils can be soft spoken & charming.
This video made me realize how much of a perfect match Kourtney and Travis are
I absolutely love it ❤️… the vibes you give off! Just seeing who you truly are!! I’ve never really know anything about you till you and kourtney pop off and I love learning so much about you and what kind of person you’re!! Just so down to earth ❤️❤️
I love how he always says our. This is our game room, this is our kitchen table. It’s not mine. This shows how much of a family man he is and this isn’t just materialistic feature of “look how much stuff I have”. He truly looks at this as our family home! Very refreshing to see!
I enjoyed watching the interview
This guy has good taste
He try’s to act like Scott to much go watch his old school blink 182 days on cribs totally different person …
They are soooooo perfect together
What a surprise indeed. Never judge the book by its cover. I never knew Travis is such a well spoken and very articulate person. The way he talked about certain things anout his house you would know he actually knew what he was talking about unlike some other celebs that I have watch being featured here. I6 yrs would tell you a lot what kind of people who lives in that house.
I have a different perspective on this apparently cool guy with the tattoos.😊 be happy together.
Wish I could feel the vibrating bed an not this Air Mattress
I love the way he talks about his children, he mentions his children a lot. The house is really nice and cosy.I hope the best for Kourtney and Travis.
The comments here must be made up of at least 95% bots. Everyone going on about how humble he is and not materialistic or bragging....lol He is the exact opposite of the culture'/scene that he claims to love so much. In what world would a so-called "punk rocker" brag to the main stream/home and garden  type of people, showing off your multi-million dollar house and your cards which cost as much as most people pay for their house. Just because he talks quietly doesnt make him "humble". He clearly lives an ostentatious life. Owning a $20K gold Dior BMX bike?!?! Besides that actual price of the bike, the fact that a punk bmx skater would be proud of his Dior bike is really douchey. I'm sure he's a great guy, but being humble is not one of his attributes. He's actually quite pretentious
His home is exquisite and 16 years in one house is inspiring. He is also a vegan and organic and his fiancee played her position well in this.
Didn't know how I felt about Travis but God I love him now❤️ he's calm and humble and sweet so happy for Kourtney tbh, she bagged a good one there
Oh wow! He really is a sweetheart.  I see why Kourtney is crazy about him. His spirit is so beautiful.
This man gave two kids and still wanted to raise he’s ex wife  daughter wow good man
He may not be the best looking guy out there or the sexiest but he seems nice & that's all that matters.
I could be wrong here, but I don't think he's human..?
Love this dude, quality guy. Kourtney married up!
Travis’s home is absolutely beautiful and calming. Sad to say I’ve never paid much attention to him or even heard him speak. His energy is also very calm and he seems like such a kind person! Thank you for the tour, Travis 🌺
hes really in love with her and she in love with him he gushes over her so much all the little taughts and things he remembers wishing you guys a happy life and gods richest blessings.
Definitely thought we will see skulls and skeletons all over but okkkk proved me wrong. Lol
I’m amazed by his great personality!
Ok so the fact that he has been living in the same house for 16yrs..wow, super eccentric creative and intelligent,  and he has a big heart...oosh,  all of this says alot about him!🙌
I'm happy for them they really seem like a dream couple
I could listen to him talk all day. What a calm presence and so well spoken.
He has done reality TV before. With first wife I truly enjoyed the show. Maybe he and Kourtney do the same. I would watch.
Wow this is the 1st time ive eva heard Travis speck he seems very genuine
His home is so beautiful and amazing🤍
may I say? boOOOOOOring
I love the way he speaks. His voice is calming
The man looks like death!
He is so soft spoken and cool ❤❤ I love him for Kourtney
kourtney just seems fake to me,he can do better
I never heard of Travis barker until recently when I saw kourtney was engaged, and this is the first thing I’ve ever seen of him and I am completely in love with this man from this video I haven’t listened to his movie and I don’t know anything about him but now I have so much respect for him solely from this video
Amazing and stylish interior design
Kourtney sitting on the island “working” on the laptop is the weirdest thing lol
He seems like the nicest guy.  It's really sweet to see them so happy.  Everyone deserves a great love in their life.
Nice to know you , Mr Barker .
He has a soothing voice and calming energy. I see why she loves him!
Heel erg mooi 💯❤🙏🏽✌🏽💪🏾
Congratulations 🎊🍾🎉 newly wed! 💕
Awe he’s so sweet .. love him!
Why don’t you show them, the matcha  station …. Sooo this is my matcha  station!  😂 killed me
Lol where is Scott's seat.😂😂
He seems like a very nice person.
Love the house. Thanks for inside look. Not too flashy like others. Modest home for a great musician. Great place as u said to just relax. Very nice and peaceful ✌️
wtf how the hell this dude pull that 😳 off man money 💰 goes a long way🤣🤦🏿‍♂️🤷🏿‍♂️
Does anyone know what style this is? There are minimalist elements but also really cool art pieces that I really love, I am looking for more inspiration, does anyone have websites or anything I can get references from?
His voice is so soothing!
Here we go again! Bragging again. Now it’s his home what else is there to say. I know, how they wipe their fat butts in the bathroom.
Travis Barker is truly the definition of=You can’t judge a book by its cover! When he speaks you can hear exactly why Kourtney said “I Do!” 🥰
Absolutely beautiful
Daaaamn he said 🍵 better than Alfred’s Aaaand Cha Cha Matcha. He needs to open a place and make it. I’d buy it. Also I once saw Travis at Alfred’s and I wanted to ask him for a pic so bad. Lol. But ya gotta let a man live ya know. But I low key geeked out as I used to listen to Blink growing up.
Sasha XXX 😡
Dude is truly a Freakshow. I see suicide after the divorce
I hope they are very happy they seem well suited for each other. I wish them nothing but happiness for their future. Great home.
The candle by the bed is called "this smells like Kourtney's orgasm" 💀
Kourtney seems like a different person now.  Travis is a great guy.
Gorgeous, calm surroundings. Love the minimal feel, color pallette, energy of the home.. Gorgeous space for a beautiful family. Wishing you lots of peace, love, happiness,  & joy!
Wow...now I understand why Courtney is so in love with this gentleman. I feel so bad for myself thinking that this guy was probably a  bad influence because of his tattoos. The house look full of love, peace and joy. Wish you the best Travis. I am your new fan!!
Beautiful home a family home not over the top
He seems so sweet and kind!  I don't know why his looks kind of scared me at first, but now that I hear him, I really like him.  Kourtney and Travis make a great couple.
I remember this house when he was married to Shana with small children. They had a reality show back in the gap😂
Real shame , she going take all ur money Travis
When he said “Matt McCormick” my heart dropped. For those who don’t know, that’s Mac millers brother.
"This smells like Kourtney's orgasm" candle @ 10:29..... did anyone else catch that?!
This is cringe af I stopped watching at 4:04
If I am always welcome at ur house, I will book a flight now. Wow here I come. Ur gorgeous. Do u have a single friend. Canada Ontario
Beautiful house, nothing else to say. Perfection.
I love how soft spoken his :)
Linda casa.
I love you Travis 😍  Kourtney is lucky and so are you...
I'm so glad I watched this to see what kind of person he is. He is so much more chilled than I had expected. Love how he doesn't like his home cluttered, very impressive indeed.
this man is the definition of (dont judge a book by its cover)
🤮🤮🤮👎🏻👎🏻
Ive always loved this guy.....never even  heard him speak until now. Love him even more. He's the male version of Kourtney...even this home looks similar to hers...extremely family focused.
This guy is my idol reason why i fell in love with drumming i named my 1st born after him and to my suprise my 2nd child have the same birthdate as him more power to you and kourtney!!
not the kourtney😭🤡
16 years living in the house says a lot!!  A really family man
Wonder how he'd look without the tattoos.   Yes, he seems smitten by her.
I guess we can't expect to see their epic pda... this house is nice
Dying at the bedside candle scent 😂
Just read the comments after writing mine. This is not a house tour, this is a presentation of how amazing Travis is.
Im sorry but the way he talks 🤣🤣🤣😭😭
I love that he says 3 kids because he basically raised his step daughter attiana ( Landon and Alabamas sister ) and he includes her in everything !
3days ago Travis : this is my fiancé Today: she's her wife
Travis is so soft spoken, I love to listen to him. He seems to find family very important, it’s so important in a relationship. He seems like a great person. Great catch Kourtney! & the house looks amazing.
By far the best open house video! 16 years in the same home speaks volumes.
A BEAUTIFUL!!!! BLESSING!!! 🙏🏽❤️
I've never heard him speak and I've ever imagined his voice to be so soothing and calming
I’ve watched a couple videos of Travis as of late, and he seems like such a cool, non confrontational person. I think Kourtney has herself a gem. I wish them the best.
Πολυ ωραιο μεταφρσση στα ελληνικα θελουμε🇬🇷
honstley there just cringy and kourtney looks old asf
Que casa bonita, sobretudo, o branco e o preto dão um charme pra casa desse casal cheio de estilo e personalidade.
I love how he acts excatly opposite of how he looks or how you would “think” he would act or speak
hello, why are you blurring some artwork?
He dresses like he is blind n dont know how to dress himself
If you all go down everyone’s comments here  . They all start sounding like one person wrote it . They all say . “He has a calming soothing voice” . “He’s such a family man”  . “He’s such a great dad. “But funny no body says anything else lol … idk . It just sounds weird .Don’t believe me . Look down ..
Travis Barker Jesus Loves You Lead the Way
I see what Kourt loves about him the hardest looking guys always are the softest sweetest gentlemen. His look gives you Scott meanwhile Scott’s clean look gives you Travis.
I see why Kourtney loves this guy. He is super chill…
So this is like MTV Cribs, but classier...
Kourtney look so relaxed and comfortable you can feel the love coming from her. Well done Travis you are great you brought out the love in her
Luv the house 🏠....not too much...convient yet conventional 💓
Won't sleep on a 'toxic' mattress but I bet he swims in that pool full of chlorine smh
My first luxury car was a Cadillac and yea theres more for your money then what the competition is for the price range.
Travis is a clown
He won the jackpot!!
Guy looks like a pschotic weirdo who has health issues, house is stunning tho
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
16 years ?? Yeah that boy is grounded hes giving out good vibes
Nobody cares!
So humble and kind! I have to admitted I prejudged……my bad!!!
I can't speak on his personal relationships with people  or how they view him . But OMG  he seem so sweet and calm . Just so sweet . Omg ... He like a beast on drums and when he walk off he so chill 😎.  I like him
Seems like a really nice guy, I wonder why things didn't work with him and Kim. Kourtney's sister...
He looks like he was produced by a three D printer.
That whole Kourtney sitting on the island drinking Matcha was soo corny... Lol but cool house tho!
Seeing your whole house had me so relaxed the whole time!! Beautiful home !!
guys i think he likes to have the fireplace on
I also liked Travis... I watched the Barkers with him and his ex wife. However I always liked that he was a bad as drummer
Trust celebs to promote designers I can't afford😭😭😭😭😭
Love a vegan king!
No wonder Kourtney loves him! He's really a calm man. She's  lucky to have him in her life. What a good example of what a calming energy should be.
Serene & gorgeous, great taste 🥰🇬🇧 p.s nice grounded guy , Kourtney seems happy & relaxed 😌 x
She married a druggie
His voice is very calming
what an amazing house and tour! thank you. I just miss joy in your telling about it but i guess its a sort of job for you to do... i wish you passion from within and love and joy. You have an amazing life. Enjoy it. i am happy for you you realized so much.
I love the sound of his voice
I have loved Travis since meet the barkers . He has always shown the public that he is a great father, a good person and a generous partner
after watching this it inspires me to work hard even more. one day i will get where i need to be. we all will 🙏🏻
IT'S GIVING ✨SOPHISTICATED PAM AND TOMMY✨VIBES
Family man Travis! ❤ Love your home interior design. So sophisticated and beautiful! Nice Dining table! ❤ Blessings to you and your lovely family.
The most entertaining one yet 🫶
The cars🤩🤩🤩Wow.
It's really not cool to judge people from their looks. I didn't expect to like this video or this guy but hearing him speak and show case his home 🤔,  he's okay in my book  now see why Kourtney loves him
I will always love his voice
I thought he was a tough man, voice and as a guy but he is the sweetest 💖😘 The house is Gorgeous!
8 people to install a ping p9ng table? They milked him on that one lol
California Trash
not his home lol
i see him & kourt why they married another person? They found each other before i am just saying they are like born each other husband & wife
This man seems so humble, he and Kourtney were made for each other
Hey its skeletor
Of all the sisters, Kourtney seems to have found a true soulmate.  I didn’t realize how earthy, ethereal and intelligent Travis is!  His home is beautiful; livable and comfortable…a truly minimalist family home!
This guy looks like my uncle lol
I love Travis, he seems so humble. Him and Kourtney make a great couple. Many blessings to you both.
Who knew he could be this vegan organic calm kind of guy lol
I probably understand y Kourt is so madly in love.. totally drawn to this guy now more than ever🙈🙈so humble😊
First time they hang out together as more than friends - this is when he proposed to her. Makes perfect sense.
Travis is just to cool 😎
OK. This was something really beautiful and true, I'm so happy I got to see this side of him. His is such a beautiful soul, you cannot fake this.
Waouh
She looks like she is obsessed with him.
I must admit I had no idea who this gentleman was and why yt algorithm suggested this video to me, but I was impressed with how intelligent he is and I really like the design - it's very calm and relaxing. I would definitely suggest more oriental accents, some Chizou maybe as it's the same palette...
His voice is so calm and soothing. First time hearing him speak.
He literally looks like he's just escaped maximum security, robbed a binman and then tried to disguise himself with the contents of a child's pencil case... 😳   Seriously, this is what devolution looks like... Talentless Zzzzlisters pretending to be relevant, and being propelled to levels of 'status' due to the corrupt music industry and Hollywood, using them as useful idiots to sell 'music' and reality TV.  Idolising these clowns, when there are people in this world with such an abundance of philosophy, supreme creativity and an infinite knowledge and wisdom truly confirms to me that I have evolved onto a very different level of consciousness and frequency that elevates my mind and spirit....and I am so grateful.   This is like looking through a vortex and seeing amateur, fake and empty puppets being played on a stage for my entertainment!! I am so glad I am free and can see through the circus. They are little toys owned by their toy town masters!!  Bless!!
He looks a little bit too much tattoos, but he actually like Zen. calm and peaceful energy. Down to earth.  👍
This is just my fiancé. Sitting on the counter,  drinking her Homemade matcha, fresh out of bed with a full face of make-up, working on her laptop in her lap. Completely normal 😂 the kardashians are too much…. I have no idea who Travis is, but he seems very sweet and peaceful.
Don’t tell me I’m the only one who saw the pillow moved😨😳
I don’t know why, but the assigned dining room seating just feels so normal, and connective. Celebs often are viewed as so above the rest, so its really nice that everyone else is getting to see how like the rest of us he is. Plus, being in a house for 16 years…. Wow.
Wow....I actually like the guy
Mocha😭
Wtf is he wearing
How many times did he mention his GF.... He must like her a lot! Weird match up but good for him!
Helped build the house right across the street from Travis's house .. the people had a Persian rug store, seen Travis tour bus the red double decker ... Beautiful neighborhood..
yep punk. sorry you have left the building. hope you're giving back somehow, maybe incognito. Hope so, you seem kind of gentle. Please think about the roots of punk. poverty, struggle,kicking against the pricks.
He went to the same high school as my mom dope
From Fontana to Calabasas
He so down to earth. V cool 😎
I can see why Kourtney adores him. He’s so calm, composed…values simple things. Wishing the best for them. It’s lovely to see a couple be so loving and kind to one another❤️
He looks like a drugged up creep
not shocked somehow always knew what kinda person he was kourtieee wasn’t playing 🔥
Candle ‘this smells like Kourtneys orgasm’ HAHAHAHAHAH
I wish my parents let me ride my skateboard in the house as a kid like Travis let his kids do
His voice is so calming.
Gosh Travis and Kourtneys relationship is so real and wholesome I love it ❤️🥰
Sorry! I do not like it. Looks like the house of Dracula. Scary…..his collection of art also is strange!
He’s vegan, that’s why he looks sickly like he’s dying. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Can't wait to see him and Kourtney's house when its ready!
rockstars....lol
He is so very gentle, kind and quite the introspective  individual.  Pretty sentimental and generous with his family, he learns and shares in the wisdom of our Higher power.  This is so refreshing and beautiful...never judge anything, be compassionate  and give back to humanity... 💖
So they’ve been together for years ? Who knew ;)
His vibe is so zen ! Love it ❤️
Are we all gonna ignore the candle at 10:30 omg
He sounds so relax ! He sounded like justin bieber behe
Travis has fantastic taste.
Great video, anyone know what that indoor and outdoor kitchen flooring is called?
Such a peaceful guy!
that trash bag looks ridiculous😅
why she is sitting on a countertop
Is it me or does Travis look like a Jewish concentration camp prisoner whose just been liberated???
Ok i never imagined he is this kind and soft spoken...now i see why she is so in love with him
His home looks like humans actually live there. You can tell he isn’t full of himself. Good for Kourtney for finding love. I think this is the life she’s been wanting. She doesn’t seem to thirst after fame like Kim.  Happy for any woman who finds a man that makes them happy.
Family becomes close when they live in a smaller home vs large houses where there is way too much space between each other.  I love hearing Mr Barker talk about how they have their permanent seating arrangement at the formal dining room table.  My family and I had that growing up.  I enjoyed listening to him how he and the kids spends Christmas and New Years together playing games together.  My family and I played board games a lot and the laughter brought us closer.  Having a table in the kitchen to hang out eat together, talk with your kids.  If I had the money, I would definitely hire Waldo to design my house like Travis’s.  I am in awe.  I love how you talk a lot about your kids and your passion.  I have to say this is the best “welcome to my crib” episode.  Listening to him has brought back so many great memories of me and my family growing up.
You can feel how home is he’s house
Do we spy one of our mattresses? 🤩
Sitting with her private parts on the countertop...disgusting!!!
I think he likes fireplaces guys …
Dude Travis got a vibe . He's so calm. His voice makes the environment serene. Good choice kourt. I love that they are happy in there personal space ❤️
Beautiful home. Travis has a the purest vibe
I absolutely love that he continues to be in Atianas life! 🥺♥️
His house is nice but it looks an feels very boring,,, coz of the style in it.. It doesn't have any wow factor to it?? Its very bland😨😨😨😨😛😛😛
Kardashian smfh
Loving the whole vibe of his house!!! My favorite part… seeing Kourtney!!!🖤 they need a show together!!
His dining tables are very basic knowing u would think he would have one of those elegant classy styles,,,? The ones he has look like something u would get from IKEA,,,
I like him…the kardashian baggage gotta go…good dude
It’s not a goth cavern. Beautiful and clean. LOVE it. ✨❤️
His home looks awesome. Very humble guy as well.
AHORA DONA UNOS MILLONES DE DOLARES A GENTE QUE QUEDO SIN CASA EN TU CIUDAD MY PUNKY FRIEND
I love a minimalist look
16yrs ago ewoooo😲😯😮
Looks like a nice guy, he looks like he’s dead but nice guy
People who actually have money: Simple and in good taste.   Fakes: Tacky, over the top, sparkly/shiny, nasty.
He looks scary, but he scared to tarantula. 😆😆😆
He is so chill ❤️
The cringe meter on both of them… lol my god.
Who is Travis Barker??  Like I care.
Those bmx bikes 🚲 omg my favorite so far
Congratulations to the newlyweds! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez3TTKoRUrg&list=PL3oEqYKdiAyXIe2R8dKpmxENqeb10w2Ld
Did anyone notice the label on the candle on the bedside table? "This smells like Kourtney's orgasm" 🤣
Never seen Kourtney so calm,speaks volume about Travis's energy ❤️
That matcha 🍵 station though
I understand why Kourtney is so inlove with him 😍
He looks so under weight
Ow my Goodness they r so inlove 😍 🤗🤗.....And this house is so homely its beautiful.....
Who is this guy
Love the dinner table.
Beautiful home love the design
I love that he calls it “my home” and not “my house”. That’s so lovely 💕
I was a pro kourtney-scott but after watching this… Wow team Kravis all the way! Travis is the most genuine, cool and gentle guy ever❤️ Kourtney is the LUCKIEST Kardashian in my opinion❤️🌹
i like when I do not know who a "famous" person is. this guy ...
Too plain
Who would've known that this guy would like his house that way really peaceful and stuff.
I'd rather have a medium modest home n have millions in my bank than a 10 million dollar house n have 1 million in my account 👍
first time saw travis doing “speech” for 15 minutes straight
I am soothed.
This now is the MTV Cribs
No wonder Kourt fell in love with him. He seems so chill, down to Earth, so intelligent. 👍🏻👏🙂🥰
It's the poop candle that smells like Kourtney's orgasm for me..just wow!
I love Travis aura i happy kourtney found him
Child if this isn't Kourtney's masculine energy match, I don't know who is! So happy for both of them.
All the organic stuff...with a chlorine pool😂😂😂😂😂
what couch is in the movie theatre? looks very comfy
you all need to vote these Democrats out
Literally the chillest, coolest, down to earth, unproblematic guy ever.
must be nice to be rich....lol
You look like jeffree Star. love it
Like seriously....this is the BEST celeb home tour I've EVER seen. It actually looks like a home. It's about him and his family and you def see that throughout. Great job, Travis! I've seen this and learned a lot about you. What an honour. Wishing you and your family a lifetime of love, peace and happiness.🖤🙏🏾 (He probably won't ever see my comment 😂)
Can anyone make out what the 5 albums are?  Pink Floyd - The Wall Operation Ivy - Energy ?? - ?? ?? - ?? Dr Dre - The Chronic
I’ve always been such a fan of Travis. He is the definition of good vibes. What a sweetheart
Enjoy the ride Travis!
the moving pillow got me
I just farted.
I really love the fact that it’s his home and not just a house.
I remember his house on “meet the barkers “ what a tip then he gets with kourtney then turns it in to a kardashian house 🤣
I didn’t know his style would have  had so much clean lines , monochrome,minimalist  just beautiful . I was expecting super gothic but he gave me  something that I find so relaxing
I really like Travis, he’s such a nice guy
Okay so him an kort is compatible im sure she is happy about that.
I'm with you Travis, I don't like many people in my house either 🤣🤣 its my sanctuary.  I've never heard him talk, his voice is quite sexy...
11:06 „it also vibrates“ omg so cute 😭
DAMN….Kourtney got her a keeper…..Travis seems like a stand up guy🥰
I love your house. The walk through wa beautiful and how you both include "your" children.  Each time you said your children,  I couldn't help but smile.  The re-desgn is perfect which gives you private space and time. I love Cadillacs also even though I don't own one.  Bless you and your family
there's literally someone behind your pillows 😂
I would imagine him leaving in a trailer. 🤣🤣🤣
Fabulous! 🖤
And all the celebrity houses I have seen this the the one i love the most. Just classy, cozy, and simply.
What a soyboy dude spent so much time in LA he turned into a valley girl.
Travis is just a solid guy. I watched his joe Rogan episode. It’s a must watch. Remember to keep your feet on the ground y’all
Beautiful home 🏡
I really didn’t expect his home too look like that!! So very calming and relaxing
He seems so gentle about everything but it’s beautiful seeing how gentle and loving he is with kourtney 🥺
No wonder Kourtney fell in love with him. He has such good vibes 😎 * new fan right here ! 😀
he's so calm 😩🙏🏽. definitely giving off good vibes 🌱🤍☮️✨
Wow...I actually think I like him. Huh!
What a beautiful home!
You beder eat a burger 😩 you look like ...... Nothing 😂😂😂🦴
🧸🤪🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 La Mb de Tijuana El 😈😈😈😈🇲🇽😃👌☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️☘️
Tarantula’s story too scary, I wouldn’t return to this house. I remember seeing the Kardashians episode of tarantulas in the backyard of Kris home, yeah I’m with Kim scared of spiders especially Tarantulas. Whew!!!!
he should star in a horror movie !
I like his voice
note to self: create matcha station in my own house ✍🏼🍵
I see your kindness 🤔❤️
Oh Travis you gon have to do a matcha tutorial!!! For all the Matcha 🍵 girls 🙏🏽☺️
Beautiful  house!
I thought this guy gonna be weird random person, have nothing interesting but now I feel like Kardashian clan didn't deserve this gentleman here. Lol.
Like Travis and love blink 182 but what was he wearing ?
I wonder how Travis finds what he wants to wear and where it is
They’re so sweet
did someone notice the change in the flower on the table
i noticed he is showimg his middle finger at the start of the video when he is holding his jumpsuit 😂😂😂
Travis seems like such a cool down to earth dude, vibes in this house is amazing, so peaceful and relaxing. 🙏🏼
So many books! All of them just for design 😂😂😂
I really like this house and it's def my vibe. They are a bit of an odd couple but seem mad chill at home and more approachable.
The way he talks about Kourtney and the little things they do 😫💖
Wow I luv Travis Barkers home so Beautiful and Zen… I never thought I would say that about a rock stars home 😊
I definitely see what Courtney sees in him, especially after this house tour. What a sweet, low-key guy. He seems like a truly grounded person.
The excessive tattoos is  a reflection of what is going on inside his soul.
This man is kind you can tell
He is so calm , ❤️
His house is actually so nice, not too much but still lavished living. Beautiful home❤️ I’d live in that
И как может такой идеальный человек пустить не только в свой дом, а даже в свою жизнь другого человека, я не понимаю, просто очень со вкусом  и идиально!
The voice of Travis its like im listening to Kourtney..
the amount of "like"
I'm genuinely so happy for you both. God is so amazing.  Both your happiness is a very strong reflection to most of the world.  Both your  energy is super effective. 👌🏾 congragulations
Somebody check on Scott....
Obviously I don't know when this remodel happened. However, you can really see Kourtney's touch in it. They have influenced each others' style SO MUCH. Fashion, decor... it's really cute to see them together, loving love, just for the sake of it.
So blessed, beautiful ❣️🌼
What I really enjoy about this is how everything in his house has meaning and he can explain it. From the glasses he uses and the stories behind them , all of the art and how they are his friends, all of the moments in the past when he sat at a certain place and drank coffee. I dream that when I can buy a house in the next couple of years I can have that kind of minimalism that’s meaningful, tasteful and classy. Also, memories to be made for a long time. So special. Thanks for sharing Travis!
Beautiful.
Am unlearning many many things for sure , didn't expect Travis to be this grounded
ä little bit of shoes in here, but most of my soes are in the other closet" Sirrrrrrrr. that roomful of shoes are what you call a "little bit?
Where is he going with no helmet?
Kor just casual sitting on the kitchen table Travis: what are you drinking? Kor: the matcha you just made for me 👀  😂😂😂😂
Loved this guy for years...hope the KK brand doesn't taint him.
He seems like such a genuine person, Love the house tour !!
It’s precious to see him so proud and happy of what he has. He’s definitely a value guy and not a materialistic one. Good for him, and him and Kourtney seem to be such a great match!
Absolutely gorgeous!! 🙌🏾
Travis: “Under 10,000 sq/ft”  Me from my 1,800 sq/ft house: “Tragic”
Just under 10,000 soft....... just folks!
I'd never let someone else decorate my home for me.  Travis' home depresses me.
This home was a lot more zen than I would guess it's gonna be. Nice
It’s just a little under 10,000 square ft. Saying it like it’s a small house. Lol that’s how you know you have too much money.
Jush a coincidence she is there like barbie doll !!!!!! Yeah right!!! Be more humble beach
Muchas de las veces pensamos que una persona que se mira como el puede ser mala por su apariencia pero una vez que el abre la boca podemos darnos cuenta la clase de persona que es ….👍🏼
❤❤❤ always been a Travi B Fan!!!!
I don’t pass the vibe check! House is good but they get on my nerves like wet jumper sleeves!
KOURTNEY SISSSS, we really get it now !!! You deserve this happiness, what a nice guy
He seems like a wonderful human.  No doubt Kourtney K fell for him after going through the absolute hell and emotional abuse from Scott!  Never judge a book by its cover!
can’t believe Travis baby mother tried to slander him. He seems like a calm, chill, down to earth person!! He’s such a vibe, Kourtney definitely waited for the right person 💯
Bruh, am a dude but I can see why Kourtney is head over heels over this guy.
He is so in love with her and it shows so much , love that for both of them
It’s got the Kardashian touch for SURE but I love this home❤️
The kitchen has two islands…. Both with sinks… I need to dream bigger!!!
He has got to be the most humble person! And gets to work with soo many amazing people too! The coolest
I really love them together 🥺🙌
His energy is soo calming.
Omg his vibe is calming. I wish I could be that calm, working on it.
What a weird fn dude. The Kardashians are weird desperate people. Who would even consider talking to a face-tattooed, crackhead looking freak like this?? WTF
He matches kourtneys vibe perfectly🙌🏼💗
Lovely  guy  bless  him
❤️❤️❤️ love u guys !!!!
I love hope chill he is.  Hope he drives that car
doesn't he look like Jacob Marley in this video ? I mean the mans a total blade !
I love Escalades hell yes I have one the gas is so much tho
“This is my kitchen and my fiancé” he’s so adorable 🥰
Its a nice house tho
Of all the kardashian Jenner homes this one has to be the most normal and family like
Gold Dior BMX Bikes... This is the most "I love being a famous, celebrity, look at all my obnoxiously ostentatious and lavish things" AD walk-thru I've ever watched. This made Adam Levine looks down to earth and that's saying something.
Never judge a book by is cover. Travis is a calm person, good father and husband for Kourt.
scary dude tats on his face scalp  neck
Looks very Swedish in the design ....or Nordic anyway 🇸🇪
Yes I sit like that too when cameras go thru my house
I fell in love with Travis not just his personality  which is just 🤤 but his soothing voice 😍. Kourtney is one lucky gal
What an incredibly boring house
10:29 the candle 😂
Travis Barker seems like a really calm, collected and sophisticated person. His house speaks a lot about his personality. It looks very warm and cozy
He has a soothing soft nice voice
i love that he really really loves his house & how he could describe what the different things mean to him. definitely did not think he was such a soft spoken, gentle person. i loved this vvv much!
His vibe is so beautiful.
Thanks Travis ...AWESOME  tour of your lovely relaxing home and you are such a Amazing Man
This was FAB!!!
I love his voice.. soo soft and soothing...
A Juno.... That was an Access Virus
Not trying to sound rude, but I never saw either of them as that “attractive” but here they are the most attractive people I’ve ever seen. Love their look, vibe and love.
He sounds like a male version of Kourtney
Super soft and calm speaking💕
He is so normal. I mean, he’s not trying to act or fake something.. that’s just cool
This HOME is not a lonely place. Says Blink 182 Fan.👨‍🦰
I love his energy
Now I see their connection. He is such a great fit for her. Family oriented, Calm, Inner circle vibe with a lot of simplicity
HES SO COMFORTABLE  AND CONTENT JUST LIKE KOURT I LOVE IT I PRAY GOD CONTINUE WATCHING OVER AND PROTECTING  THEIR LOVE FOR EACH OTHER AND LET NOTHING AND NO ONE COME BETWEEN THEM...EVER
Did anyone noticed his pillow moving minute 10:58? 😱
all the "small" things
love it
i love how simple and homey his house is, and the fact that he's had it for almost two decades? love it
so my mattress is filled with toxic stuff but it's yours that vibrates
This is an absolut normal home!
I love his house. He’s such a down to earth man and I love his voice.
Family man. Very cool guy.
Love it beautiful home
He looks like a such nice person 👍
The curtains are too long
This man so Melo how he be playing that hard music lol
NEVER EXPECTED THIS HOUSE FROM TRAVIS BUT ITS BEAUTIFUL THE WHOLE OF IT IS SO RELXING AN CALMING. THIS IS WHY YOU NEVER JUDGE PEOPLE I WAS LOOKING FOR DARK AN GLOOMY BUT ITS SI SPACIOUS AN LIGHT IN COLOUR EVEN THE OUT SIDE BRINGS IT ALL TOGETHER.  GREAT SET OF WHEELS AS WELL 👍👍👍👍
What the hell does she she in him.. he is not attractive AT ALL.. weird long giraffe neck.. boney skeleton face.. eww i dunno she can have anyone and she picked this sunkin eye dude from the hills have eyes.. ugh
https://youtu.be/whV8oEGTqNM
Omg.... How well does he talk 😍😍😍😍😍 I just wanna keep listening to him over and over again
Every time he is talking about Kourtney his eyes are sparkling! Need this energy in my life.
«Бедно» конечно, очень «бедно»
He’s creepy 🧐 lol
Oh please he’s been married before🙄
I had such a diferent idea about Travis... :O  I ended this video loving him and loving his house...
He sounds like  his in-laws.
Okayyyy we get it you guys are vegan 🌱
Amazing taste. Travis, this has to be one of the nicest architectural I’ve ever seen. Just so cool.
For all his tattooed, rocker vibes he has, he just seems like the biggest sweetheart
What a sound person 👍
Never give up on LOVE
I never heared him speak his voice is actually soothing 🤩🤩🤩
Yes cadillac! I have 2 Escalades (platinum ESV of course!) ! My next will be a CT Blackwing.    I too am cadillac all the way.
i really did enjoy this video more than expected
I see why she married him. Cool guy, cool house 👌🏽
I'm just like "whoa."   This is not Travis Barker. He was cloned by the Kardashians. I miss the old Travis, the savage on the drums and major collaborator of tracks with hella artists... by now means am I hating on his happiness but after watching this, he talks like he's one 20 xanax.  I think I'd have preferred the house when it was skateboarded, and had dirt bikes ridden in it... Tsk tsk..
Travis should do ASMR
Who told him he looked cool in that suit? lol
"I'm too rock for hip-hop"
travis voice is so relaxing,  he have such a beautiful vibe
He is the absolute best thing that’s happened to her, her face just lights up when she looks at him and she is so happy, Travis is so down to earth and loving deserve each other for sure and happy to see them together 🥰
Seems lovely but why is he dressed like Michael Myers
I’m more than shock about this guy.., It’s not right to judge people by they’re outer image… this gentleman is awesome… sweet at heart… gentle even by the way he speaks… You gain a new friend  Love you Travis
his voice so soft and Very polite .. it is calming .. a bit i guess 😅
He even claims Oscar delayhoya daughter as his own
Pansin ko gumalaw ang pillow on bed looks like scary
He has a beautiful voice
Love this. Homey home. Celebrities normally live in freaking museums
Most celebrity house are not homely or that nice to look at, but this house actually feels like someone lives in it
Sweat couple
He has the sweetest speaking voice
"Does Trav still want the gold Dior bike? LeBron never picked his up."
Am…am I watching Cribs?
I’m sure Shana has watched this over and over again. 🫣
It’s Adam Levine
Lots of his furniture are black… which kourtney gave Khloe a hard time with for her house  . Lol so funny
Is this Kardashian home?
Everyone who gets in involved with the Kardashians will have a miserable life. Mark my words.
I just want to give him a burger
Pretty cool when you have money!🤑💰
This guy just ruined  his life marrying  a kadashian sorry bro
Now everyone knows where Kourtney sits her snacky on the counter.
Okay but Kris Jenner's new home next please
My takeaway is   Travis loves everything in that house.. like loves it           Nice home
I love his energy so positive you can tell he is into spirituality
Kourtney: "who let you choose black covers for your furniture, disgusting "🤣
Still not sure this isn’t an SNL send-up. That thumbnail especially. Lol.
Are we going to bypass the candle on his bedside that says ‘this smells like kourtney’s orgasm?’ 😂😂
Dream house. I loved that he has a minimalist house... Everything is so beautiful and modern. If I ever get close to own a house and have a pool I'll be happy, lol.
I never heard him speak or i actually just dont watch KUWTK but i always wanted to know what this man is like ..... and this man is very much in peace. His calming voice , his home is actually a home and he uses all of his house. A great family man, and very minimalist which is my thing. I honestly didn’t expect him to be like this. So happy for Kourt!
Am i the only one that realized he’s doing the finger at 1:35?
It's beautifully super beautiful
So elegant, peaceful, calming...I am in awe with Travis...
Nice
Idk, dude seems creepy asf but also like a nice person lmao.
So little yet so much to see. Loved it good job Travis ❤️
gwagens are trash
so thoughtful explanation, never expected that
not surprised his daughter is slammin'. her mom is a dime too.
Kourtney is a really lucky woman. Travis seems like such a sweet and gentle guy.
lol they really sold you on mattresses being toxic huh trav? it's called sheets, buddy. rich people are so stupid.
Why would anyone would need that many t-shirts? I'm sure you give to different charities an are involved with community advocacy. You seem to be a well rounded earthy guy. I hope you don't let the Kardashians warp you. I think you got the best one out of the whole bunch! CONGRATS!
Awww the way the kept each other presents even before they got together🥺
He and Kourtney are so alike.  Chill and down to Earth.  Can't believe he was ever married to that hot mess what's her name.
Cutting edge fashion, lawn and leaf bags.
He is so sweet and calm.
His voice is so calming
Kourtney and Travis r the cutest
I can see why Kortney loves him. He is so down to earth and a kind soul. After this interview, I became a fan. ❤️
Am happy especially when he arranged chair for all his kids with Wife. Happy for both of you.
Its amazing how we judge people by their exterior. I had a totally different view of Travis before I watched this. Now I see why Kourtney is obsessed with him! I LOOOVE this house. The house plus his voice and narration just put me in such cool, calm, relaxing space.
The accident changed Travis and his perspective in life BIG TIME. I‘m also glad he found a new book of life with Kourtney.❤
Wow
Imagine having a car collection with a G wagon and rolls Royce. Yet the most expensive car is a Buick lmao
He seems like real genuine good person ❤️
"And eat amazing vegan food" 😂😂😂😂😂
❤what a nice place to stay❤️
Travis is bad boy that's actually a good guy. Love the calming vibe of his home. Travis is proud of his home, however, he loves the everyday memories and current comings and goings of himself combined with family and friends.  It's fab that he and Kourney took their relationship to the 9th level and wed. Kourtney's a pistal, she would never settle and she found true love.
Image be removing vaulted ceilings to make a flat white box
Love the garden can't stand the typical minimal grey   white box for a home..
No me cae ese tipo.
Its so him! I wonder did Kourtney keep her house and all her material items? This is all very Travis - which is great but where are things?
I hope they both will be very happy. Lovely❤️couple xx 😘
What a stunning place !!!!!!!
This Travis guy looks About 90 Years old, eat some meat dude 🤣
What a beautiful home…so warm, love all the personal touches! The formal dining room table is awesome! Travis’ description of his space is tender and thoughtful! Much love to Travis and Kourtney and their families. I feel the love and peace! It’s so healing! ❤️
He sounds like he could be a  Virgo
The house has a very Scandinavian vibe both with the minimalism and the materials chosen. That’s how we like to live🇳🇴😍
Nice.
I think I can listen to him speak all day. So soothing, so gentle
I think my favorite out of all that was the RR with shooting stars! 🤩
I am manifesting a few closets in a few years😭
i like TB and his modesty !! he is such a kind. i love seeing KK also.
Take a shot everytime he says 'like'
You have one of the most beautiful homes I've ever seen!  I absolutely love the architecture, the furniture and all!
2:23
Kourtney and Travis are so compatible! ❤️
I understand it now. What a peaceful man 🖤
Honestly, I can see why kourtney wanted to marry him. They are cut from the same cloth. Both are down to earth, and family oriented.
I got this link from "Morning Brew" I don't know who he is, going to Google him. Wow lots of tats, shoes, n tees, fine looking home too.
Kourtney your a lucky lady a man who keeps his house so clean is my kind man.😉 He also seems like a great guy wish you both a long healthy life together....
This is a classy beautiful home, I love it!!
Dude....wtf r u wearing? What did we interrupt you from? Lmao should we do the tour later? 😅
It was a pleasure
Wow he does not look good at all - what is money when you have to look like that!
He looks like a very sweet person ☺️ More positivity to the couple 😇
I love how everybody in the comments pretents they know them 😂
Few years from now??? Travis Gon suffer from the Kardashian curse 🤣
Nice of him to take time out from Pit lane to do this.
Coz i had not watched any interview of Travis Barker until I watched this I honestly did not expect that Travis is soft spoken, humble and calm and family oriented. ❤️
Travis, This is a beautiful home. 🏡 😊
SUCH A SOFT SPOKEN MAN
#perfection🌷🌱#good vibes
I don't know any of his music,but I do know I like him as a person,he seems a very calming influence and possibly very nice to be around. His house is stunning although a little too modern and minimalist for me,but I can see the beauty of it all,I love the big windows,light and the  gorgeous potted plants,there are some real stunners. I think Kourtney is very lucky indeed. What a super guy.
He loves the new attention 😂 and paychecks . sense when before did we care how he lived lol not sense many many years ago his career had been done ✅
Kourtney has always seem less into the fame and money then her sisters, so l can see her with someone down to earth.
He has good intuition, and see how listening to his intuition really paid off. Maybe they will end up together- I mean staying together.
Makes total sense, I get them now.
Nice jumpsuit. I didn’t realize he was part of Devo.
He's not  rock and roll inside outside.
The two of them are just so sweet 😍
he used to be my crush in hs lol
Can anyone identify what his five favorite albums are?
imagine having the honour of playing ping pong with travis
I love how calm  he is!!!
I totally adored Travis's vibe. He seems to be very grounded.
He’s just so thoughtful, he really thinks about what he wants to say before he speaks
I honestly have no idea who Travis Barker is, but the home is lovely.
His house is very cool and he seems like a nice person! Best wishes to him and Kourtney
I honestly am surprised by how calm and chilled he is, the media can depic people so differently so I’m glad he did this episode with you guys! 😊
This guy is so, so wholesome. I’m so happy for him - that he’s found a special love with Kourtney💕
Theres just something about him thats just so calming
Travis........       Please Please DON"T marry Her
I didn't expect him to greet with such a calm persona. His tone is so gentle. No swearing. I like him more now
Kourt is modeling with the laptop
I like turtles 🐢  Not lizards
I thought they were looking for a new home ? I mean I love his . It's very nice . 16 years is a long time .
.I like his house style.the colors are nice.almost like my colors.blackfixtures,grey,beige,little bit of white.And artwork.
Kourtney got me this, Kourtney got me that... insanely in love the two <3
I’d love to see you guys go to the Lz compound
What’s a Motcha?
I didn’t know much about him but after this I genuinely just understand why kourtney loves him so much. He seems dopeeee
What is Vgnore?
this kardachans r addicted to attention
Now I see why kourtney  is head over hills, this guy is so sweet
Who is Travis Barker other than a human wall for children to draw on?
I love him!!! And I love how he is with kourt kids and his kids 💙 he looks like he is a good guy!
So hold up, he proposed to her the first day they were official. So they were just friends all this while.
Beautiful house
He’s finally such a cool Guy.. congrats
He’s so soft spoken & sentimental. Such a sweet & genuine soul. ❤️
i love how he values making memories. he holds on to them so dearly
I did not expect his voice to be like that, suprised. Surprisingly l like him after this. Love love the kitchen
I absolutely love this home, my minimalist side is enjoying this🖤🤍 he's such an amazing person, so calming you can tell why Kourtney fell in love with him!
I’m absolutely thrilled that they found each other…this house is definitely a home. It’s so beautiful and it’s filled with love ❤️
Who is this?I'm seriously.
talks like a child
Travis's personality is the complete opposite of what he looks like.
Nice cozy home, to enjoy!
Yup just casually sitting on the countertop, Doing my work, camera crew who?
Lovely thinking about all the carbon admissions your wealth brings to your grandkids??????????????
Take away: the bed vibrates and his kids do ALOT of homework ☠️
assuming he meant 17th october a year apart? lol
Always love when I see a loved home 🤎🤎
There’s chairs in the kitchen and Kort sit on island countertop.
"I don't like too many people in my home" but you just let the entire world in. Smh the house does not even lived in. It looks like a model that people look at when your shopping for a home.
Belle visite toujours de belle rencontres
He's  so in love omg
Is he wearing a garbage bag
His calm vibe is seen all-over the house
None of the women that live there wear pants apparently 😆
He sounds sucha down to earth dude & I’ve always been a fan on blink 182 but now he’s made me a fan of him 🤍 not to mention he seems like he is a great dad.
Home Theatres should be as dark as possible , those light walls are washing out your picture.🤦🏼‍♂️
I really didn't expect to be this invested with his home and he's truly down to earth. It was his explanation of his home for me, that made it so unordinary.  This was one of the best tours that I've watched.
God Bless 🙏🏼 Beautiful Gorgeous Home 😍😍😍
If Never judge a book by its cover was a person
I like the fact the house isn't just a set of show rooms, Travis and his kids have really lived and enjoyed the home. It's not just for display to show others
Okay, interior design, matcha, vegan, calm, family man. He really does seem to have a lot in common with Kourtney. Cute couple.
Such a nice guy
Come to Christ. He is real and loves you died on a cross to save us from our sins. Through Him we have eternal life with God the Father in Heaven. This is true. Hebrews 9:27 says, “People are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment.” Those without Christ will unfortunately die twice. Death is the judgement for our sin while life is a gift that we get through Christ. To receive eternal enjoyment with God after death accept Christ as Lord and saviour and repent. He wants you to come to Him and is willing to forgive you. Don’t let bad habitats continue to hurt you, evil is separating you from God. Pray to Him sincerely and He will hear you. Seek Him, He loves you. God Bless.
Aloha From Oahu,  Digging on the tranquility vibes 🧜‍♀️
What a bloody idiot …. So much crazy art, not in the house but on his head and neck ….. my god what a bloody state ….. plus a bonus … his girlfriend is a bigger idiot ….. I LOVE ME WHO DO YOU LOVE !!!!
At 10:57 thought there was a paranormal activity and the pillow on bed had moved, but then saw he had remote... But freaky 😬😅
Cool
Kourtney la Kardashians más patética dejándose usar del que estuvo siempre enamorado de su hermana y pa colmo cambio toda su esencia y encima ni sus hijos les importan🤮🤮
I wish he and Kourtney will be together forever..
So boring.
That pillow on bed moved itself 👻
I love the family dining. Fits a good number of family members and its intimate.
He moved close to Kourt 16 yrs ago
Wow.  Dude's a proper snowflake!
Ok Ill take back my not so good first impressions of Travis. Nice aura about him.
As a blink fan, I'm surprised about Kourtney and the album art, but it's so sweet and thoughtful - I like her for him
this house is absolutely beautiful
Watching this video when his fiancé became his wife 🤍
Glad I came upon this video.  These two seem so real & funny; cute! I love it.. Beautiful home too! All about family!  Thanks for sharing!
Eat delicious vegan food 🤣😂😂
The way Travis still consider Ati his child eventho he’s divorce with his ex wife, speaks a lot about him
probably one of the most enjoyable home tours i've ever watched..
what a beautiful home! waldo fernandez is such a genius. the way he understands what his clients want and need, the way he makes every home cozy, no matter how minimalist or modern it is, is just very, very cool.
He’s been famous for YEARS and any OG blink 182 fan and American pie 1999 fan knows he’s been a decent human being this whole time lol. Not just now that he’s with a freaking Kardashian. I may be showing my age but whatever. I remember when he barely had any tattoos and hair back in the early 90’s and he was the exact same. Always thought he was lovely, but all the gen z’s only know him because of the Kardashians now which is some what embarrassingly hilarious ! 🤣🤦🏼‍♀️
Anybody see the Goop candle on the bedside table in the bedroom? It had an "interesting" name....
Why do I find him so irritating
if u live in calabasas u definitely have an accent
Who would have thought Travis makes the best matcha! 😄 Love that small round dining table, very intimate, that’s a perfect dining table for a close family. Travis really is the epitome of never judge a book by its cover! Kourtney deserves this man! How his kids turned out to be is one of his greatest achievements imo. One question tho; where are the lambos, ferraris etc 😄 He’s really playing it down lol.
Honestly he is soo cool and I love this, and Kourtney finally getting the marriage she deserves💗
Travis and kourtney seem to both be into family time and making their lives accessible for family. I love this. I hope the best for them as a couple❤️
Una casa con toda su personalidad
That Buick is awesome!
What do you need more if u have such pretty- cosy house , loving hubby & kids ❤️
subscribed to the channel because of Travis
They are perfect together
He is good❤️
Mentioning Kourt in every sentence is it for me 😍🥰
He's so cute and gentle it seems
Dude sounds fake
Everything changed after the airplane crash.  That made him tone down and  slow down
How can you not love this man! His vibe is insaaaane. Kourtney we get you now😫😭😭😭😭
Exactly me and my husband . Picture perfect . We look like it is the end of the world and our home is just gone thru a hurricane. Bless them they look so clam drinking macha and eating good .
1987 is the best year
very UN punk house, so beige and boring... not what I expected, that said we all know Travis' punk pass was revoked years ago...
this outfit you have on is amazing you look so polished.
Travis is a cool 😎 Guy
i like him.
The way he speaks of her and their kids bruhhh- must be niceeee lol I used to watch his reality show back in the day- he's such a down to earth dude. Bruh he remembers where each kid sit - a f#%%% keeper
after watching this video, Travis and Kourtney are meant to be together. <3
Very beautiful spacious home. Didn't expect him to sound like that. Then again maybe I never seen too much of him where I heard him talking. Interesting. Travis blink 182 was my teenage years so it's nice to see he's still doing good. Beautiful home and kind genuine guy he's seems to be.
Love the house wow !!
Getting a home like this, is my new life goal. This home is so beautiful and stylish, and very well maintained and decorated
Omg Travis & journey is literally I crave 😍🥰❤️💯
♏ Scorpios are the coolest individuals ever 😎!! They got good taste 😌 👌
Very nice home, and lovely couple. I wish them many many decades of wedded bliss.
underneath those tatoos is a deep and sensible man.
How did this poor man end up with that lady?! I hope she doesn’t take him down. He seems like a good man.
Good grief!
He's so humble about the musical abilities. Dude is on every greatest drummers list ever.
Love! His home is lovely and shows such a great side of his personality. Though he produces loud and bold, he is soft and serene. Beautiful home!
His house is so normal but still very nice 🔥
I hope his and kourtneys relationship isn’t fake or for media
Wow what a gorgeous home! I thoroughly enjoyed exploring such a aesthetically pleasing home... actually felt very calm and at peace discovering all the beautifully balanced rooms✨
Wow i didnt expect that he's a soft spoken, so calm, light and humble person 👀 i thought he was a loud due to his genre.
Very nice house I love it !!!
you can tell his energy is so authentic wow!!
These folks are WITCHES
"... and eat delicious vegan food."   I'll take oxymorons for a thousand Alex.
I just love how normal this house looks like nothing pure extravagant apart from the cars
He is so soft spoken I love his calm energy
Cool guy he has a good vibe❤️
2:27 the candle PLEASE 😭😭😭
I can tell he treats kourtney good based off the gifts she’s given him. When aries women feel safe in love we wanna give our partners the world.  We pay attention to the smallest details when we are in love. This is why every gift that he’s shown from kourt is of sentimental value, she’s been listening and making mental notes to everything he’s shared with her. So happy for them ❤️🥲
I think the reason people say they really love his energy is cause he's nog bragging or 'showing of'. He's sharing. He shares his passion, his love for his home and explaines detailed stuff. Beautiful. And indeed.  Never ever judge a book by its cover ❤
Love U  man🇺🇬🇺🇬🇺🇬👈
Surprised to see that his house is completely my style.
Besutiful
If you ever get invited over to Travis, you should remember where the guest seat at the table is😌☝🏻
No one cares. This guy has not been relevant in 20 years
He's is so cringe. Looks like an 80yr old 😂
He’s so soft spoken and sweet
his physical body is the polar opposite of minimal and "clean space"...im so confused by this thought process.
Whoa whoa whoa a Kardashian not with a Black dude.  Good luck with that Travis.  😂
So mellow
At first I didn’t like him because of too much tattoos but he’s seems like a very calm and nice guy..God help us because we tend to judge before we even get to know a person
Yoh lobhuti ukhuluma nje nge Bad bad beach
At 10:58 the pillow lifts by itself 😶🫠☠️
I like the fact that he has had his house for 16 years. Unlike so many rich people dont do they have like 15houses lol.. And raised  the kids in that house. So cool .
"This smells like Kourtneys Orgasm"  @ 10:27
Love love love his house!! So aesthetic! So calm ! Just Wowowow..
I love the simplicity of his beautiful house...wishing him all the best. I hope him and Courtney make it last a life time.
Beautiful home…looks similar to my brothers home in West Hills
Never thought he talks like that! He is so nice and he seems to be a good father too!
I’m so happy Kourtney married this guy and not that loser deadbeat Scott.
He’s so smart and fits with Kourtney’s intellect. I can see why they are a couple.
his voice is so gentle and soothing
Such a nice men😊🙌
I feel sorry for my wrong judgement.Don't judge a book by its cover.He is so composed and humane...knows what he wants and loving... family man indeed.! Beautiful home there....
I can't believe y'all thought he was a vicious hardcore person with full of gangsterism.
His vibe is so calming! ✨
It’s weird somehow and never thought I’m gonna say this, but I can see why Kourtney married this man. There’s really more than the outward appearance. Punk rock isn’t my choice/ genre or music and I hate to admit that I always find the way Travis dresses up to be weird, and how it rubs off on Kourtney. But now I totally see and understand why. Travis seems to be a gentle pure soul who loves what he does, his family, and of course Kourtney. I adore him now 🥹
Can we talk about the candle on his nightstand? I love them together Kourtney looks so happy
I actually like his house not over the top like most celebs .
Such a good human
I get why the kardashians have so much money but why does he have so much money? He was in blibk 182 but that vand was succesful for maybe 4 years. I don't see how he made kardashian kind of money.
I'm impressed  he a  nice dude. So far.......
Somebody should have told him that's not a fit lol. Travis is still the man tho. Y'all been sleepin.
i don’t know him but i like the fact that he’s foucing on the memories they made in every corner rather than only the Interior design that shows a lot about his personality
Seems nice. Good luck kourtney
He is sweet
I used to have a crush on Travis. Love blink 182.❤️
Love his home
He's so humble and sweet ❤️
He's admirable and nice
i swear i thought he was shady
This guy is just creepy
Very down to Earth person. No wonder Kourtney married him
Kourtney got her a winner!!
His voice is like a voice actor’s. Very clean, inviting and up beat :)
Did Travis barker just use the word “aesthetic “ ?
his voice is so calming, very eloquently spoken lol
I like him he seems super chill
He is such a wonderful person and you can tell he adores Courtney I’m so happy for both of them
Travis' voice is very soothing. He also have the same vibe as kourt. So happy for you guys!❤
His voice is so calming
I LOVE this .
Ugh no wonder they are soulmates. He’s vegan, organic, zen, conscious..everything she always has been. I’m so happy for them.
HIS HOUSE IS VIBE! My eyes and my heart! There is seriously nothing I don't like about it! Aww beautiful! Dream!
loved the music in this video also, he has such a great vibe! i’m so happy that kourtney has her person. congrats💍
He is so much soft & welcoming by Nature. I guess black is his favorite colour because everything that belong to him is black almost.
He’s such a cool guy, hardworking, down to earth and humble, opposite of Kourtnry’s ex. All the best to Travis rock on 🤘
Organic bed him an Kourteny are the same person
He definitely does not fit in with the Kardashians chaotic life. But I’m so happy he’s happy with kourtney. She’s is definitely the different kardashian! The most interesting to look at!😌
He's a nice guy but I judged him bcz of his tattoos and I dont like too many tattoos so I think he's a nice person
What are the 5 albums? I see Pink Floyd's The Wall, Operation Ivy, what else?
Him and his dad “pal” always liked Cadillacs. 🥰
"I like this life better... I think it's better" my heart
The name of the candle by his bed lol
I always thought that his house would be more arty ,I liked how they mixed their styles together
I only watch the kardashians so that I can see Travis 😍😍😍😍😍 (blink-182 fan 🙋🏻‍♀️) I’m happy for his happiness 🥳
Beatiful house.
If I walked in that home I would never think he lived there, the vibe isn't him. But hey I'm not judging, a person's home can say a lot about them. 🤷🏻‍♀️
Love his house. He has great style. Seems like a really nice guy, too!
That’s gorgeous Travis. The outside is breathtaking.
Interesting as how looks can be so deceiving. I honestly have no clue who this is nor what he does (just being honest). I’ve only noticed on social media he married into the Kardashian family. Personally I’m not a tattoo fan & especially on the face nor much on his attire but wow to his personal life. The polite balanced tone of his voice, excellent grammar, deep love for his kids not to mention the calming style of his home. Definitely seems very sentimental & passionate about his possessions plus home. Perhaps with the house being so immaculate & well presented we could have done without Kourtney sitting upon the counter in what appears to be a sleep shirt but hey 🤦‍♀️ Admitting I definitely judged by looks 🤷‍♀️
Totally awesome!! I loved this….
I don't know what I expected...but this wasn't it. With that being said, I loved everything about this house.
kourtney's legs at 4:30
He has the kindest soul!! Seems like a really great guy. Really amazing vibes.
Travis has the most soothing voice 😇
Dam! Sweet pad Travis! What are the floors? Concrete? In the five favorite albums room.
Kourt got a real one. God bless you guys congratulations
home minimalist, tattoo maximalist.
Damnn he's perfect for Kourtney 😍
His very sentimental I see why Kourtney is so Inlove
I didn't expect him to be this soft spoken lol
He's so sweet and devoted to Courtney. That's so beautiful!! I'm happy for them. Beautiful home also
He's so calm n thoughtfully spoken but that mofo garbage bag jumpsuit onsie situation is serial killierish
Ewww can you not sit on the counter where foods prepared 🤢🤮
Not my taste! I would be bored senseless.He is certainly a better vibe for Kourtney.
His house didn't look like what I expected. I thought it would be more goth looking. I love the tables although the chairs look hard & uncomfortable. I love the light pendants,fireplaces,the pool,the out door area & the color schemes.The sofas aren't my style but I did the colors of the fabrics on them & the throw pillows. I like the lamp that he said he made. His closet looks exactly like what I imagined only neater. I love the clean-cut, minimalist,open concept. I also didn't expect to see those types of cars in his collection. I love the Buick & need to borrow it! And I'd love a ride on the bike. I like that he said removed the vaulted ceiling & flattened it,the room looks more serene.What a beautiful home,the designer did a wonderful job! Thanks Mr.Barker for sharing! ♥️
His house is so tranquil totally opposite of what i’d expect from a cool tatted up drummer 💕. Love it!
Don’t judge a book by it’s cover, now I understand Kourtney, he’s very calm, family man, humble, genuine. Very, very nice guy ♥️
he looks like Justin B
Wow
Awww He is so so sweet and down to earth - what a calm soul
Khole next please
Congrats on your wedding!!!
I wish him and Kourtney the best.
Travis gives off such good energy, congratulations to him and Kourt!🥰
Now i know why she love him, he so calm already settle down. Life that she want
Esto si es un claro ejemplo de sencillez y humildad, desprendimiento y serenidad, realmente todo lo que representa un punk rock lo veo reflejado en este austero joven y su cándida y desprendida mujer.
Mansion on the outside, basic on the inside.. and I'm okay with that. That makes him more likable to me.
Kourtney is so lucky
This guy looks like he was either bullied a lot in school or that he is about to shoot up a mall
Oops! )and Husband. Travis thank you for the tour of Your warm and comfortable home.
He reminds me of a gentle lizard.  His voice is very soothing.  Happy for Kourtney and Travis.
What a compassionate Person,  Dad &
What makes these people think we care? Do we show you our houses with our 66 cars. Are you interested, would you care? Of course not because it's boring AF
Se la presté 😎😂🤣
0% punk
Humble! Just humble! Him and kourtney are just ever lasting love together. 🙏🏼
Humble Guy!
Wow he speaks eloquently and with a peaceful spirit!! I am impressed.
Gave me MTV Cribs vibessss
That outfit is drippin hot.
I love the new name of MTV Cribs
11:15 he has gta vc shirt
I notice very little about the Kardashians but I am happy for her finally getting over the user, loser Disick.
His house is a Home 😊
My mom does not like Travis because of his tattoos, but I always say “don’t judge a book by it’s cover” and Travis is a leading example. A true music icon and a dedicated family man  A/N: this comment is not at all written for people to bash my mom. My mom is just one of those people who doesn’t support tattoos because that was just part of her upbringing
His house is a Home 😊
His house is a Home 😊
Woow I like how settle he is….
One of the best episodes. This man energy is so peaceful and calming. Very refreshing and worth it.
Awwww, it’s like MTV Cribs all over again 🥺🥺🥺 Kourtney looks amazing btw!!
He’s likeble
I love him I just do...
Wao I am blown away. What a beautiful man. Felicidades to both of you.  Bendiciones
11:11 the small though …so cute
Ladys 😂😂
That G Wagon 4x4 Squared just became my new  Favorite Vehicle 💕
He seems like such a genuine, sweet guy, and the home is beautiful ❤️
Just what I’ve been waiting for
All this gives me good vibes, you all need to stop judging this couple on the internet, Travis looks like nothing you would expect from someone with that many tattoos, he looks like a good father and fiancé to Kourtney, he knows his and her kids, he doesn’t party in his house he wants peace and drinks tea on a regular basis.
🥹
Love his house , he is a pretty nice guy  :) Done to earth for the Win !
Like, like, like, like, like  ….. 🤷🏼‍♂️ ……
Kourtney got Aman so humble calm❤️
They are adorable.  I hope they make it. They actually are very much alike and compliment each other.  Living in a place that long u end up loving it more and more. I wish I was rich and famous sometimes it.must be so nice
Kourtney won the best guy! He's everything a girl could wish for and more ❤👍
Love love love his home it’s incredible and I’m not really into houses like that but Travis got me dreaming
met him at a concert and he shook everyone's hand and listened to every comment his fans made he is such a giving person
Nada higiénico poner el trasero donde se preparan los alimentos, asquerosos!!
I love how genuine and down to earth he is
The moment Travis Barker started to talk, I saw him as a very different person. Such a humble and family oriented man. i never knew until today as I watched him talk. It was always “WE”…..his children are well loved….He loves Kourtney so much and her children. What a wonderful man. His house is beautiful and very minimal….it shows he looks for peace and serenity when he is home. Thank you Travis for taking us inside your beautiful home. You are a wonderful person, humble and kind……More blessings to you and your family.
So fake
House is nice.
looks amazing!!!  love the positive energy
AD! We wanna see Lisa kudrow's house and she be like explaining everything at her house because it needs to have a story behind it.
Wtf is he wearing tho lol
I can see why Kourtney married him ❤️
He’s giddy like a child in love
Travis sounds like such a nice guy. His voice is calming and very family oriented. I can see why Kourtney fell in love with him.
I love the design of the house and the fact that he has lived there that long is very impressive. It shows he truly doesn't take it for granted. The pool and the kitchen really caught my eye.
Y’all saw that cancel right? 😅😅
Kourtney living her bestest life!!
Oh wow such a cool guy.
I don’t know much about him. All I know is, he’s dating Kourtney (they married now lol). But wow he sounds like he’s such a down to earth kind of guy, humble and everything. This is like the first time hearing him talk because I know him only from his PDA photos with Kourtney.
Nice presentation. Travis is quite humble. It's great to see his authentic passion for a balanced life and music.
How he always mention his children, kourt, and kourtney’s children says a lot about him..#familyguy
What's forex trade ? And who is Mrs Chloe James you really want to know the check the topic below
That ping pong table is $18,000 🥹
her even talks like the kardashians 🙏
Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like...........
Why are you wearing a Rubber Coat? Are you expecting rain inside your house??
He has a lovely vibe about him good luck with your life, from belfast ❤
I've come to realise that there's no secured job in NY, you get employed today and get sacked the next month.
Beautiful home. Travis is so well spoken with such a calm energy, just like his home 🙌
Am I the only one wondering why she's (kourtney) on the kitchen counter when there are so many seats available 🤦🏽‍♀️
“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬    “Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.” ‭‭John‬ ‭14:6‬   ““Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.” ‭‭Matthew‬ ‭7:13-14‬   “Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel.”” ‭‭Mark‬ ‭1:14-15‬ ‭
He is such a great guy and Kourtney is such a beautiful girl. They both had a rough go of it first time around with their respective ex-partners. And they both deserve to have love, happiness, respect and a stable family life. It's long overdue for both of them. Especially Kourtney. I hope they stay married forever.  I just wish they would ease up on the public fondling. It's not romantic it's kind of gross. It makes it seem like they're not really in love but they just like the shock factor of their public humping. It's starting to become a big joke. They're old enough to know better.  I know he has this death punk image to uphold but, come on. I am embarrassed for them.  At least do it in private. Especially when they have all those kids around all the time. Other than that I really do wish them happiness. They're great people. And they're going to make a wonderful blended family.
He seems like a nice guy. As far the home decor, it looks really bland. As long he is happy. Why are some objects blurred? The outdoor spaces are the best. His vibe is kind and thoughtful.
Love him. He’s the calm that Kourt needed for sure
Love him. He’s the calm that Kourt needed for sure
And Tom gets blackballed... Nice suit
OMG! lessons learnt. Never read someone by their self implied looks, for real! Go for their hearts and the values they stand for. Travis Barker is real deal. To be honest TB is literally a fine guy but the first contact with the tattoos was hard to take in. I was wondering what Kourtney was talking about falling in love outside Scott. It was so hard  for me to take in. Some how I fell back to say, I knew Kourtney to be intelligent but what suddenly happened to her on dating. OMG!  I fought back with my posts, if she ever read them. But now, am faced with realities of what life is all about.  People who decided to change for good, turned 360 degress, best version of whom they were for real. Became matured, good people, with good hearts, good values, genuinely loving self, family, people, respecting, cherishing, valuing relationship, loving are the best ladies and gentlemen to be with. Kourtney, now I know. Go on Babe! Enjoy! I can see how detailed he is. Made provisions for his large family. This is awesome!
Well spoken
So cool, these two.
I like him he is like so chill kourtney better keep him forever !! 😎
Love this house! I love how he talked about the rooms through the video, it shows his inner self and I would’ve never imagined the tranquil feel. Cool stuff!👍🏼🤟🏼
What a chill dude. I enjoyed watching this piece and appreciate his style. Blessings on your marriage.
He seems like such a sweet guy.  Lucky kourtney  . I'm glad she got a good guy.  She deserves it..
Never heard of him
THIS MAN MUST HAVE THE PRITTER VOICE EVER
scott disick somewhere clinching his fists
Wow just wow! So nice
“this smells like kourtney’s orgasm” did anyone else see that?😂💀
I totally see why Kourtney fell in love with him
I can see why Kourtney loves him. Travis needs a ASMR channel,his voice is so relaxing
the little sweet references to kourtney and his kids made me fall in love with him.
Perfect home for 2 satanic worshippers.
10.34-Having his mum Rosary📿 really got me🥰 I judge him by his tattoos but he exemplifies the saying,"don't judge a book by its cover."
I like Travis a lot. I do believe they were meant to be. good for Kourtney. scott was a hot mess and she deserves to be happy
He’s so well spoken
Hope Kourtney doesn't mess him up.  I do believe that she will end up in a psych ward within a few months.
He seems very genuine
He seems so calm and Inlove.  Love to see it
Why his voice is calm
I love them together. Such a warm and inviting clean atmosphere ❤️
The pillow in the back move by it self!!
What a sweetheart-Kourtney is lucky 💯
He’s just a drummer wtf
Don’t let Chris talk her daughter into make you sell it…
He literally said he got it 16 years ago excuse me why do you keep mentioning kourtney if yall just got together .KRISSSSS JENNER you are at it again.
For a second i thought kourtney changed her aura for him seems the other way around. Money speaks yall
Did anyone caught that candle by the bed?
Travis seems like a nice guy.   He has a nice house.
This couple is adorable!  Beautiful house and a beautiful family.
No offense to Travis, but looks like he needs some sunlight in his life.
He seems like a very cool guy..an calm love to have me a husband like 👍
He looks like an android.
He really does seem like a cool guy. Congrats to you both....everyone deserves to be happy and feel loved.
Like we say don’t judge A book by a cover a very lovely person
Not a fan of any kard/jenner but kourtney seems and looks sooo much more relaxed and natural ever since this guy. Unlike her sisters who are always posed. I hope she stays that way.
Your only doing this cause you and Kourtney got married and Noone cares
Super cool
There’s like a calming vibe about him
I came here with no expectations and I realized yes, this guy has a beautiful organic home, but also he seems family oriented and with good energy.
He really loves Kourt
Rich people my Macha is the best. Us Normal people, macha what!! Bruh gtfo
everytime he says kourtney love from soul comes out from him
I’m late to the game but who is this guy his energy is just so calming. All I have to do is Google so no response is necessary but I’m super glad I found this now I have to do some YouTube research on him.
Now, after watching this, I love him for Kourt. He speaks so calmly.
This is a beautiful home, it’s lived in and looks comfortable which says a lot
There is something about them that's not right.
Such a nice bloke
I’m not big into celeb stuff or the Kardashian’s family but seeing him I’m the new Kardashian show and watching this gives me nice vibes from this chap.
I love his soothing voice, I love how he presented his house. It wasn't like showing off or anything like that. I hope he and Kourtney are happy together and their kids are too
I hope when the relationship is over and done with … he leaves with as little damage as possible. Those Kardashians are cancer.
Travis seems so kind and humble. I feel that Kourtney and Travis are soulmates. 💕
I like how he talks.. He seems calm and relax. No wonder....
I just laughed so hard at him saying  "& I love, like this, wooden post"  🤣🤣 I guess it's a cool post.
The bedside table candle had me rewinding and taking a double take 😳😂
Knowing this is a house of a Rockstar is beyond unimaginable how it brings an ultimate Zen
I was expecting dark stuff, but this is nice asf
Someone compared him to Voldemort once and now I can’t unsee it
she's kept a candle in a box in a closet. yeh sounds like she really liked it Travis 🤣
It's the way he includes Kourtney xD "This is where Kourtney sits" "Kourtney got these for me" "Kourtney, Kourtney, Kourtney" LOVE IT!
What does Kourtney do?
I know how much kourtney loves matcha & her finding someone who appreciates it as much as her is goals
That’s wild he lives in such a bland/boring house and he talks so calmly. His career has been based on the total opposite.
WHY DOES HE LOWKEY TALK LIKE KOURT LMAOO
Beautiful simple style home <3  He's so soft-spoken too, cute!
People just don’t believe the curse smh
So humbled
Waoo
A casa dele é linda! Realmente parece um lar! Não é nada como aquelas casas de rico que parecem um stand pra exibir em revista.
Kourtney ...is a very lucky girl ....congrats to both of you .
Travis seems like such an awesome guy .. So happy he n Kourt are together ..
did anyone else see that candle???
Did they interrupt his indoor skydiving session?
Have No idea who this guy is but he seems so nice and humble. Beautiful house
you can see how much he loves his kids, all the memories he shared with them involving his home
Ma come cazzo sei vestito?!
What a lovely home, so fresh and light, but also cosy and with lots of personal touches to make it his own, really nice.
We're is Kourtney? Did I miss her?
Really loved how he well spoken he is and he always kept it flowing. I enjoyed his energy a lot here. Go travis
I can see why Kourtney fell in love with him. I wish them the best. 🤟✌🤟
I wish them lots of love and blessings for their whole lives together ❤️. Waiting on my Travis lol
Oct 17 is Eminem’s Birthday
I believe he has a talent in interior designing! How he describes each item inside the house with meaningful stories is so amazing. I feel like listening to an interior designer. The house was redesigned according to his detailed  ideas. I was expecting the opposite character. But he's very calm, OC , into minimalism, soft spoken and now I just understand why kourtney likes him. They just have the same vibe. And my impression of Travis Barker just changed. Thanks to this tour. Very entertaining.
i really hope him a kourt last 🥺 they both deserve a true ever lasting love
DISGUSTING. These people sicken me.
travis comes across so genuine, scott is toxic. he is passing that to his kids now.
He looks 30 years old
Happy 4 u dude 🔥🔥👊👊🤘🤘👽
16 year! But he said that he moved to Calabassa to be near kortney. And she's moved several times before where she is now.
His house and the way he speaks is just so class.
What a smart sweet and gentle guy
Congrats on your engagement to the most beautiful Kardashian of them all.
I like Travis! I'm sure that plane crash really shook him up. He seems like the nicest guy who loves his family & they do him as well. With a cool personality that I could vibe with. I'm sure he isn't perfect but none of us are. Congrats to Kourtney & Travis. I hope this marriage last forever.
Beautiful home Travis🤗CONGRATS TO YOU BOTH! I love the fact that you knew that you wanted to make her your wife and did the honorable thing! May you both bring love and joy to each other everyday of your life. May God bless you, your family and your marital union!I am happy for you all🇧🇸😚
Stars in the roof and there shooting
Innocent soul ❤️
Beautiful home but I never understand why these stars need so many different cars.
He such a cool guy very humble
He's going to be so good for her. I love it.  ...he seems to be a good dude.
That boys in love, so sweet.
Very simple and wholesome…beautiful home and family♥️
That’s a beautiful house. But I don’t approve the matcha station they have as a Japanese person.
believe ur are healed ! believe!!! !!!  I've seen two people wake from the dead after prayer.. I've seen 3 different types of cancer healed at once in One persons body.. I've seen the paralyzed raise up supernaturally and drs run out the room never returning.. they ordered tests.. all 4 blood clots gone 2 in the brain 2 in the stomach.. BELIEVE YOUR HEALED IN JESUS NAME AND U ARE !   use olive oil while praying ❤️ rub it in affected areas.. and believe ! its anointing oil that u pray over and ask God.told send healing to you.. God speaks of olive trees in the bible ❤️ im  praying for u !  we are saved thru faith in jesus not of works or good deeds believing the seeking God changes our hearts ! being born again means believing in jesus and accepting that he died on the cross for all our past and future sins.. that doesnt give us the right to do wrong.. thru God we fight everyday to do better for the lord.. we call fall short and all sin daily.. just keep God and continue to love others like God loves you ! and BELIEVE ! NEVER GIVE UP.. THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET BAD READ ROMANS IN THE BIBLE AND READ CORINTHEANS IN THE BIBLE .. CONTINUE TO SEEK GOD UNTIL THE END.. WE DONT HAVE MUCH TIME .. SPREAD THE GOSPEL .. THE GOSPEL IS GOD WAS NAILED TO A CROSS AND HE WAS SINLESS BUT HE TOOK ON ALL HUMANS SINS PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE SINS .. HE ROSE FROM THE DEAD THREE DAYS LATER AND IS WAITING FOR US TO COME HOME !! Believe !    I AM A TRUE WITNESS OF MIRACLES AND TRUTH ! WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN GIFTS THE LORD WANTS TO GIVE US IN THESE LAST DAYS.. GOD SAID HE WOULD POUR OUT HIS HOLY SPIRIT ON TO US IN THESE TRYING TIMES THAT WE ARE IN!   FIGHT FOR GOD ! AND LOVE EACHOTHER AS HE LOVES US.. !  ps.. do not take any mark of the government.. this would be the mark of the beast .. any mark or chip in the brain or the hand.. stay away from vaccines ! if you have taken any vaccines STOP NOW ! DO NOT TAKE ANYMORE ! THE VACCINES COULD BE THE 3RD MARK OF THE BEAST Which WOULD BE THE NUMBER OF HIS NAME 666 WRITTEN IN OUR DNA.. SATAN WANTS HIS NAME WRITTEN IN YOUR DNA BECAUSE OF WHAT HE DID IN THE BOOK OF GENESIS WITH CHANGING DNA BEFORE NOAHS ARK AND THE FLOOD TOOK PLACE.. THATS Why GOD FLOODED THE EARTH.. BECAUSE DNA WAS CORRUPTED IN GENESIS.. THE LAST DAYS WILL BE LIKE THE DAYS OF NOAH ! NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUN. THAT SATAN CAN DO.. HIS OLD TRICKS ARE STILL THE SAME.. LIKE I SAID DO JOT TAKE ANYMORE VACCINES.. LET YOUR DNA HEAL ITSELF AND PRAY ! GOD BLESS U ALL.. IF WE HAVE TO SUFFER UNTIL THE LAST DAY OR IF WE HAVE TO SUFFER UNTIL DEATH DO NOT GIVE UP FAITH !  DO NOT TAKE ANY MARKS OR CHIPS OR VACCINES ! EVEN UNTIL DEATH..  BELIEVE IN JESUS ! GOD AND THE HOLY SPIRIT !
My dream home!
He doesn't sound the way I picture him to be. I love the vibe of his beautiful home.
God! Kourtney is glowing! and he's such a calm down to earth person . They're literally what each other needed. bless them honestly
Wow! Thanks for teaching us matrasses can be organic! I honestly never thought about that (i try to avoid glue in matrasses though).
He’s is oddly normal and so is his home…and I’m here for it 😎🖤👏
Am just smiling through the whole video ...
I imagined his voice because of his tattoos😬but he sounds like a nice man. I wasn’t expected him with a smooth voice and the coolness of him
Kardashians are witches
Did no one see the candle that said “this smells like kourtneys orgasm” 😅
Wow, bigger fan of him now. Loves his life, loves his girl, loves his kids. Good for him
It’s a nice home. It looks like a home n not a museum. When him and His ex were together, my brother and I saw them walking around Disneyland. We stopped them and I politely asked if my brother could take a picture with him and he said yes. I have a pic of him and my brother at Disney 😊☺️
Beautiful home, but why didn’t Kourtney just sit at the table LMFAO
I just want to hear him Scream at somebody 😂
The candle next to the bed 😭
So happy him and Kourtney found each other 💞
Lol any woman who has to drastically change herself for any man is thirsty and sad lol 😂
Love the style & energy of y'all's home and that kitchen!❤️🧡💚
I love all of it wow 🤩
seems really boring
Just oozes class.
I didn’t realize how spiritual he is. Love his calm vibe! He is Courtney’s match for sure
he got a very unintentionally funny vibe about him
Yes. Just yes.
Love how Travis includes and talks about Kourtneys kids.
He’s so nice and calm ☺️
absolutely love this house & video.
The “this smells like Kourtney’s orgasm” candle 😩😩😩
SplashWoRld🌎The Greatest
I am minimal but wearing leather jumpsuit in mid summer. Hope Travis don't make the Kardashians change his esthetics
Kourtney made it cold and clinical feeling
"I can heat up tea really quick." Not exactly hard LOL. Hit a button.
He seem like such a nice guy 👍
This man doesn't age
I love the house..so homey,  at the same time, touch of vintage bohemian..what is not to love🤗 thank you for sharing🙏
Looks like a robber inside a rich person’s house…
Hes so down to earth I love how simple and homey it is
he and Kourtney are perfect together man, beautiful home, great family like yyyyyeeeeessss girl
Wow his such a humble and sweet person
Best discovery of the year - Travis barker 🌹
So fake!
it's so cute when he says "Kendall, Kourt's sister" :((((((
beautiful home just beautiful
Who is he I have never heard of him
He got engaged with a Transplants' jacket. That says its all <3
He’s so humbled. And I love his home vibe 😍
Ha well well well.....fancy that and good luck to them
His kids and Kourtney's kids are lucky to have him as a father and father figure. He definitely seems like someone I could tell my deepest, darkest secrets to without him judging me. I feel like I could tell him absolutely anything. I love his energy and Kourtney's energy around him. She usually seems fed up with everything and everyone but with Travis she seems very content. Congratulations to you both, finding someone who compliments you like that is rare and wonderful. Embrace it, guys ❤️
Don't fool us... I see Kourtney's touch there... hahahha
Surprised by his voice..vibe and energy...  Wow dad..you are such calming effect.
Minimal is always the way to go.
I think he moved out of that house already kort and Travis just bought another house lol
Travis honestly seems like such a calm, intelligent and well rounded good guy. Good for kourtney
Elevated MTV Cribs
Plain furnishings
Well... Travis is definitely the most interesting Kardashian to watch
This is a beautiful, elegant and sophisticated home 😍
this man is gay
Travis , love your style ! Sometimes simplicity is enough . Thanks for the tip of the matcha station , I'm in the process of reminding my kitchen and we share the same aesthetic. Congratulations to you and Courtney ! Life is short , live it to the fullest 😎
He's so down to earth and intelligent. I'm so glad I watched this.
Travis is a genuine..man...hope him and Kourt lasts...home was beautiful...clean..simplistic...yet still glam...he is the truth .his voice is do dope..he is so calm.. kourt dont drive him away.
he is very modest person and down to earth. he explain everything clearly and so calm :)
Well I see why kourtney is in love with this man. He’s completely soft spoken and zen and seems very sweet.
He looks like somebody who lives in Berlin and loves techno music
Why is the art blurred out 🤔🤔🤔
I discovered Travis a very sweet side !
love how soft spoken he is
We just found out they’ve been together for much longer than they said
Ah, the cute way he touched her feet was somehow so intimate and endearing. What a wonderful human.
I wasn't expecting this. I'm impressed
I’m not surprised that his home is calming . I remember watching his reality tv show . He is a down to earth person. I was actually surprised he was with kourtnery cause I know more about him than her. She seems like a humble calm person I wasn’t expecting . I expected him to change once he was with her but they are nice together they complement each other ❤️❤️
Aliens
You are such a sweet and intelligent and interesting man.  And your home is so beautiful and original.   Thank you for the tour.
Didn’t expect him to be this calm and have this house. Was expecting a dark house with skulls and crazy stuffs. The best thing is that K and him knew each other and were friends before they become romantic. No need to put your best foot forward bs.
He seems so sweet.
I love that he makes matcha, such a peaceful person for a drummer 😂
Kourtney in his shirt for the cameras is so 🙄
LOVE the jumpsuit, Dude.
My vegan brother
This such a better feeling than when Kim and Kanye Kim did theirs… #relationshipgoals#
Cool dude all the way around!
So scripted…. Beautiful place though
Travis Barker = Home Wrecker
Why the blurry bits?
😲😲😲 Beautiful hause
I love how much he loves Kourtney and I love their home 🏡💕
his vintage t-shirt collection is my dream
he is so sweet and genuine omg
It's his eloquence for me!
I'll say this respectfully. Now I get it. 🙏
Don’t forget Fontana ca  Trav 🥂
He is the male version of kourtney
I am most happy for them ❤
It’s very tasteful and has the right balance of coziness. And it has great light. I like how they considered family use. And as a (roller) skater, I love that they had skate/bike spaces.
wtf are you wearing bruh
Has he written a book yet?? Cuz I'm just soo curious about him now he's def not the average dude...🤘💚💖💕
He actually looks pretty peaceful I didn’t expect that from him
I’m screaminggg…loved every moment of the tour🖤🖤🖤
Wish I could see the kids rooms lol
Kourtney Got a Good one 😍😍He seems like a nice person
He's so zen omg
Really enjoyed watching. #YoutubeSuggestion
Beautiful and his energy is calming
She’s the only one that score with someone that has goals ! And not just a show ! With drama .. I feel her she’s and Aries and There very Fun and cool to be around to .. but can be emotionally crazy and that can be to much for some people .
Travis is so chill. Awesome he's vegan.
Love trav but why is he dressed like Michael Myers lol
Very beautiful - clean, warm, and inviting - not over the top (but still wow!)
I didnt like kourt BUT TRAVIS CHANGE EVERYTHING .. THERES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT HIM .. N I APPRECIATE HOW KOURT IS CHANGED A LOTT
Bro voice doesn't suit his personality
Not what I expected. A refreshing change
He seems like a good guy. Well done Kourt
Stunning
That G Wagon tho🔥
His voice is so calming I could listen to him for hours
Love all the positive comments toward Travis ♥️. When they got together (went public), it made sense to me because I’ve been a fan since the early Blink 182 days. He’s a great guy; and like everyone is saying, he’s the perfect example of why we should not judge anyone based on looks. Stay true to yourselves♥️
This house is def my dreams one
The Tour of the (HOME) was truly  very well presented.👍👍
This is pretty cool.
got to say best AD video ever...Travis is authentic and the house is too.
He's a really good & down to earth vibe person . Loved it
Fire who ever dressed u today WOW
what a beautiful person
What a TOOL THIS GUY IS
I can listen to him all day.
He is the sweetest human being ever
Forgot to say to your both congratulations on your marriage, be happy that's all that counts xxxxx
There was something that moved behind the pillows on the bed, hope it wasn't a huge tarantula
The candle " this smells like Kourtneys orgasm" lmao . Interesting
I expected a rude, funky bad boy but to my surprise he comes off very calm and humble, and to live in a place for 16yrs wooosh if I’m not wrong he’s someone that loves to commit! I now see what Kourt sees.
Very nice, inviting home
Fun fact I’ve been there before it’s pretty huge
the candle.
Wow this is amazing lol
Travis, Your House is DOPE, YOU are DOPE, You are a DOPE Dad, and YOU and Kourtney are DOPE as well. I wish you two all the best that LIFE has to offer.
I love seeing someone with such a large home actually uses the rooms and everything serves a purpose for them. It isn’t all just for show in that house!
His voice is totally warming
Love it!!!😊🥤
Don't judge a book by it's cover 💖
I can listen to him all day .  This is very calming
Travis love your house and all the memories you have from Kourtney and all the kids 🥰
Kourtney good pic. He is such a sweetheart and very thoughtful. Glad you found your soulmate.
Wowww his vibe is sooo calming.
Gosh he’s so thoughtful, Kourtney I see why now ❤️‍🔥😘
I hope the Kardashians don’t F him up like the others. This guy is so down to earth and sweet.
I love how he always involved Kourtney in it💕
He seems like a really humble and grounded guy
He’s a beautiful man 🤍
Jesus Christ this was boring
He’s such a cool family guy. I can see how Kourt fell in love with him. His home decor is so welcoming 😍
“I like this life better” I’m so happy for you Travis !
Surprisingly i really liked the house! Its way more homey and practical than a lot of houses theyve shown of others
I literally, got off my bed to grab my phone to leave this comment…. His candle on the nightstand says “this smells like Kourtney’s orgasm” I had to rewind and fact check before I freaked out lmao. Omg I need to know what the smell is just because I’m curious! Sandalwood? Bourbon and vegan milk?? Whhaaaa!?!
Mind blown. All I’ve ever known about him was that he’s a world class musician, was in a disastrous marriage to Shana Moakler and he has a lot of tattoos.  He’s so much more.  Obviously.  He grabbed the only sane, rational and well educated Kardashian. Nicely done, Travis.
I got chills watching this. Travis is so deep.  I love and respect him. Happy for their amazing union.
Lovely decor  You married kourtney, your life will be a mess. N your life will become public.
Beautiful home 🏡 💕 I am so happy for you and your beautiful wife much blessings 🙌
La peor pareja kardashian....Kourtney una hipócrita respecto a su ex y ahora hace lo mismo que él  en sus 20s...pero ahora ella con 40
He reminds me so much of Chester 😢
Did nobody notice the candle next to his bed? :'(
I love seeing a celebrity actually live in a house like a normal person & not just for 2 years & then on to the next one
You are a Sweet Soul😇 You deserve hapiness Enjoy it!
🤩 I thought it would be totally different, but this is sophisticated, clean and with that peace vibe. 💯 % into it
Seems like such a beautiful soul
what a beautiful home😍
I actually like this guy. Seems to be genuine.
Beautiful
I've always liked him but now I really do. He has a calming soul.
Always been a fan of Travis so when he says “I like this life better” with a twinkle in his eye, it really warms my heart. Very telling that he enjoys a minimalist space to think. This man has lived through a lot of chaos and almost died. He just oozes goodness and peace. Beautiful home for a genuine guy.
how Travis looks: 🤘🦹🏾☠️🔗⛓🎶🎛️🔮🥁 how Travis sounds: 😎✌️🌴🏞🛏
He seems like such a sweet , calm guy very good energy I can see why she fell for him !
I love how the kardashian girls will scrape the bottom of any barrel as long as what's there has money.
I see why you and Kourtney have vibed as friends and now as a couple. You two match so well. The house is amazing. So calming and zen with great decor.
Enjoyed this and Travis still seems like a great guy. Really use to enjoy watching him on Meet The Barkers. But did anyone realise the candle says this smells like Kourtney's orgasm?? lolllll
Mattresses can be toxic but so can breathing in pollution from your fireplace that you have going all day long
good
I think I like this guy.
Hell Yeah for the vegan food Travis!!!! 🌱💚🌱💚🌱💚
This is so beautiful
I love how calming he seems & how he had his house designed to actually be utilized daily. ❤️
This house screams Kourtney yet she hasn’t been involved decorating it. It explains a lot how much of a match they are xx
I love how he mames kourtney very often ❤️
Let’s not forget HE IS A LEGEND to this music industry!!! If you know he’s always been like this 👏🏽👏🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽
Cool spot,looks relaxing and calm
His vibe is so calm
He has a very feminine voice… lol
I actually really like it, your home is supposed to reflect you, & that’s exactly what it does 😍
Never even imagine travis would love that clean slate type of house i thought he'll go for more rough and party place style house..
Beautiful home! Travis has a great calming energy about him and  obviously a great father. You go Kourtney!
I have always loved Travis. He is so talented and it’s nice to see him in this way. I wish him and KK a long happy life together.
Wait, kourtney works?
Another empty beige/white house with expensive furniture. Fascinating. Also: terrible terrible outfit. I do not understand why this house is featured.
He looks like he’s dressed in a leather janitor uniform… But he’s in a mansion with a beautiful bride to be so still winning 🏆
ok everthings great but how to be this rich  <crying in poverty> :(:::::
I love him , he is so kind, calme and down to earth 💚💚💚 so much love for him
I love the way he introduced Kourtney's children's chair in their dining table... He already love them too. Wish them both happiness❤️🙏
He seems to be a really nice person, grounded and balanced. So they both live in Calabasas. It's a peaceful and calm house
Whens Kris Jenners house gonna get a newer tour I WOULD LOVE THAT
You deserve this beautiful love Kourtney. Always exuding Family always always always I don’t watch the show but you are the only one from day one I could see God working in your life to show mother’s no matter what stick by your family and your children and love will always find you.
I love how he says “our “ and “my kids” and how he knows where everyone sits at their table..they are perfect for eachother
Wow. I honestly knew nothing about him but OMG he has the most amazing energy. What an peaceful person. His soul is so calming. What a beautiful person. She's a lucky girl. Much love ❤️
U know ur rich when u can say “we spend new years here” about a room in your house
Is this the same house that on mtv cribs?
I was enjoying the tour until Kourtney appeared 🤦🏽‍♀️
I love Travis and Kourtney.  At first, their pairing seemed odd bc I was used to her and her ex but Travis seems to ground her.
Mostly it’s stark and boring
When Travis said “I’m a car guy” I think someone somewhere feels soooooo banged up because Travis had it all and the girl 😜
This man is just so calm and intelligent congratulations on your marriage 🕊 Your wife is very fortunate to have you  as a husband. You just seems to be a loving, patient, compassionate, supportive, caring and authentic man. Continuous love to you Travis
You guys are just too cute together!!!!!!   Glad you both found love again 🙏🙏🙏🙏
Always loved Travis since being a teenager. It’s so nice seeing that he is a nice guy in the real life too.
His home looks very calm and serene. It's a perfect oasis. I like how earthy everything looks, and his furniture is not over the top, the light fixtures are also minimal and work with every space. His art is unique, but also cohesive with the aesthetic of the house. Overall his home gives off a very calming vibe, looks extremely clean, and full of bright energy.
Travis is the best so happy for him and Kourtney ❤❤
GOD ALL DAY🙏🏽❤️
They are so precious and humble.
The epitome of don’t judge a book.
It won't last I give it 27 months  Tops  Sadd
such a decent and beautiful home
Totally not what I expected. He seems soo calm and at peace
So calm and tranquil… I like him think he is totally sexy
I really like Travis, always have. I don't like that she likely dressed him. He looks like a weirdo but I mean... the Kardashians are a cult like family anyways. I hope he doesn't try and become a fashion guru because it just doesn't suit him. Stick to the Rock n Roll stuff Travis. But the home is gorgous!!! He's just so chill, always has been, that is what I like about him.
I love his home! ❤️❤️❤️
Beautiful house,thanks to invite us. Have a very Happy life together in a beautiful home🙏🏾💯👌🏾
Love his energy!!♥️
I’m NO
Pleasantly surprised😀
I love Travis’s vibes! Seems complicated, but simple! Love his house! Simple, very lived in! Congratulations Courtney! You have a winner!
What made him so rich? I dont know him only because of Kourtney. Is he famous?
Kourtney really lucky to have a good person as travis omg , wish you both all the best ❤❤
their voices are too sexual 🤣
has his voice always been like this?
I would never imagine that he is such a kind,grounded and soft spoken person. The house is absolutely beautiful and so calming.
Gorgeous place!!😍🤤
Nice 👍
The older I get, I’m learning how just being authentic to who you are is so attractive. Live, love and simplicity!
kourtney so lucky...
Great decor
Such a tasteful, elegant quality home. Peacefulness exudes…just the way home should be.  Well done to the designer who paid attention to Travis’ inner self.
So well put together.
Ok I get it .  True love for Khourtney.  Because she is Real!  Love her !  The most interesting to me! Go girl. ❤️💫
He has always seemed like such an amazing guy. This was so relaxing to watch and he and Kourtney are true relationship goals. Friends for years and now in love.
His home looks so welcoming.Home style and interior design tell us what his home decor choices reveal about himself.This was one of the best tours that I've watched.
Obviously a stunning home, but what a lovely lovely gentle beautifully spoken guy x
I’ve always had luv for Travis since he was with his first wife. He’s such a great guy and that hasn’t changed a bit. He’s such a calm humble soul. Kourtney is so lucky to have him.  She definitely deserves him after dealing with Scott for all those years.
A weirdo with money abnormal ANIMAL RACE.A LUMANATY FOLLOWER. OBVIOUSLY
I love how there’s so many places for everyone to congregate, you can tell he’s very family oriented ♥️♥️♥️
I love him such a gentle soul!
The Barker's look so good 2gether ❤! The house is lived in and I love that.
This the first time I’ve actually watched a celebrity home tour from start to finish. He is soo soft spoken n sounds like a real gentle. Bless him. Such a clean house. “ he said he doesn’t like dirt.
This guy Travis - he's really someone special - so together and created a wonderful world for himself.  I never thought he was like that.  His voice is so smooth and articulate.  I have to say I am impressed and I was too quick to judge.
What motivates him to have tattoos on his face? Scary. Not much respect for the sacredness of his body.
Love the house
Letting kids ride dirt bikes inside...the rich really live in a different world.
This is the first celebrity house Ives seen that actually looks like a home
He kinda sounds like Kourtney and Kim 🤣🤣🤣🤣 the way he explains everything
Such a beautiful home. 🥰💐
wow 👍
Did everybody just miss him saying at 8:25 that the first day that they hung out and hung out as more than friends he proposed to her
So is kourt moving in here or travis moving into kourts
Not your baby
He is veryy nice person
travis just seems like a wonderful person. i am so happy that he and kourtney found each other!
I really didn't expect to be this invested with his home and he's truly down to earth. It was his explanation of his home for me, that made it so unordinary.  This was one of the best tours that I've watched.
Beautiful,  cosy ...This house is the most one l prefer of all one's of the Kardashians house ..👍👍👍❤❤
I love this house, amazing
Amazing and humble human, love his home it exudes calm and elegance… ❤️
I love this ! Ugh I wish
Very  lovely and warm house!!!!
Love a man who is this calm, and down to earth and genuine and truly cares about family and children.
My fave thing about Travis is, his outer shell makes him seem so hard & sort of angsty but he is so soft spoken and sweet. Such a gentle, compassionate fella.
Where I eat vegan food. Cause who eats just food
he genuinely seems so sweet
Just a regular family man. Smooth.
This is such a beautiful house. I‘d move in instantly and not change anything.
I remember seeing this house I think on his TV show or somewhere like cribs back in the day on MTV. Crazy to think that was almost 20 years ago. He has changed so much, I don't think I'd hear him talking about vegan hot dogs but I guess California does that to you. I just hope he's living his best life, the way his kids make him smile make me think he is. 🤙❤️
Very beautiful home ✨
What a sweetheart of a guy.  So gentle and mild-mannered.
Is that Kourtney Kardashian? I don't know who that guy is but he looks like an old man who just got released from prison. Wow. Has she lost her mind???
Soooooo gorgeous home. love it.beautiful voice Travis have.from Nedherlands.😘🤍
Hes so blessed  the house is beautiful  I think Courtney had a little to do with the decor it's a dream to us mere mortals lol
First time I'm seeing chairs for both husband & wife at the same spot, this is what u call equality 😄
Ppl think it's all about looks you can be very gorgeous outside but if your attitude doesn't matches that your ugly I'll take great personality, a humble spirit,  down to earth person any day over a handsome guy looks can fade in a snap of a finger
Hello Travis ☺️☺️,see you in Blinking Group, great house anyway..
Very normal and simple living space I like it
Buying gifts three Christmas ago?! Anybody else catch that tea? lol
I've never heard Travis speak this much, ever! He seems like a cool guy
He’s so dull and his relationship with Kourtney is so intense. He’s super creepy.
put some pants on. she had to have known cameras were coming, why stage  stupid scene like that?
WELP❗that's all folks, their perfect for each other.....
When he married Miss Teen USA I was shocked...she was so selfish...
Anyone else leave this video wondering if their mattress was toxic 🤣😅
He looks like a reptile humanoid
His taste is so clean really expected it to be dark I don't know why.love it
Did anyone notice the name of the bedside candle omg 😆!! Gwynn Paltrow inspired…
Omg Travis is uber cool 😎  Ive never heard him speak before..he has such a calm vibe. Love 💕
how AD gonna have Scott’s house tour advertised next. MESSY
As much as i loved this entire video, i absolutely cannot ignore the candle at 10:28 no wonder they're head over heels crazy about each other🤍😂
This is amazing 🤩
He's a true example of don't judge a book by its cover . The way he talks and he's specific on details is very eloquent.
Who is Travis Porter ?
This dude needs to eat some carbs looks sick
Love the voice very calm 🤗
He appreciates Buick !! That is what I’m talking about 💯💯💯💯 and Cadillac!!!✅💯💯💯💯💯💙💙💙
HOUNDSTOOTH!!!!!!!! my favorite
I was expecting something different like a house with tattooed walls and punk rocker style or more like him lol but it was far from that
I think they are so cute. Awww I love love 😘
I love that Atiana still goes and sees him....
This dude is super zyn! He's so calm
He’s home has a similar vibe to kims house, and I love it
I knew he was the most stable parent with an extreme over the 🔝 Punk appearance! Dope Zen Energy 🤘🏾
They love each other so much! They are the absolute sweetest it melts my entire heart and soul ❤️
Seem like good guy  just looks like  Jail guy with all those tatoos
Humble soul
The house is massive , pristine and wow! Really never judge a book by its cover. One of my best arc digest videos.
The fact that he constantly tlk about kourtney and their kids
Nagpupumiling sexy si Kourtney dito ah. Pakunwaring nakaupo sa lamesa na naka   oversized na longsleeves at panty. Sexy ka na, wag ka na masyadong papansin..
Travis Hi. I Love Your 💘 Hone. I Love the inside design of Your Remodeled Home. I am moving my items to storage and - I  need a "New 🏡 Home - way north of SF. Please pray for me. Thanks.
oh wow.. a vegan, a loving father and fiance, a warm person... and that beautiful bright warm house.. oh yeah I love him even more
Little bit of my shoes? 😅I have only two so far
You can really see why Kourtney fell for him he’s so sweet and intelligent very nice guy.
the way kourt is glowing
And let’s get real one of the best drummers ever.
Clearly he’s a real down to earth zen guy. Like I had a wake up … the tattoos mean nothing. He’s a good human being. Obviously. He’s a huge example to me of don’t judge a book by it’s cover. Love this guy.
I didn’t know a bed could be organic. Good to know.
When I look his face that will do me  despite being rich or famous
His voice is so soothing.
His voice still like 19yo boy. And he talks calmly. Idk before that travis is a calm guy, i was think that he would overact while talking. He's a calm and relax guy. His voice so soothing
ngl Travis has got such a seductive voice 🥵
I feel like Travis is the definition of cool, calm, and collected    His vibes keep me calm LOL
Man I'd really wanna live in that house. Nothing intricate, yet so stylish and  comfy
Omg 😱 he is really in love with Kourtney. I’m sooo happy for them. I am also happy for my marriage too. We have been married for almost 21 yrs.
They are both lucky to have each other ❤
I love the kitchen
A little bit of shoes in here. Proceeds to show 4 cupboards filled with shoes.
Kinda reminds me of Christian Bale in The Mechanic.
So no one‘s gonna talk about the candle that smells like kourtney’s orgasm?
What a lovely calming perfect home and it's looks beautiful. So surprising that he's ruin his skin with tattoos and looks out of place in such a not-a-thing-out-of-place elegant home.
Kourtney is the only kadarshian who isn't over the top.
Props to AD for documenting the collapse so perfectly.
You failed bro your house sucks
I think I just fell in love with Travis Barker. Way to go Kourt!
He’s clearly very into Courtney, he has mentioned her several times in the first five mins of the video
I quited eating meat a couple of months ago, specially because I feel bad with myself for eating animals, I just don't think is appropiate for me to do that anymore, I love animals and don't want to support the meat industry, I would be contradicting myself by loving animals and at the same time eating them.. I used to laugh of vegeterians but it was just my ignorance, I see how conscious they actually are
Am i the only onw who dont like the house? :S
I dont like the way Kountney  wearing or acting... She seem trying to be a sexy  = seductive at wrong time 😅
Candle beside the bed....Smells Like Courtney's ....... 😂😂 Tarantula's means good luck and/or money, people do not kill them.
Ok for a punk rock guy, I love how minimal and calming his house is
Love this dude and love that they are so in love with each other. Absolutely beautiful. That’s how I would want my home to look like. Thanks Travis for sharing.
12:56 am 5/22/2022
beautiful home... views are amazing... the outdoors in general are our favorite place to be...  don't like spiders too either....
you are awesome... Kool vibes. God bless you and yours...  shalom'

Awwww gorgeous home and sweet couple and lovely family
Sweet person👍🏽cool guy
Wow it is a perfect house
Travis has always been a chill dude. He seems like he'd be cool to hang out with.
In this interview he did not say not one bad word, love it.
Heaven bound? Have you ever lied, stolen used God's name as a curse word (O-M-G)? According to God's law, you're guilty,ignorance will not be an excuse... But wait, God loves you, he made a way out. God so loved the world that he gave his only son that whoever believes in him will not die but have everlasting life. John 3:16 Please think about it. Repent/believe before the rapture, before the one world government. Jesus died for you. Love U
Travis your are the greatest!I love watching u play I’m 64 and my son turned me on to blink 182 way way back . I still listen all the time! Thankyou for this video. I hope U and kourtney stay together forever u deserve each other. Love ❤️ u both!
I really like this dude. I'm a 45 yo married black woman who of course grew up in a time of MTV not just BET. He seems sweet and they appear to be in love and including the prior kids. It's great
I love how he loves his children so much. Such a loving father.
I hope open machine gun Kelly's home  next time.
I actually enjoyed this video.
He mentions lot of bands and artists but not his own (blink-182) 😂
Wow, his tattoos are so intimidating and he always looks so serious in his photos . But he seems like such a humble and kind gentleman.
Great style. Happy for them
Okay "LeBron never came & picked his up??!!" Rich ppl amaze me -- *how u gonna have so much money u forget to pick something up that is $25,000!!!*  He could have easily donated it to charity if it wasn't that important to him 👎👎👎
So wait are they married and still living in Seperate houses?! I know it just happened, but it doesn't sound like he plans on leaving anytime soon ...that's kinda cool if so, bc I always said when I was younger, that if I got married, my partner and u would have seperate houses!
Who would have ever thunk his style was this cool!
Wow how planted was she just pretending to work on the laptop 🤣
Barf
He is so zen and I loveeee the way him and Kourt love one another and their kids! 🖤🖤🖤🖤
How long they’ve been dating
I like more the Kourtney's house
He’s vegan??? 😍😍😍
Beautiful home you have.
I see why Kortney is into Travis. He is really chill & Zen. I like that. They are cute together. I like being home & my Me Time too, I do like going out but there’s no place like home. Much ❤️
w o W ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The candle that says *"this smells like Kourtney's orgasm"*
I love the way he talks & his voice.  This house is Beautiful. Classy. Everything. 🖤🤍
Kids asking from granma:where our mom?your mum living with another man.
Wonderful home and nice guy wish everyone happiness 🏡 🍵 😇
He’s really great. So glad I got to watch this and see who he is. He’s so incredibly humble and well-spoken. I can see why Kourt is so in love. He slays
Beautiful home. I love Travis' vibe
Not really a fan but after watching this, I think Travis rocks! 😂
I love one story homes that are spacious. I feel two story homes are too much. At least for me
Beautiful 😍 im gonna replicate some of his home vibe dor my own house 😍😍🙏🏻
All this talk of non toxic, organic, vegan, love your body and he’s covered in toxic ink 🤦‍♀️
The more he talks and shares what is important to him throughout the house the more I fall for him.🥰🥰
He seems like such a sweet soul and his home is beautifully inviting.
What am I missing here? Jesus
Lovely home and he is a sweet man. How warm that he cares about the table seating. Just cool.
I don't think you have the right chairs or  sofas. Courtney had to sit on the kitchen counter.
Nice😍😍😍😍😍
" Iam never here " this hurts actually...making a lot of money and at the end of the day you realize you can't be at a place where you wish to be
“I like this life better. I think it’s better.”   Good for him. Glad to see him happy. ☺️
I love how simple n minimalist his house is. It not fussy or overwhelming with stuff. I have only one thing to say n its about him having an organic mattress. Great. My question is, mattress can have many toxins but not all that ink all over his body?  Make this make sense😵‍💫
I like the seating never changes at the table.. normal family stuff
Way to go Kourtney on buying him that car very niceee
Rich people how indulgent
Wow what a beautiful yard 😍
Hi Travis!  You have a beautiful home. May God Bless and keep you always:)
Dude, you need some cool movie posters in the theatre room!
The vintage t shirts sooo cool bro
I love the down to earth rocker who have softy hearts 💕🥰💕🥰 I find them so hot 🔥🔥 and sexy.
Beautiful house. Calm demeanor.  Seems  like a great guy.
My dream music room 😍🔥
He's an artist.
Looks peaceful. Not too showy opulence
Congratulations to Kourtney and Travis on getting married .
That prob why he looks so emancipated and like he has a testosterone hormone is missing problem. It's the Veganism. ??  Ide love a Gwagon.
He's got great taste. Artists rock
Absolutely beautiful home
Beautiful home! ♥️♥️♥️
https://youtu.be/kpJUv4gqALY.............
Travis home is very comfy, classy , elegant and beautiful 🏡❤️I think Travis is a good father and family man that's why Kourtney loves him.
I thought his house would look like it screams ROCK AND ROLL!!
I just love them together! Their vibe 🔥
I love his house and it’s my favorite color, Beige!
Very beautiful 😍
Amazing home. Really love the vibe. Kudos to the designer. My father had a Grand National and it was his baby
He’s sure living his best life!!!
What's with the space suit? 😕
What a nice guy. I was totally blown away with how much he’s a down to earth kind of guy. Really seems sweet
So sweet kourtney got her match. He’s down to earth like her
Barker is the definition of don’t judge a book by its cover
the most unrealistic part was kourtney at the kitchen
why he shaved hes beard!!!😳😳😳he look way better!!!! be blessed!!!
bmx! yes luv it.
🔥🔥🔥 Nice to learn more about your personality
I love his aura, this was so relaxing to watch
Aren’t Tattoo’s toxic?
As an older woman of 64, it's very rich but not warm & Comfortable with Family Pictures & Personality. Just saying...... ✌
THANKS
Travis vibe seems so Zen.....lovely house tour
his face is scary😂
This house is amazing...not over the top but justcomfortable and spectacular...love it
why does he look so pale and sick...i hope he isnt on Meth like ur typical rock star
Wow nice house travis. Thank you for sharing. ❤️
Oh yeah, l Love your house, wonderful taste🙂😁😎😍😘
I never really knew anything about Travis until Kourtney. I could tell he seemed like a really nice, cool, loving, attentive guy for her. This shows me l was right. This is one interview l hate for it to end, he is so smart, introspective & a great catch for her. I'm happy for them & l especially liked how he gave her a loving touch when he walked over to her. No offense, but l think she's been needing someone who really gets her & what she needs as a woman. Go Kourtney!!! Congratulations on your marriage!!!
This house actually looks like a house xD
Omg I really like this house❤ Travis surprised me
4:28 Kourtney trying to get attention  Cameraman: Not today ✋
he's right on with the clean energy and neatness of the floor plan is amazing
What a beautiful, serene & peaceful home! Makes me love this guy even more ♥️
I’m so happy for kourtney he seems like the sweetest calm intelligent genuine person I wish them so much happiness a long and prosperous marriage and life together ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Guarantee you that Kardashian is only with him for the money. All there about
I haven't seen 1 damn supra in any of these peoples videos
That Buick though ❤️❤️❤️
Love it!
This channel 💩’s on MYV Cribs, very sophisticated 👍🏻
I amazed him ,he have a rosary
Never realized how chill Travis is ... I dig it!  Beautiful house.
Kourtney has the best guy,I love Kanye even though he's not with kim anymore,I love how calm Travis is,he's so well matched to Kourtney,he's the total opposite to Scott
He is superb!
Wow ok first time I’ve heard him speak… his very calm and charming….. very unexpected. His image is hardcore not sure what I expected. What a lovely bloke.
I have the same vintage Bauhaus t shirt....Bad music for bad people..CRAMPS...I absolutely love that record..it's so Great 😃😃
This was very surprising he’s seems very humble, grateful and thoughtful thanks ad
The way celebrities name their kids...lol....name your kid Chris, or Mark....enough with the overly creative naming
Travis you and Courtney’s are one of the most beautiful loving couples that I have ever seen in a long time  stay that way because it is genuinely beautiful And the beautiful love you have shown people that love is still in the air and is beautiful I love you guys stay blessed
Architectural divest.
She is not pregnat yet...
BMX!!!
I love him!😍
ngl I didn't care for Travis before this video but he won me over
When he bought that house years ago, who's his wife then?
I see why KK married him. She's blessed to have him~
One of the calmest and peaceful man, so happy for Kourtney that she can finally get what she deserves. Travis Barker love the decor of the house😍❤❤❤
Travis is the definition of if he could he would
Omg I love his energy , Travis always comes off to me as artistic ,calm and just like a minimalist in everything and his house proves that completely. Congrats on be newly married. All the best.
Awesome Travis, such a cool dude...and I love how he cant get enuf of Kourtney...its beautiful to watch!!!
This dude 's taste is so impeccably awesome!!!!!
#freepalestine
Such a chill guy ❤️
Simples, afável e simpático! Uma boa casa ,mas melhor as bombas dentro da garagem !
I'm surprised at how Kourtney made an appearance in her pj's and didn't get all flashy Kardashian for the house tour.🙂
Beautiful home is all I have to say. No comments about him.
He’s so cool
they are just head over heels in love with one another!!!
do a tour of his studio plzzzz
The fact that he raised his kids, tells me he has a family values. Very grounded, intelligent, kind. He is a keeper.Kourtney grumpy mood better change. To 😊 She hit the jackpot with Travis. What a chill guy. It's true what they say. Fame & money only magnify the person who you really are. That wedding party is definitely going to be off the charts.
this is the first time i saw travis barker spoke. initially i thought he spoke like MGK
Oct 17 2010 is the day I met the Love of my life and we have been together inseperable ever since. Amazing I'm so Happy for the both of you!!! #4EvA!
A vegan with all his leather car seats……
Now if they would only stop the pda..not cute at her age
why bro out here lookin like a car mechanic
I am happy that they found each other, may their relationship go from strength to strength. ❤️✌️🏽
Headspace should hire Travis.
He is one in a million because most rich ppl does over do it when it comes to their homes. Objective is to have peace, quiet and comfort
Find his home very calming.
It is so nice to see you so happy! You have been through so much and not only survived….you have thrived! Best wishes for you Travis and your family forever! ❤
Love this kid! Never rate the book by its cover…I would love to have him as my son in law anytime! Wish both the best, and hopefully the Hollywood lifestyle doesn’t rob away their love story. Congratulations 🎉🍾🎈🎊
I watched the reality show with Travis and his first wife and their baby. It was years ago. I was a very kind person from what I saw on the show. Beautiful home.
He said: "cacau", like in portuguese . Really nice
Okay Travis is completely opposite to what he looks in the best way possible
travis barker: this tarantula was one of the scariest things in my life   also travis barker: *survived a plane crash*
Love the house and I am a sucker for fireplaces too. It was nice to see he's such a family man. I was impressed he was so soft-spoken and humble.
Travis has a calming voice. Was that the home ex lived it? Just wondering. May be awkward!
What a beautiful house, just love it 😍
Black Flag-ok, we are off to a good start...   Then it got really weird with the "positioned wife" on the counter  while guided by Travis in a onesie  Devo  leather-like Hefty garbage bag.  Dude, come on.  And the BMX bikes-Dior? Are you kidding me,  those are a re-sprayed Mongoose and Skyway 26" cruisers. Dior... hahaha.
I have always liked Travis Barker and now even more. Such a beautiful home. And I am very happy for him and Kourtney ❤️
Wowwwwww! A matcha station! Matcha station. Omg a matcha station! They said matcha station. They both said matcha station. Did anyone see that matcha station. Yeah they have a matcha station. A what?? A matcha station. Didn't I tell you? What? They gotta matcha station.
i think iam very judgmental #regretmodeon
Nice my favorite Kourtney happy for her and Travis
I would never judge a book by its cover again. I am so impressed by his conversation. Lovely 🏡. But, there are lots of skull and skeleton images l wonder why?
Now I see why Kourtney loves him he really truly adores her, everything she has given him he kept spect and letting the world know, know mater how big or small. He does speak how he looks, and his home is very nice and com. Speak already a package deal for both
who wasnt expecting kourtney to be looking normal
Travis is chill  man.. like a retired Bruce "Batman"  Wayne
He is so different from how he use to be. No more old schools seems like he went super fashion and Hollywood. Kardashians got another one.
Sunday dinners were a staple for my family and my kids have carried it on with their children. Many of our best memories are from those dinners with my Mom and Dad - the babies running wild- all the kids swimming and cookouts. It’s a great way to stay connected.
Just under 10,000 sq ft nbd
16 years in a house for a celebrity?  This is surely a cool and humble guy.
he’s very passionate
I can imagine Kourtney very comfortable in his house. Really simple and elegant as her.
He genuinely seems like such a great guy.
Perfection!
Dior bike...
Kourtney, pyjama with that make-up on? Do we live in the same world?
Really when I look at this guy he looks devilish but his voice and his house are the opposite. Appearance counts but it's not everything.
He is surely going to love to Kourtney's house since Kardashian like to have control on every men around them.
I loved the bed most
Calls himself a car guy... Leaves on a bike a few secs later.
Very cool 😎
wait till her loud kids come over no more quiet there LOL
What a nice man and home! But his girlfriend shouldn't sit on the kitchen counter where food is prepped  ... or atleast put some pyjama bottoms on !
Thank you, love everything,all so perfect and calming and tranquil.
Who
There's zero personality I n this man.
I did not accept his voice to b lik that thou
I love this couple and their vibe. 🫶🏻
Not Travis Barker not teaching us all to honor our joy in a house tour
I remember his episode of MTV cribs, he has remained true to his Cadillacs.
I think I like him now🥹❤️
What is the song playing at the beginning of the video?
What a kind and gentle soul! Much continued happiness and love to you and your family.
Travis has plenty of room for his children and for Kourtney and family
Reptilian race, sorry
Travis looks like Lord Voldemort!
OMG I love the matcha station its so dope, also hes chill forgot to add that.
Sounds like a puff.
❤️❤️❤️♠️♠️♠️
It says a lot about him that he has stayed in the same home for so many years and remodeled and worked on it instead of just up and move somewhere else
love how humble he is
Dude you married a kardashian…things are not looking up - you survived a plane crash I don’t think your going to survive  this
I clicked because of CK
I love his energy. And you can tell he was a very involved loving parent. His kids have his little laugh too it’s so cute to see them interact cuz I see Travis in both of the kids
He is so composed. Thank you for letting us in your home.
A very likable, sensitive person.  Thanks for sharing your beautiful home.
This home is amazing and I am a new fan of his! He has such a peaceful spirit, the kind of person I'd like to have around! KUDOS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
WTF has happened to Robocop?
This was one of the first male driven house tours I really enjoyed! Not pretentious, a smart , good human sharing his beautiful home. He clearly is passionate about his family, his art and the possessions that make up his home.
Travis is so calm and chill. Beautiful home. Kourtney really found a good man!
Looks ok not my taste.
What a nice guy. Beautiful home !
Travis and Kourtney 🥰
He seems really a cool guy
Damnnnn, the views on this episode
That's an amazing home!
His voice 🤩
you should do Demi Lovato house tour. i would be amazed
I LIKE HOW HARD YOU ROCK A SIMPLE SET OF DRUMS
Travis Barker has always been so cool and chill.... nothing new to me. Use to watch their tour videos, and backstage stuff.
Pottery Barn 101  Yay
Finally she found someone who won’t laugh at her organic lifestyle! Kudos
Yo! Really loved his vibe and his home. Bravo!
OMG they are giving me diabetes
Questionable jumpsuit
Thank you for sharing sister Kourtney 🙏🙏🏿🙏🏻🙏🏼🙏🏽🙏🏾
travis has always seemed like a sweet guy. he seems so at peace with himself.
Awesomeness 🦋💚🌈🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
He is lovely. Kourtney is a nightmare
LA people are so bizarre.
I ONLY watched this to see if he bare-handed dog poop off the floor & carried it with him like he did years ago in Mtv Cribs.
I never noticed before how much kourtney looks like her mother 🤔. Nice place.
His house looks amazing..
does anyone know why some pieces of art are blurred and others not?
"..he decided to create doors that open..." lol
Beige is just boring..
Nothing special. Because of Travis's style, I imagined something more eccentric
He’s so sweet
Вот так живут панки))
It definitely is not cozy.
Kourtney is soo much happyer with Travis..like a weight has been lifted off her shoulders..he is calm and kind and values his family ..She always looked unhappy with Scott. Congratulations to the newlyweds.
I love them as a couple.  His is voice so calming.  I watched twice to listen to his voice.  😌😌🧘🏾‍♀️🧘🏾
Wow, Travis' taste in decor is the same as mine, pure riot of minimalism throughout his house. The color of his cars is spectacular, the organization of his closet is very clean and neat, the patio is beautiful and very cozy, it's very family-friendly. Anyone would think that his appearance would be disorganized and no, make no mistake, appearances are deceiving. What an organized man. IMHO!
So impressed with Travis Barker. So calm, caring and good.
You mean to tell me kourtney preferred to sit on the counter where you eat then in a chair? Is the house really clean? Lol 🤣
❤️
Ice 🧊 nice 👍🏻
once you get over the voice he's pretty cool
I definitely judge a book by its cover and watching this wasn’t what i expecting. I was expecting more like museum / minimalist decoration but his house really have the homey feelings. The way he talks about his kids and the memory in the house show me a glimpse what he is, a good family man.
Idk why I never heard him talk before but he sounds so soft spoken lol
You have a beautiful home.
IM GLAD YOU DID THIS TRAVIS. IT LETS US KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOUR ABOUT. SO HAPPY THAT YOU AND KOURTNEY  FOUND TRUE LOVE.
So cool
I was about to say he better say Mason . Love them love Travis he’s a good dude
Urgh goals. He’s so soft spoken and kind.
The use the word matcha too matcha. Lol!
I really really like his calm vibe! It's calming just listening to him
All the point in his house that I heard most of it related to his children comfortable when doing school homework. He such a good dad.
Very clean, minimalist, and functional design. The house flows very well and it seems very Zen
That outfit screams midlife crisis...sir rethink your fashion choices! What's his age again???🤦
To many stuff in the house. I like his cars
He likes wearing a black trash bag while he walks around his house
His house is really beautiful
At different buffets, I'll sneak corndogs in with me. I carry them in my jacket pockets. I place them with the other buffet food. Then it's a great joy for me watching other patrons eat my conrdogs thinking they were from the buffet.
I've never heard him talked before so I'm pleasantly surprised. He seems nice and just fun to be around. He is interesting!!! and it looks like he really love his family.
I love this house. It’s truly a home for a family!
He has such a calming voice
People let AD into their house when I want to sell so I guess he is moving in with Court soon!
I love seeing band shirts in his closet, makes sense! It’s great. I can be “girly” and love to wear heels and makeup but his closet is my dream closet, just sweats and band shirts.
I’m not one to want a minimalist styled home but Travis’ chill vibe with cool personality combo does a whole subliminal commercial messaging thing on you and left me feeling like - ‘if I had that home I’d be as chill and cool as him’ and was totaling wanting to live there by half way through - haha not that I really think things work like that - BUT legit did get those feels. That dude has a one of kind spellbinding personality!
Very chill guy, seems like a great family man and his house is a (beautiful) home!
I don't get it between these two faced I'll give it a year or two
Travis barker the way he talks sounds gay
Nice vibe 🙂😊 They speak the same language and great energy ☺️
He has such a calm energy
Wow...the home is beautifull... And your soul too! Much love
What a sweet guy.
"This smells like Kourtney's orgasm" 😭😭
Hello Travis yes exactly u are absolutely right. Honestly it can be really DANGEROUS if u have too many people in your house on any occasions cause we really don't know if they can really be TRUSTED! When u have too many people in your house especially birthday parties then when the party is over after a few days then u might encounter some of your stuffs gone MISSING!
The contrast with scotts video is glaring. Makes sense why k is with him.
10:29 the candel I-💀💀
I love his soothing, soft-spoken energy <3
I’m stunned… he’s actually quite articulate….
His house is low key boring asl but he seems cool
Beautiful soul
Was anyone else sad how blink 182 was such a huge part of his life but he didn't even mention it, forget having memorabilia about it around the house
His house is pretty dope
Why are some art pieces pixelated?
they keep blurring out the bearbricks like we don’t know lol
i love his home!! it’s definitely my vibe—lots of natural light, big windows, lots of space and minimalism. i would actually live there and love it.
4:00 that was the dorkiest
This house is the nicest, most positive vibe home I've seen.  Love it!!
Candle at 10:27 looool
I'm not a fan but he's so chill and cool And that's house is impressive
I saw the wall and the chronic, do yall know which other albums were in that painting?
He is extremely intelligent
What a beautiful home <3
His voice wasn’t what I expected it to be. He’s very calming, intelligent and humble
kourtney orgasm scented candle lmao
He said VEGAN.
I loved everything about this ✨
Kourtney has a keeper
I love how Kourtney is taking a step back in uer life and allowing Travis to be the celebrity and she seems so comfy being just his wife and a homemaker !! Love this for her !!
Might as well have a big sign saying black lives matter since you're all into black that's a sign of picture
Haha haha Courtney haha he says welcome to my home wasn't isn't it supposed to be welcome to Courtney and my home haha Chloe's got the best boyfriend in the world Scott he's the best and your scarlet fools standing there probably can't even feel body you're such a fool Courtney we don't watch you no more we just look how you both look so yucky and black it's hard to say that but it's real truth Courtney is so dumb Chloe is awesomest Kardashian of them all your brother two normal people and a messed up family Courtney poor kids that you have poor kids I'm glad they're with Scott cuz you're all about Black black everything black clothes you don't look very well with your husband you guys are just doing it for pictures and then kiss me nothing is really really and you guys life it's all on camera it's all the show so I can't wait till you burn out
why his voice is so soothing?
I truly enjoyed this. Listening to home speak is so comforting. His home looks so welcoming.
he loves kourtney so much
Okay now it makes sense why Kourtney is with Travis, he's so above Scott who was a total jerk, leech riding the Kardashian Koattails for most of his life.
They'll likely they'll sell this one and buy another. Stars ALWAYS get a spread in Arch Disgest before they sell.   ARch digest is really just a magazine for rich people selling their homes disguised as an interior design rag.
Love this!
Wanted to see his BMX’s. Bah Boh!!!
I love his vibe. This would be me. All one level and zen! I love it.
This is incredibly cringe =) rich people…
You can see how much more chilled and happy kourtney is with him. Now I understand why
i was having a breakdown earlier and went to youtube to further bring myself down. but i saw this first and truly, his voice, his presence, and the peacefulness of his house calmed me. i am very happy for he and kourtney💖
Travis Barkers home is beautiful,  a true reflection on Mr.Barker himself.   Much love and peace to him and his new bride.
Alright so up next Travis Barker matcha recipe please.
Super. 🌹🌹🌹
when he said vegan food i DIED🤣😭😭
All white interior? Of course, it is. Everything lacks style and color nowadays.
“ this smells like kourtneys orgasm “
When I saw the picture of him on this add,.  I'm like what OLD MAN is that!!!!   Man Travis have you AGED!!!   My GOD I was Shocked to see how much you've AGED !!!
Travis loved ur home, but guys please watch closely to the first big pillow at minute 10:58 ..... man it moved by it self!!!!!!! 😱😱😱
His so sweet and I love his house
Travis barker dope
he obviously didn't waste his $$$
Kourtney Kourtney😩❤️
I really admire Travis' composure, dude's so chill.
I swear October 17th is a day meant for true lifetime lovers. My parents married on the 17th of October and their first 2 children were born on the 17th. The only thing that separated them was death. I can see this marriage between kourt and Travis lasting a long time. He’s so easy going and calm.
His house is beautiful, minimal and clean. I actually love it a lot 👍🏼
I love Zen mood in the whole interior design style😘
https://youtu.be/kpJUv4gqALY.....
Did anyone noticed something literally has crawled behind the pillows 10:57 👻
love his voice, calming..
So beautiful
❤️❤️❤️❤️ Thanks for sharing!
Clothes by Hefty
Beautiful home
A beautiful home and a relatable artist. Very tasteful and exceptionally designed. I am, however, at awe how much STUFF people in his paygrade have. Don’t get me wrong, he earned the money and can do how he pleases, of course, to me it is difficult to fathom how he can talk about minimalism and having in only one dressing room so many clothes that he could wear it for about 3 years without repeating once. No to mention the many cars and such.
« How much Kourtney work » 💀
Now I see why he and Kourtney are married ,so right for each other, same taste, same humility, same composure ... I really judged him wrong with his look ... Man is well spoken, humble and articulate..most importantly A FAMILY MAN .....may God continue to bless your union ❤️
I'm surprised that this modern house gives me a cozy feeling
10:34 can someone explain ?
Kourtney loves organic. And interior. And travis just fits to it. Not to mention bonus on family oriented. Kourtney definitely found a keeper. Love his house and style. And i can see Kourtney doing interior design someday.
Very nice
He is so calm !
His house is 1000% European vibes.
Cringe moment 03:53...in the kitchen 'this is my fiance..' Arghh FFS!!!
wow he knows how to realy spend his money.Maybe he should buy another car.Does he have gold toilet paper also?
I love his house but I don't care for his getting side tracked with so many personal things unrelated to the house architecture. I couldn't care less who sits on which chair in the dining room or which room he watches a list of really specific events from.
fine!
Romans 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
Of course he’s amazing guys, he’s a Scorpio! 💁🏽‍♀️♏️🦂
i didn't cant finish the video!!!
I think this is the first time I really loved the house from start to finish...
I love how "casual" Kourtney appears there hahaha
Odds on how long till they get a divorce?
I thought I was gonna see more Kourtney 🥲. Still nice to see why she fell for him.
How Is the drummer of all members the only relevant one from blink-182?
I'm confused. Are the shiny coveralls for working on cars? Are they for sleeping? Are they for sleeping under cars? Did he fall asleep under a car to get run over having his body horribly marked so he wears them to protect himself from it happening again? So many questions...
The vegan leather jumpsuit really did it for me.
What the hell you wearing
I love how clean and organised his home is! Ahh
Cool
Americans about a kettle  "look at this amazing device, I can heat up tea really quick"
Amazing house, great vibes. Just thought the fiancée was in a very forced pose… who sits in their ‘winnie the pooh’ pijamas (no pants), in full make up, on the kitchen counter to look at their computer? 🤦🏻‍♀️
Thanks for sharing Travis! I love your style and the way you think. ❤️❤️❤️
very humble person.
4:50 Is that what you told your Tattoo Artist?? Coz ahhh??
Well good luck travelling together... It ain't gonna work
4:24 Fun Fact: Those hanging kitchen lamps are designed by Famous Finnish architect Alvar Aalto. Their name is a "Hand grenade" as their shape refers to German WW2 "Potato masher" granade.
travis was always calm and mysterious back in the golden blink days. its crazy to see where he is now. also still humble and calm. i feel his lifestyle is also like humble famous rich lol. doesn't have ridiculous amount of cars, home studio is somewhat simple. and hes been living in the same house for years it seems lol.
Ppl in the comments talking about how they disliked him initially because of his look , i mean what’s wrong with his look? And second who still judges people by their look in 2022 ? 😂 🤣
I really love the houseee
Is this guy the calmest person on the planet?
He should do car ads!!!
I just love love this house. When he talks abt fireplaces and coffee omg im like, he is my kind of a guy... love every thig abt this house.. clean and neat ❤
Comes across as a lovely guy.
Weird man getting weirder….
Never realised that I've never listened to this guy talk. A bit on the feminine side.
11:37 mayhem 🤘🤘🤘🤘
Aaaaaw a khortney am soooooo happy for you...the love in your life is real and contagious...and you deserve every bit of happy....after all the crap you put up with Scott .. Travis is your happily ever after...and after watching the way you guys are ...I know for a fact God will always restore everything you had lost....love you guys to bits and wish you well with your baby journey and your sweet kids...your amazing blended family and the love is so real😘😘😘😘
Does he have a special room for Cocain?
Why don't we ever see kids rooms?
Can he feel his face? He SOUNDS like he's had too much botox 😂
有品味的居家
This house is so boring and drab. I like walking into someone’s house and immediately knowing it’s their house. This feels like a hotel or something
This smells like kourtneys what??😂
I lovedddd his bedside sentimental items. Sooo cute. Loved watching this!!
These comments are funny. He’s was a band geek from Fontana? What did you expect? Anyway nice crib Baron von Tito, you’ve made a beautiful home.
He is so well spoken, calming & intelligent, totally opposite of what I thought him to be. No doubt why Kourtney choose him over Scott. Congratulations to the newly wed couple 🤍
I thought the house would be a complete goth theme. But it is homely and warm.
He seems so soft and kind 😊😊
wowowow
T shirts are life
Eww he looks like death and Kourtney looks like  her mom.
love watching my favourite podcast penguins 🐧 ❤️ 🐧  love from London, England 🇬🇧 ❤️
He seems so chill and eloquent
amazinggg
Wow his tattoos makes him look like Rebel! But he is definitely a great example of can’t judge a book by its cover! I love this dudes Aura 🙌🏽
Kourtney needs to get off the laptop because she’s knows She got no work to do
Beautiful couple...
I really love his vibe and his voice. so calming. love his style!
Its enjoyable to hear him speak, you almost wanna close your eyes and listen to him. He just exudes Good Guy
That was f COOL
Now they are married
This dude vibrates on a different frequency. He’s very aware and intentional about everything.
When they say don't judge a book by its cover he is a classic example.  The calmness of his nature and the house not what I was expecting one bit.
Such  a vibe! The home is aesthetically pleasing, there’s a sense of calmness & relaxation, very functional and I really enjoyed hearing him speak. 🙌🏾
His vehicles are 🥵🔥
This looks like a home not a gallery... very cosy and warm
I love him. He's such a down to earth person. He has a kind soul and gives off nothing but good energy.
I have to say, this house is one of my faves. It's so clean and classy. It has a nice vibe.
Beautiful Home 😍
I like Travis. I like his home. He's the kind of guy that is simple, no drama, and caring.
How unexpected! He’s kinda down to earth and “normal”...nice
Make no mistake, decades of rimshots can potentially crush your nuts! But, this kid can slam some slap tones!
I can't believe he married a Kardashian. Beautiful house though.
I feel at peace hearing Travis speaking 😩
Travis has that chill vegan vibe❣️
Omg he is a sweetheart.
nice taste, and even the cars
NOT THE JABS AT SCOTT BOUT KOURT AND HIM SPOILING EACH OTHER “YEARSS” BEFORE THEY WERE TOGETHER LMAOOO
I like him more after seeing this video! He is so humble 😎😎😍😍😍
Very nice, love everything about your home..especially your tea station.🖤
Them Dior bmx are the most expensive things I ever wanted :,( one day though one day
Very nice house,with the black colors i love😎🤩
"This candle smells like Kourtney's orgasm" HAHAHA 🤣🤣
What did the designer do I guess and kourtney sitting up there so cheesy I can't he seems cool and extra large in the pouch area
All that really matters is Jesus loves u! Do you know Him?
Realising how poor I am
What a great peak into the head of  Travis.  I was pleasently surprised.
Travis seems like a very sweet guy.😊
He’s so humble. Kourtney is lucky
Such a quaint home .. I like
Everyone commented about expecting skulls and corny punk stuff must've just heard of Travis because of Kourtney. smh --- Travis has been that dude.
House is amazing, wtf is he wearing?
Guauuuuuu  WHERE A NICE GUY...... IM REALLY SURPRICE HOW SWEET HI IS! LOVE YOU HOUSE!
The way he touches her legs and foot !! Yessss
What happened to Travis scott
Adam levine without skulls 😂😂
🤪💀☠☠👽💩
He’s so precious loved him since I was able to walk and able to hold a drum stick told my mom I wanna be just like Travis Barker when I grow up and still do ❤️ 24 years later thank you trav
The way he said “what’s the movie with the x in it “ my heart can’t take ittttt 🥺🥺🥺❤️
"I don't like too many people in my home" lol same!!!!!!!
Consider where your soul will spend eternity, heaven or hell.  You don’t want to end up in hell because you rejected the Sacrifice Jesus has made all who repent and turn to him by faith.  We are all guilty of sin.  We lie, steal and look with lust in our hearts.  We are all Guilty before a Holy and Righteous God.  GOD is not just all loving and overlook your sin.  He is loving, but sin He will Judge because He is Perfectly good. The Good news is God the Father sent His Son Jesus Christ who was perfectly Holy to pay the penalty for your and my sin out of Love for us.  We can’t keep the Law we break most all commandments.  But Jesus fulfilled ALL by his perfect thoughts, words, deeds and motives for us because we could not. Jesus loved all humans and God the Father perfectly.  Turn, repent of your sin and confess Your thankfulness for what Jesus did for you.  Put your faith in the perfection and the righteousness of Christ.  Jesus was raised from death to give you new life; death has been defeated. Out of love and grace eternal life is promised to those who have faith.                                      ,/.,.,/  , /., /. , ./, ./, /,                                                                        ,./ ,/.,.,/.....
In almost every room he mentions Kourt 😍
Travis B is so nostalgic for me, became a Blink fan in 2003. So glad to see he's doing well, what an amazing home.
He's kind of creepy now. I wonder if he's been branded like Pete.
Great choice kourtney
I love, love, love the kitchen.
These guys are my favorite celebrity couple. I hope they "literally" stay together forever.❣💘💯
no wonder she loves you... you're an amazing person
After watching,...I started craving Macha latte
When he was telling AD where everyone in his family sits, I laughed because in the new ep of the Kardashians it was a different seating arrangement 😂
Tanta hambre en el mundo, tantos niños  muriendo  por falta de alimentos y esta gente sin discreción  en mostrar sus riquezas. Ya no es agradable esto en este mundo actualmente  incluso en medio de una guerra y personas sin casa. Tache para este periódico humano.
Lots of parallels here https://youtu.be/cwtQD9ioOc4
i like how he said MY HOUSE the whole time !!
bruh
This is just MTV cribs for adults.
Never judge a person by their  outward apperance.  Travis is so sweet. Love the home.
Cool guy and cool house!
I love it💎
Jesus loves you and died for our sins amen beautiful day to serve the Lord Jesus ❤️❤️
Pro tip for Travis or anyone watching--keep your matcha in a metal can or at least an amber jar. Sunshine exposure oxidizes it and it will lose its antioxidants (and turn rancid) quickly :)
I remember watching him on MTV with his first wife and kids years ago. He was an excellent husband and father, so I'm sure he's the perfect man for Courtney.
DTA
🤣🤣 oh yes I'm sure he fixed it up for the camera! Don't believe all the hype.   I mean you actually believe he has books every where? Hahah wanna be.
bro doesn't smile
Alejandro speitzer next
He is so different in what you expected but the way he is with Kourtney you know it's something different
I really like Travis..HES DEFINITELY A GOOD FIT FOR KOURTNEY
My cheap mattress way safer than those tattoos lol
money is good
Nice house, Nice Zen vibe Travis....  All the best!
What kind of floor is that?
I loved hearing how he casually and proudly talks about his children throughout the video, especially when his daughter runs up to join him. It shows he has a such a large heart and appreciation for the sentimental value of his home, over how much it's worth monetarily. Just beautiful. ❤
Seems super cool and chill I like that
I loved this☺️
🖤🖤🖤🖤
Seems like a very chill dude, def has class
Awe…I forget how soft spoken he is!  I love how he has made her generally happy!  No drama.  She deserves a loving relationship, and he is the one!  He seems like a generally down to earth man, and I believed he is so close to his children.  One thing I like about Kourtney’s family is that she brings the children in from another family with open arms!  It is so sweet!  Especially since the children are going through changes that they may not understand.  Such a sweet family!
Never judge a book by its cover ….I did not expect this from Travis…he is co calm. I love the man who loves fireplace and coffee.
10:28 Whoops, maybe the candle in the background is TMI lol
Beautiful,  love the pool and garden...Regards from Ireland 🇮🇪
Just wow.
wow his house has depth and full of art, the car part, the bike part, the music room. So cool
Wow he speaks so quietly…. Seems like a nice guy… Lovely home.
Curious to see the blurred-out artwork at 6:59 - 8:01
I was only interested in the house. Wow, it's beautiful and relaxing. Honestly, I'm blown away by Travis personality...he's so sweet...He's seems to be so fatherly in very good way.
You're gonna shut and fall back in it..what a dork .What are you gonna be if you grow up ?
This is a nice detailed home tour. Love it.
Travis barker has a home?
Congratulations!!! Kourtney and Travis, your such a perfect couple, it's so nice to see Kourtney happy and in love always with a smile on her face now!!! Your perfect for each other, stay in love forever!!!❤️❤️❤️
Gorgeous house. Travis seems so mellow.
surprise he has nice and normal house, i love it
I dont care what know one says they are perfect for each other he is soooooooooo calm and caring perfect for her
i can't take what he says seriously. A dude with tattoos all over his face means a bad trip when your around him.
I love your Buick.
Wes Lang 🔥
He has such a warm & chill personality 💯 👍
This is so much different compared to mtv
I love your home.
This dude looks like a cross between a Junkie & Cartoon character. Kardashians really knows how to pick'em!
i can tell he actually uses his house and every room of it
Very nice home.
But also has such a soothing voice tho
He looks like a Recovering crackhead
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwtQD9ioOc4  This is the same house as his MTV Cribs episode. Wild.
Cool draws
Bless all beloveds at eternity God Father and than never fault You! I LOVE You God Father! 😜🤣😍💘🥲💌✨👑🥳🎊💞🥰😇👼💗😘
First of all, it’s sad that people had a judgement about what his space would look like, it’s pretty naive. Anywhoos they copied Kim & Kanye’s crib but less minimal…check the corridor, the kitchen … a bit sad and social-media-like to do this kinda stuff
Why is Zen always mentioned in these videos lol?
Their relationship is sexual i mean based on that only
Travis just seems like such a kind soul.  The house is absolutely stunning, and I love the minimalistic style!
ive never heard him talk, he seems tough but he's a teddy bear
Who is this guy?  Sorry but, I have no idea…..I’Ll google him then….funny how one can appear to be so famous in social media and yet I have no idea who he is…
Travis you have a beautiful home ,🥰🥰🥰
He is soo much better than Disick
FMGK 😁
Dud I love u personality I could see why cori fell in love with u god bless wish u nothing but the best ,,,
https://youtu.be/qZfuUmDF6K4
He's such a soft spoken guy.  I think he's definitely an interesting person.  I don't like the house though 😄 I think I am allergic to minimalism, I fully believe if you have even one million dollars you are wasting life not having a moat and drop bridge.   I squirmed when he said they got rid of vaulted ceilings.  But I wasn't surprised by that point in watching, how could you be
This is a Beautiful home. I am so happy that Courtney finally has a man a real man that takes care of home .God bless you both
Go vegan!  I wish more people had the same awareness, it would make for a better world for everyone. Such a beautiful home and beautiful man with so many qualities. Loving the simplicity and peacefulness , even thought it's quite a big property it feels cozy and homey!
YOU SERVE satan he WILL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT IF IT MEANS he CAN DRAG YOUR SOUL TO HELL WITH him!  IT'S NOT WORTH IT!  IT WONT BE A PARTY, IT WILL BE AN ETERNITY OF TORMENT.   PEOPLE THAT SOLD OUT TO satan WILL BE BEGGING TO SERVE GOD AFTER 1 SECOND IN HELL!  GOD'S STANDARD FOR HEAVEN IS PERFECTION AND ONLY JESUS (THE SON OF GOD/GOD IN THE FLESH) LIVED THAT PERFECT LIFE!  HE LAID DOWN HIS LIFE & TOOK THE WRATH OF THE FATHER ON THE CROSS FOR YOUR SINS!  GOD IS JUST SO HE MUST PUNISH SIN & HE IS HOLY SO NO SIN CAN ENTER HIS KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.  IF YOU ARE IN CHRIST ON JUDGEMENT DAY GOD WILL SEE YOU AS HIS PERFECT SON (SINLESS SINCE YOUR SINS ARE COVERED BY JESUS' OFFERING).  YOU CAN ALSO CHOOSE TO REJECT JESUS' GIFT/SACRIFICE & PAY FOR YOUR OWN SIN WITH DEATH (HELL) BUT THAT SEEMS PRETTY FOOLISH!  GOD SEES & HEARS EVERYTHING YOU HAVE SAID & DONE.  YOU WONT WIN AN ARGUMENT WITH HIM & YOU CANT DEFEND ANY OF YOUR SINS TO HIM.  YOU'RE NOT A GOOD PERSON, I'M NOT A GOOD PERSON... ONLY GOD IS GOOD!  WE'RE ALL GUILTY WITHOUT ACCEPTING JESUS' SACRIFICE FOR OUR SINS!   MUHAMMAD DIDN'T DIE FOR YOUR SINS, BUDDHA DIDN'T DIE FOR YOUR SINS, NO PASTOR/NO PRIEST/NO SAINT/NO ANCESTOR DIED FOR YOUR SINS, MARY DIDN'T, THE POPE DIDN'T EITHER, NO IDOLS OR FALSE gods DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO MUSICIAN OR CELEBRITY DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO INFLUENCER OR YOUTUBE STAR DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO SCIENTIST OR POLITICIAN DIED FOR YOUR SINS, NO ATHLETE OR ACTOR DIED FOR YOUR SINS! STOP IDOLIZING & WORSHIPING THESE PEOPLE!  JESUS CHRIST ALONE DIED FOR YOUR SINS & WAS RESURRECTED FROM THE GRAVE!  HE IS ALIVE & COMING BACK VERY VERY SOON WITH JUDGEMENT (THESE ARE END TIMES)!  PREPARE YOURSELVES, TURN FROM SIN & RUN TO JESUS!  HE KNOWS YOUR PAIN & TROUBLES, HE WANTS TO HEAL & RESTORE YOU!  TALK TO HIM LIKE A BEST FRIEND!  ASK HIM TO REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU & HELP YOU TO BELIEVE IF YOU DOUBT!  DON'T WAIT TO CRY OUT!  NO ONE IS PROMISED TOMORROW! HE LONGS FOR YOU TO INVITE HIM IN, HE LOVES YOU MORE THAN ANY PERSON EVER COULD, HE CREATED YOU!   Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me."-John 14:6  "But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my  Father which is in heaven."-Matthew 10:33  “For the wages of sin is death (hell), but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord”-Romans 6:23
With the present inflation rate, many investors are left wondering whether they should change their investment strategy. There investments more important than ever amid rising inflation. Of course, investing through volatile markets is not without risk. Still, there are things investors can do to protect and even improve their portfolios through market swings. Investing should always be a process over time, but when you’re in a high inflation environment and the Fed is aggressively tightening monetary policy, it is without a doubt a riskier time to be in equities, but you have to be mindful of the disciplines that are important to help you navigate through what is generally a more volatile period of time. Even within equities, you may want to rotate into areas that generally perform better in higher inflation like the crypto market which i have played  part in and have been able to grow my portfolio to an accumulated sum of 5.6 BTC in weeks with the trading strategy and indications given to me by expert trader Erik Ming irrespective of the current position
He's so amazing. Go Kourt! so happy for them.
All i have to say I, ROBOT.
This is cringe
What's he wearing look bad
They are so much in love, you can just tell.
I think he is so cool  🔥🔥
So what does this tell us? Never to judge 😊behind all the ink is a deep thinker, family oriented, zen, introspective person
Bland, boring, a lot of beige, grey and indecency... 25k bikes, 18k cement pingpong table, seriously? Yeah, that's what people need to see just when the cost of living goes up and up...
https://youtu.be/-vhuv6W2a2g
How he says MY HOUSE my fiancé?
this has to be the best tour on the channel.
the home is beautiful. but, i am more enchanted by the owner and i know very little about him. lovely gentleman, glorious spirit. very happy for the couple.  wish them many happy, glorious years.
Beautiful home, thanks for sharing, 🙏🏾❤️
Travis baker looks like vampire 🧛‍♂️ designers
his home look so beautiful!! really love the pool
This whole episode reminds me of a quote I heard from someone when I used to travel abroad a lot. He said: " some of the nicest and most genuine  people I met around the world were covered with tattoos and piercings while some of the most judgemental were super religious". It had me think, still until this day. Crazy.
Travis is a genuinely likable dude. Nothing like a typical “Kardashian b/f.” Don’t screw him up, Kourt!
‘This smells like Kourtneys orgasm’ that candle is just love!
What a cool elegant house ❤
Why am I starting to like travis more then kourtney , even tho I didn’t know who he was before 😂
This dude is so down to earth !
I love this. I love Travis and his vibe, and I don't care what anyone else thinks.. him and Kourtney are cuteeee
Nah that candle was wild😭! Did y’all peep?
Beautiful home and overall great guy!
Travis, lo que fuiste y lo que yes... Farsante.
I actually really like his place. Nice
He seems like a grounded guy. .   Family is important He + Kourtney seem like they will have a fun, balanced life ❤
So, Travis's home is surely minimalist, but not creepy like kim n Kanye's house. For some reason I feel this guy is pretty grounded, like the seating area arrangements in his living room, it's not extravagant, it's very cozy. People cn easily connect with him. Kourtney is lucky, this guy is a keeper
I hope the kardashians dont destroy him ..
"Like"
he seems like such a cool laid back dude. I hope him kourt have the best life. congratulations!!!
In The Kardashians he said he moved to Calabasas because he thought Kourtney was the love of his life even though they barely knew each other, and if he couldn't date her then at least he wanted to live near her. Here he says he bought this house about 16 years ago. In 2006 he was dating other people, what a weird move to buy a house just to be near a woman you don't even know while you're dating other women. I like them both as persons and I like heir relationship, but some of the things they say and do about their relationship are bizarre.
I love how down to earth he is, I’ve never heard him speak, wasn’t expecting him to be so chill. I really love the minimalist look of the house as well. So dope!
him naming who sits in what seat 🥺 idk why that’s so cute
whenever you call your children "my kids"  it felt like they are just like 8 and 9 years old 😅
Lizard
💕💕💕💕Wish u both great happiness and understanding.. U both forever
stunning home and seems a very nice guy such a pleasant surprise so very very easy to judge a book by the cover
Beautiful, serene home with classy black accents. I love it!
It shows how introspective Travis is and how his home’s decor supports that.
What a fkin wasteman - The Kardashians love nutters don't they (if they're rich). *Doubt she's with u for your matcha tea bro!!!!* , kinda feel sorry for him now wearing his leather utility suit...
Goals 🔥🔥🔥
WTF is he wearing LMAO
🤮 thank god he’s got money cuz that’s a face only a momma could love 😂
This dude is literally the perfect definition of "do not judge a book by its cover". LITERALLY!!! 😭 From his voice to his art taste and mindset..  that's a nice surprise.😍 Def gain a new follower.
Kourtney and Travis must’ve had sex on every single surface. That Sunday dinner table? They had sex on it. That theatre room they “fall asleep” in? They had sex there lol
Travis has indeed good sense of everything
I love how homey and family oriented everything is 🤍
He looks like what voldemort would look like with tattoos
I’m pleasantly surprised at this home and Travis  as a person super chill and engaging. This house is beautiful and functional. I can imagine him “living” here.
8:27 time for take off, please make sure seatbelts are fastened
More cars than kids. 😳
She just happens to be sitting in her pajamas on the counter top with her laptop 🤣 what a joke 🤣
I love him & Kourtney together❤❤
AD show Tom Delonge’s House  New build
This is a beautiful home! 👍🏻🥰😊
What is he wearing 🤣🤣
Had the Kardashians remodeling person do his home…it has  Kardashian written all over it….just smaller scale
I must say, his voice and demeanor do NOT match his appearance!!
Seems like a nice man.
the home is beautiful but i cringed so hard seeing Kourtney just posing there on the counter in her "pjs" and face full of makeup. it was so completely unnatural and weird?? lmao why did they do that? I'm screaming it's so weird😭 and you can tell how uncomfortable she is to be sitting there and working or whatever she is doing like she readjusted herself ten times in the moment she was sitting there cause she obviously never does. why didn't she sit at the pretty table ? the way the Kardashians can never be just natural for a moment like girl be free it's okay to relax you don't have to pose. anyways the house is nice very relaxing I felt like I could fall asleep and breathe there. what a shame he's never there 😔
Blessings upon Kourtney and Travis and their beautiful families always❣️🥂🕊️ (p.s. NEVER leave things in a closet waiting. EVERYDAY is a present!)
So he's gonna skip over the candle? "Smells like Kourtney's Orgasm" haha
His house, her house & still shopping for their house. That will be a fun house to see!:) 💕
Beautiful home good taste he seems like nice guy good luck with your lady blessings
No one cares get off the internet
He’s so cool like he’s so in love with all the little things in life. That’s why him and Kourtney match. She wanted someone to love the little things the quiet moments and truly be present. Living life
Family man....
for a well known famous person he’s so down to earth and chill and seems like an awesome guy. i’m rooting for his and kourts marriage/happiness/blended family 🤍🙏🏻
Love how kourtney so casually sitting Macha in her nightgown on the counter....with a full face of makeup 😂
🥰🥰🥰
I'm sorry for ever judging you Travis you seem so good🥺♥️
I can see why Kourtney fell in love with him. He's so chill and sounds so loving, how he talks about his kids. Also his taste is flawless.
I am a minimalist
I remember when Travis was on kicking up with the Kardashians scene a couple years ago I remember saying one day they will end up together and I am so glad they did! Legit match made in heaven 🖤
It's crazy she nevvvver looked this hot until she got with Travis.
If I took a shot every time he said “like” I’d need my stomach pumped 💀🤣
I usually don't like overlit (natural lighting) homes because I feel it takes away the privacy that make it a 'home'...if you get what I mean...but this home found the most captivating balance to it
All you saying don’t judge a book by it’s cover, are obviously new to the rock look
Eww he looks like a walking skeleton
Very very dope!
The first time a Kardashian didn't have something to wear?  Lol. Put some clothes on and get off the kitchen  counter with your behind. Appalling.
Seriously Something just moved back of the pillows ,is it me or do anyone can see it too , creepy house .. i guesss
He really contradicts everything that you think you might know about him or might have heard about him in the past what a seemingly wonderful and generous and genuine man father friend I’m very happy for him his family and Courtney
Why do we care about these people?
Travis Scott is a great person.
I am blown away.  Travis is so calm and zen. I absolutely LOVE his home. Like.. everything! So tastefully done. Each part of the house is so beautiful. It is also welcoming. Travis' demeanor is respectful. He seems like a very kind guy.  He loves Courtney so much. It's obvious!  I am sincerely happy for them and their children.  I really enjoyed this video 🙏🏻💗
Wish you had turned the lamp you designed on!
This was so pleasant to watch. I'm also glad they didn't have a gross pda. This was about the house and family. 👏👏👏👏
There are the Haves and there are the, Have Mores
why do AD sensor some art and doesnt some
One of the best house tours. He was so humble! No show off about anything rather explaining the significance behind every snap and big item! Also appeared like a family guy. Nice.
We are best friends now:) Nice home. You and Kort cute couple.
This is modern, mature, “mtv cribs.” Especially when he said you gotta go
Kravis may god continue to bless u.
boring
He is right about mattresses though.
Are we gonna talk about what that candle says?!?
What a weird couple
I really enjoyed watching this. Not because of the house!! Which is AWESOME!! He did an amazing presentation!! So well spoken and relaxed!  Really cool!!!
Cannot see past the trash bag jumpsuit. Probably cost a fortune  but looks like an extra in a sci fi fascist future.
I love Travis! He's extremely humble and all about family. He's very well spoken, I don't understand why ppl are so quick to judge bc of his looks
Kourtney's and travis's homes look very similar
understated, with small yet distinct pops of punk personality. dare I say - my fav I've seen on Open Door?
I’m not a kardashian fan but this is just so cute, they look really comfortable together and it’s pleasing to hear the way they talk to each other and consider each other. They both have a calming energy and just very relaxed and comfortable I love it
3:52 - ahhhhh LOVE THEM TOGETHER OMFG 🥺🤍
I like him, as big as his house is it feels homey...and lived in not showy, nice to see
just a humble guy 😌
He seems so chill and down to earth - perfect for kourt 🥺
I love how he keeps including kourtney thats amazing
it is nice and cosy and unpretentious. i like how he chose the designer by his vibe. only thing i'd change is i'd want a bigger pool....but i really like how liveable it is.
Beautiful home. And I'm so happy for Kourtney and Travis. The way they look at each other is everything.
i love his voice🥹
The things I would do for all those bands tees lol.
I could be wrong, but I think he's vegan.
The matcha station is so adorable! ♡
Did not expect such a zen house for a rock star. Thought everything would be abstract, artistic, maximalist etc but this was so enlightening :D
He seems so calm with a Monk like zen for someone who absolutely murders the drums for a living
What a calm and beautiful vibe he has! ❤️🙌
I'm sure Travis ex is mad for some reason lol idk what reason but I'm sure ha
I quarantined during the pandemic to be safe. I would just invite all kinds of strange bodies that don't legally live in my home to play games and have fun 😶 Just why?! ::slapsforehead::
He seems so caring, loving, and genuine. And his love language is touch. I can understand why Kourtney loves him. Beautiful home. One of my favorites.
This is totally my style.Travis and I have the same birthday, November 14th-Scorpio Style.
I love that he's lived there more than 16 years. He seems to be a really lovely, thoughtful man.
Travis Barker is the devil in person.
with ALL those t shirts i recomend a long rail with similar to a marble drop down a rail so each individual shirt has individual time to be seen.  i recomend a lazy suzan on huge table convayor with pullys that has two on springs at the ends with more push then the ones on the side so with two hands the pulls on side pull out pulling in two end pulls and people can activate the conveyor belt.
his kids study everywhere... nice
Wow...I do not know anyone who would not want to live there.
Ok.. gonna need that matcha recipe please 🍵
Aren't they purchasing a home together?
What a nice, relaxed, well guy. Can see why he's popular.
You can't be "punkrock" if you "turn on" a fireplace. I'm pretty sure that's a written condition.
They are perfect for each other, i love them and wish them the happiest marriage 🖤
Way too rich.  Musicians and pro athletes should be paid $70,000-$100,000 per year.  Rather than houses like this, everyone should be assigned a standard house.  Things are way backwards.  Some guy that can drum is living better than teachers with doctorate degrees?  The hell?
What a cool guy. He doesn’t come across like a spoiled rich person or a scary tattooed guy. I like him.
Fabulous home
*"... on MTV Cribs."*
I love this house, it's elegant, yet comfortable and peaceful. When Travis described writing drum parts by tapping his thighs and chest, I became emotional because my husband of 37 years was a professional drummer and used to do the very same thing. I lost him last July and I miss hearing him tapping his body or the furniture and I miss him. This is the first time I've ever seen Travis in an interview and I like him, he seems very nice and genuine. You can tell that he enjoys his life. I wish him and his family many more years together in this beautiful home.
"I'm Travis Barker and welcome to my crib" 😄
Qué difícil debe ser encontrar una camiseta negra específica en su armario jajaaja, todas se ven similares xd
Such a beautiful home
He focuses on some off beat features of his house. Like that his bed raises the head and feet. Random thing to show but it's funny.
Quiero estudiar arquitectura para hacer proyectos así omg
Kourtney looks more like her mommy the older she gets
Lovely home.. But No.. I just can't.. He's talking Kim and Kourtney now... 🙈🙈🙈
How does this dude a millionaire walk to the door wearing a full size black condom and AD not turn around and walk off. lol what is wrong with these celebrities, all the money in the world and they dress like complete lunatics.
I love his voice. Good for you Kourtney
He proposed on the first date. A romantic at heart. The way he laughed when his daughter came out, he loves his kids for sure…beautiful home.
What in the world is he wearing? He's definitely turning into a Kardashian
The candle 🙃
Love a man who takes his matcha so seriously, swoon~
He’s so cool
I aspire to one day have TB vibes.
Beautiful Home
Thanks for having Kourtney be barefoot for this video. That was very clearly your decision. Really appreciate it, Travis.
He's a family man. ❤👌
Ewwwwww He's NASTY LOOKING
Loved it. Beautiful home and Travis is pretty cool, too. 🤘🏾
Este par de fastidiosos  se la pasan con la lengua afuera chupetiandose guacalas acaso no les da pena de sus hijos
Oh my god this home is the closest to my vibe so far! I love the black, moody accents. My favorite!
Travis sense of calm is just wow, the zen is working, *runs to patio to go mediate*
Top 5: Bad Things to be with a RUSSIAN WOMAN... https://youtu.be/YSZ0VvFbu24
*When he said “I like this life better”, I felt that. It’s like he’s in his settling down stage of life, so that’s cool. At the same time he can reminisce about all his accomplishments and wild times but also move forward.*
I enjoyed his house tour.
Really cool guy. Came from humble beginnings and stared death in the face.
Travis and Kourtney is doing a thing
I just hope he doesn't change it to a Kardashian trashcan. He is so chill, stay true to yourself Travis!
I love how soft spoken and nice Travis is ! Literally I wish him and kourt did their own vlogs . I love them 🥰
Looks like ikea/winners vibe
Beautiful understated, unfussy home.  It looks like it was designed for a guy.. not in a bad way.    I'll take just one of those closets.  I won't be clicking on the link to buy anything!😊
he is soft spoken and never thought he would be
i've never thought a rock star's house would have this kinda look. Nice design
That bloke looks stupid.
travis has the most relaxing calming voice i've ever heard
They are made for each other. He seems like such a pleasant, calming and genuine person. ☺️
If my husband's not rubbing on me the way Travis is rubbing on Kourtney, then I don't want him hahahaha 😂😂😂
matcha king... wheres your matcha whisk..... lmao
Why is the drum kit crammed in the corner? It’s like he’s afraid of disturbing his mum when he plays?
Goals!
Enjoy it while you have it. He will probably be broke soon, that kartrashain curse....
he got the billie guitar that's fire
Don’t get me wrong, it’s a lovely home, but I find it really goofy to have huge bookshelves with 15 books in sideways stacks of 3.
dope house but wtf is he wearing
"We like to sit down on Sundays just talk and put our phones away and eat delicious VEGAN FOOD" 😂😂 2:31
What is he doing with a Kardashian 🤢🤮? He could do much better !!!! Run away bro .....!
What a nice man so family minded, The house was like zen to me, so calm and peaceful.
chill, vegan and sexy AF!
Love them together
Interviewing designers ? This above my pay grade lol
Never seen punk..what the hell is he wearing??..strange.
He is a gem...I get it now..
Searching the comments for someone talking about the writing on the candle 🫣🤣 10:30
Remember when Kim did that Open Door episode, and we all looked at a whipped Kanye like he just had a vasectomy and one testicle removed... getting the same vibes right here
Beautiful man, just excellent taste. Class. I'm an old grama tho and I worry. Those wonderful fireplaces, love them but honey they have the most beautiful screens for them. Then you get the fire but less worry for the gramas 💖take care, stay safe. 🤗
It's funny how many times he mentioned Kourtney and her kids like they've been married for 20 years
Absolutely amazing home
He seems like a very down to earth guy and you can see family is important to him. Great video and great home..
Travis is the coolest dude ever.
Thanks for sharing your home with us Travis .... Heeeeeeey Kourtney! Wishing you ALL a LIFETIME of Happiness
Finally someone with class and someone that actually can afford a mansion but decides to not live over the top with useless rooms bathrooms and waisted space.What a beautiful home.
I love Travis's home. It's so serene, clean, slick & minimal yet elegant looking. Travis is so humble & a really down to earth guy. Good for Kourtney that she met her soulmate & happy at last💞
Give them a few months before they start fighting and then getting a divorce. It's pretty much a cliché now with these types of people at this point
Kris Jenner said he moved near Courtney house  to live next to her because he had been love with her forever ,and here he saying living  in the same house for 16 years SMH. So which one is true !?
Poor guy😢 they kartrashians are going to ruin him
this is the most I've seen Travis talked.🙂
he is the most humble and chill man in Hollywood
What a beautiful and peaceful home. Not what I expected. I am pleasantly surprised! Congratulations you two.
every time he says "like" you drink
Dr Evil lost some weight
The more you hear Travis talks the more you like him, he’s such a humble and kind hearted gentleman. I completely didn’t like him before because I only judge him by his appearance, the tattoos and things. I didn’t actually know who he is. But now I understand. Congrats to Kourtney and Travis. I wish you both a happy and sweet marriage!
Wow- nostalgia 💭… reminds me of MTV CRIBS SHOW.  Nice celeb home doc👏🏽 📺 😎
Love the vibe of his gorgeous home!
Soft spoken person.
He very simple just like her great match no over the top unnecessary stuff everywhere.
Wow..His house has a lovely vibe...its realistic and not a museum. Everything in it is really very well chosen or planned with comfort as its main focus. Its a beautiful family Home. Not a house.
Omg he is so in love. 🥰 Love his home.
She will be divorced after she’s married. Seems to be a family trend 😅
Who!!! Never herd of him 🤔
"Just talk and eat delicious .... vegan food" pls
Thank You for showing Your Home! Excelent!!!Love to See Kourtney and You and both families ...All the  Blessings for You All!!
This man reminds me of my boyfriend, he always touches my leg and grabs my foot the way Travis did with Kourtney. I love them so much, they have so so much love for eachother, it's beautiful ✨🖤
Ahh the ‘body bag’ ‘I’m taking mySELF to the morgue thank you!’ look is so hot right now. This is from the Derelicte cruise collection.
Looks boring and ordinary
That awkward moment when LeBron doesn't come to pick up his gold bike...
Well u changed my mind about u travis. U seems like a good person
Who tf is this creature now 🤔
"This Smells Like Kourtney's Orgasm"... the Heretic candle lmao I CANNOT! 😂😂😂
Guy creeps me out
This home feels so nice and relaxing, obviously I’m sure it’s incredibly expensive and is huge but it still doesn’t feel very “showy” if that makes sense
That chick ruined the whole segment
This house has Kardashians written all over it 😂
I like that they sit next to each other at the head of the table.
I've always liked him.   Love his energy.   The house is so beautiful.   It's elegant, classy and lived in.   so happy for him and Kourtney.
I used to be an adventurer like you. Then I took an arrow up the bum 🙈 https://youtu.be/A1pjNui6Y0w

I love how Travi's house has so many family memories and history! says so much about his personality. Love the vibe
"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have everlasting life." -John 3:16(bible) "the wages of sin is death"-Bible. Therefore God the judge has given man the death sentence due to man's sin, but because of God's mercy, he gave himself(god incarnate/jesus)to die on a cross for the sins of the world. That means he paid our fine and if we trust in him God can legally let us go guilt free in court/judgment day and have everlasting life with Him!  "Go and sin no more!"-Jesus <3
"It also vibrates" 😐
Generic, bland, no character.
he is so cute I'm literally crying on my floor
Awesome house. But the matcha station is killer!!! In a very awesome way!
SO THIS IS THE PERSONALITY KOURTNEY FELL FOR OFCOURSE I WOULD TOO GORL
Gorgeous. So comfortable looking. So bright. He’s cool. Kourtney hit the jackpot 🥰
Is AD the grown up version of mtv cribs?
Why is kourtney so cringe, she so nervous
So sick of minimalist homes, there have to be more like Dita von Teese’s house that are fun and maximal
It reminds me meet the barkers 😂
I love how every celeb is like i just wanted to make my house a calm, chill, tranquil place to relax. Like yeah man that’s what everyone does lol
i'm a car guy, i love cars....drives off with a bike
He seems so chill and grounded, despite his involvement with the k family.
Travis, you a nice guy and Oh! so is the house ❤️
He has a sweet soul. I like it.
I love his soft seaking..its heart capturing
Love the PINS.... wonder why the Banksy was blurred out
I love how gentle and calming his voice is. He's very relaxed, indeed don't judge a book by its cover. Now I know why Kourtney falls for him. He's charming.
I’m normally not a Kardashian fan but Kourtney truly seems Happy with this man.
He is soft spoken... Speaks nicely and loving way.. That's why he looks attractive
👊💯❤️👍🇺🇸
His voice cured my anxiety for 15 min thanks
Crazy how these celebrities be way different than the images they put out 💯 😜 🙃😶🫤😑😎 So people stop 🛑 trying to be the characters and be the person 💪🏾
Really nice crib sir love it...😎🤙🏽 love your Energy so kool and calm 💯....Solid👍🏽👊🏽
Home is home he’s been in that house for almost 2 decades
I wonder if he has flashbacks when people use their lighters around him. I’ll bet his fridge is filled with penis sandwiches.
I didn't really have to much of an opinion about him but since seeing this I have mad respect for him, he's definitely a family man and very clean Kourtney did well with this guy. That plane crash may have changed his life for the better God bless him and his family.
I don’t know 1 chic who would go out with that loser so it just makes sense that he would chase after  trash. Not one of girls could get anyone decent so what’s the fuss about them? All they do is lie and dress like tramps.
Beautiful home 🥰✨🤍
Thought he said "hey what's up baby" 😂
what kind of flooring is in the main rooms?
I smiled this entire video. Travis’ love for kourtney is undeniable. I’m so happy for them both and their beautiful blended family.
I love the way he speaks about the designer, gives him the credit of his house
This is one of the best houses I have seen after, Dakota Johnson. I’d so live here and grow old with my family.
Fultility is the award of the superficial
We ❤️ the decoration here!
Kourtney looks a lot like kris
Stunning house!
It's beautiful calm and serene
Evidently this is the new 'trend' in decorating...or undecorating as the case may be. I do like the clean uncluttered look and minimal color, but all these places look alike from the kitchen cabinet handles to the ubiquitous stucco looking urns and plain pottery all over. There's no architectural interest or one piece of furniture with any artistic flair. I will admit his chair does look comfy...the couches are a big nothing. You can have color without it being overdone.
I just love how much he spoke about his kids and all the memories he has with them in that house
WTF is he wearing? Rubber? Leather? PVC? Latex?
I'm in a very difficult situation, I need 1 dollar, I would be very grateful if you could help me, you can transfer to my wallet via usdt trc20 network, thanks 🙏 TJJmNMss2ca2oVw3XfiaXCHnGV1Cjd4svs
Amazing home 🏡
Did he say "just under 10,000 sq ft" 🤭
Booooooooring
Wow MTV CRIBS is grown up now
Mind blown that a massive house like that is single storey 🤯
Why is his voice so ASMR.. I had no idea 🤣
Nice house, I murder the car in Black lol.
I saw something similar to this but it had his first wife in it. This is the flowers I bought for Shanna and the Christmas car that Shanna bought me last Halloween.
this house is simple but exquisite! And I looooooooooooove it!
He seems very down to earth :)
He speaks so calmly!
His house is amazinnnnngggg!!
why is he wearing a trashbag?
I get it now, Courtney
😂😂😂 she still has the candle IN HER CLOSET!
He seems so chill. I love his house, that's my vibe too <3 so refreshing to see his home so peaceful
Travis is a whole vibe. I mean I wasn't expecting it to be gaudy at all. He has amazing taste. Looks like bay windows that let in all the light. So clean and cool looking.
Kortney loves interior design ,this is her style to ...they have SO MUCH in common mentally ,amd emotionally,  she deserves it xxx
Love this house, beautiful taste, real zen and inspiration. Have to add, Kourtney and Travis are so good match for each other!
Not even a good looking place
its Dior 🚲 “Kendall, Kourtney sister actually gave me this one”
Hay it the GUY from the movie GRANDMA'S BOY!
His house is beautiful. I absolutely love that it's not overdone, It's simple but in the best way possible. It's always refreshing to hear that he's lived here for 16 yrs whereas most celebs have moved more times than we can count. It's nice he put roots down here and his kids were able to really grow in this home & have that stability. You can tell he has a huge heart & so much love for his children & family. ❤  Also a lot of people judge a book by its cover but Travis is the true essence of why NOT to do that.  Travis your amazing & you deserve all the happiness in the world & I'm so glad you seem to have that
Can anyone help me name all of the albums in the painting Kourt had made for him? I see Pink Floyd The Wall and Dr dre but i cant make out the rest! Thanks.
What a wonderful and sweet man. You should never judge someone with how they look and assume anything. His home is beautiful and with being there for 16 years, he has accumulated so many beautiful memories as well. Just lovely. 😍.
This house is stunning! I'll be taking inspiration for my future homes lol plus he's such a nice guy xx
I don’t like it
I love how self aware he is, its so cool that he owns a organic, natural bed and knows how toxic things are.
So he move to calabasas 16 Years ago to be with kourtney😏
so cool he used that td 50 to record some music. i think he is right about how easy it is to use for production. and it looks to clean! dream kit
I expected a lot of chaos and this is definitely nothing like that. Very nice segment.
Bro’s wearing a garbage bag. Great video tho
His home is so cozy love the art feels
I think he’s romantic and very sentimental person
Did anyone else notice the dog pee by the Escalade 💀😭
I wish them all the best. Seems like a great guy
Hello, Love to you all. Believe the gospel that our Lord and savior Jesus Christ was God, who came to us as a human being over 2000 years ago, that he lived the perfect life we can’t, died on the cross and shed his blood for all of our sins, and was resurrected 3 days later, by the power of God. Simply believe this and be saved from judgement!   By grace through faith in our Lord you are saved, and there is nothing you can do to earn his favor. God wants to give you the free gift of eternal life to all those who'd believe in his sons sacrifice for salvation! He will then give you his Holy Spirit to help walk and guide you in all his ways. Please read the new testament to get more info about Jesus Christ.   The Lord Jesus Christ bless you all.
what are the five albums in his painting? i see operation ivy, dr dre, pink floyd what are the other 2??
very cool but AD< must stop this kardashian cringe moments like her casually sitting on the kitchen island wit hthe laptop... come on....CRINGE
This video changed the way i look at him 😱 i thought he would have a creepy or skully house 😅
Kourtney you are lucky and I'm happy for you to have a husband like   Travis
A classical example of 'Do not judge a book by it's cover.'
A matcha station 😃🙌🏻
Very nice
I’m a hick from Indiana who hates ultra modern non traditional decor, which is what I thought I’d see here.  I was so wrong.  Travis’s house is gorgeous.  Tasteful and warm and full of sentimental items.  Just lovely.  ETA:  ok, just heard Travis’s tarantula story…burn it all down.  😂
I never really heard Travis speak, but i'm pleasantly surprised at how chill and positive he seems.
He looks like a concentration camp survivor. lol
I'm Keeping up with the Barkers!  wooof
I just want to say that I love Travis' outfit!!
Is he wearing a leather jumpsuit? He really is a Kardashian now
Hey does anyone know if Travis is a vegan?? 😂
Really chilled out dude
In 2012, I almost died from a drug overdose but Jesus Christ saved my life.  During this near death experience, I cried out to the Lord Jesus in prayer and repented to Him for my sins and He saved my life.  Please repent to the Lord Jesus for your sins and then get fully submerged under water as a baptism to God in the name of Jesus and obey what He wants you to do with your life or if you don't do this then when you die you will go to hell.
Loved This like literally, Elegant Home indeed. Also I'm so happy the way they have accepted each other's kids wholeheartedly as a big happy family 🙌
Dude got on more leather then blade
It actually looks like a home that's been lived in. realistic and humbled
https://youtu.be/cajA22xnKOE Seek Jesus Christ, everything you gain here is temporary
Blink 182 still touring???
This feels like home with a character. Not a house with empty soul
Kourtney using laptop on top of a table like that is the most uncomfortable scripted scene ive seen
I love him for Courtney, she is truly blessed
Ps you got the stupid Kardashian that will get breast cancer in a few years because of her obsession. Hope titless is your groove.
3:25 thats a nice way to say your gift sucks
Believe Jesus is the Son of God. Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord. Read the Bible.
Loved this tour, the house was gorgeous, interesting with a homely feel
Being with kourt WY is bring him more to the limelight
Wearing shoes indoors 🤢
EXCELLENT 💯 💯 💯
where are the coffe chairs/seats from 6:32 please?
Thanks for the tour - very nice home 💚
Now I understand why Kourtney fell in love with him...he is an amazing human being
when im rich i want a fart suit just like him
Don’t crowd my vibe.
Idk if it’s saying much but it appears that Courtney is the one that actually has a 🤍
He's looking like a real cool old head
Travis and Kourtney are so cringe together. It's going to be the most epic breakup in celebrity history and I'm here for it! Also, it's 6:05pm, why is she sitting in full pj's and a full face of makeup acting like she just rolled out of bed to a matcha🥴. Her poor kids probably see her on tv and wonder who that person is.

I can't believe trash celebs have nice houses designed by other people.
Dope AF
Very similar vibe to Kourt's house!

3:57 me casually sitting uncomfortably on the kitchen counter, oh "hey AD, didnt noticed you there"
Great, thanks for showing me this, I know now the layout of your house, where to break in and what to take.
he looks like he smokes pressie pills
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
OMG look at that Grand National!
I love that they were crushing on each other for yrs. It feels like they were so meant be and knew when the time was right to be with one another.
ughh.  the Kardashians are the worst...
He seems like a really good /gentle soul and just wants a space that allows him to find peace; minimal in details, non-toxic with traceable origins of materials, a fire that he can sit beside. . A space where he feels safe with objects of sentimental value; and one where he can welcome those he loves and cares for.  A space where he can express his creativity through music whenever the moment takes him there.
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
Looks like a gay couples house.
😎❤️ very nice video❤️😎
You use to be cool.
The house is amazing ... after listening to Travis talk about everything in the house, it truly is a home and not just a house. it has all the memories and warmth. Travis is definitely the definition of not judging a book by its cover ... he is so warm and gentle. Congratulations Kourtney and Travis ... may you be blessed with many years of love and happiness!
❤❤❤❤❤ the house and everything ❤❤❤❤❤
Summary of the video to my knowledge  :  don’t judge a book by its cover
Beautiful home!! I love how you can sit in your living room and have it open to the outside, I love that. All the fireplaces. Nice collection of cars. I wish the best for you & Kourtney. She totally deserves someone who she can grow with & since the two of you have been friends for so long, that's the way to do it. I wish nothing but the both of you two lovebirds & your families.
When a man pays attention where every one else does not, such as knowing where each person sits on the dining table….that man is a rare kind with a heart full of love…God bless him.
https://youtu.be/GVsI-lIyB1Q
Very sad to see a soul so lost trying to fill the void with material things
Nice guy!
easy recipues here
Great video. Soothing voice.
todays quote, dont judge people by its cover,
I love his house! Travis sounds and looks to be so calm and serene! I love him for Kourt !
Our homes are our identity, with creativity, and most our sanctuary, This is Awesome. ✨🌟✨
So lovely and gorgeous couple 😍
The candle “this smells like Kourtney’s orgasm” 😭😂
Travis is so sweet and humble. His interior taste is impeccable, very classy.
He is monied🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 The house and those art pieces AMAZING 👌
https://youtu.be/ufiJiyA5A9A
I'm gonna be honest, this is the first house I've seen from a famous/rich person that actually looks and feels like a home.... really love this house
Kourtney trying to be sexy lol. She looks so happy and content.
Thought they married?
He's so normal and humble. Didn't expect. Love!
His drumming is so energetic so, it makes perfect sense to have a home that's so chilled. Love it!
This house is Beautiful!!!
His voice is soooo different to what i expected him to sound 💀 love the home though
I definitely judge a book by its cover and watching this wasn’t what i expecting. I was expecting more like museum / minimalist decoration but his house really have the homey feelings. The way he talks about his kids and the memory in the house show me a glimpse what he is, a good family man.
I came here with a pre-negative-judgment of what I'll find, maybe because of the Kardashian factor, but I left as a fan!
Gorgeous home
I use to respect TB until her wore that dress and now pushes males to wear skirts. All aprt of the masonic agenda to feminize young men. knowing how much influence he has...sick. RIP TB
Just went and watched his MTV cribs video to see the changes. He’s always had a beautiful home. Stunning design, absolutely love it.   Also was lovely to hear him talking about the memories, along with how organically his and Kourtney’s relationship grew 🏡🖤
he has the most perfect ASMR voice, this is so relaxing omg :)
Kardashians went from Cash Broke black men, to sickly looking white men.
1:59 That was his way of telling you politely to frig off and let him work without you watching everything.
honestly i thought Travis was wild but damn this guy has the same energy as Kourt ❤
He reminds me of a very wealthy son of Pinhead from Hellraiser.
I don’t know much about this guy but his taste and his house is impeccable. And he lived in the house for 16 years just shows he’s all in and in it for the long term.
This shows that if u work really hard on an instrument and that’s it…..definitely not on respecting your own body and destroying what god gave you…….then you can make your dreams come true!!   She looks like a typical Central American mediocre girl walking around with a bag of fish…………at first I thought I  that was the housekeeper and I’m like why she  talking?…….stop blasting your face…… if you were against the establishment I get it or gangbanging then respect….or if u drum for morbid angel.   …….but u play for a kid band …..not a punk band …….your like those other posers Green Day!……..watch Blackflag…sex pistols…..misfits…..velvet underground…..New York dolls….. I sound like Henry Rollins…..
IMPRESSIVE!!!
I can see why Kourtney is infatuated with Travis. He seems to have a gentle soul and he gives off  a humble vibe.
"don't judge a book by its cover" I really expected a whole dark vibe but just the way he speaks and his calm vibes is def something I never expected he also seems like a focused gent...def more mature than Scott
Why do vegans have to tell everyone they are vegan everytime they speak?  Is it some sort of flex? He looks like a malnourished POW, not really selling rabbit food tbh.
This looks like the rich dudes house in Breaking Bad (when skylar is pregnant & wears the blue dress)
I Am YouTuber Mera Tech Channel hai
That dude is such a tweeker like that MGK poser………….
I Am YouTuber Mera Tech Channel hai

The best AD feature ever!
As much as Courtney works lol😂
Such a nice home,I love the vases and candle sticks.Can I just ask What the heyck is Matcha lol im from Scotland never seen it before That aside loved this tour.The entrance hall with 3 arches is a vibe.
“Once in a while I’ll just take all the pillows off and lay down” he said that as if it was ground breaking hahaha oh to be that rich
This surprised me. Great style and one of the best tours I've seen here.
Actually pretty nice.
Beautiful home! I just have one thing to ask, what's this thing with undersized TVs for huge spaces in celebrities' homes? I noticed that in many videos, the TV size is not proportionate to the distance from the couch and overall space, it's usually quite small.
Travis' home is so comforting and welcoming. It is a beautiful home. He is the epitomy of not judging a book by its cover.   He's so sweet, chill, and laid back and just seem like a genuinely good guy!!
I'm disgusted by how he lets his teenage daughter dresses but that aside, he seems like a very humble man.
He's so likeable
Kourtneys lost it
10:34 The name of that candle though🤣🤣. His house is calm and edgy at the same time without either of the themes over powering one another. He really made his house a home. I also love how sentimental Travis is.
I post the best ads and trailers
Such a sweetheart🥰
I respect him of eating vegan food lol
Top notch. That's how decorate
I love this house. The designer is all that. He did an amazing job. This house looks perfect for Travis and his family! Congratulations Travis!!!
He is so calm WOW.🙂
I love this house sooo damn much!!! So zen and just clean! Aesthetic!!! I love Travis too!😊
that's punk rock !!! ahahahah
the kardashians will find a way to insert themselves everywhere! its amazing..
Wtf are you wearing
Cool house!!! 😍🖤😈🤘👊🍄🇺🇸🍻🍺🥂🍷🥃🚬
LOL at the expensive art books. I will bet cash money he has never cracked a single one open. House is nothing special. It looks generic, no personality at all. When celebrities open their homes to public view 9 times out of 10 they are going to sell.
Tbh when looking at him I didn’t expect his home to feel so mature and elegant. This is why we don’t judge a book by its cover. The way he speaks is also mature as well
His voice is so calming 🥰 Including Jaden Hossler’s  💕💕🥹
OMG! I think I love Travis & Kourtney's relationship more than the house, it's a beautiful house never the less. Ladies did you see how he kissed her and crested her down to her feet, that is a man that will make any house into a home with and for his lady. Being a fellow Aries, Kourtney I wish nothing but the best for you and Travis and your children. Peace, Love & Happiness forever and ever.
WOW! Very nice ! ❤️❤️❤️
Best house ever! Even better than Kourtney's. Both houses have a similar style. And love Travis' vibe too.
Love his house. He and Kourney are a cool couple.
The Buick is the best!❤️ I want the grand national! My dream car 🙏🔥👍
His house is actually pretty nice and looks chill I'm surprised. But I gotta say all these Calabasses homes look the same from outside before you go in.  When they show Kardashian's houses on their show they all look the same to me and I never know which house is which until it says cus they all look almost identical.
Pretentious!
How softly he speaks about the pple and the things he loves……I’m melting!.!.! ❤️🌓❤️
I want his house so badly 😭
Loved the picture Kourtney gave him of his favorite albums…SO THOUGHTFUL!!
Is he wearing a body bag?
He's so iconic. Completely love his home and his energy talking about it.
Beautiful home!
Y el Cadillac de la boda, yo quería verle de nuevo😍
This house is beautiful
He has devin bookers car
He’s so well spoken and composed. Kourtney hsd landed exactly what she deserves z so happy for the both of them 🤍
Japanese minimalism style!!
One of my childhood heroes -- I'm happy for him.
MTV Cribs Flashback
love you Trav!
I have my mom's rosary right here next to Kourtney's orgasm candle. Lol'd so hard.
I never expected this… Great house. Very simplistic, minimalist and exquisitely decorated. I do like that he has been there 16 years.
What a cool guy !
Love the house and I know it's bigger than what we all have and nicer and more expensive stuff, but there is also something just normal about him, no celebrity, just a dad who wants a home for his family, not a house.
Absolutely STUNNING GORGEOUS home
WHATS WITH THAT HIDEOUS BLACK PLASTIC PRISON JUMPSUIT, LAUGHED SO HARD - ARE YOU TRYING TO SET A NEW FASHION TREND, PLEASE SHOW US MORE FASHION TRENDS, THIS IS THE BEST.
I've got a whole lot more respect for TB after watching this, very classy!
Awesome Travis and Koutney❤️❤️
Isn’t it ironic how celebrities in mansions always talk about how they love “minimalism”
I didn't know that he is completely a wholesome family man!!!! God, perfect for Kourtney and she is also perfect for him
"I also dont like too many people in my home" I can relate
Damm you are great dude,  be with Kourtney forever. She's the only real  one
Gorgeous house but vegan deterioration is not so good to see  eat some nutrient dense food please!!!
What a trashy couple. They belong in a trailer park.
Cant even describe how jealous I am of his vintage tee collection …Bauhaus 😭
" i've never seen a tarantula move like that" AHAHA
Oh wow he’s so chill I love him
He is opposite of his appearance.. and what a beautiful house. I want house like Travis’s.
*Proverbs chapter 8 verse 36*  "But he that sinneth against Me wrongeth his own soul:  all they that hate Me love death." – God  Repent of your sin and love of money before you die and are cast into hell.
Kourtney leveled UP!! I enjoyed this so much he's too cool man
I love how he talks about Kourtney every chance he gets! ❤️
This guy's, like, dying of the final stages of full-blown A1DS. Is that his H-1B hospice worker? ...Holiest of f*cks, help them both!
Once upon a time: “Who let you choose black covers for your furniture, that’s disgusting”  P.s. His house is v zen though.
scott is punching himself in the stomach
I was expecting skulls and punk rock everywhere 🤣 but this house is very elegant, classy and sophisticated! Beautiful home 👏🏽
Travis was amazing as Trevor in The Machinist.
No one knows if Kourt and Travis will make it till the end since The Kardashians have their own reputation about marriage and overall relationship. But I'm really rooting for this one. Kravis seems to be a better person together, no forcing anything, just like they really meant to be. I hope they last forever.
is he wearing a shower curtain? wtf
Is nobody gonna mention the candle that smells like Kourtney's orgasm????
I never heard of this guy until a couple of months ago when she married him. I still don’t know who he is actually.
Love this guy but geeze some get the man a stake.
this house tells a lot about him and his personality....now we know why kourtney likes him
I love his vibe so much like he’s just like a fluffy bear that just wants to do things that makes him happy. Love his house too. I wonder if he’s still friends with Tom and Mark, Blink182 was my childhood 😍
woah he is so calm i love it
I'm obsessed with Cadillacs to !!
I loved how he framed penelope's art.. I mean he respects those kids too.. Love his vibe and character
His voice is soo good wtf
I saw STITCH on the closet
My mind is only in his musical instruments, the facts he says he plays everything there.... he's so talented... And his kids recording there, I didn't know they were also talented, but apparently it's expected as their father is too
I like even before watching because i feel like Travis is such a good person with how he treats Kourtney and he's from Blink182.LOL
Never knew Travis has such a calm and gentle voice. Nice home btw
He look he just got out the county jail 😂
I love your house. Love the  contemporary design.  Love  everything about the house.
He seems so cool! 💙✌
I can see why Kourtney fell in love with Travis.
Pretty tame personality despite his looks. Total minimalist deco, which is cool, too much stuff tends to look cluttered.  He is very proud of his home and family. Why he ended up with K-trash is a puzzlement, as she tried flashing beavers for the camera.
Travis seems like a cool person to chill with. Easy going + good energy.
you can just tell he loves her so much by the little things he has in his house i stan <3
Cool dude!
'This smells like kourtneys orgasm' 😂
When he said “with how much Kourtney works” lmao
The cringy couple moment could not have been missed from this video... lol, I was expecting it. This house is gorgeous, but the more you see the more boring the lack of art gets. Too minimalist.
Thats too much of the same color. Grey/black everywhere...seems cold. Even the kitchens seem cold n lifeless. The best feature was the windows n open light. Living room design, Furniture, storage.
ok i really like Travis
Beautiful home!  Looks so relaxing!
Teach Kim how to be minimal
Do all rich people live that way, so disconnected with the world around?
This dude is cool!
I’m sorry but Travis is Kourtney’s PERFECT MATCH!
Brilliantly awesome. May positive energies bless you'll forever
When you say it literally doesn’t change do you mean it practically doesn’t change? Literally doesn’t make much sense there. This mistake is common amongst 15 yo and under,!where are you coming from?
Wow, this is a very nice space. As far as Rock Star houses go, this is very modest and has pleasant touches of class and a warmth that seems vacant from many other celebrities homes.
the more I see and learn about Travis, the more I like him! He seems like such a nice person to be around and like a real family man
He’s literally a more humble and chill version of Kourtney and although he’s rich he and can buy anything he wants, he’s knows what contentment is.
His look: ⛓☠️ His house: 🌳 📚 🌺
i would be curious about the weeknd's house too
Home elegant, jumpsuit mmmm not sure, but he do his thang
The closet and the cars is so me 😭
This house gives indeed a positive and peaceful vibe! Even with all the "cold" colors integrated stills feels homey! Love it!!!!!
The fact that people are quick to judge him based on his looks is crazy. He’s really intelligent and has a keen eye on home decorating.
The fact that he has lived in this home for 16 years is INCREDIBLE Celebs switch houses like once a year!
I love how cozy and homely his house is, it is not flashy, just minimalism and the emphasis on large openings. Feels like a perfect place to live. Some celebrities' houses are normally so big and empty, they just feel like museums instead of houses to live in. I also love how soft spoken and chill he is.
His mom’s rosary next to the candle that smells like kourtneys rosary omg 😂
Well rounded, spoken man. Very attractive, I see you Kourtney.
I honestly couldn’t believe when I watched this video, I was totally in awe. I expected something totally different, and so his house is definitely beautiful and classy… he was totally dressed accordingly. That’s a message that he likes classy humans as well.
He's like Kourtney's male punk version, like even with how he speaks and just his vibe.
66,436 are homeless in Los Angeles...it's a shame people like this don't pay more taxes.   The gluttony and ego are gross.
i thought that was eminem
beautiful home....i pray the best for you two lovely couple...God Bless and many blessings...nice i am a fireplace person too....omg...did you kill that spider...i so hate spiders....eeekkkk...spider chills...oh and very very nice taste in cars...mine is also black on black only way to be if you ask me....wooohooo....wait what NO helmet
Que bonita casa y el es muy seguro de si mismo y orgulloso de su casa, su familia.
is this real or a parody?
Love love his home! 😍
What a way to start my morning. Let me go get ready for work and get this money😭😭 I wanna have a house like this too one day
Beautiful house !
Love the vibe
tacky
Omg very lost spirit
https://youtu.be/5H9p3Uz7Kzkت
Travis you look like a crackhead for real glory to Ukraine
He is lovely and nice I didn't know that and the home is so relaxing
The outfit he is wearing reminds me of DEXTER 😆
That outfit drives me PUSSYhols.ONLINE nuts on you and you have that curvy body, you did a good job modelingi it too.   Also like the last outfit  20:22  Love how the garter belts connect to the stockings and shear top.
This man has such a  beautiful spirit.He calms me.I'm happy for kourt
I love him and kourtney. The relationship with there kids and each other. The house is beautiful
I love his GNX.
Beautiful home & essence. Also congrats ❤️
*The house is cool !!! I Love the backyard and the Kitchen I can cook there all day long!!!*  ❤👌
The nicest guys house I’ve ever seen
I’m pretty sure his kids are delinquents. He keeps saying this is where they study. His daughter is only 15 and looks like a hooker and his son looks like he’s on something. So yeah buddy. 🧐
Very homely and calm home
I'm surprised his house is so elegant. Just different to what I saw on articles written about him and Kourtney. Now I know why she fell in love with him and the side by side chair on the dining is so sweet.
He is such a great guy.
He looks like a druggie
Travis and Kourtney are so amazing together but I love that Travis says he loves the simplicity and clean spaces. His body is a contrast to that - he is an amazing human being and a true artist. You can see how much he appreciates life
Guys, just explain me, I am not American, do you have insects there in California? Doors are always opened which makes me like “ha? I would die to find spiders everywhere in my house if I keep doors open.”
Haha it’s so stupid how people are always making fun of him and Kourtney for their style, looking down on him expecting him to have skulls and a punk rock style is just as stupid as you making assumptions 😂 celebrities aren’t like their early career style, this isn’t 2002, it’s 2022. People are allowed to change
Travis feels so down to earth. Even I feel more relaxed after watching this.
i like that the house doesn't feel extravagant but still luxurious and homey. Travis is correct home is where u feel peace of mind and comfort.
Hey Travis, I watched your home tour video, very cool home, very homey. It's so obvious why you are with Kourtney and not Scott Disick. That's a compliment to you and her. I don't like cutting another person down to make another person look better so I won't. You have excellent taste. You certainly don't need some random person on YouTube comments to tell you anything but everyone has personal opinions no matter rich, poor, socioeconomic background etc. As long as respectful, to me at least, I like when people tell me what they really think of me or my taste, to me it's interesting. So here's my one critique of your car collection, I love black cars but I noticed every car you have is black. Did you ever consider another color? Lol. Just a casual observation. Oh by the way I graduated from H.S. in 1987 and my buddy bought a brand new black Grand National exactly like yours. I had a BMW but everyone, including me, thought the Grand National was THE coolest car ever. He took me for a ride and that thing was so fast it scared the crap outta me. It was like a rocket. But the funniest part was one day about 1pm on a school day (high school) my buddy drives up in the Grand National on the main street that about half the high school faces and stops in the middle of the road. It was summer so all the school windows were open. He proceeds to start doing donuts with smoke just billowing out so much that eventually you couldn't see the car. He finally stopped and you could hear him laughing in the car as he drove away. Everyone in my class was laughing, clapping and cheering and you could hear every classroom doing the same up and down the hallways. It was hilarious! Anyway congratulations on your nuptials. Peace out.
Wow, what a beautiful house, Travis Barker seems like a really nice man.  I hope she makes him happy.
simple is good , always
someone got an I.D on his creepers shoes?
Everyone 👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼👇🏼blah blah blah 😁😁
do not know Travis Barker, but I'm now a fan.  He's genuine, deep, an ARTIST!.  Also, I love his house.
I was expecting chaos and disorder not this elegance and sophistication. Totally impressed
Does Kris Jenner work for Clement Design and gets a commission for every house? Besides I LOVE their style.
Well, I am ashamed of myself. I have never heard of Travis (I am old!), and I saw him in this video and immediately judged him by his look.  5 mins in I realised (once again) that was the wrong thing to do. I ended up admiring his home and his approach to family and animals.  I am now going to listed to some of his music!
Justin Bieber junior 😆😆
🥱🥱🥱🥱🥱 🥱🥱
day and night compared to mtv cribs ep
Man, if I was rich I would hire the designer for my house. So beautiful
Please don't make Travis Barker crazy.
If u believe in the so called dnt judge a book by ts cover this Travis is a real man
the way he talks is really calming
Beautiful home ❤️❤️
I love that MTV Cribs is back
He sounds like the Kardashians.
I'm just so happy for Kourtney  and Travis. It's not easy to find a soul mate. Wishing them all the best.❤
I thought on the Kardashians, Kris Jenner said that Travis moved in the neighborhood to be next to Kourtney, even if he couldn't be with her and I know Kourtney  hasnt had her home  for 16 years???
He seems like a stable dude.
😍😍😍
this guy is evil
🌱💚
Im shook…. Travis has exquisite taste. Its so minimal, yet chic and neutral without being boring. Even the touches of his home are so sweet and sentimental to his life. I LOVE THIS 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Fav. Travis closet so cool good luck to these welcome of 8....
Pause at 10:28 and read the candles name haha “this smells like Kourtney’s orgasm”
Such a chill dude, Kourtney has scored a goodun!
What a good way to sell your house. Lol.
This guy seems really cool and chill
He sounds so calm and laid back
This is “ONE” of my closets!🤷‍♀️✌🏻❤️🥰
sid vicious would be spinning in his grave if he saw where his portrait was hung
He is the definition of 'don't judge a book by its cover' :D His house is so elegant, chill vibe and organized.
Wow lovely!! Yep he’s like the male version or Kourtney hahaha makes sense
The Christmas gift he got of his 5 most influential albums in a painting, is quite possibly one of the sweetest most thoughtful gifts.
Listening to Travis talking is soo Soothing 😊😉, his house is so beautiful, he definitely has a good taste. Him and kourtney look very much happy. Wishing them both happiness 🥰🌻🌻
His house is beautiful and the cars🔥
Lovely home and person.
Travis' voice is like, so relaxing, it's really like, nice to like hear him like talk about the things and like,  people that he obviously like, loves so much.
This is one of my favorites to date- the kitchen was EVERYTHING!!!! Know I just need a  Blake Lively episode 🤞🏽
another tacky cal mansion posing as classy
Don’t judge a book by its cover.
i have one draw for cloths lmao
i love their relationship
Very nice house!
I adore the essence of this gentleman.  Very genuine soul🎶🙏🏽🌎♥️
He’s just a normal, boring, laidback dude! How refreshing!💙🙌🎩👑 CongratZ C&T🥂🍾🎉🎊
5:23 i wonder whos starbucks order that is and who owns that hydroflask
very happy for them both!
this is like if heroin bob didn't OD
Travis is a vibe. I'm happy for the world he radiates from within. Truly a beautiful soul. But I make the best matcha, Travis :)
Both ratchet as hell.
Where the hell is my husband, he better be on this level or even better SERIOUSLY!! OMG!!!!!! LOVE HIM!!!
You can tell he is wondering soul ❤️
Looks very sterile...like no one actually lives there...no one with taste or a personality.
I want to count how many times he says “like” haha
Stunning place! Meanwhile, I’m wondering if I can afford a new ceiling fan.
Jesus loves you 🙏🏾💖 pray, read his word and repent, he is coming again soon!
Are you aware of this? Yeshua is coming very soon.  - Yeshua Coming -  The world is preparing to meet Satan. But the brides of Yeshua must prepare to welcome Yeshua.  Are you aware of this?  1. The clouds in the sky are gradually coming down to the ground. 2. Every day we see a super moon and a super sun. 3. Looking at the pink sky. 4. They're spraying chemtrails like crazy. 5. The moon is spinning round and round.  I encourage you to raise your eyes and look at the sky. Do you see these facts?  Nibiru is coming.  What I saw the vision from God, there is a red planet and a white planet in Nibiru system. Now, the FAA Alaska, Colorado web camera shows a red planet, a white planet, and sometimes two suns.  Yeshua is coming very soon. Stay spiritually awake.  Only Yeshua!
why do people sit on the counter instead of, idk, sitting in a chair
WTF has she done to him
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved and inherit the Kingdom of Heaven and eternal life. told other people how good he is, how he saves, heals and liberates and gives eternal life
Wow. I would have expected for his design style to be Industrial or some sort of Steam Punk. It’s a nice refreshing house.
16 years in a house says a lot about him as a person. Celebrities usually move what seems like every 3 years
Good stuff.
The 'This smells like Kourtneys orgasm' candle got me lol.
wtf is he wearing
Ah blended families that actually work. I love it!!!
“one of my closets…” 😭😭 bro my entire wardrobe fits in like 5 drawers
He has substance.
Nice!
Waldo should have renovated that leather jumpsuit! He couldn’t find him though
Me encanta 😍 Thanks for sharing 🖤
he is scary though with the evil artwork
Am completely surprised his personality  the house,kourtney is finally settled with peace of mind
Damn all I want are all his band tees
@10:58 the white pillow just moves foward and the shadow on the headboard disappears 😳
whoever is reading this, GET RIGHT WITH GOD! GOD IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!
This is really nice. So zen and minimal but still comfortable and family oriented. And definitely masculine with all the black but it's not over powering. The designer did a really good job.
Nice house Travis and he seems like a nice simple guy
It’s SO MUCH NOT HIM 😂😂😂 To sum up, he went on tour for a year, gave his keys to the best home Designer, went back home and said « waow it’s so me »… when we know it looks like any other house in LA 😂😂😂😂
no.
Kourtney is looking amazing. Won’t lie.
Those kitchen cabinets- yikes.
Travis is far more elegant and refined than you'd imagine - what an interesting man!  I can see how Kourtney would fully appreciate this "complete human" who has his own success, money & home ... so happy they went from "great friends" to "forever love" 🖤❤️🖤❤️🖤  Damn - Travis's fleet of black cars! 😎
So happy for Kourtney…… Travis has such a peaceful and calming presence do you guys hear his voice is so soothing.
Why does Kort look like she *NEVER* showers anymore?
Why is he wearing a trash bag?
Beautiful house the renvation looked fantastic black and white sultry moods sexy and modern.Don't ever sell your vintage T shirts love your styles The Mrs looks special in pyjama top
Classy home, they seem very happy and sweet :)
A casa é muito bonita,tô apaixonada!!! É bem minimalista,pelo estilo dele pensei que fosse totalmente diferente do que é, foi além das minhas expectativas,gosteiii :)
This house is amazing!!
I have no idea who this guy, but he is the best example how looks can be deceiving: looks trashy but when he talks he seems genuinly nice and thoughtful.
NICE
https://youtu.be/k5dnzapRvS0
She couldn’t get dressed for his house tour really. Everything else is amazing and he’s so chill.
Where is all your stuff? Me and my kids would go crazy living there with not much to do lol
Doctors Hospital/ Augusta Georgia loves you.
i love how he has to tell us he eat VEGAN food lmao
Does Courtney have to sit on you kitchen in her pj top only, while you are filming for the great AD
Great taste. Love it.
Such A Hard Worker, Great Dad And Great Artist. He Deserves A Awesome Place To Relax And Recharge
Hello people. ❤️ If you have some extra penny or maybe some change after buying a meal or something, I could really use some help rn. 🙏 I'm trying to get help so that I can pay for the overdue bills, buy meds for my mamma and pappa and also pay the rental, before we get kicked like garbage again. Most especially now that we havent paid the April rental yet. 😓 Its okay if you cant, prayers are so much appreciated. 😇 Sorry, to bother tho, Im just really on a survival mode rn. Im so sorry. I really am. I hope you all understand. 🙏  Thank you and GOD bless. 🙏
What the hell is he wearing? 😂
A beautiful abode....I'm glad that Travis isn't apparently triggered by a fireplace ..that he can enjoy it's beauty despite what he's lived thru.......kudos for strength!!!! His Tshirt collection is wicked cool.  Lol ...now that they're married,  I wonder how they will match spaces... .... Lots to think about when combining homes.... Happy for MRS & MR BARKER!!!!
Beautiful home, and he seems pretty chill despite him being married to a Kardashian
What a nice guy, so down to earth …I hope he doesn’t lose himself with his new ‘extended’ family…
Always good to have a plate next to your bed
Good guy
He is a great fit for Kourtney. Kourtney please do not mess it up!!! Awesome home!
did he fall into a newspaper printer
HE IS SO FREAKIN PRESCIOUS 🥹🥹🥹
Lol that moment when the house looks better than the owner😬😅
Wow 😯
adorable when he said where everyone sits at the table 💞
@1:34 flipping the birdie huh.........
Wow! Congrats on both match made in heaven.
I hope Kourtney doesn’t make him move. I LOVE this home. The Kardashians tend to control their men. I think he’s strong with a gentle heart.
He’s got a very calm and mild vibe. How gentle. The relationship is sort of very endearing. PDA or not, weird feelings about Kourtney whatever whatever, they’re very cute and seem like a very kind, warm and happy couple. It’s far from my reality but I can’t find fault with any of it. Comfy, cozy, sweet.  Oh wait He just said…something alluding to this being a small home…at just under 10,000 square feet. WHAT PLANET IS CALABASAS?
Who doesn't love Trav he is the absolute sweetest husband,father,best friend.He has such a sweet soul...Wish you and Kourtney nothing but blessings and happiness,love u all...
Travis barker = real manz
I really enjoyed watching this. He has a beautiful home and even more beautiful family.
I love that he said I don’t like too many people in my home cause I relate to that, deeply.
This man loves a fireplace and I’m here for it 😂🙌
Modern day CRIBS.
Awesome house and awesome work fellas'
He is going to die in a sea of bland.
Beautiful Buick Grand National.
Love this house. Especially that kitchen wow that black and white aesthetic is *chef’s kiss*
I know it's about the house and the design, but why do they make these houses look unused? Like even the fireplace in the garden doesn't have a stain on it. How?
I feel like I'm watching an SNL character in a skit, but this house is stunning, and Travis is supremely talented. It's nice to see how beautiful his house is.
He is so strange looking
I’ll take the Dior Bikes please.
Love this guy 👏👏👏 yay Kourtney 💚
I liked him more than the house, so chill! ✌🏻
Kourtney casually on the counter 😂😂😂
My favorite car as well 87 Buick Grand National Twin Turbo. Fastest Factory Built Car in 1987. Maybe one day if I ever can get an accident settlement from getting hit with 14,000v of High Voltage Electricity, Ill own that car.
Wtf lauv doing???
The “my mom’s rosary” part was the best.
I don’t feel any “bragging” or “showy” the way he presented his house and his successes. A well mannered and humble man. Congratulations to Kourtney and Travis you guys are meant to be. Oh!, definitely love the house BTW.
i find it boring. Would love to see pictures of when he "lived" in it. he seems like an awesome person.
Would have been better without a Kardashian in it 😕
Travis escaped death. Let’s hope he survives a Kardashian. Praying.
Why can’t she sit on the chair and work?  Why kitchen table?
blink trice if you're kidnapped
WOW....very surprised at how laid back, articulate and "normal" this dude seems....blessings..
The San Fernando Valley part of Calabasas or the "other side of the mountain" part of Calabasas which we used to call Las Virgenes?
Like ,like like!!! It's Like totally!!
When your  birthday is October 17th lmao
Hades and Persephone.
I’d enjoy living here
Muln Mullen automotive ev
Beautiful home.
I love his energy and aesthetics 💕 thank you Travis for showing your home.
If Mr. Barker ever read this comment, Sir... I might take many ideas from your home because yours are what I've been dreaming when it comes about minimalism and zen home. but I'm just not that good to conceptualize what I really want. Most of the time I just don't have time to plan it in detail. Thank you!
Ew
Travis actually seems pretty chill & really family oriented. No wonder Courtney wanted him . Not to mention he’s still pretty good looking
Im impressed he gave his keys to dude n went on tour for months n came home to a complete home reno…. Home is amazing… but who knew Dior did BMX bikes? Amazing
Did she really have to be sitting on the kitchen counter in a pyjama shirt tho 🙄
So beautiful!! Nicely done! 🤩
Kourtney picked the right guy!  They are very similar - family first and health conscious!!!
Smells like kourtneys orgasm…
Thank you...your home is peaceful..a serene sanctuary 🌻
Travis going for the Missy Elliot look from her “The Rain” video 😂😂
Thee best surprise.  I wasn't expecting that.  Beautiful, calming and sensual home.  Intelligent, articulate and sensitive man.  LOVE surprises like this.  Just goes to show you that you can NEVER judge a book by it's cover.
Worderful house seriously
Who else thinlks He doesn't deserve her? Man, you could've done waaay better.
Wow he is totally cool 😎
Got the raf martens on 🫠🫠🤌🏽
So October 17. 2021 is the "first" time they hooked-up or hung out...the day they got engaged...not buying it!  Look at all the photos of them before that date.
His rather intimidating appearance does not go at all with him as a person.Seems v kind,loves his family,loves KK,has sophisticated taste, and seems at peace in his skin.Nice to get to know him a bit here.
Are we all just going to ignore the “this smells like Kourtney’s orgasm” candle in the bedroom? We are? Ok…
Why blur out the art? The banksy by the bmx bikes looked cool it’s a shame it’s blurred out.
I haven't liked any of the modern-looking homes of the CA Hollywood community for a long time. But, if I'd ever have the chance to be in TB's home I'd never want to leave. It's exquisite and so comfortable looking.
"Once you take all the pillows off" is the theme of this tour
I did not expect Mr. Barker to be this well-spoken, he comes across very gentle.
lol Kourtney sitting on the counter.. not stagged at all.
He seems so genuinely nice i hope the kardashiane curse stays away from him
I love  this house.
I was waiting to see the Cadillac lol he was obsessed with them when he was in blink and his tattoo of it is so iconic. It’s cool to see one of my childhood favorite artist how he grew. And best interior so far with the Ackles in my opinion.
honestly this is the first celebrity house i’ve seen that i can imagine living in
This is one of my closets... That's 20x my closet.
What should I do to have such a beautiful house 😭😭😭
your face looks like a devil face , is that your aim ?
Awwww how he greeted her 😩🥰🥰🥰🥰 seem like puppy love 💕
His home is everything!!!!
He needs to be kind and rich because he looks so nasty like he just walked out of San Quentin. He had to include his entire head, neck and some on his face🤮 something is seriously wrong with him
why the most lazy kardashian pretending she is busy, and who work sits on that, just fake?
I really love his house, it's comfortable but elegant at the same time, beautiful home for sure✨
Best of wishes to KK and TB -  I believe this marriage out of all the Kardashians is a keeper.
i really like him
He surprised the hell out of me, such an amazing space and I love the minimalist aesthetic in the house. Amazing
I like him. I can see why Kourtney likes him.
Such a calm, relaxing, voice. He appears to be genuine and a true family man.👍💘
Kourtney sitting on the counter on her laptop enjoying her matcha is a serious mood 👑 she livin her best life
Wow. This is the first time I am  experiencing his personality. Amazing
this was a good video
Wow, he's so nice and sounds like a great dad.
His voice is so soooooothing had to watch it again kept zoning out 💕
AD had to blur da Kaws bear
He should do some voice over, his voice is perfect for it.
Beautiful house I love you house,thank you to sharing you beautiful house .
Very nice!!
“this closet had a little bit of shoes” LOL this is so funny to me
Loved this
I had never given thought to what kind of person he might be, but I like him!  He seems like a sweet, normal guy that has nice stuff..... 😂😂
His vibe= immaculate
Lame
AD. slummin'
Fantastic interview! Love this guy.👍
If eating salads and vacationing is working then yes Kourtney is a hard worker.
Seems like a genuine Man.
He has such a great energy  .....I hope they get their own show
What a great perfect place!  Love that he’s vegetarian ❤
Don't judge a book by its cover.
Travis, I remember when you lived in Riverside county. I used to see you in your white Escalade truck at a certain Subway all the time when I was in high school. I always wanted to say hi but I didn't want to be that guy while you were trying to eat lol. Glad to see you're doing well man, you were a huge part of me growing up. Blink was always on my skate walkman cd player and Ipod.
He really looks like a sweet guy
the house has this tranquility vibes and harmony..happy for kourtney to find such a loving partner..she deserved such happiness and stability
Travis is DOPE.
So glad it’s was just him doing the interview! He’s such a chill guy!
Yeah he minimalist 6 rooms 12 cars so basic and down to earth he even has the earth tone sofas. 👎
Love your house❤️
THANK YOU, for sharing.  Love it all.
Lol, nice place, but I could've gone with not hearing about the tarantula part. Mental thought probably would've gone down like: "wait, what's that huge dark object moving across my wall? Is that a...??? Oh, WTF!!!" It would've freaked me right the hell out.
How do they decide on what to wear, so many clothes!!
cool vibes
You should buy yourself drum lessons.
He's so chill I can definitely see why kourt is w him. He brings her peace.✌🏼
Love that the lady was in her PJ's while taping this!
Just curious why in some AD vids some of the artwork is blurred out?
What a nice guy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Obsessed
Inside Travis Barkers home that Kourtney completely changed, so that she likes it. Another man that’s going to be ruined by the Kardashians!
This is the first time I’m hearing him talk
They seem like such a good match for each other. Love them!
Can I watch a version without the Kardashian?
10:28 the label on the candle omg😭
Pura vida great home opens for family members
Really love the minimalism and clean lines, lovely home tastefully decorated
Their house is Incredible 🤙🏽
He seems to really love that house,  does that mean it will be the blended family home ??
He’s the definition of don’t judge a book by its cover. I never would have thought this of him, he’s so classy, intelligent, and an overall cool dude. Beautiful home ❤️
So he has a fireplace guys. Lol 😂 I love him lol 😂
Great house! For my own taste, I would need a lot more color.
This house is so LA
What a nice guy.
🖤
He really looks in love.
F*cking weirdos man 🤮🤮🤮🤮
Your awesome and so good for the love of your life. You have an amazing vibe. Never loss that. You bring out the best in your soul mate.
Nice guy!!
the candle-
Sitting unfresh atop a kitchen counter where meals are prepped and eaten. Unsanitary
yup...i need to get rich
Yo, how’d that pillow stand up straight while he was talking about the bed?!?
Next victim for Kardashians.But he seems really good person
This is really Travis' time!
That candle on his bedside table “This smells like Kourtneys orgasm” like around 10:30
dang all the artists he records and produces for is so cool 😗
How calming his voice is
This feels so much more like an ACTUAL home vs what most of the Kardashians have. Everyone is totally entitled to their own style, but I feel like any mess by little kids in the Ks’ home is totally I permitted. They seem to love everything clean white and pristine at literally allll times. 😂
Beautiful home, beautiful family, beautiful couple!!!  God bless everyone!!!
JESUS IS LORD AND KINGS OF KINGS   Jesus loves you He die for you and arose to give you life. And still loves you even though you reject him.

10:26 READ THE NAME OF THE CANDLE 😂
I love him for Kortney 😍 the house is beautiful too
please tell me someone else saw the candle….
Wow, I like this guy. He is so chill.
I love him and and love AD for this meeting with travis ☀️💕mercii
He always look like someone who's been in a 3+ years opiate addiction.
don’t be saying too much about ysl💀
gosh. dude is so damn sweet, soft spoken, and just straight up nice. this was lovely.
Honestly, I didn't know what to expect. I am pleasantly surprised - Travis is a whole vibe! I love his calm demeanor and down-to-earth personality. The aesthetics of his home definitely reflect and complement his spirit!
His voice is like his home…soothing. Thank you for sharing
I love it. It looks like a home still but it’s put together and minimalistic and modern.
He is way chill. Pretty laid back dude.
I love the bbq area most! it is both indoor and outdoor and the vibe is so relax!!!
Wow..
Imagine the taxes.
Is nobody gonna talk about him flipping us off for a few minutes? Lmao
Wow I did not know they were together lol man you just never know huh
👍
Scott is probably watching and criingging ! and I don't blame him, he literarily mentions her name every opportunity he gets.
The West's NWO, agenda 21 is well under way. They claim they are spreading their idea of democracy around the world, but it's not so democratic when you begin to understand the bigger picture. Foretold in the holy scriptures, we as Christian Nations should understand what is happening. Jesus Christ is who he said he was and he has warned us of a tyrannical one world government that will destroy the people. The people will perish because they do not know the holy scriptures. I beg people to please humble yourselves, not to save this world, it is already lost as predicted but to save yours and your childrens souls. Jesus Christ is the truth, the life and the only way to the Father. Turn to him now in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy spirit- Amen ❤
And I love how he shows the house and the meaning behind everything.. Everything with Scott is just showing off, copying. It’s a copy of the kardashian/Jenner houses and Very generic. I wouldn’t  at house and say that’s Scott’s house!  Whereas this screams Travis. He has a nice house but it’s for himself, not for show.
he’s so down to earth & genuine it’s so nice to just listen to. really really cool guy
What a beautiful home with great energy.
Good taste house and cars!
Courtney is dating him ???
Beautiful house but that garbage bag and bozo shoes are fricken hilarious
They complement each other ❤️
🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤🖤
What a great guy! I think Kourtney waited for perfect!
Nobody is going to talk about what goes on at 10:34?
Beautiful home, beautiful family. His voice is so calming and serene. I’m happy for them both.
Travis almost looks like pinhead from hell raiser,all he's missing is the pins on his head 😳
Beautiful home but what impressed me the most is how he values family.  Family truly is everything.
His candle by the bed "this smells like Kourtneys orgasm" 🙃🌹
Everything is so beautiful!! And then that motorbike was the cherry on top!
All table corners should be pectangular or rounded because those spikes are dangerous.
Trav is a sweet & gentle soul ❤️
House decorated with alot of black, he said he "murder it out?" 🥴
It looks like a Kardashians house. Kourtney probably remodelled for him.
Gorgeous home! Timeless
1. Stop standing like a circus clown 2. Stop wearing clown shoes 3. stop wearing clown clothes
why do i feel like hes seventeen
I love one story homes. So much easier to live in.
Absolutely stunning home
Love it , your  Home looks peaceful and serene. Congratulations and blessings to all of you ❣
All I can think of is how much an amazing person he seems to be just by how he talks and by the state of his home. So humblr fown to earth and a fam guy... damn i never thought
Wow. Looks are deceiving. Not what I expected and what a lovely fellow. Beautiful space.
She's a lucky girl
How did I get here? I couldn’t care leas
His voice is zen. I need videos of him reading. ❤️🛌
Travis has the most calming energy. I love his passion for life! Incredible cozy thoughtful house
Small
This feels like a boujee version of cribs !!! And im not mad !! Lol
Travis is so together..well spoken and so hands on.  I hope journey doesn't destroy his kindness.
Where is his wife or mother of the kid's?
Travis you better run, you seen what they did Bruce and Lamar.
You seem a real gentleman..now I understand why she picks you! Your strong tattoos gave us wrong impression all the way! Be well and happy :))
I modify and reupholster furniture and I love color.  He has a beautiful home but color can be used with a calming result.
They need to start showing who cleans the houses 🙏
Luv the vibe in the house,so happy he and Kourtney fell in love and married each other. I secretly made a wish for Kourtney a few years ago that she would meet someone who would love and cherish her and it happened. These two are my favorite couple.
dude california is turning people into straight WEIRDOS. wtf is that leather jumpsuit ... its definitely NOT it.
They have similar design taste.
Awe. He is so sweet and soft spoken. Whenever you see someone with so many tattoos, you assume things. I love his energy. Love & light
"just to place my yeeeeeeeeddddd"  😭😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣❤️❤️
His personality doesn’t match his drumming
He’s lovely. Great energy. Happy for Kourtney.
I love how much his home has been crafted with his kids in mind. Like him knowing where each and every child sits for family dinner on Sunday is just so wholesome. I also adore how much he adores the picture Penelope drew of him and he had framed.
I get it Kourtney.
Yay,  you're vegan!!! I love it :)
I’ve always loved Travis! From his days in Blink 182 to now, he’s just so cool
This guy looks creepy 😳
I just love how he talks about their whole family spending time together. So happy for he, Kourtney and their kids. Everyone deserves love❤️
He seems like he is in a really positive season of his life right now.
Yo she really doing this guy over her baby dad girl you make me sick 🤢 do you really look at him good mann
Kourtney out here acting like she just woke up with a full face of makeup 😂
Wait journey will change it all.
His energy is so so beautiful. Chill to the max. Good for Kort. 🙏🏾
The home is soo beautiful and sophisticated ❤️ One of the best soo far!!
Tell me why I thought this was an SNL skit when I first clicked
He’s so sick man
I’m happy to see her happy I think she deserves it
He is smart funny sensitive loving talented hott   n did i say talented and her 🤔?
OMG SO IMPRESSED I LOVE THIS HOUSE!!
Is it just me or his voice is just wow.
He needs to get off of the meth. Especially when he has children. There is some excellent help out there for these addictions.
Where is the flavor
Kourtney soulmate for sure
What a luxury to have a house under 10000 square feet😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Really nice❤🤍
Such a nice house! I loved it
His voice is so calming and soft 🥹
THE COKE PLATE
Thank you travis &best family of yall mean for tour of your gnarly casa!!!!one love for the inspiration that was shared,&for real lights mi Mundo oh yeah almost forgot  ,need any props  I can send you some pics  ,
what a sweet man!
they both scored w each other...especially happy for Kourt ♥
You are so cool Travis ♥️
Seems like a genuinely good guy. I like his music and what he does. I was worried when I saw the thumbnail and it looked like he was sick. I've always enjoyed the music but I couldn't name a single song except for "What's my name again". Travis Barker's decor is great is great, and it seems like his wife is put together. I wish my husband and I could meet them, but from the lyrics in the past there is something anti-gay there, but not sure. I wish the best for them. It sounded like they would never invite people like us, plus my husband and I are poor farmers. Thank you for the great music I will continue to enjoy it! Rock on!
He has come a long way since mtv cribs still chill vibe!!!!
now I know why he and Kourtney click so well. What a beautiful home.
His home represent his soul and he def spiritual and have emotional intiliggent person. never judge books by it cover for sure. his home is clean and zen vibes for sure.
Complete 180 from his MTV cribs episode back in the day. Love to see it
He always look so wierd I didn't know he vo talk
Wow, how unexpectedly boring and depressing...
Wow, I am totally in love with Travis Barker right now this was an amazing video! Thank you for sharing! He is an amazing man and I am so happy for he and Kourtney
One doesn’t experience self transcendence, the illusion of self only dissipates—🎈
Looks like a comfortable laid back home. Love it.
Kourtney picked very well.
he scared me untl he started talking lol if he was standing in a room int he dark Id freak out
Lovely home, and equally lovely human being 💓
My celebrity crush since the fourth grade, turning 30 in two weeks.
Why is he wearing a lawn and leaf bag?
He’s so humble, you can totally tell from the way he speaks about his home and family 🌻
What a hardworking sweet dude. Always been a fan, but I like him more now haha
he should def be the next ghost rider
I love him
Sorry, was that dude just wearing a garbage bag at the beginning?
What the hell is he wearing
He got me at his matcha is far superior lol
I paused the video to see what 5 albums are in the painting of records that changed his life. I saw Pink Floyd "The Wall", Dr. Dre "The Chronic" and Prince and the Revolution "Purple Rain Soundtrack". Those 3 I have listened to more than I could count. However my father was playing Pink Floyd not me, but I still always loved that album. I could only make out one more "Operation Ivy" but I've never heard of that one before.
Kris must’ve taken over Barkers management.
He high asf
Damn you can actually feel the peacefulness of this home watching the video.
Everything Beautiful ❤️. Such a Beautiful Home and Congratulations to you both!!!
@7:19, is that River Phoenix?
My place look a lot like his very simple to the point.
Who the heck is Travis?
His voice is so calming - like his home! Not what I expected at all
Yooo I am looking through these comments there is NOOOO shot I'm the only one that noticed that candle in the bedroom
Travis just showed the world not to judge a book by its cover. G-d bless him.
He’s such a good man.
Big home but a clean minimalist home. I really love it. Sweet rides including bikes.
My favorite part is Penelope's drawing of Travis ❤️
he's a sweet man who proves that we can't judge someone from their appearance let alone from the tattoos on their bodies.
Based on him telling about his house & not knowing him... He seems like someone who hates drama, even keel person, kinda like how kourtney seems with her family, in the handful of their shows I've seen... See why they mesh... Congratulations & best wishes to U both.
Also, I would watch a Keeping Up with the Barkers show 😂😂😂
Beautiful home.
Well he's gone Full Kardashian.
Travis is such a low key, calm spirit type of dude. I can see why he is not into the Dashian drama and Kourtney is following her man which is the complete opposite from “The Lord” aka Scott 😂. Travis is truly about connecting with his family. GOOD FOR THEM ❤️the home.
I love his energy. You can feel how clean and simple his energy is. I don’t know him but I can feel that I can be bff with him and Kourtney here
I didn't know what a G.Wagon.was,thanks. I.drive a 2007 Honda Accord v6.  Will be my last car ,don't like payments!!
Matcha is nasty, no matter who makes the thing. What is he wearing.
Using LeBron for clout
I can see why kourtney stuck with him, wow wasn’t expecting such a calm presence from this guy.
Love the house , but most of all I enjoyed was how he loves Courtney . Beautiful soul have this man. Courtney , you are fortunate!!
I don't blame him... I wouldn't want a lot of people in my beautiful home either... Haha + she has a big family
Cool dude... hope he remains like that.
Beautiful home! Thank you for sharing.
This. Guy is so gross
My toxic trait with these tours is that I actually think I’m gonna be invited over to have dinner and talk about books, movies and music
Travis,thank you for sharing your lovely home. I do hope you can keep.it and blend your family there. Blessings
Such a beautiful interview. Very intimate and personal. I see why Kourtney loves him....vegan, chill, minimalist, clean, good vibes😊.
what kind of sandwiches do these people eat?  gross
Your house is a home please keep it like this it’s happy
nice guy. sweet house. cool style. props.
I’m truly impressed Travis!!! Would seem Kourtney got a good clean one who’s a real family man 🥰🌹💯Saw you in concert back in the day and you didn’t disappoint!!!
Travis why are you wearing coveralls at home you goon lmao
I wish everyone who watches this video lived in a house of his/her dream.
His voice is so relaxing. He should do an audio book
Beautiful tranquil home.
Who doesn't like Travis and OMG his house is so elegant. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!
I love Courtney short hair it looks beautiful on her it’s perfect for her demeanor
I love how normal he is!!
Island Boy
No wonder Kourtney married you! 💍🤎
Only thing I don't like is the fireplace that just looks like a square cut out of drywall lol.
Oh he’s in deep lol it’s actually cute how he says her name and it’s with complete admiration
I know exactly what he did to get KK.
Dude could wear a different shirt without repeating for at least 2 or 3 years
If that was his home, then why didn't he do something normal, like make a sandwich or jump in the bed. Plus, no family pics. Allegedly ☹️
I love yaur house, I love the style and the colors. You are so cool Travis.
I have always loved Travis. He seems like the most caring, kind, giving person. Kourtney is a lucky gal.
I love ❤️ the house 🏡  Looks fabulous 👍
Travis, ew. Who let you choose BLACK covers for your outdoor furniture, disgusting.  -Kourtney K.
He looks happy and so mellow, congrats!
Beautiful
Yall have a beautiful  home. All I want are some missing teeth due to my diabetes . I know you work hard for what you have. I'm 62 and on disability.
His house is absolutely beautiful but seriously, listening to him speak was sooo relaxing I would love to listen to him do ASMR his voice is very nice!
I’m glad I tuned into this video. Not at all what I expected and pleasantly surprised. Thanks for sharing and letting us into your sanctuary.
If Travis had a podcast I would definitely listen..his voice is soooo soothing and he expresses himself so effortlessly..such a sweet and kind guy 🖤
Wow he has a beautiful home, it’s very high end but at the same time very down to earth & homely!
What a really nice guy! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Lol i didn't know this is what he sounds like 😅
Like, Travis is a downgrade in the looks department because Scott looks a lot better, but, his personality is a huge upgrade from the latter, and at the end of the day that outweighs looks.  He really appears to be a sincere person who really seems to genuinely love Kourtney
Did anyone keep track of how many times he said "like"?
Good,genuine human.
Kourtney Kardashian just sitting on the kitchen counter like that's where she hangs.
Lol 😂 people thinking this dude cool
https://youtu.be/-Ma9avXW8bs
Wtf happened to this guy? He used to be cool when I was a kid
this guy looks like a serial killer
You’re a nice guy!!! I enjoyed the tour of your home,You have a calmness about you. I am a car person as well I  have a G as well. Now I understand why you two are in love!!
Love the bnw kitchen and neutral dining room it's beautiful. This is comfy celeb homes. And love the way he talk about his family, full of love.
Love it 😍
Love the home but few things jump out which just show how out of touch they are. You would never see Blake Lively, Jessica Alba, or Hilary duff sitting on their kitchen counter all provocatively for cameras with their laptops like Kourtney was staging herself. The fact that Kourtney feels she needs to do that at all her times of her life is quite disappointing. She's a beautiful, powerful woman without having to do that every second of her life. She couldn't even use her laptop, it kept sliding off.
Beautiful and calm home!
Kourtney is so lucky Travis is a great guy wish all the best for them. Beautiful home
I absolutely love this home.  You can feel the Zen vibe through the screen.  I learned this year that we share the same birthdate, Nov. 14th except that I am MUCH older (LOL), you were born the same year as my daughter.  There is a quiet elegance that exudes from each room.  Congratulations on your appreciation for life.  Travis Barker, you are just too cool.
This is my style! Just beautiful
Also so touching that they had been giving each other thoughtful gifts for years before they were ever dating.
Why is he wearing a black trash bag?
Have never heard him speak before. Such a calming, soothing presence & so down to earth, family oriented. Good for him & kourtney. They are well matched!
Someone actually pronounce cocoa properly. My peeps laugh at me everytime I say it. He is soo cool
What an interesting guy. I wish them all the best.
It feels so relaxing to watch this.
This was like the most elevating meditation. One of my fave AD house tours by far.
Glad he's successful, he looks like a dink.  Hope it was all worth it 'cause now he looks like DEVO but with a horrible music catalog.
Love travis since blink 182…i always knew he’s a cool guy…and his voice is so relaxing…lucky kourtney…such a beautiful house and family 😊💕
This video is a perfect example of "never judge a book by its cover". Its so beautiful and livable.. not what I would've expected..
Woaaahhhh I am floored by their home, wooow it is gorgeous and homey
Travis.... You are truly and individual. A man after my own heart. Lol.... May serenity and blessings continue to find you in abundance. Be well bro'tha ☯️
I love how everything has sentimental value and really means alot to him where usually celebrities by a new house every few years and he has had his for 16! His kids grew up there and he really holds everything near and dear to his heart  and its not over the top either
Millonarios hijos de puta
“It’s a 1 story house. Like under 10k sq ft”   🫠🫠🫠 *cries in 1700 sq ft home*
my favorite AD so far!!
What a nice home and he seems like such a nice cool guy. I see what Kourtney sees in him.
👄 AWESOME👌💎
You are a great guy. I love seeing love you and Courtney together.  You guys are such a perfect couple. Perfect for each other. 💕 Lasting love for you guys!!
Is no one gonna talk about the candle?
I don't know a thing about this young man except pics of him and Kourtney.  He has a depth to his personality that impresses the hell out of me.  (yeah, a 71 yr. old black woman, at that) LOL  Anyway, now I have to go and check out his music.  As far as his house is concerned, I absolutely loved it - my taste all over the place.
I don't know anything about him except that he married Kourtney; expected to dislike him, but I like him.. they probably r perfectly matched! best wishes to the both of them!..I luv the house..so normal didnt expect to like it either..glad I watched!
you seem like a cool dude Travis. love how open, minimal and relaxing your home looks and feels.
He seems to be a really good person 🥰
Such a sweetheart and beautiful house 🏡
Who knew it would be Travis' house that would be my favorite on this series. Beautifully designed in a masculine zen way.
😂 I used to live in a 3 story house in bel air but it's too much so I bought this 1 story minimalist house that's just under 10 000 square feet!😂
Maybe is just me but feels strange that he doesn’t have anything related to blink 182 in his house, I was imagining that he would have something
Kourt never changed , pretended or gave up on the type of family / home life SHE wanted . Well done . 👍💞
i  would love to be able to have a house or a house like this :) very calming energy and his voice is very calming too- i can understand why he would not want many people in there-
This guy has such a chill vibe to him - wow xoxoxo
The chord from the lamp in the living space is the only thing not aesthetic 😅
Travis seems very down to earth and he’s well spoken. I consider him one of the greatest drummers ever! 🤘
Perfect example of , not settling for chaos in your life , if that's not what YOU want for YOUR life . Always, put self & kids first .👍💞
These two are the most annoying
the way he said "we rode dirt bikes through the house" so casually is so rock and roll
Such a cute couple
He doesn’t need to work out under that sweatsuit
Love him for Kourt . Appears to be a zen , beautiful couple . 👍💞
Love everything about Travis except kourtney 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Why is some of the art blurred
❤️ ❤️
Jeremy
Of course she crashed his interview. All the sisters do that to their man. Sad 😔
Wow! I thought everything would be black LOL.
Can someone find the exact electronic drum set he uses?!!!!! Looks so cool :)
I love his home!! Travis is definitely proof not to judge a book by its over, his home is so chill and I love the way he speaks of the memories he has in this home with his children. Its so homely! I can relate to loving things being minimal, it does bring you peace v/s have clutter everywhere.
0:36 is that lana del rey?
These ppl think they're original but these homes are ALL the same. Self indulgence at its peak. Excessive consumerism with cookie cutter MASSIVE closets. So, so selfish.
He is so soft spoken
Gorgeous home!
That Buick tho.😯
Never thought marrying a kardashian could be punk rock. but here we are
Nice
Always ❤️❤️❤️ Travis Barker❣️
This is soo beautiful, may we all find our twin flames, may we all find someone emotionally mature and loving. Being single is better than be with someone who is not your person like Scott and Kourtney was totally mismatched and I'm soo happy for Kourtney. She is into interior, vegan, aesthetic, minimalism, healthy lifestyle and so is Travis and I'm glad she found her person.
😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
🥰🧡🧡🧡🧡
what a sweetie!  in house and in souul    go court
Waldo said wall-go
Hollweird kookery
He's like no one can touch my vibrating organic bed lol 😆
The candle says….. smells like kourtneys orgasm😂
If there married. Why is it called Travis Barkers home? And where is all of Kourtney's stuff? Hmmm
It's speaking voice for me 😊
Such a beautiful home. I love him and Kourtney together.
I’m just gonna say it, cus I didn’t find a post on it… but that candle on his nightstand is just 🤣 wow
Congratulations on everything!!!
I LOVE HOW HIS TOUR INCLUDED SOO MANY MEMORIES ! …… BTW….. TRAVIS’ TARANTULA STORY REMINDED ME OF KOURTNEYS  TARANTULA SITUATION Lmao HAHAHAH
This by far is the best tour of a home that I have seen in 66 years of living.  Travis Barker I pray that God gives you and Kourtney and all of your family members and your future  baby all of the greatest blessings that God has the power and Glory to provide.  God knows your heart and sees what good you are doing in the world and there is no doubt that God is pleased with you and Kourtney and family!  God Bless all of you together forever 🙏❤️
MF HAS THE MAGIC FINGERS IN HIS BED
Three Christmas’ ago? They’ve only just met?!
I love how their relationship has organically grown over the years. This house is amazing. Best wishes to many years of happiness Travis, Kourtney, & Family💕🥂
He's so cool and chill. I also love that he had Kourtney on the table like the piece of decor, because she's that beautiful! 💗😍
Dope 🇺🇸
Congratulations You two...very glad Kourtney is respected and treated kindly. Screw baby daddy too little too late.Scott had 10 years to get it right. Good for you both..
Can't take anyone seriously that tattoos their face. 100% the worst place to get a tattoo. Anywhere from the throat up should be a no. Even the back of the neck or side or front should be a no never mind the actual face
This house is really cool.
I love them but the pda makes me so uncomfortable. But I love that they are so in love . But cmon.
LeBron's gonna come for his bike now
How about giving more towards fellow humans who literally do not even have clean water to drink or I guess do what you've been doing and get another black vehicle LOL, Maybe eat some meat and get your body weight in the normal range so you're not cold and have to wear a leather one zee in so cal weather 🤔
Kourtney ruins the video, acting all sexy is sickening!
I'll put my Racing Inc. up against either of those glorified mongooses.
Its so boring
His house has Kourtney all over it lol she definitely had a say in his decor .. I would never think this would be his style lol
blah blah
Woww I never expected Travis to be so down to earth and cool. The house is really beautiful and elegant and i especially love the music room. He speaks so highly about his kids and never once forgot to mention Kourtney’s kids. Would love to see more of his personality in interviews / videos
His house is gorgeous. And he seems like a really cool dad and person.
beautiful house but its got tarantulas....
The love for his kids is so evident. It’s so beautiful and refreshing
I expected his house to be cooler. It’s actually  boring and bland.  Looks like he bought a model home and kept the furnishings already there. No artwork, plain walls
why are they so gross and awkward
What a calm and peaceful man he is, not to mention romantic and detailed.
Beautiful home, Beautiful man💯💯
This is the first time I've heard Travis speak. I like his low-key energy. Very calming environment.
I remember the gold el dorado he had.. sickest car ever
Appearances trick, Travis a very intelligent person with such beautiful home and family.
🐐🥁🤩😉
His minimal decor is the doing of the hideous Kartrashian clan
Love him real laid back cool cat💫🍷🌹
love the design
He seemed to be a man of substance.  🖤
Travis Barker brings credibility to Kourtney Kardashian, the rest of her family are more plastic then they’re black credit cards
He speaks so calmly and his house is beautiful
He's such a chill dude
I like that it feels homey and it’s minimal
Hey Travis, congrats on you and Kourtneys wedding, so happy for you both, just wanted to say, that you should check out Jon Olson's roles royce, very nice Also, anyway, thank you for sharing 👍🙏❤️😎
Kourt will expect a new crib w/ her style & content & he’ll have a cave on the property-
Isn't  crazy  that because  f money people are willing  to married anyone out there
I have never heard him speak before and didn’t know anything about him. Hearing him and seeing his energy I can totally understand why they are together
I love this house
If my man don’t have a candle on his nightstand that smells of my orgasm i don’t want it. Lol
wtf does he have on?!!🤪
the only dark side of this house is his clothes hahahah
He's vegan? I would have never guessed...🙄
I feel the vibes like if travis is putting this on the market soon which is why he revamped up the home+ collabed a video for more value + audience appreciation.
Love his home and energy but kinda cracked up when i saw Kourtney. She couldn’t sit on a chair  lmao
This guy has depth mmm
Chairs every where, an endless supply of seating and she picks the counter top haha I get why they are together though, they have the same energy and are both very family oriented
discusting baby eaters
10:55 ...pillow..
One word: absolutely beautiful!
For such a famous and long time entertainer, his home was just really normal. Yeah its “boring” for a celeb but that’s what’s amazing about it. It’s not just his house, it truly is his family home.
Omg lol the kourtney candle 😂😂
Kourtney found a good man. He comes across as genuinely good. Very opposite of Kourtney's ex. Very mature guy.
Lovely lovely lovely ~  So you and so Kort ~  Really special. ☺️💖✨
Night and Day compared to Scott. He gives me the serenity vibe.  Scott never seemed mature enough for Kourtney.  He is an adult.  Scott never wanted to grow up from watching the Kardashians show
It took for them to put Travis Barker on after seeing his OG Cribs episode for me to realize Open Door is literally Cribs but less ridiculous (& naturally why I'm obsessed bc 00s nostalgia <33333)
IMO he only got this because of her
HEY MTV WHADDUP WELCOME TO MY CRIB
Blow up the internet why don't you? The hottest couple doing AD 😆
He seems like the male version of kourtney
I enjoyed watching this. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home🙏🏾
They are so cute together. I would say he definitely fits Courtney’s personality like their personalities together are amazing
Why is she dressed like that? I was embarrassed for her … it was like accidentally walking into a bathroom and seeing someone on the toilet!
Wow I love his voice, I could listen to him speak for hours, it's so soothing. His whole vibe seems so chill and good hearted, I hope he and Kourtney have a long happy life together.
What the heck does he have on?
I like that his home actually looks like a home. it’s not perfect or has so many extravagant things. It’s just a home.
I Iove his calm voice
They have a zen super rich lifestyle.
Travis is so articulate, smart and well-heeled.  Congrats on your marriage to Kourtney.
idk why i thought his voice would be deeper i like him especially for kourtney!!!…and i dont like ppl in my house either not too many at once only immediate family thats it
Who cares
This man has a soft, quiet and humble voice and his movements seem calm, I have never seen him before...lately at The Kardashian show...by his appearance I would think the opposite.. Apparences are deceptive🙄
Damn I love that guy! And his cars! He’s got the best f’n taste!!!
Another one of those Kardashian whipped guys!
Hearing him say ''I'm never here'' makes me think how celebrities and rich people can have all they want but only enjoy it a small amount of time and by periods of it, guess we can't have everything in life.
I cover one of his songs. He did some cool stuff. He seems much more easy going than his tattoos would indicate. All famous drummers are really cool. Don't know why. Something about drumming that make you more mellow.
Travis is so soft spoken.  Seems like a genuinely nice guy.
Whoa definitely one of my favourite celebrity house. His house matches his Ora …..dam what a humble man geeezzzz.
Some people only have taste in their mouth. Clearly.   Ever going to feature somebody who makes less than $40,000 a year? Because their stuff can't be considered beautiful right?
Such a good hearted guy!
Kourtney there are guests over, can you at least put some pants on 🙄 Travis seems like a nice calm guy. Didn't imagine his house would look that bland though but it's nice. I would renovate the pool to make it a lot bigger
i love travis. beautiful home
why dude talking like he trynna wisher in my ear lmao
I’ve watched quite a few AD home tours. This is one of my very favorites. The home is just beautiful and so serene. Travis is a wonderful tour guide and you can see how much the home means to him. I’m happy for them.
They are beyond cute together truly happiness!! The home is beyond beautiful i love how he haa his lollipops & candy in glass containers super adorable
What a lovely, serene, beautiful home, and same for the person. Travis seems like such a great guy! Stellar and genuine. Kourtney made the best choice. Blessings too them! 🦋🙌🏾✨🙌🏾🦋
His really all about family and his kids just like kourt
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸😊😊😊😊😊😊
His outside is so different from the inside
It's strange how we always whine and complain about rich people, yet we idolize the hell out of them and love their extravagance.
Beautiful!
Ghastly hideous and anemic
This guy is so cool ❤️
Awesome home,  y'all are meant to be with one another you guys have the same traits identical in every way just beautiful  wow.
Omg.
I love the way Travis speaks so calming
He looks like he has a serious illness or disease
I love his house! I can totally see why Kourtney & him are together…it’s a perfect match! Happy for them both 🥰
Oh he's vegan. I see
I love him
Beautiful home. Waldo did a great job executing Travis vision and making it very homey and cozy at the same time.
Awfully empty house.
when you look  at him totally different his personal taste ....He has classy elegant taste
Did anyone else look at their ceiling when he told the tarantula story ? Eeeeek!
2:38 I totally agree with you, people on people visiting. My home is a haven to me after I come from work or travel.
travis creeps me out. 100% serial killer vibes.
Okay Travis if you make the best Matcha hopefully we can see a product line dropping in our local Whole foods and Trader joe's soon!
He seems a very nice guy, beautiful house.
Wow- and seems a lovely guy
Why does Travis Baker look like he is about to die and a Kadashian is about to take half his wealth.
Looks great. Not overdone.
Aesthetic 💯
I can see a spin off for the Kardashians.  Here
Beautiful home, style.
I love the house! Let me add. It's so very nice to see Miss Kourtney smiling. I used to watch the reality show and I have never seen her smile as much as she smiles with Mr Travis. God bless you both. Travis also I love your drum skills!
I love the fact his house feel homie!
Vegan hot dogs. Vegan bed sheets. Stfu lol. Just kidding, beautiful space! I dig it.
I don't know why I expected his house to look like something out of The Addams Family but its actually calm and lovely.
The most emasculated transition of any future Kardashian victim to date…including Bruce
I always like travis for some reason besides being one of the best drummers I know of and I am so happy for him and Courtney.
I love the home. It reminds me of my sister's home. Love you, Kourtney but please stop sitting on the counter. Food goes there.😂😂😂 I'm sorry my OCD kicked in.😂😂 All love
I love how he say my home.
You!.. and Kourtney were MEANT FOR EACH OTHER.. GOD BLESS YOU! 🙏AMEN....😊😊
LOVEIT❤️‍🔥BEAUTIFUL 🏡❤️‍🔥
UPSETTING anyone would call this mess a master anything He's in because of her Period
I love Travis’s energy, so calm and chill. I felt like I was watching the modern day MTV cribs…
He’s very soft spoken.
How much zen is he gonna have with her gaggle of kids? Or is she going to SELL HER KIDS?
You are a Blessed man to come out of such a bad car crash!.... Amen ! 🙏, And Happy marriage to you and Kourtney... Congrats!!
I like this. This isn't filled with crazy opulent designer furniture, has lots of personal stuff and some flaws in it. Which can be called "home"
He’s so sweet! Did not expect that! What a catch! He sounds like someone who got a deep tissue massage 💆‍♀️
He’s very sentimental
please do Benedict Cumberbatch house!!
Beautiful house Travis.
He's really just a normal and genuine guy. He's also very sweet and is obviously so IN LOVE with Kourtney! I'm no actress or anyone famous but I believe it's rare to see a Hollywood couple that is genuinely so in love, you can see how they're both smitten with one another. I think they make an absolutely beautiful couple!😍🥰😍 God bless you both and your families❤💙
The house is very beautiful. Did anybody notice that the plant on their table changed?
I absolutely love these 2 together I swear kourt look so so happy she is the most laid back classy one for sure she so just human n thank you Travis for making her happy you are super fine yall both shine bright like a diamond 💎
Never judge a book by its cover
Beautiful, personal,  zen, nor just a gorgeous space, but a true home filled with love.
Could you imagine living a day in their lives??? I can't
Who knew he was refreshing normal. Love it
Pete Davidson's parents' house.
I wonder how much time it took to stage this.
i love travis
He is so sweet and soft spoken🖤
ostentatious
Wtf is this man wearing
I love the design and furnishings in your house.  What a beautiful place to call home and make memories in.😊
He needs to start eating real food not vegan hotdogs
Nice house, be careful about eating off the counter.
the most boring house
‘I actually make the best matcha’ was not a sentence I was expecting from Travis. Cool ✌️
Travis Barker sounds like a really intelligent artistic man....amazing brain and a lovely vibe coming off this guy!
This is the most I have heard Travis speak since I became a fan with the Take Off Your Pants and Jacket album. Thank you for opening your home and sharing your moments with us :)
“This is a Travis Barker production” ❤
This just goes to show dont judge a book by its cover. Man, Im so embarrassed that I never expected this man to be so tranquil and calm just based on his appearance.
Una de las mejores casas de famosos 👏🏼👏🏼
Ahh it’s so cute how he appreciates everyone’s gifts
wow amazing!!
I don’t like a lot of people in my home.  But, Travis said it so well…when family or friends are here, we make it count!  Beautiful home.  Minimalism is everything.
There's no way he wasn't on MTV Cribs. It'd be cool to compare the two videos haha
A beautiful couple❤️‍🔥deux âmes sœurs vous étiez fait pour vous rencontrer et bravo🎉🍾 pour la déco A.D de cette magnifique villa et à l’architecte d’intérieur love u guys kiss😘from Paris France🇫🇷
Just love this vibe!!!! Beautiful!! Never thought by looking at him his demeanor is like it is... He seems very humble and very easy to get attached to seems very laid back and chill!! Good vibes!!
They must be deleting the real comments - bro what are you wearing?!!!
Not my idea of a tattooed punk!
Ikea Vibe
I like home🙃
When he said"we like to spoil eachother" Me: cringe
Hey you got my car. Buick grand national. Awesome
He absolutely landed the baddest Kardashian.  Fight me if I'm wrong!!!
A dude who turns walls into windows and his name is… Waldo  Hope it’s spelled Wall-dow
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I know this is obviously about his home, but their synergy and compatibility makes me want to cry. It's so stinkin' cute. Like...are you kidding me?
I loveee this house, its so beautiful
Travis, Kourtney and their kids live in a really spacious, elegant and comfortable home.
Thanks for showing the world that you can be elegant and punk rock at the same time.
loved!!!!
Somebody get him a drink, he's thirsty.
Why????
He should make a tshirt wall and frame his tshirts
Oh there’s something about a man in black that makes want buy a Cadillac
Very mature but cool family dad vibe ❣️
He seems like such a sweet, easy going guy.
He sounds like the most gentle person ever. I see why Kourt can't get enough of him for all the calmness he oozes after the chaos she has been through.
he say gunna??
the candle next to his bed lmaoooo
This was 🔥
He’s been head over heels for Kourtney for awhile. He patiently waited for her. I bet he treats her like an absolute queen!
I love how “gentle” he seems and I feel like parts of that are reflected in his home, like it seems so peaceful
Kourtney is fine as F*ck!   But hope it all goes well for them they are so unique.
I love his aesthetic and home. Beautiful! can’t forget I’m Blink 182 #1 fan
Ok, so where does he REALLY live? Lol most celebrities never show a house they actively live in. This may be his house, but doubt he lives in it daily LOL
Today I'll be dressed as a goth condem.
Omg this was sooooo captivating to watch!!! Beautiful house, less is more, yesss!!!  I love the pool and I share a love for Cadillac with Travis!!! That Escalade is GORGEOUS💕😩 I'm jealous lol Kourtney forever awkward in front of cameras lol I love their relationship 🤍
Architectural Design know that thumbnails will make people watch, especially cause now they're newlywed! Good video as always AD!!!
I love how he has Sid vicious painting on his wall
beautiful home
I was really afraid hearing her talk to him, he was going to lay her back on that counter and just tear it up.
Pretty nice guy. Obviously a major genius even though I’ve no clue who he is. The amount of shoes is ridiculous, but then, Caruso was also a shoe freak…haha!
You can't really tell someone's taste by his looks. I love his house!
Beautiful home
He reminds me of the creepy dude from spice world movie
I kept looking for the AD standard bowl of citrus fruit....but I suppose a bowl of  ping pong balls will do.
Fire🔥.
I’m so proud of Travis and Kourtney for finally not making out when a camera is on them for once…
Was this the house that they straddled at?
Ah yes, cinnamon, nutmeg and cacao... None of which go into Matcha though ?! 😂🙄
Wow! I love everything about this home!
I love the house but the bed is heaven, I own one👌🏾
Kourtney and Travis are literally made for each other .
Gorgeous home! The energy of it feels peaceful!
I love his style. It’s very much him. Travis has been through so much in his life I am so glad that he is here today still!!
Stunning house. Kourtney on the counter top cracked me up lol
"My aesthetic is minimal"  hmm, have you looked in the mirror lately?
Delicious vegan food….good for them but….
Love how calm he talks and the way he talks about his kids 😌
He’s just so humble! He’s worked so hard, is one of the best drummers ever and deserves all great things!
that was a really cool video! kourt and trav are so cute
Anyone else catch the candle scent in the bedroom...?
What a surprisingly sweet and thoughtful man .  I loved how Kourtney had on full makeup, but is costumed to look like she just got out of bed . . .pajama top with no pants and a sexy pose. Hmmmm.
Beautiful house!!
He’s so chill and definitely a vibe. That home feels comfy and not overdone. The kids riding motor bikes through the halls 🤣 the best
Why is it that minimalism houses look like no one actually lives there? It reminds me of frigid stale art gallery.
Where's the bathroom I wanted to see the bathrooms mannnnnn
anybody peep the candle on his bedside table hahah
What happened to this dude? He used to wreck those drums and jam so hard, now he has a matcha station haha. Glad he's doing well though. Seems like he's found peace and tranquility and that's rad.
Beautiful remodel.   He seems very chill there.  Nice vibe.
AD keeping that MTV CRIBS vibe…
A gentle soul and all the good that goes with it. Congratulations to you and Kourtney. I wish you both happiness.
DID NO ONE ELSE NOTICE WHAT THE CANDLE SAID IN TRAVIS' ROOM 💀💀
The fact that they both speak in the same calm manner🥺
Minimalism and fireplaces…. I have way more in common with Travis than I had imagined.
Ok I got you likes fireplaces
Is this guy a real human or something?! What is it?!
Beautiful home 🏡
Beautiful Elegant peaceful
This is definitely the Kardashian-Jenner aesthetic… and from the synopsis his mother in law recommended the designer so I can see bits of the family and the future when the family y gathers three
BRUH WHAT A TARANTULA???
I like you! I adore the way you treat your family! ❤️
There so sweet together
is it a compliment to show someone a candle they got you three Christmases ago that you have not burned? the true test of the worth of hours of cooking is how fast it is eaten :-)
Totally thought the blonde daughter was his ex-wife at first.
His backyard is the best part so cool 😎
Is he VEGAN ?? 😅
I wish
Loved this! Would've liked to see the dogs, though...
The U.K. Has banned organic sofas and mattresses 🤔 you would think it was the other way around
I was always attracted to Travis, like since I was 10, I’m 27 now. But watching this video made me like 25 million times more attracted to him. Like, he shows that you can be super edgy, punk, grounded, and family oriented all that same time. Mucho más amor!
Never known much about Travis but this is in no way what I was expecting at all, absolutely one of my favourite tours
Wow - Travis's house is stunning. Super serene and artistically personal. The kitchen is gorgeous and the remodel of the curved windows and doors to the backyard is spectacular!
This house is giving minimalistic but elegant at the same time
The fact that he knows by memory where everyone sits, just shows how much he is present with his family.
Wouldn’t b a Travis Barker home without the punk paintings
Art of Bill Traylor - unexpected but great to see on his coffee table
This is a nice house. Those big doors and the fireplace 😍😍😍
He seems so different than he looks on the outside hope they last together
Funny, he likes clean minimal lines. But his body is jam-pack full of tattoos. Go figure.
Wow, who knew Travis Barker was literally the most calming person ever? Listening to him talk is so relaxing. Total ASMR.

Whoa… never judge a book by its cover… I’m old school.. don’t like tattoos.. but Travis is so laid back .. I can see a really cool man behind those tats.. 🥰
I love you Travis!   You are so freakin AWESOME...Love your VIBE!  Stay HAPPY!  All the best to you and Kourtney!
I need a Travis B in my life. Not even a rich one. He's just a sweetie and I love his soft voice.
Eeww he's cringe  I think of blink 182 and that he's all cool and funny and outgoing NOT HES A WEIRDO GURU HIPPY
He is so humble and sweetest. Foreverscorpio
What a lovely house!
I never thought negatively about Travis. I just had never heard him speak in depth. What a serene calming man. A plane crash will make you check your priorities.
D & S DURGA is amazing, so cool that he owns their stuff
He is not what I expected at all. Happy to be wrong. Seems like a wonderful person and what a home!
He’s a sweetheart. I love his taste.
Loving the zen rock star vibes
Not to judge him by his physical looks because he's really different when it comes to his taste for his house... I never expect him to have a minimal taste and very homey house.. i thought he likes loud and noisy looking house but I was amazed and this was one of the most beautiful houses I saw. Very relaxing peaceful calm and homey.. clean and minimalist looking..
I liked the Corona house much better.
A nice, small downsize house of 10,000 sq. ft. Ah. Nice home, love the ping pong table.
He's so calm and sounds like a little boy
Courtney, "busy with work" lol.
They are so cute together! He’s so gentle with her
He seems like a gentle soul and drawn to the zen vibe. Opposite to Scott and just what kourtney needs. His voice doesn’t match his appearance. Seems like a genuinely nice guy.
Reppin the enfants riches deprimes legggooooooo
Now we know where Kourt is getting the new look from...Travis' closet! They are cute!
Kourt keep your house cause Travis is not leaving you nothing all for his kids you be gone in a year Scott don’t worry she will be back she playing house with her neighbor
Love Travis and Kourtney together. House is beautiful.
Must be alot of money in sanitation, he even wears the suit home! Damn son! Is that leather garbage man suit vegan?
He has a calming effect when he speaks. He has a good soul.
I wish he did more interviews. Feel like people judge him so much without even bothering to get to know him.
Love this so chill
Okay I need him to do a voiceover for an audiobook or on headspace! His voice is so relaxing!
No one’s lives in that house he’s not letting the kids move in that’s a model house who clean it not his wife to clean for kids
You seem a genuine, gentle spirit of a guy. I love how you mentioned Kourtney so often in the dining room 😊
“Is Trav still looking for the gold Dior bike? Lebron never picked his up.”   Iconic
Ok kourtney we get it now🎉 rare to see even tho he’s a rockstar,he’s very family oriented,organized,well spoken….kudos kourt
Obsessed. I love Travis’ quiet and calm character. Had no idea. Seems like he would be an amazing spirit to hang around with.
Curious as to what parts of the home are more of Courtney's style and what her closet looks like. I have seen her closet in the past I'm just curious because I love her recent style change also would love to see the kids rooms.
Talk about a laid back cat! A bit different than attending a Blink concert at the Forum. Same guy different ambiance.
I c why Kourt loves him.👍
I can say in two words: Nice and simple💖
It looks very similar to Kourts
I need to try the matcha!!  i liked that this house was a good blend between clean / zen meets color
He is talking like Kourtney, isnt he? I think all the stuff in the beautiful home is Kourtneys idea, I guess.
His vibe is so kind and nice. Love it for him and Kourtney
I think we’ve all fallen in love with Travis now. Such a gentle soul, and then boom, his music kicks in. Kourt is winning! ❤️
I feel bad I judged him off of his appearance and he's an absolutely lovely person. Lesson learned.
this man really asked what movie had an x in it
Stunning home!
Beautiful home
I've always loved this young man, & I'm glad Kourtney has him!❤️🙏🏼
love his house
He values her behavior msybe bc ther old
I love how Kort is just casually sitting on the kitchen counter...too cute...I hope they last🥰
why does penelope look like travis than scot :o
I see how they ended up together I love his house especially the closest and car collection
"we", "our" 🤍
Love it! Classic and peaceful home! 😍👏
I love this man beautiful house beautiful family.
I love that he is vegan! A truly compassionate man!🌱❤️🌎
Eewwwwww his house us classic American tacky
first time anyone snatched anything from lebron i think, at least of record.  ;-)
I usually hate celebs home bc they’re so bland and cold, but this home is beautiful, feeling like a home, and love the way he speaks of it!!!
Like his style better than Kourtney’s.
Nice, I hope Kourtney doesn’t try to change everything and just relax
i feel like this is the perfect way to be minimal, a clean and organized space but cozy and not cold, and you know it’s been lived in very well. this is such a beautiful home and the way he connects everything to family is so sweet
Looks like a trashman jump suit.
I really like his voice! Wow. So happy for him and Kourtney!!
All that money and the house has no personality at all. Very ordinary like the two of them.
this house is actually super homie and comfy looking house. its definitely not like a super modern house that looks like a 2070 space ship looking house. travis got some really good taste in house interiors.
Like
I use to live videos like these but living in poverty because I can’t even afford one vehicle to get myself out and seeing cars and homes like this I get so bitter.
It's a shame Kourtney wasted so much time with Scott. Travis just has a great vibe
Loveeee a t- shirt closet
Why is he sounding like Kourtney
Omg, he is gross!
1:38 why is he sticking his middle finger at us?
The main attraction start at 3:56
Love Travis! Beautiful home!!! (ALSO, this is the most I ever listen to him speak lol)
He needs to change
HE SAID "is travis still looking for that Dior bike? LEBRON never picked his up. It's yours today!" SO CASUALLY LMAO
I just gotta know what kourtney was doing on that laptop
I bet it's not often these days Kendall gets introduced as "Kendall, Kourtney's sister" haha. Love Travis 😃
This is so kardashian.
Lovely home! Clean, neat, and tidy.💐🥂🏡❤🌞
He Sounds Like a Kardashian fr😂
Did anyone notice the plant change at the dinner table?
I love when people who make it are j ust really down-to-earth and act like everybody else not like they're big snob
Homie is a G. Didn’t he survive a plane crash? Love this house mann
It's amazing how if we are brave enough to let go of toxic people who bring us pain and disappointment the right people immediately enter our lives and love us to death. the best thing about this house is the love that lights it up. I'm so happy with Kourtney💖💗
The Cullinan Rolls Royce, I think comes from my family name... I could be wrong but it's my Mother's maiden name and it was her great great Uncle that gifted the Queen with the Cullinan diamond :) I could be wrong on how many great Uncles that was but... :)
Trav sound like a battered house wife
Love how he has been in that house for a long time and every room has a memory for him.
Please get Khloe and Kris on here!!!!! I need to see their houses😫
Simplicity, calm, minimalism and comfort. Love it!!❤
I'm sure people watch this because of Kourtney but I had no idea that was her. I just wondered who he was because of a house like that and those tats?? Still don't who he is and don't care.
I miss MTV cribs lol
Any tips on how to make the best matcha?
He is so in 😍 love 💘 hurray for him!!!!!
Not real familiar with Travis since back in the day.  He seems real down to earth and a great dad.  His home is beautiful.  The home seem like it is meant for family.
This is easily one of the best videos. A gorgeous home, he described things so incredibly well and you can just tell, that home is LOVED💛
“It also vibrates.” 😂 I’m outta here, this was so unexpected but expected? Cool dude, cool house.
Wondering how he would look as he get older or gets ill, because he looks gaunt...maybe now he is married he might get a dietician to fix him some meal to make him look healthy.
Do not let her take your money. The whole family are gold diggers.
Interesting
Travis sounds like Brad Hall here :D
Wow! I love his taste in decoration. I never would have guessed that his house looks like this based on his fashion choices. Superb! 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼 He seems like a nice guy!
I love Travis 🙌🏼🥹 he’s just such a chill laid back , humble individual and him and kourt are made for each other . Beautiful family and beautiful home . Love this!
I've lost count of how many times he says "like".
You are so chill I never knew that much about you but it seems like you are such a mellow and cool guy at the same time
I see why she likes him. HIS SPIRIT IS VERY CALMING
i would love a home like this.
Wtf is he wearing
I’m shocked. He’s lovely. Intelligent, articulate, healthy partner and father.  What a shock - a kardashian woman finally scores a decent human being and man.  Well done KK.
Travis seems  like an awesome guy. He seems so down to earth.
Travis barker is a vibe.
cool house
Dang 600,000 views in 9 hrs pretty cool and the way him and kourt look at each other alot of sexual tension holy moly
So chill and zen, love his vibe, love him and kourt together. God bless their union and family
I can't express how much i love this!!! Great choice A.D. & thank you Travis!!! xoPam, still Kelli's mom
They’re perfect together… I wish them a long, and happy marriage… Full of peace, and love…
Very Nice
CHEAP, COPY OTHERS IDEAS AND HAVE NO DECENCY AT ALL LIKE THE REST.   UGLY INSIDE OUT ALL OF THEM MENTAL CRAZY PEOPLE WHO HAVE ZERO TALENT AND ARE NON CELEBRITIES BUT CHEAP LOW CLASS VULGAR PEOPLE WHO PAY TO BE POSTED AND PROMOTE PROSTITUTION. UGH.  GROSS SOCIETY OF TODAY ALL SICK  the stupidity of humanity and the lack of morality and values is huge.  You idiotic media promotes garbage, non celebrities. mental sickos with zero talent.  gross all of them and all of your promoting sicko and prostitution.  all they offer is garbage all of them. from sicko mother to sicko father and all added ones. sick
Are their no bugs in there? How can they keep the doors open all the time?
This is my first time listening to him. First impressions: He sounds nothing like he looks.
This home is so beautiful and just perfect.  It's opposite what I expected . Design and everything is perfect my dream home.
Not that I know the guy. But he is a lot different than his blink182 days. Guess we all change.
Let me start by saying that I love this house and I like this dude generally..but anyone else find this whole thing obnoxious?  The name dropping and the matcha. And yes, I am being a hater.
The simplicity of this house is just mind blowing!!!
Love the house!
He is the perfect example to jot judge people from their look. He's really calm, l like the sound of his voice, which is warm, clear. At first sight he is seems a punk guy, someone who wants always get in troubles but actually he's really quite and handsome man. He's elegant and smart. Love him
Such a nice person.
Calm vibes only
What a beautiful person! His energy is so calm and positive! Good for you Kourt, you chose a right guy!
This house was done well! It felt like an actual home
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Excuse me for being slightly stoopid - doesn't all that ink, especially on the scalp - have the potential of causing lead poisoning?
I love that's he's so chill, always liked him.
what is he wearing? a boiler suit? 😆
Is this the vogue edition of mtv cribs 😂😂
why is he wearing a bin bag
If this is just under 10,000 sq ft and is perfect I can’t imagine how big the 3 story house is! But man Travis and kourtney really are perfect for each other. I remember seeing him on keeping up many seasons ago and thinking they’d be cute together!
Straight from the Loire Valley, limewash and natural light. A very elegant take on how the rich live.
Love the plants! 🌱🌿 Plant styling for the minimalist, very nice.
Love that his house seems very well built and elegant but comfortable and cozy at the same time.   For sure he seems to actually enjoy every room in the house plus the pool -garden.  One of my favorite tours, all the others you can usually tell some of the rooms are just for show.  His house is a functional luxury :)
Beautiful
100 speakers??  Hmm...  Edit: miss my Cadillac, ngl.  What a simple, classy layout. And I appreciate his chill...
NO WAY I LOVE THEMMMMM!!!
I love how sentimental he is, and I love the vibe of his home.  Chef’s kiss!
I've crushed him since I can remember. The reason I'm covered in ink. His vibe, style, etc is my jam! Kourtney is lucky. They seem so good together ❤️
2Kings 20 Hezekiah brought destruction on his empire showing his property to people.  Hurry and repent in Jesus Name.  Stop following false prophets Isaiah 31:2.
One Love Travis Barker!
He seems so kind!!
This house is so beautiful it's cozy and classy and is such a vibe to just relax and live in luxury.
Love it, just the right touch of masculinity and luxury without feeling like cold mausoleum, it still feels like a family lives there.  They currently live my dream lifestyle. Money/ luxury completely aside. being able to have that togetherness but separate at the same time, with their individual homes spending time together probably feels like a festive getaway every time.   If I was them I wouldn’t focus so much on building a home together.  This is great lol.
Seems amazing.
Gave me the best candle idea for my bf
The funniest thing Kourtney works🤣
I like his style, unfortunately, his house is bland!
Being Travis Barker's child must be Fun, 🗣️say dad can we ride quads through the house~ Go for it💯
He is very admirable,  Kourtney hit the jackpot 🤍🤍
He is rich Rich 🔥🔥🔥🔥
His energy, like his home, is clean, calm and inviting. He seems really cool
“This smells like Kourtney’s orgasm” on his candle🫣
What a beautiful heart ♥ I see it now... ♥
He’s a Scorpio like me so we have very similar tastes. I like zen, chilling and not bright colors or anything too feminine. I much prefer the ‘masculine’ or subtle colors. Keeps me calm and happy. I like very clean and simple designs.
Travis is a good man and seems like a very cool person He has a soothing energy. The house is obviously incredibly expensive yet approachable, calm, and comfortable!
How many "likes" said by him? 😂 Awesome tour, love!
He seems like he has many great qualities. I understand why Kourtney loves him.
Anyone else see the 'This smells like Kourtney's orgasm' perfume?
I thought how he described where everyone sits was so cute. Because I just feel a lot of authenticity from the Kardashians is (JUST A BIT) put on and  all about the glamor and value.. some of us who've watched them for 10+ years watched Lamar , Scott and how tumultuous those relationships were. Travis really warmed my heart . Haven't seen much of him yet. He's so calm and exactly what Kourtney needs.  I wish them the best!
I am old and have only seen pictures of this man with Kortney. I really like his speaking voice, so calm and personable. He gave a wonderful tour of his beautiful home which is sophisticated, calming, tasteful and housing his favourite and appreciated personal belongings. They seem to be both unique in their thoughts and very compatible. May they always respect ,take care of one another .
You deserve this happiness and Love Kourtney from a awesome 😎 Man !’
Seems like a really cool guy/father.
I can’t believe he’s been living in that house for 16 years. That’s not something you heard in the celebrity world
Congratulations guys love you as a couple ❤️❤️❤️
Ugh I love Travis! Kourtney you are a lucky woman 😘
VeGaN oRgAnIC 🙄
knowing me i would buy an RV, put it in the back yard and live in it and use the house as my prepping storage
Did anyone notice the plant was changed on the dinner table??? While he is talking about having tea and dinner lol
Travis has a very calm vibe
What a very sweet guy. Loved the house and the tour. Thank you.
Not what I expected. It's nice Travis.
His house is so cool can’t wait to be friends w him 🙂
dear kourtnery and travis, can you guys adopt me
I like the seating in his movie theatre. It's more cozy rather than separate stadium seats. Very nice home!
Damn imagine how much his house is worth now if he's held on to it for 16 years? He's probably made at least 10 mil on it. That's smart. Damn can you imagine what their combined net worth is? Jesus Christ. I mean, that is some life.
love his home & him. also, this jumpsuit is so dope
Yo are we all gonna skip over the candle @ 10:30 that says it's the smell of Kourtneys orgasm?
16 years in a house says a lot about him as a person. Celebrities usually move what seems like every 3 years
Hefty trash bag vibes
Beautiful home. Definitely matches his light energy🤍
You can tell by the calmness of his voice how tranquil his spirit is. There is so much love there! Thank you for sharing
Surprisingly a nice guy. (I have been so put off by his PDA tongue swapping.) A cool home.
Travis is such a vibe. I see why he chose the Kard that isn’t into the lifestyle.
Thanks Travis for opening up your home and giving us a wonderful tour. I love the stories behind each room and I can see how meaningful they are to you. Your home is beautiful and very zen.
This is probably the most comfortable and normal looking celebrity home I’ve ever seen
he really likes the word "like"
Travis sounds so “valley”, didn’t expect that 😂
Hey, if you didn’t know ….God loves you!!! He loves you sooo much💕! He wants to the best for you and wants to give you life more abundantly. Give him a try, turn to him! Get to know God and create a relationship with him. Remember he sent his son Jesus to die on the cross for your sins❤️! If you confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord and believe that Jesus died on the cross and God rose him from the dead on the third day you will receive the gift of salvation.
I really like Travis Barker. Kourtney and him make a perfect match. He's calm and know what he wants. Great addition to the Kardashian.  Scott was a BIG joke!! He's TRASH!
Lebron never came and picked his up 😶…
I love his house, is so peacefull, so calm perfect for just resting
Interiors straight out of Ikea catalogs...
Best tour ever.  Love this guy.
12:29 Vegans Rule!
beautiful home full of memories!!! what a nice, smart guy!! I only knew of him thru Kardashians, but, was always taken aback by the tats.  well, big lesson for me today.  do not judge a book by its cover!!
He is like soo humble... Calm and cool
What a nice guy.
Oh my God he's so inlove
Love it!
Like
Same as his vocabulary,  house is very repetitive
I'm happy that he got his 2nd chance at life and is enjoying it with love. And family and doing what he loves.
Hi
The candle at 10:34 👀 lol Kourtney is a great gift giver apparently
7:26 It's pronouced p-EH-t-ih-b-oh-n like bon-bons not bone 😛
I remembered when his house was different, when did he change it?
Dr. Dre, Prince, Operation Ivy, Pink Floyd and which is the fifth?
Home has nothing to do with his creepy look
okay travis literally has the best taste with interior design. The perfect combo of minimalism, comfy, and zen mixed with artsy elements. His lifestyle is so zen. I can definitely see him being the best fit for Kourtney. I mean you can tell this man is passionate and kind with how he is. You can tell he's the best father and partner. Love to see it.
He seems like such a nice guy and good dad and for some reason I’m a big fan of him and kourtney together.
Anyone love how the entire time he says “our” it’s never about him. I love that. ❤️
Never thought that MTV Cribs would age that well.
I can't take anyone who dates a Kardasian seriously.
boring house
my favorite AD yet❤
Why does his voice go up at the end of each sentence like he is asking a question?
Murder it out🤣🤣🤣
How can someone so intelligent have such horrific tattoos
Rolls Royce never going out of style
I saw the reality show The Barkers and I knew he would be a great guy to Kourtney.  You can tell he is a great guy. Team Travis 🤗
Wow loved his home.  Minimal, simple and comfy. He has good taste.
Doing homework outside that's a good idea!!!!!! 💡
Travis seems like such a great guy, very humble and sweet ❤
when he said long before we were together we would spoil each other I MELTED
Beautiful home everything is so gorgeous
He's Perfect for her...❤
He's gotta be the coolest guy
That's allot black in one closet
Wow he seems like he's perfect for her
He seems calm and chill didn't expect that, I see why she married him.
2:23 Is that a Paul Insect sculpture?  His art taste is top notch!
What a beautiful home.
hoesntly i dont watch TB a lot, but watching his home and describing where he sits, where his family sits, the table they use more often, if anything that makes the space seem more comfortable and relatable. Even though he says he travels a lot, it actually seems like he lives in his house and enjoys it. I feel like even though celebrities have amazing homes with amazing decor/design.. it feels like, "do they actually even live here". His home reminds me of Kourts design taste, but I can def see travis' taste incorporated in as well. Love it
Was expecting rocky style . Looks cozy and comfort
He's way talented!!!
He's music genius🤯🤗😎
He comes off as someone with a good heart and that he cares about his family a lot evening taking the time to eat dinner with them every sunday. This is a good man and im glad he is doing good
i find it funny you're vegan but you're wearing PU leather which is intended to imitate leather. murder by lifestyle signals.
The interior actually feels like a home
Awe...She is so in love
I love how he actually lived in this house for a good part of his life. He can really call it home. Unlike other celebrities they move from one house to another.
Cribs had an upgrade 😆
Love the ping pong table.
The sweetest guy ever.  Love him ❤
Travis seems so genuine, amazing father and has a heart of gold. I can see why Kourt loves  him!
Money. Whew
I pray that they have a long, uninterrupted love and life together. He reminds me of Kourtney but feels like he balances her where she is lacking. I would love to have been the architect on this project. Gorgeous
No color what doesn't anyone like color anymore😭😭😭😭😭
Awwwww I'm so happy for them both!
“This smells like Kourtney’s orgasm”
his home actually feels so normal
Hes such a calm guy
That's crazy how Kim and Kanye broke up then Kourtney and Travis took over😎
They should do a cooking show
travis has such a beautiful. home and i just love his peaceful energy !!!
Trav living clean with the fresh pad. I like the low-key aesthetics.
Beautiful home
#BESTTRVSMTHFCKINBRKR
What a chill dude
He talks so calm and collected
I live hearing him talk about his family, shows that the house is full of love
This home is beautiful! So calming and serene. Minimal, but definitely not boring. I love it
I don’t know what it is but, I love seeing them together…..
I know why Kourt loves him he is so normal and articulate coolest famous person seriously she is so lucky
I know Scott scared of Travis 🤣
kendoll
I never heard him talk I didn't think he would be such a good speaker
I like this fella even more.
Nice guy. Just learning about him.
Travis really seems to care for Kourtney K! She is the sister who is the most like the rest of us and I Hope her marriage lasts..
How refreshing not seeing white furniture or off white! Although natural tones and that white kitchen are a tad overdone as well lol
I love how Kourtney is just chillin in the kitchen like she just woke up, yet she's in full makeup. lol
Beautiful home! Who knew you were so down to earth! Much success to you! 🙌
I love how Kourt’s just casually hanging out on the counter lol 😂
my, my, my, my, my, my is all I heard. Barely and our or we.
Wow
His voice is an entire meme lol
Take a shot anytime he says ‘Kourt’
He is so calming!
What a boring and uninspiring house, wow.
SICKKKKKK! WE’VE BEEN A FAN OF TRAVIS! SO HAPPY HE & KOURT ARE TOGETHER NOW! PERFECT 🤍🤍🤍🤍🤍
I'm here bc vegan biased and supportive of people spreading the word on compassion and not on supremacy.
Need more plants
Very nice home. Trav has great style.
Chump status lol
NICE BOAT BARRY LOL
Beautiful home!
So no one noticed the candle on this night stand? 👀  haha absolutely love this couple! ❤️
This video is giving real MTV Cribs vibes
I'd be curious to know what the five albums are in the painting! That's a very thoughtful and sweet gift.
Too clean and staid like a museum I hope she brings colour to it.
It looks like my dream home. A studio, a place to watch movies and a vibrating bed lol
You know you’re rich when you buy a 55 gallon lawn and leaf bag for an outfit.
Weirdo
Beautiful
Omg the kitchene and the backyard is just wow. I mean indeed dont judge a book by its cover.
Beautiful Home😇
All great except that jumpsuit. Distracting
I love everything about this house, including his soothing voice.
Kourtney sounds so much like Kim
He is worth 50 million dollars and I still wouldn't touch him with a barge pole.  Those tats terrify me LOL. Good on you Kourtney.
He framed the drawing from Penelope so sweet great step dad
beautiful!
Travis is just a beautiful soul he can't do anything wrong 💞💞 beautiful home!
Nice of the plumber to give the house tour while travis is away,  what a great guy
I really enjoyed this
Gorgeous home.. Travis is so chill, namaste.
I love what he said about how he doesn’t like having too many people at home to entertain because it’s his peace of mind. Some of us who grew up with big families (and extended families) had that tradition of having people over at the house but the older I get, I want home to be my escape and peace of mind, as he said. Covid really cemented that in me and now if we do have people over, it would have to be a small number. Not a place to host big events.
You know.. I never really watched the KUWTK show but I will say I would follow Kourtneys designs after her AD spread… I must say, I love these two together… isn’t it sumthin how you can have kids with someone you love but you end up marrying your soulmate .. Mannnn.. God knows what he’s doing…🙏🏾
Such a beautiful home, it’s so light and open, more like a relaxation retreat. Having so much space must be insanely good for a ruminating mind.
Wow beautiful 😍 home Travis and congrats 👏 on you and Kourt getting married if you see this message 🤣. I never realized how zen Tavis is he is just so chill and relaxed 😌
Tb to his mtv cribs tour!
I"m not gonna lie i wasn't expecting much but this was probably one of the most pleasant architectural digest episodes i've watched. He's seems so sweet and down to earth! 15 minutes went by too quick yo!
I thought he was about to say so this is my beat laboratory lol for his drum room
Can wait for someone that build in the sims to see this video, a make the house lol
This is a lovely home for a lovely, mellow fellow and his family.
I love how he keeps mentioning Kourtney  , They where definitely made for each other , Congratulations  , Continued blessings and  joy.
Beautiful home
Finally a real home.
I can’t believe he survived a burning plane crash and to this day, remains incredibly humble and good natured man. I love how he fondly speaks about his children and exudes this cool hip dad vibes. A man of many talents and humility. He went from rock bottom to being in a very good place. He has such classy immaculate taste of his beautiful home. Jesus has blessed him!
Wow he’s such a teddy bear 🧸
okay what a cool guy
Like his kitchen and he seems grounded, for a celebrity.
Such a beautiful, cozy, minimal home 🤍
Only thing i would change... make the pool 10 times bigger.
I'd like to see what *his* style is...  this is designed and created by a paid designer, with little touches of his own stuff dotted carefully and professionally about, so although he enjoys it and likes it, it's not really 'his'. It's like going to a posh hotel, you might love it there but it's style isn't your style it was created by someone else and to be honest, this does feel very much designed and arranged rather than organically grown from it's owners personality. I'd rather see a home that's a reflection of its owner, not a paid designer.
The cars have less miles than the old lady.
Homies vibe is so outta this world 🙏🏼🔥 Truly blessed
Kourtney clearly makes that house a home...
so good to see this.
This is a really calm and cool looking house. Very quiet and modern.
"This room is so zen. I like to do a lot of phone calls in here and photoshoots". Makes no sense.
I love this man hardy! So nice and calmy. I really like him.
Wtf happened to him lol went full hollywood on us
wow this part is amazing!
What a wonderful vibe, great home for the blended fam! What a cool experience to see inside Trav's home studio too!!
He’s softer than I would have thought.
The guy needs a sandwich, he looks sick.
I could listen to him talk all day. So soothing 😊.
What a cool down to earth dude
The candle smells like what 🙂
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This is what I want to live like
That painting Kourtney got for him is awesome. I would love that
👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼😁 she is so beautiful inside and out miss lady👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
10:36 the candle lol. Dead hahahaha
beautiful house!!!!
Wait… what… mattresses are toxic?!   I remember seeing Blink at the Garage in London in the 90s , I also remember on their dvd Travis talking about his clothing business he was starting, years go by, I still love Blink, I’m an interiors photographer so I sub to AD this comes up I watch no knowing what to expect but happy to catch up. I really enjoyed this I love his vibe as a person, and I feel he lives a good soulful life I’m just really happy to see him doing so well.
He has the sweetest voice 🥰
one floor houses are the best. i can imagine why would ppl want to run up and down on a daily basis :D
Hilarious how people think he's one of the best drummers in the world... 🤣🤣🤣 doesn't even make top 1,000 living.
Love, love, love!!😍
Yes, the house is great! Here’s a little side note: we have been hearing a lot about how kind he is, thoughtful, supportive and really into clean living. With the house we get a better idea about how tranquil, minimal and family oriented he wants it to be, down to the tone of his voice! It’s almost like he’s whispering. Especially when he talked to Kourtney! It made me realize that every time I’ve seen him on tv since they started dating he kept the exact same tone. At some point don’t you need to shake things up a little bit?!
Absolutely amazing home!
dude looks like kreacher/dobby from Harry Potter or is that just me? Dude at least has some house elfs keeping that house clean.
Kourtney, I understand
Neat! I knew I recognized him. Lol
Dope
Incredible, one of my favorite houses if not my favorite one from all the Ad’s tours  😍😍😍. Practical, elegant, modern and all the rooms and beautifully put together, I love it!
He ,LOOKS like a freak/ ghoul.
Please start including the designers in these videos more!!
Him and kourtney really do match
I think his fiance  design  his house for him. Don't let this lady change you dude
Amazing 💑couple ,  beautiful home . I love that all the children are so happy 😊 too!!! That's the best . You can just feel how happy they are 🖤
Don't let the girl family drive you crazy
"Stick your head in and look left--- there's the hallway with 2 beds, 1 bath, look to your right n thats the kitchen, and the master bed/bath is just beyond the refrigerator."  MTV cribs in the South.
Absofuckinglutely
Kartrashians, the armenian witches of hollweird, lets see how travis barker turns out after this relationship!
Why am I smiling through this video like a idiot lol
I absolutely loved this!
This home is flawless , I do love it
Like Kortney I always get my laptop and check emails on countertop in the kitchen
So jealous of kourtneys turn around in life hopefully thatll be me one day
The Kardashian bug has got him
how much Courtney works 🤣🤣🤣
I’m very happy for you & Kourtney!  That is all that matters!
Why does Travis sound like a Kardashian?
Hi,  I love the decoration of your house.  Just one question:  Do you have windowsills (inside) or did you leave the windowsill plastered like the walls?
He is so chill... I see why they love each other ♥️♥️♥️♥️🥂🍾
This is what happens when you meet someone that truly matches your energy and values. Happy for both of them. Kourtney feels safe in the relationship. No pretending or drama. Just authenticity.
T:  "Hey Kourtney, AD is coming over to film the house!" K:  "Ok, I'll wear your pajama top."
It's annoying that this great showcase was ruined by Kourtney.   And Kourtney is the only one I kinda like.  Them Kardashians will never let anyone outshine them, never.
What a beautiful home 🔥
I love his kitchen, totally biting his style on the tea station
"Is Travis still looking for the gold Dior bike? LeBron never picked his up..."  Times, they are a-changing, lol. I wonder what's under the blurred effect. Some art he shows us & discusses, while others are blurred. I did enjoy the sentimental touches he shares with us, which reveals a bit more of who he is at heart.
He has such a calming voice
I love this house!
He's so soft spoken I find it calming. Someone get him to do an audiobook. Also, love the house, but I'm assuming they're selling that now so they can move into a house together.
That bike is 25k 😩 *cries in poor*
He is so down to earth and calming
This was very different than I thought .......so calm and peaceful..................Donna in Toronto
Been waiting for this
I am pleasantly surprised how non-Rock Star is this home! Yes, not a house but a home. I love hearing the way he speaks also.
What a genuine chill guy. Glad I watched this
He bought the house in 2006  cool that hes still there.    We all have our own spots at our  table too .
He sounds very different to how I would have expected!
Summer swimming??? It’s LA. They can swim almost anytime. Lol
This is a home not a house. Very beautiful and you can tell it’s really lived in. I really love these two together! Wishing them all the best! ❤️
Wow that Buick is badass😋
Woauw i'm very surprised his home felt like a warm, nice, normal home, he has taste for sure
OK I get it now. I see why she is in love with him. He seems incredible. His aura is beautiful.
Meetings are all family you know S.
Who?
Wow!
I loved how he talked about the seating for the dinning table. You can tell by the way he talked he enjoys being together for family dinners.
Give him food...💀
uhm am I going crazy or did the pillow move forward at 11:57 😳?!
AD is the mature and sophisticated version of MTV Cribs 😂
Beautiful home!  Much respect for Travis for being a family man!
He's the male version of Kourtney.
Very neutral, simple, classic. That kitchen is ultra zen.
Beautiful  home, sleek, clean and so calm. Tavis has the most calming voice, love listening to him...
i actually really love the thoroughness
Wow, I love how calm and down-to-earth he is. Also, he would be a superb asmrtist! ☺️
at 10:28, the candle " this smells like kourtney's orgasm" cracks me up =)) he seems such a chill and nice guy. Lucky her.
Lol he's so fake
I was very surprised by the decor.  The house is absolutely beautiful.  What I like is, along with the decor everything just seems so obtainable. Not so “Hollywood”. Good job TB!
Why does he look like he just left the slammer.
You have the most genuine peaceful vibe.  I'm  so happy for you and Khortney truly beautiful
How could someone so absolutely hideous have such a nice looking home?
#callfordonation Hi good madam/sir, I am knocking at your kind heart.

Any amount.   account number  4162 9501 5946 5642  Union Bank of the Philippines
He’s such a soft and gentle soul. You can tell with his energy. And I’m ecstatic for Kourtney, she deserves the kind of love she found with him.
"The gold Dior bike" rich people 😭😭🤣🤣
Wow. What a house my God. Beautiful!
What a sweet guy! He has such a big heart! I love the way he and his fiancé love each other and so neat that they have family meals together on Sunday without phones.  You can see that he loves her (and she loves him) by the way they kissed and how he rubbed her leg affectionately afterwards. Just very tender and heart felt.  What a beautiful house! Love the aesthetics and the space without a lot of things.  Love the Zen aspect and the black and white. Love the art work!  So cool to see art with Sid Vicious!   You can really see he has such a big heart! What a sweetie!  So glad he survived the tragic plane crash a while ago.  What a beautiful and loving person. So neat to see how he loves his and her kiddos! 😊😊💖💖💖💖 Good Papa there! And he’s Vegan! So cool!! 😊😊💚💚🌱🌱🌱🌱💚💚💚
Travis is chill af. I appreciate the minimalist aspects of living. I enjoy everything down to the small & suble details. A1
That buick is sickkkkkk
Inside a persons home
I love his house and his collection of black cars! He just seems so genuine and chill, overall great guy!
This has to be one of my favorite celeb homes. I love that he remodeled the home his kids grew up in; he kept it minimal, modern, and true to his vibe. Love it!!
I can see why Kourtney is so attracted to him. He is so sweet. Who woulda thought! And then to see his home, so understated yet elegant while not being too precious about stuff but cherishing the things that are important. I think I’m a fan.
and suddenly Kourtney is in his kitchen in pajamas, with her laptop "working" ... what a coincidence!? lol
What is it about Travis barker that makes him sound and act so normal and calm?
Yess!!! Thank you Travis for reminding people that beds are toxic especially if it has fiberglass.  Always make sure what your bed is made of.
His and Kourtneys homes are very alike actually! And she somehow came off as awkward or camera shy despite it all..
Very comfy
wow
Did kourtney straddle Travis while you were there?
I'm betting all that stuff doesn't make him happy... Wait and see.
There is something so calming and peaceful about his house.
I love his Personality very real sharing his life
This is really truth of you can judge a book if covers, cause you look at Travis and think mmm all those tattoos and works as a drummer, he must be hard core and mad and heavy and just wild. And every time I listen to Travis voice he is so calming, and the fact he is so not what people would assume. Just think he is so cool, calming and I could listen to his voice allllll day, and he is pretty awesome as an artist as well xx
u are very good i like thats assome 😛😋😋
The fact that he is now looking for houses with Kourney makes me so sad for this house, this house has so much personality and style!!!!
Adding this to my list of fave AD house tours. I love how truly calming and clean this design is, without feeling cold or looking like a monastery. And all one level!
Dang, he’s pretty chill
His house  is stunning 😍
All that's missing is welcome to my Cribb..
Alabama and her father are literal twins 🥰🥰🥰
A really beautiful home ❤️
Love the house!
Kris Jenner up to her sual bag of tricks-be careful Travis
Organic mattress
We get it, is YOUR house.
such a simple n lovely house 🏡 unlike d kardashians thy are complete show off…
He’s obviously got true style and taste and also Kourtney has said she loves interior decorating…what a match made in heaven. His house is so cool.
I'm surprised he lived there for 16 years, really meant he loves the place and just upgraded them to modern minimalist look
So I wonder when they move is he letting Khort decorate because she loves it like a passion..I ❤️ it to
Where do they worship Satan though?
Why can't u just say food instead of "vegan" food. I'm all in for being a vegan but that is what ppl get so annoyed about the vegan lifestyle
Beautiful home!!
Never heard of Travis, but a very cool guy…never judge a book by the cover… But as to the designer…well….Does a phenomenal job by being IKEA bland
It's not over the top posh but I love how it contradicts his image....
“What’s that movie with the X, & huge party” 😂😂. This might just be me, but Travis looks like he’s always about to cry lol
Incredible home. It's big yet warm and relaxing.
He has to be the most calming man on earth
What a sweetheart. I loved this so much.
5:05 - 5:22 Love how the flowers in the vase suddenly vanish and bloom...
What a super nice down to earth guy.  He truly loves Kourtney! Congratulations you two!
Damn, Travis is really chill. Has he always been this laid back?
as a heavily tatted punk, i'm glad travis is showing people that we aren't all big, scary, crazy party people! most of us wear our craziness on the outside so we can stay calm and cool on the inside 😌i was lucky to meet travis a few years ago and he's just as sweet and humble as he seems on camera! love this house.
I love his voice. It's so calming.
One of the nicest houses I have ever seen
If he says vegan or matcha one more time…but I totally love the crib!
Super impressed.. I would've never imagined his space to look this way... But your home says who you are. I so relate to things being in their place and things being clean so u can think... Super dope house and vibe.
Why there's no Blink 182 picture anywhere..Travis??.
Love ittt ..its cosy and homely lived in xxx
His ex-wife was very pretty. Too bad didnt work out.
Guys wearing silk nighties are such turn off.
Dopeness
This looks lifeless as hell LMAO
So beautiful! You can tell he really appreciates the special moments made in his home more than just how luxurious it is
I think she the only one who doesn’t like the purple dingaling
Absolutely enjoyed this.  I love the home but hearing Travis speak and describe his family and Kourtney was the best part.
I truly enjoyed this!
Travis is such a calm person, I love him for Kourtney, his nice 😌💗
one of my favorite AD episodes...
It's crazy how 90s is vintage now. lul
Well damnit now I need a matcha bar too 💚
This house like Travis is real it looks lived in comfortable not like a museum and you're scared to touch anything or sit anywhere
His main instrument is drums? Wow i'm surprised I never knew that about him.
I love the house and I love his energy.  You can see how much he has grown and I wish him and Kourt the very best!!
Lebron James didn't want the gold dior bmx? i'm surprised.
Seems like most of the people/us really judged and assumed Travis to be completely different person. They assumed him to be loud, carefree, whatever type of guy and also messy, little dirty kind of person at home. But when they found him to be respectful, soft spoken, little introvert, kind, nice, humble, well spoken, a gentle man and found his home to be clean, perfect, well managed, people seem to get pleasantly surprised and shocked, lol. One person is saying that he knows his house is usually not like this, He made it clean just for the show, as if he knows Travis personally. It's so funny to read people's perception and judgment. We can be really judgemental and sometimes our judgment and perception can be completely wrong. Travis is for real a real respectful and true gentleman. God bless him and his family. All the best wishes. His house is beautiful💖
I loveTravis, but he's looking a bit malnourished
I am so sorry hes the sweetest guy ever but DIOR BIKES?? lmao what is this life
the “this smells like kourtneys orgasm”candle
He needs to hire his interior decorator to fix his outfit. sheesh is he wearing underwear?
Their relationship reminds me of mine. The whole gifts and being close before dating and the way they've blended their families and the way travis is.. laid back & calm.
Wow! So refreshing! Thank you for sharing Travis!
Mattress carry toxins for sure!!
100% Stellar
I love them together. They are so in love and they both deserve it. 🥰
......is that a leather jumpsuit?
Black and white is truly his uniform. No multicoloured clothes in his closet. Even his cars, all black.  I love the minimal design of the house. Every item feels intentional and is functional.
1+57
MTV cribs think they slick
Now this is how you design a home.  It's all about family and personal experiences, not about impressing the outside world.
Seems so much better for Kourtney than what she used to have. Love how he says our even before marriage.
I love the interior and exterior of your house Travis, your car garage is so slick.
How did the pillow move by itself??????????????????????
Woah, he is so soft spoken! Absolutely love his house, so clean, zen and soft.
I was expecting skulls and punk rock everywhere 🤣 but this house is very elegant, classy and sophisticated! Beautiful home 👏🏽
It looks kinda like Kim’s house
Beautiful home ❤️
Love this home and his energy. He is so calm and warm with his kids and Kourtney. Congratulations to them! And love the home, great job!
Travis is a Vegan; I did not realize that. At least his home, is not over the top; it seems very down to earth & comfortable; he seems like a laid back dude.
I love how he talks about everything and relates it back to family, memories, hobbies and functionality   shows he appreciates everything that he has worked hard for
This is by far, my favourite video from AD! I can see what kourtney see in him. This man seems so kind and sensitive. And his home is perfect
I like him. beautiful house
Really nice
Why is Travis wearing a trash bag smh
I actually really love this. Clean, warm and inviting.
how is no one talking about Kourtney randomly sitting on the kitchen counter half naked?
oh that's nice of Kourt, keeps his gifts in bags in her closet lol how thoughtful!!  She could have put some clothes on FFS ... I hate to say it, but she's turning trashy ... or  has she always been this way and he's brought it out of her? lol DGAF really ...
The framed picture Penelope drew of him is so special.
So interesting, mature and masculine vibes  🖤
What kind of bed is that?
I could move into this house today and be so comfortable. Love this style.
Love them
I cant get over how soft spoken he is
Is this going to be another beige expensive uninspiring piece of Hollywood rehash interior. Let’s see
Who knew no baseboards would look so lux. I'm very impressed w/ this home.
He’s the ultimate cool Dad❤️🤟
Love the house and his personality. On another note, literally anything can and is toxic at some point. Water has a toxicity level. If the info doesn’t include time exposure and dose, it’s pretty useless. I’ve no problem with an organic bed and I’ve not done research on the topic so I definitely don’t know for sure, just mentioning so people don’t freak out-you’re mostly likely fine unless you’re licking or eating your bedding. Most of the info on that type of stuff is misinformation and a sales tactic.
He looks like a vampire
Amazing home.  I can see why they get along so well!
MTV Cribs
Have you noticed how most talented people are so humble and the talentless make all the noise ?
What is he wearing?
Iam so Happy they have each is about love and respect goes along way cool guy””👌❤️
wtf is he wearing? a garbage bag with buttons?
I HONESTLY have an even better appreciation for Travis after seeing how tuned in he is.🙌🏽
You are soft, already love u
the best is the kitchen and dining for me 🥰❤️❤️❤️ i love how Kourney glows with love. i used to see her on tv stressed with Scott...so this is her best glow
Creative people are the best.
Just under 10,000 sqft. LOL
So they've been gifting each other from beforeeeeee ‽‽??
Gorgeous Home 🏡 🙏
So much different than his episode on MTV cribs when he was trying to be tough,   you can tell he's more mature.  & Kourtney is the least crazy Kardashian,  so he's legit
House looks like nobody lives there, it is like a showroom model piece, not my style. I like cozy homes.
So Kourtney couldn’t sit in the chair where the table is at? It’s right in front of her lol  Even Travis said they drink their tea there lol
This was beautiful! I can hear him talk all day. He’s so peaceful and passionate. So happy for Kourt!
I like him he seems very sensitive. Kourtney seems cold shes a Aries but deep down shes sensitive i think she hasn't been allowed to be herself in that family especially being the first born. Happy for them both he has brought out her softer side.
travis is vegannnnnn 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
So happy for Kourtney n Travis  God bless 🙌 🙏 ❤️ 💖 ✨️
Sounds very controlling to be honest
WE NEED KATY PERRY HOUSE TOUR
I think the most intriguing thing is that some people can judge so harshly about people that are tattooed like that and as “hardcore looking” as that, yet he is the most gentle soft spoken teddy bear you will ever meet. I love that his home is his place of zen. He’s done a great job of making it so peaceful and an amazing atmosphere.
they say don't judge the book by its cover
His voice is nice. Why does he never sing
He´s come a long way from MTV Cribs and pool slides in the backyard!
Why is the giant bearbrick blurred out?
thought this was MTV cribs at first
What a special guy. This was nice.
Such a gorgeous house why would you want to sell it😭😭😭😭😭
Hands down best episode I’ve seen on AD.
Travis has such a calming voice. His home is really nice. Good vibes only when you come to his home.
It’s so special when you’re friends first.
Wait..the day they hooked up as more than friends is the day he proposed? I'm confused. But love the home and how peaceful and elegant it is <3 If i had to think of a dream home i would imagine this house. I also love how everything is one story.
Kourtney doesnt work. But this was dope. I don't like too many ppl in my home either ❤️
He seems really sweet. Loved how much he talked about the designer. You can tell he really appreciates the people around him.
She is like a decoration in his house 😍 i love what their live's are becoming
I kinda like the interior I’d add just a touch more like contemporary/modern but comfy and not clinical. I LOVE the backyard and pool I wouldn’t change that at all. Travis is very down to earthq
I expected it to be... bigger?
it’s so interesting bc i can see why the sisters like him. he has so much in common with kendall and kim.
He talks like a kardashian
His mother's rosary next to Kourtney's orgasm! Bahahahahaha!!!
What is "macha"?
I've always been a fan of Travis ever since his Blink days  but it still never fails to amaze me how this guy is more than meets the eye. He seems very genuine and thoughtful-- something we rarely see and experience these days. I wish him all the happiness and love this world can offer    because he deserves it 😊
Look out for this house available for sale soon. Standard process of AD.
this means he's selling it, which means kravis are moving togheter
I love how he talks about the children, from both sides and just family in general he seems like a very family man
I love his voice. So sexy.
You really can tell alot about a person when you see their house!!!!  😊😊😊😍😍😍
This is beyond privilege. 0% punk rock
I normally don’t care for modern, minimalist style for a home…but I really love your home!  It truly is calming…
Tho Travis looks edgy his aura is a calm vibe I can see y she would date him
I ❤️ Travis!!!
Cringey as fuq
lové 📿🔮🪬
LOVE THIS HOME
Love the house and whatnot, but Dude,  what the frick are you wearing, it’s like a serial killer’s rubber one piece. C’mon man 😂
"I don't like when people put bunch of things everywhere" - That's ME!!! haha
“I’m a car guy”  I felt that
Perfection, masculinity, class, kindness.
wow he’s so chill… i don’t think i had ever heard his voice before haha
Zen, spacious, clean lines & all those memories that are so special to him. Loved how he mentioned the gifts they shared with one another long before they hooked up, now that's Amore❤️ ♥️🇨🇦♥️
Went from Punk Rocker to Fashionista
What’s a beautiful home!
this was absolutely stunning. what a guy.
The adult version of MTC cribs
You’re not hardcore unless you live hardcore…
People that still want her to be with Scott are out of their damn mind. This dude is a goal.
🖤
Love the vibrating bed 🎉
The only part that is even staged is probably kourtney sitting on the kitchen island 😂😂
OMG, 😱 That outfit is horrible. By the way these two are weird.🤦🏼‍♀🤦🏼‍♀
I can’t figure out if he likes a fireplace
I love everything about this man and this house and bmx's and skateboards too 😭
I wish Travis has an older uncle that is single....
Freak show.
when all the celebrities from my crib mtv have grown up and now show their houses on ad
Eat the rich.
What are they wearing? He’s in that weird jumpsuit and she doesn’t seem to have pants on.
Looks like a combination of Kourtney and Kim’s houses.
Travis seems like a great guy! He seems calm and down to earth  while explaining the design of his home. So happy for Kourtney to be with him. Hope their marriage will last.🙏🙏🙏
cool guy, cool house
Yes Kourtney nonchalantly setting on the kitchen counter sexily , sipping on tea your boo made you.
Pleasantly surprised at this beautiful space and loving Travis's vibe
I absolutely love his style. This is definitely my style of a home. Some of my family thinks I'm weird, because i have nothing on my walls, I'm  a minimalist, and I don't  like to have a lot of things.  Don't  know how to explain it, but it just messes with my head to see a lot of things around. Also, Travis is pretty damn cool!
Bruh the things I’d do to my home if I had money for it 😫
There’s something so chill about him, like idk
I don't know that much about him, but I can totally get why Kourtney married him. He's edgy. but grounded at the same time. Beautiful home, very balanced and not overly done. Hope they last and have a wonderful life together.
Why did I think he will not sound like that 😂😂😂it was so calming🤌🏽
that house's damn beautiful
I don't normally envy rich people homes cause it seems like a lot of space and a lot of work but damn would I kill for a matcha station in my home lmao
So soft Spoken!!!
I need my own Travis he seems like such an amazing person
Does anyone know who the guy is in the black and yellow poster over the couch?
ive only really thought of this guy when im shitting or vomitting, i really hope one day he realises how pathetic he is and a complete waste of air....
He doesn't like having too many people at home and he married a kardashian 😂
His house is so nice I love it and I don’t like white and black but the balance is nice
his voice was NOT expected. love his house tho
Some people have houses and Travis has a home.  Very warm and welcoming home.
LOVE this ! Cant wait for paige’s review
Beautiful house.!
Kourt and  you are soulmates 💛
Maaaan this house is beautiful! The backyard was probably my favorite part of the house 🔥
One of the best
Isn't it cool that Travis now gets to say "This is where my wife Kourtney sits"🤗❤🇿🇦
AD why did it end?😭 I didn't want to leave. Can you same homely🥰. It felt like a home sanctuary
Travis seems like a very nice, laid-back gentlemen.  I am thrilled he and Kort are married. <3
This house is beautiful, but now I am left with the terrifying knowledge that there are wild tarantulas in the US 😳
Wow I am so impressed by his complete knowledge of this house. Everything in this house is intentional. Everything in this house is his. It’s a not just a hour but a home. Appreciate this a lot.
I can see why Kourtney prefer Travis over Scott. Travis is so down to earth and chill. Scott acts like a spoiled douchey guy.
Yeah Kourtney just happened to be sitting on the island in practically nothing, these people are a cancer. Weirdest family on Earth.
Muy buen gusto realmente! una casa encantadora, se nota que le gusta la decoración y que sabe.
Beautiful home, not crazy about the movie room, seems blah, but I love Travis and Kourtney, and the family they are blending together
Such a divine genuine gentleman Travis barker is fahreal.
Travis is so sweet.  I can see why Kourtney is marrying him.
I love that he tells us the seating arrangement, and the home is absolutely stunning!
Cringe
He is so calm and has such a chill vibe!! The way he explained everything so well..  The way certain places and stuff that seems special to him. I loved this video..😊
He seems like a genuinely chill dude. He's successful, and not pretentious, and doesn't flaunt his wealth...not sure how he ended up with KK though 🤨
One of the best houses ever!! So minimal and cosy at the same time. Travis has such a good taste
I am so inspired.
Did he say under 10,000 SF???? That’s huge
The subtle way of saying Courtney's house is going on the market lol
This is close to my dream house. Also, what a sweet guy. I'm very happy for Kourtney, she deserves to have a calm life and a calm love ❤
I really love Travis's vibe. Always have, HATED him with Shanna and I don't think Kourtney is deserving of his vibe either, but he appears happy. Fame hasn't changed who he is and I love that most about him. P.S. ALWAYS loved that he continued his relationship with Atiana too!
He should eat some meat, so skinny, can't be healthy to eat only salad
Such a calming space! Love the vibe! Love seeing how happy they are!
haha...."the last house was too much. This one is under 10,000 square feet."
The "This Smells like Kourtney's Orgasm" candle at 10:31 hahaha. This tour was nice and casual and it really seems like he cares about the functionality of his home but he also has a lot of knick-knacks and sentimental items that make it personal
Never judge a book by its cover. Travis seems sooooo chill, humble, and grateful. I love his tranquil soft spokeness. Really cool guy. 😎🥁🖤 Edit: This is _easily_ my *favorite* AD house tour. His home is beautiful, functional, and sentimental. I love how he reminisced about moments and events that he and his kids shared in the house. It’s not just a house to him, it is his home.
OMG he's a Kardashian now
She didn’t have that black thing like her sisters.  She had the white thing
Lovely place! Thanks for being Vegan!💚
Kourtneys house is one of the best in all of La we need a tour of that not just pictures with people talking
Cool guy
Incredibly Dope ❤
This dude used to be cool 😢
Yea I can see why she married him lol ❤ happy for them ❤
Travis is such a creative genius and he talks so smoothly. It is very inspiring to get to know more about his mindset through his home tour.
His voice the way he talk is so feminine 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
I like his taste and calm energy
AMAZING✨☠️✨💫💫💫👍👍👍
Lots of chairs and sofas inside the house but Kim prefer to sit on table top. sigh~~
Finally a parent who lets the kids also get the most of a home. After all they are kids.
I watch these episodes only if I like the person but I have to say, why is this a thing anyway?? Like literally, whether the person is nice or not, it comes down to us normal people looking at how rich they are… it’s a capitalist dream.. it’s so weird don’t think it promotes good message..
Didn't expect his home to look like that, but I like it a lot.
Such a cool house!!!
He’s so sweet
Does anyone know why they blurred some artwork or paintings?
I'm wondering how many other old people, like myself, are watching this saying "Wtf is he now? This can not be the same Travis Barker from the 90s"
I appreciate design of houses that the owner actually lives in it, owns the space and able to create moments with it, regardless how subjective simple minded people judge it, well perhaps for celebs it's a little bit different bc people expecting them to be exciting rather than being a human being who needs to sleep and take a sht
10:34 "this smells like kourtneys orgasm" omg lol
Travis is a breath of fresh air, seems so sweet, and I loved all his little sentiments on his nightstand! Just precious ❤️
Please adopt me 🤣
He seems so sweet and calm. Like a serial killer. 😊🙃
“The first day we hooked up or hung out and also the day I proposed” LOL they had sex once and decided that was it
Lovely!
This was truly beautiful to watch. He’s such a cool chill dude. I’m so happy Kourtney and Travis are together their a special kind of love🥰🔥 Thank you for sharing love 😍❤️🙏🏾
The falling water house for example, such groundbreaking creation, it's a mark in history, it is indeed a great concept & design, but it's not a "home", it's a museum due to its well thought constructive idea
Hmmm. Is Kourtney going to keep her house still? She is a bit strong in her tastes so living in someone else’s space seems like it would be hard for her.
Beautiful house!
Nice pijamas
if it's one thing about travis's kids, they're gonna do their homework!!!!
This video really says  "Never judge a book by its cover".
He's soo proud and humble over his home! I can't really place another celeb going through their home quite like this. He was soo complimentary of the designer. Lovely video!
One of the most beautiful homes I’ve seen! He seems like such a humble dude!
Count the times he says "like" from 4:16 - 5:16. lol
perfect lifedesign right here. this is 100% inspiring. he has mastered his craft and has a beautiful life around it.
What in the hell is this man wearing?.... nice house but that onsie needs to go.
Wow! I have no idea who this guy is, but I have a feeling I would like him if we ever met. Gonna Google his music and check it out, too. Great tour! Thank you for sharing...
What a joke these people are and those that follow this crap.  I DON"T CARE!!!!
I'm pretty impressed. I was not expecting that.
Most of the celebrities  have homes of concrete, black, grey, or white interior?? Cold!!  Boring!!!   I guess, they all share the same interior designer!  Art???? Antiques???? No!!!!
When it's a home we shouldn't just talking about style, it's a big part of the owner, their traits, habits, memories, all come together to create the space, I truly reluctant to judge a home design in a word, a home design may look "ugly" to some eyes but hey you don't get to experience the space & their personal engage, truly different from judging public places
It looks like a normal home and not a celebrity's mansions and it is good. Not very luxurious! ;)
A tormented soul,,,CHRIST is Greater
The comment abt Kourtney on the candle had me absolutely deaddddd ahahahahahaha
This house is so beautiful
So I wonder if this Isa trend because Kim's house look similar in terms of minimalism and I'm a big fan of minimalism
This guy is EVERYTHANG!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️
Go Travis and Kourtney so happy for you both ❤️
This is what happens when you let a drummer give his musical opinion.
looking like sinbad in that jumper lol
I love Travis for Kourtney I believe he won't let anyone mistreat her !
3:55 This is my Wifey.. 😜😜
I peeped that Banksy
Beautiful home inside nice all room each wow beautiful homestyle wow
He's not dating a Kardashian is he? Why are they even famous? I know why Travis is, because he's got talent n skill.  What about the lady no offense
One of my favorite tours. Travis seems so authentic and down to earth, love it
This is cute, I can’t stop smiling
He seems cool but that is one boring looking house.  Edit: okay, the outdoor space is lovely
I love that his house truly is lived not just a "monument", you know, I personally prefer "mainstream" style but actually soulful because people truly enjoy living in the space rather than the crazy unique "home" you never sit on more than a day
The dude is wearing a trash bag 🤐😏
He is super calm and nice omg. And being in that house for 16yers is rare in USA and celebrities.. Cause they always move. But really beautiful house I mean home!
I loved Travis house. Good job Interior designer.
So happy for him! He changed his life. 🙏
What he needs is to eat more
In a weird way I was so happy to hear he bought the house 16 years ago, I feel like celebrities are always moving every 3 years lol
Beautiful home. Travis is so chill. I’m glad he and Kourtney are happy…she deserves it.
"Vibe" most overused word. Freakn annoying
Please do a house tour of Priyanka’s house as well!
What’s he talking about energy?
I know some people tend to "love" maximalist more and would say minimalist is boring, but really, to me, at the end of the day i want my "home" to be calming & relaxing as much as it can, place where i feel ease tossing away crazy hustle for some times, not adding into it 🤣
Such a great video thanks for letting us in to your world and showing us your home !  🤟🏼
Abcdefg he has to go
Why did they censor some art?
Pretty but predictably boring Belgian style through an LA lens. It hits all the hallmarks: tree in an old barrel, linen slipcover sofas in neutrals, senufo tables and stools, those black import pots, big blocks of rough stone, everything contrasted with blank white walls and clean lines and black metal accents. The style of the house seems Spanish too, so kind of a weird contrast with the decor. Honestly this is just as cookie cutter as those all black and white super modern LA homes that a lot of sports players and youtubers end up in. It doesn't feel organic or personal.
🙏🏼❤️😍🇵🇭
3:55 C R I N G E ALERT
hes done changed since his 182 days
I love his understated classic style, which is unexpected for a rockstar drummer. The house matches his laid back personality.
this is like the first time i haven’t skipped through an AD video. i love his vibes.
Love his house and his energy
Wow after i see the way he talks and tastes of the house, i understand why she fell for this one Hope they are happy together
This was quite tranquil and I got curious about the Matcha!  Mr. Travis better dish out the recipe 🎶🎶🎶
please do one with kris jenner. her new house is magnificent.
When their doors are open, do bugs get in? Does air conditioning get out? Do they not care? Lol help me understand, I'm poor!
Just gorgeous...!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
yeah the bathroom is just around the corner travis. the sink has been leaking for about a week now thank you for helping us fix it
ALL THE SMALL THINGS
I've always liked him. His house has grown up with him, too cool.
Im just falling in love with their love story 💕
He bought that house so long ago😂 it’s probably worth 3x what it was back then now.
Ok but the gift kourtney got him of his five favorite albums is so thoughtful and cute !!
Life goal: Find a guy like Travis Barker
I love this video, but the warp stabiliser on the footage is too much at times, give us that natural camera shake!
Bought it 16 yrs ago! wow...thought he just showed up...he is a made man.
I love his appreciation of gifts that he has received. His space strikes a good balance of minimalism and comfort.🖤
I've liked Travis since his reality show with his ex wife he's a Beautiful spirit wishing him & Kourtney a Lifetime of Happiness
"is trav still looking for the gold bike? Lebron never came and picked his up" such a casual celeb convo🤣
the candle that says "this smells like kourtney's orgasm". goals
He has his mom’s rosary by his bed 💕💕💕
This might be my favorite AD yet. Definitely reminds me of the charm that Devin Booker showed during his house tour. Despite the incredible wealth and fame behind Travis Barker, he still manages to come off relatively humble. Thank you AD!
Phenomenal<3
I like this tour. Travis doesn’t seem pretentious like most I’ve watched before.
His home looks very comfortable, lived in.
Hearing him talk I can definitely see why she married him. He’s a big teddy bear 🧸 sounds like a sweetheart.

he has a child like vibe about him... I mean like he never forgot what that felt like because he seems so real.
I loved loved loved seeing his home. He seems like such a sweet and genuine person and I love that he’s lived in this home for 16 years and has cherished memories in it and is really use the home rather than just being a status symbol
This is so wholesome! 🖤
Nice house. I don't even have gas to get me to chemo...lol he has 4 cars...🙄
I love travis
vegan food
I love his dining room. Formal but super inviting and cozy. Also, didn’t expect him to such a homebody Dad. Love his whole vibe ♥️
Contrary to what many say about Travis, he's actually pretty chill, not pretentious, and a cool dad.
Zen vibe.
Travis seems so humble and down to earth. His home is beautiful!
He seems so nice and peaceful. I'm glad I watched this.
I was admittedly hating Travis & Kourtney sooooooooooooooooooooooooo much for all their obnoxious PDA on The Kardashians, but after seeing this I’m now happy for the both of them.
He knew every chair his kids and Kourtneys kids sit in during dinner! Wow. His home is really a “home”. Now that’s a present father! Kourtney did well in choosing him for a mate. 🌹🌹🌹
I 🖤🖤🖤 the Buick!!! My best friend growing up had the '87 Buick Grand National T-Type turbo, all original from the factory, with 34,000 miles and it was # 0000121 on the vin.  Her father bought it brand new, and gave it to her for her 21st birthday. The car literally would push you back in your seat when you accelerate it. It's the coolest most understated car you'll ever ride in/drive!!! That is definitely an awesome bday gift!
That was absolutely un-real, Thank-you so much for the tour, the towel bar smash skull plasma reaper lamp is totally rad, these bikes are familiar too, anyway eyelets someone else comment on the other 🤗😇
I admire his ability to truly value his home and keep it sacred for him and his family. I especially found it admirable when he went around the table and said who sat where. They were a family even before he got married to Kourtney and it's really cool he shared his home to all of us.
really nice home!
He has the sweetest most sentimental spirit. Really nice pad too!
Don’t judge a guy by his tats 🖤 what a nice family man ❤️
His home seems so normal, beautiful home.
Who's this guy
This house is so well design & organize with decoration items. 10 times better then Scott house 😅. No wonder Cornie left him 😂.
Wow u just wanna listen to him 👂🔥🔥🔥
beautiful! a space that gives you an opportunity to be!
His appearance is deceiving; he looks like a wild human being,but,he actually sounds like a gentle soul 👍! Way to go Kourtney 👍!
I really hate rich people
Humble vibes
Who else is imagining Scott watching this? Lmao.
Is he welcoming to his or Her home?
Who would it tell that the "hard-core, fully tattoo, punk rock guy" was the most calm sweet lay back relaxing guy!! Seriously his house its nothing I thought of, it's so peaceful and beautiful, he has amazing taste and his voice it's so relaxing, full of tranquility..I could hear him talk all day long
Congrats to you and Kourtney! You 2 give me hope in love. It's beautiful and makes "my " heart happy. <3  #prayingforababy
Started from MTV cribs now AD…niceeee
K so whats the matcha recipe?
okay well this made it extremely clear how perfect they are together. everything he said was like vegan, organic, minimalist, creative, calm, thoughtful, sentimental, loving, down to earth, comfortable, kid focused. literally everything scott wasn’t. congrats to the newlyweds. they truly are a match made in heaven.
So you're telling me that's NOT kourtneys house 🙊🙊 i was so confused as to why he was doing an arch digest video of HER house ..... So ALL of Calabasas uses the same 2 interior designers
I have zero knowledge who this guy is, he looks like an ex convict
Wait so he has a Craftmatic Adjustable Bed?!?! Celebrities really are just like us! 🤣🤣🤣
So sweet he knows where everyone sits at dinner
I love this house
So humble, so genuine. This is probably the best home tour I've seen to date.
I like how he decided to describe Kendall as if people won’t know Kendall. That’s nice 😂
his tshirt collection omg
I didnt expect his voice to be like that lmao he sounds way better than he looks
He's so calming I can listen to him for long periods of time lol no wonder he and Kourtney make a good couple you can see a lot of things in common personality wise in them. I remember when Travis had his show the way he spoke to his then wife was so calm and patient.
I love his home!!
Hes very soft spoken Ive never heard anything intimate till now
And his house so calming and zen
I love the minimalist but cozy design - not easy to achieve. Beautiful.
Wow his voice is so calming
Penelope art soo cute 😄💛
Have a shot every time he mentions Kourtney.
I love his voice is so chill
I love how the house is simple.  He seems very "normal." I didn't expect that with all the tattoos.
You can still see  the kids riding skateboards down the hall ! What a cool vibe . Travis  and Kourtney  are really  down to earth , best wishes  !
I am really not impressed. It looks like it was scrambled together last minute from CB2 or smth. Nothing vintage, old, lived in, or unique.
I love that he's still in the same home he bought 16 years ago. Such a humble and nice guy.
I remember watching him on MTV cribs years and years ago. This is a big upgrade. The serene and calm vibe is amazing.
the fact that people take 15 mins to show off their house when i can finish my house tour in less than a minute
I love everything about this house design and layout.
I have no idea who this guy is but I love how he prioritizes things in his life and his house really works with his needs
I so like his calm energy...I can see why kourtney fell in love with him....she really upgraded😍😇
Kourtney is really aging impeccably
Never knew Travis way of talk is this chill, and he explain each room very well
I'm in love with his kitchen, and I'm very impressed with his "Matcha Station". There's a serenity to preparing tea and I think having a tea station just makes a space more peaceful!🙏 The industrial meets minimalist with a touch of farmhouse chic vibe of the kitchen speaks to my former chef self, and to my Mom likes a tidy kitchen self! Very well done!
Please do hayley williams house tour too
His home is like a modern/ up to date version of what practical contemporary was in the early 2000s. Even his furniture, its practical and the tones are very reminiscent of the furniture or colours that were marketed to men/boys back than.  It's not plain, its simple and I like it. If you're gonna spend a boat load of cash, make sure you can use what you pay for 😂 I wish he was apart of the creative process as touches of his personal style, punk flare would have really taken it there but he got what he wanted so good for him lol
His house looks so peaceful 😩😩😎
I enjoyed this
Forever♾️
Dude I don't know you and did not before. But watching this video. Much Respect! love the fact that you cherish family moments. Thank you sir Barker.
Beautiful tour 😊 I love there love 💕 it seems really authentic and on there terms always . The way they love on each other is beautiful with there kids . Congratulations 🍾🎊🎉💍Kourt&Travis I pray that your bond last a life time. 😇💍🌸
They are basically twins
Kringe with a dash of Kreepy
I'm not friends with Travis so I don't have a clue of course, if he's actual real here or not, but except for some of his art pieces and his closet the whole tour felt like he's an actor impersonating someone touring a house which he doesn't live in in a life he doesn't have. Maybe he's just like that and it's his authentic self but the whole video has weird vibe to it.  Like Kourtney wanted to flex with another house like her other sisters and Travis simply has to comply with everything because he signed a temporary contract to play her man for the media.
Nooo I don’t like it
that was really inspiring
What an awesome vibe. Tranquility at its finest
🤍
So he's vegan, but is wearing a leather onesie......interesting.
Love this!
I'm pretty sure he did an episode of Cribs back in the day so this is nostalgic AF! He seems like a very mellow person with good vibes. P.S. get you a man that can't keep his hands off of you, that cam compartmentalize doing a recording with AD and also care deeply about what you're drinking, who speaks of you with so much love and incorporates you fully into his world. All of that is conveyed here. Sheesh...
Yaaaass travviisssss 🥵🥵
Gorgeous home. But if you shower and wash your linens regularly, you really don’t need to be concerned about “toxins” in your mattress 😂
He gives me awesome energy!
Ok, get it now. I really like Travis Barker.
I’ve never heard this man speak and idk he just sounds different than I’d imagined
What a master piece, I loved the Travis' vibe and the serenity in his home. Kourtney has the same vibe and they they are perfect for each other.
I love this house 💖 Travis seems like a very family oriented individual.
I envisioned Travis home to be a bit more chaotic (not in a bad way). Love how he remembers the seating arrangements of all the kids at the table. He seems like a genuine dude.
I thought he was kind of extravagant.    Never juge a book buy it cover
Wow, Travis is the coolest
It's interesting how he mostly has that strong LA inflection at the end of each sentence when he's around Kourtney. Great house. Relaxing vibes for sure.
He is that wealthy, yet wears head to toe black garbage bags. #Humble
Cold and sterile...ugh
He looks so calming and like he phased out the party scene. Love how he downgraded from a massive huge 3 story house to a single family home and kept it for all his memories of his children. This house looks so cozy love it 😍
I Like Travis Barker! He's always seemed like a cool laid back sensitive guy to kick it with!!!
Trust Kourtney to be on the counter screaming come get me LOL x
Wow 16 years ago! I know this house have quadruple in price already.
dressed like he cleans up murder scenes for a job but with the most wonderful zen personality and fabulous home. Love.
MTV crib vibes; it's refreshing to see his has feet on the ground. super grounded home, bless to luck to him & kourt
It would be dope to see him jam with the Foo Fighters
Cool dude 😎
Drop the mic Kourtney. Yea
I just want to say. Kourtney is finally found the right guy! Travis Barker!
Love the neutral calm zen vibe great house
He is such a calming vibe I can see why Kourtney loves him x
Would love to see the designers point of view, but looks great. Kitchen removed the wall and reinforced with that huge wooden plant, so sleek
Speaking about Kourney, 'She still has like these candles wrapped up in bags in her closet that I got her three years ago, and I'm like whoa'.  Laugh out f*n loud.  You keep doing you Travis.  Nice spread.
What a sweet lovely young man 😊👍 best wishes to the newly married couple… they are really perfect together ❤️🥰
why r u never shows the house from the outside !? isn't this channel is about architecture ????
Kourtney looks so much like her mother here.
I am happy for them😁🙏🥰
He’s so humble and sweet and so in love.
Very depressing house, all gray and black. Yak!
Beautiful home! Beautiful couple! I love them together 😍
He is so cool
Waldo the Wall Destroyer  4:58 Wouldn’t be a real house tour without the wrist! 🤣
He's so calm. I feel zen after watching
He is so chill .. I am so happy for kourtney .❤️
This guy 😍😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Doesn't look like some show home that a designer put together. This was put together by a designer too, but it still looks like a REAL house someone lives in!
Gross. I cant stand the Kardashians. Lol
They have good vibes. I like their very laid back home aesthetic but with an element of danger mixed in with their artwork & motor fleet. It’s a beautiful & harmonious mixture. 👏🏼
Such an amazing home. My favorites are the kitchen and his bedroom.
Thank you for your tour of your home.
Exceptional style. Love it to bits.
Honestly no one can tell me that this man and Kourt arent made for each other.. "organic this, organic that, vegan this, vegan that".. come on now 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Does anyone know which electric Roland kit Travis has in the video?
i LOVED HIM First  xoxo
I love his voice. His home and Kendall's are my favourite. I love one story homes.
Wow! His house is beautiful ..I love it! 😍
I can’t stop smiling....so cute 😍😍😍
So happy for Travis!
Who?
It would’ve been cool if they showed the before & after of the house … I love the vibe of it
He's so relatable and calm very different from what the media and opinions of people have painted about him since being with Kourtney.
Kourt always looking at laptop as if she's workaholics person hahha I can't, Kourt we all know you hate working
"Turn the fireplace on and chill" *squints eyes*
I absolutely love his vibe. He’s so tranquil and serene when he speaks. His home is beautiful
Lovely down to earth person. Happy that he has found happiness. Kourt deserves a loving solid calm person like him.
Ahh.. must be really satysfaing live life with financiall freedom.
This is the most unflashy flashy house if you know what I mean 😂 and he really got good taste tho.
Lovely, peaceful and tasteful just like its owner.
Where is Scott's room?
He’s a life path 11 so he must have his home very zen ☺️
It is very serene and peaceful, wonderful symmetry and proportion.  Love the natural elements with the artsy touches.  Travis is cool, a thoughtful creative fellow as well as a vegan who loves animals and music, and is a great dad.   Very interesting tour.
That many tattoos are a total turn off for me... but I think Travis is an exception lol! He comes across as such a beautiful spirit.
He look like a scared kid in viva ..... totally real and relatable....also why Kardashian stuff feels so scripted
Love it
Perfect example of 'don't judge a book by its cover'.  He seems to be a good and loving guy.
Am I the only one that noticed the Heretic candle label in the bedroom?? ‘This Candle Smells Like Kourtney’s Or***m’😂
so he got a Kardashian XD all power to him
Sleek…
Omg
Clearly a musician IYKYK has a B&O TV 😎 and I really enjoy having a celebrity show us abit of their life.
Dream home
He is softly spoken but a great conversationalist. And super talented! Really beautiful homely home with clean lines. I loved the curved window in the informal dining area that looks out into the yard.
He is so cute^^ like how refreshing is hearing and seeing a celebrity that is down to heart and calm, and talks normal!!! Not pretentious, I like him! Good for Kourtney ♡
Nice. He seems cool
Love how comfortable his house is, so chill.
I definitely expected to see BLACK everywhere!😂 Love Trav and Kourt together🥰🤗
He said our... including Kourtney in his space
Travis is lovely!!  Congratulations Courtney! The home looks good, natural vibes.
Kind boring … it had nothing on his personality the only think I liked was the lamp he designed .. it feels he just wants to show his relationship for the 100 time … well congrats guys be happy 🫶
I love Travis my God does he has class and style wow. I remember his house from his first reality show. I remember him on KUWTK as Kourtney's neighbor and I was always wondering what his house/mansion looked like. This is beautiful, I love everything and the stories of each room. I hope his Wife and him keep the 2 properties as is next door to each other. Beautiful home and to me the best in this series so far.
His home actually looks like a real lived in home and not just a cold untouched house for show. Beautiful home. I really like it. 👍 I can tell you all love one another. So sweet.
honestly he seems like a cool dude. House is very well designed and seems easy to live in good for you dude!
i didnt expect him to be so soft
He always mentioned Kourtney. Shows how much they love each other
16 years in one place.  Stable.  Appreciate the simple beauty of the house is refreshing.
Love everything about this house
I really hope the Kardashian curse doesn't mess him up. Such a cool guy.
Dope house.  I’d def have vines throughout the interior
Apprehensive to click on this video for whatever reason, I walked away such a fan of Travis! What a cool guy!
is he trying to make weight?
Neat home
Things he says about his experience pretty much reminded me of how Howard Roark (Fountainhead) would work))
Travis is such a Dope person. ☺
i love that he mentioned where everyone sits at the dinner table ❤ love Travis.
His house looks so airy and tasteful!
Discriptive yet humble. Travis seems kind and gentile. I don't normally comment but this was just so beautifully and artfully done.
I love Cadillac too... and arghhh the house is ugly...
Looks are deceiving, he sounds so cool
Travis parachuting later?
His house is so chill, like you can really love being there rather than worrying about damaging any property or so... Cool!!!
I can’t wait to see it in person sometime Travis!
I love the michael Myers jumpsuit
I like how he’s so soft spoken yet looks so intimidating with tattoos everywhere.
What a G
Travis has the absolute stunning house with perfect comfortable rooms especially his band room where he makes his music 🎶 🥰🤩🤗😍😊💯🔥❤️😘😇🙏🙌👍👌😉😃👏
You lost me a vegan food.  😛
I love his house. I never thought he had such a chill personality
I like Kourtney‘s new home 😂
Travis is a fashion icon, but i forget sometimes he’s also super chill Blink-182 guy and would be absolutely awesome to just talk with
beautiful home
Why’s no one talking about the candle in his bedroom
i love his aura,he seems like a kind person
House doesn’t look staged at all.
I love his serenity, with the measured way that he speaks, and I love his eye contact when he’s talking about something and really cares about it. I don’t know much about him but he seems like he found his harmony in that home.   P.S. I really loved how excited he got when he was talking about his interior designer/architect. Did anyone catch the name?
He's not who I thought he was. He's very down to earth, calm, cool and collected.
You have just won my heart....the house look wow....All the best with Kout...
I saw black furniture in the backyard patio and immediately thought…i wonder if she made that same comment to Travis that she made to Khloe 😂
I love his soft spokeness. I see what Kourtney feels or sees in him. So happy for them ... ♡.
His home is just like him, Super Hella cool, welcoming and Zen!! 👊🏽
I want to be friends with Travis Barker.
Ahh..., I have really grown to like Kravis because I know it is genuine. Also the house is really nice
When I was younger, I probably would have been fooled and thought this was cool. Once you peak behind the Hollywood curtains however, it can't be unseen. It's all just smoke and mirrors. They're just normal people with money and fame and part of their job is to carry out a specific lifestyle and appearance. I get it now. Sometimes however I do wish I could go back to just being a little naive. Ignorance is truly bliss in the right situations.
He sounds like a humble guy
As soon as I heard his voice that he was a vegan. It lacks the depth of a meat eater.
Soooo not Punk Rock
The best part of this tour was Travis.  The best moment was when he shared where everyone sits at the dining table for dinner and he named all the children's chairs.
The “this smells like Kourtney’s orgasm” candle
That's well designed!
Travis is amazing and his house is beautiful!
Love from Haïti 🇭🇹.
the chemistry they have is beautiful
I love the spots at the table, its like that at my sisters house we all have our spots, and same at my house and thats how it was growing up in my house we all had our spots
I love the house and Travis energy was so nice
How tasteful that his Fiancé had to be in a PJ dress or long tee it had to be highlighted that she's in PJs to promote sexuality not everything has to be sexual or sexualized but sick people sick producers who ever idea it was to be tasteless
So down to earth and humble
hes so peaceful
Aww he’s so cute and calm. Happy for them!!
I could have made that painting with the 5 albums ...
10:29
What a laid back simplistic beautiful home
Interesting how it simply looks like every other on trend Kardashian neutral 1x1 mansion you could think of with nothing more to it … makes you wonder if they (Barker, Skete) actually like their current state of living the PR life and treading everything as part of their job or are just playing along because it‘s a easy & surely also from time to time fun way to accommodate more wealth for them & their kids.
Hahah the part where he said he’s scared of tarantulas! Do you guys remember the episode where Kourtneys house was infested with them? Lmao!! That’s hilarious!!
This mf looks like Adam Levine on crack
linda a decoração muito bom gosto
Best rooms are living and dining rooms. Other than that- really, Kourtney couldn't put on clothes for the tour?! Not even shorts or pants? Give me a break. Was this a tour of his house or of his love for Kourtney and the fact that his vegan, mentioned every other sentence.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I don’t like the house
Gifts from years ago.... 👀 uh huh.... but I hear your Travis I don’t like a lot of ppl in my home too!
The best vibes. I love this style of home! I would love this style but filled with plants and crystals. I'm so happy for Kourtney and him.
l
prob one of the best homes I ever seen
💯I AM REALLY IMPRESS🥰 TRAVIS  HOME IS BEAUTIFUL🏆..TRAVIS ALSO SEEMS LIKE VERY CALM PERSON..HE LIKES CREEPY THINGS 🕷️🥺 NOT PLEASING AT ALL. BUT THAT HIS HOME.  NICE TOUR 💞
anyone else notice the KK monogrammed pillowcase on his bed? so cute
Very impressive your very blessed and wish you the best with Courtney and all the children yall are doing great together and love is what life is all about
Who wouldn’t marry this guy right? Such a lovely one
Thanks for sharing Travis! love his vibe, he seems so calm natured, just like Kourtney so happy for these two!! Love this home too!
I like that this is a mansion and doesn't feel like . It's not like overwhelmingly big or anything
He’s just so real. I can absolutely see why Kourtney fell for him because she is very real herself. Authentic.
Beautiful home...
Hes such a sweet guy. I hope to be as lucky as Kourtney one day
That vase @5:18 is not in the centre and my OCD is acting up.
Adorable man adorable home
bless him he's such a sweet person.
"this smells like Kourtney's orgasms" anyone noticed the candle? Love how love language is scattered everywhere, obsessed with this couple & their house ❤️
I am so used to seeing literal houses as rooms in AD's celeb videos that this one felt...small... meanwhile I am living in a studio apartment lol
Love the design! So peaceful, minimalistic, and tranquil. 🙌
My 13 year old son luvs his suit! He says he just luvs his style entirely!
He speaks like a monk. Not that I’ve ever talked to a monk but I imagine that’s how they speak.
Man, I thought I had a lot of vintage tee shirts but TB puts my collection to shame. My favorite section was his garage & all his blacked out vehicles, the only way to go.
Nice!!! CONGRATULATIONS To Travis & Kourtney!!!
Nice everything
Arnt there enough chairs around for Kourtney.....????
I don't know why I thought his voice would be deeper but it's actually very calming. I love how he's so into his woman and welcomes her children with open arms. He seems very chill and romantic. The house is beautiful. Could use a bit more color pop.
Kourtney, if you are actually reading this he is amazing and I hope that you guys forever have the best of love.
I LOVE this house... the feeling of space...colour tones...serene.... and i actually like this dude ..didnt think i would...chill humble...sweet...3 kids!!?? he looks like a teenager.
There should be a drinking game for every time he name dropped kourtney
Very excited about the mention of vegan food
I see why kourtney fell in love with travis he so humble and nice.
What a chill dude. That’s a really peacefully designed vibe.
I had no idea he had all that money 16 years ago lol good for him
Theyre both so gross. Their PDA is way over the top and hes so creepy
He seems just like so peaceful and mellow and zen
He’s so chill
So beautiful 😀I love it !
Not hatting or anything but this is not what I expected from Travis…guess I pictured like a crack house basically 😅
Please do nicki minaj house tour
If Mattel made punks...
When going to tie knot
Wow, what a beautiful home, and Travis couldn't be more sweet and proud! Love it!
No thank you, 👽👎
Awww bless him, he eating vegan food. Now we all kw that not true.
this was so cool
Living for Kourtney’s just rolled out of bed look. They’re so in love, love that for her
If Travis was a woman, he would be Kourtney. They just make sense!
His voice is so calming and sweet. Seems like a peaceful guy.
As a reviewer that when I saw the house there was just all white to see a front room that has very little color and little design yet if the neat stacks that decorate the book case type walls of the dinning area . To see more of color and the hardwoods that go with a family room the use of open space and ells of one thing that there is is a party type house seeing the many rooms looks more family oriented . The kitchen needs to be modern and the showing of copper colors giving more colors. The long hallways has the feel of a museum to have guests is that there should be paintings very little design color   to show warmth and design .
If he could gain a lil bit of weight. Good looking when heavier I think. I like him better with hair but it's not my man or head. Hehe! So,I'm gonna start cleaning and mind my own today.
One of the first homes I've seen that isn't over the top or too extra .
How cool would it be if everyone in the world had such a space to spend time with their family? Alas!
In this profile we love Travis Barker.
Travis just doubled his total talk time with this video 🤣
Also one thing I'm learning about rich people, they are so intune with their creativity 👌
IKEA vibes!
Why did the flowers change on the kitchen table :/
He just keeps surprising us with more and more omg he's is amazing I would love to meet him
Does anyone know what kind of plant is on TB's outdoor dining table???
Of all the homes that has been featured here, this is my favorite.
This Guy look like a skinny crackhead.
Wow she looks so much like her mother 😊
ANYONE KNOWS WHERE TRAVIS'S JUMPSUIT IS FROM ??? plsss
what's the name brand of the bed?
Beautiful home 😍😍😍
Travis look is total different with his personality his voice is everything peaceful
I'm wearing that same leather jumpsuit right now. What are the odds.
He seems so down to earth.  I love the way he speaks.  He's so romantic with Kourtney.  I wish them the best!
I loved this tour Travis is very good family guy and his house is perfect not too packed with stuff he really knows what he is doing very nice guy this is why Kourt falled in love with him
One of the rare celebrities with all-round good taste. The whole house feels like *home...*  And on top of all that, Travis is so down to earth, very likeable.
Travis has this gentle super villain vibe
Nice
So stunning!!! Love the kitchen windows and the kitchen. Gorgeous. HE seems like such a nice chill genuine guy!!
He definitely gives loml vibes. I'm with Kourt on this one.
Love them 💕
She looks so happy with him
He might look too much with the tattoos but i can see what a cool nice personality he has.  Kourtney is not idiot, if she is marrying she knows why.  The way he talks about his family says it all, sweet guy. I have to add that he certainly looks sexy and the size of his shoes! Oh my god.
Wow, he’s actually really soft spoken, with a calm and soothing voice. Love The  minimalistic vibe of the house without it seeming “cold ” , love the pops of color here n there which compliment the neutral palette, it really looks lived-in. Funny how it already looks like somewhere Kourtney would live , yet he’s lived  there for 16 years ! Very interesting room tour .
He’s the absolute opposite of Scott.
His taste is amazing❤️
This candle smells like kourtneys orgasm 😂
Vegans simply can't help it...they have an unwavering need to tell you when its not relevant. I laughed so hard when he said that.  . . I don't dislike vegans, it's just so odd to me how they always bring it up.
Travis makes Kourtney happy, God Bless them, 😍😍😍😍and he is too cute awwww
Wow Satanists are so OPEN about their ways! Eery wall art@
Love this
This is such a Kardashian vibe his home is so beautiful . Like I'm starting to think Travis was a Kardashian all along. Its literally Kourtneys dream to find some one with her taste. Her and Scott never really had much in common when it came to interior design..
Who the F is this guy, he looks pretty unstable.
The way he speaks about his children is so lovely.
If a man this dope and chill is so in love with Kourtney, she has to be the best Kardashian.
I don’t like to have to many people in my home  Also yeah we threw a project x party here in my home
His outter appearance might scream dark/rock, but he seems to have a very chill and zen personality. Interesting contrast, reflected in his house. I can see why Kourtney is attracted to him
He seems like such a sweet guy - with a gorgeous family focused home and life.
I LOVE your home Travis!!  I always watch the AD home tours & there are So so many beautiful homes w/incredible décor & ort.  However, had I the means to have a large home & choose whatever I wanted in in.....This is 100% my vibe!  Down to the layout, finishes, colors, décor, windows, arches, natural light & outdoor space - truly delicious!  Thanks for sharing Travis Barker, Kourtney & AD ♥
Travis is basically the male version of Kourtney, that makes a couple.
I find him so plain and monotone
Sounds like a kind man, grounded
I loved this tour. He's a breath of fresh air.
He’s naturally chic
Just amazing.  The house speaks live in me as well as just relax. Well done.
Heh, whose idea was it that she show up in only his pajama top
Travis' voice is so relaxing, it's really nice to hear him talk about the things and people that he obviously loves so much.
10:34 Oh My. The. Candle.
I love your home.It's actually my dream home. It's so calming and not overwhelming with colors or other distractions. The natural colored vases and tree pots are absolutely beautiful. Wishing you the best enjoy your environment it's the best.
first time to hear his voice🥰🥰
Kourtney looks so much like Kris.
What in the hepatitis yellow
The home fits him. I'm glad to see someone who drives the cars they own versus buying them because they have nothing else to spend their cash on.
U can tell how much he adores his kids and family by the memories he shares there!
plz try to do with Cristiano Ronaldo plzzzzz
Wonderful
What a lovely house! I admire how family-oriented Travis is. So happy for Kourtney :)
So Kourt is literally just hanging on the work station with a lap top OK
I am so turned off by this klan and what they promote.  I will be unsubscribing because I am discussed by the Kardashians/Jenners🤮
Very calming❤😊
Love how he speak about kourt , I feel the love❤️💕
Quintessential Waldo Fernandez/Clements Design. Although, I hate them plaster floors. lol
This is gorgeous. Travis and his designer did a beautiful job on the remodel
Love his house. It’s so him and that’s how a home should look and feel
His "look," his persona is cultivated, like his house, planned.
I love this guy !!
honestly, amazing home! super cozy i love it
The designer did a great renovation work!!!😍😍
BEAUTIFUL😍
Perfect example of a California liberal
Wow this is a really beautiful house.....but that closet, a man after my own heart
Beautiful home❤️
Travis is such a Legend! Hope he will bring Tom DeLonge back to blink-182!
This was a tour that left me feeling very relaxed. Loved it and thank you for sharing. I loved the love too that he obviously feels for everyone in his life. When he said, "mmmm.." before kissing Kourtney, was what a girl wants 😍😀
This dude has swag.The minute he said organic mattress and vegan hotdogs I knew why Courtney liked him.
Travis seems like a great guy
Love his house. It’s very cozy and spacious.
Best home this far the vibe is speechless
She is relationship homeless. Sleeps with anyone she sees.
Now I see why Kourtney married him. He is so calm composed and mature. And care about his and her kids.
Is he vegan? Surprised he didn't mention it...
Kourtney spill Travis’ matcha recipe!
is this the same house in his MTv reality show with his ex wife?
I get it Kourtney. I do. 😍
In the 90's I use to have a big crush on Travis. Just the tattoo's and bald head. Now. Not so..much. But I'm happy there happy. Famous or not. Everyone deserves to be happy. And smile. They truly deserve it. After what been through. Congratulations 🎉👏 mad respect for you guys. Don't let nothing come between you. Fake new or gossip. Or whatever
You Buy presents desde antes de salir awwwwwwe
More and more I can see why kourtney put a ring on it lol
Boring
Love me some Kravis 🥰 His house is phenomenal! So my style. 🤩
Beautiful home Travis. Thank you for letting us all in ❤ Tuning in from Ireland 🇮🇪🇮🇪 😀
He is so cool. I see why Kourtney married him. He seems so down to earth.
🥰😆
Love it 🤘🏻🖤
The entire vibe of not only the house but Travis is zen, chill, mature. I absolutely love it. Love he & Kourtney together 💚 Everytime he says matcha I smile lol 🍵
also i love how they got engaged on october 17th, my birthday!
Awww I'm so happy for Kourtney. Sometimes society makes it seem like once a woman has kids and passes a certain age nobody wants her. This is proof that it's a lie!
Blured poster: Banksy Explained Flying Copper, 2003 - Banksy Explained
his mothers rosary next to the "this smells like Courtney's orgasm" candle
Great to see amazing art in his collection like Banksy & Paul Insect
🥺🤌 beautiful home! Travis sounds like such a calm, clear, level headed person.
I never thought I would like Travis Barker but I really like him he is a dope individual. His house is beautiful and lived in and real he seems like an awesome guy.
Love this!🖤🖤
I've been a fan of kourt for years and she never been this happy in her whole damn life. Go KRAVIS
Your the most feminine rocker guy I've ever seen! 🤯 All worried about his organic mattress while simultaneously has tattoo ink in his skin from head 2 toe! 🤣 Wow this man kills me
Travis's look: 💀 Travis's voice: 😇🌞🌻🌸💐🌈💕
Wonder what she found in him
him and kourt are a match made in heaven! he's so chill and zen and healthy just like her!
His voice is so calm, no wonder Kourt is so crazy for him. He brings peace to her world.
I can't stand that these homes always look so sterile, a home should be lived in and look that way...
i love how calm he is! he’s got such peaceful energy ✨
Beautiful clean home.. he has such a kind.vibe to him.. so likable and well spoken. So happy for him and Kourtney..
They have a lot of common things
Rather elegant. I like this❤
I need a home with indoor / outdoor space, game room, music room, pool, movie room and amazing closet
Why did the pillow move on it’s own? 10:56 -11:00
Such a well thought out home
ONE OF THE MOST CHILL, RELAXING AND ENTERTAINING HOUSE TOURS I'VE SEEN!🔥🔥💯
whew!! Love the house and major name drops with music collabs!
He's got a beautiful soul with a youthful spirit. The house is so livable too. I like this house
It shows how introspective Travis is and how his home’s decor supports that.
This is my first time hearing Travis Barker Speak and I wasn't expecting him to sound like that lmaooo but on topic of the video, his house is BEAUTIFUL!
His home is absolutely stunning! It was so peaceful and full of family memories, energy, and all while being calm @ the same time.  He seems very chill, and absolutely loves his family, life, and fiancé so much! Thanks for the tour, AD & Travis B. :)
Travis may not seem pretentious but Kourtney Kardashisan sitting on that counter was so fake, I wanted to throw up.
He seems like such a good person.
2:35 ''eat delicious vegan food''. What a sweetie!!!!!!!!!! AAAHHHH!!!!
No blink stuff to show off?!?!
Why do I find Travis’ vibe so calming.  Kourtney looks so cute .Love them together !
Travis seems to be genuine!
This was a really nice tour and beautiful house. The house looks amazing and like a nice place to relax and chill. It's not over the top. Travis voice also sounds so calm and soothing while giving the tour- I love it
I really love his calmness 🥰 he should do some commentary. Oh those two are so cute ❤️❤️ congratulations 🥳
Such a beautiful home, car collection, and I love Travis’ spirit. ❤
He has such a nice voice. I’m so surprised by this.
Travis looks like a punk rock Ghostbuster.
What a nice guy! Home is wonderful.
He is so calm
I really like this home because it looks like people actually lives in it. Not like other homes that looks like a show home
I love the comfortable feeling of this house homey and calm . I love the decor only thing i would do is have plants.
Is this a IKEA?
I like and respect Travis Barker so much. Kourtney is a VERY BLESSED woman. Congrats!! What a BEAUTIFUL home. Hard earned and much deserved.
Travis 👏 give the matcha recipe
He gets paid for every time he says the word LIKE. That’s how he can afford a multi million dollar house .
He speaks well.
Never judge a Book,
I find it so contradictory that these celebrities cover themselves  in tattoos and eccentric clothes, and “25 BMX bikes”  and say they “love minimalism”, the contradiction is notable.
I see why she married him 🥰 he's like a breath of fresh air. He seems like such a calm laid back person. I love it!
Can y’all throw in some interesting unique houses once in a while? I skip most of these videos now when I see them on my feed. 🥱 Everyone in LA is the same according to AD’s vetting process. 🙄
Blind cave fish care more about this couple and their home than I do 🐟 #sorrynotsorry
He’s so sweet I can see why Kourtney has fallen for him. But I’m still against them tongue-ing each other in public. Too much.
Nice guy, super humble
“I don’t like too many people in my house”  *continues to marry a girl with a family Thats sooo big.*
the house is great but they are so boring together omg
Not at all what I expected, both he and the house seem really calm and down to earth, very nice and soothing.
He said his performance  for new years was prefilmed does he mean the performance  with Avril?
Travis sounds just like Kourtney ...
I love the revival of Travis. He looks so happy and like glowing. A
He is not lying. On the new episode of the Kardashians the seating arrangement was just as he said it was.
@Architectural Digest, I hope you feature G Dragon, Jennie Kim and T.O.P home in South Korea.
He's so dope just like most Aries moons.
House looks great,leather onesie is god awful
Everywhere you turn in this house 💀
Travis is my new favourite celeb after watching The Kardashians
All I can  think is "The rich are hoarders." This is why we have homeless and unfed children.
Apart from showcasing a beautiful home, Travis (and of course Kourtney too) have ASMR voices! 💕
Showing his cars reminded of me of MTV Cribs .. old times lol
I want to raid that closet OMG 😱i want all the vintage tshirt 😵ahhhhh
Calming voice, Serene beautiful home!
I like the way he says he doesn't like a lot of people in his home.  Love the way Kourtney is so chill and seductive -shows she'd being loved and taken good care of by her man.
He seems like an ordinary guy after all, despite his tattoos looks. Seems like they at least lived in the home. Why didn’t Kourtney at least dress up and put pants on for the interview, we’ve seen you all almost naked. Stop showing off, it’s not a sex interview idiot! His car collection seems dark? I don’t think you are a minimalist person if you have two wardrobes and a million t-shirts you might not wear! Why are the wealthy so arrogant? Maybe donate some of them to the needy? How many can one wear?
Rich people just chillin half naked on the kitchen counter drinking matcha with laptop in hand. Just another Monday morning!! 🤣😂😉
Why are the paintings blurred though
This looks pretty much like Kourtney’s house but I like this style
I see why Kourtney shot here shot lol. What a soothing, genuine, grounding spirit.
Didn't expect for someone like Travis to have a minimal home. Beautiful though! And I love listening to him speak. His voice is incredibly soothing.
Who the hell is this guy
Wow! Beautiful home.Travis has strong work ethic and sounds like a cool guy.
I don't know if it's just me but most of these houses do not feel like home. Ironically, the only thing that feels like home is Travis' voice! ❤️
Absolutely perfect
i think i know why Kourt is falling in love with Travis. The way that he speak, his voice and his personality.
He still looks 20.
Seems like a great family man and I'm happy for them
He seems like such a cool dad letting his kids ride dirt bikes in his home. His home is so beautiful.
How does a person sound so young and kind?
"Murder it out, and make it all black"  - travis barker haha
Best tour ever… So calm and chill, love it!
Love your home🤗🇨🇦
Kendall kourtney’s sister lol at this point we know who Kendall is. But it shows how humble Travis is 🤍
I feel so bad for judging this guy I thought with the skin head and tattoos he was a d but he’s so soft spoken and sweet!
This whole thing is staged and the vibe is stooopid
I have always been a fan of Travis since Blink 182 I'm glad he's found love and peace in his life now. He truly seems like one of the good ones
I see why Kourt fell in love
Love kourt for this vid.
I'll be right next door to them real soon in my modern *Boxabl* Casita Adobe style home! Can't wait to hear those drums 🥁 across the hill Travis!
The best house with the right esthetic ever on this channel. Love it!!! ❤️
There's something about Travis that makes it so hard to not like him
He has such a beautiful spirit
That Matcha station is 🔥
The candle lmao
Perfect house and perfect cars
Amazing! So peaceful.  Does anyone know where his Fireplaces are from pls?
Travis Barker is surprisingly soft spoken, and he really loves fireplaces. What a cool dude
He has the sweetest tone and demeanor 🥺
This dude ain’t punk
He’s so chill and talented. Love this for Kourt
Why was I so surprised by how beautiful it was
i thought it would be more interesting
He is the example of “don't judge a book by its cover”
So am I the only one that noticed the candle on the nightstand that says “smells like Kourtney’s orgasm” 😂😂 Love them both together. I’m happy they found peace and happiness with each other.
I like his house, simple, clean lines, unpretentious and spacious.
I don’t get the Travis hype,, & no hate but he looks like Voldemort💀
He’s so authentic and love how each room has a purpose. Great tour!
His home looks so serene, calming and comfortable. It gives the vibe that if you have children they can run around and jump on the couch and not be afraid that they'll break something.
No idea who he is, but the state of his body combined with how softly spoken he is, is really messing with me.
Was hoping to see if Scooter the fish was still in the house (MTV Crib throwback)
love the house. it's cool and modern while still being homely
he looks like a Peaceful guy..
Good job Travis, your are “art”
Oct 17th ✨✨✨ that’s my birthday 🎉
Travis is such a sweetheart.
he looks extreme but his voice is so calm..you can't bjudge the book by its cover..
Kourtney is really the twin of kris omg
Kourtney got her peace and I’m so happy for them 😌
Oh I loved this 😍😍😍
Him and Deven Booker are the most impressive Kardashian-Jenner boys They both have outstanding amazing houses
i never actually heard his voice. i love it! it’s so calming dude
I love ad so much I watch it at the gym
I really like how calm Travis is, the house is so lovely. And the way he explains everything awesome.
when he was talking about where everyone sits thats like my parents house we all sit in certain spots it never changes
I really wasn’t expecting his home to look like this. I’m pleasantly surprised!
Travis seems like the best dad, partner, friend. You can feel his grounding energy through the screen
Did anyone else notice the name of the candle’s scent on the bed side table or nah 🤣
I love this house. I see why Kourtney loves him. He appears to have a good spirit.
he seems like a nice, peaceful family man , and loves ping pong and match <3
I love that his house is minimal but functional. It feels like you don't have to be too precious around the furniture etc
Amazing! Love it. Was definitely not what I expected from his home
This is so different from his MTV Cribs.
never have a I ever heard in such a video a person to say 'we like to sit and eat delicious meat food' but vegans need to add vegan
Leather jump suit..... Ok
He’s such a humble guy. ♥️
Such a classic Clement Design
I LOVE how Travis is so chill and genuine. So happy for Kourtney. Long time fan of those 2. This house is amazing!
Travis is truly an All-American Young OG. Love it!
He sounds like Kourtney with all the vegan stuff
I need Travis to drop that matcha recipe, please!
Amei
Wow 🤩 it’s surprising how tranquil his house is. Love it
Right video at the right time!
I love His House so calm and serene
You are so CHILLED dude and that is AWESOME!!!✌🏽
@architecturaldigest where is the bed from? Thanks!
Closet looking like a Hot Topic lol. Beautiful home.
I LIKE him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love it,all the way from Kenya 🇰🇪
This is actually a masterclass in how to design with black, keep it masculine but not overly masculine. It’s a great balance of keeping it feeling homey and not cold while still having a strong black palette.
This house looks really familiar!!
Travis seems like a legit good person. Like really kind.
My God this is actually unwatchable 4 minutes in and I literally feel dumber.
This is a beautiful home! 🏡
I love how AD youtube has become the new MTV Cribs
This house is very basic for a rock star. Be honest travis, did the kardashians redecorate this house?
Did noone notice the candle on his bedside table? It smells like Kourtney’s orgasm and stands right next to his mother’s rosary box. https://youtu.be/KHfP3InQc94?t=627
💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗👍
I've been researching all this while for a digital asset to invest in and I found that crypt0 market to be the most profitable of them all,I'm definitely gonna bounce on it.
Love his energy, so peaceful
Such a cozy home 💕
The house and his vibe are perfect!
He’s seem sooo soothing and calming i can see why kourtney likes him he probably got her with the match 🥺😩💓✨
Wow... hot damn!!  I am so thoroughly impressed with the style of this home.  I am in love with it!  Travis was right to trust his designer.  I am into the minimalist vibe.. so this is gorgeous to me!  Great job.. and Travis comes off as a very hard worker and down to earth guy.  I'm really happy for them!
Great video, love how genuine Travis is
Never heard him speak... He Always looks quite freaky to me with his poses in pics lol Nice to hear him casually chat. Love the pool area..and the hallway and kitchen/lounge..not too big
Beautiful house and he’s so humble!
Travis is a really good person and I am happy for Kourtney she has found real true love far from the Kardashian PR machine. This feels so organic.
Perfect home for a living legend! Travis has been through so much! Love this for him!!!!
I wish they had shown the before pictures of the house because I can’t imagine this place looking any more drab and boring than how it does now. It doesn’t look cozy or lived in, the movie theater especially looks lifeless, and why show the cars, this isn’t MTV Cribs, lol.
I love how he’s vegan! And I love listening to him talk he seems so genuine🥰 I loved getting to know him more on the Kardashians! Also love his home lol and I love kourtneys home so this is hard to choose when they move in tg
i absolutely love that he never misses a beat when including his stepdaughter when he talks about his kids!
Courtney needs to do ASMR videos ASAP
Beautiful and cozy❤️
Thank you Travis for inviting us to your house
Nice to see Travis recycling his bin bags for clothing.
Kravis ♥️♥️♥️
Beautiful home ❤️
Anyone else see the kourtney candle
Lebron wants his gold bike back
The way he speaks ❤️‍🔥
Could someone explain to me, please,  why some paintings and sculptures are blurred?
Loveee
Nice
i loveeeee travis’ outfit its so cute
Cadê o Breno morreu pra reagir a isso aqui ?!?!
Travis 20 minutes before the camera arrives: "Babe! Which Jumpsuit should I wear for Architectural Digest today? My Shiny gold one or my black rubber one? I want to look really classy."
Kourtney seems so fake. I bet they are never in that house. Kourtney put on pajamas for the cameras.
His voice is so soothing and calming. The house reminded me of Kourtney's home.
Love him!!!
So pleasantly surprised by the warm & welcoming energy both him and his home has, love love love
I love how simple and natural it feels :)
It looks modern the only thing i like is the kitchen cupboards
Who convinced him to wear that 'thing'? Mood "leveler" in full effect
This guy is so in love with himself.
She got like 4 kids Travis saved a hoe chole is probably the only mayb wolesome one mayb
Nunca hubiera imaginado que alguien q yo admiraba como músico acabara con una kardashian.
Beautiful home and amazing story!
Travis is such cool guy. Love that for him ❤️ vegan squad
He’s soooooo chill! 🙏
Love how he talks about his kids. Travis seems like a great dad!
Extremely nice , very good taste and style
Not the biggest fan of the house but all the sentimental stuff in the house especially his bed room is really cute
this guy look creepy AF
Beautiful house but also what a nice guy.
What a humble man. Good for her
I totally get why kourtney love him  he is so lovely his calmness seems a kind soul to and he is good-looking I think .
Thanks for this
Love this home!!🔥🔥🔥❤️❤️❤️
Um, actuallyTravis, i'll have you know i pulled my back yesterday, and my husband bought me a $30 heating pad from Walgreens with vibrations on it. I have it on me right now so, uh, yeah, i could indeed imagine the vibrations on your organic mattress, thank you very much. LOL
He’s not punk
Fab so homely beautiful home
I love the streamlined, industrial minimalism.  The textures of the vases and woodgrain add interesting pops.  The art, books and Knick knacks show off the personality.  It’s definitely a specific look.
So humble 😌
cool duds
VEry nice house ...but i dont like so much white colour ...  in the kitchen .
I like this tour. Travis doesn’t seem pretentious like most I’ve watched before. Of course I know the house has been cleaned and staged for this tour but the way he described each room with the memory of his kids and family makes one think this house is well-loved. For being a minimalist house, it packs a lot of character and reflects his creative and calm vibe.
He gives me odd vibes.
This wouldve never happened without Kourtney. Her touches are all over the place.
One of thee best AD home & presentation I've seen thus far!! I loved it!!
Idk why would u spend godknows how many millions to get a bland, blank, cold, boring space filled with ikea-looking furniture but more power to him if that's what he likes I guess
love the vibe of this home so zen and chill but still feels homey 🧘🏻‍♀️
Ownn he’s soooo cute “babe what’s that movie that has the x in it, with the huge party?” Hahahahaha SO CUTE 💖🤲🏽✨
Yuck.tf… next..
wtf is he wearing? Magnum Condom?
Have to admit it I love his house! 👌🏻
10:57 the pillow moves
Okay first THAT OUTFIT! Its absolutely ridiculous 😮  But the home is absolutely beautiful with those nice calm tones, just stunning! ♥️
Boring house
NIce house, man.
Alternate Title: Inside bald tattooed Adam Levine's devine home with a side of loitering Kardashian 🤣
Why Americans celebrities love sharing each another.. One after another..
Ok, so the 5 albums I see are by Pink Floyd, Operation Ivy, Dr. Dre, but what are the other two? The house is pretty cool though, very chill aesthetic
Is he gay?
Has AD become Cribs?
Please edit any Kardashian out.
Massive congratulations guys 🎉🎉🇬🇧
Love looks so good on you two ❤️
Beautiful home❣️
Probably the only time Kourtney has looked bashful and giddy about being filmed 🥰
Minimalist, wonderful
Tranquil looking home 🥰
Congratulations couples ❤️ From 🇮🇳💥
0:00 I see Travis has a taste for garbage bags
The house is less strange than him.
Worst outfit ever. He now looks like a kardashian
Love this couple
Travis barker 🔥🔥
I’m first fook you all!
Such a nice home!
his voice damn
Congratulations couple 🎉👏👏❣️❣️
