Great golf enjoy
Audios terrible.
Tough crowd agreed!
Though youre a leader for now, you kinda feel uneasy when Tiger is sneaking at -4.😅
Lol why bother showing a tap in one foot putt as the only shot on the 18th hole.
Im doing my best David Feherty voice, but it just aint the same.
what a great round. Solid and accurate.
Congratulations on the worst highlights ever.
Always been a compact stocky golfer 💪
Without patrons and without commentators, we see golf for what it truly is: lonely, difficult, cerebral. The greens are a microcosm of the cold universe we inhabit, utterly indifferent to our existence.
I understand no patrons, but no commentating either?
How do they not show the approach shot on 2?
So bizarre with no one there
Love to see him do it.
Tough crowd
