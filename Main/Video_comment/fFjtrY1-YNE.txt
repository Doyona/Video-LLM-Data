Brother you ever think about doing interviews with certain people in the car world for further content? I think you and your father would be great at it.
What can’t Mat do lol.
9:11 “You need to build one now” 😁😍 Hannah is perfect😂
Take it he likes a Lotus then.
Being able to drift that well first time shows that Mat has a lot of mechanical sympathy, he treats the car with respect and it returns that respect, not spinning out. It's not just about fixing cars but having a genuine love for them
Steiner: I can’t afford a super car Also Steiner: looking to buy an f1 team
Mat Bossed that drifting and he's so humble about it
Great drivin' Mat, Formula 1 next.
This Scotish guy kinda funny english talk
Sending love from Arizona, USA I just found your channel and I absolutely love watching you Matt. It’s so refreshing to see Matt have some genuine wholesome fun. Rather than the typical US content I’m used to haha… You’ve gained a lifetime subscriber! 🖤
GO ON LAD!!!!! 10/10 from me!!!!!
The drifting lesson's in the M140i has finally paid off😂
Matt should get employed by McLaren F1 Team😮
Hey Marc Mcann!
Guenther is an ok guy.
Can I have  car have subscribed
The new build COMPANY is a blue and white monster
Any guesses on what car it is?
Any guesses on what car it is?
where are u Mat ? as we could do with a new video as its been well over 3 weeks ....
Now that was some wicked driving hear from the United States dang good driving mat
You need to get yourself a GTR and mod the fcuk out of it or even better a R34 SKYLINE!!!!!!!!!
impressive! so next project Nissan GTR
nice to Gunter was genuienly interested - great video mate
Matts concentration face...😂😂😂...brilliant
What a Gentleman Gunther , he is a true legend. He had time for Mat and asked questions , it’s what it’s all about. Formula 1 will miss him and fans even more. What Haas thinks he has is a joke.  Love you Gunther never change and congratulations to Mat for having him on the channel , these guys go where they want so it’s definitely a sign Mat that you are going up and up in the car world
Tokyo
Amazing drifting bro!!! 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻 Matt will b in the next To to drift Movie 🤣🤣😉👍🏻👌🏻
is it a E24
The blur looks an awful lot like something out of the ford lineage
Is it a bmw
I tip for protecting your wheels during transport are pool noodles. Thats what u use. I slip the straprs right through them. :) cheers
ive been addicted to those long 4 hours build videos, content is 10/10
you know what would be very challenging im not really sure, but to fix a @whistlindiesel wrecked car if it is even possible🙃
New car will be  a GTR rebuild
Maybe It is maybe a bmw m3 comp or audi r8 v10+
Is that tavarish’s and Mat’s Purple Porsche 17:25? Didn’t Mat say to ship the Porsche it is too expensive so he bought one in England and rebuilt it ?
The leak of mat’s new project              It is a red bmw M3. Btw sorry for the leak
Thanks for the great videos, and damn nice drifting. To bad you can’t get the Y-food shipped abroad to Sweden 😢
Guenther was the best part of Drive to Survive and F1. Really cool video man! Nice drifting too!!!
The other car a red m3 competition lol
A Toyota pick-up ??? Outrageous.
To stop the flikkering of LED lights you wil need 2 3OHM resistors on each side of the wire (1per wire)  it’s the same resistance as one bulb
Guenther is a legend
Have you ever had anyone from America win a raffle?
Sooo Cool, that was really enjoyable! 🥳👏🏼
Guenther is such a top bloke! (as of course are you Mat). I really hope to see him back in the fold very soon - and Netflix must be shitting bricks because Drive to Survive absolutely won't be the same without Guenther's unique way of 'telling it how it is'!
My dad was really happy meeting u there hope u saw his stand mstyle
The police YouTuber/ tiktok influencer showed a certain car and claimed it was your matt is that true? The colour of the vehicle might of been the same as this one 🚗
We need the LIMITED EDITION yfood in EU! Great video, Mat :)
Excellent channel
Mat can you restore gtr 35
your next build will be audi r8 2gen?
It's not easy to understand just make another Channel and you'll get everyone from the first subscribers to watch your videos the guy is filthy rich because of it ¿`_
I went ……. It’s soo good. I had a picture by your gallardo
I don't know what you did, Mat, but now I am prangent.
What  a lovely M3😮
Mat that was quite impressive 😂👏
🔥🔥🔥🔥
I may have missed it, but where is the Audi with crazy body kit?
Next project. MA drift car build 🙏🏻
The boy done good especially with camera pressure 👏
Its a thriller  my heart  felt that drift❤❤❤
Superb drifting Mat Armstrong 👌👌👌👌👌👌
I know mat what's your new project is. It's an audi R8 v10 plus
Yo Mat, are you thinking of buying an crash damaged gtr and rebuilding it?   loved your video
He forgot to mention that his Toyota costs over 100 grand haha!
Nice new m3 comp mat
sick build but worst sounding high power ls
Ordered my YFood!
Guenther needs his own show
BMW m3 competition build incoming 🫶🏻
When is yfood coming to the US?
Glad MacLaren's build quality hasn't changed 😂
Dam I forgot about Auto show. Maybe catch your show next year.
Makes me wonder. Is he going to move out of the states now? I wonder. I hope to see him at some races. Like Indy GP St. Petersburg... preferably.
Give him a contract!
As a U.S. viewer I’ve always wanted to try yfood hopefully it comes to the states soon!
Great video Matt. You look super comfortable in yourself and when talking with Gunther. it really came across. You were so confident talking to him and he was definitely enjoying talking to you. All your videos are Great dude. Even my wife who's not into cars enjoys watching 😂 Keep up the great work
Mat you looked absolutely sick letting that Porsche go…
Blur? Is it an AlBARN find? 🤪
10/10 driftage. Hell ya Guenther fellow Tundra driver!
We will miss Guenther next season, thanks for all your work and funny comments Guenther!! All the best in the future.
Fair play, that drifting was very impressive. I see an MA drift car on the horizon!!!!
Yep hope Guenther returns to F1, one of the most popular blokes in the paddock, good luck to him. Thanks for sharing drift king.. great video once again!..
audi r8 v10 plus
M4 baby❤
I legit paused the video to clap!! You did so damn well
YFood needs to make a pasty flavored one for your dad
At least we know he can fix it 😂😂
Przetłumaczył byś też tekst na Polski ..
Had to pause at 10.30 so say Mat your a G. That was sick mate
F1 won't be the same without Guenther.  Best principal by far.
Sooooo. Were not allowed to mention what your new project is?.... i saw it at the show ... looking forward to it, thats all im saying
Tesla model 3 drifter
Not got a clue we're I am with these videos muggled up to f😢ck
M3 Competition is the new car in red as well.😉😉
anyone know his project car?
DDE : FEELING JEALOUS 😌🤣
The racing simulator help you 😂
You can tell Mat is having a good time in the GTR when he sounds scratchy from all of the yelling and laughing :)
Mat can you teach me how to fix cars the right way for I can fix them n keep them like you
The secret car is a m3
Tidy job drifting Mat!
Is next project the blue Audi R8 you bought few weeks ago?
Congrats on the M3 my guy!
why Baggsy looks so worried on the passenger seat? not used to be passenger or worried for the car? great job on that Drift!
lol I like how you blurred it blue when it’s clearly red and well battered…
The Cayman was the first project I followed on your channel!
Guenther was a right character in the f1 paddock will be missed hopefully he be back
Next car is BMW M3 COMPETITION IN RED. One person shows your car before you 😢.
I think the secret car is a bmw m3 comp
is that yours/freddys porsche in the back ? 17:25
i can´t get the yfood in Germany :(
Chap,you are living your best life!!!
he now wants a gtr along with all of us i bet
The bmw was already leaked but George’s car media
BMW fans boys will be happy that is the next clue for the next project
Wait what? What does the purple GT3 do on your backyard :D
When you get per issuance to build one then that has to be an up and coming build 100%
One of the best noises from a car, straight cut gears 😍Drifting looked hella good too
i was waiting for mat to crash the GTR for him to rebuild it. lol
well done MA
Known Baggsy since he was drifting a 340 Volvo. Lovely bloke and humble still.
Next car is an M3 Competition?
Well done Mat, that eightturn was impressive.
You need to do a GTR or even a mean pickup truck
That was so, so good! Wow and that he only let you drive it other than him as well! Awesome Matt, phil
Great video Matt and quality drifting 😊👌
bmw m3
Looked like you wanted to cry wen he left with the Porsche ? You have fallen in love with the Brand lol me to . South Africa is big on Porshe and they are same as UK , right hand drive .
I’m going to miss Gunther Steiner in Formula 1. He’ll be able to have more time for his truck. 👏 I’m quiet attached to my Nissan Navara, I find truck life is very addictive😀
I’m on the YFood now too. It’s great
Ohh he’s an excellent driver 👏👏👏
M3 Comp
Matt we didn’t know you could drift like that 🔥🔥🔥
14:15 hes judges your decisions 😭😭
the audi is the secret car?
The drift car sounds like Mr. Blobby
Mat is the new build a urus
“He does not f*** smash my door” ❤
That Porsche will be back in the Garage soon. I hope he takes care of it. I had a Lotus Elise at 21 and it was a Knightmare to insure. Dinged it in the first year of ownership driving in the wet at night 😢. got it repaired and kept it for another 10 years. Great car.
That wasn’t Gunther .. I didn’t hear one single F bomb
going to miss Guenther
Love guenther he's a legend !! Such a shame haas have sacked him!! Sure he won't be out of a job long
Matt, you are an absolute inspiration! The way you interact with people (public or famous) is superb. Easy going, funny and enthusiastic! Your cars rock mate!
toyota tundra... hahahaha... gunther is SO oool
New hoodie Mat! Nearly... is an exaggeration!
Such an amazing ride to win! Congratulations!
13:25  There. I have saved you +10 minutes.
nice! good for you Matt, getting one of the last Guenther interviews while at Haas. Miss you already Guenther
Congratulations to the winner When I come to the UK, I'm winning aswell
brooo thats like 500 000 points on underground 2
Its a bmw in orange blurred
A GTR build would be sick!
Damn is that a G80 M3 ?
Yfood don't ship to United States?
🔥🔥I men youtuber🔥🔥🔥 मै युटुब पर हूं Mera free fire ka chnil h 🔥🔥मैरा फ्री फायर का चैनल है🔥🔥 Mere chnil se aap ki help ho sakti H  मेरे चैनल से आपकी हेल्प हो सकती है🔥🔥
Hats off to Steiner for being so public after his dismissal! He's a great guy, so nice for him film with you. Matt you're a great entertainer! Nice drifting!
MAT DID NOT DISAPPOINT!!
Met you at the auto show, made my day 10 times better, thank you for signing my tag, it will forever live on my keys! Excited to see the new project, looks like its going to be a hard one 😅🤣
Give me a car plz
An 'irrelevance of influencers.'
I once bought a drink when someone put their name on it................. when I was twelve.
v8's are so easy to drift .. so much torque with that longish wheelbase ... just so lazy and controllable... was fun seeing you get around in it
I can't possibly imagine why, but all I can think of when I watch this is that scene in Dennis the Menace with Mr. Wilson's chicklet dentures.
The noise from that gtr 🤩
M5!
Mat you need to build a drift car now youre such a natural
Guenther legit looks like one of them chuckle brothers 🤣
Volts Wagon rabbit or toyota supra
Quality. Absolutely put the drifting lads to shame!! Amazing effort
m3 competition build coming soon
GTR incoming..
Hi matt i'm so sad that i cant buy your yfood i live in germany 😢
Matt FIX MY CAR PLEASE 😢😢😢😭
Seriously impressive Mat 😮😂😂
Mat and Guenther - two legends!!
had a crap few days, but that has made me smile. Thank you
M3 g80
Sure the new car is a bmw m3 competition🫣
R8 V10 😬
did LZ leave a bag of drift skill in that GT3! well impressed!
Next car an Audi
DK!
When’s the Corvette build, clue was on the drink 😊
The rear of the BMW is fucked the same thing as the Porsche
the problem with this Chanel is that theres just not enough full builds! what you need is to find yourself on a couple of alternate universes and get into building PLENTY🤩🤩🤩
Why are you trying to rebuild an M3 comp?
Looking forward to seeing you continue this build, Mat. What you’ve done and attempted on this McLaren so far is nothing short of amazing. Keep up the good work my Dude!  Btw, I accidentally clicked on a video thinking it was yours about your new secret project vehicle, so now I’ve spoilt the surprise for myself. Damn! Either way, now I’ve seen it, it’s going to be one hell of a project.
Impressive drifting Mat 🤩
Too bad I cannot get it Mat  They won't ship the product to USA
Why another channel?
I’m guessing you bought another BMW just by the face you made
The "blur" is a bmw m3
Took my boys to the show on the Saturday looked up at the screen and saw the massive grin on your face as you drifted around the arena. The queue for your stand was long but bought my lads some merch. Favourite car of the show was your black Lambo. Can’t wait to see the first video on the blur
Can just imagine how happy Gav is that he’s made it in the video 😂
Awesome drifting! 👏 ..  Freddy’s purple Porsche outside HSC?
Is that yfood stuff actually healthy? Is this not some ultra processed food?
Next car is a GTR
Brilliant my mouth was open while you were drifting as well 😛
Guenther is a legend. We'll never see his like again in F1.
Next build - Audi R8 !!!
Its a bmw m3
Guenther is a top bloke, he will be back in F1 somewhere I hope ! We need characters like him 😂, well done on the drifting 👍🏻
13:24
Bmw m2 👌
Günther is a solid guy. Good drifting by you Mat. Keep up the wholesome content. Greetings from Munich, Germany.
Guenther is such a legend, nice to see him outside F1 business. Hopefully we see him back in some leading role in future, thanks Mat for getting the "interview" with him!
Gtr r35
I love how each project your not afraid to try something new you didn’t know about. If the new car in n/a you should do a turbo add on with you doing all the work yourself. Maybe not the exhaust but you hooking it all up. Add another thing to the list of more things you can do. Would be a fun part to watch on a build playlist! Cheers!
I know what the car is lol!!! It's a Red BMW G80 M3 front/side smashed up aswell as other damage!! I need a work on Maclaren video lol!! 😂❤😊
New build an Audi R8
Guenther looking at that mclaren thinking someone really foksmashed that
As usual you impressed us with your skills, from BMX flips to GTR drifts. Awesome show. Ever thought about getting an accident damaged car in South Africa, that Pound to Rand rate could probably get you a fleet 🤣🫶
My freind Jacob met Mat Armstrong got his autograph and got a picture with him 😯😲😲
Mat's new build is a bmw m3 competition 🎉(infact a red m3)
he fixed his teeth hhhhhhhhhh
Too bad the 10% off is UK only and not world wide. I would like to try yFood. Greetings from the Netherlands
Porsche
🔥🔥🔥
GUENTHER WE MISS YOU😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
New car is a crashed GTR
Amazing Mat. From working on an Audi TT on a restaurant parking lot to be meeting EX F1 drivers and working on super cars. Amazing journey you have had!
Is yfood going to be available in America soon?
New Project is the BMW M3 or is this a different one?
I did not know you were that good at dirfting😅
New build ///M drift car
You need Monster as a sponsor 🙂
Nice one Mat, really impressive how well you handled a pro drift car and without your specs too!
Well good drifting Mat! 10/10!
Definately got the feel for drifting Mat 🙌🏼 GTR build is imminent 💯
13:25 for Guenther
You absolute legend
Throwing that car about like its his BMX.. Respect
well that was impressive
22 plate red M3 it got put on tik tok bro
MaboY Mat Sunder The McLaren Piece's 🧩🧩🧩 And Build it Again Like A NASA Engineer 😁👑👏👏👏

Bro the next build is a AUDI R8 😳 😐
One thing about the title he was not an f1 boss he was team principal
matt is a celeb now. but he is the most down to earth celeb that loves his mates and spoils his family with no holds barred. Love the fact that ur a real dude Matt. Dont ever change mate.
😄
U are a true fucking hero mat 🥂🙌🏻🇸🇪🙏🏻
what happend to his voice
R8 blue one
m3 bmw the secret blue car
😂 awesome hope he takes good care of it 💯👏🏽
I want to be very clear here. I am not putting anyone down for liking these cars.  I personally do not get the point of spending money on a supercar. To each their own, but I never got the point of spending $150k+ on a car that will perform just as well as a Toyota when following the rules of the road. Saying you have a car that is 1000HP doesn't mean anything to me when I cannot use 1000HP. Now I know people go to tracks or just like the attention, or they just flat out break the laws of the road. However, a Toyota Camry and Lambo are the same thing other than looks when you are going 65mph on an interstate. A matter of fact, the Toyota will last a lot longer.  Once again, this is just my opinion and I respect those who love these cars. I have been working on cars my whole life and can say that a Toyota is the best car you can buy if not racing or looking to show off the looks of a car.
Porsche GT3 new build
Gunther X DDE NEEDS TO HAPPEN MAN. DAVE AND DEMON DOING CRAZY DOUNTS  would be crazy.
Love Gunther great guy and honest comments 😅😅👍👍
Me after 10 years of snow drifting on various cars thinking I could do that.
Yo mat lots of people seen gcm post the reveal of the car and I am so excited to see you rebuild it
Saw the new car at the show, it's a red G80 M3.
Where is the rs6 ?
REVEAL THE G80 ALREADY
matt armstrong 10/10 for the drifting in the gtr drove amazing!! next build drifter😊😊😊😊
Nice and you can tell you are under the weather
Dudes killing it in that r35
Your drifting - surprisingly well! Awesome video as always. Guenther is a humble person - all respect for him.
looked very reluctant to see that porche go after all that work
That was genuinely impressive driving!
Wasn't expecting you to drift that well. I wonder if the concrete floor helps with a nice even predictable traction?
So so so good 🎉 you make my dreams in real live🎉🎉🎉🎉
Is it a Porsche GT3 RS maybe lol
Guenthers genuinely excited to see mat doing good is great !
is that the same purple porche he rebuilt behind the subscriber? 17:33
Someone already leak his new car before his video come out
New build is an r8
We all love GS!!! He'll be back Wankors
Get some loop over straps. You've got the holes in the bed of the truck for them. Much ore secure and no risk of damage to wheel faces.
soo... the next one is a GTR?
wicked episode
Im sure I've seen it somewhere else. If it's the one I think it is, love German cars 😂😂 a few German manufacturers so I'm not giving anything away I hope lol
Mat's gonna be buying that Porsche back and rebuilding it again within 6 months haha
you need to build one now!!!!!!  thats permission Matt.. get on it sunshine
Tj hunt where you at 😂😂  Matt is better drifter than you 😢
How much would I like to see you take on an old classic like a mk1 escort Ot a mini 1275 and work your magic
is the RS6 still stuck out in Florida?
New build is r8
Great job matt
THE NEW CAR IS A G80  I THINK
please no bmws anymore.
its an Audi r8 v10 2.gen
i have question. why the purple porsche gt3 was there
Guenther is an absolute legend... top top bloke.
You made the drifting look easy!!!! Great driving
new build....... Audi R8💪🏾
Audi r8
Next car BMW M3 😎
R8
As the bodyshop in question we can only attribute the McLaren delay to Mat’s crazy ideas and McLarens’ ingenuous and straightforward panel design 🤣
Why did I have the biggest smile on my face when you done that figure of 8 😂
I can't get over that yfood sounds like wifu
Grande Gunther. Un altro grande italiano che ne sa moltissimo di auto e corse
New car I recon will be a r35 gtr
Doesn’t Gunther own or is a partner in some sort of carbon fiber development company.
I reckon your new build is going to be a Red BMW M3.
Awesome driving as usual Mat, i'm waiting for the sequential drift car to come to the channel. Would also love to see a Jeremy Clarkson collab ;)
Wow incredible mate 👍living the dream
Well-done still loving the show😊.. just ordered the y-food... I'm a builder who sometimes miss out on dinner .. this y-food works.. keeps me going all day  👏
I was at the nec on Thursday and saw the cars there
Wow how much was that young lads insurance on the Porsche 😳😂😂 I’d love to know!
Saw you at the show you looked liked you loved it 😂
its a audi r8 that hes going to release
That engine will look lovely inside a BMW E24.
When you said "I hope he doesn't crash it" I instantly imagined you doing an intro for a video about rebuilding a crash damaged Cayman S.... for the second time 😂
this shits crazy, nice drifting bro
Make a drift car project!!!
the new build is a Audi R8 cyan blue color
Matt’s got a blue GTR
New project - drift car?

GTR
18:00 how did he get insured on that car at 21???????
Hey Matt, what manufacturer makes a blur? And what model of blur is it? I couldn't find anything on Blur lol! In all seriousness though keep up the good work my friend, appreciate you guys!
Gunther is a legend
Natural talent! Great video mate, hope you get better soon!

Great driving but sort the chin out looks like your gurning
I think the new project is a bmw m3 😊
Audi rs blurred out there
If I was anything to do with Netflix & Drive to Survive series I’d hire Guenther .. He’s one in a million just like Mat …  Maybe build a supercar pickup together!! 😂
Like a 6 year old kid on Christmas day 😂
What a legend and now even Guenther knows of you and your work, Mat Armstrong's name is in the stars!!!

Can’t get yfood in Australia.. 😢
23psi for bald eagle conversion
cool!
I think you need to find a crashed GTR!
"Ouhhtooo Spoort Show" 😂
Banana means a Mercedes ?
A GT-R without the original V6 engine is not a GT-R!
Matt, i saw someone leak the new project car. All I can say is that it's orange
Anyone know the location. It’s fooking massive.
Cannot stand  the camerman jumping in with irrelevant comments and laugh
Drifting is more of something I would enjoy watching more than doing but i do want to race on a track Matt cold wit it though so I need to see more drift and race content
bmw m3 a red one actually
What’s it with these BMX YouTubers knowing how to drift
Hope the flu gets better. Bro you having the time of your life😂😂 Am starting to question when do you get the time to fix up the videos
Good drift skills and nice to see Gunther. He seems like a good guy.
its a blue m4 comp someone leaked it on tiktok
Each episode is getting better and better, you have a gift to constantly surprise your watching audience. It's amazing what you've accomplished with your effort and tenacity.
New build bmw m series
Moral of the story don’t let ur missus kill ur dreams 😂
m3
Way to go! Mat the 'drift king'. You  were grinning like a Cheshire cat .😁
Rebiuld a gtr
i bet the next car is am m3 competition 2023
I was at auto sport international on Sunday, didn’t expect to see you there either. Went over because I heard the police mustang. Was good to meet you
BMW g80
It is audi R8 if im nt wrng
Thumbnail tells why you always wear hats 😊
Notice how there's happiness all over Matt's face while he's driving the drift car, but also a determination to drive the weapon properly and not be a complete nutter about it.
That mark dude is a bell end
MK2 channel content is legit.
Well done. Good driving matt
Mat you seems very tired! don't forget to rest! we need you full of energy mate!
Wait, what is that massive building you were driving in???
New build is a URUS
Haas Team will suffer not renewing Guenthner's contract, you just don't let a guy run that built the F1 Haas Team, I hope they take him back,  nice drifting BTW
You didn't slam his door, didn't you?
Love the drifting mat and also just ordered some limited edition yfood 👊🏻
New build a g80 m3? 🤫
That is not the real Guenther Steiner, there was no 'fookin' swearing
Guenther is legit a Rockstar.
BMW m 5 red sore it on everyone tick tock
This is like Tokyo drift Mat practicing the Pow Over 😀
BMW M3 G80
13:30 what is that? It's a MATTlaren
The audi r8
the fact that Haas didnt let Guenther be able to say goodbye to his fellow employees just makes me even more sad. Haas is going to suffer greatly
Not a hard guess when a tik toker revealed a red M3 on your flatbed. 😂
Congrats!!! Too often we eat junk when we need a quick replacement. That's huge you got your name on the bottle.
Get this man a drift contract!!!!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Build a drift car matt 👌🏼
New build is a bmw m3 comp
Some guy on tik tok posted a wrecked M3 competition, is that your new build?👀
What a win at 21.... hope it goes well for the young lad
A red m3 g80
Mat sounds like he's just had a wild night out 😅
Güenther driving a Tundra🤘 class act. Hopefully we see him back in F1 soon.
How very generous of you Matt to give the Porsche away. You’re a good soul👍🏻🫵🏻
Why no helmets I thought u have to to do that?
Guenther is a legend, so cool to see him on the channel.
That Gtr is Super well tuned for Drifting... What kind of secret recipe inside it? Btw Mat really need to build Gtr rights now 😂
Matt is a quick learning drift understudy! KUDOS!
Secret car guess, has a M badge on it.
"do i need to put this on straight" 🤣🤣
Guenther!!!
The more I watch Mat, the more I am genuinely impressed with him. He seems like a legit stand up guy that works extremely hard. No fake BS for videos.
What that hell was that?! I love this kind of stuff!! Lovely men!! Nice work  Regards from Mexico 🇲🇽
Bro favourite super car is meclern so I am so hurry to see it
Saw the new project on someone else’s social media but don’t want to spoil your surprise
new build is an AUDI R8😅
“Ex F1 boss” 😔
Just glad Gunther isn't trying to f**K everyone in the paddock 😂
is yfood a thing is usa?
Impressive drift skills. I’d love to see MA drifting at the Freedom Factory with Cletus.
Guenther is very familiar with crashed cars with carbon fibre 😂
BRILLIANT VIDEO AMAZING DRIFTING MATE 👍👍👍🔥🔥🔥
A random Guenther was not what I was expecting in this video but that was a lovely conversation! Seems like a nice dude!
U may have created a monster not gonna be long before matts trying his hand at drifting he looked good though a natural
Crazyy drifts for sure absolutely nuts!!! I've been trying to get my Audi a7 Sportback supercharged with some modifications out to a track this might've pushed me to do it quicker great vid.
Nissan GTR for the new build??🤔🤔
Guessing the new build is a bmw m4
The new project is a BMW folks.
Just casually chilling with Gunther...  _Nice_ Wicked driving.
Does yfood ship to the US??
I put a turbo on my 1999 bmw E38 its getting 460 bhp now and doesnt affect the car ,its lush and looks standerd .
No way r35
Your title of your video doesn't match your video
May hope all is well….Looks like you were under the weather in this video. Keep up the great work.
Gunter looked like he was having flashbacks while talking about the chassis damage
"it's more healthy innit"
TikTok spoilt the reveal 🙈🙈
Omg LOL 😂 SPOILT YOUTUBERS money lol. Matt we love you but I gotta say it about the rest. It’s not hard to rebuild a car and film at the same time. But risking putting down the main job and putting the work into YouTube risking a real honest job ??? That’s a different life.  Some people ain’t born into a settled life with good parents. All I gotta say is don’t act like an entitled YouTuber as I’ve seen in this video. This isn’t about you mr Armstrong, because I think your AWSOME. It’s other YouTubers that’s carry themselfs as something special
This is one of my favorite videos of all time.  And the thumbnail has me in stitches.  So funny it’s glorious.  The next level has just gone supernova greatness.  Wildly entertaining due to the humor.  Comedy meets cars.  Better than Seinfeld.
I was very impressed with the drifting!
Hi mat I think might be a Audi R8 in blue 🤔
Well done mate, bloody proper job drifting for the first time in a professional drift car
His building a bmw g80 M3
Orange m3 new build some one uploaded video of it
That red g80 m3 looks sick. Can’t wait for build
Well dun matt 👏 👍 👌
Good thing is if Mat smacks anything "I know a guy thats got a shop. Fix you up in no time."
Always great to see Guenther 😊
Oh my god I thought at 12:50 you we're saying "Waifu" not "Y Food" the whole time😭
Stick to what you do best and what made your channel successful. Don't pull a Tavarish.
Owning a car like that at 21 is almost impossible. The insurance costs, the rego cost, the maintenance costs, the fuel costs. Good luck to him.
Guenther 🤩
2022 G80 M3 Competition !?
Literally everyone loves Guenther. That isn't hyperbole
So, when I lived in Europe, I would buy bottles of banana juice from the store, here in the US I have never found such a thing.
Mat gonna be in the next Gymkhana if he keeps this up, And I’m genuinely in for it.
Well done 👍👍
I actually walked to the live action arena after missing all the live stuff (paid for a paddock pass ticket and missed the whole thing, yes I am stupid,lol) but had the chance to sneak in and saw Matt and Baggsy drifting the car when everything was closing, what a sight. Plus Matt I don’t know if you remember me but was the lad who asked you how to be more confident when working on cars during your showcase by your stand. You’re an absolute legend dude and the merch is top quality❤️
That car is coming back only to be fixed again 😂
Is that "freddies" GT3 in the background?
Awesome drifting Matt! A new hobby? Hi from nz bro!
New build is a g80 M3
Who else is going to go buy a Monster and some Yfood
I was at the event. Bluey I can reveal is a Vauxhall Corsa GS. Sorry to spoil it for everyone 🤣😜 Can’t wait for it to be revealed!!!!!
1:53 in. My guess is a gtr 😊  Update at 9:26 - the next car is a nissan gtr that mat is building into a drift car
The collaboration we needed, not the one we deserved. Fok Smash
…IN THE WORLD 😂😂
That gtr is insane 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥. Defo have to get one build next mat❤❤❤❤❤. Always stay blessed in life 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Fantastic to get Guenther on (did you tell him not to swear 🤣🤣). His latest book read by him as an audiobook is absolutely hilarious!!
Way to go Matt 👍👍💯💯
haas did him dirty did not even let him say goodbye to the team hes been with since it started without guenther haas would not be a thing
gtr next i think
Everyone is giving Mat Kudos for the drifting, but the cameraman did a cracking job in following the car
G80 m3 new build?
Do a Lexus LC 500
Considering mat Armstrong says I winging it learn as U go U done so well mate seriously good on you I've followed since the Bentley proper don't miss anything fantastic keep it up 🎉
Way to go in the gtr! Epic drift!😮
You have to come to the usa and do a project car here and do a raffle here as well.
@matarmstrongmk2 would you know where I can get the front splitter and  diffuser you have on your AUDI RS???
Amazing and impressive with the drifting Mat. By the blob, it looks like a BMW?
That GTR is an absolute animal of a car! Props to you! Also really looking forward to "the blur"! 😂
Man!!! Gunther Steiner, that was awesome!... And Mat, that was some badass drifting, truly enjoy your channel. 🎉👍🏾💪🏾
Guenther is from all angles a strait shooter you get no bull from him and I know he has had a difficult time running the team on a shoestring budget with minimum investment on actual make your own parts, just buying what you can from Ferrari is never going to give you a fully competitive front running car. Fantastic drifting Mat.
new build is  Audi R8 blue in colour
Great job bro. I was a bit scared at the beginning. I thought I was going to see that car on the wall but thank God you have great handling skills.
Next car a BMW?
why you have tattooed kevin name in arabic ?
You don't experience that every day ex f1 boss Gunter Steiner, you'll just be 🏎️ next to it💕💕💕💕💕
I have a feeling the "blur" is actually a Lamborghini urus😁👁️👁️
secret car that cairo the clout chaser clickbaiter has already revealed for you 🤣
Your  new  project  is a BMW
Ciro already posted your M3 :)
Steiner drives a tundra! Man know's what's up! Picked the perfect truck! :D
A  new project will be audi r 8 ?Mat bought damage r8. I saw on different Channel.
Is the new car a banana yellow ferrari 488?
Those gears sounds❤
AMAZING VIDEO . Wonderful drift session, no car was broken . The F1 BOSS is too old now . He just need a giant SUV or pick up .The beautiful GT4 is gone  and another Porsche enter your car park.
OMG i'm gonna miss Guenther on the Paddock! Top Bloke! Gene Haas lost a good leader.
The Skyline sounds like an electric car its mad! is the the drivetrain making all the noise? Amazing
Yes Mat! Sick drifting!!
The best video!! My favorite now.. Mat driving like a God and talking about rebuilding a McLaren with a F1 engineer... I'm amazed 🤩🤩
New build bmw m3 😉
10:16 what a great job drifting!! Mat you are insane!! That was fun to watch.
Amazing drifting skills!! Can I ask where you got the black and grey Jordans from? I’ve been trying to find those for ages.
New build is An audi r8 i know i know
Well done matt your face was a picture while drifting another great vid
Poor Matt, clearly gutted at the car drive away. It simply enhances the passion you clearly have for the car. I drive a VW Tiguan and I get excited about the heated steering wheel.... ATB
You dont really have to put "EX Boss" in the Title, everbody knows the legend Guenther Steiner, greetings from south tyrol
NO F*CKING WAY !!!!! YOU HAD GUENTHER IN YOUR VID!!!!! It's sad gene haas f him 😑, and no it won't help haas at al.  I REALLY hope we stil get to see him around F1😢
What a video. You made me smile from ear to ear the whole video. Absolute legend and inspiration 🙌 💙 👏
GUENTHERRRRRRR!!!! 💙
You drifting and Guenther...epic 😊
Mat, is there any chance the Yfoods limited addition? you never said. You got to build your own drift car after that buddy. Brilliant!!
GTR! GTR!GTR! 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
Looks like you were struggling there Mat, suspect you might have had tonsillitis (not a Dr, just a previous sufferer)? But fair play, you nailed that drifting!! Great vid and interview with mr Haas too. 👏
Holly fuck. Matt you really know what we need don't you? I think all ex top gear kids are broken in the exact same way concerning cars and motorsport. I was almost emotional watching guenther pop out of nowhere. I dropped everything I was doing as soon as I saw the thumbnail on my phone and sat on my desktop to watch this.
Nice little video Mat. Did I witness that gutted face as the Porsche was pulling away lol always room for more toys and giveaways 😁
Matt you should take up drifting, come over to Ireland get in touch with James deane or drift games and come over when Adam lz is over for a bash you woukd love it
Hahah we already seen it m3 competition
Guenther is cool!!
Is mat's voice cold😂😂?
Not George’s car media leaking the new project 😬
Full on dude!
Respect!!
You met a legend there Mat. Wow.
Great video. 👍👍👍👍👍
You could see Matt was sad to see that car go!  But he’s got his Dream Porsche Now! Well until a better one comes along! 😂
It was so lovely to finally get to see you in person, and grab a selfie! I was the lad with the Aston Martin jacket and massive camera :)
Your new m3 is all over tiktok so can't hide it anymore 😅
Yoo anyone else got DK vybz from tokyo drift when mat was doing the figure 8 love to see it 💯 💪 ❤❤❤
Bmw m3 sport
Hope guenther can get a spot some where else
Audi R8
I would have put it in the wall for sure 😂
Would love to see a G80 being rebuilt. Hope I recognized the shape correctly
Mat should get a wildcard invitation to driftmasters after his performance haha
Mat: “we can’t show the car on this video”  Petrolheadonism: “hold my instagram video”. JK I know Ciro asked you if he could share. 😂  I’m psyched to have seen what’s coming though! Love an orange car!
New build is an m3 comp has to be ! 2:19
When you started the figure of 8 is when you looked like you got comfortable. Think you need a drift car now Mat. Have i missed a vid on the merc? Waiting on Tony to fix it? Last i saw he drove it with the clutch not working...
BMW M3 comp g80? in red cant wait
New car blue Audi r8
Guenther needs a job let’s get him on the channel 😂love him sad loss in the F1 world
Respect for getting Guenther on - such a good bloke!
A red bmx is next
Are you kidding me Mat? You got Günther?? Can this channel get any better??
what terrible sound for a car lol.
Actually scared for the draw winner... at 21 I was not safe in my citroen, god knows how he'll stay safe in the porsche
Nice video's keep on going with your work and you tube channel.
Good man didn’t even boast about doing his own programs in the USA go,on and driving shit man bet that was dodge as fuck but u banged it out yes 👍🇬🇧🛒🔜🙏❤️🎥🚀🌍🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Armstrong
Lots of love from nepal
BMW m3 banana comp😂
I think that the new car is the newer generation Audi R8 that Matt bought of another YouTuber?
I like how we all thought Mat’s dad would be as biased about the drink, but rather questioned whether it was healthy or not 😂😂😂
Know you got an m3 🤨
G80 COMP Ftw
I think the new car might be a BMW M3 G80 or something similar
He's got the bug now 😂😂😂 next car...drift build!
Is the next car a red bmw by any chance 🤔 😂
this gtr sounds pissed off :D
on the search of a broken 35 gtr i bet
Drift car build incoming!!
How on earth is that processed drink more healthy than a cooked pasty?
It's a bmw. Already been shown on nother channel 😂😂
2:32 . He wears glasses. And is ginger, 😂😂 it shows 😂😂🎉
Very impressive... Your just a natural 🤣 just ordered my limited edition yfood 👍

Hi Mat i think you need to take care of you self and take a rest ❤
Well done 👍

Why u blur the Red G80 M3?😏
BMW M3 CS
respect guenther
I just noticed you have the name "Kevin" tattooed on your hand in Arabic. what's the story behind it?
new project is a bmw m3 or m4 g80
The new car is a red BMW M3 😁
Much love from America 🇺🇸  I love how proper speaking the English are Englishmen “ Yeah, that’s quite nice.” American “ This is quite Fukn nice”  😂
Please, not another crappy porche 😢
the red bmw m3
Anyone else sweating buckets when Mat was drifting the GTR , so close but well executed   Can't wait for the M3 build
Matt - shows how piece of piss it is drifting .. with that much Castor angle  - nothing special. No idea why people get wood with these guys. Guenther looking for a job>? now he's unemployed
Start of the vid you sound as if your baws are mid drop hahaha
Big Matt fan but definitely clicked for Guenther. Hope he comes back to F1 eventually
SPOILER!!! It’s a BMW
M3
Brand new project red m3 yh
The new build is a cls63 amg
YYOOOOOOOO the drifting and then getting to talk to Guenther Steiner is so sick ahaha
Now you can drift a slick surface let's see how you drift on something more sticky. 😉 as far as I'm concerned that's cheating 😅 watch Australian drift we do it on sticky surface we like to smoke it up ❤ we need to know what happens and how to pull out of when a car bites back with grip and avoid those walls. (always sideways)
11:30 Thanks for letting me be the first to try the yfood. Can confirm it does infact taste like bananna 😂
BMW m3 or m4 or something? Love to se a bmw m car again
The smile on Matt's face
I saw that blur, and by the shape I think it's a VW Beetle. I could be wrong but i don't think so...
Got to love Guenther, I'll miss him on the grid. 😢 loved the drifting. 👏
You should give guenther a job helping you repair cars
Went on Thursday with college, seen the cars but didn’t see the new project 😢. But keep up the work love the vids and good drifting!
Mat has good insticts when it comes to drifting, his transitions in the figure 8 were great
Drift build next on the channel? 🙏🙏🙏
what a great channel, love it. So sorry we non-UK-ers can't join the raffle. But good luck to those who do win it.
Too bad people leaked what your next car will be
You mentioned you want a GTR. Theres a new recovery place opened near me in Tamworth UK. From what i can see, it only has front end damage. Potential R35 GTR rebuild series????
Hanna, best girlfriend ever “maybe you should build one”. That’s the words of a keeper!!
Power Slide +90000
Has Gunther fok smashed the panels off the McLaren!?!?🤣
Yes Matt you smashed that drifting.... loved meeting you all saturday and saw the reveal of the new build cant wait for it mate hope your feeling better than you was on saturday bud 👊🏼👍🏼
Sad that’s all only in UK :( YFood and Car raffle it’s easy to do it in Europe too. I hope in the future. Best regards DFAN from Germany
Simple...two top blokes
Great effort drifting Mat, looking forward to my y-food arriving
Your New project BMW M3 G80 wow 🤩
Can’t wait to see the blur
Mat was so close to saying ‘Thanks so much for watching…’ to Guenther! 16:31
The blur is a bmw M3 🤫
Is the secret car a GTR
Bros gonna pay off a house to insure that one. Or his rents under there insurance 😅
Happy birthday to me.....😂😂😂love those wheels
I think the new build Is BMW M3 Comp
I wonder if that’s a limited edition yfood?
How much did that cost to insure for a 21 year old. Jesus!
Saw TikTok video someone recording a red G82 M4 on Matt’s truck 🥹
How about Mat Armstrong recreates ‘Star In A Reasonably Priced Car’? First guest, Guenther Steiner.
I feel horrible for Guenther. I will miss him on F1 weekends
Very bad banana BMW M3...
It's a bmw m3 2022 smashed
You are right, everyone does drive a pick-up in the states, including me.
i wouldve bought 50 tickets but i dont live in the UK. Im from lebanon in the middle east.I also think you really should come here and see how mechanics work here.
sick drifting matt 🎉🎉🎉
Time to look for another paint shop
Yeah the drifting was good, but what about the concentration face!!! Great as always!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
Bmw m3
Quality bit of driving!! 👏 👏
Yoooo is it just me but I notice that MCLAREN is still LHD but it meant to be RHD 🤔
Excellent drifting Mat what a car to do in love a GTR
😂absolutely top class guys Matt smashing out the park winning 🥇 😊
G-man is still a BOSS!!
Audi R8 I’m guessing…
What happened to your voice Matt
Am I the only person who can see a Lamborghini Urus between the C63 and the Range Rover in the end of the video?
You honestly need to make one for the USA or make a build over here and raffle it off for us mate or what we don't matter lol just messin brother
Love the crafter,need to mod that
Comment number 600!
M3😊
Why put a V8 in a GTR ... 😢🤦🏻‍♂️
Great video, nice drifting!! Was excited to buy the limited edition yfood as my first yfood but it’s unfortunately UK only 😢 Greetings from Greece!
guenther co owns a carbon company
So cool where hard work, an infectious personality, and talent gets you! Living the life, meeting cool people and owning and driving cool cars
So ...the m3 will become a drift car now? Anyway you need to strip all of it for rebuild! Saw it live yesterday!
Keep it up m8 loving your videos
Orange jumper orange van in back ground
What's drive to survive going to do now?
You should definitely compete for fun of course but never know . That’s was exceptionally good drifting
So when’s Matt building a drift car and competing? 😊
Met you at Autosport international spoke to you about the R8. Appreciate the convocation and photo 👍🏻
Matt I’m an ex recovery driver and I used to move Ferraris if you twist the strap in a figure of 8 and make a small circle then put your ratchet strap through it, it won’t rub on the wheel while in transit
You need to rebuild a GTR!
He was a good actor, but Haas wants to have success now.
As usual great vid, always love your genuineness...feels like your talking a buddy at the track. Sad that here in the US we can't order yfood.
The new built is the new bmw m3 I think😅😂
G80 M3 gonna be sick
Great drifting! Also, gonna miss Guenther :(
Not a Tesla is it?
Mr Steiner seems like such a humble person. Please put the rear bumper back on the Lamborghini. The looks are utterly ruined with rear bumper missing.
That was mental ! You looked so calm !!! You’re a pro drifter now!!!! 👌😎
Brilliant
It’s a m3 comp
Honestly, i think getting a beautiful car like
How a 21 year old insured that Porsche I have NO idea lmaaooooo I can't believe any insurer approved that 😂
the new car is a bmw m3 comp i think in grey
You still need to do a GTR Mat 😉👌🏻
You should bring the  drinks over the U.S.
The new build is a red bmw M3 😍
Of course he has the greatest pick up you can ever buy ❤
Next video: I'm building a drift car 🤞😂
Mate you put a smile on my face every time I watch your video😅 Than you 😁
U have to do that drifting in the new m3
@mat armstrong, always educative and sensational, you smiling all the time make things seem too easy even when it's on a different situation thumbs 👍 and fingers always 🤞
G80 M3👀👀
one of the best youtuber and awesome content! But why commercial for Nestle? Can^t understand that
You could tell when Mat was starting to get comfortable around @9:40 mark. You could hear he was giving it a bit more. Impressed bud.
She said it Matt…you’ve got proof. 😂 Go on and build one 👍🏻
i love the mclaren videos
Re verse
Love thus guy
Wow top drifts well done
Mate that was well sick fairplay to you i reckon i sussed next project its all about the banana 🍌 😁
That Fuentes Steiner must’ve been AI cos the real Gunter would’ve called the Mclaren a pile of effing shite! 🤬🤬🤬
Where was this event and when if anyone can tell me
What a nice Guenther seams to be
Fuck me Guenther  must really be scraping the barrel for a job these days. 😂 BTW there’s no expression of joy with anyone in an electric car. 😢
I saw someone on the internet picking up  a r8 a few weeks ago
8:34 hold up is that the actor who played harry potters evil cousin Dudley Dursley???
Do it without chewing ya tongue lol 😂😂😂 that’s full concentration 😂
Someone already leaked the next car he has it’s a red BMW M3 competition new shape, someone leaked it on tiktok who was at the show unfortunately
Who's Kevin? Tattoo on Mat's hand.
Shame he’s not in f1..could of had one of Schumacher’s or mazepins crash damaged cars!
Red m3 competition
Indeed Gunther this McLaren had a fok smash door...
Love Guenther, I’m envious you got the chance to meet him, would love to meet that dude!
looking a bit rough Mat. do you have the lurghie? Still happy, funny and excited no matter tho 🤣
Absolutely brilliant, Matt.
❤❤😊😊😊keep it up like ur channel ur bùilt u make impossible thing become possible bro
You sound a bit under the weather which speaks loads of your work ethic and dedication to your channel! And as usual another amazing video
When I was a youngster about 30 years ago, we used to call the roof handle "OH SHIT! handle" because when you as a passenger feel the driver comes to fast into a corner, you automatically grab the roof handle thinking OH SHIIIIIT!!!!  Greetings from Norway
Audi r8
Well done 👏 drifting with the owner Drift champion Mike Essa DDE would be proud 😊
Did you hastily add the “ex” to the title?😂 shame, I thought he brought some great characters to the paddock

Nicely done

That red bmw is something different what happened to that !!
M3 competition
The not so secret Red M3 Competition may it be 🙊can’t wait to see the series on it 😍😍
Guessing r8
Red m4
It’s a shame we can’t get Y food in the US.
I’m calling the blur 🤔 the urus????
The boy not only can fix cars, he can fucking drive em haha. Was it just me, or did you choke up at the end, when you seen it drive off?
Thats proper driving Mat!
Next car hint……red bmw m3!!!!!!"????
Unreal Matt. Hats off to you bud 😎👌
Can’t wait for the g80 mat 🧐
He drifting like a pro 😎👍
That M3 gonna be a beast
Bmw m3 red one the next build
i worked through the holidays too matt, and I had a stinking chest infection. the grind is real.
Audi R8
You cant help but want Matt to succeed. Such a great story.
Audi R8
This looks like the perfect beginner practice area cos there's absolutely no grip (slow drift, plus the tyres weren't even smoking). You should try drifting on tarmac, you will notice a massive difference.
Someone posted video about your upcoming M3 project ......🤣
Next one is a G80 M3👀
Was not expecting Guenther to live in the states
Audi R8, another channel showed you weeks ago buying that car......
Is the secret car a g80 m3 by any chance
For people that want to know the secret cars a g80 bmw m3
New rebuild is m3 a Ferrari red color miner front hit 😮😊
Are u ok mate u sound sick
Seen that GTR up close at Goodwood, absolute beast, that turbo is HUGE!!
So the next car is a gtr
Matt you look tired mate, take a break!
New built -- It's my very damage BMW M3.  Good luck fixing the rear left😂😂
the content is going ballistic Matthew!! u rockets
A natural drifter...impressive.
Nice
The noise that GTR wasn’t making doesn’t come over on camera it was unreal like a cannon going off spitting flames from the screamer pipes
You looked like you had your eyes closed. Feckin cool
How can we who watch from the states can get a chance to win ,   I do follow you and subscribe your channel
I bet that Porsche lasted 25 minutes before being written off again 😂😂
Matts throat, very bad!
16:48 i have seen it 😅A Beautiful Orange car
I can’t be the only one who thinks you should do a r34 skyline build
But it has already been shown on TikTok the new build
Gtr build on its way I think
I would have a guess that hes going to rebuild a GTR😄
I went to that car show on Saturday and it was a great day out. I saw the Gallardo and 720s and they look amazing in real life. Keep it up Mat!
I take my hat off to you good sir, can't wait to see the dirt car build 😂😂
Bmw m3 Turing
Your new car is all over TikTok I’m not gonna say what it was either though
Freaking awesome to watch your journey Mat!
The new projects an M3
When did you turn into Barry white?
We all know its a blue audi r8 mat
No way that 21 year old got insured on that Porsche, no way LOL   It would be like 10k now days third-party only.   😆
That G80 M3 as your next build is going to be an exciting one again ❤🎉 but I'm wondering how you are going to fix that rear left quarter panel because wow looks like someone tried to go side ways and ended up on a pole 😢 but I always have faith in you Mat ❤ keep up the good work ❤🎉 much love from South Africa 🇿🇦
Your next build already leaked and I can't unsee it
Okay so you spend 10s of thousands of dollars on a car and put in a 1000hp engine to go around in circles so the back end breaks loose, got it.
Great video, can't wait for the finished McLaren 🎉❤
I’m really excited for the m3 comp build  And the r8 v10 plus one
That car he will not show is a r8
Congrats with the Y-Food launch, not gonna buy one don't get me wrong! xD Mate, what a drift bro!!!!
I'm glad to see your professionalism when dealing with these big names, because you have earned it , after all they just people with a common interest in cars
What a great chap Mr. Steiner is,and what a fantastic channel this is too. Love it to bits!!!
Pov you get 1 dollar from every time mat laughs 🤑💵😅
Can't wait to see what you do with the m5 😊
Nice a GT-R rebuild!
I recon the new car is going to be BMW M3 competition in orange
That caddy on the background gave me some crazy ideas
“Bad passenger” = not a genuine car enthusiast
New build is a G80 BMW m3 comp
Im taking a wild guess, a blue bmw 😂
Red M3 coming?
The bmw in red you got can't wait to see yoi fix it
Somebody sounds poorly. Maybe should have had a break over Xmas 😉
Mega
Duck to water. Legendary
Ok ,ok. Yes, Matt can definitely drive.....a car...
Well done !!!
Zenvo?
That was quality...
Mat prolly would finish everything on his own if he had 50 hrs a day lol
New cars the blue r8 🤟🏻
What an unexpected crossover. Lovely chatting with Mr Guenther is amazing
MA drift build when? 😂
That drifting was sick, i would love to do that someday
Decent job drifting there tbf. Just remember the is very slippery surface and makes it easier to get sliding but more tricky to control.  The next car is an Aston martin, you can see the rear light just parked behind that beautiful Porsche
Get well soon mat
New Car = A buckled Red M3 Comp
Guenther came out of nowhere
Atleast you got the ml 720 running
Who agrees matt should build a wrecked gtr it’s the only one he hasn’t done yet I’d love to see it

Just wondering the purple porsche in the back ground you sold yours to tavarish did you buy another for a next build🤔

New builds all over tik tok, Hannahs fave brand 😂
Guenther is such a great guy.... Hass F1, what have you gone and done you fools. Mat, so great to see the two of you chatting so freely. 😊
Almost looked like a tear was approaching with the Cayman S going. Lucky we couldn't tell because of the rain. Love this channel HWBT

New project car is an Audi R8 V10 (blue)
the answer to the mystery car is behind the fabulous tony
There was a blue 720s that crashed near my town which also had damage to the carbon and im from the Netherlands so that might be the same car lol  edit: but the original colour of this one was black so idk
Does the yfood company ship to the United States by any chance I keep seeing ur videos and seeing u push it and I want to try this stuff
Mat, why is Yfood only available in the UK. Get it to the US. 😮😊
Can’t wait to see the “BLUR” (Spoiler Alert: It is an Audi R8) build come to life.
