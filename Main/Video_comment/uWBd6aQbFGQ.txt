Dat Way (Remix) Lyrics [Chorus: Abra Cadabra] Rise it (Baow), rise it (Baow), we could never get tired (Hrr) Slide on them, slide (Slide), press it on 'em and sky 'em (Grr) Uh, I'm in, then I'm out (Huh?) Like I fucked man's girl, I'm in, then I'm out (Huh?) When I press this ting, I'm in, then I'm out (Huh?) Don't kiss that girl, I put ball in her mouth You know like, that way, that way (That way) Got the drop, so my young boy with it You know like, that way, that way (Grrt) Spin this coupe, reverse it (Skrr, skrr) The man went that way, that way (Uh) Baby, come arch your back, come arch your back You know how I like it, that way, yeah That way    [Verse 1: Krept] (Tally) Sting said rap, I'll stay strapped for the chaos You know how much flats he's taped off? (Many) Amazon, ask Jeff Bezos Man was runnin' in cribs like, "Who's the shotter?" You would think that he's from Naij the way he was shoutin', "You robber" As we ran off with belongings  [Verse 2: Backroad Gee] Which one we selecting? (Which one?) Bang, eject it (Baow) Man can't bend it like Beckham Bark it, leave it like Lingard Which way did he go? They're telling me this way, so I went that way PYH, protect your head You don't wanna end up on the curb side dead Back up, don't move Grrah, he moved Before all the guns, it was kitchen knives You don't wanna buck into the killies tonight Next hundred bags, we're taking out thirty, yardies spending it all on waps Hold up, man put corn in mash Tell a man look forward and don't look back  [Verse 3: French Montana] Huh? Spin this coupe, reverse it (Skrrt) Mixing that lean with the Perkies (Perkies) Mans don't do beef, they allergic Smacked him, hand 'em back they purses, hearses (Woo) Goin' that way, that way Every bitch I fuck with go that way, that way (That way) Best friend came with a best friend (Best friend) And that best friend came with a best friend (Bestie) Slide on an opp like the Everest (Skrrt) Had the Pooh Shiesty on, no cameras (Baow) Hit 'em up live on TV (Baow, baow) Came in the mouth, he ate that pussy, he greedy (Baow, baow) Bottom of the pot, cocaine in the drop Coke boys, CB, chain on 3D We could never get tired Had blow in the drought, we could never get higher (Montana)

Ktrap never misses
What a load of rubbish
Clavish X Pa Salieu
Funny how we can comment on this but we can't comment on the my story track by goofy krept and konan where he got chased with a strap and ran inside his mother's room and shut the door indangering her life like a coward to hide in between her legs for safety. He got the step father killed and switched in court like bouncer. He would do it the same way again if he went back in time, and you lot rate this lol. Crack on with it. This is a shit song.
What a load of crap french montana and beenie man level just went down.
😂
this beat only misses popsmoke
Trap killed it
Clavish and DoRoad 🔥🔥🔥
🔥🔥🔥😬
Gotta be winning an award or beating records for this one..... SO many top legends in one song ❄❣

Montana the king 🔥🔥🔥
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.

Clavish Should Have Been Last Jeezzz..!!! I'm Pissed.!! He Killed My Energy
BackroadGee and PA Salieu, Bennie Man, French Montana, K-Trap Before The Rest ... Clavish killed my energy.!!!
Backroadgee and PA Salieu Energy Was needed to start on the track after Krept's verse before bringing in French Montana verse!!! The Beat Needed High Energy Voices On It Before Those Slow Verses, I don't know why you even brought Clavish after French.!!! NEXT TIME Talk To Your Engineers!! Energy Is Energy Don't Miss It.!!!
Beenie man 😳🔥
Pa Salieu on drill coldddd🧼
Clavish is the best rapper in the UK no doubt
Clavish is something diff but bando pfff
clavish flow is impeccable
I thought French Montana was from ends for a minute. He might as well chill on the hill after this.
Beenie Man brought me here 😎🇯🇲💯
The way clavish does it with such ease on a cold drill beat like this is crazy him and K trap for me had the best verse everyone still shelled it 🔥

k trap and DoRoad couldve done it alone
This Is trash though I'll stick to the original

Clavish hard 💯
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
That boy that said his not going to Heaven doesn't know what his talking about.SMh all 2 sound cool on a tune🙄🙄
Trappo & DoRoad back to back is always very dangerous. Pa Salieu did his ting. Clavish sounds so sinister. Truth be your, Abz is the MVP on this tune…. RISE IT, RISE IT!   🥶
Would love to be on the remix as the only female no cap but watch a female get dragged on the remix and no me just saying I am that way 😂😂😂😂. #Lungs
Instantly goin to the playlist

Now thats what you call a collab

This shit is hard 🔥🔥
Man said Beenie yanna 🏆
Background Gees energy is unmatched, always been 🥶. After watching Wu-Tang Clan show I can see Ol'Dirty Bastard (ODB) and him have similarities not in style but in terms of their unique flows. Both obv unique to each other and other rappers.
Salute straight from Sierra Leone in Africa 🇸🇱🇸🇱🇸🇱🇸🇱
If they replaced French for Headie and Beanie for LD the track would have been an A Star 💫 Line Up
