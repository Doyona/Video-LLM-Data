I would like to speak the manager and politely ask them to sign up for free for today's sponsor, Morning Brew: https://cen.yt/mbdangelowallace2
Also why are they calling the movie a horror movie I DL the movie and there's nothing scary about it it's more of a drama movie nothing scary about it and the actress who played Karen she even received hate mail from white people aka Karen's who told her We are not like that 😂 I would've told her to ask them why are you complaining have you done some of the things my character did in the movie if you have than YOU ARE A KAREN!! 😂 Now as far as the actress talking about that trump trash saying that BS than showing that old picture well a lot of actors fell for Trump's BS and are now black listed by fans including myself the actor who played Chuck& Shazam,Hulk Hogan, Kevin Sorbo,the blond guy from Dukes of Hasard& Smallville and many more but I doubt she's that big of a kiss azz Trump lover like the rest.
Dude No the husband get it on with Karen she tried to set him up and flirt with him while he was putting antifreeze in her car for her and when she touched him he spilled it on his hands and shirt she than told him he could wash his hands in her house that's when he discovered a room with monitors that show's Karen is watching him&his wife's house. But prior to that day Karen caught him smoking weed in his car as he came home that's why she said You wouldn't want your wife knowing our little secret if you promise not to do it again around my house where my kid's could smell it.
I just heard of and watched this movie “Karen” in 2025 today; then rushed to Social Media to see if anyone else thought it was as horrible as I did. 😂😂
Bro, whoever did this doesn't have an ounce of creativity in their body
You seem so so so cool and I love your content, BUT NotEvenEmily has the smoothest transitions to ads and you cannot beat her, I'm sorry  1:18
not surprised about Taryn Manning she played Pensatucky on Orange Is The New Black toooooo well
3:33 I couldn’t do it 3 times.
it's weird seeing blacks bash a movie for them then turn around and complain cause there's not enough "black presentation" in films. y'all are always complaining about something bro. it's exhausting ATP.
Taryn Manning is such a brilliant actress, I can’t believe she would participate in such nonsense
Racism is a horror film for black folk (I’m black)
Please 🙏 subscribe and 📌
Isn't Tary the woman who played that religious freak on Orange Is The New Black?😭😭😭
I was like... where did I see this actress before?? GURL THAT'S PENNSATUCKY!
In recent months with the Danny Masterson trial, Taryn Manning, the actress who plays Karen in this movie, posted multiple videos defending Danny Masterson including some where she yells "Karen," possibly calling his critics Karens. I was really disgusted with her not only defending Danny Masterson, but also using the word Karen in that way. That's not what a Karen is. As a white person, I don't think it's my place to have the final say in deciding what the definition of a Karen is, but I'm pretty sure that someone who criticizes Danny Masterson after he was convicted of rape is NOT what a Karen is.   I had seen this video you posted prior to the Danny Masterson trials and initially didn't remember any names attached to the movie. Finding out that Taryn Manning was the actress who plays Karen in this movie, which which I had never heard of prior to seeing this video that you posted, made the situation even weirder. If she was involved in this movie, I would think that would lead to her having a better understanding of what a Karen is. Wouldn't she do research on Karens to play this role? Finding out that she is the actress who plays Karen in this movie puts her in a position of being someone who should know better.   I'm not calling for a complete and total ban on calling white women Karens. I don't have anything bad to say about black people calling racist white women Karens or using that term against women who are being privilege bullies or making racist 911 calls or being rude to service workers, but I do think the word "Karen" does frequently get used inappropriately. There are too many people throwing that term around and using it too loosely and too frivolously. It seems as if white people will call anyone who they disagree with a Karen. While Taryn Manning is the latest example of this, she is far from alone. There have been situations where during 2020, white anti-maskers would call people Karens for politely asking them to put on masks or social distance. There have been white supremacists who have called people Karens for protesting against racism. Elon Musk called Elizabeth Warren a Karen, which is out of line coming from a rich and powerful white man who is too privileged to be allowed to call anyone a Karen. I have seen racist white male Republicans call people Karens while not really knowing the anti-racist origin of that term and also possibly being more Karen-like than whoever they are calling Karens. Even Lauren Boebert, while speaking out against student loan debt forgiveness made a comment about not wanting her tax dollars to fund "Karen's daughter's degree in lesbian dance theory." She sounds more Karen-like than anyone she has ever called a Karen. I have seen a wealthy white woman call people Karens for giving her podcast a negative review. Even the actual Karens themselves have started calling other people Karens for very Karen-like reasons. I personally know a woman who got called a Karen for speaking out against racism and sexism by a white man who is racist and sexist. I was also called a Karen back in 2020 for getting emotionally worked up about too many people carelessly not wearing masks and feeling unsafe in my workplace because of people not wearing masks when they should, even during a mask mandate. She was getting paid more than me to stay home during the pandemic and enjoy safety that I don't get to enjoy while having the audacity to pick apart my emotional reaction to danger that I was experiencing that she herself got to enjoy the luxury of getting paid more than me to not experience. There are also way too many white men calling people Karens. I do not consider Karen to be a slur when people of color use it for anti-racist reasons, but white men are a completely different story. That term needs to be off limits to white men and people need to stop throwing that term around so frivolously. Taryn Manning, despite being someone who should know better, has become the latest example of someone using the word Karen improperly.
(Karen)-obnoxious white lady (Brad)-spoiled privileged arrogant white guy
I'm from San Antonio!
Looks like a cheap ass movie, that's for sure
I thought the movie was a parody !
Honestly the idea of "Karen" could be really interesting and impactful but they really fucked it up with the trailer and it ruins it. Also when they said "we live next to a... Karen" I thought they were gonna say "we live next to a... serial killer" and I was so disappointed that it wasn't that
I saw clips and I thought it was a low budget comedy skit
Why does the actor for Karen sound drunk the entire trailer?
Chatgpt write me a movie script about a “Karen” in Jordan Peele writing style to normalize racism and racist people.
If you want to see a raw racism movie that is actually good, watch Soft & Quiet.
I bet it was a white person who wanted to make this
Im watching this and the channel has 1.5 M subscribers with the video at 1.2m views!
the movie was terribly amazing lmao
This was the funniest breakdown of a trailer I have seen in a while. 😂
Anytime I see a BET logo I’m terrified enough 😭💀
If Coke Daniels was white, I would be mad but also I would understand the "quality" of the script.... however, he isn't, so I'm kinda sad.
orange is the new black
Y’all do protest for stupid stuff sometimes though.  Not like, Target pride protestor level stupid but….
Get Out was great.  Peele’s other stuff seems weaker, and I include Key and Peele.
I assume the harassment from Karens D’Angelo receives in the wild is mostly unsolicited pickup lines.
this is the OITNB universe if Pennsyltucky  married her parole officer plot arc
After watching several of your videos, mr D. I cannot help but say, your style is on point. The hair is fab and I love it when you rock those pastel colours. Very visually pleasing. Great content to cruise to 🙂
This movie is like an exhaustingly long dhar mann video
Man i so hope you do eventually make a video on this now that you're back 😭😭 Also i said it 3x fast on the first try so 👍
This is camp
I need to know - Did I miss the secret project?? Its gonna kill me not knowing
Dude the “somehow they white washed racism” is a perfect summary of how that trailer made me feel, my honest opinion is that we really don’t need a movie that’s just a dumbed down version of videos you can find online, if people want to see police brutality racism and peek Karen you can watch that online or even people reacting to it
Like even if she said in the trailer “I want to move house because our neighbour is an UNHINGED racist” and like maybe a bit more emotion it would have made up for a lot of the trailer (but not all)
It's not supposed to make sense that's how they bring attention to this movie 😂
I think the next one is about Sam Bankman-Fried, because the Elizabeth Holmes video is the perfect intro to a SBF video.
Have yall ever seen 2 Karen's fight?     It's like krakens ngl
This was definitely directed by Dhar Man
i wonder what happened to this movie
Still waiting on this secret project on the channel that is now deleted…the world may never know
Im watching this video May 2023 and the actual Karen movie is showing up at the top of my suggested vids
I will past .... Coke Daniels movies are not.......Good
yo manning is wild hahahahahahahahaa
This movie isn't something to bring light to racism, it seems like a movie white people can point at and say "I'm not THAT bad so I'm not racist".
This is just meant to reassure white people that they aren’t racists because they aren’t literal psychopaths like the lady in the movie. Turning racist Karens into a weird bogeyman when actually they’re average middle or upper class white women.
LOL this does have an AI vibe
Im white; native of Sweden. Two times I have have been massively disappointed (and this is people I thought where kind and respectful) . Finding out that a coworker that was like 20 years older than me was a raging racist and a neighbor family also (that destroyed the life of a refugee) - *that is a story for another time* And they did some awefull shit to this boy but no one cared...I'm so embarrassed to live near them and have worked with these assholes
Nice keyboard.
I actually watched the entire movie. I don't know if it was supposed to be a comedy, but I sure did laugh at all the ridiculousness.
😅
❤️
DIDN'T SHE PLAY PENNSATUCKY? THAT RELIGIOUS GIRL IN ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK? HOLY SHIT SHES ACTUALLY BECOMING PENNSATUCKY
What's a back square on IG?
Kennie JD's review of this movie SENT ME THO NGL
this looks like its made by a karen in order to prove shes not racist
This  movie Karen is a woke racist movie disguised to appeal as a social justice film. Considering the rascal division we are experiencing in this country this is a film that incites racial hatred and bigotry. In my opinion the film Karen is just another racist exploitation film that provides no inspiration for finding solutions against discrimination to bring races together. The woke and cultural warriors preach racism is everywhere in America even though we elected a Black President. Don't watch this film.
I and my aunt subjected ourselves to the movie and it was as disappointing as you think it is
Don't be so stupid...  Life is really like this...  I'm hispanic, and white people talk about black people in front of me all the time.  They say things in front of me is like I'm going to agree with their way of thinking...  I just walk away, and I get to work or just do what I was there to do.  Sometimes the white man tries to hid their racism, but I can see right through their lying face.
That actor in your thumbnail was in orange is the new black 🙄✋10/16 actor
feature length dhar mann video
It's gotta be a parody, surely... I cannot take it seriously
"you've summoned her" lol
Dhar Mann writing a horror story be like-
Is it a comedy? Or…….what?….
Omfg I just realized that’s the woman who played dogget in orange is the new black 😂
When *watching a Karen pretending not to be a Karen while also playing a Karen pretending not to be a Karen* goes -Dhar Man- wrong. Lol
I wanna get mad but not even gonna lie the transition to morningbrew was clever
Is this based off a real person bc.... my neighbors name is literally Karen drexler and looks just like this woman i am scared.
Okay but why is this literally a drawn out Dharrman video??
she’s the president of the hoa lol
0:40 wouldn't a male Karen just be called a redneck or hillbilly
Should've  boycott  this movie  we got  to deal with  Karen   in real like now they making a movie  ..ooh nooo
The only thing about your assessment that I disagree with is that the movie SHOULD depict hardcore racism. I understand they failed at showcasing the microabuses that minorities go through regularly, but I feel like that was the objective nonetheless.
I keep hearing my name but no one's talking to me. Why do I share my name with this actress? Is this how people named Jane or John or Frank feel?
That actress was also in “Orange Is the New Black” she was the c*caine addict or something. I’m not surprised for her being this character.
“KarenCharacter , KarenCharacter, KARENCHARACTER!” 😂😂😈😈
Yuck
Omfg. They casted a real Karen... and made her act like a... fake Karen?
Wasn’t the ‘Karen’ women in orange is the new black??? I thought she was great in that but probably cause she was giving crackhead energy lol
Soros will go broke in like a year if he doesn't stop throwing his money around like that. He's got to have like 85% of world's nongovernmental organizations on his payroll.
I think I got it now!  The power shutting down, the snow storm and the  parents getting pulled over in a certain county, said university, and it's in south Texas.....tbh my best guess is Houston, San Antonio, Corpus Christi, McAllen etc.  So really those places I listed are just my safest bets as to where he lives or remotely close to where he is based on what he's mentioned in videos. As to why I decided to make this comment....idk just a guessing game to see if I know my own state well enough to make said nonsense guess's
just the fact that they got the lead crackhead from orange is the new black to play the karen is the funnniest part to me.
"we are living next to a ....... a racists"  Your living next to a psyko  "you are black people"  They are a nice chocolate color "How the heck did you move here" Who the heck wrote the script?
Its an a
Wait… is that the chick from OITNB? 😂
Taryn Manning is a violent person, on top of the Q anon stuff, and also a nightmare to work with. She strangled her assistant. I also know people who hired her for a role and had to fire her right before shooting (an extremely expensive, stressful decision) because she was so unprofessional.
Yeah you look, sound, and act like you haven't spent 1 day in the hood bro!  You have that victim mentality and probably haven't lived the struggle!
I’ve watched this movie before sadly and it’s worse than it seems
Taryn Manning: character actress gone method acting gone sexual
After playing the note which he asserts that he thinks is an f sharp, he pauses perfectly and says “It’s an A”.🤣The comedic timing is strong in this one.
Wait that’s Pennsatucky from OITNB 😭😭
I could watch Them and get better racism wait… no uh I make Them sound bad
It's like a Dharmaan movie 😂😂
A more realistic movie: the HOA denies the Black couple's application because letting Black people into their neighborhood will decrease the White people's property value. End of movie. Redlining is real.
Trash movie an absolute misuse of propaganda
Popopopopopopopopopoppopopopopopoppppoooooooooooooooooooop
This movie is giving lifetime network
Just watch Lakeview Terrace. They basically ripped off this movie and it’s soooo much better
Ive never laughed so hard at being called a fool before 🤣
Ok, tell me why the whole trailer looks like it made in iMovie. It looks like they used one of the templates.
She did better in orange is the new black as a crackhead
No one could B Jordan Peele the only brilliant mind I could think like him as his partner
This movie is so fucking stupid 🤦🏼‍♀️
I only watch sponsor talks when they have a great transition. You have won me over
Disney could take lessons on whitewashing from this movie, like yikes are they afraid to say anything worse than "insert insult and attach black to it" further whitewashing how vile racist language alone is.  Also this Karen is wholly unbelievable as a Karen. where's the animalistic screeches? Where's the dives that football/soccer players are jealous of? Where's the self escalation and glowing red faces? Atleast they got "Karan gets violent but at property as there too afraid to hit someone" Didn't even give her the stereotypical Karen haircut like WTF?  Funny you mention an AI making the script as I'm pretty sure a better Karen movie could be made by an AI editing and stitching actual Karen and Ken videos together.  Edit: This movie would be a genuine horror move if it was called Karen, Ken and Kompany. And instead of just one good officer, flip it, have one bad officer (Karen's husband) that secretly works with the KKK throughout the movie. Although this could divert Google searches which wouldn't be ideal.
If I had even 1 percent of deangelo’s confidence I would be unstoppable lol
the person who made this movie is a dharr mann kinnie
ommgggg this movie is so cringe
The acting that Taryn is doing makes me think that is what a racist person believes is racism.  So her normal actions which aren't as overt are obviously not racist and only when she dials it up to a farcical 11 would it qualify.  If she acted as she normally does it would be far more successful because it would show actual racism.    It's like some people claiming that they aren't racist because they don't but an r on the N word.  But it's the context of how you use it that matters.  The letter R isn't racist.  Excluding it doesn't mean you are fine.  And that is the level I'm seeing in the trailer.  She changed her behavior a little bit and put the metaphorical R on the racist behavior.  Then she can put a bow on it outside of the movie and say "I'm not racist, see what me being actually racist would look like!"
No wonder doggit was such a well done character in oitnb
I find this weird bc the lady playing Karen is a pretty decent actor so I don’t understand
Strikes me as an SNL parody...
The word  “Glockumemtary” killed the last of my brain cells
suspecting 😭
Also I realize nurse joy is there
Isn’t that they guy that playing the coach on the All American spin off 💀
I don’t understand how taryn Manning could be in a show (orange is the new black) with all that heavy commentary about people of color and not have learned anything lol.
I love how it plays a keynote on the piano every 5 seconds 😂
I watched this movie however I couldn't help but laugh at it and I couldn't take the Karen character seriously, Since I've seen and encountered real racists, it felt like I was watching a comedy when watching this movie and I wish this movie was better because this movie was so bad it was funny.
If you had seen “Who made the potato salad?” you would’ve been prepared for what this was all about
D'Angelo: what is that, like an F#? It's an A.  Me: Oh, so you play alto sax. Got it.
this was posted on my birthday O_o
Turning black trauma into entertainment  is 🤢🤢🤢
Noooooo I summoned her 🥲
Isn't "Karen" from orange is the new black? What happened to her career? Haha
The world was *obviously* created the same day as the internet. Nothing could have existed before. I’m confused how I lived on earth for like 25-26 years before I owned a smartphone. And into my 30s without YouTube premium.
I used to be Boomkat’s fan. I want her to play a "good guy" role someday.
remember lil tecca? this is him now, feel old yet?
Honestly the movie isn't so bad at all idk what the problem is
It wants Jordan peele’s clout 🤣
Ngl but the acting was bad
I would watch a movie about "Karen", but I don't think this is it
New subscriber, only 2nd video I've watched, enjoying content so far, keep up the good work👍
Who dies in the movie the racist or the black people ????  Film will stir up issues no matter what side of the coin it falls on
I cant actually believe this is a movie hahaha
looks really bad worst movie ever
really BAD acting !!
i said karen character 3 times and she appeared and asked to speak to my manager
Man just smooth-talked himself. Gotta pay respect.
I love confederate merch
It’s meant to be racist… against  whites
You're not funny, you suck and I hate you'r videos
I was done when I saw BET 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣
Ngl i rather watch Dharm Mann videos rather than this karen movie lol
I'm a sucker for a good add transition💯😂😂
As a black woman who also grew up in Texas their surprise at the racsim was so stupid it was hilarious
I am... ashamed to say that I laughed at that child's deadpan delivery of "She doesn't like black people." Just- The state of this movie is absolutely insane. This feels like it should be satire but it ISN'T.
I totally thought this movie would be made by some rich white hollywood producer who wanted to show how "not racist" they are
that poor dog when he showed that poor clip
When I first heard about this movie, I thought it'd be funny and satire. I never planned on watching it, but I just kinda ignored it. Finally watching the trailer in this video made me just. Ugh. Agony. I can't even put into words quite how bad this is lol
The woman playing Karen is Peyton Manning’s cousin…but she’s also been on Orange is the New Black
she played a racist crackhead in orange is the new black
i feel like the movie could be very good if it was done in a realistic yet dramatic way that is trying to portray a serious societal concept message that was done well took a lot of time... but this cheapened it and made it weird and not good to watch, and it missed the whole reason people dont like karens and their behavior. its a lot deeper then the movie portrayed it and if done right i think it would be a good concept thats all.
This movie looks like one of those BAAD movies that are so bad they are good and you can just laugh at it.
I just feel like this movie was make to help white people understand the fear blacks people feel, exaggerated, but where it realistically could go.  Also feel like he shouldn’t talk til the movies out and can actually be judged. (Ready to regret my comment, come for me if you’re bored
I THINK YOUR OVERREACTING BIG TIME , DON'T HATE ON FACTS, APPRECIATE  MOVIES LIKE THESE AND ARE BEING MADE DISPLAYING WHAT  ACTUALLY HAPPENS TO PEOPLE OF COLOR.   THIS FILM  HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 'GET OUT'    I've seen it,,,and  like it .👏👏👏👏👏👏,   Ok so Towards the end it kinda falls apart, but  the DIRECTOR  effort showing  what sadly happens  to many AFRICAN AMERICANS was on point!!        'KAREN'      ⭐⭐⭐
I feel a little bad for the Karen actress bc damn she could act in OITNB but...WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE 😭😭😭
They could’ve done a better job on this movie. First of all, got a better actor to play Karen? And had a bigger budget so it doesn’t seem like an SNL skit. And so much more, that would make this comment too long :|
Let's get to taking over the world
Bruh, you obviously don’t know who that “Karen” is and the other things she’s famous for. 🥴
Haha I watched this stupid movie the other week
I'd love to see a movie where it's black people being racist to white people.   I was born in the ghettos to a druggie mom and dad. To which both my parents were white. And the amount of racism, violence, etc just bc of our skin color, is something not shown in the media.  Racism can be to every color. And all racism is sad and devastating.
I kinda dug Taryn Manning in a couple movies. But now…😬😬😬.
So I understand why in USA you don't need that movie and it is totally enough to walk the street unfortunately. But I live in Slovakia (Central Europe) and when I first saw Karen videos I thought it was all staged to exaggerate real problem and raise awareness. It took a few more videos for me to realize those people are real and it is really happening so I think it is good for other countries to know how bad things can get if xenophobia and racism keeps spreading. 😅😅 (Btw I apologize for my English. It is not my first nor my second language.)
I remember watching the Brittany Murphy documentary and guess who I saw? TARYN MANNING. I was surprised she was getting interviewed even with all her stupidity.
jokes on you, my name is karen so i summoned myself.
Oh the actor of Karen has gone down hill since orange is the new black
It’s giving “Lifetime Original”
no but when you literally watch it, it is LITERALLY enraging.
The funny thing is I thought it was a parody but then I realized they were serious
She said BLM was made to make white peoples look bad… What the fuck 😳😂
ok but when i was younger I used to be OBSSESSED with who made the potato salad-
I’m kinda mad he didn’t start out with “hi, welcome to talking about whatever I want”
I rented this movie, it’s Really bad XD
The idea was there... the acting was not lmao
“Mom can we see get out” “We have get out at home” Get out at home:
Is the actress playing Karen the crazy god love character from Orange is the New Black??
The movie looks very low budget, and lazy in production and acting.
Ain't that Pentsatucky for Orange is the new black?
i confidently said only fans
It’s like an SNL sketch lol 😂
♥️
HOLD UP KAREN IS DOGGETT FROM OITNB
i couldve sworn that was lindsey lohan
"bad things happen to people who dont comply" .... to what?? taking the trash bins in?🤣
OK but the fact that they got an orange is the new black character to play "karen" kinda makes me sad. Cuz she's actually a really good actor 🥲😅
D’angelo, I love you!
I bet all the “Karen’s” are clapping in glee at this! 👏👏
The Karen actor is pennsatucky in oitnb
There was potential of an idea, like you said they could have depicted the subtle racism's that people don't even realize is happening all around everyday, passively. It would have been such a stronger message had they had the white people think of themselves as not racist but woke. Having the white character's trying to show how accepting they are. how welcoming they are to minorities, too the point its uncomfortable. White, straight people feeling the need to prove they're not racist, biggits, by saying "we like gay people" or "we like black people" is another form of discrimination. As though any group of humans need the right to exist. This was WILDLY written, acted and shot. Worse then a lower tear tv movie.
Since BET is no longer “Black Owned,” what do you expect??
I said Karen character, out loud. No fear in my heart, at all.
“Did you do it” *me who did* “You have summoned her” *my mother walks in the room*
Yet another piece of crap meant to make people hate each other
When I watched the trailer I was CONVINCED the director was a white man trying to "spread the message 🥺, grr I love black ppl so much! I even made a movie abt how not to be racist". NO! He's black. What the hell were you thinking Coke Daniels 🤦🏽???
The first problem is that the director is called “COKE DANIELS” idk what bet expected
“heated gaming moment level racism” pls omg 😭😭😭
This is the thing, D’Angelo gives great, educational reasoning for why this movie trailer is bad. Whereas, like 80% of people who also agree that the movie trailer is bad only share those views because they’re either feel too guilty or privileged to accept the fact that this shit actually happens to people of colour. Yeah, the movie seems like it will be a pile of shit but the portrayal of what poc go through is not that far-fetched. A simple google search will tell you that. And it’s really annoying when you hear that the reason some people don’t like the trailer is because, ‘It’s so exaggerated.’ are the same people who will never have to experience it.
They really thought they ate that😭✋
Everything is always super white washed. But also, that actress shouldn’t be playing roles like this omggg I can only see her as the meth head in orange is the new black and in 8-mile.  ****Also POC and honestly everyone else:****  if you get pulled over and don’t have your license, memorise your license number. They will have to accept that. It can save you from a lot of bullshit.
How does an actor go from Orange is the New Black to THIS??
12:12 SHE DID THE THING, EVERYONE POINT AND LAUGH
Pensutucky
Soooo expositional... ew. It just feels so fake. I mean, yes movies aren't real but this is so poorly done
That's a good polo. I've been wearing retro polos for years. Please don't tell me they are getting popular, because then, when it's over, all my clothes will look dated. I'd rather believe that you're just a stylish individualist.
I feel sorry for all the girls/women called Karen that are actually amazing human beings. 😂
This guy is so full of himself. It's disgusting
Her acting was better in OITNB. She played a racist in that show too.
I'm not gay. But D'Angelo is something else...
I dont know man, philosophy tubes sponsor transitions are pretty damn smooth! To be fair fair though, ive been binging the old videos so you may have made the smoothest transition this week😎
it reminds me of one of those videos you had to watch in school when you were younger except slightly less U-rated
Awwwww Pennsatucky 😭
The actress playing Karen was great as pennsatucky in orange is the new black but this just seems like pennsatucky the character trying to act
hold up, world dominations?
i went through the whole video thinking the dramatic piano key was an edit by d'angelo lmaoo
Pennsatucky coulda done better than this
Is this some abridged comedy?
I’m watching you white woman 😕😶
0:56 “as a black people in America”
Thank goodness I haven’t heard of this movie nor the director himself.
Why is this trailer my whole childhood? Slidell Louisiana is literally just this
THE GLOCKUMENTARY??!!
I hope they go through with this. I love a good comedy  Edit:Omg it's out 😂
There's too much "We are the black people" things going on rn like no just... NO PLEASE ✋
Is that Tia Mowry’s husband and brother Tavior in the trailer?? 🤦🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️😂
Are you sure this movie isn’t supposed to be a parody?
Yeah… this movie seems like everything that went wrong with the 2019 Black Christmas remake.
But why they doing this to pennsatucky 🥺🥺🥺
You're married
I watched the movie I didn't see anything wrong with it...it was the truth!  You want the hard Quinton type racisim..that's what we see everyday when we go out our house or on the news!!  On our jobs we may be sitting right next to a racist and don't know it, so it is what it is we've been fighting against it all our life so we keep on fighting until it ends and when it ends we won't let racism happen again.  So the movies are good reminders that it still exists.
She was good in Orange is the new black tho
The poster sent me immediately
"did the neighbors have confederate flag soap dispensers? of course they did"  ... I was NOT expecting that.
Ive seen the movie its a pretty decent movie i was a little shook because im only 13 yk so yeah
when you look at him then you hear his voice...
I find it so wild that she did a good job of acting as a self righteous racist in orange is the new black but somehow not in this
I like your transitions 💜
??? I will not comment my true thought 🤔
Why is your voice so deep. Calm down
The fact that I was relieved the premise wasn't the same as Cruella...
hey about that ad lib guy you were right
She's not a Karen she's just a psychopath
You know how many great movie ideas get thrown in the trash because they don't make it past the big producers and all that? So how did this movie get all the way to production and then approved to be released to the public? I've seen tiktokers come up with better movie ideas smh
She is wearing a horrible wig. Horrible.
BET films?????? BET is stooping low.
But the "as a black people in America" made me subscribe
I just realized I've been spelling potato wrong for a long time...
We know that these lines in the movies are cliche racist...but the Karens of the world have no clue how boringly cliche they really are.
This movie was actually great i thought
Saw the movie last night on BET and i couldn't believe the amount of anti white racism displayed in the movie. When will black people learn they can never afford a house in an upscale white neighborhood.
Well, it seems like creators previous stuff was comedic so I’m guessing this is gonna be the same.  I know who Karen is but can’t think of her name. She was in 8 Mile as B-Rabbits X gf
This movie is necessary for the world to see the atrocious behavior and characteristics of white America. This movie is not for Americans.
Did D'Angelo just told us how to summon "Karen"
I can't wait to watch it. You seem like a baby and not someone I would listen to for criticism. Lost me at your criticism of BET logo.
Wow this looks bad.
Karen's gonna care!
Please no Coke Daniel.
Is the director black?
How can someone do such a bad job playing themselves 😭
A kinda threw up in my mouth,.. like,.. what?! Also, your comment about the soap dispensers,.. lol
Just watch the dang movie!!!
I don't like your thoughts on this! This was the best movie ever! That is it!
is that the tweaker from Orange Is The New Black?💀
https://youtu.be/ZchP89w2pJo The boondocks was right about BET 😆
Tarintino should have directed
I ACTUALLY WATCHED IT LAST NIGHT YOU ARE SO WRONG!! 🤣 all of the youtuber making videos on this movie have never even watched it. I chose to purchase the rental last night thinking it was going to be horrific it isn’t. D Angelo I’ve always thought u were very smart however often times very similar to my gen z little brother...give out opinions that are not based in fact or even reality. You made a 15 min video on a trailer and you’re not the only one however I assumed this movie was going to be like lifetime trash. The actors were great especially the black actors and not only that they brought up topics that are extremely important, such as white women flirting with black men to assert power and control, police having secret organizations that allow them to get away with everything. I have never seen those topics mentioned in a movie or even tv show. So please lol do not make a video trashing a movie you have never seen it’s wrong and counter productive
This has to be the biggest piece of shit movies I’ve ever watched in my entire life
sussy teens 😳
Lol The Karen trailer is “so bad it’s good” comedic gold
"bad things happen to people who don't comply" ..........🙎🏾‍♂️
This is like the lifetime version of “Them”
Damn, Doggett really transformed when she got out of prison, huh
I don’t like the movie
Shit I’ve summoned the Karen character
The “suspecting” comment was done purposefully - - FYI.
shitty trailer. shitty movie. great commentary homie.
I dunno I actually think the concept could be cool; using the racist Karen as a tool to highlight the underlying insidious nature of white entitlement but my god this movie looks so bad. Very poorly done and the fact that you can tell it really has nothing to say about racism and microaggressions like "wHeRe diD yOu gUys CoMe fRom" just by watching the trailer is no bueno
6:20 * If I *_were_* Since we’re talking about grammar.
Whispers "karen character Karen character Karen character"  Screams :NOOOOOOOOOOOO 😂😂😂😂😂
i cannot fucking stop laughingggg 😭
It’s crazy cuz I’m watching the movie as I watch this video.. and honestly hearing that the lead actress for Karen is an ACTUAL Karen irl. I wanted to punch her through the screen, now it’s 10x worse 🤦🏾‍♀️ 😂😂
Manning is also the surname of one of the UK's most infamous hippies (on and offscreen) That's quite amusing right there
I'm tempted to spoil the movie here and add my own thoughts since I just watched it. (No, of course I didn't pay for it.) By the way, she's actually the president of the HOA in this movie. XD
Why does it say I’ve watched ur videos when I literally haven’t seen u on my YouTube fyp like all summer and haven’t watched u bc I’m like a gold fish🥺
Nobody gonna talk about the iMovie outro for the trailer lmfao
Welp this is what the msm has pushed as being the worst thing anyone anywhere could strive to be. This movie just jumping on the bandwagon of racist stuff. These are serious problems that need to be dealt with ASAP!
Ok but the lady who plays one of the new neighbors is honestly so pretty
Feel like this movie would be a way better horror comedy than a straight up horror film  Like someone give this movie to Jordan peele
i literally thought that the whole movie was a meme or sum. i just couldnt think of how someone can mean this for real lol
PENNSATUCKY it took too long to remember her name. She's a low tier actor lowkey and she's she fits this role TO A TEE I swear. Btw I mean Orange is the New Black.
They did dogget soo dirty!! She is a great actress but this is a mess!!
is this what you do for a living...? Like get to the fckin point...
Your voice don't match your look! LOL
Yeah, like making a movie about Karen would be funny 😐.
Oh shit. I only know that actress from OITNB. Had no idea she was one of those crazy Q people. News
"Is she nice?" .....idk if this is before the other parts of the trailer but she seems like a b****, which is not the same thing. LOL So many crap movies now. Funny thing is people LOVE watching Karens as much as Karens love the attention. This is part of the problem.   I didn't know Karen's were a racist thing tbh....lol  😂 Everything seems racist now though. It's sad because it really does take away from the worst racism that needs to be stopped vs the insignificant distractions. Tbh  if someone's feelings are hurt vs. if someone's actually making a threat or taking action then yeah that needs to be prioritized.  People are big babies and need to victimize themselves to a T now. I do it too much. But I have a roof over my head, a job, some family, I'm not dying as far as I know lol. No longer on the streets. This is stuff to celebrate every day.
D'angelo has perfecr pitch!?
I personally thought the movie was good🍿🤷🏽‍♀️
The actress said that she got most of her inspiration for the role from YouTube Karen's
why would anyone want to pay to see this when you can look at Public Freakout Compilation on youtube
I miss your documentaries a lot and know it shouldn't fall on you to report on heavy topics but I just wanted to say I thoroughly enjoyed them. Regardless I'm very happy you're happy, keep doing whatever makes you happy - it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks!
I wonder if the "Potatoe" thing is is a callback to a Dan Quayle gaffe from 1992. I'm not curious enough to look into it.
This is obviously over the top and just not good writing, but also like jesus there was so fucking much in that ad like I feel like that was the entire movie like why would I even watch the movie now, I know what it is
Hate the shirt tho
I feel like that Karen actress chose this character to redeem herself from her actual 'karen' behaviour. And she may want to say like "Hey I acted in this movie, which talks about racism against black. And I want to shed the light while acting as a karen. Therefore, I am far from racist."
This movie confuses me as much when the time a kid asked me “What are you?” My school’s are mainly Spanish like Dominicans. My parents usually pick me up or my nanny. In my old school however, my dad picked me up. Which was common. But when my mom picked me up I got a lot of experiences with color. A girl said “your adopted.” Idk if she said that because she saw my mom (since my my mom is light skin) at camp a boy asked me “What color is your dad since your mom is white.” This camp seen my mom pick me up lots of times. My mom is light skin so she’s mistaken as a white woman a lot. (Even tho she’s Dominican) Like why do people ask these questions? Like what do you want me to say?
When is it coming to cinemas I’m so excited to see this it’s obviously a masterpiece 😍😍😍

You have to admit the BLM protests spread covid and led to more hospitalizations and deaths based off of the death of a single person last year. So... guess those lives didn't matter
Such a wasted potential for a movie. If the trailer was more subtle and the lines were better and didn’t feel mostly ad libbed, the movie could be pretty good on social commentary with everything going on today.   I get the message here for the movie but it’s not subtle and it’s forced, the Karen is an actual Karen (which could make her feel entitled even more after this role like she can be a Karen and say it’s ok because it’s all in fun) and even though it’s basically been done by Jordan it’s not like they couldn’t find ways to do it in their own way. The creators of this movie not only had an opportunity to make a different portrayal the skipped it and made a knock off movie for capitalizing with minimal effort.   It’s never going to get better either because we as the consumers still end up paying to see these movies and they still make money and it only fuels the creators to want more for less because it’s clearly all they have to do.
The first thing they should have shown was Karen hanging her confederate flag as the black family moved in ….
It’s giving cheap filmed LMN movies crazy white person killing etc 😂✌🏽Karen is ass
BET 'black' mailed the actress into playing karen because of her trump support.
Is this for real? Is this supposed to be what a Karen really is? I mean, I get the Karen thing but to make a movie about? If I didn't feel sorry for ppl actually named Karen, I would def now, but worried about their safety. Cause this is so absurd... it's def not the same as Get Out. It's ridiculous garbage. But too many ppl taking things so literally, it's sad it's safe to assume basically anything.  Smh
And the Karen actor did so good in OITNB
she was in oitnb
This movie is absurd
I'm so tired of racism being potrayed as the only thing that comes with being black. I like that there are actually accurate potrayls, but can't we get a sci-fi movie with a black protagonist!? Like a western animated series named "Kipo: The age of the wonderbeasts", has the main cast being POC and actual character. I had enough of one-dimensional characters with only one purpose, I want more western productions to be diverse and finding a balance to racism and expressing the beauty that comes with being black. Guess that's my reason why I became hobby author. (Not in English btw, so excuse my mistakes)
Taryn's "Far From Racist" post reminds me SO MUCH of how my grandpa (who is obsessed with Trump and very against illegal immigrants) sit and tell us how he went to a high school who was mainly black and say he'd get beat up for hanging out with his black friends and say that means he isn't racist.
She was so good in Orange Is The New Black I don't understand. Her character was an extremely religious person who was very prejudiced against others - including being racist towards all inmates of all races other than white.
This could definitely compete with dhar mann ofc
Im gonna need you to review all the movies that Coke Daniels has directed. Im begging
Taryn was in oitnb right? She was super racist in that too lol can’t be a coincidence? 🤨🤨
There’s no fucking way this is going to be a real movie 😭
Bro is Taryn Manning even acting tho 👁👄👁 like wtf
Good concept for a movie, just poorly executed
Well obviously it will fail before even coming out     Because you can't let her talk to teh producer
Miss you Dangelo!
Bro u are laaaaaaaaaame
“What note is that” *laughs in played piano for two years*
Isn't that the chick from Orange is the new black
She reminds me of a character Cecily Strong would play in an SNL skit. Haha
I literally cringed into a ball watching this trailer
I can't believe this was more or less unironically planned as a movie.
I hate this I hate this I hate this I hate this
This summer coming to a manager near you, Karen
The actress playing Karen is actually really talented....I wonder if her poor acting is on purpose or something? Weird....
The Karen actress is actually hilarious in Orange Is The New Black
isn't that the girl from orange is the new black , and wasn't she racist in that too?
omggg that’s the same “Karen” from orange is the new black!! 😂 I guess she is Karen typecast now
Saying “Karen Character” really fast is actually a really good way to count the quintuplet swing.
You have a wife?
I think they were attempting to be funny and failed?
bro my teacher is in this movie no joke
Is that the chick from orange is the new black? Lol
Bet is really a black separatist network
I don’t have BET . WE DONT HAVE BET .  WE DONT HAVE BLACK CABLE TV NETWORK HERE .
No Taryn manning is .you saying that  means your ok with harassing people or violence against trump supporters
Well she was right about that . I’m surprised she wrote that
Get out .. about  whites wanting to be in black bodies
The real problem people are *mask Nazis* ,  *SJWs who harass people*
Not everyone wi confederate flag are racist. Some us are just “fuck the government” .”fuck communism”
I don’t care what skin ur in. If you harass me, are noisy and dirty , drug users , traffickers , have a criminal syndicate out of your apartment.  We got problems
The script was written by teenagers
If my neighbour is problematic it’s cuz they are noisy, disrupting, filthy, criminal ,    I don’t give a fuck what skin they have
It’s umm meant to cause division
The reality of a Karen movie is a symptom of social decay. And perhaps segregation is REQUIRED
It makes me sad you're ripping apart Taryn Manning, she's such an iconic actress/person. The writer of the film Coke Daniels is a black man and I am sure he's trying to raise awareness. I think whilst the film doesn't look amazing it still calls out Karens and  I think Daniels had good intensions.
Ohhhh Doggett, we love you!
So a Karen in real life who plays a Karen? And it’s supposed to talk about racism but the main character is a white crazy woman?Wow. I didn’t watch this movie but I’m pretty sure I hate it
jorden peele walked so that the karen movie could run
This depiction of Karen is inaccurate. She should be blonde haired and blue eyed, have a short bob haircut, and wear sunglasses.
So I’ve been over at your other channel like “where is friend at??? Why isn’t he posting??? And much to my “slow-Ass” surprise ..you have a whole other channel and you are posting lol🥴 wowwww .. well glad to see your doing well..and I will go catch up on all the vids I’ve missed
how’d u know it was an f sharp tho? that’s impressive
the movie feels like a parody of racism more than it feels like a horror movie about karens, but as a writer, i can see so much potential in the overall idea.   her black neighbours could be the focus/protagonists & they could have just moved into the neighbourhood. murders could start to take place shortly after, and people could suspect them a bit just because of that. it could depict karen as having a double life- she could be extremely pleasant in a suburban trophy wife kind of way, and aside from her nagging about stuff constantly and being a nuisance, she could be painfully unassuming and non-threatening….but she could also *secretly* be the murderer who is trying to clean up the neighbourhood by bringing the “bad ones” back to her basement where she tortures them karen style. (like, maybe cutting a fast food worker’s tongue out because they didn’t give her the right sauce, using medieval torture on girls who were wearing “inappropriate stuff” in front of her husband,  etc) and it could be done in a way that almost mirrors the eerie suburbia vibes of edward scissorhands, with the ominous trope of “it’s happening right under your nose” as seen in movies like american psycho & disturbia. 😳  as the murders start to gain traction, karen could try to blame it on the father in the household of her black neighbours using every trick in the book, which makes them suspicious, but it also makes the majority of the people in the neighbourhood turn against them entirely. as the plot builds, it could become obvious that her end game is to kill the black neighbours, make it look like a triple homicide + suicide, and pin the murders on the father by planting evidence in their house. so the black neighbours would be in danger of karen and no one in the neighbourhood would want anything to do with them because of her lies and campaigning against them. (a direct parallel to the way the system uses propaganda to demonize black people) the climax could involve a huge showdown between karen and the black family in which karen almost kills the mother and the eldest child, but in the end, the father hurts her badly and sends her to the hospital. the ending could be the black neighbours thinking they’re safe, and putting the house up for sale, hugging & feeling into their happy ever after, but then it could flash to karen waking up in the hospital and saying “i’d like to speak to a doctor.” in the “i’d like to speak to a manager.” voice.
Is it meant to be ironic/parody like Scary Movie or Not Another Teen Movie? It has to be right?
Noo I had to pause the video to die when you said "what is that an f sharp?" *proceeds to go and play it* "its an A" 🤣🤣🤣😂😂😂😂🥲🥲🥲🥲😂😂🤣
no one gives a fuck what you think
From the thumbnail, I was expecting this dude to be a lesbian. Imagine my surprise when I heard his voice.
This movie is proof we truly live in the darkest timeline
I don’t remember this episode of Orange is the new black
I like how D'Angelo isn't one-sided. Like you can see how open he is to stuff and I honestly respect it.
I’m sorry the whole time all I thought was pensatucky
I am forever here for your sass. The D sass. 👀
Yikes. She even plays a white supremacist in Orange is the New Black
Seriously...a horror movie?  This Karen reminds me of my next-door neighbor who we used to laughingly call, "The HOA Police."  A mild nuisance not horror.
I get that in the context of the trailer, “Slaving away in the kitchen” comes off racist but like…. In real life I don’t think anyone would think much of it? Maybe I’m wrong. But this is definitely a common phrase where I live.
WTF....I wish that they would ban shit like this. It does nothing to promote peace. But who am I to complain, when they are teaching young black children that they have to work so much harder because society will treat them differently and that nothing they can do will amount to anything because of society and how they will shit on their dreams. I mean what an injustice to tell a little kid. These politicians that keep this shit going need to be put in fuckin jail. I absolutely 💯 hate all racism, and the remote support of it through all the bullshit that society teaches young vulnerable children about their races is absolutely child abuse.
I’ll be honest - it looks like a pile of shite.
the fact that the movie is called Karen- THAT'S A YT PARODY SKIT NOT A MOVIE
The names of the directors other movies seems like the black experience as written by a white man
I am a fool
So tbh i skip it ~ ur ad 🤣👌✌️
Ngl I thought it was a SNL sketch
no way dude
Good commentary, but imo the protest were not for a legitimate reason. And some were riots, not protests.
Taryn Manning from BoomKat to Orange is the new black and now a Karen. Oh nu
i came here to dislike the video not because i like the karen movie but because i don't like this guy and i find his politics identical to the quote on quote karans end quote.
This movie is so unrealistic 😭😭. No white person is gong to harasses you because your black and live in a white neighbourhood.
Taryn Manning is constantly playing racists…that’s kinda interesting..
Isn’t calling someone a Karen racist? Or because she’s white it doesn’t count?
this entire trailer made me so uncomfortable, just for how bad it is
And it had to be Pensatucky... ??? LOL. Never forget "The Reckoning"!
Karen is from Orange is the New Black, just in case ya didn't know
lol
That Karen is Pennsatuckey from Orange Is The New Black!!!  AND she was Nola in Hustle & Flow!! Taryn Manning...and she fronts a rock band called Boomkat (The Wreckoning isn't half bad...it's actually pretty catchy...I found it by accident here on youtube)  Freaky, huh?
Oh Taryn Manning why
Never thought Jordan Peele was good at movies. I thought get out sucked. This movie will suck harder. But he and his counter part are great comedians. They should stick to that.
0:49 the poor dog she holding it up by it’s neck wtf
The trailer itself looks like something you would see out of a horror movie.
are we all gonna ignore the fact that the woman playing karen is the meth head inmate from orange is the new black
I heard this was fake lol... but, maybe that was a cover up lie, after the backlash
This movie downplay whole ass rasizm.
Real question: Can black people be racist too? (I've heard many opinions on this and would like to know what you think)
I'm crying and shaking rn
Bro I actually said too ez after saying Karen character. Damn I got played like a drum
Not the taryn manning
This trailer feels like a Tina Fey SNL skit
Pretty soon white conservatives are going to end up in the same kind of camps as  🇩🇪. Because liberals want to exaggerate racism in America. I’m native and black live in the south and have never been treated any different in my tiny southern town. If you don’t want to be profiled maybe keep tags up to date stop killing each other and selling drugs and blaming the white man for your laziness.
Naming a horror movie Karen is like naming a horror movie Tyrone. So stupid. Racism goes both ways.
This movie is disgusting and does nothing but further the divide in this country.
the start of the movie reminds me of the series THEM
The reasons you think this movie is absurd, is actually  . . . absurd.  The fact that it's openly racist in and of itself as a propaganda film, and isn't immediately called out as such in the media, is crazy. I'm trying to imagine a move called "Shaquinah" based on a negative black female stereotype, and openly racist tropes, like "Oh, you mean there's an uppity, entitled black woman named Shaquinah living next door?" -- and the movie not immediately boycotted.   Get real. lol
Karen
The “Aaron’sanimals - Romeow and Juliet” Karen acting was better than this.. wow.
get out was also shit.
that's doggett/pennstucky from orange is the new black.... :-(((((
please when i clicked on this video i was expecting a comedy movie not this im so confused
ok i love u but i also loveeee Taryn Manning . bro she is an amazing actress idk wtf she was doing here . Watch orange is the new black or Cleveland abduction . she’s so good in those .
I’m not sure what’s worse about this. The movie or the fact that the actress who’s playing Karen was Pennsatucky from Orange is the new black. The irony here is very real.
nobody: literally everyone: Y I K E S
Giving me Them but boneless
It's definitely tongue and cheek... I think
The fact that they had a noose in the k … wtf
And to think… I just released MY OWN trailer for MY OWN Karen Film
The ending with "bad things happen to those who don't comply" just made me laugh so hard. Dude, "comply" does not fit in that sentence especially since it's supposed to be dramatic.
Did anyone notice the "Karen" is the girl from orange is the new black lol
She didn't stop acting her orange is the new black role lmao
This literally made me laugh out loud. How pathetic was the acting though?  😂😂😂
looks like a darman video lol
why...
karen karen karen  nice Fu*kin model
You got me on the ad read 😂
3:45 that transition is smooth as fuck
Well now I see why tarryn was hired to be the Jesus loving crackhead pennsatucky on orange is the new black 💀
white liberals for ya....
I’m sorry you’re name is Karen... here’s a chocolate bar
Whitewashed racism!! 😂 I’m dying, that’s just too funny
Who would watch this?
They named a horror film Karen. Why did they think that was a good name wtf
completely unrelated but hi texas friend
she was better at pretending to be racist in oitnb
YO WHAT THATS THE BITCH FROM OITNB
Is Karen gonna kill them in so confused
can we talk about how karen is pennsatucky from orange is the new black?? she deserves better than this lol
I started to say “Karen Character” 3 times. But it felt like the equivalent of saying Candyman 3 times and I just felt unsafe 😂   And actually a lot more terrified 😂
this movie is racism porn. yawn
Taryn Manning is an amazing actress. She just had to tone it down to fit the rest of the cast.  EDIT: Kinda wish I'd have waited to comment until AFTER the video.... cringe
I’m from the South meaning I have seen the Confederate battle flag multiple times but I have never seen it on a soap dispenser.😂😂 This is why I will never take the movie seriously. I don’t own anything CSA related but still that’s ridiculous.
I refuse to believe that this is real I refuse to believe that this is real I refuse to believe that this is real
Oh my god, that's Pennsatucky, voice gives her away. 😳Gonna have to watch it now.
This movie feels like a parody skit on SNL.
Ppl like Steve Bannon hv empowered ppl to "..wear your racism like a badge of honor" ... hence the wide-spread whitewashing.
I don't like you
The acting is bad but this does depict a lot of subtle racism I’ve experienced and seen. I’m a black male and I have had many black males I know explain how some of their racist yte female bosses have subtely hit on them. Especially the one’s that were gunning for them. Weird.
I'm watching this vid and the whole time I'm like "is this lip synced"
I want an actual good Karen horror movie now
Yo this video is also giving out the wrong message i know that there are police officers that did some crappy things but this is basically telling everyone yeah all police officers are bad and racist and killed a bunch of black people and they hate black people
Dhar mann makes better Karen videos
The police don't just arrest someone without evidence When a Karen calls them
Thanks for fooling me into summing a Karen....
This *could've* been a good concept for a movie, *maybe* - but the way they went about it was so heavy-handed and 2 dimensional. And of course Pennsatucky was the Karen. 🙄
1:25-2:10 end of smooth as hell sponsor
I take my comment about Taryn Manning back I have reached 12:00 in the video 🥲
Pensetucky? Wow
Drinking coffee and watching this was a mistake... good god this trailer is laughably bad.
Oh no... they took it too far
As cringe and horrible as it is, I wanna watch it. Idk why
“Them” did it so much better
Yall just trying to assassinate her character 🤭🤭
An annoying white woman named Karen is a racist stereotype. Imagine if there were memes about an annoying female critical race theorist named Shaniqua. 'Oh, she's such a Shaniqua'. The first is politically correct and everywhere. The second would probably get someone banned from social media and fired at the request of Jen Psaki calling Big Tech on the WH's private hotline.
They should've cast Tommyinnit as the Karen
How are people mad at this movie for being racist 😂 this is directed by  black man on black entertainment. Blame Hollywood for pandering to social justice warriors.
That was so funny lamoooo
I cannot stand watching Karen videos. They’re too cringy.
They should have gave Karen the blonde Karen shity haircut
I shouted at my iPad for that smooooooth ad transition. legit upset with you 😅😭😭😭
That's why china will over take America because the US can't even fixed it's race issue. China don't have to worry about that problem
That actress played the racist Christian homophobe in Orange is the New black
I enjoyed this, as I usually enjoy D’Angelo’s work so just my opinion but - I feel like people can’t win for losing some times ! If they went in hard - everyone would be saying how overtly racist and offbeat it was. Now it’s disrespectful bc it’s not racist enough.... 🤨😳🤔
You are a racist.
🙈🙉🙊
Omg I can tell its trash from the beginning just let jordan peele do it
K🧍‍♀️R E N
at least we know taryn wasn’t acting when it when to her role in oitnb😂
This is HOLLYWOOD TRASH! THERE IS BETTER ACTING IN SOFT P0RN! HOW LOW WILL THEY GO TO MAKE A BUCK???? PATHETIC! I AM MORE AND MORE EMBARRASSED TO BE AN AMERICAN THESE DAYS IN THESE "WOKE TIMES!"  GO SERVE YOUR COUNTRY OR LIVE IN COMMUNIST CHINA BEFORE YOU TRY TO INDOCTRINATE THE YOUTH OF TODAY WITH THIS COMPLETE GARBAGE !!! THERE IS NO WHTE SUPREMACY OR HATRED TOWARDS BLACK PEOPLE!! PLEASE STOP THESE LIES!!! SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE IS NOT EVEN FUNNY ANYMORE BECAUSE WHEN YOU GO WOKE YOU GO BROKE!!!
Dude this has made me want to go to college and get a film degree just so I can make a movie about Karen’s but it’s comady and it’s not meant to be portrayed like A horror movie
To be fair i think it's supposed to be a horror parody like scary movie or haunted house.
Dumb idea, hope it flops and the writers/director never get anywhere near a movie creation again
Segway into your ad read was absolute gold
"I don't remember the day I saw (the Earth) created" is a criminally underrated line.
What even is this movie…. Just why?
I said Karen character 3x and my cat showed up to eat food
stop if that was really an F# I was going to die. like ur telling me this man has perfect pitch TOO???? WTF
You are a true player! I just subscribed to a "secret channel" with no content because you kind of dare me not to...my god, this pandemic has made me dumb, literally! Not that I was that smart before...but DAMN! check mate Wallace!
Props to your editor they're awesome!
I heard about this movie coming out  but I honestly no lie thought the person who told me about it was joking
what is his hairstyle called
This movie is made to stir hatred for white people that's it.
they missed the hair and the tamtrums. lol
The potato with an E might be a Dan Quail reference but I’m old and obviously that story isn’t timeless. Also idk the context of that movie nor am I trying to find out.
I feel like I need to watch the trailer straight through, because watching it with all of these interruptions is very nerve wracking
Wait...so BET turned down my hilarious and cute sit com treatment but they made this....? Wow 😣
Awww Tia's husband is in this. Ugh. Shame
Right after he said it’s sounds like the ai only got fed black square posts from Instagram i get an Instagram ad
This is racism aswell..it stereotypes a female as a Karen...it's trying to make fun of a complete nonsense to get clicks.
Is this a parody movie about a subject that should never have a parody made out of it? This doesn't make me want to talk about the subject of racism more, it makes me highly uncomfortable like someone is deliberately laughing at a car accident where people died. No, just no.
'karen' delivered those lines a little TOO easily
They should have made her nice to begin with and not start with her being a dick then it would be more suspenseful. But it's also done before alot of times so really it's nothing new
this movies scary for the wrong reasons
My reaction: https://youtu.be/gHwwenPlQWE
Her character is orange is the new black is also an extreme Jesus freak, so now I feel like her real personality is a mix between this Karen character and her OITNB character
Subscribed.
They’re working on a sequel called “Karen Vs Shaniqua: Endgame”  I just love how they act like only white women are rude to customer service employees. Anyone who has lived in a diverse area can confirm that there are TONS of black women “Karens” called “shaniquas”
I think if it was labeled as a Drama it would be judged as a different trash then a Horror trash.
Oh thank you for bringing up the directors past movies. THAT is hilarious
Taryn Manning-- the actress of Karen-- also plays the racist bible-loving character in Orange is the New Black.... kinda odd that she is only catering to roles in which she can say and act out racist beliefs
So... I'm guessing white director, white script writer?
LOL too funny
That doesn't make her a Karen just for saying what she said in her comment.  I agree with what she said about the guy who funded BLM. There are plenty of other black that agree too. Plenty who also don't mind trump or even support him.
Nah, Linus tech tips still has the smoothest segues. Yours was still fire though.
And the way the trailer gave away the whole plot 😭
I thought it supposes to be a parody. It's Pennsatucky (however you spell it)
“There’s that” “that being said” “there’s that” “there’s that”   Yeah, so there’s that. Now, that being said….
She should’ve stayed on Orange is the New Black.
I thought the trailer was hilarious.  It's supposed to be a comedy no?
I want to see it.  Is it actually called "Karen"?
Now I'm not black but I love history and I do love black history...and boy was I pissed off with that stupid show "In Them"...now I'm not black (I'm Hispanic if you wondering) but fuck was that a slap in the history books for black ppl...all they went through in that specific era boiled down to a crappy horror show 😭 this movie reminds me exactly of that show. It was already a horrific time for black ppl why you gotta put in imaginary shit?
Nooo isn’t Karen played by the same actress who played that “white trash” character from OITNB?
Its literally just some washed up asshole who is taking advantage of a centuries old crisis for monetary gian, and its not even trying to hide it, either.... its just blatantly pandering to the white suburban moms that got uncomfortable whenever blm started taking off and now they need ammo to dismiss it all with.... they'll use this "horror" film for that claiming its just a stupid teenage fantasy that's being unplanned by the media, they're uncomfortable with being held accountable and with horror films and with teenage rebellion so now they have all of their package laid out for them to dismiss it all and ban their Christian children from watching it and keep another section of our culture closed off from the truth.
They shoulda never used the meth head from Orange Is The New Black. She still sounds like she got meth mouth. Totally horrible plot, horrible acting, horrible movie. I hope Rotten Tomatoes doesn't rate this because that would be giving it credit to actually be called a movie. This is a dumpster fire. I'd rather watch (this was a real film that has never been released) Ku Klux Klan members that want to leave the Klan. Waaaaaaaay more interesting than this trash. I'm more offended as a screenwriter than I am as a black person. Utter garbage. 😡🤬 Why would B.E.T. make this? Don't Tyler Perry still got milk in his teat? What a pitiful turd of a movie... smdh
One thing that will immediately tell me you're racist is showing a photo of you with black ppl to prove you're not racist
are we gonna talk about how the lady who plays Karen is the meth head girl from orange is the new black lmao
Why is the the girl oitnb on here?
☠️ So you’re telling me this woman didn’t just act like the character… she is the character
This is the most I've seen of the Karen trailer and.... I had a next door neighbor when I was growing up that was EXACTLY like that 🙃 my mom moved in her (black) fiance and this b*tch flipped a switch and always started drama. Including the whole flipping of trash cans and calling police saying she felt "threatened" 🙃 he was so quiet and such a cinnamon roll
Karen, more like, America yet again thinking their experiences are universal.
5:23 this is hilarious, first time hearing this in my entire life.
When he showed Taryn Manning’s tweet, I realized that she’s actually just her character from Orange is the New Black.
The lady who plays Karen was great in orange is the new black
Fuck no....now she's gonna show up at my job as usual
Great work bro to call out BS when YOU see it !!!!!!! Exactly new splash to Hollywood we do not care about our race we care about individual action regardless of skin color !!!¡!!
This movie tryna be a horror or whatever is SO bad that the demon refused to participate in it.
the trailer scares me 😟
Honestly thought it was an SNL skit / parody mix.  Racism obviously exists but this trailer makes me think it really isn't an issue if you have to make this up.  If racism was a real issue then they could have done a movie based on a true story.  People are over the vicitimization movies.  They want to see triumph, encouragement and inspirational movies.  The problem with movies like Karen is it creates a false narrative.  They should have named it Hillary.
omg tiffany from OITNB ☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️  i fr wouldn’t be able to take her seriously throughout the movie. i would just keep picturing her character
Wow I'm really excited about this movie and me and my husband are going to make it a date night I'm going to watch it together or the trailer we are going to watch🥵
Why are they white washing racism 😒??? Wtf....just wtf??? I'm done.  This movie is ri-damn-diculous
WAIT IS THAT GIRL FROM OITNB THAT PLAYS THE KAREN??? ITS EATING ME UP TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO SHE IS  Edit: I just got the actress of the "karen" part and Im gonna assume yes...and im not suprised at all
I'm deeply confused if a "Karen" horror movie, is a comedy or not.
The film looks like something that mystery science theatre 3000 would go through
https://youtu.be/Qa44gWUNXvM
her acting is much better in orange is the new black LOL
D' Angelo is the only one who can rival queen Elizabeth by seeing the creation of the world
I have a feeling that that trailer just spoiled the whole movie lmao
PLEASE lmao they got the actress who played tiffany doggett/pennsatucky in orange is the new black to be karen 😭😭
It’s just a cash grab now that pretty much everyone has a political stance ppl r cashin big corporations don’t care abt the cause or the ppl around them it’s all abt money because ppl don’t actually know what matters
This is sad because she was actually dope in Orange is the New Black
the fact that she’s really like that AFTER being on oitnb!!! was she really acting in this movie cause kinda doesn’t seem like it
Who made the Potatoe Salad is actually pretty damn funny lmfao
SHE'S THE VERY RELIGIOUS AND METH ADDICTED ONE IN ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK
Dhar Mann: so you see
thats it :( im changing my name legally
3:41: I screamed  ψ(｀∇´)ψ
Link to his other channel?
Everybody is racist especially black people
brooo i was abt to comment just watch get out but then i got to the part in the vid where he mentioned get out 😭💀
Over here saying “Karen character” over and over again and now I’m terrified I really did summon her
Being racist and entitled at 3am SCARY* GONE WRONG* COPS CALLED*
d’amelio walnut video
"some very suspecting teenagers" ma'am, just call them sus
This movie is as logical and something to take serious as the movie Beneath Us, and Girl House                                       😂😂😂😂😂
It really didn't give what they all thought it gave , it just didn't.
This is so silly I watched it in so much silence and just scrolled on lol I was like well what an interesting worm hole I e found myself in.. 🥴
As a black people in America lol
Bruh I'm gonna be commenting all through this video. Because lol talk about it!
I feel like they could make this movie, but they don’t need to.Much less capitalize off of it.
Lol damn, what an insanely attractive young man 😎😎😎
"this is like serving-my-wife-divorce-papers-at-3-am-prank-free-iphone-giveaway acting"
This is one of the most cringe movies that will exist
That man IS insanely attractive!!
This... trailer has to be ironic, right? They can't be taking themselves seriously.
I bet this movie is going to crumble in the box office
Recasting Karen would have made the whole thing about 2% less awful
When I first saw this trailer, I thought it was a parody. Like an SNL sketch or something.
I wonder why people are failing to recognize satire
the entire time watching that trailer i thought james corden was gonna pop outta nowhere and be like 'that's all for today's show' or something. it didn't even feel like a real trailer-
Not related, but is he gay? I don't understand
Also the fact that the main role of the racist character entirely revolves around a woman lol
"The exact day *I saw it created"*
This is actually amazing...      ....ly hilarious!!!   I need to find someway to see this without any of my money going to BET. (just kidding.. I already know how).
Her brothers name is mike wind🤨
"I literally live in Texas", wait from what I remember, Texas was pretty chill- "South Texas" OHHHHH
The woman who plays Karen starred in Britney Spears move crossroads. True story.
I mean this has to be satire, right lol? If they actually intended this movie to be serious then.... wow lol
Black Americans are exhausting 😒
she looked like shed be a karen outside of the movie 😐
I think it's gonna be the greatest laugh out loud comedy of the year.
Using memes in Hollywood productions is supremely cringe
How did they manage to downplay racism while ridiculously over-dramatizing every other aspect of the movie
the karen movie is just a youtube skit, no one could tell me otherwise
Racism is not really an issue where I live. (West Europe) and I know it's very serious in the USA. Could this movie work in Europe as it's a ''far away from me'' kind of issue?
I feel bad for Cory Hardrict....it seems that he should have spoken to the manager before signing on to be a part of this film. Sometimes the money is just not worth it.
this very weirdly feels like satire ?
Racism isn’t trivial, and it happens every day. Thanks for bringing it up in this commentary of the trailer. Obviously, terrible things happen to black people in the US. Far worse things that what this trailer portrays. Black people (especially men) can’t even walk down the street without people side eyeing or darting out of their way in fear. We are all people. So many different races get treated like absolute garbage in America, and it’s about time that we treat every human with the respect that they deserve. As well as treating the people that have been oppressed and discriminated against with the love, kindness, and respect that they deserve. As a white person, I do not understand that sort of struggle. But fucking hell, everyone deserves to feel safe walking down the god damned street and not fear for their lives.  I just feel sorry for people who feel a certain way toward any race. Racism isn’t cool. Fuck racists. Sorry for my rant.
I wonder why anyone would feel that way about black people? Hmmm Makes no sense.
BET is making this, I have literally no hopes at all
blacks: everyone should worry about racism against us all the time movie about it: exists blacks: no, not like that
Who names their child  coke?
when i pirate this movie i will watch it as a comedy
I now *USED*  like Orange is the New Black...
It’s ideas like this movie and agendas behind it that is the real problem. Wake up knuckle heads. Dont fall for this crap.
Just no! As a BLM supporter and Democrat this movie so wrong and racist! The directors just put every woke Twitter stereotype in the book and made a movie out of a Reddit meme when that money could be used for funding for enjoyable movies and people in need.  Instead of bringing us together to fight racism your just bringing us apart and giving BLM and white people a bad look. This movie is just an excuse to profit off of struggles in the black community to make yourself look “ethnic” and “woke” even though it seems like something that a millennial white woman would make who’s personality is Twitter posts. I am tired of Hollywood thinking that dividing  people and making racist movies about racism is cool! They are even comparing the kkk and confederacy to an entitled woman wtf! The Karen meme in general was cringe to start and the only funny part of this is that they expect you to take it seriously.
Yo are you married? Someone put a ring on it 💍
the actress who plays karen in this was so good in orange is the new black…what happened?? 😭😭
9:08 finally someone talking about this part
racism been white washed already this is just the icing on the cake
laugh at qanon but there's some legit scary shit going on and youtube and facebook are doing their best to censor every crumb of it. Why? Why did they remove my private video with zero views for "cyberbullying" if they weren't tryna erase the truth?  but yeah, this movie looks like trash.
The actress thats acting as the karen is also the very homophobic christian in orange is the new black its as if in all her roles shes an ass….
Theres like some sort of a trend at the moment with shows having “black pain”as their main depiction. I have no idea why. Its kinda annoying.
Your black!
If you stand in front of a mirror at night and say "Karen Character" three times, a middle aged white woman dressed in head to toe lululemon and carrying a fake designer bag will appear and demand to speak to your manager.
This is like Lifetime movie acting. My mom would like this.
This trailer only creates a bigger divide in society. White people are not this angry and are not the only people who are racist.  There are not only white police officers, and not all cops are corrupt.  I was really hoping that D'Angelo would point out how dividing this trailer is, and not disapprove of it just because they made the racism abvious with little room for interpretation.
The sad fact is that some humans are like this... Jeez i wish the world stopped this shit
Movie points out that it’s a movie
Love BET bc it’s BET but I hate most of there content. Tf
Not me thinking the actual  first scene was happening 😂
Where in South Texas are you from? I live so far South, near the border that the four counties here, called the valley for some reason, are a bubble. We're not a diverse place, at around 95% Hispanic lol... in all of high school I remember being exposed to like 3 Black people, 2 Asians, maybe 4 white people hahaaaa
Cuz supporting trump makes you racist. Lol change the record y’all.
Have you ever seen a white actor play a racist role terribly?
*Looks at thumbnail* *Listens to voice* - was not expecting voice to be that deep.
I once read an interview where Taryn Manning said she was tired of getting typecast as a drug addict... I wonder if she thinks this is an actual improvement from that.
This is the same chicken head from Hustle and Flow, I'm not listening to Karen's but I'm definitely not from trailer park Karen's like chick what and don't get me started on her racist I'm not a racist Trump rant 🤦🏾‍♀️ ( this is America) plus BET is whyte owned soooooooo yeah
The whole movie is one fat April fools prank. I’m calling it now
This is the most stupid looking movie I have ever seen. I thought it was a joke at first. I can't even summon a speak to the manager joke.
The crazy part is she played a very convincing racist in orange is.the new black. That's probably why she got the job but without the Netflix language and the directors it just doesn't work that well
Anyone knows the outro tune/song at 15:20??
Wasn’t taryn manning Taylor manning …wasn’t she on OITNB ? She played the Christian who didn’t like gays ?👀👀
6:29 um dude, im pretty sure if anyone yelled in a police officers face we would all be in deep trouble
this feels like they are trying to make a joke out of a real life problem for some people. Canceled.
'I don't remember the exact day I saw [the world] created'  Bruh I didn't realise you were the queen
Sorry but "Karen character" is very easy to say 5 times fast. Try saying "toy boat" 5 times fast then you'll understand what a true struggle is ;)
the trailer showed the whole movie so why should we watch t he full thing now?
This shit got me ROLLING while at the same time feeling so uncomfortable. I'm waiting for someone to say "sike" 😅 god..
As a white person, just seeing this little bit and then you saying “this isn’t the worst it could be” just makes me so angry at racists. Like y’all don’t deserve it y’all just trynna live ur lives and be happy like the rest of us. I just hate rasicts
is this movie supposed to be a comedy? cuz there are tastefull ways to write comedy about racism and this isn't it
That being said, I think this is satire like don’t be a menace in south central while drinking your juice in the hood
“I want Quentin Tarantino hard R heated gaming moment level racism” 💀💀💀💀
Woww yesssss let's all just downplay racism!!! 😻😻 Seriously, fuck this movie
I said messed up carrot character instead of Karen Character
Bruh I KNEW IT WAS A , I'm a pianist and I knew the note was a cuz like A lot of songs start and end with A coupled with C or D
I mean, I thought this was a joke movie,but this is real! Oh wow.
Its so sad because "im not racist, i had black friends" is such an easy problematic statement to identify by now, for anyone who has read even an instagram post on racism or a basic 101, that it means these people havent taken not even a second of their time to dp a lazy bare minimum way below average
Im already scared of the karen footages on the internet, i dont knowg  How i feel about this though, seems like an oversimplification and im just not sure of what the main goal of the movie is?
this is twitter: the movie
I can't find the new youtube channel! Could somebnody help me find it please?
Oh this movie is gonna be horrible. I love your take on it. I just wonder if it’s good for BIPOC to constantly see trauma aimed at them. I’ve heard the term trauma-porn thrown around and this feels like it, except done badly. Either way, when the movie comes out, I am looking forward to your commentary!
I'm black, and I'm embarrassed by this atrocity! Thanks a lot BET!
Anyone got that piano sheet music?
Just another addition of the elites' attempts to keep us divided and stupid. Fun times.
Does D'Angelo have perfect pitch 😂😂😍
I guess Pensatucky settled down
I thought it was a snl skit.. a real real bad one at that
This whole trailer feels like an early youtube comedy sketch. Like, if the karen meme was popular back then, I feel that this is the kind of content they would make.
4:26 that's the crack Jesus lady from orange is the new black
The movie is obviously not going to be done well, but I do think that presenting low key rasicm as still being racist (in a good way) would be good for people who think they aren't racist
It’s very obvious this is trying to bank on the same “r@cism is the horror movie monster” think jordan peele has going on but…. It just completely misses the mark and overdoes the racism to a cartoonish extent Maybe they had to dial up the r@cism to convince Taryn that she was nothing like her character. She also played a very blatantly and violently r@cist/h0m0phobic character in Orange Is The New Black.
What is that, an f# ? *plays key * ( ಠ ಠ ) *zooms in whilst plays key* ( ಠ ಠ ).......it's an A ( ಠ ಠ )😳      I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED SO HARDDDD OMG
not me waiting for Beck Bennet from SNL to start narrating the trailer cuz it's an SNL skit
Karen said that the trashcan had to be taken off the sidewalk after being picked up, when she tipped over the trashcan you can clearly see that there is trash in the trashcan. The couple should report her to the HOA
I wonder how Jordan Peele feels. I think it'd be funny to have his take on the situation.
So this is real?
Thanks for the review and putting into an objective review. See who the movie was funded by.   A lot of media today is passive/aggressive, meaning it doesn’t hit you smack in the face as the movie itself sets up a “universe “ that is expected to intimidate people on a subconscious level. You “see” these things happen and it reinforces that negative thought, which in turn creates a level of stress…added together with real experiences it eventually affects the body and mind.  In other words…don’t watch that kind of s………
The angry brick informally squeeze because conga congruently bounce after a abstracted salesman. public, equable equipment
We need more love and compassion and all these companies decide to spew propaganda and fear to divide us all... It's WE the PEOPLE... Not ME or Them or They.
He married now? Did I miss something?
This looks like it was made from an iMovie trailer template.
I will have to sleep with the lights on after watching this. 🙄
This was a comment on the trailer that made me laugh: Me: mom can we watch get out Mom: we have get out at home Get out at home:
i know alot of White people , there all just like this !!!!   BLM
I thought it was a horror comedy when I saw it....I still think this.
This movie is just a rip off of Lakeview Terrace with Samuel Jackson. A racist black man harassing a interracial couple.
wait wait wait wait, ITS A REAL MOVIE oh god I thought it was just a joke oh god
she also posted a picture of her and her partner and i believe her partner was a cop and she was saying bluelivesmatter or something similar. i screenshotted the post at the time but i dont think i have it anymore idk
And they cast fair skin black people of course
if white people are going to keep profiting off poc’s trauma can they at least do it right :/
This feels like a Dhar Mann video that ends with Karen being like “oh wow... I guess I WAS being kinda mean....”
I think the movie is extremely unnecessary you can literally look up Karen compilation on YouTube and find the exact same stuff but more eventful
hold on a second is that TARYN MANNING jesus christ
I tried to touch the comment section on the phone and that moment the ad caused the screen to roll down, making me touch the subscribe button instead... This evil Youtube tried to make ne unsub theAngelo!!!
heheehe funny piano note make laughy
This deadass looks like a comedy sketch. How disgusting and disappointing.
SPITS COFFEE* Excuse me, WHY DOES SHE HAVE A GUN?!
Hey ita Bucket from Orange is the New Black. Stupid show and now with a stupid movie....
ALL KAREN’S NEED TO BE CHARGED WITH A HATE CRIME !! 🐽🐽🐽🐷🐷🐷☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️🤣🤣🤣🤣🎉🎉🎉🎉🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥
Wait that's the chick from Orange in the New Black 😳😳
It is not necessarily about racism. It is about Karenism.
Try using "effectively" more often. "Officially" doesn't fit quite as well, and it certainly doesn't feel as empowered. You will sound much more official if you use effectively effectively. Trust me.
I find it so wrong for a racist to be paid to be racist.
It’s funny because on the political spectrum Both sides agree, ignoring the extremist, that this movie is dumb
"They have somehow white washed racism itself"😂
I honestly don't have a problem with her bad acting cause Karens irl act like they're not real humans
You don't need subtlety when something is supposed to be coincidental.. hence the whole point of the comments in the scene..
This is just the plot of Them but set in modern times lol
This literally sounds like a movie written based off social media posts
When this movie releases, racism rates will drop to 0%
D’Angelo waiting for me to say Karen Character gave me Dora flashbacks hahaha
the karen character reminds me of my ex mother in law
Genuinely thought it was an SNL skit. 😑😶😶😶
Taryn Manning (aka the lady who plays Karen in this film) was actually really good in OITNB. Interesting choice from her to do this movie.
almost had to cancel you for having perfect pitch
It's gotten to the point the we've become a parody of ourselves. Also, can we all clam down about Peele? His movies are good but he's no genius and eventually, with therapy, I believe that we can all eventually come to admit that his writing is actually pretty campy and on the nose.
It really bugs me that so many movies that want to try and “explore” racism is that the racism is always over the top so that way the white people watching it arent “uncomfortable” when like,, we (white people) should be We do a lot of stuff that’s so ingrained in racism without us realizing it and we don’t want to acknowledge that. We see stuff like this and go “well I don’t say the n word so I’m not racist” when that’s just not what it is obviously.
I haven't watched your videos in like a year and a half and I just want to say your room looks so nice and you've really improved in charisma!!!
Okay but how the hell did she play a crazy Christian turned good if she's really just a crazy Christian???
The movie is literally just: *racism* (horror noises)
"Some veeeery suspecting teenageers?" THE ACTING XD
When D'Angelo said handsome young man doing an ad read i was like damn they're putting ads right in our faces in movies now? I knew it was coming
Huh
de angelo i’m in south texas and i would love to have you as a neighbor. i live in the barrio tho. so it’s all just mexicans. so idk they’re not that racist
i’m officially a fool
What’s there to complain about? This is literally what liberals sound like. All the time. This is your movie.
Isn't the most common purpose of horror films to explore real human phenomenons and our collective subconscious fears and anxieties through the exaggerated and fantastical? This is just plain real life with horror music slapped on top and subsequently this only leads it to become the sensationalization of the every day injustices suffered by PoC. Neither monster movie nor documentary, it is all flat, empty confusion.
this seems like a dhar man video LOL
I can't get over the actress for the Karen. She was in Orange is the New Black and she will forever be a meth head to me lmao
The Karen actress was in Hustle and Flow and OITNB. So she definitely had experience. This movie perfectly embodies how Hollywood elites see the social issues of us peasants. Also clearly shows no one who contributed to the script and storyline has ever encountered a real racist or racist situation before.
“Karen” is such an overused joke, but at least it is a JOKE. Now I actually feel bad for anyone named Karen
Karen is so overused and I hate it
Damnit, first i fell for the sponsor transition, then i summoned the Karen! What's next? Am i gonna get cancelled on Twitter?
This is really cringeworthy.
Fake sponsor good video
Thais just the Trailer ?! Thought thats the whole movie
How does it feel to be the black that your YouTube friends will reference to for any racist take they have and are still covered if you fall by the likes of Tommy c and augie
Omg LMFAOOOOOOOOO
Pennsutucky?
Who the hell is this even made for? I have no idea who would see the trailer and then go “totally going to spend money to see this shit”. Wouldnt watch even if I was paid for it, and I really need some extra cash at the moment.
Laughed at Karen character, yes, did do it.
"They are whitewashing racism itself" lmaoooo even for a movie that is so clearly trying to pander blacks you people somehow still find a way to find it "oppressive"
Omg! Did she play herself in Orange is the new Black?
“I’m a black person” “I know” Like...did anyone expect the girl to just...not notice she was black? Just because someone isn’t racist doesn’t mean they literally don’t see color.
Isn’t that pensatucky  from orange is the new black ?
if the acting is terribly done by the "karen"character, then she did a good job. but still, i cant take this movie seriously, its rediculous lol
karen: im calling the manager *you have become the very thing you sought to destroy*
The calm protests were no biggie but the destructive ones where burning down buildings etc etc do nothing for the cause and we can thank BLM for that. As far as I can see they do nothing for the black society unless I am wrong. This actress does a 100 degree change not that what she said is here or there because lots of people believe elements of what she posted with out being and acting foolish
Is this another 'villain origins movie' like Joker and Maleficent? Are we supposed to feel sorry for Karens now?
not the methhead from “orange is the new black” being karen
The way the sole villain is a white woman who victimises mostly black men but also a white man! The only white man in the movie is a victim. And the movie was made by a white man. Black women not present in the movie... To me this looks just like Woke Misogyny
<3
The difference between acting and larping: you get paid for acting. You have to pay to larp. The skill level between the two is... Up for debate xD
You know most people relate to Karen as being a liberal Democrat.  It would be funny if it wasn't that it is being used to drive a wedge between good American people of all colors by groups that just wanting to destroy America.  That's the real ending they want.  God Bless and help us all.
come see KAZ in 3D
The woman who plays Karen is abusive to her partners, irl. Just absolutely trash of a woman.
:0
3:08 I’m screaming at “it’s an A”
Coming out of 2020, arguably the term both saturated and defined by the term "sus," how did they fuck up "suspecting"???
One time a lady got mad at me for having pink faded in my hair, she called me a slur lol
this is literally the show "little fires everywhere" except with bad acting and no actual substance
Shout out to D'Angelo for giving us the real information we need - what note the horror movie piano sound is.
I know this sounds ridiculous of me to say, but this is also pretty racist against white people. If we forget for a moment that the main character is literally named after a slur based on the meme, she's such a flat and one note character that she's basically a strawman for white women. She's dressed like a Karen and obviously acts like one too, but the lengths she goes to terrorize her neighbors is ridiculous even by Karen standards. I doubt that anyone with any common sense would go out of their way to install security cameras on their neighbor's house just to watch them exist while being black. I also doubt that most Karens would be so gung-ho about their racism that they would literally try to kill their neighbors. This movie makes it seem like white people spend their time twirling their evil mustaches and plotting evil schemes to oppress black people, which just isn't true on the larger scale. I think that most people are simply unaware that this happens because it doesn't apply to them, and movies like this only add to that ignorance because it's such a ridiculous strawman that no one should take it seriously. It sucks that a movie trying so hard to bring awareness to these very real issues is already such a face-palm failure, but at least we have "Get Out" to make up for this absurdity.
Jesus can save us from sin. Jesus is waiting for you to come to Him, He'll never cast you away from Himself.  He calls us all to repentance, He knocks on the door of our hearts because he loves us and wants to save us. when you do believe and the Holy Spirit will come in and lead you to repent of your sins and God will forgive you of your sins and cleanse you by the blood of Jesus and you'll get born again by His Holy Spirit and have His salvation, you will become a new creation.

She's a great acrtess tbh, but the they could put Angelina Jolie in that role, it wouldnt happen anyway I dont like her as a person, but I've seen her in OITNB and SOA, and she was pretty nice
Eyyy I live in South Texas tooo
Isnt that Tia's husband? Oh no sweetie
And why does that TM woman get work after making those statements.   Well, work probably no one in their right mind would accept.
No cus they should’ve just called it “the neighbour”
I was half expecting the trailer to end only for it to cut to a card with jazzy music and recommendations for other SNL videos, it would have made the viewing experience far less painful
i knew the karen mem has gone too far
That actress was so good in orange is the new black. Bad script is probably the reason for the bad acting.
Why is she kicking the trash can when the garbage truck hasn't even been there yet? It's not time to take it in b*tch, that's why it's still full.
anyone else notice how they ripped the blood drip in the K from killing eve?
BLM was funded by whoever she said. Nobody believes it. But real blm protestors didnt do it violently
I really love that actress who’s playing the Karen why would she do that?!
so wait is tr he movie supposed to be a serious 'horror' flick or is it like "scary movie"? Its satire right?
Microaggressions aren't dumb, the whole point is that they connect to depraved attitudes and explicit violence.
I know its funny because the left really think there are racists everywhere. Its like bro racism is only towards asians and white people nowadays.
1:11 hey D’angelo fuck your face I hate you
C'mon BET, you gotta make better films.
Now I want a coke…
If i hear that piano key in a another trailer ima drop a Comedically large and expensive piano on someone
My specific beef with the story of this movie is that it uses the typical "this person in particular is a racist villain" narrative, instead of looking at the actual structural roots of racism. It perpetuates this idea that racists are these specific evil characters and that otherwise the system works fine, instead of the reality that racism is intertwined in the social and societal structures that we are all a part of.
the REAL horror movie is the meta narrative of the team that made the film
1:12 I love how you just slipped that in while flexing.
Hollywood is trying to rebrand the term Karen. It is just political propaganda designed to smear their enemies ordinary middle-class citizens.
Reddit The Movie
i followed a lot of the actors from orange is the new black and taryn manning was one of them.  i quit following her last fall i thought she was out.of.it.  (wink wink).  i hate when insanely popular shows with characters you really like end and all those amazing actors get typecasted or something.  or they go indie and i never hear from them again.  i will probably watch this in a 'the room' tommy wiseau kind of way.  i mean how can you not?  karen sounds drunk most of the time and cannot act.
HARD R 💀
“Same effect much cheaper” O_O 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
I will be right back to this video. I have to watch the trailer. Back. That trailer deserves an Oscar.
he's making music bet
XD
who md the potatoe salad was funny in my opinion.coke want to try and be like Jordan peele.but it just wont work
This movie looks so boring
It's owned by white people. BET Is WET
The karen is from orange is the new black
ooooooooooooooooooooooh yikes i didn't know the actress was even like that that makes this sooooooooooooooooooooo much worse woof
or god forbid go watch roots
ya if you wanna see a good movie about racism go watch get out dont watch karen smh
i love your snark lol this is completely unnessicary exploitatitve terrible trash
Lmao dude you’re funny
He's handsome yes.. who is he tho?
Thank you. 'Very suspecting...' Who wrote this script?
I feel like I’ve watched this before… it’s called “Them”, and THEY did it way better. 🤦🏻‍♀️
HOLUP WAS THAT A GODDAMN NOOSE AT THE END?
Bold to assume she’s not the HOA president
If the roles were reversed they wouldn’t have even made it past the writers room. But everyone knows how any MSM  outlet is, pander pander pander.
Tayrn Manning is a great actress, pretty insulting comments when you really have taken a look at her career so far. The movie was was written and directed by Coke Daniels who is a poc.  Seems perpetuating to say the least.
The ironic thing is that the director is black and BET is black-owned and operated sooo shouldn't they actually have known how to portray racism better?
You are GREATLY APPRECIATED... RESPECT!!! 👑❤️💯✊🏿✊🏻✊🏾
One of the best film critics that I've seen in a while... *Tips hat 💯🎯
Does this take place in an alternate reality where Tucky gets out of Prison instead of game ending herself
I just can't take this seriously.
I’ll be honest I would rather watch this (fictional) film. https://youtu.be/Hi9A7VsfbKU
I laughed so much during this video, the whole movie is so dramatic like the music, and the fact that they put the worst most basic insults (nonetheless are rude) instead of actually showing actual injustices and issues.
But why does the Karen kinda look like Amy Poehler
But why does the Karen kinda look like Amy Poehler
The actress for Karen is Taryn Manning the same actress as Pennsatucky in Orange is the New Black
How do you even lighten racism?
Look I’m a film student so we make low budget stuff and they still turn out better in terms of acting than this mess.... I haven’t watched the movie but based on the trailer
Really wishing they had just gone for it and named the cop-brother Karen also
ITS AN A LDKDKDKDKDKKDKD
Cringefest 2021
Tiresome and intended for dumb overly dramatic people
"Bad things happen to people that don't comply" I'm sorry, what? They can't be serious with this movie. It has to be a comedy in bad taste...Someone PLEASE tell me this is a bad joke.
I can NOT with this... and yet I have to see it because it's that BAD. Someone help the world.
she doesn't even have the Karen hair style
3:10 I was like “perfect pitch gang” but it was an A bye 😭😭😭😭
1:15 pls 💀
This is a white person's idea of a racist movie
Its a yes
I only have two words regarding the movie: gross and sick. As for the person playing Karen in the movie, I'm kinda shocked and a bit disgusted, but also in hysterics that she is/was a QAnon conspiracy nut! 🤪🤡👀😳🤣 In regards to the black actors, I kinda wonder what it must have been like for them to work with this lady. I'm like, genuinely curious! I haven't watched Get Out yet, but I've really wanted to since seeing the trailers. I might just watch it after this video! I really hope "Karen" is a flop. I wouldn't pay to watch such terrible acting, especially with it being about such a very sensitive and important topic as racism and police brutality. I'm also kinda wondering why the woman playing "Karen" accepted this role, with her being a QAnon believer and a Trump supporter. Is she a "starving artist" actress? 🤨
Ya think this is something you should see part 2 shniqua Now thats gonna be a good babymomma drama
BET has been fomenting racial division and perpetuating stereotypes since it’s inception.
"It's an A!" LOLLLOL!
This could be a minor character in a fine movie :p
I'll be your slave when you achieve world domination
And WHY IS IT every dog being walked by a Karen is the only one getting hurt and scared?! Like every video I've seen?? It is always the most cringe part
this movie was made my white people... i know it
Its….it kinda reminds me of the amazon prime show “THEM”
I can't believe I've gone this whole time, subscribed, and not once did I see a new video from you in my subscriptions until now because another youtuber mentioned your video and linked it (which I'm so grateful, I probably wouldn't have had a clue still). Notifications are now on, it's so good to see you again despite? Being subscribed??? Idk what's up with that.

I'm looking at a whole country of people who fail at satire. This movie looks awesome.
Lmaooo I was asked to assistant direct this
This movie feels like one huge joke trying to be serious lol. I also feel like the racism is light bc they're playing off of karen stereotypes and those usually portray karen as like not being bold enough to be straightforward racist.
i think this is quite possibly one of the worst movies i’ve seen so far
i really hate when people call literal racists and basic kkk members “karen’s” as a funny nickname. i can’t rlly explain why but i despise it
"It's an a" lol
I literally got an ad for Cotton why
Wait, the weird "suspecting" moment wasn't done as intentional irony to make Karen seem more hilariously insane? Did the writers actually think that was an appropriate word?
This movie feels like it was made by people who used to say "I don't see colour" until the BLM protests last year, at which point they made a heartfelt post about police brutality despite having a very superficial understanding of racism and thought that made them super woke. And now they're using their newfound wokeness to educate the masses and capitalize on what they see as a cool internet trend.
i remember a couple years back when pensatucky was revealed to star in this movie and everyone was like "omg she'll kill it as a karen!" fast forward to now and not only is this whole movie concept tone deaf, the quality looks terrible. bad choices all around.
"it's an A" god i love you
It gives me The People Under the Stairs vibes. Especially with Karen's brother becoming more prominent in the trailer. It won't be as good as that movie, but I'm still watching it.
That actress is actually phenomenal. She was on orange is the new black. She started as a character that I absolutely hated and ended with me sobbing over her death at the end of the series.
all right who made this person mad that they want to create a “Karen movie”
is that an f#?      ITS an A!!!!!!!!!!
If someone told me that this was a recently discovered 2014 movie created by Shane Dawson, I'd absolutely believe them.
why does the actress speak so quietly i didn't understand a word she said
This movie inspires in me the exact same feeling as woke white people that talk over people of color.
I’m not watching the trailer yet . I’ll watch more about this trailer looks wild tho!
Right after I said “Karen character” three times fast and he said “you’ve summoned her” I whipped my head around right in tune with the one-note and I felt so proud of myself
So this is what Pensatucky is up to today ?
I honestly thought this was a joke
The movie just looks gross and exactly like a cash grab, way too meem-y to be any social commentary
Racism is a spectrum; it can vary from subtle to overt...What this movie fails in is that the overt racism looks comically bad, and the subtle comes off as one liners. Don't get me wrong all of this still happens but the acting of it just does not work. I don't know if the failure was in the script, acting, or direction...but yikes.
"...it's an A 🤨" made me absolutely lose it! 😂😂😂
You had me at "GLOCKUMENTARY"
✨🖤🙌🏻
What do we have here.... Oooohh, a karen.
I cringed so hard I entered the quantum realm
“Suspecting???” 😂 #GrammarConfusion
the actor who plays “karen” is the same person who portrayed Michelle knight in the cleveland movie…never in a million years would i think to see her play a role like this
8:23        *starts playing rhinestone eyes*
I was thinking the same thing about the Jordan peele knock off. Is it bad I wanna watch it just to laugh at it? 😂😭
I've always hated Taryn Manning. I grew up seeing her in a bunch of random shit, and always gave me gross vibes. This movie could've been good with a deeper approach and a different name lol.
It’s the meth head girl from orange is the new black
This is like an SNL skit, but somehow even worse. All that's missing is a laugh track when they find the confederate flag soap dispenser.
Waiting for the day you have a positive video🤪
Nuance? Never heard of it
Oh yay, a movie based on my every day. Lovely. -_-
I guarantee she took this role in order to be able to say that she isn’t racist, that she believes in this project, etc. etc. Sidenote, I don’t know how I’ve missed you this whole time even on YouTube, but shout out to ready to glare for sending us over here!
Karen Carpenter!
I couldn't put my finger on why this movie bothered me but watering down the real issues to make the (white) viewer more comfortable... Yeah, it's a mockery. This shit happens all day every day in real life. It's exploiting people's real pain and suffering for the coin bc it's a 'hot button issue' right now 🥴 gross.
If we were to make a Karen movie I'd be more interest in seeing a woman who called the cops on a black man, he was killed, and went about her life as usual. But she is taunted by another person as revenge, opening doors she closed, tuning off lights she left on, slowly making her question her sanity. As these tricks get more intense, even of horror, she becomes more paranoid and seeing this happen, the mental turmoil, would be almost a have to see  thriller as she slowly becomes mad if done right. I'm not good at endings, but a plot twist would fit. That's how I would take it on, rather than a bunch of black people again suffering at the hands of entitled individuals. This trope is getting old and ridiculous 💀it's a no for me
Are we sure this movie isn't a parody lmao
Oh boy South Park is gonna have a field day with this.
That movie looks horrible
"They've somehow whitewashed racism itself" pretty perfectly sums it up. You take an entire culture of issues and cram it into one single bad guy character so now the average white lady can look at it and be like "well, she's so obviously evil, I'm not like that!" But inside it's more like "Therfore I don't need to continue paying attention to racism because I am now assured that racism is indeed a few bad apples like I always thought instead of a deeply rooted, systemic, deliberate and long term problem that affects all americans daily."
I don't believe in q but y'all are really sleeping on Soros.  The group he belongs to hates white people more than certain communities
Imagine a child saying this that in itself is uncomfortable
So very serious question, no sarcasm. Why are we hyping this up? Why are we giving this film a platform and making it so that everyone is gonna go watch it to see how bad it is? Bad publicity is still publicity. We see it all the time, "drama" and attention pays the bills, so isn't it better to just let it fade away into the abyss like all the movies produced by this dude before? Just curious. I feel like we shouldn't be giving it any attention. I doubt that it will be "cancelled" due to outrage on social media. It just fuels curiosity.
I honestly feel bad for all the actors, they got a flaming lunch sack full of dog crap for a script(and just, the entire movie...) If this were a Scary Movie-esque parody, ok, it could be a fun, if ridiculous, sleepover and popcorn flick. But...they're trying to be serious. It would do so much better as satire.
What a crock of shite.
I think a recent media that did a great job on this type of commentary is lovecraft country.
“I don’t remember the exact date when it was created” is probably my favourite D’Angelo quote now.
I actually think this might be a good movie to make white people understand what’s happening. I know it sounds stupid. But that’s all white people seem to do. This is a movie to piss off racists. And you know they will all watch. So they can say they don’t do that. And then they will start either laughing loudly or screaming because it’s true.
3:38 I did do it and almost   felt my heart drop
Why did I actually jump
WAYYYY too many ads!!!!!!!
Coming soon ........Wrath of Shaquita
you said “you’ve summoned her” and my fucking roommate walked past my window like a serial killer
Gangsta rap: the glockumetary is the masterpiece that brought us the nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga I'm 100% nigga
plot twist: d'angelo is the only person who ever figured out how to marry himself because he truly loves himself and even the government couldn't deny it
Isn't that the villain from the Bianca del Rio movie tho? Why would Bianca hire someone like that?!
Nope, it looks horrible
I feel like I'd watch this, but only for hate-watching purposes. Not actually because I like it.
The difference is that while "Get Out" was not on the nose, it was very obvious implicit racism, and the characters (Chris and Rose (even though she's lying)) are fully aware of it. In this movie, the racism isn't implicit, it's very explicit, and the characters don't seem to be aware of the fact. The film simply looks terrible and is very counter productive to any realistic racial struggle.
They got the haircut incorrect 🤦🏼‍♂️
F# is a black key 😝
the whole time I was just thinking what the fk pennsatucky?
Karen is Pennsatucky from OITNB LMAOOO
This Dhar Mann level acting 🤣
If anyone yells in a police officers face bad things happen.....  When stopped by a police officer I treat police officer like my life is in their hands even if they are disrespectful.  My 16 year old brother was beaten by a police officer for yelling in a police officers face literally but..... He was white.  When the hell did anyone think cops will do what they say.  They won't and it doesn't matter what race you are.  My brother sued but ultimately settled out of court for a sum he can't tell anyone and he's never allowed to talk about it as a condition of the money and settlement.
💖💯💖🙏🏽
The acting and delivery feels so awkward in this. I literally can't take any of this seriously when the actors look like they're fumbling through their lines trying to remember what to say. The dialogue feels so odd too. The way they word things feels like it's supposed to be satire.
Why are they capitalizing off of the pain of racism? I want to see happy empowered people of color on television! I want to see people of color having complex and beautiful and happy lives in movies made from the perspective of people of color!!! I want empowerment not a white washed shallow perspective of racism! We need to heal, not perpetuate pain.
When I saw the trailer I thought it was a comedy 🤭
It was “glockumentary” for me 🤣😆💀
Tarynn Manning has either taken her role as a stereotypical Karen quite literally or that the Karen role was meant for her and I've lost braincells but jokes aside.  I just hope she stops with this "I'M nOt a RaCisT " act when she's contradicting herself. I hope she understand the hardships black people go through and changes her racist views and when she said she's trying not to bring religion to the fake media, she just did!
the Karen trailer is up to 50K thumbs down :-)
"Fake hate news" is the dumbest thing I've read all day. Like, I'm sorry? That whole novel she wrote for her Instagram caption was essentially just spreading fake love. If you truly support love, and peace, and want the world to be a better place, you wouldn't be even the slightest bit okay with that orange man-child who complains on Twitter like a teenager, just based on the fact that other people are calling him on all the shit he has done, yet REFUSES to take accountability for. That piece of garbage deserves no respect, because he has shown no respect, not even to his own family. Just sayin'.
That transition into the ad was so smooth I genuinely got confused as to if we had started the video or if it was an ad when I started skipping a little forward
you expect me to believe pennsyltucky is the president of the HOA? I don't think so.
"suspecting" And then you saying that's not an adjective😂😂😂😂
A Karen movie should just be a horror film where the “Karen” is essentially treated like a slasher villain. But she’s just a straight up slasher and it makes fun of itself ....(think scream killer type slasher )) (Or just start recreating videos taken by actual karens... idk just not what it actually is, it’s awful))
Opinion & commentary on your vid (4 Free@!): the racism depicted in the Karen trailer is more realistic than you may assume to be a lack of subtlety. I think the director/writers/etc are creating a long-lasting effect so in the future if people don't automatically understand the slang term "Karen" then the characters will let them know that this is unequivocally about racism and Karen is racist. As someone else stated in another review, the term Karen is already going out-of-style. Racists also have to sometimes conceal ever-so-thinly their racist attitudes and what you consider to be lack of craft on the part of the creators of this movie actually depicts the "horror" of the reality. The reality is of a cop being related to a Karen and the insinuation is of state-sponsored murder and what is being ignored in these situations, which is called "Gang stalking" or other such covert terror operations. Instead of hinting they are being direct as that is how in real life the horror is spoken about and reacted to and dealt with. I don't want ridiculous Tarantino murders because racism in reality is about these more direct, albeit not-so-subtle encounters which lead to violence or murder. Horror is on a much more "banal" level (see "The banality of evil").As Tarantino is actually supporting the H-wood racist agenda I think you should focus more on the movies that have a more direct relationship to the realities of the actual situation, which is not subtle but has to play being hidden to some degree.
Haha "as a black people in america," idk why thats funny its just purposely funny grammar but it got me lol
I'm late, so I'm irrelavent,  B U T- It's always people who are not colored that try to change the world. I understand that you wanna show your race isn't horrible and you're not a horrible human being, and you don't wanna advocate for such horrible things. That has the word "you" in it more than needed. I know they just wanted to play on an overused trope, and did that thing most people do when they want justification for the pointless thing they do; "Let's add something that's a really big problem to our movie to spread awareness!" It's just one of those things where people are dumb without realizing... but they have money... and really good negotiation skills since they even got to make a trailer... and, okay, maybe they're being dumb on purpose to play on that "It's just a joke movie! Didn't even try."
Are we sure this isn't meant to be terrible? It's just so hard for me to believe it's not.
They got the Karen hair wrong too. But yeah damn they are legit doing like what you said D'Angelo.
I thought nothing else could be worse than the show “THEM” but this is a few steps away from it
look I'm not saying you and Kurtis Conner should collab to do a movie reaction video with this but... no actually that's exactly what I'm saying
I need this movie, I love a good lipstick lesbian film.
It's not just whitewashed racism, it's PG 13 racism, racism for the whole family.
This dude only complains about stuff. Stop recommending this guys negative rants, didn't even watch and can imagine it's him complaining again but about Karen's now.
This one of those bad horror movies I would just watch for shits and giggles. Like The Happening or the Leprechaun movies, especially the "In Da Hood" one. 😂 I love bad horror films. Birdemic, Troll 2, Rubber, Killer Clowns From Outer Space... 👀
it's trashy. But I like watching trashy films for a laugh.
I’m cringing so bad rn😬
If racism in a movie doesn't make you want to throw the TV out of the window out of anger then it's not written or/nor depicted well  "lol"
Cherry Pennsatucky, nooooooo!!!!  😱😱😱
Hate the cheesy music but I like the less over dramatic racism
Bruh
The karen meme is so good but so bad at the same time. It's a good concept, but once you hear a bunch of kids saying "ok karen" irl it's just cringey.
3:07 "It's an A"
See what crazy Is I live in the hood and I'm white and my friends get away with everything and I ride my dirt bike in my yard and get thared and they just keep on harassing me but my friends and they're black and dont get in trouble if I did I be lock up and my bike be gone but in the town over from me there cool ash and dont treat people ig it  depends on the cop but ya I never been lit of and all my friends are black i dont think i even have one white friend but ya maybe I did something and got away so now they hate me probably form shot guns and other dumb shit
1:10 Holy fuck, that was so fucking smooth, I am in tears (of joy)... Art.
I understand the race angle, but Karen's f*ck  with EVERYBODY.
shit i summoned karen
It’s weird cause Taryn Manning CAN act. She did great in OITNB. Idk what the hell happened
Omg you echo my thoughts. I think it's a fault of the script writers more than the acting though, and really just the directors vision entirely. How are you not meant to look forced and uncomfortable with dialogue as contrived as that
i think her bad acting in the "can you please hurry up?" scene was on purpose like how Karen's like to play the victim card on camera to make themselves look good if you pay closer attention to that scene it is probably the same scene as the one where she's surrounded by "suspecting" teenagers of course this is only the trailer so i wouldn't know.. but that's just what i'm getting from it
this movie feels like a parody also when is the Chad movie coming?
Nobody cares about this Karen movie. Literally the worst horror movie. Or whatever. This is really cringe and nobody should like this. Seriously I'm uncovered here and just came here but like, seriously the worst thing.
Wasn't that Karen actor in OITNB?
Why does this remind me of a nigahiga parody- ok wait like- “KAREN: the trailer”
when milleinals find out what karen means on urban dictionary and reddit and think that they should make a movie out of this
Hey really got me to say "Karen Character" 3 times and I lost it when he said "you've summoned her" 🤣🤣🤣
My people's trauma are not for your entertainment NOR education. There are better ways to initiate conversation and to educate yourself. For people who don't understand or who are already racist I feel that this gives them an opportunity to do even more damage by thinking it's okay to constantly laugh at our REAL and IGNORED trauma, and situations we have to go through simply because we live here. They know what their (movie industry) doing. Desensitization is very prominent in todays world.....but that's another topic. Guys please educate yourself, but if you don't want to simply don't speak on it. You just look like an ass to the people who are. And the fact that BET is involved with this movie .....*sigh* I'm honestly not surprised. BET fell off.
Somebody actually took time to come up with this garbage? Total cringeworthy
She was AMAZING on OITNB, what happened?
She played psycho southerner in OitNB... and she did it well... I didn't expect her to be a good "up tight" actress
3:20 She looks like the one lady from Over the Hedge.
Can we talk about the Karen's hair? it's like something that you'd get in a kids fancy dress set.  😳
I’m sorry, that shit was hilarious
Using "YouTube acting" as a diss feels ironic when i've just binged watched Caitlyn Reilly's WASP mom parodies which are, actually, genuinely, terrifying.  A real Karen is the scariest villain because she never stops smiling, never kicks over trash cans, never expresses outright that she "doesn't like black people", never preforms racism, but still plays a key role in upholding systemic racism and classism
Whys the whole movie in lowercase
Holy shit. I'm so sorry ❤ (about your family experiencing this shit)
seeing Pennsatucky from orange is the new black with normal teeth and short black hair makes me very uncomfortable.
my ex-best friend had a gay sister and she was girl , she still said "gay people are going to hell" and told me my family was weird because my mom was the breadwinner and also had black friends and still called them drity *insert n word* just because your friends with minorities doesn't mean your not a biget.:)
*this whole movie was mostly made by dhar mann but some other guy took the credit*  *everything is dhar mann-ey*
I appreciate the subtle racism in the movie/ trailer but that's probably the only thing I appreciate.
You are so darn brilliant. Yep, my first thought was this movie is kinda lazy.
Fun fact: D'Angelo forgot to add an endscreen for 5 days straight.
Dhar Mann would never😂🤣
This movie trailer is comically detached from  reality.
i said it lol
She went from Orange is the New Black to Karen on Crack
that sucks bc the lady playing karen is actually really good in orange is the new black :/
I honestly thought it was a Comedy Central skit
WHAT IS THIS😂😂😂😂😂😂😂isnt she in Orange in the new black please
At least Pennsatucky is getting gigs
Me: BET can’t make a worse movie than this BET: bet
The piano key is driving me crazy
Now if only "Karen" didn't start meaning "any woman who cares enough to speak up about anything, especially things I personally disapprove of". There are so many damn things wrong with this movie, even before the most prominent thing, which is of course the continued Hollywood financial exploitation of historical Black abuse and surreal displays of racism. "Enjoy" this movie about the newest stereotypical caricature despised by accelerationists.
This movie looks amazing 10/10, your just using your liberal knowledge to make the movie sound bad. GIVE IT A CHANCE!
Man, even the woke are cringing at this one. Lol.
The plot reminds me of the series on Netflix called Them without the paranormal part. This does seem like it’s an SNL skit until you realize it’s real. 😣
No one:   the people that made this movie: how do you do fellow kids
I feel like you missed the point repeatedly
oh my god but the trailer would be a GREAT snl skit
Why is this offensive? There have been many many women who have called the cops on ppl for just being a POC minding their business or doing their job....it's fucked
Who is your manager.
You gave me goose bumps with the single key piano, LMFAO
Facebook brought me to you 😍 yo voice nd the way you explain shit ...
...........................suspecting?
this trailer feels like dhar mann videos
That trailer begining: *chef kiss*
Ohm I'm just gonna Say that this is a Very very weird movie. Okey thats it
I  can't look past the fact that Taryn Manning looks a lot like Gretchen Whitmer (aka the Governor of Michigan) in this film and that just makes the cringe factor so much worse.
"she doesn't believe a word she's saying " just like real Karen's ! They will laugh whilst lying through their teeth. Think she did a great job playing a Karen as a Karen lol
Ahh yes if you question BLM you're automatically a racist never mind that there are black people who don't agree with their rhetoric I guess they must be racist too. You know there are legitimate criticisms of every movement and yeah the post you showed was a dumb take but I fail to see the racism in it. Also why would a white racist have black friends like I really like your videos I think you a great job with how well researched they are but I don't understand the mental gymnastics at play here.
Take the hat off bro...makes ur whole shit look wierd
I’m glad I watched this. Would’ve roasted brain cells if I watched the trailer without commentary.
Omg Doggett (from OITNB) released from prison married a rich white man and now become Karen...
So they just took the meth head from oitnb and made her act like a racist meth head with a big house. Ok then.
That’s Pennsyltucky from oitnb. Should’ve just had her be that character, would’ve been a lot more terrifying.
When u try to explain a joke to ur mom type beat
"you summoned her..."
The actress is the one from "Orange Is the new black". She always seems to be playing this kind of characters (cause I guess her face fits the role? Dunno) so I'm curious to know how she actually is in real life lol
The Karen actor is from Orange is The New Black.
noooo shot this movie actually happens right? id rather watch sharknado.
I am sure someone else already said so, but I am too lazy to read all 6k+ comments... Potatoe=VP Dan Quayle.
The trailer just made me realize how badly I want the confederate flag soap dispenser.
This feels more like a YouTube parody of a Karen movie lol
oh wait thats another lady they all look the same, i honestly cant tell
first time viewer you are a professional indeed! xox unfortunately i happen to love that lady playing karen she was crazy in luther an ive loved her ever since
It looks like it’s supposed to be a comedy? …But it’s not? She was laughing on the phone with the police? “Suspecting”?
💀💀💀💀💅purr
"It's an A." Such a simple sentence should not cause snorting laughter for a full minute, and yet.
11:20-12:20 creepy 4th wall breaking XO
11:20 twilight zone plays....
bro she really fell off after orange is the new black, huh ?
What happened to her black friends!? 😶
8:35 -- I wouldn't put too much stock in the timing of when that "living next door to a racist" line was said -- trailer editors will take clips in a weird order for effect and overlay audio from one moment on top of video of an entirely different scene. My biggest worry comes from my own experience working in film in that whenever a trailer is put together, it often displays some of the *best* moments from the film -- in the sense that a comedy film trailer might spoil the best jokes, or a thriller might show the scenes that best arouse tension, or a drama film trailer might show bits and pieces of the most powerful moments.  That implies that what you're seeing in the trailer...  is the *good* bits.  That doesn't bode well for the rest of the film.
the segway into your ad read was probably one of the best ive seen so far tbh.
i hate this it’s like a parody. it’s like layering dialogue about micro aggressions spoken by people who are just reading it for the first time and layering it over creepy cliche horror movie scenes with cliche horror movie music playing in the background. like *cue creepy A note repetition* “my neighbors… are black” *GASP* *jump scare*  *flash of blood* *SCREAM*  cmon dude lmao
At this point she isn’t portraying a character she is the character.
“this entire script seems like it was written by an AI who was fed nothing but captions from instagram posts of black squares posted by non black people” DEAD BYE AHAHHA
WAIT IS THAT PENNSYLTUCKY?
My Dad was playing miitopia and he created a character named “Karen” and that Mii kinda looks like the Karen in this trailer
had to take a breather at 5:26
For the frothing, leftoid morons who run this cuntry ;  Karen’ will be like ‘Citizen Kane.’
Dangelo is from south texas omg
OMG it's Pensatucky! From OITNB
Tarryn Manning is Peyton Manning's cousin
Pennsatucky!!!‽
Omg. I’m so glad you said it. I thought it was a parody video.
Yeah, the movie seems to be an expensive trolling of all of us!
Irony is the actress portraying Karen is a good actress but the script reads like straight TRASH!!!
... I was really into Taryn Manning's band when I was a teenager and this is so disappointing to learn
I literally can't find his new page
So it’s not a comedy?
Have these people not seen a karen?
it fits that Pennsatucky would leave prison to be a neighborhood Karen
I have actually seen a few such "Karens" in my lifetime. This is a made-for-tv movie, right? Not worth spending any cash in the theatres.
i love your hat
Oh no Pensatucky got out of jail and turned into Karen
the footage of actual karens are scarier
I subbed by accident. It was a very happy accident.
Me: Mom, can we have Them? Mom: No, we have Them at home. Them at home:
I don’t know but I really interpret this trailer as a parody. Like a comedy horror movie about Karens. Because they are kinda laughable but at the same time harmful. So yeah that’s how I read it
1:13 YOU CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT
But it’s a parody
This can’t possibly be a real movie in the works. Its gotta be a skit
On BET…I should’ve known…
Stay clam everyone! It’s just another rip off of Dhar Mann.
More like Karen Manning!
There are ways to make commentary on racist individuals without ignoring the system, but this movie employs none of them
Lol. Is this trailer longer than usual?
Move next to my family, friend 💛 south texas has at least one tolerant white household! 😅
NOT PENSUTUCKY 😭😭😭😭😭
👏🏾
Dawg you’re great at this
Smoothest ad transition in history
I . need . to . watch . this ... It's so ridiculous its funny.
My friend who sends me memes all the time sent me this trailer and i didn't realize it was a real movie until watching this video
Tbh the contradictions and bad grammar is kinda accurate for Karens.
THE „FAR FROM A RACIST“ POST PLS WHAT IS THIS
Another movie to instill a false sense of fear among Blacks to keep us dependent on white leftist progressives
The Teletubbies are scarier by a long shot. I really want to laugh, but I'm too depressed at this existing.
They had to make her seem completely out of reach of what you typically think of white women so you are not actually mad and can just laugh. The true power of Karen is the settle manipulation that she brings to her everyday interaction with POC
I never imagined someone would make a movie about this 😅
I am officially a fool😂😂😭😂
First thing, Taryn Manning can't act to save her life. There's still Pennsatucky Doggett from OITNB in her. Second of all, I agree! The racism here is too light! If you're going to make another scary movie about racism, I feel like it should be more realistic (N-word with the hard R, intense microaggressions, etc.), not "thEsE BlAcK PEoPLE. 🥴" Of course, I never had that lived experience, so my opinion's not the right opinion. And third, when will we ever see a movie starring a black actor/actress where it doesn't revolve around racism or pain nowadays???   These are some of the movies that get it right, imo:  1. Blazing Saddles 2. Get Out 3. Sorry To Bother You 4. Black Klansman 5. Uptight 6. Do The Right Thing
It is a joke.
White-washed?! Racism?!
This segment is hilarious. It’s a “Pick Me” making a movie making fun of a “Karen”
“Bad things happen to people that don’t comply.” Karen is a low-budget Borg.
The Karen actress looks so familiar. What's she from?
You sound ignorant d’Angelo because it’s not white washing racism because it subtle…racism is more commonly subtle, passing comments  and stereotypes than going out in white cloaks… :/ it is actually saying the opposite of racism isn’t that bad.. it’s sayin everyone has heard someone say one of these things and THATS the problem.
Such a shameee loved her as Pensatuckey & as Nola in Hustle & Flow
I want another ad. Hulu would love this. All they did is move in. My neighborhood wouldn’t even know someone moved in, let alone care. final question: Where can I watch it?
This is one of those films that are unnecessary and just in it for clout.... there is no effort put into this and is probably just gonna trigger people 😂
Wait, this guy made "Who Made the Potatoe Salad?" I swear, that thing felt like a fever dream I had back in 2007. I might be one of 3 people who even remembers that.
This isn’t great acting this is more of Lifetime acting
Wayans brothers did it best
The lady that’s playing Karen she’s actually from Orange is the New Black she played the really religious ex crack head I’m not sure what drug she use to use
Can people stop making movies because they watched 'Get Out' one time?
Er-mah-gerd! Please dish who that insanely attractive fella is who presented the advert? Lol
"she doesn't like Black people" *suprised pikachu face* "I'm Black..."  10/10, best scriptwriting of all time, give this an Oscar, a Tony, a Grammy, a blue ribbon, a gold star, brownie points, and 100% on rotten tomatoes.  LMFAO but for real what is this shit
TBH when they introduce "Karen," I truly thought Taryn Manning was in an SNL skit too. That makeup and wig make her look like a cartoon of a human being.
Someone said "wow, racism and black trauma is essentially a horror film" and a white person went "time to profit off this horror film, then!"
found myself unsubscribed but IK i been subscribed. jus warning
Seems like a cash grab
OH NO I HAVE SUMMONED HER AND AM A FOOL
this movie is so tired
She's literally played in Orange is the New Black as one of the important roles.... She was in a cast full of black people why would she say such a thing. How dare she associate blm as a terrorist group
I am kinda shook because I did not know that the movie was about Karen’s being racist.  Seriously I just thought it was about Karen’s asking for the manager and not being generally happy w anything as far as retail or their food
This movie is so bad even a blind man would tell you this movie is garbage
this looks like an snl skit
Soooo....BET is getting into the Lifetime movie game. Bold move, but ok...
i just realized (and googled to confirm) the karen actress is from Orange Is The New Black, it’s Pensatucky.
The actress who plays Karen is actually the same actress who played the racist from orange is the new black...   ..why is she so obsessed with racist characters? 🤔
After Jordan peele amazing revenge movie this is a embarrassing movie.
Tarantino is so overrated tho.
I didn't realize you felt like you are constantly abused by racism. Sounds weak
Before we go into this ion want no who make the potatoe salad slander
Imagine being the writer for this film 😂🗑
You are so right about the movie not really addressing racism and rather highlighting the prejudice of Karen.  Racist people sometimes DON'T hate black people.  Many racist people think they are superior to blk people. Many racist people have blk friends and actually probably like hanging out.  But they will always see their culture and their way of life as superior.  They will always be a little intimidated by blk people because they see them as more aggressive.  And this is the problem with movies I see about "modern" racism.  The movie seems to conflate racism with prejudice and not address the issue regarding superiority as much.  Also...I can believe the blk guy messed with Karen because a lot of blk men will mess with any type of wht woman just because she is wht. I've seen it.
LMAO KAREN IS PLAYED BY THE GIRL WHO DID PENSATUCKY FROM ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK IM IN TEARS
Movies like this forget not so apparent racism though. Like our entire system is racist. I think what a lot of white people don't realise is that it's not only violent/rude butt holes that cause racism. It's society as a hole, just things like looking "presentable and professional" is harder for black women because makeup is more expensive, natural hair types are considered messy and nonprofessional. Also the fact that it's harder to get a well paying job.  Like people don't realise that it's things like you could be twice as good but still not get the job because the person looking through the application just see a "black" sounding name. The person might not necessarily realise they are doing it and that's the problem. People think just cause they aren't actively going out and shouting abuse at people of colour that they aren't contributing to the problem. Like obviously that kinda stuff is still awful as well but I think people need to realise that's not the only thing.  Edit:This is just from my experience as a white person so feel free to educate me lol
Um excuse me, I need to speak to the manager because THIS MOVIE SUCKS
The Karen in the movie...is Dogget from OITNB...and now I'm pissed because I love her....
I’m not surprised it’s a BET film
This movie is going to be an instant cult classic.
Hear me out before you bash me please for saying this: born and raised in Eastern Europe I have come to realize that we have a very warped, unreliable image about what racism is like in the US. We get the news about both the police brutality against Black people and at the same time we are also exposed to a lot of media content with includes gangster culture with Black people being depicted as the key characters of those contents. During the 90s when the Soviet Union fell and Western content flooded our countries we got all content without filter. We got no context for, for example rap culture, corn row braiding styles, the racism in movies towards Black people. No context, no historical education like you do. Our parents and even us, we just slurped it up and thought it the norm in the US.  Only now as social media and its important spreads in our lives, now we learn a lot about all these things and what goes on in the background. But the damage has already been done: ever since right wing movements have begun to rise in Eastern Europe (Poland and Hungary, and quickly spreading in the uneducated layers of society with little to no access to the internet, AND with no knowledge of languages whatsoever), racism has risen to dangerous amounts. Just an example, my father believes Black people are over-exaggerating the problems they face, he cannot familiarize with them or take the issue seriously because he himself has been raised a racist and never faced racism towards himself in his entire life: also, he has no means to educate himself because he speaks no languages and thus he is only exposed to the Hungarian news outlets. I know to Americans movies like these look overly exaggerated and ridiculous because as D'Angelo says, it includes all things and mashes them in a blender but if you take this movie, in all its seriousness and show it to a person like my father, he might just get an idea what it is really like to be a Black person in the US. He is not exposed to this kind of content. He cannot imagine the extent racism has spread in all aspects of life, how it can strike fear in your heart when you see a police car or a white woman looking at you with utter hatred. He simply cannot fathom this - but movies like this might just show him how it is, how dangerous life can be, and you have no control over it whatsoever. The systematic racism that is embedded into American lifestyle in so many layers and areas of living, it is unimaginable to people who have lived their entire lives in white environments with white as the "ruling" class, they take it for granted and natural because they cannot fathom how it is to be on the receiving end of this. That is why, even though this movie might look comedic to you, it still has educational value in it. For those who cannot experience being on the receiving end of this nightmare, for those who think it's all an exaggeration and hysteria of a minority group. I know the trailer might look ridiculous to you, and it might not be a well edited one, even the movie might not be but I will still watch the movie and make my father watch it as well. He has to see this, and I want to discuss it with him and make him see that it is not hysteria and attention-seeking, it is a real issue that can ruin lives in America. And how does that affect him? The way he treats minorities in our country, the way he judges people based on their skin tone and perhaps, the way they speak? See, even if some might watch this movie as a "comedy" flick, at one point they will realize it stops being funny because it is a mash, a blend of everything which just keeps going on and on. We need movies like this. I hope I am making sense, English is not my first language, sorry for the mistakes!
I felt so stupid when you explained Get Out was a depiction of commentary on racism, I don’t know why (it’s been a while since I watched it) but I thought it was just a really cool Horror movie.  Officially on my todo list— I need to watch some different interpretations and then rewatch the movie
Like asking your parents: 'Can we watch Get Out?'  'We have Get Out at home'
Tou mean that you don't believe her in a scene where she's most likely lying? Yeah, I think that the point is that Karen i lying to the 911 operator. Overtly. I don't believe her either.
You know how you have Finding Nemo & then there's that awful copy movie Izzies Way Home. This is like the Get Out version of that.
Wait, is he serious that white people actually do this? I mean, I’m white & that just seems like nothing that any of us would do(being serious). At least where I live🤷🏼‍♂️
"they have somehow white washed racism" -dangelo 2021
Karen is Kindergarten racism.
That's some good Karen casting lol
Why did I say I'm officially a fool after trying it before he said it?
The only horror movie villain that would like to speak to the manager about her coffee not having enough cream in it
The idea of a black family realizing that their neighbor is a racist and including scenes with this neighbor using her privilege to call the police on innocent kids is actually interesting but…this was not the way to do it
Oh no I am a fool!
If this was more of a comedy. Like over the top ridiculous comedy. It might work. Only if they had good writing for it.
It’s an A
But...why do I wanna see the movie now though?
That ad read transition actually got me damn
That shit looks good to me!
😝 back in the day we would say this movie is going straight to DVD … yes I’m old.
its a guy
That movie looks like the place underneath the sunken place.
Basically they've taken people's actual lived experiences and turned them into a farce by putting the horror music over the top.
I think the movie is useful in a way, if this is what some people think racism is then it explains why they would ridicule the protests, the criticism could show better what real racism actually is like.
they should just put together all the scenes of catherine zeta jones in rock of ages
Who has seen the show 'Them'? I think it's on Hulu. Or maybe HBO? Next level Karen shiz. Accurate. Terrifying and Traumatizing.
Pennsatucky could have been so much more
I liked it, the you implied anyone supporting the Trump are racist...your video is a contradiction
She looks like Veronica in Riverdale but with an old mask on
Texas does not pass the vibe check
Imagine being named Coke
I feel like a couple of film students could do a better job of this
I want to watch this movie so bad! it looks so stupid haha I will not be paying for my viewing tho
🙄🙄🙄🙄
it sounds like it.s a parody movie
Id like to know where you live that allows you to just "turn on a camera and walk around outside" to show racism... with that mindset I'm surprised you don't like this movie
You gonna talk about creep show art?
well at least they hired the right actor
This is the movie ya'll woke left asked for.
A movie where the neighbors were closet white supremacists could be well done.  This is not that.
Isn't that that girl from orange is the new black
this movie is fucking disgusting and it depicts racism in a fucking dumb way
Caitlyn Reily could've done a better Karen to be honest..
wait for school i read a book called gangsta rap please tell me they didn’t make it a movie
I thought this was a joke trailer.
how did taryn manning get to be karen™️ wasn't she in like... good stuff
I mean.. I’m all for your world domination
Oh wow! i just... that post of Manning's was something else. I'm still not even 100% sure what she was tryin to say. She sure does love her some Jesus, I guess... Is she pro-Qanon or anti? I can't even tell what i'm reading here.  I always remember her from Britney Spear's road trip movie - Seems like they put the wrong girl in the looney bin.
She looks like my teacher that everyone secretly hates lmao.
I wonder if D’Angelo will talk about Creepshow Art..
Ah fuck I just summoned Karen.
This movie is a joke.  The main quality in a Karen is they are a narcissist.
It should of been Kathy bates.
I don’t know I can see why this film is kind of a good, it’s nice to point out lighter forms of racism too. I experience this shit all the time still and I live in the Bay Area; but I also work in a white upper class area. They think that because their racism is not blatant , that it’s not bad and they are still woke
“ it’s an A” 😭😭😭
Dude, the suspecting comment... that was the point. That somehow always happens in irl karen videos. They always make some stupid grammatical mistake. Also, Karens don't swear cos they're too precious.
Dude wtf haha the end of this video exploded my head
i thought it was a comedy?? what the fuvk
I refuse to believe that this is an actual movie that is coming out
this is gonna be horrible....but once I find it for free I have to see this shit
A great example of psy-ops.
dude darh man could come up with a better racist karen character than this
"LARPing on a budget" LMMMAAAAAOOOOO
Slick with the sponsor plug lol
the most subtle thing in that whole trailer was the last part of "bad things happen to people who don't comply." in a good movie it would have been the least subtle thing.
The “it’s an A” made me WHEEZE
this is exactly why some people treat "racist" like a slur. they use it like something you cant change or is part of you instead of something you choose.
did she really just "I have a black friend" wtf.....
This is dhar Mann on a budget
3:10 I was not ready to by sniped by that A but you know what, I ain't even mad
I think... I don't know if they are joking about racism, about Karens or about Horror movies... I just know that this is not going downhill, because my expectations are in the underground. So... Yeah... Karen... :')
Literally who needed this
Karen Drexler looks like a vampire.
This movie looks disturbing. Like I can't see any good coming from this tone deaf movie.
omg, why was I like who is this other handsome person gonna do D'Angelo's ad read. Hahaha....It was him.
The black guy slept with Karen, of course 🤣
Still wanna see it 😂😂
the vid above this is titled um yea lol
this ‘movie’ is so weird and im having a really hard time figuring out if this is actually legit or not. i mean i swear i’ve heard these ‘karen quotes’ in every other karen vid
absolutely off topic but my foot is asleep and its driving me nuts ahha have a nice day lol :)
oh god doggett became a karen when she escaped prison
I saw the preview of it while I was watching another movie. I would say it's a very cringe-worthy
They should make a sequel called “Karen II: The Revenge of LaQuishaniqua”
Pensatucky???
The only thing I do not like about you is that you don’t upload movies more ❤️😂  Keep being you
i missed you!!!!
That's Tia Mowry's husband
that acting reminds me of the cheesy acting of the early 90s mtv show THE STATE
it almost looks like she a method actor, so into her character of being a racist it permeates her real life lol
This film just looks so bad. Lol. Feel bad for the actors that felt like they had to take the role to make their big break xD
If Jordan Peele would of done this, it would be good.
is this a dar mann vid
the trailer looks like something a 12 year old made on imovie for black history month
It's important to highlight our struggles, but better to focus on what we want to see in the future
Idk who this is for. People who are effected by actual Karens sure as heck don't want to see more of it. And people who think it's entertaining are questionable. The only way to watcgthis film is if your gonna laugh at the actual acting and filming lol
subbed to the secret channel at 144K
This needs to go away.    I now officially hate my name, Karen.
Not “I saw it created” hahaha!
This trailer  is the funniest thing I've ever seen omfg
I'm sorry, but I am really having a hard time understanding that everyone's main concern about this movie is that the racist depictions are not "up to par" or "racist enough"? You're kidding. How about we address the real controversy about why this movie is allowed to exist in the first place. We should talk about the real reason why it's ridiculous. It's not like the entire Caucasian race as a whole has been under seige for existing recently at all. The creators of this movie think this is exactly what americans need after not being able to do anything but sit at home watching buildings and businesses burn and people getting murdered on air while news reporters tell us this is what peaceful protests look like for months on end. It's not like every white person has been told they need to shut up because of the color of their skin for the past three years. Isn't that ironic? Not only is it ironic. It's also the most hypocritical thing I've ever heard coming from the left and most all media, who are diehard anti-racists. This is so crazy, the raw blindess and subsequent crudeness of so many good people. I have lost most of my hope for my favorite country in the world, and I can't do anything about this but be scared for the future.
The internet: This movie about racism is so soft it makes racism look like a minor thing.  *the movie turns into some heavy racist script with violent scenes*  The internet: I can’t believe they are talking about racism while promoting it, they should be more subtle about this.  *the movie is cancelled*  The internet: I can’t believe no one is bringing awareness to this topic smh.  *Cuties director cries in french*
It’s the confederate flag themed soap dispenser for me🤣 LMFAO
it sounds like the entire basis of this film is Taryn Manning adding to her plethora of racist roles
I literally said “a fool” at the very same moment that you said it I literally knew exactly what I was in that moment
"there she is, slaving away in the kitchen" mammy two-shoes would like a word with you! seriously who tf wrote this screenplay
Not you making me excited for this monstrosity to come out 😌
wasnt "karen" on oitnb?
It seems like a movie that's spoofing the idea of a "Karen"
Didn’t that actress play the crackhead lady in Orange is the New Black?
the thing is, i thought she was just a great actress when watching her in ointb. seeing her play another karen/racist character.............maybe she’s just racist. like method acting is good but method acting RACISM..........idk sounds fishy to me
so, who did make the potato(e) salad?!?
I'm officially a fool
Now it’s @ 144k💋💨
The directors name is coke…….that says a lot!
This race war is going way too far
LOL your voice tho!!! - And this movie is pure trash.
1. Karen's started with the POC community as a term for racists, so please white people, stop trying to evict us from a term we created because you think it's silly to call something serious what we chose. Look the origin up before you decide who can have it.  2. Yes, racism is real and still exist and no, cops are not helping.  3. How the heck is this video of ALL his videos is this the one full of racists and pro-karens?? Like where did you people even come from? Do you actually choose to watch his videos, or do you people just search 'Karen' while holding their pitchforks?? I'm genuinely so curious as to why pro-karens and racists arrived like demon spawns.
I thought she was Amy Poehler at first....
The movie feels like the director watched a few Karen clips and thought making a movie was a good idea
So basically a longer version of a dhar mann video
Blacks gonna love this film.
What an unnecessary film and CASH grab.
Movie about Karen The internet: WE WANT TO COMPLAIN TO THE MANAGERRRRRRRR  I love the poetic irony
Please make a video on how you got ur locs on like a third channel
The Karen actress was good in some previous films but damn the acting in that seems awful.
This Is horrible idk how this shit got a budget
The Confederate flag soap dispenser 🤣
I hope this movie bombs but it looks so bad I have to see it lol.
Real racists are like what he said; more subtle. Sure there are some loud racists but most of them like to act nice y'know? Their racism shows little by little
You are a black people? What?
Not the AI that read nothing but captions on black squares 😭😭
"as a black people in America" really got me
Why does it look like an snl sketch.
IS THAT PENSATUCKEY FROM ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK?
Paused the video to answer your “what do you think about this?” question and... my dear God, this is horrible. It misses the mark completely of portraying microaggressions and just comes out with things, as you said, we *all know are bad*. I think one of the biggest problems is that it’s just centered on one person. We can all look at “Karen” and be like, “wow, she’s bad, she’s an awful person", but I feel like a movie depicting a Karen should really give some attention to how this is a societal construct that we all more or less accept, and how it’s all of our responsibilities to do the work to break free of that and make an environment that’s safer for all marginalized communities -- and in this case, specifically Black people. Maybe I’m reading too far into it?? But by making her a Very Obviously, Overly Racist Woman they’re totally fumbling the metaphorical ball. Most Karens that I have the misfortunate of having known don’t think they’re racist, but show they are in their actions and words because of a society that allows them to be with little to no consequences. I’m probably just misunderstanding what they’re going for, or even misunderstanding Karens in general myself. I just feel this is really tone deaf and does far more harm than it does good.  I also agree with the acting being bad, because... God on high, are they for real with that? The Karen actress... 😭
8:32 I’m sorry for exposing ur voice crack but I’m dying
People actively avoid Karen's, no one trying to watch a Karen motion picture. This is what you get from a network called "Black Entertainment" that's owned by white people.
They would have to pay me to watch that bull.... 🤦🏾‍♀️
This trailer looks like a parody. Like a niga higa parody about if controversies were horror movies.
I think that this movies going to be really fun to watch too laugh at how bad it is so at least that might be dope
wow. i have no words.
it’s already terrible that they are doing a Karen movie but they ruined it when they didn’t show the bob haircut
You know Texas has its issues when the “nice” side of the state is closest to Oklahoma
The fact that they have to explain the whole joke like "we have a white woman neighbor... named karen?!?! 😲" legendary
"It's an A" ....aaaaand i'm dead. 🤣💀
This movie looks like absolute dogshit. It's like someone's personal racist fanfic. I'm sure there are fucked up people like the antagonist of this film, but making movies like this puts forth the notion that what you see in the film is somehow mainstream, or the norm. All films like this do, is stir up shit, and work people up. This kind of stupid, divisive bullshit needs to be condemned, totally, by everyone.
Yay! I'm officially a fool!
You look like saud from Jules and saud
Ok, I just have to say, calling your fim anything with potato salad is a bad omen. In Germany some youtubers made a film literally called potato salad in German (Kartoffelsalat) and hooly moly it was soo bad.
Every time the Karen popped up my thought was "Pennsatucky?"
So Angelo, how you like Biden being racist, destroying black lives because no police will help you anymore from your own community? :)
Stooop those neighbours would have killed Karen long time ago for being bitchy! Police also would not kill your for talking back D Angelo! They can tho punch you a bit because you should not talk against police! I have been stopped by police etc.. I somehow never reach for gun, talk shit to police and guess what? It helps!
I'm white so I know I have a certain amount of privilege only white people have (White supremacy we all know and hate it) And I know I shouldn't make comments but what the actual fuck is this movie? It depicts things in such a bad way... Like if they would have gone on the rout of a documentary that would have been so much better. Like starting out with black history, then going into the George Floyd death and how it changed the world around us (Of course this stuff was still happening and it should have been just as main stream as it is now way way way before his death) Then they could have gotten videos of protests and even court cases. They could have interviewed people and put that in and of course so so much more. Like they kinda had the right idea but the very very VERYYYY wrong execution..... Like literally wyf
Again dems try to make fake propaganda! LOL! Karen should be as the crazy white woman wearing mask being afraid of bat soup :D
All I can say is that I cannot wait to see Kennie JD doing a Bad Movies and a beat on this one-
THE FACT THAT THATS THE GIRL FROM ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK SJSBSJS
3:31 NO BC I TRIED IT AND GOT SCAREDBDNNS? WHAT IN THE BLOODY MARY IS THIS
Acting is larping on a budget... Facts.
"heated gaming moment level racism" took me out
why tf is dogget playing a karen-
This man dangelo is a clown
Steve McGarrett's sister 😭 Hawaii Five-0 is forever ruined lmao
The narrative of the movie is for entertainment purposes. Out of all the content consistently put out this is poking fun at the dumb shit that been going on - it’s a parody movie. This movie wasn’t made for the black community and I don’t think they made the movie based on what is right for that said community. If movie creators keep catering to whatever the fuck everyone just wants to see we lose the art in movies. You want to see something go make a movie it’s not about your vision or desires
Wait till you watch Spiral....the "Saw" spinoff
Everyone's lines are delivered like they are trying to remember what the line is....that is basically every movie in the last five years now.  I watched a string of trailers.
Lol, I said it 3xs....
Well the heck and freaking is probably only for the trailer for censorship purposes.
The serious problems being massively downplayed aside, this also just looks like a really bad film 😂 looks like it should be a parody but it's not self aware of how bad it is so it's just a bad film
There's also a movie made by Netflix which is very homophobic if you haven't seen the trailer of it yet even tho you probably did
At this point......B.E.T, Are we surprised? They stopped being what they titled themselves long ago.
I do agree it’s trying to be similar to get out but it doesn’t get anywhere close to it. Some reasons why get out worked is because it was directed by Jordan Peele who is a POC and a good storyteller and director. He was able to capture the racism better. He did an insane extreme side that was something ppl haven’t seen which made it shocking and scary. Where as with Karen ppl see Karen’s everywhere and hardly anyone takes them seriously so of course this movie wouldn’t be taken seriously
Yikes! Neighbors with confederate flag soap dispensers?! 😳 that’s just tacky.
YESS DEANGELO IS BACK BABY
Why is the girl from the Britney Spears movie playing the racist?
The movie seems like it would be more comedic when it’s supposed to be a horror movie. They didn’t do a great job at making it seem scary
The way you did the sponsor was absolutely hilarious and genius😭
It's all so cringy. High school theater is better quality, seriously  The acting is terrible
Ah yes, the movie about the one person HOA. A force of nature fr
I never be able to see Taryn Manning anything other than Pennsatucky from OITNB. 😅
Bet is pushing an agenda 😭 this is just sad “coke daniels” and all of his movies racists “black films” cmon
Oh wow, I thought I recognized her voice. Taryn also plays one of the prisoners in Orange is the New Black.
This movie is just a propaganda tool
Subd on my TV but not on my laptop. So impossible to comment. You made a statement or was it a slip-up at 0:56 saying “as a black people in America”. I’m so used to your content being on point, now I am confused.  Devil, please remove yourself from D’angelos’ body now 😆  I’m sorry to hear that your family have been targeted each time you move into a new house. I’ve been asked by my family to move to the USA. To be honest I wouldn’t be able to handle the discrimination coming from a background where I have worked for there to be equality within the indigenous  people of Australia and the settlers that arrived and have ruined their lives. The fight seems to never end. Will there be a day, when we are just seen as human beings with all or flaws and beauties? From the deeper part of my soul, I can only hope so.  Not worth watching. America X does a better job of showing what racism is and all it’s ugly sides.
Probably the reason her Karen acting is not as good as her Karen personality, that she has shown in real life, is because she knows she is filmed and so she can't act naturally as a Karen.
When D'angelo said "insanely attractive young man" I thought he was droppin some hintz but nope...lol
I wouldn’t waste my money.
The movie is just... no. Just no.
omg the karen was in oitnb
You hit the narrative on the head... the movie  is trying to whitewash racism create a counter narrative that it's not as bad as people say it is... and yes the movie is lazy
The actress who plays Karen was in Orange is the new Black, and she was so good there, how did she end up in this "film" 😭😭😭  EDIT: just finished the video, I had no idea of her fu**ed ideas.
The Karen is dogget in orange is the new black
Part of the first 150k followers didn’t make it in time 😭🤣
the new cash cow is getting black people mad with depictions of racism, 🙌🏾👏👏...🥱
I cry alone in my bed at night, not being able to sleep because of the "karen incident" my friend tell me it ok of was a joke, but i see them, SOMETHING in my closet that tells me our god D'Angelo was right...🙍🏼‍♀️💀     But honestly someone gotta draw D'Angelos true form as god before i do it myself💅🏾
PLSSSS I THOUGHT IT WAS A MOCK HORROR MOVIE LIKE SCARY MOVIE
Why is she acting in this? She was amazing in "Orange is the new black" but this doesn't fit her.. I don't even wanna see the movie 😂😂
The I’m friends with black people so I’m not racist argument is ridiculous.
Well he was right about insanely handsome
Ok ... This is somehow even worse than I thought it would be. Omg the stuff about the actress 😱😭😂
Glad you have a brain.
I like how the actor playing “Karen” was a crazy Christian in orange is the new black
Why tf... would they ever make this
They should have used the music from “Jaws”.  Judith
Omg, this made me remember that by my school there is a building called "Karen temple" and it involves something about attorneys.
I seriously thought this was an SNL movie trailer parody.  Actually, it would make a really funny one  It’s just uh Weird and racist   Had it been a parody, it would be funny But the fact that people want this to be deep? Hahaha Uh, no Not so much
Pennsatucky ... oof 🤮
Taryn was Actually Right about Donald Trump and Q-Anon.
Who Made the Potato Salad was actually kinda funny. My family binges on b-movies all the time so that was a popular one, but this actor clearly thought he was serving us Jordon Peele and he's definitely not 😭🤦🏽‍♀️
this whole movie looks like the ppl over at dhar mann productions made it
The series 'THEM' shows a pretty good depiction of racism that black people had to experience in 1950s and the racism that still happens . So I reccomend the watch
eww cringe
Of course Karen is a Karen
having this trailer come out the same year as Them on Amazon is a joke in itself.
“As a black people” 🤨 bleeped there
Yo...it does look like an SNL skit for real
Please review „White Man‘s Burden“ with John Travolta/Harry Belafonte.
Okay but actually look into that Soros thing
What the message what’s the point? 🤨
Yay us rtzf yog  our up
omg it seems like a keenan and peel skit for a fake movie
*Karen* is basically a knock off *Get Out* part 2: electric boogaloo. And considering there is a white supremacist group called the boogaloo boys, says a lot, too. I'm not entirely sure what, though.
orange is the new black really sent her down a bad path
you are absolutely right in saying that people will point to this and say, "sEE? rAcIsM iS nO mOrE!" when irl people aren't upfront about their racism anymore.
WHY IS DOGGETT ALWAYS RACIST? 😭
This movie has to be a joke masquerading as a serious commentary for all of our sakes.
you should se her in OITNB,things that happen to her is sad but she does shows a bit of racism in it.atleast I think idk I forgot
Man I feel bad for people named Karen now their name will forever have a negative connotation attached to it:/
Wait until the actual "Karens" see this film representing them 👀
To be fair, her grammatical screwup with the word 'suspicion' does kinda make sense b/c lots of Karens start talking to quickly and fumbling words when they're being recorded and/or are on the phone trying to convey how "scared" they are to the 911 operator.
so. them but bad
producers of this move really thought they did something
is that mfing Pennsatucky....
I had been procrastinating sleep all night till I heard birds chirping, was scrolling youtube till I saw this. I sighed so heavily and closed my eyes for so long in muted agony that I fell asleep. we found something the movie is good for, amen
I thought you were a girl in the thumbnail
I said karen character in my mind and physically cringed so bad 🙁
Not gonna lie he mentioned an attractive young man and I wasn't disappointed <3
Jesus they are treating karens like theyre some dangerous mystical creature. This also feels like it was made by someone who wants to prove they arent racist but are afraid to add real racist stuff
isnt the actress for karen the hillbilly methead from orange is the new black.... ironic
To be fair, most Karen videos seem like acting because it’s harder to believe that bullshit people like that are actually real.
My best friend is from the hillbilly part of indiana and her father is so unbelievably racist. Good thing she not only hates him for being racist, but being a piece of shit towards her.
that video of the woman with her dog- she shouldnt have a dog-
about the whole tyler perry clone era of black television. It's never good. The gay scenes are so weird, like some sort of jump scene, and that's spoken as a fujoshi, and the portrayal of white people is just terrible. CAN THEY GET SOMEONE WHO CAN DO HAIR ON A WHITE PERSON? Every white woman on BET dramas come out looking like they have some sort of helmet. They shouldn't just be slapping wigs on litrally every woman on the show.
I swear this movie was made by a white “alt” girl on Tik tok who saw the trial or no not the movie and somehow created the movie
My opinion: Helping no one, trivializing real issues, Karen's acting is not working, feels like it is trying to profit off of actual issues, not even working as a piece of art or entertainment, as a film it doesn't seem like it was really thought out
This movie would have hit way different if it was told from the perspective of retail workers
I just gotta let you know, Morning Brew is actually kinda baller. #NotSponsored #BrewGang
Wait... that's the OITNB actress! How did she get it so badly? It looks like a performance her OITNB character would do at the jail annual talent show.
I was gonna say Taryn Manning was too good to be in this but um.....glad I waited until watching the whole video
Taryn Manning's acting was definitely better in Orange is the New Black. Have no idea what's going on with her acting in this movie.
So down for the world domination. You deserve it lol.
Did these people watch a Jordan Peele movie clip and think they understood racism? Then decided to make a KAREN MOVIE?
Why does this feel like a Key & Peele sketch?
She was literally the same character in Orange is the Black lol
people really think they can replicate the magic that is get out. there is only one Jordan Peele, and the writers of this movie need to understand!
Maybe the worst tone deaf dumb movie since Cuties.
i was like damn, d’angelo being bi ??? before the sponsor mention
Was this made by Republicans as a farce?
Karen is racist hillbilly meth head from Orange is the New Black
Honestly it’s obvious the studio is trying to get the internet to turn this movie into a meme so people can buy tickets to see it. Pretty lazy
Is that Tiffany from oitnb 😭 it startled me seeing her face again
no thoughts, just #breadceumbs
it feels like a fake horror movie add that college humor or studio C would do. Not a irl Hollywood movie... like it has the exact same vibes as studio c's anti-running video (except they did it better) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NwHNHNXsg0
My question is who is this movie for🥴
if a black person made this movie it would be SO much better
What is the other channel with all Caps? He said it’s not YouTube ?
Is this really a bet movie ?
Went to go subscribe to d'angelo's new channel but I am already subscribed lol
I want to laugh but like they could have used this chance to actual used subtlety because thats true racism that systemic deep rooted racism thats the true problem. I almost feel like they are making a mocking of the karen term to say see look how ridiculous the idea is because that woman isnt a karen. Shes a psychotic, pathological liar who are just targeting black people so that the least worst thing she is shes racist!!! Its to cover up all that shes mentally completely devoid of being compus mentus. Is  completely deficit of all traces of human beingness. Its a mockery of racism... Im white and im pissed off because this shows nothing of true racism which is typically hidden or dog whistled because they arent mentally unstable like this character and they know its wrong or know it looks bad to others to be a racist so it comes out in very subtle ways but just enough to see the racism in the action. I hate this movie the idea and boy i hope they get roasted for this top jackassery ive ever seen in my life.
I can't believe it. Someone is making a movie that's worse than "The Emoji Movie". I'm offended. Why did we set the bar SO LOW?!
There’s a reason that woman plays legit E V E R Y racist woman in a movie. She’s not even acting at this point. They probably let her just write her own script.
Do we really need a Movie to tell us racism is still a problem in our America - or that people abuse their position of power - yes it’s BS and horrible but do we need a movie?  The movie should be called “department of the obvious “ also is there an attempt of solution ?
I think this is supposed to more *satire* than horror....I mean the acting is indeed horrendous, shit I don't know...maybe it is a horror movie....
If D'angelo wrote music it would be fire af 💯
so disappointed at Pennsatucky:(
That’s the chick from Orange is the new black!! I think she was better in that tho
"as a black people in america" 💀
Aw sad that actress was amazing in Orange is the New Black
the Karen actress looks and acts like emma stone
isn’t she from orange is the new black
Calling someone a karen is the same as calling a black person the N word. You're literally using the same part of your brain. Of course people are so brainwashed and anything anti-white isnt racist. Fuck BLM
Get Out was so good in a serious way. This is a comedy. Its a horror type comedy. I don't think we should take it so seriously. Racism is a serious topic, we know that but I don't see why we can't laugh about it too. I can't do 2 things at once. I am black BTW so that may be why I'm like not tripping as much.
I didn’t really consider it before but I bet bringing lgbtq+ or racial issues into a horror movies main plot could make for a pretty memorable and good horror movie. But not this… Seriously how does one ever come up with this? It’s just delivered in a way that seems cringe…
Her research for the role has been lifelong.
So Taryn is the rac¡$T character from orange is the new black. Hmmmm won't be watching it 😬
dogget whyyyyy ._.
Omg is D'Angelo dropping an album?!
10:26 my family just told me that Get Out had nothing to do with racism. They said the people In the movie weren’t racist at all and it had nothing to do with race. Where I live, everybody is racist but it’s so normalized that nobody knows they’re racist. I hate it here :)
Yikes!! Nobody  asked for this movie
Karen is actually a good actress so idk why she agreed to do this and why she’s so bad.
I feel like movies now are like going for shock value than actual acting talent or a good story
There already is a really good Karen youtube series about a psychotic suburban supermom. Its existed for years before this movie and is called Gayle xD
Holy I just found out I can zoom in on YouTube videos
this actor and her character in orange is the new black got on my nerves now i know why i didnt trust her ass
you remind me of my therapist
Taryn Manning says she went "full method acting" for her role on OITNB. That's a little sus.  She then says "I can’t continue to play awful people or stereotypes. It just doesn’t resonate with me … I’m a good person and not this horrible person that people want to send me roles for; I don’t want to play it anymore. It’s exhausting and it hurts.”
Why is Netflix making such crappy stuff recently 🤮
Pennsatucky's back from the dead and is now a Karen
I'm having deja vu to when trump was elected.  Its a joke... It'll be over soon... Oh no....
Why does the Karen character sound kinda drunk to me?
#freebritney
what the fuck is this trailer
When you said “sources according to a 12 sec google search” I had to like because me n everyone else n they gold fish relate
BET needs to be taken off the air, permanently.
Saw your h3 roast, I had no idea you could sing my dude! Good job, keep it up.
Im going to forget that I subscribed to your secret channel and then one day you‘ll upload on it and I will be so confused
Imagine gaslighting IRL black folks about their pain, only to turn around and make a cinematic travesty about it for profit.
Is it a BET original movie? Or like legit release in theatres type movie?  Because honestly, it actually looks on par for a TV network original movie. TV network movies don’t have nuance, or that good of directing, or that good of production, or that great of acting ect. I’ve definitely seen way worse TV network movies then the little bit that is shown in the trailer, especially from BET.  However if this is a actual theatrical movie…no
Damon is a "black" man who chose to call himself  Coke and that is all we know
How can someone go from Orange is the new Black to THIS....
The Karen Looks Like Michel Jackson
Looks like white activism designed to make them look 'woke'… but in a very shallow way. Personally, I hate the Term 'woke' cause its very white saviour and a big buzz-word for false morality. Much in the same way that you’re not cool if you say that you’re cool, saying you’re ‘woke’ screams of not actually being ‘woke’.  There is no satire here because the sarcasm has no depth and they treat the audience like they're really stupid. I’m not sure who this was written for but I don’t think they’ll like it.
I normally don't like to post my thoughts until the video is over but SINCE U ASKED: Is the director/writer trying to present this Black family as completely unaware of racism? Because why the fuuuuck would they still be okay with interacting with her racist ass? Trying to make horror movies about neighbors is so dumb when 90% of us don't hang out with our neighbors or go into their house.
I’d like to take this moment to say sorry to my relatively nice mom named Karen 😔✌🏽
i just wanna see you do a video on creepshowart
Not me getting a Hobby Lobby ad in the middle of you describing the actress😭😭
When he said “I live in Texas...south Texas.” I literally screamed “AHHH D’ANGELO, GET OUT OF THERE!” Stay safe handsome lad
When we said we wanted accurate representation in film, this isn't quite what we meant.
It was written by small hats !
Small hats !
Acting: LARP-ing on a budget
Search kalergi plan on bitchute
i can already hear my racist father screaming about how this movie is racist towards white people
America, please sit down, the rest of the world wants to have a talk with you. Guys, WTF?
I feel like D’Angelo and other people in the comments are missing the point/context of this movie. Considering the stated filmography of the director (also that Jaleel White—a comedian—was in both of those movies) and having seen the trailer for myself prior to this vid, everything seems to add up.  The movie seems a like a self-aware joke from the trailer. I get not everyone will think it’s funny, but it’s a joke.  That said, the way people are approaching this movie would be similar to dragging Zoolander for being “a poor execution of *serious* commentary on the fashion industry”…when that’s not what it’s trying to do🤣. I will say thanks to DW for letting people know this exists though! I’m considering watching it for the LOLZ Btdubs: This movie is more of a play on Lakeview Terrace than Get Out…but that may be a little too old for some.🙃
"this is like 'serving my wife divorce papers at 3 AM | prank | Free iPhone giveaway' acting" 🤣 the accuracy
The funny thing was that I predicted a movie in 2019 about Karen's and this is just😭 😂😂😂
I wanna see a movie where there is racist people called Katherine Kevin Karen with are a part of the ʞʞʞ and get slaughtered by ski mask
Is the Karen character Stevie from Schitt's Creek? Or that girl from OITNB? Pen-something?
Is that renny???
Bro I literally interacted with this video as if D’Angelo was Dora the explorer and then I get called a fool and accidentally summon a Karen. I am done with today.
the actress playing Karen was the pregnant girl in Britney Spears' movie Crossroads. just had to put that out there.
D'Angelo is king of everything but um no one is better then NotEvenEmily at transitions into ads
How are you going to do a Karen movie without the iconic Karen haircut???
Are you ever going to talk about #blacktiktokstrike?!
this "movie" is just what black people in America deal with on a daily basis, it's not entertaining, nor does it sit right with me (not a surprise if I'm being honest) That last line really made me frustrated for multiple reasons one of the main reasons is that it's not true; no matter how many times a person of color "complies" it'll almost always end up badly (i.e someone (most likely the person of color) getting hurt and a new report followed by a protest for the police to do better) "Karen" in the "movie"  is reminding me of that SpongeBob episode where the sardine called her police officer husband for a reason I can't remember but I'm pretty sure it needed with the sardine loving Krabby Patties.
the trailer’s message has a weird vibe of “haha imagine if this actually happened to black people 😁” i hate it
I said Karen 3 x 3 times in front of a mirror… it’s too late for me. She’s been summoned.
Is that the southerner from orange is the new black??
I deadass thought the trailer was a good satire on both Karens and horror movies I didn’t believe it was real 💀
I find this Karen thing rather misogynistic... YouTube is full of all these fake 'Karen Compilations', and there are whole channels dedicated to karens (they are run by men, no surprise), profiting off of depicting women as hysterical creatures. I am not from the US so probably it is hard for me to understand the issue but why? The karen thing was born among poc sharing their experience about confronting white women who were ridiculously ignorant and these were real stories and real women, but why people are making shit up now when it is trendy? Is it okay to insult women in the video if it's marked as 'karen video'? I just don't understand.:(
I can't wait to watch it and cry for how terrible it is.
Cheap Jordan Peele, that's what I thought
So watered down but oh well
It looks like its just, its gonna be really bad. But like. That its gonna be bad. But also absolutely hilarious, because like. Its not presenting any new information, its not being helpful in any way, and it looks like the kinda movie where shit just, happens
dude u just earned another subscriber
It's not your job to bring me joy, but here you are- doing it anyway.
This gives me the same vibes as the emoji movie. Corporations saw teenagers liking something and said “hey look! We’re cool! Emojis! LOL!!! Karens! LOL!!!”  What I’m trying to say is that no one will make Karen jokes after this movie
THIS MOVIE IS *GREAT* AT BEING A KNOCK-OFF LAKEVIEW TERRACE (2008)
Desperate housewives. Best Karen show out there
Nope! The antagonist isn't karen enough xD she needs a fake blonde pixie cut and should be wearing all pink and pastels. furthermore, she's WAY too chill to be a Karen. Where's the screeching and bitching at?

She had to use a pic from childhood to show she has had black friends 🤣
I was waiting for the mockery
I don’t like how you come at the lead actress like that. She’s been in loads of really good stuff past few years and is a very strong actress. I was on the fence about you before. You make making a choice very easy.
that's?? Pennsytucky from Orange Is The New Black?? the fuck happened to her, i remember her being a _way_ better actress  also, this trailer is not nearly as shocking as the movie people think it is :/ extremely unimpressive. they'd have to rewrite the whole movie if they wanted to fix it
i knoooooow this ain't "I DID IT FOR YOOOU" from hustle and flow playing a karen 😭😭😭😭😭
This feels more like an snl skit 😐 just got to the part where I ain’t alone on that feeling 😭 like what is this?!??!!?
Heated gaming moment 😂
Y'all realize the Karen is the same actress that was Doggett in Orange is the New Black, yall liked her in that but now shes LARPing? lol
To be fair, I used to spell potato with an “e,” but then again, I was 6.
She isn’t really Karen as much as she is a Methany
this would work better as a comedy movie thats self aware and not taking itself soooo seriously cause its already really cringw
As someone who absolutely loves crappy horror movies, like really shitty ones, I am looking forward to watching this.
Oh nooooo not Taryn Manning 😭 I'm so upset to learn this about her given that she was in one of my favorite shows where she actually gave a great performance, a show that actually commented on the mistreatment of black individuals as well as prison inmates. Oh how far she has fallen since Orange is the New Black ended...
A male Karen is a chad
Is dangelo starting a podcast???
you have the most beautiful voice everrrrr, i wil sign up every chanel. Big fun of you. I am 50 years old, a mother of 3 boys.
This is uncomfortable for the wrong reasons
Let's just say it like this... if you want to 'support' this movie, definitely 'DON'T' go pirate it, which is very convenient but of course not legal because they'd make no money! You should 'stream' it or 'go to the movies'. ☺ happy sailing
The twist ending is the white women turns out to be Jussie Smollett in disguise.
The Karen is from Orange is the new black. 😂😂. Oh no Taryn is soo wrong with what she posted. Only racists talk like that. I hope she learns but many people don’t
Only thing more cringe than the trailer was the review.
I actually like the Karen actress, I'd love this if it wasn't so on the nose and if she was more obsessive.
isn't she the girl from OITNB?
they probably hired a fiverr writer to write the story  for 1$
Not the confederate flag soap dispensers 😭😭😭
D angelos transitions are the only thing smoother than his skin.
This is knock off get out.
Isn't this Pennsatucky from orange is the new black?
wait deangelo ... i didnt know you could sing !!! i heard your singing clip on the h3 roast! it was so good!
I'm just so tired of the Karen thing. It's overdone. There's even a law in SF named after the meme now. Once lawmakers start cashing in on a meme, it's time for the meme to die.
"What is that, an F#? ... *Plays note* ... It's an A!" Pfft haha I loved that for some reason. Also it ain't good for anyone shouting at the cops man, testified by me who is racially ambiguous.
shes more like a white supremacist than karen tbh
Karen… boring!
I actually summoned her because i got deadnamed straight away for some reason
I was one of the first 20k subscribers on his new channel 🤪 I'm just super cool like that
Isn’t the Karen character from OITNB 😂
Literally no one : d’angelo naming his channels : D’angelo Wallace dangelowallace D’ANGELO WALLACE
Love your content, but also??? You’re perfect and beautiful??? Okay, bye-bye
is that the girl from orange is the new black😭
She was only good at acting in Orange is the New Black because her role called for her to be cringe.
I never liked Tarynn Manning I’m sorry, she kinda scares me.
Every race has its racist people..
i don’t even know how to react to that movie aside from ‘😀🔫’ this emoji combo
3:35 No D’angelo, in fact I didn’t even attempt it, your horrifying gaze backed me down and I was too afraid of you being disappointed with me.
If they’re gunna make a horror movie off Karen’s they should’ve done the more extreme things they’ve done instead of mild aggressions that make you laugh and go what the fuck
This movie is suffering a identity crisis, it’s too ridiculous to be taken as a serious psychological thriller and it takes itself way too serious tone a parody/satire.
I really don’t want to see this... but I really want to see this
First of all it’s a BET original movie. That was a big red flag by itself.
I feel like it could have been a better movie if it was more subtle . Pointing out subtle racism that people don't even register as racist, and it escalates to murder. Could have been a good discussion!
People on top want racism to grow..they use  news  social media and movies...like they have always done .... U need to be Smart and stop buying this bs
I’m going to go rewatch Get Out to cleanse my eyes of this nonsense
Ive totally belive this was and SNL sketck😂😂😂😂😂
If she wants to defend trump go the heck ahead. But she really pulled the black friend card BAHAHHA
was… was that supposed to be a horror movie…
Damon coke Daniels 🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻
King r u making music for 2022 project??? That piano has never been there before i guess (or am i late to the news?)
I think the movies gonna be awesome.
The concept: could be super cool The execution: catshit
This looks like a parody, I can't believe this is a "serious" movie LOL
"written by an a.i that was fed nothing but captions from instagram posts of black squares posted by non black people" TEA D'ANGELO, oh my god dad hahaha
they made this trailer on iMovie
Theres no way this film can go right
So ummm that was the trailer 😂
i want to speak to the manager, go back to asia or your own county let me call the police karens are annoying.
Wonderful, just what we need, a crappy movie to continue heightening the already strained relationships between the races. Good job Hollywood.
i cannot believe that this is the reality we live in.
Lol went to the “secret” channel to subscribe, and lo and behold, I’m already subbed!!!! So yay!
Soooo she was in Orange is the New Black, in which her character also was a racist, but more crackhead trailer trash. Soooo is she acting or was she just typecast?
Idk why but Taryn Manning isn’t the first thing I think of when I think of a Karen. Maybe that’s why the acting for this seems off.
I'd like to speak to the manager of the studio that made this dumpster fire.
Lol I thought this was a parody…
that ad read transition was so fuckin smooth oml
the trailers is showing me everything already
This movie was made awhile back but with the race roles reversed: Lakeview Terrace.
I'm glad D'Angelo has finally confirmed that he was in fact present at the creation of the world.
What a way to belittle a real social issue
There's a show on prime called Them..it gives Jordan peele or get out. Same energy kind of. But thats what this reminds me of. Its like Them, only way stupider.
3:37 I am officially a fool, thanks 😂❤️
I live in central Texas and same happened to me and my mom. But wat is the point of racism im really asking a question I'm a bit younger
what’s funny abt this actress is even in Orange is the New Black she played a raging racist and homophobe
Isn't she usually a good at acting, I'm confused 😂
That “Karen” character is the same girl who plays the overly religious (in season 1) girl in Orange is the New Black.  She tries to kill Piper for being a sinner.  Does she just prefer this trope?
I would watch it. I'm all about shaming Karens even in movie form. And it would be nice to see Karens getting their comeuponce cos god knows they dont get enough in real life. I think this will be a camp guilty pleasure and maybe at least a few racist conservative trash will recognize themselves as the Karen or the Tucker.
the shirt is giving very much charlie sheen, 2 and 1/5 man
What is this movie going for?
Please tell me you're joking about south texas
If you want a good social commentary watch the hate u give it's pretty good and not this hot garbage
I feel so bad for all the innocent women named Karen
this is all about YOU!
i like your commentary you’re pretty entertaining
Omg Taryn Manning was also in Crossroads with Britney Spears and that made for TV Ariel Castro movie. I had no idea she was a real life Karen lol
I hated every bit of the trailer. Whoever is making this happen please make it stop
why does the karen look like veronica from riverdale
“As a black people in america” was one of your best lines. Great video per usual
i rlly hope this is a fucked up mock movie n not an actual serious movie,,,..,.
wait, is this the Karen villian origin story?
This movie is a bad idea. We're just going to make racial tension and fear higher.
i said karen character three times and a crow started cawing outside my window  horror movie vibe achieved
I just went to the trailer to dislike it
why do i want to watch it juts b e a c a u s e
How she gonna be like oh your trash can isn't pulled up maybe it was because it was full lol
bro u need 2 make a movie
I will watch it for Taryn Manning
The fact that they didn't cast Caitlin Reilly as the Karen is so offensive to me
yikess..
It's STILL hard to believe that's a real movies. 🤦
how do you play a major character on OITNB and end up that racist lmao
Hey lesbian looking boy, you're missing the point of the film. You're literally arguing with the movie (which was its intention)  yet clowning it.
You should be in the spinoff Self Hate
As a Black people in America?
That is unbelievable, this is a dystopia
I swear that transition into the ad read was so smooth I blushed
She doesn’t even have 🍍hair
As a Karen, I find this incredibly offensive. I am nothing like this and do not understand how my name got co-opted for angry white women.
It came across as a movie that belongs on Tubi 🤦🏾‍♀️
This cringy statement by her, I can’t. She definitely is a Karen as you stated. Honestly I’m disappointed but not surprised.
I thought this was an SNL sketch, not surprising considering the director - shittier than get out for sure. But both are still garbage.
This movie is for clowns and so is BLM
i'm sorry but the little girl looking straight in the camera saying "she doesn't like you" is sendingggg meeeee
Lmfaaoooooooo why did they pick her to play a Karen ... she’s from oitnb she’s an inmate not a Karen I can’t get down with this she doesn’t fit the role I will always see her as an inmate 🥲
THAT AD TRANSITION WAS CLEANNNNNN
🤧
When you played that piano note I 💀
So they did Pennsatucky dirty huh? Who would’ve thought
It’s like dhar Mann making a horror  flick
5:23 NAAUUURRR SLAVING AWAY IN THE KITCHEN KILLED ME
Ohhhh so that’s how she got the Karen role so easily, because she didn’t have to act, she just played herself & pretended she was acting, that’s probably why her “acting” seemed so bad because she was trying so hard to not seem like that’s how she normally acts.
if she’s actually a Karen why is she so bad at acting like one on screen 💀
they just made a live actuon movie about that rich lady in over the edge
"Mama, can I have this Get Out??" "We got a Get Out at home!" The Get Out at home: Karen
“you need to take your trash in right after it’s been picked up” LITERALLY MY NEIGHBOR i wish i was joking when i say he complained on us for that
I can’t tell if you are joking or serious but you realize they used the word ‘suspecting’ to depict the actual ignorance of self-righteous superiority complex Karen’s at large that we have witnessed in countless youtube vids
It’s the fact they named a movie based on something as serious as racism after a meme for me
lol
Of course DeAngelo would know music to determine which key that was
If she used the hard r in the movie people would’ve called her out in today’s society for not refusing to 🤡
Fuck…. You got me. This bih dead ass appeared in house when I summoned her😕
why does karen have a thigh gap? this queef of a story isnt even going into that realm of woc-hostility, but for the rest of us middle aged caucasoid women out here, can we at least have a representation which falls within reason? thank you, and you'll be hearing from my attorney.
The people contrasting this to Get Out make me think they believe the message of Get Out was "The white people are racist".
Its really easy to point out the mentally ill racists in here , they are the ones claiming white ppl are like this lololol
My aesthetic is D'Angelo's hair falling in his eyes and him just pretending it didn't happen, wish I had that confidence.
She’s not actually racist she’s just been method acting for 30 years
Holy shit the alt right is having a field day with this trailer, I hate it. Cause they think its democrat propoganda that's just 🤦
.
This is gonna be so bad its somewhat good
Wow, looks like trash.  😆
Omg it IS the woman from Orange is the new black. She kind of played a mentally unstable and super religious Karen there too. She’s playing herself. 🙊
So I guess she wasn't acting in orange is the new black... she's just like that
I thought it gave like scary movie comedy vibes, but it’s actually just supposed to be scary??
Its kind of like this was made by a white cis guy who’s also a “feminist”.  Also the fact that he’s happily using all this attention as something positive for his movie..?
This trailer is literally a shitty snl skit lol
"the first scene of the trailer focuses on this insanely attractive young man as he does an ad read for today's sponsor"  Okay but that's so funny and he's right.
Not her literally being named Karen too 🤦‍♀️ the creativity is guShinggggg........
12:19 I feel like they did a thing called “type casting,” which scares me
that trailer was so painful to watch I literally snorted multiple times bc it was so bad
the funny thing is taryn manning played a similar character in orange is the new black so clearly she found a niche that wasnt too far from her actual ideals
yikes sis
I’m glad this HORRIBLE movie trailer got SLAMMED by the public!
D'ANGELO WHY WOULD YOU MAKE ME SUMMON A KAREN 🤣
D’Angelo: First scene of this movie is where we look at an insanely attractive young man..... Me: I’m looking at him already  D’Angelo: ....me🙋🏾‍♂️ Me: oh okurll tea
This movie is what every ignorant racist Black person sterotypes every single White person to be... Like oh lawd people are really gonna hate black folks now. This movie is just pure ignorance
"Don't ask questions. Just subscribe." Sounds good to me.
I thought the Karen actor was Bill Hader in a wig when I saw the thumbnail oh no.
Taryn Manning got typecast and _still_ has such godawful acting here... quite the achievement
I couldn't take the trailer seriously because all I could think was "ain't that that bitch that played Pennstucky on Orange is the New Black? She playin' another racist again!"
i hate that i did it,, I TURNED AROUND TO SEE IF SHE WAS THERE
I love D’Angelos side commentary while watching the trailer 👩🏾‍🍳💋.
did u guys know.... karen is played by that kentucky chick from orange is the new black? heard her voice googled it n wow
what happened to your art channel? :O
Wouldn't most Karens' idols be similarly-outspoken, opinionated, and confrontational women like feminist Gloria Steinem and Hillary Clinton?
Hollywood is doomed 🙂
you had no right being that funny in this video
This trailer feels like an snl skit
That Lifetime movie looks lit.    (sarcasm)
Next they should make a horror movie about a BLM member being racist on white and Asian.
OMG I'm SOLD. I'm a sucker for unintentional comedy movies.
It’s not even bad, it’s so terrible that it’s just no
Of course Pennsyltucky from OITNB is the Karen! 😂
Makes sense why she plays it too well
If this turns into a FRANCHISE I "can't even".
D Angle Os
B movie vibes
Isn't this a movie trope I've seen before I swear there are similar movies to this. Almost with the same plot. There are so many blumhouse and Hulu movies like this since Jordan Peele's "Get Out" did so well. On another horror note: Candyman Candyman  Candyman 🍬
I’m laughing so hard because it’s so badddd holy crap 😂🤦🏻‍♀️
JP is a genius and Get Out and US are fantastic movies. This is horrible.
"I don't remember the exact day I saw it created" caught me off guard.💀 0:12
im here while there is 666 dislikes... oh no
They gave Karen a platform… I don’t like it
Well, I though the trailer was good. Good for a laugh, if anything. 😄
3:30 while you were i waiting i wasn't even saying i was wondering how someone could look that great while waiting smh 💕
The ending literally sounded like it came from iMovie
fellow kids
Is Karen the actress from Orange is the New Black?!?
You all are racist! You all are labeling all “Karen’s “ as white racist woman! That’s racist! When are people going to stop judging others for anything besides their character or behavior?  Not name or color! I’m a Karen and I’m nothing like that! How about me saying all blacks named D’Angelo are losers?
The angle of the suspecting teenager’s home-
In Georgia my neighbors have confederate flag license plates to spice things up
a good movie with ACTUAL commentary on racism is Get Out. though it's message is a lot more apparent now as it was released in 2017 before BLM became an incredibly popular movement, it calls out racism in america really well edit: lol right after I said that the part about Jordan Peele impressions came up
I KNEW IT WAS AN A!!  im so proud of myself :)))))
Me:  Busts out laughing at clickbait title to video, you: "I think we all need to laugh at something" 🥳😭
From my experience working at a winery; a lot of women are Karen's. They come in all colors, races, sizes, etc. The big lady claiming to be vegans and the fake food allergies were the worst. They usually blew it after a few glasses of wine. Just about drama and annoying attempts at control.
😰OMG KAREN SO SCARY HELP 😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥😥
I hate when they make racism so “palatable” for white people in films. Make us uncomfortable. Make people so uncomfortable that they look within and question their biases, both blatant and subconscious. Too many are complacent with their moral and social standing.
Karen looks like a pg13 version of a Dhar Man skit without the faux feel-good energy
I legit thought it was an SNL parody or something.
I love your humor! I won’t be watching this movie.
The writer and director should be taking notes  on the girl that plays Karen
isn’t karen from orange is the new black 😭 bestie what happened
The woman that plays Karen is such a good actress. She played on orange is the new black
I need to meet the person who actually GREENLIT someone’s year 10 media studies assignment
This feels like if hallmark tried to make get out.
What a stupid joke of a movie
Get an actual actress: ❌ Hire someone who takes method acting too literally: ✅
Yeah, I thought someone said is WAS a Jordan Peele movie, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt as I was watching and didn't pick up that it was a ripoff😅.  I told my friend that it was too on the nose, but Peele was creative enough to make it work...but I now that I know, seems like it's gonna be just as surface level as what was shown
Karen sounds like a sober person doing an impression of a woman who's had too much wine.
"I had two black friends when I was a child. TWO! How can I be racist?"
right idea, terrible execution
Also, when she knocks the trash can over, there's still garbage in it, so it seems the garbage hasn't been picked up yet. So Karen got upset for no reason 🤷🏾‍♀️
Black people are NOT being systematically attacked in America..The Black people who do get attacked are NOT getting attacked by White folk,and White folk ain’t getting attacked by Black people..
Omgsh, step aside Tommy Wazelle’s The Room!!
The mind-blowing and depressing thing is that there are so many people who think the real world is actually like this.   If you're black (OR white) and you think about and see racism 24/7 in everything, everywhere, in America 2021, or if you're black and think that white people  represent the greatest threat to your safety and wellbeing (and not other black people, or corrupt politicians), or the biggest obstacle to your success, you need a life and probably psychological help.  What is this? The world according to CRT ideologues? It's like Critical Race Theory the Movie. And there are people who are actually going to pay to see it.   Sorry, dude; not to diminish your personal experience (assuming you're actually being honest about it and not exaggerating), but it's in no way representative of the experience or perspective of all black Americans. Many times we see what we're taught to see, even if it isn't real or accurate.  You've got victim complex issues and probably some subconscious, unaddressed racist attitudes yourself (white people hatred), in my opinion.   (Wait---let me guess: You have white friends? Black people can't be racist?)  Sincerely, A black American
I was JUST about to comment how smooth that sponsor was until you SAID IT
So so sooooo happy you’re back to uploading! Sm love for you! Glad to see you doing better and feelin better!!!
Pensatucky turned into karen
Instead of the fruitcake she should have brought over unseasoned potato salad.
talk about decentering the conversation around race and privilege yet again to tell the story of a white person even in a villainous portrayal. karen, a person who abuses her racial position in society to inflict trauma on people of colour is given the space to tell her story. now, if we are to look at the salary compensation for this movie, who do think was paid higher? a white person is not only given the space to act and narrate a sh*t story but black trauma is used for capitalistic means that isn't even benefiting black people. can we for the love of black enrichment, please tell stories of black people that isn't monetizing off black trauma? i knew hollywood was  p a t h e t i c  but i still expected better smfh
Most of Taryn Manning’s roles have the same type of trashy vibe. She does play a fun psycho, but you can always tell what her character is going to be like no matter what role it is.
i wanna see you make a creep show art vid but i’m also conflicted bc she’s not worth your time
okay d'angelo i'm watching this whole ad read because of how clever that segue was
Today we learned: D'Angelo does not have perfect pitch
No Zelda drip😔😩😭😰😥
It's just something about the word "Karen" that makes this horror film instantly funny. The word has been boiled down so much by tiktok to the point where I can't take even the name seriously-
Who thought this movie was a good idea? Or even a viable idea?
yeah this was distressing to watch, despite the really weird acting (like you said, it seems like it was acted/cut for only a trailer)
Ladies and gentlemen I give you black supremacy film making. Crazy times.
This is basically "Them" on a budget LMAOO
it does give snl vibes tho
“There she is slaving away in the kitchen.” 💀💀💀
Holy shit, that’s Taryn Manning?! May I remind you Taryn Manning played in Crossroads next to Britney Spears and 8 mile with Eminem
*while crying* "can you please hurry up they're very violent" her face: 😐🤨🙂  also everything about the trailer feels like a school play
I am. a damn fool
I keep wanting to comment about the parts when I laugh, but it's the whole video. This made my day 😁
WHY did the Karen actress sing on to this project 😫 She was so good in OITNB; girl needs a new agent.
Man... the ad thing got me Also after trailer opinion: this is like capital B Bad what were they thinking, if they really wanted to show the issues with racist Karens they could have done much better, like wtf is this?!?!
he was right that ad-reading fellow is immaculately handsome
Hahaha, no one likes this movie, regardless of political view points- left, right, middle- no one likes it because it sucks so bad. So terribly written. Maybe we can all unite over how bad it is. 😂
I said Karen character in my head lmaoooo
Lmaoooooo your intro to you with an advert
A movie about stereotypes where the villain is a stereotype. Ironic.
i'm gonna be honest.. when i first saw it i thought it was a youtube skit
I think the concept was kinda cool but it doesn't seem like it's going to be executed well.
“As a black people in America” love him.
I’ve worked in customer service for 5 years Karens aren’t that threatening, that’s kind of why they can act the way they do because older white women are inherently preserved as nonthreatening.
The Karen shouldn’t look like that. She’s supposed to be blonde with a certain hair cut because she’s pure white. And with some rolls.
why they use her too lmfao not pentucky
Wow that was so immersive I felt like I was back watching Dora the explorer
The woman who plays Karen is "Dogget" from Orange is The New Black. She was actually a pretty good actor in the show, because she had me hating her guts (initially) 😂 This movie is just bad.
only a few seconds into the video, just got to say: amazing speaking voice… I think he could read the ingredients on a ketchup label and make it sound really good…. Back to the video…
now wtf is this?!
3:06 NO ITS AN A. I HAD TO CONFIRM THIS SO EVERYONE KNOWS THE ACTUAL NOTE. I HAVE A PROBLEM.  Edit: Wait shit he confirmed it immediately after I hit play again. I have a problem.
Tia Mowry’s husband is better than this 😭 so is Taryn!
The ultimate karen was in the get out movie
6:03 idk if this was intentional but I think her misusing the word "suspecting" in place of "suspicious" is actually a very Karen thing to do. Like, Karen's are the type of people who would look down on Black people for speaking AAVE instead of "proper English," despite having poor grammar herself!
It would be much more relevant and realistic, if it was black people trying to evict white people from their homes
Oh Taryn Manning… why? Lol
Sponsor transition so smooth I only realized it when it was over. Or D'Angelo's voice is just.
Taryn Manning was on a season of Worst Cooks in America, (obviously a celebrity edition, to raise money for charity) and she rage quit like, two episodes in because she couldn't handle being near a chicken foot.
If you decide to make a movie that takes upwards of a year to make based on current internet culture ur dumb
Cory hasn't been in a good movie since forever, omg.
Everyone with perfect pitch when he said 'is that an f sharp' 🤒🤒
I do enjoy the fantasy of me being a well learned, adventurous, productive adult
The only scary thing about this movie is that they let it get past production
Oh shit I didn’t realize the Karen actress was Pennsatucky from Orange is the New Black until I switched tabs and only heard her voice without the face. She looks a lot less meth-y in this which is cool
Sometimes I just.....
Yeah it was pretty smooth
The acting reminds me of snl acting..
d'angelo wallace supremacy
I think this would've been a lot better as a Alfred Hitchcock style thriller. You're right that Get Out managed to hit that very uncomfortable note. While this is ridiculous i guess it hilights the micro aggressions that a lot of esp upper class ppl and sometimes poc themselves hold sometimes. It could've been a pretty good satire but instead is hilarious lol. Also, PENSATUCKY!!! (The actress is from oitnb)
Woah, his world domination plan is unfolding.
The Karen was in Orange is the New Black. Let that sink in.
Get out was soooooo good
u tired man?
Is that the actress from orange is the new black??? It looks like she dressed up as Veronica from riverdale
alr but…. why tf r we watering down racism for ppls entertainment. thats my question
Are the terrible and REAL videos of it happening not enough?
You sent a shiver of fear down my spine after I said “Karen character” 5 times fast and was informed that I just summoned a Karen. 😰
Gangsta Rap is a masterpiece though. At least the music.
I feel like Coke is actually on coke.
I liked her in OITNB but oof, yikes
Karens are mad about a movie made after them?? Everyone is a Karen Nuff Said.
1:11  And me being the dumb fuck I am, I believed it.
the only reason i survived this video is bc of D'Angelo cutting in every five seconds
Catastrophic events happening worldwide Haggai chapter 2 verses 6-9 Luke chapter 21. We have entered the last days. " All who call on the name of the LORD will be saved " JESUS CHRIST is the LORD. " There is no other name under heaven by which mankind can be saved " " Call unto me and I will answer you and show you great and mighty things you know not of " Start calling. Only 2 choices given mankind here in the valley of decision. JESUS CHRIST pleasures forevermore or hell burning and tormented forever.
when I think of Karen I think of an annoying white woman causing trouble in a shop, not hardcore racism. I feel like this movie (and racism) is going to be weaponised by right-wingers as a way to mock the left and ridicule victims of racism
Can't see her as anything other than Pennsatucky right now
the actress who plays karen makes pensatucky really, really hateable but her acting here is terrrrrrriiiiiible
wait isn't the actress the girl from orange is the new black 😭😭
She legit looks like Uma Kompton i'm dying haha
And what's with Karen's makeup? Did they make this actor's skin pasty white?
This Karen doesn't even seem particularly scary, just annoying. Having lived in a neighborhood with someone like her, even though our family wasn't a target of her shit, we avoided her and she was actually fairly powerless. The only threat the character in the movie poses is from her cop brother, which yes is obviously significant in the real world, but a horror movie should ratchet up the tension to show the real power someone like that can have. If this character had more skill with her racist dog whistles and good connections with the HOA and other neighbors, as petty as it sounds, she could do a hell of a lot more damage. It would also highlight the way those rules have genuinely been used for discrimination for decades while maintaining plausible deniability that "it's not about race, those are just the rules!"
I'm having a mandela effect, i swear i saw this video before
The fact that the karen actress is actually a karen is something that's so expected but hilarious
Who else knows “Karen” from Orange Is The New Black🙋🏻‍♀️
She was so good in orange is the new black….. seems like the director wants her to act poorly
Isn’t that girl from Orange Is The New Black...💀
Noooo not Pennsatucky 😭
Lifetime would probably have made a good work out of this
Dang she couldn't even post a photo of her and a black person that was less than 10 years old? She wild
this looks... bad.
It feels like a Lifetime movie that was made in 2014
No Doggit from Orange is The New Black is in this, fucking why?
Taryn is an amazing actor in orange is the new black though.
i got excited for the insanely attractive young man and was not disappointed
Not the woman from oitnb I expected better lol
Omg....that's Taryn Manning....I did not even recognize her lol
#48 on the trending page!
I thought this trailer was a Taco Bell parody commercial. I lost a little piece of my soul upon realizing that it was for a real movie.
Wait, you said, “as a black people in America” wow! I don’t really see...” really!
I am actually a part of the first 80,000 and I am DAMN PROUD of that!!  I can't wait to see what you are going to be posting on that site!!!
Yeah that was super cringe 😂😅 the note about the lack of nuance and subtlety, hits the nail on the head
This movie will bomb, and the slight uptick in hate crimes against white women because of this movie wont be acknowledged by pretty much everyone.
Pretty weird how awkward her acting seemed- Taryn Manning has always been so good in everything I saw her in...OITNB is one of her best
“what is that, an f#? . . *.* it’s aN A-”
i got an add for a BET production i-
Karen's Character. Karen's Character
I'd say clearly a comedy, except that I saw D'Angelo's rundown of this director's oeuvre, and I think the only way this could succeed is if it was unintentionally funny...
"It's an A! 🎵" lmfao
lmao it is like the actress didn't even try and she is usually a good actress.
I totally agree with you about this film and it reminds me of those “thrillers” about men murdering women— just a way to sensationalize a real problem and relegate it to the realm of Hollywood fantasy. And as always, the real problem is so much worse, but films like this are designed to make humanitarians appear unreasonable about our concerns
Yooo isn’t she from orange is the new black
You don’t seem like the type of dude who grew up watching BET (maybe TRL?), no offense, I just don’t think you’re the demo
They should have done a neighborhood of Karens. That might be scary  And yeah,  subtlety is a wee bit more necessary
That’s a hard drop from Orange is the New Black
The ending credits said BET helped. Enough said.
They tried to be bold like get out but they do missed
I really hope this is just a realllly late april fools joke
I was expecting an assassin Karen mentality wise character in a movie by the cover but nah, well whatever, I can just make up a story now that I've been inspired :)
It's not racist to be a Karen , they just want to bully all they see as being below them . This film however is racist . Maybe this was fact early 1950 's . But now it's just more anti white propaganda .
This sounds like it’ll be funny to watch, though. Like, stupid, this could have been a comedy, not garbage horror.
Taryn is a great actor. I mean she was a "0"  in hustle in flow. She boinked a man for a microphone. This has to be a comedy. I will watch
This movie is directed by a black guy but it still feels like a gentrified version of racism.
oH when I saw this trailer I thought it was a joke
I feel bad for the people actually named Karen lol
I officially love your channel after this one. You are so funny.
A "karen" movie would've worked better as a light-hearted comedy. The racism and horror aspects weren't necessary, imo.
What’s the secret channel?
Im officially a fool 😂😏😒🙄
nah but the fact that Tommyinnit’s Karen impression was better than an actress who might quite possibly be an actual Karen 😭  ((just to make it clear, ik that the situations presented were completely different and incomparable [nutty pizza vs racism] but he got the energy right on point - something that they didn’t get in the movie “Karen”))
If I wanted to see some thinly veiled racism, interrupted by police brutality reports, I could literally just watch the news...
watch Them on Amazon Prime, same concept, but extremely good.
Why'd they rope Pennsatucky into this 😩
Great to see you D'Angelo - now sing for us, please!! Saw your cameo on H3 and i can't stop thinking about your singing voice since.
Oh no, i really like her in Orange in the new black!
"as a 'Black people in America' is the funniest thing I've heard all week" I adore this young king
They producers really thought they were making the next get out…it’s so sad to watch.
Cool. A movie with over the top prejudice, generalizations and stereotypes. When is the movie about loud black people who want reparations coming out?
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Heated gaming moment lmfao
I feel like a better group of people could have made Karen a real fantastic insightful/retrospective movie. Maybe this is a drawing board movie, like 1959 House on Haunted Hill, and the remake will be way better.
Jfc Cory Hardrict has looked the same for about 20 years. And Taryn Manning has sounded the same for most as long. Her voice doesn't ring as Karen for some reason. Edit: ok I'm watching the rest of the video jfc fuck meee lmao
Omg not Pennsatucky! 😂 yea I’ll pass on this 1
“MOM, I SUMMONED KAREN AGAIN!”
“As a black people in America”
pennsatucky has fallen so far ..
Its a pg version of Them
imagine being so out of touch with everyone you title a movie "Karen".
this movie was only made because black trauma is now profitable. we only "matter" if there is a dollar sign attached to us. like damn all i wanted was some black wizards,,,
He wants Tarantino style hard R game rage racism? LUL! No white actor would be able to do that and not be absolutely mobbed and socially lynched if they did that lol. These kind of movie signal the end of society. So fucked.
this movie already triggers me
That Karen looks like Pennsytucky from Organe is the new black. She also speaks like her.
And she also played a racist in Orange Is the New Black lol
Is the Karen not the white girl, with the cornrows, who killed herself in "Orange Is The New Black"? I can't be they only one who sees the similarities.
Bruv, is that Pennsituckey?
The writer for this movie has never watched a real karen meltdown.  You didn't promise too much. Everything about this movie looks like utter trash and I'm usually not one to judge until I have seen something but I'm convinced it will be utter trash. It's doing nothing for POC. In fact it does more harm than good as it makes it look like someone is only racist when they outright say it.  7:28 you sum it up so well OMG
lmfao "heated gaming moment level racism"
I'm so glad YouTube has brought this video to me😂😂
Life as we know it ended when screenwriters started writing dialogue like stan twitter
This vid was boring, idk if it was just the movie you're talking about or something in the personation of this video but I can't bring myself to finish this and it's my third attempt.
WHY WOULD PENNSATUCKY BE IN THIS? She can't be out of money already
Didn’t ask questions, just subscribed🤷🏻‍♀️
Karen talking the cops: hehehehe lol can you help me hehe  So unrealistic.
isn't that actress in Orange is the New Black?
IS THAT PENNSATUCKY?
LMAOOOOOOO God ILY
Damn they killed her off in OITNB and made her a racist in this movie
There’s a Karen movie? No wonder my faith in humanity has been lost
i love how you paused and then said “did you do it?” i feel like i’m watching dora the explorer and it’s a good feeling
oh yeah the racism parody
Y’all need to watch Them if you haven’t yet. That’s what I feel like this movie is trying to be.
Not gunna lie my oven dings in "a" lmao I just turned it off the same time you pressed the A key on your piano XD
LMAO IS THAT PENNSATUCKY
this movie feels like they missed the mark on contemporary social commentary and instead ended up right back at like revamped slavery movie?! it just has similar vibes 2 me, but what yall think?
“You are officially… a fool” so my mom has just been wrong up until now?
"you know how some people like kill and rape and humiliate black people for no reason and generally make their lives miserable?" ... "so let's make this woman make a slave joke to show what racism is REALLY about"
that was indeed the smoothest ad read transition
Idk if I’m glitching but I can’t find the new channel anywhere on here…did it disappear or am I blind?? I’ve been looking for it for like 20 minutes now 😅
Sorry my english not good, what's people of colour? I heard this many places
In the “very suspecting teenagers” scene, she was supposed to misuse the word and supposed to have “bad acting” because it’s showing how fake and stupid the Karen is. Might be silly, but your criticisms just show the scene went over as intended.
I don't like movies like this being made. If you are using racism as material and not doing something beneficial for the community, you are just adding to the problem. I wouldn't want a child to see this bullcrap, nothing educational about it.
Its not the actor its the role 😂 cus that girl acted her ass off in orange is the new black.
You nailed it! After the first time I saw it I had to hate-watch it a second time. What were they thinking??!!??
who else wanna bet the people dropping 10/10 reviews saying it really shines a light on the racism problem in america are probably white girls on instagram
You look and sound like Gus fring
You're complaining about the acting from the girl who played pennsatucky on oitnb? She's bad in that too and oddly enough plays a tweaker so acting any way would be good, so it works
Slaving away is actually a phrase white people say a lot to each other by which they mean being a slave to the economic system more often than not.
Is it me or does the trailer already feel like the movie summed up with all the cookie cutter bs cut out.
Just here to say that the actress who plays Karen is amazing in orange is the new black so I don’t know what this was
oh my god I can't believe there's new deep D'Angelo lore he's immortal and ageless it's okay king nobody has a perfect memory that was 4.5 billion years ago
I didn’t say it because I knew it would summon her!
I feel so bad because the lady playing Karen plays Pennsatucky in Orange is the New Black and she was wonderful in that role.
You know a meme is dead when it appears in a movie
0:11 “i don’t remember the exact day i saw it created—“ what a hilariously brilliant throwaway line. fckin love this dude.
Maybe if this was a satire/ horror comedy than I would then it would work. But they are playing it straight and don't seem to have anything new to the table.
All the quality and subtlety of a lifetime movie.
if it ended with that simple line but actually showed real racist interactions it would’ve been perfect
she doesn't even have the cut 🤔
This movie just seems like a YouTube compilation of Karens except this time they're all the same person.  This movie is more about the novelty of a Karen rather than the hardships people face because of them.
Hhhmhghhggh I thought that actress was familiar 😶😶😶😶
Best ad all week? Sure All time would go to Mista GG
The ad transition was so smooth it gave me chills
D’Angelo deserves to be rich. Look at this man’s views 😍😍 he consistently producers quality content! We appreciate you!
Not the soap dispenser! 😲
Yo isn’t Karen an actress from oitnb
If it this satire they did a fantastic job.
oh stupid me!  summoning karen character! 😅😅 hmmph!
here's a really cringey quote from taryn manning about this role: "I felt a social responsibility to take on this role. Even if I had to play the villain to affect change around the globe, then I was more than willing to step into the role.
this feels like a dhar mann video
Never good enough? Maybe they will take your criticism and make a Karen 2
Feels like trying to cash in on real trauma with utter bs
I legit can't tell if this is meant to be a parody film or like an actual 'scary' horror film?
Karen: doesn’t like black people because she thinks they’re criminal  Also Karen: holding a gun, w some devious, SUSPECTING intentions
This just inflates illogical stereotypes in an unsettling manor. Holy shit and the acting from kArEn 🤦‍♀️
i can’t believe pennsatucky is like that in real life
LMAOOOOO no way they actually thought this was a good idea
taryn manning was sooo damn god in oitnb I'm disappointed
Why do I wanna watch this
Also in all cerealness, overdirecting is a thing. She is a phenomenal actress as we all know, but sometimes over direction takes all the subjective acting from a role because there is little creative freedom left. Also can we take a moment to discuss the scripts affects on an actors deliverance.. this again is why some of the top writers and directors alike give their stars wiggle room to interpret the character.
so taryn manning is literally season 1 pennsitucky
Ugh man …
nice hat
damn the actress who plays Karen was in Orange is the New Black too
I'm guessing the horror is guns?
KAREN CHARACTER KAREN CHARACTER KAREN CHARACTER       D'Angelo.. there's a Karen in the garden.
WOOHOO you're trending in America~
I feel bad for people named Karen. Like people keep using different names to describe certain kind of people and someone used mine once and I was like “damn.” Lmao random sorry
What in the bootleg Get Out is this shit
Isn’t the Karen actress from Orange is the New Black?
. . . you ve summoned her . . .
I'm waiting for them to say that the racists are coming from inside the house
hey Karen is the same crazy lady fro orange is the new black!
i know this doesnt have to do with the movie - but about dangelos new channel  it sounds like hes going to release some music, maybe an album/ep (i haven't been keeping up with everything hes doing tho, so it might be something else) quite exctied tho :')
If it’s free I’ll watch it lol, but I’m not paying for this lol- sounds like it wouldn’t be that good
LOL “it’s an A😵😵😵”
"Tell me about your new neighbors" "They're black"  Ah yes a completely normal human interaction  Edit: Like I said in my other comment, I wasn't saying stuff like this doesn't happen I just think the scripting was bad.
“You are officially a fool, because that means you summoned her “ I laughed so hard 😂😂
PLZ
the scariest part about this movie is that someone thought it was a good idea
wait wait.....he's married?
this is literally a lifetime movie
The acting got me thinking satire…
I actually used to like tarin manning when she played the character on OITNB, but shes a qanon supporter? Oh she crazy crazy. And her defending trump like that and saying "hes mean because hes being attacked" lmfaooo you mean being held accountable? Yeah f her forever and anyone who ever supported/supports that Shit bag. You have to be some short of some neurons and brain folds  in order to support that Shit head.  Open your eyes? Um we are thats why ppl did not like him. What a wacko.
Taryn Manning is absolutely a Karen. I remember waiting on her in NYC and she was a bitch. She didn’t want anyone to look at her, speak to her, and she had awful manners.
SCRUB YOU HAVE NO ROOM TO TALK SIT DOWN.
Is that the actress who plays Pennsatuckey?
I was shocked to see Tia Mowery's husband be in this movie. made me even more disappointed then I already was.
she went from karen, to murderous karen
The Karen’s built like Coraline’s mom lmao
Perfect casting, might watch
Bro yessssss like how are you gonna whitewash r*cism?
I saw this trailer the other day and I screamed internally at how tone deaf this was. I thought it was satire.. like I didn’t think they were actually going to make this a movie. 😫
Thanks for making one of the cringiest things I've seen in a while entertaining, D'Angelo.  Can confirm from having a parent on the HOA committee in their neighborhood that they really are that obsessed with minute details like trash cans, though in this case, they seemed more obsessed with controlling people's house colors rather than ruining black people's lives.  Wasn't Taryn Manning on Orange is the New Black?  You would think she would be less of a QAnon crazy due to that if nothing else.
D’ANGELO HEADS UP U FORGOT TO PUT THE END SCREEN STUFF ON
I kinda like it ......  Idk 😔😩
The only color that matters to these people is green
There’s no need to mystify the issue of a Karen/racism on contact. Like uhmmmmm 🤔
D’Angelo how do u feel about Call Me if You Get Lost
Ok but D'Angelo and Kennie J.D watching this in a collab would be EVERYTHING
Oh my god finished the video and am so upset by the taryn is a Karen revelation but her portrayed as pennsatucky was a little tooooo good
when you said "they white washed racism" i- i went speechless bc you are so right 😭😭
You can’t tell me this movie wasn’t made by Daar man
Aye Pensantucky from Orange is the new black , damnn she got the same type of character only that she did 1000000% better on OIRNB
I wanna believe Taryn Manning is just leaning into the bad acting full force for the fun but...
More intentionaly divisive clap trap. They are just shitting this stuff out at an incredible rate. It's like Joseph Stalin says. "Quantity has a quality of it's own"
Viva La Dirt League had an awesome Karen approach.
I couldn’t stop from laughing watching the trailer
Someone could compile 2 hours of irl footage of Karens in the wild and that would be less cringe than this movie
Jokes on you, I already knew I was a fool. 🤣
Sorry I'm still trying to see Pennsatucky as this Karen, I can't!
Not who made the potato salad 😂. Also they got hustle and flow woman playing Karen....I'm just waiting for Terence Howard to pop out her house and say "Karen, leave the people alone mane!"
Was kinda expecting better from Taryn Manning ....
the fact that the karen actress is literally in orange is the new black
Just from the title: I’m trying to see the humor but from the bottom of my soul I hate when people do this sh*t they make a cartoon villain that is so bad that the very people who are causing the most problems IRL can say “well I’m not exactly like her so I’m not a Karen”. I does more harm than good and helps to invalidate and bury real world concerns.  Edit/After watching: THANK YOU 😩
ugh exploiting trauma 😖
feels like a Lifetime network movie
number 43 on trending 💞♥️💞⏯️🤬♥️🤬🤬👍💯🙂🤬⏯️🤬♥️💞😀🔥🥺▶️🤬💕🍑
The fact that the note is an A is the scariest thing in the world
Legit if anyone sees this my school made a film trailer it's bad on purpose all we need is you to watch for 5 seconds for the view we wanna go viral https://youtu.be/TgNtz2gLYMU
The fact that they will make money from this is gross. Profiting off racism and black pain is not okay. Making a spectacle of racism and brutality is already an issue with social media, it doesn't need hollywood.
Girrrlllll that Karen is pennsatucky from orange is the new black💀💀💀
Man the director thought that  Karen + movie = 💸💸  cause of how ‘popular’ they are
isn‘t the karen actress also playing in orange is the new black ??
So Pennsatucky got out of Litchfield?
taryn manning plays characters like this all the time lmao. she played doggett in orange is the new black. a religious, racist, homophobic, transphobic white woman.
Why did this feel like an snl skit
"heated gaming moment" sent me
Im not an OITNB fangirl, I know a lot abt that show itself is problematic, but Manning being a Q head was not the information I thought I would be learning today. Not exactly surprised, but very disappointed.
I don't really like how they've personified racism into one character as if it's just a mean/weird person doing abnormal stuff and not yknow something the system was built on and still depends on today
i’m not black but a poc and i find this trailer and depiction of racism funny. you can tell someone who’s never faced hardcore racism wrote the script.
it just seems like they wannna do a social commentary but where too scared to
Could you talk about the Billie Ellish “cancellation”… I’m just lost af
I wouldn’t say Get Out was subtle. They literally wore black people like skin.
IS THAT PENSATUCKY
Thought it was a comedy at first
D’Angelo doesn’t remember the day the Earth formed because it was the day that everyone was doomed for eternity
Wow. She's a pretty horrible actress if she cant even act like her real self lmao
this movie trailer is just the show “THEM” but 800x worse. (btw if any of you can watch it I highly recommend the show it’s a very good thriller series)
This movie seems like it wants to call out the issue of racism, but is too scared to go all the way, making it just seem cringey.
BET as a network should be embarrassed to show this film on their network !!!!! Like come on BET we can do better than this 🤦🏾‍♀️
The trailer kind of feels like it could be a good SNL sketch
In my opinion, in Orange is the New Black, she actually did a good job. Also, she kind of always gave me a wrong vibe.
Is anyone suprised this movie was made???
I cannot wait for a bad movie and a beat on this one.
Now that I’m watching this her acting might be horrible but it looks like she was enjoying that role too much LMFAOOO
When i first watched this trailer, i was confused by the horror aspect over all cause she was just being rude asl but could be ignored in general?? like i thought it was a parody. it's also giving me those halloween fast food ads where, at the end, they tell you how to get the 2 for 4 meal
Shit I summoned Karen.
After she was in “The murder of Nicole Brown Simpson”… I wish I could say I’m shocked
No
Bruh she played a racist in orange is the new black...IM SEEING A PATTERN HERE
Taryn Manning plays a cringe character on Orange is the New Black too. Much more redeemable than this film, but it seems she's actually a cringe person. Cheers to terrible movies!
This is the church girl from orange is the new black
Here's the deal: My white girlfriend watched the trailer and said that nearly everything that happened also happened to her family. It was because they were renting their townhome, and the aggressive HOA (mostly white...but not exclusively) was very anti-renter. They were literally fined for things like flying a flag that was outside the allowable size range and for painting the rear shed door an "unapproved color," which was provided by the landlord. This should be an HOA horror story, not one proportedly about racism.
Wait, isn't that actress from Crossroads and Orange is The New Black? So weird to see her in this
Oh shit you live in Texas? welcome to the club 💀😩
Bro, you declared the actress a Karen based on one tweet that she deleted?
Thank you Father Wallace for your continual services. 🙏
i meannnn of course a person who plays a racist af character is a rasist af person irl cuz look if i was offered a role in a movie where i would have to say the most fucking racist stuff i would not accept that role soooooo just saying
Honestly, this seems like a rip off of the Amazon Prime show “Them” about redlining, white flight, and racism in the late fifties in California
Thanks D'angelo I needed a laugh , I've suffered from depression and chronic PTSD ,so I hope everything gets better for you ,me, and anybody suffering in silence ❤ p.s. this movie looks ridiculous it's almost making fun of racism and that's not okay ,will not be watching! And the lead actress is a known meth head🤢
I was in front of a mirror when I said "Karen-Karakter" and immediately my hair got a make over and my smile disappeared, like I can't smile anymore unless I see other Karen's. Fml :(
also, if you take a look, karen is the name of the movie, she take the most part of the scenes of the trailer, the most part of the speech (?), while the black people (who I think should be the main characters) don't even talk properly, like, by watching the trailer, I can't even assume the personality or their reaction or feelings about the racist shit that she is pushing against them. Is a cash grabber and nothing can take this out of my head, no one in the production cared about it even slightly.  (special thanks to Google translate)
honestly I want more shows and movies where non-white people, especially Black people, are actually HAPPY. there's way too many shows and movies about Black people being sad and facing racism all the time, which happens in real life, but it would be great if for once they showed Black people actually having a good time... and being happy.... you know?
It’s funny tho bc this actress is actually a racist Karen
Did they get the actors from Dhar Mann Stuidos? 😬
Ironic that Taryn complains about things that make white people look bad when she's in this movie.
That was a spectacular segway into the ad
Looks awful. Worst then a lifetime movie.
Why does this movie feel like downloading a cross between a Dhar Mann narrative and the movie Crash (2004), with deep social nuances as a cancelled DLC for it that you'll never be getting?
this is just a documentary on taryn mannings actual life
This isn't even good enough to be the walmart version of Get Out
pennsyltucky after prison
I think the worst thing about this movie is the casting 😂 taryn manning aint no karen lmao shes a tammy-lynn
👏🏾Who 👏🏾asked 👏🏾for 👏🏾this👏🏾
Why does this woman look like Charlie's bride if her head got smashed with a baseball bat
it's weird because i'm pretty sure the actress who plays karen was pensatucky in orange is the new black and she was decent in that
I cannot wait for the myriad of YouTube videos tearing this movie to shreds. It’s gonna be Cats all over again.
P... P-Pennsatucky?
*Almost always going after White people.*  Diversity? Incognito R
All I know is that I want to see Gangsta Rap: the Glockumentary more than I do this movie.
He's on Trending! Congrats, D'Angelo!
The king is back
Question.... If Taryn Manning isn't racist, then why is she posting a photo (12:11) of herself with two black friends from decades ago? Doesn't she currently have any black friends in her life and RECENT photos with said friends as an adult? It just seems rather strange to me to dust off an ancient photo from decades ago to claim that you're not a racist...
My personal fav: in a whisper "They're black." Oooooooooooooh so spoooooooky.
Someone please put Pennsatucky back in prison
I'm sorry D'Angelo but have you seen How to beat. You've got serious competition/
When you said "A Karen movie," I thought you meant a "white movie" or something, not an actual movie named Karen. We really deserve extinction.
isnt that the batshit lady out of orange is the new black, wow falls from grace.
okay I hope it wasn’t just me but I thought they aged up Camila mendes for this role-
yeah no I will stick with Get Out and Us for well-made horror flicks that tackle social issues, thanks
the fact its on BET 😳 not Lifetime BET
The actress who plays karen is also in orange is the new black. Why does this crazy white entitled lady part suit her soooo good,.
Does anyone know who the guy from the ad is? He's just so attractive I need to know!
I feel like Karen's would be a whole lot aggressive than this, which.. Is sad. 😀
As a black people in America, It ain’t no fucking way 😂😭
Oh yes, another brick to the massive wall of racial divide in out world
the karen looks like a female version of bill hader...
The first few seconds of the preview reminded me Lakeview Terrace starring Samuel l. Jackson.
Wtf is this thing sitting in this chair it look like a man boy but idk now a days
watching the trailer made me forget it’s supposed to be like a horror flick type thing. if it wasn’t meant to be a horror movie then i would get the over-the-top acting; it looked like a self-aware comedy type thing. but it’s not. and that’s the problem 😭😭
The movie is obviously going to bad but I think it is worth noting that they are focusing on microaggressions which is far more common nowadays than other more obvious means.
The fact that D'angelo has the same exact can't tell if it's ironic or not brand of narcissism as me makes watching so much more enjoyable
I just don’t get why Pensatuckey is playing a Karen. She doesn’t talk like a Karen
I feel like the only way they could get away with that title and that storyline is if it were comedy horror. This...is not that.
This movie is how dumbass leftists portray all conservative white women and ofc it isnt true cuz they havent seen what all conservative white women do and these lefties r just fucking stupid anyway. Or at least the tribal left is
if the characters feel bad and being abused I'm taking it seriously even if its a bad movie. the two African American people that is. I feel it's an interesting concept, good content keep it up, I do understand that this is watered down, is it passive-aggressive vs passive as opposed to straight out violence like American history x. keep well
Let's make political gain from dividing the colors, Let's make youtube cash from dividing the colors, Let's make movie money from dividing the colors, Let's raise my celeb profile from dividing the colors...........USA you are finished, pure and simple!
I thought the movie was a joke.. naw this a actual movie. 🤣🤣
Does anyone else know someone named Karen and genuinely feel bad for them. I mean u don’t choose your name
Felt like I was watching Dora when you told me to say “Karen Character”, than asked if I did it and I nodded.
The actress who is the karen is pensentucky from OITNB! Idk how i feel about her in this role but I liked her in her previous work
i want to watch this movie just so i can talk shit abt something cuz sincerely i'm bored af
I am a FOOL
Okay but that transition to the sponsor was brilliant
It bad
My theory: she got into the role knowing it would suck, but now any time someone Googles "Taryn Manning racist" or "Taryn Manning Karen behavior" the search results will overwhelmingly turn up results for this movie instead of her past behavior and controversies. It's the same tactic used by UK PM Boris Johnson when he cheated on his wife with and married a model; he then did an interview on how he was VERY into model train making.  *apparently it's model buses. Oops
That's the girl from orange is the new black
No this cannot be real
Yeah, definitely someone trying to be Jordan Peele. I thought this was so cringe that the director must’ve been white, but he’s not 😦 on top of Get Out, there’s also that short movie « Two Distant Strangers » that I really liked, because it’s literally an embodiment of Say Their Names.
I am going to watch it 😅
She kicks over the trashcan but it's still full of trash.
I'm making a Felicia movie.
Isn't that the actress from orange is the new black?
I never thought I’d hear the word: glockumentary, but here we are 😭
How is no one adding the fact that “Karen” is also in the movie “Crosswords” with Brittany spears.
did anyone else not notice that karen is pennsatucky / tiffany from orange is the new black??
i did the karen thing why arent i dead yet i did it bc i wanted to DIE !!! PAL DO IT
Taryn Manning ? 🤣🤣🤣
Watch the movie then have an opinion. Making an entire video based on a trailer…. Okey
Imagine a movie named , “ Tyrone “ where he makes white people, cops , and everyone lives a nightmare …it wouldn’t make it on paper
This is just Over the Hedge but live action and more or less the same amount of RJs.
Brandon Rogers did it better xd
I was thinking the same thing!! It’s definitely dollar store version of Jordan peeles work.
the karens actress like promoted Qanon in that insta caption which is a like far right white supremacist thing 😬
Why do i get racist Leslie Knope vibes?
Lové this actress so much
i don’t understand the overall message or reason of this movie… like it’s just an entire trigger for us Black people. why are we constantly depicted in deeply saddening racist films when most create no discussion. like…we know this is our reality. it just shoves into our face, and reminds us more how awful this world can be and increases anxiety & hyper-vigilance which we have to live with everyday.
12:13 if this is not people saying I'm not rasict cuz I have a black friend then I dont know what is
All I have to say is this is the dumbest trailer I have ever seen I feel like it was the white actor say all the rasict thing they wanted to say and not get backlash about it
Why is Taryn Manning so good as Pennsatucky in OITNB and just not in her movies? Also until you showed her post, I had no idea... she really is a KAREN. Taryn is a Karen! Wooooooow.
DANGELO MADE IT ON TRENDING YAYYYYY
Is that pennsatucky?
I hate how the Karen thing is so sexist, it only attacks middle aged women when there are so many horribly racist middle aged men too, where’s their nickname?  I agree that all racists should be called out but why does it have to be so gendered?
The scene where she called the police and started crying- like oh my even real Karens act better
I refuse to believe this is real
I'm disappointed that this “movie” isn't about a Karen having an affair with a manager😔😂
hey, the movie trailer might've sucked, but at least we get to see  d'angelo's face.
The acting!! THE ACTING!!🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 This is a try not to cringe challenge!!
Thank you, with this, I have a new and more improve way to vomit!! BET white washing racism
Oh no I’m a fool!!!
So we're not going to talk about the anti police and anti white propaganda in this movie? Lol how did you miss it smh
Is this... the one crazy girl from Orange is the new black?
If you scream KAREN, three times in the mirror... You'll get a a knock on your day in bout half hour
btw taryn manning actually plays pennsatucky from oitnb, whom worships Jesus very intensely (almost mocking religious people that are oblivious to reality...? correct me if im wrong i might be reading the character wrong) which is very ironic considering shes actually religious outside of the show as we can see from her deleted post. i really thought she wouldnt be religious bc of how they expressed her character in oitnb but i was wrong!
I'll be watching just for Taryn Manning. 😁 ... Very confused about "Karen" definition now.
The actor who plays Karen is such a good actor in other shows. Pennsatucky, why are you in this shitty movie?
Is it a movie or are they actually just following this lady around irl?
WHITE women. It was a term coined by black Twitter to describe how some WHITE women act in public when they don’t get their way or feel that they have some sort of authoritative power over minorities in this country.
It looks like what a white person would think racism is after only listening to other privileged white people last year
"Not all neighbors are friendly" 💀
This seems like it's trying to be "Them" and nobody can "Them" like "Them" can.
The one thing about the trailer I can comment on (as a white person) I think this movie is going to hurt the POC community, like you said. It's whitewashed racism some how. If I had to try to make a comparison it'd be like making a movie about homophobia and the worst thing said that was outright homophobic was "Well I just don't think it's right!" While having scenes of blatant homophobia happening. Karen's fucked
it’s doggett oml
This has to some kind of satire, this can’t be real, FYI the acting in this movie is just plain atrocious.
THE PIANO IN THE BACKGROUND??? AYO??? IS HE GOING TO MAKE MUSIC OR SOMETHING…
Subtlety is for cowards who prefer pastels over neons, this looks good
Girlboss gatekeep gaslight?!!!
If anyone’s curious-Coke Daniels is white. And he’s pretty damn pleased that ‘Karen’ has been compared to ‘Get Out’. But are we gonna address his other work…?
In bad movies, I never look down on the actors/how they act/perform. I think it's not right. They didn't do it to harm but to do their jobs. It's those behind the scene who should be called out. I think the woman playing Karen did a fantastic job, she looks like your everyday neighbor lady.  The idiot behind the scene should watch Chinese historical dramas............... He could learn from those consorts and/or latest Empress' waifu's Karen Power.
Watch Chinese historical dramas...............consorts and/or current Empress' waifu is always a Karen.
the actor really said, "oh just be myself got it"
This movie belongs in Pornhub.
Went to subscribe just to find out I already am
fuck you racist
I think they MIGHT have made this movie so vanilla so that white racists could POTENTIALLY watch it...? Lol I’m not sure. I just feel like if it was showing the true brutality then white people would run and hide and maybe they were trying to make it more palatable for the softies
Production quality is just a big no for me...🖓  "What is that, an f#?...  It's and A"... 😂😂😂😂
I actually feel bad for Karen's now after watching this trailer
Real life Karen's are way scarier than this. 😂
I had the same reaction, lmao. This is basically a documentary. ;~;  So this is very exploitative & triggering. We don't need a "horror movie" about things that happen everyday. It's like, desensitizing, in a way. It also gives racists the opportunity to point to these occurrences & say, "See! These things are horror movie tier, not real life issues!" smh.  About "Get Out", too. Loved that movie. They kind of embraced the "outrage marketing" aspect. No one knew what it would be about exactly. But once you watched it, it was creepy af & had some top-tier social commentary. I still see people(racists/reactionaries) though, who haven't seen it, who just remember the outrage about it, so they still say it's "race-hustling" or something. -_- I tried to reason with one of them recently, telling them to actually watch it & they'd be pleasantly surprised with how good it is. But of course, they wouldn't listen. :/ So disappointing, that there's so many close-minded people.
Lmaoo this movie is silly I cant even describe how stupid this is 🤣
I still upset Karen holding the dog  Breaks my heart whenever I see that Pet is not toy
it is a piece of garbage. good video sir
the trailer is so awful. it honestly feels like an snl sketch, not an actual movie lol its so confusing to watch bc it feels like satire but.. not.
One of my favorite movies is called Split. And it does an interesting job at depicting the vast change in people real multiple personality disorder is. But it’s also a good horror movie too. Like when The Beast took over I really felt scared, partly because that’s similar to my other side and also cause seeing someone rip off iron bars with their bare hands is just....wow. This feels like something that saw the movies like that and said “those did well lemme get their money without the work”
Sad. That actress was actually good in Orange Is The New Black
Are we sure this isn't a comedy lol
literally no one asked for this
“That means you’ve summoned her” LOL
I thought the movie would be about a Karen locking people on a store until a manager arrived and terrorise people and be like a sort of horror-comedy movie. Not an actual horror movie
I know this doesn’t relate to the video but D’Angelo’s hair 🤩 is growing like damn
Hi why aren’t u talking about Palestine
I was thoroughly surprised to see that the writer and director of this movie is actually african-american himself.
the "a" in the movie trailer stands for AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH cause I'm in pain
funny how that kid's one line is better than every other actors' acting in the whole trailer
get out on a budget
So White women are Karen's and black women are sheneneh ( from TV show Martin)
What's up with the voice enhancer?
The trailer is preety cool but like idk
who is this movie even for?
this gives off the same energy of that Steven universe episode when garnet was like "kids....dont be racist 😀"
I bet she wanted to talk to the director
I feel like this movie would be better categorized as a documentary.
what i wanna know is why is this about black people?  ive seen most of the Karens going after either managers or chinese people because of the pandemic. i mean,  i get why because black vs white is such a hot button that ofc they wanna cash in on it but c'mon.
What the fuck was she even saying in that post ???? I’m legit so confused
omg isnt the karen character a character in orange is the new black or am i going insane
as funny and as shitty this trailer is, i have a fear that some white racist women will find this a girlboss story for themselves  ps: love ur videos!!
Pour one to the curb out of respect to the now deceased, early promise of Taryn Manning's acting career.
when did pennsatucky become a karen
As a fan of terribly done movies, I cannot wait to see this.
Omg I remember seeing a casting call for this on backstage 😂
honey not bet 🤦🏽‍♀️ they just showing who own the network
This feels like a bad ripoff of Get Out. I literally said that out loud before you mentioned it. Or it's meant to be so bad it's funny. I mean, it got you to make a video about it so people are def talking and may even watch just for shits and giggles. And tv stations don't care about why you view, just that you view. So maybe lets not give this anymore attention.  Taryn Manning plays the trashy racist meth addict in Orange is the New Black so.... I guess she is that person in real life too?
Is this another one of those incredibly racist movies that supposed to make us all better but in turn just makes us all hate each other like everything else?
That trailer looked like SNL skits 🤣
2:23
PENSSATUCKY?!
Do you think we'll find out that this is really a Dhar Mann movie?
This seems like a parody trailer...
Candyman will tear this movie to shreds with his hook
We should all call male Karens "Darrens"
She was in orange is the new black
Bro it literally looks like a parody. He put it perfectly when he said is was YouTube acting.
More anti-white propaganda...exactly what the world needs lol. This trailer is just funny.
My initial thought was that it’d be really good as a satire. Like I’m hoping the marketing is just trying to get attention and the actual movie will be a dark comedy. I kinda made a connection to jordan peele’s work as well, plus that one recent-ish movie antebellum. It feels like racism horror is kind of becoming a trend, which I’m totally here for, I mean horror has always been about real life fears including social issues right, but when it’s done so badly it just looks like a huge joke. I really hope if this trend continues it’s written with care and the right amount of realism.
Didn't make it to the first 100k, but subscribed😅
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN31FCcUlLk      The Dangers of Evolution
I'm still confused is it even real? Is it a parody? Was this a fever dream?
I only knew the actress from Orange is the new black where she played a very homophobic racist bible waving character (and i won't even mention her "redemption arc" because that was problematic af), i didn't know about her posts but at this point i can safely assume that she chooses to play dumb homophobic/racist characters for a reason.
Why are you hating on the movie you nerd fuck
So... Is the color coding of waste disposal bins a regional thing, or did they put their garbage in the compost bin?
is that the lady from orange is the new black lmao😭😭
The new “Room”
isn't that the woman from orange is the new black?
Insensitive, I thought it was directed and written by a full team of white people
Idk what's worst the movie or your victimized review
The first time I step back into a movie theatre it won’t be for this
The Karens are negative at the comment section! 😂😂
What the dickens does “you people” mean! I don’t understand why people treat others so disrespectfully. We all bleed red, humanity seems to be going to hell in a hand basket. I see a definite“rotten tomato” contender.  Stay safe best wishes from South Australia 🇦🇺💐
It is just so bizarre to me how they can add mediocre racism, bad acting & horror all into on trailer, But the fact that that trailer is just a snippet of A movie is just way worse.
Podcast channel it’s lit
The Karen movie isn’t the only bad thing coming out, wait till you see Q-Force
They overdramatize something very real like it's a fantasy style lifetime movie and it makes it easier to dismiss it like it's over the top outlandish concepts. A racist could easily turn and say oh I'm not threatening little kids with a pistol, so I'm not racist but they still do things that are racist they believe is just fine.
"Heated gaming moment racism" 😭
Looks like a parody tbh
❤️❤️
Not doggett from orange is the new black 😭😭
Can't wait til bill burr see this movie
whats crazy is that actress is actually so good in wentworth like idk what shes doing in this movie i really dont
also why is the audio balancing on the trailer trash
Ok not all white people are like this. I find it awful funny that this movie is just saying every white person does this. I'm not fucking racist. I don't care about race at all but the fact that this movie is just saying all white people are like this is bullshit. And it's not ok. I know there are Karen's out there and it's sad but saying all white people are bad is in fact racist
I think it was just for clout and a quick buck. Its really tone deaf given our current social climate.  If I wanted to see anything from 'Karens' POV, I'll go on TikTok and watch freakout compilations 🙄
Almost all of the people who are racist don't like to show it, they will say racist things and try to hide them up. This movie shows just plain common already known open racism.
The only good thing abt the film will be the flood of parodies and satirical videos that will come out about it.
Wait is the lady who plays Karen from Orange is the New Black??
Honestly whenever a movie/commercial is so tone deaf or dumb like this movie trailer, I genuinely wonder if there was not ONE person that stepped back and noticed how dumb the idea is. On another note, D’Angelo is really cute and I’m shocked he’s the same age as me from how well spoken he is and I struggle to order a pizza over the phone :/
I love your hands
It’s actually just a two hour long snl skit. Pranks on us
someone tell Tia to come collect her husband
The Karen actress was actually a bit famous for starring in Hustle and Flow and 8 mile
Capitalism finds away
Is it just me or is the Karen character played by the crackhead from orange is the new black?
Not saying it as a fact but an interesting theory of mine is could the whole tweets and that could have been to promote the film like with the whole clown thing for the it movie from ages ago but if not I bet the reason that Karen’s acting is so bad is because she is a Karen irl so her acting is her doing a Karen job of it
So no I'm not sharing in this immature assessment of a film that nailed what it's like being acosted by a "Karen". You have the right to tune it out but there's nothing funny about the trailer. As a filmmaker I think it's validating those who are made fun of by the likes of you who...seem to be living it up. If anything the antics of the "Karens" nation wide are childish, desperate, and dangerous for many who have died because a malignant narcissist can't stand they are loosing control.
why do I feel like this movie still paints white ppl in a better light…
racism is the national guard’s choir singing the lion king song for Juneteenth….on national television
no one says “I don’t like black people”
Completely shocked to see any downvotes..... guess we now know exactly how many Karens are D'Angelo fans
This video…this video is gold
I’m laughing at something
I think it is a waste of money, yet its making light of the huge problem we as humans have . I hate it infact. Ill probably watch it when it comes out on Netflix.
we will never be free
1:11 D'angelo i-
ill spare thee from  the 9999 other questions i have, but where in the broken cutlery did the fucking budget for the good quality wigs go?
Love to see you Trending!! 😎
The king is back
I have a Karen in my neighborhood, one time she came to our house, and told us to stop shooting fireworks....on the 4th of July.
its just dharr man but more mature
Tiffany dogget got reincarnated as a Karen?
01:01 I challenge you to do that... you whining idiot. I bet you will not have anything close to what this movie depicts
Alright D’Angelo, it’s out. I am expecting an album review of call me if you get lost.
"This is serving my wife divorce papers at 3 AM prank, free iPhone giveaway acting." 🤣🤣🤣
can someone add subtitles please :’-) i really wanna watch this
It's an A.
Yikes
It’s 1:15 in the morning you can’t be making me laugh like this 🤣  Edit: I’m sorry is that a noose in the title? 💀
“This is YouTube acting” 😂👌🏽
She's so good in orange is the new black wtf
If the leftists fuckwits would like for racism to end. This is NOT the way to do it.  Being racist towards white people isn't way to end racism. And before they realize it. No change will happen.
for real this is definitely an snl sketch with kate or kristen as the karen istfg
i can’t find the channel 🥲
Lmfao
“Get out” seemed more about the fear of assimilation and loosing your own identity
I'm officially a fool 👌🏾🤦🏽‍♀️😹 okay but sometimes I worry that D'Angelo is an actual cult leader. "Don't ask questions" omg I'm scared but I will subscribe anyway.
Karen’s wasn’t necessarily about racism, it is women who are cocky/nosy! There are racist Karen’s but that’s not what ALL Karen’s are.
"As a black people" lolwut??
Keep stirring that pot
Karen's is a racist slur.
Oh no...my actual name is Karen and Ive maintained this attitude of "these asshole ladies need to chill so I can have my name back"...but now...I think I gotta go by my middle name. Shit. Oh and let me top this off...Im Karen the manager....the memes! The memes! And now this, I dont want any of this association!  🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ I guess Im Liz now lol.
I feel like Taryn Manning is the type of person who agrees to be in this movie to prove her "support" and prove she isn't racist, but it only just draws actual parallels to her racist actions.
D'angelo: did you do it? Me: yes!  D'angelo: you're officially a fool! Me: 😦
Just seems like nothing but to try to cash in on a trend  Quite sad really
Guys this was made on IMOVIE it is the same font for the end credits and this is what they look like mind is made up
Wait what... Taryn Manning is a q Anoner???? That also means she's like her character in Orange is the new black.  That's insane
that karen lady looks like the girl from orange is the new black hold on i gotta do some research update: so it is dogget from the show and that’s horrible bc i’ve seen her do so much better
this is like something I would based on Wat I've seen on the internet
this trailer is like an snl skit
Okay this is really a SNL sketch isn't it asks Taryn Manning is just the guest host right?
this movie would be much cooler if karen like murdered people
I've always felt that when stars, like Taryn Manning or Octavia Spencer (in "Ma"), do movies like this, it's bc they needed money. Like- that's the only logical conclusion I can, and have, come to.
MAKE A VIDEO ON BRITNEY I BET YOU'LL BLOW UP EVEN MORE!
D'angelo.... You are not in cosplay and I'm very upset.  I would like to speak to the manager, please
The trailer just feels like a parody to me.
It's a a whole miss and should be ignored completely. That's it. That's all.
They already have a book and a mini series good quality of Karens degrading black people it’s called little fires everywhere 💀
Thank you. I need to laugh because everything is breaking in my house and insurance isn’t doing anything
Why does the karen actress sounds like she's constantly drunk lmao
Not d’angelo having perfect pitch uwu
Why do I get the feeling that they probably offered the Karen role to Lindsay Lohan, but she wouldn't even do this gig? Also, that's Taryn Manning from Crossroads & Orange is the New Black? She looks unrecognizable.
Is that Pennsatucky?
There are so many free Karen videos on YouTube already...why would I pay for it when I can watch it for free? It's not really entertaining, just creepy.
I thought it was like- stupid. Honestly? It’s not spreading awareness- at least in my opinion- it’s not. We all know that, that is racism. And they almost depict it as Dangelo said “not that bad”. Which can make the problem worse.
This is why I love your channel it’s so awesome that you put this out there I hope this movie fails cause it’s disturbing 😳
it’s an a
wow- about 500 karens have chosen to dislike.
“It’s an A…” I died
I believe the writers intentionally (and cleverly) used the word “suspecting” BECAUSE it was out of context; a lot of IRL Karen videos show them using incorrect terms and unintentionally revealing that their ignorance has levels.
The point is to show how racism can be implicit
Like you said at one point, it looks like satire. I can’t believe it’s even real, lmao
I really feel like this movie is a harmful parody of racism.
Pennsatucky what are you doing here 😳
Film was literally written and directed by a black man... shit on it all you want, but you're just pitting people against a POC director and his movie
This movie has to be one of the most unintentionally comedic, yet terrifying films for all the wrong reasons in cinematic history.
ONG I JUST REALIZED SHES FROM ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK 😭
Will watch online!!!
Y’all be careful don’t say karen character in the mirror three times. You might actually summon one🤣
this feels like an snl sketch
Cashiers deserve a better Karen movie than this
This trailer was so ghe-tto lmfaoo They thought they were giving “Get Out,” but they gave us “Go Away.”
The movie does continue the discussion on our society’s obsession with black pain… by literally glorifying black pain as entertainment. So yeah this movie is disgusting.
They really got a literal racist to play a literal racist...... I mean hey, from what I saw she played it REALLY WELL. Probably the role she been waiting on 😭
Nobody. And I mean. NOBODY is named "Taren". Except this actress playing a Karen. WOW 🤭🤣🤣🤣🤣
9:45 buck breaking 🤔
🤣 I feel like they put the WHOLE movie in this trailer though. We don't even need to watch it, just watch the trailer. Gave it all away lol
Waste of time how exactly is your channel filled with subscribers a.k.a. people etc. is astonishing congratulations plus hopefully you can go outside perhaps get a COVID-19 shot you need 2! Indeed I do not know where you are from and yes this message that he will never look upon or even care to read but I will keep talking why not... Eat your vitamins maybe eat vegan food drink water start tanning a little bit each day micro nutrients salad beats yams apples spaghetti squash! Potatoes tomatoes etc. etc. read more books that are in book form even longer tangent?.. maybe edit your videos a little better with music that’s only a thought I don’t know and I could not tell if that was a ring if you were married or not but it looks cool!  should i keep going probably not but I’m going to! I think tween knowledge others differences is going backwards in time then forwards it’s just my opinion humans are humans nothing more good thing in a {cato ato th o windowo} speaking in a Celtic can’t like form meow ;) mew Nya nyu mew m-yeow m M m m M m m M M m M m Meow? . . Switching backwards to Egliish!? Now a non-suspicious story Mr. noodles and Mrs. noodles we’re having their favourite soup of the day onions tomatoes diced avocado on the side ambrosia apples cut into the shape of stars then Mr. noodles bumped up next to Mrs. noodles they look passionately into each other‘s eyes and they knew deep down in their bowl! It was time slithering their way in tangling within each others thick noodle noodles rubbed and soon oh yes yes^  y yes Mrs. noodles a little noodle noodle oh Lord it’s bigger than I thought Mr. noodles that’s what she said oh stop it Mrs. noodles we have a baby noodle in the bowl. Ooh My oh my! Then all of the sudden a humanoid figure holding a pair of wooden like chopsticks a.k.a D’Angelo Wallace chan. Winding up no Mrs. noodles screaming that’s my baby don’t eat my baby Mr. noodles I’ll try to stop him! Hhoo! But it was too late mouthful after mouthful gulping *asmr noises* Mr. + Mrs. noodles we’re finally consumed..! / MW1?
The sponsor transition was cool lol
@D’Angelo Wallace Fun fact: The actress playing the Karen character is Taryn Manning from the Netflix show Orange Is the New Black.
I actually said "Karen character" 3 times and it was legitamately creepy. Took me back to my childhood to the "say Bloody Mary 3 times in the dark, in front of a mirror, as a dare" days 😳
This movie is garbage; I loved Get Out.
Y'all surprised about a Karen movie in a Industry that gave you a Emoji movie, a movie based on a app about birds crushing into stuff and Cats. Bruh
When you read the title and just have no words to say 😶 I can’t deal 😂
Not Pensatucky
Dude you didn't actually play the clip 🤦
I live in south Texas also and if you go to any back roads you will find the forbidden flags without a doubt. Let alone I go to almost all white school as a black person 🥲.
Bleach your eyebrows?
For everyone who is struggling to draw the dots. This is a SPOOF MOVIE. It's a low budget movie, that is leveraging off the current cultural environment. It's just a movie people, it's not real. This movie will do great ($$$). Everyone is talking about it. The timing of this movie is on point. The fact that they even called the main character "Karen" is genius. People are losing there minds on that alone. There seems to be so many cheap racist jokes and innuendos we can all laugh at.   For those who think this is a serious film. I truly feel sorry for you.
Are they saying Karens are all racist? I think this movie is about to be cancelled by karens and all theaters are closing after one viewing
I was in front of a mirror so I am not taking my chances (regarding saying Karen character 3x)
The whole trailer seems like an SNL sketch
Omg 😂 Taryn Manning was great in Hustle & Flow ! Filmed right here in Memphis !
Omg no wonder i feel so comfortable around you I'm also from south Texas 😭😭😭 you sound like me and my brother 😭😭 much love!!
More race baiting garbage to divide us
Is it just me or does this hit like a script by a Karen that's frustrated they're now a punchline?
I feel like we’re living in the twilight zone lmao not tptb out here creating whole parodies of black plight parading around as serious thrillers playing in our faces 😩😭
It is interesting, i don't know the origin of the phrase "Karen"but i always (or at least for as long as i've been aware of the idea) associated it with just a certain type of "i want to see the manager" type person ,like there are provably lots of "Karens" who are racist but i didn't think that was a characteristic someone needed to qualify? like i would have previously thought anyone of any age race or gender could be a "Karen" cos it's more about entitlement and self centredness than anything but perhaps i misunderstood. Either way great video D'angelo , always enjoy them.(It's weird i love video essays (for want of a cooler name) but i don't know anyone else who does,i feel like i'm part of a secret club even though looking at the views,comments and subs on most of my favorites i'm definitely not alone haha,hi guys.)
If Karen isn't your cup of tea, "Shaquita" comes out this fall.
I feel like the idea was there but calling her Karen seems like they just want to make a 2 hour movie making fun of Karen's online with a background theme of racism.
"There's absolutely no way this can go wrong "
Maybe I'm stupid, but was that ring on D'Angelo's finger always there?
Honestly, if this movie was just about a crazy woman and was not a commentary on racism and white women tears, I think it wouldn’t be that bad. I think these are things that should be talked about, just not like this.
im sorry but i can’t see her other than pennsatucky
This movie is only going to make things worse, no go will come of it except damage and I say that as a white women who has witness racism all my life.
BRO IS TRENDING!! congrats
Its gonna be just like the Sonic movie. 12 yr olds are gonna watch it cuz they aren’t self aware. And people who are self aware are gonna watch it cuz its probably cringe and you can make fun of it
Day 2 of asking him to cover creepshow art
good make sure it is an asian and black karen and one be trans the other gay
blacks are the most racist group
wait this is an actual movie??? i thought it was an snl skit
mama im back
This is not a horror it is a legit comedy 😂😭
A moment of silence to all women named Karen. RIP 💀
THE *WHAT*
wow the girl from OITNB really fell off
Ur so funny but this makes me SO MAD OOOOF
I thought they would've taken the Narcos route to mix documentary with the stories of the real officers and the actor's acting but this is just mediocre. Imagine an Olympic athlete "throwing" the javelin, but really just placing it gently on the floor, that's this movie.
I had no idea Taryn was actually exactly like her Orange is the New Black character. I thought she was just a good actress like almost everyone else on that show. But apparently she's not. Holy shit.
This looks like an SNL skit
Looks like the trailer was made with iMovie
1:11 Well played my guy 3:20 …Well played, again
i think that your point when you said people will see this and say “ racism isn’t that bad”  is a great point.
I hate that the name 'Karen' is used for white women who are over the top prejudice, problematic, and someone who you would want to avoid really upsets me because Karen is my moms name and my mom is the sweetest woman you would ever meet. My mom will always have your back and is nothing like the Karens that are seen in viral videos.
I like this dude d’angelo he’s cool but he got that baby face like he’s never gonna grow a real mustache
why does this feel like an SNL fake ad
Shes the character shes playing in the movie and yet somehow she still cant act lol
ANOTHER snowflake 🤦
What you revealed about Taryn Manning might be why she is probably the only white actress with an actually viable career who would accept such an idiotic part.
One single valuable potential I see is the existential horror of being hated just because of the colour of your skin. But like, they fucked up the tone and delivery and everything in between...
this is just a compilation of Karen videos on twitter w horror music in the back?
That's the girl from Hustle and Flow
Are you serious, this is an actual movie, what has the world come to             P.s I feel bad for anyone named Karen, you are probably nice, I hope
is that Bill Hader
why does she look like Walmart Veronica Lodge tho
this trailer feels like millennials needed to show off that they now “understand” microaggressions
BLM is a Marxist organization funded by left wingers and *does* deserve criticism, and one of the most malicious things about its supporters is calling anyone "racist" who disagrees with this organization.
How. Do you. Keep. Getting. Prettier.
YouTube acting! 🤣
Fun fact: the guy from that first scene that's laughing is Renny. aka "Why you always lying".
I feel so honoured to be a part of D'Angelo Wallace's world domination plans!!! 🤩
This movie looks so wild. Taryn Manning is a real life karen and always plays racist characters.
This trailer is...a thing. So bizarre. On a lighter note, I’ll gladly stan your world domination lol
11:46 literally none of that post makes sense wtf
Pensatucky!
I don't think he realizes she's an actress from an award winning show
Omg the acting is HORRIBLE!!!!
Wow. Get off your high horse. Instead of sounding intelligent you just sound bitter.
Ahhh shit it’s Pennsatuckey
Mi Karen lica es ser vieja y horrorosa lista pal asilo
Trash. You need to shut the fuck up
Just heard you sing for the first time on Ethan’s roast and holy shit🥰🥰 I want to hear more!
the trailer's so horrible in every conceivable way I would almost think it's satire but simultaneously know bc it's so awful it couldn't possibly have been made to give anyone a good chuckle which is tremendously worse.
Wow I didn't expect Taryn Manning to be acting unironically like her character from Orange is the New Black Season 1 IRL
did you miss that the Karen is Pennsatucky, she's famous for playing a stereotype, this isn't Streep.
I love being part of world domination!
Pensatucky from OITNB can definitely act better than she did in this trailer!
"insert the age of the world, I don't remember the exact day I saw it created" *D'Angelo has always been here. He will always be here. He reigns eternal in the cosmos. When the end of the world comes, only D'Angelo will remain. He is one with the universe*
-5 IQ Moment NGL
Oh my god she actually pulled the “I’m not racist I have black friends”
Hey LOVE your channel! I just wanted to comment I’d love to see at least occasional content of good deeds! Even if it’s good you’re already doing! I think more content of good deeds is heavily needed and as a consumer it’s what I want. Imagine every influencers uploading just 2 videos a month of good deeds! Pls consider it 😔❤️
Ngl I think this is the first thing I ever bought/downloaded because of a YouTube sponsor
This looks like an SNL sketch that got out of hand.
Algorithm comment
No but why does Karen look like the lady from Over the Hedge???
#taren ha!! She’s awful..
Subtitles please! :(
"Them" is an scary tv show that is what this movie is trying to be. "Them" is kinda like "Us" and "Get out". A black family moves into a white neighborhood and the white people go crazy to get them out and hurt them.
What's sad is the kid was the best actor.
Taryn Manning in this is so surprising. And weird. Must watch.
It feels like a movie written and directed by Twitter
I could see a Karen movie as a satirical comedy or something, and I got excited about that, but this is just bad
I think Taryn Manning (the actress playing Karen) comes off as fake because Karens ARE fake. Karens ARE acting. Karens ARE needlessly dramatic. I think she intentionally wants to come off that way. (Also I think this movie is PURPOSELY a "so bad its good" film)
Not the Glockumentary 💀
I laughed out loud I could NOT take it seriously.  I'm still hoping this satire
Watch this be the first horror movie to win an Oscar because it's 'groundbreaking'
I liiiiiiive for you lol
guaranteed, Karen will rake it in...due to the curiosity and hate watchers....they've made their money back with this bad press
There are black people named Karen
Oh no, white women...ahhhhhhh.
What in the world is this movie?! Oml it is like as you said like captions off of the black squares that ppl posted on ig… there is literally nothing in this movie. Also I feel so bad that you and your family have dealt with these things, as well as in (south?) Texas scary very scary

Brah, I just discovered you by happenstance when looking up the KAREN trailer.  You are so nuanced, funny, charming, and on point.  You just got a new subscriber!
Why is no one talking about how this was already made like a month ago but way better?? It’s called Them on Amazon prime this is literally a parody of Them
Might just be your best video yet!! Thoroughly enjoyed this!
Have you noticed how D'Angelo always wears different clothes for paid sponsorship so we know when to skip it to
Ah yes another example of Hollywood thinking they can do something better than the internet and failing
Thought the Karen lady was from a dhar Mann sketch
it hurts to see pennsatucky here
The movie looks like some youtube parody skit of Jordan Peele's movies.
ahhhh the kings back ily!!!
The best director could tell other cheap crass ditectors not toake films that ate too familiar bit stupid the way they could've and should've a film should make sense. I thankl you. Mr Wallace for giving all the detail what directors shouldve made storyline so relevant. Thank you Mr Wallace!!!!
It looks bad but for some reason I want to see it
I seriously can’t believe they made a movie out of real life racist situations 🤦🏽‍♀️
Straight "Oreo"
Movies/cinema talks to people. Example, women and children were considered to be owned by the husband/man.  In the 70s and 80s there were several.movies regarding this.  In the 60s there were movies made about racism. Movies are a great way to get in the face of everyone.
She doesn’t even have a Karen haircut.  They didn’t due any research.
Lmao that woman is literally Pennsatucky!?
Wait isn’t that the same actress from orange is the new black?
rich people doing better after the pandemic is good news? lol
This is cringey... lifetime would have done a better job! I wish better directors made this movie its such a waste of a good concept!
This needs to be number 1 on trending
PENNSATUCKY LEAVE THEM ALONE
Not even a full minute into the video and my bunny slippers just ran for cover...
John 3:16-17 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.17-For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
And he isn’t even joking about the confederate flags in Texas 😭😭
Imfao she also played a racist in orange is the new black.
Get Out was horrible.
this trailer was the most counterproductive thing i’ve ever seen shawty
i’m scared that racism is going to be taken less seriously bc of this movie
"and like as a black people in america..."
There was some other flick where the brother from Clueless and Scrubs was married to a "Karen"...   ...they're friends with three other couples that she'll torment, (of course) which is one thing but...  ...watching her terrorize him, was too much...so they take her out, and have to cover it all up... Gawd I wish I could remember the name of it ffs!!
Ew
I can see this movie getting a negative review
i feel like a lot of white ppl think that racism is just name calling and hating black people💀
Off topic: Anybody know what the outro music is? Sounds heavenly.
Is it me or is this a very bad ripoff of Get Out?
Are you making a video on creepshow? I'm aware that she motioned you in her lolcow post. I completely understand if you're not especially since other creators already talked about it.
I fee like this would be degrading to anyone actually named Karen. The whole "Karen" concept isn't even that serious.
Ayyy ur trending rn
I'm mean Jesus  New York and Texas need to get their shit together it's not 1792 anymore.
I said Karen Character 3 times out loud and then you gave me time to say it so I proceeded to say it 3 more times. Then you said I summoned her. And that is how my day is going.
LOL I like to say that actors are not the characters IRL, but in her case this is true. She is just like her character in OINTB. I was not even aware of what she said it 😂😂 Lol, now when I will watch the show I will still desping her ahaha so nothing really change
South Texas huh... Yea, Lots of Racist sh#t goes down there  One: I heard these 2 white men (Dad and son) got out of the truck and beat the crap out of this black guy (The dude was just minded his own business, just jogging) after that they shot him and left him for dead. Two: A group of white people deciding to have Antebellum party dressing up as Slave owners
This feels like Crash, but make it horror
PENNSATUCKY NO
im worried abt the black actors in this movie :( like, you'd hope you'd be able to act out what's likely to be pretty personal scenes to you in a safe environment, but considering taryn manning's racism and the general grossness of the way the movie seems to be handling every subject it tries to tackle, i don't think they're gonna get that
Damn the first part of the trailer was perfect then it went wrong
Why does she sound so drunk
*dramatic blackout* “...it’s an A” lmao 😂
This movie feels like it's less talking about racism and more poking fun at it. And not in a 'look at these crazy racist people' type way, but in an 'oh, let's make an overblown racist villain that actually muffles the nuance of racism in general and pretend this is what black people want' type beat.
I hope they just made the movie to mess with Taryn for the cringey social media posts
I feel like... I've seen a video of an actual white woman being racist and calling the cops on a black man for doing nothing where the "karen" in question misused "suspecting" instead of "suspicious" in that manner. I think they're riffing/stealing from that footage, but I can't remember which of the countless videos of "cops being used as weapons by white women" it happened in to pull the receipts.
Nooooooo someone call the manager please 😂
What? Just what?
It's like these people took part of the concept of "Them" by Little Marvin (It's a really great horror show, really recommend it), but it was actually a 13-year-old, white fanfic writer (they've just started writing) who didn't see the show or any actually good horror/thriller movie, who has never written any type of horror at all, and who has just decided to do some very basic research on racism.
I feel like when this concept was written, they had a director like Quentin Tarantino or Jordan Peele in mind, but literally everyone rejected it... some politely, most not. I'm sure the writer tried for years to convince someone to pick up the project, only finding success in their ability to face the harsh criticism with fewer and fewer tears shed. Things were looking grim, and feeling utterly crushed, the writer retired to the nearest dive bar he could find to drown his sorrows. Five shots of bottom shelf whiskey into the night, while venting his frustration to a bartender who was only half listening, he hopelessly cried out, "Won't ANYONE direct my film?!" And lo, from the back of the bar, emerging from a thick haze of English Leather and Davidoff Classics, came a sniffle and a voice that seemed to carry with it all the confidence and strength lost with time in the writer's own expression. "I'll do it!" Out of the fog stepped Coke Johnson or whatever the fuck his name is, clad in a yellowed and battered sherpa denim jacket peppered with ash burns, his untrimmed nostril hairs dusted in white powder and his eyes filled with intense dedication. It was a moment literally everyone in that bar would soon forget, including Coke Johnson, but they'd clumsily written up a contract right there at that table on a stack of partially shredded cocktail napkins and neither one of them realized that probably wasn't legally binding, so the project went ahead.
Born and raised in Georgia, lived there for over 50 years. Never seen a confederate soap dispenser.  Or any such thing.
Karens don't typically cuss, to be fair.
Add my tiktok samgpro
me waiting for D'Angelo to reveal that he made this trailer as a joke and there is still hope in humanity 😭
I did it twice.
talk about getting pigeonholed into a character type.
Why did they have to use such an amazing actor for this part
the actress playing "Karen" is the little weirdo who can't stay out of other people's business in "Orange is the New Black" and she eventually gets her teeth pounded in by the main character during one of the finales.  Good job, casting director!
Tarynn Manning is just continuing her craziness from OITNB
i’m officially a fool
Lmfao did they really make a Katen movie hahaha im here for it
Went to her Insta and...wow is she a Karen for real
I like your work but I cannot watch this trailer
I find it funny that this portrayal of Karens, is not an exaggeration.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_people  Movie is racist.
D'Angelo's narrative makes me feel like I'm not crazy and that there are people who actually get it. Thank goodness. The world is ....something else sometimes
ngl, I thought this was a joke a first 💀
aaaand all her comments on her instagram are turned off lmao wonder why she doesnt want feedback on her role? Almost like she still believes everything she said.... crazy right?
How about. Let the trailer play out first then go over it after.
It's like Get Out, if Get Out was bad and told from the white family's perspective.
taryn manning is such a weird casting choice for this, she doesn’t suit the role at all lol
I have a feeling the Karen actress purposely chose this role as a means of portraying an exaggerated steriotype to backhandedly announce "see, not all of us are like this! this is crazy!" and use ultimately use it to defend herself......."at least im not like THAT!" while still being covertly racist
what…was that
WHY IS SHE ACTUALLY HER CHARACTER IN ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK IN REAL LIFE AND IN THIS KAREN MOVIE WHAT
its a time in the land..smh
D’Angelo looks very pretty everyday
omg the Karen actress was the homophobic religious girl in OITNB
First time seeing the trailer even though I already heard of it but it seems like a fake parody type of trailer for a movie that’s not real even though I know this is not the case because it’s apparently a real movie. Looks so dumb unless it really was just a fake movie trailer
You're a big NO you *N*
Did they really need to make the black guy wear a pan African colored scarf and show Karen has a soap dispenser with a Confederate flag on it?? It's like they're trying to create a fun house mirror version of American culture where people developed extremely divergent racialized tribes. And for that matter, I've never seen a Karen with a Confederate flag. This movie is mixing entirely different phenomenon 🥴🤪
SHES SLEEPING WOTH THE HUSBAND??? BRO WHATNIS GOING ON
How come when she said “suspecting” she looked like Liza Koshi doing that weird face thing she does lol
Taryn deserved way better than this. She's not the best, but she's better than THIS. EDIT: Oop- never mind.
You’re probably as cringy as the movie so 🤷‍♂️ I’m sure you’ll like it
Oh my god not him wearing an African scarf😭 Not that he can’t but it seems like they’re really trying to bring the fact that these are black people home
I was actually shocked there was no representation of the danger of white woman tears, but then I remembered Karen's acting and well.... I can take a guess as to why
Karen's are everywhere
We literally have more than enough movies dealing with black trauma. Please be more creative, put us in space fighting aliens and saving the world, without racism.       # speakinfromtheheartbeeeefletcher
what makes me sad is this movie couldve been really good. i wouldnt have even minded if the acting was terrible if the plot and characters were better
This movie is disgusting. It’s a “get out” rip off. I hope it bombs, it’s just Hollywood jumping on a trend.
This doesn't feel... this feels like just a massive joke.
I already hated the actress who plays Karen here in ‘Orange is the new black’. I thought at the time it’s because her character is so hateable but now I see it’s just her.
OMG the actress playing Karen is the same that played Tiffany Doggett in Orange is the new black 😭😭😭 nooo
The fact he posted this yesterday and it’s already number 13 on trending
Unrealistic, Karen isn't blonde.
im just happy Bee'Angelo is in the vid
You cant convince me that, that trailer wasnt a meme. OMFG
Taryn Manning badly portrayed racism better in Orange is the New Black and in real life than this Karen movie
i swear the meaning of ‘karen’ is just lost wasnt it originally starter packs of ‘middle aged’ ‘owns a minivan’ ‘4 kids’ ‘husband looks like ____’ ‘this haircut’
This movie will do nothing but divide people more.  There is no redeeming quality to it.
She wasnt a good actress on Orange Is the New Black either, idk why but her acting is so annoying.
Her acting is so bad because she was most likely drunk on set given her history and how she refuses to get help for alcohol addiction. Like watch the trailer again and tell me she isn’t blasted the entire time.
My friend shares your first name and he's been training for a year and a half to battle you.  He keeps saying, "there can only be one." Should I get him help???
Wow...this is totally beyond bad and retardily stupid beyond belief! My brain actually hurts now. Damn, did Antifa write this garbage? Or some 900-lbs yoga instructor? If this nonsense doesn't just tell you how irrelevant and woke Hollywood has become that this ACTUALLY had to pass approval by probably a couple hundred people...then you’re even dumber than this movie. Hollywood's put out some pretty insanely cringy movies this last decade, but this just topped them all. Good God!
the film really, really looks like a youtube video
The way Karen talks makes it sound like she came straight out of Shadow the Hedgehog.
WHEN YOU SAID TARYN MANNING I WAS HITTING MYSELF I KNEW SHE LOOKED FAMILIAR!
yesss it was so satisfying when u mentioned get out i was thinking the same
You should sing more
Lmao the subtlety moment got me 😂😂😂
Alright boys, time to head out. Our boy done sold out selling crap to us no one will ever use. But great transition
This concept for a movie is infuriating af..... just no
i think the comment section for the karen trailer was honestly worse… people calling others slurs over… thinking whether or not the trailer was good.
I didn’t expect the trailer to be that bad but... it’s worse.
taryn manning was a bigot in orange is the new black too... maybe this is typecasting
when your name is karen n you’re black... 💀
This feels like a Dharmann movie that no one asked for. Or well, just a Dharmann movie.
No. That’s all.
I'll watch it out of curiosity but I know it's dumb.  Lol, the black women's dialogue " but I'm black " when she replied to the girl , Like what ?! it came across as if she were 10 herself.
NO IM A FOOL
Before you brought it up, I was actually thinking about how this movie wants to be Get Out sooooo badly. It seems like a parody 😒
That really was the smoothest transition into an ad read👏
is.. is the movie not supposed to be some kind of a satire?
Ugh... This movie looks like the worst thing ever! I guarantee you I won't be seeing it! #BLM more than this!
PEPE the motion picture is coming out next.
didn't she play a racist in Orange is the New Black, too?
A Karen comes in all colors, it was never really about race.  A racist Karen is a sub-division of overall Kareness.
Karen went to Hollywood and asked for a manager
What is going onnnnnnnnn what is this timeline pleaseee
I thought it was just a parody trailer, but no. Its an actual movie.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
The Karen I summoned trapped me in the department of management in Hell
I am getting a KFC Lifetime movie vibe.
okay but the karen actress had a racist role in orange is the new black and it was so different from this????
5:50 this really comes across like an SNL sketch that's trying to parody "Get Out" or something, not a real movie  13:05 I mean, it going on for so long doesn't disqualify it from being an SNL skit. But yeah, it does give off that vibe, where the protagonists act like the stuff happening to them is really out of the ordinary and horrifying, but (unfortunately)... their surprised and disbelieving reactions make it really hard to take the film seriously, because it comes off as out-of-touch with real people's experiences with everyday racism.
i want to sell my kidney I am 38 years old my height is 5.10 are blood group b positive If anyone needs please contact i need money very much please
Omg they really got Pennsatucky in this filmmmmm 😩 she needs to fire her agent ASAP for putting her in this dumpster fire of a film. Like, she was so good in OITNB…wtf happened?
No wonder the acting sucks, she's not acting at all
I need to make a movie bout muh racsmisms1
I wish people would realize how sexist the Karen trope is. There are many, many men who act like jackasses, but there's no special word or memes about them, just about the women.
Idk isn’t she Dogget from Orange Is The New Black
13:00  *This tweet needed an interrobang at the end!*
They didn’t even get the hair right…
Legend has it if you say “Karen Character” 3 times while minding your business, one will show up in front of you crying calling the police.
I want a Karen movie where a "Karen" has to work retail and deal with awful costumers after being one herself.
This is the modern Blaxploitation film...
Someone link the new channel! Been trying to sub for weeks, but it won't come up. 😩
ULTIMATE LIGHTSKIN
is it me or does this Coke Daniels individual look like a discounted Sinbad
It would be brilliant, if they add a laugh track to this whole movie
yeah, well, judging by this video, Manning never get out of character after Pennsatucky 😅
What a brilliant actress! Acting like she's acting!! A wonderful performance
Get Out is one my fav movies, I was genuinely shocked by each twist. Sooooooo good. This Karen mess has SNL sketch vibes
Okay so I said Karen character 3 times and I kid you not, the lamp flickered and a lightning striked outside immediately after. There's a huge storm outside so it's not that weird but the timing of this made me nervous tbh 😬
Who wants to bet this film will go down as the worst film ever made
What is your mic
I have the same shirt as you!
Tbh I kinda feel like a true Karen wouldn't call them Black, she'd say "urban" or something.
If you think Karen looks dumb youve never had a white kid friend whos dad was a judge.   Some cop families are really like this.  :D
Karen Character three times fast sounds like "caricature"
sad actually because the Karen actress is a pretty descent actress. she played in orange is the new black and that very good! but i mean i don't know more about the actress privately so it could be that she just fits perfect into Karen lol
Ok but the suspecting bit is because she was supposed to be deliberately making stupid stuff up on the spot so the bad acting is actually because the character is acting. Agreed though, this film shouldn't have been made
The Confederate soap dispenser was the nail in the coffin 😂😂😂😂😂
Can anyone agree D'Angelo is just making another channel to see how many people would actually subscribe without any content and then make a video about how we are all sheep and do as we're told
Wait dangelo is black? I hadn’t noticed
I ain't even know this trailer existed 💀
one pandemic at a time sweetheart
I actually liked the KKKaren actress in Orange is the New Black. I wonder what made her take on this role 🙄
You set us up and we're not mad
Oh my god please read this to the end. In the middle of this video I got an ad for the sims 4 on sale for $5 so I had to go and get it, of course. But then right before I bought it I was like wait shit I don’t have a computer. And I’ve been meaning to buy a computer since I got my stimulus but haven’t gotten around to it. So I just went on eBay and found a computer and bought it. I then bought the sims 4 game. Then I went to Amazon to look at cases. I proceeded to argue with myself over whether or not I needed a case. I decided I do not. So I came back here and closed the ad, having completely forgotten what video I was watching, and now here we are.
Wait this is a wanna be a horror movie?
That's the girl from Orange is the new Black portraying Karen!  OMG!
It's like a , "Lakeview Terrace" parody. I can't believe that's Taryn Manning 😞
I'm already laughing and I only got to the part, where the director's previous works were listed. This gotta be good.
this actress was actually REALLY good in orange is the new black but here its weird?? I don’t know if it’s because of how its produced or something but I’m confused
I looked at the trailer thinking it'd be a parody but it's just... a whole lot of nothing 🤢 which is somehow worse??
This movie is designed to enable racism from black people to white people. Too bad none of you are smart enough to rise above it. Enjoy your paid promotion
This video would go a whole lot better if you didn't talk so much!
One is stuck playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
i didn't watch all 7 seasons of orange is the new black for her to become a Karen
Sad thing Taryn Manning is an excellent actress. She made no effort because she knew this is pure garbage. You want to see her play an actual scary racist, watch Orange Is the New Black, she's terrifying as Pensastucky.
“Like” for summoning Karen with the summoning chant.
The lady they chose idk why but just seems to play up this weird facial expression the whole time
That ad transition sent me into a coma
I get that it is a parody, but it seems like it tries taking itself too seriously, which is a problem if you want to make an ironic comedy.
I think it's a joke or something??? But the trailer doesn't really... do a great job at showing that?  Edit: no, no it's real. fml. You can _smell_ the old white people in a board meeting in this one
I'm constipated rn
Omg when you tried to figure out that note on the piano, I passed tf out 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
i’m so confused at why they used Taryn Manning. like she plays a weird hick country bumpkin in everything else. that is not the stereotypical Karen
If you heard the noise I made when I heard the term "Glockumentary" you probably would've called an ambulance.
How did Tiff from Orange Is The New Black end up doing some shit like this
I almost feel bad for asking you to go through the torture of watching and reacting to the actual movie but, I also know it'd be hilarious!
This.. the Trailer.. I couldn't even watch it, even just the few bits. It's SO BAD!!! I think larping really describes it best. You can literally feel the privilege leaking out of the writing for this movie. You just know someone who has no experience with racism and never did any research on it (you'd have to do that as a white person and if you're really interested in a good movie consult some poc to look over the script)
Nice, you’re on “trending”
Is that the girl from 8 mile😳...I...l can't.
they watched Jordan Peele's movies and then proceeded to be the Tethered version of him lmao
You should probably look up some videos on how solar systems, star and planet creation work.  Pro Tip- It wasn't some imaginary "god" made up by old men who didn't understand science thousands of years ago LOL
This is get out if get out was written by the white girl at your high school that just learned about racism and thinks she can solve it by herself.
This reminds me of a bill burr skit from like 10 years ago.. “How many of those white people are evil movies are they gonna make?”
Is this necessary? For entertainment? Why?
she looks sort of like bill hader??
How did she go from orange is the new black to this?
What in the fuck
🧠🧠🧠🍀🍀🍀🌼
NOT THE "I have black friends, so I'm not racist", LMAO
STOP PRODUCTIONNN
Lady who plays Karen is the crazy chick from Orange is the New Black. She was a racist in that also. White supremacists in that.
the karen actress portrayed a racist roll in orange is the new black
A major problem with this sort of cartoonish, unsubtle depiction of racism is how it gives so-called 'woke' people a pass for their more subtle and pervasive type of racism. It leads to people confusing the stereotypical trappings of racism with racism itself. Someone might watch this movie and think, 'well I don't have confederate flags on my soap dispensers, so I'm not really a part of the problem.' But I would argue that the culmination of everyone's implicit bias is the larger issue than over-the-top 'Karens' when talking about systemic racism.
Glad it’s set in Atlanta, because Georgia is a racist cesspool . Speaking of pools, there’s an All White pool right down the street from my house. No kidding- in 2021.
Me: "I don't know how race relations can get worse in this country." BET: "Well then do we have a surprise for you!"
I don't ever make comments, but i just wanted to say i really enjoy your content! Its really well done! Keep it up!:)
Straight to video and marked a $1 in the Walmart bin- hopefully someone will do everyone a favor and just move it to the trash - why not spend the money making a movie that recognizes racism in depth and empowers those in the fight against it
6:04 sus
Movie looks dope🤣🤣 u have No sense of humor cause ur a Karen....
D’Angelo trending????? YES SIRRR
Ur new channel isn't coming up for me and I used caps
This is……stupid lol
The woke movement is creating Karens and moving them to a neighborhood near you
The only horror about that movie is Karen’s gigantic forehead.
you played yourself. I was able to successfully unfool myself by saying it 3x
(2 months into future)  Rotten Tomatoes: "Certified rotten".  Karen: "I need to speak to the manager."
That’s a trailer? Bruh I thought it was the movie. I agree with everything you said, D’Angelo.
Omg the part about the soap dispensers. Of course they did 😂😂😂 can confirm. I also live in Texas ha
Isn’t that that girl from OITNB?
" I mean they couldn't tell from the first interaction
i can't wait for SNL to parody this by just airing this trailer
the fact that ppl take time out of their miserable lives to dislike a vid is embarrassing
Is that Taryn Manning?
why do i wanna see this...
I am at 5:25 of the video and honestly I think it's actually a horror movie I am expecting her head to turn around her body hover in the air and she chasing them screaming "Let me talk to your manager" I honestly expect this to happen 😅
12 ON TRENDING, LETS GO!
It’s pure propaganda lmao
Bad things happen to people who don’t comply oh my God
I just can’t! I can’t!!! It’s just garbage!!!
All week...? This was the smoothest transition I've seen made, EVER. Usually you can see the ad-reads coming, but ya got me. I was so impressed, I didn't even skip through it.
I did, I guess I'm a fool D: noooo
I mean racism is not always hard-core the subtle racism bothers me most because you don’t really recognize it.
That Karen's foundation is bugging me, it's like they caked it on
Plot twist: this movie is actually very clever because it’s so bad it’s united people of all races to hate on it. Nothing brings people together than a mutual resentment of a person/ thing
FUCK. I SUMMONED HER
Definitely won't be watching this movie...Horrible.
Honestly it looks like they made the trailer with the iMovie horror format. It’s even got the default music and credits font.
She was Pennsatucky in Orange is the New Black and she was soooo amazing, this is disappointing… Her acting is sooo cheeks
i will admit, that transition into the sponsor was immaculate
It's more interesting to be critical on a (hidden) bad movie that is well received. Criticizing bad movies which are obviously bad is not as interesting in my opinion. Other than that i like your videos
That was not the smoothest transition into an ad-read I’ve seen all week. That was just the smoothest one. Period.
I thought you said today's video wasn't depressing? lol Not exactly what I expected, but I'm happy for any content
I feel like u kept missing the point. Like some of this was somehow going over your head, which is crazy cuz ur like one of the smartest ppl on this platform. Maybe u were missing some of the references and how its showcasing the Karen hypocrisy because you were blinded by ur initial dislike for the premise. Its an annoying premise for sure but some of it is pretty realistic in how this shit goes down in real life. Racism frequently takes form in micro-aggressions and ignorant entitlement and corruption. Also no part of this resembles jordan peele's work. Wtf r yall talking about? Lol.
Black people: suffering Racists: Let's make a movie to give Blacks Something to feel seen by, A Karen Movie. Yep. Nothing wrong with this idea. It's GREAT. Black People:
lmao the fact the main actress, taryn played pennsatucky in orange is the new black and then went on to play karen is just...i refuse to believe sorry i cant get over the emotions that pennsatucky's death had on me :((
But like... what if all of the footage for the trailer is B role so people will think it's bad, but go see it anyways because they think they'll be able to point to it and say: yeah, see, racism isn't that bad. And then when they actually go see it, it shows the harsh realities of racism and has a deep message and is good... Never gonna happen, but it would explain the lack of swearing--they really want those far right, "Christian" Karens to go watch this movie. lol
The spot on, grade A, uncut sarcasm is why i come here... and I am pleased. Thank u
King finally posted!
This is worse than dharmann acting.
4:12 I wholeheartedly believe this would make the movie better, not even joking. I’m not a POC, I can’t call myself an expert on this in any way, but if u want to portray how damaging racism can b in an unadulterated manner, this is an option u have at ur disposal.
Ok she also starred in hustle and flow I don’t think she’s racist this was her way to honor to  something
You're on my trending page D'Angelo 🥰🥰 congrats
They should have casted you.
I feel like a Karen movie could possibly only work if it was aimed as a joke movie. Like if we follow the Karen's life and the movie would showcase how dumb she is in her everyday interactions. Or... you know... maybe no Karen movie at all 😆
There actually could’ve been potential for the theme and could’ve been similar to “Get Out” but the overall execution was terrible.
Me watching this: Wow, that Karen looks like Taryn Manning from Orange is the New Black and Hustle & Flow. *Checks IMDB* OH 😐
What annoys me is this could be a decent movie with a competent director. The premise: A black family moves into a white neighborhood. Their neighbor is a nice white woman. Then, plot twist she's super racist and works with her cop brother to frame the teenage black guy for something. Things go sideways, blood, gore, horror, etc. That's a workable script. But this? This???
Sad thing is, so many white women are going to get offended and be outraged by this movie.
Things like this just pave way for people who deny the existence of other forms of racism, thinking, "I don't act like this, so you can't say I'm racist!"
no captions are available :/
This is a joke 🤣 I can't take the trailer seriously
Good ol BET, they never do us wrong 😂
Taryn Mannings commentary on this role "I felt a social responsibility to take on this role" 🤔 discuss....
If you really had a problem with corporate America marketing and gearing their products around a socio-political ideal, then just say so. They listen to the masses, so much so that the power of suggestion is all it takes to overhaul an entire company. Injustice, or the inclusion of acts under the expanded definition, have never been better for business. You don’t buy a can of coke ( why would you anyway), you now buy the idea that Coca Cola is a force of good in the world. 2, Two separate markets, two separate products. What they manufacture, and their company’s public perception. Be careful what you’re buying and who you’re praising, 90% or more probably of the companies who are involved in the social justice game are only doing it to survive and to make more money. Some producers in Hollywood decided to throw a bunch of money at the issues and then create a script because it was popular. Don’t fall for the psuedo-messaging and all the praise, it’s kind of diabolical what’s happening broadly
I thought the movie was going to be a comedy that follows a ‘Karen’ around her daily life. Which, would have been way better. Would still probably be a trash comedy, but better than this.
she was sooo good in oitnb - disappointed but not surprised to find out she's a trumpet.
Is anyone gonna talk about how this trailer looks like was made with iMovie?
this has to be a satire. no way they're putting this out as an actual horror movie. this gives off walmart version scary movie 3 vibes
Well that was a downgrade from oitnb
This definitely looks like a YouTube parody right
*In Molly Weasley's voice* WHERE. HAVE. YOU. BEEN        This is a joke, everyone, all youtubers are entitled to their breaks
This has "fixed it" art vibes.
LMaooo
Oh gods of course Taryn is an "I have black friends" type of person
A Confederate Flag on her soap dispenser?? 😆
Bruh this trailer is full of bias bs
Hey Dange, I have a black postal delivery worker who has moved into my locale of rural Gloucestershire from South London and he cant stop enthusing about how pretty and calm it is round here, and how much he loves my garden, so any theory that black people are gonna turn your idyllic neighbourhood into a trash ghetto is absolute bullshit. He's not the only POC who loves green and peaceful places, I have worked with an ex gang member who started a gardening club for youths in London and its glorious!
“Acting is just larping on a budget.”  Why are you booing him? He’s right!
this trailer just looks and feels like an snl sketch, i really think it's just an elaborate prank and there isn't an actual karen movie baing made cause this is so goofy
Oh no not tucky
Ok, I'll be honest. This Karen thing is starting to get really misogynistic.
Oh isnt it the orange is the New Black actress?
I mean we all saw this coming right???
Is that Pennsatucky???
bae
i love you
The core concept is not all that bad, the execution is horrible. Just imagine if it was made by the same creators of Get Out
I think it would be not bad if it was a comedy movie
Somebody being a racist isn’t being a “karen 🤪🤪🤪”. It’s being a racist.
Wow. This is the first time I've watched one of your videos. Glad I did. Thanks.
Karen stopped being funny when sexist started using it.
No joke, taryn manning probably took the job so she could say racist shit without consequences. The shit acting probably has more to do the script and writing then it does the actors
“They whitewashed racism” PLS😭😭😭
Can't wait to see all the white racist at the movies.  Just, saying all the seats will be filled, I'm not going.
This movie is going to be the biggest failure since the war on drugs.
Almost as offensive as your view of your fellow Americans
it feels like a giant parody...
this looks like the crappy movies my mom watches, she's probably gonna watch this too lol
Wow the new channel got 100k subs congrats! Does that mean you can get a silver YT Button, for a channel with zero uploads?
I don’t actually believe the acting is as bad as being described. Does it look so ridiculously cheesy? Yes! But that’s exactly how ridiculous and fake the ACTING is when Karen’s in real life pretend to be so afraid of whoever their target is that day while they call 911. Taryn was in OITNB and her acting there vs here I think really backs this up. Also, I hope she’s not a Karen in real life but it seems she’s at least a bit crappy :/
D'Angelo speaks the words of uncle Iroh.
i could be very wrong and looking too deep into this, but in the trailer where they show the words "KAREN" the blood dripping down the 'K' looks a bit noose-ish o.o I could be wrong though idk
Not Pensatucky from orange is the new black 😭😂
*Sorry, I just really need help now more than ever. 🙏 Got a spare $1? No opportunities outside due to constant lockdowns in our country.* 😷 Been trying to save for a laptop (homejob), but now need help for me to put food on the table. I'm not a bad person, just a desperate breadwinner. Lost a lot since 2020. 😢   *Prayers and well-wishes are also very much appreciated. 😇*   Off-topic, I know... I hope you understand the desperation.  I know some people need more help than me and my family but I do hope that does not invalidate my cry for help. 😔    Things are getting worse here. *We don't have stimulus checks or anything like USA.* So I'm just really doing whatever I can to put food on the table. We may not be killed by the virus but the situation is surely slowly killing us. 💔    *Peace be with you. GOD bless you always. 🙏*   *To anyone who's struggling, let's hold on tight. All will soon be well. ❤*
So BET just got white washed, racism gets white washed and now white people can feel comfortable saying, "I don't act like that to black people. We have a lame movie spend with over a million dollar budget while this money can go to the black community.  Black people are always thrown under the bus for entertainment. They don't care about how they view us in the movie or what negative role we play that is degrading our race or with people who do so.  BET just stop, cut the cameras.
Ily
They did Taryn Manning so fucking dirty
I know it doesn’t need to be said but that ad read was smooth af lol
Honestly I think it's a good concept but it seems so tuned down that it's laughable. You could make a really great horror film and probably even find a true story to base it off of
Worst film EVER?
This movie makes a mockery of the struggle people face because of racism. I can't believe this got approved to be made. 🤦‍♀️
0:54 "as a black people in america" yes I am a black people now not person people
Ohhh no. I like that actress in orange is the new black.
Lol I thought this shit was fake. Incredible.
Why tf is his voice so....chill🤤🤤🤤
NOT THE SOAP DISPENSER WITH A CONFEDERATE FLAG
Idk. I just think this movie is potentially beneficial to white people to make them conscious of how subtle racism can be.
I really dont know how to feel about the actress, I know her from OITNB and this is a glow down...
If you show this video without sound to anyone then anybody can think he is a girl.. Cuz I thought that when I didn't put my head phone on 😂
https://youtu.be/iV0ZIgPPB14
https://youtu.be/iV0ZIgPPB14
Omg I died at your comment on confederate flag soap dispensers
COVER BRITNEY SPEARS’ COURT HEARING SPEACH NEXT!!! please and thank you. 🙏🏻
at first i thought karen was played by reese witherspoon 💀💀💀
...not Tiffany from OITNB playing main lead in this
Fun fact(?) I straight up live two blocks away from a street called Karen Ave. and it makes me just a bit nervous every time I walk past...
How do you go from being one of the big characters in OITNB to playing a Karen character and still coming off as though your character is a Meth addict.
i really liked the karen actor in orange is the new black so it's sad to see her in such role
Why does it feel like a PSA movie that's shown in school
YOURE TRENDING BABE
Watching this trailer makes me think no script was written and they just improvised it all...😳😂
oh god the noose that comes down in the middle of the K at the end of the trailer i cannot
i thought youd make a video about shannon
It's literally just a dhar mann video but with a higher budget
This feels like a what would you do bit
How disappointing, the "Karen" actress I adore in "Orange is the New Black". It makes me wonder how the cast members felt about her political comments.
Your comment that it sounds like it was written by an AI that was only fed the captions of black squares posted by non-black people is DEAD ON.
is that "karen" from oranage is the new black?
Julie Nolke's transition to her sponsor was the smoothest ever this week, sorryy
Julie Nolke's transition to her sponsor was the smoothest ever this week, sorryy
Me saying Karen Character 3x times fast 😳 it sounded like cklkltcktrlclthr 😂
This is really funny partially because Taryn Manning is CAPABLE of playing a Karen-type character (orange is the new black) on top of being one in real life.
The fact they paid an actual racist to be in a movie about racism is peak modern america
The movie looks like something dahr mann would make
Peele would’ve done this better. Actually, he already has 😂
By the end of the video it hit me that it was a real "serious" movie, I thought it was some kind of parody
Thus movie is gonna faceplate into a cactus, but can we appreciate that adread transition???
Karen is a racist term why if i called a black woman felicia it would be
Wait is this Tiffany from OITNB??
I've been awake for like an hour and I think I've reached my cringe limit for the day. I honestly don't think I could have finished this trailer without D'Angelo's commentary. Movie theatres have been closed for over a year where I am and this is what we're reopening to?
It's an A!  D'Angelo just solved all the world's problems and I can move on with my life!!
i was about to comment about how taryn manning is actually a good actress so her bad acting might be due to bad directing, and then i saw the q anon thing and her “look, i have black friends” post… disappointed
Gotta love that segue into his sponsor.
the karen actress was good in orange is the new black, so im not sure what she's doing here
“Now did the neighbors have confederate flag soap dispensers? Yes. They did. I live in texas. South texas.”  PLS SO DO I IM SCREAMING ITS T TRU E
Noooo 😭 the ignorance
I thought FOR SURE it had to be another Peele movie so I was alright with it. Now I’m just grossed out. 🤢🤮
Not the Karen movie 💀💀
The woman who plays Karen was in orange is the new black lol
the karen actor is literally in orange is the new black, why is she acting so weird in this. why did she even accept this role LMFAO
this trailer is like a dhar mann video, but way worse
that's the one woman from OITNB 😭
Thus could've been done right...but casting is EVERYTHING! I love the chick from OITNB but shes not right for the part. Her voice alone wouldn't work in a film like this.
I'm ded! "You're a fool." 😭😂🤣
Tbh east texas isnt much better :/
The girl playing the Karen is the actress who played Pensatucky (can't spell it right) in Orange is the new black. Fitting I guess ?
A professional indeed.
I mean she really is just a racist though she was a hardcore Trump supporter and believes in Qanon bull...so.... The role actually fits her perfectly so that's the disappointing part
Pennsatucky cut it out!
The first upload since i started following 🙌🏽
See I don't get why this movie needs to exist, because this is just real life that you can easily find a story like this
How about you shut the fuck up and play the trailer all the way through and them commentary.
Who else thought the thumbnail woman was old Veronica from Riverdale, given that the show is cray cray enough to do this too
pennsatucky really went downhill after orange is the new black huh 😔
Gay
Me yelling out “Karen” like 5 times 🤡😭
Isn’t karen from orange is the new black?
White people are the only ones whos really argue if racism exists or not. I dont blame them. Theyve never experienced jack shit
I think people are looking to deep. It shows how RIDICULOUS they "Karen's" are to act the way they do. Yes, it'd laughable yet it exists. So, while this movie is completely ridiculous it's exactly the point that it exists...duhhhh!!!!! And as they would say...you are soooo articulate, where did you go to school???
The trailer had me so HEATED! Like I love Taryn Manning but she embodied this roll waaaay too well. Hopefully some real Karen's see this and realize how rediculous they are.
The stain on his collar is making my OCD act up
12 on trending yay
When I saw the trailer I thought it was a SNL sketch
This gives me one of those Dhar mann rip off youtube video lol
to think that the lead actress is part of the legendary oitnb
ok but her character in oitnb was also a racist... do i see a pattern here?
AHHHH I SUMMONED HER
A Confederate flag soap dispenser? A CONFEDERATE FLAG SOAP DISPENSER?! WHAT THE ACTUAL-
SNL😐
wait, Soros, like in György/George Soros? I'm from Hungary, and honestly, this post felt like home to me XD
see my question is who is this movie for? cause black people have to live this everyday and it's unpleasant to say the least, so without any nuance or entertainment why would they want to watch this? to me it reads as being made for white people to watch and pat themselves on the back for not being like that, which is so fucking gross 1) cause it's turning black suffering into spectacle for white people and 2) it puts the bar so fucking low that it's going to discourage white people from really being critical of their own behavior and being actively anti-racist
bro is that pennsatuckey from oitnb....
Coke Daniels  Who Made the Potatoe Salad? (2006)  Gangsta Rap: The Glockumentary (2007)  Busted (2009)  Highway (2012)  Parking Lot Pimpin' (2013)  Hollywont (2013)  His, Hers & the Truth (2019)  Fruits of the Heart (2021)  Karen (2021)     With creepy main actress from the lack right
omg wait the karen is from orange is the new black
Tia or Tameras husband is in this 🤣
Why is Doggett from Orange is the New Black in this 😆
I haven't seen a single Black person have a positive impression of this trailer. Why was this movie made??? 😅
Isn't that the Kentucky crackhead from OITNB?
Okay, I was gonna ask why Taryn Manning is in this film, but after seeing those Instagram posts and... Yeah, makes sense. I wasn't aware of those, but in my defense, I haven't seen her in anything since Crossroads with Britney Spears and Zoe Saldana.  As bad as this movie looks, though, it's going to be watched by so many people, and it'll be trending on Twitter because everyone's going to want to talk about it and meme the shit out of it. Kind of like Sharknado, only that one never took itself seriously and leaned into the ridiculousness (maybe even too much) of it.
bad mo ie
SUBBED🙌🏻 so proud to be apart of your world domination
Why did Taryn manning decide to do this crap movie
when I first watched this trailer, I was so sure it was a snl skit
D'Angelo: stares at camera "It's an A."  Me: LMAO *dies*
3:31 this is me waiting for my bf to tell me what he thinks about my food that i made for him.
This movie's understanding of racism: 1) She doesn't like black people 2) She doesn't like you, because you're black 3) Racist soap
DUDE YOU LOST ME ON THE COMMENTS ABOUT BLM WITHOUT MENTIONING ANTIFA. AND THE RIOTS.
Ugh I needed to laugh at this today ty ty so much
bruhhhhh wtf pennsatucky from orange is the new black is a q nut????????
The last tweet came across as low key racist tho… and I just looked up the persons Twitter account and they are low key racist lol.
The Karen actress was in orange is the new black and she was pretty good in it. Idk what happened to her acting skills
the fact that the trailer ended with “bad things happen to people who don’t comply” i think sends the opposite message than what they’re trying to send. bad vibes only and also ending on that sorta statement makes it seem like it’s in support of this bs shown in the trailer and not against it like a normal person
but like when he calls himself “insanely attractive” i’m like “yes. that would be correct”
its giving black trauma glorification to to non-black audiences which is very weird
this movie is also directed by a black man. cringe
I'm sorry but the smoothest ad read transition I've seen all week is Dylanisintrouble making in-"audible" wolf noises on his teen wolf video... this was #2 tho.
Thought she did a good job in orange is the new black but omg that post she made is so gross- she typed that with all her being
Imma be real, I only said "Karen Character" twice because as soon as I finished the second time, I was like "if I say this anymore imma die here."
someone took time and spent money to make this movie happen and that knowledge makes me so unbelievably sad and takes 10 years off of my lifespan.
Very sad to see Pensatucky become a Karen after she got clean from meth and passed her GED exam T__T
glad to see you upload again! hope you've been well, banger video as always
I think the "heck" thing is because white moms HATE cursing like so much like I cant even say shut up in my aunts house its shitty but at least that bit is realistic
“Blaxploitation is an ethnic subgenre of the exploitation film that emerged in the United States during the early 1970s. The term, a portmanteau of the words “black,” and “exploitation,” was coined in August 1972 by Junius Griffin, then president of the Beverly Hills-Hollywood NAACP branch. He so named it because he claimed the genre was “proliferating offenses” to the black community in its perpetuation of stereotypical characters often involved in criminal activity.[1] However, the genre does rank among the first in which black characters and communities are the heroes and subjects of film and television, rather than sidekicks, villains, or victims of brutality.[2] The genre's inception coincides with the rethinking of race relations in the 1970s”   Wikipedia
They could’ve gotten me to write the script it would’ve been better than this
Why I'm always reading Karen as kraken?
Subscribed! I love your videos!
i genuinely couldn’t tell if karen’s acting was supposed to be an ironic joke or not..
i can't wait to see the marlon wayans parody.
didn't the Karen lady also play a crazy homophobic racist christian in orange is the new black
Is the background music from final fantasy?
I feel like this is something that Shane Dawson would 100% write and execute exactly like this lmao
“as a black people” 💀💀💀 you kill me everytime dude
missed you king 😔👊🏻
I'm glad to see that doggett got work after what happened on orange is the new black
I think the two statements "Taryn is racist and spreading racist conspiracy theories in the name of politeness and God" and "Taryn doesn't believe a word shes saying in the movie Karen because she truly doesn't think she's a racist karen" can both be true at once. In fact it's a perfect illustration of the danger of this movie- making real life "karens" believe they aren't problematic because they don't straight up say "i hate black people". The Karen in the movie is a caricature but Taryn is the reality. Why is that better social commentary than anything actually intended to be depicted in the whole movie?
i literally thought this was a youtube parody not an actual film being made holy shit
I thought this was a joke!
I had chills after i said Karen Character, can i take it back?
I can’t find your 2nd Channel. I typed your name is caps. Help!
It’s Tiffany from orange is the new black
They could've made a Taryn Manning biopic and it would've been the movie they thought they were making
Jesus Tittyjuggling Christ, I didn't know Taryn Manning was actually literally Pennsatucky.
Welcome back d'angelo ❤
The scariest part of the movie is that Karen is a dead meme.
this trailer is so bad it’s giving me so much psychic damage
You would think that the Karen's acting wouldn't be that bad if she is just playing herself irl.
Lol the person who played Karen had a big role in Orange is the new black. She KILLED that Role, lmagian having such a shitty film that you can make actors bad.
I can’t think of her as anyone else other than Doggett from orange is the new black. At least casting was done well again I guess
9:09 felt that
There's so much wrong with this movie that I haven't even seen anyone point out how bad Karen's wig is
9:09 my exact reaction everytime I hear something like that-
When I first heard of the movie, I was actually pretty excited. I like modern/trendy movies and stuff, so I wanted to watch it. After seeing the actual trailer and a justified reaction to it, it just seems like it’s trying and failing to be… whatever it is. I’m still going to watch the movie, but I’m just a little disappointed.
Lmao Taryn Manning isn’t acting
"Acting is just Larping on a budget"  *Looks at cosplay and the costs that have gone into it and silently agrees*
This honestly feels comedic, should definitely be a satirical comedy with social critic stuff.
This is not even an accurate portrayal of an actual Karen. A Karen isn’t specific to just white people though. Every race has their own…..so yeah.
Is the actress for Karen the same bitch from orange is the new black??! The Jesus girl from season one
BRO IS THAT TARYN MANNING AS IN PENNSATUCKY FROM OITNB AHAHH WHAAAAAT
I thought a Karen is someone who DOES NOT comply due to self entitlement, for example not wearing mask
Why... would a movie about racism and how it affects black people in everyday life be called after "the racist character"
honestly im kind of into it. i feel like it might subvert our expectations and be good in a satirical way
You guys are making fun of this but this is the next Get Out.  Mark my words yo! 😂😂😂😂😂
why is the child actress the best one. her face when she said “she doesn’t like you either” was the best performance in the trailer
I'm not sure if d'angelo has talked about the creepy show art drama  But I hope he mentions it
Brandon Roger's did a more accurate portrayal of Karens in one of his recent skits
The film ALMOST has the potential to be something of substance but D is right- they white washed racism into something kooky and teehee and this film is going to cause more harm- if it ever gains traction that is.
"This insanely attractive young man" really got me lol
The sad thing is I get what they're trying to do, it's just not done well. Also I feel some will use this movie to prove racism doesn't exist or something
Taryn Manning also played a racist Christian in OITNB. Maybe it's not acting.
Honestly the world has been going to shit since its creation...so no I'm not surprised at this new fuck up😒
I think it'd be a better movie if it was like Home Alone; The Karen tries to rid her neighbors with filthy tricks, but the neighbors are always a step ahead and the tricks backfire. Eventually Karen tries to have a petition to get rid of the neighbors, but no one signs, leading to Karen doing one last terrible, terrible thing. Then the neighborhood gangs up on her, turns her house into a horror house while she shops (because we know how long it takes when you're a Karen, and make there be clips of her in different stores yelling at the staff) and when she comes home she gets scared out of her wits and leaves. Happily ever after! The neighbors Karen originally targets don't even have to be black; they could have a gay couple or an interracial couple. But I like the idea of the neighbors sticking up for their new neighbors.
God it looks so awful
Maybe….it’s trying to show yt people that shit like this is actually racist. You would be surprised at how many people don’t realize “just comply” or “you people” actually is. I also live in the south. NC to be exact where we have active unmasked Kl@n members 😐
9:31 “…and then cut, with police brutality, and black people crying…” The delivery on the last part made me LOL 😆😆😆
The trailer felt like a parody
Stop I'm screaming "serving my wife divorce papers at 3 am iPhone giveaway" I caaaaaant
What the hell has Pennsatucky become??
Bruh who else tried to figure out what note the piano was playing 🤣
deadass someone from lifetime probably helped with this film.
with her as the lead this isn't a movie this is a documentary
Another side not they should of picked another person to be Karen someone more believable
she looks like chucky
Ok so maybe the plot is off, but the actress from OITNB tho….. making me want to support (Nvm I just finished watching the trailer this needs to go in the bin) (Taryn Manning being racist irl is the worst news I could’ve gotten this year)
My favorite "Karen" was from the series Them - Alison Pill's character, Betty.
ur hair looks so good king
Imagine looking at how fucked up our country is and instead of having anything affirming and supportive to say to Black people, or meaningful to say on white supremacy and the role of white movie makers or average white Americans in that, you instead thought "Let me just copy and paste that into a movie for the money." There's no way these film makers looked at police brutality in America and saw anything but entertainment, and that's the really fucked part of it.
Anime adapted movies are beginning to look more interesting now
Karenply
The fact that they literally named her Karen is super frustrating considering they missed the point of it being a code.
Not dogget as Karen 😂
I’m still at ‘glockumentary” 😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
It looks like they gave freedom to a karen to make a movie about her life...
5:33 Karen: Very suspecting teenagers Teenagers: Suspecting? D'Angelo, watch your own video buddy...yes she meant suspicious.  Go watch Karen videos and see how many times they misuse language. There is plenty to go after with this trailer, you don't have to make stuff up.
Doggette from orange is the New black is Karen and just because you had black friends does not mean you can't be racist 😒unfortunately
Wasn't the Karen actress in orange in the new black or something?
6:36  I felt that💔
I'm happy to see Gretchen Whitmer's film career is off to a good start.
They should pay you for promo, I’m definitely watching this shit now! 😂
Yeah....calling this a Jordan Peele knockoff is generous. All I'm seeing is a blatant cash grab full of bad acting.
Bro, how are you gonna tell me to subscribe to your channel but not link it anywhere?! I can’t find that mf in the search bar. 😭
Yikes 🤣
the reason jordan peele horrors work is because the characters are in horrific situations that are not supposed to look like they could actually happen, but the messages are still based in reality. this movie just took situations that happen all the time and slapped some horror music over it and said “look, a horror movie!”
Oh God this has Lifetime/Hallmark movie energy
Karen’t
Imagine if we put the money we put in for making these shitty films, maybe world humanitarian crisis’s could be helped or even completely solved...nahhh let’s make a movie called “Karen” that will help the people.
Fuck this movie
Wow Karen plays herself in this movie
did the crew really think they would do something with this?
“That Karen actress” DO NOT disrespect Taryn like that!!!
“heated gaming moment level racism” took me out
the literal movie is trash whyyyy whyyyy is it even a thing smh and why do ppl question how racist the south really is? i live in stx also and when ive traveled ppl are still the most racists towards their own kind here, in my hometown ....smh -.-
When you said that everything that happened in the trailer happened to you and your family I stopped in horror and rewatched the whole video. Not that I discovered that those thing happen everyday. Just the idea that you had to go through every single of the thing depicted in it.  Honestly, those kind of testiomy are way more powerful than any Karen movie.
Have you seen Candyman (1992)? The trailer for the remake was just released. It would be cool if you made a video about it. Idk if it’d be a funny video like this lol, but I’d like to know your thoughts. I think it looks really good
What I gathered from the trailer insinuates Karen's are cunning or honestly have any form of "logical" thought process. Karen's are full blown emotion that takes out one of their many awful traits. Racism does not embody them, their obvious privilege does.  This insinuates Karen's are racist to their core when they are privileged to their core, they just perpetuate racism to keep it that way. They are taught racism by family and peers, and it keeps them thriving and they know this to an extent but they act out in cognitive dissonance. This movie insinuates they are just born racist and not enabled which is a bit disturbing.  They are like this because they are encouraged. It is not some type of "phenomenon" its literally a from of social conditioning that white people do to each other that needs to be addressed...and the little girl? Unless her parents herself are telling her this stuff, little kids often don't even recognize race so like that is random.
Please do a review of that potatoe movie😂
Its interesting... but like wtf is this, the karen wasnt like racist Karen's I've experienced, the film doesn't look funny or scary. It just looks meh
Looks like someone saw Get Out and decided to make their version of it
THE PERSON PLAYING KAREN IS A CHARACTER IN ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK NOOOOO
I thought this was supposed to be a comedy movie... yea
the karen is the racist christian methhead from orange is the new black im happy about that
Are Karens really that ubiquitous in America?... damn.
They’re not “making” it, it’s been made. It’s done and already being released. And it’s in such poor taste. Honestly.
i fee like i watched the whole movie lmao
Just glossed over “as a black people in America….” Lmao why did I laugh
I saw this trailer on Twitter and thought it was a parody. I-
Who would watch this shit voluntary
I'm sorry your keyboard must be broken because it's a diminished third above your perfect pitch. How embarrassing.
DAngelo has finally blessed us once again with his beautiful face.
Fun fact: My first grade english teacher told us that we HAVE to spell "potato" as "potatoe" otherwise we would fail the class.🙃
very good to see you again :)
BLACK PEOPLE DIDNT ASK FOR THIS SHIT
Taryn Manning isn't actually acting in this movie, they just paid camera crews to follow her around for a few weeks
I just like that Taryn Manning finally gets to play a middle class person
welcome back <3
“Is that an F sharp?” Me: *Its an A*  D’Angelo: **continues to play the piano** Me: IT’S AN A D’Angelo: *it’s an A* Me: I JUST SAID THAT
Someone decided to make dhar mann's videos into a movie
Pennsatucky is pretty far from the Karen look.
It’s even weirder BET is run by white folks and they thought we’d wanna watch this...
I remember people getting heated at her for posting pictures of her and her cop wife saying "my baby's one of the good ones". yikers
When I saw the confederate flag soap dispenser I SCREAMED 😂
This is terrible
So first he tried knocking off Madea movies now Jordan Peele? Yeah I see this going well...
I just gotta say. This was filmed in Acworth Georgia, my hometown. My parents still live there (we’re white). East Point is my wife’s hometown,  and her parents still live there (they’re black). And yeah, Acworth has had its racist moments, but is consistently growing more diverse every year. The county itself is something like 60% white and 25% black. What I’m saying is, it’s not a perfect town, but the racists there are so much more subtle than this lmao.  Also, the very first line is ‘this is a long way from East Point’ bitch no it’s not, it’s an hour’s drive, tops. East Point is where the airport is, you can go there literally whenever you want.
Well... Taryn Manning is in every dumpster fire movie after OITNB ended, so it doesn't surprise me.
The thing is, they could have actually made this plot useable and engaging but chose not to. I think the actors are poorly chosen, the actress who plays Karen is indeed a good actress but she doesn’t fit the character which is why her performance seems to be so poor. Personally I would have made Karen more intimidating, maybe her hatred for minorities causes her to act out in ways where she deliberately plants them to be as bad people just because of their race and for them to be evicted if not sentenced to jail. A lot of witty and snarky remarks that are targeted against the minorities could be placed which would allow for an interesting script with potential references to current events while actually putting out a statement how minorities such as black people can be easily framed by white privileged people. I think this idea would fit much better to a time of a few decades ago and the title should be renamed as “Karen” sounds comical. Technically, with the right approach you can include comedy as well as very dark elements to develop a well rounded movie.  Overall I think that exploration of prejudice is important and although movies such as this, or even slightly similar already exist, doesn’t mean a director can’t use their imagination to really make it strand out.
Yay ur back
I lost it at the confeferate flag soap dispenser 😂
This just goes to show how stupid the whole Karen meme is. Like sure, there are entitled white women out there who regularly commit microaggressions, but people act like it's them that are mostly responsible for systemic racism and not like the people in power and the structures they created (i.e. the police). And those people are almost exclusively men.  "Karen" really is just a way to scapegoat women for men's racist and general violence. It's pure misogyny, it hides the real issue of racism, and helps no one but white men. I'm sick of it.   Hopefully more people will see this thanks to this movie.
not pennsatucky playing karen Lol
Surprised tbh Manning was really good in OITNB
Its an A😂😂😂
The Facebook group "a group where we all pretend we are karens" is more believable than this shit
His name is coke
I am tired of black trauma be exploited ...this actually disgusting
This is BET movie with an ALL black production crew. They need more white and asians on their crew cause they suck at making racism movies.
Cmon if you are a Karen in real life at least be good at the heccin part. Ive seen karen reaction videos that are reposted that are more interesting than this
Lindsy Lohan????? lmao
i'm not sure if Tarryn Manning's agent really hates her, or she has no agent and she really hates herself... or both. but her movies are terrible and horribly exploitative. like, i actually watched the interpretation of the Ariel Castro kidnappings where she played Michelle Knight, and oh boy... it was so so so so bad.
It would have been way funnier if her name wasn't Karen
the segue to the sponsorship was smoother than a fresh jar of Skippy
Can't believe she doesn't act better in this after her amazing performance in OITNB
My friend showed me the trailer and I LITERALLY THOUGHT IT WAS FAKE HELP-
I thought this was a joke, but no….. it’s real😬
Get Out? Nah, it's Evacuate the Premises
when watching the trailer i thought that depending on whos making it it could be a cash grab and the moment i saw the bet logo i thought yeah... definitely a cash grab
Think I will skip this one
Yikes
that hurt to watch
My mom's name is Karen and she's super bummed about this lol
I honestly thought it was a fake movie...wow.
...wtf was that
Yeah i was gonna say, that smoothness lmao
I'm pretty sure that a fan-made trailer would be much better than the trailer of this movie.
i like the movie karen, i support the movie karen. i shall watch the movie karen
Can somebody tell me what the woman says at 9.05 please? English is not my first language and I always had trouble understanding that actor speaking! Thank you in advance!
The dude at 6:21 looks like Pete Davidson and tyler1 had a kid.
The director clearly didn’t listen in English class. “Show, don’t tell”
The actress who plays Karen was in orange is the new black and did an incredible job in that show… I’m very disappointed in the actress for doing something like this
this movie is for certain types of white people. it's made with no swearing and super obvious with that in mind. If it even changes one person i guess it was worth it.
The name of the channel is *secret* (from his description)
As a person who has lived all over Texas, confederate soap dispensers check out. I drove by a don't tread on me flag, blue flags, and have heard people say, unironically, that if the government wants their guns they'll have to "come and take them".
The Karen actress is from orange is the new black
Coming out in 2022 ... KYLE.... A horror movie about jock type white guys who have bad anger issues and punch holes in the wall to scare his girlfriend only drinks monster or a cold one with the boys and has any other stereotypes you can think of
WAS THAT A NOOSE IN THE K?????
taryn manning also portrayed a racist religious freak in orange is the new black...... what a crazy coincidence
This feels like a SNL skit omfg
This should have been an over-the-top slasher film where she murders coffee shop baristas for the tiniest mistakes and I'm upset that it isn't.
This trailer gives me so much second hand embarrassment dear god
That’s the lady from Orange is the New Black
the “Karen” actress is pretty famous for her role in Orange is the new Black and I’m p sad she ended up in this.
1, smoothest transition to an add reading if I ever did see one! 2, why is saying Karen character 3 times sound like you’re summoning a devil? New 3am challenge lol
“Far from a racist”, big yikes
I really enjoyed Get out, also Antebellum which was a little more in your face but it really impressed me because of that. This “movie” seems to do all the cliches whie copying these movies for an easy money grab. It might have been an interesting concept if done differently but I’m not even sure.
Tarryn acting be very assuming
Orange is the new black is weird now
Okay but who is the target audience?
I’m surprised she did this. She was a character on orange is the new black and some other movies. One with Britney Spears. Lol: can’t believe she did this.
"Acting is just LARPing on a budget"
How did she go from orange is the new Black to this?!??!?!
this has to be a joke what
Darman did the casting
Curious that they never green-light a movie project that meaningfully examines whiteness, The Man, or capitalism.
Welcome back king😌❤️✋
It looks like a failed SNL skit trying to make fun of Jordan Peele knock offs.
Nooooo I summoned her 😂😂😂😂
"As a black people in America"
PLSSS I saw the picture to the trailer in your community post and hopped on the video SO quick because I couldn't believe this is actually real 😭😭😭
hmmm...
This is why anything that becomes mainstream it gets overdone and beating until it has no meaning at all.
Is that the bible chick from orange is the new black playing Karen ?
Karen is really Pennsatucky from oitnb and this all makes me so sad I had no idea about her in general ☹️
I live in Brazil and have already been in homes with confederate flags proudly hanging in them. So taking this global issue and DOING THAT WITH IT???? I hate it so much, can't even laugh at how bad it is
After pensatucky, Karen, 8 Mile and sons of Anatchy I wonder if Taryn Manning is getting a complex from being type cast as terrifying/ignorant capital W white lady.
"what is that? an F#?"  [ one second later ]  "IT'S AN A."
Glad you’re back D’angelo! ❤️
they probs didn't pay her as much as orange is the new black lol
he is absolutely having a podcast in 2022 i’m so ready
Karen is the chick from orange is the new black and I can’t stop seeing her as her character.She was low key hillbilly racist too lol
i heard about this and when i saw the trailer my very first thought was "of COURSE it's taryn manning".
you don’t remember the world being created bc you did create it
so nobodys gna mention that she was in orange is the new black
Why did they do this Taryn Manning????????? I wish she would have turned this down omg
The Trailer is uuhhh.... its uhhhh...........                                              SUS
Isn't she the woman of OITNB? And she was doing just fine, I'm pretty sure it's not the actress that's bad i feel like it was made that bad on purpose 🥲
WB I hope you're feeling better T-T
tell me you didn't understand what Jordan Peele's work is about without telling me you didn't understand what Jordan Peele's work is about
Holy shit, I didn't know about that rant the actress went on. She played a racist character in Orange is the New Black and now I'm wondering if she accepted the role because, if she's gonna be typecast, might as well be as herself.
I tried the Karen Character, I didn't think it'd be so hard to say 🤣
The thing is I really like Taryn Manning’s acting in oitnb and sons of anarchy but in this trailer it’s hot garbage. Maybe it’s the way the trailer is put together 🤷🏾‍♀️
I disagree with some of your points because it seems pretty accurate to Karens irl, but I'm really disappointed to learn that Taryn Manning is a Trump supporter. She was good in OITNB, but I never knew her character was so convincing simply due to the fact that she's so similar to the character irl. 😬
“We’re already in the sunken place” made me snort
Just straight-up, lazy blaxploitation. It's not even cute or goofy - you know what though? If the Wayans do a spoof of this it might actually redeem them as film makers a little bit (so long as they avoid the transphobia this time)
FREE IPHONE GIVEAWAY ACTING. And I’m dead 🤣🤣🤣
You are such a mood  Edit: On a side note, this feels like a My Story Animated movie
Imagine if they saw her page then cast her.
I do gotta say: I feel bad for Taryn Manning being in this. She is legit better than this movie; she played a really convincing racist in OitNB, and here she’s like...a lazy caricature of “Karens”.
I'm so cute I went into the secret channel thinking I'd be in the first thousand to sign up. 🙄😒
Long story short: Yayyyy... Outrage culture...
This is so disappointing. I didn't know about Taryn Manning's dumbass posts before this video, and thought she was cool purely because she was a big character in Orange is the New Black and everyone on that show seems to be a decent person (as far as I know). She played a racist in that too, and now I know she's being typecast in these roles because she actually is a fucking bigot
when d’angelo takes the beanie off 🥵🥵🥵
2:04 sorry i watch dylan is in trouble. You two should have a competition
Am I the only person who is literally sickened by how Hollywood continues to use real life black trauma to make movies? I literally cried so hard when I tried to watch that movie about cops killing black ppl, because I always fear for my brother. These would be great movies, if it didn't glorify what we go through regularly.
It looks like a sketch
Remember in like 2013 when “Karen” was just a mild joke about a certain hairstyle. Now it’s just political name calling to keep the kids engaged
Holy moly, is this a real trailer? It looks like a bad parody... And so disappointed about Taryn Manning, she was such a great actor in Orange Is The New Black, I was definitely not expecting this..... o_O
''RACISM THE MOVIE'' this summerrrrr
I didn't know Taryn posted this on social media however I always found this bih weird
D'Angelo is so pretty
The way she referred to Donald trump by his first name makes me so uncomfortable
Tommy would ve done a much better job playing karen
Marry me.
My head hurts trying to read her Instagram caption
Can someone explain why responding with a childhood photo was the worst way possible? I thought that was kinda cute, but i am superduper white.  If someone cares to teach me,  i would like to understand
D'Angelo can literally wear dad clothes (he's pretty much a flat cap away from dressing like every dad I've met at a barber shop) and still kill it
I clicked on a far right youtuber's coverage of this trailer just to see those predictable comments, some just sound like something the karen character in this movie would say because they got 0 self awareness, i advise against looking those up, but any time badly written and cringy media like this comes to be they'll just use it as an excuse to fear monger about a race war or feel justified in their racism by saying "hollywood is anti-white" or to do "what about the black crime rate" talking point, movies like these only do harm by emboldening people like that until they start to say "actually, white people are the oppressed race in america" But at least they made some headlines, now to get that 9% on rotten tomatoes, it was all worth it
But but Taryn Manning was so good in OITNB..
this feels like someone watched Get Out and thought "hey I can make that except really bad"
WAIT THAT'S TIFFANY (THE CHRISTIAN GIRL FROM ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK)
I thought the trailer was satire 🙃
D’Angelo you are so great but do we HAVE to hate watch the Karen movie cause it’s so terribly awful looking I don’t even hate it. I just don’t care about it AT ALL.
WELCOME BACK HOPE UR DOING BETTER
What the fuck
she looks like the HOA lady from over the hedge
the world is going out sad.
The black community has asked for respect, reform, and reparations and instead we give them a white washed racism movie 🙃😤🤦🏻‍♀️
Is that the reason her acting is so bad? Because she played a really good racist in OITNB… So she was intentionally bad because she knew it would be pretty sus to play multiple racists as well as being called out in real life but still wanted to dollar 🧐
Pennsatucky didn’t learn anything in jail
The acting is pure trash.
So this is why she's so good at playing racists .. all is explained
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT KAREN BEING PENNSATUCKY FROM OITNB?? 😭
That actress has even less facial expression than peak twilight Kristen Stewart. Impressive.
Bummer, I really liked Taryn as Pennsatucky bc she showed great acting and I was thrilled to see her in other stuff but this makes me go "bye forever Girl"...
d'angelo saying "i don't remember when the world was created" as if he's not god
Omg nooo that's the actress who plays Pennsatucky in Orange is the New Black. I loved her in that, that's disappointing that she's a Trump supporter and in this gross movie.
"Serving my wife divorce papers at 3am prank! Free iPhone GIVEAWAY!"  lmao! I just died. You just killed me and now I am a ghost.
Good overview.  I would’ve loved to had seen a in-depth “Karen” movie, but this thing is all just two-dimensional.
I like
At first I was pretty bummed about Manning being ✨like that✨ but then I remembered her character’s name in OITNB was Pennsatucky lol
Are you telling me this movie is not a parody
If anyone else is trying to figure out where they saw the Karen actress, probably Orange is the New Black
but why does the woman on the thumbnail look like a female Ted bundy??
I can't wait for the new channel D'aNgElo WaLlAcE
Omg its the crackhead from OITNB WTF
please show your skincare routine we need to know your skin is glowing
wasnt the karen in orange is the new black?
You are soooo 😂😂😂😂😂
they will take any tik tok trend and make it a movie
Isn't she the meth addict from orange the new black?
This movie looked hilarious up until you revealed Taryn Manning's social media post.
this movie is bad but what makes it i guess... notable is that the tone is confusing. i went in to the trailer fully expecting it to be a comedy because ???? you could obviously make the concept work as a horror movie but why would you call it 'karen'? i was about to say they tried to make a horror movie but it was shit so they gave it a memeable title but they outright named the character 'karen' so i guess at no point was it a serious effort to make a horror movie that was any good, and that's super icky?? i am sure you could make this concept work as a dark comedy, how exactly i am not going to try to guess and it'd be tricky but you could. this is just tonally confusing and yeah is not going to address actual issues all it is going to do was making racism seem like not an issue. the police violence is not systematic, obviously, it's a few bad Racists working as cops and once they get plucked out it's all fine!!!
isn't that the Christian extremist with the fucked up teeth from oitnb?
D'angelo should play static
She just ruined the entire career orange is the new black gave her. Shame. I fuckin loved her acting.
ong is that the christian toothie from orange is the new black?
1:11   god damn it i thought it was an actual scene for like 5 seconds
HELP A KNOCK AT THE DOOR HAPPENED AFTER I SAID KAREN CHARACTER THREE TIMES AND THE SALT ISNT WARDING IT OFF
Fucking finally
This trailer is a damn SCP and I know it!
_✨Racism Lite✨_
That was such a trash trailer 🙃
This movie seems like it's trying to copy the social tension from "get out" and failing miserably because its highlighted in every sentence without subtlety
I don’t think it’s a good idea to have an actual… villain in a movie about racism or social problems in general…It’s just simplifies and undermines the extent of the problem  When watching this thing it’ll look more like “This woman is evil and a problem” than “this real common baseless belief made out of selfishness and projection over hundreds of years is scary and ruining lives” Maybe even that would be simplified
Holy shit is that Pennsitucky???????
the karen actress also played a crazy christian character in orange is the new black   (i’m not saying every christian is bad of crazy, i respect it and you should believe what you want to but the show portrayed her as crazy)
The woman playing the Karen was a great actor in orange is the new black. Not so much here. At all.
Basically, "Whitewashed racism turns into Get Out, filmed like a vine compilation and with acting worse than youtube kids content"
Tiffiany doggett did not deserve to die just to come back and be in this movie
I thought I was dreaming or high, but nope it's actually a real trailer 🤯
yOU TRICKED ME INTO SUMMONING HER????
I seriously thought the trailer was just a spoof and not a real thing
so this is where Pennsatucky went
when i saw this on the community tab i honestly thought it was a parody but the fact this is a fully funded feature length movie is making my brain feel like i just put a fork in the power outlet
The title of the movie alone sounds like it's made by a bunch of middle schoolers
This movie looks so silly, and more like a comedy than anything else.
Is that pennsatucky as karen
Wow you’ve blown up 🤩
Am i the only one who thinks this movie is kind of a parody? About racists, karens and horror movies?
no but let’s get into how smooth the ad transition was in the beginning👏🏾
Can we appreciate the fit? D'angelo looks great in that polo and that gray beanie ✨
Dora looking ass telling me to try it. I am a fool tho lol
D’Angelo, you really outdid yourself with that ad read.. *chefs kiss* Really got us good
Isn’t she from orange is the new black
I hate watching a movie & I can actually tell that people are acting… I’m w D, this looks like YT acting
what the actual fuck is this trash 💀💀
This movie is the wallmart get out
Taryn Manning did such a great job as Tiffany "Pennsatucky" Doggett on Orange is the New Black. But I also just read that she's an alcoholic and they had a lot of issues with her not showing up to work, almost fired her, and she refused to go to rehab. I guess this is the kind of garbage stuff you're stuck doing when you're not reliable to work with. It's so sad because she's a really good actress. It's like Lindsay Lohan.  And now I'm at the part where you revealed Taryn Manning is a Qult Trumper. Yikes. Nevermind, I don't care about her acting abilities anymore. She's probably doing such a bad job and messing up her lines because she's drunk.  I agree that Karen is just a horrible Lifetime-esque movie/SNL skit really derivative of Get Out, a movie that's actually good.
The most painful part is the Karen actress absolutely SLAYED in Orange is the New black - like she's a good actor, she seemed like a good actor, how the feck she ended up here
The fact that Karen is actually a Karen 😪
the trailer is so damn                        trash
So having black friends is racist?
The actress was in OITNB
She is the girl from Orange is the new black and she is racist in that show as well
Oh gosh is that the actress from Orange is the New Black????
i'm just over here wondering how desperate you have to be for an acting job that you're willing to be in this
Taryn combining antisemitism and racism and then getting this movie role.
So surprised by Taryn. I thought she was amazing in Orange is the New Black
Isn't she the hillbilly character from Orange is the New Black?
I couldn't say it 3 times fast and now I'm a fool twice
Karen movie? Are you kidding me??
Tbh the biggest bummer about this is the fact that the concept had potential. Imagine a Karen horror movie thats a semi-satirical social commentary like Get Out or Do the Right Thing (which isn't a horror movie but I think it does a good job of using absurdity and exaggeration to portray racial stereotypes while bringing gravity to the way it shows police brutality and racially motivated violence) They should have just let Jordan Peele or Spike Lee make this lol
I'm pretty sure the suspecting line is meant to make her look stupid- Karen's in videos do often use words incorrectly.
Isn't the Karen actress in Orange is the new Black??
The makers of this film do not understand what a Karen is.  It is a state of mind.  It is the place where entitlement, stupidity and delusion crash together as a personality disorder.  Anyone with these attributes can be a Karen.  Anyone.
Could it be that the woke racism is meant to portray super passive aggressive Karens?
yo is that pennsatucky from oitnb
I hate boomers trying to capitalize off internet culture
This feels like a bad SNL skit
that movie is pure propaganda if you ask me
Wait that’s the actress that plays pennsatucky on oitnb
We already had Karen in cinema - the stepmother of Cindrella
It NEEDS TO BE A MOVIE BECAUSE... B.E.T.... "Blacks Exploited on Telivision"
It's the chosen one  He's back yall
I was thinking that I knew that 'Karen' actress but I couldn't figure out where from... then it hit me, orange is the new black!
NOT PENNSATUCKY BEING KAREN
It's Taryn Manning!? really loved her as Doggett in Orange is the new black
Oh he is good. Best transition to an add in the game
FUDGING B.E.T!!!! I should have knoooowwwwn!!!! *screams into the void*
So, they are doing the silent confession part willingly…?
You know the movie has missed the mark when it takes you to the literal last sentence of the trailer to figure out it’s supposed to be a horror film. “Karen” popped up at the last panel and I said, out loud, “Wait is this actually *supposed* to be a horror film?” I legitimately thought all the music and stuff was just bad/amateurish editing decisions for a suspense-drama.
There is absolutely no way that this isn’t a SNL sketch
Yay, he's back!
Anyone who believes anything from QAn*n is most definitely a Karen. Wouldn’t be surprised if she was at the insurrection!
Why isnt she blonde
D'ANGELO not fixing his hair falling in his eye while doing the promotions is so out of character. HE ALWAYS FIXES HIS HAIR A LIL.
Potatoe is the older spelling of potato. In fact, it may betray my age, but I still instinctively spell it that way and I get confused when Grammarly has a hissy fit over it.
Wait is that… Pennsatucky from orange is the new black?! Wtf went wrong with her
I watched the trailer before this video and was so confused on whether  it was an SNL skit or an actual more that will be released on streaming services 💀
I hate how I share a name with a cpr dummy lookalike whose in a movie thats bootleg get out
The way that Taryn Manning was in Orange is the New Black, working with such a diverse cast and performing such a good role just to end up here.. giiiirllll
This was made by someone in 2070 that only had access to old tiktoks….
I feel like this movie may start a cult following just because of how bad it's gonna be.
i really thought you're a girl in the thumbnail
The worst part is: It actually seems like a pretty good quality production. Just thinking about how much money was thrown into the trash because of this garbage fire is astonishing
This literally looks like a joke or an snl skit.
1980: We're gonna have flying cars in the future! 2021:
And the fact that they got Cory hardrict to play in this pisses me off cause he's actually a really good actor! This Movie is proof that sometimes you're not a bad actor the script is just awful!
I actually knew a karen called Karen…and i mean major karen every stereotype you can think of (although she never said anything racist but i wouldn’t put it past her)
This director should not make anymore movies.
im glad that theres rep for police brutality and black discrimination, but karen is peformative bullshit for a quick cash grab so far
I think playing her character in Orange is the New Black really got to Taryn.
Any other retail workers out there getting annoyed at the appropriation of the Karen term by people who have clearly never worked retail/service industry and dealt with actual Karens
When you ask wealthy privileged minorities to address "racism"? Well, what do you expect...  Why not just ask Obama about it? Pull your pants up!
108k when I subscribed.
I am upset for all the brilliant artists in the world who didn't get funding for their projects, when this did...
See that's why I did not say "Karen Character" 3 times I am not having  no spirit of Karen pop up in my house, no thank you.
im still waiting for someone to call it a parody
That actress is kind of giving me darkest timeline Leslie Knope
To me, they really thought it was gonna be an easy success because "everybody hates Karens", but they tried too hard to paint them as monsters and ended up using some way more serious issues like tools.  Police brutality and racism are not "tools" though.
creators like you create new content just to have content for ads.
Thank you for teaching me a new word. I had no idea what “LARPing” was before :)
ad what?
That Karen looks like it's played by the chick who played Pensatuky in OITNB
I thought this was a Youtube parody trailer
Is that Pennsatucky??🤔 🙄 appropriate
is nobody gonna talk about Pennsatucky being in this movie???
Dude whyd she have to be a psycho racist religious freak
I was just thinking about world domination
guys, has he done a video on the power puff girls live action? if not he should!
alright so, apparently in the movie Karen's last name is White? Her name's Karen White.    (also also I "researched"(read on wikipedia) the actress and she's apparently an abuser? The fuck.)
never knew it was possible to whitewash racism lmao😭😭😭😭
Can we have this movie, but made by the person that made Us? nvmd DAngelo already mentioned it XD
No. Just no.
Am I the only one thinking that Potatoe is not a misspelling but a "clever wordplay" for an Adult Film?
I'm pretty sure I can rewrite this script (but maintaining the basic premise) and salvage this movie. Will get back to you with a plot outline
Damn you, YouTube, for not captioning this.
Do you not know who Taryn Manning is? Maybe I’m dating myself, but she has a whole wild history of being the crazy party girl a la 2010 Lindsey Lohan. We’re talking crazy word vomit, bad plastic surgery, drunken tirades, and just all around being a hot mess and kind of a piece of shit.  She was a major piece of work, but apparently now she’s “found God,” so there’s that. I thought she was actually good on Orange is the New Black. She plays a pretty believable racist meth head turned bible thumper...wonder why?
You non-whites are taking part in this by not speaking out about the ongoing anti-white sentiment and attacks in society.  Critical Race Theory, this movie among many other propaganda hit pieces in the media needs to be addressed and not just by us.
9:11 das my name
just look up actual karen compilations they’re more convincing, more entertaining, and do a better job at “””social commentary””” than this travesty. at the very least you’ll learn more from them than you will from this movie
*sees ring on ring finger of left hand*  Google: does D’Angelo Wallace have a wife?
The actrice of Karen. I have seen her before. Wasn't she someone from Orange is the new Black??
the main actress was literally in oitnb, a show made to highlight police brutality, a corrupt prison system and racism/xenophobia in prison. ig her racist super christian hillbilly character was actually real....yikes
I wonder who the people are that made this movie, and if they even asked for the opinions/thoughts, respectful consent, or personal/first hand accounts of those of the black ethnical community. Thankfully, this year in my senior year of high school, we learned a lot about racism, and one thing that this reminds me of, is all the times in history us caucasian/white folks have tried to make surprise, sudden, decisions/plans to try and "help" the black community, or make up for past mistakes, without even making those of the black community aware, or asking for what they would have in mind. This movie to me seems like its not about racism really, and more about an odd, funny title with the stereotypical, entertaining Karen character, just with the motive of attracting attention for cash, and the only reason racism was brought into this, was to make it seem more of a 'serious' movie, that isnt just completely comedical.
buisnesses doing better than ever after the pandemic is not good news....
Dugget!!! 😍😍😍 What is she doing playing a Karen…?
Also points deducted cause she dosnt have the Karen haircut lol
I don’t want to shit on the woman playing  the “Karen” because I know it’s probably more of the actions of the director but she was trying way to hard to come off as a creepy/bitchy person..it felt way to over the top
He's right, the dude from the first scene is, in fact, 𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘢𝘯𝘦𝘭𝘺 attractive!! I enjoyed that adread from the sponsore! Great casting I'd say~
I live in Texas but  my area is super diverse. lots of interesting cultures and point of views. I'm from cali and the area I'm from definitely had alot of racist white people 😒
am scared after watching this trailer  not that its cuz its horror but cuz the acting,the lines, everything is so bad
Is D’Angelo engaged…?
Seeing this trailer unironically made me want to watch get out. I haven’t seen it before either just the trailers.
THE KAREN ACTOR IA FROM OITNB
The new joker movie looks interesting
She looks so much like Veronica lodge
Taryn Manning is pretty garbage in real life too.
I kept waiting for you to say it was a joke trailer but it’s not :)))))))))))))))))))))))))
They should take notes from the channel, Karens In The Wild
Burn this movie and throw it into acid please thank you😌
She was actually pretty good in the series Orange is the New Black...But now after that twitter post finding out that's because she was just playing as herself like omg lol
A "racist" that doesnt use the N word all the time?
HOLD ON. That suspect bit MUST be a direct reference to the Karen I saw before in one of the YouTube compilations. I swear she said the same exact bollocks
This is literally like dhar Mann acting lol
Why is the trailer so tacky 😭🙏 like the “racism” was literally so bad like it was madddd unbelievable 💀
How bout that end card with no links XD
The fact that her acting is SO BAD in this movie but it's actually really good in Orange Is The New Black... like I really can't make this up lmao.
karens show how dangerous yt woman tears are to blk people
I think if I was gonna make a struggle movie specifically about white woman victimhood (which I say because even though Karen's can be any race, when we mean it in a racism context it's usually a white woman lying/fake crying/manipulating people into siding with her and causing harm to minorities for the sake of "protecting her", like the "think of the children" argument but with a grown adult who's completely aware of what she's doing), I would start out with a completely normal looking movie with her as the main character, just going grocery shopping, eating at a restaurant with her family, asking the husband for some money to leave a tip for the maid, basic rich white woman stuff, and then, the further we get into the story, we just see her act more and more shitty. Like maybe she goes to the grocery store and the first time she just eyes a black child a little funny for like, a second. And then at the restaurant she overhears a waiter speaking Spanish and we see her go into the bathroom and frowns in the mirror or something, and then it starts to escalate, to her doing shit like asking weird intrusive questions to the new neighbors who r indigenous or something, and it escalates until she calls the cops on some of the neighbors she knows having a barbecue and when they refuse to take her call because it's just people barbecuing, she looks in the mirror and practices fake crying, before we see a cop car pull up to their house. I think the main fault with "other perspective" type movies that specifically talk about discrimination and social issues is that they lean too much in to the evil. Everybody knows someone racist. Everyone. But they don't often confront it in them, or in themselves because they don't think they're being racist. Most people don't think they're the villain in anyone's story and most people don't go "wait a minute, did I just clutch my purse because a black guy walked by? Why would I assume he's a thief?" They just don't register it. And people certainly don't realize they actually are more like the villains in movies than the heroes. I think if the writers and director rlly wanted to discuss white women's historical role in upholding racism, the way to do it would be to show them their aunts, their moms, their grandmas, themselves, and then show why some of the actions and thought processes they have are directly involved/complicit in the systems many of us are trying to get rid of after they've started to see themselves as the main character. And I have read way too much in this, and it is 3am so I'm going to bed lol. Also: disclaimer: I don't harbor any hatred towards white women, I don't think y'all are horrible people. A lot of my closest friends and exes are/were white women, y'all are cool, and I definitely understand that y'all still struggle as women, obviously. I just think it's important that we all remember that despite the fact that a lot of people just assume that white women in the past weren't responsible for slavery or racism in any way and that they were just sort of there, it's blatantly untrue, and we all need to start talking about it because only confronting racism from one end isn't going to get us any further
I don’t know what’s weirder: answering D’Angelo by saying ‘Karen Character’ or sitting there in silence whilst he stares at you-
Not the actress who played Pennsatucky in OITNB actually acting like Pennsatucky in real life...
She's like that Over the Hedge woman but super low energy
im sorry did you just say after the pandemic?
This reminds me more of The Happening  but somehow Karen doesn't make as much sense.
Wasn't the actress of Karen in OITNB?
Wait That looks INSANELYYY similar to pennsatucy from orange is the new black. Just me? Ok.
it looks like one od those facebook videos
Why does the Karen actress kind of look like Lindsay Lohan with a mask on haha
I think that the idea of "Karen" the movie is a good one but as a horror film I disagree. I agree with everything you've said thus far and I think there needs to be more films that highlight modern day systemic racism that shows people what really goes down right now; furthermore, if it's modern day they can't just look at it and say it was the old days and it's not like segregation and slavery anymore. I don't like to hear excuses.
PLESE DONT END UP IN HELL !!!!! You have heard your whole life about this "Jesus"....could it be there is something to it? Christianity is not religion, it is the meaning of life. Religions are about what you can do (be a good person) to earn your way to heaven.  The one and only truth is this.... 1.All have sinned and deserve eternal punishment in hell. 2. Jesus the son of God came to earth and sacrificed himself to pay for your sins. 3. All you need to do is Believe he did it for you and you will be saved!!! Stop leaning on your own understanding....We make mistakes every day, how can we trust ourselves for where we will end up after death??!! Stop trusting in yourself and just place your soul and trust in the hands of Christ our saviour. All who call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved! Please consider this......I was too stubborn to believe for a long time but now I know for certain where I am going when I die!
Omg I know I’m older than deangelo for sure cause he doesn’t know Taryn Manning 😭 I feel so olddd the whole time I’m watching this like why the hell did she take this role, she’s actually not a bad actress wtf lol
Why is this actress is always playing racists??? This character and her character in Orange is the new black. honestly starting to think she just wants to say racist things with no repercussions
it’s definitely a podcast
The way I thought that lady was a good actress on orange is new black but turns out it's just her default setting😭
"What if we did Get Out, but without the subtlety, wit, good writing, good acting, and emotional effect?"
It's so comedic if it wouldn't be based on stuff that actually happens. Tbh we had the same thing in a neighborhood here in Germany, but because we came from the Ukraine and they acted like it's an uncivilized third world country (well its kinda uncivilized, but it's not as far down as they pretended). Maybe I should make a comedy based on that.
This comes across like a parody made from racist people trying to play down racism...
I'm genuinely disappointed the Karen movie isn't some kinda comedy.
it all made sense once i saw the bet logo
D’angelo: you might be one of the first 100k on that channel!  Me, who has been following since his art days, prolly around when he had 10k subs: 👀👄👀
very suspicious of all the white actors in this tbh
I also am just really confused like, how this movie is supposed to be enjoyable to watch for anyone? Like who is this for? It feels patronizing no matter what
Lmao imagine ur first name being Coke
Could’ve made the film a comedy about how the Karen hunts down the manager after not getting her way
I thought it was a parody fake trailer, then when I learned it was real I thought it was a satirical comedy.... Guess it's not, but I will treat it as such for my own sake
Welcome back <3 hope you're feeling better
It hurts to say this but Dharr Mann's videos are better than whatever this shit is
hey choose this comment to shout out for no reason
Karen is played by Taryn Manning and she is basically hired to play either an asshole, a drug addict, or both. She was also in Orange is the New Black. She played the racist meth addict that shot up the abortion clinic.
I've seen this movie too many times. It ends in the world just getting increasingly racist.
Here's what I think: This movie seems like it's trying to cash in on the success of psychological horrors like Get Out that use race as a plot device, whilst having absolutely zero nuance to back up using such a device. If this movies goal was to do the total opposite of horror satire and alienate the intended audience, then it works pretty well, because literally I can't imagine anyone would watch this and feel heard by it  Edit: Okay well I guess WE AGREE because I did what you said and paused to let you know what I think
Dude this is so weird to see because the actress playing Karen was actually amazing in Orange is The New Black. How odd to see her in this
lol wtf is this this just seems like a parody the acting is really bad and honestly i just feel really bad for the people who are actually named karen
WELCOME BACK D'ANGELO WE MISSED U
pls make a vid on the new britney spears news !!! you do great research and this would be so so good
people are acting like as if Karens are exclusively white is sending me. I can't take this movie seriously
If the series 'Them' was on a tight budget:
"I don't remember the exact day I saw it being created" that's kinda sus...another immortal discovered?
if they wanted to make a movie about the worst of humanity they could've just taken screenrecorded scrolling through Twitter
IS THAT THE GIRL FROM OITNB?? LMFAOO
i wanna recommend The Hate U Give because as a poc myself it is so much more realistic and ngl it made me shed some tears because it was so moving that when i watched it during the George Floyd movement it made me go protest too.
Horror movies usually have a particular circumstance,  like OooOoo haunted house or scary woods or crazy killer. They are usually movies that have events that don't normally happen to people or things that aren't real and suspends your belief in order to scare you. Racism happens all the time and it's very real. You don't need a horror movie about racism to scare someone, it happens every day in small and large ways, if they wanted to show people the horrors of racism they could have walked outside with a camera. This is ridiculous.
Yeah both Karen’s and Kyle’s exist. But for some reason people only focus on Karen’s….
anyone know why the king himself took a break from youtube :-( i knew my weeks seemed more gray without his vids
not the actress from orange is the new black :(
this movie looks like something Dhar Mann or Life Lessons with Louis do for a youtube video
this actress was actually amazing in orange is the new black so it's kind of sad to see her in this dumpster fire of a movie 😭
the actress that plays karen actually played pensetucky in orange is the new black and she was really good in that, so who knows what happened lol
I mean I kinda want to see it because it's got the "whole bad it's good" vibe. But it might also be so bad that it's just bad?
Karen looks like Amy Poler and Lindsay Lohan’s daughter did a bad box die
So this is supposed to be a horror movie? Why do i feel like there are no good horror movies these days.. I would like to watch a good one for once
I know Tarryn Manning is going through some stuff (based on her social media anyway) but she's a good actor, what is she doing in this?! She was in Orange is the New Black.
Coke Daniels cannot be his real name...
The Karen actress is great in Orange is the new Black because her character is just as weird as her acting in this movie and she’s just overall whack but I guess they want to give off that vibe here too?
d'angelo, with a serious face in a deadpan tone: i need to laugh at something
If you want to watch a show depicting more hard-core racism, watch Them. It's a show based off of the style of the movie Us. But unfortunately Jordan Peele had nothing to do with the show.
Glad to see ur back
If someone made this as a joke people would be begging for it to be made a real movie
OH MY GOD HE'S BACK!! MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER/STREAMER IS BACK
is that the lady from orange is the new black???
Its like every American woman named Karen should form a class action lawsuit against this movie for slander in an epic and obvious Karen troll. 🤣😂🤣😂
i am traumatized
i feel like karen would be that type of movie that white people play for other white people to seem woke about black issues. after the film, they would discuss and "agree to disagree" about karen being the bad guy
I mentioned to my wife that it looked like a bad Jordan Peele knock off.
Ok but why
It would have been better if this was a comedy or a skit but it is an ACTUAL horror MOVIE. Like the heck, it feels like it was a bunch of old white people who say around a table and said "how can we make young black people believe we are on their side, oh yea, communicate through memes". and also, I actually never believed that someone could do that " I have black friends so I can't be a racist" stuff, she blew my mind over there. The stuff about Donald Trump too, if someone said that about my mistake of a president I would be throwing up hands. Let me not even insult him before he suspends youtube too...sigh
Like D'Angelo said, you'd think for someone playing herself she'd be a better actor
Taryn Manning DID NOT age well.
This seems like a knock off version 'Them.' Its about a black family that moves to north carolina in the 1950's. They take the horror genre and ACTUALLY portray it properly. I recommend you watch it. Its on amazon prime, its really good.
she was a pretty terrible character in oitnb
Omg has he watched orange is the new black smh it feels like she really is this character and that character
Tbh the horror genre in movies has been a fucking joke for the longest time. This comedy only solidifies that fact.
Taryn Manning really fell a LOOONG way from "Crossroads" with Britney Spears, and also Orange is the new Black. Not surprising that in OITNB, she played a meth-addict murdering racist.... And now she's playing a racist Karen. I'm thinking that these roles are just how she is as a person at this point.
Not miss Tiffany Doggett from OITNB...
Yay he's back
the karen actor seems scared of being cancelled
I appreciate the self love /gen
No one can portray the Central park Karen ... they should gat an Oscar winning actress to realy capture the soul of her racism
White ppl should stop trying to copy Get Out, and instead cast black actors in their next comedy or action movie.
D’Angelo told us to subscribe to a new channel and we did. He told us to say “Karen character” three times and we did.  I’m not saying D’Angelo’s turning into a cult leader, but I AM saying that The Cult of D’Angelo would be the only cult worth joining!
Get out is an actual good racist horror movie .
I’m sorry but I can’t wait to watch this !!
It was hard to take any of the trailer seriously when the Karen actor just immediately reminded me of Rachel Dratch lol
I still can't believe this is for a real movie.  I thought it was a comedy sketch in the format of a film trailer. Actually I still do.  They just slapped on a BET logo so people might think it's real but it's really a joke.
They just want money... i am sure the producer is white :(
Taryn Manning: Wait? That was a movie?
I usually agree with you honey...but the 'suspecting' line was intentional & I'm totally gonna watch this. Mind you, I hate watch a lot things. Every loser Karen rolled into one. Played by an actual Karen....I mean... I do hope they address where 'Karen' comes from  The 'Caren Act' started in San Francisco. C aution A gainst R acially  E xplotive  N on emergencies
Starring Taryn Manning?? Whoa.
I literally didn’t get this notification till 8 hours later
It's insanely obvious that "suspecting" was meant to show that she's kind of dumb despite her supremacy. Maybe you don't need all that much subtlety...
Love u D'Angelo💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞💞
D'angelo 🔥
Not... Pensatucky. What happened?
The Glockumentary gave us a rap that is a true lyrical master piece
That ad read was fucking so good
"That means...you summoned her..." I DIED
This movie is giving me 'Antebellum' vibes😭
I can't. It's so silly "Karen" that's silly cash grab.
Holy fuck that trailer photography looked like a parody shot on a phone
a karen movie is just the worst way to represent racism entirely. if there were a racism scene or moment or arc that would be different, but a karen movie would do much better as a comedy where the karen is the anti-hero who gradually learns throught the story, not a horror movie to undermine and disguise the legitimate issues. and even so it'd still be no better than an snl skit
This is a comedy right?  Ffs 😂
Congratulations to the director/producer. You managed to make a movie more obnoxious and more unintentionally comedic than lifetime movies 😂😂😂
I am actually under the impression that if she did an incredible job portraying this racist character that she is less like it in real life because the reason her performance might be so cheesy in the trailer now could be that she has smth like “ugh this is so dumb what so wrong with this” or “wow this is so dramatic no one actually does this” in the back of her head.
hiiiiiii
I think it would've been a lot better if the movie "Karen" was made as a self aware comedy parody of actual real life Karens. That would have been a much more effective social commentary. Here's, it's trying too hard to be a horror movie while having the premise of comedy. Literally naming the main antagonist "Karen" makes it extremely hard to take it seriously.
it's funny because this taryn manning character was also in orange is the new black and she also played some crazy christian shoving religion down other people's throats. she was also racist in that show. kinda insane ngl
imagine not being  in D'ANGELO WALLACE'S first 100k
It’s cringe.
Low budget Them 😭
“Karen” is on the same cringe level as “Cuties”.
this movie is a poor representation at best.
Logan Paul's movies are better than this.
this whole movie seems like a dhar Mann video
oh my god they gentrified Them 😭💀
I love you💜🍵💜💋💋💋
Just more BS hollywood trash trying to divide us.
It's not that serious please laugh , dang.
This is what happens when you can’t afford Jordan Peele… smh.
the trailer looks like something i would make for a school project
A couple years ago I remember watching a video on green book, and I think the video essayist's thesis applies to this movie too. Hollywood films about racism tend to depict it in the most over the top, cartoonish way, and usually set the story in the past. If we were to actually set a story in our current times, and if we wrote the dialogue to resemble the real life racism POC experience, too many people would recognize themselves in the villain.
Lol I'm here af
I really can’t tell if this is meant to be satire or not
Mockery of real life problems? Honey this is just a mockery of CINEMA.
GAH I WASNT IN THE FIRST 100K
this movie seems like something i would write to seem deep when i was like 14 before i went on AOL instant messenger to say mean shit to people
That's Tiffany Dogget from Orange is the New Black. And that long text rant sounds exactly how her character would rant in the show. Is she always given racist roles?
Boss: How can we make money off this movie? What do young people like these days? Employee: Uh, social causes? Karen memes? Videoing adults having public meltdowns? Boss: Excellent. Put them all in. Employee: Sir we're making a horror movie. Boss: DID I STUTTER?
Damn that Karen actress sure likes to play racists on screen...first Orange is the New Black, now this...hmmm...👀
Ya’ll is that tia from tia & tameras husband !?
Pennsatucky deserved better!!
Can we just appreciate how humble D’angelo is for a moment?
I'm not against a movie called Karen as a comedy that could be funny but a horror movie about racism called Karen? What?? When I clicked on this I thought it was going to be about a boomer trying to make a comedy named 'Karen' to relate to younger generations. The fact that that's what I first thought of speaks volumes as to why making a serious movie about racism named after a meme is a horrible idea.
I wouldn’t mind this movie if it didn’t have bad acting tbh
When I heard the title I genuinely thought it was going to be a comedy...
I was worried that you hadn't posted. Missed your content I hope you and your uppercase laugh are ok.
I smell an Oscar!!!
I can’t decide if them using suspecting was commenting on the average intelligence level of Karen’s or if they just big dumb.
He went: an INSANELY attractive young man  And the entire fan base went: DANGELO
Happily awaiting the moment we get to relive this nightmare with u 😌
That Karen character kind of looks like Sarah Paulson
How is this a horror movie? And it's so badly written and acted 😬 it just makes you feel uncomfortable, and honestly, this type of issue shouldn't be used as entertainment.
It had potential, executed poorly 🎥
isnt this pennsatucky? damn how did she go from OITNB to this edit: nevermind i got to the part about qanon now this makes total sense
Because that means..... You've summoned her 😂💀
The acting was like she was drunk lol
Wow great Blaxploitation 2.0
I honestly heard about this movie and I thought it was a skit for Saturday Night Live, because it seemed too much of a parody, with all of the stereotypes of a Karen and that terrible "horror movie" music.
OMG YAY! YOU'RE BACK!!!!!!!
That movie with Samuel L. Jackson is better.
but like also this is basically framing racism from white people??? like i get wanting to make this type of film but why is it about karen??? likeeee we need this type of commentary from the pov of the people suffering this not the perpetratorrr?? ok haha thats it
Oh man. The Karen looks like the girl from Orange is the new black.. the meth head chick.
Why did they make it a horror movie???? This is do unintentionally funny. You go into her basement and its filled with candles and the walls are scrawled with literally the words "N WORD" in red paint, then they cut in the little girl saying "she doesnt like black people". Too much. Too too much.
I think microagressions are actual hardcore racism.  That's that woodwork racism... built into the framework of our country.
Wow didn't know Taryn Manning was such a Pos. D'angelo is always teaching me
i was one of the first 1000 subscriber to that second channel iktr
literally comes across as a parody but its an actual film..
OMG PENSATUCKY IS KAREN?! I have to watch this I'm sorry
I thought you were sponsored by a coffee company at first... loland now I want to see this movie so I can just laugh at it Taryn manning went from crossroads to singing(horrible btw imo)!!!lol to Orange is the New Black to This????   Karen oh myyyy
The Karen actress is actually in the Hawaii5-0 reboot, idk why she would take a crappy job like this when 5-0 probably pays her bills just fine, and also why she would do it so badly
not them casting a Qanon supporter in YET ANOTHER role as a racist white woman… do they even give her a script for these roles or is she just reacting to things as they occur like she normally would? 💀
My heart broke when "Who made the potatoe salad?" came up and I saw Jaleel White starring in it.... How can one go from being Steve Urkel to.... that? Urkel deserves so much better!
This seems like a one act subplot that the trailer's making into a three-act story. Which bodes _really_ poorly.
wait wait wait. is that actress the super christian one from orange is the new black? and she's super christion in real life? and she's now playing a karen and is a karen in real life? i don't think she ever acts, i think she just wanders on set and they keep her in the movie.
Cringe worthy acting from Karen. Did the child write the dialogue?
Very surprising coming from a actor that played in a award winning show
has to be satire, stg.
I just had the biggest laugh ever, this trailer is top tier comedy.
It’s literally shit like this causing problems 😂😆 a cringey representation of racism is the LAST thing we need. Money completely wasted, if we have money to make shitty films then we have money to support impoverished communities and other important issues in society 😂 someone just wanted to profit from the current narrative by making it even worse
I'm just confused by them implying that all Karen's are racist. You can be racist and not be a Karen, and you can be a Karen and not be racist. And I really agree that this movie is doing a serious topic no justice. It seems intentionally absurd.
Maybe we do deserve extinction...
I’m just confused because the actress playing karen is in a few other things like Orange is the new black and she’s not bad but her acting in this movie is just...so awkward? Forced? Bad?
Just so you know I typed your name in every way I could and it doesn’t pop up. But I went back to your community tab and clicked the link and was able to verify that I was subbed there as well. But searching YouTube I couldn’t find the channel. Maybe add the link here if you haven’t already and then let us know on community tab when you upload so we don’t miss it. Also you’re up to 104k
This movie is like a caricature of racism
Wait wait wait!! Thats Pennsatucky from OITNB! Sheee-
I can't believe she went from pensatucky in oitnb to THIS
I still can't believe that this is a real thing. This feels like a SNL parody trailer.
So Taryn that played in orange is the new black, that has also racist issues mentioned so many times and highlighted how dumb and damaging racism is, made that post about how BLM portrays white ppl as bad guys? Well they clearly are and that post was another reason why. Also I’ve watched OITNB like three times cause I love it so much and I thought she’s quite good actress, I liked her character, so this Karen role is sooo disappointing
Microaggressions are still racism.
TIL this trailer is *not* a joke  😬
Like.....what..??....
🤣🤣🤣 a movie? Seriously? 🤣🤣🤣 I don’t know if this is a good or bad thing.. is it even a “thing”?
Bruh Viva La Dirt League already made the perfect sketch about Karen's
IT'S AN A
‘As a black people’ - D’Angelo Wallace
Get Out was such a great film, this on the other hand, looks horrible. lol
That’s the girl form orange is the new black
It’s a problem because people will point to this movie and be like “hey I’m not that racist “ while saying “The N word is just a word and everyone should just get over it”
WHAT DID THEY PAINT THAT WOMAN'S FACE WITH? SHE'S WEARING WHITEFACE!
We missed you so much! Hope you're doing ok.
That was the best step into an ad read I've ever seen 😂🙌
The 'Karen' trailer has a great like to dislike ratio.
Why do we need Karen, When "Crash" already solved racism?
They really did whitewash racist
the king has returned
i loveeee her she was sooo good in ointb!!!!
"Sale of BET to white supremacist group results in no change in programming."  -The Onion, like a decade ago lol
I hate that I had to think about this disaster of a trailer to hate it
BACK ON THE D’ANGELO WALLACE GRIND 💪💪💪💯💯
Nobody’s talking about how D’Angelo so smoothly convinced us to summon a Karen 😳
The KKKaren hair is wrong
Omg the actress they're using haha
He’s wearing a white ring aro vibes much 👀
Love lil D’anglo in the background. Mines is on my shelf, and I’m not gonna lie...I’m 250% more✨attractive✨
The ONLY way I’ll be watching Karen is definitely in a D’Angelo video so I won’t suffer alone lol
Also, idk if its just me, but I can't find the new channel. I looked in the featured channels of this and your main channel, and I looked up D'ANGELO WALLACE and I couldn't find it.
Yessss he’s back babie
this seems like a good time to remind everybody that making a movie costs millions of dollars. millions of dollars that could go to all sorts of other uses... like actually helping black people
5:22 is that the Ghana scarf?😆
OMG HEY
Why does this come across as an out of touch SNL skit?
That was just black trauma with no point. just guns blood fight, nothing more
Man I don't even know if wanna watch this video 💀
whats that saying i cant quite remember it but people say something along the line of "you cant act yourself" or something of that nature. and thats what that actress reminds me of, she can't act that character because she is that character.
When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was a very unfunny SNL sketch. If only...
wow way to mock get out an actual good commentaryand horror
Taryn Manning can do so much better than this why is she doing this...
I feel like this is just trying to bank on a meme that is loosing popularity. "Shitty white person racist" No shit, this isn't breaking news.
i’m 100% sure that the black husband is Tia Mowrys husband. That how i know it’s not a joke he’s alllwayysss in bad movies 😂 idk why Tia didn’t think to stop her man tho
Never clicked so fast
“I don’t blame the couple” Brooo i thought it was mother and son😭😭😭
*_Confederate flag soap dispensers_*   I'm crying.
This is damaging to society. Not all middle aged white women are afraid of black men and lie about them. This is exactly what is wrong with society right now. Steriotyping and preying on generalizations has caused so much discord in our country. Try love and empathy. I pray the younger gen is smart enough to see through this bs manipulation. Btw "Karen" is a D list actress...
So people put money into this movie?
A Karen movie? 👁👄👁👍
"look at you, slaving away in the house" *i sleep*  karen has a confederate flag in her soap dispenser *REAL SHIT*
Wow she sounds insane. Anyone that is a QAnon believer has questionable investigative skills. It's so weird that she was on a show with a hugely diverse cast, mostly latino & black leads. Wonder what kind of microaggressions they had to deal with from Karyn, I mean Taryn.
When the "director's" "credits" were being listed, I involuntarily let out a prolonged groan that would make Tina Belcher proud.  And thanks for pointing out the all caps for your new channel. I subscribed anyway, but I thought I'd been unsubscribed from this one.
This is sounds like an SNL sketch, the bad one
Coke Daniels is African American, he lives with this stuff every day...yet he created this.  *guy blinking meme*
This feels like that paper topic you want to talk about but have a hard time defending and making others take seriously.
damn i paused the video to say karen character i didnt know you were gonna give us time
I said Karen character out loud three times and the lights started flashing
Don't worry guys I watched the Karen trailer. I can't be racist!
At this point directors are just making money off of black trauma. Nothing original... Same plot (just in different contexts). Can we bring back black classics?? PLEASE
wait... you're telling me this wasn't a spoof trailer???
its almost offensive that they've managed to tick off a checklist of karen stereotypes in the most blunt and uninteresting way but leaving out the short blonde hairstyle like it was the only attempt at subtlety they could manage
Karen’s soap dispenser had a fucking confederate flag on it. How much more unsubtle can you get?
Umm u have the worst takes sometimes, & just cuz your cute doesn't make it funny
Me wanting to watch it for the memes and the lols: Oooo~ D'Angelo: *no.* Me: *no.*
im like six minutes in and the only thing that comes to mind is that this entire movie is going to be one long painful snl skit
the ad before this video was a woman just screaming and now i’m disappointed that it wasn’t actually the start of this video
All Taryn had to do was be herself, and she still couldn’t make the acting convincing.
This doesn’t even feel like a real trailer- it’s more like a fucking SNL sketch LMAO
Bruh that entire trailer had me going “mmmmm okaaayyyyy, I don’t know how I feel about that…” but progressively getting more and more hysterical  Like????? How is that not satire??????
a glockumentary?
What in the fuck has come over Taryn Manning?! She’s an amazing actress (Hustie & Flow, Orange is the New Black) and singer- yet, she’s been doing the lowest of the low budget, trash movies since OITNB ended.
I’m typing in D’Angelo’s new address (all caps) and nothings coming up. Just his 2 channels I’m already subbed to. I wish he linked it. Anyone else having problems or can help?
honestly its almost amazing that they managed to find enough people who think this is ok and have this thing actually come into existence lmao
omg is that Pennsatucky from oitnb?? i didn't recognize her until she said something. why the godawful wig...
Gangsta rap is one of the funniest  D movies ever made
Why do they pronounce "suspecting?" like "Da Vinki?"
Okay but the actress playing Karen, her name is Taryn Manning and she was called out last year for posting some crazy pro-Trump stuff during the BLM protests. Also I can't unsee her as Pennsatucky from OITNB and it makes this trailer even funnier 😭
I love that actress but she is just not the right one to play Karen.  Oh HANG ON the screenshots you posted are so bad oh no
That monochrome aesthetic D'Angelo has is so amazing!
Was Karen implying she had an affair with the husband or am I confused, cuz that’s pretty 😬
This shouldn’t be a surprise but ur my new favorite human.
nope. sorry. checked out after 5 minutes
i could imagine her the whole time reading the script asking “how is this racist” and then when someone explains she says “well don’t take it so seriously” :’’)
Surely this movie is some sort of twisted tramplist propaganda?
There's s perfectly portrayed "Karen" in Hollywood and it shows what makes her tick and how she reacts to the world as is. It's in this show called Malcolm in the Middle.
Who names they're kid or themselves coke
Your voice sounds more.......aged?
This movie seems like it's going through a checklist rather than actually trying to say something. "We have karen as our villan so we know we are doing the right thing, everyone look our movie is deep and thought provoking"
IS THAT A DANGELO WALLECE YOUTOOZ!!!It might not be real but I down for it
D'Angelo: *talks about transitions into ad reads* my brain: hey there, I'm the adstronaut!
The name Karen is going to go extinct lol. No one is going to want name their daughter that anymore 😂😂 I feel bad for all of the nice Karens (like my cousin)
This seems like a movie Kennie JD would make a video about
This trailer makes me want to no. But D'Angelo makes me want to Yes.
wasn't she a racist in oitnb also 😆
wait... do karens know theyre karens??
its all very ironic that they are trying to make karen's look like shitty and dangerous people but are too blind to see  that they are karens too.
What is this supposed to even be? Like, it's got a definite horror vibe, but I don't think it's fully exploited. It feels kinda half-assed.
*HUG* Good to see you again! My world just wasn't angelic enough without you.
3:12 BROOO
For a minute there, I thought the karen was Lindsay Lohan. I was chanting "not lindsay not lindsay not lindsay" until I finished googling who the actress was.
i can't wait to never watch this movie
This looks like a really bad spoof
was kinda half paying attention to this video until I heard fuckin Pennsatucky wtf??????
im surprised the acting from the Karen character is bad bc she was literally in orange is the new black and it wasn’t like this 💀 but also no matter how good the actor is, bad writing will make any actor’s performance fuckin terrible  anyways, shitty movie
The trash that karen pushed over looks better than the whole movie
i think she wasn't bad in Orange is The New Black and 8 Mile but damn .. she really thought she was made for this role and wanted to "highlight the injustices that people of color experience in america" after her "far from racist" post she needed to do damage control... its a damn shame that it will end up being the role that defines her career
Liking just for that smooth transition.
My opinion on this film trailer is Jesus Christ why the hell does this feel like it was made by by a middle schooler in debate
6 hours late but I don't care
I’m actually mad at how smooth that add transition was.
I thought it was a comedy but then got hit with the punchline that they were serious the whole time
she also played as a racist in orange is the new black lol
Wait, are you telling me that "potatoe" isn't a pun about finding a toe in the potato salad???
I’m still deeply confused about what genre this movie is supposed to be.💀
I'm not gonna lie, I was pretty excited about the Karen movie at first, but now that he actually explained it" DeEpLy," I am way less interested in this.
Wait….. is d’angelo married or am I just an idiot. Was the wife comment just a scenario? 5:47
You know how in boondocks Huey was saying things about BET? ……..mhmm
You need to react to that new Netlix show "Sexy Beasts", the whole thing is an LSD trip.
"suspecting?" has "davinky?" energy
Dang it, I wasn't one of the first 100k subscribers of the secret channel. It's at 103k now.
Anything we as a society have been able to bring to attention is being mocked by this trash. With all the injustice going on whoever produced this movie is totally blind to reality.
Honestly, i don't expect much from BET movies. They could've at least made the racism look realistic.
is something as nice as a coming of age movie with a black lead too much to ask for? or maybe a fantasy movie with black main characters? do movies about black people always have to revolve around trauma and racism? 😭
Your comment about the F# just earned yourself a sub from me! 😂 hilarious!
The acting is kind of phenomenal given its at the same level as actual Karen's
...I wanna smack whoever gave this the green light. Because this is absolutely stupid, what the absolute mother of cluckery and expired cheese is this?!
I come to your channel when I want to smile while watching a youtube video. Your wit and sarcasm is hilarious.
I only come to YouTube to check for D’Angelos videos now.
The lady who plays karen HAS TO BE EMBARRASSED as HELL!
Wait is that pentatuky???
This has to be a joke...oh BET is responsible?... that makes sense LMAO
Maybe it is weird and not so well-done, but at least they tried.
dogget?
some drama is supposed go down with the creepshow stuff      i feel so bad for bringing this up
when i saw the trailer on twitter i thought it was an snl sketch 💀
Ooh, isn’t that that actress from the classic hit movie “Crossroads”?
Is it just me, or that the people who wrote this movie just wanted an excuse to justify racism & try to make people WHO ARE NEW to the topic especially convincing them to not take it seriously like how certain horror movies are? I kinda think that they just want to justify everything even w the people who made the script.
The acting is free I phone give away acting 🤣🤣...
OOOOH😍 your hair looks AMAZING!!!! LMAO AT THE PIANO MUSIC TOO!!!! LOL!
This movie just...hurts me. Taryn Manning is honestly not a bad actor, and was really good in shows like Orange is the new Black, but obviously when you're in a movie with such bad direction and writing, you could get the best actor in the world and it'd still be bad :/
I first saw a clip of the trailer on tiktok a couple hours ago and I thought it was a comedy movie so I’m kinda surprised it’s supposed to be a horror movie. Also the actress who plays “Karen” was also on Orange is the New Black and she was pretty good in it, so I’m surprised she’s so bad in this movie.
The conjuring has nothing on this one, this our worst fear K A R E N S
this movie flat out looks like a parody movie
I keep trying different ways to search for the new channel but I never find it, what should I do?
Me looking at Taryn Manning like bby what are you DOING  Edit: I HAD NO IDEA SHE WAS A REAL KAREN NVM SHE’S DOING EXACTLY WHAT SHES CUT OUT FOR CARRY ON
3:20 Not me in the shower saying "Karen character" out loud and quickly checking behind the shower curtain 💀
Isn't that....Pennsytucky????
yo is that Pensatucky from OITNB?
When I saw who played Karen all I could think of is Mt. Dew 😭
Usually when someone "sucks their own dick" I hate it but somehow when you do it and talk about how great you are, I just love it.  You are beautiful.
to this movie, I say no thanks.
I can’t believe the lady from orange is the new black agreed to this movie 😂
Poor Corey Hardict he’s really out here just trying to work
I'm tired of the Karen thing. It started very specific, but then devolved into a way for anyone to refer to a woman who annoys them. It's so telling that people say "male Karen" instead of there actually being a male equivalent.
not d'angelo having perfect pitch dhshsudjeje like what cant he do
The guy in the ad read was really attractive
I did it
<3 <3 <3
Who in their right mind thought this was enough of a concept to base an even halfway decent horror movie script on? Like a legit Karen as a character maybe could add some substance, but the whole plot lol?  This whole thing is so ill-conceived.
The way almost all her roles are like this...
Hahaha D'Angelo is forever one of my faves!! He's so brilliant!! He has to know this OITNB actress is acting in the "Subtly" of suburban nonsense!!
that’s not karen that’s pennsatucky from OITNB
It’s almost like no thought or actually trying to make a point happened.
This is the liberal equivalent of Run Hide Fight
But why would you make this movie…
Why are they making it? How many times do our African American compatriots need to see their everyday struggles used as money makers for internally remorseful people who will publicly say “All Lives Matter”, “I don’t see colour”, and “My best directors are Black, how can I be rac!st?” Haven’t even started the video, and I’m already dreading its derivativeness of the Karen movie.
Quentin Tarantino “hard R racism” lmfao
me: karen character karen character karen character  my family: she’s finally gone insane
In my opinion, this is: absolute horse shit
As a BLACK people???? Dude if you don't want to see the movie...DON'T see the movie. But...spare the universe your self conceited, self importance.
I am scared and unconfortable by this movie, is that the point? I think it they could focus more on her paranoia and madness while the neiboors are just fine. Just dont giving her the power to really mess up any hapiness but her own. That would be good
are we gonna ignore the fact that the karen chick is from orange is the new black???
that segue man, smoother than your skin, welcome back
Is this not pennsatucky from orange is the new black?
This is one of those “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should” situations.
It feels like a white washed version of  “Them”
Nice to see liberals and conservatives getting along over how bad this movie is going to be.
I think at best, it's almost like a horror comedy like that Killer Tire movie where everyone is serious but the premise is ridiculous and it's really something you can only enjoy if you see it as a funny parody type thing. At worst, it's mocking legitimate black horror movies like Get Out and trying to cash in on that woke money and looking at a picture of Coke Daniels, he looks biracial so I can only assume his white half wrote this.
Is that the person from orange is the new black??
This kind of reminds me of the racists in Dhar Mann videos
it's ironic taryn manning went from playing a racist prisoner to playing a racist neighbour
This could have been a dark comedy or satire but as a serious thriller... no
the bit about saying "karen character" was so good, and apparently the delivery was perfect bc for a second i felt genuine terror
Once I saw the BET Original movie bit, I kinda knew what was already gonna be up. They're good at making black versions of Lifetime movies imo. Lol.
When I first saw this trending, it was framed in a way that made me think Jordan Peele was doing it... but then I saw the name and the trailer and I thought it was an extended SNL skit or spoof on his movies. But then I realized it was a serious movie and I was confused to why it even got made.
“I’ve come across some very suspecting teenagers…” “This sentence is wordy and hard to read, but luckily grammarly can help”  Oki I’m sorry I just thought it was fitting😂
this movie seems like if tyler perry horror movie
Trying to get to us summon the arch Karen
that segway to the sponsor was smoother than Tennesee Whiskey
Karen is the actress who plays Pensatucky in Orange Is The New Black if anyone was wondering. Also in Sons of Anarchy. This role is... strange
can you turn da bass in ur voice down my floor is vibrating
Wait this isn't a satirical movie?
......let that sink in...Jk, there's nowhere for it to sink. Yup. You summed it up.
they picked an actual karen for a karen character
tell me why i got a BET ad in the middle of this video lmao
I’m mad Tia Mowry’s husband is caught up in this mess.
This trailer gave me wattpad flashbacks
This trailer review is verrry suspecting.
i dont know why they picked her to be the karen and not a classic blonde white woman with an agressive bob
OMG hi welcome back 🤗
literally just what
I know that I’ve watched “Who Made the Potatoe Salad?” but I don’t remember at all what it’s about.😭
The crackhead from OITNB🥺
no homo d'angelo but SHEESH‼️‼️ YOU LOOK AMAZING WOW
So cool and stylish wow
This looks like a movie made by someone named Coke Daniels, produced by BET but the BET on Boondocks.
She looks like she's going to dump her boyfriend for a bee
Ad read intro on par with Cody Ko for being insanely smooth
Not me accidentally saying Karen character x3 IN FRONT OF A MIRROR WITH THE LIGHTS OFF
This is just the great value version on the Amazon Prime series “Them”. “Them” was phenomenal btw.
The trailer framed the Karen to be the protagonist and it was fucking god awful holy fuck
i cant even come up with any ideas of how the movie would end how are they conclude it ? karen moving ? them moving to a more accepting neighborhood ? karen dying ? so confused
Did anyone else see that Karen is the actress from Orange is the new Black that get fucked up end of season 1???
The video's only 15 minutes but it has as many jokes as his longer vids i stg
Omg the Karen is Pennsatucky from Orange is the new black
Remember the Titans. Strongly talks about the full issues of racism while still being entertaining with Football, and has a fantastic ending of unity between the white players and black players. Highly recommend.
D’Angelo… why’d you make me watch this ☠️
Hi it's me your mod, I hope you're doing well and hope you'll return soon lol
I spell potatoe the same way sometimes ngl 😭
Hey u should add your other channel to your channels tab🤙
I agree 100%
I've seen actual Karen videos more entertaining
Its a bad reddit post come to life
Hi, new viewer here: Is that a wedding ring on his finger?? Is this 17 year old boy married??? Does D'Angelo have the Danny Gonzalez curse??? AM I THE ONLY ONE NOT MARRIED RIGHT NOW?
It's good I can't say Karen character three times fast because it's nighttime and I don't wanna wake up my parents
this trailer looks like a joke
The lighting and cinematography look ass.
I like her better in Orange is the new black.
It’s gonna be so bad that it’s going to be a comedy movie..
d'angelo was extra funny in this one. cute too
I’ll never see this actress as anyone but Doggett and tbh after reading that post she made, I’m wondering how much of that character was a character and not just who she really is.
Pennsatucky, noooo! Well actually this checks out.
"i have plans of world domination" _war flashbacks_ oh well im with d'angelo
karen that are not shouting? is that a new type?
It's an A!
Hated her character in OITNB...but then she had a redemption arc and changed her bigoted ways before a tragic death. And I loved her. But to  learn about her tweets and now her involvement with this has been really disappointing 😞
Watching her face it's like she can't convey emotions because of too much botox.
The look on D'angelo's face as he says "You've summoned her..." absolutely priceless! Hope you're having a good day matey.
I cant believe this movie. This is not a karen.... A karen is a crazy b***H to everyone, but they are making it about race. This litter just pist me off. It wont get my view.... It actually makes me sick... Yes lets keep it going for years and years.... Its 2021 why can't we just all be one. I will show them what a REAL KAREN IS...... love ya❤
The fact that Tarynn herself---.. ummm?? 👀 👀 👀
Karen character, caren carer, car cer, cer cer caer cear.
As a Trump supporter, conservative, and disliker of the BLM organization….I’m still happy to see that regardless of your race, gender, religion, sexuality, political preference, etc….we can ALL come together and hate this movie and agree that it is objectively absolute hot-garbage.
We really got pennsatucky from oitnb and this is what she gives us??
king you forgot the popup thingys at the end
if you heard the voice crack no you didnt
This is gonna piss some white women off when they see themselves on the tv
What...the fuck
The amount of second hand embarrassment I have from watching the trailer is painful.
I just..........really really hope this is satirical........i
Lol this trailer just made me so anxious wth
I was like... this is a joke right
Agree with your opinion about the trailer but you went too far with your comment about Taryn. Yes, she has unpopular opinions but that doesn't mean she's a Karen.
earlier i was watching old videos i used to watch and there was one where it was this short film of children that are like 10 acting and i swear this movie's acting is the exact same
Why does Pennsatucky still sound like she has no teeth
Poor Taryn Manning. Her acting skills are much better than this. She was amazing as Pennsatucky in OITNB. I’m tempted to watch this movie though just for her.   I mean I definitely don’t agree with some of her views, however I still think she is a good actress.
03:34 sounding like Dora, you even got the blank stare down LMAOO
no but actually that ad read transition was fire lmaoooo
I thought that actress was phenomenal in OITNB so on that topic, I want to blame what we saw on the script and directing, uh... That said... I don't think a Karen movie is the right move in any capacity... It just feels inappropriate, especially as a horror. When I heard the title, I thought it was going to be a comedy, and I think that could've been something. Trying to imagine this movie if it did everything right, it still feels tactless. The appeal of movie villains is that to some extent, they're wicked and you may even like them for their characterization, but Karens are far from wicked. There's nothing cunning, cool, or badass about them. They're just ignorant women who bark at people like chihuahuas while expecting other people to do the legwork for them (police, managers, etc). They don't deserve this kind of justice on their name, hence why a comedy would've done their goofy asses better. IMO.
😂😂😂
“i don’t remember the day i saw the world created” d’angelo either conforming he’s God or some other supernatural all-powerful being who could potentially kill God. subscribe to find out which.
imma need a link to this trailer
I thought it was gonna be a comedy but it’s like trying to be a horror film-
They always wanna monetize black pain. 🤦🏾‍♀️
Omg who made the potato salad is a hilariously bad movie  I would definitely watch your reaction to that 😂😂.
The trailer feels like they just took every viral video that has come out in the past couple years and made a script out of that. Like someone at BET saw a compilation video and then was like "omg lets make it into a movie!" and here we are
I cant finish this
A social commentary film that downplays the problem is nothing more than propaganda
I was hoping this was fake but it kept getting worse-
I really liked the actress playing Karen before seeing this and i am just.. having a very hard time processing this whole trailer. I'm honestly not that surprised to see a Karen themed horror movie but I dont think i couldve prepared myself for this.   later edit* also didnt know about her acting up irl but....go figure lmao
Does anyone remember the lifetime original movie acceptance where Joan cusack gives the same energy as Karen? Please someone understand
The actual hell? This did not need to be a movie. Especially since black people have enough of this to deal with in day-today life. It’s just like “Hey! You know that collective trauma and fear you guys have around older entitled yt women for upholding systemic racism? That’d be an awesome movie!”
When a bad comedy skit becomes a WHOLE ASS MOVIE 🤣🤣🤣
A Karen movie could have been dope, but this one is definitely a miss.
Right up there with Handmaid’s Tale. Exaggerated nonsense that folks either believe is what life is like, or more how they wish it to be so they can feel morally superior to those with different opinions. 🤦🏼‍♂️
that really did feel like a snl skit that went on way too long.
I feel like this would be much better if it was more subtle, for example her name nOT being Karen, and her kind of denying her racism (like actual racist people do) or, it would be much better if it wasnt made at all because this is already daily life for black people and why does it need to be dramatized 😐
the person who plays karen delivers their lines all the same way. they talk like a robot and they have no emotion
"It's an A" - 3:15 I'm so glad you let us know I was genuinely curious :D
Wow that man who does the ad read is insanely attractive. To bad I’m white.
I hate my life now I summoned the karen end me
The show Them on amazon prime is basically what  this movie wanted to be
Welcome back dangelo, i hope youre doing well ^^
It do be like an SNL skit though
BYEE TARYN MANNING IS GONNA BE IN IT LMAOOO I'M WATCHING IT SOLELY FOR HER   edit: nvm i watched the rest of the vid ....
I can't with this movie I already have to hear about and deal with my peoples struggle I don't wanna have to watch a whole movie about my struggle, STOP ROMANTICIZING BLACK STRUGGLE
I just want to know who exactly thought this would be a good idea...
Why does this movie look like an elongated Dhar Mann video?
Dangelo taron has just been method acting her whole life
I admit, I don't know what it's like to be black and live next to a racist, but why do they act so surprised? "We're living next to a *RACIST!!1!111!!"* Yeah dude I live in Tennessee. I'm pretty sure half my neighborhood racist, then again, I've seen like 10 black people in this city. Maybe it's different in the north (not the amount of black people the amount of racists)
My ASMRtists are better actors than this Karen with her Party City wig.
I do agree. A lot of movies have been taking their cues from Get Out because of its success and originality, but this Karen movie is reeeeaaaaally stretching it. I feel like this could be a good indie comedy
i don’t think they casted appropriately for this film. her acting in OITNB was good for that genre but she doesn’t seem to fit in a horror movie.
It's really strange seeing the actress that plays Karen in such a terrible role. She's actually extremely good at playing a racist in OITNB. Like we KNOW she's better than this role. Wonder how and why she dropped so low?
Karen was in the movie "Crossroads" starting Brittany Spears.
Why does she look like a rtx version of the bee movie lady
getting lost in d'angelo's fanfic-quality eyes ✨
Calling it "Karen" is gonna make people think the movie is a dumb comedy, not something trying to make a statement on racism
It's Taryn Manning though. She's always been a whack-job with questionable acting skills. I've never understood why people keep hiring her, especially after Crossroads.
I think the male versions have been deemed "Kevins" no offense to any Kevin out there.
I heard about this film thanks to the guys of Double Toasted.
i just want him to watch this movie and give a full review tbh
Also, no joke, the fact that you called out their shit English right from the jump is so satisfying I have to change my underwear.
My brain hurts after watching that trailer. Yes we know Karens are covertly racist, but they're soooo much more worse than that, they're petty, stupid, dumb, super loud(seriously, the movie karen needs at least two more boom mikes), homophobic and misogynistic. This trailer just runs on racist cliches and it's tiring to watch
So is now a good time to admit that my 1st name is actually Karen? 🤔
I love how they tried to make it look like Jordan Peele😂
i feel like buying the sponsor just bc of how SMOOTH your transition was
I had so much fun watching this video 😂😂🤣🤣
This movie is the takeaway of a Karen after seeing her first Bill Burr special.
Honestly, I'm a little disappointed. I wasn't expecting the trailer to be any good, but when I recognized Karen being played by the same lady who did Pennsatucky from Orange is the New Black, I thought her acting would at least be a bit better...
They really had one job with the Karen haircut and chose not to do it.
the outro music reminds me of PC games in 2009 lol
Holy crap Taryn Manning is actually her character on Orange is the New Black in real life
Who is this and what have u done with D’Angelo this video is over 10 minutes
There was so much packed in that trailer that it’s basically its own short film
these Britney confirmations have me so sad and so mad
The Karen is played by Taryn Manning, of course the acting is bad.
Are you sure the "suspecting" bit isn't just confusing because it's the only character development we're given and it's still really bad? I got the vibe they were mocking white bourgeois ignorance
I miss when BET movies starred Leon and were about Little Richard or The Temptations.
Are we gonna ignore the fact that Taryn Manning was in Orange is the New Black????
In Orange is the New Black, the actress who played Pennsatucky was great in that show. Why is she so weird here? Her acting feels off just from the trailer alone.
I don't like it at all, it doesn't feel serious and just doesn't sit right with me. It truly feels like a cash out mockery of a serious ongoing issue.
"we're living next to a racist" ma'am we all are
wait, are you married?
“ITS AN  “A” 👁👄👁”- thank you for this🥲♥️
this movie doesnt even feel like a movie, it feels like a youtube original
Is that Sour video still coming? I know it's a little late but I know I'd still love to see it
This topic is the kind of thing that has been addressed in many sitcoms as an episode or two discussing the real-life horrors that POC have to deal with regularly. Usually, how these things can happen, that it's horrible, and how POC (often in general but in this case black people) should try to be confident enough to deal with it. The episodes imply that should set their own boundaries but also accept that some people are just bad and there's not much to do about them.  The idea of making this concept into a whole film that essentially equates these situations to something like murder or torture that would warrant the level of drama presented is more insulting than anything else. It looks like some right-wing self-propaganda movie. As if its point is to say "See how the things black people are afraid of are so minimal, haha we shouldn't feel bad about being racist and abusive towards them haha".
The lead Karen lady possibly being that in real life... No more method acting, please.
oh my god the picture she posted of her as a kid is fucking hilarious to me like lots of straight up bigots reaponses are bland and old and boring but that ones just so silly i laughed. its so dumb its very hilarious. anyway fuck her
Wait, the racist homophobe from Orange is the New Black is actually racist? Damn, no wonder she played that character well 😂😂 Why couldn't she play this Karen well then?
Yayyyyyyyyyyy upload!
Good freaking googely eyes that woman really played the “I had 2 friends of color once so I’m not racist”
I've lived a lot of places in my life. Currently I live in San Antonio. It is genuinely the least racist place I've ever lived. Detroit and Boston were much more racist than San Antonio is. So I'm really not sure why you say South Texas is so racist.
Do NOT start summoning shit with this say it 3 times whackass
Karen looks like those horror edits that were popular a few years ago.
This has to be a comedic horror movie
are we sure this isn’t satire? this cannot be serious.
you ARE a professional that was clean
My name is Karen and I apologize on behalf of this mess
1. there was an ad? 2. Whitewashed racism is exactly EXACTLY what I was trying to think of when I watched it earlier. It's like..... Lifetime network racism? I don't.... How is this even possible
I need a clip of D’Angelo saying you are not the HOA for my neighbor haha. I can’t be the only one.
i mean, meeting a Karen irl is kinda a horror movie
I honestly just got the vibe that they’re trying to portray the type of people who claim they aren’t racist and “try not to be”, but still say extremely insensitive stuff without any regard for others. At least that’s what I got from the beginning of the trailer. But then it really does lose any subtly and what I thought they were going for just got totally scrapped.
I accidentally started your video playing at 2x speed and you sounded like you were doing a Ben Shapiro impression 😂
Taren Manning was in 8 Mile and Hustle and Flow and orange is the new black. She’s also a pretty dope vocalist. What happened?
Well either this will boost ratings (cos I’ll be watching just to agree with D’Angelo) or destroy it 😂
Is this REALLY about a Karen if she doesn't have a teased up, blonde inverted bob though?
I feel like it’s supposed to be a shitty b horror film.
I'm all for depiction of how microagressions are harmful and can cumulate into racial violence. But this is so cartoonish and ridiculous.
It's weird to me that they can't seem to decide if they want to make Karen a shitty closeted racist or if she's a violent white supremacist murderer. I guess if they made it all about a white woman who only commits cruel microaggressions and doesn't think of herself as racist it might hit too close to home for some white viewers. Instead they have to leave saying "oh, well I'm not like her, I'm totally not racist! I would never attempt to murder my neighbours for being Black!"
It's an a cause the movie will make you go "AAAAAAAAA" lol?
The Karen character in this movie is actually played by an actress I like. She was in Orange Is the New Black and her acting can be better than this. I'm just a little disapointed.
She doesn’t come across as a Karen, she reads more as being on meth.
This is The Emoji Movie for adults
I dont understand how this movie would be at all entertaining.
The problem with films like this, depictions of racism written by and for white people, is that it does racism as an individual thing, not a systemic thing. It’s always a Karen that’s being racist it’s never black people facing the actual discrimination black people face. If they face work discrimination, it’s at the hands of a bad guy boss. It they face discrimination in their neighborhoods, it’s because of a racist neighbor. They never discuss the societal reasons for why these things happen. Does the film go into why there are these rich white neighborhoods that don’t have any black peoples in them? That foster these racists? Like does the film go into racism in policing and white people weaponizing that at all or is it all this one racist lady being unreasonable? I’m guessing it’s the latter. I may be being presumptuous, but I’m guessing the best they do to criticize the police is by doing the “bad cop” thing.
“Did you do it?” Yeah! “If so, you’re now…. a fool.” Oh… “Because you’ve SUMMONED HER” wait-
This trailer looks like an snl skit..
Wtf. Who came up this shit...
They need to make Karen a horror flick instead with her being obsessed with black people stalking them and stab them or going to stores and having neighbors make her so angry all the time she snaps and kills her family or a store manager—this was a good concept and the main actress used to actually be a really good actor. Missed opportunity. They definitely shouldn’t have re-enacted real scenarios that’s happened in the news or explicit stereotypes.
Your videos always make me smile—even through the cringe. It’s the voice and the look and the little side comments for me
And now for the ad read by lil tecca
really mad she was in hustle & flow 😭
I have to disagree with your point about this sort of racism... you want overt obvious racism.... we have so many films about this. The execution of this film WACK AF *BUT* the way racism is so microaggressive these days needs to be addressed, this film ain't doing it, but it would be nice to see a film that executes the subtle everyday racism that people look at and say "that's not racism" just bc someone didn't say the n-word with the hard -R-.
yo dude nice vid! this movie is actually the worst
I said “Karen character“ too many times incorrectly and accidentally summoned a carrot cake. 🍰
7:01 BET is notorious for their asinine amount of censorship. To the point where they'll even dub over movies to remove the swears, but you can still see the actors mouth it. There are whole skits poking fun at the lenths they go to get that sweet sweet PG rating. Check out LongBeachGriffys video ("BET be like"), its hilarious and perfectly encapsulates how whack their standards are (their being BET).
It was a good idea when  Camp Nos made it first. This whole movie is plagiarized.
This is like an SNL skit lmao
the hair in front of his eyes during the ad read makes me SO uncomfy, how was that not bothering him ndjdksk
Tbh fuck that dumb shit just happy to see my boy BACK 💖💖💖
That trailer is the worst thing I've ever seen 🙈
I’m so glad you are back! You’re emotional and mental health is important 💜💜💜 And I expected more than this lame acting from someone who was on OITNB!  I spy a ring on on the left ring finger 👀
“This gives opportunity for people to say, “see racism is a joke and it’s not serious” and I’m like... here we go again” AND AS I LOOK AT THE COMMENTS FROM (IM SURE) ALL THESE LIBERALSSSS IM LYYYKE “HERRRRRE WE GOOOO AGAAAIN” 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄😑 racism isn’t funny and shouldn’t be used as entertainment yet we’re the only race who is gets done to.... Coincidence 🤔
You have been missed!
I saw the trailer and while the actual idea isn’t bad the execution of it looks terrible. The bad acting, bad writing, low budget and most likely terrible script will just make it worse 😂😂😂
Anybody else think the karen was played by Lindsay Lohan?  Just me?
The movie just seems like a bunch of YouTube videos about Karens being Karen-like. With "creepy" movies and credits at the beginning and end. No real substance..
Discount code Jordan Peele directed Karen
When me and my black family moved into our new house in the suburbs, a lady from down the street was yelling literal CURSES at our home like a month later. Literal SPELLS y’all!!😭
Taryn Manning... from 'Hustle and Flow', to 'Karen'. If Hollywood is going to try and tackle racism, via the _KaReN_ route, let's at least make it realistic.
D'Angelo, I don't know if this "news" arrived at USA or anything but here in Brazil we actually had a well known singer that woke up his wife in the middle of the night asking for a divorce hahah
Why does Karen look like a white Camila Mendes
The only thing I liked is the young man doing a sponsor
didnt the chick play pensatucky in orange is the new black ? her acting was pretty great there what is going on here 😕
the funny thing is the opening line of the trailer is a lie.... a lot of those low budget "urban" production companies film in a nice neighborhood that's not very far from east point 😂
This movie is just "How you do, fellow kids?" personified.
That’s the girl from orange in the new black though right?
it’s sad because the Karen was good in orange is the new black
OH WAIT you know that feeling when you're the only POC in a group of white people and they start talking about their friends or relatives that are racist or islamophobic or whatever? And you're just there like "uh- ok. I am uncomfortable"? That is the exact same vibe I get from that movie
Shes a QANON supporter? Hell. No. I have a soft spot for poorly produced B-movies of all sorts, but no.
this planet has been suffering for 4.8 billion years.
it looks like it was made on imovie
That’s the chick from hustle and flow
It has to be some kind of satire, it has to be.
WAS THAT ISSA RAE
already subscribed to the secret channel at 100k
Didn’t one of the Wayans brothers do a parody movie like this already?
STRAW MAN WON.
Nuance. That’s what’s missing.
Istg D’angelo when are you going to show off your cast in your videos, I mean that plant needs some clout too!
3:34 why did this reminds me of Dora?
omg i've never been subscribed to a youtuber who also lives in south texas why does this make me happy and i DO NOT support racists or racism ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️
Why does the actress that plays Karen look like the actress from orange is the new black
Ok yup.. it’s official.. horror movies are a total drag nowa days. 🤦🏽‍♀️
Omg Pennsyltucky is karen!
D'Angelo…did you witness the birth of the world? If you did, I would like to know why water is so freakin heavy. Especially in a bucket. Thanks.
Pensatucky! (OITNB)
My version of the movie :  It was a simple town until the manager’s son was skating on the road and then...it appeared to destroy this peaceful town once again   The name : Karen’s conjuring
i’m white not american so i’m not in the place to really judge but really though? first of all this movie is instantly bound to become a meme of sorts when you call it “karen”. i agree that the acting looks off, in fact everything feels weird when watching the trailer. i don’t like that a movie about racism look like a prank youtube video, doesn’t that add to the problem?  also i feel so bad for anyone named karen
You faced problems like the couple in that trailer every time you moved somewhere new? That is... truly depressing.
D’angelo: I want to say as someone who suffers with depression and has for years : seeing you, a super funny, talented, smart person who also suffers from depression shows me that there’s nothing inherently wrong with me , and that I can still be successful, funny, smart too. Thank you for being open.
The ad read made my fucking week.
The thing is, someone like Jordan Peele could totally make a "Get Out"-esque horror film about karens, talking about white women tears and entitlement and show that sometimes the racism that isn't as blatant is the most insidious, but this is just...like who would want to watch this lmao
The money that went into this movie could have gone towards groups that aid the African American community? hahahaha wtf
That’s the girl from orange in the new black though right?
Nothing appealing about this...nothing! I can't believe someone would be stupid enough to make a movie based off of these real life psychotic, incurably self-entitled ww who call the police on us because they're hoping a cop will do something evil to us 😕🤢😤
“Karen” was Pennsatucky in oitnb and she was great in that, not this though😬
plEASE SAY THIS IS A PRANK WHY IS IT REAL
I was kinda curious why an actress from Orange Is The New Black would take such a bs script. Not a really well known actor but I’ve seen some from that show do other decent roles in decent movies/tv series. It became obvious when you got into her background. Probably doesn’t have many other options lmao.
Jokes on you, i couldn't even say it twice b4 my brain shut off
Is this not a spoof??? Omg! How ridiculous is this? And offensive in soooooo many ways to so many different people. White or black, it’s just offensive.
Yikes this movie really ain’t it
It actually feels like a comedy, and the fact that it takes itself so seriously makes it that much funnier
d'angelo why are you not in the commentary-youtuber-smp?
The point of horror is to allow enough distance from real fears that it allows us to practice processing those feelings. When you just depict real, literal violence, with no exaggeration or commentary it isn't horror; it's a snuff film.
Karen is Pennsatucky from Orange is the New Black lol
The movie could have done much better! Definitely is a big flop 🤣
I... I thought this was fake
“what is that? like, an f sharp?” okay charlie puth calm down✋
oh BET makes black trauma porn now??? giving y’all away in the race wars bye 🚪👩🏿‍🦯
it's... awful
welcome back!!
the karen actor was on orange is the new black
Also I feel like they are trying to make money off of racism?? Like because they know a lot of people are against it and that’s their target audience right? Idk feels wrong.
I'm one of the first 100Kon the new channel!!! Yay!!!
I feel the rawness of reality cuts deeper than something fabricated to try and synthesize that same effect
We already have this Karen movie... every time a white person is recorded being a shitty, racist person to a POC who is doing nothing wrong.
I'm crying at how flat the movie looks. Overexposed and awfully colour graded. Looks truly abysmal.
That word was written into the script, I'm sure, to make the Karen sound dumb while she's being a serious nuisance, lol.
Like I said on another legendary channel, we're probably one big sitcom to some aliens up in space.
I worked at a public library and the director's name was Karen...and her brother was a cop...and she had multiple divorces to cops...and yes, she acted like a "Karen".  She was tolerable some days, but most days she belittled workers and patrons.
I think that it shows basically the entire movie just in the trailer and it wasn’t even good😂
0:12 same  Also speaking of films does anyone know of any good ones in cinemas now cos ye
is it just me or thumbnail looks like Baga Chipz
Gangsta Rap: The Glockumentary
I can only assume someone found a toe in the potato salad 😐
Why did they do Pennsatucky like that 😭😭
This is like if Dhar Mann started making R-rated films
Is no one gonna talk bout how the Karen character is Pennsuhtucky from Orange Is the New Black????
The girl playing Karen looks like an aged out Lindsay Lohan with the acting skills of Tara Reid
My husband showed me this trailer and I kept waiting for the "Funny or Die" logo to pop up. I seriously didn't believe it was for real.
watched this trailer with a black friend. cringing the entire time😬
Nobody will watch this 'film'
i mean the actress terrified me in oitnb, so this is not a stretch
You on the piano 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I JUST made it into the under 100K club, be quick to secure your spots! The channel is growing!
I thought this was satire at first, this can’t be real
You gonna apologize to Peaches?
With all of the Karens in the news already, 100% skipping this movie. The Wendy Williams show played the ad, I think, and I was not amused nor excited.
From a writer’s perspective this concept had so much potential to be great, but instead what we got is this weird caricature of what a good political commentary should be
I have people friend(s) how can I be a murder? 😃🤔
I legitimately thought it was a SNL sketch when I saw it on Twitter
Omg I couldn’t figure out where I recognized her from until you said her name. She is from Orange is the new black. What a step down.
The sit down and wait moment made me think about Dora the explorer  🤣
Proud to be on of the community tab less than 5k gang and subbed to you when you were an art channel 🤷🏻‍♀️
I like the actress who plays Karen (I like her work), I think her work's phenomenal, but this movie was a mistake.  Edit; I read some other comments, sounds like she's been landing some roles that don't showcase her talent. What the heck is up with her agent?
My thoughts on this movie you ask?  *What* (And I cannot stress this enough) *The Fuck*
OMG ITS MY FAVORITE CHARACTER FROM ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK
Dis feels particularly more exploitative and tone-deaf than movies usually tend to be…
In fairness to the Karen, the dad from Get Out didn't realize that "I would have voted for Obama a third time" was supposed to be a joke
barely in first 100k subscribers to the secret channel
Is that Pennsatucky???
He’s not wrong. This feels like a joke that’s trying to take itself seriously. Lol
The Glockumentury lmaoooooooooo
If you don’t believe something like a confederate flag soap dispenser exists, go to a hobby lobby.
i hated everything about this, but i love u king 🥺
BRO I LOVE MORNING BREW I JUST SUBSCRIBED TO THEM AND NOW I AM NOT BORED WITH MY LIFE
this movie feels like a "starving games" style parody of current events
I would have loved to see the antagonist played as a Stepford Wife type whose mask slips as she devolves into cussing, threats and slurs... Showing her true ugliness. And all the while, she views herself as the "perfect, good, God-fearing woman", who "only wants what's best for her community".
Oh shit that trailer was fucking real I thought it was a parody or some type of SNL skit
"I am.... a professional" 💥
Okay I tried dangelo I really tried to watch I really really tried I can’t the cringe is to much  ;—;
“Oh No” brought to you by BET 🤣🤣🤣 #clasic 😭😭
Karen is the🦄 of 🗺 domination we’ve all been waiting for 😩
Karen Walker from Will & Grace 😱
Tbh i knew he was gonna call me a fool.....
D’Angelo is immortal....
Pennastucky reincarnated into a movie about Karens. We live in the worst timeline. 😔
This is pr0n for white nationalists... Eww.
"We are living next to a racist." I'm white, so I might be wrong, but aren't most poc living next a racist? Like that seems like a sad fact of life for any minority. My neighbor's super homophobic, and you kind of get used to people hating you for existing. Difference being that my neighbor can't tell I'm queer on sight.
No black person asked for this
Noooo, I mean I love your videos but now I’m getting BET ( Black Evil Television) ads.
This is about as much of the movie that I’m going to watch.
I love you and your vids, but CinemaSummary is the king of smooth ad transitions
D'Angelo's bits and comedic timing hit so hard on these not live streamed videos
As if Soros money was needed to make white people look bad
I SUBBED TO YOUR SECRET CHANNEL WHEN YOU HAD 99.1 THOUSAND, I MADE IT!!!!!!!
Is that the girl from Orange is the New Black?! Girlie, what happened?!
I can't tell if this is a comedy or horror...
honest opinion, that was the dumbest trailer ive ever seen...especially after all the racism and police brutality that has occurred within the last year. this movie should not be watched, it portrays incorrect displays of racism and brutality that is real and occurs every day.
Seeing this trailer makes me speechless except for just “ew”.
It’s official folks, Jordan Peele is the only one allowed to make social commentaries now.
HOLY SHIT! THAT'S PENSATUCKY FROM OITNB
Pennsatucky!?!?
Made it at 99k 😎
He's back!
Honestly I lowkey expected this from Doggett
Even more interesting when you remember she's the ratchet girl with braids from Hustle & Flow
I think ur being too hard on the trailer. Its the perfect meme for Karens in movie format! Lol
Ngl the transition into the ad was smooth
I greatly appreciate artists and believe they should be paid for their work, but if this movie was a theatrical release that I ever considered watching, I would buy a bootleg copy.
The guy in the first secne!
Omg how tf could Tarren do,this! This movie will cost her, her career. Omg the wrong ppl have been made famous
me: "mom can we watch Blackkklansman and Get Out?" mom: "no we have Blackkklansman and Get Out at home" Blackkklansman and Get Out at home:
Is it just me or did his commentary get way better?  Also who made the trailer? You could Letterbox and Color Correct the picture to make it look halfway decent, but it legit looks like raw iPhone footage.
Just kinda waiting for D’Angelo to say .. haha just kidding this is a prank. But omg no, someone actually made this movie. 🤦🏻‍♀️
The best ad transitions on YouTube *slow clap with tears*
It looks like they told Taryn to play this character as if Pennsatucky never went to jail.
What keyboard is that?
This just kinda makes me feel yucky... I don't know how this stuff gets approved
Lol I hope Morning Brew wasn't paying Angelo a whole lot of money because it's pretty clear he never has and never will use the service 😂 I understand he's going after that bag but that was hella cringe
me searching for your new account but not seeing it anywhere?!? can someone halppp
Wow, apparently Pennsatucky is real desperate for work now that Orange is the New Black is over 😂
Missed you
NO DON’T SAY YOUR ADDRESS THEY WILL FIND YOU OMG I HOPE YOU ARE OKAY
Hi D'Angelo! Keep posting homie
The sunken place, sounds like the name of a great movie
4:33
Whoa… Taryn you were one of my favorite characters on OITNB… I’m not fw it
161k people have said "Karen character" out loud in the last 3 hours.
Remember American history x?? Why didn't yall take some notes??
That amazing Segway kind of filled my the Julien Podcast Segway hole that's been in my heart. Amazing
I'm so glad you're back!!! ☺️☺️☺️
They were purposely going for cringe
Did y’all see BET Original Film…
Look at how they massacred Get Out! 😭
His segue into the ad read was just delightful
I lost it when I saw the confederate flag on the soap. This movie is a joke.
Is that Pennsatucky??
this movie feels like not a single black person participated in the writing of this script cuz jfc....
Every time I see the cloud background and remember you painted and animated that 100% I'm very impressed and think about how cool of you that is
If you want to watch an actual good video about karens...  https://youtu.be/NfBVMiIfJZU
The noose in K is the most on the nose thing ever.
i didn't even recognize her, except for the voice. she doesn't look strung out
Not Pennsatucky 😭
It is not racist to suggest there are ulterior motives to the "BLM riots". You think the race card played for divide and conquer is a new thing? Fucking living in a hole? Late 80s Serbian/Bosnian conflict? Just about every other conflict. Politics. Left/Right. Demo/Repub. Black/White.  I suppose I should inquire as to what you believe the issues to be, but certainly my above statements hold water. Cheers mate.  *edit* a letter.
I didn't even see the movie and I already love it. The trash can is the best actor so far!
Plz share what your background music is it sounds pretty  fire
Is it too late for them to get their money back on this?
I think there have been films that portray racism in a horror genre very well (as you mentioned Get Out.) But this movie: 1. Comes off like a parody or satire other than actual movie. 2. Is quite literally a trashy rip off of a movie with Samuel L. Jackson who plays a police officer and stalker stuff with a few scenes shown.
My friends sent me this trailer this morning and what do you know heres a video about it from one of my fav creators.
I lost it at “the glockumentary” LMFAOOOO
I would rather watch offended Karen’s get offended about being called Karen’s on Facebook than this movie.
WOW how sad 😢
c0mment1ng f0r @lg0r1th1m! people deserve financial compensation for seeing this awful trailer, also I wish you success in your plans of world domination ;)
Karen karenter
this movie feels like it was written by a Karen to try and prove she wasn’t racist in the same way that she says “I have a black friend”
part of the first 100k lets go (D'angelo you are our lord)
A confederate flag soap dispenser??? What?
D’Angelo you don’t get it, she’s method acting for this film!!!!/j
Casting directors have basically told Taryn Manning her that her archetype is “ignorant”
If y'all want an Australian focused alternative to morning brew, sign up for The Daily Aus! It's free, independent, completely online and isn't controlled by Murdoch media hehehe
Your shirt looks like bowling for soup.
Giving me very dollar store _Get Out_
See I think the actress knows her character is a racist, and because she isn’t as overt as the character, she doesn’t think she herself is racist.  But her core BELIEFS prob line ip with the character’s
"they white washed racism" oh god
The actress who plays Karen, I only know her from Orange is the New Black. And she played that character soooo well because she was supposed to be an idiotic strung out methhead. So her slurring and stumbling on words worked well. I thought her acting was incredible... But she's doing the same stuff here. For a completely different character. Hmm.
lol break the fourth wall more often, i literally love you so much
Not BET 😖
Oh no. The orange is the new black chick is playing a Karen.
Karens wig was so bad😭
this film is trying to be get out without understanding why get out works.
The trailer itself failed at the title. Like the tweet said, it should be us drawing the conclusion from snippets of the movie, not blasting the message right off the bat. I've seen fake Youtube pranks more subtle than this ._.
They did NOT do Pennsatucky like that 😒
free my people man
You said “insanely attractive” and I wasn’t disappointed 😽
I got a BET ad while watching this
Lmao, I love that plot twist about her actually being the head of something.
OK BUT THE AMOUNT OF RACIST ROLES TARYN HAS PLAYED IS A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR WHO SHE IS??? LIKE SHE WAS IN ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK USING AAVE AND OTHER STUFF TOWARDS THE OTHER BLACK CHARACTERS LIKE???????
As a black girl named Taryn, this is awkward.
I feel like Them already did the racist, over the top white lady neighbor trope slightly better.
they really be trying to make get out again
When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was a College Humor or FunnyorDie spoof trailer. I can’t believe this is a real movie.
Honestly it’s like Amy Poehlers character from Parks and Rec did a skit to teach the people of Pawnee not to be a Karen.
She's better in orange is the new black
that's pensatucky from orange is the new black...why do they always give her the racist roles....
He’s kinda right about southern Texas. There’s been way too many situations where I’ve encountered officers that stop me for walking because I “fit the description” and a bunch of racist spray painted the N-word and KKK on the sides of school buses when we went to certain school football games in the sticks…
Being hyper aware of their LARPing is so spot on. It does feel like they're just trying to remember their lines on the spot lol
was Coke on coke when he wrote this because the mans was definitely on something
Isn’t she the girl from crossroads with Britney Spears? (The Karen)
I for one, am tired of seeing black people suffering. Why does this movie exist??? Also she uses the word "comply" at least twice in this trailer. Is she hydra or something? I can't-
Looking at her, pretty sure if I say her name 3 times she'll be at my window at midnight snack time. I'm gonna have to pass 😅
Oh my god they could have done some kind of amazingly insane horror movies about Karens and THIS?????
Can we just talk about how GREAT dangelos eyebrows look 👀 I’m wondering if he’s tweezing or waxing. I could see him waxing 😎
Isn't that the girl from prange is the new black???
This is bad snl skit (cut for time) acting yeesh
Why does this movie exist again-
It seems like an SNL spoof
8:35 voicecrack
is there a Karen unsubscribing me from this channel? But I keep resubbing tirelessly!
When he said potato was spelled wrong on the movie,"who made the potatoe salad?" I instantly thought it had to be spelled that way because whoever made it left a toe in it.... I need sleep, lol.
Why pensatucky? Why?! 😂😂
Did I really hear at the end of the trailer "bad things happen to people who don't comply"😐
i feel like the basic concept of a karen horror movie could be a great horror comedy but they really really really didnt have to try to make some statement about racism. sure that could be an element but it shouldnt be the entire point. if anything it should be more about classism and maybe ageism since most karens think young people are bad, but mostly classism. would be funny if it was like a karen there during the day ordering food or something and then the manager refuses to speak to her and she huffs off and after hours she busts in the windows and crawls around on the walls and is like "i said. i wanted to speak to a MANAGER" and like tries to kill the employee or smth. that would be a way better way to make a karen movie rather than whatever the hell this is
I saw this trailer and thought it was fake or some kind of parody of another movie it’s just weird
The real horror is that some fake trailers are real trailers.
As an old white guy, I love you young man !!
I feel like this concept had potenial, but i feel like they fed into memes to much and it was poorly excuted.
i really thought this was fake and then i hoped it was, and i am now very disappointed that this is not fake.
yeahhh id think id rather watch get out or parasite or us. also sorry i couldnt say karen character, i was eating takis and drinking water at the same time (my first time having takis ok? im not experienced).
As a professional Karen and racist, this made me cringe. I am so much more violent than this, smh
You have returned👑 lol good to see you frand🥰 you inspire me🥰
It's not just white people who are Karens. Anyone of any race can be one. You just need to have a distain for anyone who is working class/in retail, a love of bullying people for existing, and a sense of entitlement.
I'm so excited for this to drop on Lifetime this summer. 🙄
The actress who plays Karen actually has been in some good shows and movies. Like orange is the new black. Surprisingly her character was a racist too. 🤔
Karrenfying
Fuck I hate that she was on Orange is the New Black also it’s a coincidence that she is related to her character
i kinda wonder if the concept behind this issue might work way better as a horror comedy rather than straight horror
That person who said it felt like an SNL skit is right on the money. I feel the same way about it. Watching the trailer I felt like it was going to turn out to be like a Scary Movie kinda situation where it's meant to be like a Jordan Peele knockoff but then it's like, a real movie that wants to be taken seriously? I think?
this is like what someone would show their white parents to try and subtly hint that their friends are racist lol
…
Former Vice President Dan Quayle officially changed the spelling to potatoe in 1992.
Made it into the first 100K subs. My life is complete.
Wait that’s Pennsatucky
Already subscribed to the other channel.
My sister Karen is gonna be pissed. How do you defend yourself against a Karen?
@D’Angelo Wallace a actual good show that is worth watching that depicts racism in America was the show on Amazon prime called ‘THEM’
when he says the new channel has 88k but you were in the first 100 :0
he has returned
I bet "Who Made the Potatoe Salad" is about potato salad infested with toes.
17k likes 74 dislikes
get out is really amazing, im glad i watched it without watching any trailers
Me after saying Karen Character 10 times ":("
Watch when the movie comes out and they try to tag it as satire because of all the criticism it's getting now 😂
It would have been better if the police office brother was named Kevin
The movie looks pretty dumb. I won’t be seeing it. Ever.
Holy F. Leave my name alone🙄🙄🙄🙄🤦🏾‍♀️
Taryn Manning is a much better actress than this movie deserves. She doesn't seem to act this with seriousness. With a better screenwriter and creative design, this horror show could have been a movie we didn't know we needed. Now it's just a nightmare we never wanted.
Soooo confused by the main actress' .... terrible acting.  She was really good in Orange is the New Black -- seemingly terrible direction on the part of this Coke Daniels fellow.  Are we surprised after such hits as his GLOCKUMENTARY?!  Sheesh.  What a load of walmart-brand Get Out nonsense.
This has to be a joke. It’s like a racist parody film. Wtf
I’m not black so I feel like it’s not my place to talk, but this movie leaves a bad taste in my mouth. Like why are we using the struggles of everyday black people for money rather than doing anything about it.
Just watch the Youtube Channel, "Karens in the Wild". Saved you some money.
I don't care what anyone says, this movie will end up categorized in comedy. Somewhere with Scary Movie, Shaun of the Dead, Zombie Strippers... There will be a population who enjoy it.
that title card was HIDEOUS who designed that I just wanna talk
welcome back <3
Her acting only worked in Orange is the new black because she was playing a drug addict.
That trailer straight up looked like a parody I'd see here on youtube Edit: I looked the director up and not only is he white, he's wearing a fedora on his IMDB picture. I can't make this shit up
"Did you do it?" yep! "Congratulations! You're a fool." aw. :(
Honestly, I don't understand the purpose of this movie? Like, usually there's a point and a story to be told, but I can't tell what it is for this. Anyone else confused??
super inappropriate
Pennsatucky no!
Some actors really love being in movies and TV shows and never grasping the message from it because I guess to them it's just a job.   Elizabeth Moss in a show about religus cults while believing in scientology   Taryn Manning being anti BLM and pro Trump after being in Orange is the New Black
“Same effect, much cheaper” damn. As usual. You right.
I mean she wasn’t wrong about the blm movements being funded by George Soros. The fact that nobody can see that we are divided by the media and the higher ups is pretty pathetic. While us normal civilians argue about identity politics, the rich get richer, America falls into a toilet, kids are being sex trafficked, etc. And all we can argue about is race. In 2021.
At this point the term became so cringy. I literally saw an older white woman on Twitter calling a younger brown woman Karen just for being GC lmao
I can just tell that this movie was written by a white person and it should have written by a black person who's wrongfully experienced the things in this movie.
First 100k ✨❤️
watch this become something like Ma (2019) and get its reputation for accidently being funny😭✋🏾
Me the whole video: That’s Tiffany Doggett from "Orange is the New Black".
97.2k on the secret channel. https://youtube.com/channel/UCTrLCM86b-0eOVDSyJtCMYA
I had seen videos about this film pop up in my recommended but I just thought it was some Dhar mann video or something… and well this is just Dhar mann with a bigger budget
Creepshow art?
The #breadceumbs at 11:51 SENT me 😭 Like she could at least proofread
SUBBED BEFORE 100k!!!
Lol when you mentioned the other endeavor I was like......wtf you gonah do with an only fans.
before i watch the video my impression: a movie about a karen? THAT SOUNDS SO BORING LOL
This trailer kind of looks like an snl skit about a dramatic racist movie
Pensatucky from orange is the new black is karen...that kinda checks out
Oh god if anyones gonna watch this do not pay for it, the hate money is what it wants...
he's back!!!!!!!!
This trailer makes me wanna move to Pluto.
MY LORD AND SAVIOR IS BACK
Ugh, smells like Cuties again except with racists this time instead of p*dos. In an effort to make some kind of statement against a bad thing, they wind up portraying the bad thing without any meaningful commentary, thereby backfiring against the “intended message” and catering to the interests of incredibly disgusting people.
Isn't Karen the person who played Tiffany, the crazy Christian girl, from Orange is the New Black?  What is this timeline?
This is like… SNL intentional parody levels of bad acting
If "I'm not racist, I have black friends" was a person:
where. is. the. cosplay.
I honestly think it'd be more interesting if they made a comedy movie about a Karen. They can be riculous and hilarious in their own right. Maybe it could use comedy to touch on the issues that the karens present
this would have been so much better as a comedy movie tbh. I think a horror movie is a bit too much.
Before your mention of Taryn Manning playing "Karen", I kept thinking to myself:   "Man, that sure looks a lot like Pennsatucky from OITNB,"   She was racist in that show as well, but at least her acting was considerably better. Hmmm
I’m 90% sure that the woman who plays the Karen character is the same actress who plays Pensatucky in OITNB which is fucking hilarious to me
What in the actual fuck is this.
0:12 This confirms it I had my suspicions  But this does it D'Angelo is a god
My mom's been talking about this movie since she saw the trailer. She really wants to watch it.
I like TV shows and movies where the acting is so good I forget it's a movie ...and this was not it😗
They wanted the Karen to be really authentic
It's really really odd to me that now Karen is a racist thing when they most of the time attack just anyone at all in their general vicinity that oppose their worldview. Not all Karens are racist, but I'm pretty sure they all are mentally unwell and need a lot of help. It's part of why we don't watch Karen compilations any longer in my household. It's like watching and mocking mental illness. NOT EXCUSING THE RACIST ONES AT ALL. That racist garbage is gross no matter what...
k but the actress who plays karen is so good normally so idk who to blame here other than the writers
I don't think many people talk about this but using the name Karen as an insult is very problematic on its own. My teacher, her name's Karen and she might as well be the funniest, silliest and happiest person I know. Idiots in my class have associated her with the fact that she's a Karen and it's visible on her face how hurtful it is. I feel horrible for all the kind people out there called out for being named Karen when they aren't the people being racist and an annoyance to society.   My opinion, thought I'd call it out. Any Karen by genuine name, I'm sorry.
bold of you to ask me to subscribe to an empty channel
you are wonderful and were missed...even if it was only 3 weeks.
Part of the 100,000 ❤❤
I barely passed my theatre classes...in 2006....and can act better than this. My God. This is awful. Everything was a bad idea! Done is poor taste alllll around. I cant believe this is real and actually being put out there by BET none the less. Even when you feel NOTHING can reay surprise me anymore...Im in complete shock!
Karen’s actress is Doggett from oitnb…. Wtf happened
I guess i am the only on anticipating this masterpiece.
She's not even a bad actress she played Tiffany in orange is the new black and was amazing  Problematic person yes but not a bad actor so I don't know why this is so bad d
As soon as I saw “BET Original Movie” I knew we were in for a whole mess
I've noticed that people don't like this movie because it's making money off black trauma (so why I don't like it) or it's racists denying that this doesn't happen in real life  and it's hating yt people.
the Karen actress is from orange is the new black! her character, pensatucky, is dont really well, so idk why her acting is so bad in this lmao
What is that? Like an F sharp? ITS AN A!!!!  *moves on completely**  😂😂😂😂😂
A Karen being the central focus, even in a film about how bad Karen are, is the most Karen thing ever. If you wanted to make a film about the actual issue wouldn't it make sense to highlight the negative impact they have on the people around them? Nah... it has to be about the white people and how they feel.
finna be the dumbest film ever
I think they used the word "suspecting" as they did to highlight how the Karen-type thinks they are smarter than they are. Could have been done better with another term, but that's my take.
You are unreal, best ad read of all time.
Taryn always plays a racist character. Weird.
When actors are actually as horrible as the characters they play it’s really scary bc they’re probably not even acting in the film :(
the acting in this trailer makes “ma” look good😵
This is ONISION acting. That's just how bad this trailer is.
I just haven't gotten to the point where I can find any entertainment value in racism.
3:39 well I guess I won't be sleeping tonight 😐
I can’t tell if this movie is supposed to be a parody or it’s really bad at trying to be serious.
do you like my pfp
The video is good. The movie should be billed as a comedy.
I sorry but I need to cringe watch the film, it looks awful and I want to see it crash and burn (maybe I should do a reaction video so people dont have to give money to this mess lol)
i'm spending the summer in Austin TX from NYC just for fun - and I while I do like a lot of things about this city so far, I've both witnessed and experienced the kind of casual racism that really takes me back to my suburban childhood and it's probably the only 'weird' part of Austin.
Don't even hate watch this honestly, just watch Get Out or Blindspotting. Better use of your time and money. Unless you have too much time on your hands and love piracy in which case, godspeed brother.
i lost it at glockumentary
oh good!! another movie profiting off of black peoples trauma and suffering!!!
Why make a Karen movie when we have Reddit
I deliberately watched the trailer before watching this, just to get my own opinion first. It did not change at all, needless to say, and probably wouldn't have made a difference.
Why is this real?
For those who are trying to figure out how they recognize the “Karen” actress, she was on “Orange is the New Black”. Also, check out her Wikipedia, it’s wild. She has a history of violence against her partners and is an alcoholic. Which probably proves my assumption that she was drunk during filming cause it sounds like she’s slurring her words.
Long beach griffy lowkey predicted the karen movie cuz of taryn manning
naw cus thats the racist homophobic tiffany from oitnb
i loved the ad transition
The longer D’Angelo talks about this movie the worse the movie sounds. Not only is this movie unnecessary but.. BET made it. And is that pucket from OITNB..? This. is. a. lot. to. unpack.
Not gonna lie this trailer was funny asf.
PLL fans.. He found A 😂
Twist... Karen has a twin named Pennsatucky
welcome back♡ also, oof.
i’m sensing music project
Holy shit is that pennsatucky from oitnb?!
not gonna lye, but that transition into the sponsor was smooth
"IT AN A"
I'm a fool
I feel like a slow burn psychological piece akin to The Assistant would be a better approach to a Karen movie.... Or like strait up supernatural like It Follows....
Oh my gosh its Pensatucky!! Edit: oh no... I didnt know she was like that in real life....
This movie seems to portray diet racism. The mild flavor without the calories. No depth. I immediately thought it was satire..
😂😂😂 the Dora-esque vibe when he got me to say ‘Keren Character’ 😂
fun fact: BET is no longer a black enterprise.
Karenkarakterkarenkarakterkarenkaracter
an actual documentary analyzing the problems with how rich/upper class white women treat black people would be interesting and helpful imo, but definitely not a mediocre horror movie like this
It's like an snl skit..
Holy shit this is so embarrassing lol I hate that I’m alive at the same time as this “movie”
Okay so i found this trailer pretty... funny. But that's from my white ass and seeing that many people of color pointing out how this downplays and males light of their experience gives me second thoughts about a portrayal like this.
This movie just by the trailer, seemingly addressed *nothing* How many times does directors and media outlets have to glorify our trauma and tribulations just for entertainment? Jordan Peele could’ve used this concept and made it better (which he did with Get Out.) Smh.
this movie does not know the definition of 'nuance'
"as a black people in America" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I lost it at glockumentary
Omg that the girl from Orange is the new black lol
as an obviously trans and everything that karens hate, they’re so funny to make as mad as possible by just defending yourself and then have them make a threat and pretend to be audio recording/video recording the whole thing /g
“Karen” is played by the same actor who played  a crack head in Orange is the new black. Interesting career choice
Bro it looks like a extra low Redbox movie
This feels like a bad SNL skit....
This acting is on the level of a CW drama. It doesn’t seem like it has any depth.
I saw this trailer and thought it was a gag, like a joke about Karen, but when it kept going, and realized that it was real, I was disgusted
Bruh me and D’Angelo must have the same neighbors. We’re also in Texas so it’s possible 😐
You should watch/review THEM on Amazon prime. I would love to know if you feel like that show is doing the same thing as this movie. Thoughts anyone?
My thoughts on the trailer are, “No, thank you” ✌️
They really have Tiffany from Orange is the New Black as Karen I knew her voice sounded familiar
Wait... is the Karen character the meth chick from Orange is the New Black?! 😂
whoa its pennsatucky
Thats the girl from orange is the new black
I did it…now a white woman is yelling at me and calling the cops
I saw an article where Taryn Manning said she felt she had a social responsibility to play this role even if she had to be the villain to affect change. Girl no. You should have done a better acting job then. Just in those clips you can see this thing is a train wreck. Seriously. Sit down.
wtf even with this ‘film’ an insult to all films.
making a humorous horror movie about ‘karens’ is like not my taste of humour but couldve been done fine. but making it about racism and police brutality, thats a yikes from me. like, just make it about ppl who work in the service industry if u want to make the meme
this is what happens when tiktok gets its grabby hands on it. Karen has been a meme for like 15 years and then it goes viral on tiktok and now karen is a slur and money grab?? same thing happened to boomer sighghh
I mean... The movie doesn't need to go to an extreme with racism, especially not with a hard R. If the media did that all the time, then that'd give the impression that that is what racism is. Sometimes racism is just like what the movie is portraying... A person harassing someone based on their race. Both are realistic and there's not a whole lot wrong with the movie choosing to do so.  EDIT  That being said, I'm not interested in the movie. I thought it was going to be a Karen comedy/parody.
Morning Brew reminds me of my favourite newsletter The Bullet
The world was created in 2012. Everything before that was false memories.
“It’s an A” lmaoooo
How do things like this make it past the first pitch? I’m white and could never understand the shit black people and other people of color go through and i can immediately see this is bad anyway like any normal person should?
The fucking NOOSE in the LOGO made my jaw drop
"insert the age of the world, i don't remember the exact day i saw it created" HELLO???? ARE WE JSUT. ACCEPTING THAT
Is that just a ring or a wedding band 👀
Nah, Micarah has the smoothest ad transition of the week.
That guy who read the morning brew ad made me feel a lil homoromantic y'all. Lemme get his number.
I’m so sick of these shallow Get Out ripoffs. What makes Get Out excellent is that it’s a nuance about various topics and issues that black people face in America, along with constant symbolism and foreshadowing along with excellent script writing and everything else. And most importantly, ITS NOT BLACK TRAUMA PORN UNLIKE ALL THESE RIP OFFS, which are only made for profit instead of trying to make you actually think about the components of racism, and a nuanced representation of them. I could go on and on about this but yeah.
why does the karen character feel like a college aged girl dressing up as a fifty year old karen
This movie looks like an 8th grader watched Jordan Peele and Spike Lee movies and said “yeah, I can do that.”
This video was posted two hours ago and the secret channel is at 96K. Damn.
Ngl, I feel like we should start calling Karen's, white supremacists. I just feel like we're babying entitled white women more than society already does. Maybe I'm overthinking idk
I wanna be part of the world domination
have you thought perhaps her PR arranged her to make this movie so if you google her name + karen rant it would pull up videos of this movie and then people think she's just in a very weird and bad movie....
I think it looks so fucking funny
So you're telling me that because I'm from South Texas I'm a racist
Can we talk about D’Angelo’s hair in his face at 1:38 tho 🥺
i think we are all waiting for dangelo to review “who made the potatoe salad?” next
if "Karin" said the hard r would it be better or worse as a movie
You waiting for me to say Karen character made me feel like I was watching an episode of Dora
It looks like a movie Michael Scott would make to combat office racism or stg...
I thought the trailer was a joke smh
"Well I'm Black" That part was hilarious asf.   If someone made a Karen movie, it should be a Thriller rather than a Horror, and it shouldn't be a Karen movie. Karen is just a label and it shouldn't be literal and bold like the trailer was. If it was more realistic and brought awareness, rather than laughed at for being ridiculous then it would be a bit more acceptable. I like the black actors, they have potential, but the Karen actress was ridiculous and I'm sure many Karens are offended.   I feel like the movie was made to bank off of the current affairs going on rn. The pandemic happened and then apocalyptic and post apocalyptic movies started making money and gaining popularity, and that's just one example.   Sigh, we need more movies that bring awareness to actual problems and are bringing people into reality, rather than feeding/creating fears out of things that are happening.
I'd say just put single note horror music on top of a load of racist clips from this year but it would be too long and too disturbing
The person who plays "Karen" in this movie was in another movie based off a town nearby. My high school's logo is actually in the background of a few scenes. This movie also had like, no people of color, but it's surprisingly realistic because there's a very high white population over there (surprise, surprise). But like, she was the worst character in that movie and I hold that against her in my mind.
This is like snl acting
Omg 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pennsatucky!!
Oh gahhhd. Had to show this one to my mom bc it was such a good commentary video. We all got a chuckle out of Taryn Manning’s acting 😆 and the overplayed lines...
I just wanna see some black faeries, vampires and werewolves. That’s it. That’s all I want, please? 🥺
Just micro aggressions
I honestly was thinking it was a comedy/parody type movie. It is beyond cringe and will bomb for sure 🤣
The sponsor transition was so smooth i had to watch it twice
So glad you felt well enough to make this video. It was a comedic masterpiece 😊😊😊
I can't wait to NOT see this dumpster fire.
well at least they got an actual qanon karen to play the lead. points for realism i guess?
THATS PENTUCKY
We want your project 😭 And done, subbed.
This trailer made me cringe so hard, I hate watching shity trailers! Thankfully D'Angelos beautiful voice is there to calm me down in-between.
Wait, Isn't that the same actress who played Doggett in OITNB?
bestie i think we have the same type of bed. ikea, right?
That sponsor transition was freaking exquisite
I don’t think we need a movie about racism rn. It’s just gonna makes things worse.
You look so good in beanies
The "suspecting" is actually from a real karen video. It went down a lot like that, except they don't get arrested. She was on something I think
I actually like the actress they picked for Karen. Shes talented at acting like a whackjob.
WHY IS THE KAREN PENNSATUCKY
I said Karen character 3 times and when he said I summoned her even though I was laughing, when he hit that A my heart jumped. 🥲
is "Karen" not Pensatucky from Orange is The New Black LMFAOOO
not the confederate soap dispenser noooo 🤦‍♀️
Am I the only person who’s starting to get tired of Hollywood’s obsession with Black trauma? Like Black people experiencing pain and strife due to our Blackness isn’t the only story we have to tell.
WAIT, are you serious D'Angelo? Every place you've moved?? As a ghostly bitch in the south , I'm sorry.  YOU BETTER BE HONORED THIS MAN HAS GRACED YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.
Wait is that Pensatuckey??? From Orange is the New Black?
the fact that this isnt satire is so baffling to me
D’Angelo always manages to look fly no matter what he’s wearing, and I love it
I ain't gonna lie while I was saying 'Karen character,'I had a slight stroke saying that
Opinion on the word “folx” replacing folks? I read a book for school called “This book is anti racist” and I think it’s a good discussion topic. I think the word replacement is extremely unnecessary. At the same time as being anti racist, I found the book racist. It also compared being non-racist to actually being racist.
Pennsatucky!!!!!!!
i downloaded twitter to solely follow d'angelo and d'angelo only.
The Karens finally figured out how to ruin the joke.
WTF IS PENSATUCKY DOING 😭😭😭
Her partner is also a cop and tried to do the "not all cops are bad" thing last summer.
no , suspecting isn't how YOU or WE use the word. It is how Karens typically speak though.  They at least got that right.....
wasn't that Karen actress like a main character in Orange is the new Black????
The actress that plays karen was a better racist in orange is the new black then this
this is a movie for non black ppl to point to and say “but i’m not THAT kind of person so i’m not racist” when they’re committing harmful microagressions towards Black people
Please kill me. And take this movie down.
When he pointed out A note, he kinda ruined my day ngl
3:30 I feel like I got got 😭
I don't understand, the trailer was fine? I mean, there was this really handsome guy doing an ad at the beginning.
Why does this feel like a LMN movie instead of something in theatres.
First 100k gang! There's now 97k subs on that new channel as of me typing this.
Ain't that the girl from OITNB😂😂
D’Angelo’s mic quality 😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩😩🔥🔥🔥
Why the fuck did anyone think this should be a script and then a film / trash to spew into the world?  I can’t hate this more honestly.
So, this is a tall request, but I think it would be very interesting to do a watch party with your followers and watch the Karen movie and have you commentate on it. I think it would be incredibly insightful too. Hearing that every time you move you experience this was very eye-opening for me. I'm very aware of racism, but it did not occur to me that (what I view as) openly racist remarks were an everyday occurance for POC. Thank you for reading. I wish I could do more than send positive vibes your way right now.
The way you introduce the sponsor was so cute !!
1:15  Me: Oh please he cant be that handsome 1:25 *flies back into a wall*
D'Angelo: because that means... you've summoned her Me alone at 2am: *genuinely scared*
D'Angelo implying he is older than the world
When the world didn’t exactly need but certainly wanted him most,he returned.
Obviously this film is a publicity stunt.No one with any sense would make a film like this.
it looks like it was made in imovie
It’s obviously a parody. Like the wane brothers and the success of all the scary movie movies.
7:39 GIRL I DIIIIIIIIED YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME AHAHAHAHA
Yeah this is cool and all but did we ever figure out who made the potato salad?
Is that the religious girl in Orange is the new black playing the Karen?
a
This movie just has bad vibes about it. I don’t know what exactly.
OH no....I'm a fool
pennsatucky turns into a karen?
can we shut down the internet for like forever? maybe?
Can't find his new channel ??!! Can someone link it below
My issue isn't even with the fact of them making a film about it, but with *how* they made it, and how obvious the milking in it is. Like, there are films about wars, for example (don't come at me, I'm just mentioning an example of another despicable thing where people die, and that gets films made about it, in order to show how film industry actually *can* do serious movies about serious stuff), where they show the horrors of it (mostly to demonstrate the bravery of soldiers rather than the atrocities of war but still) - those are always made horrifying and gruesome (as they should be). This, on the other hand...from the moment I heard the "horror movie piano note" (haven't watched the vid past this yet) it just looked comical. I'm sure they knew what they were doing with it - there's no way this footage with this sound effect wouldn't look and sound comical. They're just mocking the issue in attempts to make it look less serious than it is, that's the feeling I get from it.
It feels uncomfortable to see a meme repurposed as a horror film.
yoo it's the woman from orange is the new black lol
0:54 Yes, I also happen to be a black people
Wait is my man engaged?
I just got an ad for encore by BET lmao
Isnt the lady that plays Karen that one meth-head from Orange Is The New Black.
Is the Karen doggett from oitnb
LOOOOOOOOOL!!!!! 1. it is directed by "Coke Daniels"..... 2. Maybe they weren't downplaying super racist things but rather displaying that even these smaller and creepier actions that happen everywhere, every day are also horrendous for those enduring them. I am giving NO benefit of the doubt to America right now so maybe skipping the hard "R" stuff was to avoid "inspiring" anyone who relates to the villain in the story.  3. Why does that lead actress look so weird? Not her personally but something about this movie make up or the hair colour....Iunno what it is but her face looks fake sometimes. Like a person wearing a fat suit except she isn't fat?  4. Regardless....please people....of all things pirated....don't pay for THIS trash :(
Not pennsatucky! Edit: never mind I just got to the part where D’Angelo talks about taryn Manning being insane
We lived next to a “Karen” she was annoying sometimes but she was OCD and wanted our lawns to have the same lines so she would now ours too so I couldn’t complain.
Anyone else get an ad for a new BET show while watching this video??
This movie looks like it's a flaming hot mess.
Not very fun fact: Taryn Manning played a racist on Orange is the New Black (Pennsatucky / Tiffany Doggett) and she was offered the role without needing to audtion... Enough said...
It’s just a movie glorifying racism and to get money from people who was oppressed from it
Speak on it, the vibes were off to me. I saw where they were trying to go but it came off as Saturday night live skit like and I couldn't take it seriously.
So this is what Pennsatucky got up to after she got out of prison.
Subscribed at 96.7k... super ominous but v excited
maybe there's a toe in the potato salad, making it a potaTOE salad
It really gives me “we decided to mock black trauma for money” vibes 😬😬😬gross
It’s like the actors were told it was a comedy and the producers were like now… put some scary music to it
Taren signed on so she could get paid to say the n word only to realise her character’s not allowed to swear 😔
They did my girl Taryn Manning wrong.
"I don't think 'suspecting' is the right word"  "You complain about trash but then you dump trash all over the sidewalk?"  Honestly... I hate to say it but these really are the sorts of things that Karens have us wondering irl. Just dumb beyond dumb. Fucking brain dead.
maybe taryn is actually her character on orange is the new black but in real life 😥😥
I'm disappointed they didn't give her the "Karen" haircut 😒
This movie feels like something Disney would make if they decided to make a horror movie. They love doing surface skimming versions of being progressive (with their 10 different 'first ever gay disney character!!!' and having a towns folk yell 'woman shouldn't read!!!' at Belle in their live-action beauty and beast).
It would be a BET original film 🙄
If y'all are bored and want to possibly ruin your blood pressure for the night, just watch the trailer on YouTube and read the thousands of comments criticizing this production for the complete opposite reason 🙂👍.
I think the problem with this movie and some others like it is it tries to tackle racism in an individual which is fine sometimes, but systematic racism is real, and they want some sort of “hey at least im not this bad” for white peeps
The end of the trailer literally centreing the white woman
“them” on hulu is WAY better
I feel like we watched the whole movie, this was an experience
The sad part is I kinda liked Taryn as Dogget in orange is the new black, but now I’m questioning my life.
That sound effect he’s using is kind of weirdly terrifying
Something about her responding to the child’s “ground breaking” news with “Well I’m black” just doesn’t sit right with me.
Smoothest transition into an ad I've seen all year! & the truest, I must say.
D'angelo is like my dad,he leaves for long periods of time but when he comes back i still love him😃
surprise surprise karens bad at acting
What white boomer came up with this? Like, do they not realize that Karens are just a huge meme who also unfortunately happen to exist?
I’ma just go back to my corner with the rest of the original creators and our original stories with subtle social commentary and fun. Every time I see small authors, arg creators, even some really amazing dnd dungeon masters come up with so many  more amazing and interesting ideas, then see these fucks make bland garbage is disappointing.   Moral of the story, read books (made by small authors) and play DnD because you’ll find some incredible people and stories.
I have seen who made the potatoe salad? The shit was a hilarious.. now I don’t know if it has aged well though
Wait, I legit thought that morning brew was a coffee thing. :0
The way this trailer looks like an youtube rip off of an SNL parody of a Jordan Peele's Flick
Hold on, is it just me or is the trailer made with iMovie, an apple app for making movies and trailers with a selected preview for each type of movie, like horror, like that one.
This is literally an exact knock-off of Them (the Amazon Prime series)
I refuse to believe this is real
People are gonna point to this movie as an example as to why they are not racist because of the over top racism exhibited in this movie. The most common racism is the subtle gestures not over the top “I hate black people” and this movie can have real effects on what people think is acceptable.
I said Karen taken character
"Serving my wife divorce paper at 3am prank, Free iPhone giveaway" IM WEAKKK💀😭😭
To me it seems like peak horror camp.
I thought the world domination thing was a joke you’ve had going on was a joke? 👀
Main charecter Karen: *sees a black guy* *calls cops* *movie ends*
“far from a racist” i can’t 😂😂
I miss the 10 min videos :(
My neighbor leaves his trash cans out for two day after pickup and I told him. But it’s ok, he’s white.
You do realize that she says "suspecting" on purpose... because it's definitely playing on existing phone footage of Karens *frequently* using the wrong words and making the people filming crack up and confused. Yeah? I love you, D'Angelo, and I'm mostly in agreeance with you... but that one particular thing isn't that bad. XD
im a fool 😔
It FEELS like they wanted to make a comedy. Like, they saw that 'Karen VS Manager' skit and wanted to do something like that but then they decided to make it serious after seeing Get Out, also deciding that they didn't want to get the dreaded R rating so they PG-ified the movie.
I'm one of the first 100K!!
Okay but D’Angelo waiting for us to talk was very Dora the Explorer
If there's anything white people shouldn't do, it's to try to depict the struggles of a race other than theirs. I'd like to know who the producers, executive producers, and director(s) are on this film. I'd be surprised if they aren't all white.
It’s amazing how many people fell into the Qanon shit. I have way less friends this year than I did last. The whole thing that annoyed me the most was the end of all those long posts was a call for us to basically believe Trump was god and if we just believe him, no more bad things will happen.
... but why? 😩 Of all the promising passion projects, why does this get made.
I like you dood... But not enough to finish watching this video and by extension subject myself to watching these excerpts of this dumb movie....
The ad to this taught me how to be a godly wife by a woman who looks like a stereotypical karen
They made this movie to call out racism and it instead is now labeled as racist
I feel bad for all the people named Karen but do not act like Karen's.
That transition into the ad was so smooth I didn’t even fast forward through it
tiff really playin a karen now 💔
I feel like the problem with the “get out mask” is that that was a critique of a very specific type of racism, the kind that is subtle and comes off as kind and is common in white liberal circles. The imitators miss that and so they make everyone cartoon racists instead
this trailer seems like it was written by a white person
First off, F# and A are thirds and I'd  hear the same thing. Lastly, this looks *so badly*. Maybe a drinking game? :D
That WAS the smoothest transition to an ad read and I LOVE that you know it. And the smoothest pinned comment for the ad, too.
Bruh you aren’t gonna die for shouting in a police’s face for being black they aren’t all like that
Stephen Speilsberg as director, and Tina Fey as the Karen! 😂
I feel bad for all the people out there named Karen who are nothing like “Karen.”
This movie is just trying to be like Jordan Peele's Get Out. Thats literally the best way to describe it. Get Out but colonized.
😃
I just can't get past how bad the acting is. I lost it when she flipped over the trash can
This movie feels like what Twitter would make, like they know what racism is but don’t understand what it is
Bro why didnt they just do a movie about a black guy who is accused of a crime he did not commit  and can face a really long time in jail, and a police who is trying to get a false confession to further his job and the karen like does not give a crap about her actions until people start to suspect the validity of her story when one of her kids says something that contradicts her story like live and suddenly like a lot of her old post and tweets are gone and boom. There would be  paranoia, suspicions and all that jazz to both sides.
They better stooooop....
d’angelo i want u to know i did in fact just say karen character three times fast flawlessly
I've been watching your videos for MONTHS so I assumed I was subscribed to you....welp turns out I wasn't but that changed today. I'm now subbed
Hey are you gonna to talk about the creep show art drama no rush but wanna see your side and experience with her:)
when you watch one jordan peele movie:
5:40 - why’s she laughing?
Pennsatucky from OITNB as a Karen is weird nightmare fuel
YES!!!! I am a fool.
Oh my God, the star is a Qult member, that's....something
JFC. "I need to speak to the manager". "bad things happen to those who don't comply" The woman in the park saying she is being harassed by very aggressive black men, her name is Karen....it is literally every viral post about racism and Karens all put into one movie. I don't need to watch it. Ever. I've already seen all the posts. The person who made this doesn't give af about racism. And it was made in all seriousness?!?!?! It wasn't supposed to be a joke?!?!? No EFFING way. Garbage. I would rather follow my dog around for a month and eat everything she shits out than watch this.
I thought the ad was fake 😂😂😂
The Confederate flag soap dispenser just- why???
there's no way that's serious, that's gotta be satirical, there absolutely no way anyone would pass that right??
orange is the new black is the only thing taryn manning was good in literally all her other projects her acting is....so bad....soa, 8 mile...every line seemed like she had to consciously think about it before saying it she was never natural except in oitnb
OMG THATS HER FROM ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK
I’m literally so tired of black trauma horror movies. If i wanted to see black trauma I’d turn on my local news station.
Holy shit Taryn Manning actually just is irl Doggett from OITNW but less likable
There’s no way anyone would agree to that role unless they weren’t racist themselves. Like real anti racist actors/actress would be put off on portraying such a role. She just outed herself.
this is satire....right?
What would you do level acting
6:35 This is so sad😭😹
Wait is that Taryn Manning??!! lolol of course it is
I'm sorry bestie, but Julian from Baumgartner Restoration has the smoothest transistions into ad reads. It takes me like 5 seconds into the ad to realise what's happening
I'm sorry but why isn't this a comedy skit cause it could be so funny if this wasn't gonna be a whole 60+ movie
Have you heard of the upcoming movie “They are us”? It’s about New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern and her response to the terrorist attack in Christchurch 2019. “Not so much about the attack but the response to the attack” - yes, the 51 Muslim ppl that died are only the backdrop to a story of a white hero. She did her job, it’s not movie worthy. Here in NZ we are trying to get this movie canned, maybe if u spoke about it u could help? Ps. This is a shit summary but the best I could do
So sad that Tarryn Manning is in such a shitty movie after proving her acting chops in OITNB  Edit: got to 11:27 whoops never mind
IVE MISSED YOUR VIDEOS SO MUCH
i’ve been having an especially hard time lately and this came at literally the exact right moment… bit suspicious if you ask me…
that was dahr mann acting lol
This movie would be better social commentary if it was actually satire.
I know, so so off topic but I was wondering whether you are going to talk about everything going on with the whole creepshow Art situation...
is 'potatoe' a reference to  that thing with former vice president dan quayle, when he corrected a child during a spelling bee contest even though he spelled potato correctly, claiming he missed the 'e' at the end lol?? quayle was vice president under george hw bush (R) btw
Damn well if she needs a check
the KING is back
Bad or not the movie will probably do well in sales because “Karen” is such a huge social media theme and every 16 year old on TikTok will want to see it. Every vloggers gonna vlog about it and every hater will find an easy target to hate on. I wouldn’t be even be surprised if Fox News will have their two cents in it. And all this means $$$. Anyhoo, I double checked notifications so I’ll be sure to see your review lol. ✌️
It's BET you shouldn't expect much from BET this is why I was so mad when they turned Centric into BET HER🤣
Oh no. I summoned Karen. Damn you D'Angelo
Please this is "Get Out" but all the black characters are lightskinned and there's only one racist in the world
When you read out the list of Coke Daniels pieces... that was it for me.
is d'angelo married?  i see that ring.......... o.O
Miss you hope you're doing OK thanks for putting a smile on my face
Why is no one talking about the first scene of the trailer focusing on an insanely attractive young man as he does an ad read for today's sponsor?
This kind of movie is what makes people think that systemic racism doesn’t exist, bc they’re not as evil as this Karen villain. In reality, racism doesn’t have to involve “hating” someone for their race, but a structural system of devaluing and oppressing racialized people that must actively be fought against- it permeates the law, for example, regardless of “good intention”.
I’m literally crying at this trailer omggggggg 😂😂😂😂😂😂 bruhhhh how can this be real
Get Out and it's consequences have been a disaster for the human race.
Before 100k subs gang on the secret channel
I have one word for this trailer: Budget. Shoestring. Cringe. Unnecessary. Dehydrated. Low credit score. Unpaid parking tickets. Kale smoothie. True crime reenactment footage. Jordan Peele piggybacking.
OMG doesn’t this crap actually happen in 2021?  Geeze
Wow, it feels like they just filmed events in my life and then put scary music behind it. Like they’re just saying “look how bad black people have it” and that’s it.
why does this movie feel like a parody
at least the male lead is fine af
he has returned on my birthday, welcome back king
didn't that karen actress also play a racist in orange is the new black? it's been a while since i watched that show but like im pretty sure
Already subscribed ❤️❤️❤️
pensetuckie nooo
guys i think this movie is a joke 😭
sending so much love!! your vids help me feel literally anything, please take care of yourself d'angelo <3
Based on the thumbnail, the main character looks like my favorite aunt, and I am not happy about it
we can never have anything funny (not that i was ever a fan of the karen meme) without it getting blown tf up and then it’s just absolutely ridiculous. and that goes for everything in life lmao
The victim mentality from dangelo is pretty big here
❤ you, Sir...great 2 see you back 😊👍
I'm not watching this mess.
They didn't even understand the concept of Karens.
"It's an A!!"
this reminds me of a dhar mann skit 💆‍♀️
Every time I hear that note I think it’s going to go into Runaway by Kanye West
why the fuck would the confederate flag be on the back of a soap dispenser? what a weird place to put that
Ugh she was actually a great actress in Orange is the New Black.  Blown she's doing this movie.
The Karen meme is dead. This killed it.  And yet, that had a bigger impact than anything at all this movie could possibly muster.
This is the second time she has played a super racist character
yay you’re back !
Hearing the actress is a Karen puts all the pieces into place. Their goal is to mock the claims of racism, not highlight them.
Wow, this movie looks like hot garbage that was left to cool, grease congealing slowly on the surface of mildewed milk cartons as maggots slowly undermine its foundation before more garbage is piled on top.
wait why does the woman who plays karen seem so familiar to me??  edit: oh wait she was in orange is the new black
I feel bad for the people actually named Karen ur name Is attached to this😂😭😭
Take a shot everytime they should've dropped the hard 'r' irl
The movie is junk. Much better things to watch...like make a movie on FREE HUGS....or random acts of kindness!  Society is so hurtful...how hard is it to: TREAT ALL PEOPLE THE WAY U WANT 2B TREATED? Yes there are exceptions...but as a whole...y in the HECK (lol) cant they for ONCE show positivity n love to all.
commenting for the algorithm
I got a ringing in my ear from this video lmao
“Mom, can we watch Get Out?” “We have Get Out at home.” Get Out at home: K A R E N
So the actress that plays Karen was a Karen before she even got the role of Karen in the movie? That's method acting at its finest,DDL must be jealous
It looks like the part of Lovecraft Country where they moved into the white neighborhood but way more badly done
Isn't the girl that plays Karen Pensitucky from Orange is the New Black?
I hate this. The poster looks like a meme made by teenagers 😬
I was called a Karen for just offering my opinion which wasn’t even inappropriate or mean 😢
im actually crying, this trailer is so bad I'm going to die :)
The channel "the Take" did a great beak down on the psychology of Karens and how they weaponize their privilege
“try it i’ll wait” - me already forgetting what he asked us to say 😭
Nah, I watch Karen clip shows on yt...those chicks are waaaaay more racist & potty mouthed.   That phone call scene seems to be a call back to the central park dog walker Karen vs. the black male bird watcher who filmed her first acting credit of lady on 911 pretending she's in danger & being threatened.  Dumb.
I wonder if Taryn was promoting the movie by making those contents 🤔
Does this trailer seem like it doesn't have an actual movie? You know those videos where it's a "trailer" for a movie that isn't actually being made? They put these scenes explaining the plot for this story, but it's actually a joke or parody or for irony (aka SNL skit). That's what this feel like.
That vegan teacher spelled out the n word next to colored doll…..
Does this look stupid? Yes. Am I going to watch it? Probably.
why is no one talking about how she is an actress from orange is the new black
Streamie award for best Segway into an ad-read? I'll nominate him.
Funny thing is the whole time I was wondering why Taryn would take this role because she’s actually not a bad actress but I didn’t know about that tweet. Did she do this thinking it’d be damage control?  Either way this was not a good choice for her if the movie is as terrible as the trailer looks.
D'angelo demonstrating his music expertise, 'is that an f#.......its an a'
I've.. come across some... *very* SUSSY TEENAGERS GRR IMPOSTER!!! VOTE THEM GUYS, VOTE THEM!!!!!! TEENAGER #1 WAS EJECTED, CREWMATES WI want to get out of this hell
Maybe Taryn Manning went full Method in order to prepare for the role of a lifetime.
9:11 tf i hope not. you- LIKE WHY WOULD HE?
Unless she says "it weren't my fault I was just doin as the spirit commanded" I'm gonna flip my lid
9:03 like no joke, where can you go in tx and NOT see some kind of confederate flag.
I literally don’t understand why he doesn’t use his other channel…with more subs…. Is it a flex type of thing?
lol the acting is so baaadd. This movie looks like trash.
YOURE BACK!!!!!!!!!
The summoning Karen Character bit made me laugh
Soo this what my girl from Orange is the New Black is doing? damn sis.
It feels like a right wing movie mocking the issue of racism like I'm white but it feels almost like it's satire ???
Wait isn't that the actress that played in orange is the new black.....honey what r u doing
I would love a comedic horror movie with a Karen as the “monster” and with random jump scares or something. The racism would kinda makes it cringey though.
I just love the fact that the actor for Karen went on a weird Qult rant Trump holding the “Sword of god” or some shit
The Karen actress has such slurred speech, it’s like she just washed down some Xanax with a bottle of wine 🥴
quanon or whatever was started on 4 chan lol
Sussy teenagers...
oh no, wasn't she in orange is the new black? i really liked her in that :/
the karen is the crazy evangelical character from orange is the new black...
Missed you, glad you taking care of yourself
If they ever make a universe of these movies the next one should be "Kyle" or "Chad" the movie
1:15 I was kinda wondering who this insanely attractive young man you were talking about was🤦🏿
Look, I love listening to D'Angelo talk about random stuff that's currently happening, but after this I'm just tired.
Benefit of the doubt: it’s the way the trailer is edited and the movie will turn out to be a semi-thoughtful social critique 🤷🏾‍♂️  Edit: never fucking mind. It was the Twitter posts for me   EXIT 🚶🏾‍♂️🚶🏾‍♂️🚶🏾‍♂️
"they've somehow whitewashed racism itself"  i'm fucking wheezing
hell yea im the 94,400th subscriber to the secret channel
I think it's a dumb movie made from dumb people to dumb people and is to dumb to be offended by
I’m a little disappointed. I could imagine a competent black filmmaker making it a comedy/horror movie with some actual depth. Instead this just looks like a mockery of Get Out
I don't blame the actors and actresses, I blame: the writer, the director and anyone who funded/produced this as a good idea or "sending a message" as if it is a serious film.
📢 SUSPECTING 🤣🤣😂😂
Was this movie supposed to be a comedy or a horror movie?
"Gangsta Rap: The Glockumentary" sounds like a complete trainwreck.
Could you please do a movie reveal of this movie because I feel like no matter how much hate it gets, it’s still going to come out
D'Angelo is a whole vibe and I'm here for it.
bro the links at the end of this video are missing tho !!!!
Is this a horror movie or a comedy that isn’t funny? It feels like bad satire.
neither male nor female. just D'Angelo. the gender? D'Angelo the pronouns? hot/as/f*ck my sexuality? D'Angelo not gonna lie, i have a massive crush on D'Angelo. but then again, who doesn't?
TARYN MANNING NO WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
that trailer felt like an snl skit .... and like .... not a funny one
unironically, the actress who plays Karen is also the same person who played Pennsatucky in Orange Is the New Black...
so when are you making D'aNgElO wALlAcE ??
first 100k gang let's go
I feel bad for every woman called "Karen" who has NONE of those traits! Can you imagine how its affecting their lives just because of this lame stereo typing? Even the women who have the "Karen Haircut" without having any idea about this whole thing.
Is Karen played by Pennsatucky from orange is the new black?
a song?????????? 😳
I pronounce your name Dangle-low. Thought you should know.
7:44 she is gorgeous
This looks like a trailer for one of those SNL skits. You know, like the Dwayne the Rock Johnson's Bambi? Everything from the botched wig (seriously; they couldn't splurge on baby powder) to the framing, to the title of the film looks like a bad SNL skit. Seriously; just add a laugh track and there's literally no difference.
finding out she's actually a karen irl is like finding out the white girl from get out actually eats her froot loops and milk seperately
it sucks
"Sounds like it  was written by A. I  fed on Instagram posts of black squares by non black people" .... Dead funny XD
Is it bad that I want to watch it for the trash factor?
It’s like BET made a Lifetime movie
I have lived a lot of places and never had a white person approach me about a black family.  Lol, BET and its wokeness is failing.
SHE WHAT...... HER TWEET ... WH- WHTF LMAOOOOOOOOO
Why make this.🤣🤣🤣
A Karen movie would have been better as a comedy Like imagine she wakes up one day and everyone is treating her the way she treats black people-- oh wait always sunny already did that
She’s so much better at playing a meth addict than a Karen lollllll
I feel like a Karen movie should be a comedy mocking the entitled and/or racist behavior they do.
im confused he said there was going to be an insanely attractive man reading the sponsorship and then nothing happened
Is that Taryn Manning from OITNB?
You lookin' especially flawless today, King.
The sad thing is if this movie was made competently this premise would work as an insight to internal biases and the problems of growing up in an undiverse bubble... But no its a poorly made horror comedy that isnt even satire because of how aweful it is, ...god its cringe honestly
bruh that trailer is awful-- the acting is weird & i just.... how....
I'm just so confused why this movie was made....this looks so much like satire....
Truth be told, she seems more like the "Willfully-Blissfully Ignorant" type of racist to me than the "Outright Racist" type. As in, she may not go out of her way to make life hard for non white people, and may not have outright racist ideas like "Non-whites are genetically inferior to whites for x-reason", but, if she has not personally experienced or witnessed racism, like police brutality against black people, then it means that everyone is just exaggerating.  This is just a theory. I don't know the lady, so I would not know what really goes through her head.
Give her a knife and I’ll watch it.. I swear to Godzilla. Don’t laugh I’m serious.
And here's the thing! This movie is stupid. VERY stupid. So stupid, in fact, that it became trending on Twitter. You know,  because people talked about it! enough That's the point! All the creators of this mess want is for people to talk about it so it spreads like the plague it is. The dumber the content, the higher the outrage/mockery. The higher the outrage/mockery, the more people are gonna see it. It's free advertisement for a movie that wouldn't even be looked at once had it not been trending. I literally only know about this movie because I happened to see it on the trending sidebar! It's this cycle where Twitter will never realize that they're being used to push a product. Its happened before and its happening again, and it's gonna happen a million times more. And then, when you have a bunch of Youtube videos of varying talking about, its just gonna get more time. A lot of people aren't gonna see this movie, but how any people are gonna pay for a ticket just so they "can see what all the fuss is about?" like the Emoji Movie or something? The more its spreads, the higher the potential audience.  And I'm not even seeing "SHAME ON YOUTUBERS FOR TALKING ABOUT THIS!" Because it doesn't 't actually matter! Its just a dumb trailer, who cares? Its all just entertainment at the end of the day, Youtubers talking about this film isn't gonna end the world (please don't let it end the world, that'd be a lame way to go). I just wanted to talk about that cycle of advertisement we're trapped in forever.
Is Karen pensatucky from Orange is the New Black 😭
oh my god this has to be a fever dream they hired pensatucky to play a karen in a thriller/horror movie that makes racism out to be some cartoonish supernatural force theres no way this is real—
This movie is a disgrace. I cannot even fathom this film being real.
If it was a comedy that could work, it would probably suck but at least it wouldn’t be this
They take a day to day life as a black person then add some creepy music to it. Boom ya have a horror movie. That should tell ya something.
I didn't know this was a real movie trailer. I thought mugs had jokes. Wow!
hey dangloo Wilson I'm eating a chewy chips ahoy cookies I have 2 more rows I left I don't know I haven't peeled back the whole top but I'm pretty sure there's either 2 or 3 rows also I've had 1 cookie from a row left
the Karen character is....that one weird religious nut in Orange is the New Black.   Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeshhhhh  At the end of the day, I guess acting is still a job and you need to pay the bills somehow, but damn, this movie...is......*embarrassing* to say the least
Can't say I expected the druggy from orange is the new black to ever play a karen
Is D'Angelo gonna make music?? Please tell me he will.
DANGELO UR BACK OMG I MISSED U
It’s one of those things that’s so bad you just have to laugh.
smoothest transition to an ad read in my LIFE
Parece una parodia de snl xd
i-  anyway, cant wait for Kennie JD to watch this so i dont have to
lmaooooo chillllle
When I see these terrible movies/ trailers, it makes me want to re-write the stories to make them actually worth watching
As good as Get out was, I will never forgive Jordan Peele for creating this racist horror genre
This movie seems like one of the things that get attributed to "those much-too-precious sjws who can't handle anything", while we're actually just raising our eyebrow and going "really?". It's what my 60 year old white Australian mother could have written.
Honestly I’m hoping at this point this film is so bad is good. You want to see the real cringe though? See some of the comments responding to this trailer on YT. Literally whining about CRT when nothing about academics is in this film.
People are being murdered in the streets just because of their skin colour, but karens are the biggest threat to minorities and nothing else
I’m excited for this because it’ll kill the Karen meme and I can change my username back to my actual name.
This trailer is so bad that's it funny.
This movie feels like something they would make mandatory to watch at school ngl
Listen, a horror movie about just some small unassuming white lady who manipulates everyone around her to get away with murder, in theory, sounds like an excellent horror movie especially with nuanced subtle social commentary. They just are doing everything wrong and that's very sad we need more good horror.
This video actually inspired me to pursue my dream career, screenwriting.  The only thing holding me back was the knowledge of all the risk you have to take in order to have a shot, as well as all of the competition full of people just like you except 10x better  but if THIS concept can be written and made into a movie, i could win an oscar
Here's my take without hearing anyone else's opinion yet:  Either this movie is actually really stupid trying to be relatable and just missed the mark entirely, or they're playing some 4D chess and we're missing the true subtleties like maybe it's satire of fictional media's depictions of racism being very mundane and not severe. But chances are I'm hoping for too much and it's actually just a stupid and pointless movie.
LOL all I can see Pennsatucky from OITNB and it KINDA FITS ???? Pennsatucky if she was real privileged lol
Karen is the Christian girl from orange is the new black
I was eating when D'angelo did the segway to the add read and I almost choked. Congratulations D'Angelo that a feat
In this video D'Angelo says he can't remember the date of when he saw the world created. This implies that D'Angelp has existed since the dawn of time.  *This does not surprise me.*
why are boomers taking something that gen z made jokes about and trying to be relatable and turn it into a fucking movie?? as a person in america i object
the problem is that we are feeding into karens, if we pay attention to them then they'll just keep doing it.
These people have never met a karen, there’s not enough screaming and yelling
Her using the wrong word is actually something I have seen IRL Karens do, interestingly enough.
That transition into your advert was smooth as hell. 10/10
We're all in the "sunken place"... Get out movie reference on purpose there d'angelo or just genius flow?
2:05 sorry, but I watch Adam Ragusa
Yep❗The whole movie is beyond what I see as "commercial racism" ❗I'm ILL ❕
I liked Taryn on Orange is the New Black but since the show ended she seems like she’s… not ok. Her Instagram ramblings definitely put her in Karen territory.
They should just gather all the Karen clips and put it in one compilation, that’s your Karen movie.
d'angelo: "Say it!" me (having lost my voice today): ....
Please do a watch party of this on twitch 🙏🏻🙏🏻
What target audience is this shit even made for?
Ok, this video might be your most hilarious video yet. 😂 I have cackled several times.
I am like appalled but also not surprised to figure out Taryn Manning is a weirdo... I knew her as pennsatucky on orange is the new black, which to be fair is a pretty consistent character type to this one here but I thought it came with some ounce of self awareness...? Why is she acting in all of these medias depicting racism while also literally being the character she's portraying?? it's giving me such mixed signals
Me, moving very fast: *in the first 100k* Me: yesss, an accomplishment! xD
On the movie: not funny, not scary, bad acting, aaaaand what?  On the racism commentary: truthfully, I have no idea what to think. I feel so disconnected from all views because I grew up in an area/community where the people actively fought against racism/racist behaviors. I've never seen anyone as or treated anyone as different until someone else pointed out that others are different and tried to make the argument that that made them worse. It makes me so sad that anyone ever treated D'Angelo or his family in that way, and it's bigotry that I just don't understand. I can't wrap my head around the idea of being descriminatory.
Ok, I’m gonna be honest, I do think we need a movie about Karens and the treatment of black people in America, but it needs to be made by and with black people’s proper input, and most importantly not for black people. As D’Angelo pointed out, black people already know. The movie would be for the non-black people (Asian Americans like me can be ignorant too) so that they can learn what racism can look like and self reflect. Properly.   I personally didn’t even know ‘Karen’ was referring to a racist white lady; I thought it meant entitled lady being an @sshole (the difference is subtle, yes, but definitely still there) and learned about the history from one of Khadija Mbowe’s videos.
Wait isn’t Karen... Tiffany Doggett 🤣 Orange is the New Black? (Taryn Manning) I am SO CONFUSED why she would do such a trash movie like this?!?!
This feels like a satire of horror movies.  If someone actually tried to make a parody of "get out" or something.
i thought the trailer was supposed to be a joke for laughing value. but no, i think they're serious. they're making a movie... based on entitled women
from this trailer ir seems like the movie was made to show how "unreasonable" we're all being when we say karens are racist. I hate it. it's so outlandish and stupid when there's actual racism or even just microaggressions that can be shown
LMAOOOO I SUMMONED HER
It looks like a lazy version of Them but without racist ghosts.
I can’t tell if this movie is satirical or not…
Man, really expected Pennsatucky to hit this racist narrative out the park, but alas.
Y’all, I can look up multiple (irl) videos of Karen’s acting up. At least the acting won’t be unbearable…
I’m sad my name is Karen
Yeah, that was bad. I don’t think Karen’s are supposed to be aware of their racism or ever admit that they’re racist even when they’re alone. This is like a literal horror movie monster targeting a black family to the point of death. Which is a little less subtle form of racism.
Just coming here to brag about how I’m in the first 100k on the secret channel. I am now hip and/or cool.
they just watch every youtube video of a karen and put it together to create the Super Cringe Karen! lol.
I thought this trailer was an SNL skit. Partially due to the Karen actress having the same make-up look they usually do for the odd ball/problematic characters
You look like you do bowling
wait this wasn't a joke
I THOUGHT THIS WAS A MEME WTF
This was literally Bretman Rock’s neighbours before he moved
Okay but ya'll know this is going to be a bullshit copaganda boba liberal luke warm coca cola shitshow right? Like do I need to point out how it's just gonna be "Omg this specific, individual cop is really bad and we're so sorry. :(" (or maybe they'll spice it up and "it turns out the whole department was a secret, evil, Nazi undercover organisation but don't worry we replaced it with the good cops. :)" Then followed by our "super cool, super sick white guy who saves the black family accompanied by his sidekick who is a woman who seduces her victims." And then the obvious "horrifying hate crimes and murder of the black family just in case we didn't awaken the trauma inside of our black audience already. :)" Who wants to place their bets on at least one of these things happening? I can see it coming from a mile away.
I already subscribed to your second channel last year, mostly out of confusion. 😄
I said ‘Karen character’ 3x in the mirror and it played me the early release of this movie.
When I said "Karen character " 3 times I lol'd  I Screamed when I realized you weren't joking.
My biggest flex is being one of the first 100,000 on every single one of your accounts
The Confederate flag on the soap dispenser got me
I watched the trailer before and thought it was a parody like SNL 💀
this feels like a satirical sketch where all of the white people are competing to see who can win the most "woke points" by LARPing as caricatures of existing media tropes just to prove they have seen tweets about racism one time
1 of 100'000 lets goooooooo!!!!!!!
the Karen movie is just a long ass Dhar Mann skit
Yooo I just subscribed before hundred thousand! Now I have bragging rights for the rest of D'Angelo's career!
Didn’t the karen also play the sister of Steve McGarrett in *Hawaii Five-O?*
Did they put her in prosthetics??
Dead meme, but it applies: "Mom, can we see Get Out?" "We have Get Out at home" *Get Out at home*
YESSS DANGELO IS BACKKKK
I disagree I think they just fed the AI headlines about racists
I don't think its the worst ever, but it's definitely unwatchable
Wow but damn if you do damn if you don't.
Please make a video about an insane 1980s low budget called "You talking to me?" The villain is a white supremacist televangelist played by Mr. Drummond from Different Strokes. I think it would be  great material for you.
Can't find the All Caps channel
D’angelo calling me a fool is literally the best thing to happen me all week
That Karen girl is played by that girl who's from orange is the new black I think
The acting is so bad she sounds like she’s perpetually drunk
"Suspected" lolol...I mean the actress is Pennsatucky 🤷🏽‍♀️
This trailer is horrible 💀💀 I’m gonna definitely watch ironically 😂
She really let Pensatucky get in her head - or she was literally her all along
11:41 this should be a copypasta
This has to be a joke movie.
It just seems pointless to make a movie about Karens if you’re not gonna make it really funny (and things can be horror and funny at the same time or in the same movie!?
Dharr Mann has monopoly over Karens.
Karen character Karen karenter karac charenter... yeah I couldn’t do it.
The way racism, sexism, homophobia, and other prejudices are depicted in media is so unrealistic. Blatant discrimination is, in a way, easier to deal with versus the insidious, systemic discrimination that many of us experienced everyday. I have had a boss tell me that I could not be an engineer because I am a woman. It's almost easy to laugh that off. Because it's ridiculous. But when I'm repeatedly interrupted in meetings, and male peers take credit for my ideas, that can really wear you down over time. You start questioning your worth, questioning whether or not any of this is real and accuse yourself of being too sensitive or imagining things.
I feel bad for people named Karen
Taryn Manning was not right for this part! She’s too young looking and innocent sounding! Far too appealing and likeable to be a ‘Karen’
We missed you!!! ❤️
D'Angelo: That means, officially, you're a fool me: YAY! D'Angelo: Because you've summoned her me: oh shit
Hollywood and the media really profit handsomely off of stoking racial tension and animosity
nice
That actress is from orange is the new black where she’s actually pretty good. Honestly a really poorly written script cant be saved by any level of acting skill. It’s just a terribly written movie and a subpar director.
This is so foolish
I’m old enough to remember when Pulp Fiction and Scream were first released and we as an audience got to suffer through far too many copycat films that didn’t understand what made the originals so great. The same thing is happening with ‘Get Out.’ The thing that made that film so amazing was Jordan Peele’s genius way of depicting how insidiously terrifying the experience of racism can be. This film isn’t as nuanced and it’s incredibly boring to watch a film about racist people being racist from director who isn’t able to handle the subject matter well. Also? If I wanted to see a racist Karen, I’d quit my current job and go back to working in retail. I don’t want them in my entertainment, thanks.
I mean she played Pennsatucky(sp). I never paid much attention to her outside OITNB but yeah...this tracks.
omg its pennsatucky
that insanely smooth transition into the sponsor immediately earned a like from me
The Karen actor is “pennsatucky” from orange is the new black. This is a total 180 from her usual portrayal of racism.
i dont get d'angelos' commentary. is he trying to say this movie seems ridiculous because it's unrealistic and exaggerated? if anything i'd say not only does it seem like an accurate portrayal of todays' reality but i think a lot of white ppl might benefit from seeing this movie cause most of them find it difficult to recognize subtle racism (even though nothing about this film depicts subtle racism imo)
this genuinely feels like a white art student who has never had a genuine interaction with anyone who wasn't white tried to ''fix'' racism but ends up making it worse.   also every scene looks like they were shot individually? like every actor was just alone on set with cameras, and they editted it together to make it look like people were on screen together
the dude's first name is literally Coke. i cannot get over this. everything about this movie is goddamn ridiculous
My real problem with this trailer / movie is that since it has zero subtlety and leaves very little open to interpretation, it completely steamrolls the complexity of REAL RACE ISSUES. And it isn't even good as a horror movie. It seems like they're trying to simplify the unfair treatment of POC in America to just 'Karens being Karens' which doesn't exactly make the viewer think about the nuance of these very real issues. And of course, the Karen actress being the epitome of a Karen in real life is just the cherry on top of this trainwreck. It's almost poetic
This movie looks like Get Out on a budget
This movie really looks like a facebook skit
The whole thing is so untasteful... Who the hell gave the green light to produce this.
The actress in this was in orange is the new black like she’s actually a good actress I’m so confused as to why she’s like, in this movie?
It seems like a further commodification of the "black experience" without actually  understanding the nuance and complexity of being black in America. It's a palatable understanding of racist white people. The character of Karen here feels like a way of distancing the white liberal viewer from any self examination of personal bias or unconscious racism and it seems to put black trauma on display for shock value. Overall, not a good look.
It took me until 13:35, when you said it was not a satire, for me to realize it was not a satire... What in the actual fuck is this movie
Is this actually a movie with a plot of just like a collage of microaggressions
i really said it 3 times fast before you even paused for it 💀
So you're telling me this ISN'T an SNL parody sketch?
I get that Hollywood isn’t known for creativity, but all these Get Out wannabes that boil down to “black people suffer for 100 minutes” are getting annoying. There are plenty of great films that tackle racism (besides Get Out, Do The Right Thing comes to mind), but it’s a topic that requires great care in media or else it falls flat on its face, and it’s clear that many of these writers don’t have the chops to write it well. Also, it’d be nice to have a modern movie starring black people that isn’t about racism for once (excluding Will Smith action movies, of course, there’s plenty of them)
this seems like a rachel berry/lea michele situation
I would like to speak to the manager and just say that the host and star of this youtube channel is incredibly funny and attractive and stylish!
why the heck is she so pale? and what is with the red lip? also... the acting is soo cringy it makes dhar mann's videos are well more written than this thats a lot who the heck is writing or directing this movie? why the heck is this being a thing...
"insert age of the world I don't remember the exact day I saw it created" oh I knew we were dealing with a god
It’s like they went and scouted for an actual Karen who might not be a Karen But has said some suspicious stuff
That ad break kinda got me haha
pretty disappointed bc the karen actress has done an amazing job in orange is the new black. maybe the writing is to blame?
Yikes she's worse that the pensatucky character she played in OITNB 🤢
Ummm is Karen the preggo girl from crossroads  movie ?
Pennsatuckey turned into a Karen, who would've thought
As if Karen isn't on the HOA board herself
I made the unfortunate mistake of reading the deleted tweet when you put it up on the screen. Pretty sure that shaved a few years off of my life span.
Not Pennsatucky... 😬
The actresses that plays the Karen was in orange is the new black and her character there was more of a Karen than this one will ever be...  Oh just saw the section about the actress 😬😬😬
My thoughts on this trailer: Bruh Bruh Bruh Bruh Bruh Bruh bruuuuuuuuh
wait it's gonna be a real movie??? i thought it was a parody.....
Are u OK? Yes the pop culture is really going down wrong path
Thank you for uploading   we love you  🤗✨🤩
Here I was hoping for a comedy about how ridiculous karens are..lol
the whole Karen meme is dead it’s like four years old at this point
the ad read was really smooth not gonna lie
"You say I'm racist? I've touched a black before!"-the lead actress of Karen
It's hard to believe that this movie isn't satire
D’Angelo: “….an INSANELY attractive man…” Me: “you. It’s gonna be you, isn’t it?”
The couple being shocked at Karen being racist reminded me of the intro to Scary Movie 3, where Pamela Anderson's character was poking Jenny McCarthy's character's decapitated head and asking if she was okay and not dead. Lmao.   Also, how can a real-life racist Karen poorly portray a racist Karen? Like...what? That was the only role she could pull off and she couldn't even do that.
Why do I really want to watch this movie and laugh at the insanity. With the bois, of course.
Better plot idea: KAREN but it’s like Stephen King’s IT. A group of young adults all have terrifying experiences with women named Karen. Then it’s unveiled all the Karens are a hive mind and they have to take them out.  It’d be campy, but at least it wouldn’t beat you over the head with RACISM BAD like this movie trailer seems to be doing .
What's killing me is that it's a movie based on a meme, but is a DEAD SERIOUS THRILLER lmao. Cinema is trully a blessing
Haha I only said it twice 😂
😭😭 When this man said i summoned her, i actually got scaredddd
I think the best part is that the Karen actress was also Pennsyltucky on OITNB and that character type just... Tracks. It tracks.
Ew 👾
I feel like we often hear about actors who are the best at playing villanous characters being pretty cool people outside of those characters. I wonder if this actress is trying to capitalize on that, like if she can play a "parodied" Karen, she must not really be one... right? Right?
This is literally just a Dhar Mann film but higher budget
D'angelo has anyone ever told u u look kinda like kaz Kaan from neo yokio? If u had pink hair u could cosplay as him
The actress who plays Karen is actually talented. They could have done something really frightening !
i’ve been laughing at “as a black people” for too long. i think my humor is broken 😭
Not saying it’s all but it’s basically trump supporters look on black people made into a movie.
I was hit in the head by a falling, child-sized plaster angel statue once. That was still more subtle than this movie xD
I've been apart of the 1st 100,000 on all three channels.  I guess I'm elite
Is calling every boomer  'Karen' a form of stereotyping ? Poor Karen's, not every Karen is a jerk.
the way i see it is that by making this movie trying to accurately depict racism actively over-dramatize racism, it mentally detaches actual racist people from exposing that their acts are racist, creating a cycle of perpetuated ignorance.
For some reason I didn't realise that was the trailer and not the movie till the last part, and THOSE were the clips they chose to highlight the movie? - I
they dead ass just plopped a wig on the karen character and did nothing to make it look prsentable. lmao i-
I bet you taren accepted that role a little too excitedly…
White women tears are scary but somehow they made is cringey
11:37 I expected nothing less from the woman who played the jesus freak on orange is the new black
You can only go so far with a bad script. Taryn Manning is a great actress, ppl should stop mixing fiction with reality. She's actually very sweet irl, advocating for lgbt, animal rights and I know she's been struggling for couple of years. Give her a damn break
K, while watching the trailer it felt like I was watching a Dhar Man video like tf 😂
I think that this movie is the most unnecessary thing ever and the fact that it exists kinda contradicts the point it was trying, and failed to make.
I wanted to watch it because I thought it was a horror-comedy sort of thing XD  It's actually serious?
just...... don't
92.1k! Damn I can't even get more than 35 subs lol
I'm pretty sure the Karen meme was dying already, but this trailer just killed it off for good
tary manning isn't really going into character, it's natural /j
Can't wait for the livestream where we watch this movie and laugh at its absurdity
This movie is so cringey that I had to take breaks between every few seconds during the trailer
isnt that pennsatuky from orange is the new black...
Tia Mowry’s husband will do literally any movie. That’s no shade. Just a fact. He’s everywhere and nowhere.
noo what the hell karen is that crazy christian woman in orange is the new black i cant take this anymore
Gotta say, D’angelo effortlessly hitting that key was way scarier than any horror film trailer could pull off
12:18 The funniest part about this to me is that it's literally her as a child. Like, you couldn't get anything more recent, Taryn?
omg didn’t the Karen actress act in OITNB as well? What a downgrade 🤭
This is reminding me of that garbage horror movie about liberals hunting down conservatives or whatever
That "...it's an A" got me good. Damn it.
Whats even funnier is the woman who plays Karen played a god obsessed Christian in Orange is the New Black
Smdh. Awful. All of it 🤦🏾‍♀️
Insanely handsome is an understatement. Just sayin’ :)
There are only 3 options for the purpose of this movie: 1. the creators of this movie are trying to accurately portray the struggles of black people in relation to “Karens” and is failing horribly (pretty unlikely) 2. This is a comedy/parody. A very bad, unfunny parody, but a parody nonetheless (probably right) 3. All of the confusion and jokes are all on purpose, the trailer was designed to create this kind of uproar and the full movie is going to be surprisingly good (very unlikely)
Just watch them
that ad read transition GOT me BAAADD I didn't just smirk or breathed loudly, I weezed so hard boy
Wait isn’t that the girl from orange is the new black
I guess it means well, but execution is not good.
When he hit the piano key and said “it’s an A!” I died 😂😂
I was actually totally sold when I heard his other film titles, but took my money back on the bit about the lead actress being a true Karen. This is not how we do campy cult classic. Potatoe.
Bruh imagine her two black friends watching her post that like… you’re using your CHILDHOOD friends as glorified passes from being racist? That probably feels good for those girls 🤡
this trailer would have been better if it wasn't suppsoed to be taken seriously
The fact that she (Karen) straight up looks like the lady from Over the Hedge is just.....the cherry on top.
Made it to the first 100k subs for the secret channel. Nice
Is that pensatucky?!
So basically someone who doesn't know what subtlety or symbolism are watched Get Out, and then decided to poorly attempt the same thing but also with a current buzzword as the title... And the acting just... Yikes.
Hold up, Mr. Wallace do you make your own music? 🤔
I feel like Taryn's acting is terrible because she understands Karen is the villain of the piece but doesn't understand why. Being so similar to Karen herself, she doesn't know what exactly Karen is doing wrong so her performance feels inauthentic and weird and, imo, like she's doing an impression of a mentally ill person. Like watching these clips, I thought the twist was going to be that Karen has a ~spooky mental illness~ that makes her flagrantly racist.
She sounds drunk the whole time soooo...... it sounds pretty Karen. But yeah....nah. Not executed well.
The insanely attractive young man in the beginning makes me want to watch this entire trailer
He lives
no. just no.
😭😭oh shit i summoned her
the scary music is the funniest part to me cause like the characters be saying the least menacing thing and the music is just TING.......TING.......
the words themselves arent racist, the actions taken can point to racism but saying someone is a racist for anything less than them thinking there race is better than yours is just factually incorrect, and at that point is just a nother slur. btw the "protests" were just an excuse for a lot of people to burn everything, some people cared sure but most dont!
The comments section for the Karen trailer is honestly depressing is just a bunch of people saying that the woke leftist SJWs made this movie.  It's almost as if they don't know what any of these words mean and they just throw it around.
Wasn't she in OITNB? Pensatucky or whatever.
Wow I guess her role in orange is the new black makes complete sense now
This is giving the same vibes as when some company or studio bought and copyrighted the phrase "Okay Boomer" for some tv show they were making...  Which is honestly the most Boomer thing anyone could ever do.
Lowkey wanna be your friend.  Love your vids. Love from 🇵🇷
wow
In before 100k on the alt channel! Here for the cult vibe haha
“I need to laugh at something” that’s why I’m here too
Ironic that the actor who plays Karen is pretty well-known for her performance in Orange is the New Black... where she plays a character way more racist than in this trailer
The acting feels like an arcade craniacs video if their content wouldn't be obviously ironic
What’s hilarious is Taryn Manning also played on orange is the new black as a religious freak , reading her post about trump sounds like her freaking character !
Why does all the dialogue in this movie sound like it's written by people who aren't fluent in English?
scary cause pensatucky in oitnb who taryn manning played was also super conservative and homophobic so maybe she only plays characters she relates to...
When I saw the poster for this movie, I thought it was satire! Apparently not
He spelled Potato like Dan Quail did!…. God I’m old. Lol
Gayle is the only Karen based media I'll support
For a moment I thought the actress for Karen was just Bill Hader in a wig
Ironically the actress playing Karen played a racists meth head on Orange is the New Black.
I think your statements to the contents of the trailer are inconsistent. it starts off slow with relatively harmless stuff, you say it´s downplaying the situation and not portraying actual hardcore racism. Then after they show unwarranted police intervention and things become more intense, you say the trailer is a compilation of "ridiculously over the top racist statements that everybody already knows is racist" and I´m unsure what you´re asking for here. Do you want them to show the most extreme forms that racism takes as you indicate when she whinges about the bins? Do you want the subtle forms of racism that apply to the casual "I´m not racist"-racists? Do you want a transition from casual racist to hardcore racist?  I personally don´t know what to think of thie trailer. Looks weird and not particularly well made but I find it too confusing to get a read on how everything plays out in the movie.
Noooo I loved this actress in Orange Is The New Black
Thats it. I need to talk to the production manager of this movie.
Kaitlyn Bennett, is that you?
I feel like this could have been a good concept for a movie, but god this just looks like a dumpster fire
this movie should not have been put in the horror genre, they wrote it like people in the 90s wrote instructional VHS tapes for kids
Is anyone actually surprised that BET makes trash movies?? 😬
She's fallen a long way from hustle & flow.
Nanananana hold on there's hope, that glockumentary movie is where 100% nigga comes from hahah
He really said he can’t remember when he saw it be created smh like fr he is our real god
not me being early
I'm not American and not black, but it seems like this film has a way of portraying racists as what they think racists talk like. Make them super overtly racist so you know they're definitely racist, no bones about it (like that kid saying "she doesn't like black people not even you"). It's like the script writer put a proverbial racist hat on all the Karen characters and lost all the complexity. When in real life, people are usually much more subtle about being racist- maybe not consciously, but because they've been brought up on films where racists were the baddies, so know what to avoid saying, if you know what I mean? So people won't actively say "I hate black people and I'm actually quite afraid of them, why are they so uppity nowadays?" But they'll use dogwhistles like "I don't see you as black" or "this neighbourhood has gone downhill recently", or they'll act all afraid and call the police through any minor altercation, and emphasise that the person scaring them is black (a la the dogwalking woman). Or they'll say something negative/ disbelieving about affirmative action or the black lives matter movement, minimising it as "WeLl SlAvErY eNdEd 400 YeArS aGo So WhY aRe RePaRaTiOnS NeCeSsArY?".
when d'angelo said that taryn manning is literally the character she's portraying i couldn't help but think of rdj and how he's literally tony stark
can you think about talking about Buck Breaking
Naming a horror movie “Karen” is like naming a murder mystery movie “Sus” and having the main villain dress up as the impostor before killing people
If the movie was a parody, I would 100% watch it.  But it’s taking itself seriously, so nope 😂
Sounds like the Walmart version of Get Out
imagine going from orange is the new black to whatever the fuck this is
They need to write a real Karen script. Like cell phone Karen. Karen who kidnapped the Amazon driver. Or even the Karen who attacked city gas line workers. This movie has flopped before it has even premiered
THE CONFEDERATE FLAG ON THE SOAP DISPENSER I CANT
EW NASTY TRAILER, that's how i feel
“Guys guys when I was seven I touched not one but TWO black people”
i really thought it was a joke when i first saw it
She said to take the bins off the curb when they've been emptied but after she 0ushes it over trash falls out??? Looks like they're just waiting for the garbo babe chill out
Sus
the fact she took this role from orange is the new black-
Was Karen the actress from Orange is the new black?? Pensutucky? (I don’t know how to spell this)
This is just a terrible attempt at these companies trying to capitalize off the BLM movement, and the worst thing is it’s gonna be used by like people who don’t like BLM to be like, look how stupid these BLM people are.
I wish the little girl said “she doesn’t like black people” like Kanye
south texas? oof, that’s tough - i’m sorry for you.
not me being the 1029th comment
I think Coke Daniels got the script for Karen by rummaging through Jordan Peele's trash and finding an early draft that he abandoned.
Is that the lady from Orange is the New Black???
How tf is someone as beautiful as this man come from fucking Texas?
NOOOO TARYN NOOOOOOOO
the amount of ads i have gotten on this video is sad
It looks like a parody. The title reminds me of the title for the movie 'Greta'.
Walton D'Fangelo... how many channels do you need with your own name?
This is a riverdale episode
Pennsatucky??
it's canon that D'angelo is an omnipotent being who's been around since the dawn of time
They are trying to make a movie, about a serious issue with a meme. Yeah they should of stopped there
As a white man I do not know a single white supremacist. I don’t know anyone who knows one. An occasional racist? Yes, but I have seen that in all races. In fact I prefer to refer to everyone as homage kind or man kind. Stop being played.
Dhar Mann's Get Out
I'm glad I wasn't the only one who thought this looked like a bad SNL sketch.
I can't find the other D'angilo Wallace channel.. :((
Yes, our great leader has returned to is!!! Welcome back
Nice keyboard in the back! I'm having my own keyboard arrive tomorrow :)
How did she go from Hustle and Flow to Karen?!? I hope she got payed a lot
Hey, I'm if anyone else has had this problem but I cannot find D'Angelo's new channel. Can someone point me in the right way?
Shake. My. Head.
I'd suggest everyone to watch American History X, I feel like Karen the movie is trying to send the same message but ahx does it a hundred TIMES BETTER !!!!
Is this seriously the best booking Taryn Manning could get after Orange Is The New Black? 😭
This is a perfect example of people capitalizing on racism as a hot topic. Reminds me of the corporate inclusivity statements that circulate LinkedIn and benefit the employer only.
missed you. 🤍
I literally require this to be satire.
Ummm everyone knows that Karens’ real names are never Karen. Actual people named Karen are usually pretty cool 😎
reminds me of this other movie i tried watching with my mum once that was described as "inspired by jordan peele" (and note how fuckin tiny the 'insipred' part was) and literally it was so confusing and unorganised we had to stop watching cuz i was so mad at the film i started crying  like, i was laughing hysterically at how angry this movie made me to the point it drew tears outta me, so its 10 pm in our quiet lil cul-de-sac and im screaming cuz im so mad while mum's just laughing at me lmao  guess that means i def gotta go see this movie at some point
“The day I saw it created”
I was in the #1 100,000 😳
Looks like a silly spoof, therefore undermining the whole "message"
They couldn’t even depict a Karen correctly and honestly why do they keep dragging black people in their shenanigans...literally we’re paid dust until someone wants to make a film about racism or a comedy
I'm not the most enlightened or knowledgeable on race issues but even I know that BET is pretty controversial in the Black Community. The Onion once ran the headline "Sale of BET to White Supremacist Group Results In No Changes to Programming". It's pretty safe to say they've got something of a bad reputation.
BET isn't even black owned.
The series “Them” seemed heavily influenced by Jordan Peele but the fact of the matter is the acting was good and the horror was actually there in Karen it seems like it was a CENT store version of Jordan Peele movies
I like how they use Taryn Manning(Dogget) to play as Karen.
😂😂😂😂😂 “Karen character Karen character Karen character” 😂
I mean , I get what they are going for and why. I'm just confused on why this is the way they are going about with a message like this.
This trailer made me go ‘’ deep sigh.:……..Childe anyways🙄
our budget karen sounds drunk and on a lot of meds with fresh dental work
We not talking about CSA? Oh.. ok
I’m enjoying this cult so far^^
When I first saw the trailer, I thought - is this supposed to be some sort of parody? I realized it isn't and it's just.... No
I’ve cracked it! The Russians! It’s the Russians!
so hes starting a podcast for sure like everyone else.... Cool cool cool
fuck this movie. what a joke
Wasn't she in orange is the new back?
She looks like the mayor from over the hedge
This is just a clickbait movie. No different than a Hallmark?Lifetime/SYFY original movie. Made to be trashed, and to get free press. Funny sure. But they just want your attention.
It feels like she is in a parody
They really released that trailer with confidence lmao
That's Pennsatucky from Orange is the New Black! She was really unhinged in that show, too, seems to be her acting style. I didn't hear about the Instagram stuff. Yikes. This movie looks absurd. Definitely trying to riff on Jordan Peele's success
Wait until the secret channel is the main channel
Day 1 of asking for more episodes on the Office Husband Podcast
I find it hilarious that this movie is actually getting made
When she got asked what her neighbors were like, I was really expecting her to be like, "Hmm, what should I say... Urban??" And then laugh at her own "joke." But she really just said, "They're Black." I can't.
A little fyi Taryn Manning played the white girl in Hustle An Flow I thought she was amazing.
You’re back ! We missed you 🥰
1:10 SIR, YOU DID NOT JUST DO THAT
Isn't the Karen played by the girl in Crossroads who was pregnant? I see her career has really taken a backslide since then😞
Like. I like the concept, kinda giving me the same vibes that movie with Beyonce had where the woman was stalking her husband. Just. Don't like the execution...
“As a black people in America...” hehe
If you’re going to make a movie about a very important social issue, don’t base it off of a meme. And make the movie actually watchable, because this movie looks like a disaster.
The cringe is unreal omfg 🤣🤣🤣
Is that...Pennsytucky from Orange is the New Black?
imagine being in Orange is the New Black, and being more racist in that than in the movie you're SUPPOSED to be a racist asshole in
I’m confused on why he needs 3 different channels
This looks absolutely horrible. Can't wait for it to drop so I can get high and watch it with my friends.
Why tho
My boyfriend sent me this trailer at 3AM last night and the only thing I was able to say was “I can’t wait for D’Angelo to see this”
The woman from the original Central Park call was a way better actress
He has returned!
yall pennsatucky(from orange is the new black(taryn manning)) is the karen???  she’s always played annoying white people. this really isnt too new for her, but i did enjoy her character in ointb.
I honestly wasn't surprised by the trailer once I saw the bet logo.
Gasp, the video is over 10min...! What did I miss...? Where have I been?! (• ▽ •;)
Thinking that I first saw this lady in Orange is the New Black, playing a super religious racist homophobe makes me wonder if maybe her acting range is "herself"...
i want to see the movie tho so
why is pensatucky in a bad wig larping as a karen
Was Karen in Orange is the New Black?
not to be a Karen but I would really like to speak to the producer of this movie
Is that the crazy religious lady from oitnb?
I'm canceling earth right now!
Sad that the movie is not taking place at a Walmart, AppleBees, Wendy's, CrackerBarrel, TJMaxx, Kohls, Old Navy, Lord and Taylor, Abercrombie and Fitch, H&M, Banana Republic, Starbucks, Micheals, Joaan Fabrics or Holisters as it's the perfect ecosystem for the Karens and even the legendary Gertrudes
Who made the potato salad is a masterpiece. You should try it
I missed you so much 💕 I got a good laugh out of this video by the way 🤣
AM I THE ONLY ONE NOTICING HOW THE KAREN CHARACTER IS THE SAME PERSON WHO PLAYED DOGGET IN OITNB?!?!?!
I think the fact its straight to the point and so obvious is the actual point of it. Being a white woman I have come across this attitude which is now said out loud in the same way Karen put it across. And yes a person who tells you to take your rubbish bin in will also knock it down.
They couldn’t be any more subtle…?
14:20 *unfortunately?*
D'Angelo is incredible at creating his own personal lore. Example: 0:06
DONT TAKE ME, WORLD DO DOMINATION THO, YAY
omfg that girl played on orange is the new black
Wearing hats in the summer, it's 90 out king
THE KING HAS RETURNED
I’m still having trouble believing it’s actually real… I don’t think I ever will like I still think it is some kind of social experiment 🤡🤡💀✨
So Tarin Manning wasn't acting in Orange is The New Black, that was just who she is
yay!!! New content!! Adore you and missed you!
okay hard WOW on the transition into the ad read that was indeed smooth af
I loved the transition for the ad read so much that I didn't even skip it like I usually would
couldn’t they choose the name shannon or something instead of karen when they made the manager meme in the first place 😭😭
I feel like this movie is made for white racists who don't know they're racist.  It just depends whether they're going to absolutely love it or absolutely hate it*
The girl that plays Karen was in orange is the new black... which literally talks about racism and police brutality at points yet she still thought that BLM was a bad thing?
Um didn’t the actress who plays Karen use to be in orange is the new black? How did she end up here that show was so good 😭
Us black people will never get a break. The media always milks our racial trauma and use it for views, clout, and money. I’m tired..
the lead actor is also in orange is the new black. She also plays a pretty shitty character in that
Last time I was this early Karen didn't exist
D'Angelo Wallace dangelowallace D'ANGELO WALLACE  when we getting D'AnGeLo WaLlAcE and D'Angelo WALLACE?
I am part of the first 100k. I subscribed at 90.3k
Dude. Taryn Manning was in Orange is the New Black. She played this insane religious character, so her post on Instagram is kind of ironic.
The actress who is playing Karen is much better at acting than this. Did she owe the director a favor?! This looks worse than a lifetime movie.
Fun blooper fact, if you look closely, you can sometimes see a fucking cab indoors in some scenes!
Early
woah! this is the fucking worst movie trailer ever
So glad to see you back D’Angelo !! :)
Why does this whole thing seem like a parody?
The soundtrack REALLY sounds like it should be in a horror movie.
I'd be embarrassed to be credited for this lmao
There was no horror in that trailer at all I got a huggies commercial in between and the thought of babies scared me more
Your transition to the ad read gave me such a good chuckle
will not ask questions. will be part of that first 100 thousand people who subscribed.
Pretty shit trailer
Feels bad, But if you wanna see a better version of the "Racism + Horror" Genre. THEM is pretty good series to check out.
I love how they played the horror music when she said "we're living next door to a racist" as if plenty of  Black people don't live near/next door to racists. Like is that supposed to be where the scares come in? That's just a lot of people's reality...
As a black woman, racism and micro aggressions are very subtle. Racism is the little things people who aren’t oppressed can’t see.
I honestly don’t think this movie is meant to be serious. I’m getting trolling vibes.
one of the first 100k 🤪
lol the karen actress is really famous though lol, she'S been in a lot of stufd
It may be trash but cant say they didnt market well bc of how ridiculous a "karen" movie looks, it captures attention
“let that sink in. just kidding there’s no where for it to sink, we’re already in the sunken place apparently.” IM ROLLING 💀
In the words of the great Randy Jackson, "That's gonna be a 'no' from me, dog."
what else is that actress from? i cant put my finger on it
i trust you when it comes to your ads. also, i don’t even know how you do it… but i’m pretty sure you got EVEN hotter then you WERE??? like please share your secret
#breadceumbs 😳🤝😩‼️😣😰😘😋💕🤔🥺😝🛐👎🥰🤯🥵😣💕😐😰🤩🤨🤪🤪🥸😜😎😔😟😫😤😭
Let's goooo, I'm one of the first 90.1 thousand people
My initial thoughts:  "Why does she look like the mom from Coraline?" "OH MY GOD IT'S PENNSATUCKY!"
Wait is that Taryn Manning from OITNB?? This is honestly disappointing lmao
Is this supposed to be "funny" or is it meant to be a "B" movie? Because then ~maybe~ it could be enjoyable on an ironic or like a "so bad its hilarious" level?!?! Or are they really going for some kind of serious commentary here?
The amount of betrayal I felt. 3:41
The trailer seems more like a parody/gag youtube trailer a group of friends made for fun. And if it was that then I'm sure the result would be a lot more interesting than whatever this is gonna be.
You know what I like though? That beanie you're wearing. You make it look good.
Thank you for coming back to us 💜
didn’t she also play a white supremacist in orange is the new black? maybe don’t make your type the racist
YAYYYY WORLD DOMINATION!!!
1:12 I thought you were gay until I realized it’s just you sponsoring stuff 😂🏳️‍🌈 I shoulda known lmao
So undramatic and subtle just like I like it. :-)
Seems like it’s pushing the idea that racism is perpetuated by a few malicious individuals rather than being systematic. Could be wrong but the quality of the trailer doesn’t inspire confidence
its so weird too because that actress has been in a lot of other things (hustle & flow, orange is the new black, etc.) and is rly good in them. makes no sense. got all fucked up in editing? maybe it tested poorly and they fucked it up changing it trying to plz test audiences? nah, its shit. EDIT: I wrote this before you put up Taryns long post. fuck her
I've missed your content king!!
I saw this on Hasan's stream and damn... psychological racial thrillers is best left to Jordan Peele and not who ever made this...
#thatsprettysus
makes me think of those cheesy, 'mockumentary's' you're forced to watch at school in assembly.
Did that just say it was a BET original film? Who at BET had the idea for this movie and then decided to act on that thought?
The film looks uh..... Interesting
Nooooooo Pennsatucky!!! Why would you do this to us?
The moment I saw it was Taryn I was curious why she'd play two super racist characters, Karen and the girl the played in Orange is the New Black.
TIFFANY DOGGETT??
Karen played Pensatucky in OITNB, who was initially a homophobic and bigoted woman. Why does she like roles like these?
man the acting is so bad. how is it THAT bad?
why
"Potatoe is misspelled" no it's not that's a valid spelling
Hi, genuine question: has Deangelo Wallace addressed the creepshow art situation? I'm not caught up on his twitch and I'm wondering if he's doing alright...
ig i’m officially a fool🤝
Alternative title: They’re making a Karen movie, and it’s just as bad as it sounds.
They are trying to kill the Karen meme. No worries we will come up with a new name.
This trailer feels like a dhar Mann video
Is 'Them' racist enough for you?
To be fair, poor grammar and incorrect use of “big” words is actually VERY Karen-like Speaking as someone who has seen maaaaany Karen vids
I love how you have three YouTube channels with the same name spelled differently. One of them being a secret channel that doesn’t immediately come up when we search your name but almost has 100k followers. You’re literally a genius mastermind.
But Karen's can be any race, I encountered a black karen at a chipotle. But yes please review the movie it looks painfully bad.
BET is not owned by Black people sooooooo … it makes sense 😂
6:09 sus?
I legit want to see the Karen movie
The main character looks and sounds like she has a brain injury
I’m officially a fool
as a black people in america
can't wait to not see this movie and watch fourty six videos on slamming it to the ground instead
as a black people in america 😌
He sat there and waited and now I am a fool...I'm here for it
Bruh why is this even a movie? 🤣🤣🤣
CAN WE CLOCK THE TERRIBLE LACE WIG
the fact that the actress in karen was in orange is the new black…
Maybe the emoji movie wasn't that bad
Oh gods, this was too cringe...
"However old the earth is I do not remember the day i saw it created"  D'Angelo is god confirmed
You and Linus are very close with transitions, you win though
definitely a podcast
I feel like this movie is making racism an individual problem rather than a deeply rooted systemic issue. Like if we just get rid of all the Karens and their racist cop brothers everything will be solved. One of the things Get Out did great was that it wasn't just these Frankenstein stanning rich white people who were the problem, it was a whole system that they both benefited from and perpetrated. Rodney not being able to get anyone to believe him was both hilarious and also a bit of a bleak reminder of how when people are alerted to these systems in place, their first reaction is to dismiss the messenger. Anyway that's just my White Girl opinions.
Can we talk about how the whole trailer is basically the whole movie
So glad you’re back! I hope you’re doing ok
I'm going to call it now. In a few years D'Angelo will become a conservative Republican. When he does the Right will welcome him with open arms.
Why why
as soon as that BET logo showed up, u should've known that the movie was gonna be shit
d'angelo i think the world was probably created when you were born i don't remember anything from before that
If you told me this was a scrapped SNL skit I would not even blink twice
This really feels like a bad SNL skit
you should add more blues clues elements in your videos
“As a black people in America” as a fellow black people here I felt that 😆 (lmaooo hey everyone in the response comments 👋)
Hold on, lemme just:   **puts on fangirl face**  HI D'ANGELO I LOVE YOU SO MUCHHHHH
I don't know, not everything has to show hardcore racism. If that's all people showed then we wouldn't be able to recognize more subtle forms. This is unbelievably soft, but I don't see it being a bad image unless this is the only movie or outlet that a person has ever heard about racism from and citing this one movie that looks like a lengthy student film probably would only hold up for people who already thought that way and I doubt it would've changed their mind either way.
that was the smoothest transition into an ad read that i've seen all week. you are, (a confirmed) professorial, d'angleo. wonderful video :)
So it's Get Out but made as a Saturday Night Live Skit
Y'all heard of the CAREN act?
"it's an A" made me lol
I sse that midi controller in the back. DeAngelo got some 🔥🔥 beats I bet.
good sir.. all week? more like all time
Also try saying Taryn’s a Karen 5 times fast.
Capitalism will try to make a profit off of anything. The callousness is sickening.
Dahr Mann feels left out guys 🥵
Taryn Manning is actually a good actress, she was great in OITNB and Sons of Anarchy, but in this trailer everything is weird.
My thoughts: gross, can’t believe they let dhar Mann do a feature film
Hi. Don’t worry, I’m human.
I swear they always wanna have a inspiring film then it turns into shit lmao they just copy to they can have clout they don’t put anything in it
This EXACT movie came out 13 years ago except the roles were reversed. Lakeview Terrace (Samuel L Jackson)
CHECK THE WEBSITE IN THE ABOUT SECTION OF THE NEW CHANNEL!!!!
Hollywood still tryna cash in on any and every “trending” word or term or situation…. Instead of tryna come up with something that’s entertaining, as in distracts us from the daily dumpster fire that is life, which is why most of us watch movies/series
Hi I needed this today ty ❤️
my godmother's name is Karen :(
can you please show off your piano!? It looks amazing? Also music if you're comfortable sharing it
I always thought of Karen's as unsexy white women saying things like "wear your mask, don't be a spreader", and they always want everyone to know that even though they are white they believe in BLM. I'm white, and I don't spend 2 seconds of my day thinking about either. I know plenty of fucked up people in every color imaginable, and I avoid them like a plague. I support people that help other people, and that aren't assholes.
the Karen actress is from Orange is the New Black...
It's crazy that the lady playing Karen was in Orange is the New Black. She played her character in that show so well, but her acting in this trailer seems cringe. 😬
Taryn Manning also played a racist in Orange is the New Black.
omfg i bust a lung at “serving my wife divorce papers at 3am prank free iphone giveaway”-acting
Before actually seeing this I deadass thought it was satire or something
I loved her in OITNB -- what happened?!? lol
It seems to me they are under the delusion they are making something as ground breaking as get out is. I hope no one takes this movie seriously
Uh idk, the main actress played the racist girl in Orange Is The New Black really well so…She probably really is like that…
AH IS THAT DOGGETT
Why does Karen look like The Other Mother?
THIS MOVIE IS MADE BY A BLACK PERSON????LORDDDD
I subbed to the secret channel, it's at 89k right now. Good to see I reserved my pre-100k seat ✌
IM SO EARLY HEY YALLLLL
Ok the thing I don’t like about the karen movie is that the Karen character is just a caricature of a “Karen” that just panders to the Karen memers. It’s literally not a social commentary or anything. It’s just “write down all the stereotypical and blatant racist saying and then play some horror music”
They got pensatucky playing Karen? 😭 And nobody’s talking about it???
Do you think you're gonna talk about the creep show art situation? Don't blame you if you don't. Seems like hurtful a mess.
“As a black people in America”
Taryn Manning, you're better than this! Or maybe not but 🤷🏼‍♀️. My sister is her biggest fan.
I love you
OK, here's my opinion. You don't have to agree, but here it is. I would rather have a documentary made that talks about people and their experiences with racism and people also talking about the history of racism in America. And explains why its wrong and explains all the misinformation spread about minority groups. I would rather watch that then a Karen wanna be horror movie with the acting of a 7th grade theatre production.   Edit: thanks for the likes, didn't think people would agree with me this much. Anyway have a good day!
Of course it's played by that woman from oitnb that was a toothless karen😬
Praise God
Ohhhhhh honey... Orange is the new black......stick to it....not this. Smh
Noooo
I love Taryn Manning but this movie looks cringey.
this trailer is the definition of cringe...
The studio that’s making this movie is playing us by taking our money straight to the bank
idk this feels like both an under and over exaggeration of everything going on in the us. either way wow is it poorly executed
Cant Believe pensentucky left prison and became a karen
Went from making shitty mobile games in 2021 to shitty movies
Hi. Mr.Wallace.  I love you that is all.💕💕
she played a character (I forgot the name) on Orange is the New Black 😩
It could have been a good satire film but they made the whole film into a joke.
The trailer feels like a youtube parody
It seemed like she kicked over the recycling bin before the truck even came to pick it up so why is she so pressed about it being there?
Just so you know, the actress playing Karen also played a racist white woman in Orange is the New Black, too. Weird consistent choice of roles...
I think this is actually real horror film, well trying to be. If i was them i would bring in a real life wild Karen on the set, but a very HARDCORE one. Karens are a weird breed of white middle age woman, so get one that will actually play the part. And i would like the movie take place either south Texas or California or Florida (im Canadian so i don't know that much racist states) Including real racist comments, cuz the ones from the trailer....are soo dumb ig. But either way the movie will be shit.
The IMDb trivia... That's it. Go check that out.
Why would anyone want to see this movie?? Do we really need to pay to see something so obtuse?
SO GLAD YOU'RE BACK !!!
it made my skin crawl im so nauseous
that truly was the smoothest ad read transition. standing ovation
It's hilarious to me that the girl who originally posted the trailer on Twitter ended up deleting it because Ben Shapiro quoted the tweet and she didn't wanna give him free clout.
D’angelo :👁👄👁 - the world being created
tell me you’re running out of movie ideas without actually telling me you’re running out of movie ideas..
I subbed before 100k and I'll be honest, world domination would only work with D'Angelo so it's a good thing he thought it up before anyone else.
I was not expecting Taryn Manning 😭😭
How far Taryn Manning has fallen!
“What is that-like an F sharp?” “It’s an A” Yup I totally understood that, thank you
i think it’s super dangerous to frame extreme racists as “karens” !
is that doggett from oitnb 😭😭
got to the new channel before 100 thousand :)
I think this movie is gonna be trash but that was already obvious
Reminds me of an SNL skit 😂
That acting is acting like it’s acting 😳
I was peacefully eating my breadsticks and not even A MINUTE in, and I had to do a double-take. "A commentary on the injustices black people face at the hands of KARENS..." hmm...what the actual fu** is that nonsense?!?
You just asked what everyone thought about it, so my response is.  I don’t like it.
are we gonna watch it together on stream bestie
KAREN is a waste of film
I saw the trailer when it came out. It's giving me straight to DVD vibe
It  really does feel like an snl skit
Just what the 2020s needed - Another movie in the likes of Crash.
I think I they picked the right actress for this part of Karen but this movie is… boo boo
I'm glad I'm officially a fool now, as opposed to when I was an unofficial fool.
Taryn Manning did a great job in orange is the new black (imo). WTF was this!?!!!?! I had no idea she was pro-trump / anti-BLM. What a loser.
It looks like a terrible movie. And that was just the trailer.  Also, you have like 3 channels. MOSSAD agent perhaps?
He is back finally, our king is here
I think I they picked the right actress for this part of Karen but this movie is… boo boo
I wonder if Jordan Peele face palms every time he sees people make Get Out knock offs for cash grabs.
The insanely attractive young man talking about the sponsorship for 1 minute was better cinematography than the Karen film for an hour
love knowing ive subscribed to every d'angelo wallace channel before it hit 100k
budget Amy Poehler which is confusing because it makes me think this is supposed to be a comedy
… i have no words.
Omg I literally just looked at your channel, minutes before you posted this, thinking 'where are you?'... and almost wrote that under your last video. So... thanks for reading my mind!
Aaayyyy! It’s Crossroads
no black person asked for this, what were they thinking
“far from a racist” PLS IM GONNA CRY WHAT DID SHE THINK SHE WAS DOING WITH THAT
that transition into sponsor was the smoothest I have ever seen
I did
When she knocked over the trash can there shouldn't hove been any trash in it, like it should have already been picked up if she was upset about it.
First of all the main character IS karen. Are we supposed to relate and sympathize with her?? It should be shot mostly from the black families perspective you can tell this is true because the last shot in the trailer is of her 😒 this is entertainment for racist and soon to be racist will be taking notes. Who's the targeted audience!? What's the message here!?
"smoothest transition you've seen in a week"  more like in my entire life-
How many channels have you got🤯
bro this mfing karen looks like a goth gen x mom not a fucking karen stereotype lmfao
Why does this need to exist. They aren’t adding anything to the important conversation at hand and instead serve as almost a mockery.
Wait I'm early for a D'angelo Wallace video?
Get Out this most certainly ain’t.
your finally back I missed you.
The plot twist is: the karen in this trailer played in orange is the new black (an also insane character) and she played that one flawlessly. Idk what change here
The trailer seems to demean black people and feels racist in itself. Just because this is an issue- doesn't mean we need to glorify it through a movie.  Edit: Y'all genuinely give me hope in this world. So glad to see so many people aware and compassionate. 🙌
"...because of course there's absolutely no way this can go wrong :)" Hold on, my popcorn isn't ready yet LOL
this dead ass feels like what a edgy 15 year old tumblr teen would make after being on leftist twt for 3 minutes
This seems more like a university student's film that they had to make for their Senior Seminar in Cinema Studies.
I was one of the first 100k!  I feel almost as special as D'Angelo is <3
Damn, wtf is OISTNB Pensatucky really pensatucky irl???
It’s not a prank? Oooooooh nooooooooo
Oh no Pennsatucky
The mayopopcornsalad of movies.
It’s an A ! 😂😂
*HOLD UP* That's the racist character from OITNB!!!
Is...is that Pennsatucky?
I’m white so I’m not going to act offended on behalf of a community I’m not apart of but a film like this feels like it can do more harm because what is it’s point? Honestly it’s terrible acting, directing and it desensitises viewers to the severity of white people abusing stigmas and being racist
Watching the trailer just made me uncomfortable especially with the actor of Karen it just makes me feel not safe
they talked briefly about this movie on the news earlier and i genuinely thought it was a joke trailer?? like when they talk about viral videos from facebook because there’s nothing to report on, not an *actual movie*
D'Angelo's humor is immaculate and his delivery makes it dryer than that one spot on your elbow
"Slaving away"??? I LOST IT
Damn I’m one of the first 100,000 on the new channel 😎 let’s go
why am i commenting like this is twitch chat?
I think like u said , it just shows what we see every day the basic typical racism … not that it shouldn’t be shown but we all already know about and see it all the time and we just tired of black ppl being in racist, struggle, drugs, poor sports movies like we just want something else or to be in more happy stuff or regular movies and not our trauma and racism we face and it just shows that they lowkey just want money to “relatable” things regarding racism and not really addressing the actual problem behind racism and solutions and justice like using racism as entertainment more than actually informing and educating …that’s just me tho
Did anyone else notice that Karen is Pennsatucky?
😂 Dammit I said Karen character like 7 times before messing up and I'm about to go to work. I guess I'll test this theory..
why was the trailer imovie quality
me saying 'karen character' like ten times and my mom just 'shows up'
not me hopping in as soon as i saw this was uploaded, missed you!
I thought this was a satire film that should be laughed at....LOUD...and HARD.😆😆😆😆
Well if she is the character she' poytraying than atleast now we know the dialogue is so bad because she wasn't acting
wowie this is painful!
I Lowkey kinda like it
I don’t like horror movies at all but this has me on the floor laughing. Like if your going to make a movie like this do better.
How did the actress playing Karen go from Orange is the New Black to this?
Glad to see you back! Hope you're feeling a little better and taking care of yourself man <3
the scriptwriters really said “show not tell? nah we can’t afford that it’s now tell not show of vastly inaccurate depictions of an actual social issue that causes people to literally die… ” and then put a magical filter on that screams 15year old edgy tumble teen
FORREST GUMP what are you doing here 😭😭😭😭😭😭
It looks like a funny or die skit that died 30 times  over
Is this 2020: The Movie without the pandemic?
They really just made a mockery of modern day racism and did the opposite of what they claimed to do.......the epitome of black square on ig activism 😂
the 1 person who disliked is a karen
That young man in the ad read was so attractive. You got the right person for the read, D'Angelo.
she’s portraying a character that’s literally herself and she’s not even good at that.
When we said we wanted more diversity in movies, we did not mean this
WAIT IS THAT PENSETUCKY FROM ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK??💀
Ok loc journey I see you👏👏👏
The other thing with Jordan Peele rip offs, is that they miss the subtle nature of his writing. Get Out for example doesn't work if the parents are rude and racist to Chris right off the bat. Jordan Peele lures you in by making them nice white liberal covert/unintentional racists. He even makes them seem overly accepting and tolerant. Then BOOM. The suspense and the switch up. Especially with the girlfriend. Versus....this trash lol.
*FACEPALM *
Yessir
r/entitledparents: the movie
The King has returned!
Why are we even giving Karen’s attention at all? They’re arrogant, uncaring and just plain awful. Let the, be amongst themselves away from the rest of society and not give them any credit at all.
This is the first time i see this trailer and it looks like a cheap parody of bad movie what
1. It's BET  2. It's like they took every stereotype about Karen and poured it into one movie.   It just comes off feeling ike a parody more than anything else.
The tiny guitar(ukulele?) and polaroid are so cute! I appreciate them matching
I’m trying not to de-combust this is too funny 😭
Never, EVER been this early.   Your content is something i look forward to. Which is weird.. I don't really use youtube. Listen to your commentary while i work.  double noice.
Where's the horror?? I just see a regular WEEK as a black person/ family.
And I-oop not them trying to be Get Out, a film that's actually a masterpiece
Not gonna lie, this movie would be a huge box office win if it was comedic and meant solely for irony
not everything’s needs to be a movie 😄
That’s some Dhar Mann level acting.
So happy to see youuu
you got me with the ad read, 10 out of 10
I thought you had perfect pitch for a second lmao
NO WHAT THE FCK IS THIS MOVIE
This seems like a fake trailer for an SNL movie
Welp I'm a fool
To think thats the same actress as the hillbilly from orange is the new black makes me wanna off myself.
This is a soft core version of “Them”.
I've never heard a Karen say "comply"? It's too....overt...
guess whose back back again
One like just for the segue way
When D’Angelo waited for the audience to say “Karen Character” 3 times I flashed back to watching Dora the Explorer 😂
hey bestie welcome back we missed you <3
This movie is taking hyperbole to a *WHOLE* new level
I'm sorry, but the fact that they chose TARYN MANNING for this role just ruins everything for me, KARENS ARE BLONDE, don't have baby voices, that haircut, and have previously played every trashy/junkie role ever. It doesn't work. The acting is exactly like shitty porn.
PRANKING MY WIFE WITH DIVORCE PAPERS AT THREE AM I PHONE GIVEAWAY ACTING is very accurate tho like these guys should never be posting these videos like we know those wife gasps ain’t real
Omg another "Black people in starring roles but only when they get harrassed, tortured and/or murdered by white people" movie? Predictable and disappointing :D
My only question, is where is the plot...?
We really monetize everything, huh. Also this look! So freaking pretty
I think the Karen meme is hilarious, but this just seems like it is being taken way too far. I have a sister who is named Karen, and she is considering going by her middle name just because this whole thing is getting kinda out of hand. :/  I look forward to seeing this movie come out, bomb, and then all the juicy reviews that will follow. :D
the horror music in the background is literally the best thing about this movie i cant stop laughing at how stupid it is
yeah that transition was pretty smooth
You’ve heard of the Karen movie…  NOW GET READY FOR TWITTER THE MOVIE
d'angelo's favorite word: unironically
Heyo D'Angelo glad your back king!!
"You're officially a fool" too late already was one
closet tour please
WAIT THATS PENSATUCKY!!!! I LOVE HER, I HOPE THIS DOESNT RUIN HER CAREER ONGDKFBWL.    actually idek, it looks like pensatucky tryna be a Karen.
The acting is kinda.. bland?? Like they're not really into it, and honestly neither would I if I was in the movie
a human that is mentally stable named their child coke is not mentally stable.
D’Angelo: “This insanely handsome man” Me: This must be a pretty handsome man D’Angelo is the handsome man Me: ;—;
white womans Instagram do be vibing in the undertones of this trailer tho
Not Pennsatucky as Karen lmao
This movie should be placed next to the word “unnecessary” in the dictionary.
This movie feels like such a bad joke.
This seems like a parody lifetime movie
D'Angelo: Did u did it? Me being scared already: YES you bet I did😭
Omg but that is how the Karen videos are lol 😂 and there is a Karen video out there just like that. Omfg it’s so bad.
the king is back
D'Angelo is god you can't change my mind
Yessss
Thank you thank you 😊
Is this real????
He’s back🥲
pennsatucky better pop off is all i gotta chile- 😭✋🏽
Nice, now let me talk to your manager
Today is so awesome. I got my first dose of the vaccine, a new episode of Loki came out, and now the king himself uploaded a new video.
„It’s an A“ yeah string a couple of those together and you get my feelings toward this trailer
Everyone wants to get their “Get Out” movie praise without being talented or revolutionary in anyway 🙄
The king is back
“there she is slaving away in the kitchen” i’m sorry what-
This movie should be a joke
we should feel honored to be able to gaze upon our kind again
Me: accidentally summoning a Karen by saying "Karen character" 3 times fast
Not him calling me a fool
These kinds of movies are why we bigfoots hide in the wilderness
Hello dangerlow I ham misted you.   I gave in to YouTube aggressivley and obsessively recommending me JSC criminal whatever channel in your absence.
list of iconic youtubers with perfect pitch: -d’angelo -eddy chen -brett yang-
Yay ur back we missed you bro
this seems like a dhar mann film
Hope you're well
that ad read transition was so beautiful i rolled my eyes in awe
I feel like I just said "Beetlejuice" three times.
Yay, content..My Youtube's been so dry without D'Angelo
💟
yeah im about to never hear the end of this from my republican family.
We need a look book D’Angelo, you outfits are pure chefs kiss
Karen needs to be about the annoyance that Karen’s cause, not…this…
How tf is there already a thumbs down?! Such idiots, they haven't even seen the video they're just disliking for no reason *smh*
yea…no, they didn’t need to make this
My sister showed me the trailer, and I thought it was just some bad school project she made
Uh 3 questions. Uh. Why? How? (was this approved) And.. Is this a horror movie? Because it really should be.
Smooth Move Tea Transition
Man died after playing that note… and thought the whole trailer. We thank D’Angelo for going through this and putting us through this as well…
We missed you, king. Hope you’re doing better! 🥰
D'angelo playing the piano and being happy asf is so warming and wholesome to see 🥺❤
They never find representation for dark skin black women, but only want to do so in a traumatic film, let that sink in! 🖐🏾
Don’t tell me you haven’t watched “Gangsta Rap: The Glockumentary” 🙄. It’s the best movie to bless the 21st Century!
Why haven’t humans gone extinct if this is what our brains create 😃
The absence of laughter is truly deafening…
i’m so happy he’s back
Okay but Taryyn Manning as Karen?  I’m so confused.
“It’s an A” 😂.
we've been here for at least 6 million years and we still can't make good movies
The whole point of naming these people Karen was to show how pathetic they are, to show that we won't be intimidated by entitled idiots who think they have power over poc, _why make her a "menacing" killer???_
I honestly thought the trailer was a joke..💀
This is a horror movie I thought it was a comedy
I’m so early yay
I watched the Karen movie trailer because you mentioned it earlier today. So much cringe
"insanely handsome" doesn't even begin to describe that young man😩
Huh, no
“As a black people” is the best line I’ve ever heard
The fact that the woman playing Karen is known for her old roles where she spoke AAVE.
I see the casual hang time flex during the ad roll, I see you! 😌👐🏾
Let me make this clear YouTube:  The only person's vibe check I actually care about passing is D'Angelo's. Period. 😌
Let Dhar Mann direct this. He'd probably be better then whoever Netflix was gonna let direct this movie.
Im watching this while getting stains out of my carpet. Thank you D'angelo.
IS KAREN THAT GIRL FROM ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK??????
This movie is like Mean girls 2
Hope you're doing better you angelic baby😭💕
We don't talk about how beautiful D'Angelos hair is and how much it's grown.
I was rewatching your last stream when I got your notification
I have never clicked FASTER
d'angelo looks like he drinks monster energy but ✨classy✨
is this what the world has come to?? they said we were gonna have flying cars in 2020, if we did, I would've used it to fly to neptune already.
This is gonna be funny but also dogshit
“It’s an *A*” Lol, I love you D’Angelo. Also “This is like ‘Serving My Wife Divorce Papers at 3am Prank | Free iPhone give away’ acting” lol
Early-ish ???
Can you pleeeeeeaaaassssseeeeeee heart my comment? 🖤🤍🖤🤍🖤🤍I have loved your content since early 2020! (don’t take this as a way of me saying that you owe me lol). 😭
THE SEGUE TO THE AD WAS SO SMOOTH MY SKIN WILL BE CLEAR FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK
This movie is almost like they picked up a 5 minute snl skit then made it an hour
Ok, this killed the Karen meme so fast. It's dead and life has no meaning.
would like to say i’m officially a fool
I have NEVER missed a yt creator more!!
Lets appreciate how D'angelo allows us to live in his world
w h at is th i s
i literally screamed when i saw this vid on my yt homepage WE MISSED U KING
D’angelo be the Karen to my manager 🥺🥺🥺
There's no way this went through teams of people who thought it was a good idea 💀 and to make it horror too? NO!
You do not know how much I've missed his voice
D’angelo are you friends with Shanon aka Creepshow art? I do not know if you know about this and I am sorry if this hurts your feelings, but shanon made some insulting tweets on a gossip called  lolcow about you and many other people. Remember it is alleged.
2:03 Idk Cinema Summary is smooth as hell with it
people always love profiting off of black struggle...its upsetting
WHAT
you had me at "insanely attractive young man"
Speaking from someone who studies script writing religiously, this whole film is just...a choice
OMG IM LIKE EXTREMLEY EARLY HIIII D'ANGELO ILY <3
this movie does have a *decent* message but because its trying to be a meme any meaning it could've had is lost
I know nothing about this movie and I couldn't pick a better human to tell me all about it
Zero thumbs down as it should be
I was just watching your other video
This movie makes me wonder why god lets humans live
finally, d'angelo aka my only connection to what's happening in society is back
<3
Karen the movie is my favorite movie because it’s so unnecessary that it’s…
The king has returned!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
hot take: maybe don't trust someone who's first name is coke?? just an idea
The Candyman trailer was actually really good especially compared to this Karen shit
New drinking game, watch the movie and take a sip every time they say Karen
I can't believe this is gonna be an actual movie.....
Whenever D’Angelo posts it makes my day instantly. Something about someone extremely smart and attractive making a video.
600 views and 700 likes is amazing
what a wonderous birthday gift
We missed you KING 👑
Welcome back king
‘Karen’ and ‘movie’ should not be in the same sentence.
I’m having a really hard time with a lot of stuff today but D’angelo always manages to make days like this a bit better : )
why are they making a karen movie now
we've really ran out of movie ideas havent we
The return of the king. 👑 And his grey beanie.
Everybody want to be like Jordan Peele but don't even have the intellect to even make a movie like Get Out
likin the beanie
Idk man we've been needing some fresh new villain movies.   ...And new additions for bad movie night. Two birds one stone and all right
Glad ur back 😭
I've never been early to a d'angelo video it feels nice
The king has returned. Welcome back ♥️
I DEADASS THOUGHT THIS SHIT WAS A JOKE 💀💀
The legend has posted a video. Let's soak this into our souls. :) The Karen movie is prob a troll tho, ngl.
This is that weird genre of black cinematography where the sole purpose of the film is to be as stereotypical as humanly possible and put over the sheet of “ black relatability” and it works everytime because you cant really call a black person stereotypical towards their own race if its in the name of relatability. The gag is you can and Coke Daniels and Tyler Perry does it all the time  (More in reference to his movies like Who Made the Potatoe Salad)
D’Angelo if you were to make a movie what would it be about???????🎬🤪
PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT Q-FORCE IM GOING TO EXPLODE
THE ONE AND ONLY DANGELO IS BACK
I never clicked so fast
i sometimes question why the internet exists
0:54 dangelo is multiple people confirmed
Watch this movie predict how karens will act in 2057 and the king has returned. I’m so happy and hope that break was enjoyable 😉
Ayee d’Angelo
i cant believe ppl sat down and planned this whole movie and thought this was a good movie to film 😀
I thought this was a joke omg
Gosh I so love your confidence lmao! But I guess it makes sense when you look like a demi God 😅
Why 🥲
Memes dead, everyone needs to pack up and go home.
Everyone delete your comments so I can be first 😔
He’s baaack and all in the world is good again
I feel like they'll just take anything and make it into a movie now(the world is kinda going out sad )
we missed you king
I turned my hotspot on just to watch this on a road trip
Ayy I'm early.
Again I ask WHERE are the movies about black people where they get a light hearted fun story! People in color in general just get such annoying trauma films shoved down our throats all the time and its so frustrating! I want fantasy! Romance! Something exciting not racism that we already need to deal with every day
You know it’s gonna be a good day when D’Angelo posts
I've never been so excited for an upload
why do people love to capitalize of anything and everything, like this made the meme unfunny.
Your matching ukulele and instant camera are so cute and I love them
*dangelo has been alive since the beginning of the world confirmed*
Yayyy! Hi!! Hope you’re doing well king!!
It says that there are over 100 comments, but I can't see any of them  Hello? is anyone there?
Just why
Missed you buddy
hey besties, our king has feed us 😩
“Can I speak to the manager” instantly a yellow aura floats around her and she chokes out the cashier
I’m early??? ⟟ think idk :]
It's like Get Out gone wrong😂
10 views, 241 likes.... YouTube  are you alright?
I feel like they should’ve gone all the way with the Karen, the Karen hair do in this is like 4/10
This is a whole bruh moment
Me when I saw the video title: 🐿ʙᴏɪ🐿ᴡʜᴀᴛ🐿ᴛʜᴇ🐿ʜᴇʟʟ🐿 ʙᴏɪ🐿
10 views, 88 comments, and 483 likes   sounds legit
VERY HAPPY TO SEE YOU!! HOPE ALL IS WELL!! ❤️
We missed you king glad to be watching your videos again
missed you :)
I understand now that I missed you more then I thought I had
A MINUTE AGO ARE YOU SHITTING ME
Ooh boy I can tell that this is gonna be great
I would like to speak to this movie's manager
First Dislike
Early Squad 👋
GLAD UR BACK AYEEE
He's back
hi D’Angeli
I wonder who is the police in this movie.
humanity is devolving, but, our king d'angelo is back!
You’re great because you never have any wrong opinions
Yay he’s back!!! :)
I early for once 🤠👍🏻
its so funny seeing dogget from oitnb as a karen lmao edit: omg ok i didn't realize how awful that actor is so that's fun
I thought this was an SNL parody, but... here we are I guess :/
THE KING IS BACK
hey y’all how are you guys feeling?
“Karen Movie” Mom pick me up I’m scared
