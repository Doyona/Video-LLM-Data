That was probably the colts team’s therapist that asked Luck “are you more than a Quarterback?” .
QB contract= Deal with the devil
The colts ruined andrew. Its a crime honestly. And that's why they suck now and will continue to suck🎉🎉🎉😅
Didn’t we lose to Baltimore in the Wild Card in Lucks rookie season?
Yo I understand the wife or GF side of feeling neglected, but it's kinda selfish as hell to demand all of your partner when you know he's a NFL Professional and not just a player but theeee Franchise! Like chicks gotta chill
I know you just joking about the deflated footballs... Cause obviously losing by 40 points doesn't make up for a slightly deflated ball lol. I hate the Patriots tho but just a massive Tom the God Brady fan.
Did he have a trash line and take a lot of big shots possibly?
Pat bringing up deflated balls like that’s the reason they got run through by 38
Hes a sham alright  but old luck wasnt very that way indeed he got hurt like everybody else had hurt in the nfl it comes with the territory fool you gotta see that if youre intelligent
Its not that hard of a read. Just slow down and re read it if you dont understand. Its dense in the way that there are no filler words. Every sentence carries great meaning. He could have spelled it out in simple language. Instead he used language hes most comfortable with, for the audience he actually cares about. Choosing yourself is always the right decision. Choosing himself now gives him the ability to be available for his wife and child. Your best ability is availability.
FYI, Pat, Andrew Luck was drafted in 2012. The Colts went to the AFC Championship in 2014. So.. not his rookie year. You should know that considering you were teammates with him.
Colts could use luck now
Andrew’s 🐈 whipped, got it. Next!
AQ acting that way and not totally respecting Andrew’s decision is a bad look. The guy literally took a high road and could’ve been one of the greats and chose his family over that. A decision like that takes an overwhelming amount of maturity that AQ clearly lacks by the way he acted.
Nah Pat's right though- that paragraph was horrendously unnatural.
Y'all still haven't figured out how to white balance your cameras. Now it's just desaturated and orange.
At least Luck didn't  tap out after a 0 yard scramble because he was tired from running so much.
Andrew Luck made some money sure. He had the self respect and the respect of his wife, children and family to not put them through the physical and emotional trauma anymore. He is a man that looked down the mountain and realized he didn't need to be on top to be Happy   BRAVO MR LUCK
Seth Wickersham tells only lies.
Colts fans who attended his last game owe him an apology for booing him that day. Guy gave you everything he had. Glad he's doing well
I wanna watch, but damn you boys just love to hear yourselves talk holy. Slow it down with the mumble jumbo
Pat keeps saying they made the AFC championship his rookie year. He's getting his years mixed up. They got bounced by the Ravens in the wild card round his rookie year.
Shirts are 🔥
I like Andrew Luck's statement - imo, he is self aware enough to understand who's listening, why people want to know, that its a polarizing topic in the NFL, and Andrew doesn't want to add fuel to the debate, so as to not add pressure on current players or his former employers. He loves football but if you read between the lines, he loves people more.
Would luck be the QB for USA flag football team?
Was Luck going to be the next Brady? Or the next Joe Burrow? Joe had a great first season, made it to the superbowl, now he's getting destroyed season after season being the sack leader. Same with Luck, great first season, and punishing seasons that followed.
He doesn’t owe anyone an explanation 🤷🏼‍♂️
That's that mountainneer education for ya 😅😅😅
What a baby. “Identity issue” remember when we were men?
Na his wife continuing her career don’t sit well with me. Sounds his name shoulda been Andrew Cuck instead of luck
You guys lost to the ravens that year, in the first round of the playoffs.
Tua should seriously consider walking away.
It’s so funny though to think about what Brady has gone through. It’s crazy it’s like thanos. You are the best but lost everything to get there. Was it worth it?
Luck was a simp
Easy to walk away if you have generational wealth.
Regret and what-ifs are a gang of mental demons that chase us our whole lives, amongst other demons. Based on what Pat read, Luck is still filtering through it. It's not talked about much, but it's more normal than we think, no matter what level you get to in life. Not that that's great. Mental discipline is the path to peace, but it's not easy even tho it is easy.
We also have to realize some people don’t LOVE football. There’s so many athletes that only play because their parents make/made them.   You have to be a little crazy and ABSOLUTELY in love with football to play.
He said a lot but said nothing
Luck's rookie season he lost in the wildcard game to Baltimore....he didn't go to the AFCCG
There will always be a big if. Hopefully he doesn't regret his decision...
I work 16 hours a day 5 days a week other 2 days I work 8 hours I still have time for my family thats not part of the reason he retire calling bs
Terrible decision that was influenced heavily by his wife. Some men have a greater destiny - he threw his away for be just another dude. What a waste
"y'all" pick and choose the narrative, depending on if you like a person.  Where's all the dudes talking shyt about no rings, like you say about any other player?
Luck was just SOFT
So for all that we get nothing
Poor guy got the crap beaten out of him week after week.
Every hit in football is like a whiplash in a car accident no embellishment
Andrew luck made Stanford football relavent
A very late correction: Pat, the Colts *did not* go to the AFCCG in 2012. They lost in the wildcard round to the eventual SB champ Ravens. The only AFCCG appearance by a Luck-led Colts was 2014.
What a simp...😂
How ironic is Wickersham was the one to write the story. Sham.
Why aren't we more critical of GM's who can't protect their quarterbacks
He got the money, and the girl, and his family.   Epic win.
He should probably give Tua a call...
I think Pat keeps forgetting that Lucks rookie year they lost to the ravens in the wildcard round. They didn’t go to the AFC championship
the luck of simps
Why is this a 19 min video?
I went to Stanford!….I didn’t attend their school, but I did the drywall in one of their newer buildings 😂
Im just glad Andrew Luck was able to find part time work on Geico commercials as the caveman.
He could have always gotten another girlfriend. Ain’t no women taking control over me
Andrew Luck was a really good QB... He got his money and got out...
Looking back through the history of professional sports, there are a handful of individuals who were major stars that had long career, and after retiring, built remarkably successful business careers following.  An excellent example is Roger Stauback… such individuals have their heads screwed on straight from the git-go…
Stop all the capping. He was an underachiever for a # 1 pick. He was a talented solid QB but cmon stop acting like he was some amazing QB. Matt Ryan had a better career. Luck didn’t have the heart of a Lion like The GOAT 🐐 Tom Brady. He was the opposite of  a Lion Heart if we are talking strictly football. The cowardly Lion 🤷🏻‍♂️
It's fairly obvious why Andrew retired. He was beat tf up at the end of his career and you can't blame him for walking away. Colts fans really booed him too which is shameful. It's not like the man went to another team he retired for God's sake lol
Listening to these blockheads try to understand words
Imagine giving up your dreams to make your wife happy temporarily.
Tom Brady and Andrew luck need to have a podcast and a subsequent podcast every 5yrs until...
So he retired cuz his wife told him to.
Luck did what was best for him not YOU he has to live his life all day everyday any decisions made he walks with and I’m sure he’s living his best life
Blame Andrew Lucks O-line for him getting wacked every game .  Thats all good and all. But some players have longevity and health, look at Frank Gore, played 18 years in the league, was consistently getting 1000 yard seasons and left still healthy. At the Running Back position that has a low shelf life.
Damn that whistle caught me off guard 😂
He got to keep all his money. 😂I'd be content too
Didn’t the fans boo him that was sad
Sadly, Ricky made the same decision and was forced to come back or pay back the signing bonus.
Andrew Luck was different. Like Elway 2.0 different.
tua listen up
Good one guys. Very interesting. Good stuff.
Thay paragraph definitely makes NOT want to reac that article. Sound like a guy that has a dictionary in front of him and is trying to use as many of the words as possible
He was protecting his life. Football is a violent sport.  Nothing but respect.
As someone that put in 80-120 hrs for a decade during those same years…. Sounds more like Andrew Cuck
Pat has abolished sleevery.
I lived in Indy when Luck was drafted. He had a pretty iconic start....Year 1 Colts make it to the playoffs with a playoff loss...Year 2 they win a playoff game...etc. No they did not go to the championship game his rookie season. That was year 3 I believe.
Dude probably didn't want to have to attend a Diddy freak off
Make what Cam Newton even more impressive the guys take hits
If Luck were drafted to Detroit we would say they have to be cursed. Barry, Calvin and then Luck 😂
MY PATS RETIRED HIM NO WINS OVER US 😂 HE GOT NAILED ON THE PLAYS AND COULDN'T TAKE HITS THE GAME LITERALLY KNOCKED HIM OUT
He might have been a 300 million dollar contract 250M guaranteed lol
Andrew Luck never learned to be a pocket passer, instead of running or holding the ball too long, throw it away.  Colts fans had every right to boo, given he succeeded Peyton Manning.
I love how AQ pushed back on the excuse of Andrew not being present enough during a heroic football career
We already know it was because of injuries. Andrew doesn’t need to explain anything. Let that man live in peace.
Sounds like He married a feminist. Simpin ain’t easy
“We went to the AFC Championship Game to play a team with deflated footballs.”  What was the final score of that game, Pat?
This is the most intellectual 20 minutes of the Pat Mc show in history.
Honestly so tired of hearing folks who know nothing about physics or the facts in the deflategate talk about deflated footballs....  You lose 70% more heat when wet. So the balls will deflate a lot more....and the Colts ball deflated more.....
He doesn’t have to explain anything i stand by any players decision to put family and health first
Quitting being one of the biggest stars in any sport must feel like quitting the hardest drugs. It's why dudes stay around too long. The high of winning a football, basketball, MMA bout, Baseball, etc in front of a sold out crowd must be insane.
I find it deeply weird that anyone could be confused as to why someone would walk away from it all. To know that there was a bigger bag? That should be what matters? It's okay to be conflicted. To know you had a potential for further success and to take the game you love further. After the money he had made, does the money matter? I just don't understand that logic. It's like a fuckin disease of the mind. How empty and sad does your life have to be for that to be the primary motivator?
That’s why I never went to the NFL in the first place, or ever play football at all.  I didn’t wanna be too too great.
To sum it up; Andrew Luck is a gifted (mentally/physically) Beta Male!
People are going to find out who Andrew lucks therapist was and cancel that dude
Always whines about the deflate gate nonsense.
Its a tradeoff that our society has made in general. We are seeking higher quality of life over higher levels of achievement. You cannot have both - as to discover the limits of one's potential requires sacrifice. There are pros and cons to this approach, individuals have better lives, but society overall cannot know how high they could have flown, or what strategies they would have invented.
That wasn’t advance reading…that’s like a 9th grader trying to sound smart coming off as being way behind.
"He use big werds. he must be super intellect. Well, he smarter than me. Dats saying alot.'
Bruh… so in the end she hit him with an ultimatum so that she could chase her career?….👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
It sounded to me, basically like, he was describing the lies we tell ourselves to justify that which we desire intently, but don’t authentically need.
4:35 Why do these journo's constantly try writing Dickens novels about sports guys?! 🤦‍♂️
“Good reading” killed me
I don’t blame Luck for retiring. I don’t blame the fans for booing him on his way out either because he just abruptly left when he was supposed to be the franchise QB but with as much as he got injured…nah it wasn’t worth it
Becareful apple might sue you. That little whistling sounded way to perfect
It sounds like he'll never know whether retiring when he did was the right decision or not, but regardless, he is at peace with the decision he made.
I love pat and Andrew but deflated footballs is bs look up natural gas law
It’s different If he was winning , I believe he would be playing a different tune If he was on a different team
Deflategate was actually to put the Colts in the Superbowl. The NFL wanted to showcase the two young QB's on the biggest stage. The validation of this is that the game was close when the balls were deflated. When properly inflated during the 2nd half, the Patriots dropped 28 pts!
What’s Molly like?
He was a problem at Arrowhead
The journalist who wrote that doesnt wven like sports
"Deflated footballs"...  As that team runs over you for 177 yards on the ground.  Dont make BS excuses, you lost a game to the best "under pressure / playoff" QB to have ever played.
So he had to quit work so she can continue her job
He got sacked that resulted in a lacerated spleen .... for a lot of ppl that results in a lose of life, he got NFL patched up and was wanted to go and play again .... he opted to not risk his life anymore!
“Edges recede like an iceberg” come on stop the self-indulging garbage writing
Personally I think Andrew made the rational human choice. He got to leave with everyone knowing he was elite, but constantly unhelped, and has his mind, body, life and heart still intact. Which should just go to show you how crazy in comparison all these GOATs like Tom and Aaron are to drive themselves to push beyond the human limit, and play as long as they can.
Sounds like Andrew Luck married a woman who cared more about herself than him. She knew when she got with him what it entails.
Pat talks to fast😂
We’ve been knowing why he retired injuries hello😂😂
his wife still cheated on him
I thought he was going to say he went to a diddy party so he retired
He definitely got caught cheating
Hear that Tua
I have no issue with players retiring early.  My only issue with Luck was the timing.   He shouldn't have waited until the season was upon the team.
Overly poetic ass article. He retired cuz his head hurt. The end
Loved luck and was stoked, happy he is happy but he screwed me hard in fantasy when he retired tho😂❤
Overrated!
That article was… wordy
This could have been cleared up by hanging out with Rodgers and taking psychedelics...
He and Tua need to talk
I support any player who retires early to preserve their health.
The trade of for a good family  dynamic is the big money contracts can’t have both because both require more then the other especially being the face of a franchise
Hilarious how much they're criticizing the writing style in that paragraph. The whole time McAfee was reading it I wasn't sure what it meant. Glad I'm not alone
funny how your asses got kicked harder when the footballs were apparently corrected and properly inflated in the 2nd half of that game...
Pats voice has changed dramatically since that vocal cord injury
Andréw Luck was the best QB we’ve ever had.
If your wife doesn’t understand your profession and is selfish enough to tell you to stop your childhood dreams is a woman you should never want to consider marrying lmaooo feel bad for this man
None of us can judge what other people do because we're not there but I do wonder about supporting your spouse and what that person does and it seems like his wife didn't care for it at all which is something you got to work out before you get married. And if Luck is going to a therapist to try to figure out the decision clearly he was extremely conflicted and obviously his wife wasn't giving him supports play football.
Isn’t making 20 million and having a great family life a way better thing than losing everyone you love and making 220 million?
13-9
I wouldn’t of left
I will watch this later. I am at work. I don't know if he goes into it, but he loves to read. He wanted to keep his brain so that he can enjoy learning from the written word. Just another reason why. Shame on the Colts for not supporting our guy...
I'm fine with what he did, just not when he did it. You don't retire at halftime after you come out in pads in pregame just to sell more merchandise.  So in my eyes he'll always be a loser
I thought lucks rookie post season the colts lost the wildcard game at the ravens..
With the contracts these days. imagine what he would get if he did come out of retirement.
Casually mentioning that deflate gate was a reason the Colts lost that AFC championship game... Yall couldnt score a TD.. what was wrong with yalls balls
his wife is selfish point blank
Brings up " playing a team with deflated footballs". What a cry baby. They kicked your ass with any football. Not to mention. Learn the laws of physics pal.
Still remember all the brutal hits this man took on the chin and just powered thru. A true gamer. Glad he prioritized his health and family ❤️🙏
Tone nailed it at the end
They wouldn’t get him a good line to protect him so I don’t blame him, if they don’t wanna  pay to protect the qb they don’t wanna win either…
Colts would not trade Manning had they known they’d get only 6 seasons from Luck. Imagine all the draft picks they could have gotten to surround Manning? Browns offered their entire draft class at the time for Luck. Andrew was good —but not great.
The amount of air pressure in the footballs was the reason you lost by 40, Pat?
Die hard New England Patriots fan here Pat was talking about the deflated footballs. They should be thankful. The ball was deflated because they scored over 40 points on them with. Equipment that was not up to par if equipment would’ve been up to par they might’ve scored 100 on them
Pat got his years mixed up, paganos diagnosis and treatment happened in 2012 and they lost in the first round. They didn’t make the afc championship til 2014.
I listen to this show all the time because these guys make me laugh. When they do get thoughtful and a little philisophical, they are actually quite good at it. I liked this video a lot. Humility goes a long way and Pat really does nail it. Smart people on that team.
Ha - they started getting into dangerous territory in the end. I think we saw in real time how Pat realised this woman has some clout in the entertainment industry and SHUT it DOWN before anyone could start outright blaming her. For the good of everyone's future career... especially as A.Q could have said something he couldn't take back.
Glory was not his god?!  Wow that is one in a 10 million.
Lets not forgot he's ameliorated the CTE degradation, by stopping when he did, so he can enjoy raising his family with that bag for longer, before it fully kicks in.
Look at the expression on Luck’s face in various pictures.  You can see the anguish he was often experiencing.
I read the article, and the guy here did a terrible job explaining what the article said.
Andrew luck is the most talented QB in nfl history
On another note: I hope ESPN and Disney fornicates itself into bankruptcy.
20 years from now when Andrew is physically capable of getting out of bed in the morning, isn’t being tormented by CTE induced urges to commit mass murder on a daily basis and has countless memories of his children growing up that he will forever cherish, he will know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he absolutely made the correct decision.
Loses all credibility when you talk deflated balls. Loser.
Couldn't stand the heat and left the kitchen. It is what it is, but he isn't a hero. In the end, who cares
It'd be hard to be an office worker after being an elite qb
Luck was a goid dude.  Lol he couldnt live up to to the nimber 1 hype  . He wasnt a bumm but he wasnt anywere near exspected.
I don’t mean to talk bad on luck, but from where, from a seen a lot of drug addiction, and he shows signs of heavy drug use
The current 17 game schedule (plus playoffs) with a 53 man roster is really taking a physical toll on players. I can't think of any other sport that winds up being so unhealthy for its participants.
Why is the bar so low for reading?
He knew his family was gonna treat him better than football in 20 years
When you are in athletics, they let anybody in Stanford and anywhere else. They literally make admissions exceptions for athletics.
Allow me to interpret..." I want to be able to walk and not have brain damage when football is done. Period."  Of course there's more to it but that's the jist of it.
Luck gave everything for the Colts and the Colts just gave him the finger and never tried to protect him with even a decent O line.
Making a sob story about how bad of a job being an nfl qb is is such a stanford elitist type move that it's all starting to make sense now.  Why even take the job in the first place then andrew if it's such a labor.  Oh yeah the hundreds of millions he got in his contract.  What a joke
All the guys applauding him for leaving aren't colts fan I can guarantee you that.  Every other qb in the league could figure it out except for him.  Kirk cousins could figure it out ........... kirk cousins
Sorry, I've seen a lot of people like this. Conflict averse.  In life, even if you are a 'nice guy', you have to learn to put your foot down at times. Don't let other people dictate everything.  And marriage is ultimate example of that. Obviously a lot of compromise, a lot of give/take etc etc.  In this case, hopefully his wife didn't just bully him into retirement.
Side note: this video is a perfect example of why TPMS is a must-see/listen to progrum. (Relatable.) 🤣
Pat is crashing from a caffeine high here 😂 his lips and voice box can barely keep up with the words his brain is delivering to them 🤣
Like the judge said you weren't going to beat us anyway and like all the other quarterbacks say they all deflate the ball
Good stuff, but just stop cursing!  It’s pointless.  Clean it up for the kids watching.
When a writer uses word salads it’s not because they are smart they just want you to think they are smart. The average person reads at the 8th grade level and if you are writing articles for the sports pages you should stick to that. Also quit whining about the deflated footballs. You lost in the second half after they were pumped up. Also don’t both teams play with them?
He stated that his wife was concerned about habits he had developed during his career.  It's possible to infer that she was upset with the amount of medication that was necessary for him to just be able to function.
HEY JACKAS#.  They were only deflated in the first half. SO WHATS YOUR EXCUSE for the SECOND HALF???!!
Sham is one of those writers that uses word salad to make himself feel smarter than the rest of us. He could of said what he said in a lot less words !
He doesn't have the it factor like Mike Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant or anything
Didn't know McAfee was a cry baby
It wasn't his life. It was his job.  He had money and other things he could do.
From what I remember, Andrew Luck was an amazing and tough leader.
Still crying of deflated footballs, yet Patriots ran the ball down your Throat, Crybaby!!!
That was excellent writing.😊
even though Pat sounds dumb that was some Insight from Pat on Luck being too nice
where did Pat Mcafee go to college?
Anyone remember when the debate once was . Luck or Wilson. It was never luck. It was all suc
That WV schooling shining through! 😂😂😂
I bet Jerry Jones can bring Andrew Luck out of retirement…
Never saw the hype for Luck. Dude never won anything. Didn’t do anything spectacular. He’s overrated as hell.
🎶 (They call me) young master Mr. CUMB blaster Can’t stand my baby momma  So my son will be a bastard 🎶 (bars)
Health and Family are always #1.  The job is always #2 after H & F.  Respect.
Lmao depflate balls ur funny  thats was the reason gary blunt run for over 200 years against the colds ur funny
This is still incredibly sad that the colts failed this man
It's obvious why he left he was constantly hurt
which one of us, if able to make multiple millions at a young age + a credible understanding of the biz world + relatively good heath + a growing family... wouldn't lean towards retiring early?  C'mon, this isn't really a mystery.. kudos to this young man.. life is too important (to live for everyone else's priorities)
Poor Andrew Luck will end up divorced one day.
Pat: "Andrew is an appeaser," Shipley::"wifey you get150 million for 4.5 months suck it up." Wifey is high up at NBC. Pat: " Oh good choice Andrew clap clap clap every one." Hahahaha,  High up NBC exec changed the tune for Pat.
When will the pompous NFL owners realize that paying these outrageous fawking salaries for no performance is only hurting the game as a whole, we need a pay for play scheme, so when these guys come out of college and they got all the energy in the world they get paid for producing, not produce one year, get a massive contract, and then suck for five or six.
Andrew is one of those guys that you just know is a good dude.
Lol these guys are the real
Respect to Andrew luck I watch him. Play Usc in a couple games. And yeah I respect to him and is family
Thank you for roasting the writer, it’s so clear that this dude doesn’t even watch sports, and wants to prove to all those idiot sports fans that he is a “really great writer”
Jesus Christ Lord God save us and the whole world.   Jesus Christ Lord God save us and the whole world.   Jesus Christ Lord God save us and the whole world.
A man chooses his family over football. I respect that cause I know it wasn't easy
Lmao dudes still crying about “deflategate”, it was Brady ignoramus he would’ve beat you clowns with a ping pong ball 😂😂
I know this is a year old but am I buggin? His rookie season they lost 24-9 to Baltimore. His second year was the AFC championship run
Deflated footballs. You guys got crushed. But we’ll go with that
Snowboarding?
My favorite player. The man got hit by a car every week.
Tom Brady loved football more than his family.  Andrew luck loved his family more than football.   Which choice do you think was better? Being famous? revered? Or being there for the people you love?
After watching this I looked up the Luck article by Seth Wickersham. It was really well done. This episode was horrible. Makes them look dumb and unprepared . I’ve never gotten this impression and have really enjoyed their content. You guys all should have read the article and taken notes to have a epic discussion on it
Maybe it's that 90 IQ kicking in!!
Bunch of people talking about people
Lame af lol
I’m a year late on this but Bruce Arians never led us  to the Championship game. Lucks rookie season is when Arians took over and we lost to the eventual SB champ Ravens in the Wildcard round
Deflated footballs?!? Colts can’t stop crying about that
It’s probably more complicated than what I understand but it sounds like she runs the show and he is so nice he capitulated.
"You have to be more of an ahole to be a qb..." hear that mahomes?! Get on them WRs not the refs 💯
He knew what his future looked like if he stayed. Broken and most likely hooked on opioids like so many else. He wasn’t happy.
Oliver Luck was a Rhodes Scholar Candidate.
The Colts had a terrible offensive line,while Luck was there.That contributed to his injuries.
shouldve ditched the wife
Andrew Luck would never slide. He thought he was Earl Campbell not a quarterback.....not very clever!
Wait! Deflated footballs? They played with the correct footballs second half and beat you guys by even more Pat.....
He retired for family and was tired of being hurt.
Your footballs were deflated too Pat, DOE!!
Deflated footballs lol you lost 45-7 the game wasn’t even close, that’s not deflated footballs that’s a talent difference
You got your years mixed up Pat Buddy.  Indy didn't make it to the AFC championship game in Andrew's rookie year
Luck is a quitter. Period.
Macafee changing subjects before the real men on the show discussed how a selfish woman derailed her husband's career with an ultimatum so she could further her career.
Maybe be a Dad and a super husband at 40??? I always thought Jeter had it figured out. Don't commit to anything else until you're out. It's that type of a job.
Luck for President?
Dude who said “there’s always time to be a husband and father later,” that’s not how life works. Your time is always now and your time with your kids means more when they are young a year means a lot more to a three year old than a thirty year old. You only get so much time to have your kids be your kids.
Come on Pat deflated footballs They would've beat the piss out of the Colts with volleyballs.
It always cracks me up when people complain about New England deflating footballs. If over inflating footballs caused your defense to forget how to tackle, your coaches to forget how to coach and is ultimately why you lost a football game you have way bigger problems Bru lol just saying 😂
aq was not hearing any of that
Whatever Luck was a rich kid so he had the luxury of being able to walk away from the game...gimme a break if he loved it his dad said you can do whatever you want to do
SO his wufe made him do it
Luck went out with alot more class then A.B. lol
Andrew Luck is forever legend.
Rory McIlroy got married and his game hasn't been the same since
One time a player won out. He had enough talent to get the massive signing bonus. As a normal person it’s more than enough money to last a lifetime if invested right & you live modestly. It was smart. You’re young, rich & healthy. Not old, hurting & wealthy, just more highly regarded by a bunch of people you don’t know.
Luck knew the nfl is rigged, the colts are set as a second rate team . Thats why they lead the league in drops , some a high schooler could catch or even a pop warner player . Its obvious watching them miss tackles and trip over their own feet
Of all former players and should be a hall of famer is Donnie Edwards. Go look at his numbers compared to Ray Lewis. And Donnie Edwards didnt have the supporting cast that Lewis had. And by far was one of the best MLbs in coverage. Go look at old film on him. Please interview him
Hi I'm here from the future, and just wanted to say Luck did NOT take the colts to the AFC championship game his rookie year, they got eliminated by Baltimore in the first round that year
They gave luck a horrible offensive line his whole career.   His body couldn’t take punishment
So his wife got to do her thing and he can't. Sounds like his wife ruined his life
Reminds me of Rage Against the Machine lyrics. 🤘😎🏈
Pat talks talk about the deflated football like it would have mattered in a game they lost 45-10
I'm sure it got hard to fix games properly being so physically gifted Bet it don't even look right .What mafia tell him one more slip up and your gonna mysteriously walk out on a highway and get smashed.
Luck never lived up to the hype 0 all pros 0 mvps 0 rings
Lucks rookie year was a playoff L to the ravens in the WC round
Andrew luck was an amazing QB, but the way he would play was dangerous. And a defender loves a free shot at a QB especially back in those days b4 the blanketing of hard hits. And he would get injured so often, there was some doubt if he could stay healthy enough to make it to the next level in nfl accomplishment. And then he was out and even more doubt if he could ever come back and be as good as he was at the beginning of his career. And in his last year he put the entire nfl on notice and proved to everyone else and himself that he is that guy and he’s still got it. And then he hung it up, amazing.
2015 was the afc championship game, and deflated footballs had nothing to do with that loss. Patriots ran the ball down there throat.
How did pat play with Andrew luck and not get timeliness or season correct. Lol Andrew luck lost to Baltimore in Ray Lewis last season his rookie year, that wasn't the Bruce Arians interim coach year.
Once your kids are past 5 years old you missed alot so the comment of you have time? He plays 10 more years the kids are like 15ish you missed everything
Personally, I never needed a reason why he retired. When you hear about how he had some injuries doctors have only ever seen from car crashes, you can't judge him if he wants to step away. I don't know about you but I don't want to see anymore Dave Duersons or Junior Seaus. Complain all you want about modern player's toughness, but it does nobody any good when stars are shooting themselves in the chest so doctors can study how fucked up their brain is.
Women will always try to ruin whats in your best interest 😂 who turns down 100s of millions to make their wife happy
As a Texans fan I’m still happy this guy doesn’t play anymore
Andrew Luck is a very smart man I have ton’s of respect for him he chose family and got the Bag too 🙏🙏💯
Pat, ask the hard question....  Who's to gain?  Is it isolated, is it league wide?   Did Jerry rice have a position on this? You're going to need to dive a lot deeper. If you want to be relevant to the truth of this whole situation, gambling and all on a large-scale, millions and billions per season.....  Is true felony punishment. Racketeering. Deaths. Death Threats, inferred, or implied.   One must realize, all leadership is under judgement right now. Political, religious, sport, banking.  Sport is a large part of millions of lives, but it is a small part of a much much larger matter...... Human Trafficking. Super Bowl being a place each year it goes on.  The Kraft family got a pass, he hot his noodle wet with some young ones, why did he get a slap on the wrist, when the owner if The L.A.  Clippers was forced to sell?  Ask the hard questions.....  Racism is worse than sex with a 16 year old girl when your 70 something and you own NFL team?  Let's go open and honest here Pat.  John, Indiana. Want to gave a private site down Pat, I'm in Hamilton Co. just up the road from your studio? Let's have a sit down..... off the record....  There's much you have no idea about Pat.......  Have your people reach out to my people.... seriously.  I could knock on your studio door, but why?   Its in your court, waiting.  How deep would you like to go..........
The AFC championship game wasn't his rookie year it was his 3rd year, it was Russell Wilson's 3rd year too and the year the Seahawks played the Patriots in the Superbowl, the 49ers played the Ravens in the Superbowl his Rookie year
Shipley and pat come off as douche bags to me in this. Luck choose family over what in the end is just a stupid game. Good for him
Anytime a professional athlete can go out on their own terms it should be applauded, me I was severely injured in college and never even got to make the decision, so yes anytime you retire when "YOU" want to is a blessing.
Indy almost had a Green Bay like quarterback run
Overthinker
I read that he was NOT IN LOVE with the game that he was excellent at.  He wasn't sure he wanted to continue to keep pushing forward with the body breaking down and he wasn't sure if he wanted to keep trying to rehab and come back and only focus on football. Said well he chose personal health and happiness and life over being an NFL QB
He made some good points.  1. I was very gifted in Baseball and intelligent but I made the conscious decision thar I wanted to be a family man and have good relationships more than I cared about achievement.   2. It took my dad 3.5 years to finally retire after retirement time came. Even after retiring he still works part time. It's his identity. He doesn't know how to change.  It's also hard for the less fortunate and the less gifted to understand why someone may not use those gifts. The fact that he had so much money on the table before him has the guys questioning the decision but the point seems to be that financially they were fine and it was more about the fact that there is so much more to life than football.
Life. Family. Happiness. Is bigger then football
He should come back now since he can’t really be touched!
Being injured all the time and constantly rehabbing is hard enough. Mix in the pain that goes with it and all the while keeping a brave face for your team and your family. That has to be totally exhausting. Dude left it all out there every snap in every game. Much respect.🙏👍💪
Barry Sanders, Calvin Johnson and Andrew luck all retired early because they were drafted by crap Detroit Lions teams !
It's not clearly written. Is that by design? I don't know.
Please dont bring up deflated footballs . Andrew luck - they wouldve beaten us with a nurf ball . 17-7 before half with deflated ball . 41-7 after reg ball
I used to like and watch McAfee. Not anymore after that stupid comment. Deflategate never happened and was never proven. The only reason the Commissioner was allowed to suspend Brady was because of the new rules signed by the Players Association. Brady came back and dominated that year so i'm happy for all these lies.
I mean sure. I’ll say it.  He didn’t love football. And that’s ok. The team game and being there for your teammates wasn’t really his thing.  The all time greats are kinda psychopaths.  He didn’t have that in him.
His wife, "stop getting hurt." lol, does she wonder where the money is coming from... he should have finished out the year and see what happens...  Once in a lifetime
Still crying about so called deflated footballs lol.  Colts = cry baby losers
So we lost what could have been one of the greatest QBs of all time- to a woman.  Well I feel eh.
His wife sounds truly awful…
I remember when Luck tossed a TD to Andy Dwyer
This crew explains this well
Deflated footballs 😂😂😂😂😂 lol how’d that second half work out
The Colts would have went to that Super Bowl, if the Patriots didn't end up cheating like they usually did when it comes to winning championships. Tom Brady may be the greatest quarterback of all time, but his championships have an Asterisk next to them.
DON'T put it on his wife! He was conflicted for many reasons. He made the right choice for HIM, for his health both physical and mental. The reason that paragraph is challenging to read is because he was and maybe still is conflicted. It takes time to figure out complex issues. I appreciate that he didn't try to simplify his narrative. Respect.
Pat, come on. Deflategate is more about how the three stooges measured the pressure and ducked it all up than anything else, or do forget all the points scored in the 2nd half with hardballs. You should just say we got crushed rather than whine.
Bro. 45-7. The pats would’ve won with volleyball lol.
Loved watching Luck play at Stanford! Now, he’s back at the Farm in graduate school and coaching at Palo Alto High💕
This c*** is like the view.
The Colts selfishly did not protect him on the field.  He's only flesh and bone.
Just want to thank Andrew for the time he shared with us. Good Luck!
And the of the day it’s just a game
The quote in question was poorly written. Period. That wasn't Luck's fault. It was the author's.
Andrew Luck a H()3 go away
9 seasons is alot (yeh QBs typically play longer) but he played before all the rules were changed. ++ for reasons unknown he never had a "good" Oline.  Let it go. Andrew Luck had a great career overall.  GM / ownership let him down
It sounds like he was saying that as long as Irsay absolutely hates buying offensive lineman, then I have the right to re-evaluate my future in football! I don't see where CTE will help my family in the least bit, and as you know, I have invested wisely. Thank you for the opportunity,  but the next time I pick up a football, it will be to play catch with my grandson. Nice job, Mrs. Luck,...family comes first!
I suspect his arm never felt the same after he injured it. It never quite had the same zip on it that last season and a lot of his passing was short passes. I remember that last year the colts played the eagles and it was mostly short passes and at the end of the game the colts had a hail mary play where he sat out and jacoby brissett came in to throw the hail mary pass. After the game the colts played it off like "oh jacoby has the stronger arm" but it seems in the totality of luck's career that his arm just wasnt alright. Hopefully he's happy and feeling better nowadays because he took a beating in the NFL. He was a heck of a QB though.
Ya Andrew luck was so happy about his decision he went to therapy instead of a yacht 😂 some one save my guy from himself 😫
Nobody gonna talk about how that “article” paragraph was only like 2 sentences? Check the punctuation
Over a mil views...PMS is in the area
After seeing what happened to Tua, Luck isn't looking so crazy now.
He's a freaking cheater. Don't care for that QB why didn't you show the one where he threw the tablets. Deflating 🏈🤔
Oh yeah scum bag Brady not talken bout slim Shady I'm takin bout Tom freaking cheatin Brady
The wife seems a bit shady according to what the boys are saying they read
Luck hiding out in the Alps as a ski bum, because he's afraid Irsay is gonna ask for some of that money back that Luck didn't earn?
Hey Pat, you all had deflated footballs, too. Just saying. 🤷‍♂️
Your team had the majority of "deflated" footballs and your lineman said they would have ran on you with bars of soap. WHAAAATT!
We believe Luck really said this? Sounds like a modern day Marcus Aurelius 🤔
Sounds like a controlling wife.
I could have went to the same High School as Luck and I could have played for his high school football team. Shame I had to move to Katy
My God our education system will destroy us all…
Jake Locker did same thing. He never been happier.
You must get him for an interview
“AFC Championship participant” banner is a joke
It’s not nearly that complicated or complex.  As a man, you have zero choice but to create value for yourself.  You are born with none, we all are.  Women are not.  They have inherent value.  He suffered through so many injuries that he was unable to attain a sustained period of being truly among the best in the league.  He spent too much time on sidelines just trying to be able to play.  However, he attained a status of value that included respect amongst peers, High financial earnings that set him up for life, and a chance to have a legacy.  He also made the mistake of choosing some “high status” woman, one who doesn’t value the struggles it takes to be successful as a man.  Better off marrying High School sweetheart.  Her pressure to step away for what she wanted—her goals—which is exactly what happened to Brady (and ignores it was that same dedication to being great as a man that attracted her in the first place) is what put him in a bad position personally.  On balance , he decided to take his earnings, his health, and his family over an opportunity to become a legend of the NFL, induction into Hall of Fame and probably evaluated Colts front office ability to surround him with Super Bowl caliber team.  If it were me, provided he was truly healthy, would have kept playing and told her to pound salt.     Don’t care about her MBA, what does that add to his life anyway?  Luck would have had no lack of women interested in him to replace her, one more supportive of his goals.    Say what you want about a Ben Roethlisberger, but he got that.  Drew Brees too.  Peyton Manning as well.  He left a chance to accomplish something .0000001% of men could ever do.  If that woman pressured him into not because she has a gymnastics move named after her, bye.  Never go for “high status women”,  consider if Brad Pitt and Tom Brady aren’t good enough, what will be?  You and I sure aren’t.
Still shouldn't quit less than two weeks before in my opinion... but then again, I dont have family! I never disrespected my work or job/ business and that's my take on it. If it was up to me(As a boss), he wouldn't be mentioned in the hall of fame, his jersey wouldn't be retired, and all the honors of sports would not necessarily be granted.  As a family man I get that, but I wouldnt stay on the fence until the season starts. He deserved all the Booing.
Hey evwybody., wead my ahticle ans see how smawt I am.  And member dis, I'm not just smawt , I'm so smawt.
The last name Wyckersham/Wickersham is a name that came from their bloodlines origin. A lost medieval site or village originating from some Norse Vikings. It sounds like his long dead ancestors were rather proud of their Viking ancestry or at least they just couldn’t think of another way to describe themselves. Since most older surnames were descriptions of their work/trade or place of origin, it’s possible they were just wealthy and didn’t have a trade so they just chose the origin of their bloodline for a surname to start. That’s just a wild guess. I just always think things like that are very intriguing. The sham part in their name has nothing to do with deceitful claims or baseless statements. There are tons of old villages in Europe with ham or sham at the end of their name. It was not a description of their level of honesty in everyday activities though.
Seems like people forget about a guy named Joe who won 4 SB's.
The injuries are bad for the player and the family.  To think the family has to watch a player be creamed on the field.  I could never do that.
My new favorite line from the show: "Ty read it,  because Ty has a very big brain. Connor attempted to read it." —Pat McAfee
Luck was an amazing QB, he had that it factor you look for in an NFL QB. I remember his rookie season the Colts roster was stripped down to nothing compared to the Manning era. He got that team to 11-5 where on paper shouldn’t of won more than 3 games. Haha. The teams he played on, and how he rallied everyone around him while continuously getting his body beat to pulp week in and week out. I blame Grigson and the negligence on his behalf of refusing to surround him with a half decent O-Line. If they would of invested in a line for Luck early in his career, he would still be our QB. I don’t blame him for choosing his health and his family over football. Luck is one of the greatest what ifs in NFL history. I am a diehard Colts fan, and I cherish the years we had him on our team.
Funny thing about that game with “deflated” footballs. The balls were re-inflated/overinflated in the second half when the Patriots put up all their points. You are allowed to read the Wells report.
I remember the interview it was very sad to hear him say football wasn't fun anymore due to the serous injuries he went through
Smart guy and did not need football.  Old nfl guys did not make big money so had to keep playing
Health and happiness over a sport.
Any Colts fan that got to see Peyton and Luck is fortunate as a fan. 👏
It’s about a simple internal conflict that everyone goes through. Andrew Luck made a decision. No decision is wrong or right, but all decisions in life will disappoint someone.
...great show.  but, frankly... dammit... made me freagin "sad as hell" for Luck.  If he's speakin' about it now?  It's gotta be a bit of a haunt.  you don't bare(literally) your feelings like that if you're comfortable and satisfied FULLY with your choices in retrospect.  You just live.  And if you do?  It's short and clear.  I'm diggin' what I'm doin'. Simple as that.  That guy was AMAZING.  Too nice a guy is no comfort when you have to deal with realizing your being "too nice a guy" cost you that RARE chance to be GREAT.  Luck WAS that guy.  Somewhere inside, he's gotta be dealin' with that.  And going public like that?  Speaks for itself.  This is gonna sound cruel.  But exceptional talents need partners that "fit".  "Too" nice of guys DO finish...if not last...at least somewhat conflicted?  All the stuff about being a ski-mountie? Smoke.  Andrew Luck wasn't just a player.  He was football platinum. That kind of God-given talent?  You max out, go out on your shield...or be somewhat haunted about "giving it up".
Reverse it and Andrew would be stoned by the media for offering his wife an ultimatum to quit her job or divorce.  They would call it some sort of, "abuse"
whose that guy breaking all of Lucks records? oh yeah, JUSTIN HERBERT
As a huge football fan, I’m so sorry. I kind of wish Andrew would have made it to the Super Bowl the year of the deflated footballs. And been able to retire after winning a bowl. Because he could have probably won a Super Bowl at some point.
I’m either an idiot or I just thought that excerpt was beautifully written and made so much sense to me.
Oh don’t make that backhanded comment about “losing to a team with deflated football”. I’m no patriot’s fan but you guys got HANDLED….Blount rushed all over you guys and your offense scored 7 points.
Ok. Who believes pat is paty of a book club? Lol
Luck is a moron.
Interpretation: I have enough money to last for 10 lifetime's, and I'm tired of being hit by 275lb defensive ends.
Luck from day one was that guy, franchise changing. Respect his decision it's hard as hell to step away from chasing your dream.
Luck's story is definitely interesting, I'm not denying any of that (and he was a great player). The one story I couldn't help but compare some of this too was Sam Bradford. At some point Pat made a comment about Luck's skill despite all the issues ( I think he said, don't quote me...) but all I could think is.... "Sam Bradford is the single QB in history that I thought would dominate the NFL if he never had an injury ever in his life!"  Honestly, if I ever played ball in any sport I would be like Luck. I congratulate people for blocking me in pick up basketball for crying out loud. Yet, watching all other NFL QBs vs Bradford? Holy heck the record books are lucky he was injured a lot... (and Luck is right behind that... move over Peyton!)
I feel like what was trying to be said was that if he had committed his life to the craft and all that came with it while not making the choice to spend that blood sweat and tears on his personal life he still won't know if it was the better choice. Because, he can only choose one path. He did the math and took his bet. If he became a "GOAT" would it even be worth it and the uncertainty of the retirement still sticks with him.
If his wife is Stanford MBA, she most likely became the family business manager. Full time job!
The end clap made me a subscriber.
He's too smart to sacrifice his brain for football
The beating these NFL athletes take each game is unreal. I can't imagine what happens to the body after years of abuse through the game they love. Retiring "young" is not a bad choice for someone who took way too many hard hits through the years!! Andrew Luck, Barry Sanders and others were very smart for hanging the cleats up!!
🤡🤡🤡
Sounds like to me that the therapist or psychologist ruined one of the greatest football players of all time and told him to go home 😅😂
Deflated but 2nd half where the game started close Blount went off so the deflated balls kept it close
You should seriously try and get Luck on the show bro
Pat, we lost to the Ravens in 2012 WC
At the time, Andrew luck was billed by the media as the greatest quarterback in NFL history. Yeah it was Andrew luck this, and Andrew luck that. So I decided to watch him a few games and I mean every play.   The bottom line with Andrew luck was this. He could not read the defense quickly enough. So basically he was slow and did not have great foot movement. He reminded me of a Dwight Howard. Yeah, it was frustrating watching Andrew luck play because it just seemed like it took forever for the offense to develop the plays. Even the commentators were saying for him to speed the game up.
Honestly that's a b**** move you have all those fans and And you don't even let them know why you retired f*** him I'm from Indiana with a die hard  But f******  him after Peyton left it was never the same
Most Americans are gone from they family just f trying to survive ,no sympathy for Makin mill.u work for that though but don't cry
If Andrew stayed healthy and still was playing at his top level he'd already have Superbowl rings and be cementing his place in Canton. I mean he'd probably be the best quarterback in the league right now
They let Peyton manning walk... driving from cold to hot tires gain pounds of air....
Team with deflated footballs my ass, that team beat you in the run game you numbskull
You have a duty to do the best you can, you owe it to yourself and to show example to your kids
He made the right decision in the long run.
idk wats worst ... the goddamn tank tops or that fn haircut... js
It’s kinda the perfect story in a sense. Dude had all the potential to be the best ever. Left it all on the table to pursue his family & a quiet, humble life.
He went Vegan. End of story.
Luck was overrated
That's some of the most pretentious writing I've ever seen
Headless Aaron Rodgers bobble head 😆
Putting his body through the ringer every week for his team not to go anywhere.
He was not a rookie in 2014..........
Wife gave him an ultimatum? What a good wife. How supportive.
Never met Andrew luck, but man do I respect him.
Phat Macafee  Ruin this entire segment by pretending to the entire world that they lost in the AFC championship because of the deflated footballs. You're a clown without makeup sis
That's why A. Luck was one of the smartest guys to ever play in the NFL.  He could easily have been a cautionary tale for the long-term damage that football can cause. Just look at Antonio Brown. He's clearly crazy and was never the same after Vontez Burfect, the dirtiest player I've ever seen, knocked him out with a filthy hit.
she's not the one Andrew.
Takes a great person to make those life decisions...🦾🦾🦾🦾😍😍😍😍😍😍😍these are things as a fan of football is great to know. It helps me know that I made the right decision for my family. Now it's my time to shine since all my birdies have left the nest... Ty  Pat for your show👍🦾🦾🦾💯💯💯💯💯💯💯🦬🏈🦬🦬🏈🦬 Go Bills 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Are you *STILL* on about this deflated football crap? You guys got murdered in BOTH halfs! SMH, Pat. You seriously disappoint.
Type A successful people 9/10 are not good parents/spouses.   They're constantly thinking about work.
"playing against a team with deflated footballs."  Funny, after investigation, that team can describe the same thing about your team lol
He explained it when he retired in the first place…
Anyone noticed the whistle at 11:00 sounded just like the sound the camera makes when walking up someone’s driveway😭
a women role in life is to be as strong as they claim to be and support their man with their dreams and goals, especially if they knew their plans and goals before they got together. Yet again a woman destroys a man's goals and dreams by being selfish and saying ME! ME! ME! ITS ALL ABOUT ME AND I WILL LEAVE YOU, IF YOU DONT LISTEN TO ME !!!! a lot of women, (not all women) are mentally weak as f$&k !!!! so why do they keep saying women are strong, when instance's, such as this one, proves they are mentally weak as f$&k !!!! stay home for 6 months out the year and be a millionaire, she could not even handle that. if everyman, listened to their wife and stopped working because their wife said to, then this country would grind to a halt.... hash tag the reason why men make more money than women!!!!!  🤣🤣🤣
Didnt read the article, but heres a potential scenario and I’ll use the last part of the video as the basis. If in fact Luck is a pleaser, who aims to please, and doesnt perhaps take enough charge where it might count, could it be possible, that perhaps, his wife was going to walk, gave him the ultimatum of which to choose her or the ball, and given his fragile physical status at the time, and eagerness to please  a woman he loves, could have been persuaded to leave the game, because he got caught simpin? Im not saying that this is the case, im just asking is it possible? that Luck was taken out of the game for a woman who was a man eater and gave him an ultimatum that he couldnt say not to, and now he’s living his best simp life? Again, terriffic QB, helluva player and team mate, and helluva nice guy. Im not accusing, im just asking do you think its possible?
That article excerpt was amazingly written. Love it. Hard to come by anything written so fancifully like that anymore.
I went to HS with Luck at Stratford in Houston. He was born smart, rich and athletic lol
Good for him he was in a rock and a hard place and he had to choose which one he was going to lose and he kept the right one you always choose family
Pat got the timeline wrong lol the year he is talking about they lost to the Ravens in the Wild Card round. Love Luck, Pagano, and Arians though. Especially Pagano. Ravens fan here lol
Andrew Luck had the best footwork and technique I have ever seen from a QB. His 3 step, 5 step, 7 step drop back and his ability to throw on the run was an art form. He was so good at it that the Colts always made him do it despite having a terrible oline for the first few years. Grigson and Pep Hamilton ruined him with their terrible team building and archaic offense. Just imagine if he came out in 2013 and was paired up with Andy Reid? Wow that would had been a special pairing.
My take is Luck is at a crossroads and have a lot of questions and hoping he made the right moves and decisions because he's basically deciding on something that makes up his whole existence on what he is today and because he gave his all, day in day out to pursue to become the best in football but at the expense of his relationship outside of football,it hurts to give up his dream and what he worked for his whole life and he's sad to make a decision between his dream or his family and his health. And he wasn't prepared for this situation and or the situation he was in although looks to be easy if your from the outside looking in but when ur the person being put on the spotlight and have to make a decision, it becomes very complicated as you factor in everything that does not just affects Andrew but his wife and kids and his football career at its entirety. It's like working a 9-5 job making a decent wage and be present with ur wife and kids and etc over pursuing ur true passion. Thats tough
Being a Bears fan I found myself rooting for the kid.
Its crazy him and RGIII were so good
Luck grew up very wealthy, had a nice trust fund before even going to nfl. He was just there to stack some more cash and was always going to bolt after that!
That wasn't his rookie year Pat
Luck is probably the best QB since they had manning
I love Pat Mcafee but the Colts didn't go to the AFC Championship game in Luck's rookie season. That didn't happen until Luck's third season. It's weird he got that wrong because he was actually on the team those 3 years. I'm not criticizing it's just weird.
That article sounded like when you're writing an essay with a word count and you ran out of words. So you go back and start stretching the sentences out.😄
Nobody think the wife was kinda controlling
This passage that was written maybe has 11 to 12 th grade vocabulary and grammatical structure. At the most maybe first year of college. If weren't reading these words in 11th and 12th grade then either you weren't paying attention or CTE is a mother f*****
He wasn’t a rookie in the AFC championship. Rookie year he lost to the ravens
Colts lost to the Ravens his rookie in the first round. It was his third year when they lost to the Pats in the AFC championship. . Still love the show Pat.
Luck’s early retirement was a decision made based on two things. Longevity and quality of life. He loves his family more than he loved football. Period. Admirable.
45-7 lol I don't think it was the deflated footballs patty
Why do intelligent people right like that? Because making you actually think about the power of the words on the page is the goal of their writing. It sticks with the reader, generates conversation, etc. Would this be as powerful if the paragraph was simply this? Luck was conflicted between his wife and football when he retired. It took him time to make peace with giving up one love for another. Probably not gonna talk about the piece and that paragraph as much because it didn't make you think or struggle to understand it. The writer is making you struggle in the same way Luck struggled to make his decision. Good writing makes you experience the emotions being depicted with the use of better language. That's why we have so many ways to say the same thing.
Colts got bounced in the Wildcard Round in 2012 by the SB Champion Ravens.
I haven't missed a Colts game in 20+  years 💙 I miss watching Andrew play and lead the team 😔 He was the complete package, on and off the field.
Andrew knows he has a great life without football. His wife told him so. She must be one hell of a gymnast...
Still sad he retired was mad the way he did it I was one of the sorry ass Colts fans who booed him but literally after the press conference I wasn’t mad because I could see how hard his decision was to hang them up wish dude nothing but the best and have nothing but the up most respect for what he did in the short time he was they’re
He was having difficulty recovering from his shoulder injury. He was in excruciating pain on and off the field, and the additional mental burden made him miserable to be and miserable to be around. Even when he wasn't injured, being a high-level NFL QB was all-consuming during the football season and during the offseason. It changed his character and dominated every minute of his life. Major injury rehab added even more weight to it. The mental strategies he used to deal all of that stress were unhealthy and were destroying his personal life. He went through therapy and developed a bigger sense of who he was outside football. He successfully recovered from the injury, played a season of fantastic football then got injured again the following off-season. He went right back into the same mental cycle, it was again destroying him and his life, but he felt so much pressure to live up to expectations that he couldn't walk away. He rehabbed the calf, got back in time for the pre-season but he saw the strain playing had on his life and he didn't like it. He was newly married, a new father and that felt more important. So he decided, himself, not due to a marital ultimatum, HE decided to hang them up (at least according to the article).
What did I get from this? Never marry a woman that does not support your career especially when she knows what it is before you married her. In time he will resent her for it, and they will get divorced anyway. Sorry, no vagina is worth me changing what I have done my entire life, becoming rich for it, and all the sacrifices made along the way. I would’ve pulled a Tom Brady on her ass instantly!
As a indy fan its such a bad spell. I dy needs to focus. In my opion in the next 3 years we will contend.
I don’t think he went to the championship game until his 3rd year. I believe his first year was wild card, second year was divisional and 3rd year was the afc championship against the pats
Sounds like he's in a one-sided marriage and was forced to retire by his wife.
No one ever asked Conner if he read it, but then my boy came out of left field with some deep takes
Sounds like from her response to him retiring changed the narrative a little bit. Seems like Pat had a thought he wanted to express but chickened out so to say. I crack up when these ladies are upset about how much time these guys put in there career. Most retire in there mid 30’s and have the rest of there life’s to be with family. While most men work into there 60’s. Suck it up for a few years.
Torn between the game he loved and being there for his wife/kids.  Football is a dice roll on your long term health.  Walking away from the game as an elite in your prime is not easy.  I want to say he was most concerned about the ripple effect of his decision.  How would it effect everyone around him short term? Long term? A lot to think about with no definitive answer.
Well that’s it ain’t it Pat, him being too nice a guy and always trying to appease everyone. It was probably his Wife pressuring him to quit so he could be home more and still have his mind in the later stages of life , he quit to appease his wife , it all makes sense.
Been a fan since they arrived in Indy thanks to my Dad (R.I.P.) introducing me to football. It has been a tough organization to stay a fan of honestly. Luck rarely had a good enough o line to give him a chance. I will always blame Grigson for destroying Andrew Luck. I always believed Luck was in his head and was mentally exhausted. "Hearing footsteps." Now, I think that assessment was accurate. Luck could have been great.  This recent team has some serious underlying toxicity. Maybe Irsay should step away and focus on his collections. Go Colts! Miss seeing Boomstick in the White and blue! Great show y'all!
Peyton Manning is not the best prototype personality for a QB.  For as much talent as he had, he didn't win enough super bowls.  Probably point to his character and leadership style.  Think about the fear his team might play with rather than self-motivation to succeed, win, or play with joy.  He was humbled and only won his 2nd super bowl as a game manager like Trent Dilfer.
I feel like Andrew Luck and Jake Locker would get along well based on what I'm hearing here. Let's get ourselves a new football/life balance podcast!
You remember that the Colts had more deflated balls in that AFC championship game v NE, right? And deflated more than Pats balls
connors take on this was rly nice, acts like a mass-hole meathead often but these moments show some of the deeper thoughts/understanding he is capable of, more so than what AQ showed this episode.  also, the last few lines of that paragraph were incredibly insightful.. is the decision i make NOW the right one? if it is, will it still be right later? would the aspects of my life that helped make my decision still have the same weight down the line? it makes wtv decisions we make in our lives a ever-changing reality.. all that to say good for Luck
Perfect example of if ur scared go to church. Sounds like regret.
Come on guys... Also pretty clear he was getting his ass kicked and that clearly had a toll on him. All the stuff you're talking about as well but definitely the physical beating was playing a role..
First time watching.  Great show!!!   Great group of guys!!!
I read the whole article as well. Mostly gibberish. Terribly written.
His wife sounds like a me me me personality.
Since we remember they deflated balls let’s remember a majority of the points that team scored happened after the balls were fixed
Andrew Luck and Patrick Mahomes, they would have been a great match up with how they were and are as a player on the field. They were next to identical according to what they could get on the mic and camera
all you gotta do is play 3 years in the league and you get a pension that starts at 160k. join a union.
Correct me if I’m working but I’m pretty sure the colts didn’t didn’t go the afc chip Lucks rookie year
Sorry for Colts fans but you’ll find another QB, his kid(s) won’t find another father. Family over everything. salute Andrew I would do the same damn thing 🫡
yooooooooooooooooooooooooo
so clickbait...someone new writing the thumbnails?
"playing a team with deflated footballs"  no you didnt. and like that is why you lost
She gave him an ultimatum and took advantage of his kindness.  He’s a people pleaser like Pat said and his niceness is what held him back in all aspects of life.
Good for Luck, he was able to choose his family over Ego ... They all suffer the disease of More, where it’s never enough ... Sad. It’s not about football or Sport...it’s personal development and choosing Life over the artificial electricity of the crowd & or the narative. I pray for TB 12 ...⛔️🙏
Stfu about deflated balls macafee the balls were readjusted at halftime and if you set the score board to 0-0 you guys still loose 21-0 such a joke salty much
I stopped watching the NFL after Luck retired
Dude. Can they just speak English in books.  Jesus.
If I had a tenth of the money he had, I would not be working either.
Did that dude really say, it's 4 1/2 months suck it up? Some people shouldn't have a mic
GRIGSON BELONGS IN PRISON. IM NOT BEING HYPERBOLIC.
Good perspective on how challenging it is for athletes to move on from their respective sports lives. Whether on their terms or not, it’s a major transition and disruption to everything they’ve (in most cases) ever known.   Another tough story similar to Andrew Luck’s was Greg Cook’s (Bengals first round pick in ‘69, 5th overall). Cook grew up 2 hours from Cincinnati (Chillicothe, OH) and was a standout and HOFer at UCincy. NFL Films had a nice short feature on Cook’s story. Bill Walsh said he was the most talented QB he ever coached (even after having HOFers Montana and Young).   Wishing Luck the best. He made the game better - both during, and now after he’s stepped away, by sharing his story for other athletes going through what he did.
AQ is like, shut up and let me make this Money!  I'll have time for you later.
I'm sure he's happy, but I bet he will regret retiring.
I’m still mad at the fans that booed him that day. They weren’t true fans of Andrew luck, the human being
He was a political player!
Luck had all the God given ability that you could have. Physically gifted. Definitely intelligent. But the guy was socially awkward. He's odd. He was never going to conquer that.
This show is to the Colts to what ESPN is to the Cowboys. Geez.
He definitely is. The season before he retired, my daughter (who was still in college at Butler) was eating dinner with her boyfriend. She saw Andrew and texted me and was too scared to approach him. I told her if he looked like he was with other people and she said he wasn't. She did say people were approaching him all night and he talked to every single one of them with a huge smile. Finally, she just went to say "hi" to him and he talked with them for awhile, had them sit with him, and he even took a selfie of them with her iPhone. I was jealous! lol! She said he was the nicest guy. They didn't stay long because they want to let him eat his food. So I can definitely see how Pat said he was too nice of a guy. But then, nothing wrong with that. As a Colts fan, I was never angry at him for retiring like he did. I understood how he felt and it is his life he has to consider. So good for him but I can also see where he's the type of guy who will probably remain conflicted as to the decision he made. But it does sound like he's in a good place in his life and that's all I want for him.
I remember when they booed him. Indianapolis is full if pieces of sht.   Why else would NASCAR is there. Because its inbred country. Sht is different there lol
Now that I think about it. Mr. Irsay incentived Andrew to NOT come back from retirement by giving him his final salary salary of 24 million! Jim was hoping Andrew would leave on good terms, think about things and come back. That $$ probably helped seal the deal! Especially for a frugal family man like Luck.       Who quit then retired btw, not straight retired like he claims. Retired is a planed process know to all parties.  Quit is when the Colts are about to start the season and you check out!
Sounds like she wanted hers and asked him to give up his. Just no one wants to say it. Not the woman he should've chosen. You call to tell her I'm retired and all she says is ok... gotta work... lame
Who would’ve thought Luck and RG3 would both retire while Kirk Cousins is playing the best football of his career
I love everything that Man is all about. I despised the Colts Fans for booing Him after he announced his retirement. Freaking Meatheads
Can I come and check out the new studio Pat?? I actually was there before you guys moved in and was one of the people who helped your dad get rid of all the chairs that were there.. 🤣 🤣
Excellent take on this Pat & Crew!  Nothing but respect for Andrew, not only for his football greatness but as a man, making that difficult decision to walk away so that he could be there for his wife & future family AND that he'll be healthier for it years from now.  It could not have been easy.  Great that he's happy and living his life on his terms with his family
Ohio State/Vikings Robert Smith did the same
All this andrew luck hate from couch coaches
A. Q. Letting it ride!
Wicker Sham wow. You'll be saying wow every time.
That intro to the article is total crap.  What a dopey word salad.  Nobody with two working synapses wouldn't be reluctant to read any further.
Big pro tip for Pat: Don't bring up Andrew Luck's Dad up in front of Vince McMahon. Lol
McAfee said that Luck went the AFCCG in his rookie year? It was his 3rd year. 1st year was a first round exit against the Ravens who were Super Bowl champs, second year he beat the chiefs in that incredible comeback only to lose next round and then the 3rd year, beat the Bengals in the wild card, beat Peyton and Denver on the road and then went to FoxBorough and got slaughtered
The people who know football know how great he was. The others just know how to count yards and rings.
The Colts were the luckiest team in history to go from manning straight to luck! The fact that they literally ruined & broke him is sad af!
This is why they are football players and not writers.  it simply says he was conflicted (that means he had more than one line of thought) he could keep playing and win a championship or multiple and suffer more injury but what would be left of him.  Kickers don't get bashed up like the man everyone on the opposing defense is trying to put out of the game.  His conflict is regardless of how many championships and piles of cash will he be left sitting in a dark room being spoon fed tapioca being introduced for the first time to people he's known his whole life.  We all saw what it did to Ali.
You guys had deflated footballs as well. And what were Brady’s numbers in the first half with the deflated footballs versus his stats in the 2nd half. I think YOU GUYS deflated the balls to make Brady play bad…
I always wondered what could’ve been of luck stayed in the league
That whistle at 11:00 min was insane
I’m guessing because the Colts are a trash franchise and he was tired of not getting the help he needed! Not everyone can be as lucky as Burrow to go to the Bengals and then give you your choice of weapons and build you a fooking indoor facility because you said so!
No talk about his battle with addiction? The mans body was so damaged that he became dependent on pain meds.
Luck is a simp. Watch her leave his ass when she gets to where she want in life.
Andrew Luck is the obvious Luke Kuechly is a tragedy too DPOY could’ve been the best LB of his generation.
Love the CHANNEL 4 ACTION NEWS water bottle.... Sally Wiggins Army for LIFE!!!! HAHA
I like how that slug said “suck it up.” Introduce them next time because they are a nobody that I’m unaware of.
Makes sense, that's what makes greatness,  sorry family,  but you got me now for the rest of life after retirement
Yeah man we could not protect him which was B.S. big time my dudes
Peyton literally said we are stupid if we don't trade him and get that first pick and draft Luck, if that says anything,  Peyton knows his ball that's for sure 💯
Yeah Pat, what a season my brodi, one to remember, and oh yeah we got ran over and deflated lmao
It would've been nice if Andrew would have put off marriage, family, and children until after he had a long, complete career.  When athletes get married in their 20s, there is no doubt that it holds them back at least a little bit from being the very best player they can be.  Plenty of time for marriage and children after a career is over.
That really was an awesome era of Colts football.
I mean didnt he still make like 100mil in 6 years ? I don't blame him. He's already rich and accomplished enough so was his wife and he decided to give all of his time to his wife and kids. Time with your loved ones is priceless especially when you and your wife have already made over 100mil between the 2 of you lol
Luck is one of those dudes that only comes around a few times a decade.  An Allen or Herbert. Just freaks of nature. Like a 5 tool baseball player
I remember the suck for Luck Sweepstakes! Unfortunately as a Vikings fan we didn't suck enough.
Wasn’t it 2014 lucks 3rd year in the league they played NE?
Colts only went to the wildcard game and lost to the Ravens in Lucks rookie year... he didn't go to the AFC championship until the 2014 season... went to the divisional round in-between those 2 seasons so he took us a step further each season until he was hurt
Similar to the best leaders I had in the Army, there are times when a leader has to take charge and put the mission over everyone's "feelings".  It's why there is so much incompetence in the world: too many in positions of authority are worried about feelings first, and results second.  I've heard guys who said that they hated Vince Lombardi's guts when they played for him, but later thanked him for their Super Bowl rings!  "Asshole" is what the lazy, seld-centered, undisciplined masses call a true leader!
It's amazing to think that Andrew Luck is a better person than a quarterback. Especially when we consider that he was one Hell of a quarterback.
Not to be that person but I thought in Andrew’s rookie year when Chuck had cancer, the Colts got knocked out by the Ravens in the first round? AFC championship was 2014 Lucks 3rd year lol
That was so awkward. Good on Pat for calling it.
I comment how stupid this is because some army asses named Erjon the idiot  & Daniel Naches &  hacked my phone, and lots of mind-wasting sports, celebs and gunz come to my phone.
As one of the commentators said,  as long as Andrew is at peace with himself,  that's all that matters and I hope that he doesn't have any  regrets whatsoever. Not even a little one.  But as a Colts fan, damn I wish he would have played a couple more years!!  Especially given the fact that they had  finally gotten  him an o-line.
His rookie year was 2012. They went to the AFC title in 2014.
Sounds like his wife is a pain in the behind.
Colts never beat the pats in a meaningful game with luck
Luck had so so much potential
I started reading the article,quit pretty quickly. Too long, too much flower lol
Game was 45-7 and still talking about deflated footballs. The real question Pat, how did you guys keep yours from deflating in the weather without illegal tampering?
Nice intro but don't downplay the pats and there cheating
He retired and was all for the money
Doesn’t sound like his wife was sick of it. Sounds like he made the decision in his own volition. He wanted his life to be more than football and fatherhood, being a husband, and his own person meant more than being the best football player ever
He’s a real one.  All the ones trying to play forever and stack papers are of the devil. They’ll be burning in judgement
35 minutes just to say his body was sore and his wife was pissed
Still making excuses I see. Deflategate was a hoax. The pats rushed for about 300 yards and 4 TDs. Deflated footballs didn’t play a part in the azz whoopin’.
When I see Andrew luck I see a socially awkward nerd who doesn’t know how to relate to anyone. Gave up millions to be a stay at home 🐱
He ALMOST DIED!  Had there not been an MRI machine he may have bled to death.  I never blamed him.
Do you want a dad that's around all the time or do you want to drive a Ferrari to high school?
Pretty much what we already knew
So, wait, did his wife not do to him what he was allegedly doing to her? “Hey, I’m gonna quit doing what I’ve done my whole life and loved, and lived around with my dad, because I want to be more present for you.” “Okay, cool, I gotta go back to my job.” Hmmmm.
What could of been not a lot of people can say they was a quarterback in the nfl. ✌🏼❤️
Whatever.
Bro I'm not even a Colts fan why do u keep saying Luck took them to a AFC Championship game in his rookie year. He took em there in 2014 his third year n no I didn't have to look that up. Cmon bro
Pat what’s up with the biggest stack of papers on your desk ?😂lmao
Seems to me Andrew Lucks new job is gonna much more difficult than even carrying those awful Colt teams to playoffs and that’s tryin to keep an aging  Jealous broad happy
I’m the most culturally daycare ever u can imagine grass dragons 🐉!!!!!!
Organic herbalist 🌿 diet willl cure ur wife’s cancer!!!!!’
I’m a bears fan but can honestly say this is one big reason that Aaron Rogers is so good for so long. He’s has absolutely no big distractions for him to be one of the best QBs today.  I wish Mr Andrew Luck all the best for his life after football. Go enjoy your children, wife and family young sir.
And everybody was talking about how great he was gonna be. No knock on him. Just you can't listen to scouts.
Always liked to eatch luck play..kinda needs to shave his beard tho, he kind of looks like a Tolkien character with it.
Nothing smart about the way he wrote the article.  Deep thinking doesn’t make you smarter or more  intelligent than anyone else.
Pat might have some CTE because the Colts definitely didn’t make the AFC championship game Luck’s rookie year.
Jocks are boring.  I do respect Andrew luck.  What I don't respect are uneducated jocks like these hosts pretending they know what they are talking about and pretending they can talk about it or present it well.
Being great requires “imbalance”. The physical beatings Luck took on a regular basis were substantial ,old school beatings. I wasn’t surprised when he opted out. The way he played, how much of him would’ve been left had he stayed?
Whoever was rambling on about that article missed the main point of the article: he had major pain when would throw … which led to psychological issues where he wouldn’t even want to throw … and then he began questioning if he ever made the choice to be a quarterback … or was that choice made for him. And who is he if he isn’t a quarterback. The article was brilliant and I respected Luck even more for having the courage to share his story.
I was getting Andrew Cuck vibes at the end 😅
To answer the question in the description... I'm living in Florida where FanDuel is illegal, that's what I'm doing.
Andrew luck is out in the desert with Aaron Rodgers
he was so f'ed over! not worth it! he did his best tho, you just cant it so seriously. gotta still be your kid self no matter how excellent u are. just  throw'n a damn ball, clearly the management was just straight garbage/dumpster fire and no one was doing anything about it
This guy can’t talk without dropping f bombs every other word. Difficult to listen to…smh…
Andrew luck was my favorite player to ever step foot on a field . He made watching football one the most entertaining things I’ve ever seen. Pains me that it was so short lived as a colts fan. I just wasn’t prepared for it. Bc we’ve not been able to ever recover from it. But he did the right thing. I just wish he realized it a little sooner
As a colts fan I was sick from seeing him get hit like that but I really appreciate everything he gave!
You played a team with deflated footballs for the first half.  That team kicked your ass in the second half with regulation footballs.  Stop your whining
The deflated footballs line was ridiculous...Brady played better in the second half and you lost by 35 points...give me a break... most overblown controversy in NFL history...  Not to mention they lied about the numbers and tons of other things in that investigation... if it wasn't for the CBA the judges would have laughed the NFL out of court...
Dang. Insightful. Still miss the dude though.
The 2 best games I've ever personally witnessed by QBs are Michael Vick's MNF game against the Washington Redskins when he was with the Philadelphia Eagles, and Andrew Luck's game against the Miami Dolphins his rookie year. I am a Dolphins fan and watched that whole game. Luck was just better than everyone else, probably smarter. As a football/NFL fan, seeing Luck lead the Colts to better records and improve his stats each year was fun - those teams sucked, but they were still better than most teams just because they had Andrew Luck and the other teams didn't.
Big pat on the back to Connor for "attempting to read it". Nice try buddy.
Really just hope he is happy an his family  is happy
That quote was the most confusing, nonsensical pieces of literature that I have ever read. I have no idea what he was saying.
“Deflated football” which has been debunked a million times over
Cheers to that brother.  Get out before you get scratched out.
If you want to be great at anything there is a family sacrifice. He chose the family. I mean it’s ultimately up to him, there’s no right or wrong answer.
AQ keeping it real 😂😂😂. He ain’t trying to hear that
Deflate gate was made up bs
I understand that Pat McAfee doesn't have the reading comprehension of a high school teenager as he is, by his own admission, unable to follow a simple sports article. This isn't Wittgenstein or Hegel after all, it's a sports article. And what is the point in belaboring this fact? Why exactly does he feel obliged to spend several minutes telling us how thick skulled he is?
Nothing but respect for Luck.
It sounds like, ultimately he wanted to know the details of the future that his decision would cause. Kind of like one of those books where you get to choose the ending by choosing between two pages to turn to next. He wanted to be able to read the ending page first, before making the decision, but realized that was impossible so he had to make the best decision he could based off of the information he had at hand, and that frustrated him.
Rookie season colts got knocked out in wild card round by Baltimore who went on to win the SB.
Connor with the big insight brain 🧠
Respect Luck 100%. Miss the guy. But no hard feelings from Colts nation. He came in. Gave his best and got out. That’s all he ever owed the fans. Selfishly wish I could watch him play again.
The excerpt sounds like the writer is...not quite plagiarizing, but maybe is drawing HEAVY inspiration from the Hamlet "To be or not to be" soliloquy.
I’m a huge Colts fan and no pat we did not go to the AFC championship game Andrew luck rookie year what are you high?
What happened in the second half, when supposedly those balls we’re supposedly re-inflated?  You lost, because you were not good enough.. period!!
I’m my Juelz Santana voice Luck is What The Games Been Missing
Get the history right-lost in wildcard rookie season-lost in divisional round second season-lost in afc championship third season
We went to the AFC Title game in the 2014 season. Luck's third season, not his rookie year.
My take on the article was that Andrew wanted to be the best QB that he could be but the injuries took their toll on him. The time required to heal from the injuries and not being physically and mentally present with his family alienated his wife and she made an ultimatum. His trainer started to talk to him about how he saw himself, merely as a football player or as a husband and father? I think that Andrew was one of the best QB's to play the game, he changed the position in the time that he played but he chose his family over football. I respect his decision and I'd rather hear that he's happy rather than him getting injured beyond rehabilitation.
I'm happy that Luck was able to make the right choice for HIM.   It doesn't change that he professionally quit on his team.
Had Luck continued to play, you'd have never heard of Patrick "Choke" Mahomes, because Indy would have been in the Super Bowl instead of the Chiefs.
AQ very clearly was upset about him retiring 😂
Andrew took the ultimatum and Tom didn’t.
Barry Sanders played 10 full seasons. A decade of football. You could argue he could have played longer but in no way did he retire early. Average football career is 2.5 years and is usually smaller for RBs.
Women never support their husband the same way men support their wife's
*HOT TAKE ALERT* -- LUCK SIGNS ON TO BECOME THE NEW YORK JETS STARTING QB NEXT SEASON AND BRINGS THE JETS THEIR 1ST SUPERBOWL RING SINCE BROADWAY JOE NAMATH
🤣🤣🤣 Pat and the reading comprehension bit
I went to an Ivy League school.  I read philosophy and theology for fun.  That ESPN+ article is not written intelligently.  It is written badly.  It is word salad.  Don't sell yourself short Pat.
Bruh the colts did not go to the afc title game in 2012…
michela jordan had to be an asshole  - michael schummacher hat to be one too - every GOAT seems thad be like that sometimes  - the only exception i know (and i mean it cause we met several times) rodges federer
I always had the most respect for Andrew Luck.  The young man was a BEAST.  If he had a better team around him the sky was the limit.
God damn. Pat, you reading.... yeesh. Good reading, bad reading voice. Hahahaha
The DOLTS failed Andrew and they continue to fail their fans. Peyton Manning carried a mediocre team to the Super Bowl in 2009, and another division title the following year despite no running game and a weak offensive line. He finally couldn’t carry them anymore. So what does the BS King Jimmy Irsay do? He expects a 22 year old kid to do the same thing, with a team of castoffs, rookies, a first time coach and GM. And you know what. Andrew almost SUCCEEDED. Unfortunately they were completely unprepared for the 2015 Championship game or the 2018 Divisional round. I am happy for Andrew, not just that he is enjoying his life but that he is far away from this LOSER organization. As long as Irsay has his slimy paws all over the DOLTS, he will continue to hire errand boys, the team will continually fail in the clutch, and there will never be a Super Bowl parade in Indianapolis. And I’d advise Colts Nation to do the same thing Andrew did: MOVE ON
Pat's reading level is over 9000
He made the best choice for himself. End of story.
new england deflatriots
Luck was always so fun to watch. I will never forget being at the 2014 playoff game vs the Chiefs, it was a masterpiece. 38-10 some 76 seconds into the third quarter before Luck did the near-impossible: He led them to a 45-44 victory! Lucas oil was shaking downtown. I miss watching him play. No one has come close since
i retired from football after watching racist blacks take a knee during the star spangled banner. and obama  nd the nfl said it was ok. the racist black lies matter to the nfl and youtube
Awndrew luck was so good
If you think that wad convoluted then you have a couch potato brain.
The big thing is the "what's left". If he puts his body on the line now even though he wants to and it feels right what would be left of him after football? What type of father and husband would remain after he has thrashed his body and brain once he's over it. These feelings of not wanting to let go will fade away and the the feelings of wanting to live a healthy and sustainable life might be in jeopardy because of his present at the time choices. He chose to let go for his future and sacrificed the present. That's what I got from it.
I listened to this on 2x speed one time. He's saying that he explored those future, hypothetical scenarios in his mind in an attempt to determine the most fulfilling course of action. Ultimately, while this thought exercise lead him to give up football, he'll never know with certainty if he indeed made the most fulfilling decision.
Pats fan here and I watched him thinking he was going to be better than brady and manning. Really unfortunate loss for us football fans. I truly think he would be considered better than mahomes today if he was still playing and remained healthy.
That excerpt sounds like it was written by somebody who needs to lay off the shrooms
He played 6 or 7 seasons in the NFL. He was ok, but was never going to be one of the greats. Better that he kept his health at least.
I disagree, he left us, im 6'3
Woulda been to 2 or 3 Super Bowls and had 1-2 rings in his career .
I'm a very big Colts fan. I was loving that we almost seamlessly went from Peyton to Luck. I was ready for some more Suoer Bowl wins. My wife even went and got a tattoo about him. Her tat said Lucky Girl with the shoe. She and I were very disappointed, for the biggest reason that he quit right before the season. If he made the decision after that season, or before the draft, we could've been more content. After hearing this info, we get it, family is everything. Just look at what happened with Brady cause he chose to play again. Good for you Luck. Again, family is everything.
It's a vary good read. That section was a summation of wrapping up many of what was going on in Luck's mind. The article isn't al like that, or even mostly.
He was tired of losing to Brady
There is literally an article written about Luck's thought process and we're listening to three guys that didn't read the article and one guy that read most of it for answers...freaking hilarious!
Dude I'm trying to retire from Albuquerque public schools and I'm going to make probably 1300 a month that's my pension Andrew luck is doing good
I’m like 5 minutes in and still got no idea why he retired. Get to the point
I think He comes from money so there is no hunger to keep playing to make the money 💰 look at players who come up poor they don’t ever want to stop making money
Don Meredith
No idea what that even said
Pat you said his rookie season luck went to the AFC Championship. No he didn't bro
I’ve been a Colts Fan forever…. Through the ups and down I’ve always stayed true to the blue. I thought after losing Peyton there’s no way in Hell we’ll ever find someone at least half as good as him. Then I saw Andrew and boy I was never so excited to watch football I’m so many years. My goodness he was such a breath of fresh air to my football life. I knew with him we’d win at least 3 SuperBowls easily. Then that day came and I swear I’ve never cried about a athlete until that very day. The First Jersey I ever owned was his.
That article made no sense. I read it and it was nonsense.
Luck had NO luck. He was getting the STAFFORD treatment, getting his ass kicked for a DEAD team with NO future, no coaching, stuck in perpetual "rebuild" and trying to CARRY a dead horse over the finish line. At least Stafford got ONE magical season and a super bowl title before the wheels fell off.
I wonder how many others also thought what a PERFECT last name 'LUCK' was to go with that Horseshoe on The Indianapolis uniform!?
They finally built Luck the O-line he needed, Brisett and the colts had a good season because they finally had the line. Couldve been a superbowl season honestly if he was there
Luck was and still is a great QB...no doubt he would have ended his career in indy and achieving a gold jacket
When Pat asks how long it took to read the article and the answer was 35-40 minutes. He looks at the camera dramatically and says "Jesus."  I felt that.
Anyone else find it hilarious to watch Zito's face in Ty's reflection when Ty is being animated? I'm dying over here
He should coach.
Luck did the right thing, step away from setting he loves for his family.....Brady could learn a thing or two, but he lost his family cause he couldn't give up his addiction(football)
Vikes fan here. The shortly lived, Andrew Luck Era Colts, were must watch TV. He helped contribute to some of the best football I've ever seen in the mid 2010's. An era that also included prime Rodgers, Brady, Manning, Brees.
“Don’t live your life according to OTHERS expectations.”  The most regret people say before they die.
Umm Andrew luck did not go to afc championship game in rookie year like 90 percent what he said was wrong
He must've banked at least $50-mill,....he kept his $20-mill/for the year he quit...(hope he thanked the owner).....*not bad*.
For all we know he would have alex smithed his leg if he kept playing and he dodged some massive bullet like a gambler and no one will ever know. You gotta feel things out
Really? That text was hard for you? But Rodgerses triped-up ramblings make sense??:)))
"Playing a team with deflated footballs." 😂😂😂So what happened in the 2nd half of that game? I forget 🤣What a clown comment by McAfee. Also articles behind paywalls are BS.
Andrew Luck retired because they pulled the Colts championship off the table because too much money was being bet on the Colts in 2017. The sports books couldn't handle the wages. Facts 💯
So.. He’s WHIPPED
yeah, I dont care this was a waste of time
you're crazy if you think i'm going to watch something with a scrolling ad the entire video
I don’t blame him, the Colts still don’t have a good o-line. His body would be in shambles today, watching the Colts crash and burn miserably this year would give me all the clarity I needed.
AQ Shipley: Luck has a wife and a kid, “can’t they just suck it up for 6 months?” That’s half of the year dude 😂 every year not to mention. A kid needs more time and attention than that
Much respect for Luck I love his durability and competitive spirit I watched the colts because he was a beast. Hard to play for a organization where the owner is a ass and never got the man any protection beat his body to peices he is one of my all time favorites wish the best for you and family Andrew luck is a amazing person.
⁵⁸⁸⁸⁸⁸
Shipley he obviously wasn’t just focusing on football for 4 months. It was obviously consuming him. Which is cool when you are a single guy. When ya have ya kids it’s completely different. Plus he married a career woman. Maybe Shipley married his hs sweetheart who was just riding his check so of course she’s going to take anything that comes with him playing as long as possible.
Personally so think he made the right decision. I don’t believe that long term health, wealth, fame, records, etc is more valuable or important than one’s wife and children. I enjoyed watching him play and enjoyed even more his off the field contributions to the community.   I would much rather remember him as a great man, father, and husband who cared about the people around him than for any accomplishments on the field.
I always looked at Andrew luck as  overrated.
No one will ever impact the game the way Andrew Luck did. I watched all of his games and he was the only offensive player for years that would get picked up off the ground by the defense. Everyone respected him. I love Luck and super happy for him. He didn't hurt the Colts with his retirement. Ryan Grigson's chump ass hurt us!
In football terms Andrew luck simply quit in his prime. . Plain and simple.   He was the total package however he was mentally soft.   It makes sense what struggle has he gone through,  He comes from a rich family,   Went to Stanford, In high school everyone knew he was gonna go to the NFL.  What adversity has the actually gone through.   The only adversity hes gone through is the few injuries he had and then he decided to quit. shame on his wife if she had any pressure that she gave him had anything to do with his retirement.   He went on to seeking confirmation bias to quit.  He wanted to quit and he was looking for the right reasons to do it.   When you're mentally tapped out you find a reason to tap out.  SOFT   No one quits for their family or wife lets be real.  In the NFL your time is limited anyways.  From what Patt describs luck was a pleaser.
He doesn't want to be old and broken, he takes a lot of hits and seeing a few people that has taken big hits a lot and not living the rest of their life regularly because of the injuries he probably seen himself going down that road and didn't want to, and I could respect that, not everybody gets hit as much as he did as hard as he got hit too, he probably felt as if another big hit he'd be done and probably wouldn't be able to walk or something that statement he made, makes me think this, the injuries that do long lasting damage that no one talks about and I think he was trying to say it with out saying it, maybe I'm wrong but just seeing him take hits the way he did he's strong but the human body can take only so much
I need the Hawkeyes stuff lol. Iowa boy stuck in the south, very hard to find Hawkeyes gear down here.
That’s why the greatest are selfish assholes. Mj, Kobe, Brady. Sucks but true.
The colts screwed him. The colts never invested in any weapons for him and on the oline. That thinking has changed with rookie franchise qbs.
I think we all know his story by now, it's not really a shock.
Ima wear my luck jersey now🥲🥺
Not colts fan, but still remember thinking it was selfish move by him. But getting older, I realize you just do what is best for you. Your job will never love you as much as your family
Everyone read my comment!! I'm mad at luck because he decided to con his way to the NFL knowing damn well football is a man's game and he gave Everyone false hope. So no! I'll never forgive that con man.
Pat is the most long winded person I have ever seen
Chose what the woman wanted over his passion.  Commendable but it is a bad move once she becomes unhappy.  He will loose in the end investing in marriage over such a rare opportunity.
Deflate Gate Pat's stayed cheating
AQ sounding like a clown
Andrew Luck was a great QB and man. Luck was on a bad Colts team that the front office ruined his career by poor draft picks advanced him a player.  Andrew found peace in his life. God Blessed Luck and his family. Thanks gentlemen for the daily show that makes my work more enjoyable.. Blessings and Merry Christmas to you all.
Probably easier to call it quits after collecting 130 mil lol. Wax poetic or stew philosophical all you want, the missus can say she has things to do too, but it's a bit easier to roll out with that loot on top of the owner letting you keep that signing bonus.
It’s not Convoluted it’s just a very complex thought.
Bro I need a pat mcafee audio book
I love you pat but 😂come on man it was 45-7
Colts is the worst organization in the NFL...
This is the second time I’ve heard Pat say “Part of a book club, never read a book”…….😂😂 this needs to be a constant joke….lol
I think everyone deserves a person in their life like a Pat McAfee.
Imma say he started smoking weed took his desire away.
Andrew Luck and the colts were eliminated in the first round his rookie year by the Ravens.
Pat don’t act like you lost that game cause of Deflated footballs. Yall got your doors blown off
deflate gate was proven false lol calm down
I honestly respect Andrew for leaving.  As a fan, I sincerely miss watching him play.  He was amazing to watch. That being said, if him continuing to play would have resulted in him being miserable then I think it's safe to say it would have impacted him on and off the field.  I know when I have to do work odd shifts or major amounts of overtime that it makes my home life miserable and that in turn has an impact on the work I do.  I respect him because he had enough self-awareness to see the conflict, spend time to understand it, and then make a decision that would resolve the internal conflict he had been struggling with, and it would have been a very hard decision given that he spent a long time and put in enormous effort getting to the point he was at.  It really sucked to see him walk away, but I'd rather see someone be happy and find a healthy balance in their life than continue being miserable.  I'd like to hope that maybe one day I can buy Andrew a beer as a small thank you for all he went through while playing for the Colts.
The problem with Andrew Luck was always that he was too smart to play football. He was great, at times transcendent, but he always knew he could do anything else, and had plenty of other passions and interests, and that fire to win a championship is both necessary but also fundamentally a foolish aspiration. I wasn't a huge fan of the way he did it in terms of timing, but I can't say I was surprised.
A. Q. Shipley was a bum, so Pat continuing to defer to him as if he was closer to him couldnt be farther from the truth, he was one of those guys that couldnt keep him upright, thats why he sounds so salty in this video. He literally showed the least remorse for anything out of all of them. Nothing but a bench player that made 5 or so ER starts...
I think an unfortunate part about being an academic, a cultured person, a well traveled person, is you’re always of the mindset there is someone more experienced and  knowledgeable than you OR that there is so much left to learn, and in all reality you really know nothing. The moment at which a student becomes a teacher is so crucial yet impossible to define; this is what academics struggle with. As spoken about throughout this video, Luck’s intellect was second to none; it’s no wonder he was so willing to trust and believe in his coaches even after becoming the CEO - as Pat states - of the Colts. A point of clarity where no more clarity is necessary is when Luck was no longer a student.
Good for Andrew Luck. Imagine playing this barbaric stupid sport? It’s such a stupid game.
Exactly like Tom. Where will I be? I give up the Cat’s In The Cradle or I enjoy it. I’m a cripple and mental defect, or I’m dad and architect; so Andrew chose the family and normalcy. I choose the real $ millions.
AQ Shipley does NOT agree with Luck's decision. You can tell it actually pisses him off. 17.30 and 18.30 . Also the other guy chimes in 'so one person's job is..... ' at  19.14. I tend to sympathize with AQ moreso.
I enjoyed watching Luck when he was at Stanford and I started to cheer for the colts just because of Luck. Loved watching him play.
The threat of CTE is a real thing. He doesn’t mention it but I believe it played a part. He got out at a good time. Made a chunk of change and has his whole life ahead of him.
Luck is three years healed up Which is a good thing !
AQ is such a manly man.. Empathy is for the weak!
I feel like we would have a different conversation if the success matched the talent…. He really got beat up a lot and the colts were just ok
The article was verbose and self-indulgent. Luck deserved a better writer.
One of the saddest days of my love for sports and being a life long bleed blue 💙 colts fan  A. Luck retiring was a shock and my heart dropped to my toes one of my favorite players of all time and knowing from that point on the colts was done and we have struggled every since that day... But I'm I'm not mad at him for choosing his family and his health over football... That being said the colts did not put a line around Luck to keep him from getting sacked nore did they respect him on healing from injuries I think they pushed him to come back and not just the colts but alot of the colts fans was impatient as well I think a lot of things should have been different but you reek what you sow    #12  all time legend and I was privileged to watch him play the game of football giving 110% every snap for every game he played... coltsnation317
One Does not need an article to look at Andrew luck's body after the toll it took on him. You just don't plug and play a QB without having a O-line to protected him. Peyton manning Spoiled them with that but it also cost him a neck injury. If you protect your greatest asset you are doom to fail. The Colts management at that time obviously didn't do their homework and started to draft offensive lineman. No they had to settle for Carson Wentz and Matty Meltdown.
So his wife ruined his NFL Career ok… left when he was finally healthy…What Peyton would have gave even more to the game if he was healthy. She was selfish turned this man into a house dad….
Colts don't deserve anything for awhile for booing him.
I love the conclusion they made at the end lol better left unsaid
You want to be Andrew Luck or Tom Brady   What a great choice to decide
did he just imply deflated footballs were the reason they got blew out? lol
Only dumbasses will think this pathetically written article is a good write. And of course, most sports junkies are stupid anyway. Whoever wrote this is not smart either
Rocking the VGK! Love it guys! Go Knights Go!
I read it and it sounded like Lucks physical issues cracked him mentally and he couldn’t find his self-identify unless he was healthy. So he quit trying to be “the quarterback”
My favorite player from Stanford and I became a Colts fan because of him. I have his jersey and autographed Colts helmet… I keep hoping that he’ll return one day…
Is that a grown man wearing a tank?!
Someone should write a book about Andrew Luck…
How do you like those apples!?
Boy is hella smart
Loved Luck him retiring after pre season and before the season started wasn’t the coolest move tho
Low-key simpin
One of the most amazing things about meeting God is that He actually has satisfying answers to these exact questions.
Andrew luck was raw
Andrew was incredible. Stand up man, stand up player. Colts fans should be ashamed forever for the way they booed him off the field. He gave his everything to the game he loved and it broke him down over time for a multitude of reasons, and for him to have the strength to recognize that his time with football could be over and to shift his focus onto his family and the rest of his life is beyond commendable. I wish I got to see a full career out of him because he absolutely would have been in the GOAT conversation at the end of it, and I truly believe when talking about the greatest to ever do it, his name should always be brought up with a little asterisk.
How could a guy so smart choose such a horrible time to tell the team that he was retiring? At least do it before the Draft. Not two weeks before the start of the season.
you lost because of deflated footballs?   weak and dubious
I need pat to talk at my retirement party.great hype man 💯🔥🔥🔥
That whistle at 11:00 is all time
Andrew Lucks rookie year was 2012. The Ravens won the AFC Championship. How does this guy not even know his own career? Why is he so popular?
Luck must have chosen a very good wife.   I commend him for being a Man.   He has achieved a level of happiness few people attain.
Got this playing in the car speakers and at 10:59 Pat makes it sound like i got a message lmao
Keep blaming deflated footballs when it was proven BS. We ran it down your throat so bad even if the balls were deflated on purpose it wouldn’t of mattered, your run defense would’ve still been atrocious
Nothing but respect for Andrew Luck . Crying shame how the Colts treated him. No offensive line and horrible play calling. Can someone please kick the Irsays out of football
Hearing his background for the first time, it sounds like he came from a good upbringing….someone with less couldn’t have come to that peace.
Luck got slaughtered with injuries
That article took me so long to read lmao I didn't realize how long it was till I looked at the clock. Very good story.
Seeing what happened to Tom Brady's marriage probably reinforced the feeling that he made the right decision to retire.
Pat I love you but his rookie season ended in a wildcard defeat to the soon to be super bowl champion Baltimore Ravens
Felt like Dr. Suess wrote that quote
That's the most overly wordy paragraph I've ever read. It boils down to, "Andrew Luck isn't sure he made the right decision."
Respect to him for being intelligent and not following what the sheep want him to do.
I probably would have been a Luck fan if he wasn't a colt. He probably would have lasted longer before he retired if he played for another team. Qbs have to get rid of the ball QUICK if they play for the Colts if they don't want short careers.
What that paragraph said to me is: he chose health, life, fatherhood, and husbandhood over being considered as one of the greatest to ever play the game. He is conflicted about that decision and was for a while because he came to the resolution that he would always be conflicted about the decision.
Im a writer and the first half of thst paragraph is just poorly written. Its pretention for pretentions sake
There were so many short and long term consequences it’s impossible to know what could have been hit was huge change for him bc he spent his whole life working to be nfl qb
Luck quit because Irsay threw him under the bus
He is essentially is saying he is seeking a firm validation that his at the time feeling and decisions are okay, now and forever
"Where we played against a team with deflated footballs."  Ha!  17-7 with the 'deflated' footballs.  Final score 45-7.  The Colts would have been better off if the balls were never questioned.  I don't listen to McAfee's show but has he ever focused on tanking the season?  I mean was it any coincidence that they had shirts made and the season motto was 'Suck for Luck' and then they went out and did just that?
It's all Grigson's fault
Guess Jim irsay rubbed off on andrew
He could’ve been the best if he was just an asshole
Love that he blames the footballs for the loss
Kinda sounds like his wife wanted it to be all about her
Sad was hopefully for a comeback story
Really was excellent reading...
Apparently Jethros buddy Fetterman, not so good at reading.
They waited til 18minutes out of 19 to tell us his wife gave him an ultimatum lmaooooo!!! They sat and argued or discussed the damn thing for 18min before saying the most important part roflllll
Hey Jethro can read, good boy, someone give him a treat
I miss Darius Butler.
Im not a football fan but here for Pat since hes part of WWE Universe. This article seems like someone trying to be a philosopher but doesnt have the IQ to be one.  What I get from it is the guy struggled with hurting himself and if its worth the millions and fame if he may never walk again, live in pain, unable to be there for his children family wife.  We all make that choice of sacrifice and some of us a greater choice than others. For Example:  I choose it was worth dying for my country even if it would hurt my family and joined the Navy becoming a disabled Veteran a year later. Was it worth it? Fast forward 20yrs - I dont even speak to my family.
Honestly after this video , it kinda makes me understand the Tom Brady situation a lot more . Cause like u said if u wanna be a great QB, you have to have all your focus on football and being a great QB. Which will affect your relationship outside of football. And when you do that for 24-25 years and you stop and retire, it’ll take along time to get really get over it and get used to it . And Gisele just got tired of it
He was obviously worried about injury. A few more years of family sacrifice isn’t enough reason for me.
Bet he's a bitchin architect
“We end up playing against a team with deflated footballs” As if you guys were even close Blount ran u off the field
What is there to grasp or understand? He got beat up and his family wanted more from him so he chose them over football. He feels conflicted because he loves football and wonders how it would’ve turned out but he made his decision and he’s sticking by it. 11:36
Brady chose wrong lol
2014 was the year of the “deflate gate” and the AFC championship game that the ravens “Supposedly” snitched on the Patriots whole deflated football thing there Pat…..
The year that LUCK went to the playoffs as a rookie I’m pretty sure was when they lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC WILD CARD. NOT THE AFC CHAMPIONSHIP….
i wonder if pat knows that his gold chain hanging on his neck poisons the blood...
I was also at Deflate Gate. The Colts had zero chance in that game.
Properly inflated balls wouldn’t have accounted for 31 points
Peyton Manning is the goat football player, father, and husband.
Colts fans thought getting rid of wentz and getting Ryan is an upgrade!
I read the whole article, and the wife didn't give him an ultimatum. They weren't married at the time, and their first daughter wasn't born yet. She was going to leave because of the lack of communication in the relationship. Please read the article before expounding the bull💩 about the wife giving him an ultimatum. He left because football wasn't doing it for him anymore.
Sorry Pat but yall were going to get smoked regardless of the footballs
Conner attempted to read it 😂
AQ wasn't having it. I think he's got some angst there still.
My dynasty league QB. We never recovered
Pretty excellent, well thought out breakdown from a small regional radio show. Hammer dahn
They didn’t go to the AFC championship Lucks rookie season it was his 2nd or 3rd season. The AFC championship his rookie season was Ravens vs Pats, the Ravens beat Luck and the colts in the wild card that year. It was year 3 that Pats deflated the footballs
I remember when people said he was gonna end up with two or more rings at some point
I thought we knew this already
Fugazi it was all fluff. Could be sumerized in two sentences
I live in Indianapolis.   I have a 21yr old son with aspergers syndrome.   Andrew Luck is on the spectrum. I feel it, and felt it the day he arrived.  That's why he went through the mental foibles.
"where we play against a team with deflated footballs." Ohhhhh no, the reason you lost wasn't because of deflated footballs, it's because they were a better team. Next you'll say, "they cheated because some of the players on the other team used steroids, HGH, supplements, testosterone replacement, stickum, the sun was in our eyes, the weather favored the other team. The refs F#@ked us.
We see him at the park with his little girl sometimes.  I don't think he's really torn on whether he made the right call.  It makes sense to me that he will have some thoughts and regrets about what might have been, but I think he is very happy with his choice day to day.
STOP STOP STOP! LUCK QUIT! AVERAGE AT BEST
So the guy who interprets the paragraph, like, basically, like, like, basically, literally, like , basically was supposed to provide like, basically insight.
His wife made it about her. She's used his nice guy personality to get what she wanted in life.
Oh yeah. I remember that game with the deflated footballs. If I recall they replaced all the balls at half time and that Patriots demolished y’all even MORE in the second half 😬
I saw Andrew in person when he played against Oregon State his senior year. I can confirm that he is a really big strong guy. I had seen a lot of pictures and video of him at the time becase he was a heisman frontrunner at that point, but man he looks much bigger in person.
Tons of respect for andrew
That’s any job fellas  You gotta dedicate your life to your craft  From the school teachers to the athletes  That being said I can feel for you bc I ask myself similar questions but your playing a kids game for a kings ransom  Suck it up
Andrew luck made the colts
Pat is a legend hid podcasts r great
Family is everything.....football is just a game
Seems like he was a smart enough guy where he could fully comprehend the commitment it would take to perform at a high level going forward and he realized he had other options outside of football to make a living. Whereas alot of players in the NFL football is THE best and many cases only way for them to make good money for the rest of their lives. Looks like he weighted the pluses and minuses of continuing to play compared to how he wanted to live and said to himself it's best for me and mine to just walk away now. It's like being at a poker table in a casino with a big stack and just getting up and cashing out while u were ahead instead of going on and risking losing it. Was never a colts fan but most people in his situation wouldn't and don't make that decision. He did that and knew many people wouldn't understand and probably be upset with him for it. For that I gotta admire him for that.
I love how AQ is basically like "no.. he 1000% made the wrong choice." No fake appearances, no doublespeak, just says what he thinks.
Boi they wrapped that ending up with out ending it lol
Does gray shirt ever shut up?
Man the NFL might look completely different if he would have stuck around. Especially when they found Jonathon Taylor. But he's only got 1 life like everyone else, he didn't want to loose the things that meant the most to him in it.
Appreciate the take by Ty and Connor to boil the article down.
He was 🧀
It’s rare for men to be fathers first nowadays. If there’s toxic masculinity in this world it’s men trying to prove they are the best at their job and not being the best at being a father and husband
You need to have him on the show, just to see how his life is now and have him interact with the guys
This might have been the most accidentally hilarious podcast I've seen in awhile -- Idk if its schtik, or what, but I've never seen any host so completely transparent about his intellectual limitations 😅  But gawd love Pat Macafee & crew for focusing on all the right things, and after a few good laughs, a rather informative set of insights from the collective. That was 20 minutes well spent. Thanks, guys
Andrew Luck needs to be on this show!!!!
His story is similar to a lot of Americans stories.  Now, most people arent making millions playing a game on TV but the reality is a lot of people leave careers they love because of injury or stress on other elements of their life that they deem more important.    I know a lot of people (especially in 2020-2021) who left their careers in law enforcement, nursing, teaching, etc and they absolutely loved what they did but their careers were killing them and their families so they left and did something else because they wanted to be alive to meet their grand kids.    I mean, look at a guy like Brady and what his career has done to his family.
love how they wrapped it up as soon as they started to think Andrew Luck's wife might be selfish lol
You can tell AQ is still not happy with him. Seems like he’s not happy with luck
Andrew Luck with or without football was going to be fine in life so it couldn't have been that tough of a decision.
AQ Shipley seems like a big asshole from anything I have seen from him
Andrew luck gave all his superbowls to tom brady! Lol! Luck ruined my prediction streak. Not happy about it. But you gotta do what ya gotta do. Best wishes luck!
Went to AFC championship in his third year. First year wildcard, then divisional second and third year was the afc championship run.
That awkward moment at the end almost completely changes the context of the conversation.😅 His comments seem to make more sense after that last disclosure: he sounds like a man who made a decision without really feeling like he had a choice. His wife’s “concerns” and ultimatum don’t make it seem like he had the option of keeping his family together and continue to do what he loved. Which is bogus, because there are many football players—many GREAT athletes—who were able to have families and careers. Not to say there weren’t rocky or rough patches, but it can be done. But only if both partners are willing. Considering his wife’s career is in no way conducive to having a lot of family time, that angle doesn’t seem very strong.   If you step away from a sport from a genuine concern about your health, you may think, “Ah, what might have been!”, but you don’t question whether or not it was the right choice. If it’s a clear-cut decision between family and career, I don’t think you wonder if you made the right choice. When you compromised who you are and what you really wanted because of manipulation and the (mistaken) belief that there was only one option you could choose…that’s when you have regrets and wonder if you made the right call.   He went to her country for their wedding. He gave up his career while she continues in hers. I hope I’m wrong, and ultimately my take is inconsequential, but I think this “really nice guy” has very little voice in that relationship, and made concessions he didn’t need to. It really could have been all about the injuries, but we’ve seen guys like Montana, Manning, Marino, Bennett, Rodgers, and a litany of other greats play through injury whenever possible. For someone who loved the game as much as he did, I find it hard to believe that injuries were the cause of his departure.   We may bemoan what we give up to make the right decision, but we don’t regret that decision or wonder about whether it was in fact right. I just hope for his sake I’m dead wrong, and that it was his genuine concern for his health, or his own realization about time that he was missing with his wife and child…but I think at the end, the fellas all realized that might not be the case, and wisely shifted away from further speculation. —I thought it was worth at least mentioning, though again, it changes nothing.
Andrew Luck basically did what we all wish we could. He retired before his body and mind failed him with loads of money in the bank, and was able to prioritize his family instead of gaining the whole world, but losing his soul.
I see why Pat retired. I noticed on punts our own teammates were letting it roll into the end zone and otherwise purposely screwing Pat. I can’t believe Coach Pagano let Grigson do that crap. It changed my perception of the NFL that’s for sure.
Pat made a mistake. The Colts at the end of Andrew Luck’s rookie season got eliminated wild-card weekend by the Baltimore Ravens. Two seasons later, they were in the AFC Championship Game.
They ending bit really messed with my head. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Fans booing him for retiring should really evaluate themselves as a person.
The "deflated footballs" was one ball that was one of many balls used during one half of a game that was the weight equivalent of a dollar bill under suggested PSI, but stay bitter.  Colts got out-classed every time Luck played New England. Enjoy your "2014 AFC Finalists" banner lol
So, did he retire because he loved his family .....or his wife was unhappy that he wasn't home enough? Kinda sounds like he is trying to justify his decision in his own mind. In any case, very good QB.
This show SUCKS
Some of these guys make more than some of us make in a life time, in just a few years, HELL, I don't blame Luck,  Make a few millions and get the hell on, before your body gets beaten up, then invest in somethin or start your own business 🤷
Great job reading that Pat. It hurt my brain just listening to you read it!
Pat it’s scientifically proven that balls lose air in below freezing temperatures stop it it was 17° that game let it go
Football > Family                           - Tom Brady
Wait. I thought we already knew why he retired?
Barry Sanders, Calvin Johnson, and Andrew Luck gotta applaud them. All were on paths to potentially go down as the best to ever do it at their position and all of them chose their own health and happiness over the sport. Nothing but respect.
I was shocked when he retired, but no matter how great and tough you are, there are things you have to give up to be a QB1 in the NFL. He made the right decision. I'm so glad I got to see him play in person at Lucas Oil Stadium. There are few professions that allow you time with your family. I'm not in one, and my family suffered for it. I get it. I was just shocked at the time because he was so young. I'm glad he made the right decision.
When I watch how NFL teams go about drafting QBs, the crappy job they do in developing them, and the way they kick them to the curb, you'd have to be nuts to want that job.  The payday is there but it's two to fours years of being the garden of agony. Who needs that?
Seems like AQ is being a bit hypocritical here agreeing with Pat with the he needs to make more decisions and be more of an asshole take, and then Andrew says "ok I am going to retire to spend more time with my family and take care of my mental health" oh no not that decision there is plenty of time for that.
he explained when he left lol
I'm a Washington Huskies fan (and grad), and my dad and I made the drive from Seattle to Palo Alto EVERY chance we had to go watch Andrew Luck play during his Stanford career. I haven't been as blown away by a college QB ever (though Michael Penix Jr. might be even more of a joy to watch).
If only we all were privileged enough to be able to walk away from a job that impacts an entire state’s fortunes with multi millions in our pockets. Must be nice to not feel obligated to others while walking away with the generational wealth they’ve made possible for you.
I will never forgive or have zero respect to Adam Scheffter for getting this man booed off the field by his own fans. Hate that his actual last memory on a football field is that. This man couldn't even have his own chance to tell the fans. Sure, we understood but literally in the middle of the last preseason game destroyed those fans hopes for the upcoming season.
There's no substitute for intelligence...it pays off each and every day.
Nice job stopping just when The conversation was getting off the rails!!
Andrew Luck should have went to Carolina , it would have been a for sure championship with our defense..  instead we got Scam Newton and the downfall of Carolinas future
Dude worked hard, hit it big, and cashed out his chips early. Can’t disagree with that.
Feels like its been 10 years
he explained it the day he did it, you didn't listen to him.
Andrew Luck is a MAN in every sense of the word. Having chosen to leave his passion in order to become a superior husband, father and more engaged human, he stands out as a model for so many athletes who silently question their own priorities because to do so would diminish them as being fully committed in their own minds about how great a professional they feel the need to be. I mourn his absence on the football field, but praise his decision to place his physical, mental and emotional health before his inevitable induction in Canton. The world is a better place with him as the man he is now.
Short answer. I love the game but I want to be able to enjoy my life unbroken after I'm done playing this game. Having kids changes life perspective real quick if you're not selfish.
Andrew designed his House. He still lives in Indy on the North West side. He said he drives by the Colts Complex all the time. Wow. How tough a decision he had to make. Ask yourself what you would have done.  That's tough. I will always love Andrew as a fan. I was angry when he retired of course, but years later im Ok with it. God Bless you Andrew. Go Colts.
Get over it McAfee, Patriots would of beat the colts with fricken tennis balls. Let's see since then, Brady has 4 more superbowl rings? And the colts have zero playoff wins?  Kind of seems like Andrew luck saw the writing on the walls, colts keep retreading tires and are surprised when the wheels come off? Even though theyre in the upper quartile of the upper quartile of the upper quartile.
Indianapolis ran to many scams!!!!!! that’s why he had no protection😂😂😂😂😂😂
Luck knows that the NFL scripted. He like many others are told when to win and lose the NFL is Al about money not integrity .
Man they “deflated ball” still haunting you huh Pat? 😂
Pat's point about Luck being too nice is so on point and happens right across society.  The call is for men to be like a a nice guy like Andrew, but if you are it just chews you up.  Happy for Andrew that he's able to step back and change his circumstance and is enjoying life and wish him the best. Only wish that option was avaliable for so many others!
This guy's prose makes me gag and cross my eyes. Literally gag me with a fuckin spoon.
Difference between him and Brady…. Brady ain’t letting his wife dictate his career
This guy acts like Dave Portnoy. Or is it the other way around?
His rookie season wasn’t the year he took them to the AFCCG. His rookie season with Arians, he lost to the Ravens in the Wildcard round. 2nd playoff run was his comeback against the Chiefs, then Deflategate in Jan of 2015 (‘14 season)
Lads, it's not that complicated.   For starters he is clearly a very rounded person and sees beyond football. So he chose life outside of football including family and other activities. The guy is set up for life financially. I'm surprised more "high achievers" don't do this i.e. get out at the top when they've made their money and spend rest of their lives enjoying themselves and family.
I'm no expert or anything... but didn't luck lose to the ravens in the wildcard his rookie season?
Another takeaway is Luck married his wife while Tom Brady married football. Luck's wife probably told him something along the lines of "our marriage or football" and Luck retired. Gisele told Brady "our marriage or football" and Brady was like "bye Felicia." Yes, that makes Brady an a$$h0le on the field and in his family.
Money not everything…if it means you gotta give up all your time(freedom), then it ain’t worth it..idc the dollar amount!
Andrew Luck could have been at the top in all stat categories if he didn't retire early. He was a great QB and the kind of guy you root for (unless he's playing your team) 😄
We need a 30for30
Weird how McAfee acts as if reading comprehension is truly that difficult. He must have ADHD or something.
Wish you could get him on the show
From one father to another, GOOD JOB ANDREW!
He said he wanted to stay safe, and choose family and life over football when he retired
That's great. But come to that conclusion after the season, not right before the start of the next regular season.
this is what worries me about Josh Allen.   i know his injuries have been when in the pocket so far,  but the hits he does take,   dishes out,  on his runs.   eventually,  the luck will run out.   Lucks injuries piled up,  we,  football fans,  lost a generational QB,  that was fun to watch.  happy for Luck,  gotta make the right decision for yourself and your family first and foremost.  wish him the best.  the problem with not putting everything towards football,  or something else is,  there is always somebody else willing to,  and you will feel like youre being outworked and falling behind.   Luck needing to give more time to things outside of football,  thats great,  but competitors like him and others know that if they dont give everything,  its probably not going to work.  so he chose to just stop.   thats fine.  he chose something more important too him.    imagine people are jealous of him being able to walk away,  knowing that they have to keep grinding it out in the rat race.   keep in mind,  when youre set for life financially,  this kind of decision is much much much easier to make.   99% of the world cant make this kind decision.
There's no right answer is what he's saying ..but would you give everything to be the best? Its the choice
(A much more accurate synopsis of the article) Ok so he was not as concerned about just being a husband and father (his oldest daughter wasn’t born until after he retired in 2019). Andrew talks in the article about how he changed everything about himself to try and be Peyton Manning in control of everything. To the point he takes the team out to dinner he orders for everyone, he realizes that he has to have enough control to effect outcomes (which made him a great QB), he became strict with his life that he started to apply that to his personal relationships outside of football. Once he was injured, he wouldn’t tell people about it and would push himself beyond that point because it’s what he was always told he had to do. So when they piled up and he hurts his shoulder and he wasn’t talking to anybody and just was frustrated that he wasn’t making progress and now he had these personality traits his wife told him something has got to change or else this isn’t going to work for me anymore. He goes to Holland works with an organization that heals athletes injuries and helps them work through things mentally. He comes back plays in 2019 has a comeback player of the year performance while starting to ask himself is this all he is. His wife was ready to support him to continue playing but he text he and told her that he thinks he’s done, she was pregnant at the time, and literally had to get off the phone because she was about to do a live news segment. Andrew Luck came to the conclusion because he never knew anything else other than being a QB and once he realized that he started questioning everything else about himself and whether these things were his actual personality or if it was the personality he was trained to have because of his football talent and ability.
As a Pac-12 fan I watched Luck play in college. He would dismantle my teams every year. I knew he would be something special. As a Chiefs fan he ruined many playoff hopes for my team. That being said he was a great quarterback and it took a great man to make the decision he did. Too many men today put their families second to their careers and the cycle of damage continues.
Glad he retired!
Lmao women have so much power over men this dude really retired because his wife was unhappy bruh
Still a quitter
Andrew Luck had GOAT potential. All around great guy. Glad hes happy after stepping away
I can read it but not comprehend it as I’m reading it
Report the real news.. lucks dad was CEO of xfl at the time... conflict of interest is the real reason .. stop the bs
As a Titans fan I was so relieved when Andrew Luck retired. Because if he didn't he would still be kicking our asses till this day!
AQ saying "It's 4 months, suck it up."  Epitomizes the toxic type of thinking Andrew was dealing with.  I guarantee that thought (sucking it up) was in the forefront of his mind every day. And it seems to be something he has battled with ever since retiring ('Should I have just sucked it up and told her to suck it up?')  As someone who's life was football, 24/7/365 for 32 years, I completely understand. I made the choice to retire from college coaching to be a more present father to my young kids. I miss football every July-December. But I every time I'm able to pick up the kids and drive by practice as I take them o the park/hiking/their own practice, I'm thankful I made the choice to put my family first instead of telling them to, "Suck it up, it's only 4-6 months a year."
Unless I'm misunderstanding Pat we didn't go to the AFC championship in Lucks rookie year. We lost to the ravens in the first round and they ended up playing the Patriots in the AFC championship and eventually winning the Super Bowl. Deflate gate happened in 2015 which was Lucks 3rd season
How can you be on the damn team and think we went to the AFC championship in lucks rookie year
Sooo he gave up lmao… EVERYONE gets hit in the NFL.. grow up
Let's get Andrew Luck on the show!
I respect him, because he chose the love for his family over the love for football!
Not sure why they are asking why he chose his wife over football.  Football is only this small portion of his life.  It's not about her accomplishments nor his accomplishments.  It's about prioritizing his relationships over his accomplishments.
bravo on Pat ending that discussion when he did and the way he did it.  the convo was starting to ramble but more importantly guys were gonna start saying stuff they probably shouldn't about things that no other human should be judging another human on.  Good move Pat, well played.
If that psychiatrist is in Indy, they may want to change their name, get some plastic surgery, and move to Bolivia.
Not everyone chooses 300lb dudes over supermodels!
I just hope Andrew Luck hasn't regretted his decision to retire because he had a lot of football left if he wanted to continue to play. He was a really good quarterback when he wasn't being crucified by the defense. He could have been a hall of famer.
AQ was speaking for all of us when he started asking questions about Lucks wife. Like how do you want to live your dream when asking your husband to give up his dream? Luck is the king of the simps
AQ with the dumbest take ever on that you can be a father later. Lol. Great father material right there.
Sounds like he was looking for justification to not do what was expected of him and follow his own path. Totally unnecessary. Got to follow your own path.
Andrew Luck didn't make it to the AFC Championship Game his rookie year. He went 0-1 his rookie year in the playoffs. His second season, he went 1-1. He went to the AFC Championship Game his third season in the NFL.
There's a podcast of this article on ESPN Daily.  Its Luck and the writer of the article breaking down their interviews.
Sounds like his wife made the decision for him.
Uggh… big article… “words”… smart  Way to deconstruct the “dumb athlete” trope
Read the article, 90% window dressing, 5% devil’s advocating 5% actual information.
Few good take aways from reading the article and listening to pat and aq. 1. Glad he's happy. 2. Like AQ said, timing was bad and money was big, suck it up and finish the last 6 months. 3. He wasn't nearly a big enough of an asshole. 4. Not talked about but he took so many self inflicted hits on the field that he didn't need to take that Manning and Brady and even Mahomes don't take. 5. That article took me 45min to read and was horrible, IN MY OPINION. I'm sure some people liked it's style but to me it sucked. 6. It really seemed like the injuries made him a person he didn't want to be and without them he could have been a good dad, husband AND qb. 7. Personally I just don't think he knew how to be a good qb in the league without risking his body on every play. 8. He was so good with money that money was not an issue when retiring.
I hope he has no regrets and doesn't wake up at 50 regretting his choices. That kind of regret can eat you up. Happy for him, if he indeed is confident in his choice and at peace. If not and he was somehow coerced into it by others in his life, he should return while he still can.
I don't feel he needed to explain a damn thing! We all know Grigson absolutely ignored the O-line issues and Luck was beaten up constantly. It's a testament to just how good he was at being mobile and able to make plays behind a garbage offensive line and limited weapons. I miss him as Colts QB1, but I'm ecstatic that he chose family life over football! Good for him!!
I can only imagine how the constant injury - rehab cycle can wear on a player, especially when some of those injuries are pretty severe. Spending so much of your time in pain and worrying that you won't be able to get back to where you were prior to the injury. The toll it takes, when recovery from an injury doesn't progress as quickly as you'd hoped, causing you to fear that it could be career-ending. It's no surprise that trying to keep those internal conflicts to themself could lead to them being difficult to deal with at home. I'm just glad he's enjoying life, now.
I read the article tbh it was freaking long and it did drift at times overall happy for Luck!!
Imagine that, a spoiled rich kids throws way literally millions. What happens if his dad's not loaded and he's not in line to inherit millions? A rich kid quits, someone without perseveres.
Of course the meat head guy is like “ suck it up”.
So he loved his wife more than the game, that’s awesome
ESPN IS TRASH GONE DOWN THE TOILET !!
Unless your identity is found in God, it will only be found in your culture and the people around you. You have to achieve it in the culture, but you simply receive it from Jesus.
Andrew Luck would've been the only quarterback in the same class as Mahomes. Josh Allen is a monster tho so I ain't mad we got that instead but he ain't on that Luck level
Went on a run until you played a team with deflated footballs.???? Bro how many points does that cover for? You lost by 5 touchdowns
How is this new info?  It’s exactly the same thing he said right after retiring lol
Growing up as a colts fan I never thought it’d ever be the same after Peyton left .. then we got blessed with Luck hate to see how it all unfolded but glad he’s at peace
“There’s plenty of time for that”   AQ’s wife might have some words lol
Imagine, a couple who are both potential legends in their own rights, decide to give it up for the "simple life" – even though their life is now filled with travel, college, architecture, extreme skiing, and non-simple things. Pretty wild that they couldn't maximize their youth & skills and have kids & family later in life.
FCK THE PATS!!
Let down we didn't get a round of applause for Pat's fine reading skills.
But here is the problem. They have a half year vacation! They only really work 5 months out of the year. They have 6 months off season with family and half the season at home.
Geez man. Take a breath and get to the point.
Whatever he made enough money to start a new life with his now wife n kid . That’s not n easy decision but he did what’s best for his family hats off hood man
Brady is getting divorced but Luck decided to put his family first. Who is the real man?
Why did they say it’s not like Tom Brady? It’s probably the same for him too, I mean he’s getting a divorce. There’s a good chance it’s related to him playing football.
Why did Luck retire early? Its really quite simple.  He comes from money. So he never needed the money. *THE END*
Pat has his years mixed up we went to the AFC Championship in 2014 in lucks rookie year we lost to the ravens in the first round and every year after 2012 we went a round farther. Pat was on these teams how he forgets this blows my mind
Bet he woulda rather played baseball
Gisele is jealous of Luck’s wife. The Michael jordan of making her husband bend to her will.   She sounds lovely.
Every time colts lose now its because the fans booed luck lol.
Luck basically meant--'After football and the agony, then what? I will have 40 yrs of life yet and then taking pain meds for 40 years constantly, is it worth it?'  If you feel like $hit everyday, have to sit in certain position just to cope, how is $200 million going make me physically pain free?  Health, health, health....we all are cocky and are invincible until we don't have it anymore. Pay attention to your health and have good friends and you will make it through just fine.
Very interesting response from AQ here... says a lot without saying much
Dude made his money and then got out while the getting was good to pursue a normal life. I respect that.
Luck wins the Superbowl is Las Vegas 😄 🤣 😂 😆 😄 🤣 😂 😆
The difference between $150MM and $300MM in terms of happiness?  No difference at all.
Pat, you guys lost to the Ravens in Baltimore in Andrew’s rookie season. Somebody help the host haha
Andrew Luck would be a great coach if he wanted to get back in the game after his kids grow up.
I worked at the CCB when Luck and his wife came in to get their marriage certificate; she seemed pretty snobby and demanding.
In short, he made enough money to retire off his wife's salary.
That "tough it out" comment fucks with me because this dude had more injuries than anyone and we see what CTE is doing to people. What's so bad about a millionaire choosing his family? And the comment "there's plenty of time for that later" in regards to being a father, you can't make up for being an absent parent. It will never be the same for your children.
Luck had some of the worst concussion hits I've seen. He did the right thing.
Luck was a good quarterback and I respect his decision to walk away.   But no way would I consider him elite. Let’s also not act like the afc south wasn’t the worst division for years during his time pretty much guaranteeing 5-6 division wins. He also walked away at the worst time. He deserved to get boo’d by the fans at the timing which he hung it up.   Glad he’s doing alright now though and wish him nothing but the best.
Andrew Luck made me root for Indy when they played. Dude was magic on the field. It’s sucks the organization set him up for failure pretty much. I’m glad he’s at peace with retirement.
His timing to retire was brutal on the Colts. He should've done it prior to the draft.
Pay you guys made the AFC Championship in 2014. Lucks 3rd season. Not his rookie year.
I don't know why any of these players get married til their career is over
Man I love Pat
luck is so overrated.
Was not his rookie  year it was his 3 rd year.  In 2014.    By the way Seth Wickersham has been dead on on everyone
Sounds like a "therapist" got into his head. Sad.
Sometimes your Luck runs out 🤣🤣🤣
You either got it, and give it your all Or your on your way out
I hate what the colts did to Andrew.
Pat doesn’t know his team haha. Lucks rookie season they lost to Baltimore in Baltimore in the wild card. The AFC championship loss was his second year
With deflated footballs that were found before halftime made the game very close. Regular psi footballs are played with in the 2nd half and the colts get blown tf out 45-17
If he was poor they would of told him to come back for test in a month if that crazy 🌎
wonder what showed his intelligence  by retiring early  and not becoming a triple or a vegetable  because  Colts owner and management would not get him an offensive line to protect him  he made the right decision go home take care of yourself and his family  the young man can do whatever he wants to do
Colts actually lost to the Ravens in the Wild Card round, Andrew's rookie year...but he was a great QB from year 1, no doubt
Thank you Andrew for your time as a Colt. Best wishes to him and his family. One of my favorite Colt players.
Bears fan here. This could happen to Justin Fields if front office doesn't do something quick. Look at RG III
For my young guys out there watching this. Understand that when a woman wants you she will never give you an ultimatum.  Leo decaprio doesn’t get ultimatums.  Neither does chris hemsworth, or Idris Elba, or any man that is at the top of the top.  McAfee said it himself she is a award winning gymnast and Stanford Grad.  Gymnasts are crazy competitive.  She most likely hates that she has a move named after her yet no one knows who she is.  She probably hates that Luck made insane amounts of money to do what he loved when gymnasts have to get second jobs.  Then the cherry on top of her anger had to be that Luck is the nicest guy.  I bet he probably apologizes for being awesome.  There is nothing wrong with walking away so that you can be there more for your kids but to do it to please a woman who probably doesn’t appreciate you is bs.  Men that have higher callings don’t have time to be at every soccer game, or every spelling bee, or every pta.  If they did there would be no one to keep the economy running.  Don’t believe the hype.
The Lucky horseshoe
6:43 hell yeah Conor 🇨🇿 I see you're a Bruins fan. Zacha, Pastrňák, Krejčí. You've got a bunch of fans over here. I'm glad you know about our little country the size of California. However, Andrew's wife was a great gymnast.
OMG, are you still bellyaching about the PSI of frozen footballs?
140 million dollar bust!
I feel like I am reading about an ex girlfriend that didn't end well but I still respect a lot and miss... hard to even listen to this about him 😂
U didn't go to afc championship game in andrew lucks rookie year. Baltimore beat you first round in the playoffs and ended up winning superbowl in Ray Lewis last year. You went to afc championship game andrew lucks 2nd year
Ideal gas law. Look it up!
Also somebody need to tell Wickersham that there is no trout in indiana
Jesus, I don’t have the patience to make it through this terribly written story. I was out at the mention of an iceberg.
Is he talking about Josh Allen
" andrew luck ski patrol just grabbing you and throwing u over his shoulder" reminds me of the movie "Harold and Kumar" when the redneck stuffs that deer into a bag like it's a pillow hahaha
So his Wife taking a beating for this I bet. Just like he was off the field.   I guess there’s more to life then Football and those two guys know it. They didn’t say it but they know it.
Finally explaining? I'm pretty sure he said this very thing in his retirement speech at the press conference lol
I had always hoped that luck would have come to a darker shade of blue after Brady retired. But he ran his course and Brady is still playing. But just not for my team anymore. I always felt like luck would have had great success with my patriots. But the world will never know.
Good for you Andrew. You did the right thing.
.... The wife lol
Deflated footballs what a whiner PAT no respect for you!!
I wish a person would make me choose anything. Especially if I love it that's crazy so basically what I got from all this was his shawty wanted him 2 be a stay at home dad while she out making all the paper and decisions. Yea rd
If it wasn't already obvious... none of the greats are born great... they all have to make incredible sacrifices to attain the greatest level... enjoy it while it lasts every single one of these great athletes are HUMAN and they have a very small window to be the best. There is always someone coming to take it... thats the name of the game.
Imo if the colts could have protected him , and he could have stayed relatively injury free who knows ... he chose football he was great and had the talent to become one of the all time greats , he got the sh---t kicked out of him enough to think ...I'm done..I have a family I'm choosing them - but ....again what if he was injury free would he have made that same decision?....
They definitely didn't go to afc championship that season. Rookie season for Andrew luck they lose in wildcard to ravens
Thats a great point about identity after retirement even outside the football world an interesting statistic that relates to it is that union plumbers on average die within 10 years of retirement even with great medical and retirement pay the leading causes are alcoholism and suicide i think these mental issues are a huge problem facing everyone in America and the sports world is just a microcosm of this put on display
Were the footballs deflated in the second half?
The guy speaks like Sam Adams!! Andrew Luck for Governor!!
Luck is more of a man than anyone on this show will ever be
Speak the truth.......
Sounds like he was a simp! Congrats to him anyways, few years in the NFL, rich for life!
Luck was great. I respect his decision, and its just crazy to be added to the list of athletes of “what could have been” due to the insane talent.
he didn't want to be Junior Seau. Seems pretty straight forward. He was getting LIT UP every single game. He had a bag, and his wife makes great money too. Congrats to Andrew for cashing in and knowing when enough is enough. I agree with Pat's take on him being too nice. Maybe Andrew knew that about himself and decided he needed to remove himself from that situation.
I hope the pats go after u for defamation after saying that, that deflated football story was fabricated by 2 pats haters th lose every year to Brady... not only was it proven false but also Blount running for almost 200 yards  has nothing to do with a football psi, tackle in the rain biotch
This experience is happening everywhere, not allowing for family relationships to develop cause the talent gets squeezed for every drop. I wish we could just live and enjoy the world
Without a doubt, in my mind, Luck made the correct choice in walking away. Life is a beautiful thing if you live it in an appreciable way, and  tomorrow is never promised. There is more to life than football and waking up in pain every Monday morning.
Andrew Luck also performed in a tough era of college football. He seems like an amazing dude highly intelligent and with a conscience of an angel.
Luck's rookie year they lost to the Ravens
Luck retired because Pat kept calling him “gieco, the caveman dude”
ty read it, because he has a really big brain. connor attempted to read it.  damn..
Maybe it’s me but from this vid the wife wanted to wear the pants 👖, and told him it’s “stay home with the kids while I pursue my career or it’s over”
Sounds like this man had his morals in line.  Good father better Christian
19 minutes of "I don't know what the articles actually said". smh
You might need to be an asshole to win at the ultimate level, but I really don't think so.  And even if it's true, is it worth it?  Tom Brady has a bunch of super bowl rings, but now is without a wedding ring because of what honestly looks like an addiction from the outside.   Luck made the right choice if it saved his marriage and his mental health.  Sad to lose a talent in the game, but the game should teach you how to be a better human, and it did for Luck.  Can't say that for Brady.
Good it's behind a pay wall and coded or people might start blaming his wife 😂
everything that was said and thought of at the end of this video were kinda my thoughts from the beginning tbh
I know Pat love Chuck Pagano but I have to say he’s a terrible head coach. It’s not a coincidence that they made the AFC Finals with Bruce Arians then when Chuck came back they s*cked d*ck. He was a terrible in game decision maker, terrible clock management coach. Just bad.
Ty didn't tell pat the best parts of the article. The part about him and rich talking everyday about the colts and the game and how he sent an sos. And now luck is thinking about coaching high-school while being a history teacher
Luck mastered the "hospital pass".  Luck and the Colts were not a great match.
The dude is a weirdo.
How does Pat not know that the Colts didn't go to the AFC Title game in 2012 lol?  That was 2014.....Luck's 3rd season.  Pat was on the damn teams.
Andrew chose his life and long term health over football. It was the right choice imo.
What is Pat McAfee talking about? Andrew Luck & Chuck Pagano did *_NOT_* make the AFC Championship Game in their mutual first seasons together. The Leukemia part is correct. However, their year ended in Baltimore — coincidentally enough for the aforementioned Pagano, who was a former Ravens Secondary Coach & Defensive Coordinator from 2008–2011 — during the Wild Card Round, 24–9. The Ravens went on to win Super Bowl XLVII. Chuck, Luck & Co. made it to the AFC Championship Game two years later (2014-2015 regular season/postseason).
earlier tin the year marquise goodwin commented on how bad he felt about missing the birth and death of multiple kids. i dont blame luck and wish him all the best. i hope he can find the answers hes looking for.
Andrew luck was in his 3rd year when went to the afc championship. He went to the wildcard as a rookie
Pat trash, no one had deflated footballs and they ran the ball down your throat.
Words are spells! Every football coach says get your degree so if you get hurt, you have your degree. And this is a Stanford degree. Why's this so hard?
Idk she sounded pretty selfish and Luck sounds like a yes man
Didn't go to the championship game his rookie year tho, pat remembers it wrong. They lost to the ravens his first playoff game as a rookie. Championship game was his 3rd season
Take away the money from these qb’s and see where the wives go.
Come on pat you are better then that . How do you not know when y’all I went to the AFC championship game with luck? Or you just tryin to make Andrew look better then he was . Y’all didn’t make to the AFC championship game his rookie year smh . Y’all went 2014 year not 2012 .
Andrew Luck is Da Man!!! Am not a Colts fan, but Dude was an Amazing Player!! I was shocked when the news broke of his retirement, at te same time, I admired home even more. Having heard this discussion, has only cemented that admiration!!  Just Sayin
Life is about sacrifices and if you have to sacrifice what you love for your health and family your a hero its not easy to do.
So a therpist told him to Retire   andrew luck garbage he turn his back to his fans and teamates
Bro gave up his dream for a woman who will probably divorce him at some point 🤦
What Andrew can’t say is that the NFL is scripted in the post season, why put your long term health at risk in that environment? Thanks to his families wealth and education, he doesn’t need the money. He played to win.
I feel like no doubt Andrew luck is gunna come back to football somehow broadcasting scouting coaching he left the game but he still has that fire fs
I will always see him as a quitter. The reason why he left is fine. But the way he went about it, very unprofessional, very immature. He quit one week before the season started. He let players, coaches, management, ownership, a city, a state down.  If he would've done this in February, March, April like the other classy players do, I would've considered it a retirement.  But to quit one week before, nope, no class.  No player wants to go through summer camp, and for him to go and act like he was riding with the team during that summer, very classless.
“Ty read it, because he has a very big brain. Conor attempted to read it.”    😂
It's pathetic as an athlete that they  wine about deflated balls. The fact is you got beat. Focus on the play . Unfortunately you couldn't.  You failed to stop the other team . Fact!
Luck didn’t make it to the AFC championship as a rookie
He reduced it to a common basic concept........is the cost worth the benefit? It's ain't rocket science.
I will continue to celebrate everything bad that happens to the Colts for what they did to Andrew Luck.
Luck's wife works for NASA now. Maybe a future astronaut.
No offense to the Pat Mcafee show but he’s got the seasons wrong. The season of ChuckStrong was not the year as Deflate Gate.
He didn’t want to end up like Brady
What I got from the artificle is that the biggest reason why he got so conflicted in the first place is that he had to change his persona to fit the nfl. In college he was a successful QB just by being one of the guys, but that didn't work in the NFL. So he had to construct an NFL-QB persona that would be more of dickhead leader than he felt comfortable with. This led to a tear in his life where he couldn't find regular Andy Luck anymore, just QB Andy Luck.
that first quote is awful writing masquerading as good writing. someone who thinks they are a better writer than they are.
Woman is running his damn life smh
Luck is likely erudite or borderline erudite ( certainly introspective too) Not typical athletic lunk head   Shows how he did not find many bonds and felt alone  And he was so prudent and reflective…  Not a single reason not to think favorable of him as a man
Andrew Luck grew up a lot differently than most football players. Extremely intelligent, extremely cultured. His road to the NFL was well earned yet I honestly believe he grew tired of the pain, the pills/the injections, the rah-rah Neanderthal mentality of the NFL locker room. He was a terrific athlete but he wasn’t a football PLAYER. He got out before he lost his body to daily medicine. He got out before he lost his marbles. Like the Steven Miller song, “Take the money and run.”
Dude falling apart health wise and he didn’t have that needing to define him🤷🏻‍♂️ don’t need the article anyone with a fully functioning brain and eyes knew why
deflated footballs ... lol ... u got murdered that game. in the 2nd half with regular balls they scored even more points :D
Was McAfee serious about the "deflated footballs".  Doesn't everyone know that was a joke by now? The Netflix documentary, 1st grade science on air pressure and the cold, etc. It was a Goodell scam.
That article you read was so fkn lame. I need therapy please help i feel like I can’t live. Wowzer . Thats it I’m fkn woke
With deflated footballs 😂 Pat is still in denial!
Without even reading the article we already know why he retired. The Colts have NO CLUE on how to draft,  or hire free agents or trade and create an O-line. You all can't protect a QB. It's the same thing every single year and it was the same with Manning. Why would someone want to play that position for that team? It's damn near a death sentence.
Nah, Pat, that writer sucks. Writes like a highschooler trying to make the minimum word count
rookie luck didnt go to afc championship it was the 3rd year in 2014, am i missing something
Watching Luck play always felt he did not have the competitive fire of other great QBs have. He was ultimately distracted by his off-field interests.  I feel the NFL, is basically akin to the military, if they wanted you to have a wife and family they would have issued you one.
Pat we love you, but the deflategate nonsense needs to stop. I hate the patriots too but that was a simple ass beating.
Lucks rookie year we lost in the wild card. 2nd year was a 2nd round loss to the pats. 3rd year was afc championship.
If Andrew Luck was drafted by the Seahawks, he would have 3 rings by now.
The reason he left is that the colts couldn't protect him, I'm not sure why they write it all elaborate and complicated. He said he didn't see the point of having all that talent and getting his ass beat for nothing, the colts did nothing with him. Wasted his career. If he ended up in a better team, won some championships he would had been much happier.
Yeah I don’t buy it lasting, you’re the best upcoming QB and you quit cause your wife gives ultimatum? It won’t last
Come back to WWE!!!!
Andrew luck was a turnover machine he had talent tho
Well to be fair, they will let anybody who can afford it into Standford. Really smart people have gone to, and taught at Standford. That doesn't mean everyone who went to Stanford is a genius, a lot of them are just rich lol
I wish the Colts--and everybody--would learn the lesson about protecting a valuable asset. He might still be playing if he had been adequately protected, but probably not. They drafted Manning AFTER they had bookend OTs in the first two rounds the year before. As much as I miss Luck (and I have been in football depression the past few years), I'd never wish him back on the team for his own sake. Andrew Luck leading a team I have followed for 50 years would give me much joy, but it would cost him everything and cost me nothing. Not worth it. I'm happy to be frustrated on Sundays and depressed Mondays if you can pick up your kids and grandkids and go jogging for fun when you're my age. Enjoy your life and family, dude. And thanks for the memories.
This is all good and well, I’m glad Luck chose what was best for him and his family….. BUT!! Let’s not forget this is a professional league…. And it doesn’t take a scientist to figure out the fact that the Colts QB position has been fucked for the past 4-5 years all because we couldn’t have gotten a heads up.
Its quite clear after reading the article that Luck dropped football because his wife nagged him. Its very possible to balance football and regular life making hundreds of millions of dollars. There are families out there where the father has to work 10+ hours a day and barely gets to see his kids or wife. But guess what, he does so so he can provide for his family. We are dealing with millionaires and their needs. She made him drop his passion for his family. Any half way decent person would do that. But the fact that you have to force your significant other to drop what they love most and make them chose between that and family (when you can do both) is ridiculous.
Feel sorry for Andrew and all the mental gymnastics he had to go through. Bottom line, he had a gift to give to humanity that he could reach millions of people with. That’s what you focus on.
"why does he have to write it this way?"..."Because he's a writer" Genius answer.
Deflated footballs, you lost by 40 pts!!! It wasn't even close!!!
can playing football hurt you? wow what a surprise, isn't it like playing ping pong? what a loser
Football should never be more important than your loved ones. Who cares if you're thought of a great player if your whole personal life falls apart and you spend the rest of your life regretting that. I'm sorry but people like Tom Brady are idiots
What is with these wives not understanding why they get to live so luxuriously? Someone in the family needs to work, and that takes a a time commitment. It's like they have gotten so used to just being handed $1 million per year while not working that they forget where money even comes from. Forcing these men to quit a career they've always dreamed about just because your heads in the clouds. Respect to Andrew though
The only thing I wanted for Andrew was to have won a super bowl. He deserved to have that but he also deserves to live his life the way he wants. Love that guy and miss him
Very interesting article minus the stupid dumbass cheap shots at the patriots. Andrew luck seems like a very smart athletically gifted man. Tom brady is twice the man that luck is, and that's not a shot at luck. I don't like how this vanilla ice lookin dude takes a shot at brady with the deflated football's. That crap was way overblown!! TB 12
AQ is like, what do I know? I’m from the Moon
As soon as i hear an article is behind a paywall i switch off and don't care
The truth was / is , he just wasn’t all in on football and when you are not all in you are out at that level. In short he quit . He can say that he was all in  but the evidence is he was too much in his own head and had other interests ( skiing/snowmobile accident ) and while it is his life and he can live it how he chooses to make himself and family happy he also f@@@ed over his teammates and his team .
My read of the article was that he felt compelled by the world around him to dedicate himself to being 'the quarterback' and he used layers of self deception to build a character/model of what he thought would bring him success. When things like injuries attacked the shell of lies he built around his 'qb1' persona, it caused him mental anguish because it caused conflict into the character he built that was outside of his direct control. Because of his mental smarts, he was supremely confident that he could control all the aspects of his life to let him be successful, and once he lost the measure of that false control it caused a crisis. He had built a false identity and when confronted with all of that self deception he realized what he was doing to those around him (like his gf/wife) and had to make a choice. He knew that the lure of playing football would be like a drug that tempted him into all of those lies and decided the only way to save himself from self destruction was to remove himself from that world. Part of the identity he is building, outside of football, is one of a father, husband, and now student. He has to unlearn the hyper focused methods he used to be a success in football and try to understand that he needs to make the choice of what he wants to be in a manner that is clear. So much of his life was affected by external perceptions and demands that it is difficult for him to not see those influences in all of his choices....he's trying to build up true self confidence so he can find purpose in life free from the strings of unwanted external influence.  Not sure if that's more clear than the article or not. It's at least shorter.
Amazing QB. Enjoyed his Ameritrade commercials. " want a little Luck?" Handing out whiskers from his beard!
I don’t know how lucky we were to witness Luck play the game of football. He was and still is a rare talent, brilliant football mind and a teammate that people would go to war for. I appreciated every year he played the game.   As a Ravens fan, I tip my hat to you Luck.
Who cares. Colts suck. Colts is to this show is what cowboys are to espn. Say sum..
His kid is probably going to show up to school and say his/her dad is Andrew luck just as their father with no intention. There will be one fan who knows the name who will probably shock their world with how good their was dad
If you knew why he retired than you would’ve been knew this, and I’ll forever respect that decision as a die hard Colts fan. Yes it sucks but life over football
Tom Body:😮
He took an absolute beating when he played
He got whooped on the field and retired early and quit on the whole city because he took too much damage large in part because of a terrible GM. Nothing more nothing less. Y’all acting like he was a football hero.. he’s not.
Luck always had the weight of greatness. The family, the genes, the pick, and the pressure of it all. His rookie year with all the issues, makes conference championship.  And seemed destined for excellence. Yet, he never got past that point. He never crossed that point of his rookie year and was always taking the hits and rehab, play, hurt, rehab.  And when it leads somewhere you can call the sacrifices worth it. Brady comparisons for example. Brady got 3 rings right away. While luck never got that support.  His family grew distant and luck always said he lost his love of football. That is what this quote is about. He tore him up leaving the sport he was made to play and was so good at. Remember the boos and the media calling him soft.   But he is at peace and happy. He found the happyness not woth football but with family when football was his life for so long with little room for anything else. Now it is family and next to no football and he is at peace.
So smart yet he looks like a Neanderthal
not taking brain damage is a big motivator.
Almost forgot Pat almost showed up Andrew's 3rd arm
He’ll always be better than TB12 in my mind for making the right decision for his family.
Pat’s boy is a horrible reader.  Luck isn’t talking about choosing a life with football or a life with his wife.  He’s talking about the price being paid for being a franchise QB for a decade and dealing with the effects of those hits and living a life after.  Luck made the same decision that Calvin Johnson made, and I’m pretty sure Calvin Johnson’s decision impacted him.  There’s a price to paid for stardom in the NFL.  Pardon the pun, but luckily for Luck, his family was well off, and his contract helped, so that he could make the decision he made.  Good for him.
Chuck Pagano deserves another HC job. I hope he comes to Denver as the new HC in the offseason. He’s also from Boulder.
One of the things that bothered me was some of the hits Luck had to take in order to put passes in certain windows. I think at some point he was the most hit QB for almost 2 years straight. That takes a toll on you, then not to mention the injuries piling up, the rehab just kept piling on him. By the time the Colts put a decent enough line in front of him, the damage had been done. It was too late.   Luck's retirement is on two people, Grigs on and Irsay. Mostly Irsay. He saw the punishment Luck took week in and out, Grigson in all of his wisdom saw the same thing, yet sat on his hands for years.   Imagine having TWO generational QBs in a span of 20 years, and having 1 ring to show for it, AND having Tom Brady outlast them both.
The ironically named Andrew Luck
he should run for office
I think we all forgot how good he actually could have been..
Cowboys fan here, and I wasn't shocked he retired. He was getting punished. Luck was what everyone hopes Josh Allen will be. Helluva QB.
Ok deflated footballs was a scam lol
Andrew set the franchise back 15-20 years.  Sigh.
Jesus, so basically because of injuries like we new
Nobody talks about but being honesy andrew was on his way to being one of the GOAT QB .. the LAST true great pocket passer
He would look good in a 49er jersey.
Wait. You guys can't read?
The subject of this video should be: Andrew Luck still has no clue why he retired
He didn't love the game. If you don't love the game get out before you get hurt.
I just hope he doesn’t wake up one day and realize this woman has kept him from doing what he wanted to do. I’ve seen that too. Some women just cannot handle everything not being about them. Maybe I’m an asshole for even saying that.
Pat should have had an achievement pop up in real life after reading that whole thing without a single error.
The entire article on Luck was a really good read. I really appreciated that piece to start my day, glad to know Luck is living a life he wants to live.  For Pat and others: Luck fell out of love with the game. He lost his ability to enjoy living as he was going through the constant cycle of getting injured, recovery, and injury again. When guys identity was centered around being a QB, he felt trapped.  He hated retiring, but he knew it was the right thing to do. Now he's living the most of what he has.
It took him 3 years to say that simple reason? Nobody would have been angry about that reason. Andrew Luck seems like a very strange, timid man
If you're also struggling to understand the paragraph they read, here's my easy read version:   Luck was searching for "clarity", some sort of definitive answer as to whether or not he should continue playing. He tried to think through what it would be like to retire and what it would be like to keep playing ("told himself stories") hoping this would give him the answer. But what he learned in therapy is that you don't have to be certain about your choice in order to make a decision, because there was no way for him to know what the right choice is, even after you make it. While this didn't help him make a choice one way or another, it helped him come to terms with the decision that he ultimately made.
Andrew Luck is the biggest pu$$y of all time in the NFL, end of story.  “I got hit a lot and I got paid, so I quit on my team”. Pat is being so overly nice because he’s a franchise guy, but name a top 5 QB who quit in his absolute prime…. You cant.  Undoubtably a soft athlete and scouting heavily misjudged his dedication.
Hated wasting a 1st pick on him first year I ever played fantasy football 😑😑😑
I'm from Iowa and im a hawkeye fan
Andrew Luck passed up hundreds of millions of dollars so his wife could be a TV producer oh lord
I know this is nit picky, but Luck wasn’t a rookie when he went to the AFC championship game. It was year 3.
That 2012 NFL Draft with Luck and RG3 will always be such a wild what if for years to come. Both were so heralded leading to the draft, obviously nobody more than Luck. And then both of them played right away and turned their teams around. Luck struggled a bit more that first year but then had the amazing playoffs. RG3 tore it up thag first year. Luck obviously turned out to be more successful and will be the biggest what if considering he left the game young and on top. But RG3 is always a big what if for me too. He tore it up right away but then had the injury issues and disagreements with his coach. He got scared to play the way he had been that was succeeding and didn’t return to thag form. And further injuries obviously ended his career as a starter. But I’ll always wonder if he hadn’t had the injury issue, and not changed his playing style, would he have been good for some more years to come? Kinda wild they both guys played well in the league but neither turned out to be what was hoped because injuries took it from us. Luck more so since he had clearly shown he was a top QB of the league.
"Ty read it, he has a big brain. Conner attempted to read it" 🤣🤣
Luck’s body was getting ruined. Ended spending more time rehabbing than playing so he called it.
Forget having mannings genetics I can’t wait for lucks genetics in a quarterback
This self-satisfied, navel gazing third rate poetry is what is wrong with journalism!  The writer endeavours to be bigger than the subject he’s writing about.   Andrew Luck is a fascinating individual and deserves better service than this!
Haven’t watched the video but makes me wonder…Colts playing a senior citizen in Matt Ryan; betcha he is thinking of coming back to the colts. He’s got all the weapons.
Pat is way off here 😂 they didn’t make it to the afc championship until lucks 3rd season. Def wasn’t his rookie year
Wait, what? That end, tho. "Your job is a pain, now be quite so I can do my job." Sweep, sweep, sweep it under the rug.
I feel like preventing furthering the chance of TBI or CTE was likely a big part of this decision especially as he seems like an academic type that cares and understands the research. He also took some big hits and his mannerism of encouraging defenders imo probably made defenders hit him harder to see if they could rattle him. You have to be willing to sacrifice some level of brain health to put yourself out on that field.
Wait , Pat , deflated footballs.?.?.? Explain then to me how after half time when the new balls ( supposedly reset to proper levels) did TB12 light your d up worse. Hmmmm mmm maybe because its not about the balls being thrown but the balls in TB12's pants
Don't knock yourself too much, Pat. You were right on it. Part of the reason for choosing those words in that web was to try and communicate the confusion being felt. Luck was just teasing out all the different identifies he had and attempting to reconcile them with a sort of "string theory" that would unify everything and make it make sense. But at the end of the day, there are only the decision we make and their resulting consequences. Answers aren't right or wrong, they are just answers. Then one day we look back at them and decide if they took us where we wanted to go or not. If they did, then we made the right decisions. If not, then we made the wrong ones. But there is no way to know it until you make the decisions and then live them out to completion.
What does the guy next to Pat bring to the show.....
So....basically his career was cut short by being TOO coachable. Dang.
the air pressure wouldn't have made a difference you guys sucked and got blown out
I remember watching his last game and him getting booed off the field. I was appalled at colts fans.
Took me a while to come around. At first I was upset with Andrew. Then I realized that was selfish of me. Very happy for him. He understood what was most important. There were some great moments on the field.
Ideal gas law
Sounds like his wife turned him into a girl. You’re playing a game you love and making millions. You had time off, you could fly your family with you. Not to mentioned rules changed and you can’t hit quarterbacks. No low hits etc.  what’s the problem?
In my opinion, the mindset starts out much like Tom Brady, but at some point Luck chose his family over football. Tom Brady didn’t. It’s really just both their decision.
Bro just didn’t have the guts to drop his wife for football like Brady
In case you internet bots don’t get it yet, ITS MORE DESTRUCTIVE TO A FAMILY WHEN THE MOTHER IS CONSUMED BY WORK, as oppose to a father being consumed by work. Men are built to bury themselves in their work not the other way around far more destructive results when mother are consumed by careers.
Happy Luck is happy.
We live in a society where we are not allowed to question Woman’s ulterior motives nor are white men able to say something is wrong. Kanye was right. I know Pmac wanted to question why didn’t his wife retire with him since it’s all about family now but he held back for YouTube censorship clauses.
Smart man. Took his check, took mad hits, took another check and bounced for fam. Good for him.
You little bots on the internet can say what you want and appease to society all you I know Pmac agrees with what I’m saying he started to question why his wife said” you’re retiring ? That’s great I gotta get back to work bye” but he’s gotta bite his tongue keep it PC so you liberals don’t cancel his show off of YouTube.
Under reported is what the Matthew Stafford and his family is going through right now. Matthew Stafford is older and can't take the hits like he did in Detroit. I will not be surprised if Matthew Stafford retired after 2022 because of a Spinal Cord injury that can get worse. I'm thankful the Rams won the Super Bowl last year before all the bad things happening this year.
Andrew Luck made one of the greatest decisions a pro QB ever made. Enough already, I got other things to do.
49ers if luck comes out of retirement out of nowhere like an RKO sign him
If Andrew Luck is content with his decision, so am I. Dude knew his lane, respect. As a fan of his, I do miss watching him play. Blessings
Andrew Luck literally put his body on the line for the Colts and they almost made it all the way but it’s sad
Get rid of the patriots ball washer
The colts didn’t make the afc championship until Andrew Luck’s third year
If tom was hurt more he would of done the same thing
Finally, in the last minute, it all makes sense. Hes liberal and he married is ultra liberal woman. It came full circle and makes perfect sense
Sorry, I’m never dropping millions of dollars for the rest of my life..for a woman bitching
Colts fans will always be hurt by the Luck Retirement and ruined our chances at being a great team but there's more to life than football and I can't argue with that happy retirement Andrew
Dude that paragraph honestly felt really deep, and shows the trouble of being a either a great player or being a great father figure for your family, but I mean these guys travel for half the year to make millions and are away for half the year from there family, I can see it would take a toll on the mind. Look at jay cutler his wife divorced him because he retired and wanted to be on the farm with his kids and animals, but Brady his wife divorced him because he wanted another year of football but maybe his home life was crazy and went back to what’s comfortable for him and is his home away from home football
Your really complaint about deflated footballs still. U guys got blown out before and after the “balls” were found in the same game so there’s no excuse. Also psi drops in cold weather, common sense
I remember him taking a ton of very bad hits. Then he suddenly in pre-season, retired out of nowhere. He did the math. He had the money and was financially secure. He has a wife and family. He made the right choice.
Can we please talk about Pat’s whistle at 11:00 ? Genuinely can’t figure out if it was legit or not
These women like Giselle and Luck's wife are so rare among pro-athlete women they're high-level people WITH OR WITHOUT their NFL husband. Most NFL women, their ENTIRE personality/identity is being married to a pro-athlete, so they'd never dare tell him "I'm leaving if you don't spend more time with the family" but women like Giselle and Nicole (Luck's wife) built their own status, not marry into it.
Brady made the other choice...I wonder who's happier....
I read that he got his girlfriend's number by pretending to lose his phone and having her call it.   The man truly is a genius 😂. He had game on and off the field.
This man could’ve been a goat. But he chose his path, he’s rich, happy family and can still walk after what the colts did to him all the years he was there. Imagine Luck with they Oline they built years after he left… and what are they missing now? A QB. Oh well.
If the Bears aren't careful, what happened to the Colts can happen to them. They better protect Justin Fields.
Fellas… if I put in front of you… a successful nfl career making hundreds of millions of dollars or… a girlfriend. Which you taking?
I’m just glad I’ve gotten to watch him play in person
AQ 100% a werido
Professional football players only play really 6 months out of the year. That means they're home for quite a while. My dad was on the road for his job my whole life growing up he was never home. Andrew luck was probably home more than my dad was
The takeaway from Andrew Luck is that you shouldn't get involved romantically with somebody unless you're already established in your career it sounds like. Because he met her before he was a professional football player and started a family so immediately football was second to him. But you know Jack Nicklaus has been married for over 60 years had four kids and he seemed to make it work.
I can’t believe it's gonna be 4 years in August. I was watching Florida vs Miami back when Florida had Felipe Franks. I see a breaking news red sign on the bottom and it says he retired. I was shocked. Hope he's doing all right now.
The colts deserve to languish in winless hell for what they did to him. Call it the Andrew luck curse. No Super Bowl wins for the next 50 years.
Andrew Luck didn't make the AFC Championship until his 3rd year.
As a guy who retired a bit early, I can relate. Sacrificing your health when you can financially walk away? ... walk away. Your "real life" is not your work life. If you can ... choose family first.
this will be important story to follow up on in a few years because if she somehow manages to start making more money than him ( then tries to make him her servant as she was his during playing days) theres definitely a potentisl for him to divorce him as women tend to do 70% of the time especially so in cases where the man concedes to the woman ultimatum of me or the boys in this case me or football
So his wife made him quit football. He might be smart but gullible.
Nope, sorry. First, if you’re still blaming or even bringing up that 45-7 deflate-gate loss, you’re deep throating your weirdo owner. I liked Luck’s toughness, grit, etc. as much as any football fan. But when he quit like that, leave him in the past. Do NOT make him some folk hero. He bit the hand that fed him. He looked the gift horse in the mouth. He broke his solemn vow of making a fortune playing a violent game. It’s as simple as he woke up one day and finally admitted he doesn’t like the game enough. He didn’t have the balls. That’s fine, but he chose leaving his name in the past when it comes to football himself. When he went to speak at a Stanford halftime, sounded like a total cuck. Someone want to get him a Manti Teo style doc deal or what?
Sounds like his wife’s career seemed more important lol
He was great to watch.
Andrew Luck was never a great QB. He was just somewhere around average for an NFL QB, never top tier. He quit because he's smart. He got paid without getting CTE.
Pat, it's not you, that is crap writing, English major on too much caffeine and self-pomposity.
and thats why tom brady will always be the greatest, PSA to the young boys out there dont ever let a woman come between you and your purpose of becoming great side note ultimatum is not true love that is bondage
Pat brings up deflated footballs but funny doesn’t say anything about the 4 outta 5 colts balls that were also under PSI but the refs “ran out of time to check all the colts balls”.
Andrew was a doge sucks he had to leave the league that soon
5:44 • He's exactly right, Shannon Sharpe said it best on Undisputed one morning: "there IS NO balance to greatness." If you want to be great, you must give ALL of your life to it.
Andrew Luck was special
So what I take from this is Andrew was already rich , his wife was super successful and he had to choose do I become dad or do I keep grinding and let someone else raise our kid. His wife had chosen her career so he chose family. Which is cool I guess
If you were to tell me that Nick foles would be the second most successful qb from this loaded class I'd have made you leave. Anyone else remember the "Luck Rg3 or bust" phrase. They are the only two that didn't make it 😂. Wild to think about that
Brady sacrificed his family for the game when he had absolutely nothing left to prove on the gridiron. Luck sacrificed the game for his family (and his health) even though he had potential to be as great as Brady.
As a colts fan, he will NEVER be welcomed back. Enjoy your family Luck, you’re dead to us. Quitter.
Stop the cap about the inflated footballs. Don't use excuses for losing to the goat. The goat said no you are not the next guy. Went on to win more championships after. So to say this is ridiculous and insulting and childish and bad sportsmanship
Pat- we didn't make the AFC Championship his rookie year. We lost in the WC. Then the next year we made the divisional round. Then the next year we made the AFC Championship.
Written word designed to require in depth reflection.
If I made over 50 million I would retire in a fuckin heart beat, cte is real.
A bunch of word salad...
I agree with pat , the dude who wrote the article is a effing moron and legit deserves to b slapped , hard
Injuries and he plateaued with his development.
How did the Boston stooge have the smartest comment, atta boy!!
That photo with lucks butt was the most never level thinking Pat has ever done 😂 he was like oh shoot my bad lol +100k followers later
you guys need to read the full story. A lot talked about his wife and the way you guys talked about it, made it seem like she drove him away a lot. Partly true about their conflicts, but not enough about his injuries which was the main problem with him and how he was so focused on getting back to the game in the quickest way possible.
As a lifetime Colts fan I was shocked when Luck retired but honestly I never got mad, he had to do what's best for him and his family.
Pretty convoluted and confusing   Good word! 🤣
I bet Tom Brady is having a few second thoughts about his decision to choose foozball over his family for one more year.
Sounds like Andrew Luck's wife bullied him into retiring. What a shame
Lost all respect for this schmuck mcafee when he said they were playing against a team with deflated footballs. What a dumbass
Was addicted to pain killers
I'm glad the Cowboys throat stomped the Colts, after booing Luck off the field that day, that fanbase only should know pain
Not trying to be a dick, but no matter what she does, he as a pro NFL player, and you dated in college, married and had a kid with him. I can never imagine asking a s/o to give up on their dream for my benefit
Pat is hilarious.
As a Colts fan, I was in such shock and felt so much anger, sadness, and overall lack of understanding what had just happened. I even wanted to immediately stop being a fan of the team for good and switch to a new team just because of the anger I felt towards the organization as a whole for failing this man. This guy was out a full season, came back and won comeback player of the year and with the emergence of Shaq Leonard and Quentin Nelson it felt like the 2019 season could very well be Luck’s super bowl season. But because Grigson failed miserably in the draft and made no attempt to ever protect Luck, not only did he kill a once in a lifetime QB’s career, but also sucked the soul out of the entire fanbase who one day wanted to see Luck hoist the lombardi. Ryan Grigson I sincerely wish you the worst in life and hope you never get another GM position. Chris Ballard is the same as Grigson right now unfortunately but at least we don’t have a Luck getting destroyed out there. And to be honest, yes I still wear my Colts gear, have all my jerseys, hats, shirts, socks, you name it- Still a Colts fan but the spark I once had with Luck and Peyton is no longer there. They could get Mahomes or Allen or Hurts or any future elite QB and it wouldn’t bring back the excitement and spark I once had with Luck. Irsay and his organization killed that. Thank you guys! 😔
Yeah retiring in the middle of a preseason game isn’t great timing…
This title has my dumb ass asking “after what”?
If you listen to the Andrew Luck Athletic podcast series youll see this is partially true. But he said I promosed myself and my family i would nit put them through another rehab and he had to rehab again and decided to retire instead.
My name’s wickersham le douche
Lol I'm part of a book club but don't read.
I thought y’all lost to Baltimore in wildcard his rookie year and the next year made the afc championship
6:58 “there’re not letting everybody into Stanford.”….Ah, yes they are, you just have to be the right somebody.
You know what, I'll give Pat Mcafee credit.  At the end, the conversation was about to go somewhere it probably shouldn't from a more moral standpoint, getting into a teammate's family decision, possible blaming people for those family decisions and he stopped it.  If they would've continued, it's the drama gossip crap that gets more clicks and ratings, but he stopped it.  Good job Pat
I went to school with Seth in Alaska. It’s wickersham like sham
Not to be that guy, but he keeps saying the Colts went to the AFC championship Luck's rookie year (2012). That's not true, they lost in the 1st round that year. They went to the AFC championship in 2014.
Luck was one of my favorite players to watch.
to sum it up.. she has f^&k you money, and she made him become a stay at home dad
Luck is really an awesome Dude, wish the best for him. Yet, perhaps if he would have had a better owner, he is still playing.
He retired because of the Colts. He was stuck and new he'd never get out before his prime. Wish he could come back and play for a new team.
People saying brady should take notes think of this. In 100 years everyone will still talk about Tom Brady. No one will know who Andrew luck was.
I watched Luck live play on that cold rainy Monday night back in 2015 at Carolina. Glad I was able to watch him play once and salute his personal reasonings to leave the game.
Why not just read the article?
last 15 seconds made me die
Part of the article talks about how Andrew Luck hated being a controlling asshole and how it not only affected his personal life, but it just added tons of stress on him
I can only congratulate guys who decide there are more important things than playing football.  Barry Sanders comes to mind.  I don't know him, but I suspect he retired because he was tired of the NFL routine, had miraculously avoided major injury,, and felt like he had nothing else to prove.
Was Kevin Dunn the producer for this? Lmfao
Come on Pat. If you’re going to do a segment you have to at least read the article.   That being said , I read it today on their website and it was free.
Sounds like his wife made him retire lol. She gets to do her, but he had an ultimatum… fishy fishy stuff 🤔
Also not shocked that the boys reading level is at a 3rd grade level, the article wasn’t that hard of a read my guys
That’s a battle most men deal With not just football players. Family changes things
Luck didn't let the Colts to the AFC championship game in his rookie season. It was in his third season. His rookie season ended in the wildcard round to the Ravens. They lost in the divisional round in his second season
Maybe if Brady made the same choice he would still have his family together.
It’s just so much waffle. Move on.
It’s crazy to think Luck could’ve been even greater had he been more vocal.
The other thing about Andrew Luck that seems to make him different than most athletes is that he is not afraid to ask tough questions of himself and others. He appears to not want to be defined by what society defines as great simply because that explanation of greatness is too simple and lacking in emotional validity. Based on this article, it sounds like his greatest regret was the timing of his retirement and how it left the Colts and his teammates in the lurch. He is not wrong about that, but I would argue that he deserves forgiveness for the ill-timed announcement as he was in a rare situation with little in the way of guidance. He also made a difficult, but honorable, decision that few of us would have the balls to make.
Easy decision to make when you’re already loaded. No disrespect, but I’d love to leave my job. I feel unfulfilled too. But my wife has cancer and I have 3 kids 🤷
If colts had a better owner luck would still be playing. Guy had no protection his whole career
You lost 47-14 deflated footballs doesn't prevent you from getting your asses kicked
Some people just cannot comprehend why someone would choose family over achievement.
Andrew Luck followed his good instincts and realized it was over for him. Luck did the right thing.
He didn’t make the afc championship till his 3rd year not rookie year but what do I know
I can't wait to get luck back in Madden
I'm going to contact SB Nation for a Indianapolis Colts Collapse Episode
IMO, Andrew looked at the next season and, like the rest of us, saw more pain and no gain. So, he chose family over football. Good move.
We didnt go to the AFCC Lucks rookie year. That was in 2014. In 2012 Colts went 11-5 but lost to the SB champ Ravens in the WC.
Pat's didn't cheat get over it pat
He made the right choice he was overrated RG3 was better without the Injury and Kirk Cousins Outperformed him long term Kirk Cousins is the Best QB from the 2012 Draft Case closed History Recorded
"We played against a team with deflated footballs ..."  Keep coping, Pat.
In not profitable for corporate America for you to find yourself through an existential crisis.
One of my best friends Alex Luck is his cousin. I've met Luck before great guy.
sounds like luck pussied out.
luck is gonna be one of the biggest what ifs he was am awesome player hof talent if he decided to comeback 90% of teams would try to get him but hopefully he's happy in his life thats most important
AQ seems a touch salty to this who interaction. It’s interesting since everyone looks to andrews o line for all the hits that he’s taken. I wonder if AQ feels like he is slightly to blame. He seems on edge this whole conversation.
As a Colts fan I very selfishly miss having Andrew Luck as our QB over the past 3-4 years, but I completely respect his decision. He made one of the most difficult decisions imaginable on a very public stage, certainly knowing he would receive intense criticism and scrutiny. I read the article, and it is a good and illuminating one. I hope he finds purpose and peace. He deserves that as much as anyone.
The only opinion that matters is his own . Great Job and wish him the best !
Sounds like his wife was jealous of Lucks success.
Read the article, and wasn't represented too well in the discussion.  What I got out of it is the family was certainly part of it, but overall it was that he hated who he was and who he had to be in order to be a great QB.  He knew he had to be what you talked about, the a-hole, control freak to be a great QB, to the point where he did things like ordering for teammates and other people when out to dinner.  He sounded like he almost had an obsessiveness that gave him incredible anxiety.  It wasn't an ultimatum from his wife, it was hey, we have to share this and you can't be QB1 to me, you have to be a husband.   But, reading the whole article told me he did it for himself and to be the person he wanted to ultimately be.
I don't know about anyone else, but I died when Pat was talking about the people on the show reading the article at the beginning of the clip and when he gets to Connor, he says "he attempted to read the article," after complimenting Ty for being smart and getting through the entire article. And there is absolutely no objection from Connor. I don't know, I just thought it was super funny.
Andrew luck parents are who now wow you only go pro from wealth
Lucks daddy was a Rhode Scholar… like Oxford, the oldest graduate scholarship in the world.
ANDREW LUCK AINT A PIMPLE ON PEYTON MANINGS ASS CHEEK. AND I HERD LUCK BEFORE A GAME SAYING HE LIKED BEING HIT AT THE START OF THE GAME
as a colts fan i can say i hope he is happy ... i recently saw a pick of him and from his body he does NOT miss the gym but his smile was brighter than it ever was before and he sure looked happy
Maybe dain bramage.
Not even one ring
You know an unappreciated fact about this show. No clickbait titles
They didn’t even read the article smh
I didn't need an answer from Andrew. I completely understand why he walked away. Anyone who played the game had to ponder the long term consequences.  A smart guy like Luck, you can understand the why. I do...
IN short HE retired so HE could stop getting fuked up
Frustrating video. Guys talking about an article that all, but one, didn’t read.
LOLts
How are you committing your entire life when the Average NFL career is 3 years... people dedicate more to becoming a Doctor.
Always like Andrew luck and I’m a lions fan, can’t blame him for what he did. Same thing as Calvin, wanted to protect his future, hope all is well
Then he got motherfucked by the Colts fans while he left the arena . Bravo Indy
Colts should’ve protected him better.
If I married a gymnast I wouldn’t t want to go to work either. 💯
Luck should of dumped her ass and kept playing he was going to get all that money he could’ve payed child support lol
Luck with his family, Brady divorced, could it be that simple
I don’t know why but I always felt like Luck was over rated. Sometime they just kick who they want to be the greatest and they crowned him the next Manning. Never lived up to it.
Sign prenups and do what you love...
02:51 Roasted! Ouch! RIP Connor
This guy is the antithesis of Tom Brady lol
Uh he literally said the day he retired that he was tired of being injured
Andrew Luck > Tom Brady
Lol deflated footballs he says, more like you put a team on the field with deflated tacklers LOLOLOL
It was The Dolphins Vs. The Colts , The Campaign was, Suck for Luck,
I'm honestly surprised this doesn't happen more in the NFL. You basically have to eat sleep and breathe the sport if you want to be successful. The money is great but the mental exhaustion and physical wear and tear on your body and the sacrifices you have to make to be great are extraordinary. People don't understand what pain can do to a person both mentally and physically. His wife saw him going down a path that wasn't healthy for him or their family. She ultimately said do you want to be a great qb or do you want to be a great family man, the choice is yours. Me personally I would choose being a great family man every time, it's much more rewarding then living in constant pain and turmoil.
It's like WickerSHAM was wasted when he wrote that piece.
Smh. I'm happy their happy but geez sounds like his wife was being a jerk about it.
I can't hate luck for his decision. I thought he was a good QB but man, he used to get smashed on that field. I don't blame him one bit.
He wasn't a great quarterback that's why he retired
He had no oline
Pat Hooked On Context Clues interactive game coming to Toys R Us soon
I was on the last half of my 40 minute lunchbreak when i started reading the article, didnt realize i didnt have enough time to finish. Have to read it again on my next break. Such a great read and eye opening  One of the biggest takeaways that theyre missing is that he hated that he had to have this mentality of being that guy. He didnt want to seem weak to anyone including coaching staff and his girlfriend. Thats why they kept dicking us around ,before he retired, about his injuries. Because he wouldnt talk about his pain
He is a Champion. He strives to do his best at everything. He didn't like the half-ass job he was doing as family-man. His children will see him as a Champion.
As a colts fan I watched the first couple mins of this and turned it off I couldn’t do it...
Pats been hit in the head too many time Lucks rookie year yes that all happens but they lost in WC to SB champs Baltimore , 2 years later 2014 they went to the AFCC game.
Lmfao bro this podcast is the best 😂 besides the pats fan 😂😂
basically he realized this society/job game is a torture trap. and he became aware that he was stuck in that cycle. And got out and focused on just bein happy.
Chargers need to take note, they are literally holding Hebert back from greatness because they can't protect him and get him a good offensive coordinator
Don’t worry Andrew we took care of them Colts for you for how they booed you when you walked off the field 💪🏾 definitely one of the toughest QB’s I’ve watched since watching the game when I was a kid 🖤
Deflated footballs. We’re still doing this even that whole team got smoked on an athletic level? By the way, I can’t stand the NFL. I think it’s boring. But I remember watching that and thinking, the Pats are just out footballing these guys in every aspect. Then when I heard the reason why they won was because of deflated footballs? It sounds like a joke
5 min of lead 5 min of reaction and 9 oif pat admitting Adrew is a superior human being
Be honest I just remember peyton
Pats high, Luck didn’t go to the AFC Championship game until year 3, not his rookie year. He was great though.
how pat read all that and not stutter once
I have never, and will never, be in his position, but he comes off as a prima donna who was forced to face the real-life problems all us ordinary problems deal with every day with the huge exception that he has no money problems. Very little sympathy in this corner
It’s actually annoying how these guys brag about being dumb and not being able to read; it’s not funny, it’s real.
Think he screwed frank reich when he left cause that was what he was expected to have was a great team with Andrew after that it all went down hill the very next if Andrew played we would have been in play offs
"deflated" footballs, lol. sour grapes and science.
Luck was special. He would have been an all time great if he played 15 years
Look we prioritize the qb but so many of them are getting damaged to play a game….
It's almost cringe to see how AQ just doesn't get it. He's like suck it up. Missing the point big guy
tell that mouth breather that he brings that show down.
He chose his family and his body over football.  Not sure why home boy had to write a Shakespeare insert there lol.
The article puts a spotlight on how much pressure these organizations place on elite, highly paid athletes to get healthy as soon as possible. And when a doctor says “he just needs more time to heal” it’s unacceptable.
@11:22 Lmao 🤣 Exactly
OMG, He was one of my favorite quarterbacks and is so down to earth.   Imagine if he played more, he definitely would of won a Super Bowl..
Tiger is the prime example of this mentality. Dude was a GD MACHINE! Until he wasnt. Because once life caught up and snapped him out of that robotic mentality. His game fell TF OFF! Of course Luck never made it to that level of "THIS is everything and NOTHING else matters". Just close enough to recognize what was happening and stopped before it ever did.
Maybe Andrew quit because he was tired of appeasing the people around him. He pulled the ultimate,'I'll do this my way'
He didn't get to the AFC championship until his third season
Why are you still covering the helmets in the background? I thought the NFL thing was settled.
Colts lost to the Ravens in the wild card his rookie season
Johnny Bravo
Well he doesn't have a ring and probably won't get into the hof..  But he made millions..is healthy..has a wife/kids... So who is the smart one
I think this just shows how much of a goat Tom Brady is.
I used to go to the University of Michigan. Met so many people like Andrew Luck. I don't know, if you don't know what these people are like, you might love them. I think he's an insufferable tool. I continue to be vindicated every time he gives an interview. If I owned or managed an NFL team, I'd never touch this guy. I know, you have to keep feelings apart from logic/numbers when running a team, but man, it's very obvious he only played football for the money and thought he was better than everyone else. Like the other guy on the Ravens who quit to study math, he bolted early too.  I have NOTHING against intelligence and academia, but some people take it too far and are pompous about it. To the point they come off as stupid. You know, bringing thick books about philosophy or new age beliefs out to restaurants or parties just to flex, bragging about reading books on Facebook, it's just pathetic. Have a friend who I thought was brilliant in high school. He actually was. 20 years later, he works at Barnes and Noble as a regular employee and is totally insufferable. I don't think he's smart anymore, he's just posing. That's when it becomes a problem.  I hate the people who claim they read multiple books a day too. 100% of the time, they are flexing. If they're not lying, they're not understanding a thing they are reading. I can do that too. I just won't understand anything. I honestly think people who say that are crying for help.
Indianapolis fans wouldn't have been able to understand that article without you pat. good job.
Just glad I got to witness his greatness twice both against my team best was the afc divisional round against Peyton and the Broncos dude came back in the second half and dominated
No one wants to talk about how many ints he threw lol
I really wish he wouldn’t have sold out the fans by waiting for season tickets to sell. He retired the next business day after season ticket sales closed. We should’ve kept Peyton and let Andrew ski
LAY OFF THE ADDERALL PAT.
So this article basically stated what we already knew, injuries and didn’t have the passion for the game anymore.
Luck could've been one of the greats. I respect him getting out though.
Colts fan deserve all the hurt for what they did to Luck.
McAfee Could Give Bruce Buffer Ah Run For His Money On Intros
Who’d have thought that in a draft that contained Luck, RG3 and Russell Wilson that Kirk Cousins will likely be the last one standing
So basically a shrink planted a very expensive seed in our QB'S head .... Thanks for that !
Tell AQ to lick some balls, luck made a decision that was in best interest of his family, if he doesn’t understand that then tell him to stfu. I hope colts never find a QB w how they treated luck
An example of being paid by the word
Andrew Luck in an avalanch
Very few men would have chosen their family over their fame. That's a role model for young men everywhere.
Say all the feel good stuff you want to about Luck. He quit on his team. He will always be considered a quitter by Indianapolis fans and most of his teammates. His lasting legacy will be being booed by colts fans. I think his decision to quit, haunts him to this day.
Stick with the book club guys you’ll get it eventually.
To be the best at anything you have to sacrifice everything…..Andrew just figured it out and made his decision…Respect 👍
Moral of the story, is women are dream killers. Selfish in every way, getting the man to choose his dreams for her. Hate to say it but pro athletes shouldn’t even marry till their 35.
And after the 6th read through I think I got it. 😅
I was impressed with Luck when he upset USC at the coliseum.
Is Pat McAfee the coolest guy in America? I think he is.
@5:58 - there are seven people in frame..... reflections on relfections
Not one person on here sees the truth… His wife hated the game, hated the commitment and hated that he was the famous one instead of her. She didn’t want him to be great and now he will always be the biggest simp to ever play the game…
Luck made a mistake and didn’t divorce her ass. Zero ultimatums.
Why do you need so many people to do this show? 🧐
All you men in America are wooses.  You have been brain washed by the media.  Keep it simple.  I, Tarzan, you, Jane, son, Boy, ape, Cheeta.  The man goes to work to earn money.  He mows the lawn, performs maintenance on the cars.  The woman is to cook the food and maintain the house.  The children are sent off to school to learn reading, writing, and arithmetic.  If they go to Parochial School, they learn about the Plan of God and become believers with morals.  That Brazilian chick had a cook preparing food, maids to clean the house and do the laundry.  She did not have to lift a finger, just do fun things with the children.  After 8 years old, the golden years with the children are over.  Next comes the hard part, then teenage years.  Brazilian is banging her karate instructor and complaining about her husband.  She is spoiled rotten.  Many women have a family of 8 children to raise with no hired helpers, plus grandparents, perhaps a wheelchair invalid to care for.  This Brazilian chick is a brat.  Aging, ugly, over the hill.  Nobody wants her.  With her money,she can rent any toy boy she wants and change often.  She is a self-proclaimed witch too!    She was too old for that Titanic guy.   Poor Tom Brady got the scraps.
That was a terribly written paragraph lmao
Andrew Luck is the polar opposite of Tom Brady when it comes to priorities
Pat, you are Awsome! Have become such a Girl Fan of your personality, fun,  and show. Your Crew/Team are Funny and Great. But I don't like the new guy who's desk is next/behind your desk. The one who was on the Colts Team during Luck's time. He is not very nice or sensitive. His energy is not matched with You All. I hope he is only a guest every now and then. You All are really a Wonderful Brotherhood. Thank you for all the Good, Positive,  Smart, Kind, Admiral things you said about Luck. He was All of that, with such a Bright Future ahead. I wish he didn't retire. He was So Talented. I wish too, you got a chance to know him, become a friend, and mentor him. His very early departure, may not have happened. Keep being you. And Congratulations to you & your wife.
I had many Soldier buddies throughout my Army career whose wives told them flat-out, "It's me, or the Army, not both." They quit, their wives ended up dumping them anyway.  This is likely why I'm 52 & never been married. Nobody will tell me what I can & cannot do for a living. I detest women like this example...
Pat hit it on the head. For a job that demands so much out of a person that the person literally shapes their identity around it, to contemplate leaving, especially in what seems to be, finally, a successful career, is practically unthinkable. I think, with all the issues surrounding him in his career, both on the field and at home, he was faced with a similar choice as Brady’s, except I think the clock ran out much sooner for him than it did for Brady.  Luck, probably being as introspective as he is, found himself weighing the pros and cons of continuing his football career. The problem being each choice comes with a tremendous sacrifice: the decision to leave football, which requires giving up untold fame, fortune, and a good part of his identity as a football player; and the decision to remain in the league, which requires sacrifice not only of him, but of his family as well, both in time and commitment, something of which they know they can’t necessarily get back.   What’s the right decision? IS there a “right” decision? Ultimately I think we can agree Luck made the best decision for himself and his family in the long run, and, unlike many players, he had ready options to still pursue a lucrative career that didn’t require the same kind of sacrifice to his personal and home life.  But even so, it doesn’t mean he won’t wonder from time to time what could have been.
Pat colts didn't make the afc championship that year 😂😂😂
Good writers keep it simple
He gave everything he had
at 11:10ish.. if Luck is pulling anyone out of an avalanche most people would think they are dead. XD
Hopefully we get an Andrew luck - “Football Life” or 30/30
Watching some Colts game then, I always wondered what GM Grigson and the offensive linemen had against Luck. He was constantly running for his life or eating turf. I figured that had a lot to do with early retirement. He wanted to live!
Can we get a reality show of Andrew Luck as ski patrol in the Alps? Thanks
Hey Pat, the Patriots dismantled you in the second half of that game with the league's doctored balls. (The rules were championed by Peyton and Tom to let the quarterbacks have some say in how their game balls would be gotten ready for the game I.E. "kickers balls") Same as you special teamers! The league brought out balls that were not allowed to be approved by our guy as per that rule!  Second of all, every Colts ball they checked was the same amount off as all but one of their balls. The one your guy intercepted and your sideline checked before they showed it to an official. Last time I checked the air pressure on a ball, some air came out of it when I stuck the gauge in. You guys tampered with their ball, blamed them for cheating, sullied their team's integrity AND still got your asses handed to you! How ya doin', keep it movin'!
If you are a franchise quarterback coming off an injury, maybe don’t go skiing
That whistle was godly 11:00
AQ is not a likeable guy at all.
Sounds like he just had a mental breakdown and puss'd out.
He was wondering if he'd have anything left after football if he kept playing. What price do you pay in your 40s or 50s looking back at your glory  days? He was doing mental gymnastics to justify the cost he was paying with his body. Ultimately he made the choice that it wasn't worth it....but even while feeling that was the right choice it sometimes feels wrong. For comparison - see the state of Jim McMahon these days. Is that worth a SB ring in 1986? I imagine a lot of football players worry about what their futures will hold after more than a few years in the NFL. Junior Seau, Dave Duerson, etc.  Even without the fear of CTE is a wrecked body that can't play with grandchildren worth it?
I am continually amazed how upset “sports” people get when someone walks away from a sport to go live their life.  He didn’t cheat, he didn’t stab anyone in the back, he didn’t bad-mouth anyone . . . . he simply had other options and did not want to spend the later 30 years of his life with significant physical disabilities and a broken family life.  Let’s simply allow this man his life and not try to fill “content” in this way.  Great show, so let’s move on.
I'm pretty sure Pat misremembers that first year with Andrew Luck. The colts didn't make it to AFC Championship game, i'm pretty sure they lost to the Ravens in the first round that year.
Believe it or not there is more to life than football .
That boy waisted a lot of peoples time man lmaooo 😂😂😂😂
It was the injuries…
This guy next to Pat who said "suck it up" should get fired, what the hell is he even doing there, Pat keeps asking him about Luck like they were close but all the guy keeps doing is slamming Luck, what the f*ck is that about
Andrew luck is twice the man tom brady ever will be
Reminds me of Todd Christiansen EX Raiders tight end
Sounds like his wife made his decision so she could chase her career.
He was litetally getting destroyed.  I hope he's happier and healthier.
AQ missed it here part of why he left is cause he couldn’t enjoy life due to having to always rehab from crazy injuries while “sucking it up” he was always getting killed hit wise
Damn! It sounds like his wife bosses the hell outta him and makes him her b**** 😂 Well based off of the way the boyz talk about the situation 😂 “Your hanging it up? Okay, well I gotta go I got a meeting” 😂
Irsay should’ve been forced to sell the team by the NFL for what he did to Luck. I’m not joking. The league should’ve filed for him to be removed as owner for gross negligence. Too busy snorting lines eh Irsay?
I think he was smart enough to look at himself and ask “Am I more than my career?” So many people don’t do that. They solely define who they are by what they do. While a very good quarterback, he knew he was more than that. He was also a husband and father. However, he couldn’t be all three at the same time. To be a world class athlete he had to give up time with his family. Time is the one thing that you can never get back. No one, when they are old, complains that they didn’t work more. They regret not spending more time with those they love. He made plenty of money. So one day he was honest with himself and asked if he was more than what he did for a living. Once he realized he was, the choice was easy.
As a football fan, I just miss Andrew Luck. He was such a great player on some really bad Colts teams.
I love the fact he wore a knights hat after they beat Boston in shootouts last night next to the patriots fan haha
COLTS LOST TO RAVENS, WILD CARD GAME LUCK'S FIRST YEAR
Solid read there Pat - Solid Proof that you're keeping up to date with all the pages of the A12 Book CLub
Man Luck was my hero. Had no regrets as a Colts fan having him as our QB. Praised him through the roof. Still Rock his Jersey #12 always will.
I'm a niners fan. And, on top of that, I'm a fan of anyone who makes Bay Area sports better.  Luck and Harbaugh killed it at Stanford. If you take a time machine, there was a point in time when Andrew was expected to follow the lead and come home to SF but obviously we know what happened.  To this day I support both Jim and Andrew in life, because at one point they both laid it all out on the line to make Bay Area sports relevant again.  And I thank both of them. And love watching highlights.
So with the media knowing this, they still will continue to slander professional athletes. Sad but true.
I always thought it was a combination of things... first, he had been dealing with injuries the year before.. and I bet being home and rehabbing, he spent more time with his family and he liked it.. then went back to work and suddenly... Football just didn't have that draw is used to and his heart was no longer in it... not to mention, injuries.. he'd been dealing with them.. probably would have more... suddenly.. it wasn't worth it anymore, he had enough $$$$ to do what he needed/wanted... and family won.. and if that was the case... More power to him.. yeah, I bet the colts and their fans were not happy... if that's the case, the line should have kept him vertical just a bit more where he didn't have to rehab... oh well... Leave on top.. much like that Barry fellow from Detroit..
If possible, Andrew Luck is even more beloved now that his reasons for retirement are clear.  Family and health over EVERYTHING!
Honestly, I'm surprised what Luck did isn't more common. Football is an extremely physical and demanding sport and if you are good enough to play 3-5 years you will make enough money to be set for life. So, it is surprising that more football players don't prioritize their family and long term health once they make their money. I get that for some guys they truly have a passion for the sport, but for most the reality that its a sport with a very limited shelf life and is only for entertainment should cause more players to assess their involvement in the NFL a bit more realistically.
Are we going to ignore the fact they lost in the first round to the Ravens during their superbowl season in Luck's rookie season. They didn't make the AFC CG until his third year.
Why is everything about luck always weird and awkward.not that you guys made it like that it’s just everything that has his name always is kind of awkward
It’s not convoluted. It’s well considered and people like McAfee just aren’t comfortable with reading something that isn’t simple. 🤷🏼‍♂️ no disrespect Pat. We are all different.
That's what's going to happen to Justin Herbert and they don't fix that whole line
WTF hold on a minute...so Andrew's wife played a big role in him retiring???  I get wanting to be a family man.  But bro...for real...being an elite QB in the NFL has a 10 year window IF you have ungodly talent and some luck on your side...not to mention you will literally earn a couple of hundred millions dollars plus possible legend status FOREVER!!!  You retire in your mid to late 30's and you can do the Mr. Mom thing for the rest of your life which is still like 30 to 50 years!  It seems like Andrew made the best decision for himself and his family, but still...I sincerely hope he's happy, because he sure as hell gave up A LOT to make her happy.    Also, I 100% agree with Pat's point about Andrew being too nice.  Andrews had zero holes in his game except that.  I hated seeing him pat a DE on the butt everytime the DE knocked him on his ass.  Peyton would have been furious and lit into the guy who let that DE through.
Actually pat that first year where pagano was ill you guys were knocked out first round in ray lewis's last game in Baltimore
Shame Luck couldn’t play his entire career out. Glad he took the health over football tho.
No O-line caused the man many injuries
I really felt sorry for luck. He was an e”ELITE”  qb. Say what you want but he would have won a superbowl with a different team. They didnt put enough people around him
Some people in Indiana hate Luck for what he did to the Colts.  I have been a Colt's fan for over 55 years from Baltimore now live in Indiana.  I blame the management for not having an OLine to protect him.  The big question;  if he didn't have to heal from lacerated organs shoulder damage and all the other hits he had to endure would he have played longer???
So it was what @barrymcrockiner mentioned… most elite and greatest of the greatest qbs are all a lil touched in the head to play at that level and luck was a lil to normal
Does the opposite of Tom Brady lol
I’m not even a big college football guy, but Andrew Luck was my favorite college player and Stanford was my favorite college football team. and as a kid in high school at the time, I wanted to go to Stanford because of him. his monster throwing ability, coupled with the fact that he could absolutely lay defenders out and would seek contact and win 99% of the time made my jaw drop and I loved every second of it. even though I’m a Chargers fan, I rooted for the Colts all the time when my team sucked and missed the playoffs and Andrew Luck was taking his team to the playoffs and an AFC Championship. as a fan, of course I was disappointed watching Luck retire right before the season started. but in hindsight - given all of his injuries, the surgeries and rehab he had to go through, the time he sacrificed with his family to be a great athlete - I totally understand why it wasn’t worth it for him anymore. and I have tremendous respect for him coming to that very difficult decision and putting his family and his health over football
Luck chose family over glory, what a loser
imma cam newton fan and hated a luck cause the comparisons😂😂😂 but that man… has a wild story
Nobody cares, thats in the past 🤣😂🤣😂
Let me make it simple for everyone what his article is saying. If he was to continue playing football he would not be able to do the things he needed to do as a Father. His wife gave him a choice. Continue to play football until he gets so injured he can no longer walk like Earl Campbell, plus she was going to take their child and leave him to continue to pursue his goals and dreams. Or retire and be there for their child as they continue to grow up. Retire and keep your wife.   He struggles with was him retiring the right thing. But, at the same time…his life right now, is better than it has ever been and if he were to have continued to play football. His personal life and relationship with his child and wife would not be what it is. And, he can live with that choice.
Keeping Pagano over Arians I still laugh at the stupidity of the colts
He did not go to the AFCCG as a rookie. Colts lost to the Ravens in the wild card.
I dont understand why he had to leave football to be a family man. Makes no sense
As a chargers fan, i fear that Justin Herbert might suffer from being too nice much like andrew did!
In other words he came from money. Don't need money=No motivation
Andrew Luck found out the NFL was scripted 😂😂
He wasn't accurate enough to justify playing long term. His mobility was necessary to be successful and he knew it and being mobile means taking a beating which he got tired of. Good for him for choosing family but his talent never matched the hype.
Good I miss that man
I hope Andrews doing well and happy. From the read it doesnt sound like his problems stemmed from football as much as in his head and relationship. Wife seems... God bless the Lucks.
that exerpt was so poorly written. It isn't you guys
That paragraph definitely did not have an editor put eyes on it.   It's not super smart.  It's super pretentious and clearly a first draft.
The end of this video says a lot on the low.. When NFL payers are calling you too nice thats never a good thing and when A man ends his career for a woman, thats even worse. She'll ultimately despise him for that move.. now we wait and watch.
It's like the opening paragraph, you aint gonna find the answers there Pat, they want you to pay.
His wife can have career but he can't. Got it.
Never thought deflated footballs would give u an advantage. Tom must've been doing it in tampa also and they caught him again and he's not doing it this year
This is the highest conversation I've ever seen. Literal minutes of non sequadors and random ranting lmao. Hilarious.
I'm a fan of the The Pat McAfee Show.
He retired because his luck ran out
2:54 "conner attempted to read it" had me laughing more than i should've. A dig so subtle conner didnt even react
He’s realized that she played him…
I'm going to see how this goes: John Elway, imo, was the greatest!
Luck knew he could never live up to all the hype. He took his $100 million and quit. Good for him.
Because he's a quitter.
Good thing for the Colts that those balls were “underflated”. Pats would’ve put up 60 on them if they were properly inflated!😂😂😂😂😂😂
He had to choose between his family and football, cause if he continued to play, he'd be broken (physically and mentally) and he wouldn't enjoy time with his wife and kids.
perfect example of how tweeting is deteriorating people's comprehension skills.
Maybe if Andrew luck didn’t play quarterback like Earl Campbell play running back he’d still be in NFL
Andrew played with strength and passion until he knew he couldn't anymore.
Lol. Luck stunk and was a fraud
If you ask me, this article is not the sign of a good writer. It’s the sign of a talented writer writing towards the wrong audience, which to me is more of a sign of a poor writer. Keeping the article concise and to the point is just as difficult and is a better sign of a good writer than a long and wordy article.
Deflated footballs ran for 250 with a practice squad running back
When they said its cheaper to keep her… he listened
I know this ain’t part of the video but remember 8 years ago when pat introduced the father of two and husband home for his family with a new car, an amazing punter and man!
I consider myself fortunate to have watched him play in person.  Much bigger and stronger than he appeared on TV.  He was amazing.   Delighted he left on his terms.   Few have the wisdom and courage to do so.   We were treated to greatness.
That article is a perfect example of a bad writer trying to sound like a great writer. Just terrible.
I will never forget when pats and colts played in the playoffs and the announcers before the game was even over saying “this might be the game Brady passes the torch over to Luck”. Colts ended up losing Luck later retired years later and TB12 still going strong lol
Very well said Ty. I always hear you guys talk about your lack of intelligence but all of you are far from stupid. This show wouldn’t have blown up the way it has without a fair amount of intelligence. With that being said, I miss Luck but he made the right decision. Took balls to leave but I would rather leave a game than my family.
Tone is so casually funny … “retention and comprehension is the problem” 😂
He’s smart. He played a game for a few years and now he’s worth 40 million.
He is one of only two NFL jersey I ever bought.  Andrew Luck and Patrick Willis.  Still feel bad for him when he got booed out of the stadium by the Colts fan in a preseason game in front of his family no less, once he announce his retirement. Whoever was at the stadium that booed Andrew Luck should be ashamed of themselves.
He made his money and got out while he still had a functioning brain and use of half his joints without prescription pills
I was at his last game at Arrowhead. Unreal he retired when he did but more power to him.  I think he knew he’d look back and realize the sacrifice wasn’t worth it.
Massive Luck fan, just want it to be known he didn’t go to the AFC championship his first season. Every year he progressed further in his first 3 years. Wildcard, then divisional, then AFC championship in his 3rd year.
Sounds like he was a cuck and his wife needed a stay at home husband 😆
I'm fine that he retired.  Not thrilled about how it happened. Glad everyone is talking about it since I'm not paying $10 for ESPN+ to read the full article.
That paragraph isn't good publicity for the Athletic 😂
Neck Beard!
Connor... you are blowing it... your slip is showing. Decent, insightful thoughtful, articulate... who woulda thunk👍🏻
One of my favorite players in the NCAA and the NFL.. The Colts should've done a better job protecting him with a competent O-Line.. He would've been a HOF no doubt
Still crying about "deflated" footballs?  You got beat fair and square by the GOAT.
To commit to a singular task in furtherance of being the best at one's chosen task requires one to negate the importance of everything outside the sphere of the task one chooses to commit one's life to. ☯️ Think of any person who has achieved singular greatness in history. Almost to a one, their life stories are absent collateral interests and dedications from Genghis Khan to Einstein to Stephen Hawkins to Natalie Zeemon Davis and more.
Nah she's lucky she married Andrew luck period!
You’re wrong, Pat. Andrew Luck’s rookie year, you all lost to the Ravens in the Wild Card round. That’s the year that they won the Super Bowl. Lost in the Divisional round the following year, then the AFC Championship in his 3rd. That was the Deflate Gate game.
Luck being too nice of a guy for a quarterback is something that the article touches on and is much of the same stuff that pat said
Honestly I’m jealous that he put his health and family ahead of generational money and the chance of setting an all time legacy in one of the greatest league of all sports. A responsible and selfless man.
Love Pat. But in luck’s rookie year we lost in wildcard round to ravens
As a titans fan i have mix feeling, on one hand dude was becoming one of the best qb in the league and on the other Luck doesnt beat us every years 😂
So he retired because his wife said she's not gonna take care of him???
I always had the hope he would retire for a year or two and eventually come back. But I guess he truly is done. Good for him def it just sucks we couldn't see him playing more years.
I suspected people would look back differently at Luck than he actually was because of the way it ended. In reality he was no where near as good or successful as was expected when he was drafted. Expectations were certainly way overblown but he didn’t even come close to what experts and football executives projected.
Big Luck fan,,,and don't blame him one bit for his decision. He did the right thing for him and his family at the time,,,like they say,,,happy wife,,happy life..
As a titans fan hearing him retire was the best news ever for me
Just like the photo on my phone from years ago "He just wanted to pump his gas into his silver Audi and go home".
Chase your dreams if the female not tryna make it work for u to live your childhood dream she for the streets  Another king slayn by the queen lol rip
It's cool. He's the one who has to live with himself so as long as he doesn't feel any remorse for leaving Indy at the alter a week before the season started, than it's all good. It's not like Indy is asking for their money back so he really doesn't need to or owe anybody an explanation or formulate any type of defense. And I'm sure his explanation at this point wouldn't help or hurt Indy any more or less than it would've helped or hurt them when all this actually happened. But it's confusing why he's suddenly speaking out now. I'm sure most people would have liked to hear the why's to all this a few years ago.
I became a Colts fan because of great QBs in b2b decades, Peyton and Luck. Still can't get over it how horrible we have been after these 2 left the building.
luck could have been an absolute great of the game. Dude was built like ur 99 player in madden and he still had wheels for his size. would sit in the pocket and get CRACKED while delivering strikes and could prob write an essay for you in 30 minutes. sad asf to see him go out like that
Tbh pat luck rookie year they lost to Baltimore in the wildcard round but big fan of you and Andrew 🙌🏿🙌🏿
I tested out at the 99th percentile in reading comprehension in my state.    As a prodigy I can with %100 certainty tell you, that is not high level reading.  It is however %100 (self aggrandizing) douchbaggary.
30,000 word article that explains one thing ..... My life s great and I'm sick of you woke 🏳‍🌈 jokes.
This is my favorite goto for intelligent conversation...which is maybe, sad 😂
"With deflated footballs" And lost harder with properly inflated balls
Sorry to poo poo everyone, but Luck was an overrated QB. Besides how injury prone he was (though some of the injuries were not his fault), he was a turnover machine and never came up clutch in key moments in games. It was also annoying that the mainstream media basically inducting him to the HoF as soon as he was drafted 😒😒
If Bro would have known how upset that choice would made me with the nipple pinching and the tears, pillow screaming, i started sniffing crack Andrew!!! Can u archetechurally engineer my heart back together Andrew?? Bucks Nation Let's Go!!!
How did these boys not understand the article cmoooon Pat 😂. Americans need to get better at reading comprehension!
Should've played the season out instead of retiring right before it started.
so ur saying we should HATE Lucks wife?
Respect to Luck for knowing what's really important in life. Also, what in the hell was that high school word fluff of an article lol?
Pat getting early stages of CTE, can't even remember that wasn't Luck's rookie year they made it to AFC Championship game, its was Luck's 3rd year
Honestly, look at how cool those QBs were 10 or so years ago. Rodgers, Wilson, Luck, Brady, both Mannings, Newton, Brees, Kap and RG3, and I’m sure I’m forgetting some. Great time for QB play in the NFL
patriots still put up more points in the second half (without deflated balls) than the colts did. you kind of sound salty, brother.
If he didn't retire the game and that offensive line was going to get him killed. If not immediately then down the road from all the concussions he would have and probably already did suffer.
Y’all end it right when they started asking about the wife 😂
surmise: didnt love football. burnt out
Cowherd did a segment on Luck when he was at Stanford, his classes and running a 12-0 team under Haurbaugh was crazy.
Deflated footballs my ass!
Luck got tired of growing that neck beard in the winter months in the NFL to keep his neck warm
The severity/history of injuries really took a tole on Luck as well
The best thing for those type of players who leave the NFL from either injury or whatever and retire with feeling nothing left of their life after football, should explore the idea of coaching. And learning to live life at its fullest, and enjoy your family
He’s too smart.
The guy that wrote that is ridiculous. Giant word salad for no reason other than trying to seem intelligent. He quit football because he didn't want to get hurt any more or hurt his family. We already knew this.
I watched Andrew Luck play against USC when he was at Stanford and besides maybe Trevor Lawrence, he was the most obvious 1st overall pick I've ever seen.. the Colts literally started Curtis fuckin Painter just so they would "suck for Luck" lol everyone knew what Irsay was doing and no one cared cause Luck was just that good
I’m worried Justin herbert is gonna go the way of Luck - too nice of a guy, too agreeable with bad coaching choices, an o line that regularly doesn’t protect him… Hopefully he picks it up as the years go by. And to be fair Drew Brees was never an asshole and had one helluva career
Just a lousy coward, nothing to see here.
Our society demands men to work non stop but then shames them for not being better fathers.
The first round of 2012 nfl draft was cursed. That's all. The first 5 picks Luck rg3 t-rich Kalil & blackmon were all one hit wonders who showed HOF brilliance in their rookie campaigns.
Still a quitter
Im so confused at the beginning he said they they went to the afc chip with Bruce but we lost in the wildcard that year to the superbowl champ ravens we went to the afc chip in 2014 with chuck
Luck and Lawrence are the best QBs I’ve ever seen out of collage
Colts didn’t get go to the AFC championship game his rookie year. He didn’t make it there till his 3rd year  in the league but did make it farther each year he was in the league the first 2 years.
Biggest takeaway is that there’s only ever a problem in a relationship when the women is unhappy 😂😂
Sounds like his wife is to blame
I’m still mad how he was treated by the Colts fans on his way out. I have never seen any player play harder or tougher than him. He was a warrior and owed us colts fans nothing at the end. He gave it all. Goodluck to him in the future. He even stuck around Indy until this year when he moved out to go back to school. Used to see him riding his bike around. Good guy.
Need some acoustic panels to absorb some of the reverb here. The audio sounds hollow.
sounds like he didn't want to be a 50 year old with serious CTE and concussion issues
Whatever gives Colts fans more pain I'm here for it.
So this narrative is false Andrew Luck's rookie season was 2012, we faced the Baltimore Ravens in 2012 wild card round and lost it was until the next year we faced the deflating patriots as Pat Mcafee claims here. Sorry Pat but you need to sit down here you've had too many blunts since then if I was on your show I would have corrected y ou after your Andrew rookie year statement.
Still waiting for someone to explain how deflated footballs helped a running game run over the Colts.
Football is temporary family is forever
This man pissed blood for a team that barely gave him an o line for the majority of his career. Hope hes happy wherever he is
Sounds like he was miserable while playing which affected his home life and his wife was having none of it. Especially considering how accomplished she is .  Similar to Brady only different Brady isn’t miserable while playing lol
Certain instances the camera is moving so many times you think Kevin Dunn is in charge of the cameras.
the issue was never that he retired, we all get it, but when he did it and how he F'd his team
Sounds like they were already rich and he figured his after football life would be better if he entered it now instead of after he beat his body and brain up. Honestly it was probably the proper choice for having the best life. Those regrets will likely weigh heavy though.
Funny thing about deflate gate is legarrate Blount had 200 rushing 🤣 nobody tacked
The point I got is Andrew had to be a person that he wasn’t. He didn’t want to tap into the elements that were required, or what was put upon him, to be the big QB. It states in the article that he didn’t like it, he wasn’t him. He was so driven to this image that he himself felt he had to become. I mean the guy was just graduating, had to replace PEYTON FUCKIN MANNING, and had this put on him at such a young age. I don’t like the narrative that “his wife made him do it”. He’s very intelligent and clearly had issues being open so he managed every aspect. Also the girlfriend/wife has a right not to want to be a part of that. He had the stones to put down being a HoF QB to be a HoF guy for his wife, kids, family. He had a choice, football or himself, and I think he chose correctly. Also idk who the dude is talking to Pat but why doesn’t he try carrying around the burden of what Andrew carried. Dude had a lame ass takes.  Edit: I actually read the article
Andrew Luck should have left Indy when he had the chance. That organization was lucky Peyton was as superman as he was.
I honestly believe people loved Andrew Luck so much not because of his talent or success but because he was last new person of an old football Era. What I mean is people like Luck, Ray Lewis, Urlacher etc... made football more exciting to watch because of their passion and leadership. Even when any of their seasons were sinking they could rally their team to make a run. Obviously there's still people today who are leaders or love the sport but I don't feel the same kind of energy I did with Luck or Lewis js. Those men were loved an respected regardless of any games outcome. Now it's more on the lines of for example... If mahomes plays amazing he's high energy and everyone loves him. But second he starts doing bad that energy is gone and everyone throws him under the bus is my point.
Wish we could of saved his career if he was a cowboy!!!! Our line will protect our QB by any means!!!! We always keep a nice O-Line!!!! As we couldn’t see how great he could’ve been!!!! At least 2-3 rings left on the table!!!! 😢 Glad he’s happy and healthy tho 💯💯💯💯
It's been obvious why he retired ever since he did so. CTE is real and for some guys it's not worth it.
Reading that article was illuminating.  You get a sense of how mentally exhausting that life can be.  The strength he had to do what he did and to come out the other end knowing he did the right thing… nothing but respect for him.
Andrew luck was so good
Sounds like Luck retired partly because he was miserable, partly to appease his wife, and partly to spend more time with his young children. It is certainly his right to do what he wants with his own life. Personally, spending more time with ones children is priceless. However, I would not advise anyone to leave a successful career because a spouse gives an ultimatum. You do what fulfills you and if your spouse isn't on board with that, you move on. I made many compromises for my long time, now ex-spouse, and never felt that she respected me for that. If anything, she simply expected more and more from me. If I had that part of my life to do over, I'd never have compromised what I wanted in favor of what she wanted, but of course, that's easy for me to say in hindsight because she took advantage of me. I hope Andrew isn't being taken advantage of by a woman who doesn't sacrifice anywhere near as much as he does. (Given the story at the end of the piece, he probably is, but who knows). To me, an athlete who never amounted to anything, having a career as a professional athlete remains an unfulfilled dream. I'd like to think that had I been blessed with half Andrew Luck's ability, I'd have given everything I had until I was no longer able to play. I wouldn't want to die wondering what might have been. That's the only problem I have with Luck's decision to retire young. He'll never know what he might have achieved. If I'm being honest, I think the potential he walked away from was a crying shame and I don't truly respect his decision. Call me an a**hole if you want.
Pat has fell down the "literally" hole and get out.
Ya no crap !!!…All these people who talk just about money and money is everything to them, miss out on the most important parts of life.  Just like how Luck was saying how he let football consume him. Health>Family>your passion> friends then money.  If you have money anywhere in the top 3 you 100% failed at life, you wasted it.
Pat, I don't mean to be rude, but Luck's rookie season/Pagano cancer season, you guys lost in the first round to Baltimore, who won the super bowl
LOL the deflated footballs.  Your team's balls were more deflated than the Patriots'.
We now know everything and nothing at the same time
Judging from that one paragraph, no one should feel like they are bad at reading for struggling with that article. That is a poorly written piece in bad need of extensive editing and rewrites.
Unpopular but true comment: They should've kept Bruce Arians.  Chuck Pagano was the problem.  Guy sucks next to Arians and it was evident.  But because of his health issues, they had to bring him back.  Too bad, else Arians would've taken Luck to great heights.
Heard his nimrod friends trying to be negative about the wife. One job your husband is getting destroyed because his o line isn't protecting him. He's constantly getting injured. Nah, she was looking out for him and wanted him to be in one piece for the family, and he made that decision. I'm sure it wasn't easy, but he made the right decision.
Andrew Luck was soft and had no heart. He quit on his team plan and simple
What I took away from that, is that he retired because he was afraid of CTE. No shame in that at all.
Joe burrow is bout to join that man in early retirement if bengals don’t get him o-line
Luck wasn't a rookie in that 2014 AFCCG AND you don't lose 45-7 solely due to allegedly under inflated balls🤷🏼‍♂️
Luck was cursed with the worst o-line ever in the NFL
I miss Luck SOOOO bad!
🧢
Andrew Luck will always be a what if story that’s how life goes, that colts o-line was garbage 🗑️
"got a book club, never read a book". Patafee.
it's written like that because the writer is pretentious. Not an uncommon trait among artists, but yeah, at least half of the goal of that article was to show everyone how smart / great writer he is.
Youve mixed up his rookie year was 2012. You lost to the ravens in the wild card round. 2015 is when the colts went to the AFC championship game. It was also the ravens that allegedly tipped off the colts the the Pats were deflating footballs.
a fortune cookie once said, "never give up what you love, for who you love..."
I’ll never forget when Luck was at Stanford and it was game day, someone held up a sign with a super detailed drawing that said “Andrew Luck is a Mountain Troll”.  I DIED when I saw that.
Aq’s opinion on this just ain’t it
Wickersham can’t write. Jesus Christ, it’s like reading a 7th graders book report.
I love how AQ is basically like boo freaking hoo and suck it up. But, I also read the article and don’t blame Luck for making the decision he did. As a Colts fan of course I wanted him to keep playing, but as a human being I’m glad he retired now.
Translated in English. Was sacrificing everything worth the nfl career? It was a hard decision, still is everyday, but it felt right to him
All the people who were responsible for putting A. Luck behind those offensive Offensive Lines should be charged criminally.  Imagine Luck behind a capable to great to HOF OL.
I swear if yu listen to the podcast without seeing this, I’d would guess Patty Mahomes
All these guys who went to US colleges who can't read a newspaper article baffle me
The end there was so awkward🤣
Should have locked up Arians, you guys had a chemistry
The sad part of being a fan of football is we want our team heroes to play forever, giving us much excitement even though our hero may be killing or potentially wreaking havoc to his body...it's a pitiful trait we have,hoping they don't get cte's or worse,but are willing to roll the dice   because we love the game,  the action and our team...
Im a Ravens fan but the Colts will be always be my second because of guys like luck and mcafee sorry to the guys ik im missing
Ravens vs Colts wild card game was a great one! (Ravens fan) 2012 I believe
Thanks for always being interesting and being supportive.
Let’s be honest here NOBODY is saying that if Andrew is Black. He left he walked out on the team right before the season not only that Irsey let him keep like 22 million bucks that’s not happening for some blk qb who wants to walk out he’d have to give back that money. So yea and no on luck. I’m not gonna have some  “ o he was the greatest” moment on luck because if any other guy walked out on the team right before the season they would be getting slaughtered every time they’re name came up.
He finds peace in knowing that he can’t know..
Surprisingly, Connor sums it up best!
I’m a colts fan that came for Peyton and stayed for Andrew and it’s been tough since he retired.
The set looks like a dirty dorm room
I’m glad Luck is happy and at peace and all that, but I’ll never forgive him for retiring hours after I drafted him way too early on my fantasy team
Luck was on the path to the HOF, it's sad he had to retire
I dont mean for this comment to come off in a bad way at all, but I can only imagine how many times hes had a dream of him winning multiple super bowls after making that decision to retire .
There was no ultimatum
Good for him.  I assume he made enough coin and best to go out young and relatively healthy.  Time to enjoy his life.  We should all be so “lucky”.  (Pun intended)
Good job by Pat closing that convo up at the end lol their was going to be some shots taken on the wife, and he ended it asap lol
He made a life decision he didn't want to be beating up now he can play with hims kids have the time to do it also
Happy wife, happy life.
He quit because he made his money and he’s not built like greats. Or just plain didn’t see the point of he’s not going to win it
The fact that it’s only been 3 years is insane.
The way they talk about reading kills me 😂
Please come back 😢
So luck got cucked out by his wife and threw away a HOF career so she could continue what she wanted to do? That’s Garbage. Makes me lose even more respect for him. Tom Brady is a real one, his wife gave him an ultimatum and he chose his passion. Marriage is temporary but the HOF is forever. Luck could’ve replaced her at the snap of a finger. That’s a shame
"To arrive at the clarity, that I don't need more clarity".🔥The more I thought about that line, the deeper it got. Sometimes we know what the right answers are in our lives, but we overcomplicate things out of fear. The dichotomy of simple versus easy.
“Suck it up” or get a block? Do YOUR job what an idiot remark from AQ
“Deflated” footballs didn’t help the Colts stop Blount from tearing their ass a new one
Still would have lost deflated balls or not. Colts stunk
deflate gate has been proven ridiculous by people much smarter than you McAfee.. You aren't gaining any ground bringing it up, and it certainly doesn't add to the story about these great humans that you decided to muddy by being butthurt you lost.
Sounds to me that as brilliant as Andrew is, he can’t put 100% into multiple things at once. He decided his family deserved his 100%. No shame
I wish you could get him on the show. That would be insane to hear the 3rd grade version of what he said lol
This guy still crying about deflated footballs?
1. Excellent dismount before it got dicey, Mr. McAfee. 2. Josh Allen, is this your future?
It's hard to read into a relationship you don't know, but it sounds like Andrew Luck was constantly underestimating the leverage he had in all of his relationships. (both personal and business)  Or at least afraid to act on that leverage.
Sounds like he hated his job.  Who hasn't been there?
Damn Wickersham pulled his thesaurus out for this one lol
“ part of a book club never read a book “ Macafee
He's back at Stanford pursuing a Masters in education, supposedly
I feel sorry you can't read. It was stretched for a magazine article or other, boring yes hard to understand no
Since he left colts have sucked   Matt Ryan is not going to help
I wonder what his career would have been if he had the protection Brady had😭 such a talanted quarterback dawg
Guys, come on, the article wasn't that difficult to read and if you're struggling to read and comprehend, it doesn't say much for your intellectual capacities. For heavens sake, it's not like you were reading Plato.
That article is hot garbage. Reads like a bad Shakespeare parody and I don't like Shakes n the first place. He says in 10 words what a normal person says in 3. That might be art, but it's a monocolor toilet glued to a pallet in a NY show kind of art. Every time I read someone that wrote a full paragraph and managed to say absolutely nothing, I want to find them and hang them off the Walt Whitman Bridge so they can both contemplate passable writing talent and have their time wasted just like they wasted mine.
Man I’m not even a colts fan, but the colts did not go to the afc championship game his rookie year.
I still remember his playoff run in his rookie season. He picked up the fumble and made a crucial td. Dude was tough as nail and just solid man overall, not just as a player.
Sounds like the injuries and the headaches from his wife were too much to handle... He knew the wife wasn't going anywhere and neither were the injuries, so decided the easiest path to happiness was walking away. Is what it is.
Protect your mental and your chicken. -Marshawn Lynch
The Colts ruined Andrew Luck. He had the talent to be one of the all time greats. It was a crime how often they let him get massacred behind his O line year after year after year.
He did a reverse Tom Brady.... And I guarantee Luck is happier.
Andrew Luck was so great for us. I'll never forget that chiefs playoff game that comeback was insane.
I'm happy if he's happy. But damn if I didn't want to see what that MF'R could do with an offensive line and some weapons.
Andrew made it to wild card his rookie year Pat.
The Colts failed Andrew Luck.  Dude was so much fun to watch, but damn did he take a beating.  The fact he just peaced out to save his body, his sanity, and to be healthy for his family in the future is a commendable decision.  I can see how and why fans were upset, but they have to understand that the Colts didn't do everything they could have to protect his talent and well being.  Manning leaving with a ruined neck after all he did for The Colts was the example Luck had for what was in store for him if he had stayed.  I'm just glad to hear he's at peace with his decision now.  I'm sure he felt like he let a bunch of people at the time, which totally wasn't the case.
Andrew luck would have won a Super bowl by now if he didn’t retire, it would be his league right now
Gotta correct his opening statement. Y'all lost in the wild card round to the Ravens 24-9 his rookie year, make it to the AFC championship until the 2014-15 season (deflategate).
We miss you Andrew.  Glad you're doing good in life after the game tho man.  Stay healthy and happy.
So her job is fine but he needs to quit?
It was the timing of his decision that left a sour taste in colts fans mouths. Nobody except people that don't matter mind him retiring, however the decision to retire the 3rd week of the preseason on a team that went to the afc championship the year before was not ok.
Its sad that people dont remember how bad the Colts O-line and try to call Luck soft. He was the most sacked QB in the league.
Jay Cutler and David Carr got their brains beat in way more then Andrew Luck ! Jay Cutler will get up after every shot everytime  and yet gets no respect from media.
You don't "have time" to be a father.. after a 12-14 year career, your kid has already missed out on their father during their most formative years. Kudos to him for giving up wealth for family.
So he's a simp
He chose himself n his family over fame and rings possibly. Honestly I never felt the colts were that close to winning it all. Or put a complete team around him. So he’s very smart and loyal. Certain franchises r a buisness. Others over spend bc they can’t draft. The colts were both these things that could convince players to come. Plus the owner got caught up with pills snd cash. Cmon. Dude probably did the math. As u get older I’m sure the pills start flowing too. He’s smart. Got out.  Not worth all the negative. I know pat was a colt. But you excluded the owner suspension
Luck was an asshole, he quit on his team just before the season started telling everyone he would be there. You dont want to play anymore, fine. but be a man and finish the season and retire at end of season. But no hes not a team player. So F that guy.
To recap he quit because he didn't see any possible reward for playing being greater than the toll it would cost him to achieve it. Never played but to me there are only two reasons to play this game, the money and the glory. Luck didn't need the money and the glory was going to cost him more than he wanted to pay.
A guy as smart as Andrew Luck deciding to retire early makes me wonder how many players have set themselves for brain damage in the near future.   That article did sound super annoying to read though.
Dude threw for 40 tudies and over 4,000 yards he was a beast.
Harvard literally the next day proved how bogus ur deflated football story was.. never seen a further reach in my life... who was deflating the 7 balls on the colts side of the ball? Yea..
Would have been cool to see how far he went. Like if he would be top five quarterback today
Andrew choose his Family and Tom is choosing to Die on the field for old time🫡
People who write like that are ridiculous. They should all write like Tom Verducci
Uhhhhhh….I was told nothing.
The fact the colts screwed manning over when they refused protect him, then draft his replacement just to not protect luck. Wild
I wouldn’t be surprised if his wife had him by the balls and being the nice guy he apparently was allowed her to have a great career while he gets to be the center piece to her dream life.
Can’t hate on Andrew 🍀
Giants fan here, Luck was undoubtedly a hall of fame caliber player; sucks cause he’s exactly what the colts need right now
tom Brady didnt do this. And his wife divorced him and she started dating her karate coach. This is why tom is the GOAT. Rings over h()es.
Luck is one of my top 5 best prototypical QB ever
I would listen to Pat read me a book.
Thank for clearing that up… lol. You guys have a special way of muddying the waters on nearly every subject🤣👌🏼
12:50 seconds of not understanding Luck and Conman comes from the top rope with an incredible emotional interpretation
I read the article. While being a better husband, father, etc were big factors, I think you all understated what I took as just as big of a contributing factor for his retirement which was the injury history, recurrence, and continued struggle with rehabbing/feeling inadequate while being injured/mental toll that cycle took on him.
The colts are cursed by their mishandling of Luck. Happy Luck found peace
my dad told me he was gonna be next tom brady and peyton manning, sad it didn’t get to continue
Pat, I underestimated you.  Good job reading the piece about Andrew Luck.
A genuinely good guy
Would he be the best QB currently playing if he still played?
when you play at the highest level that’s expected. to be great, takes great sacrifices. not just from yourself, but from your family and loved ones and anyone in your support network
Luck did it right.  He didn't need rings, or a 15-20 year football career, he came in made his millions quickly and left healthy.  He's a very smart guy, he's going back looking to earn his masters, he's fine.  Good for him.  And he doesn't owe anyone reasons for retirement or answers.
That guys a BUM !!! he scammed the whole colts system ruined them for ever
Best thing about andrew luck was the civil war era 'General Luck' tweets (or whatever they were) that was written as diary entries to his mother!
Choose to be a husband and father at the end of a season, not the beginning.... In my book Andrew Luck can get bent!!!!!
Deflategate was proven a sham u stooge
Pats kind of a bad reader
Weird to see people prioritize work over family  Both are important, but when I’m old I’m not going to complain about all the time I missed at the office
Andrew Luck is a very bright man from Stanford.  Unlike a "lame brain" as Rodgers is, Luck had other options outside of football.  You gave him the credit he deserved.  You do a good job, Pat.
He retired bc he wanted to .. end of story!  I just don't understand the public and these weirdo super fans also the media especially??  To think that we even need or deserve an explanation is crazy .. that's the world we live in now tho!?
do you think it was an ultimatum or a concern about his health and the general well being of their family rather than its me or football?
The highest honor a man can hold is that of a loving father and a devoted husband. Props to him for realizing that he's provided enough for his family and doesn't need to feed his ego to find some self-worth.
To be one of the best at any professional sport you basically need to out-will everyone else which requires you to be a miserable maniac. Isn't happiness the intended result of achieving that level of success? Forget the clique "what ifs" and respect a dude for taking care of himself and his family. Luck doesn't owe you or anyone else a damn thing.
You got smoked by that team with ¼ of a lbs psi of deflated footballs... don't be such a wussy. They made me change the p to a w.
The curse of the generational no1 picks. I hope lawrence fairs better, but jax is easily worse than indy in 12
Pat my guy, you got to the AFC Ship in 2014, Andrew Luck was a rookie in 2012, when you guys lost the Wild Card Round to the Ravens.
That's great...now get back out there.
I SWORE Luck was coming back two years after he retired. They finally built an OL, drafted Nelson, and imagine what they could have gotten if they didn't have to keep taking swings for QBs.  JT+Luck+that OL...?  Could've been a dynasty.
I would love to hear Pat talk about the punter situation in Cincinnati, his thoughts on Huber being waived after 14.5 years with the Bengals, and his thoughts on Huber and the new guy Drue Chrisman and what he thinks of their punting abilities. I personally think the Bengals just made a huge mistake. I would much rather have Huber than Chrisman.
Sounds like life would have been nothing but football till he was forced out "chasing" something, but doing to the on-line being swiss cheese and injuries putting him in a position to quit. Brady only had one year of injuries,  Rodgers isn't married so they could chase, Luck was injured so often that being young stopped him from chasing something he hadn't achieved yet (SB).
Never forget when the fan base of the colts booed him. The man gave his body for the franchise that couldn’t even support him.
weak azz biznotch
Deflated Footballs nothing they kicked you"re Arse
Luck is a Prime example of what the NFL wants it's players to sacrifice to appear to be an elite, exclusive group. When you have options, you are no good to the shield and that narrative. Kudos to Barry Sanders and Calvin Johnson for setting such a great example of what priorities are supposed to look like.
Didn’t make the afc championship game his rookie year . Made it his 3rd year pretty sure
Big “class discussion where only one person did the reading” energy
Ty showed the levels to his game in this video
sounds like being a good family man and being an all star QB were decisions he had to make and somewhere along the line being a family man overtook football and that’s perfectly okay and respectable. As long as there is peace
Sounds like they're still confused or miffed about the situation today
When we getting a luck interview just ask him
Peyton the Goat 🐐
I read the full article, my take away is Luck was convinced by his wife to go to counseling and the the wife and counselor "helped" him realize he didn't want to play football anymore.
Is Stanford one of those schools where if your GPA isn’t that good but if your the right race. You can still get in?
I remember when he played with a lacerated liver, luck was and is a beast
Andrew luck was one of the best ever even in his short time. Hope he is happy.. on the other hand that AQ is a douche bag “ suck It up” f him
Do you think the need to have to take pain meds were part of Andrew Luck's decision to get out of football?
No matter the conversation the ghost of Brady will always haunt the Colts lol
A decision he will never regret. Being a husband and a dad. That is an incredible man!
When someone says, "had started", I'm done.
Bruce Arians brand of offensive football may have been successful to a point, but it was unfortunately not so much for the safety of the QB. Big Ben,  Carson Palmer, and luck got hit a ton.
Being at peace with multiple millions of dollars, living a lavish lifestyle. Mission accomplished. He never defeated Tom Brady's Pats. Not once. Multiple meetings were complete beat downs. That will be what haunts him.That being said, he was a very great player and his biggest fault was trying to hard all the time. He was awesome to watch even tho the Colts can suck a dick.
Didn't Athletic or something give a whole insider series on this earlier this year where Luck gave an interview?
It takes an individual that has a status of recognition, to enlighten the masses what sacrifices everyday folks make in order to be marginally successful. Being the head of a household (female or male), you make decisions that affect the later. That's why whenever you work, separating your work life and personal life is important. It takes a lot of effort to do this, but necessary to maintain a healthy life style. That excerpt makes a lot sense, especially if you've been in that role.
Yeah, Shipley can mock Luck all he wants but Luck took the responsible route. I can't commend him enough for it.
Proud of Luck... He did something called being honest and trying to find peace... A Game has turned into a business and a disturbing obsession for those that don't play... This is a refreshing view into a great player, better MAN... HE IS A GROWN MAN... TAKE NOTES AND GROW UP... Your occupation shouldn't define you... Because if it does, the end will come before your life is over... He is a refreshing reminder of having perspective... Pearls before swine...
Pat definitely has the story incorrect. Lucks rookie year was 2012 and they lost to the ravens in the wild card. 2014 they went to the afc championship game and lost to the pats
Funny how ever since Colts fans booed Luck off the field after learning that he retired they've been cursed with horrible QBs
Nah that therapist talked him out of the NFL
Luke Keuchly too
“Played against a team with deflated footballs.”  Stay salty Pat, your team gave up 45. You were always going to lose that game.
"We deflated footballs every game when we won the Superbowl". Brad Johnson. Tampa Bay  QB. Nice excuse though.
No man should follow after his wife! He’s having regrets because he wanted to please her and he gave up what he loves to do! Sad
We already knew why. . .because he’s soft.
He picked family over football. I remember a behind the scenes on Brady. During the offseason, he was on vacation somewhere tropical with the family. They had a large villa rented. It seemed like Brady spent most of the day between working out, doing his special eating, studying film, etc. Didn't seem like a real vacation other than he was somewhere tropical. His family were doing their thing, and he was doing football things.
It was a great read, I think the guys oversimplified the story, though. It wasn't all on his wife. He had an identity crisis that took over in the midst of his injuries and rehab. His confidence took a hit, made him look in the mirror and see what he had become. Loved football, was arguably the best in the league, didn't like what being a professional football player turned him into — the CEO mentality where he began to try to control absolutely everything, including things like ordering for everyone at restaurants, unprompted. His family was the collateral damage. He was closed off and controlling with his then girlfriend without even having those discussions with her about why — trying to protect her from the pitfalls of celebrity. The story didn't say any specific ultimatum was given, it did reference his GF was on the verge of leaving him before he had a breakdown/breakthrough during his shoulder rehab and finally opened up to her about what he was going through. They got married during his year off and got pregnant. He came out the other side was comeback player of the year in 2018 and then injured his ankle at the pro bowl and was beginning to go back down a dark path. He also did a lot of work on himself in that time to better lay the foundation of discovering who he is beyond just a QB. At that point, going back down that road with rehab, recovery and anger just to hit the NFL meat grinder again was not something he wanted to do. He was tired of it. He didn't have the fire anymore. He was done mentally with it. It's a reminder that these athletes are more than just characters in our sports fantasy. They are real people, not just figures we throw untold dollars at. We forget that. Good on him for making a choice to live the rest of life, to choose having a functional life. To go back to school to become a high school teacher and football coach.
The man chose his family over prestige. Honestly, it's a great lesson in priorities. He felt he needed to be more present with his family, he already made his bag, and now he's happy. It's a position I can't even imagine being in, but I'd say he made the right choice
…he had a window and he didn’t get a “ring” in that window. Most guys don’t. He didn’t want to do anymore damage to his body because it would have not gotten him any closer to the “ring”
Sounds like Andrew secretly got addicted to pain medication and had to retire
People who write articles like that, like to smell their own farts
I hope the story of him telling his wife (who made the ultimatum) that he was retiring from a job that he loved and spent his whole life learning and all she did was tell him ok and hang up so she can keep working away from home is a lie. Because idk how you'd stay with somebody who cares very little about that very heavy decision.
It's not worth the injuries.  He made a calculated decision. It's the right one.
So basically she forced him to quit his dream so she can do hers?? Difference between Tom and Andrew is that Tom obviously isn’t a simp.
Pat goofed here, Luck didn’t make it to the AFC Championship until 2015, he was drafted in 2012 lolll
Andrew Luck is who y’all want Tom Brady to be!! I give a lot of respect to Brady for going thru the sacrifice to make sure his family are set for life…. And the TD record lol
Nobody's gonna talk about how he called her to tell her and shes like basically true, gotta go work
And it's funny how's wife's a big TV producer because I'm pretty sure that takes away a large chunk of her time away from her family that's definitely a double standard so if he just quit because you got tired of getting the s*** kicked out of him I can understand that but If he did it cause she gave him an ultimatum that's b*******
Lots of parallels to me retiring from the military. Little bit of an Identity crisis and just want to be a dad and be there for my kids because I couldn’t earlier in life.
a crazy what if. but id make the same choice if i was able to.
Well, he did the right thing, he was put out constantly with a target on his back by the others and his health suffered because of it. He had everything to be a HOFer and retired because he probably wants to be able to remember his families names and play in the garden with his children. No point having money if you and yours can’t enjoy it, kudos to him for prioritising the right things in life.
The ending of this bit was legendary starting with AQ
That's the difference between an academically smart football player and a football player he can fall back on all of his academics and brain and everything else like that where most football players are just playing football because they love football and that's it there's no other love
If I sign a contract for a certain amount guaranteed in the millions and even if I retire I get paid best believe I'm retiring when I want to spend as much time as I can with my family. You don't get that time back so I don't fault Andrew at all. Family over football for him fs not every ball player can say that.
Haven't watched that Kurt Warner underdog movie. But if they made a Andrew Luck movie. You could just call it "Luck"
Respect to Luck.
Kinda crazy that his wife asks him to retire and when he calls her about it she brushes him off like that lol
Hope he can find peace in his decision, sucks if his wife really did put that pressure on him to force a decision on football vs life. But to reach the pinnacle at any endeavor you have to sacrifice a lot. Tom is the goat bc at the end of the day his mission is to be the goat. Most people can't understand that and thus never reach those peaks, Luck could have but if it wasn't worth the sacrifice to him then there was really no point in continuing to play other than money.
Bald dude is the duuuuhhh one of the group.
Hey should pick up the phone and call San Fran!!!  With their D, he could snipe a trophy! ;)
Yeah he got a lot of hate from people but always handled everything with class.
i'm a Bears fan and Luck was the reason i started paying attention to players themselves and not just the game, he was so good he made me wanna understand what made him better than everyone else
Just because he's got a good degree and knows a bunch of words doesn't mean he isn't pussywhipped and getting dragged around by his wife. He's a human, too.  The actual page shown in this clip discusses him searching for meaning in his life in football, not finding it, and leaving on his own terms. That might be his perspective, but the truth might be the people with influence in his life swayed him out of finding his own voice and expressing his own desires.
yea  Im not buying it...  if he was at peace with bailing out not only on his QB career, and bailing out on his team 9 days before the season starts he wouldnt have done that interview or article.      you better belive he has regrets about not seeing what his potential could be, and what the team could do. and I assume he regrets letting his team down more thatn anything, I know I would.       Retireing early isnt the issue ( I think preserving your healthis incredibly smart), walking out  9 days before the season starts and basically thwarting the Colts orginazation still to this day, must get tossed around in this thoughts.   Walking out 9 days before the season starts with no prior notice which doomed a incredible team that took 3 years to finally be top shelf quality  is probaly  in his thoughts.( or at least most knowledgeable people were naming them as top 1 or 2 teams in the leauge for that upcoming season)     he aint at peace, nothing is worst than wasted talent...  he couldve handled the timing of quiting so much better...  i doubt he is " happy or at peace" bcuz who is?  who doesnt have regrets ?  i dont  buy it
At 11:00 god damn that was the cleanest whistle I’ve ever heard
This is a horrible summarization of the article. There was never an ultimatum
Sounds almost like his wife is extremely self centered... the whole what about me nonsense... girl you are married to the highest paid football player in history...a man who could have been the goat.. sorry no one cares about gymnastics unless it's the Olympics... I think he should have played that season
This bit is amazing its like a bunch of dudes trying to get up to date on the reading they should of done over the weekend for an AP class....Where Pats the guy that kinda get the gist and Ty is filling everyone in with the best of his ability.
That's awesome. I respect Andrew Luck for that. I hope he lives righteous.
He was a 29 year old millionaire.    I never found it to be a big mystery.
Andrew is a different kinda Cat - I hope he is happy with his family now.
best pod on the internet.
Cuz the nfl is rigged and scripted
Andrew luck was a franchise changer, hence why the colts are what they are now…..wish him the best, glad I got to see him play
Andrew Luck held so much promise and had the makings to be amongst the elite quarterbacks of the nfl. It’s a shame the incompetency of Grigson and Irsay ruined any chance of Andrew Luck to be truly great.
Andrew Luck made the absolute right choice, and I hope the openness and honesty behind, health, mental health, family, etc. brings discussions to other professions as well.
Well when Andrew is in divorce court getting raked over coals for “child support” which is actually mommy’s new b/f support maybe he’ll find some answers.
If it wasn't about injury then the timing of his retirement is even worse
Man. I was huge Andrew Luck fan and it sucked he'd retired but all those hits he took. Kinda knew he in it for the long run
Look at Tom, his career, and his family. And what he sacrificed to get to where he is at. Look at Luck, his career, and his family. And what he has prioritized to get to where he is at.
I can concur, Tom Brady Does Deflate footballs
I miss the general Andrew Luck posts "dearest mother..... " Lol win or lose those were gold
I started watching football in 2018 and Luck was one of the reasons I kept watching.
Advanced reader level 1000 😭👏
I am surprised more NFL players don't do the same thing as Luck.  They can play a few seasons and they have more than enough to live the rest of their lives in contentment and take care of of their families.   I wonder how many later regret chasing excessive wealth and fame at the cost of their bodies, and the extra pain they will have to endure the rest of their lives, by pushing that time out as long as they are able?
Still with that deflate gate BS ?? 😂
Gaawdam how smart is Luck? Wow.
Nobody should feel bad about that excerpt. It is terrible, terrible, writing. I used to be an editor and I cannot believe anyone would let that trash get printed.
Luck was a really really smart guy.. he saw CTE risk and made a good decision for him. The NFL was an offer he could refuse
There is a movie with a scene, where a mentor makes his protege sit in front of an open grave with a blank headstone.  He asks him what will it say, when he's not here anymore?  Will it have his sports stats on it?  Do any of those stats matter to anyone else?  To the greater world or humanity.
Sounds like the wife was just jealous of how much attention Luck was getting. They started spouting off all of her accomplishments, and it just kind of solidifies to me that she didn't like that he was getting more attention than her.   The bald dude was right, it's six months, suck it up.
Basically Andrew Lucks wife fucked the colts… he needs a better chick, instead of making it about her. Idk, seems like a left wing liberal Stanford feminist.. if she was a cheerleader luck would still be playing and probably have a better home life 😂
The intellect is missing in that room
I really hope someday he does re unite with the Colts (not as a player or as a career). I think the fan base would love to hear from him again and would just love to see him speak, not even about his choices.  Just to show up and get some love some day, he may not want to and that is ok, but as a bears fan I have a ton of respect for him. I would love for him to get a standing ovation atleast one more time.
I love this, I respect Luck for sure.... Deflated footballs?... Pahlease. 🤣
Diehard Lions fan but I always loved Andrew Luck. I still believe that if he were healthy, he'd have had a First Ballot HoF career. It's really a shame that he sacrificed blood and body for the a team, got battered game in and game out, gave his all to a team just to get booed after announcing his retirement.
Actually it kind of sounds like he wants to see his daughter grow up and be involved in her life as well as avoiding being destroyed in family court.
I have random bruises should I get checked out??
You can't take money with you when you're dead
Luck was taking shots consistently salute
Hopefully Luck is a lesson to coaches and front offices that no matter how big and talented your quarterback is, ya gotta protect them. A shame Andrew retired so early, but any respectable fan would understand why he had to.
Barry Sanders, now Andrew Lucj
Y’all should read the piece.
The Colts didn't go to the AFC championship game Luck's rookie year. That was his 3rd season. Y'all lost to the Ravens in 2012
The article reads how Mike Tomlin speaks in post game pressers.
Andrew is Beta. Simple
I'm gonna be really honest. Started reading the article...scrolled down and saw how long it was, then closed the tab and lazily hoped one of the sports podcasts I follow would cover it.  Cheers, guys.
let’s be honest, Pagano and management of the team is why Luck really had to retire. Just because Luck didn’t blame the team in his ESPN write session doesn’t escape the reality i’m a long time chiefs fan that was happy after the 2013 afc wild card game💔
A rich kid from California...  Did he ever really have the heart?  Brady is where he is because heart...  I never got the vibe from Luck that football was his be all end all.
Deflated footballs lol that game was 45-7
I think Pat is remembering this wrong!
Women….
It wasn’t  about money for him. Heart for a game you love can’t be explained
The levels of high intellect on this show
Luck's story is right up there with the greatest what ifs of the NFL, when he retired it finally seemed like he got a great team around him.
10:59 I feel like I may be easily impressed because I was incredibly impressed with that whistle from Pat lol It sounded like it was played of a soundboard/phone, not someone just naturally busted it out on a whim mid conversation
Luck should never be compared to Brady luck quit answering Brady is the goat
I played against luck my senior year his sophomore year starting
I’m a Colts fan (unfortunately).   Andrew Luck deserved better. He’d still be in the NFL if the Colts had competent management and could actually build a team around him.
17:30 as someone who's father thought "there's plenty of time to be that" as well, no. There actually isn't. You'll never get back what you miss in your kids life, and they won't forget it, none of my brothers have. Andrew made the right choice.
His first regular season start against the Packers first pass was A Bomb for TD
Luck had all the attributes to be an all time great.  Sometimes it’s just not in the cards.  He was fun to watch though.
If luck was on the Phillip rivers colts team they would have won it all
I have a hard time with this decision.  I also have to admit that growing up a Broncos fan and watching Elway get the crap beat out of him on a weekly basis, it’s hard for me to understand a player who retires, not because of physical issues. Hell the 1998 season Elway tore the biceps tendon in his throwing arm and said, meh screw it, I’ll keep playing.  And these days QBs are protected like no other time. I am conflicted with his decision after a franchise gave up Peyton and banked their entire future on you, not to mention the fanbase.
As a colts fan i hate his retirement but as a father myself, I understand and commend him
You mean you LOST to a team with deflated footballs. 😁
Who is this Andrew Luck guy ? Would have, could have... pffft.
That paragraph basically said that Luck was uncertain about the right to do in 3 different ways using 2 quotes that say the same thing. My old teacher would have put red ink all over that paragraph to make it more concise making me angry that my word count is going down
Sounds like the weaker person gave up their career to help raise the kids.  Normally that would have been the wife.
I’m glad he picked himself over the business that is professional football! 👍🏾
Guy could come back tomorrow and i guarentee he would still wouldn't miss a beat.
Someone who was given too many gifts by life and couldn't handle it all so he had to give some of those gifts back. Even his name was Luck. He was blessed too much.
The athletic literally did a 6 part podcast about Andrew luck, including his retirement and luck spoke to the journalist. So if you don't like reading go check it out
Luck should be the best QB playing right now.. let that sink in
Sounds like he was conflicted. He sounds like he was unsure on his choices, but went through what was expected of him.. Glad he's getting his life where he wants it to be..
Lemme break it down Barney style Pat. Much like Dr Strange...he pondered all possible futures and the only one he saw himself living life in a way he could assure he would be there fully for his family making/keeping commitments to those he loved was one where he hung up his pads. So he did.  Good on him.
Reading and Comprehension are two very different skills. But they sure go well together.
Its ok that your heart is no longer in it just stop making excuses already and say you quit.
Click bait bs video acting like he would come on your show
Luck had it bad man.. I remember wondering how he kept getting back up, then he retires and they accumulated one of the best OL in league that had to seem like a kick in the nuts to Matt.. in my opinion ...great show as always
I still think Shefter and the media did him dirty announcing his retirement just before kick in the preseason
if you're literally the best at something you're going to have to neglect and suck at some other things, i respect he realized that and decided to be good at all facets of life rather than being great at one thing while being mediocre at other things because there's only so much time in a day.  also, i'm blown away at pat's inability to comprehend that paragraph
Most fathers are working and don't see there kids as much as they want. Hahaha
Dude was a weakass
Tom Brady take notes 🗒️ 😂
Nah. There are some writers that use a lot of words just to say nothing. White noise.
Not a Colts fan, but always liked Luck. I truly hope everything is working out great for him. Its sad not to see him on the field anymore, but life is much bigger than just football.
The only complaint was he did it right at the beginning of the season.. but obviously, mad respect - he was a beast with no fear.
Luck could go down as one of the greatest what “ifs” of all time. He chose to be a father and husband, he felt like that was more important than the grueling schedule of the nfl. Than you have Tom Brady who yes is the greatest of all time but also chose to be single with three kids with two different women and still playing just to play! He has nothing to accomplish anymore. Just shows who is a better person.
Love that Brady can be praised for throwing a tempter tantrum on the sideline as "passionate" but any other player and it becomes a maturity/professionalism issue
2:50 this jab at Connor is really just unnecessary, Pat. Then, Connor drops bars at 12:30
Wow
If he actually lived for football, he’d have multiple MVPs and be a hall of  famer. He was never as committed as most other staring QBs
They made it sound like his wife wears he pants in that house. Hey, as long as he is happy, more power to him!
Out of all that text and read Andrew Said Nothing. He told everyone the reason why he retired before he actually retired people just don't want to listen or refuse to listen. He said "If I have to go through this cycle of injury, rehab, injury rehab etc then I'm going to stop. The Joy that I have for game is gone because of this cycle.
So he’s coming back 😮😮
Luck is far wiser man than brady. Chose family over ego and football. Good call.
Luck is a quitter no respect for him and he took over 20million from the colts on the way out
Cant blame em, i got back problems and ide trade anything to not have em if u aint got health u really ain't got nothing....its tough and toughness onky goes so far...being able to walk when ur older not in pain is worth it, enjoy retirement.
His troubles started by staying in school an extra year to avoid going to the Panthers- The Panthers then had to settle for the scrubb Cam Newton- The Panthers had such a great D it carried Cam to a SB- That could have been Andrew and I promise u, he would have beaten the Broncos, winning the SB and still be playing today- such a shame
This is interesting to see
Andrew luck took too many hits and was injured seriously. He done because of the injuries he had. He was a great quarterback.
So he’s a simp that couldn’t make his own choices and his wife wears the pants in the relationship basically.
Easy Pat. It was the 2012 season when Pagano had to step away and you guys lost to Baltimore in the Wild Card round.
Don't even get married till football is over hahah most guys are only 30 anyways when it's over
No other success can compensate for failure in the home.  Not saying that playing football and having a good family isn’t possible, but if you have to choose one or the other, should always pick your family.
Yeah that’s just a terribly written paragraph
Opposite of brady lol
I did read the article, it sounds like his plan is to get a Masters in Education and teach and coach high school football. The overall gist I got was that he still loves the game, wants to impact young people's lives but as a youth coach.
I'm confused by your timeline here Pat. I really don't want to disagree with you since you played for the Colts during this time, lol. However, it seems like you're saying you guys went to the AFC championship Luck's rookie year, when Chuck got cancer. You mentioned deflategate. If so, then I think you mixed up some details. You guys went to the AFC championship in Lucks 3rd season in 2014, where deflategate was born. I'm probably just misunderstanding what you said...
What I got from the Wickersham article is that Andrew Luck just wanted to be a regular family man and NFL Football just kept him from being able to do that, but he loved it too much to throw it away until he finally did.  And I think he never talked about it until now is because he knew that the decision was so difficult that if he talked about it publicly, people would be able to talk him out of it
To be fair, it was his third year. Rookie year we lost to the Ravens in Wild Card. Second year we lost to the Pats in the Divisional Round, then next year we beat Peyton in Denver and then went to New England for the AFC Championship. Defense and O line consistently let Andrew Luck down throughout his career and Grigson’s team building strategy throughout his career was criminal.
It's pretty simple for that kind of guy.  Football is just a game, life is not.
Luck you SOB !!!! I invested in your rookie autos hoping you’d come back out of nowhere but  noooooooo……🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Sounds to me like his wife asked him to “let her in” and he was shouldering the load entirely on his own which then caused a rift in their relationship as he was mental drained from the constant abuse he was getting. Retirement not the answer, communication with his wife/therapist/colts owner would have sufficed
"...Stharted to thell them stories...". The phonetic "T" is not pronounced with a "th" sound.
Pat could read books on tape for me man. Make it happen. Expand the brand
He was the prototype  But the nicest guy at the same time
Tom Brady needs to have a conversation with Luck, maybe Luck could knock some senses into Tom 🤷🏽‍♂️
They shut that thing DOWN when it sounded like she might be controlling lol
He made the wrong choice because he chose a woman over being great with a woman could leave him tomorrow
As a chiefs fan that cursed at even the mention of Luck’s name after the 2013 Wildcard game, it was heartbreaking when he retired. You can tell that his spirit was broken, that he didn’t want to leave, but he had to. Andrew Luck is definitely my biggest What If in NFL history. Dude had everything you could want from a QB, but years of him being neglected by Pagano and Grigson finally took their toll
As a colts fan, it was beautiful to watch him play and his passion as he played. I blame Grigson and Pagano for him being ruined.
See : Existentialism
19:10 Couldn't have said it better myself
I fell in love with luck when I saw him throw that bomb of a pass on his pro day! Cheered for him and the colts even tho I’m a Bucs fan. He gave everything he had on the field wish they would have got him an Oline to keep him healthy he would have gotten rings for sure.
More and more players will retire early. Makes sense. If your a QB that already made 70 or 100 Million Dollars then why keep getting abused? You can walk away and enjoy your 30s and save your brain. Throw that away for what, a trophy?
Brady will be doing lots of crying once Niners defense choke him out
Y’all didn’t go to the afc championship game his rookie year y’all lost in the wild card
Andre Luck will be the Colts QB next year. I would bet on it. He has had one toe in the nfl for a long time. He will be back.
One thing about beards .  it makes you want to retire.
Luck is the anti-Tom Brady and I support it all the way.
Luck made 40 million. Im sure enhanced his clarity. I love football and in my head, I say that I would never give it. But, I'm not getting hit by 300+lb monsters. Seems like he made the right decision for him and his family.
Andrew Luck is a soft daddies boy, that’s why he packed it in early.
If he kept playing I believe he would have had a Stafford career arc but we'll never know....
Get him on the show. Hahs abaht it boys
You can't believe a word that comes out of shams mouth.
Colts made it to afccg in luck’s 3rd year not rookie year
GrEAT Show love it. Andrew is a great person. Colts fan here
Love the lensa thumbnail
Luck had so much potential.
If Luck had played for a team that had prioritized him and given him the protection he deserved, he was HoF bound.  The worst thing that happened to Luck was being drafted by Indy.  Luck was one of the best and the game misses him.
This explanation gives me closure
Mac: How long did it take you to read this thing? Ty: About 35-40 minutes Conner: Jeeeaazzuss. FML Dead
Brady threw better with the inflated balls, lol. Rodgers said he overinflated balls. Its an equipment violation, $25K.
Glad to see he chose his own personal life and mental health over life changing injuries from playing in the nfl
Biggest losers in all sports were the colts fans that booed him that day.
Would love to see him come back even if it’s only a few years
What i remember is that the fans were boooing luck those sick fans are cowards
🤍💙🤍💙🤍💙🤍💙🤍   💙  *ANDREW LUCK*   💙 🤍💙🤍💙🤍💙🤍💙🤍
I love the push back on the 'spending time with my family'... "150mln... I mean,  for 4 and 1/2 months, suck it up!... [she's a big time producer] so, one person job is..." XD, nowhere else you I'll ear this, even though it's what everybody thinks...
After spending 45 minutes on the article, I want to add a few things to further clarify for the show.  1. The article definitely made it seem like he had completely fallen out of love with the game when he left. The author said that the only football-related things he had in his home were almost entirely from his days at Stanford.  2. I could be wrong on this, but I don’t remember there being so much a formal ultimatum given by his wife as it was she was prepared to leave him if he would not let her in to help. As the guys talked about she was very accomplished in her own right, and she had more than her fair share of injuries, so she felt like she should be able to help him. But as he’s always been, he’s never let himself be vulnerable, he’s always said he’s okay when he’s not, and it was clear to her that he was just putting up a stone wall around himself because he wanted to appear strong as a defense mechanism. This was eating at their relationship and she kept pushing him to open up to her, and he finally did and it seems like it saved their relationship. This did not immediately lead to him retiring, this was when he went to holland for physical therapy. He also first started talking to a therapist immediately after this.   Sorry for the length, but I hope this helps clarify a few things. Ty and Conner did a great job covering the article, but it’s hard to get everything with an article of that size when you’ve got so many other things to cover. Love the show!
Sounds like a beta not an alpha
connors face when pat said he attempted to read the article...
I am glad that I was able to see Luck live once. It was only a preseason game in Seattle but I was close enough to see him clearly. I will never forget that.
Should have asked for a trade. Wickersham needs an editor.
Andrew Luck might have been the best ambassador the NFL has ever had. The ultimate teammate and role model.
Andrew Luck was the Dirk Nowitski of the NFL, everyone loved him, his loyalty and his humility.
Sounds like he gave up his career to appease his boss babe wife
I would take Ski Patrol Luck over a Yeti on that damn mountain!
He chose being a father and husband over a quarterback. That is called being a man. Good on you Andrew, i wish nothing but the best!
I wonder how different the Colts would be if He stuck around?
A sad story. Joe Burrow... you're next.
When Luck retired he told the media that he was battling with inuries + physiology of injury and finally decided it was not what he wanted for himself in the end.
Pat you are a good reader , suprise suprise
He had an existential crisis :(
Chose a good relationship with his wife and kids over a football career. Sounds like he's a great guy and made the right decision
Miss him. Wish he didn’t retire…wish we took better care of him.
That quote definitely is written to draw the reader into Luck's state of mind. It's supposed to be nearly incoherent.
Being born and raised in Indianapolis, IN … Luck holds a very special place in my heart . The part that wants to beat his ass for how terrible we have been since he left
Luck out of left field. I'm coming back F#$% off Matt Ryan
I have no ties to the Colts at all. I’m a Ravens fan, and I was super annoyed that Luck had to retire because he didn’t have a top tier OLine.
Andrew Luck made the AFC championship in his 3rd season. His rookie year (when pagano got leukemia) ended in the wild card vs the Super Bowl ravens
Hey Jethro do a few more "goes intas" on the deflated footballs you moron. Oh yea, and Rodgers is cheating on you, allegedly
Pat love your show man good stuff -- Thanks for being awesome and keeping it real
i hope luck peace happiness
Deflated footballs? Come on. TB12 owned the colts😉
Andrew Luck / TY made me a Colts fan
I'll never forget when the fans.... his fan base... the Colt fan base.... booed him. Andrew Luck, the Colts Quartback whom put himself out there for that team and fan base. I'm a 49er fan and man Andrew Luck was fun to watch during his career. I hope he is enjoying his retirement because the Colts fan base doesn't deserve such a great QB.
His twitter civil war page was hilarious
That excerpt from the article on Luck sounded like a university application essay from someone who thinks they're way smarter than they really are...overwritten drivel.
Andrew luck is a coward, and quit on his team nine days befor a season...
So…..yoko situation plus injuries ? Bummer
I’m a patriots fan and I miss Luck as a competitor he was a true leader on and off the field
Pat was so high he forgot afc championship was year 3 lol
Josh Allen + Justin Herbert = Andrew Luck
He said ‘will it be worth it’?
Boys. Boys. Let's cut down on the background echo. Sounds like I'm in a high school auditorium. Love everything about the thunder dome. And love the segments with COACH AND the other football big brains! Big fan. Just being honest.
I miss him. He was a must watch.
It definitely still sucks that he retired. Definitely was a special guy but very happy that he’s doing good. Guy deserves it
ChuckStrong that season.
We already knew why he retired tho this is not breaking news
I hope he is living a great life and that his wife is at home as much if not more than he is.
Conner attempted to read it... lmao
I think Pat’s history is a little messed up. Colts didn’t make the AFCCG for the first few years in Luck’s career
I vaguely remember Andrew Luck announcing his retirement mainly because he was injury prone over the past half decade!
the deflated footballs didn't do anything ha
He is a quitter. That’s a fact.  It’s the timing I had issue with.
Pat your memory sucks
Figure it out
Thanks for your show.
He didn’t have an o-line and took way too many hits
Had to be yeeessirrrrr who deyyy
1st
love the show
I miss him 😞
First
Damn !
