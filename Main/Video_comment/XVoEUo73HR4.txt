Wishing you both the best with your relationship & the future together.You both are so cute together
Love you guys so much you’re so sweet together
Can’t wait to see her!!
Where is he going?
She ain’t waiting brother. She’s in college someone will scoop her up
God is good 🙌🏽🤍
I don’t get the we will see. He seems to be so ready to marry her as soon as he gets back but this is now twice she has said we shall see or is there a future with us? I’m so confused I hope their relationship last if that’s the will of God!
omg you guys are so brave and just set a loving image you love each other so much and we respect that
Where in Brazil are you serving
Love you guys ❤🤍
Nice
He’ll miss the birth of his neice.
Distance makes the heart grow fonder ❤
all the best in future
Break up
Love is not just a feeling. Love is an action and if yall just continue to be intentional and continue to choose each other then it will all work out! Remember your “why.” Praying for yall!
Very Lovely coupale
Hiiii
👍
Nice video
GOD LOVES YOU
👍
Dude Deegan going to be slipping in her bedroom Window while your away lol
Wondarfull
Guys, you are so beautiful, young, cheerful and happy.  May it always be so.  Keep delighting your subscribers with new interesting projects
If military spouses can do it yall can do it
I cant wait to see in 2 years the video when u guys come back! It will fly by Kes trust in God use this time to draw closer to him and everything will follow. Matthew 6:33
Wishing you all the best the both of you
You two are so amazing really I really like and appreciate
Nice
I think she is leaving in 6 months for her mission.  So they home +- at 8/7/25.
Anyone thinking that Kes may go on a mission after the fall semester? It’s 18 months for women. So if she put papers in she could get her mission call anytime.
Wishing y’all the best and can’t wait to see y’all together again when he comes home 🫶🏼🙏🤍
You two are so amazing. Love you <3
my cousin went to Brazil and after 2 years it was crazy how fast it felt
I’m so so happy he is going and he’s getting that opportunity but I bet I’m not the only one who’s so so excited for that two years to be over
Very nice
Good
My aunt and uncle just got called to be mission leaders in Brazil, and my cousin got called for his mission in Brazil
I'm watching and supporting you, you've grown into such a wonderful woman and it's been a pleasure watching you with Brock over the years!! Be strong! Do what makes you feel closer to each other. Write in a journal what you want to say to him/her and don't forget to tell him/her. It's also important for Casey that you keep yourself busy! Then at the end of the trip you can exchange journals and read a few entries when you reunite before bed each night.
I love your guys relationship and I’m so glad I’ve been here through it all 🥰 since you met at the movies before you were even a couple. You both got this and I can’t wait until wedding bells bc I know in my heart it’s gonna happen. Love you kes
Maybe it sounds a bit odd but you guys could both buy a diary and every time you want to call the other one to tell something, you write it down and after the mission you exchange the books. So no thought or experience get lost 😊
My bf leave to Brazil too, on August 14th.  I'm nervous f9r the next two years too
I waited and dated while my missionary was gone and that was 46 years ago. We could mail letters and talk 2x a year, and that was at his parents house. No personal phone calls! All I can say, is that waiting for a missionary is not easy, but it is TOTALLY worth it! I dated, but every guy knew I was waiting for my guy!! I worked and went to school and stayed busy. We set 10 goals together that kept us strong and bound together. The #1 goal was to get married in the temple when he got home and we actually set a date! He got home on Sept. 21st and we were married Nov. 16th! You can do this! My advice is to stay positive in your calls and letters, and to not be overly "mushy". Talk about your goals and what you are doing to achieve them. This is going to be a hard 2 years but the best 2 years that will bless your lives EVERY SINGLE DAY AFTER! We now have 5 married children and 21 grandkids with one on the way! You've got this!
👍
Nyc
I know those two years will fly by.❤️ Brock have an amazing time at your mission and Kelsey will we be here to support you and be with you! ❤️❤️❤️
You guys can do anything! The universe put you back together for a reason. I believe you both will get through this and come out even stronger ❤️❤️
You are so amazing!❤ And I believe that you can cope with such a long time of beenig away from each other, it will be a really good tool for both in the future!
Good luck brock
Distance makes the heart grow fonder ❤❤❤❤
HE BETTER PROPOSE!!! When he comes backk
Can you help pur church
Good luck Brock ❤and to you both You can do it guys
your all very special to me
Nice
Wishing you all the best, the both of you
When is he leaving 🥺
Good luck
Ahh! You 2 are the cutest and I hope it’s a happy ending. I believe it can be❤ Kesley are you going on a mission? You guys can get through this
My daughters bf is in Japan for 2 years with the military.  He’s been gone a year, it goes by so fast.  Y’all have this.
Your relationship will ABSOLUTELY be blessed and strengthened by him serving a mission. Also, don’t forget to write letters to each other every now and then. I cherish the letters I got from my husband and they’re so fun to re-read. ❤
I just realised brock I not coming back until 2025❤
You guys got this. You've been together so long and known each other so long. Good luck Brock.
Just keep remembering that the Mission is spiritual growth for both of you. It will help Brock grow and become ready for leading your future family on your path of partnership.
story time: when my dad was on his mission he was deeply in love with a girl, hed been dating for 3 years. well… right before coming home, he got dear johned. years went by and the girl he loved, sent him an invitation to their wedding😂 of course my dad didnt go, but the lord led his feet to my mom and now we’re a family of 7. life with take you places, and everything may change, but it will all be okay. total support in your decision brock!! so excited to hear your future stories!! love ya both.
I think we all thought you would’ve got married after hs😅😢❤❤
I’m loving the past two comments here. My 4 brothers served missions and I was so young but and I don’t remember much but I do remember my brother was serving in Colorado Springs and my other brother wanted to visit and take him and his companion to dinner well my brother showed up at his apartment and my brother was in the shower and I don’t what all happened but basically the 3 went to dinner and my brother visiting got food poisoning it’s like we’ll maybe you weren’t suppose to be there or take him dinner. 2 years seems long but trust me it will go by fast! Especially Kelsey if your doing your shop and school and have cousins they will distract you and I know you’ll have down days but it’s worth it!
I have one question will Brock be filming during his mission? I just want to know. You don’t have to answer if you don’t want too.
Me being Brazilian you guys will get there
I love yall 💗 kes stay strong!  I k the long distance relationship isn't always easy and fun !  But  God is with both of you ❤️ best wishes on Brock & his mission
i did the netflix party with my friend’s during covid. we would ft and use the chat.
I was hoping that Brock would propose before he left so you had two years to plan your wedding and something huge to look forward to! But I know that you guys can do it regardless 💗
💯🤍 PERFECT COUPLE 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👼🏼👱🏻👱🏻‍♀️✨😍🔥❤️
❤
Hi guys I love you so much 💘❤🎉😅😊
Brock should’ve proposed before, or give a promise ring so she knows
As a military significant other, YOU GOT THIS!!!!
when she said she may have something up her sleeve i automatically thought she would join the mission after the 6 months since girls only go for a year and a half 😭😭
The 2 years are gonna fly by and you both will be in each other’s arms again
He’s leaving for a good reason so hopefully feelings don’t get lost. Doing something productive and keeping your mind at ease will go by fast and you will see him very soon! If your the type not to think about guys and and not get lonely easily it’ll all work out for you both. It just wouldn’t be fair to Brock as well if kes moved on after he’s doing something for the better. Going to church will be nice that way you get prayed over and so you don’t worry. I just say keep god #1 and you both feelings stronger than ever ❤️
Whenever I see you two it reminds me of my husband and I. We were together 5 years before we got married. I was waiting for him to graduate and turn 18 so we could get married. I’m so proud of both of your sacrifices and strength to be able to get each other through this. Nobody said it would be easy but in the end it will all be worth it ❤ see you in 2! And Kes, if you ever need to talk let me know. I’m local
Think of how amazing it'll feel when he lands in 2 years. You'd have been together 6 years, with so so many exciting times and landmarks ahead of you. Only up from here ❤
Y’all made me fell single in 1000 different ways y’all are the cutest couple love y’all ❤
The support you exude shows how much you care and lean on God for the journey. All in his plan. 🤍
Why don't you go to mission too?
Good luck Brock  my prayers are with you....
Remember Acts 2:38 and John 3:5.
Why did you not go with Brock on the mission trip
Good luck Brock! Way to go Kess! Can't wait to watch y'alls journey in the next 2. ❤❤❤
It’s like army when they get there they can call their family and then they have to write their letters until they’re finished. Where is there training and everything and then when they go to another state then they get their phones back because I had two brothers in the army, but his is different
I have a question how is Brock going to do school?
we are all rooting for y'all!!! been watching & supporting you since the very beginning Kesley, you have matured into such a wonderful woman and seeing you with Brock over the years has been a joy to watch!! I'm excited to see where this goes and I cannot wait to hear about the updates he sends. YALL GOT THIS!!!! <3
You too got this two years will fly by I hope!😉
Kesley, you’re handling this in a very mature way!
It’s so sad that Brock has to go for 2 years but it’s gonna go by fast
Thankyou for being so open and honest with us 💕 Wishing you all the best, the both of you ☺️☺️
anytime you guys have an idea to tell each other, write it down and put it in a box so when he’s back you guys can go through them together!
The first year will be the hardest, the last year is just the countdown 😍❤️
"I kinda know how to say how are you..i just dont know how to say how..or are" 😂
Kesley,  I am not sure if this will help you or not, but I had to go a full month without talking to a guy.... it was really hard. I was tempted to message him, but one thing that would help me the most, would be scrolling through his and I messages. It really did help me and just kind of distract me. Not sure if it will work for you, but I hope! I know you can do it, you're so strong! <3
My now husband and I when he was in his mission we shared a google photos and it was a life saver. We made little vlogs and stuff that we would send on Monday. We also did audio messages through email on Mondays too! Idk. Hope that helped you.
I absolutely love the relationship you 2 have. I feel that Brock is going to change quite a lot and grow through this mission experience. But just remember he is doing God's work, so God will be looking out for him and his loved ones. If you 2 are meant to be together in God's almighty plan (which I personally believe is true from what I've seen of you) He will strengthen you both and strengthen your relationship throughout these 2 years. I pray for you both, that God will shine down on you every day that you're apart until you're reunited in 2 years, and then beyond. I can't wait to see what's ahead for you 2. God bless you. 🙏😁💛
You guys got this! Everything will work out. Good luck Brock! Everyone who watches your channels are rooting for you guys. All the best to both of you.
Stay strong!❤ two years will go by fast!❤
I hope the best for the both of them there such good people I’m sure kesley is gonna miss as Brock a lot
Kesley you and Brock are sooooo cute together and my heart hurts for you guys seeing that you guys said goodbye and I just know that those 2 years will go by so fast I will always be here for you guys❤️🥺🥰🙂😩🩷❤️‍🩹💗and you’re so goregous kesley ❤️🙂🥰🥺❤️‍🩹🩷😭😍
Omg that was me on the last question I asked that question on your instagram I’m so happy 😂 I love you both it will be worth it at the end
I’m in long distance relationship and we watch movies together or games until see each other again
I wanna know how it’s going to be for him to be away from his twin it’s also going to be hard for them 😭😭😭😭😭
🌟🌟🌟🌟❤❤❤❤my heart has been telling me your true love for each other will get you both threw this 🌟🌟🌟🌟❤❤❤❤❤ I’m here for the long haul and watch you 2 get married 🌟🌟🌟🌟❤❤❤❤❤
Are you able to send him things? Like a care package?
honestly the way I see it is, if soldiers can go months and years with limited to no communication with their spouses, y’all can make it. I believe that this will make yalls relationship so much better and y’all will last. It’s gonna be very very hard but y’all got this, everyone is rooting for y’all!
I thought y'all was going to get married after high school until Brock said he was going on a mission & I can see Kesley thinking about going on a mission after fall semester
My cousin just got back from his mission 2 weeks ago and I get to see him next week.
Went a year and 1/2 not seeing my boyfriend and honestly it’s hard at first but the days turn to weeks months and you catch yourself in a routine, he’s home now and I can say I think it made us stronger ❤
I have a feeling Kesley will go on a mission after her fall semester of college
You guys are LITERALLY THE CUTEST COUPLE ❤
ya'll are so cute together I love ya'll
Y’all gonna be just fine! You’re so much more mature I’ve been watching since before your relationship and I can see Brock coming home from his mission less than six months later an engagement and eventually a baby! Please travel or enjoy your relationship first but yes I see you around for the long haul 😂❤🎉 safe travels to you Brock!
What if Brock gets home sick to where he can’t focus on the mission. What will he do then?
I’m sad for you guys! ❤
the way y'all look at each otherrr!
I have a feeling kesley is gonna go on a mission after the fall semester! Then they will both finish at the same time!
Married 30 years to my husband that I waited for during his church mission! We were together 2.5 years, he was in Dallas for 2 years and we were married 10 months later.   I left Mormonism 7 years ago, but I just had to let you know it IS possible!
My bf will be leaving for a mission next year! This video was definitely very helpful:)
This will also put a test to your relationship. If you can make it two years away with small contact. You can make it through about anything.
Brock your amazing, so excited that your going to spread the word of god. Your relationship with Kelsey will grow stronger over this
How come your brother isn’t going with you or does he have to at a different time?
The fact that kesley is mature to admit they have their faults and how they work through them and admit that social media only portrays the good side and then there’s Brock “ yeah…yeah ….yeah ……yeah ..”😅
Oh Kes I'm so sorry gorgeous girl I know how hard it is my heart hurts for you guys I just know that 2 years will go by so fast I'm always here for you guys If you ever need me just know that!!!!!!
Awesome Video! I love your channel keep up the good work girl Kes your Stunning!!! Your smart, fun, loving, caring, loyal, generous, thoutful, kindhearted, Incredible, compassionate person ever I Love You Guys So So Much!!!!!!!
It makes me sad Brock will miss his niece being born :( she’ll be a toddler when he comes home😢
I’m actually Portuguese❤️
So I was in a long distance relationship, and something I can say for a fact is you will cherish the moments you have together so much more!
I know its going to be so hard for you both but you guys definitely have gotten stronger and i know you guys will be strong through it!  You guys are seriously so cute!
You could both get journals and write down things that you want to tell the other!!! or Kesley can send Brock text throughout the week so he can read them on the day he has the phone!!!
❤❤
Hi Kelsey This is Nate I love your volgs and i started watching in 2017 but it was the Leroy’s and I am Brazilian, Polish, and Lebanese so my Mom is fully Brazilan and my grandma and grandpa on my moms side are fully Brazilian and my great grandma and great grandpa on my grandma side and grandpa side are fully Brazilian so me and Brock are Twins kinda my grandma on my dads side is polish and my grandpa on my dads side is Lebanese
Nice video
by the way they also movie party's have that on prime video and disney+
I feel like she would go On a mission as well, and that would be awesome as well ❤
I’m rooting for you guys!! And good luck Brock!!! 🤍
You guys should have dairies and write everything down that happens in your life, then swap it out just like a comment was mentioned about that in here. It is a brilliant idea.
hang in there kes!!!!!!! you’re soooo strong!!! these next 2 years will FLY by!!!!!! i’m so glad y’all can facetime and text on his off days!!!! i’m proud of you brock and good luck! you both be safe these next two years have incredible things in store for the both of you!!
Kelsey you should start a 2 year journal. Everyday write to him what you would text him and then give it to him when the 2 years are over 😭😭🫂🤍🤍🤍✨✨✨
kes are you coutdown the day and mouths until he get home in usa
I think it’s great that he’s going to Brazil! Have fun at Brazil❤
You should still text him over the next two years so when he comes home he sees all the messages
My cousin went to Brazil on a mission
My brother is on a mission in Fresno California
i used to be mormon when i was little but i’m not anymore but i’m happy for you guys and i’m glad brock’s excited 😊 i love you Kes ❤
my boyfriend is also going on a mission and im moving away to college, it’s so hard but it’s comforting to know that someone else is in the same boat as me
Good luck brock and you will do great 👍 and I will miss Brock in your videos
KESLEY if you would like advice about long distance relationships check out Sam and Monica. Sam is her husband now but he was originally  her boyfriend from the uk. Monica is a US citizen who lives in  New  York  when they were first dating.
the way he looks at her omg
if kelsey went on own she should go the same time as brock so then they wouldn’t be bored and would have something to do and lesley would only have to wait 6 months ❤😊
I believe this will make you stronger, even if things chance, I also believe Jesus has a plan you both. I believe with all my heart is keep on praying for each other and things will work out. I also think if you both get though this, y'all can continue to  grow with each other.  Just keep the FAITH and Pray. Things will work out for the good.
Hopefully Brock gets to see Rhett when he graduates high school. Good luck Brock on your mission. Too bad that your gonna be back when I graduate high school.
i rember whne they were younger and dating ❤❤
Maybe it sounds a bit odd but you guys could both buy a diary and every time you want to call the other one to tell something, you write it down and after the mission you exchange the books. So no thought or experience get lost 😊
Is Brock still going the vlog
I wonder if what she’s doing after fall semester might be going on a mission as well!
That was an insane rabbit hole.  Saw the two years and I was like hold up mission.  Also that’s crazy I also got called to Brazil and start my mission in 12 days
This is definitely going to be harder on Kes than Brock - Brock he will be so busy there..I pray they make it through and I believe they will. I just can’t wait for that proposal video when he returns. I believe they are meant for eachother .
God is by your side and his plans are good, he is good 🤍
I really hope you guys can get through it! You should def try and start texting & FaceTiming less so you can get used to it
What if you get home sick, like really bad.
Aww you both are the cutest couple ever! I know it will be hard at times but you both have this in the books! Just keep busy kesley. What ever god has in his plan he will show you!! I know you guys will be okay. Stay strong!!! ❤❤❤
It might would help you if you texted him a message every morning then he’ll see them when’s y’all are able to text!!🥰
Proving of Brock. Wishing him the best on his two year journey in Brazil ❤
How about college?
Why does it have to be 2 years not one.
I think it’s amazing that he’s going to brazil to spread the word about god. I know it’ll be hard for you both but you’ll get through it. Don’t worry kes, the 2 years will go by quick❤
Kes I am Whatching your old vids it’s so fun love u
Of u argue with someone it means that you are safe with that person🙂🤟🤟
Kesley should do a mission
I can see Kelsey as a cute little sister missionary
I love you Guys soo much you guys are the cutest couple ever

Kesley and Brock are literally the cutest couple ever!!! Couple goals!!! Love you both so much!! 🥰❤️🥰❤️ These next 2 years while Brock is in Brazil for his mission are literally gonna fly by so fast even tho it's gonna seem so slow. I hope he proposes when he comes back lol 😂😂  Good luck Brock in Brazil!! 🎉🥰❤️ Gonna miss you!!
Good luck
My cousins are missionaries in Brazil! We are hoping to visit them soon❤praying for you Brock❤️
46 minutes ago

Brock Will return in 2025 during middle  of summer
they still have phone calls
Aww my babies I hope you guys get married
GOOD LUCK BROCK❤
My cousin left for his mission almost two years ago, and it feels like he left last year, but he is actually coming in just a couple of months. I think this will make your relationship stronger with each other and you two will be just fine! ❤
I think you two will be alright I think it really helped with kesley being genuinely happy for him about his decision to go in a mission and the thought and care she put in to his anniversary and birthday gifts that incorporated his mission I honestly believe you two are meant for each other and it will all come together in the end good luck on your mission Brock
oh my gosh this makes me so happy i’m brazilian and i go to brazil every summer to see my family and i speak portuguese i’m soo happy he’s going there because they need it most people are catholic
Yall are so adorable together ❤❤❤❤

You two are so cute!❤❤
even tho it’s gonna be hard for you both to not see each other i know when you see each other again it will be a very special moment! bless you both!! 🩵
Hii!!! You can say “como estas?” (Although this is more used in portugal portuguese) or “tudo bem com você ?” in portuguese, so you were correct eheh spanish and portuguese are very similar. I wish you guys the best!!! ❤️ i just hope everything goes well 😊
