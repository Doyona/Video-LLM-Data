hope he does well in la manchaland
Welcome to Villa 🫶🏽
what's wrong with manchester united. there is something wrong inside them. even antony got dragged down too. they're too toxic, by selling mctominay and degea.
COME TO BEŞİKTAŞ 🖤🤍
Cometo Beşiktaş
bomboş bir oyuncu.nkoudou bile bundan  3 gömlek iyi futbolcu.

Sancho juda zor oynayasan
This guy had everything needed to become a legend at utd..bt he disappeared at utd!!!
Come to Juve, Sancho
Gareth Nobhead didn't pick him for the England squad
🎉😂❤😢😮😅😊very handsome
Sancho in prestito.
Welcome in Juventus Team, Jadon❤  With you Champions League and 2025World Team Championship is possible!!!!!
Wolcome to Galatasaray 😊
Welcome to arsenal. He will jojn 2024 season
Ему не нужен никакой Манчестер Юнайтед, он обрёл дом в Дортмунде 💛🖤💛🖤💛💪💪💪💪
I miss this sancho, best of luck in the final
Why Haaland still in the Outro💀
Tiene cosas de alexis Sanchez
Hes back 🔥🔥
Sancho pancho😂
Who is here after sancho joining bvb again? Hes back 🔥
He's a player that I admire a lot, he can come back, he's still young ❤
Solo mierda de música, de verdad no pega estás músicas con el fútbol.
Minimum grappling and smackdown in Bundesliga. In Premier League, you won't get carded unless you break someone legs. Sancho doesn't suit the barbaric PL.
Arron Lennon junior 🎉
really bad attitude
Hes bsck in Dortmund
People Who Came To Watch this After Sancho Rejoined Dortmund 😊
honestly, 3 seasons later, I can re-watch this video with a complete feeling of happiness. 🟨⬛️🐝
He's returns
chẳng có xíu tốc độ nào ở đây
he's back guys
He could have done that at Man Utd, but his mentality destroyed him, or smt else, who knows!
Oh please give me a break. Just because he played in a farmer's league in Germany does not make him a good player.  This kid is average at best. This kind of show boating will not work in the Premier League.
Welcome to barçelona broo❤🎉
Miss him come back to Dortmund 💛🖤
He is so good..only ten hag dont know how to appreciate a talented footballer like sancho.. wish you well in man.u sancho
Sancho prime
He should come to Liverpool
What happened 😢
cầu thủ trong fo4 dạt vô cầu nhanh đóng mạnh
Good, but extremely underrated
This would have happend  , it is all because of the club , if you think not look the the charlie savage's interview
To bad he didn't leave up to his potential at Manchester united I really wish he leaves and rebuild his career I can't believe my club killed his potential
wish he never went to United
Sancho if he could actually be arsed
Sancho Reus Haaland what a attack😢
didn't know he was that good...he completely flopped at man utd
Welcome to juve
Such a shame he couldn't reach his best form at United. Hopefully he will go back to Dortmund.
😂😂😂😂😂😂
Man UTD not match his level 😂
Who is to blame? Manchester United have never seen this level from him. Real shame ..
The way he dribbled here, his speed, and control of the ball is the opposite to what he has offered to Man utd, no wonder Ten Hag might be right about him on becoming lazy in training, I just hope he can revive his form back
This man was been a beast, WTF United did him?
Come on Dortmund let's bring him back home, he was literally our Messi. If we had him last season we would have won BL title... And we would have a huge chance of winning the UCL.
This sancho didnt arrive at man utd
So much potential, yet can’t even be on the bench now. Hope he moves to another club and show his worth.
Who is here? After Discussion between ETH and him
The song🎉
Man went from generational talent to generational 007
The first song is called
Where is he 😂
Where has this Sancho gone...😢
Bundesliga is a much easier league than the Premier League, as simple as that.
Trash
Was he faster back then😂
Its June 2023, just here to confirm that Manchester United finishes players
Poochester united has ruined another talent
His whole play style is built on confidence, he needs to work on mindset
Where is this Sancho when you need him at man United this guy was legit
Where this Sancho?
Knp sekarang dia g pede untuk melakukan skil² individu nya yah??
Almost forgot how well he can play
Do u want him back 😂😂😂
After seeing this I knew bundesliga is easy and premiere league is more harder.
But what happened to him at United?
I'm seeing basic dribbles here nothing outstanding. It's the ice cold finishing which impresses me. He's so cool in front of goal like he has all the time in the world
So sad EPL fans are  yet to experince his Sancho
I remember this Guy... It's January 2023 and I pray he can get back to his best.. That controlled pace is very rare but needs serious confidence which he's lost (at the time of writing)
If anybody could ressurect him ,it would be Ten Hag.
BRO What happen to Sancho!! 😭GOD PLEASE I NEED THIS SANCHO BACK AT MANUTD
I love you sancho
I waiting Sancho come back for Manchester  United.
dortmund should try to sign him again .
What’s happened to him at Manchester United. Such a quality player!
This video really hurts me now as a Man United fan! I really wish him to comeback and shine for us, As he did for Dortmund!
🔥🎉🔥💯🔥❤️🔥
Who’s here now that he is flopping hard at united 😂😂😂
now he is a flop at United
his skills are far better then CR7
Man is godlike
volta pro borussia sancho 😢🟡⚫️🇧🇷
How I wish he plays like this in Manchester United but now guy is struggling 😔 Guy can't even do a 1v1 😔💔
What has happened to him
Back when he could play football
Frankly, he's a bad footballer. He can't even break through the dribble, he just passes to both sidebacks. He's also bad at shooting. Rashford is also a bad footballer. Rashford is stupid, but he dribbles through and do strong shoots. So Rashford is better than Sancho. Manchester United can't win with bubbles.
Where’s this sancho gone man
Never seen anyone nutmeg as effortlessly as Sancho
He is yet to arrive in manchester
man u gonna transfer him back to dortmund for free like everyone else that failed at man u specifically
It's so heartbreaking look at Sancho playing for Dortmund and at United he seems lost and his form is gone 🥺💔
He's gone invisible at utd. I hope we see the Dortmund Sancho at utd.
Epl is hard
One year later on MU
Football is the best
He was beast at dortmund hope in United he will found his form
Mano e louco demais como o borussia sempre conseguem fazer esses cara do nada jogar muita bola,ex:sancho,dembele,réus,lewandoviski(perdão não escrever o nome dele)halland,aubameyang,gotze e entre outros
My only worry is his pace. Hopefully he's got enough guile to make up for it
First song?
what a music?
Best player
YouTube cn be deceiving, he isn't performing at man u
Sancho my cousin from Mexico baby
music?
Sanch better than ronaldo
what song is this iys amazing
He made a mistake going to Manchester United (not because of the club or fans though).  I do hope it works out for him.  I think Ten Haag (if he becomes Manchester United’s manager, that is) will give him more game time.
Don’t know why he went utd, they not really good at producing young talent. Should’ve stayed at dortmund and develop a little bit more like Jude is doing
God how much we miss you at Dortmund
Bu mu 85  💶  yazık
:v
Song?
1:49 name skill ???
Shame he went to united, they're the best at destroying young talent.
vvvv
This lad is to much for other teams😂😂😂
Топ

He found it so, so, so, so tough in Premier league. Bundesliga is a farmers league. He might end up a journeyman in league 1 in a couple seasons, that's how tough the Prem is.
Seen hundreds like him in Spanish second division . He is nothing special!!!
exceptional talent tho
yo make the videos longer
He is incredible but I think it was far too early for him to return to England. He should have stayed in Germany or moved to Spain to sharpen his skills further
he's a brilliant player
I know he'd get his form like this for man utd
I'm dying for him to rediscover this form for man united
Came here after winning my matches in PES with Sancho.
MU, how are u?)
here after his first Man United goal. What a player
He's too slow
New youngster 💪💪💪💪  Jadon shanco 💖 Shanco Have a best Talent. Good luck For Shanco 💖
Reason why he be the best  https://youtu.be/NAMtAaurQnM
What is the song
Only if he had PT in MAN U!!!! #Ole out
Shows how poor the German league is. He is not premier league standard.
#Saveole
what have you done  ole?
shame.......Ole the Fraud is now his manager
맹구의 저주
Ole out
I had to come and check if it is the same Sancho man utd signed
Ruin his career in man utd
To all the numpty Man Utd fans who keep saying he is being played out of position, watch this video and take note. He plays on both wings, think he scored more goals while playing on the left than the right wing. It's amazing how many fans reckon that they know he is brilliant but have never actually watched him play!!!!
I’m sorry but I think the German league is way easier than premier league. I’ll be surprised if he gets half the goals and assists this season
What song?
And OLE don't know how to use this man
And Solskjaer just has him warming the bench in every match.
🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇩🇪7️⃣⚽💛🖤💣
none of these skills is working on premier league defenders
i'm starting to think bundesliga is just youth training ground after what happen to werner,havertz and now sancho .
What’s name of the rap song? The first one
He shouldn't have left Dortmund
Bundesliga is the farmer league. No doubt. Look at sancho at epl, he did nothing. 🤣
Sancho will damage is career at Manu
Mong Sancho tìm lại cảm giác tốt như này cho chặn đường phía trước
Ole needs the sack so we can see the best of this guy!
Pathetic playet with no pace
HAHAHAHAHA
Sancho is very skillful
His ídol Cr7 🤫🙏🏻💪🔥
I was never confident about Sancho.  12-18 months ago, I wondered about the hype with the over priced tag of what was it - £100m?? And I thought Utd should leave it.  Maximum bid of £40-£50m but leave it at that.  Preferably don't sign him at all.  Now they have signed him and so far, I am not being proven too wrong.  He has never performed on the international stage either.  Let's wait and see.
Utd's flop It's premier leagues managers fault, except pep they are all clueless
2months later and no new highlights in Manchester united lmao 🤣😂😆
Should just remain at Dortmund instead of going to Man Utd being a noob there
what music?
Never seen what was so special about him. In these videos he just looks average
I can’t believe people think Jack Grealish is better than THIS BEAST
where was this jaden sancho tonight then huh???
As crianças brasileiras descobrindo que não é só um jogador no mundo que sabe driblar.
SANCHOO
Overrated
...
This background music sucks..
name of the music
Sancho 💙
Waiting for him and cr7 play togather
Jadon Sancho Special Card https://youtu.be/lPozdcSKZYk
Clip this , sancho is going to ball ..., he's  form is  a blip as  for now .. he will come back

#slipperywhenwet
One more rising legend!!!
Good Luuck!!,.TheBest.to Skill Jordan Sancho'👍👍...Ajjipp Im from Indonesia.🇮🇩"🇩🇪 I love Bundes Liga,,💘🤗✌️"Peacee
As much as I am sad that Leo Messi and CR7 are getting to the end of their careers, I believe that it is healthy for us the fans..so we can enjoy all those the media forgot about when the GOAT and CR7 were conquering the universe of Football ( Soccer )..  What a pleasure to watch Jadon Sancho..Memphis Depay..and many more..   2021-2022 season is gonna be lit Y'all !!
My favourite player 😍
first name song please..if someone know
whits song is this ?
Trash music

He is forever a joy to watch. I wish you all the best at United
Welcome Sancho !!!
Can someone tell me what football boots is hearing at 00:18
Will he play well with Manchester United, Manchester United will have the pl cup
Welcome to United Road,Jadon!🔴⚪️⚫️
Man Uni will destroy souls this season you just wait lads
Great but I nearly couldn’t watch it because the music was so bad then I put it on mute 🤐
A. Sanchez was batter when he signed for man utd
Made in Dortmund and a star in Manchester just like cr7
The new Georgie Best! Welcome to Manchester Jadon!
Who is here after HERE WE GO!
We will keep safe him in United, wonderboy
gg Bundesliga, it's EPL time with Man United.💪
Whose here after he signed for Manchester
upcoming football Star !! 🥰🥰
This players gamestyle  just like hazard
Korang kena lagi dgn youtuber...confirm fan man utd tak tgk full game sancho..hanya tgk compilation je...tgk full game baru tahu..tu sbb southgate tak pilih sancho prefer saka...
I cant with the back ground music in all of these videos. Annyoing af
another flop same like kagawa mihitaryan Alexis di maria
I like the fact that as such a skillful player he doesn't go to ground easily
He remind me of robinho
As United fan I welcome him at Manchester
What a brilliant prayer Jadon Sancho
people always talking about haaland and mbappe but he forgot about jadon sancho
WELCOLME TO MANCHESTER UNITED!!!
Southgate should've watched this video
Who else came here after #MUFC announced him? I have goosebumps
Average player
WELCOE TO MANCHESTER UNITED SANCHY
Welcome to MANCHESTER UNITED, Jadon Sancho 🔥
Why did he only play 5 minutes in whole of Euro 21? England might have won
Iam from the corner of India, and I'm man utd fan
V
Music ??
he is sterling of future
That assist to Götze 3:25 is my favorite 😋  wooow can't wait to see you get along with Cavani and Greenwood next season
I hope he can do some magical skills at old tro.
I wish him all the best to Man United
B-tech Alexis Sanchez...
💚Wish him be a united legend 💚
Has potential to be the next Ronaldo/messi
Second Kagawa
Jolly good skill
Dortmund should be proud of their scouting/youth system bleeding talent such as Sancho into their first team xi year after year even after they cash in. Best in the world imo.
That kit is beautiful
Here we go. for Manchester united
Gue gk yakin main di MU bakaln kaya gitu
New CR7 has arrived in old trafford!
I hope he not have same situation like dembele 😂. Wish him the best
Sancho this summer, Haaland next summer, Bellinham in summer 2023.  Feeder club.
And still not able to start for England
Come on man u
Don’t see why players treat Dortmund as a stepping stone they could turn Dortmund back into the giants they are
African kid. Sck fu!
BVB is one of my favourite clubs but my most favourite is Liverpool.        😁😁😁
plays like Maradona
Official comp. 😭
the 2 song they used?
Really excited for this one. A player that actually wants to play for the club not just a. Player who is looking for the best option financially.
What is the first song name in begining of the video please?
This is not skills ..he is only practicing football
Best player of all time even better than Mason greenwood that already has 2957 g/a. Ofc it is city and liverpool that is going to hate on this player just because hes better than ther whole clubs .
OVERRATED
Tf is that music
I'm here after Sancho missed penalty
Why is here after Sancho missed a penalty in the final of EURO?
Song?
The romance between England and Germany. Klopp and Sancho.
Song?
Never witnessed a player play like this, he dance it’s incredible 🧚‍♀️⚽️
His first touch🔥🔥🔥
Wonder boy
"Wish him Well in Manchester United.
He is creative/inventive, very young, CONFIDENT especially in front of goal (we lack that at United at present) and can think very quick on his feet (no pun), well done United.  The new season will be that much more exciting esp since we also have Amad!
If I was sancho I’d rather be in Dortmund
HAALAND:😪
a baller !
Justice for Sancho. How Southgate doesn’t start him every game is a crime.
Welcome to Manchester United. Now, can we get Haaland too?
He will flop at man u
He is like a rolls Royce on the ball..so smooth 👌👌👌
Thanks for everything! We will take good care of him in Manchester!
What I learned from the Ukraine game was that he's not greedy for a flashy winger. He plays one touch give and go and makes intelligence decisions. Utd got themselves a baller.
Don't cry adminho
Still can't believe Dortmund failed to achieve smthng big inspite of having a creative playmaker (Sancho), a deadly finisher (Haaland) and a reasonably good team
Can't wait for him to put on the united shirt. Rashford, martial and greenwood what a strike force.
Song anyone?
Thank you Jadon 🖤💛🐝
United fan here..thanks Dortmund fans for supporting him, hope united can do justice to his talent. Fans will love him just like you did that we promise
I like bundesliga channel...they appreciate past and future players💯
We'll take care of him
If Rashford can become more consistent, we will have a madness on both wings. Greenwood developing into a proper 9 will be the cherry on top. It could become a dream trio next to next season.
Fernandes- cavani- rashford- sancho and Fred-Pogba au milieu ....ca fais saliver.
rashy, greenwood, sancho. the three lions
Welcome Jadon 😁
Rip 💔🦈!! Premier league defenders😁😁
Hope he will do this for us man
Any help with the background music?
I dont think he can play like this in premier league.
its kinda weird seeing the league official youtube channel made a compilation with this format, its like they buy it from some content creator haha.
What's with the dumb music, spoils the entire content. Sigh!
We will take care of him👍 Thank you bundesliga🙏
Welcome To Manchester United🔴🔴
I hope ole plays him sooner rather than later, ole does stupid with new players aswell
Saw him play for England the other day for first time during this Euros. He was phenomenal, not sure why Southgate waited so long to play him.
You can see he was Dortmond player  high energy  attacking pacy skills
Wadminho with the best send off. GGMU
Dortmund always product new superstars. I love this club.
ว่าที่นักเตะยอดเยี่ยมพีเอฟเอฤดูกาลหน้าและนักเตะของทีมแชมป์พรีเมียร์ลีค
Sick edit
Hope he does well at Manchester.  He's been great for Dortmund and I admire the way he's conducted himself during the transfer.  He didn't do us dirty and phone it in, and that shows class.
Wich # would he use in the ManU
0:08 Absolutely spellbinding 🤯🤯Streetballer for life ⚽️💫
何か日本人コメントがなかったら寂しい
Imagine the Premier League YT account made a player montage this cold. Props to the Bundesliga.
Welcome!
I would like to thank the germans for helping make this kid even better
Song name???
Welcome to Old Trafford ♥️
Name of the first song please
Hope he doesn't become the Man Utd version of Depay
Now at the biggest club in the world  MUFC 💕
Can’t wait too see Sancho and Rashy make their goal celebration together 😍🔥
Utd
Wish him luck to face the great defender in EPL
pogba, bruno, sancho, rashford, martial skill and skill
Thank you for giving us a preview🙏🔥🔥 Man United are excited
🔥🔥🔥
Sanchoooo
BVB helped his game so much and deserve the credit. Sancho always had the talent but they helped him excel. He will light up the premier League
Hope he won't get maimed by those players in the EPL.
Mdr, ils ont mit le même son que sur la mixtape de Pogba.
Song so good so do sancho my man
4:18 🤣
The background music does anyone have clue ?
Hope MANU didn't force him to play piano.
Bundesliga yt pr is genius. They never miss
Welcome to Manchester United!! 🔴🇾🇪
Welcome to Man Utd 🔴
Not good enough
So excited to have him at United
The chemistry between sancho,haaland and reus was wonderful going to miss the trio
The Next Lingard
Sancho Diallo Rashford Martial Greenwood James and Cavani..attack looks sorted for now with kingpins Bruno and Pogba pulling strings from behind
Overrated overhyped in my book
Now he's gonna lose his German accent
Probably 90% of the views from this vid comes from Man United fans
i dont remember the last time i've seen a daring English winger with flair. most English wingers are bland cross machines or speed merchants.
Is he really effective at rw?
HE SIGNED DA TING
What is the name of the song? 0:20
I love the way he toys with the defenders
Sanchinho!!!! England has never had a player like him.
Shock horror as sancho plays first minutes of euros day after Utd move confirmed
Wish him all the best at Manchester United, from a Chelsea fan
Bruno and Sancho  magic loading............
Noting exceptional about him, your stop overrating him, where he's going is England and not your weak German league. Till he can show his worth in England, United fans should keep quiet. He's an English player and they are very inconsistent...
Liverpool might regret not getting him.. they need a player with sublime skills n trickery.. they juz dun have any currently.
first song name?
another overrated  player  dortmund  sell  to  man utd, i  guess  he  will not able to  compete  in  a  kick, run  and  westling  football  of britain.
Cashing out before he goes to the prem lol
Good luck, best of your career
Seems like another Fernandez is on the way.
Money well spent United 🔥🔥🔥🔥
I think Man Utd got him at a steal price....
Welcome to real madrid in 2024
Imagine he stayed at city
Bvd and Ajax always produce young stars only to have big teams buy them
2.06 song name please
His shooting and finishing style reminds me kaka
We are going to ruin him
They prolly made this video for man utd fans
He didn't have to leave
First song: Nbhd Nick - Add It Up
Санчо наш!!!! GGMU
Waiting GGMU
Why do I get the feeling that he will outshine Foden!!
Can't wait to watch him to play for us! ♥️💯
Playing against farmers
Good luck Sanch, looking forward to you gracing the Old Trafford turf and becoming a legend 👏
Remember kids....Timo Werner and Naby Keita looked like world beaters against the cannon fodder teams in the Bundesliga...Both look like amateurs in the Premier League. Sancho is another Bundesliga hype job. Gareth Southgate has seen through it.
Watch ole not  play him lol
Looks a great player hope England give him a game he could make the difference.
he's no good
Welcome to United JAD⚽N S🅰NCHO  THANKS TO DORTMUND IMPROVED SANCHO POTENTIAL
England captain Harry Kane has vowed to ‘give it everything’ to honour the memory of Charlie Naughton who tragically passed away earlier this week while watching the Three Lions’ historic win over Germany at Wembley.
Could anyone give me link of the song in this video ? Thank you guys ^^  Welcome to Man Utd, Sanchoooo
Adminho on time again😂🙋‍♂️ Next video sancho top 10 goals Sancho top 10 assists Sancho top moments Top skills.... etccccc.. 👻
Sacho's carrier is finished after joining united( known for killing world talents like sanches, mikhitarian, van dabeik, van persie....)
God Bless Him
*Welcome to Manchester!!! 🔴🔴🔴*
The best footballers have great football minds, it's like their brain reads the game differently and on another level from average players.
absolute insanity that he hasn’t featured for England at the euros   Imagine   Grealish —— Mount ——- Sancho   🥶
😭😢 will miss him
JADON WELCOME TO THE REAL MANCHESTER 🔴⚪⚫🙏🏼7️⃣🔥
Can't wait to see Haaland leave too! 😊
erling may have been the star but for me sancho will always be the magical mythical wonderkid.
Sorri for my not bundesliga question, but what is the first music's name?😅
He will flop like willian flop in arsenal. #Sadbuttrue
Real test for him will be the EPL
Welcome Manchester united
Respect Caribbean brooda. It’s sad to see him leave the Yellow Wall.
what's  the first song called?
he was too big for BVB anyways
85m and 400k at yernited lol will they ever learn
Now have Sancho in our team we can finally compete with teams like City who have brilliant players like Mahrez in the same position. A few more solid signings and we are a top team again. You are doing well so far Ole
What's the song?
Had to report this video due to the amount of bullying Sancho is doing.
Next skills and goals will be Haaland???
He's quiet good. But his playing style looks like uncomfortable.
That touch though 🔥
Is he any good or overrated?
Incredible player 👏
Southgate has to see this vid though.
Football matches spreading this deadly CORONAVIRUS with thousands of deaths of loved ones each week.  Lockdown on the way.
Nice comments from dortmund fans. respect from Manchester united fan
Your duo with halland will be missed, I  become BVB 💛  fan just because of you . All the best sanchoo
My name
Shockingly calm and collective in the box Fantasies buy for United and best of luck to this young talented man in the prem
Who's Jadon Sancho?
Our next neymar???
Why music bundesliga?
https://youtu.be/pPTJW7M96-c
Come tu united
Every i watch Sancho he makes me smile
3:55 won’t be making many runs in behind like that in the Premier League
The only english player that this guy can be compared with is Kane, the way this guy plays and numbers are just absurd. After Mbappe and maybe Haaland he is the best wonderkid.
😭😔
What a player.
Thank you everything you did for us Jadon, even though it's man united, we wish you the best
The take-down @ 01:56 is insane , other wordly
Welcome bro Can't wait to see u plying for us ❤️
Very good to united
This vid Def took more than 10mins
Welcome to Man. UNITED. Hope he carries the legacy of Cristiano.
Manchester United have the best midfield and best Strikers in the Premier League with the inclusion of Sancho, if they don't win the league next season then they have underachieved.
absolutely spell binding football! now we wait to transcend this form to england
fun fact: sancho was at man city before dortmund and now he is at man utd
GGMU
Another Timo and Havertz
Didn't know Bundesliga was on that Hip Hop ting
https://youtu.be/WLpsqtl7-gk
Wow
Welcome to Manchester United Jason Sancho
SANCHO WELCOME TO THE THEATHRE OF DREAMS
I have been disappointed many times after watching clips of players on YouTube and actually seeing them playing in real life . I’ve realised that everyone of us have moments in our life’s and if we can document these moments and post on YouTube, people will believe we’re special etc. I’m not saying his not talented but only pointing out the fact that, we’ve all been there before, seeing how amazing a player looks on YouTube but turns out so disappointing down the line. With due respect to German league, it seems only Bayern M, have more quality players and so will be interesting to know how Sancho performed  against them. Timo werner comes to mind, scored loads of goals easily in Bundesliga, but has discovered  how hard it’s to get a chance or scoring against quality defenders and goal-keepers. People, let’s reserve our accolades  until  we actually see him playing in the Premier league.
Welcome to Manchester United the theatre of dreams sir 💯💯
The next ronaldinho
im watch Almost dortmund match He’s GOAT 🔥
i got his 2017 dordmund jersey
Bring me Halaand as well next season
Sorry Dortmund I love Jadon big respect for making him who he is even after city releasing him/selling him
Premier League teams takes all the the talented players from bundesliga.......then they say bundesliga doesn't have competition 🤣🤣🤣
😭😭😭😭😭 💛🖤BVB FAN💛🖤
I hope he became much stronger and healthier in Manchester ❤️❤️
So i this was uploaded becouse he was leaving?
I’m worried for him Hopefully he ain’t going to be a flop like Werner and Van de Beek
Goodbye Jadon! Dankeshön
Welcome jadon ❤️‍🔥🙏🏻
Welcome to Manchester United!
Semoga di mu gacor kaya di dortmund
The thing is can he actually do this in the premier League
Sancho is incredible player, like Ronaldo
Thank you everything JS7 😔
I want him to make Guoardialo realize what they had let go at ease??
Now he'll play alongside RASHFORD,CAVANI,FERNANDES,POGBA💥💥
His arrival excites me, fans of Borussia Dortmund, we will take good care of Jadon Sancho, how great Borussia Dortmund is 🔴👏
This was a nice tribute by the Bundesliga to Sancho
Thanks bundesliga YT channel admins/editors for creating these finger tip scout report for YT scouts like us and Ed Woodward! haha
Thanks for this video
I'm loving the look of the United Frontline. Sancho, Greenwood, Rashford, Cavani, Martial. Quite impressive.
Good luck for the new chapter Jadon Sancho !
Welcome to us, Jadon <3
Farewell sancho
Southgate is a clown
We're winning the league . Glory glory man united
Imagine if he was left footed 🥵🥵🥵🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Wish he sucks at united and learns not to sign for a losing team
Anyone else reminded of Neymar with certain touches and controls? Boy oh boy what a player we have signed.
What's the track playing?
I already know he's very good... so it's the sound track for me✨💕
song at the start name pls?
Dialo loan to Dortmund will be perfect replacement
As a Dortmund fan, it's a very sad day
Man United brought me here
Can’t believe we got him
Which song
The Bundesliga surely will miss him
I don’t understand how he can be this good but not make the England starting line up / be used as a sub
Awwwwh, what a shame to see a player of his talent leave the Bundesliga, that being said, best of luck to him at Manchester United! ❤️
Si Haaland se volvió un cybor en el BvB gran parte de la responsabilidad lo tiene Sancho.
Do anyone else feel that he join manu because England national team broke him.
BVB buys players for little,transform them and then sell them and make a profit
so next is haaland ?
Saka has been given the chance to shine, Sancho has not.. Southgate is picking Saka over Sancho and Foden because he believes Saka is better defensively.. Southgate is all about defense first.. Sancho is a better footballer than Saka, FACT!.. next season we will see because he will be doing it in the premier league which is where English fans watch their football as opposed to Germany.. he'll be the 1st name on Englands team sheet
Se va
Name of second song??
Welcome to Manchester United Jadon! You are now a Red🔴!
Damn even thou im a united fan im gonna miss Haaland and sancho crazy celebrations :D
The best player in England
Welcome to Manchester
What’s the name of the song
One thing I know for sure... Adminho and I will miss him when he leaves😭
B Dortmund is University of European Football
I imagine this must be similar to how United fans felt when Cristiano left for Madrid. No hard feelings, phenomenal player, only fair that he wants to play in his home country.
He ll be a big flop .. Mark my words ..
The nutmeg king 🙄
cruel admin...cruel timing
Forget Sancho!! He is not going to do well at Utd! Instead of wasting 73 million on him Utd should bid for Kante!! Pogba is an unbelievable player with Kante next to him.
Should have stayed at Dortmund
sending to Southgate..................
Come to United and change the game
Видео супер и музыка
Welcome to the premier league
Welcome Sancho 🔴
Manchester United awaits 🔴🚀
Bundesliga youtube channel, shamelessly taking advantage of Sancho's United transfer for clicks and views knowing we will gladly give it to them... I absolutely love it... Welcome to the Theater Jady
Music almost worse than BLM kneeling
I could make Andy Carol look good in a montage
Finally!! Cavani movement and Sancho 👀
welcome to manchester united bundesliga
Good luck in manchester united 🔥💯❤🙈
We will take care of him. Thank you.
Finally sancho for man utd
Why did man city sell him😂
Welcome to Man United, Jadon! You will do great. Best of luck
He deserves a team better than Man u
Erling Halland to Bayern Munich Tammy Abraham to Dortmund 👇
Thank you jadon and welcome back home
Dortmund should sign Kostic or Thuram
Good luck Sancho next season in man UNT
Reminds me so much of Alexis Sanchez at Arsenal, can’t wait to see him tear up premier league WELCOME TO MANCHESTER UNITED JADON 🔴
Perfect footballer 👌 he is .
All i can say is, good luck on your next destination.. I, like many other Dortmund fans, knew that you weren't gonna stay with us forever but absolutely no hard feelings.. I'm just glad you chose to join Dortmund when you did and also thank you for not trying to force a move last year...thank you so much for all the great memories, hope you'll have a great career and now it's time for us to move on.. #BVB💛🖤...

First song name???
He should play for england
He’s a generational talent, regardless of his situation with England. He’s gonna light the prem up differently 🔥
Atleast he can beat gk because we have a guy rashford who doesn't know how to beat gk in one on one situation
Sancho will win the Premier league young player of the year and Player of the year awards 2021/22 mark my words
Welcome to #MUTD 😈 #JadonSancho
He is traitor I thought that he stay but he leave us.
Southgate doesn't realise just what he has in Sancho. When he gets regular premier league games he wll be first choice right winger for England!
why bundesliga is a farmer league , because any player who becomes famous will leave Germany . So sad BVB loses a fantastic player
Yes x
I'm sad 😢🟡⚫
Varane is next in. we have had enough humiliation from city and liverpool. Time has come for united to take the rightful place on the throne back to where we belong
Can't wait to see him at Old Trafford 😊Welcome to Man United ❤️Sancho
Tbh Dortmund should replace Sancho with Daniel James.....he will set the Bundesliga on fire and help Dortmund win the Bundesliga over that fraud Bayern Munich ⚫🟡
2 years time Bundesliga: Jadon Sancho made in the Bundesliga
Welcome
Sorry but Bundesliga is not a farmer league but the fact Sancho plays on the bench for England shows how superior premier league really is
Waww @1.19m the back heel flick is sensational 👏
It's so sad to see Gareth Southgate not playing him at the Euros
Welcome to Manchester United!
3:03 look at that reaction
Great highlights. Music in video is garbage
Confirmed! Welcome to United Js7 👍
To much buzzing but not so much honey from him, ahaha, defenders will destroy him
Now who is there for haaland😔😔😔
Now United should bring his friend Haaland too: Not impossible, but I think they're more likely to put the cash on Varane.
Darn. To United? I wanted to see him in the prem, with Chelsea! Well I hope that still means we can do the Håland deal. Dortmund would get so mugged off if done. They’d have a lot of cheddar 🤑
Different situation all together in the premier league, we will see how he does coming from a Utd fan
Jadon sancho is a gun
Southgate should watch this
Going to be Depay 2.0 at United. Overrated af
Mashallah
I am a Liverpool fan and I am shivering by noticing that now Sancho is Manchester united player🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶
Welcome to Manchester United Jadon Sancho. Can't wait to see Guardiola's face when Sancho scores at the Etihad.
he surely is leaving
Welcome to manchester united
Thank you …
3:30 we need this
how much Dortmund pay City for him?anyone can tell me
One of those great players who were produced by BVB and did not go to bayern
With Sancho Sancho and rashford up in the box.. we are going to see a lot of penalties.. (Fernandes so happy rn)
Another world class talent in the rank!! Lets go man United
Dortmund scouts are great at spotting talents.
Haaland To Chelsea ...So your  next video Erling Haaland made in BundesLiga 😎
Can't wait to watch next season premier league
Who's here the announcement
Manchester
nice transfer as fenerbahce fans. Good joob manch United
We'll play united
He won't be playing against farmer defenders in the premier league... That's for sure.
:(
Haaland's goal tally might be heavily decrease.
Look how good he is at lw position
Just another Sanchez and Pogba
Jadon thank you and good luck 🔥💪💛🖤
You love to see it
As a united fan i was waiting for this video. Real ones know what these types of video means on the Bundesliga channel
What is the title song in the background ?
Now that he is leaving I have to change my profile pic. I wish him good luck
Good luck Sancho :(
Welcome to Manchester United.
As a Chelsea fan I'm only seeing haaland
Thank You❤️
Congratulations to Man. Utd for finally bringing him to Old Trafford.   As for The Yellow Wall, they already faced many of their players leaving in a similar manner, but happy that he was key in bringing home the DFL Supercup and DFB Pokal.  Ansgar Knauff will probably take place where Sancho played.
Heja BVB he will be remembered and its fine!!! its just fine!!!
Not Good enough👍
Bundesliga understand Manchester United fans more than Manchester United
He is one of the most talented right wingers in the bundasliga and he will be excellent for Man Utd
A farewell post
If haaland really misses him, he should also come to ...
Generational 🙌
Come to spurs
I watched him from his first match now hes gone.Danke Jadon💛🖤💛🖤🖤💛
Welcome my favorite player. I hope you will beast at United
Wonder if Haaland will still have the same amount of goals with Sancho gone
Why did you leave BVB Sancho? You could’ve stayed here and become a one club man. But no, you had to take the big route.
ballerrrr can't wait to see him at the la theatre next season
Sunil chettri is better than him 😆😆😆😆
Welcome Sancho Manchester United
Welcome Sancho Manchester United
You better release that made in Bundesliga for jadon sancho
JADON SANCHO SUMMARY: FIFA U17 World Cup 2017 Champion Dortmund HOF Dribbling Duo with haaland DFB Pokal Champion.
Loved it...!!!👍👍👍 Welcome to theatre of dreams...!!!
My man loves a nutmeg 😂 welcome to old Trafford 🔥
i hope he becomes good for man utd i have lil bit of reservation at the moment because the german league is not as good as the premier league and i remember shinji kagawa he was brilliant for dortmund but sadly couldnt make it at uts.The pressure at man utd is much more than the pressure at dortmund
Thank you for the memories Jadon, we'll miss you! 💛🖤
Why man united? U should go to Barca or RM
85k for sancho....only the sales of his jersey would replenish utd's investment...well done
I hope Manchester United can get Bellingham next, after he is groomed at Dortmund. Sancho is one of the best talents in the World and Borussia Dortmund really made him realise his potential and made him world class.
song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kStAWg0eqLk
United🔴🔴
Welcome to Manchester United JS7. The theatre of dreams.
Welcome to united
Florian wirtz pls
Yes x
Last time Jadon is a youtube end card :( He will be missed at Dortmund, loved him so much
The bundesliga probably made this video to show southgate
One of the most talented players Bundesliga has ever seen. Sancho is fantastic
Respect to the editor
Welcome to the biggest club in England
Yes X
Adminho soon make a video about halland 😵
Sanchooooo is a redddddd❤️❤️❤️
I hope he doesn’t leave
Bringing that magic to Old Trafford,💥💥
brighton have six defenders sitting at the back, where is going to dribble the ball to?
Clever clever admin
Welcome MU
Most of his dribbling skills  works on when counter attacking
Just as how your not playing the national teams, it is the exact way you will struggle against sitting back epl defenders
Can't wait to see him grace the real half of Manchester! 🔴🔴🔴
Bundesliga youtube has the best admin
Massive, massive talent. I've wanted him for a very long time. Thank you for his development, Dortmund. We'll take it from here.
Welcome to Manchester United 🔥🔥
To dortmund fans: i respect your club. But GOD do i hate your board
Somebody show this to Gareth Southgate please….guy is a baller for sure.
Dortmund my heard, Sancho always best in the world and see u in dortmund
It will be sad to Miss him In the bundelsiga but welcome to Man U Jadon with me and radshy
Prem title loading.....
Sancholino
New Devil in The Theatre of DREAMS 🔱
*Welcome to MANCHESTER UNITED SACHO* 💛⏩❤️
Ngl i feel like hes gonna loose his talent in utd
And now.. we wait for haaland's highlights 👀
Wonderful player
Can’t wait for him to be in the prem
The Premier league is a bigger league ,the champions league final had two English teams ,the europa league had Man U in the final and Arsenal in the semi German teams don't come close. The only team in Germany who is on a high level is Bayern that's it.
Manchester United fans incoming.. 🙄
Ah yes look at those United skills brilliant 🤩
Welcome to Manchester united jancho
Might as well use the word ‘Sancho’ as a synonym to the word ‘baller’
Every time a star leaves the Bundesliga lol
#DankeJS7  🟡⚫️🟡 always in our hearts 💛🖤💛 4 seasons full of magic moments
honestly didn't know about the transfer being completed until i got a notification of this video. Bundesliga always uploads these kinds of videos whenever someone's about to leave
Yes x
City fans are crying
He's generational!! Welcome at the stretford end
Can't wait to see him in a Red shirt. Welcome to United Sancho! GGMU
I hope he will not look like Shinji Kagawa, Japanese star.
Sancho finally  is Red🔥
💛🖤💛😎🤙
Always love this maverick😭💛
Man Utd fan,Dortmund my favourite german team,We will take care of him ❤️💛
Danke Jadon
Looks like bundesliga respects sancho more than Southgate. what a talent.
England should play him every match
Thanks for the player

As as a United fan I have been waiting for this video for such a long time 😀
Welcome to MUFC J.S.7

Not me looking at the quality of some great business
Bundesliga posts the best highlight

Wow Kids got skills!
The Breezy Way🥶🥶👍🏾 Good Luck in MU crack !!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
The philosophy of the rich and the poor is this: the rich invest their money and spend what is left. The poor spend their money and invest what is left.”
Sanchshow is travelling
Welcome to Manchester United ❤️
we will miss him
👹
I guess sancho don't like winning trophies that's why he signed with Man utd
Respect to Dortmund fans,must be sad losing him.
Haaland has lost his best friend Sancho 😥😫😱😰😭🤯
So excited that it’s finally done
This guy has some serious skills⚡⚡
I wish he plays the quarter finals for England 🤩
We will take care of him X
A real talent, hope he doesn't turn into another Kagawa or Mkhitaryan
Glad to see he likes to assist unlike rashford
will miss u sanchooooo!
good luck at united jadon 😥🥺😭
Brilliant from the Germans! Make an English club pay sick money for an English lad to return to his own country. Lol
Bundesliga please make a jadon Sancho made in Bundesliga
Ok Adminho ,tell a joke
Sancho <3  Thank you.
good luck
GOODBYE SANCHO , WISH U ALL THE BEST AT MU
Made in Dortmund 🖤💛
Welcome to Manchester United 🔴❤❤
Hands up to the bundesliga created a top young talent who will hopefully continue to spread talent in the premier league 🙌🙌🙌
Man I am falling in love with him
I can't believe that such a player is coming to Manchester United. It's school exam period and I can't concentrate on my studies!
Good Luck Jadon Sancho For The New Club in England
All
Was about time.
Sancho assists Cavani to score😁
Does this mean jadon is leaving??? ..... Please admino say noooooo
Welcome Sancho
Sancho to VARchester United 😒😭
Finally he is red 💪🔴 welcome JS7
Will shine at United
too good for United
Welcome to MU
I hope we get Malen
Why did you leave us? WHY?!!
Im happy
The amount of opportunities he creates is ridiculous. Goal and Shot creating actions tell you who can and can’t be a motor of a team. He’s definitely one of the ones who can be a motor, reminds me of a basketball Point Guard or Hockey Center…he’s gonna be good for a while 💯.
The next Hazard
Good luck Sancho at Man U
Welcome to  best  club in the world  jadon🔻🔴
Abt time they made a farewell video fir Sancho. Been waiting for over an year
Sancho Welcome best team in the World
Welcome jadon Welcome to manchester united
Finding a replacement for him seems hard. But i think Hofmann will seal the deal
Thank you for your service to Dortmund Jaden Sancho!! Good Luck at Manchester United I'm sure you are going to be great ;)
thank you jadon🙏💛🖤
Good
Danke Sancho
Welcome to manchester united.
Was waiting for this 🤣

DANKE JADON💛🖤
What a spell in the Bundesliga, Goodluck in the future Jadon Sancho💪💪

Southgate isnt treating him nicely , he should play him more...
