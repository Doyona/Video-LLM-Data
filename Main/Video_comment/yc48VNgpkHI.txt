Arsenal Biggest Defeat in Manchester 2011-2021  in Premier League (10th Years Ago August 28th)  2011 Manchester United 8-2 Arsenal  2021 Manchester City 5-0 Arsenal
Speaking of 5… arsenal are now 5 points clear of city at the top. Who would have expected that a year ago?
Xhaka s tackle is not a red
Who came ere after that new improved performance 🙏 Proud of my boys   We made amazing signings!   Ramsdale, Tomi, Ben White, Gabriel!  Fixed that defence quickly!
Arsenal after this game: sits up*
2:02 *Forfeit Season*
Man City vs Banter club
Where was the grealish goal
City fan stop gassing it’s Arsenal
Arsenal's keeper is recovering from his injured back problem, due to repetitive retrieval of the ball from the back of the net.
Dreadful from Arsenal, excellent from City
If Arteta is still manager by Christmas, I’ll make a video as to why he’s the best manager to ever grace the Premier League in it’s 30 year history.
what is with the press mollycoddling saka and making him out to be the best thing since sliced bread -  for england he had a few good runs that was it - he got bullied off the ball and ran it out of play all the time,  same for arsenal, he barely scores in games which matter, barely assists - most overrated piece of shitever
Seriously the defending was utterly shambolic
The north London derby is going to be… interesting
1:13 Ederson was checking if it is true that Arsenal can't literally score
Arsenal got destroyed
First Mendy rapes women, then man city rape Arsenal. We can’t press charges because Arteta consented.    I’m clinging to Ben White and Gabriel saving us when both fit… and partey and lokanga being beasts..  We might then at least be 8th
this game is me when i was 7 playing fifa on beginner difficulty
reckon they'll do a Leeds soon... lmao
Too easy
Arsenal at their most authentic!! 🤣 😅 😂 😁 Please keep Arteta for the next 50 years! 😂
Even as a Spurs man, this is hard to watch. Abject performance.
Ronaldo would have a field day with Citys quality of delivery into the box
So punching people is fine now
Manchester City buying there way to the title again how boringly unfair,ffs how football has gone to the dogs
bye bye arTiTa 🤣
Its gonna be a long season for arsenal. Ederson was their best player ffs 😅
Arsenal F.C are a disaster from owners to players it’s all a total mess .
Being an Arsenal fan for 30 years but never seen this club in such a mess the kroenkes have ruined this one's called great Club
Arsenal to be relegated.I  😆
Wow was that really Arsenal
Spurs TOP Arsenal BOTTOM   read it and weep losers
Arsenal need to get rid of that muppet in charge and find a real manager .....
Ederson trying to do some charity work.
Gets himself an assist n comes out at leeds fest with stormzy
4th goal 👌
Everyone screaming about Arteta, but to me personally it looks like some players are purposefully trying to Sabotage him...
Ty: We beat West Brom 6-0 so this week was 6-5 on aggregate
micel claims arsenal dominate till first goal what game was he managing arsenal worst then Norwich ATM
Many predicted that Arsenal would finish 5th or 6th this season. Riiight.
Arsenal have let down the whole of southeast London.
It's lucky Arsenal spent so much money otherwise they might have lost 6 or 7 nil.
Ty: we mustn't forget, we played at 12.30, our players didn't have their lunch
The league champions performed an exhibition of champion football.
Arsenal are a joke, they're not playing football, they're playing Sunday league football
Swear arsenal have the worst fans in the prem they need to get relegated and start again
Xhaka can absolutely bugger off now, I've backed him but now I've had enough
video looks old
Arsenal won the charity shield last season so they a quality team that will turn it around, and don't forget 17 years ago they went the whole season undefeated
Has Jesus sneakily become one of the best classic style wingers in the world?
Did var even check the red card?
Why hasn't arteta been sacked , he's clearly not going to turn arsenal into anything special but everybody's up his arse....enal
Dodgy Keeper.
Uppa Liverpool never been is it a good stadium
Arsenal missing Wenger !
All the arsenal  supporters  gone underground  love it ,,,, 😀
Who put the arse in Arsenal?
Wagwarn with Pep's logo? 1:01 lol
Liverpool tried to do the same to Chelsea but we’re not that sort of party so they only got 1 point
JESUS IS LORD AND KING OF GOALS
Click bait
Now I understand why Arsenal wanted to go to the super league
Arsenal Football Club....keeping "Ole the Norwegian Clown" in a job for the last 2 yrs...
Number 3 on trending around the world, I wouldn’t be surprised if the Taliban are watching this to learn how to destabilise and destroy.
Why didn't any of the arsenal defenders get close to the city players in the box
How is grealish in the title 😂😂
It's going to be difficult for rival fans to call Man City a foreign club since they have Grealish, Foden, Sterling, Stones and Walker. More English first team nationals than most or all other clubs.
Arsenal looked good getting off the team coach and when warming up , then saldy the game started😂😂😂💚💛💚💛
Terrible game. Arsenal look destined for relegation. City proved nothing and still face a mountain of a challenge to prove are genuine challenges to the title
ARSENAL 🗑
I think xhakas tackle was brilliant lol
What idiot decided to give Xhaka a new contract? Should've sold him to Roma when they had the chance as he is liability, 2 nil down and he goes in with a two footed tackle.   Shambolic from the Goons who buy a 50 million unproven defender and 30 million GK when they had Martinez, when my team Man United buy Varane, Sancho and Ronaldo.   At least they can't go any lower as they are already bottom with a relegation 6 pointer coming up against Norwich next.

Arsenal are relegation candidates. Make no mistake. They actually are.
Guardiola we are building the team to become champions  Arteta we are building the team for the championship
🤦🏻‍♂️👈 Arteta ….. literally
mad part is he turned up at leeds festival and was on stage with stormzy the same night
what happened to arsenal man
trust the process😭😭😭 discusting
Here come the arteta out parade. We are obviously on a journey, a long one. Besides that, who on earth would take the job one month into a new season with Arsenal in the state we are in?  We seriously need to have faith and just back our team. Honestly the lack of a spine some of our fans have is just ridiculous.
Phahahaha look at arsenal... relegation candidates indeed
wenger in
so the score was man city 5 ARSE NIL!
Man why did they have to batter arsenal like that....and contribute to the sacking of their manager
I swear arsenal is living on the breadline at this point
02:02 is this where legendary "Forfeit match" was taken from ? 🤣🤣
That cannon ain’t been banging since 03 time it came off the badge I think
Not to take anything away from this City performance… but Jesus Christ the lack of atmosphere in that stadium is shocking 😂 they were 4-0 up and no one was even singing?!
I'm tired, Wobbie.
Should not av left the community of Maine road. Nothing exciting abart city nar, same we Cardiff,, Sunderland, West ham, arsenal. Leaving Maine road ruined city, fans barely celebrate in that cooperative bowl. Support Maine road fc,  moss side.  Sky sports ruined football and business in the community. S**tihad Eastland souless boring bowl..
Wat a shambles lol
Amazon. Don’t release the documentary. I don’t wanna fall deeper into depression.
Would love arsenal to go down! Deserve it.
Arabian Oil Money 5 Future Sky Bet Championship Side 0
Arsenal bottom of the table after three games.. time for Big Sam?
For Arsenal fans, the best part about this video must be the adverts
lol
At least Arsenal will have a shot at winning something next season, the championship 🤣🤣 bye bye boys
Glorified pub league
i am a toon nut, i am very sure arsenal will come out of there nightmare start,but for us we are a nightmare with that bruce
Ozil...ozil...ozil..
We are all eating arsenal relegation time babe
arsenal are a joke
1 Assist: GREALISH STARS
From Royal Engineers, to Invincibles, to Spanish Armada
Arsenal fans will just ask for the GD to not be negative for Christmas 🤣🤣
On this day a 11 years ago Manchester United won 8-2
How arsenal the gunners but there ones getting killed every game
I feel bad for the Arsenal fans who have watched their team do an invincible season and being actually quality to absolute garbage.
Misleading Title: Grealish really didn't do anything other than the assist on the 3rd goal.
I thought arsenal said back to winning ways 😭😭😭
The quality of the video is so poor. Cheap BT Sport
absolutely shocking performance from arsenal
Wtf happened to arsenal i dont get it
Let’s just all agree arsenal are absolutely SH**
My word Calum chambers 🤣🤣🤣 how he has finessed arsenal only God knows
Arsenal had a shocker but there is so much talent in that Man City squad, no wonder Pep declared himself happy.
Time 4 strikers to stand up to make there shirt  there's hey they are doing 👆🤣
Love it, fcuk the gooners
Man U fan's be like, Ronaldo!!!!
Done with arsenal …. enough is enough
I should have never listen to my dad Arsenal is so trash I will not support Arsenal I will support Man City
arsenal fans where celebrating the 4th goal. brilliant
Arteta is by far City's best attacker!
I have the “invincibles” DVD and can’t wait to add the “rise and fall of arsenal FC” to my collection :)
Man i was thinking about betting on arsenal getting relegated i shoulds done it the odds were nice too kmt
I don't think arsenal are making it through the group stages
What baffles me is how the f*ck Mikel Arteta still has a job?!
Never mind mikep artetiola how bad are those players fam
Hahahahahhahahahha 5-0 yuna hahah
Football rules have gone crazy. How was that a red for Xhaka? That was a good strong challenge & he didn’t even touch the City player. It’s killing the game IMO.
1:00 - wtf is wrong with the man city badge?
sounds like a sunday league crowd cheering when city score 😂
Grealish touches a ball  BT sport “ Grealish stars”
I'm happy Ronaldo score
With out xhaka arsenal is like fish with out water ,strikers are sleeping with posh cars and biches .stayng up all the night shagin biches
The most abject performance I've ever witnessed from an Arsenal team and it's up there with any team for that matter
Arsenal are dead
Wtf happend to the City logo on Pep's top at 1:00
Arteta in. This is too funny
Grealish stars? Should be Torres 👍
That ragie arsenal fan heads going to pop.
Honestly Arsenal at this point should volunteer to be relegated. Beyond dead team, sort it out.
I don't know what Leno Chambers Kolasinac Holding and Cédric are doing at this football club. Arteta deserves the sack by sticking with these mediocre players. Where were Bellerin Gabriel Mari White Partey and Pepe? This is shambolic
Arsenal invincibles lest we forget☠️
arteta going bye bye's
He’s the f in problem
Awful defending from a very poor team, the weakest I’ve seen since 1984 when I first started going to Highbury 😢
The second goal has gotta be one of the worst pieces of defending I've ever seen in my life
Absolute joke of a club
Arsenal are TRASH
in one year arsenal could start winning again. in the championship?
U rmr that time when arsenal fans wanted Wenger out so badly?? Do UK that arsenal haven't qualified for the champions League ever since he left. Arsenal jus got but f**k by city🤣
Arsenal excluded ozil for speaking up, they deserve to be relegated. That would teach then investors a lesson
1:32 🧐
"Grealish stars"  What?! 😵😂
Let’s all agree that Arsenal isn’t a big club anymore
why do i still support this team
Seriously?? Grealish stars?? Where??!
Someone tell Arsenal I want my money back
Pain
“Grealish stars” he only got one assist...
So West Brom reserves was a false alarm!Calum Chambers?!?!
Ty: at least we did lead the Premiership this season.... When the season kicked off we were number 1
Disappointing performance by Manchester City, not even bagging 17 goals. Shameful.
Chambers was absolutely awful this game
1:02 why has Guardiola’s city badge melted?😂
How the mighty have fallen
We are a joke what else can be said 🤷‍♂️
I know we are it but didn’t VAR look at the punch on chambers?
Arsenal is going to get relegated with arteta if they don't get rid of him ASAP 🤣💯 Facts
Was this highlights of the highlights ?
ARSE-NIL pathetic team
Lmao
Yes coaching plays a part but bro these arsenal players are trash😂
arsenal are shet now :[
That's some of the worst defending I have ever witnessed😂
Jack boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Tierney deserves a better club
AFTV is going to be GOLD tonight 🤣
As a utd fan City just love scoring amazing team.
That was embarrassing.
Pray for Arsenal
Does Arsenal realise the league has actually started and not preseason friendly?
Someone is getting sacked lol.
The Afghan Army put up a better defence than Arsenal
The unequal surgeon seasonally beg because step roughly colour per a profuse reaction. standing, ratty tenor
Thierry Henry tricked me into supporting this team man
I was at the game, Rodri scored that exact goal in the warm up
This was defo men against infants....kindergarden side Arsenal are.
I wonder if arsenal fans are still buzzing about beating an under 21s west brom side
That's just Wow football the best players playing at their best playing the beautiful game beautifully
I'm not Arsenal fan but this is horrid to watch they have dropped so low now
Wdym "Grealish stars". He got one assist
What is Ben Leno doing in goals? What is Arteta still doing at Arsenal
I want to end it all at this point
2022-23 season Arsenal’s opening game will be away to Millwall!
Why I am not surprised? Because I knew what would happen.
Tbf Man City would beat any championship side 5-0.
Arsenal's centre halves are Pub League.
I hate Man City, team full of pricks.
Ty: the kit was too blue we kept looking at the sky they cheated
Arteta has done so much good work at the club. He must be allowed to stay and finish the job.
They need Zidane
Arsenal are getting relagated.
Arsenal looked like winning. such a close game lmao
How did he get that first hes 5'8
they only say “he starred” to justify the 100m Man *hitty paid for him.
The Gift Keeps Gifting
super league for arsenal
They are not the gooners anymore they are the goners
Same old arsenal  Same old arsenal  Same old arsenal  Same old arsenal Sunday league football
Did arsenal have a shot on target??
Dark times at the Emirates, how much more time can arteta have. Everyone knew city would beat them but to not really try is pathetic. Either arteta is tactically inept or he's lost the dressing room.
Use the code AFTV to sack Arteta.... LMAO
Arsenal are finished.
Someone get George Graham on the phone.
Bye bye arsenal try getting out of the 1st division in 1 go
Congrats Arsenal.. what a historic and monumental victory! 😂😂😂😂😂 in Arteta we trust! He is actually a world class manager believe it or not lmfao trust the process.. believe in him and he will deliever! 😂😂😂😂😂 next season he will bag the CL 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂  A real story.... a few days ago i went to a restaurant, ordered food and then i called the waitress over telling her i was 'Arsenal' with my meal.. she immediately realised i was done with my food where she fell to the floor laughing uncontrollable 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’m surprised arteta still has jet black hair thought it would be grey by now 😂
Jacky
don't worry Gooners. Next year, we'll get the treble.
Love it when a plan comes together.... LMAO
Arsenal need the players they say they don't, they lost Ozil, got rid of Wilshire ( I know he is injury prone, but he worked well with ozil and pass an move footy) lost Ox, and on top of that they have no good CDM's and a very poor defense. Can't really put ALL the blame on arteta, although I'm sure other managers may get more from the players they have, it doesn't mean it's all his fault, his tactics just don't work with who he has.
As a Cardiff fan I’m looking forward to playing arsenal in the championship next season
Who needs Ronaldo!  😁
not surprising
Arteta in
So clear football is scripted these days and based off my research here will be the top 4   City United Chelsea Liverpool  Boring boring boring .
Ederson playing midfield
Ben white is worth 50 milll ummmmmmm romero clear better 😉😁
Why is everyone in the comments stealing other peoples jokes
The rich mans comfort blanket moves in mysterious ways.
Grealish in the title over Torres 😂😂
Looking at the slow motion replays of the red card, it is clear that the city player was not touched by the arsenal player but feigned injury (cheated!). It comes to something when players are being sent off for tackling thin air
happy for martinez rn he deserved a better club like villa
Lol 😂
Arse could be in big trouble this year
Arteta needs to be sacked
Needed arsenal to have 3 shots on target for a big bet to come on 🤣 should have known better
"Grealish STARS !"  Reality, Grealish squares it 5 yards because Arsenal defence think its Christmas.
What a time to be an arsenal fan 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Granite xhaka is a pure liability
Why Grealish in the title 🤔.
I bet it feels amazing as a Man City fan when it’s all bought and paid for and not earned
Holding & chambers are white boys that can’t jump.
Why is the title Grealish lmao
As an arsenal fan individually we have some of the worst defenders in the league. How is Chambers and Holding making Gabriel, Torres and Sterling looking like prime Stoke in the air, beating them to headers.
Arteta just cannot do the job! It’s obvious they can’t  afford to keep faith in him.
"Jack Grealish on pitch as Man City pump arsenal" would be more accurate.
I’m a Man United fan and I remember laughing at Arsenal for losing to Brentford. After seeing these highlights, I’m not laughing. It’s just sad to watch at this point.
We don’t deserve Leno
Don't get carried away. 5 goals mean nothing against a team like this.
oh my days that rodri goal was sick
ederson can do this 10 times a game 1:04 i'd still let him off if it ever led to a goal. his ball playing is still on another level
Grealish stars??? 😂😂😂
sack looming for poor Arteta. But the Kroenkee's need to go. They are are only in the game to suck out the cash from Arsenal from their loyal fans who pay the highest season ticket prices in the prem and have been under invested in for 15+ years
This is embarrassing.  Kroenke out!!!    and I'm not even an Arsenal fan.
Arsenal holding absolute licks. As a Man Utd fan it would be sad to see an old foe relegated.
My god Arsenal have fallen a long way
Where did grealish star
Wow finished FC back at it again with an amazing 5-0 loss.
This wasn’t city playing absolutely class, just Arsenal being diabolical
Time for arteta to go now. He had a go and failed miserably. Absolutely no idea. And i have been an arteta supporter the whole time wishing him more time but enough is enough now.
Irrelevant title
went to the game. brilliant atmosphere!
Steve McManaman is the most Scouse-sounding Scouser ever. His accent is Ultra-Scouse.
What’s this about then? How come Ederson got a free ticket to watch the game?
I remember when Arsenal used to be boring.
I was going to write a football joke, but Arsenal beat me to it.
The lineup was a sackable offence
Arfeta cheese was eaten by man city 😋
Why hasn't arteta been sacked yet.
Might be the most one sided game ive ever watched
Ben white amazing signing
Torres is criminally underrated
So good watching arsenal get hammered.
Arsenal get battered everywhere they go  Arsenal get battered everywhere they goooooooooo
Not a city fan by all means but I hope grealish as a banging season ! So Southgate might actually play him for England for the World Cup before the 115th minute
Arsenal are doing a terrific job, keep it up lads 😂
Shambolic from Arsenal.
Did Ronaldo score ????
ARSENAL FOR RELEGATION??
Why on earth the sponsors are using arabic as the script for advertisement?
How’s grealish ‘starred’ he’s literally set 1 goal up 🤣🤣🙈
Gunners?nah bummers
Oh the joys of being a arsenal fan 😍 no shots on target can't defend manager can't run a bath let alone a team we are some lucky bustards only 20th in the league 😍😍
Arsenal Got too gassed after beating our u18s in the cup got brought back to reality today😂👍🏼😭😭😭😭
Wait whats with peps badge on his jumper?
*20th*
As bad as the defending was, Leno was worse.  Really bad decision making/positioning and no organizing/leading/communication with the defenders in front of him.  Ramsdale would have taken them by the scruff of the neck and sorted them out.
Farmers?
1 shot 0 on target , another masterclass performance by arsenal
HA HA HA after the mighty arsenal hammered WBA juniors
Once again has the game be fisted
RELEGATION BATTLE😂😂😂😂😂😂🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🤭🐓🐓🐓
This is by far the worst defending I have ever seen. Wow! He got rid of saliba for this??? Clueless
Proper plastic club & players playing in that awful plastic stadium. Maine Rd anyday.
Who is Arsenal?
1 shot on goal and 18% possession 🤯 arsenal really are getting worse and worse
Why is everyone still pretending sport is important while the world is on fire?
Can only perform against the relegation battling clubs
Grealish stars ?
I have no horse in this race, but Arteta has to go, right?
hmm arsenal looks good in their way to relegation
Enjoyed the game more than I ever imagined dreams do come true 🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾Coys hatrick for kane tomoz🎉
only arsenal can concede 9 goals and score 0 in 3 matches
Huge relegation battle next week for arsenal against Norwich
vengur out
Arsenal are just the gift that keeps on giving 😂
Honestly this is so sad for Arsenal football club, the players the manager are all awful. The owners should be ashamed of themselves
Relegation battle could be possible js.
Leno is too good to be playing for arsenal
I think Arsenal are looking at the table the other way round. In that case they're in top three position 😉
Why are there so many fans at this training match?
As an Arsenal fan I'm disgusted by your comment. In all my years as a football and Arsenal fan I've never seen a coach tactically better than Mikel Arteta and I think he's the best coach we ever have had. Back him and trust the process. We can still do this! We are Arsenal! COYG!
Arsenal are gonna finish in the bottom half this season and I'm living for it hahahahahaha
Two Rape’ings in a week for city someone call the boys in blue🐷
Getting sacked in the morning 🎶
Who is the PE teacher now😂🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Grealish 1 assist and I didn't see anything else
They looked afraid to get a foot stook in if they're like that every game they're certain to get relegated
Were city good or Arsenal shambolic
Not an arsenal fan but if that’s a red I honestly don’t want to watch the sport anymore
An error led to Arsenal's only shot in the game. Is this the worst performance in PL history? It certainly has to be up there.
And this is where arsenal get relegated
I know arsenal fans that actually celebrated when xaka signed a new deal lmfao
Another hidin for arsenal 🤣🤣
I still dont get Arsenal! Their manager is decent their team is rubbish. Their defence is shocking!
why’s city’s atmosphere so dry😂😂
Embarrassing
Ahahahahahahhahahahahhahaha😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
when will the GOAT CR7 join city?
Grealish stars? He got 1 assist mate
What a fenomenal youngster ferran torres is
So Grealish got an assist to make it 3-0 after Arsenal went down to 10. Watching the highlights only, it’s seems he really ran the show…
I really think Arsenal stopped being a top club a while ago in front of out eyes.
Me.... Check arsenal score run down stairs get my pop corn run back up stairs watch aftv gold
*Ferran Torres stars as Pep’s city thump Arsenal*… English bias is ridiculous!
Norwich and Arsenal both horribly battered, City without KDB, Foden and a striker in both games. 🤔
Arteta needs to bounce. He can take Xhaka, Leno, Holding, Chambers, Kolasinac, Soares, and Edu with him. The club is in trouble. And yet none of the management seem ready or prepared to take responsibility.
Too early to say about City yet. They beat both the bottom teams 5-0 at home but Leicester and Spurs made them look average
Rodri 102 completed passes, Arsenal 121 completed passes.
Well done City for demolishing a relegation side
anyone else watching this on the toilet
I feel sorry for Arsenal! They deserve better and this coming from. MAN UTD fan.
Yet to see a coach as good as, or better than AW turn up for the Gunners.
Arsenal spent the most out of anyone this transfer window to achieve 20th place and score 0 goals. Arteta at the wheel.
So those headers leno cant save but lukaku’s actually good header he can save
1:28?? Not sure about that!🤨
QPRsenal
Spend £130 mil & get worse !😄😄
3 games gone. 0 goals scored. 9 conceded. An absolute joke of a manager. ARTETA OUT!!!...
Look at the title Grealish stars when Torres got two goals n an assist the English bias is mad
Arteta is just waiting to get sacked at this point
As an Arsenal fan I have to admit that we look good for the championship next year.
Played like champions today against a weak arsenal side shame they didn’t make more of a game of it
I reckon this arsenal team would lose to the women's team
Ederson is a genius, knew if he hit it off the Arsenal lad it was never going in the net. Easy goalkick.
Arsenal have conceded 9 goals in 3 games and have scored 0.I hope arteta stays😂
Must be so damn hard to support arsANAL 😁😁😁
WTF happened to Arsenal?
Games gone soft, Xhakas tackle wasnt Red...
The Arsenal players are playing to get Arteta fired.
Oh dear 😂😂😂😂 if arsenal weren't an embarrassment before they certainly are now lol
Only 5-0.    Arsenal are improving.!
Too easy…..Arsenal poor 👎
GREALISH STARS 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
What a nice day for city fans.! Pay for the ticket whatever it costs and have an amazing time in the stadium with fellow supporters while your time humiliating the opposition 🍻 🍺 cheers.. mate
Arsenal are getting thrashed this season.
ARSENDUL the INVISIBLES 🤣😂
should of been a red due to dangerous play but there was a bit of simulation by Cancelo. STOP DIVING!!!!
3 games 3 losses cmon Gunners 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Woolwich getting thrown about again…absolute clownshow 😂 COYS
How can arsenal spend a fortune but somehow be shitter than before 🤔
Arsenal 29 players on their squad only 2 or  3 are good enough
Let it sink in that Kroenke thought Arsenal were worthy of a place in a European Super League.
Honestly what else do we need more? Come on CITY.... Don't waste money on Harry Kane.... Doesn't worth it.... There is a much better strikers in European football club that cost half of what city was willing to pay for Kane.... WTF
How on earth did Leno save lukaku’s header against Chelsea but not save gundogans? 🤷🏼‍♂️🙃
Xhaka stupid but never even touched the city player yet he jumps 3 feet in the air fckn joke again today woeful
All our players are out sick or injured. Can we please sack the Arsenal chef cos I heard his a spurs fan.
WENGER OUT!!
I wonder what the arsenal fans who were moaning about arsen Wenger are doing now. They were in the champions league every season back in the good old days. Anyway guys fill your glasses with tears
Arsenal All or Nothing is gonna be ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
How did grealish star? 😕
Wow Man City had 91% possession in the second half ! Oh dear
Starting to believe that Arsenal might NOT have enough quality to stay up this season 😅
Arsenal are an embarrassment 😂😂
Premier League..." There are no easy games in the Premier League." Arteta ..."I will see about that."
Wenger out lol remember that 🤣
“GrEaLiSh StArS” yeah ok
I dont know why but I really want arsenal to be relegated
RONALDO IS HOME 🔴⚪⚫
Imagine being an arsenal fan
Grealish hardly did anything 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
Arsenal best team in prem 🤣
0:36 look at calum chambers lmao
Right Arsenal to be relegated I'm calling it
So many people blaming arteta though, these players are mentally weak.
That defence is their B team. But their attack on the other hand, awful. Not even one shot on target. Would have bopped them anyway with both squads fully fit, healthy and match sharp.
wow.
Loooool 🤣
what a game
Shambles.
Omg Arsenal are beyond saving 🤣
I’m just waiting on ty. I keep refreshing it
Predictions for Arsenal TV later:  Blud - 15 Ya get me - 26 Get Arteta out blud - 429
Arsenal are no where near.
Time for tierney to come back to celtic.
Why wasn’t Mendy playing?
grealish was awful 😂
Damn looks like another tough season for all u gooners.
Robbie be making bank this weekend
Arsenal are a mid table championship team at best
Spoilt and stupid minority of arsenal fans didn't know how good they had it when Arsene was in charge. Morons
Imagine if Man City got Ronaldo now. We would honestly be patterning everyone.
How did grealish star or is it cause he’s British and cost £100M
Stick together,need help to each other,need strength to face this challenge,need more time...these are the bullies at arsenal club now.headless chickens are running without direction 😃
Xhaxa got the ball what the hell
Jesus on form.
I'm old enough to remember when Arsenal were quite good.    😊
Why does peps badge look melted?
Lock up your daughters when city come to your town
Arsenal made City look even better, wtf is going on at Arsenal they are shambolic
Is no one really talking about xhaka getting sent off
That Rodri goal was smooth 👌
It is like playing Fifa vs your 8 year old cousin 😂
Did grealish star? Really? 😂
Arsenal.......the laughing stock of London
Arsenal to be relegated
Banter Fc
Man City 5-0 at home. What a surprise…
Commentators suggesting for the city players to basically statpad against Arsenal to get their numbers up
Saka subbed at half time 😬
First goal so easy ..can someone tell Leno that every ball on the Danger Zone he can collect ? If Leno goes to pick that he could in the air. Pathetic
If thats a red card then my cats a dinosaur
When reality sinks in!
As an Arsenal fan, this is quite easily our worst ever game in history, the only thing arteta has done for this club is give us a new worst possession rate ever. Our previous worst was 33% now it’s 19%
0 goals scored. 9 conceded. 0 points. Over £100 million spent. Trust the process guys
and everyone had Arsenal for top 4
Arsenal loss again 😞😞😞
I can’t believe that people are stupid enough to keep paying £1300 for a season ticket, just for the club to waste it on below average players.
🤡A💩R💩S💩E💩N💩A💩L🤡
Training ground excercises for city , Arsenal are a joke of a team  Hope they get relegated they deserve it so do their deluded fans
Did anyone expect anything else
back to bottom Norwich drawing
I forsee Arsenal relegated this season with Arteta as the head coach. Poor Arsenal!!
The funniest part of all this is that Arsenal fans still haven't worked out that 1996 - 2004 was the exception.  This is just a return to the rule.
Why on earth is grealish in the title
Imagine arsenal getting relegated
Arteta in pls 😂
Feel sorry for Leno Arsenal can’t defend
Atmosphere was class today!!
Wenger out
This video should be age restricted
Championship calling
Sky not uploading highlights fast anymore BT comes in clutch
I acc cant be asked with this club smh
All grealish did was tap the ball across the box once
They run the Scottish league down the Premier league terrible a lot if hammer throwers teams
ty man city with helping our journey of getting arteta the hell out
I usually make fun of arsenal fans, but now this is very sad.
Rodri scored a beautiful goal
I bet arsenal finish 8th or lower again this season 😅
Why grealish he had one assist I didn’t watch the game so someone tell me why it’s grealish who stars
Love watching arsenal collapse
This all or nothing documentary just keeps getting better and better🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal had a whole one shot on target, let that sink in..... 😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
Lmao at torres celebrating in front of away fans 🤡🤡🤡
1:01 why has the city badge on peps shirt melted
City making arsenal look like millwall
Ederson is the man who's looked the most like a goal threat for Arsenal so far this season....
What is the point of Xhaka.  The most useless player I've ever seen😂
Big deal. Accrington Stanley could beat this Arsenal side even with 11 men. Stockport City struggle if they do score in the first half.
Grealish stars?.🤣🤣🤣 i will tell the jokes
Cheats.
banter fc
Xhaka once again doing everything he can to harm his team. The ref had no choice with the red card once he jumped in like that…
Alright, I am heading over to AFTV. This shall be fun.
SWALLOW YOUR PRIDE AND SEND FOR WENGER.
Whats up with peps city badge
It was a joke but arsenal might fully get relegated this season
I love this channel...Up the Chelsea 💙⭐⭐
Arsenal won't even win the championship after they get relegated
Grealish stars?!?!??   Blatant
Grealish is fast becoming a great. He has zero complacency, great calf’s and a lovely haircut
Arsenal were losing even before the red card Arteta needs to leave *BEFORE* his rich thick black hair starts going grey!
As a spurs fan haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa bottom
A team in the Premier league  that like to be embarrassed😳 and kind of enjoy it has to be Arsenal,The manager is in office  bcoz either he is on Basic pay rate 8.50£ .The FAwin looks like it was a fluke as Chelsea players got injured in the match. Its just 3 matches but surely he needs to go ....ooooo.oooo
Atmosphere is shocking full of plastics
Im not an Arsenal fan but their form isn't even funny anymore. Its just sad.
Did I miss something? My man got 1 assist but ‘stars’ the media are jokers
Grealish Stars! Really BT Sport, really.
Ty: dw, the lads r losing early to make a massive comeback so it looks good for the documentary
I thought arsenal didn't need any signings for defence 😂
They made feran torres look like prime Fernando torres embarrassing
Arsenal will be top of the table next year for sure.... Championship Table.
Was never a red
Ty: the lads were demoralised after ronaldo didnt come arsenal
So, what's the difference between City's last two PL games? well, in one, they comfortably destroyed the relegation favourites 5-0. in the other they beat Norwich.
Arteta sack ?????
Seems this all or nothing series might actually be quite decent 🤣🤣
Holding and chambers should resign along with arteta absolute disgrace should be ashamed
Ty: we scored too many last game, we had to make up for it
Arsenal were atrocious in this match, but xhaka didn't even come anywhere near to cancelo
Arsenal should formally just go to Sunday league
Grealish didn’t star at all
TY FROM AFTV: If xhaka didn't get sent off, we would have won 5-2
And they thought they were back after walloping West Brom on Wednesday. 3 days is a long time in English football
Martial to Arsenal
Jesus on the RW 🔥
Xhaka is a right thug.  No wonder he has acquired quite a few Red Cards.
Farsenal... What a bunch of tobies....
Arteta is the stupidest manager in the premier league, he actually THINKS Chambers and Holding are better than William Saliba as centre backs?????  Holding and Chambers  constantly gets out jumped by short forwards,  Sterling, Torres and Jota to name a few, over the last few seasons, to out jump Holding and Chambers.
Get rid of Xhaka
LOL
Not sure how Grealish starred in anything but the lineup?
every single Man City highlights video this season will now just be “Grealish does X” even if he doesn’t do anything
Just to think that if it wasn't for fan backlash, Arsenal would have been in the same league as Bayern, Juve, PSG, Barca, and Real Madrid this season. All without relegation. 🤦🤣
bad time to be a gooner
Our defence has more leaks …than the Iraqi navy 👀✋🏼😂
Arsenal ARE getting relegated. No doubt
SACK ARTETA PLZ
We must not forget that it has been raining goals
So satisfying to see arsenal on their arse
Surprised Arsenal played brilliantly against WBA all be it the second team.
When the year 11s turn up on the year 7s pitch
I don’t know if any manager could come in and instantly help this Arsenal team, their team strength is just abysmal currently 😬
What did he star in? The goal celebrations?
😂😂😂😂😂
And the Arsenal fans come out from their coffins to shout on Arteta and brainlessly ignore the real problem
'gReALiSh StArS' classic english media overhyping the england player rather than noticing the performances from Torres and Gundogan.
RIP
Why is Grealish in the title when he didn’t even do anything 😂 The media love him so much for no reason
Arteta has lost the plot
Wenger in
Grealish has one assist in the highlights…    Sycophancy rife at BT 🤷🏻‍♂️
2 games left for Arteta and he will be out, my money says Arsenal will already be in talks with a replacement
Arsenal played well give them time 🤣
Shame Ronaldo isn't there hahahahaha
arsenal in the mud
Apart from the FA cup victory, which I reckon was all luck. Everything after has been a sequence of bad decisions... Bringing in Cedric, Willian, Luiz and Mari.. Giving Holding a new contract, keeping Xhaka and giving him a new contract too, not giving Saliba a chance, letting go of Martinez, keeping and playing Kolansic... Playing 2 midfielders against a mobile City trio. Getting Ben White in over Bissouma.   If this guy (Arteta) doesn't get fired by the international break then Arsenal will be relegated.
Gaylish
who else is looking forward to AFTV after this debacle? :-)
BT trying their best to warrant Grealish’ stupid price tag
I really love making fun of Arsenal but at this point it's just sad.
I think Torres starred in that not Grealish but nevermind. It's always satisfying watching arsenal lose.
Ty has become a bit of a cult hero/meme on sky now
Wonder who will join norwich and arsenal in relegation this season?
Not a good enough performance from Arsenal but why it is always Arsenal that has to deal with a referee that is always happy to give out red cards when they’re playing a team with more money than they have.
He has to go blud
This practice session looks pretty lit.
Why are all these people so down on Arteta ? He needs a little more time, we had a glimps of what we can do midweek.
At least Arsenal are entertaining to watch... For everybody that isn't an Arsenal fan.
Arteta sacked in the morning incoming 😂
oh dear
Relegation battle looming!
Ty: we’ve only lost 3 games this season
William Shakespeare would've loved arsenal fc, the absolute embodiment of tragi comedy
Does Arteta not deserve a sacking with this display. He lined up 5-4-1 and yet conceded 5.  Defence is really shambolic. It might not have made a difference even if Arsenal line up with 8-1-1.
I think arsenal will be extremely lucky to finish in the top 10 this season
Assna in the mud fr 😩
Arsenal are a joke without Wenger.
Artatters getting the sack very soon😂
Its pretty weird how the northern british clubs have the money and beat the london clubs.apart from chelsea .
grealish got 1 assist and it's "grealish stars" lol  typical english bias
Loooooooooool
arsenal are gonna be relegated
Arsenal Goalkeeper is kinda useless 🤷‍♂️
Arsenal are the gift that keeps on giving
Grealish wasn't the best on the pitch. What's this title?
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Uno I’m someone who loves arsenal but fr I generally can’t take this anymore 🤦🏾‍♂️
Arsenal. Funny.
"Grealish stars"  Come on, no he didn't...
Tierney should leave
In arteta we trust, Artetas at the wheel and it’s only going forward
What do think of jack ?
how was xhaka's challenge a red card?
Arsenal in the championship next season then 😭
Regardless of it being a 2 footed tackle, Cancelo made a mountain out of a mole hill, barely got touched and flung himself upwards after the tackle had gone. City really are a disgrace. 😂
Can honestly see Arsenal being in a relegation battle next couple of seasons.
ARSEnal had no shots on target finished team
“Grealish stars” I mean, he played well, but he wasn’t exactly the star of the match lol
I loved how everyone tried to claim Grealish was a bad choice and Pep was off the boil. Never listen to Sun 'Journalists'.
If Arsenal had Jeremy Lynch they would have won
i forgot that arsenal was playing
Jesus = rubbish striker... City put him out wide and he does a decent job.  Martial = winger masquerading as a rubbish striker... United continue to play him centrally.
Who needs to spend lots of money on sky tv and virgin media when within minutes all the goals are uploaded to youtube within minutes!
3 games in 🤔 Ah there's always next season!!
They lose every week no point bantering them
The art of getting slapped. 👋
Ty - Robbie, we beat West Brom 6-0 and lost 5-0 to City, so this week we won 6-5 on aggregate
50mil for Ben White lmaoooo
I don’t even support Arsenal and found that difficult to watch 😮‍💨
Cedric and Chambers should never play for Arsenal again
I cry every night
In my book arsenal are the worst team in England
I think everyone made a mistake on purpose knowing Arsenal still wouldn't score lol 😆
The next signing Arsenal have to make is a new manager .
we lose every week we lose every week your nothing special we lose every week
Finished team
These goals are familiar from somewhere 🤔 oh yes Fifa21.
What the hell was Leno doing with that 5th goal? Learning to swim..ffs!
I used to find arsenal doing this bad funny now I feel genuinely sorry for the fans its a absolute shambles
Arteta first manager to get sacked this season absolute joker
serves arsenal fans right wenger was a genius, they hounded him out, be careful what u wish for
It’s Arsenal…
Embarrassing just embarrassing
:(
Wow terrible performance from arsenal
Who needs, whatsisname, some Portugese player?
Every team might as well mark down 3 points when they got Arsenal.
Arsenal going downhill but theres still more matches to go for arsenal
Arsenal fans will need councilling this season 😳
If Arsenal replace Arteta with Henry they’ll get relegated.  This team is that poor.
David Luiz see this coming and wanted out
Ty: "if we lose 1-0 to Norwich next week, and have more than 19% possession, that's a big improvement."
Grealish didn't star as much as others
I feel sorry for Arsenal.
These arsenal players are disgraceful. Out manager is disgraceful. Arteta Out Edu Out Kroenke Out
How did grealish star ?
This club has let me down all my life. Wonder if we’ll ever win the Premier again
Troopz and AFTV should be fun tonight 🤣
Why did xhaka get sent off for that football is so soft now 😂
Finished team
Last few days for Xhaka to leave. Clearly frustrated. Arsenal not going anywhere with Arteta.
From a Scottish point of view. Tierney needs to put in a transfer request ASAP and get out of that team. I fear he'll regress as a player and we need him for the national team!
Pep promoted Arteta from putting out the cones to putting out the manakins
We can't afford 2 let this carry on because its 100 gunna get worse the bezt thing to do is sack him and bring someone in whos knows what there doing b4 it gets half way though the season an we can't qualify 4 Europe give the new manger the best opportunity because arteta is way out of his leauge it was a stupid idea 2 give him the job
Has a arsenal fan this is disappointing.
so when is arteta getting sacked
Arsenal are pathetic I’m actually embarrassed for them but anyway we go Ronaldo. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
No idea why Arteta is still manager of Arsenal. He should quit and ask for his old job at mancity, peps number 2
Arsenal are the team most likely to be relegated
What has happened to Arsenal?! I remember them being a solid mid-table team like a Newcastle or Fulham, and now they're propping up the league?? How the middling have fallen.
Hope that's not on the tele...
Who needs penaldo when we got ferrangoalski
On  behalf of Manchester united condolences 🤲🏾🕊 arsenal
No Mendy today??.
I dont want anyone saying anything was leno fault the deffening from arsenal wasnt there the park the bus dnt work when u dnt no what ur doing arteta has gt 2 go
Pep really said in his interview "I learn't many things working with him for 2/3 years, he is beyond good". Taking the piss he knows Arteta isn't good but Arsenal fans will back him blindly even more
Now we have something to laugh about and remind arsenal if they make fun of any club
Good win today, but it won't be so easy against Wycombe Wanderers.
😂🤣😂. yeah this is about right for Arsenal.. they now bottom of the table with 3 loses. no goals scored and considered 9 goals
They absolutely raped them.   Too soon ?
Robbie from aftv is the luckiest man he saw the future 😉
City does not need Kane, they just want to get him so no-one can get him. Its like a monopoly player who has a property card on each street and is not willing to trade
Bang down to earth again  gooners 🤣🤣🤣🤣
The really bad thing for arsenal is I’m not even remotely surprised by this result.
Hahahahaha
Ty: Our players were intimidated because they thought they were facing the entire city of Manchester.
Leno just isn’t good enough 😭😔
Are they trying to get relegated 😂😂😂😂
Bt love the Grealish agenda,the man wasn't even their best players
Red card for that challenge? Football is turning into such a pansy sport.
Why is grealish highlighted in the thumbnail like the man single handled took out arsenal with his one assist
Ferran Torres had 3 goal contributions.... But no, let's slap Grealish in the Title. Bloody British Media.
If the players cannot execute what Arteta wants, then there is a big problem. We will see when everyone is fit and ready to play, if there is any big difference.
Man the gunners are murder and they have the highest ticket prices in the EPL...I'm surprised they van even sell 10k tickets
Arsenal need to buy Nat Phillips for £50 million. NOW.
Grealish made one assist... not sure about starring in the game!
outstanding stuff from arsenal! the hunt for survival is still on
Don Robbie's bank balance is gone up
Ty: our goal difference is +1 in the last week so this week has been a success
That shouldn’t have been a red
Worst London club...Arsenal. A manager with no experience.  He was a average midfielder who would not make the Barcelona D team.   They should bring in a three manager team of Adams Wright Dixon just to steady the ship.
It's a bad start to the season, but I expect Arsenal to stay up.
Wenger out.
"We hammered West Brom so this game was just a friendly" Ty.
I hate English media and their bias opinions on English players. How did he shine when he had 1 assist whereas Torres had 1 assist and 2 goals??
Ty: we played really well, could have been worse if we had conceded a 6th goal 😂
That red card. Looked like a very good dive 😂
Why sign Ramsdale???
I hope arsenal get relegated they deserve to and i hope they perish down the football pyramid and find themselves battling league 2 play offs
dont need the goat city , united or chelsea for the title
I’m here for the comments…. 😁😁
WHO in that team is taking charge? There needs to be some hair dryer treatment and I don't even think Arteta is giving it let alone some of the older players.
Man Arsenal might get relegated this year. The only time they are top of the league is when no games have been played yet and league table is in alphabetical order. LOL
Arteta in 😂
Sorry, I fail to see where the £100m dolphin “starred” 🤨
Where has Arsenal's defence gone 😢
Don't forget, Arsenal is a 'Big 6' football club....
At this rate Arsenal first team will struggle to beat their counterpart Woman's squad
aftv gonna be a goldmine
Those double advertising boards make it challenging to focus on the game.
All I’m saying is xhaka’s tackle was solid! Got %100 of the ball, the other bloke jumped up in the air acting like his ankle fell off...... there was no contact at all LOL..... but I guess rules are rules and that’s a red card..... however we still would of lost 2 or 3-0...... arteta changes tactics and formations every game I guess the players don’t even know what kind of player they are anymore...... we need conte or Diego Simone in real quick!
Considering arsenal had 10 players. They did ok.
arteta out now
BT grealish didn’t star it was Torres 🤨
Ty: In the first half, the sun was in our eyes
WE UAVE OUR ARSENAL BACK
Ty: We mustn’t forget this is our THIRD loss of the season
Its turning out that this season, your home and away games will be deemed dissapointing if the game highlights aren't entirely goals against Arsenal
Teams like arsenal makes City looks power house , when they not , I can't wait for Man utd , Chelsea,  Liverpool,  to smash man city ,
Pep spanked Arteta.....just sack arteta, hes a fukwit...
🚨Breaking News:  The Premier League board have given Arsenal the exception to join the Super League. If Arsenal can not save themselves, someone has too. This is getting ridiculous. Not a Top 6 team anymore. Your bottom of the Premier League. Arsenal next game vs Norwich both team fighting for relegation.
I sure do love being an arsenal fan😐
Nothing can save Arsenal
Wenger out,wenger out please prepare the next banner Arteta out,Arteta out.
Ederson is better than any of arsenal’s midfielders
If Arsenal finish anywhere near the top ten this season, we'll have the manager of the season.
New Season, Same Arsenal 😢💀
Arsenal are done for
Grealish stars? If this isn’t discrimination then what is it. Pure bias for English players it’s acc embarrassing
Disgrace not the arsenal I know
As an Arsenal fan this was a shocking performance by the team .
Disgrace not the arsenal I know
Areteta out Rooney in.
TY: We mustn’t forget that Man City are at the top of the league
Grealish stars, is in one highlight lol
How tf did Grealish “star” 🤣🤣
That Rodri goal was so good
City fans telling Ederson to shot in his own half was absolute violation 🤣
Big game for the Gunners next week against Norwich, both teams fighting for survival. Trust the process!
It's Man City, so it's fair enough they lost - but not scoring a goal in 3 games and conceding 9 is a joke.
Arsenal the bitches of the premier league
Arteta needs to go by end of week it’s just embarrassing he has no idea what he’s doing and ruining us
I read last week Artete has till October, I’m not to sure about that now.
Think this will be artetas last game in charge
Jokeman fc.
That's never a red card. Unacceptable.
Whenever I feel down I just remember that I don't have to support Arsenal
ARTETA OUT
Grealish has a hand in setting up one goal in a 5-0 win: "Grealish stars"?
Arsenal are actually terrible 😂
I don’t know what’s been destroyed more, Arsenal this season or Benjamin Mendys career
Arteta's gotta go surely
Hahahahahaha what happened to that big confidence building vs Baggies youth?  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 joke of a club
arsene Wenger was carrying us.this is a disgrace arteta is division 2 manager,likes of chamberlain,holden a puddings they belong i championship at best.arteta needs go and very quickly
My prediction was 7-1
Its painful watching arsenal n im not even a fan.
8 ads later
I can't believe arsenal once were title competitors 😂
Cant wait for AFTV
Dead team 💀
Silva’s statue has more goal threat than arsenal
Arteta needs sacked
Most one sided game I've seen since England v San Marino
As a Leicester fan who's team got similar treatment last week, I shouldn't laugh. And yet here I am, laughing at Arsenal 🤣🤣
If only we had a striker       🤷🏻‍♂️
Arsenal relegation pending....
Grealish is a talented player but all this hype is going to make alot of football fans hate him. The guy did a simple header and the commentator said what's class by Grealish. The media never learns from their past mistakes stop Hyping one man as England's great hope as this guy is apart of a special generation of talent. Forreal it's actually ridiculous the way the media train is moving
The bt sport team have enjoyed their journeys to Manchester. 11 goals scored live on Bt sport between the games involving man united and City (man united 5-1 Leeds and man City 5-0 arsenal)
That really was a complete whitewash, what have Arsenal got to do improve from this?
Troopz is running out of cali
City are now trying to get Lewandowski why
So Piss with Arsenal yes!,I said It I no longer support Arsenal I’ll be supporting man United life is to short Arsenal is just toxicccc
Love your vids keep up the cracking work
Wait wait wtf did grealish  do
At this rate I think Arsenal might struggle in the championship
Atleast claude is in peace now he doesn't have to watch this the aftv mob still do 😂
Wow what a close game could of gone either way lol
No way was that challenge a red card. This sport is ruined now.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 this is superb
Arsenal fans spent years trying to get rid of Wenger because he didn't spend a lot of money...behold the glory of a £135 million transfer window.  Bottom of the leauge. Zero goals scored. Nine conceded.
I bet Arsenal regret releasing Jeremy Lynch now
Man City Ruthless
Sounds quieter than a Sunday league game.
Arsenal, consistent if nothing else so far this season.
TY from aftv     20 is a bigger number than 1
Well, looks like the next fixture will be vital for Assna, up against Norwich for the battle for survival!
Arsenal have got as much chance of surviving this season as rob holdings hair line.
ITS TIME TO GO
Welcome to Man City vs Sunday League teams
Must be sickening being an Arsenal fan honestly
and people think arsenal are bigger than chelsea 😂😂😂😂
i’m supporting ronaldo until his contracts up
Ty: they are getting used to fans being there
Trust the process 😂😂😂
I  knew that if any other player scored 5 hatricks and assisted 2 somehow Grealish would still be in the title 😂
Ty: We MUSNT FORGET, The sun was too bright, we were blinded by the light and our players couldn’t see properly
And that's a Red card! What has this game become PATHETIC!
Jesus christ arsenal
If arsenal forfeit every match from now they will end up with a better goal difference.
Ozil curse
That one there was a violation personally I wouldn’t have it.
Grealish? More like torres and Jesus
English bias lmaoo  Shouldn't it be "torres stars" not greilish loool
Look at all those plastic Arsenal fans leaving on the 35th min yet everyone says City only has them
Arsenal will get relegated and think "atleast we don't have to have nightmares about that kit anymore" then Coventry will beat them 5-0
Sunday league.
Arsenal so far this season with 3 straight losses, no goals scored and 9 goals conceded
Ferran Torres is special. He is showing some glimpse of why he is wearing the no.21 shirt.
It’s come to the point where arteta doesn’t even say anything in the locker room at half time
lol
Arsenal spent £135 mil this season to go to Championship  😂😂😂
Arsenal fans should have been in uproar about their season at least two seasons ago. Too late now.
All or nothing this season 🔥🔥
Arteta, xhaka, elneny, holding, chambers, kolasinac, hector, willian & pablo need to leave, Championship level at best
bring on the relegation fight !
ARSENAL FC: All I want from This Christmas is 3 points 🤣
1:26 how is that even a foul? Man what a good dive
The fact that arsenal might actually get relegated this season is shocking
1:14 Ederson taunting Arsenal to try scoring against him.
Grealish stars ? U mean ferran Bernardo cancelo Jesus n rodeo
My team play in League 1 yet I still feel justified laughing at Arsenal 😂
Damn, Arsenal might actually get relegated LOL Imagine...
Arsenal are gonna win the quadruple mark my words
There’s only one man to save Arsenal Big Sam Allydyce
City are a disgrace putting a training match on and making 8 years olds where Arsenal kits
0 shots on goal 1 off, 20 percent of the ball, even with 11 men same would of happened, terrible.
Arsenal are shocking
And people think Manchester City won't breeze the league lol,I'm not even a city fan..other teams need to realise they are way ahead of the rest,only Liverpool upped their game the last few years to be real challenges to them and credit to Klopp and Liverpool for that!
Good Artetanoon
what's happened to Ben White?
I’ve been an arsenal fan my whole life it’s sad to see they are doing very bad this season so far but I am still supporting them I ain’t a fake fan
Imagine being 4-0 down and they sub on Raheem Sterling Zero shots on target. Bottom of the table. Aresnal are finished
City win 5-0 without KDB.
Like a training game for city that’s so embarrassing
Trust the process 😂😂
Arteta’s done! How can he continue! 🔴⚪️😴😔
That is the most Xhaka challenge I've ever seen
Arsenal following the footsteps of Norwich 5-0, 5-0. The only thing Arsenal haven't followed is relegation and this is the season it will happen.
Wow hahaahahah
Finished club
Came for the comments
Be funny if the gunners got relegated....nice Rodri goal that.
Arsenal is gonna get relegated i don’t care🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Arsenal hoping to win the championship next season.... a trophy is a trophy
Arsenal are back!!
And to think that Arsenal have spent the most in the transfer window is comedy gold😂
poor mikel
Arsenal fans thought they were back against their win against West Brom u23s
There's no excuse to get outbeaten like that
Good goals good fans class performance
Ty: the red was unjustified - we should have won the game
Well played by Arsenal. Spent the most during this transfer window.
Conte would be amazing for Arsenal
In the second half, Ederson went inside ate some food, took a shower, played a game of fifa then came outside to join in the celebrations.
At least Norwich can be glad they might not finish bottom this season.
Rip Arsenal Football Club
Ty: we’re only 6 points of top 4...
Arsenal have 0 goals in the prem this season 😂😂
Embarrassing
How did Grealish star, it was Torres
Xhaka always gets a red
A bald legend once said *“ITS TIME TO GOOO!”*
Documentary - Arsenal: All Or Nothing Duration - 6 hr 35 minutes Lead Characters - Stan Kroenke , Mikel Farteta , Granit Xhaka , Penbayemayang Special apperarance - Wojciech Szczęsny , Jack Wilshere , Jeremy Lynch Genre - Irrestible Comedy ImdB rating - 1000/10
Arsenal are poor
Arsenal only conceding 5 is the biggest footballing shock of the millennium!
Arteta the best manager in the world
AHAHAHAHAHAHAH
ARTETA IN
I speak for every Arsenal Fan when i say that Kroenke is the best Club owner in our history .The smart decisions by Kroenke will save Arsenal .Trust the process COYG
Banter FC
Arsenal -> championship
I'm heading over to Arsenal TV straight after this.. 😁
August 28th 2011 Man U vs Arsenal 8-2. Arsenal finished 3rd that season  August 28th 2021 Man City vs Arsenal 5-0  We must trust the process. That's why I'm Arteta in
Next trophy arsenal will win will be the championship 😅
I was in History class and we were learning about Ancient empires. We learned about the Romans, Egyptians and the Aztecs. Today we moved onto something called Arsenal, an Ancient British empire that conquered England many times during the 1930s, but are now finished. Sad story.
Arsenal’s script   1. Start well, look aggressive  2. Concede after 15 mins  3. 1-0 down at HT 4. Lose by 2 or more goals
That’s it! That seals the deal! I’m no longer an Arsenal fan. I’ve been an Arsenal fan since 1989 and a season ticket holder since 1990. I will no longer watch on TV or renew my tickets. I’m taking my fan hood to Liverpool where they actually know how to run a football team.
I speak for every Arsenal Fan when i say that Kroenke is the best Club owner in our history .The smart decisions by Kroenke will save Arsenal .Trust the process COYG
Ty: We are doing a great job trying to replace Arteta with Thierry Henry. Good job :)
Ferran torres, impressive!  *Do they need a striker?*
Lollllllllllllllllll
Arsenal are getting relegated this season.
*’WHENS IT GOING TO END WOBBIE!!’*
Arsenal are a mess, simple as (although don’t let that take away from City’s brilliant performance)
Banter FC 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
What a shambles
