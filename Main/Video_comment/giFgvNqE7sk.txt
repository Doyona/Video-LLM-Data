I really enjoyed that Paddy, brilliant, you're a winner.
Those marines need to take off there sweaty socks to gain traction ffs
Funny thing is, I'd beat most marines. I say this because they have standardized training without real world application. Our defense force is weak as fuck  Hey at least we aren't china
Overcome all marines unstoppable 🎉
Gayest possible video title “paddy the baddie takes on 10 marines”
Paddy has all the skills to beat islam but is his will stronger
if i saw him in a bar i would not think he was the monster beast he is legend
Massive reason why America can't win a war is the fact that they can't fight.
paddy 200 pound
i always think of the word baddy as like the villain, which you never come across as, i get its a nickname that rhymes, but im gonna stick with paddy the badass 🙂 your always too humble and down to earth to be the baddy (outside of pre fight interviews which i know are mostly reactions to your opponent shit talking, dont shit talk a Scouse, it will back fire🤣). i get the irony that im calling you humble after you just said you would drop Ngganou on his head too btw 🤣 but i do genuinley believe you wouldnt back down from him or turn down that fight, hence badass
Not only is he a pro, he's top ten in his weight class
Normal guy vs 1 marine.. result, man gone, paddy vs  marine corp training then 1 on 1 with each marine. Paddy… It’s 1 of the hardest workouts all week 😂😂😂
OHHH, PADDY THE BAAADDY
WHat a sad era for MMA it is....
So impressive Paddy 🤟
I had experience in jui jitsu as a kid and i would run through 10 marines straight in mcmap training, this shouldnt be hard to a ufc fighter lmao
First time using subs
Go Paddy go you the man hope you retire undefeated uninjured
Cool 👍 proppa crap music tho. Had to mute it😂
I'm an old fart (56) but I love LARPing as an MMA fighter doing an armbar when I work out on the back extension machine. Never hurts to be strong there in case I get jumped and my attacker leaves an arm free.
Topuria could never
Love to watch this lad fight proper sportsmanship’s ❤️☘️🇮🇪
These ufc fighters are walking lethal weapons. Tapping out 10 jacket trained killers is wild
Dude i love you!
Undoubtedly some of these guys wrestled at College.  Paddy is a Baddy.
Bro you just gained even more of my respect, keep on fighting!
This camera work man, wth get that parkinsons dude a stabilizer
I didn't know Paddy b4 this but after seeing this I'm a big fan.. He's a real one 👍🏾 Those Marines are Marsoc. Check the flag. Those guys are KILLERS 4 REAL💯🇺🇸
I've been wondering for years how tf Paddy Pimblett makes 155
Brilliant video well done
js done the research paddy is not over weight bc an overweight person that is 5ft10 is about 179lbs and paddy is 156lbs
Best advert for Jiu Jitsu ever....
The marines are the real baddies
Paddy should be an instructor for these guys.
ILIAN TOPURIA🗣☠💀☠
peep the red patch 👀
This video made my eyeballs start vibrating.
If paddy was not a UFC champion he would have made a great marine lad👍👍👍👍👍
crazy
Don’t know where this came from but glad it popped up. Really enjoyed this!
Tbf to paddy all the fat is just on his face he’s still in good shape just his face changes so much haha
Paddy the Baddy!  I want a TShirt!
Parece una señora con la permanente
Those marines understood about 40% of what paddy said
2 words... confidence & humility, that's Paddy! Those two words generally don't go together, but, they do for Paddy! More men with those two attributes, together, can change the world. 👍
Paddy is a great lad, and he loves ta GRAZE! But I don't think he has missed weight many times if ever?
all staged , Topuria will eat him alive
What an awesome character!  What a great attitude he has!
Lmao they tried to wear him out to be able to take em very smart 😂
4:25
Nice
Paddy is literally fighting for us all a true champion 🕺
Y en un concurso a comer hamburguesas comería mas que 20 Marines
Reminds me of Hell week during HS🤙🇺🇲
paddy is so underated
Get a haircut limey 😂
U r very fat .... U r never going to pass t weight Challenge agaist topuria 😊
our dude eats pizza and tacos until he balloons up to 200.  then still kills it.  nobody else in the 155 class can lose 45 lbs in 2 months and win a fight. good luck, ilia. you're going to hospital, boy.
Paddy is the man bro I always wanted to see him in public cause I feel like he is hilarious man gotta love his attitude never takes himself too serious that’s A+ attitude
Yk Paddy hit a buffet after that😂😂😂
Love ya paddy❤❤❤
o7
❤
Who is the best you ever rolled with ,who you had no chance with  you that do you think of the great graciedlan
How long did you take judo
Having a slow motion video for them to follow enables a faster acclimation   how do you teach your refined skill
So patty what technic do you teach these guys
Paddy is the real quality fighter he takes it look like the opponents are amwtuers
Paddy just made +10 fans joining the club)
To you native english speakers: Do you understand what he says without subtitles put on?
On summer… ON MAN… PATTE
His accent sounds like another language
Boss that
Those guys train hard paddy in difficult this round should train more times with them
The best fighter 🫀
He’s a light heavyweight fighting at light weight such a bully
His experience of being carried by that guy was one of the funniest moments, because I've seen him eating, the guy is fucking strong!😂🤣😅
Ilia topouria riendo al ver esta gorda
to do that to these killers,  wow
I think your ground game might be your strength 💪
Me gusta una chica llamada Merari Salomé es mi reyna❤ ella me hace hacer más cardio que ustedes.
8:04 Savage 🎉
Paddy is sound and real asf 👊
No eres rival para ilia, disfrutaré de tu derrota 😂 saludos desde Spain
This really puts into perspective how fit these soldiers are. They're basically pro athletes in their own right.
jjj me encanta paddy pimblett
At first, the Marines make Paddy look slow and untrained, but in jiu jitsu combat, the situation changes drastically.
he's literally just taking these dudes on one after the other so if he does lose its honestly just going to be from being tired
😇😇😇🤣👍👍
Marines are tough as Nails...awesome
THIS is who topuria should fight next
He did this with a hangover. That's what "I got to bed late means in irish.
This is great!
qe mal me caes jajaja
Bad  Men  man that was cool
Thank you Paddy
If Paddy competes in the domain of a Marine, like operation one on one with the weakest tiniest Marine. Paddy will still be dead.
T O P U R I A  is coming bro , get hidden...😂😂😂
Good shit. This is the type of Brotherhood the West was built on! o7
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Paddy defeated Ft el tapoes 😂😂😂
Those marines are fit as hell and have fighting spirit, but they're easily defeated by a British foulmouth wrecking their sensitivities 😂😂
Now try it with the Marines getting a training K-Bar to use when they see fit during it .   Hint the Marines in an actual fight cheat every time.
5:39
atleast teach the soldiers how to fight 😭
bro after finding out paddey i aam now obsesed with ufc also paddey tought me not to hide some of my emotions love paddy sm
Te coge el español y te pone fino filipino
Paddy the fatty lol I love you
Awesome f cking video
Paddy vs Jake Paul.
Pddy we need subtitles 😂
How can you hate on this guy?  Paddy is a solid dude.
THE BADDY AHAHAHAHAHAA MAAN
He’s such a cool guy. He’s at the top of the game for mental control…awesome And he is an amazing athlete and fighter
PADDY LOVE FROM BANGLADESH
2 years later I just noticed bro was training with Marine Raiders
Ilia its going to smash you
Only one cute Marine 😅😅😅Semper fi
W
13 segundos con topuria. Pero no creo q acepte pelear contigo. Es muy bajo tu nivel frente al de él
Paddy tiene cara de loco.. Pero de esos locos q quieres para tu amigo jajaja..
Defeat marrins like a kid 😂
Bro TANKING 10 Marines and not even at full power is crazy! haha
Damn, Sean Strickland needs to call out these boys, no only Navy Seals😂
We know what you mean😂
So now u tube is going to be all about  paddy .lady eats a hamburger  lady ties his shoelaces lady eats at a restraint paddy gets fat pady meets Lisa what absurd  crape on the internet
topuria goes for you dude
Do Americans understand Paddy?
Isn't it dangerous to go up and down like paddy?
We arent trained to take on world class fighters, we are trained to kill the enemy while wearing full battle rattle with a weapon.
Topuria will destroy this guy
Esa mano en el 7:20 media dudosa 👀
You can do all that shit but guys who train to fight all day are different they learn when to and when to not expand energy
I don’t care what anyone says, fighters or not. Tappin 10 combat vets one after another after doing full conditioning training is still hard for any pro fighter
“Sorry lad, I’m a fat bastard.” “Sorry I’m a fat lad” 😂😂😂
PADDY why don't you try more advanced people like DEVGRU; DELTA FORCE🇺🇸 or S.A.S; S.B.S🇬🇧❓
Pady pimblet por favor lo pueden doblar en Español latino.. gracias
"im sorry im fat"
how can u not love this dude
i consider this man is so brave but i have an question?? If ever you meet khabib in octagon ? You win or not?
Why ls he obese?
“Stalemate” nah
Paddy VS Topuria 💣💣💣💣 Il match dell'anno...
topuria is waiting for you 😈
obviously he´s so good on the ground but El Matador is going to sleep him badly 💀
Paddy i am big fan love your videos! ❤
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Paddy es un pobre pringado, el tipo de persona sin clase ni talento que enturbia el deporte con escándalos y trata de llamar la atención como un niño pequeño, pobre bebé gruñón; tienes mucho que aprender de Topuria en cuanto a clase, buen gusto y estilo.  Pd: Ese peinado tipo príncipe de cuento es muy ridículo jajajajajajajaja perdedor
日本でパディの活躍を応援してます！ライト級王者になってくれ🫅
Come on Paddy, you have to submit Topuria.
Paddy I’ve got mad respect for him! Wow he is a real dude
the thing about professional athletes vs normal people (even incredibly well trained and in shape ones) is that they just dont make mistakes, and as soon as they see their opponent make one they are on top of it.
It's the live action of Cosmo Imai from Kengan Ashura
What a star. And funny,not like Mc. GREGOR
I like how the Marines were asking how to connect to their feelings. That was so wholesome haha
Paddy is easily one of my favorites
wut the hail is he even talking about,i can't understand a thing lol
"As I say, sorry I'm so fat, lad" HAHAHHAHAHA
khabib would submit the sh1t outta ya. Like a walk in the park, another day at the office.
I love everybody is squiting tuning into what Paddy is saying because of that accent
I dont undentand his english
Congrats ! How natural r u :D You do not care about being fat :DDD And easily win all 10 rounds with the marines, RESPECT!
🦈
Coolest video I've seen on YouTube in ages.
Paddy is one of my favorite fighters. He is a classy guy
topuria awaits you,,, and me too....
Ist die Einheit sowas wie die Totenkopf SS, wegen des weißen Totenkopfes, der da auf schwarzem Grund im Dojo hängt?....ich frage für einen Freund 😂 10 Marines abgezogen, hintereinander - so gewinnen die keinen Krieg, wenn das die "Elite" sein soll😂🎉
Semper Fi.
paddy vs topuria
paddy you wont win your next fight sorry  but you show your self up there in the ufc  you say you will never nock me out who says that   YOUR TIME IS SOON SAY GOODNIGHT  your fight for your chin chin and choke choke be on its way  humble TIME on thE< way Godbless u sir OZZY
this is the difference between fighters and weapons
Paddy is great Warrior
No way he's beating topuria😅
Real fan of Paddy for life here!  Paddy is special!
It's crazy because in hand to hand combat each submission he got was a kill. He would have killed 10 highly condition marines while being fat and out of shape lol
Paddy is the goat of mma in Ireland and Michale Dunlop is the king of mnt  aka Isle of Man tt
Soon: Paddy vs Topuria 0:1
Paddy sure did look exhausted. 😂  Marines should have taken him out in the field after PT 😅. I don't know who Paddy is but i see UFC. much respect for doing what he did.  Paddy how exhausted were after the work out? 😊 ( you did awsome ) Paddy just imagine after that work out you get ready to hit the field and train for combat 😂 and while doing that you're still doing work out 😅😅😅😅 with little sleep or no sleep for a day or 2 😢😂😂😂😂 *accident tear 😂. That's why when a Marine has the time to sleep they will take it. Or as soon as your told "sleep" it won't be like "ugh I can not sleep" 😅...unless you're in combat then more understandable "I can't sleep"😢😢😢😢 ....don't worry Paddy takes time to get used to it 😊
Wat about this channel ? Ah yes , YES INDEED. MUR MUR MURDERER STYLE . Fully set up , speakers ,turntable pre amp an ting. Manassa.
What an awsome dude paddy of you ever in Sweden i would like to have a beer with you! Watched you on Beard Meats Food you my dude is a fkn star!
No cardboard box gym held together with duct tape and cum, no crayon breaks and the weights arnt made of concrete filled milk jugs. I call BS
i have no idea what the fuck is he saying
OHHH PADDY THE BAAAAADYYYY, You are absolutly the goat
Word-class BJJ and personality 👏👏👏
Damn I miss being in the Marines. You should have partied with them after. You would have tapped out at that point. We are great at getting after it after we do the work.
The bro in a mounted triangle saying: "Stalemate, reset?" 🤣!
this is what peak male performance physique looks like—Paddy the Baddy
Goes to show don't matter how big or how strong you are it's all on movement and technique
Paddy just taking a marine team in Jiu jitsu
@150 wait? really?! man paddy's weight cuts must be insane .....
Lmao the sorry im so fat is so perfect
Honestly you are the best not just because you believe, it's because you had inspired yourself to that. I felt really down these days but in the mat I've learned that all my battles I have to chest up and face them. And you really share that in this video.
You're fun to watch Paddy
This is the positive and productive version of strong masculinity the world needs, not sick angry losers like Andrew Tate
Okay, Paddy is a proper G for this.  Semper fi
Would be better without music...
Paddy is the world class athlete . Great inspiration the young men keep up the good work,
that's one way to lose all the fat lol
Bonnie blue beat you by miles mate
Ju jitsu the bomb
You can go to fight people who are hard core trained in combat arts.  If they have no ground training and get taken down it's over.  You don't even have to be Paddy the Baddy.  My traditional "Dojo" there was no one else that had any ground game at all.  It was almost embarrassing and this was four decades ago.  Then we started going to different places to blend in other training.  Was fun and great learning experiences.  These Marines are so lucky to have someone like Paddy come and spend time with them.  I'm jealous to be honest.  Also a couple years late to the comments.
bro, he is stoned :D
Awesome job…He is a down to earth call it like it is character. Best of luck Paddy I enjoy your work!!
Go to Dagestan)))
Come to train with Mexico’s soldiers!!
"Paddy pimblett ez money🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷" Renato moicano
Rolling about , trying to wrestle people in warfare ? Thats why they have guns !
100 gorillas vs one paddy baddy
jujitsu with socks...
Ce type est tellement attachant il n'y a que les britanniques pour produire ce genre de phénomène extraordinaire avec cette folie, cette force de caractère et cet humour c'est génial et fascinant
Paddy 100% got my respect, and I'll bet you anything these marines got 100% respect for Paddy as well!
Umm... Marines are not trained for sport fighting.  If you let the Marines be Marines in this, Paddy would lose - most likely his life, and maybe a few fingers, eyeball, testicles and an ear.
Dang one of the instructors was in my battalion and led my Cpl’s course in January 2025
And now we start our day
Oorah!
Paddys face gets so fat he turns Russian
6:32 Paddy crossed legse, marine almost had him. P.s. I know Paddy was easy on them and it was guy number 6
Good job Paddy - we love you man
Watching this so many times never get sold
Wow awesome video, makes me proud to be from Merseyside and having you present yourself as a tough cookie. It's awesome, I don't know how you got there, but it's all good stuff. Well done
all i hear from day to day in my head is paddy the baddy the crowd singing it XD
Jesus said turn the other cheek!! He said love thy enemies not try to kill them and gain the world to prophet his soul ...repent or perish jesus is coming back soon !!and stop glorifying violence 😤 it makes me mad 😠
When you were teaching, did they actually understand everything you were saying??
This is exactly what the mikitary should require of its top special forces.
I wish You well Paddy,I've followed your progress since your start with the UFC  ,good luck in all you do
Those "pushups" were silly.    Do 50 slow, elbow-break pushups.
Can you stop flippin us off lad😆
It's great that the Marines probably learned quite a bit from him
f$&@ the haters…Paddy Worldwide!!
Paddy is the best..
Honor Courage Commitment  Mental Physical Character
what accent is that.
Paddy is my son and I's favorite fighter.
11:16 fart
Great guy
Paddy is a badass for sure, and so are the Marines that didn't do any death moves on him and Australia. ❤
Paddy is bad ass,
The next champions
Paddy is Special Forces UK; That is the kind of Soldier and attitude we need.
Last time i saw 1 person take on that many guys, was in debbie does dallas.
He beat 10 Marines in a row.
Does a marine workout then taps every one of them while in the fat paddy suit .  Review: Hardest workout *this week*! Just this week :P
Very cool!
🤳🏾✊🏾💪🏾💪🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
No entendí una mierda de lo que dijo, Pero te amo Paddy
Wow, this video is full of motivation.  03:20 What's the music, please?
0:02 This is why i dont do jujitsu . . wtf is he grabbing on lol
Absolutely solid. This guy's an inspiration
Standard day of PT
just by the sound of you when you instruct, you know your trade and you practice it well
Fatty the baddy before paddy
every video i watch of this guy the more im impressed and respect him even more. dude got the right mindset and a great fighter
Paddy is a LEGEND.. last fight he DESTROYED Chandler!
In a mma fighter v marine fight, the mma fighter will always win hands down
Proves mcmap is trash lol
That girl was like you're carrying me 😂
For a top athlete he sure comes of as a great teacher too!
I find it hard to reconcile both being honest to yourself about your mental difficulties on the one hand, yet wielding the slightly delusional confidence that you are unbeatable on the other hand? What's the common denominator here?
3:00 "I have to say sorry for being so fat"  You should be more sorry about your lunge and squat depth, fatty. Your legs will not be kind to you when you're older if you don't get that shit in order while you're young.
Seen the Strickland video the other day, and then I came across this one today, and this one by far is a better representation. Strickland just wanted to be a dick
He just went up against radio repair technicians. They didn't even let him near the grunts.
This was enjoyable to the last second. Awesome!
“I’m sorry for bein a fat bastard” I love that dude 😂😂
Love this kid!  Has such a great mindset.  They try to compare him to others, and tbh, he's in a class of his own.
Paddy and  Lenny McLean are my only concerns in the 100 Brits vs. 100 Americans debate.
Dana’s got you on the rise to Connor status.  Good work. 🇺🇸🇺🇸
Which can Paddy do faster: defeat 10 marines or gain 10 pounds?
Wow fist fighting 10 marines  at once........great job paddy.
Grüsse aus der Schweiz, bist ein toller Typ. Wünsche dir alles Gute und Gottes Segen!
"Sorry lad.."
I laughed because the only time the Marines flinched was when Paddy swore. They are such wholesome boys. Paddy should come to Australia where his swearing would be mild compared to Aussie soldiers.
Not 9th crime
Paddy is the real deal.
😂❤
Ppl forget Paddy is a black belt lol he will steamroll everyone in there back to back with ease
This is all well and good, but I don't think one of those marines understood a word of what you said
I have such a biased and sour view of marines/soldiers. It stems from struggling to understand how someone can want to fight in unjust wars and from a semi educated assumption about toxic masculinity within the army and it leaves me automatically expecting marines to be c*nts.   These guys are great. I knew Paddy was an absolute lad, but this is a little insight into how wrong I am about soldiers. Listening to them hearing paddy out about crying, the comment on here from their deputy chaplain, how respectful they all are… gonna try keep this in mind in future 👌
Watching a bunch of marines be carried by other marines is the funniest shit ever
walked into the camp looking like an Oompa Loompa from charlie and the chocolate factory and still dominated lol
10 an 0 go on paddy England's proud bro
He is the real deal ...
I wouldn't make it past the hand shake 😂😂, but I'm sixty an broken by widow makers lol
I want a turn.... AZ bet u wont!
paddy  a long time ago my dad said i looked like you bc of my shaggy hair and eversince i found out who you are ive been obbssed and have been wanting to fight ive been wanting to start training im 5'9 160 pounds do you think i can do it
Rooting for you Paddy! Love your attitude and respect your hustle.
Hey paddy your safe my life. Thank you
Lmao, Marines scooting along with their jiu jitsu legs into battle.
I teased you in another video but mad respect, hard work here, 🙂‍↕️
When aspinal said that UFC fighters would choke marines 9 out of 10 times and then some marine dude in the comments said he was being generous, and that UFC fighters would choke marines 10/10 times, I thought it was a joke. Obviously, I was wrong...
I know a few black belts with 2 and 3 red tabs that are punching the air after Paddy tapped everyone 😂
Love ya Paddy, thanks for rolling with our Marines!!! Have you ever seen so many guys excited to get worked over?
Awesome vid and respect for opening up.
Hell yea
That one bad mfer 🙏🏽🔥🔥🔥
Phenomenal mind set  Real
Very very cool! Thanks for showing our Marines how to kick some ass like you do and going into mental health. I think for men in general this is a constant battle for a lot of us. I've noticed it a lot more the older I get.
They’re just American marines ……😂Hollywood soldiers
7:21 why did he grab his balls
Seeing my old 1stSgt Davalos is nostalgic to me
u gotta go pt with the grunts (more risk for injury )
US Army, wake up and let's go
These videos are always against POGs lmao fuckin HQ Co. "UFC fighter vs desk jockey that has time for the gym". Every Marine has a rifle, man. I guess the infantry guys are always in the field actually training whenever youtubers are around.
Top bloke
paddy pretending he doesn't have insane cardio... what  gent 🤣🤣
wheres yo head at
Scousers hate to be associated with being British but that constant need to apologise is what binds us all together - mental that you tapped them all out
Does anyone know what the choke he did on marine number 10 is called?  I haven't seen it before
Paddy getting his weight up 👀 i remember a certain chump saying "if he gets in my weight class I'll fight him"
ive taught quite a few marines in that very dojo. Thats at 9th comm Bn.
Hahaha paddy pady apoligizing sorry i am so fat at 3:00. Love the man
Hard not to like Paddy - I remember him from the Cage Warrior days. I thought he would beat Chandler, but I didn't think he would dismantle him the way he did.  He's a legit threat. LFG!
paddy the faddy!  He lookin thick :)
Love this dude. New favorite fighter.
Paddy the Fatty is my favorite version of him.  Rock on dude, you don't need to be fight weight all year round, just fight and win.
Wow! What a legend!!
I dont care how some people dislike how brash and in your face he can be, how can you not advocate for this man? I was gonna say he needs protecting at all costs. But does he fuck, he can protect himself just fine 🤣
My brother graduated from camp Pendleton and still one of the coolest ceremonies ive seen ill forever be grateful for our Marines and the sacrifices they make for our freedom 🫡
Paddy apologizing for being so fat to that guy who was carrying him was hilarious.
Paddy the fatty?
hell yeeeee
Love this fkn guy man
Was paďdy on the bulk or smthing?
Great fucking guy!
"Sorrrry I'm so fat" Had me dying 🤣  "I don't mind doing that" Yeah Paddy just casually taking on an entire group of marines. Fuck it, why not. comes to mind 😅
No one understood a thing he said.
I'd like to wrestle Paddy too 🔥
The soldier probably saw his life flashing before his eyes when Paddy started elbowing him on the floor in 2:32
This is who young men should be looking up to. Not that ignorant peanut head, Tate...
The Marines had socks on. Shoulda been the other way around.
Paddy’s a straight up wholesome person. I wish this guy nothing but the best!
Paddy's transformations are a separate art form!
Sorry watching this, thought this is Frederik "Der Neandertaler".
Well that grappling battle was really impressive
Falto la traducción del video Paddy Saludos.. No entendí nada pero igual te veo jaja
ngl its funny how adorable paddy looks despite being rlly dangerous
Now put paddy on the battlefield ...
Ufc fighters, navy seals, muay thai guys, bjj dorks, marines, it doesn't matter, they're all ego no humility
Paddy is so humble
Come try Army Airborne little man
Ses le drapeau des marsoc
He actually looks like a Chris griffin
"i dont think anyone can beat me idc" winner menatality
What a energy!☝️🙏
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
My favorite fighter, the only one I care about
Paddy Just a chill guy 🗿
Paddy apologizing for his weight is funny everytime 😂
Smashed it lad!!!!
Every dummy who is surprised, soldier train to shoot fighters train to fight. Even the most mid pro mma fighter you know of would beat the living shit out of any soldier of any kind and any country.
It’s almost as if MCMAP is bullshit and is useless on the streets.
paddy in his walking-around weight is like looking at an impostor
this dude transforms from fat to skinny, bro is literally christian bale
Impresionante lo que hizo, este chico es " IMPARABLE'
7:15 you can tell bro ain’t want to lose and look like the baddest going woo after getting tapped 😂😂😂 typical military guy thinking he above evruoneb
I have been a fan since day one.
huge video, definitely breaking down the typical tropes, well done.
He’s just with the middle fingers😂😂😂😂
Theres no way any marine was going to remember hiw to make Paddy tap😢
Cute Paddy apologizing to the soldier for his weight when the soldier was carrying him😊
No me abria podido imaginar a Paddy con ese peso, wowwww el recorte de peso que hacen para entrar al cuadrilatero es brutal, cuanto baja 10 kilos? en la proparación de una pelea... es impresionante.
Hoorah
Ive got the balance of a ballerina and the weight of a fucking sumo wrestler is hilarious
Great phys session prior to ju jitsu set. Proper warm up, grappling is so important to learn. My training we got taught boxing, takewondo, and judo.
I love this kid.
The crazy part is you nowhere near your maximum cardio at 200 pounds. And you were still able to hold up through 10 marines. You are wild
1st time watching this guy and you are so down to earth and i think a genuine nice guy. 🤝
People who think he wont smash that ilya guy are funny
Legend!
A warrior. Respect what he said about mental health. True warrior.
the way he kept apologizing for being a lil chubby😭
Marine #9: “Stalemate?” 😭
Well done paddy. Im one of the old marines before all this soy boy shit the last few years. Keep up the good work
Marine came and rolled the other night for the first time.. proceeded to tell me how much harder it was than any military training he'd ever done and dude was gassed in minutes. Military doesn't make you badass, being badass does. Nuff said
Semoga bisa jadi juara di kelas ringan
Petarung sesungguhnya
Must of hurt the marines to lose ten against one
I got bullied all the way through school by a gang of boys, which gave me PTSD. I suffered from depression and anxiety, so to hear you talking about it so candidly is inspiring. Bullies don't realise what they can do to a person. I've carried it with me for 40 years.
Hard to understand scouse 😂
I'm Brazilian and I understand English easily, but listening to this guy speaking is bizarre to me 🤣
the bad man
This was awesome
paddy the baddy turned into paddy the fatty
I like The Paddy Lad Nice to see him enjoying himself From a fellow red , God Bless Ya Lad 👍
"Sorry Lad, im a fat bastard" LMAO that killed me
How could you not love Paddy? He’s such a great guy! D.R. 🇩🇴
That Marine that was 167 really doesnt know how to punch
lololol "im sorrys I'm so fat" lolol, 2 years later its still funny.
i bet that marine lady get's passed around
Wich fawk. Didn't take.
Can we have a live action Naruto movie with real ufc fighters and paddy be Naruto
Oh eff that im good. Let me eat philly cheastaeak until its time to drill spar., this is for camps and what nots i am goody cudie. Fight grtipo and strength is spiritual its at a diff level/
Broooo, I’m a casual but paddy fr puts on 64-45 pounds after fighting!!? I’m no smart ass but that don’t seem to healthy in the long run, I mean some people are just built differently?🤣🤷🏻‍♂️
Dostal bys facku a šel bys k zemi 😂 však máš 50 kg 😂
fucking legend
I absolutely love Paddy the Baddy. what a legend   karl in Derby
Paddy is the baddiest
The little sassy hand clap he did is sending me😂
Who’s here after UFC 314?
Stalemate, reset? No, just taking a breath. Tap!
One of the most amazing videos I have ever seen in my life, and I'm not joking. Bravo paddy and bravo Marines!!!
Such a likeable Lad! Great to see him working with the few... the proud....
Imagine Khabib doing this haha he would absolutely kill it and still have energy 😮
hevily overweight,after hard workout takes on 10  steroid dripped marines,u cant fake skill....u cant..
Attitude is everything. Powerful and real as it gets
10 US marines: 1 Paddy! And they lost!
Ever saw a marine in a canoe? Never! Why the training? Idiots!
Listen to the man!  Talk fellas.  Too many of us clam up.  Your voice is the key to true happiness.
The real joke is that there are subtitles for the american dudes but much more important would be the subtitles for Paddy's scouse accent ^_^
OK, I gotta get back to the gym now...
Paddy is a prick.
BADASS Paddy!
nice paddy gj
Paddy’s words about opening up to your lads is always so healing. He is in one of the most toxic businesses on the world and still tries to be kind to everyone including himself
Very humbling to see this young man be helpful….good job young man!!
Paddy is a fucking g😂 “gang of big bastards”
Thats badass boost of morale forsure
that´s why chandler couldnt have won, paddy fights marines, he gets in shape every tame he has to fight, he is a grat fighter
So amazing the dedication Paddy puts into his weight gain/Loss . Its so good for you , Your body adapts to it and when he fights he looks absolutely shredded , 8 pack and all. This method is the BEST for your body as far as going back and fourth . God Bless you Patrick !
Paddy is a Maschine 💪
I'd really like to meet Paddy and I'm 65, top bloke.
the goat
Went to one of the biggest pog units he could lol
I like your personality  I would like to be your student
what's music
Paddy is amazing. Some humble. what a great guy. my all-time favorite MMA fighter
Also, mad respect. Anyone else battling mental health issues knows how hard it is to put a smile on for people. this made did it and more.
"sorry I'm a fat bastard" I died LOL love you PB!
+2m fan gained
When I think I am good at English I listen to Paddy so I get humbled. I'm just a beginner and my learning process is still going on.
Paddy you are one of my favourite humans
my man said "stalemate?" when he was in a mounted triangle.. lol
Love how Paddy fully gets involved and connects with people. Great work everyone. 👏🏼👏🏼
Firemen carries were always funny.  Everyone is looking at that fat guy hoping the don't get picked to carry him 😂😂
As a former Marine that had a ‘black belt’ in marine corps martial arts program, and as an upper belt in BJJ, I can tell you, this is a walk in the park for any mid-level submission grappler. Marines are white belts in grappling.
Awesome Paddy!!!!!
triangle!! nice chokes and arm bars!! nice to see his opinion of dealing with adversity,  GET IT OFF YOUR CHEST, communicate with your people and get support
Damn, that's impressive
lunges, this is similar to football type workouts but more intense because of the striking.
Paddy if only you knew how much this helped me right now!  In a total moment of total  non self belief it would make you smile. Thanks mate fir being so true to yourself... I have always been a massive fan. Maybe one day i can thank you and tell you what you just did for me. Fuck yes!!!
People forget that MMA fighters, they train everyday. Marines, while hard, don't do it day in and day out, at least the fighting part. Still impressive af by Paddy!
Well Paddy Pimblett you deserve it 👏👏👏👏👏 and let's start the fight, raise your guard, I hope you win 💪🥊
With a proper poke in the eye, all his juu jitsu would go out the window. If it were a real combat fight.
You're a beast!
Paddy is a breath of fresh air in a stale time. I have longed for another Frank shamrock type fighter,one that actually uses everything they've got. I hope he rises like cream to the top. He's a great lad. A brilliant ambassador for England.
camera man sucks.......make my head dizzy.
Patty not knowing how to receive a challenge coin. Triggered me so bad
Some of those marines are instructors too. And he made them look like amateurs. I understand the marines don’t focus their entire life on this craft like paddy does. But martial arts training is very important to marines career development.. but it is interesting to see the difference between a professional athlete in the sport of MMA compared to marines. There’s probably not anyone in the marines who could beat him.
Sorry I’m a fat bastard lad
That one dude said stalemate like he wasn’t in a full mounted triangle 😂
I don't understand what he says. Awful  accent.
That's one bad mf. Hell yeah this was sick
Semper fi paddy
I like Paddy
Bro casually hand combat marines on a daily crazy
best athletes are always in shape, paddy is a fatty lol
Paddy is a gd legend. Awesome video. The rines are tough, but Paddy is one of the very best in the world
This is the equivalent of when GSP brought the foreign out of shape fighter in to coach, who then proceeded to whoop everyone 😂
An off-season out of shape, Patty making Marines look like a joke.😂
Just gained a brick 🧱 load of respect from me 🫡
Submitting 10 marines one after the other is wild. Dude is strong af
WOW, what Paddy and the Folk here showed each other was amazing. Got to love Paddy's attitude to life AND to opponents without a doubt. Thanks for this great video and well done to all who took part and a great fighting future to all!
the foot odour in that room must have been vile.
Music just isn't it, mate; it's trash.
On 4 hours of sleep is crazy. That's the strength behind training and discipline 💪
Thumbnail look like paddy is a veteran on the spectrum
"Sorry, I'm a fat bastad" 😂
Yeah Francis would run over Paddy but it’s important for a figther to think you can beat everyone 😂
Just imagine if it was Khabib 😁
paddy
ilia tupuria te va patear el culo
bro apologizing for being fat is killing me 😆
Just found this, loved it. Love Paddy's fights, great character.
The partner was gold😂
Damn. That's y don't compare a soldier with a fighter. Fighter are trained to use their body as a weapon to put someone to sleep
Would be amazing if they all showed up to a ufc event when paddy is fighting for the belt! That will defiantly happen soon, he’s gonna win ufc 314 and then get a title shot I hope. We all love paddy
Nasty
Paddys not a small dude.
they dont have a clue what your saying la! 🤣🤣 boss vid tho
Paddy is underrated. Cool vid with some badass Marines. Resoect. Keep it standing, Mike!😂
Brilliant video, loved this
Well done paddy submitting all these c.lowns 😂😂😂
Questions and Answers was/is mint. Top Man Patrick, ✌️❤️. Still under The Firmament. the ionosphere 🤣
Topuria gonna k.o you paddy😂
Scouse Power!
Paddy is a fun guy...😊
Respect Paddy such a great lad! What's that tune at 5.50 minutes?
“This has been one of my hardest workouts this week” is so funny to me🤣🤣
Paddy 200 Ibs?
Send them 2-3 years to Dagestan and forget.
The U S military should definitely hire these elite MMA fighters to train our troops. In hand to hand combat
The marine who gave him the challenge coin was my kill hat 😂
2:43 She just proved in less then 30 seconds why ladies DON'T belong on the frontlines.
Dude Paddys just bob from tekken in real life NO JOKE
gonna stick around, didnt know paddy had his own youtube channel. good finds.
It was a com battalion. There is a difference between grunts and pogs flying the alpha raiders flag. Of course he destroyed some comm bubbas.😅
Paddy fat face the buddy!! 😂 😂❤
paddy repping Britain cool episode
paddy repping Britain cool episode
I wonder if he should have brought a translator 😂
Paddy the fatty knows how to do his thing for sure!
Just goes to show American military isn’t as dangerous as once revered.
Awesome Paddy , Belts Coming for sure 😊 Epitomizes Gentleman
Savage
Haha broke their ego’s
You can see paddy has the fighter mind. My boxer husband has it too. It’s this weird, never give up, refuse to be beaten energy. You see it in his eyes. When old mate said ‘stalemate’ he laughed but you saw it, his mind told him to get fkd lol - thats what his eyes said. He said ‘I believe I can beat anyone’. They genuinely believe it. Not because theyre big headed, they just believe they will work harder, go further, do more. I WISH I had just a pinch of this in me.
I love Paddy. Hes a great guy! Keep it up my brother!
God I just love Paddy. Massive love from Ireland. What a well rounded legend.
The horrible (c)rap music... ugh.
You realize all this shit is staged right
Paddy is a BEAST
They probably dodnt understand him haha
What did he say😂
basically dagestan with bjj
Lol and this guy think he can beat ILIA TOPURIA😂😂😂
Paddy the gay <3
He's trying to be the next Butterbean.  We'll see how quickly he retires from eating all that garbage all the time.  Mark my words.  Garbage in, garbage out.
Sas 1 delta force 0 well done paddy
The amount of times apologized for being fat is priceless.  Lol
“It’s going to get worse” lmao if you’ve been in the military, you know that line.   Hahahaha paddy’s a quarter marine after being told that 😂😂😂
I like the fatty Paddy. He is badass dude!
I'm British, but the fact he looks like Owen Hart and quoted Bret Hart ❤ it
Absolutely brilliant what a terrific bunch of guys. I cannot praise Paddy enough. He's a great honest guy not to mention a fantastic fighter. 👍
Paddy b1stard00 si quieres ser un YouTuber presenta a todos los marines haz bien tu pt0 trabajo
He is an example of the yo-yo effect.
Cool shit! Loved it!
"stalemate" while stuck in a mounted triangle lolol
usmc is an overrated military force. BTW terrible camera work
Paddy is sweet❤
Great video. :)
5:45 Sean Strickland's wet dreams
So why is this woman in the marines if she can't carry a man yet she expects to be carried by a man yeah the genders just aren't equal
He really put on the pounds huh?
GAAAAAAYYYYYY!
Being real like that aínt easy. Props for that. You just got yourself a new subscriber. 👏👏👏
Paddy is hilarious tell another guy I'm so sorry I'm fat😂😂
2:48 she is begging 😂
Marines think yelling is going to scare him.  Dude is 200x more savage than any of them put together and he’s not even trying
6:11 was this the instructor?
3:58 insnane, even more the marine admits he's pushing to the point of almost puking 😂 classic, good on ya paddy and all respect and thanks to the company
Looks like there was a great craic between Paddy and the marines. A mutual respect and pushed one another hard.  Great work!
What a bloke Paddy is. Massive respect for his fighting ability, integrity and honesty. Top marks, Pad!
Don’t go to Disney if you want a challenge….island
I really,really love what this lad is about. He is so likeable,honest,down to earth and just an all round lovely fella. Well done Paddy-you’ve got a new fan here…as well as all those Marines 👊🏻👊🏻👊🏻
Banger
7:32 what is that called?
jiu jitsu is such a fascinating craft... I've only been in for a few months, and watching my instructor and the experienced guys move on the mat is something else. I remember when we were taught breathing control whilst on top, a simple change to raised toes makes you so much more heavier, and timing your breathing with your opponents and taking their breathing capacity with your weight.. crazy!! It really is chess with human bodies
The American enthusiasm is lost on us brits XD
"Stalemate?" lol That guy is out of order.
I love the Baddy because he has perfect manner, Hey Paddy who ever raised you to be this way deserves their flowers🙏🏻 Conner who when it comes to paddy the baddy💪🏼
“Sorry ima fat bastard” 😂😂😂
Knock
Grow up good opposition for Islam.... good job
The marines did better than I thought they would. Marines are not trained fighters, they are trained athletic shooters. America needs to stop thinking that soldiers are these god-like beings who are "defending your country"....... its kinda cringy and shows that the brainwashing of the "pledge of allegiance" is still strong in the minds of Americans.
*This dude is so humble its ridiculous that he's also one of the best fighters in the UFC, so many have out of control egos, McGregor, Jones & the like but Paddy just seems like a down to earth guy.*
Paddy may aswell just join the SAS lol
What a great Lad.
yeah they teach marines to dry hump so when they get captured they are not  surprised .
Mental health...well.done and good message.
dln t even have to watch this to say our military is weak AS FUCK
Honestly feels like those old warrior philosopher tales. Great stuff.
A great human
I always thought fatbaster was scottish.     …….I had to rewrite this cause utube censored it the first time
So basically Paddy just proved the American Marines are all Pussies.😂
Brilliant
He’s like a snake or something once he get a hold of ya your done
Thank you for taking your time to spend with my fellow Veterans. Your a good man.
God bless our Marines
Some have passion more then genetic skill😢😂
Paddy sounds like a cool dude. I heard he hates bullies and will always call them out.   A marine buddy once told me a motto his group always followed.   The first responsibility of the strong is too protect the week.   Love it.   Okay, I have to admit, when I first watched the video I thought it was Lewis Capaldi fighting some marines.   Hooray!!
You should try SF, they're generally trained in foreign language.  Native English speaker here and I don't recall ever understanding anything Paddy ever said.
McGregor would never
As usual the comments become combative about standards of various units etc. missing the point completely. The US Marines are good soldiers and it was tremendously respectful of them to Invite Paddy to train with them on their turf. It was clearly a mutually beneficial session that they all remember. Nothing but a positive interaction for all.  No hate needed here
Vaya cara pan que tienes 😂😂😂
Paddy apologized for being fat but nobody out of shape could have kept up with those guys!!!!!!😂
that's a bad triangle in the thumbnail, hips not engaged, guy on top is just going to stack him onto his neck and fold him over. Now he is going to give up his back or side control.
I like how the guy was like “stalemate” an paddy was just like “nah, just enjoying the view”
I think the issue is that the marines can't strike, otherwise paddy would be done
yooo 5:48 what is that tune?
Now send him to a grunt unit.
With Jesus Christ there is no depression 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻 9:23
Ngl i bet i could beat him in this gauntlet
Paddy has to say sorry for his corpulence T^T
Love this guy.
When paddy’s not fighting his name is paddy the fatty when he is fighting it’s paddy the baddy
Guy is a savage !
0:02 is PEAK Marines.....
good man   Jim
bro thought it was a stalemate when paddy was just resting
He likes to much meth thats what broke him down
Paddy doesn't look or sound like the shit, until it's too late 😂! Love watching you Patrick in or out of the cage, always great.
just a great bloke this Paddy
nice
If you're quick and they don't expect it, you can do damage but how many opportunities were hands free for a knife, smashing some balls in, etc. with no rules, I wonder how effective it is. Still, good to have more tools.
As a retired soldier and combatives instructor, I LOVE this shit. (1) to demonstrate to all my cocky boots that pretend they are a warfighter because they survived basic, and (2) because as a true practitioner (BJJ or otherwise) there is such a high level of discipline, mutual respect, and appreciation for the sport. Being beaten on the mat by somebody with a good heart is FUN, because the experience is all about learning.   Much love <3
Any time you earn the respect of a room full of Marines, you've had a good day.
Oh, Look.... They came up with something worse than swim qual.
The Marines were like: "This dude is killing us. Also, what the eff is he saying?"
Je pense que c’est chic type. Je peux bien sûr  me tromper
A Father!! A Teacher!! A Warrior!!! - Thats Paddy!
Anytime paddy boy!
Thats not even paddy pimblett no one can go up and down weight that fast that's paddy's brother
That's what they said
Paddy. Thee. Baad AzZz😂❤😂
You have to love this lad!
Very cool. Iron sharpens iron. Paddy is a good dude for this. The USMC speaks for itself. The respect these men showed was amazing.  Respect Paddy for that.
"Stalemate?" My legs around your neck, vs your hands around my one wrist....  The pause to rolling him out into the arm bar, intentional or not, was great comedic timing haha
bro flick off to much send him back to the UK
such a beast big respect lad we love you here
I am impressed 😊
7:18 pause bro wyd
Paddy is real man, hes all about mental health and stopping the bad mansculinity. Hes a family father and seems to be a very very nice person all over. He loves food and dosent shy away from it. I find him a roll model for they younger gen.
paddy is toooooo funny i can’t i love this man so much hahaha
Paddy, you're awesome!  I'm glad I found your channel!
Paddy’s punching party threw the left with zest
I would really like to see more squeezing in grappling. When I was 15 at like 160lb my father challenged me to squeeze him in a simple hug pretty much (he's an old fighter at 255lb at that time, yes he was fat) and I broke a few of his ribs. As a grown man I could without a doubt break someones ribs by squeezing them. So why is it not used? just wrapping your arms anywhere around someones ribs (could use your legs as well) and just crush. It's a fight ender straight up, 4 to 6 broken ribs is bad, and if you continue to squeeze everything behind them will get effed up too. It should be a submission and practised, I do it whenever I have the chance when I roll. people tap, and quickly at that (of course if they don't tap I don't actually squeeze until they break, but instead say "I'm at 65% don't overestimate your ribs" and increase pressure further in a slow manner.
OOSH
Respect ✊
Well done Paddy 👍❤John 3,16 ❤
crazy
"Sorry lad, I'm a fat bastard" Im cracking up XD
Is it a workout if you don't throw a couple middle fingers to someone?
This guy is the real freaking deal!!!! Amazing performance. And super humble
sorry lad im a fat barstad 😂
i wanna see this re done w him in peak shape to see the difference
"sorry im so fat" 😂😂
That marine paddy is talking to was my drill instructor when I went thru boot a year and a half ago
This video is honestly all I needed to start working on my mental health, grappling has honestly been so magical
3:00 imagine being in the battlefield carrying Patty on your back and hearing "Soreh am so fat, man" I would drop him laughing and get us both killed😂
"I have tapped out 10 marines in a row" is such a heavy bar.
that was the most painfull crawl ive ever seen'
too much camera movement
I see a raider flag. Are these MARSOC guys?
TO BE FAIR,      This is all paddy does, VS the marines they have to know hand to hand combat, marksmenship, basic first aid,  land navigation,  how to use operate and work equipment for war,  potentially another language, how to survive if separated, and MANY, MANY MORE CRUCIAL SKILLS for them to be the MARINES.   I'm not downplaying either but when it comes to this you got to remember, how much knolebe is being retained in the amount of time given. Paddy is ALL phyiscal and the Marines are TRAINED TO SURVIVE IN MONTHS.
Baddest young dude out there your my hero paddy
give 3% of that cardio.... please.... Crazy. Maybe replace de DEI by the UFC ?
I'm a late subscriber. I only recently watched "Paddy and Molly Show No Mercy" and it was the 1st time have watched you. Loved that series and I hope you do more. Now I have a lot of catching up to do with seeing you on u.t . Your personality shines and you remind me of John Lennon with your attitude and humour. I can imagine you both being great friends had you met. Wishing you well and Molly too, and your wife & the twins.  I'm Jim from Blackpool, I'm in my 60's and you have a new fan....Better late than never eh ?
Great video. Paddy is a bear.
Paddy out here cheating without combat boots!
Let’s not pretend this is the first time Paddy has had this many marines on his back and in between his legs.   😂😂😂
Bro, you are the absolute best for doing this. We can't even get our own athletes to train with our military. You just gained yourself a lifelong fan. Great job and keep calling idiots "sausages" it is the funniest thing on the internet.
Great video
Hello Patty you are one bad ass son of a bitch we’ve been those Marines up in the wrestling match congratulations you know your shit keep up the hard work mentally physically spiritually
Big respect to you and to the marines Paddy👍 great vid
🤙🫂
NO greater endorsement that the Marines allow him to post all this video.  It means they view it as in alignment with their core values.  It means they agree with how this activity represents them (IMHO).  massive kudos.
"The marines" you forgot your own country has Marines?
It was great until the background noise started. Damn.
Paddy is the prove that funny lad could be so dangerous 😂. Please continue your Youtube channel with a next great content, Paddy! 🔥 Salam dari Indonesia
shit bud you might be part canadian with how much you said sorry through out the video
Department of the United States Navy.  United States Marine Core. Fly Navy,
Damn he spit the Bret Hart slogan!
"One mind.  Any weapon"    Since you are not allowed to have your own mind in Military service,  Who's mind are they following?
Paddy is going to be the next Gracie.
Better to do all that w.o the socks soldiers
Imagine doing grappling with Dagestani😂
They probably couldn’t understand a single word he said
He's a good Lad!
What bs typical YouTube video for the so called star. I doubt the marines do nt know anything about bjj 😂😂😂also a gun stops any mma fighter😂😂😂can't stand YouTube B.S. watch sit coms from ths 70 80's alot better 😂😂
3:40 Crazy how different music makes something look 😂😂😂
The whole unit got choked out 😭🤣
Yep Pappy he's what a champion is.
Damn, 10 in a row…that’s a beast. Bet he will be feeling that tomorrow.
Interesting.  He is a full blood pro.  And everyone of the marines is a real test to him and everyone had a plan.  That showes how dangerous these dudes are...
Paddy macht sie alle platt😊
I miss the baddy podcast pad when are we getting a new one?
Wish i could upvote this more than once!  💙💙 Fuckin' BADDY!
Still rolled them all. That's called recovery time.
1:22🤣
his engish is a test of my proficieny
Love it! Paddy is awesome, get back in shape brother man!
As much as I love our Marines and our soldiers, all of them from every branch of the military. I think this just showed the world the difference between an MMA fighter and a tough. Very tough man. Just like these Marines, but there's a difference between being tough and having mixed martial arts training and it shows in this video. Oh and I bet half of these Marines couldn't understand a thing he was saying😂
I wanted to be a Marine when I was young. Now I know what I know and I'll never fight for Israel
How tf I was not subscribed to Baddy?! Shame on me.
Knowledge is key here, Paddy knows every single move. It doesn't matter how big you are, if you offer up your arm, its going into a lock. Paddy's experience is top rate, retained and utilised to devastating effect.
Go paddy ❤👍🏻🇬🇧😂
dam tho he gets so fat between fights
This is amazing!
The English accent from Liverpool is my favourite :) "...tight to his bahh..." :)
An actual full Marine has his full kit. These are partial Marines. Not impressive at all. Click bait sadness.
I never knew what a real one Paddy was until this. Just a humble badass living best life and telling Marines it's ok to ask for help ..wow
5:38 the fights begin
Great video 😊
Absolute class act on the the US Marines and Paddy the Baddy. Afterwards just sitting and shooting.  the shit with the boys... so cool. Respect
So, I used to compete in marital arts right, and I had an opponent that reminded me of paddy but much younger (20 at the time).  As we started the match, he smiled at me excitingly and said very nicely "were going to have so much fun punching each other!"  Thats when I knew, I had fucked up.  Nice guys are dumb strong...
cant understand australian
very few people do what you did, meeting and sharing common stuff with military folks.  as a retired guy, i appreciate that you are involved. Keep going, and stay with them all...keep filling your heart and soul with what we are and do.
it would be nice to see him in Brazil
Why am I only just seeing this?  Great content Paddy! The honesty about depression hit me hard!  Respect dude.
Pretty sad marines are beaten byna wrestler! I thought they were all suoer heroes
Paddy the BADDY
A wise man once said, "A Marine would probably lose in a fight, Marines don't fight, they kill."
This was sick. What ever they said lool. Smashed it paddy did fair play
Paddy i see you and it s like to see owen hart.  You are so similar. It s  uncanny
I think paddy may have a new found respect  for the toughest men in the world.
👏❤️🇺🇸🇬🇧
If you want to be the best, you're going to have to fight people that are bigger than you
Paddy your of the most realist people in the UFC top marks mate
These Marines will remember this. I give the so much props for trying to get him to Submit, and mad props to Paddy. His endurance is off the charts.
The soldiers can't compete with Peddy. He's been a fighter since he was a child and fights against top people from all over the world. No soldier can do anything against Justin Gaethje or Conor Mc Gregor with his bare hands.
Absolutely love anything that Paddy or Molly on TV, please keep it coming ,
Paddy deffo has ADHD , functioning that well on 4 hours sleep, absolute machine .paddy your amazing love watching any of your shows and Molly meatball
Paddy, you should have come to A 1/10 in Lejeune in 1976. The score would have been Paddy-0  Marines-10. Love your fights!!
Love paddy. Weird guy kinda nerdy....but most times just himself. N dana didnt thing he could be a star. Ur wrong dana. This is one of the best kids u have...he just doesnt have the flash bc its not in his personality to be flashy. I have to respect any man that stays true to himself
Can someone with actual BJJ knowledge explain how the Von Flue at 7:34 works? I thought you could only get it if your opponents arm is over your head like a Guillotine. What's realistically stopping the marine from collecting the foot for half guard with all that space Paddy is allowing at the hips? I feel like I am missing something here.
Smiled the entire length of this video.
Are those marines from the infantry or POG's? Paddy looks like he outweighed them all.
America has the softest military!
I don't care about UFC but this Paddy is just awsome.
How can you not like Paddy?
This is just tops, trains, then takes on 10 one after the other ! Enough respect! I have suffered with my mental health and this just so great to see just a normal chap showing how great he really is. 👍
Paddy beats 10 marines in a row and proves that our tax dollars are being wasted.
Crazy how he looked only a year ago vs now with weight cut.
Paddy is in his Chris Griffin mode
This is awesome and so inspiring! Thank you Paddy the badass and the United States Marine Corps!!!
russia had khabib khamzat and islam....us army has paddy the baddy and im all for it
This hits hard literally
Living legend at 29 years young. Future champion and all-time great.
Just subbed . As a former marine platoon 3003 1980, Loved this vid! Thank you for rollin with the marines. You honor us thanks paddy!
He’s one of the people that got me into mma
This is well cool. Big up the US military wanting you over there that's crazy.
nothing like a mounted triangle stalemate
Love you brother patty
...ye greet fawtbawsturd ye...
Paddy  You’re a beast 🫡
He’s an admirable man.
That female marine was kinda hot
now give em guns
Hey paddy no idk if you'll see this, but you deserve your successes. Love your attitude and your badassatude.
Doing everything he can to train different from everyone else but if you went to Pais island you would have put through the wringer Hollywood marines are nothing compared to the boys on the island
Paddy, this  Irish Mexican loves you down here in Albuquerque New Mexico keep up the good work brother🎉❤
Shit Kickers FOREVER! Semper--Fi to USMC,Salute!Only 2 people in the World EVER made the choice to DIE for Strangers to SAVE them....JESUS CHRIST and the AMERICAN SOLDIER!,...Thank THEM for YOUR Freedom.
usmc seem proper cool guys
Paddy making Royce proud.
I love that this is paddy slightly heavy too. Clearly not ufc condition but honestly probably more comfortable for him. Hes well fed and energized 😂
Paddy is likeable and pretty hilarious
That unit patch is the raiders. These guys aren't just Marines, they're fucking Raiders.
I'm a Scouser and even I struggle to understand Paddy 😂
Love you Lad! Gratz on the win!
love this paddy!
Mans that was Paddy's drill partner is a B3AST🙏🏾
"I can always grapple" YESSIR🚀🚀
So paddy could fight at light heavyweight then,or middleweight 🤔
seems like paddy should join the marine core......lol
take away the rules and lets see how bad he is....  lol. marines arent trained to bar fight.  theyre trained to take you out. youve taken all their kill moves away.  Goodbye kamala.
Jesus Christ loves you, give your worries and burdens to Jesus. Trust in Gods perfect plan for you, everything will workout with God. Don’t worry.
Paddy is a beast tapped 10 marines in a row🎉
He was taking it easy too.
The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9) And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent: (Acts 17:30) Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. (Acts 20:21)
Advise on 100. Men, were taught to be tough and rugged all the time. Sometimes getting off ya chest is the answer. It doesn't change the fact that your a badass, it just makes your mind stronger by not holding it in and hiding it. Peace God.
This is a top video, really puts into perspective of just how good a pro MMA UFC fighter is. Also shows how good the champions of the divions must be!
I still only understand about 86% of the words, but I always get the point.
He kept it as Clean to not hurt abs anoyone. showed respect. This is an abs. master class in just being a good person.
it must have been humiliating to the marines to feel what a real fighter can do to them, they are used to harras regular ppl XD
Does anybody really understand what he just said?
I have only seen small clips of paddy and those dident make him look good. But this changed my perspectiv. Sorry for judging you. This was so good and what a spirit. If i had a hat i would take it off.
Very cool that Paddy went to Pendleton. Did all the Marines tell you their favorite flavor of crayon? Just kidding. Cool to work out with a UFC fighter.
I knew a guy who was a Marine. Is a Marine? Whatever. Tall, skinny, lanky dude. Anyway he used to always brag about how he had some high belt in the Marines martial arts program and could easily whoop anyone. Then we all went to a cookout and he started fighting with his little cuz. He clearly had no clue what he was doing and was getting tossed around by somebody much younger than him. When I was in the Army they made us take “combatives” classes for basic training. We learned how to sprawl, how to shrimp, how to pull guard, how to rear naked choke and how to arm bar. That’s it. IMO anybody who says they can fight just because they were in the military is full of shit unless they got trained in the more advanced combatives classes regularly. A hobbyist BJJ practitioner could submit a soldier or marine who has done just the basic classes.
Now there’s a series: Paddy takes on the Forces (Navy, Airforce, Army, Space Force, Coastguard ) 🫡🇺🇸
What a fuckin bunch of good lads
Come train our kids at UWM (Madison, Wisconsin) Badger football and wrestling teams... they train focused and study but could use some help with your wonderful and different instructions. Please. University Wisconsin Madison, Badgers, Madison, WI, USA. Best to you sir. Steven W.
Good ol' 9th Crime hahaha been a minute....
I sweat like a.waterfall I know the feeling
you're so loveable Pat!  YNWA
Paddy the fatty , kicks some marine butts
lol he said he could beat Francis Ngannou if anyone was wondering the subtitles couldn't handle it.
There is a stark contrast between being trim and being conditioned. If you're conditioned and capable, you won't care what your body composition is. It just makes sense.
We need paddy vs SAS.
He's right, it does make a good video. LOL
these are all marsoc guys right, judging by the flags?
Paddy and Tom Aspinall are two of the most down to earth fighters I've ever seen. Type of guys you could just have a regular chat with.
I was a black belt instructor in the Marine Corps martial arts program, just like many of these Marines are. Just keep in mind, that's equivalent to a 1 stripe white belt in jiu-jitsu (maybe). Paddy is a black belt...that's probably 8-10 years of grappling experience vs the Marines who train very seldomly. And even me training for about a year in jiu-jitsu, blue belts can just play around with me, I have no chance.
I've developed a newfound respect for Paddy Pimblett. Taking the time to train with U.S Marines in such a humble fashion commands appreciation at the highest levels.
Enjoy it Kids
3:00  -  Imagine a war-torn battleground, and Paddy’s being medivac’d on his brother’s shoulder, wounded & bleeding, with this EXACT dialogue. 🤣😅
Still hate your own country paddy
I still believe in this guy all the hate aside I believe he’s gonna be one of the greats !!
😊😊😊
Pretty sick
I’m not a fan of Paddy but after watching this video I respect this mf. Good Shit
I find it difficult to be impressed by a guy who has studied extensively in grappling beating guys who haven't.
You definitely took them all at once. One by one.
Bro was DRENCHED with sweat
Paddy is the man
What a lad Paddy!
Seeing paddy putting in that work bro damn! Monster
The way Paddy pronounces breakfast makes me so hungry for a Full English.
Why did Paddy get so fat?
This was dope. Paddy has a great message.
Dude looks so fucking much like Owen Hart to me it's insane
What do you think of the visuals?
Thank you for spending some time with our boys!
Surprising how these americans are understanding this scouser.
Paddy and the Marines > Tony Ferguson and David Goggins
What language is he speaking?
A white fighter that never won the ufc belt look at all the hype he gets
Am I wrong but Paddy isn’t known for being a grappler right?  I thought he was better at striking. 🤷‍♂️  A very likable guy.  🤙🤙
Paddy like a todler that just learned the bird
Scouser
Top bloke
How much do you hope he makes it, beat Bobby Brown, then the top ten fella. Then the world is your oyster. What a sound fella. Molly too. Regardless of the talent and hard work, some people just deserve it.
Sounds like German platt but in English
Good on ya Paddy. What a great thing you did here. Great to see the Marines doing what they do best and talking with you. Very cool.
Now go do the same with the RM commandos.
Dude I love your video but let's be honest I'm European and I can't understand you without English subtitle
not me son......... i am a real USMC
Paddy vs. Marines ain't fair, our Marines are meant to kill with weapons and tools, Paddy is a baddy when it comes to hand-to-hand, so I can see how he wins each time.
This is a real guy down to earth. Great guy for mental health
No socks on the mat boys 🥋
No.
10:48 patty doesnt understand that the elite pass special things to one another with a firm drug deal hand shake as well. lol
paddy apologizing for being fat to every guy carrying him is mad funny
Durrr durrr sean Strickland said he could waste some seals. Let's all get fucking upset about it. -former usmc
LoL imagine these guys who are supposed to be killers tapping out on the battlefield.
It's so crazy how bloated he gets between fights. When he took his shirt off he didn't even look that fat, just bloated. It's like 90% of his fat goes to his face!
What we learned here is the USMC needs to work on hand to hand combat lol
fair play
Marine 10 in the Paddy vs. Marines is SSgt. Nater and was my drill instructor. Wow
NO FUCKING WAY sean strickland was right xDDDDDDDDDDDD marines just train for war not fighting any ufc fighter can take on any seal or marine
Fucking love Paddys sense of humor and down to earth vibes!
Only now seeing this, 10 marines is insane paddy you absolute animal quality stuff
Just came from watching that sean strickland video. Somebody tag that marine
Communications btn hq? Give me a fucking break
sorry lad ima fat bastad.     got me
Talking does make you feel better but I reckon ten marines tapping against you, after an excruciating workout, clears that 😂
CHUBBY FACE ON DA SCOUSSER
nice one
Oh man if Paddy was an actual boot he would of got destroyed by down those kayaks like "banana with hands" if I recall correctly  Oh and should of made him toss on some boots. That's what really kills ya  Amazing job paddie
Top class fighter wrestling with top class warriors. Coolest shit I've seen for a while.
i found this video super entertainment and awesome sauce
Paddy is a Joke in the UFC, the Marines are worst🤢
He needs to make these episodes longer
He had that look: "wheres the nacho bar?"
This is a joke, just because they are Marines doesn't mean that they are automatically good fighters. Some have never been in a fight before.  He should head to the MACE in Quantico, VA to have a better challenge.
I don’t understand a word
200lb Paddy is terrifying
Where are the subtitles for this video?
If it was a life or death situation there wouldnt be much grappling.
The Austin Powers of the UFC. He's awesome.
Great video! And probably a great time for you and the marines!
I love this dude !
The only time I saw the woman train in the video was when she was used as a deadweight. Why wasn't she rolling with Paddy?
Nothing says "out of control ego" quite like a newly minted guy in the military let alone the Marines. I played D1 football back in the day. B10 and a skilled position. Yet every guy you ever meet who was active military would act like we were athletic peers. Let alone some actually thought they were superior. Note to self for guys in the military: you're "in shape" but that doesn't make you an athlete, which means you're great if you're going against an average guy, but you're toast if you're going against a high end athlete.
Most if not all those Marines were in better shape than Paddy at that time.  But when it came to the technical aspect of BJJ, he showed the separation between someone who is just learning versus a top level practitioner and pro fighter (Paddy is actually a 2nd degree bjj black belt).  Hence the tap out of 10 consecutive marines.
The First! Picture Looks Like peddy thug Them.
The First! Picture Looks Like peddy thug Them.
HOOYAH! ETCS SS/SW USN Ret.
im your biggest fan paddy❤
i would love to roll with Paddy one time, the amount of knowledge & fun would be so dope! Love you Paddy
Ahahahaha he would destroy them like dolls in a real fight😂
This is so very impressive, a one man army !!
One of them was my drill instructor
Who TF don't love Paddy?! And of course the Corps?! Semper Fi!
He is a good lad.
That’s no fair they only know McSlap
Paddy we love you lad
These marines needed this lesson. Very undertrained, in skills of fighting. But Maybe this created a shift in their thinking.. The Marines are tough guys, But need to spend much more time on fighting skills.
I love that one of them tried to say "stale mate" when hes in a triangle on his back lol.
Paddy you are truly an inspiration to so many young men I wish you all the success in the ufc and hopefully we can see gold rapped around your waist one day
Paddy the Baddy!!!! taking on ten opponents in a row is not easy, neither is being true and honest in all aspects of your life.
Paddy's obviously very humble. He's a trained killer.
I bet paddy could beat Jake and Logan Paul at the same time it
Total Viking. Respect 💪🏽
He looks like Boris Johnson's love child.
why does he keep flipping the bird...idiot
Love paddy, he’s definitely someone I look up to 😮‍💨👌
THAT MAIT IS FUCKING GUNNY FLAMING!!!! THAT WAS MY MAIT WTF!😂😂
I’m sorry I’m so fat it’s hilarious to see him keep saying
Nothing against this guy, he seems like a real one and an amazing athlete, but, he’s training to fight while they’re training to kill. These guys didn’t want to hurt him, so fell into his game I’m betting. Change it to anything goes (minus extra hands) and the counter would probably be different But it is the “new military” so maybe I’m wrong. IDK 🤷🏽‍♂️ (nothing against the new peeps, just a lot of hearsay about lax standards)
I don't think people realize how stone cold it is from Paddy to just wrestle and absolutely own a room full of fucking marines one after the other it didn't even look hard wild stuff
That was awesome
Little disappointed in his answer as to why he wanted to train with them lol I thought he was gonna show some respect, unless they cut it
What are the exercises they are doing in order called
"your gonna make me throw up i haven't pushed this hard in a while." is a wild statement for carrying him💀
Dude submitted several marines who were bigger than him. Literal trained killers...and bradley martin thinks he has a chance lol.
That #8 tap thought about not tapping but good thing he did or he was out 3 ways from Sunday. That was locked in anaconda tight
That SNCO’s room temp iq is perfect lol
What happens when you carry the beauty  female Marine,  and you .."print"  ? shorts and trousers are thin
To those who came to say derogatory remarks about Marines MCMAP training please keep in mind that this a produced piece.  These Marine NCO's were most likely told by their command to NOT hurt a celebrity UFC fighter.  Those guys were hand picked by the brass to be a part of this vlog.  You don't have crazy Lisowski out here trying to rip the blokes head off just because Fitz said he couldn't.  Those Marines are at work.
context:  🖕
"now im gonna get f*cked up by some marine c*nts" 😂
Proof the Marines are pussys, 10 Marines tapping out rather than fighting on...
PS:  any word on when you're gonna stomp out Topuria????  I can't wait!  You got this Paddy!  👊🏻😈
I served at Camp Pendleton in 2004 and we used to do this same training 🤘🏻🤠.  So awesome to see you teaching fellow Marines techniques that will help them in hand to hand combat.  So awesome!  Semper Fidelis Marines!
Fake, engineered, cut many times...yawn...
Goes to show how dangerous trained fighters are. An out of fight camp mma fighter putting down 10 marines in a row is mental fair fucking play
Those were all sergeants… get ready recruits.
The Scouse boys have mastered masculine positivity. We need more of this attitude in the US.
1 mistake all the soldiers wear soks on vs paddy
Damn british lads
Great video paddy love from Liverpool 👍🏾✊🏾
What they said😂👍
your a badass for sure. but all the close combat training is worked around their armor. not taking shots, but if you wrestled marines wearing gear it would be  awesome.
His face bot thin by the end of fight lol
The marines were holding back
*chuckles*
Great video brother! Wish you and yours all the best in the future 👌
Thinking Marines are going to be professional MMA fighters is like expecting a professional MMA fighter to successfully go into a war and do well. The r like expecting a pro football player to be great at golf. Not impressed.
“This has been one of the hardest workouts I’ve had this week” that’s crazy cray
Excellent video!!
Laid back so much, he's horizontal 👊🤟,,🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Online he is described as 5'10"" and 155 pounds.
I always thought Paddy was more lucky than skilled, proved me wrong. I would be in the hospital, just from the workout.
Stay Hard Paddy! OoRah!
Right now try it with proper Marines. Royal Marines.
live grappling with no rest in between sets while taking on fresh marines. i hope people who have absurd ideas that they can take on a ufc fighter understand their endurance and fighting skills are reasonably beyond reach
Not enough people are realizing that as far as hand to hand combat many branches of the military don’t prioritize it.
They have shit hand-to-hand combat skills but modern wars are decided by weapons.
I didn’t know you had a YouTube channel….also mad respect for doing the workout and not just going straight to MMA stuff, shows a lot of respect for the room (or at least it always did when I wrestled in school, was like a “this is my right of passage to be here with you in your wrestling room”
paddy is a joke
saying kilos to them xddd
Such a wholesome video. Thanks for sharing
You are awesome Paddy
Most people cannot fathom the separation of skill level between the average practicing martial artist and a professional.
Marines prolly could’ve got one submit if they didn’t have socks on
Fkin love this guy!
Fat paddy still being a better grappler than these jacked marines tells you why Bradley Martyn would EASILY get killed by nate diaz 😂
Paddy the knob.
El mejor de todos los tiempos.
Paddy dropping the example that "anyone can win, doesn't matter, I could start fighting with a 14 year old, get caught with a right hook, and get put fast asleep." is funny asf.
Welldone lad
Gotta remember he don’t get to see the big guns in the uk
Good guy paddy
Word of the day: I have the Balance of the ballerina and the weight of the fuckin sumo wrestler 😂😂
Gladiator vs Soldiers
PRAY THAT 21 SAVAGE AND J.I.D AND KANYE WEST AND JON JONES AND COLBY COVINGTON AND NEBALIY AND ALL OF THESE YOUTUBERS AND FAMOUS PEOPLE AND LIL NAS X AND SNEAKO AND ADIN ROSS AND PADDY PIMBLETT AND JETSON MADE AND JESSE JAMES WEST AND ALL OF THESE PEOPLE REPENT AND FOLLOW JESUS CHRIST.✝✝✝

Imagine what charles oliviera would do
Nah that marine at 3:40 was CAKED
Marines don't actually stop
For english , press 1 For learning to fight , press 2
9:19 sounded like some Asian language😭
I'd like to see paddy do this fit
Was that about 9000 lunges Paddy? 😂
Holy crap, if paddy can do that to all these marines, imagine what literally any other UFC fighter would do to them. 😶
Top man pimblett!   Fair play.  Great video buddy.   #neverbuythesun
Paddy the fatty is back!
As a marine instructor I would love to genuinely spar with this man. I might lose but it would be all in great spirits and anybody that enjoys martial arts should understand this.
Holy shit paddy, looks like that when hes not fighting 😳😳😳
Paddy was apparently a mere flash in the pan.
Those gifts were tacky asf lol paddy’s a beast tho fr
"Sorry I'm so fat"... I feel like I should apologize for this too LOL
Would be nice to actually see some rolls. With cuts every few seconds the whole thing feels like a trailer.
He's a great teacher, he doesnt just tell ya, he explains why.
Weak as fuck
Only people who aren’t actually fat can get away with apologizing for being fat.
He sounds like Paul O’Grady. But I’m not telling him.
Paddy is such a bad bitch omfggg
He didn't even do that great against them...considering he's a pro?
This is so dumb?? Marines arent trained in grappling? Or wrestling? We were trained in some basic hand to hand combat. But nothing to help defeat a professional ??? Marines aren't tough.. Of course some are. And they can fuck some shit up on the battlefield.. And most of them pretend they are really tough. I served for 8 years and I watched countless guys gets their ass beat. Trying to bully guys from other branches just to get dog walked.. Then there were some that were tough. But they were tough without being a Marine.. Iraq and Afghanistan wasnt fun but it  wasnt DDay, war in the Pacific, or battle of the bulge
Proud to be a scouser. Marines are a tough bunch but looked like they took Paddy to heart and enjoyed the training and grappling with him. Much respect to Paddy and much respect to the marines!
Paddy = Marine already! By Catholic budda - indoc! eng ing = I eat - what I murder! OORAH - budda devil dog! OORAH Catholic invented (scotch , irish)! Sc = South Carolina - were wolf - society! Not ever - a legal ID!
2023 coming to a end and still believing that Paddy the Baddy is the most awesome human ever
"as I say, sorry im so fat lad" 😂😂
man! that was awesome,  great stuff
Too bad the US marines are not very tough 🤣   The video could have been titled “paddy pimblett takes on 10 average joes”
10th hold looked crazy
Dude got fat he was so fit
Absolute monster
I cant understand his english😢
funny seeing marines asking advice from an MMA star.....these guys must see and go through so much more than any MMA star has seen, snipers, IEDS, artillery bombardments , drone attacks....there are hundred of thousands of guys going through worse in Ukraine right now....never forget the real heroes...not overpaid sport-stars
If they don't have ground game they can't even play with him
hes the kinda guy youre initially annoyed by cos hes so out there but his authenticity wins you over in the end. top bloke.
This is wholesome, good job
Now image how ready those MMA fighters are he was out of form still beat all of them ..
Paddy is by no means known for his ground game, its extremely sobering seeing the difference between the average Joe and an “average” level grappler in the ufc
Hoo fuckin raaahhh!
So cool of Paddy and the Marines! Paddy's accent and attitude are so cool. I'd love to learn from him on the mats but hate to face him in the ring!
MCMAP black belts will get humbled by 3-4 stripe white belts alll day.
When out of shape Paddy is still in more in shape that  The Marines. It's just insane.
He just made my DI tap
USELESS MARINES.,.....a waste of US taxpayer money...6:47....the marine SHOULD HAVE NOT KEPT HIS HAND ON THE FLOOR....rather hold down Paddy's left arm.....IDI-O -TI -C MOVE FROM THE MARINE'S PART
You should do a video of the Marines martial arts vs paddy
This is gay
When was the last time you fought fat boy?
The marine saying stalemate is crazy ha
Crazy man, I’m in Hawaii by a military base and I get tapped out like nothing by these guys
faddys nightmare is tony
Such a beautiful kind soul and so real and transparent with the most personal stuff most men supresss. Nothing against anyone .. their message is as valid as anyone else; but hearing these things from so called 'alphas' (lil cringe) is so important. No one is gonna laugh a paddy or mike tyson. Im stating the obvious, but paddy is so likeable and relatable and loveable. You can be a sweetheart and a killer.  Respect and love, kind sir 🙏
That sequence of one by one grappling marines is sick
10:49 Paddy you’re supposed to handshake the guy and take the coin in the exchange 😂. All good it was funny lol.
Little did I know Sgt weaver would be my drill instructor this year.
Topuria is your father
"am I fat?"
It's hard to understand what you're saying sometimes
Shoulda been way longer vid :(
Thanks!
how is paddy so chubby after his fights XD funny guy
Paddy out here submitting dudes left and right easily after an insane workout. Pro fighters are different
Bro holy shit, Sgt Weaver was one of my DI’s
MMA Fighters Kill It over marine Shows Who Badass
Paddy the Baddy.!  S.A.S. going to be recruiting him.😂
Lowered order 🧬 and egos are robots right? 🖕 @marines 🖕
The little quip that Paddy made about having the balance of a ballerina is slept on knowledge. Having good balance and control over your center of gravity is extremely helpful in grappling.
Wow. What an impressive young man.
Bro that dude that he starts showing his jujitsu to is drill instructor sgt weaver (mfs crasy asf) fuckin bravo company
I dont know anything about the world of MMA but i love this dude.
What the f. language does he speak?!
Paddy this id the wrong crowd, these goofballs don't understand combat
This gave me full motivation for this morning work out. What a beast
w paddy
Marines know nothing about jiu jitsu. Try to fight BOPE from Brazil and you gonna be smashed for sure lol
No sé que piensen pero para mí la mejor defensa es el box 🙋🇲🇽
This was an unreal demonstration of your skill and endurance.
great job mate! making the Marines better!
Bro just casually going 10-0 against trained marines… AFTER going through that insane workout… he is absolutely right about thinking that you are better than everyone when in a combat sport. Mental awareness is as important as physical training when it comes to combat.
Paddy 10 Marines 0   : great
I’d love to see senator tommy “I’m more military than anyone” tuberville pull up to this camp. Train with a couple dozen marines and paddy, then tell us that the military is “woke” 😂
now if its a you can do anything fight to death marine wins most times
Combat fitness is the best
Damn fam
im sorry, im so fat.
pure Class
The Man.
Marines Rock.
Remember when the Marines fought for the people? Me neither.
Simper fly
what a shitty army if Paddy can win those fights xD
paddy should try a marine more robust and tough like a british royal marine
Paddy is clearly out of shape in this video.
Absolutely brutal workout.  No wonder these guys are shredded
Reality check
This guy is great I would love to train with him
Jiu-Jitsu doesn't rely on conditioning, as far as i c it, like chess it relies on brains n knowing where n when to move. i So Luhv that sometimes the smallest person can completely incapacitate some of the biggest opponents n it's mainly non-violent. i So Fuggn Love Jiu-Jitsu! n after watchin the vid, I So Fuggn Love U Paddy! what a Fuggn Champion! Love n Blessings Family!!!
Paddy GOLDEN BOY and “scousers never got knocked out” God Bless YNWA 🙏🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🌹 ps our beloved  LFC for the quadruple this season  BALLS TO THE MANCS 😂 pps you need to beat that last lad you fought stop the knockers
funny how this over rated fighter got so much fame from being a big mouth.... might as well  be another Jake PAul
Bro went from Patty, the baddie to fatty the baddie
The Kyak? 1:14 every country world wide calls it the Russian twist but ofc Americans can't even say the proper name because it has Russia in it hahahah L
This guy would have a massive following from fight fans. If he was not so juvenile, he must be hilarious for the u21, s but for adults it's embsressing
From when i first seen Paddy (just looking up irish fighters) i liked him! His energy, personality....smiling! Like wow! Most fighters look all pissy. Im definitely a fan! LOL
That man just went through a 10 marine gauntlet, 40lbs overweight, like it was NOTHING.  Nobody should be doubting this mans capabilities
From the first time I've seen him until now the dudes totally grown on me.
i try to learn English but this broooo what a hell ahah one of the best fighters!
I really don't mean this to insult Paddy in any way.   It's just I'm sorry, but Marines are trained to kill. What they are trained for really isn't applicable here, because their skillset is defined by an outcome of the other guy being dead. So it's like, a parent who lets their kids win because it's cute. But imagine America's enemies being like "Yo, hold up, lets knot up and throw an arm bar because we know the Marines ground game is so weak!"  I just don't see it....
Try it against royal marines next
For a English man speaks broken English seriously this video needs subtitles
Would a blast, to see him in the ring against Fedor.
Talking about mental health is real 💯  it helps to talk,, I've bottled shxt up an it makes it worse..
As a Marine we accept Paddy as one of us!!!
British always on top
Very wholesome video! Great stuff Paddy, Q&A was great...many vets really struggle mentally.
Marines wear socks in wrestling thats a major handicap. 0 grip with feet
Marine: “I’m 170 lbs” Patty: “I’m 200 lbs,.. sorry” Me watching: “the both of them are only 20 lbs more than me” 😬
Pa to je mali Katalenic! Kaj nije on u zatvoru?
You are a beast my good man.
@4:05 was the most British clap ever lol 😂
You would be a better man if you stop giving the  middle to everyone. You need to show some maturity Patty.🖕🏻🖕🏿🖕🖕🏽🖕🏼🤣😆😂
Tracing the Evolution of Martial Arts, Money & Consciousness  https://youtu.be/7pv15TpigkI   From Famous Fighters To Ancient Roots
Paddy has such an SAS mindset, love the scouse
I'm so impressed that he went and hung with the marines.  Not even just visiting but pushing himself.  New favorite fighter!
Paddy is what happens when ancient highland warrior DNA accidentally spawns
Paddy beats 10 of the fittest recon Marines Camp Pendleton could find. In a row. Geez. That's called walking the walk.
10 marines, 10 million views, 10 months ago
clown jajaja
Go on paddy...
😅 genuine and funny guy!
Just came across this, obviously heard of Paddy! Great video. Most importantly before taking the step to go for full custody of my son back in 2017, I was in the exact same place as Paddy describes. And absolutely bang on advice to let it off your chest. That's what I did to family, friends and neighbours. I found that people then told their stories and a few had been in similar situations and mindsets and their advice helped me through a tough few years. Now my son has been with me full time for 3 years. And life is amazing. Paddy, absolutely correct advice lad. ❤
I need this
I will never say shit about Dad bods ever.
Im sorry but EVERY human is conflicted and has controversial views. The flame in recent media is just ridiculous.. Give the man with a truly good heart a break!
I like this guy a lot more than sugar Sean or whatever his name is
Army guys had good bjj, some Even used rubber guard lol
Train with infantry marines not these lil boot poges your doing it all wrong pat those mates are imposters lad
is the translator included?
In paddy’s voice: “sorry ima such as fat fohjkk” hahah too funny. This is quality content my boys
Respect to then marines ! Paddy is à beast (and marines have to know so much other things ... shooting, hiding, swimming, ...) Paddy is always very smart 👍
I feel like while he was grappling he must have instances where his brain tries tells him to deliver shots and he has to restrain himself just from instinct.
lol looks fun until you do it 😂😂
Benoit Saint Denis would beat him for suure
why is the only female used as dead weight?
Impressive men
Wow, the non jerk side of Paddy is cool.
In the middle of battle do you request a similar size opponent?
I feel like them all wearing socks might not have helped them? I’m curious how much of a difference that made
now go play with the infantry instead of commo :)
He lookin like he's eating now . .   Getting money now
I've been on exercise with a few marines, and the biggest surprise is that these guys tapped and didn't just choke out or get their arms snapped. Stubborn bunch, proud bunch and tough bunch. And they have reasons to be all those things. Much respect for the amount of training and skill they possess.   We still managed to capture six of them in our exercise though, but man am I glad they are on our side.
Proper Liverpool lad!
Marines ought to squeeze out his odd binge/purge technique
Paddy is a real mf. Love that guy!
"i have to say, sorry im so fat mate"
I started watching for the sparring, and kept watching for the mental health advocacy. Keep it up, stay wholesome.
Can you imagine the boys landing in Normandy, going up onto the beaches and then.. fighting ju jitsu? Yeah exactly.
Oh yeah you know, just casually tapping out 10 trained professional killers for fun. Lol, Paddy is insane.
Did anybody notice that all the Marines had socks on and we're slipping had no grip for their feet like Patty did they were slipping and sliding like Michael Jackson
2:48 god damn she can carry me
“Sorry I’m a fat bastard” was the funniest shit 😂
internet is a great thinkg man  hearing and watching what these great warriors have to say about life and success is gold
He's the most wholesome MMA'er i have ever seen - seems like so a nice guy!
as a german i hardly understand. is he irish? speaks he irish?
Lol .. I’m still waiting to see a workout and some skills , looks all a bit Victoria Secret … 😂😂😂
Marines can't fight
was this filmed by an armless Parkinson's patient? So much camera shaking, can't see shit.
Like the real UFC days where you fought more than once in a night, not this once or twice a year crap. Bring back the UFC tournaments! Thanks you, come again.
Love how he's all fun and games, and then when its time to hit the mate he goes full ANIMAL!  Yo are a BEAST!
Fuckin' awesome video. He's really more than a great fighter,  seems like a really great guy! Subscribed.
i cant understand alot, his accent is too strong, but good video :D
Love this guy
This kid is amazing! That was Badass!!! Ten hard-core Marines and the kid just kept going!! Cool stuff!!!
Wow. You start the vid, see him and you think hes outta shape. But then he does this fucking crazy marine workout and still submits them all after. And yet still able to be so honest about his worst of times. Fucking Legend. One dude I'd really to to have some bers with.
Joke! The Gracie's have taught the military this not this guy! 🤣😂
Oooh, Patty the Fatty.... 🤣
The UK doesn't need equal amounts of soldiers to defeat our marines, they just need a small army of Paddies.....
Did wme img pay them for doing the job for him?
Khabib vs the best marine the us has to offer would be interesting
Still not a fan ...
ho yah" very cool
Every time I see this guy I like him a little more.  I am a fan now.
0:01 It looks so gay. LOL
Why does anybody care about this dude after that delusional pitiful showing with the Gordon fight? Gordon whipped that ass.
I mean… Thats San Diego. Roll out to Paris Island.
This is awesome!
I wouldn't have made through five minutes of this training.
GOOD VIDEO !. but damaged by the music in the background
Need more honest people like you sir!
"sorry im so fat lad"  lol, never gets old
The I'm sorry for being fast over and over is hilarious
I wonder if the Marines may look at this as a training option, hiring a MMA to teach them one to one, may be handy in the field.
Its another level…
incredible stuff
Muito bom 👋👋👋
0:02 😂
Dudes a joke lost to jared gordon anyone in the top 15 dog walks him
I lost all my confidence in Marines.
I wasnt a fan before but now I am.
I love this men being men without judgment just pure fucking brotherhood cheers boyz
One of those instructors was in bootcamp and one of my DIs
Class bro
This video is such trash… The Marines would just shoot you… you are trained to do one thing and that is fight, they are trained to win wars in close quarter combat. You and them are way different.
My man pretty much became the Exile and beat all the Mandalorians in hand to hand combat 😂  Cool video!
Awesome. 1) Trying to fight a professional jujitsu mma fighter IN jujitsu, one puts his own safety and life in danger 2) Marines fight to kill and survive not sport 3) Paddy is one of the hardest working and hardest fighting mm artists ever 4) the producer did not want him injured due to his extensive upcoming professional fight schedule.
They 100% couldn't understand a word he were saying
TOPURIA
What language is this?
ok now paddy vs ilia in jiu jitsu hahahahhaha
"sorry lad im a fat bastard" HAHAHA guys a legend
if you think about that Khabib would take out Paddy effortless... there are levels to everything
Still Padddy the Baddy. Doesnt make me loose respect for the military
Paddy is a skilled fighter but if they were trying to actually kill him most of them would.
I love that the UFC does so much with the Marine Corps. Just shows how special the Marine Corps is to our country.
I don't mind it
This just shows how big pussies marines are now
this man just wrestled and beat the most dangerous cult on the planet, jesus
Subtitles may be needed when move than one sentence hahah
2:39 had me dead
Everybody's gangsta until Paddy steps on the mat 😅. I don't know how many people know this but Marines grapple eachother like everyday, we used to hold straight up tournaments in the lounges during libo
Song name
Go to Quantico, Virginia and wrestle them Marines 😅 them Leathernecks ain’t a joke.
Paddy looks like a 70s Brittish Pop Rock star!!!!! LOL!!!!!
He forgot the hand shake coin transfer guy set it up and everything
2:59 has to be the most honest a person can be. "I have to say, sorry I'm so fat lad."
Rah
Get it off your chest, it’s real 😢👍👏👌 awesome advice
That was excellent… motivating and Paddy showing style and class.
EPIC  YOU LEGEND PADDY
“Put ngannou in there an I’ll pick ‘im up and drop ‘im on his fooking head Yk what I mean?”  Fucking love this guy😂😂 great mentality and such a great dude outside of of the ring
His enthusiasm for having a piece of an American ammo box shows his appreciation of even being able to be a part of something like a combatives class with the Marines.
Great lad 🇺🇲🇬🇧
Fight against Ilia
you were appreciated by men who recognize a warrior when they see one.
I would kill to be trained by paddy I swear 😭💯
How can u not like paddy honestly, I love they guy and the little “sorry I’m so fat lad” kills me, lmao ur good paddy, it ain’t nun for these mfs here I’m sure lmao
I didn't watch the video. Just understand that those submission holds are very dangerous in a "real fight." I'm talking about dangerous for the one applying.   The recipient cannot be fully alert when the hold is applied or it's done so quickly or tactfully that they don't have time to respond.   Otherwise, you are making yourself extremely vulnerable. Your only hope is he tries to use brawn instead of wit. Then with hold applied, he will lose. But if he keeps his wits, you might be in trouble. The street isn't MMA or UFC.
That is absolutely insane that he pulled a straight 1v10 consecutively🥶
Just tried the Abe pre workout - not for nothing it’s really good. Hope he markets it well . Can be really successful
Paddy Amazing! That should be his name. I've never seen him until today.
Good video, everyone is struggling in some way but it’s nice to see someone tackle it head on! Top Lad!
Well this was a wholesome video 👍
Paddy 0 - 1 Ilia Topuria 😂
Ilia topuria
title should have been.. paddy gets ass whopped by marines for days lol... should have went to Lejeune though where the real marines are.. see how the real warriors fight..these are just hollywood marines.. so imagine what the real ones are like. you can tell by the carries.. they aint training right at pendleton smh honestly the pads are cringe.. how are you body hardening with pads? but maybe they just used them for the video ... great video though.. if you know Daniel Leith.. he was actually my MCMAP instructor... he was nutrionist for Daniel Cormier when he was champ.. and is coowner of Lockhart and Leith... alot of UFC fighters use them.... would love to see another video.. but you on the East coast where the real Marines are :D
I loved the attitude and enthusiasm of all the Marines in the video. There conditioning was top notch. I would also like to mention what a great guy Paddy was for going there and showing them techniques to help them in real life encounters they may face in the world.
in combat i hope they would bite to get out of a hold.
Are these guys MARSOC?
So if you take a gun away from an American and throw in a chubby scouser and they’ll lose. 🤣🤦‍♂️
they spend billions of dollar can't win a afganistan , vietnam, korea, iraq others :D
“Paddy vs 10 marines”   🤨
I DONT KNOW SHIT about work outs,but this looks INSANE
I enjoyed UFC athletes doing the Last of the Mohicans course
One of the dudes not only I would like to hangout with but also to get tapped out by. Paddy continues to stay humble and grounded with all the "Fame" he has brought on by being a rare fighter
0:02   surely that's gotta be against regulations to rest your hand there.😅
So clearly we need ufc fighters to be in the marines
There are lots of reasons why people like you, Paddy. Though the biggest reason I like you is the respect you have for others even while fighting.
Not just any marine but raiders😮
I think Paddy is one of the most humble guys, he’s up there with Cowboy Cerronne, and i absolutely love this. I love when people who are so famous or at the top of their sport, just show that they are also human too. But i agree with what he says, you gotta think youre the best, you gotta think that you can beat anyone, but anything could happen.
Respectfully, any bjj black belt would go 10-0 against the marines even after a workout. Y’all must not know how bjj works haha. You’ll lose 1000 times in a row against a black belt if you haven’t trained more than a couple years
Marines are the most fiercest fighting force in the world for a reason. There is no social justice warrior garbage in the Corp, Just US, MC.
Been patty’s fan since day one 😭 and just now finding his yt
Paddy be like "I'll be Bach".
Nice Bloke Paddy, I have upmost respect for his attitude, wise beyond his years.
I come back to this vid every now and again. The mindset of a fighter and a soldier are one in the same. The mind is a powerful thing. It’s all we have. Conquering those doubts and thoughts of dread can be difficult for anybody even battle hardened soldiers of war and professional cage fighters.
Go paddy, I want to see them submissions in UFC.
This is awsome and smart for both sides marines learn better techniques and paddy get iron man workouts lol
great respect for paddy
Краще би ви таке не знімали
“Sick”
This man is an absolute humble tank.
dude this guy's voice is so weird af lmao
can we get a closed caption for him?
Ya gang of big bustards
This made me like this guy even more. Not because of his physical capabilities but his whole out look and attitude. Super down to earth and chill as fuck. And his whole speech on mental health was really eye opening to me.
I know so many people are going to say oooo paddy beat 10 marines. Paddy is a beast but marines are not trained for a cage. We are trained for 1 thing to kill. You can see in the workout carrying others for wounded marines. Most of our moves are to create distance to engage with lethal or to subdue. Paddy said don’t pull to hard do not want to rip your their shoulder. I was literally taught to grab twist pull someone eggplant off.
oorah devil dogs
holy shit that’s one of my drill instructors
Yeah apart from these are the USMC which are shit at hand to hand combat, you should do it with Royal Marines 🤷‍♂️
There is a technique if you put your thumb above your fist. You can literally cause internal bleeding.
If they were doing fight to the death the leather necks would win.  They would elbow and knee him to death.
The more I see of Paddy, the more I hate him. What a snug scouse c u n t
there is no chance against Paddy in submissions
6:33 his knee is getting torqued pretty good.
Paddy seems like a cool dude, that part made me laugh when he said "sorry I'm such a fat bastard" lmao
Love to see our boys training this hard with some of the elites atheletes...makes me proud of our military...for the first time in a while...
They're just sailors that like it rough when a new dude shows up.
“I just wanna say sorry I’m so fat” 😂😂. Fckin love scouse people.
This is unrealistic because the Marines are trained in hand-to-hand combat not some rule-based martial arts contest. A marine would destroy this guy with real combat technique. In combat there are no rules.
Much love from North Carolina, USA. I live next to Ft. Bragg army base and we have some excellent young folks serving in our military all over. Thanks for sharing your knowledge young man 🤙🤙
He is a machine
Damn he worked all 10 of em after a rediculous workout jesus
Fuckin legend.
Best episode yet!
Thats true BJJ beautifuly done! Oss!
Whats the black thing on paddy wrist its sick?
As if the marines are the best and strongest soldiers in the world. Go and try this with the Taliban. They teached the marines a very big lesson.
7:25 is my favorite move...
Приезжай в Россию,тут тебе покажут настоящую борьбу
You just now the marines watching were intimidated as fuck
Go marine!!!
the corps. has really changed since i was in... when i was in we wouldn't have even messed with something as useless as jiu-jitsu on a battlefield. we learned stuff like the importance of getting your fingers behind the larynx when you're ripping out someone's throat. and that it only takes 4 and a half pounds of pressure to tear off another man's ball sack.  nobody is trying to make anyone else submit on the modern battlefield. we want to kill the other guy.
This is wholesome and much needed in my life rn thank you 🙏❤
This is the type of military adverts we need!
You've got to train Ukrainian army lads too, bro! legend
how many cuts do you want in this edit?   YES...
Him apologizing for being so fat everytime someone picked him up was such comedy
This video was low key sick as fuck
Paddy is a funny guy and thinks on his feet... There's no better recommendation in my book.
Topuria te va a MATAR
Grappling is a fun sport and can be useful in combat, but it’s usually displayed as someone bending over and taking it from someone else. Can I reach your ears, eyes, hands or even your wrist if so you can be in for something worse than a beating, small joints and ligaments can be broken and damaged with a single hand grab. In order for someone to learn self defense grappling properly they should probably learn the brutalities of real self defense combat so they know how important the game of I’ve got your ear is. Just try playing with your own ear, but I wouldn’t advise touching your eye. Letting people know that you can strike them is important as well. Grappling is a good tool, but what is a good tool if don’t know how to apply it properly, it’s a delusion about what the what someone will do to defend themselves. I used to be able to get out of a choke hold while standing, one of the submissions that doesn’t require a bunch of setup on the ground it was easier to get out of and nearly impossible to get into. I don’t know why so much half baked self defense gets taught to people it’s dangerous, I’m sure they will learn more as they are training for combat. Now pretend you’re trying to run away and escape like we are in an actual fight to the death, like someone in a horror movie, this idea usually helps people to realize if you are kicking and screaming that you’re incredibly hard to get into a joint lock, but expels a lot of stamina.  The most effective fighting technique is to run away unless you are trapped or have someone or something to protect and it better be worth the risk.
are u lewis capaldi's brother😂😂??
wtf is this guy saying
Put him thru boot camp
This is bad ass
10:37 anyone else notice he tried to shake his hand and to just took the coin?😂😂
notice he wont do UK royal Marines loool Paddy put to sleep loool
I think there's a lot of young men out there right now they could really use to see a decent human being like Patti beat down a piece of trash like Tate
The funny thing is Paddy makes it look easy, love his attitude and humility... also a good learning curve for the marines...
Приезжай ЧУДИК, поборись с НАШИМИ КРАПОВИКАМИ...
What a beast. The government only trains marines to shoot people
Love from Dublin Ireland respect to you paddy
The biggest fear the world always had since WW2 is giving the u.s and u.k a common enemy that everyone blood boils against
Gotta believe in yourself if you want to be a fighter. Life is hell when you let your environment trick you into thinking that you cant believe in your abilities.
What all the 6ft 200lb Marines weren’t there that day?
Paddy's a BEAST! Go Paddy!
Marines are trained to kill.  UFC fighters are trained to fight in UFC arena.  Both are top of their game.  In a real life hand to hand combat (without weapons) life and death situation, I would argue the Marines, on the average, may have a slight higher chance of winning since they probably have better endurance and tougher killing instincts.  If there is a non-firearm weapon involved, Marines' odd would increase at least 50%.
2:45 paddy wasn’t tryna touch the barracks bunny but then saw his alternative and said fuck it 😂
what happen whit illia, come on... cry
Bro at 7:12 under Paddy's mounted triangle saying "stalemate" XD XD XD XD nooooo my man. He was just chilling for a second. Your goose was cooked.
Haha I bet some of those marines thought they did a good job not getting tapped immediately not understandings they’re fresh and he’s taking on dudes back to back
Topuria
Now do UFC vs US Special Forces
Now do UFC vs US Special Forces
Now do UFC vs US Special Forces
1:20 Paddy no idea? looks like they don’t have idea Paddy give them middle finger in the next frame 😂
0:02
*the smallest marines they could find
Do the same with royal marines get mashed up
Did it take 10 marines to match up the weight?
"the few, the proudly can't grapple for shit, the marines"
“Sorry lad I’m a fat bastard” 🤣 I fucking love paddy
So far my impression of Paddy……. I like him
The USMC tokens of appreciation tho.... topped only by the respect they showed throughout! Thanks for doing this with our troops, Paddy!
Too good
One session with some marines n he loses 80% of them cheeks 😆 🤣
Good chap 😎
I ko U, straight out of Pendleton men's department.
If your struggling with mental health the only way to beat it is to stop trauma dumping in youtube comments and bingeing videos. Talk to a professional and work on the fundamentals.
No, it was Paddy v. the US Marines. THE Marines are the Royal Marines, who the US Marines were modelled on. The fact that the Americans have to put "US" in front of "Marines" tells us this.
Not a single soul: .... Paddy: Sorry I'm such a fat bastard.
Allow killing strikes, youd last one round. What do you think marines are trained for, wrestling? 🤣😂
They let gays in the military now and it realy shows hear how weak our armed forces are due to lack of real men USA  needs the draft back to gt better warriors
10:48 the coin hand off that all military understand, shake and take. Made me laugh to see him just take it out of his hand. Obviously it's because paddy doesn't understand the tradition and no one would expect him to understand it. Just funny to see.
What a genuine great guy..
Funny training, better have US Marines... .
First english person i need subtitles for..   "I never went to sleep last night , i had the bathesh fjasagdglujsd dksjnf sdkfs nhfsdbu asjda päs."? huih???? what??? lol
Try all that shits with Topuria.... LOL
I'm in no way experienced so I'm just asking a question here.  When you're in that leg triangle and you have an arm in there too, you can't use that arm that arm that's my your head to push off the chest and break that hold?  like in 6:48.
The chick that tried to insert herself into the video by having paddy carry her for no reason is a social media influencer marine. She gets like no respect from any actual marine. Literally trying to use paddy for clout
Illa topouria
Jujitsu is just soooo cool.
how would you think would do against a SAS or a navy seal
That’s pretty impressive Tbh.
I mean this is comms marines, I wanna see this with infantry marines or combat engineers
everybody understood 70% of what he was saying the whole time
Hard not to give major respect to anyone who rolled with and tapped 10 marines in a row.
Like this guy a lot.
The apologies for being fat was hilarious
Do you want to fight @Gosheto7 he is the best in Bulgaria and he will whoop your ass
0:02 grab that balls bro
Hope they had a translator
I’m a ex marine and I can tell you that was impressive as hell those guys are far superior to your average marine by a mile and he tapped everyone out…
Damn, looking like Paddy the fatty here
What's the soundtrack when he goes against the marines
Xxx bless u in Jesus name
Oh ,our sweet Lord Saviour Jesus Christ please help us , pour down your Holy Spirit of Truth ,soften and change their hearts from a heart of Stone to Heart of Flesh ,so they may see your only Truth Halleluyah  xx No Harry Potter no witchcraft !!!! The Only Truth Way to the Father , Hallelujah
Semper Fidelis
Bring that shit to an Infantry unit,…..
Paddy....me ganaste desde Orizaba un saludo campeón.
Mariner The fucking shitt
You want to know what I love about you Paddy? All you are is one hell of a scrapper playing around and getting paid for it. Love it!
Bravo Paddy. Respect brother.
Take a Marine any Marine, put him and paddy 500 yards apart with old school iron sights on the rifles see who walks away.
This is essential training for Marines on leave.
@ 10:48, LOL. If you know, you know.
True inspiration mate, they're right and you are, attitude is everything. I'm currently in them dark times, smoking every day from am to pm to numb the pain. From young ive been very athletic (excelled in most sports ive ever tried, not to blow smoke up my ass) suffered very bad ligament damage (achilles heel) to my left foot. Took up smoking weed when I was 15/16 due to the injury.. 25 now, went from my youth excelling like I said in most fields, to now being 25 high as a kite each day working as a fucking chef. The only great highlight that nothing can or will ever top is my 3 beautiful daughters, if it wasn't for them, I dont think I'd really be here. Just so unhappy my dude.
Paddy and MARSOC just fit together😂
Are you that mf that wanted to fight in a backyard 😂
Levels
Awesome vid … 💪🏻
“sorry lad imma fat bastard”🤣🤣
God fucking dayum
paddy is my favorite person
SEMPER FI
this is SEAN from rdr2
this has convinced me i can be a marine
That is awesome
So awesome!!! Our badass Marines can't roll the mat like Paddy but Paddy can't do full on assaults and war like our Marines and both know this and respect eachother 100%!!! Both are professionals and masters of there own profession. God bless all of you for being masters of your trade! 💪🏼💪🏻💪🏽💪🏿
This boy got ass kicked but they gave him the fight I don’t like him
If one of the toughest people out there tells you to talk to who’s close to you because he used to cry everyday then you f*****g listen
thank u for ur sebice
wished he would've worn combat pants and boots...
Damn that's crazy
It was at 9:15 that the Marines couldn't understand a word he said hahaha
That barracks bunny was like hey there a guy that hasnt picked me up 😂
where is he from? Love that accent haha
Lowkey bro imagine one of the moves he trained the marines imagine they use that in combat and it saves their life’s crazy
ta gordo
I have so much respect for this guy! He definitely gets an oooraaah from me!
Maquina total
Paddy is a different breed of human. So much respect for him.
This was so hawt, had a semi during the wrestling part.
Good man   great attitude
Mucho marine pero como te coja topuria sólo hace falta un español para hacerte llorar
Realmente los peleadores de la UFC son otro nivel !!
Saludos desde CHILE 👍.
fix your diet , someone will come along and school u , be ready
Paddy got a great workout in. 👍🏻
Big fan paddy.honourable shit.
Dude this gave me soo much inspiration ive been so depressed nd down on myself mate to the point where im almost lost my job now cause i dont care anymore thanks man hopefully my life can change now im going to take your advice
You can see the younger Marines trying to brute force out of a submission. They have rage in them and it's beautiful to see.
More of this paddy !!
good ole 9th crime lmao
Dude you a badass! Inspirational
This soldiers save US around the world all the BEST for all of you
I realy LOVE that boy and what he is doing with the soldiers the BEST he is so good
Un crack...es Inglés pero me cae bien. 😂😂😂
Krav Maga?? Solo veo BJJ o Grappling. También se ha visto lanzar al saco un jab/crosh a un marine y un poco flojo. Pero Krav Maga? No veo krav Maga por ningún lado.
He's like a god damn anaconda haha
He like a British snake the way he wines them up and twist them on their back 😂
This was a great video! I’m impressed the marines gave it their all!
You wanna try going down to CTCRM Lympstone and see how proper Marines train Paddy 🇬🇧 UK RM way better than American
Cool :D Reminds me of Miesha Tate taking on those boys who challenged her :)
The way he kept apologizing to each marine when they picked him up😭😂
0:02  hand check
Marine training compared to SAS Training is weak... Not much of a challenge mate. lol
Learn Tai Chi too, then when you don't what to cuddle you can throw. lol
Good on ya paddy we support ya
What was #10? Looked like some version of a twister?
The world and our military could benefit from a having a whole bunch of Paddy's I am a 9 time in 10 years deployed combat veteran and I take my mental health just as serious as my physical health. Everyone should it is not tabboo to go to a head doctor every once in a while.
who are u always give ur intro in start of video
Me, an actual fat 200lbs: patty c’mon now 💀
Disrespect to all UFC fighters....
That's hard-core gifts dude.
it killed me you apologizing for being fat while on the guys shoulder :DD hahaa i cant
Paddy looks so different now holy shit.
Where is the translator? I caught about half of what he said lol
Absolute respectful legend wort that sub
Brilliance 👍👍
“Im sorry lad im a fat bastard” lol floors me. Paddy’s a beast tho, gotta respect it.
Give them a M16
well done paddy la .
I'm not sure these are normal marines, are these raiders?
He speaks english???
that 10th guy he beat definitely wrestled in highschool
Used to love him.  Hate him now.
7:12 the guy in a triangle saying “stalemate?” Reminds me of the scene from the Holy Grail when the knight’s arms and legs are chopped off and he says “ALRIGHT, WE’LL CALL IT A DRAW”.
I look at every one of these amazing marines, and all I can think about at every turn is the evil people that forced an in jec tion on them that will end their lives early. It is so sad.
paddy is such a respectable guy irl
This is class man, I’m currently suffering with agoraphobia and depression & anxiety and I’m binge watching you atm not laughed this much in awhile . Such massive respect for you man honestly. Funny legend not just a fighter !🙏🏻💜
"Its gonna get worse" LOL
"Sorry im so fat" out of freaking breath: "not your good" nah, you are pure musulce my friend.
UK LADS AND SEMPER FI COLLABORATION, I LOVE IT
I haven't been watching the UFC for a while. I've only seen highlights of his fights. This is way better. Way to make some killer content!
Thank you young man for doing that with our boys. You seem to be a class act and it was greatly appreciated. I believe it may have been a different story if you attempted that against my Army Special Forces boys!! Lol. Obviously there is some rivalry between us. Best of luck in life young man. Stay straight!
Jesus Loves you all very much!!!! God Bless everyone!!!!
You are special because God said you are. You are loved because God said you are. You matter because God said you do.
This was 12 minutes of paddy apologizing for being fat 😂😂😂😂 awsome vid
🇺🇦
Awesome. Praying your as successful as you want to be. Sounds like you're surrounded by some good people.
Should this with SAS! Would be 10 injured/unconscious soldiers coz they wouldn't tap out! 😂😂😂
Notice that there is a 8 pointed star representing satan and his minions and devils Amen!
this lad is an absolute role model
Paddy isn't in good shape at all. Look at his face! He gain weight!
Kids this clears you can say many abusive words in front of marine.....😂
love paddy he is great
my fav part is him apoligizing for being "fat"
Nice to see there is still a USMC!
Love how Paddy is so real and down to earth
no le entendi nada
Fatty ... you are over-hyped "fighter", who lives in denial of your last fight, which was definitely a loss. You will be beaten and exposed for the below average fighter you really are.  You talk the talk (took a page out of Conor's book) but even though he never defended his belts, at least he won the fair and square, which is something you'' never achieve in the UFC.
Love paddy 😂
😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Do that with grunts. Different mind/skillset. Don’t get me wrong - we love our comm folks. But it is NOT the same.
Paddy being a chonk on the downtime but still screwing with the best the US have to offer is just brilliant. The 'Attitude Is Everything' moniker definitely fits in there
Imagine training ur whole life to b a marine just to get out wrestled by an out of shape scouse lmao
Constantly getting that fat your body isn’t going to last long. You should try to get the Conor fight asap to be the guy who smashes him into retirement. If not you it’ll be anyone else. You could steal his European fan base.
100%Respekt !Amazing Person and the Man from the Marines Amazing too!
Paddy the Fatty! Love this guy.
Basically a black belt vs a group of the most physically fit white belts in the world
Hit em with the Hitman's quote.. Im the Best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be.
Good job spending time with some of the MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN THE WORLD!!!!! 🎩 tip!!!
Topuria is waiting for u🤡
Sell out Paddy, company boy , kiss ass
Well done Paddy for explaining mental health. Without control of your mental health you are no one.I witnessed one suicide and was close to two others. My Nana made me mentally strong and sixty years later I still repeat as a mantra my Nana’s words of wisdom as those words prevented me going down the dark paths.
Unreal legend. Watching from Scotland peace and love to all
I'd love to see this again with a fighting fit PtB
love <3 ❤❤💪💪💪😎🥶
This was pretty damn cool
I would say real ground fight rules.. boots and utes until someone taps. But he would still win
People dress in green clothes, lift and carry each other. Army is comfy.
What a beast! Love you Paddyyyyyy!  ❤💪
man its soooo difficult to understand his accent jajajajaja, of where he is?
Badass Paddy cheers 🎉🎉🎉
Incredible. And some of those dudes wore black belts. Paddy has got to have the Energizer Bunny inside of him.
Awesome video. Paddy gained a ton of respect here, in my opinion. He is very real. Hate seeing the ring persona, but the REAL Paddy is pretty down to earth. Great stuff!
fair play anyone involved in combat and see their friends die or hurt. Go and speak to someone. The British and I'm guessing the US is the same the govt haven't done enough.  Its a disgrace people who are willing to take the ultimate sacrifice end up being homeless. There is no shame in talking to someone.  Good luck to those Marines
There's the US marines and there is the Royal Marines commandos. Saying that Paddy would ruin both
Awesome video. Jealous those Marines got the experience of a lifetime!
Every night the Boogey Man looks under his bed to make sure Paddy isn't there.
Bro those socks would stink after that workout in them shoes 😂😮
This dude is a monster
I’m a white belt at a very high level gym. I LOL’d at the one minute round suggestion 😂
If Paddy has 2 🥚🥚,he must fight against Ilia topuria. But...💩
Patty submitting 10 marines is great PR
Nice one Paddy! Proud of ya lad… You’re an inspiration and reading that comment below about the person who took inspiration from your words and it saved a life… Can’t wait to see you fight again. At least one RED is winning 😭😭
"Me vs marines. Not at once. I woulda got me head punched in" 🤣🤣.
mans a beast
So to win a war with hand to hand combat all you need is an army of Paddies XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Paddy "the fatty" is more like it. Bro, what did you do to yourself ?
2:18 ugh ya hate to see it. Someone teach this man how to punch properly for fuck's sake, he's a marine.
The plaqe from the marines was pretty cool.
В берцах на татами, пздц!
The rest of this video is on gay pornhub where paddy gets his ass railed by the entire crew of marines
He explains the techniques incredibly well. Very noice
Ten out of ten is excellent!  Not bad for working on little sleep, going thru a surprised full Marines workout, teaching expert grappling techniques to Marines and THEN, running ten matches back-to-back until surrender is pretty damn good!  I appreciate your mindset of no one can beat me no matter what or who they are!  That's a very high level of confidence, belief and faith.  I liked how you shared and advised disciplined killers to not hold it in but rather to reach out and get mental help.  As a fighter-athlete, you should consider leaning up to reduce extra undue stress on your heart working too hard.  Bottom line is that you did an awesome job! 👍
I frickin like that guy... I just wanna hang out with the guy. Drink a beer or 2.
What is the name of the song?
Paddy’s the man
9:18 dude wtf. Sounds like chinese haahha
Paddy thanks for the nice content <3
The best fucking LAD to ever live ❤😂
Fuck yah, Semper Fi. Love that paddy got out there and rolled with them. Good on him.
I am a big fan of the Paddy. Our Marines are the best.
best
11-0 after the workout lol US military needs a gracie jiu jitsu sponsorship
Go on paddy well done mate you did amazing🙂👍be proud🤜🤛
alright lad, you were looking solid taking on 10 marines in a row. So good seeing warriors like this being able to talk about mental health and that good mates will put an arm round ya when you say you're feeling bad and anyone who puts you down for it, ain't your mate. Seen a lot of stuff from you paddy, subscribing after this one.
Sorry I'm so fat lad 😭😭😭
Love this kid! He's such a good grappler
Savage workout and rolling with savages
Respect 🔥🔥🔥
the difference between a soldier and a gladiator , I remember in my mma gym I trained at we would have soldiers come and train and it was tough for them at our gym but they kept up and they were awesome all around this one recruiter would pay a years worth to my coach and stay there for 2 months just a good guy , support troops people
If you go to a significant other, friend wife whatever..someone close, and tell them you're having a tough time and they respond with wtf are you talking about, i feel fucking great!...just walk away
Encore! Encore! Author! 👏 Awesome video, Paddy! You're an old soul with a young attitude! Awesome combo! Thanks for the awesome edu-tainment!
I got mad respect for Paddy.
BOOYAH !!!!!
I like this fighter and I hope he continues being great. I hope he doesn't become what Connor became.
Paddy is my favorite fighter, thanks for the video brother
this is a great video and its hilarious how many times he raises his middle finger..also those gifts they gave you are super cool
this was great - nice video.  and recognition to their service.
"Ijus want to say I'm so sorry I'm so fat lad"
i like how his personality goes in full concentration and demolition mode, nevertheless some of the marines did very well, some small mistakes took them out.
Doesn’t change the fact uk are betas to America
Paddy your obviously a monster 💀☠️☠️ They put you thru it big time 💯💯 But Paddy Straight 🏫🏫🏫 SCHOOLED 15 MARINES STRAIGHT. YU WIN... Street fighter 😂😂😂 You Win. But it was Obvious Cos the Next Man 👞👞👞 To Hopefully do What Conners do with Regards to Weight in Different Categories n Pad Can do 3 cos if his walk around weight n he can eat omg can he. The Shoes R Obviously 4 Conners Name. A living Legend. The UFC Not 🚫 Say Conor made the UFC Obviously He Didn't but he bought Alot lot MORE EYES 👀👀👀👀💯💯💯 Turned it on 🔥🔥🔥💯. Give what  McGregor has done. Made Dana Alot Richer and mad Alot if fighter's 💰💰💰💸💸💸💸💸 Off His name n that's Fact. Paddy Says the same So It's gotta Be Tru Lmfao ygm Laaaah
Those are recruits not marines
What a training schedule legend go paddy 👀🙌
Love this guy - just a proper sound lad
You are better than the Beatles Paddy. Thanks for having a great heart. You are definitely a real winner.
Man mad respect to paddy.....what a badass.......and the marines God bless you guys.....
It was just unbelievable!!! Ten Marines in a row...
Paddy is fucking AAA. Can't wait to see him continue to whoop ass and be a classy gent.
True martial Artist
Erah
Raiders🤘🤘🤘
Does paddy still do ufc
The most highly trained American soldiers Vs a slightly chubby Northern lad. The results may shock you
Should not be too hard given what Marines have become today.
Wow Paddy is a cool bloke I like him good bloke ❤️❤️❤️👍👍😀😀🥊🥊🥊🦘🦘🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
they shoudl teach jj in the marine maybe!!
Paddy don’t teach American rats anything
0:43 I'm gonna get F'd up by some Marins C's...brilliant. Awesome video, thank you.
Top man..very genuine, an inspiration . Watching this made my day so much better..
That was absolutely amazing to watch! The Real Deal. People should understand that Marines are the Bad MFs you thought they were. A different type of machine.  Elite group of soldiers.
Paddy don't know what .556 is because he's from the UK and guns are bad mmmmkaaayyyyy
❤️From salty Nova Scotia 🇨🇦 Give 'em hell !!!
My*
Simple awesome 😎
Sorry lad, im a fat bastard ahahahahah
When that lump of lard falls off his hype bike, and comes up against somebody who can actually fight, he is gonna get badly hurt.
Paddy is a good kid and a big kid at heart💜 His mother should be proud of herself for raising such great character and personality traits in him. Cheers ya'll. God bless the Marines and Paddy for what an intense workout and marines guys too.🇬🇧🦁💜🦅🇺🇸
Class that!!
Semper Fidelis, Oorah 😎
Have a great weekend to relax paddy😅💪🏽
Mighty PADDY! Merry Christmas from Scandinavia to you!
Well done definitely more to Paddy than the Brash fighter I first saw
bring back 'Bully Beatdown'  with Paddy as the Host.
That MCMAP shit does not work
Fucking love this guy
well done paddy ,,good job
Brilliant. That honesty and heart.
Respect.
I saw this dude on TikTok and it was awesome. I didn't know he was this awesome and has only lost three times! Truly amazing
i love how in the workout portion Patty was apologizing for being fat. had my ass laughing so hard.
Отличное видео!!
I like how paddy just keeps apologizing for how fat he is😂
I didn't know Paddy as I don't follow MMA much these days. Despite his f-bombs and middle fingers, he strikes me as a genuine guy who's always there to help his friends and just people in general.
Your a real one paddy. I just now realized you have a channel I will start watching more!
Paddy a real one
cool guy but looks like a South Park character
I liked him always,but know he is loved for hanging with Jarheads!!!
Very Cool!
I thought it was scump
Please fight logan and beat him real bad. Pleaaaaseee  🙏
good times
Glad this video popped up on my feed. You’re a real class act Paddy, a remarkable human being. You gained yourself a fan.
1 blonde vs 10 marines sounds like an interesting PH title   But seriously, I really appreciate Paddy, bring awareness to mental health, especially men's mental health. As the stigma needs to go
love how tate thinks he stands a chance
first i didnt like this lad. he is starting to grow on me. i might actually travel out of my docile country to see my first ufc fight. This kid is something to look out for ppl. I have had my fair share of bruised knuckles and stitches in the face to know what im talking about here. This kid can fight.
Keep being you bro! 💪😎👌💯
😀 Paddy will do anything ! 😀🎉
Paddy is a low tier fighter(love him just saying hes not there yet) who tapped 10 marines in a row. Marines are already tough as shit and better than 99% of civilians. Makes you think how good these fighters really are when compared to anyone else
He's a marketable guy with a fun personality but holy hell, the Gorden fight showed this dude is not ready for top 10 competition any time soon.
True warriors meet another. The theater is different, but much is the same.
Even though I may have not understood all the words Paddy said (english is not my native) I really love the attitude (plaque at the end said it all too), the genuine way he approaches people, the honesty when he speaks. Awesome.
bro says    sarddly ima fat bastard
the baddy
Topuria kills you
Dudes a beast and seems to be very real.
STRAIGHT EPIC!!!!!!
ima tell my kids this was saint paddy
All the reactions I saw from him were🖕🖕  haha😂😂🤣. I was dying. Your an awesome guy tho and a great fighter
Love it!
A little bit fat ah?! Curious man this Paddy! Yes sirrr!
This is amazing
All repect to Paddy - love seeing him fight. But I wanna see Paddy do a  5 click run in boots and fatigures and then roll with the boys in the same kit. That's the difference between service personel and athletes  the conditions under which they perform.
There is no such thing as a tough US marine now days
Paddy seems like such a genuine guy. The point he made about people who are your true friends/mates is important. When your going through dark moments in life and the people around you don't want to hear it they aren't your real friends/mates. That's an important distinction. 👍
2:58 lmaoooo "sorry i'm so fat."
my man was like "stalemate" llmaol he just submitted 9 other marines
Did that guy just gently pad Paddy's groceries?
This goes to show that all those military "tough guys" that think they can beat a professional fighter in a fight are absolute 🤡s 😂
"Sorry lad, I'm a fat bastard." 💀💀💀
the Blonde irish dude said many things at the start but i couldn't understand a word     :D
Bullshit been fighting all my life and I just grab cunts by throat. Straight in no kissing I'm 220 pounds.  Fuck  punching works every time.
Deadly.
Paddy seems to be a nice guy, but I can't understand jack squat of what he says 😅
Humble enough to compliment, tough enough to kick ass, wise enough to give advice, and receive it.
He didnt shake his hand when getting the challenge coin *dies*
This is my first exposure to Paddy the Baddy, and I'm very glad.
Impressive. Guy has some balls & mindset.
half this video is Paddy apoligizing for being fat and flipping people off
Wow. For him to do that big workout first, then take on NINE marines individually. How much break between? That's insane stamina. It's amazing how a well trained grappler can take out these tough guys. It's like someone who trains in chess playing someone who hasn't...no chance regardless of personal stats.
Looks like a awesome experience
Don't they girls in the marines now that pass for doing nothing I thought if you failed you don't pass not now you get a puspus card 🤔
Is this the same guy from music video Pussyking Superstar
I died when he just grabbed the coin out of his hand 😂 shake paddy allways shake the hand
That hammerfist would have felt nice he got some inertia on it
"Pimblett has said that his trademark floppy hair and lack of tattoos allows children to identify with him in a way that would not be possible for them to do if he was "a big hard fella with lots of tattoos." Idk if this is true, but anyway, this man is a truly fresh face in the world of MMA. Hope he has a lot more success. P.S. i dont think he ever worked out this much in his whole life as in this episode lol
Fair play paddy
HeS a Big overrated this little girl
Paddy: As i said, im so sarrey im fat xD That had me crying
What’s not to like about, Paddy. He’s not just an amazing fighter and a great character, he seems like a really decent bloke.
Paddy the Fatty..? Still schools these chiseled Marines. Knowledge is 50% of the battle (maybe more in this case). Good job man. Loved watching it. How long total did it take to tap all 10 guys?
Fatty daddy
Favorite MMA fighter of ALL TIME!!!
wish he'd come to okinawa
Idk if its just me but i feel like the marines are kinda dumb for leaving their socks on for jiu jitsu
In a real fight he would lose. Marines are taught to kill. Destroy stance, crush knee, blow to groin, crush windpipe. This is staged.
oorah marines cpl jvg usmc    paddys for real good vid men and woman my brothers and sisters still doing it daily      semper fi
Super good clip; thanks all
amazing content, amazing guy. o7
How can you not like this guy, my very best to Paddy!
How can you not like this guy, my very best to Paddy!
This agains demonstrates the vast difference between a regular joe (if you can call a marine a "regular joe") and a pro fighter. It's so big a difference it's not even funny.
swede Swede SWEDE SWEDE
I love this guy…….. hey cam anid beait ouuull they moreins!!!!😅 cool  I hope thas goes you write in British (jk) love y’all
Paddy's got charisma through The Stratosphere. Great video!
Never mindy paddy the baddie, how about puddy the goody
Quite the tribute. Those Marines are awesome.
As long as Patty doesn't let his ego get the better of him, like a certain famous Irish fighter, he will be golden.
He quotes Bret Hart...best there is, best there was, best there ever will be.
Couldn't beat Gordon though...
Rah
Respect ☺️☺️
Sorry lad I'm a fat bastard 😂😂😂 love this guy helped me so much
I really admire Paddy, he's going far in the UFC. My respects to you man !
what a guy
A+ Video Paddy!  Keep up the great work!
How much did he get for this one?
“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for peace and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.” Give your cares over to the Lord. I did depression and fear for many thing was overcome.  Draw close to Me says the Lord and I will draw close to you....
Marines are trash, Fight real special forces like SASR
im reading all these comments with a fucking accent now for some reason
Lad I wanna say that I love you.
Respect and best wishes bro!  great vid!
I hope them men did not take the jab
“I’m sorry I’m so fat lad” 💀
Paddy the fatty🫶
Nobody loves Paddy the baddy more than me…However, I do wish he would change his name to Paddy the goody…Paddy the ok…the reason is my niece is ony 5 and she cries when she hears he’s ‘a baddy’.  And hides behind the sofa
I feel like even basic MMA learners are pretty deadly
Worth the watch. Loved it.
Paddy is more Irish I believe!
Baddy... did he give himself that name based on his last fight?
You’re a warrior mate,..an  refreshing change to see a guy, without any tattoos, you’re so  different  not following the masses
I really dig this dude.
i mean US marines are known for being cannon fodder they not exactly the strong type they have ncie physique and all but they cannon fodder
. . . the cam is always unsteady so that one ins't able to really tell where some strengths or weaknesses would be   -  you'r good - no you're good - fvck you - fvck yourself - and then these faked self-estimations - is there any brain, too ? This is almost Hollywood on YT -  soo poor !
Paddy seems to have a big issue with his weight
5:39 - Beast...
First time watching his videos and I see him on TikTok all the time , seems like a really cool dude.
Paddy has impressive emotional intelligence that is not common for fighters in my opinion.  Go on beating 10 marines in a row then sit down talking about real issues that men deal with.  He balances confidence, humility and self awareness very well.
PADDY FOR PRESIDENT!!!🤘🏽
Truly an amazing young man. My older brother suggested I have a look at this video to see how you did against 10 U.S. Marines. I was impressed with all the action, but the most impressive part was how you talked about your struggles and how you overcame them. Thank you for taking the time to reach out to these young Marines and give them solutions to problems all men endure at some point in life. Paddy, you're a gem. Stay safe & stay handsome. ❤ 👍 ✌
Marines stand no chance against a pro ufc fighter. Marines have to specialize in many different topics, fighting, fire Arms, explosive, leadership. But a ufc fighter specializes in one thing.... combat sports
About as far from being a 'baddy' as you can get . Best ambassador for the Scouser since the Beatles. TOP BLOKE!
Why you fighting those marines; gotta goto Russia and fight the real soldiers 😅
You lost
Paddy, you are a solid bloke.
That type of facility was not around when I was in Pendleton.  I am glad to see it, I am liking Paddy more and more.  Wishing him all the success in the world and a quick Semper Fi to my younger Jarhead brothers who must live the best life possible for all those who have fallen.
Paddy tapped a team of 10 marines and didnt even try to hurt any of them
Bro lost 15 pounds in the first 4 minutes of the workout
How can anyone not root for this bloke.
Paddy you will always be employable after UFC. You relentlessly prove yourself to be an excellent role model for males. You could be doing endless work in public relations. You're going to be an extremely wealthy man, financially and physically. All happiness to you Paddy.
i was a marine for twenty years! they have hard ons for carring people its retarded! al you do is destroy back carriyng someone 100lbs more than you. no point to it other than destroy your body. back problems for life. in combat troops are weighed down with 200lbs of gear marines are bunch of scared 18 year old boys your sacrificial lambs for satanic cult freemasons who runs the military. they dot even give you bullet proof vests . your all sacrificed to baal god!
Paddy the Fatty in this video.  This guy is the most over-hyped fighter ever and Dana's boy.  F this guy.
This is the first video I have ever watched of Paddy. The only reason I watched it is because my son is a Marine, he just returned to Camp Pendleton from Japan. I am impressed with his attitude and his physical ability to tap out ten Marines after a long workout.
Forgive my unusual comparison but Watching Paddy is like seeing Irish Steve Irwin the UFC Hunter
Paddy is the realest there is. Never change man
He looks Boris Johnson in his best years.
7:32 - does anybody knows what choke is that?  what's its name? thank you.
Paddy is one of the best grapplers in on the planet right now. Forget graham Ryan and bear Jew - paddy beats them both for my money. Scouse lad !
What an inspiring character 🤘🔥🤘
Jajaja! Paddy the Fatty!!! Love this fighter! Subbed!
To train like this the day after a heavy night on the beer. It's one way to work off a hangover.
It's a good thing Mohm-pedos are Re+a#$ed and can never learn these moves.
“Sorry I’m so fat lad”😂
Tell your cameraman to STOP moving the camera
It always amazes me how you flip the switch when you are working. I appreciate your words of wisdom about talking about what is inside. Anxiety and depression can take over your mind after combat. Thanks for letting them know it’s good to talk. Your awesome Paddy
Right on.Wsy to get after it Paddy. Thank you men for your service.
Paddy, can hardly understand a word you say sometimes.
Paddy is the Man.. tapped 10 out..
I now realise what a great guy Paddy is -  he is truly inspirational, legend!
This video is great because it lets us get to know the REAL Paddy, and I like what I saw and heard. 👍✌
Paddy is the real deal. Lot of doubters in UFC. Press on young lad.
Kind of sad that we don’t have this type of Training for our military.
Cool video. Hats off to the Marines and Paddy for being real.
More from this shit!!!
Great Man Paddy, this video has it all, very good ! Recomended 100%.
me as a not native en speaker I have a certain difficulties to understand this man, but I had similar problem with other famous guy, but after some time it became more understandable, so I hope it will be the same in this case :) he seems to be a genuine honest and good man.
Hey Paddy.   I got a win win situation for you......arrange to do your training with them jarheads.  They'll run you dry.....you can improve your technical skills with other pros, but these guys will make you hard!
PADDY IS A FRAUD. JUDGES AND DANA RIGGED THE FIGHT FOR YOU. BUM.
He’s one of the best grapplers 👍👍👍 Wonder how he’d do with the rest of the training? I’d love to see it. 👍👍👍
Yummy 😋🤤
Seeing him submit all the marines after that workout is insane. Endurance off the charts Paddy
man marines tap quick, he's not having those chokes even locked. They have to train, lifting shit and running around is not all
Anyone: picks Paddy up Paddy: 'sorry I'm so fat man'
He is definitely feeling that extra 50 pounds and its cons. He was up to 205 pounds. That is such a huge weight increase over a couple months from his fighting weight. Looks much healthier and energetic at his weigh in (156 pounds). A 1st degree BJJ fighter is game over for untrained BJJ opponents. I watched another youtube video and they were mocking BJJ and I was scratching my head.
I been laughing every time Paddy the Baddy talks, not because he is funny but because I don't understand shit coming from his mouth.
Paddy is the real deal... 10 marines know it...
I don't really understand what's he is saying. Is it scottish accent?
I love this guy. Genius he tapping into the social media to widen his scope or whatever. Plus he genuinely seems a great human being, which I’ve witness time over time in martial arts disciples. Wish him the very best really.
the day when nobody understood a word of what paddy said
Hey bro, I love seeing you work with our Marines! Our USA troops in General! I'd love to see you keep working with all branches of our combat forces. NAVY, Marines, Air Firce, and Army. You're great bro, and I would have truly wish you had been there to work with us when I was in.  Please keep doing this, it makes our Troops better, and goes to show just how much you care about supporting the military! It's great bro! Win, lose or draw you are truly great! Stay humble and hungry, and do you! Don't end up like Connor did. Where all he cared about was fame, and his own glory. Talk mad trash, and keep being you! Don't let the game change you! Again you're great bro! Keep going.  Oh and those military work outs, it inspires the men you are working with! Believe me it's does! They need that! Keep it going! Last note, knock out that clown you are facing next!
marines! the art of invading foreing countries!
You are a legend!!!
youtube please dont ever reccomend this dave portnoy clown clone
I don't think I respect any group more than the US Marine Corp.  Mad respect for yah.... for sharing your time with some of them. A true celebrity 👌 👏 🙌 😄
Cracking vid' boy     😎
Paddy is an incredible inspiration. What a guy!
What's the song at 5:50?
Very cool video, thanks for sharing Paddy the Baddy and team.
Go & do a marine sesh when yr at yr fattest ! 😆
This guy is humble ..saying sorry that he's fat
🙏Thanks Paddy!🇺🇸❤️🇮🇪
Well done Paddy. Biden should have been there too for a little training with you. It would have been the only thing he wouldn't forget in 60 minutes.
Alright that was good but now slap a rifle on paddy and get him kickin in doors with the boys haha.
Paddy....Big respect mate...!
word on the street, not a single one understood a word that paddy said.
Great Irishman
Wow super nice guy! His attitude is already a winner. I like him.
Let's go with Islam or Khabib
Well they are trained to kill and not necessarily grapple but that man is an absolute beast.
A QUALITY MAN! So much more than an MMA fighter.
It should be paddy the gladdy. I had a big smile on my face watching this. You’re a good sport mate.
“I’m sorry I’m so fat” omg lol
Next Station syria or ukraine
It help a lot in Afghanistan lol
I get it but a military man has buddies knives  guns grenades air strikes,NO time wrestle .buddy
Too bad he will never be Conor no matter how big of a D he is
Paddy the only man to apologize for being fat 😂
that mentality man. thats how i feel everyday. i can beat the world. people gravitate to you because you are that way. never loose it.
Paddy went thru all those marines, they need to do a better job training soldiers on hand to hand combat cause paddy isn’t even breathing hard.
a great mental health speaker, just says it as it is.
badddddddyyy ur a goat
Drink when Paddy swears
Why does he constantly call himself fat?
Good job the enemy never carries knives.
I understand 75% of what he’s saying even though he is speaking English lol
Paddy is an awesome addition to the world of MMA.  He’s fun, remarkably skilled and doesn’t seem to take any of it too seriously.
awsome, Paddy thumbs up for being real!
PTB +BJJ = OP
Puddy, you re an inspirational and cool guy, thanks for this video 🙂🍻🍀
I like him better then Connor 😂 much less toxic of a person
Thanks mate I'll get stuff  of my chest as have been in bad  way since 2017. Cheers Avagud1
Don't really hear that scouse out in the wild much, Love to hear it! Keep up the good vibes Paddy, you're awesome!
This looks fun
Now the judges are gifting you wins?  Must feel like a real winner
Great job Paddy!  Although it's kinda good to see that someone or something can kick your ass.... The US Marine Corps.
There is Greatness in that room.  Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your courage, determination and perseverance.  When others doubt you, the people of America will never abandoned you.
2:22 song anyone?
The Q&A section warmed my heart. These were Marines asking questions about his support system, how to achieve their dreams and self esteem. I expected questions about technique and combat, not mental health. ❤
Id love to see him and tim kennedy go at it...
He's a cool dude.  No pretentious nonsense.
UFC is fixing fights
Wow this fella should try mma
Wahoo Paddy! Awesome to see mang! And a fun workout near the beach with some good men. Thanks
Who was the interpreter? lol
That was awesome
Cool, Cool, fucking Cool!
Awesome for Paddy taking the time to do this! What’s great dude.  Also the Marines weren’t doing themselves any favors by wearing socks and pants - having skin on the mat makes things a lot “grippier”.  Paddy still wins, just sayin’.
What a gent and those marines gents as well!
All these liver pool scousers are loud mouth dudes that'll never be the best. FACTS. Paddy's career is finished 🙌🏽
When I look up Douche in the dictionary I see Paddy’s face… if you lose a fight just be humble and admit it… you will never be Conor, your career is done Paddy the Crappy… Jared Gordon beat you, just ask the world
Paddy's career is finished! Hahaha 😆
So if u fighting marrines go grapling wressstling skills :p
Lol that missed handshake when he was given the coin.
I was in the Marines back in the seventies. Today's Marines are weak. My son did two Afghanistan tours and what he said they were doing over was weakness to the highest level.
"as I say, Sorry im so fat lad" hahaha
That was uplifting and motivating glade some of our troops got to have a day like that appreciate the service to all that serve ! 🫡
So basically the marines need to have an MMA fighter train them too if they get that they are truly unstoppable!
“I have to say… sorry I’m so fat lad”🤣🤣🤣 he’s the goat
Bisping, great competitor and commentator. McGregor, great promoter. THis guy? Just the best for the sport. Fights, wrestles, respects, has charisma.
I don't really follow MMA but have seen a few of Paddy's fights. After watching this video, I definitely gained a lot of respect for the man and also had this thought; seeing someone like Paddy in public, I wouldn't imagine that they would be one of the most lethal humans on the planet so, practice de-escalation in real-life confrontations because you never know if the other person could completely destroy you.
never doubting this mans stamina ever again
It was all fun and games for the Jarheads until he played his own game: paddy cake Much respect the Baddy ...and to this platoon for defending America!
So funny the bit at the end with the ammo box. He's so appreciated.
Murica can't dominate an expert Scousa! 💪✌
Thank you for your mental help advice will always remember it  👍
07:21 number 9 must be almost halfway to blue belt by now 😂 man looks addicted already
Thought Paddy was just a cocky scouser (which he is) but after watching loads of his videos he really is a sound guy. Respect.
Are the Marines all figgy too now? or is that just Milliys dog mask army?
He is the real thing. God blessing to you.
That was awesome!!!
Socks bruh
Just wait until they here that he’s a socialist. Love Paddy!! Class act.
Dude is an anaconda!
Paddy is so seexxxy 🤤🤤😍 the things I could do to him 😂😂 lol
GOOD JOB keeping up and showing out! You should do this again and while wearing fatigues and boots, it's a game changer. Awesome video! I'm cheerin for you bruv!
3:00 that chick wussed out right away... equality...
men being men. lovely. great video.
Paddy is just awesome. Our young men need more guys like him to look up too. This video will be shared with my son who is a high school wrestler.  Lot's of good stuff in this video.
"what you learn today marines?" "Nothing, who can fucking understand that guy"
Out Standing!
Paddy keeping 💯 as always ! Can't beat that!  Go Paddy & Go Marine's 🇺🇸 👍
The Ricky Hatton of MMA
Lmfao the guy that said stalemate
Never been a big fan of Paddy, but after watching him with the Devil Dogs, and grappling with them, new respect and a new fan, gonna be watching now!!!
Jared Gordon would've rolled with 11 Marines.
Damn paddy looks like he’s got some weight
0:02
7:21
Shoot I’m tired after like 10 pushups
Ah I had to click on this video for 1 reason. That 1 reason is to unsubscribe. Even my favorite fighters lose fights sometimes but the difference is they aren't so delusional about the results.
I’m glad I watched this on this very day I needed the message
What a great human being. I am a fan.
What an outstanding young man. Big fan of Paddy. A rare and real down to earth individual
That is why when a Marine ‘gets out’ its only paperwork..
That was really good Paddy Thank you for that specially for the heartfelt talk you had at the end❤
Was it just me that saw the prestige emblem from BO2 on the wall
Respect
I hate this dude he's so cocky and not that good of a fighter he lost his last fight even tho the refs are blind and the dudes gonna act like he kicked his ass
felt like i was  supposed to see this video this early before work the QnA and the responses Paddy was able to give whilst not having all the answers himself was amazing very down to earth and very strong mentality
🤣 Good at martial arts….. But didn’t have the sack to join the military.  Lol.  The MARINES are the real warriors.
I think Paddy took it easy on them.
Damn he really is a baddy!
Well i guess I'm jumping on the Paddy Wagon. Dudes a hoot
Just subscribed!  Great video!  Thank you Paddy!!!
Yeah but its pointless... marines are not trained to make their enemy tap... They are trained to kill him ASAP. Paddy will not survive if he was legit enemy. Don't get me wrong, Paddy is legend! very very good, I just don't see the point in this. Maybe someone can enlighten me?
He only know one thing his middle finger
Burger kid !!
I love him.
Song at 11:40 Kawaii - BAER. Look her up she's goated. So sick they chose her as the outro.
Where is the translater?
Jared beat you, paddy. Dana white couldn't let his new Pinocchio lose his first big time exhibition fight. Dance clown
Idk how there's people out there that don't like Paddy. Not in this video. I mean in general (no pun intended). I mean, I'm a 100% misanthrope, and I love this guy! Keep crushing it! And you're well loved here in Boston (no I'm not even Irish, my dad is straight from Italy).
The Marine played off you taking the challenge coin from him completely wrong >.< You're supposed to shake his hand and take it as you retract like you're passing money in a drug deal. :P
Remember this is an HQ Battalion. These are not real fighting Marines, these are POG's (Personnel other then Grunts). If you want to go fight real Marines, take on the MARSOC Regiment Marines.
Hahaha, while hollywood are trying to sell us that their soldiers are all "the punisher" types of men.  Get rekt
Goddamn I love this guy. He’s how I wish the world was.
This is Real marines? Nice toys soliders
Dude rocks I dig his attitude.
why do all the marines keep their socks on???
That was great to watch!
Hmmmmph... I already ran, but this kind of makes me want to do a bit more 🤔
Love it!
Paddy vs mcgregor ? Thoughts?
flipping all those birds, could have sworn i was looking at nathan from angry boy's. even looks a bit like chris lily.
Dude I lost it when he said “sorry lad I’m a fat bastard”😂😂😂
A great video..real show of respect from both paddy and the marines!!
That was awesome Paddy, thank you for that :)
I always said & say the military doesn't train ninjas. Nothing even close. A UFC fighter teaching them makes sense.
What's up with paddy's face
its funny how there are subtitles for the yanks
Can I get one like for every flip he did ?
I love how they censored the word fucked but then didn't even understand that he was saying cuts directly after that @ 0:45
No frills, no bollox just straightforward Paddy with a great message for all!
He's so cool, man
Much respect.paddy hung out on all ten ..and he showed he was a softhearted person. Al while worried he was to heavy and chubby
i did ninjutsu for few years, at the end we alwayes had grappling. after the 3rd person i couldnt even lift my arms, that dude taps out 10 marines afterthat workout probably not in his peak condition.. damn bro
I'm sorry lad I'm so fat hahahaha epic
if you aint sweatin, you aint workin.
Lionel Messi the UFC fighter lol
There's a whole world of difference between his s*** talking and Conor McGregor is Conor McGregor is downright rude and insulting most the time where Patty might be rude and insulting but at least it's funny as hell. I used to think Connor was funny and then I started realizing he just an a******. All that success went to his head and I hope the same thing doesn't happen to Patty and I don't think it will
I just got to say sorry that I'm so fat! I know one thing I sure like this guy he's got a really good attitude even when he's talking s***
Paddy seems like a real genuine good person.
the marine at 2:20
“Sorry I’m a fat bastard” 😂😂😂
Paddy should train with Marines for his next fight! Help soldiers transition to UFC.
Your a proper man man Paddy   KEEP ER LIT R KID   🍀🍀🍀🍀💪💪💪
I have a newfound respect for this Kid Paddy. I can relate to the Crying part and that's all I'll say about that I UNDERSTAND you!
very good one
As a Marine, man they could've done so much better than that garbage ass ammo can cover they told him was a "plaque", lmfaooo
its American marines. they don't get decent training compared to other nations
Why does this man just radiate 2010 levels of online personality? It's great.
I love Paddy. Proper Nice Lad.
Great guy, I do like Paddy.
What song is playing when he’s going up against the marines?
🔥🔥🔥
Wow... I have never heard of you. This video came up in my suggested videos. This is the first video of yours I have ever seen. My mind is blown. To earn the respect of that room makes me re-evaluate my entire life. Pardon me as I pick my jaw up of the floor. I rarely do this, but, Watched to the end, liked, and subscribed... Cheers.
ain't no marine going to do squat in the ring against Paddy, don't flatter yourselves
Dude is a straight weapon
Paddy has to be the most polite but most colorful speaker i've ever heard of
"Best there is the best there was and the best there ever will be" Someones a Bret Hart fan
You're a racist who got handed a win
Great video paddy..loved it..
Great vid, there’s only one tiny issue, I can’t understand a single word paddy says.
Hey... When you Marines are done... Rolling around on the ground with each other, trying to stick your fingers in each other's butts... you should go over to chef Gordon Ramsey show... Learn how to bake your enemy a phucken cake!  Go Army!
Is this video from pre Biden? Did see any of the non binary and tranny soldiers
0:02 mans just copping a feel
Just subscribed to paddy’s channel he’s a down to earth man who has a goal in life to be the best and from what I have seen he’s absolutely amazing at what he does and a strict training program keep at it mate you are class in my eyes mate 👍
Paddy dropping Brett Hearts famous line "the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be."
Fat or not Paddy, the message is there!!!
Sorry I’m so fat lad 😂😂😂
Is that his producer that he keeps flipping the bird? 😂
Found my new favorite warrior
“Anybody can win, I could start a fight with a 14 yo, catch a right hook and be put fast asleep.”  “I don’t think anyone can beat me.“  These too statements are so powerful together. He recognizes the staggeringly unforgiving and impossible to predict nature of a fight, but stares that chaos in the face and says “I will win.” I bet that resonated with the proud and brave men and women of the Marines he had as his audience that day
Paddy with non-legal moves= death
What a great video,..........he is the best!
Khabib training camp  https://youtu.be/JARe2kFWcYk
You know damn well some of the marines got pressed😂😂😂😂
Class act.
When you talk to your mates about things, make sure they're you're actual mates. The wife might not be a good candidate for this --from the data I've seen, wives seem to just lose respect for their man when they open up.
They're just working out...
Paddy was the spokesman we needed, f Mcgreggor
Patty the Fatty gained some weight, eh?
Paddy and these marines are absolute studs of men
You can really see how Paddy uses all of his body against his opponents.
I’m 62 years old retired USAF.. PTSD disability back in 2003 came home.. I’m into physical fitness and Taekwondo at local school holding currently brown belt ranking. I put the same energy into me daily which I dedicated to Military back in those years. I’m fit determined and resonate with this man in that you must believe you can beat anything, or anybody.. and anything is possible…  I’d challenge you Sir, but don’t think you believe my sincerity, or certainly not take this seriously…  “Believe and application of self makes anything possible.”  I’m following Sir, because you Rock!
you KNOW paddys spirit animal is Snorlax lmfao
robbery
I dont like the message
You are true inspiration Paddy. Thank you.
...    lovely   ________________________
This was an absolutely amazing experience for any civilian. This man just earned the respect of a Marine platoon 😎 That in itself is an honor. Hats off to ya Paddy😎
go illia arriba españa matao
Hi proffesser paddy ur so good i love ur moves ! hope to be like u one day ( i just wont have as good hair !!!!!)
Did they even understand him?
All the luck in the world to Paddy (not that he needs it) truly inspirational..
Paddy vs seals?
What a bad ass 😂 just strangling marines left, right and centre lol
So glad I'm English because the Americans are absolute space cadets got folded like a deck chair every single one couldn't fight sleep.. big up paddy you legend 👏
Such a great guy man
Ya know. at first i didn't like paddy. i thought he was a showboating goof. The more i see about him the more he seems like a pretty cool dude. keep it up dude!
"I just have to say sorry, I'm so fat man" 😂
He's a bit out of shape and fat during the exercises.  But grappling the guy is a master.
Wow, this was just awesome
No excuses just results
U need captions for everything, can't understand a word you or she says
Did you pay these marines for being in your video?
paddy seems like he is a good dude and not egotistical like some fighters
paddy the baddy is just a chubby philza Minecraft but instead of video games he punches people for a living
Don’t go against uk soldiers tho😂
"Soddy im so fat" so polite and humble lol
Dude's so funny and likeable
Really cool
M16 bullets 🤣😂🤣😂🤣 its 2022 paddy I don’t think too much m16 ammo is needed anymore
Paddy! Thank you for taking the time to do this. You are one real mf’er and have a heart. Love watching you. Stay vigilant and stay safe mate.
You'll smash him tonight paddy best of luck buddy
Dude is one hell of a machine
was there one of the soldiers that suprised u???
Paddy 10 - 0 in the gulag
Pay me for my comment lad
What a nice guy! No ego. When he retires, he would make an excellent coach. He was so cool with them.
Fucking love this guy
I challenge Paddy to a match. When I win, he must speak proper American English for a month.
he may be the "next conor" but paddy's character is so much purer
Awesome
this guy just makes himself so likable. i hope he continues to do well in the ufc.
Is Paddy really that bad, or is the US navy just full of 💩  Paddy really is that bad 🔥
IMPOSSIBLE to not love this guy. Hadn’t he already been making billions clobbering MMA opponents, he’d have made an exceptional SOF operator. S/F
Paddies got the off season roid face. Crazy how much drug use is in the ufc again.
The amount of times he apologized for being fat
While I think Patty is amazing at fighting in the ring, I think this would be a great type of training to add to his training regimen.  I was always told by my trainer that if it hurts, then the training is working.  And to always try new ways of training.
Pure class. More military vets and men in general need to cry, talk, speak up... And listen to each other. Thanks for putting yourself through it all, glad you're here, keep going.
Paddy at 9th crime
THE FASTEST PUNCH N THE WORLD https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Pn0otVV6Uk&t=3s
I'd love sparring with this lad as well! I enjoy his work.
Making USA look real badass
You never want to try doing a ground game in a biker bar, because you will be thumped by every biker in the bar and everyone who's tried it, has ended up in a real bad way and I'll leave it at that, bikers all have each other's back, it's a brotherhood and we don't tolerate anybody who gets out of line, in any type of situation!
fantastic vid lad
Always makes me shake my head when I see vids where sports fighters pit themselves against different military trained killers. They are at such a disadvantage because they are trained to kill not submit so it's basically like the farce of having an mma fighter having a boxing match and not being able to utilize half his skills.
lol
women have ZERO PLACE IN OUR MILITARY ACTION SPACE.
Maschine der Typ ❤
Really wasn't a big fan of paddy's personality before this video.... now I hope all his dreams become a reality.
Paddy the Legend.
You may have saved a life Paddy!
Beyond the usual showmanship, this video shows that even if you can take on 10 marines it can take even more courage to open up and seek help.
He definitely earns the nickname Baddy, and those others are some bad mamma jammas. much respect to them all ant to Paddy for highlighting the importance of mental health
Dude tapped out 10 marines
I'm surprised the military isn't adapting more Jui Jitsu fighting techniques. There is a far darker side to MMA, where a lot of the techniques used could very well be lethal if the fights weren't held inside a ring with a ref, and in real combat if it came down to hand to hand fighting a lot of these techniques would be really valuable.
Gotta love him
paddy is legit Bob from Tekken
Looks like someone from a beano comic, taps 10 marines. Beast
Why do they not know how to wrestle lol
I love what you said to our guys and gal. You're super, keep going! 😊
This is so dope man, love this generation of content creation 🔥
use this as part of your daily routine
You can’t wear socks to grapple. CRAZY disadvantage
Now go up against the Rock
So they absolutely drained paddy then said tap out 10 fit tough guys lol
🤣🤣 Awesome job Paddy!!!
Bro he a legend
Great vidoe but what the heck is with the editing. Shots of Paddy vs the Marines area like 1 second long and you can't get a good look or appreciate any of the technique because it cuts to the next shot
Much respect for him taking the time to share a bit with the Marines.  He has a great career ahead of him.
The more I learn about the dude the more I like him. Cool bloke.
Man I just found out about Paddy and I’m a big fan already
Great to see such a sportsman and a character -a true advocate for success, not frightened to talk about his own dark times and how he learned to rise above them. Tons of respect for Paddy, and clear to see he had the respect of those Marines too!
Love the fact you stole Brett Hart’s catchphrase “ the best there is the best there was and the best there will ever be” and watching you do mat drills with I bet the we’re like now we know for sure why he’s called paddy the baddy😂
I sub'd; You r bad ass with a heart and KUDOS to our Marines. Great video!!!!
I'd like to see a cage match brawl with Paddy, Bisping, and McGreggor fighting an audience of zombies. Bonus points for the one that gets the Rogan zombie.
cool
Wouldn’t being barefoot be a significant advantage over all the marines who have socks on?
This is badass AF!
He made the Marines retarded when he started using metric weight units, lol
Paddy is a goat, I wonder if he knows how much mental health is a huge problem in the military. Going there and talking to a bunch of marines about mental health is just insane ( in a good way) love the fact how he talked about his past and talked about SPEAKING UP and telling someone what your going through and how that helped get the weights off his shoulder, also paddy your welcomed in hawaii (mcbh)🤙🏼
next video ...rugby players!!! yheaaaaa hello from Spain!!!
Very cool 😎
He lost like 20 pounds in this Video. Hahahah
Seems like a cool ass dude. Would love the chance to wrestle someone like this.
“It’s just your typical 5.56”  “Sick…” *no idea what the fuck that is but ok*
https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxXweqQrtQVoW0Dz-qUAsn97QfDAEvFExZ - Paddy Wrestling
Great vid, man! Please write a book at some point. Many of US would benefit from your insight into mental health and maintaining a persistent attitude.
Thank you for doing that. It meant so much to those Marines. Awesome. GO Navy!!
Always loved watching Royce Gracie... going to have to start watching Paddy now... this looked exhausting but fun... big shout out to all the Marines who participated too...
I hope Paddy does really well and goes far.  So humble underneath his showmanship.  He's the opposite of that Gob-Shite McGregor.
One of those people that have just discovered Paddy .I can also confess to bad places self harm and all the trimmings i went to get help and its true talking is the way forward . I had subbed to his channel and i wish him all the best he makes me laugh and his skills are frightening .
legend
I don't understand any of Paddy's word but he's cool for sure.
This Lad does "keeping it real" look tinyer. "Keeping it Paddy" should be the new frase.
Wow he was right ✅️ it was good 👍
Paddy keeps saying he is fat, maybe he has a few extra lbs than his normal fighting weight, but damn… his conditioning is crazy good. Did the marine workout then went up against 10 fit and experienced marines. That’s spectacular.
Attitude that's the best part about Patty
Thanks Paddy for cheering the Marines up...Your a good man.
He loves that finger!
Paddy, you are a real inspiration for anyone struggling with mental health. It is an issue that needs more exposure, and when you say that if your so-called friend is not supportive they are not you real friend. You are so right. I wish you every success!!!!!!!
My first time knowing of this guy, I love him.  Oorah.
Paddy was supposed to shake his hand along with the coin to pass it on.. Simply just takes it not knowing how this goes 😂😂😂
awesome content.
RESPECT.
Paddy The Beauty
offt impressive af to do this.. but to do it after that workout! well done, new sub and follower of whatever you do next. You will do great things, i feel it.
Україна 🇺🇦 ЗСУ 💪 😎 💙💛
lets hope he is not Paddy the Pattie in the future!
Funniest about Paffy is that he does not look like an MMA fighter to me : he looks like an in shape Boris Jonhson ;) Yet can t deny his grapple abilities
I'm not sure if I'd be considered an athlete but I had some physical jobs I was the professional water skier for ski shows on the west coast and then a Hollywood stuntman for years then I raced a Motocross and BMX and safety diver for the astronauts at Johnson Space Center and I deal with bipolar depression and add some days are really difficult this was a really awesome encouraging video thank you guys always grateful for y'all
I’m new to this channel and Jesus 10-0 against marines, good man Paddy well done for getting through everything you have God bless you 🙏
That was brilliant
Paddy I just found your channel and it was a great inspiration to me, I just came from a dark space in my life and spent some time in a mental health clinic. What you said about speaking to people and friends or family is something I experienced recently and it was a game changer. I am on the mend and hitting the gym, spoke to my coach so back into boxing training, so your attitude and honesty about mental illness encourages me to keep fighting and keep going. Thanks Paddy, awesome video, going to be following this channel closely.!!!!🥊🥊😀
Thank you paddy for the chasing your dreams as a fighter wisdom ✊
Damn like Paddy needs even more fans. Respect.
Stop apologizing Paddy, ya did well, most would have wilted in the heat!
Paddy you are an amazing ambassador of the sport of MMA and an even more amazing person. The interaction with these amazing Marines made me smile ear to ear brother. I am a Canadian Armed Forces veteran and I sorely miss the Camaraderie you were so fortunate to experience with these Marines. Keep Kicking ass big dawg
Ohhhhhh paddy the badddddy💪💪💯
I watch all the ads for u paddy:)
Paddy : Soddy Im Faaaat
ебать зверь!)
this is super impressive
Legends the lot of 'em. Paddy is fucking funny too.
I bet a friend I could get outta one of those leg head lock deals I have no real training just fought a lot he out me in the lock had me pretty good til I grab his ball sack and twisted those fuckers…:he couldn’t kick me off fast enough…man was he pissed but I told him in a street fight it’s ALL game.
If only Jake challenged you to grappling Paddy you would sleep him in seconds
they try to kill him with the workout then he beats 10 marines in a row.. AHAHA bruh paddy is a goat
Hurrah!! You are the man Paddy!
Great video paddy.
He's a good breed
Did Michael Venum Page retire?
SCOUSER!!
He has an eating disorder
Loved it.
Absolute fucking legend Paddy, top man representing out there!!
Would love to see Paddy do a series with different regiments. Get him in with the Royal Marines and Paras
Whats the Song? Don't let me lose my mind? 😬
A navy seal would have had him tap in secs...
I mean, this shows you how they couldn't take Afghanistan haha . The US army is just technology but in the field, they get outclassed by the SAS by miles mate
Yo paddy’s put some fur on bro tf
Paddy just being a genuinely down to earth and relatable guy makes him so much more likeable than the other dudes who play a character. loving it bro.
What a bloke!!
what is the song he used when they were rolling?
Why is paddy so fat now
Part 1: Paddy the middle-finger toting fattie.  Part 2: Paddy the baddie.  Part 3: A real icon getting real and teaching them something more valuable than some BJJ moves.
Hell yeah
Я не понимаю как они его понимают, акцент у него бешеный , ну в принципе  я вообще не очень понимаю по английски но у него вообще тарабарщина
Yespaddy
what a legend is this paddy .I love him
i love your mindset and open art m8!
oh man i wish we had some decent ju jitsu close by
Wow a inspirational lad especially about how he feels and how to be wholesome and true
Ellen DeGeneres has got serious with her grappling
Love this but hate YouTube commercials brake
Defenders of Biden's gay disco.
0:43 did they censor "fucked" but not "cunts"? "Now I'm gonna get fucked up by some marine cunts"
Paddy has became my favourite fighter and know favourite youtuber
Just stumbled on this, I've done martial arts most of my adult life over 40 years and I really must say how impressed I am with you Paddy> Not only are you a brilliant fighter but you are one of the most fantastic human beings I have ever seen. Your character, the way you conduct yourself and your compassion for other people is wonderful. I hope you have a great career but most important a great life. Well impressed and subscribed to your channel
Добрый вечер🌙 👍 Paddy,  такие люди как ты рождаются один раз в тысячу лет, ты даришь людям хорошее настроение, желаю тебе счастья,  всегда побеждать, ты лучший👍💯 боец. Москва Россия😍💍😘👑💕✌❤💯💘
Islam will choke you out mate.
Video title sus af
Now it makes sense that you lose weight so fast.
Paddy does it for sport marines do it for life and death kno the difference
your the Man Paddy,. its crazy people would think a pro athlete is in TOP shape every Day of the year. you mix in fun and Do the WORk so if there even is any haters (hard to imagine)   they can suck a fart out my butt like a Bong Hoot
Cool episode! Even though I didn't understand a word Paddy said.
Class act
Genuinely apologised every time someone had to pick him up:-D :-D :-D
paddy just took down an army..
was a fan. now I'm a HUGE fan after finding your channel
Paddy’s a trained python and on the matter of him mentioning how important mental health is this isn’t the first time Paddy has spoken out for mental health and it makes me feel that he really believes in it. To be venerable but show he can drop bodies is a good stand point for awareness on mental health for men specifically cause I can tell you there are a lot of men out here that will talk you down and tell you to grow a pair or aren’t a man even if you just lost someone close to you and he’s out here absolutely killing it 🖤
Sorry im so fat... 😂 I totally lost it twice when he said that HAHAAHHAHAAH
Man what song was that playing in the beginning. It was a pump up!
Marine number 6 waiting in line: I got this, he is already tire.  Marine number 6 after getting tap: damn dude still can go.
The mental health he gives only works for people that have a good support system. If your like me and don't it doesn't matter if you tell somebody 1000 times. It won't matter if you get help. Nobody is there to care. If your lonely and depressed, you don't have hope.
dude, this whole video makes me think 100 times better of you on top of how great you already are as a person.
Marines are trash
“Sorry lad I’m a fat bastard” 😂😂
What a beast
All his fat goes to his face 😂
hahahahaha he keeps saying hes so fat im dying
Tapped out ten marines .. Whether your the average guy or someone very trained .. Paddy will tap you out .. you need too be superstar level for him .. Unreal how a human being can achieve this gladiator skill .. totally capable of beating 90 percent of the whole planet in unarmed combat .. A real comic book hero!!!!!!
Bjj works, but still very gay though.
That training brings back a lot of memories. When I trained with Marcelo Garcia we used to do some beast mode warm ups before drilling 5 min. I miss that shit every day to be honest--yet when you're doing it all you can think about is getting to the end of it without falling out. This video is inspiring AF!
Killer video.🤘
Paddy is someone I wanna legitimately be friends with. He may be a little crazy but he’s a genuine ass dude too.
I wanna se Ferguson try this. He will outwork 2 plutons in a row lol
sory lad im so fat!!! hahahahhahahahahahhaa
I love watching Paddy, it pumps me up !!!!!!  I guess I'll get my Gracie Combatives dvd set out and do some refresher training now !!!!!  WHILE I EAT, lol !  🤣
Top man and I bet they was all finding it hard with the accent at first. I'm a brummie and I find it hard 🙈,specially when it's deep accent. Once again top man with good advice to the lads and everyone who watched. 👍🏻
I used to hear so much people talk crap about you, but look at them now, inspired by you. Keep grinding bro 💪
I’m going through some hard times recently and I’ve been crying so much and trying to hold it together, to not burden anyone. I never thought I should. I’ve found you entertaining and amazing but until this… I find you inspirational. Thank you
Would love to see Paddy do this in peak shape he is the man! Made it though this 40 over his fighting weight
As aye sayed sodry im seau fet lad. Lmfao xD
Paddy Is one strong muthercracker
every time he gets picked up " ah im sorry lad im such a fat bastard" lmao
Paddy- “sorry lad I’m a fat bastard” 🤣
They should have put him in boots
The last Marine was one of my drill instructors
The truth like if you really won or lost cuz if you really did win then that’s awesome. But if it was edited to just you kicking their ass that’s not seeing the whole fight.
It's hard to believe that such a clean cut dude with the Kid Next Door look could be a total savage.
if it was gender neutral pronoun training those Biden marines would kick ass! LOLL
hes also fighting Joe Biden marines, try that with marines 30 years ago get his ass handed to him
Please show the fight with no editing please. That way we can see the truth.
I just become a huge Fan of Paddy . Incredibile Person god bless you bro . Greetings from Germany 🙏🏼❤️
Shoulda gone to an infantry battalion
nice  bro
Воу ты крут Падди
Damn I teared up watching this. Paddy a real one.
Good video.👍🥋Paddy definitely has world class Jiu-Jitsu skills. Let us all keep in mind that Marine does not equate Jiu-Jitsu.  Grappling is a very tiny, almost insignificant part of Marine Corps training. So of course anyone who dedicates 100% of their their lives to competitive Jiu-Jitsu will (should)  win matches against Marines. That is a Marine Raider unit, imagin if the competition had been stalk and kill the target... Paddy would have lost 10 out of 10.  You can't realistically compare apples and oranges. That being said, Paddy is one hell of a human being, glad he shared his talent and thoughts with these Marines. Semper Fi.
Lewis Capaldi has really let himself go.   Jokes aside, amazing stuff from Paddy.
Love it
Good job paddy🫡 respect
I love your attitude paddy - you speaking about mental health is helping so many people
Would like to see him try army combatives. Maybe with the Gracie that just joined?
If anyone ever wonders why the United States Marines are so BADAZZ...just try doing what those boys do, imagine if they all trained high level Jiujitsu too.  :)
I'm surprised some recruiters didn't walk through the door
Paddy submitting those marines 💥
Love his spirit, his attitude, his wit and he’s just an all around likable guy who could brighten a room full of strangers with those qualities. Kid has a lot of positive energy and vibes. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
That was inspirational, no bullshit
That was great. Appreciate the hospitality and hard work the Marines showed and Paddy being Paddy. Just fun and uplifting
I only watch UFC matches when he is on. He is a an awesome inspiration for anyone in any field. Will probably make a great motivational speaker after his UFC career.
Should’ve put em in a leg lock or ankle lock
Paddy, find Jesus or all the pain you put on people will be returned to you X 100000000000000 in hell by demons!
Pray he becomes Champion one day.
Who else wanted to see touch-butt at the park?
Back to this legendary video love paddy in and out of the cage can't wait for his next fight title fight hope coming soon - Nov 2022
Well to be fair, its kinda hard for anyone to roll when you dont know the first thing about the rules
people trashing on the marines because they dont train jiujitsu, what a joke. See how good your jiujitsu is when you get shot 200m away.
Love this guy!

My pops was a marine difference from todays marines the drill instructors beat the the living crap out of you daily. Very different in the 60’s
What a legend.
I didn't know much about this guy really but watched this and honestly I have respect for him. I'm a veteran albeit an Army veteran but I understand what's going on here and I appreciate the respect he gave those Marines. Obviously, the Marines are a very good fighting force but physically it's very hard to compare to a professional fighter so to see Paddy teach the Marines and do it with class and not trying to humiliate them is very cool.
Watching videos like this makes me wish I was American. Seem like great people.
I used to look down on grapplers until i tried it by myself, having good stamina alone is not enough to counter a grappler, their technique are out of this world. Big respect
paddy is really typical  british man he looks like mr bean and boris johnsonn lol
I was loving this video and Paddy enough as it was, But when he quoted Bret The Hitman Hart. He won me over.
That shi* was lit!!!!💣
I like this guy. Seems really down to earth
He definitely needs to visit Dagestan) it's wrestling Olimp. Wrestling is the Religion there.
Paddy is impressive and all but the bar for marines has fallen through the floor in the last 20 years.
Incredible video Paddy, respect for taking on Marines, you the man 🙌
Superstar paddy.
👍You're a good man Patty 👍😎
Yo dude!! I feel sorry for Logan paul 😂… Logan fell for the Joker Card
Mad respect for our Marines.
“I just have to say, sorry I’m so fat lad” 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I mean…it was just a coms battalion. So I’ll give him 5-0 since they aren’t grunts
I need  subtitles. I basically don't understand anything
If they threw hands....
i was born there
This video showed China/Russia/Iran who the Marines/USA secret weapon is.
Great video! great content!
Mann you seem like the nicest guy on earth got so many laughs out of it
Let me start out by saying Paddy is a beast! No one can take that away from him.  The big take-away from this is the importance of cross-discipline training. As a U.S. Marine, we are taught how to kill with maximum efficiency on the battlefield with boots, utility gear, a rifle, and full combat load, while applying KISS because we do not train consistently for 8-16 hours per week like a typical Judoka. The techniques must be deadly, but also simple enough to allow for less training and fog-of-war.    As a Jujitsu and Judo instructor, our 'waza' (techniques) are equally deadly/effective, but lack the violence, intensity and modern combat application. Rolling around on the battlefield for 5 minutes will get you killed by his buddy. Likewise, boot-stomping someone in the ally for trying to take your wallet will still end with you behind bars. Everyone is better off when we humble ourselves and seek out techniques that other disciplines have to offer.  ~ Semper Fi
Paddy is a great human.
That was great!,🔥
How can anyone not love paddy dude is real as it comes and truly a nice guy
Man I love his humor❤️
Khabib would show him the real power of wrestling
Respect.
The man is class. One hell of a fighter inside the octagon and in life. I can't wait to see him with the belt around his waist. I'm certain that day is on its way 👌
Elite.  😂 Not to embarrass,   Top ten vs1. See what you are stepping In.
good man great laugh positive good on ya paddy
There is no struggle on any marines face?
Imagine if all marines had to go thru training for that. They would be even more dangerous
Nah this man the goat 🐐
eww that must have been a really gay time. i mean happy of course. thumbnail give ya away but dont lie, u were on the bottom.
Absolutely blown away by this. Amazing Paddy.
He would have a food stain on his shirt 😂
Now next: against 10 marines in a gun fight 💀
Dude you’re inspirational.
They put him against raiders💀 that’s why they’re buffer then your average E3-E4
31 sj
scouser destroys US marines 10-0
Unbelievable how bad the marines are I am really surprise they got all beaten by this guy 😢
❤️🌟
This is awesome in every way
Wow, lol. Great stuff
Watched this guy grow up....into an absolute beast
i've just realised chubby blonde scousers could reel in americans claiming to be paddy in his off season.
khabib nurmagomedov  2  😂😂😍😍😍😍😍  Paddy the Baddy
2:21 What's that background music/song called, captain?
Paddy is the most attractive guy ever imo. He is way too authentic, and more impressice each time I see him. Then him advocating for mental health. 😩🥺
'i'm sorry i'm so fat' killed me xD Paddy is naturally funny
This is literally the first day I heard about Paddy. This Is I think the 3rd video I watched and to see him talk so openly about mental health is SO GOOD.  Watch this video but especially watch the q&a section.    Respect Paddy the Baddy
Sick video!
"stalemate" nah hes getting his breath back so he can arm bar you. paddy looked at him like you've got the cheek ur the one in the triangle 🤣🤣
Paddy did all this before cutting weight, then he says "sorry lad I'm a fat bastard" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I loved training with marines. Truly an impact driving kind of training regiment
Paddy the baddy dropped some good knowledge on those devildogs!
1:21 🤣
Those Americans have a funny accent...
Love ya mate, you are bringing martial arts to people without hiding your weaknesses
Paddy’s new way to weight cut 🤣🤣
Why isn’t this guy a national celebrity ,he is amazing
i like him !! He is a Boy like us . I wish him all the best!!!!
His reactions and sarcasm is very funny 😂
Imagine khabib level
all that cost was half a pack of Crayola ......  RESPECT to Paddy 4 this
This was sick. Paddy always keepin it real
Good man Paddy mate!!!
that should adds up to his wins records lol
What a good bloke
Gotta love that bastard. Nit sure why i didn't initially
He is the next champ in UFC !
Paddy is so in the zone and comfortable in the wrastle he looked like he was driving a Manual car on the second guy he tapped lol
Thanks Marines for your service to our country 🙏
He's like I do this everyday. This was supposed to be a day off
I bet this was a humbling experience for the Marines lol nothing like getting tapped out by someone using less than 50% of their effort
sorry I'm so fat la...lol
The Mexican Marines or the ones who beg for Boorbank baroh lmfao totally not asking “The Clones are cumming” 🤖 🇺🇸 🏙 🌃 🌆 ya’ll cummded that’s not even an actual super saiyan ya’ll swear you guys ranked up through him #DamnShames where is this country going again? #StopBeingArticlesOfConfederation that’s why ya’ll have to say valhalla and 💩 sincerely, Mine and Only Mine…
Hi Mr , need subtituled spanish pleade , u are idol
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏 Santo Dios Lo admiro más ahora  Mis respetos
Your Fucking Awesome. I came across some videos of you but this is tops... keep kicking ass.
UK 10 USA 0 😂😂😂
Jk saragi teacer...thank im from indonesia
This was fukn awesome
That was EPIC Lad!!!!!
How could someone not love Paddy the baddy. Awesome lad
Paddys a beast I wanna see more fights. he's getting going up in weight classes too he's gonna be huge after the cut
Keep shining light on the dark places Paddy good on ya mate. May God continue to bless you.
paddy the great-y - word
Fat or not Paddy lives up to that name! 💯
As a marine I can tell you we are a JOKE and not impressive that he did this.
Paddy is in fact one hell of a fucking baddy.
Paddy the best action
Idk how someone can be so cocky and down to earth at the same time but paddy can, respect 🫡🫡🫡🇺🇸🇬🇧
Why is it always the fucking pogs that get all the cool shit and there always the ones to meet famous people when it should be the infantrymen and riflemen because there the damn backbone of the military 🫡🫡🫡🫡🇺🇸
That montage of him tapping everyone was cold 🥶
49 seconds in “Marines Cunts” 😂 shows how important tonality is vs vocabulary. Love this Brit
Should have a go at the UK sas they're trained better anyway ;) ...trigger warning
I stopped liking this guy when he "teabagged" after that fight....
Paddy a good lad.
Not exactly a fair game though none of them are adequately trained on bjj and they're specifically fighting bjj style.
Just like a fucking annaconda cold grapler machine
Paddy gives every fat bastard hope.
Least this give me hope our marines aren't weak, wish I could say the same for the army...
I love this guy!
Very humble and down to earth, both Paddy and the marines.
your a weapon!
How is all of that little body fat that paddy has in his face 😂😂❤
He took down a bunch of bigger guys that refused to give up, at first...
Lad said even Francis ngannou can't beat him... you're warrior paddy, self confidence
Socks on the mat probably didn't help. Wonder why they didn't strip down to skivs to match Paddy.
Yo Paddy you want to join the Marines? We can get you citizenship if you need it..
*Whether you love em or hate em, Paddy's a fucking beast with a true warrior's spirit and he will go places in the industry if he keeps doing what he's doing. He's the most polarizing and charismatic character in the UFC and that combined with his immense skill and big heart will push him to the top of not just the UFC, but the MMA world as a whole.*
That's wicked!
Well said Paddy.
Paddy vs basically 10 super spazzy, white belts. I became a fan just because of how he subs them all 😂
Try the British marines paddy or do you know they will beat you?
don't mess with a scouser lol
Dope
This man got me into therapy for PTSD with one speech I needed to see and hear for 30 yrs, and probably saved my life.   It was the sincerity, the urgency, the brotherly love and the fact it was so opposite of that misandrist, harmful razor ad.  Paddy the Baddy fan for life man.
Zero tattoos, 100% power and respect
This guy's great. I'm now a fan
The more & more I watch his videos the more I want to subscribe to his channel so I did. Paddy Pimblett is a good dude.
That was awesome!
Shit was a fire outro, “like, comment, subscribe, OORAH…what they said.”😂😂
You are really helping men Paddy, its a tough time for many of us, keep it up
I like how Paddy emphasizes mental health.  You need a strong body and mind for everything.  Simply passing off emotions as weak and not getting help and feeling alone is only going to ruin your focus and your performance everywhere.    Mental health is severely underestimated because there’s no escape sometimes, it’s always beating you down until you get help
paddy speaking out for mens mental health is awesome love you paddy!!!
Keeps this going. He’s redefining masculinity. Let’s get rid of this toxic crap.
7 mil damn
A professional MMA fighter speaking to a group of marines about breaking down and crying and why mental health is important. What a wonderful way to break down stereotypes surrounding what supposedly constitutes manhood. So real. Love this lad. Been following him for quite a while now and he just keeps growing. A wonderful example.
Sorry I'm so fat🤣🤣
Thank you Paddy, for working with our Marines!
He’s a great guy who isn’t afraid to share his feelings… That’s a rare quality
Come to graf Germany and train with some members of the army. Bet I can make you tap  Also I’m a huge fan
Nah ur different
It takes a weighty pair to go train with marines, bigger yet to roll out 10 of them,  but it takes monstrous, gigantic bollox to sit there and talk about feelings with some of the hardest men on the planet. Well done Pad.
Paddy The Baddy!!
So humble and a great human being thank you Paddy for who you are.
Levels too it
You don't know who's Paddy pov: Marine training: who's this clown lol Bjj: wtf
This dude deserves to eat whatever tf he wants
Wish he'd stop apologising for his weight. He had down time, its allowed. If he wants to or needs to he can lose it.  Paddy's a wee star!
Insane
impressive stamina and great attitude.
Marines need to learn Leg locks
What a badass Paddy.
Top bloke for sure!
Him apologizing for being fat is so hilarious 😂
Non of them have a clue what hes fucking saying 🤣🤣🤣
This guy is cool af
we're just men. Just innocent men..
I just got introduced to Paddy.  Cool dude and the Marines were cool as well.  They really put their fighter at risk, of getting injured, here though.
7:34 what is that move called?
"sorry lad, i'm a fat bastard"
Watching this makes me wonder if bakihanama is really that far from the truth
I think we know why Russian Army is such a failed joke!!   Russian Generals ..Boy Toy ran away!!   Have pity on that poor kid!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNrHoGi4E6w
I love me some paddy!
Sorry lad.. im a fat bast*rd
Humble guy and hes unreal when it comes to fitness. Respect to the marines also.
THATS CAUSE HES THE GOAT THE GOAT
Kinda unfair they in socks
Irish...
That was great. Nice content
Paddy will be UFC champ soon soon.
😉👌
Thank you paddy man your an actual legend ❤
Похож на долбаеба если честно
Paddy goes up against some of the instructors
This would be decent if he didn’t flick off the camera like a 13 year old girl just sayin.😂👌🏽💯
When the marines went back to their lockers ... they were all empty. Scoucers.
Having Marines asking him about mental health and how to deal with it made me cry. We might be alright after all...
when i went to basic training for the army i was kinda shook to see how many people had no martial arts experience. i mean i didnt have much a little muay thai and a little bjj but compared to people with none i felt like a beast lol
if guys just want to rub against each other they can do it in their own time ;)__
Everytime paddy gets picked up the I have to say sorry I'm fat all I can think is this man has plates of steel for muscle under that fat layer don't play with us🤣🤣
Was good until the Q & A cringe fest. Surprised they did not all start singing you’ll never walk alone. Boohoo 😭
Paddy you're a legend. Not many people can train with the marines - that takes a real athlete. Fewer can beat ten in a row without a break - that takes a real fighter. Fewer still can do it without making them look stupid - that takes a legend.
Paddy is the most down to earth person I’ve seen in a long while… I trained in systemma in college absolutely the hardest class I had to pass but it taught me that no matter the challenge I have the power to over come any challenge that is ever presented to me…
To me it looks like he can’t keep up with the exercises - WTF ? 😂🤣
10:48 typically when a coin is presented, it is usually taken by shaking the hand of the person presenting it and taking the coin at the same time (like how you would pass a bribe to someone). Watching Paddy just take the coin off the Marine's hands without knowing it was hilarious haha. But Paddy is a beast nonetheless
A US Marine once asked a British Marine what RM stands for? He replied "Real Marine".
That's insane this guy can get down to 155. Im 5'10" as well but stay down near 135 with 5-6% body fat. I feel like I have better abs but it's hard to tell without seeing below the waist line for a 12 pack.
They was being nice to the star
I fuckin love this dude! You're an absolute legend Paddy and keep being not only an amazing fighter, but an amazing human being as well! Wish all the best to you and anyone around you brother 🙏
F@#K imagine this bloke in the special forces....he would destroy all opposition...F@#K ME DEAD MATE.
What’s the song at 5:55 ?
Paddy is fucking BAD!
i need subtitles I can't understand shit he's saying
Lol saying sorry for being a fat bastard. Lol.    The good times.
You're a proper class operator Paddy.  Congratulations and good luck in the future. Even the Mancs are cheering for you🤣🇬🇧
Next video Daddy vs 10 marines, m4 vs BJJ.
Cahir McElroy
You beat all militeri guys you so good haha amazing (lad) thats the new word that i learn from you
PADDY THE PIG 🐷
Brilliant 😀
"You can't think anyone's gonna beat ya." No one's talking about this and I think it's just as important as his valuable advice on mental health.
Well done lad
Interesting content
Damn you’re a proper champion of a human being.  Struggling with the old mental health myself and it’s good to see people like you exist.  Might be too late for me but many will be saved thanks to the likes of you.
i guess that marines don't know ju-jitsu?
Why on earth does he flip off the camera like 28 times ?
Hello paddy soy de Perú my mame is Carlos, you are the best
I'm sure they were a little humbled that day lol
SGT Marsh👀👀👀
Nice one Paddy lad. Full credit to you for the workout and grappling session with those guys that must have been killer. Keep up the fight with the mental health awareness too you're doing a great job.
Bro is the origin of the myth you have to register your hands as a weapon...
😆I love this guy's vibe
What a legend
Paddy is actually a pretty big dude! Compared to those guys, he's big.
I don’t understand anything he says
The real baby face assassin
Норм так медийку он раскачал свою! Привет из России 🇷🇺
Пожалуй я тоже подпишусь! Самый настоящий англичанин отвечаю
I have seen your video about men mask culture ,, that was touching
Are you still fighting ???
When he’s in camp he’s paddy the baddy. When he’s not in camp he’s Patrick the fat pr*ck
Would be more realistic if he took on 10 USMC Mcmat instructors or even no offense intended here , at least infantry instead of 9th communications Batallion.
To win 10 tap outs is insane, you'd be wrecked after 5 of them alone.. let alone after the PT session..... absolute admiration!!!!
So in short, MCMAP doesn't work 🥴
Did the US marines actually understand a fucking word paddy said 🤣🤣🤣

Whoever chose this wack music for this video should be fired and 🚫 from the internet forever. Ruined this video.
You'd surely back one marine to beat ten Paddy Pimbletts in a marksmanship contest tho
This video is next level - first, it shows physical endurance second it shows mental resilience- third it shows humbleness and finally it shows mutual respect ✊  Paddy you’re a solid guy - if I ever bump into you I am saying please can I have a picture 😊
Quality stuff from Paddy the Baddy
Love to see it! Paddy gets pushed to his limits and he’s still willing to spit truth and spread light!❤️💯
I died when he said I just have to sat I'm sorry I'm so fat
2:31 the face of regret
Jiujitsu names are so boring. Triangle choke should be called sniff my balls.
BJJ was probably invented for rape.
Yo that second guy wasnt even being choked and he tapped, what was that about lol
This is like when Yuichiro took down the US military in Baki.
GO ON LADDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD!!!!
This guys class just needs to lose molly and he will be bigger than mcgregor
Where is the translator, or at least subtitles?
bojo
Cringe
9:55 look at Paddy stealing quotes from his older brother.
Phatty is awesome
This may be the gayest thing on YouTube.
Min 7:21 WTF?😂😂
He's like the Tyson Fury of UFC. Down to Earth, humble, real. Bleady legend.
Marines are not Invincible gods
Marines are complete for what they are doing Paddy this training whole time. But its cool anyway only constat score
Boots on the friggin mat?
Hell, the marines do yoga now!
Marines are badass!
best porn I've seen, night sorted, thanks
Not into mma it’s boxing for me , but I think paddy is a great guy , and good for the sport , great video
Amazing qualities that PTB displayed as he worked with America's Finest - His ability to humbly talk & share with those men, his transparency to share his beliefs about what is most important to him - family, friends/team, and his very profound understanding of his BJJ and his cool head & demeanor. Great clip!!
Just a suggestion: Subtitles.
Paddy with Stifler from american pae. Jaja nice
😎☝🇷🇺💪
Paddy you’re the man
Die Kameraführung ist eine Katastrophe
Absolute legend paddy 💪🏼
Paddy you are the best!!!
Sick bastard :D Love the attitude :)
german not british
Imagine khabib vs 1000 marines... not even close
Winston Churchill "We will never surrender". Paddy "I don't give a fuck how big you are, what you look like or if you've got seven arms, I'll fucking beat ya".
got a top partner if you ask me
This guy is a fucking legend and he is only just getting started ! Scares me
how can you not be a fan of this guy.
Paddy the legend
Sorry I’m so fat lad🤣
Man his jiu jitsu is so good
I didnt realise Paddy was a scouser
Paddy is the best fighter, and an even better human being.
I did not understand a word he said. But I understood his skills
"I'm like 167 lbs." Paddy: yeah whatever dude..
That was awesome.  It's taken me some time to warm up to paddy the baddy, but this video really shows what a great person he is. Much respect.
Great video thankyou for that 👌
Paddy really is an amazing man. He's just so likable. 👍
You're amazing
sick video amazing people. every one gets down it sucks but we need to pass it and get it off our shoulders and off are chest asap. Change something do something feel better some way shape or form that's the main focus. Also for everyone that don't believe in your self or feel down about your self. Just think about how honestly decent your life is compare to some of the stuff people have to go threw. Just realize how good it is to be able to walk and if you cant walk, How lucky you are to hear or talk. just never put your self down thats a huge step to feeling better.
The man literally said he had an intense training session before the marines event and 2 sparrings, then he did the entire marine routine AND defeated 10 marines? What are you made of Paddy?! Determination and skill at its finest!!!!
Feels like he's gonna earn more in YouTube than ufc
I am a diehard fan of our US Marines and a diehard fan of Paddy Pimblett These are the type of men our teenage kids need to look up to , not the woke freaks with their made-up pronouns and CRT

Damn bro. I got so much love for you appreciating our service men and woman 🙏🏻 and mental health is a big deal guys.  Don’t be afraid to talk to someone. It’s true. You’ll wake up like a huge weight is lifted off your shoulders.  Trust me 🙏🏻👌💪🏻
What a cool guy! The Marines were such good sports about it too though, no doubt, considerably unprepared to spar with Paddy The Baddy!

He is carbohydrate cycling  very smart
Paddy apologizing for being fat is some of the funniest shit ever
Imagine if he trained like that loads hes murder the ufc ha
Not gonna lie..this video needed subtitles  but I loved every second of the video. Wish this was a series !
Sat here chuckling a little wondering how hard they are having to focus to understand his accent.   But also yeah big props paddy, talking about a difficult topic for us guys, but so relaxed about it, normalising it, this it that makes it easier to talk about 👍
This guy is the best thing to happen to combat sports since Royce Gracie.
Paddy... those weiners at 9th Crime (9th Comm) are famous for being deviant losers. You could have found real Marines just 250 meters up the road...
Amazing Person
Thnx for speaking up for men's mental health issues brother! ❤
Well that was sth!
i think i would die
Why are the Marines rolling with socks on?! Seems like a disadvantage.
As he’s on his back “as I say sorry am so fat lad” ahaha
Hahahahaha you the man bro, you funny as shit😂, and you ain't fat bro, u just powerfull💪
Were these marine raiders? The coin he gave him had the logo on it if I am not mistaken, so all these guys are pretty much badass door kickers, must've been a really sick exchange. Awesome video.
Paddy makes me chuckle every time he's on shoulders. Sorry lad I'm a fat bastard!😂
For Paddy to submit 10 Marines is very impressive to say the least. We're not talking about 10 guys off the street, these are all mentally and physically built to fight.
Fuckin love this!
I can’t find a boxing match between. US military and UK military that the UK doesn’t win. Considering the massive population differences. Something isn’t right.
Pause at 7:21
Paddy, keep yrself in yr own country. You aren't Marine quality.
Respect brother 💪
Gotta love paddy da baddy.
6,6millions views, 666k followers 🤔🤔🤔
UFC fighters are built different man
Shout outs to my brothers and sisters (prior Airforce myself). Shout outs to all who train some sort of Martial Art. Besides the mental health awareness, another highlight is the realization that this "regular" guy who just happened to be put in some serious training over the years was able to tap out 10 marines AND make it look easy. It's motivation that with enough practice, most things (emphasis on most) are attainable for the average person. Shout outs to you Paddy the Baddy. 💪🏿
Fookin Sich!
I’m sorry I’m so fat 😂😂😂
Post fight game paddy will tour the world getting paid just to speak about mental health awareness
Wow, amazing, send greetings to Jeka Saragih. Thank you from BATAM Indonesia.
Navy seals next lad.......
The lil clap at  around 4  minutes made me subscribe
If your child pick Paddy the Baddy as it’s Rollenmodel let him do, he will be able wrestle with 10 Marines at once’s one day 😅👍
Legend
In real life they would throw blows in your face with the elbows and not that pansy bullshit wrestling nonsense. Funk your tap out bullshit. Those marines would f you up if they could punch you in you pretty fat face!
paddy fucking rules
Love this guy! He is a bad ass hands down. No matter where we're from we are all brothers!!!!!!
What song is played at 6:15?
Average marine
Nice paddy can beat a complete army

Great role model for any body but especially to the young kids. Many people could learn from this man's humble approach to life.

Damn, Paddy seriously went through all that workout and then tapped out ten Marines in a row. Paddy the Baddy indeed, he's a real one.
muy bien cono...tienes muchiiiiisimas visualizaciones por algo "tan importante"
What’s this song?
Dude what is that song?
Amazing I love this guy
"I just want to say sorry I'm so fat man"😂
I never underestimate anyone, no matter where they are from or fighting experience.. My sensei taught me that when he chose me to be his Senpai at 15 years old to teach Traditional Matsubayashi Ryu Karate.. He liked that I was always teaching him new stuff from just being me, so we were constantly teaching each other.
That intro to combat conditioning looks like a great workout, is there a video out there somewhere with more detail/excercises?
I seriously did not expect this video to inspire me so much. Paddy really has the warrior spirit
Big respect man.
Not trying to take anything away from you Paddy but they all had socks on when grappling with you, surely that gave you an advantage 🤔🤔🤔
This is CONTENT!  MORE SH** LIKE THIS PLEASE PADDY
paddy reminds me of po in kung foo panda
Every body will love him, very humble kind guy🔥🔥🔥
man i didnt know ed sheeran was such a great fighter
Damn I guess they ain’t that tough in the face of a professional fighter
It's all training....don't matter where you are from or where you work at
Love you pad keep it up lad you deserve all the fame and success of a mcgregor and all the platform as a Tony robins! Keep inspiring cuzzo
When he do jiu jitsu training  I thought he indian 🤣

Shows haw fit he reely is
Cosmo imai

Marines are so soft...
My new fave people in the world are paddy and molly. So real! No egos (outside of the ring lol) love them
Only Getting Around to this 1 paddy 💯✌️
That was fucking badass
Anyone know the name of the songs used in the video?
Love this stuff but I am German and even if I can speak and understand the regular English , this hobbit slang is often too much ❤ so please subtitle 🔥😁

BAKI the grappler in the living flesh
Guy is so likable...
Lovely bunch of blokes and the inspirational, delightful Paddy.
These guys are great but seemed stiff  Paddy is class all around
gotta mention that he can do this whilst weighing in and around 200, imagine what he can do at the end of a camp at peak condition. lads a stud!
This whole video was just AMAZING! From start to finish. Thanks so much for sharing. Hope you have a good life man!
Omg I would want this guy’s ass back in the day
“Sorry Im so fat” paddy 😂 sounding like a GF
This was fun!
https://youtu.be/7Jpy_UcXiq8
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Paddy that was an awesome video buddy, Nice to see that you true to yourself and out there to help others whether it be physical or mentally. 10 marines 10/0 must have been brutal buddy fair play and I bet they were at the top of their physical state.... Would love to see you live in a match.... Paddy you are an Extreme Baddy.
song please? 5:56
THOSE 10 MARINES ARE A DISGRACE!!! REAL TALK......................
Bro imagine if they had a army full of ufc fighters that would be crazy!!
It’s so funny that he keeps apologizing for being fat
Totally different plot than "Elsa Jean vs the USMC"
My homie is in the Marines there he told me bout this aha
First time seeing this. Now I need to train harder
He said ima fat Bastard😂
#4 Gave up full mount probably because he didn't have any offensive options outside of attacking an arm

@7:05 Rubber Guard
Mean machine with a pure heart, Big up Paddy !
You're the bomb dude
I hope Paddy never dies
It's crazy to think 10 marines that have been through training ain't shit against 1 Scouser....
This is insane
Paddy is a MACHINE
Did my dude just drop some Brett the hitman Hart?
NOICE! Paddy has a YT Channel - subbed instantly! Keep going mate!
Paddy the greatest ufc fighter
3:01  "... as i say, im so sorry that im fat... "       you cant do this to me.. i spilled my coffe by laughing hearing this . Stay as you are Paddy :-D
I fucking love this guy man
AMAZiNG!!
Awesomeness workout and speech Paddy
Whoever edited this vid did a great job.
Marines tap out while having a bit of fun, imagine if it were at war.
try that at Parris Island
Love this guy🤘🤘🤘🤘
“Sorry lad, I’m a fat bastard” as his 200 lb ass is being squated by a 167 lb man has me cackling 😂
Paddy’s personality really makes you forget he’s a ufc warrior
Paddy hype tain! I know my man doesnt like the term but only when seeing it from the negative, every legend started as a young lad and got the people hyped. I know this Scouser is gonna give us plenty of great shows in the years to come
Paddy the fatty still a baddy!
that bo Prestige 14 i think in the back 🔥
Paddy the paddy is a real O.G GUY EXCELLENT....
I SAW IT TOO, You know what im talkin about.
Every marine I've met has been just back from boot camp and got arrogant and got they're asses beat. Might have a harder time against the special Olympics wrestlers
That is awesome to have that metal and plaque.. he's really an awesome person
Stalemate? 😂
0:01 lmao what the fuck Marine
Great seeing two I admire, Paddy and the Marines!  Marines PT and BJJ ❤️🤘😎🤘
Paddy is mint
actually legit Workout no joke
That fat guy looks like the UFC fighter "Paddy"
Seeing paddy take down the USAs most elite fighting force is insane lmao
It's interesting how mainstream fighters usually have to find themselves a niche to stay in the media. I likethat Paddy isn't encouraging them to get messed up w/ liquor or smoke. He's not preaching a life in the gym nonstop. He's not preaching religion or politics. It's really easy to appreciate his message & what he's chosen to talk about on his platform. General well-being needs to be maintained when it comes to mental health and he's not scared to talk about feelings. Probably has a great relationship w/ his wife.
He is so quick. So impressive.
These Marines will never forget this. Ik if a guy like Paddy showed to train MCMAP with my unit, every Marine I served with woulda absolutely cherished every moment, & no doubt would've shown the ultimate gratitude & respect & would've soaked up every word & technique he provided. It would be amazing if more athletes did similar events with our nations warriors. The impact they would have on them & the confidence boost would be immense. It's good to see that the Marine Corps hasn't been completely destroyed by the new woke, anti-masculine, progressive liberal agenda yet, is refreshing. It seems that way anyway. I truly hope the Corps continues to hold onto it's traditions & values that it instilled in me 20yrs ago, has been held sacred by every Marine who came b4 me. The Marines have set themselves apart from every other branch for a reason. Semper Fidelis.
My god, every time I finish watching a Paddy video I come away with a massive smile on my face. He puts me in the right frame of mind. What a legend 👍🏻
Monster!!! Talking about some of the best trained people in the world, 10 back to back .. 🔥🔥🔥
lad
“Im a fat bastaad”
This guy, he’s doing YouTube right. Respect
It pays to have a gas tank
This like a side mission on UFC 4
IMPOSSIBLE TO HATE SOMEONE SO GENIUNE
Paddy king! Music name?
Great work champ Love the show 🥊🥊
as gandalf the white would say, this is what conor(saruman) could and should have been you go paddy the baddy!
this man apologized for his weight so much lmfao
I saw your eyes change!
" gotta say sorry I'm so fat.. " 😄
I like how he feels bad when he’s carried 😂
Rumour is between marine 6 and 7 paddy took a shit and continued.
Пади красава бать
Marine corps martial arts is bullshit
Fucking awesome!

Inspiring advocate to love and believe in yourself. And cherish those around you as your base. Love you paddy! God bless!
Get this man a gimbal and more frames, too much movement
did paddy get fat?
That better not be a raider battalion
I love how he keeps apologizing for his weight 🤣
Amazing athlete and amazing person
Love you Paddy, love to see someone so humble, happy and down to earth with no filters. Love your work mate, keep doing what you do best, being yourself.
Because of this administration the military isn't what they used to be.
love this guy, grounded and down to earth, great role model.....go on son
The highest of respect for the Englishman for teaching the men and women that go in first”USMC” how to properly choke someone the Fook out!
Paddy's head is HUGE! Growth hormone maybe? Something ain't rite..
Grosoo mal paddy. Futuro terrible!
Shit fire and save the matches. Paddy got fatty!  Kick they ass paddy..
What a likeable dude
7:20 context
Granted he did a lot better on the ground than I ever seen him do in the cage.. But we got to hold on a minute... Some of those Marines may have been in for a year or 2  And they don't train MCMAP everyday. MCMAP is  Marine Corps Marshall Arts Program.  It's a combination of judo, karate, and jujitsu primarily. Tan, Gray, green, brown, black  Is the order of our belts. If you're an instructor you'll get a red tab on your belt.    He did well and just to have the endurance to go through 10 rounds is tuff.   Honestly I think these Marines failed him because the best part of training is when you bring it in. The instructor will tell you a story about on this day many years ago  how somebody did something amazing. That's the most motivating shit you could fucking ever imagine. When you're dead tired and  you hear about how this man saved somebody's life or gave his own.  As we said in bootcamp every night  Before we hit The rack. " In memory of those who lived a good life, who fought the good fight, Who made the ultimate sacrifice. May we never forget". ---SSGT BAR
paddy using a vpn irl
Just tapped out the whole platoon haha
He just rolled some marines man, paddy is amazing lol
I really love your transparency about your own struggles and that you are an advocate for men’s mental health. People like you are changing the negative stigma associated with men talking about their problems and working through them
Paddy....love you man! Your advice is so inspirational. Looking forward to your next fight. You are gonna be the biggest UFC star ever.  But more importantly you'll inspire people from all over the world to talk and share their problems. And for that I can't thank you enough!
Paddy starring as the new IP Man
This guy is a real mench sweetheart
Judging by this, Jack Carr had better not send James Reece to Liverpool.. Scouser Fi!
Sorry im such a fat bastard lad 🤣🤣🤣 what a savage!!  the world needs more people like paddy
Oooooim a faht bastad lads
Teriblee
Damn. A.erican marines are built like bulls.
Paddy apologizing for being fat all the time is so funny xD
There YouTube since the day of silence 9/11 this has been in my recommendation even after not wanting to see it, now stop this shit
Paddy works out here like me, especially the "I'm so sorry I'm a fat bastard"... but my god when he starts rolling, he's a beast!!
I am a fan he really is a likable top lad.   After watching those 10 fight fights from the perspective of not at all a ju-jitsu expert. To me the first thing I saw if I wanted learn. You could see the difference seemed to be how Paddy was using his legs more for control while the marines seemed to be very focused on just their arms, I guess he was probably taking their legs out of the game as well.  I suppose a bit like how beginner Rock climbers tend to think it's all arms and yet at high level you actually maybe get more out of leg strength and flexibility to get that kick up the wall from a tight spot out of reach. In speed climbing they practically jump but the wall.
Insane jiujitsu
How do they even understand him?
McMap is bullshit
You can tell they were all going easy. Just a good time roll session. Near the 7th or 8th guy paddy was really digging deep into his conditioning training 😂
Paddy might actually get USA chants now
These are reg Marines, try that with Recon 😂
Boris would be proud
sooo funny
Since Paddy is a Socialist then he got first-hand experience in the life of a socialist environment. LOL.... Marines have fun together and they also suffer together.
you just cant hate him. Paddy is one of those people who believes hes the best but is so humble and down to earth at the same time. I've never been into mma or any fighting sport other than watching a few boxing matches every now and again but this man and his attitude to life has not only brought me but a very large audience a new interest in the sport and culture around it.
That was a great video. I’m going to start training jiu jitsu soon
Baddy ur motivated me thank you
Watt a great guy gives off such good positive information
Man's going to be bigger than Connor, facts.
He is a certified beast he can achieve great thing if he stays focused enough and works hard much respect paddy
This man is a true, Hero who can inspire change..
crazy he beat the last guy after wrestling 9 guys and that last guy had the longest to recover...
Obviously this isn’t training I’d do if I still played rugby or for my weight lifting now, but damn, having some of these drills be muscle memory could be life saving in a life or death situation.
Is dana paying youtube to promote his videos ? Damn how does he have so many views ? It's a huge amount for a fighter I think. He cool tho
really good men
now 10 seals
THE 1 AND ONLY PADDY THE BADDY
Watching all the lunges made me tired
Looks like paddy lost his weight within one workout session 😅
Then you stand in front of Fedor and realized you done fucked up 🤣 Good attitude to have bro, that's how I have always gone into everything no matter what the competition.
Paddy is a genuine good dude. Good shit man..
I subscribed after watching this. Good sh!t Paddy🙌Even bigger fan now.
I know he works out for the ufc but looked like he was struggling but when he got to the jiu-jitsu part you can tell he was in he's element
What is the snog called please I would love to go do gym work to that music thanks
Very bad ideas for the marines to do bjj with socks on 🤦
Swear that one dude really just rested his hand on Paddy's nuts at 7:21 😂
What a fabulous fella
Best Video I've seen in awhile, Awesome stuff Paddy the Baddy !
Sick!
I just am VERY curious how Paddy would fare against Marines that were told “treat him as an enemy, screw rules”.
Its getting harder and harder to keep disliking this guy.
I can see my Senior in the back, SDI SSgt Nimphey out of Echo, during the intro where he was squatting the marine.
He made 10 marines tap and was not even in in his 100% fighting form, that had to be a world record.
Whoever is working the camera needs to be punched in the face for giving me motion sickness!
Hats off to Marine Core. Really cool interaction between UFC and the troops. Educational too
How bout the cops in the US have some kind of training like this... xD
Fun video
Great video, mate. Thanks and good luck with future fights  😃👍
more like paddy the fatty 😂
Although he calls himself a fatty I wouldn't mind looking like him. Im 6' 175 lbs. and he looks way better than me😅😮‍💨
Him apologizing when they had to pick him up🤣🤣🤣🤣
Paddy quotes Bret Hart and taps out 10 marines, somewhere Shaun Michaels is crying
Poor paddy was bolloxed after that..😂
this guy a nobody fatty
I love that you beeped fuck but he definitely said cunts, not cats
Top notch. Paddy the baddy!
Stop fat shaming yourself paddy. You look great and work great!
All my homies love Paddy !
Sick 💥💥💥💯😎
Top geezer !
This is him on a diet of burgers, chips and pizza too!
amazing video
having sex with paddy would be dangerous
Nothing but love lad 👌 legend already
Lol can not understand this guy
2:59 I just say sorry I'm soo fat lad
Paddy isn't fat, he just has big cheeks when he isn't cutting weight.
💯💯💯
fuck maybe him gaining weight isn't so bad😂the fact he can do this against ten men in top shape after an already hard workout is insane. Imagine his stamina when he's back to his light fighting weight, it's gonna be crazy. Of course he can bulk up healthier but hey it's a short term game unless he wants to stay in the long term.
He really isnt fat. Its all in his face🤷🏾‍♂
The force is strong in this one
Your work for mental health is incredibly inspiring . I myself have been in some dark times and it really is true what you say “talk to someone” . That advice has saved me . The stigma men have to be strong all the time needs to end, it’s human to have feeling. Opening up shows more strength . Thank you paddy for effort you have put in to raise awareness.
“Sorry I’m a fat bastard” 😂😂😂
Dude this is awesome i was a marine for 5 years
love this content!!! thanks guys
It's  ashame that a military looks for people who never served to demonstrate  combatives they never recognize real heros and take stray people who have no intention of being a remodel for the country.
Just goes to show that fitness has nothing to do with ability and skill. Jiu Jitsu showed me that. 😅 being 5’5 and able to fight bigger and stronger opponents, it changed me
Love it
Are those bidens woke marines?
Not going to lie, thought Paddy was bit of a bellend at first, mainly due to his cockyness in the ring. However, I've grown to really like and respect him.
What’s your favourite book Paddy?
Paddy can't stop apologizing for being fat lmaooooo
Move to San Diego and train with them more
What a lad, not only that, but the Marines were at top set of guys too! Much respect!
You're so fucking real. The Q&A almost had me in tears mate, for real. Your realness is a breathe of fucking fresh air. Keep being you! <3
Paddy looks puffy af
Hell yea bro. You just gained another loyal fan. What a legend. I've met a few Paddy's, they were all good c*nts
Americans love this dude this was a great idea 🎉
You're a legend full stop bro I'm suffering from mental health issues have been since leaving the British army but you give me courage and the knowing that I can get better I can fight it cheers bro....
Love how he ends alot of sentences with "lad" 😅
You no what I've been feeling depressed as fuck for a while, but coming across paddy's videos it's made me laugh. One funny guy
Fight With Khamzat He will smash you
I never went from hating someone to loving someone like I did with paddy
I would love to be your friend tbh
Paddy is the best!
Paddy the Fatty
LOL sorry im so fat
That was super impressive
Yessirrrr
This video was funny and moving at the same time. Awesome lad!
Good onya lad 👌 solid & deadly 💪
His coaching in jiujitsu is so good. Daamn  Talent in everything  I mean so natural, not playing a role or something. I think he will be a great coach when he finishes his carrier
What a gift to get from them, mint that
Yeoo he’s probably one of the funniest fighters I know 😂 he goes “ I had to say sorry I’m so fat” 😂
Good lord take your socks off man😂😂😂
Kept apologising for his weight he's proper down to earth
“I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.”  ― Major General Smedley D. Butler, War is a Racket
Yeah I have become a fan now. Love how he openly talks about his mental health struggles. Rooting for you Baddie
Mad love to Paddy the baddy your an amazing soul and inspiration to millions... Appreciation all the way from New Zealand 🇳🇿
0:02 something is wrong 💀💀
Epic! He's awesome AF, humble & such an amazing role model. May his career reach greater heights!
Paddy does hours of Marines' workouts and then proceeds to beat 10 of them up.
I love the David vs. Goliath mindset and that’s why he’s so damn dangerous in an octagon he not only embraces adversity but expects it. It’s beyond just physical talent and skill it’s a true warriors mindset. It’s so admirable. Love this man
Teach them escapes from the submissions you use and go again.
When I saw this pathetic bastard carrying a 100pound girl on his back to show off how awesome he was...  That was the moment I knew he was just another tussy show off.  Then I didn't bother watching the video.
Went from liking to loving. 👏 Those Marines will never forget that.  You really made their day Sir!
Man there no way someone can watch some content from paddy and not love the guy u can tell he’s a real genuine person and the fact he did this and it’s not his home just shows how much of a second home it is for him here and if someone doesn’t like him then ur just a pure hater at this point
Paddy is getting bigger hes gonna be a beast hell he already is
"I just have to say sorry im so fat lad" 🤣🤣
credit it to him continually fighting ahd getting 10 winns well done scouse
he is lika\eable when he keps his gob shit
Phenomenal conditioning for a "fat" lad.
Bunch of pussy getting lessons from a yut boy, step by step they all fall down toy soldiers 🤣🤣
“Mee legs are ded” 😂
Why didn’t he come see infantry Marines I’m one of them he was fighting desk jockeys yes the desk jockeys are trained in mixed martial arts as we infantry are but we know it better.
pendleton, pimbleton?  coincidence?
5:50
Paddy vs the english language
Music's GARBAUJ 🗑 🚮
This guy is a shining beacon of what the word "heart" represents.
One tough man 👍
*checks out paddy’s YT channel for the first time* *0:02* aight i’m out
Please someone cast Paddy as Roddy Piper
Unbelievable 👏👏👏
Twombly is awesome!
Paddy you are the MAN! Lifelong fan in me!
Should have went to an Infantry Battalion instead of 9th Crime Battalion.
You’re doing soo much good for us guys man I’m 20 I just got out of a bad bunch of years including rehab and suicidal thoughts and I started mma and AA groups and watching you showing that what we are fealing is real and we are not alone brings a tear to my eye and crying isn’t being a wimp I mean you just tapped out 10 marines and talked about crying in ur bed the same day
Why are they high crawling if the instructor said to low crawl?
US marines (or US anything, really), understand...  sometimes (most times), just shouting loudest doesn't necessarily win you anything. Quality video, bud. They need to play this in all US primary schools to prevent naivity, ignorance and loudmouthness in later years... LOL
Paddy should be called "Paddy the goody"......such a good lad 😇
"I just wanna say sorry, I'm so fat" 😂😂😂
Everybody else after a sentence: . Paddy: know what i mean?
Marine hand to hand has come a long way since its LINE training days.
''sorry lad, im a fat bastard.''
Patty says he’s fat but dudes jacked. Got some weight on his face but that’s just how he looks. He cuts weight and it all goes away. The dudes proper as fuck know what I mean. Banger video too.
They every second of the training and then cut through each fight in 3 seconds?  Why do you think I clicked on the fkn video!? FFS!
Funny thing is , they were all trying really hard lol
This is awesome, but it doesn’t simulate what hand to hand combat would be like against opposing enemies in a combat zone… this is all about technique, in war its all about foul play to stay alive, and you cant really compare it
"Sorry lad im a fat bastard" LOL
Bro paddy is a fucking beast, 10 marines back to back after a week of strenuous workouts
Why does this look like a PUBG thumbnail? 😂
Bro I'm 3 min in and wheezing af hahah Paddy, you're a legend man. Fastest growing MMA channel out there, lets go. And bro, please, like some dude suggested before, make a "Paddy the Fatty" channel where you go around eating different foods n shit, bring Molly she's always fun and you guys got a great vibe. Keep this shit up man, and stay strong. Sorry to hear about your friend. Life RNG sucks sometimes
So fun fact, when you accept a challenge coin you're supposed to do it with a handshake. Made me chuckle.
Great man surrounding himself with some real bad MFs🤘💯
Tbh when i first seen Paddy i didn't like him. Now i kinda feel bad for judging a man so quick. Been watching him and he really seems a down to earth good bloke. Team paddy all day 💪✌
Paddy is just a real one. No bullshit. He 100 percent reminds me of a uk version of my boy Jesse.
Love Paddy. What a great ambassador for everything he stands for
Not only beating 10 marines, but he was even so gentle and respectfull of the while doing it. He is quite likeable
Paddy the certified goat😂🐐
When the skill disparity is so great that you can let your sparring partners set up on you, only to shrug your shoulders and take side control feels incredible.
If I wasn't 40 and fat id start training after watching ya paddy...love your work lad keep it up. Your an asset to this mad world we live in.
Paddy has the same level of respect from me as my grandfather. A real man long live paddy!🔥
Over 20 middle fingers love it
Middle east rapist 😅
This is embarrassing, not one of the marines could defeat this out of shape already tired Paddy guy. What if they went up against a real good mma grappler like Khabib, Charles Oliveira, or Khazmat???
Top video champ! #STAY HUMBLE NOT a LIFE or KNIFE  x
*HEY LOOK WHAT I CAN DO*
Paddy is defo my favourite person in the world he's done so much for mental health its insane 10 year ago no one spoke about anything now everyone's speaking about there depression if it wasnt for u millions probably would have killed there selves im battling with suicide ive spoke to my family about it ive spoke to docs about it i have cpn workers now im on medication so thanks alot would love to meet u one day who wouldnt want to meet a legend. Bet u that ammo crate piece is going straight on ur wall
Glad to see fighters taking the time out to teach these skills where it could be fatal to fail.  P.S. im pretty sure its a felony to destroy federal property (marines) 😆
It’s good training Value, most Devil dogs are not seasoned grapplers but the best ones are still in the ranks prolly in okie training in Japan. I’d kill to see that. Either way good shit leathernecks, way to hone your skills. America needs you and I know you’ll always prevail. Semper Fidelis, one mind, any weapon! Kill.
Than WM Was good to Go you understand Me?
When you make 10 marines look like little kids...
Paddy has all the frame data downloaded. it's just not fair.
Song???
Y’all impressed with him winnin against all the marines , I haven’t watched yet, but you realize it’s his vlog right? Ofc you see what he chooses and makes him look best 😂
so much respect for paddy talking openly with a group of strangers
What a G
Congratulations,  Paddy. We are proud of you. Good job,  and great attitude. God bless you.
I si estuviera en forma como cuando se prepara para una pelea aun lo hubiera hecho mas facil
I wasn’t into ufc until I heard about paddy and now I can’t get enough of him!
I got more respect for paddy, man works hard and has solid advice for those dealing with mental health problems.
I need an English to English translation
What made him go there is that the camp sounds like his last name.
I love he casually saying he is overweight and still rolls 10 marines back to back
Mental health is no joke and going through most likely the darkest time in my life knowing he’s where he’s at from where he’s been is comforting knowing I will get out of this current place I’m in, LADS WE GOTTA STOP BOTTLING IT UP
Nothing says: I am a man's man like tapping out 10 fucking marines and then admitting to crying to those same men while advocating for mental health. That's inhuman levels of indurance and self awarness.
This is pretty cool but to be fair, odds are you aren't getting that close to a Marine, and if you do, he's not going to be alone and he's not following "rules." Good on him for doing this though.
That was one of the best video’s I’ve seen in a long time.
Paddy the baddy!! Love that name, better than something like Hulk Hogan.
That was sick.
There is no way they understood a single word Paddy said to them
Paddy is a waking W
it's crazy to think if those Marines ended up in some bizarre situation where they were needing jui jitsu in actual combat, there wouldn't be any "tapping out", you would just break their limbs or kill them
take a shot every time paddy flips the bird 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
0:02 sus
Paddy got his ass kicked
Great of you for speaking so openly about mental health and giving proper advice. Hope anyone reading this gets to have a friend like that! We all know we need one
The Dunlop didn’t slow you down much!
You are my favorite paddy !!!!
2:20 please comment below if you know the name of this track, I'm literally dying to know.
Good watch, enjoyed it lid 😉
I'm sorry I'm so fat 🤣
What's that song though?
I’m sorry I’m so fat bruv 😅😂😂😂
10 n 0 against a bunch of badasses is impressive
I'm impressed he hung in there he ain't in fight shape
What a legend.
Beautiful to see all the devil dogs looking like they’re having a good time despite rolling with Paddy of all people
Love how they don’t mention they are marine raiders😂
Did he respect their pronouns ?
Paddy the Fatty 😂 But still kicking 10 Marines ass on the ground, dangerous fatty 😂
ONE OF THE BEST VLOGS I SEEN!!!!!!!!
What song is it when he’s rolling? “Don’t make me lose my mind” part
UFC Fighters are a diffrent level
Bro I'd love to grapple with him he'd kill me but the knowledge and experience I would take away from the experience would be worth the ass whooping
Amazing Paddy!! Thankyou so much lad😎🖤🙏
sorry im so fat lad had me rolling
❤💪👊
Paddy keep on being you man. Your content is so pure and good and real.
i love how hes working on his weight and hes still awesome at what he does
More
Watching grappling is like watching  2 anacondas with limbs fight
Paddy Sounds like Brad Pitt in Snatch!
No cualquiera puede decir vencí a 10 Marines
paddy causally 1v 10 of the best fighting force in the planet bro going to invade COD
What I take away from this is that the military aren't that good at unarmed martial arts, but it's probably OK cause they are gonna shoot you anyway.
wow, paddy the baddy is a top bloke.
Hold on a minute, in the beginning is a marine holding paddy's balls???? I'm so confused
Just keep getting more badd ass don't ya?
Paddy ! I don’t know if you get to actually see this account but I’m a US Vet and I was drinking alone and I saw this and it was remarkable. Love your energy, love your fights, love your advocacy for mental health . Thank you man this is awesome stuff you’re doin
Wtf paddy is a bad man training session with marine’s and a grapple session with 10 /0 paddy take my hat off to you show u my bald head you talk the talk and walk the walk respect ✊ my brother
Nice!! 🍻🥳
The fact he made 10 marines tap back to back, and they were so appreciative to give him their coin speaks volumes for our corps
Paddy- "I have to say sorry I'm so fat lad"  Marine- grunting in pain " No you're good" That exchange was so wholesome!
A USA seal team 6 got knocked unconscious by an Australian bouncer the other day in a street fight. These guys are very disciplined but not super humans
Broooooo two things... Paddy is technically over weight in all our military branches and would never make rank or advancement due so. Also that dumb Mohawk chub at the end trying to hand shale the coin for marine brown nose bullshit and paddy just grabbed it not knowing...hahaha gem. Love pady.
9:55 he must be bret hart's brother using his catchphrase.
he looks good at 200lbs the only problem is a lot of the fat goes to his cheeks so he looks like he got stung by bees. But if it wasn't for that i think hed be good at 200lbs
You're the best, but anyone can beat you... honestly the more I think about it the better it sounds. People will pretty much always be able to get the better hand on you, but you just have to keep believing in yourself and fighting
I thought HE'S OWEN WILSON
Paddy my Girl killed herself almost six years ago on new years eve and it beat the shite out of me mentally and im lucky i had me mum an dad and a few close friends who were there for me...I went through a patch where i thought about death and killing myself i was drinkin gloads sniffing and crying all the time... but thankfully through talking about it and seeking help iv managed too pull through..Shes always in me heart and never far from my mind but she would want me too live me life..Im there for anyone who wants too chat about issues they have and im forever telling the lads too speak up and also tell others too be there for those who do...Your top draw bonnie lad keep being you
Playing around I'm sure patty will win most times. But I guarantee you in life or death the marine will win. 😂
Bruh what is this grappling montage. Someone can't  hold a camera straight and got the idea to cut out every other second so you can't follow what's going on
Great bunch of lads whooarr
I gotta give a SHOUT OUT to your YouTube team brother. These thumbnails to the videos have my wife and I dieing laughing 🤣👍
I’m so sorry I’m so fat…I felt that
“As I say sorry I’m so fat man” I thought he was kinda funny from his other shit but this has changed my view, dudes hilarious.
Bully Smasher!
Paddy completely changed my mindset on life and being “weak”. Thanks to him I’m alright now
Awesome!!!!
I  hope paddy never gets knocked out 😞
Lad is a beast wtf
I'm enjoying all of this. Good on you lad. Keeping it real, and it's good to see you really pushing the mental health issues, and trying to break through the stigma. 👍
Paddy is a self-proclaimed socialist. I suggest you use your electronic device to learn about the history of socialism, since this clown clearly hasn’t. He’s a charming idiot.
He just keeps moving up
Paddy is very inspirational. What I got out of this is his honesty and integrity always with a dash of humour. I'm 62 yrs old. Plus, he's not who he is without the dark places. Great advice from this youngster, lol.
One thing i learned and has stuck with me was my wrestling coach said no matter what if ur on the ground and ur opponent is trying to ur you to lay u on ur back, and u twist ur body and lay on ur back all by urself thinking it’ll work as an escape ur wrong u will easily get pinned and lose the fight or match ur always supposed to stay off ur back at all times
I f with paddy
Paddy is so fucken funny him apologizing for “ being fat” even tho thid guys is in really good shape

I don't follow UFC because these guys kind of get underpaid considering the risks and I don't want to give Dana White any more money than he's already scraping in. But I've been seeing this guys name around. This is the first time I've engaged anything with him in it, and I have to say even if UFC or MMA doesn't wash out for him he's got a charm and charisma that could probably carry him through whatever he wants to do. Seems like a nice guy. Wish him the best.
What a legend the best advocate for men
Is the dude in the grey shirt your manager.
Awesome video...
Dude @ 9:00 when we was talking about your mental health, thats  fricken real, i love that he's talking about mental health with marines
You'll Never Walk Alone, Paddy!
Paddy you are the man Sir!!!! Id love to sit down and talk to you for hours….. you are the real deal and Thank You for all you do and the awareness you bring!!!
Paddy the fatty 😆
Shoulda came to 3/5 ico bro
Did anyone else notice that Paddy had bare feet while all of the Marines kept their socks on? I'm not saying that was the deciding factor, but I feel like I would have much more traction on the mat with bare feet than with slippery socks, and traction equals leverage.
This guy rocks
Paddy the baddy is back mental health is a big problem thank u paddy
Where is this in camp pendleton?
He's sorry worried about his weight class vs everyone else
Now let paddy take on 10 royal marines😂
Paddy gonna be out there puking blood again 😆
Лютые, бжж - это настоящее искусство🥋🖤
1:51 I mean.. Paddy the fatty also has a good ring to it you decide no to cut weight! 😂
I love the way he steps into the ring like a total crazy nutcase  hahaa Great show everytime, win or lose
Lamentation 3:19-23 I remember my affliction and my wandering and the bitterness and the gall. I remember them and my soul is downcast within me. Yet this I call to mind and therefore I have hope. The faithful love of the Lord it NEVER ends. His mercies NEVER cease. Great is his faithfulness, His mercies begin afresh each morning!  Your emotions are valid but they are not permanent. Your situation might seem hopeless but with our good God there is always hope!!!
Good wrestling and good character Martial arts is a respect sport though, so please avoid cussing.
Paddy u Legend!!! 🔥
Makes it look easy but he is an absolute beast.
Love what your doing paddy!! Keep it up 👌🏻🤙🏻
Dat British accent is sick
Top, top man.
Biggest thing for me regarding mental health & talking to people about mine, is i thought i needed to go the docs knowing in my head exactly what made me constantly sad, but through many hours of professional help i found it wasn't any single thing that i could identify & address.  It was an accumulation of so many things, most i'd consider not worthy of mentioning, others to do with the environment i grew up in that moulded my personality in a negative way. It took many hours with a professional and total surrender by me to tease the causes out. *Don't put it off trying to convince yourself it's normal or it'll blow over, it doesn't, depression will put you in denial, consuming you while making you draw back from friends & loves ones*  not happy with your gp/docs response? find another.  I left it far too long, only when i hit rock bottom after dulling my emotions with booze & hard drugs for 10+ years. Having a friend i could have discussed such things without fear of ridicule would have been so invaluable, you couldn't put a price on it.   I still can't quite picture it, as anytime i try to be real with '' friends '' they swerve it and stick to the hard shell they wear to face the world,  can be hard not to think 'everyone is fake & resent every cunt coming into my orbit', that's where i am most days.    I try to focus on being that guy i needed, for my teenage sons.    Most importantly *don't be me, don't put off getting help,* given long enough it will shape who you are, I'm still a miserable fucker but living is bearable & my now wife attests that i'm so much nicer to be around.
What language does this blond man speaks ? some words are like english
I can't believe this guy is both a professional MMA fighter and a comedian. I love him, subscribing right now 🤣
Whoa!! That's great show of grappling and the way it is dangerous,  cause not everyone taps out ,but they will have a broken arm or leg, etc 😉
5:49 - that's some serious grappling skills.
Damn this dude is a bad ass.
The man’s a legend
I dont understand shit when he talks
I can smell the video from up here 🤪
I never understand what he's saying...even with subtitles.  They say he's speaking English.  Well
Paddy, when someone gives you a challenge coin, you shake their hand to accept it. Don't just take it from them
I'm surprised not 1 Marine knew any Jiu-Jits.....smh  Paddy you should have called the Army instead....
Respect for this guy!
Gotta admit. The more I see of (and actually hear of) him. The more I like him. Authentic as they come. Kudos for advocating for mental health. Semper Fi.
Very cool
Just in case you’re thinking these devils are scrubs. Some of them were the top wrestlers in their states, cities or school districts. When I was in, a lot of the dudes in MCMA were elite wrestlers. So he’s doing some serious shit.
This is awesome training and all, but jarheads aren't going to play by the rules when it comes to fighting in a war.... if you have to take a bite out of someone's arm to keep them from choking you, that's what you need to do.
a hobbyist purple belt could do this, please get on the mats before you gush over him tapping whitebelts
Paddy.  You are one great dude!  Those Devil Dogs had no idea what it takes to grapple well.  Hopefully their eyes and minds are open and some will train.
This is awesome
Love this
“ I jus have to say I’m sorry I’m so fat “ 😂😂😂😂😂😂 gotta love dude
marine no. 3 had to step up for the marine core
Outstanding!
Paddy
add another FAN 2 THE LIST
Can't get enough of Paddy, such an amazing testament to grit and hard work and a true hero to anyone with mental health issues.
Number 4 had wrestling background for sure
600k subs reached Patrick!
"Sorry lad imma fat bastard" 😂😂😂😂
Anyone know the song name around the 5:57 mark? 😊
You'll always have a home here bud,keep being you
I love Paddy he has an amazing vibe 🔥
What made him do this... Guts determination and no one can beat him Francis nagano with 7 arms....that heart!!! Nice job paddy
Everyone got a taste of some cheesy bacony flavored paddy potato skins
Imai Cosmo right there.
sick
seems like you got your ass beat all day and then still had enough left over to show 'em who's boss on the mat. good job sir
Love watching a Brit beat up yanks😂😂😂
Top bloke train hard pays off 🙏💪
Dat hair 🤣
Paddy vs Bryce mitchell would be a great fight!
Respect to the Marines!
Awesome Paddy is a great athlete 100%.
I’ll roll wit em
But say you actually fought a marine in hand to hand combat with no rules, not this.. I'd probably pick the marine.
When I went to basic training for the army I met a guy, Damien Gaskin, he’s got a couple videos of when he used to do mma competitively and he used to train marines mma when he was in the marines before. Guy was a bad ass
what is the name of the song that plays in the ju jitsu segment?
Area 53 Paddy, Camp HORNO is where you wanna go fam.
Awesomeness 💪😎🇺🇸🥋
Paddy haz videos con subtítulos en español así te vemos en latino america
18 month transformation on my page!
At 6:32, after all those workouts you can see the sheer will and dedication kick in on his face! True warrior!
Love from Huyton, Paddy! I grew up round the corner from you haha fuckin show em lad!
My only problem was paddy did seem to have a weight advantage..alot of those guys seemed small,light
Luv paddy..keep it up
hey Patty I was stationed at the base you went to and what I like about you is you keep it real you say what you feel and don't hold back that's the way my father was he was stationed in your country during World War II and he flew on a B17 bomber and bomb the Germans out of existence. and it's not that I don't like the Germans I should have said he bombed the Nazis out of existence. like to meet you someday xboxer as well.
Do the ARMY acft. It’s not easy
The control and gentle way paddy beats these guys is what impresses me the most! Such a good guy👌
These are pogs. Go to an infantry or raider battalion.
Us marines are pussys
which language was he talking in? he seems to know a bit of English though
💪💯
He’s a good guy I can see but his accent is obnoxious!
0:03 "this mf killing meEeE" 😂😂
Paddy jokes about being fat, but he just has one of those faces. He may not be super lean here but he looks like a fucking horse. Crazy the cut he does.
paddy the fatty
Hate seeing the lad getting grief, he seems like a sound guy n he can scrap no doubt hopefully be a champ in the ufc before long😉🙏
Guys paddy the baddy 1 scammed me on telegram acting like she was the real one. I know dumb. She/he reacted under my comment with a you won a giveaway spot. Please be aware and report that account please! @paddythebaddy the real one please make other people aware of this scam. The scammer keeps the import costs and wont sent you shit 🤮🤬
Love you paddy, your devotion to mental health awareness and your humbleness are inspiring to all. You are quite literally saving ppl by talking about your experiences. Awesome to see you giving our Marines some world class training.  -Former Sgt at MCB Camp Pendleton.
😎
Awesome video - great content. I'm loving your journey, Paddy! Keep being you...**ahem** lad!
Good job brother
It's insane how quickly he puts on weight and how fast he can loose it. And the way it changes the shape of his face too 😂
В конце УРА! было?
Lmao! Good shit there.
Ok now. Fight with pistol.
10 Marines against 10 UFC champions in the ring according to the rules of mixed martial arts - the result is obvious. 10 Marines against 10 UFC champions in a "fight or die" fight somewhere in the rainforest, when the equipment is only clothes, dry rations for 3 days and a combat knife - I would look at the results of these fights with great interest.
Классно вышло, продолжай в том же духе
Hey, I heard about this when it was happening at work a few weeks ago. Seems like a cool guy. MCSlap is a joke
has paddy the "baddie" become the "goodie"
I'm so grateful for subtitles
the "sorry im so fat lad' killed me
Bruh this is so easy to call...this kid is going to ride his celebrity all the way to the bank, he ain't no professional athlete, just a young kid with a big mouth pretending to be something he's not...
3:42 he got cake though O_O
It’s the guy from that one yt short! I’m hooked and had to subscribe! Keep up the good work sir 🫡
paddy the faddy
I like seeing paddy with a bit of weight on him. Just want him to shave lmao
he is special
Anyone know the song/music while he is doing the Marine training?
Congratulations to Paddy, that's so awesome.
Paddy's jujutsu is really good.
So much love and support for this man! He always goes above and beyond. Fucking legend!
great video
3:00 🤣
Can't help but find it a little worrying how Paddy's weight goes through these spikes and then drops crazy low for fights - cannot be good for his body.
Paddy will need a fight camp to go to the shops soon😂
Wow you're amazing
That’s a bad motherfuckker
I love that he was teaching them something
"one of my hardest workouts this week"......
Thoughts of doing that hung over gives me the fear
🔥🔥🔥
Brit: "Sorry I'm fat." American: "Huh?"
Damn Jordi El Niño pollo looked decent
What, is USMC just combat crossfit?
He reminds me of theo von if he changed accents and did ju jitsu
I think Paddy is worthy of getting the elusive, MCMAP Black belt with double-kill red stripes.
its crazy the skill leap im a solid 6'1 230 pound guy who would get rolled by everyone of those marines then times it by 5 is where the baddy is at.......
i just wanna know why everyone say about the american army they are gay especially the russians but in this video the american armay almost look the best the soldiers have the same height the physics even the same looks
You do realize the marines are woke pansies right dumb dumb
I gotta alot of respect for someone like patty to through him self in to this kind of challenge... Awesome...
this was great! do more of this kind of thing and them marines where genuine but still a bit shit cos you smashed them all to bits haha!
paddy me sister loves ya
The clap while he was on the ground dead af😭😭😭
well paddy wasnt too far off guessing m16 ammo. still 5.56
can he speak English?
This is top tier content. Didn't even know you had a YouTube with 500k subs 😎
"I have to say, sorry I'm so fat.." hahaha.
Fucking awesome video paddy I would have watched for ten more hours if the video was that long... Keep doing your thing paddy can't wait to see u get that belt!!!
Awesome guy, does anybody know the rap song   that's playing whilst wrestling with the marines 👍
This is awesome. Makes me miss Marines, and also makes me love Paddy. Your awesome dude.
You da man PADDY! Much love from Long Beach CA
If you’re feeling down, talk to someone! It’s a good way to reconcile issues and move on from the obstacles thrown your way. It’s not coincidence everyone who follows this advice then recommends it to others! There’s a lot of suffering in the world right now and it’s important to remember you’re not alone and if you only just look you’ll find there’s many good people out there willing to help.
After Khamzat’s recent shenanigans, Paddy is now my favorite fighter in the UFC.
I like this video because it shows a man who has mastered his sport. Any one of those Marines could destroy me, and he was able to make 10 of them tap out when he's not in his best fighting trim.  Wow.
Paddy is definitivly one of the second class goats already
Soy el único que habla español aqui? 😀
“If I hurt ‘myself’ it’s on you” Paddy was joking but it’s crazy other people do think that way lol.
"Its your typical 556"    ...Sick
Him admitting that was the strongest thing in this video
Awesome
First video watching of him and I'll subscribe instantly what a gem of an athlete. I want a glass of whiskey with this man
This is a lesson for a lot of people. Just because you’re bigger than someone it doesn’t mean they can’t mess you up.
Bro your super smart for doing this YouTube channel. Your the best dude. Love you brother.
I'm soorrry ima fat bastard lmao same pattty
Love this dude
Dudes like "im so fat" and does this crazy circuit training, then grapples against 10 dudes in a row... Sure... fat...
Wish you all luck man!🙏🙏
I just imagine this must have been such a cool fuckin day, for borh Paddy and the marines ❤
Go Paddy! Didn't take me long to become a fan.
Great video man !!!
Bros a monster
I appreciate the technicality you showed them.  Making the angle, grabbing the tricep. Legit things they can use
First of your videos i've seen & youve got a subscriber! good shit, cheers mate
he grabbed the coin instead of shaking his hand😂
Great video
Dang and I just left 9th Comm
Seriously incredibly
These marines will end up going overseas to shoot women and children. I don't see how jujitsu will benefit them?
Paddy you are a @#$%in Legend for bringing attention to men's mental health. I send you all my love and luck for you and your career mate!
Probably the biggest video I watched for 2022.
Can't help but love this dude.
This shits awesome
Paddy is a real one. True badass, and just a good dude.
SIMPLY IMAGINE KHABIB WOULD HAVE DONE THE GRAPPLING XD
What a lad
what a guy
Legendary!!!!
Hate to say but you failed the test
To go up against 10 Marines in top physical condition is insane, it's even more insane that he did that after doing such an intense workout. Paddy is a machine!
mate i used to .love ufc and than it became stale, boring, than the gods opened the skies! and dropped you badass into it!. Than ufc became godly!, Well at least when you fought!. Love ya man keeping it real and kicking ass!. Oh and fuck america's breakfasts! boy's could learn a thing or two from a good ol'English brekky!. Also you have opened my mind to the fact it is ok to cry or get help. Love ya mate!
Paddy: “What was in there, like grenades or what? M16 bullets or what? What was in there?”  Marine: “Just your typical 5.56.”  Paddy: *Dial up noises* “SICK.”
SCOUSE
Paddy is the best! All due respect🙏. Somebody please explain sub number 6 to me ?
Awesome. He is such a great dude tbh.
Removing thier socks might help them abit more
Paddy you're an absolute legend!
Paddy piglet
Paddy is a baddy he really took out that many Marines like wtf that amazing and the way he taught them to do stuff was even better I love your platform of work and man massive Respect to your career
I wanna be like him. Not career wise but personality wise.
Sound as fuck la 👌👍👊👊👊
Lol pressure tapped that kid
Dude is such a class act!
Track name at 5:50 please???
I came for blood and found genuinely wholesome content.🥺
as a friend of 3 marine infantry  This was awesome, they have told me some stories and where there mind is at - best thing to do when someone comes to you with this their issues or where their brain is at... LISTEN, let them just spill their shit, and let them know you are happy to hear them get if off their chest
at 00:02 in… is that an advanced USMC wrestling technique?
What a guy
Didnt know Paddy had a youtube channel but im so happy i found it!!
Haha my old drill instructor is in this video, he’s the one who says “it’s gonna get worse” to paddy at the beginning of the video
I really don’t understand paddy’s physique
Paddy I swear this work out made you lose like 10 pounds from the beginning to the end you literally physically look like you lost weight that's wild
paddy would be an amazing coach
paddy is a fucking legend
I absolutely love that sweep from the kimura, didn't even know you had a YouTube channel I'm made up this video's come up in my feed 😊😊
Better title ....  paddy the baddy takes on my daddy🤣🤣🤣
This is the difference between ground game and fighting standing. Sure it's more exciting for most people, but punching and kicking is a roulette situation every time, regardless the opponents. Almost anyone can throw a strike and damage another, but if you are on the ground most untrained people do not know how to damage or threaten to submit. So then it's just a matter of time before the trained fighter wins, and it's usually much faster being that the attack and defense is a mystery.
Every time I step foot in a public restroom I see Blood and violence from spending so many years in prison
This dude deserves to be the next UFC superstar. He is a nice guy, not a d&*$¨as Macgragor.
He looks puffed up. Wonder if he has thyroid issues
what song is playing when paddy starts showing up the marines
"Just your typical 5x6" "..sick!"   😭😂 mans coulda just made it simple and told you, yes, it was rifle rounds 😂😂 mans didn't have to confuse paddy like that
paddy is sexy with some extra weight omg 😍
Paddy the Fatty
Spent 8 years in the 82nd 1st/504th and 4 years as a PMC with Triple Canopy. That being said the UAC training I took was very basic but it introduced me to Brazilian jujitsu. I’m not very good at it, but I throughly enjoy it and seeing someone like Paddy become such a force in the world of fighting shows you that human beings are capable of amazing things when they put the work in
Proud of our Marines, and big fan of this c*nt Paddy the Baddy!
Jesus loves u. He loves you so much he died on the cross for your sins
See if you can go through a black belt MAI course, it’ll be the hardest thing you’ll ever do
Class from both parties ✌🤘💪
Legend 🙌
ur the best paddy. I’m a sports physiotherapist so if u need anything just hit me up
Try it against British marines paddy, you already know youd be fucked, these yankees are weak sauce Joking of course this shit ain’t easy
Thought this lad was a bit annoying when I've seen him on telly promoting his fights but after watching a few of his vlogs and podcasts I can see he's actually a sound and very humble lad and he must just act up a bit in the build ups to sell the fight.
Nothing more inspiring than a down to earth every day fucking bad ass like Paddy. You give us strength Lad👊👊👊
Almost 600 thousound followers 😯😲😳
Paddy is awesome I don't give a damn
Good shit mate, you're an animal. 💪
7 arms just gives five extra options for arm bars
English please
10 ? that's insane, totally gassed and he can still talk? massive props.
Good workout Lewis when’s the next concert?
The way he keeps apologizing for being fat is killing me😂
Thank you for being so inspirational and honest.
Levels... Strength and conditioning only goes so far, you have to be skilled. You might be able to swing a hammer 1000 times but it's better to swing it 20 times and hit the head of the nail every time.
Go on paddy
He’s a great lad
Amazing Fighter and person. Loved the video. 🤙🏽 respect to you and the Marines who participated in the vid. 🇺🇸💪🏽
fuking amazing Paddy you are amazing brother
Paddy would be a war hero
Legend
what a boss
To every man and woman in uniform. Thank you for your service.
What a dipshi for naming the title like that your a clown for tryna portray the image your taking on the entire USMC
As a marine, in paddy's defense, that is a rough fucking pt haha
Damn bro where were you when I was in the Marine Corps? Lol would have loved to spar with you
Paddy you're taking over!
Him constantly having to apologize for being fat is actually so funny
Whats the song @ 5:50?
Omg! The marines…..🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️Gotta learn better body combat. Not everything comes down to machine guns, tanks, etc.
You're a good man 👍🏻
1 min ads. Nice youtube
People who call Paddy fat and lazy, watch him submit these warriors.
What they said 😂 😂 😂
Paddy you’ve made my day!!
The man looks like Owen Hart and quotes Bret Hart, I absolutely love him he reminds me of who I looked up to as a kid.
What a genuine guy 🙏  For real this guys energy is amazing 💧
Guy in mounted triangle -  “stalemate?” 😂
Every time this guy gets in front of the camera his stock goes up.
I hope Paddy goes far and gets a Championship Belt, but I can’t help it, every time I see him now all I see is Chris Griffin
Of all our Armed Forces, I find Marines the most fun to hang out with.
Met boy Reynolds would have   tapped him.
paddy is a hero !! as a recently disabled 33 year old man after a stroke  it has destroyed my life my mental health is so bad some Days I cant face daylight much anything else i watch YouTube constantly it was paddy that made me realise that its ok i picked up the phone and I'm getting help paddy is the reason I'm here now I would love to meet him to say thank you. P.S scousers are the best lad.
“Im sorry, I’m a fat bastad” 💀💀💀
i'd love to see the full un-cut footage of the sparring between Paddy and the marines. I'd watch that all the way through. Amazing content this,
New Conor Mcgregor💪!!!Good luck Peddy!!!
How can you not like this guy he’s just like every other human being well not everyone he has the purest heart
High level ju jitsu is a superpower
"sorry lad I'm a fat bastard"  🤣🤣🤣
Always remember what doesnt kill you makes you stronger! Its always okay to seek help when you feel weak, but only youre own effort can get you through everything in your life. Never resort to violence unless necessary, especially when innocent people are affected.
Dude I love this shit we needed this. This reminds me how old YouTube used to be
Love this young man. He's inspiring.
This dude is awesome
W
Very nice video but in paddy vs marines.. if u have no socks = better grip instead with socks on AND never let him behind u like if he spins u spin too u know 😅
find me a more class act than Paddy, I'll wait
No one:  Paddy: 🖕🖕
Paddy is a fucking legend already
My brother whose been training BJJ for a few years is now training at Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base - glad to see this.
I'm a fat fuck. I'd love to be trained by Paddy. Dude's a mad inspiration
Can’t help but like Paddy.. nothing but greatness La’
Absolute beast that kid hope he goes a long way peace ✌️
Dark times, absolutely inspirational 😊🙏🏡 inspires me to do artwork about my dark times and how I saved the planet 🙏
I had a REALLY hard time to understand that accent 😂
What a great bunch of men
Around 05:47 you can hear the guy in the background “I'm gonna tap everyone out”, and was referring to his reaction when paddy said we can do it like that, let's change after every tap, and he did just that, everyone tapped 🤣
Man.. he's like a python squeezing the life out of them incredible after all that working out too
That was cool! Only thing missing was teaching him to shoot ;)
gold persona   staff gotta improve the edits and cuts. loved the content, lads
Love this guy.
Yeah man. If you have a friend that’s too fake to tell you when you effed up and is not willing to call you out for being an azzhole then they’re not a true friend. A true friend that cares about you will call you out, Hirt your pride and embarrass you. In many cases this will cause so much butthurt, hurt your pride and your ego will make you hate that person for calling you out. If you ignore this person when they try to talk it out with you once you’ve had some time to think about it then you have a lot of growing up to do and just may never get over your childishness.  To admit you were an ass, swallow your pride and shake hands means you’re a true friend…if not , you’re still a child.
Why do all Marines have the same body lol
0:02 seconds : Ok.
What a good guy
https://youtu.be/1GjIo5Mx-Ow
Love this new age thing where the young guys pop off on YouTube . Subbed to Izzy n Paddy
Seeing how the marines did I wonder how well the sf community would fair against him
7:21
Don't know you well because I don't watch combat sports all that much but my gosh man you seem to be one entertaining lad.
❤
This video was awesome! :D
I love this kid when’s his last/next fight?
Love it!
I was thinking the whole time damn he speaks fast. Turns out I had my speed set to 1.25x 😂
Just an awesome video 📹.. You can truly see Paddy loves what he does and is in a good place now. That's beautiful to witness. What he did for those marines is something they will carry and remember for the rest of their lives. Imagine saying one day you grappled with a future UFC Champ if and when Paddy gets a belt.  Simply amazing video and I enjoyed every second of it ✌🏽
That sparring session reminds me of the dog fight training scene in Top Gun Maverick 😂
MCMAP was always more of a slayfest. Not effective vs somebody who actually knows what they’re doing
Dude is hilarious. " I'm sorry I'm such a fat bastard, mate" 🤣🤣
Fucking banger video mate
How is anyone impressed.. people really have no idea how good you have to be to make it professionally.. and that's in any sport.. any professionally MMA fighter would do the same thing..
Gotta love ya Paddy The Baddy, you're truly inspirational lad 👏 Thanks for being a great advocate for mental health too, can't wait to see your next fight! 👊
Those questions and honest words spoken helped a lot of people!!!
Awesome video bro much respect!!!
Paddy is doing this the right way
it’s so hard not to root for paddy man. he’s so talented in the ring but also so goofy and funny you seriously just wanna relate to him. and the fact that he’s such a big advocate for mental health especially with the stigma that men can’t speak up, he’s really gonna help change lives if not doing so already. he’s also so honest, unafraid to open up to people in hope that maybe someone is feeling how he once did and can find some comfort in doing the same. good on you paddy 👏🏽
Hes such a likeable guy. He's bad ass minus the ass hole Conor ego!!
Lets go!!!
this is lit
The kingdom of heaven is at hand. The kingdom of heaven is likened to a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.
Paddy the baddy got to love him
This is badass! SFMF
Paddy proves you can have someone with the charm, appeal, showmanship and skill of Conor McGregor, without being a complete a-hole (in fact quite the opposite).
Do you think this means that ufc fighters are just absolute machines or does this mean that U.S. marines aren’t as trained as we though they were 🤔
Get it Bro!
Mad thanks to you, Paddy Bloody HUGE a piece o advice you gave the Marines in there mate. People just have no fucking idea how essential it is getting around this stuff!!! Talk from self experience as well Huge props ma men i thank u
Paddy the Baddy, I’ve been noticing you and your mental health recovery. I am a Former Soldier from the 82nd Airborne Division U.S. Army.  Struggling with PTSD and the loss of Brothers in Arms want to say Thank you for helping the Military as they need training for Combat.  As Seeing it myself in O.I.F. I know that Freedom is not Free.  I’m praying for you in Jesus Name may you continue your Journey and be blessed. Airborne All The Way!!
Twisted up 10 Marines easy work
Paddy is real. No smoke and mirrors.
So, what's up with all the weight? Are you getting ready to fight Logan Paul for real? lmao
Paddy is a good dude!
2 seconds in that dude is touching straight sack...
Paddy is a beast among all man!
If u don’t like paddy I don’t like you 💯
I'm having knee pain flashbacks now, great!
Paddy will always be one of my favorites
someone knows the song at 5:50?
Sorry lad I'm a fat b@stard 🤣🤣🤣
Paddy the baddy such a good person, put a smile to my face.
this kids already loved in the states
"im sorry man im so fat" 😂
He looked like he lost like 10 pounds during this video
Legendary Bret Hart quote at 9:50 🕶
Fight arman
I will Say im sorry im so fat. ( no Its okay hhhuhuhhhhj)
“Sorry I’m so fat lad” lmfaooo
how many time he said sorry im fat LMAO
Paddy u got me with the sorry im so fat hahaha
everytime someone picks him up.... sorry im fat lad
I love how paddy apologized all the time because he is a "fat bastard" 😂
This is one of the best video I have seen on yt. Love this😩
I am moving towards being a paddy fan after this. There were no losers in this video.
Had me welling up there! Big up Paddy. You're a star outside of the UFC and will be for some time to come
I really appreciated this Paddy, thank you !  God bless!  J...
0:02 kind of suspicious
Damn y he gain so much weight?!
Fatty the baddy
Working out in boots god damn my feet would tap out on they own lol
Wow Paddy you are such a student and teacher in all of your training it makes you a great leader brotha !!
Aye cheers for the spoilers mate
To be fair, I got to fight to marines in Niagara falls back in 2009 when I was 18 and I wasn't very impressed they were like 20 and 22area I was working Burger King in Clifton hill and we had a nightclub across the road . So I was smoking a joint you know because fuck shitty fast food job and these 2 girls come over the ones crying and asks for a lighter and  I asked if she was OK and jazz she just said her bf was being a douche and I was just about to go in when said boyfriend come over  and it turned into a carfuffle. Regardless it didn't last very long  the boys got clapped out by me in a bk outfit. I was then fired and I went and got a job at the keg up the road lol. But I wasn't not impressed by these self proclaimed marines who obviously didn't make it to duty yet. Because I feel they shoulda done much better
“Sorry lad I’m a fat bastard”
BAD MAN
Whats the background song used while he is restling the marines?
Legend. Thank you 🙏
The cameraman was the guy recording high school fights!
hes so funny, and how does a man go from so jacked to fat so fast
We need a "sorry im so fat lad" counter😂😂
You make my kill hat tap 6:23
Paddy the whole Video: Sorry im so fat XDXD Im dying haha. Id say ur the next mcgregor but ur far more then that!
Mustbe nice getting shown techniques where you like, KNOW that they work in real scenarios, as he did those a lot.
100% a Paddy fan now, not really into ufc/mma but this guy here is awesome. For sure will follow his fights and carrier👌🏼👍🏼.
I did thos with a bunch of navy guys.  When i was in highschool an tapped then all out.  Those boys were pissed
Paddy is a fookin legend
“As I said, sorry I’m so fat.” 😂
Paddy is a mensch!
This guy English's like- fuejeksnhdj faomaotoaojdhdnehhteen dbhdbehnej
I feel like boxing and wrestling should be part of the training to be a marine or any branch in the military idk honesty kinda embarrassing to see the men that defend this country lose like that I mean I know paddy is a baddy and also a world champion but I thought that they trained their soldiers the same way
Great video! you got a new subscriber
Whaaaa I wanna grapple with paddy😢
Can't lie about you Paddy. You're  really self conscious about your build. I'm 5'9 230 lbs of DONT GIVE A FUCK. You're really inspiring man. I use to be in way better shape, but things started messing with my head. You just out grappled 10 individual men after a long, arduous  work out
Damn i felt that.    Waking up and crying   not wanting to do anything but go back to sleep to escape the reality.      Glad to see Paddy speaking out for mental health.      Shit is real.
I'm a die hard fan of yours and I have not even watched you fighting. What you are doing for mental health awareness is more valuable to me than every fighting belt or title than anyone could ever win. Great human, True champion. And for everyone suffering in silence please speak up! there are people that care about you and there are people that have been through what you are going through and felt what you are feeling and can guide you so you can find the light, I know that at times that tunnel seems dark AF but its still a tunnel, it has an exit and you just have to hang in there until you get to it 💪
Crazy how paddy lost like 10 to 10 pounds of fat/water weight half way through the vidgeo
Couldn't understand most of what he said but awesome video. From what I understand he's a stand up guy lol. Just to thick for my ear.
Wasn't a fan in the beggining of you. Thought maybe you were another McGregor.....I'll be damned though you're a good fighter a good hearted dude and you talk about men's health....we need more fighters like you in the ring compared to the Paul brothers.
Govt should pay him to train our men.
the accent always got me
god damn they never had a chance
🔥🔥🔥
Bunch of beauties. Every single one of em. Thank you guys. Stay strong for us.
That was awesome Paddy ! Thanks for supporting our young men. That is why the UFC is the best sport . Semper Fi
now try khabib.
You’re an absolute legend Paddy!
He was training with pogs though. These are not warriors in any way. He needs to train with the war fighters the grunts the ones who are in the best fighting shape. Not with women and girly men. 9th comm smh what a fking joke
This guy is pretty good. He should consider doing martial arts in the future
They don’t call him paddy the baddy for nothing 🙏🤘💚
Marines combative program is mostly striking. They are all white belt level. Army combatives is designed by the gracie family and is all grappling.

Paddy's a unit
Paddy is #1 !! Love this guy!!
This is so cool.
‘’One of my hardest workouts this week’’  You already know that’s offended every one of them 😂
Holy fuck paddy good as fuck
Quality video! That Q&A bit genuinely  brought a tear to my eye. Paddy is a true one! Can't wait to watch this kid go all the way 💪
🎉
Didnt know paddy the baddy had a youtube channel! Consider me subscribed.
I know that taint be stankin after those 10 dudes
Very cool video!  I appreciate you being a badass grappler and showing the vulnerability to talk about mental health struggles.  I'm a purple belt in BJJ and struggle with pretty bad depression.  I appreciate you doing this
Awesome!
Best advice for anyone in the MC going through mental health issues is to keep it to yourself unless you want your career ruined.
cant believe 9th crime got this
Yeah everyone goes through shit in life.  Get over it
Hhahaha he’s apologizing all day!! I love this dude! 😂
How can you not like this kid?
“Sorry I’m so fat” 😂😂
A we sneaky von flue choke in there you don’t see that very often 😮
As a royal marine I'd like to say to my leatherneck brothers well done guys . Ans paddy the baddy is fecking epic gent. Smashed and late nite and hard-core workout.   🍺🇬🇧🇺🇸
Go on lad
One of my favorite fighters.
2.11 guy in the back just lost his boy to paddy.
Officially a Paddy fan! All the support.
0:02 🤔🤨
He's such a top lad
Way to show up and go hard brother.  Thank you for commenting continuing to share your life with the rest of us on the outside.  You’ve helped so many and deserve the respect you are receiving. God Bless you bro
Dude at my last unit🤣🤣🤣
Telling marines hes sorry that hes a fat bastard had me rolling
You're a real man Paddy.  Especially the mental health....what a guy
love how paddy just casually takes a rest on top of that guy mid round😭
Those marines were 100% putting on a dog & pony show for this lad lol I can guarantee you this is not their everyday not even close
Paddy has a future in training..
His going to be that grandfather that tells the boys “i once submitted 15 marines In one day…and your complaining about this bs , come on lad” and the boys will be like mom I think grandpa is losing his shit😂
Id love to make a song with paddy
You don't get realer than Paddy lads, he speaks facts about mental health and still goes out and gives it his all EVERYDAY. The man is a legend in his own right and really speaks on things men don't tackle. It's sad how hard we fight those feelings instead of talking to those we care about and lettin em in. You're never stronger than when you're with ya mates and family! Keep doin what you do Paddy, mad respect for ya lad!
Bester Mann!!
you know i didnt like paddy because of the whole xenophobia thing but he does seem nice. just different opinions ig….
Awesome video Paddy!
Great example living by joy! Connor should forgive his mom and be the same!
True scouse
We need khabib vs marines
Paddy seems like he’d make a great dad. I hope he has lots of kids.
“Sorry I’m a fat lad”
That breadface is so dangerous
Papa the baddy 🥔
They don’t know what the hell he is saying.
The marines look like they r going easy
Legend in. The making
Ooo i love to see a marine video where they dont show a bunch of pogs doing easy workouts, this one looked nasty!
How short are these guys lol? I am 5’ 11” weighing about 165lbs and I am skinny af.
Paddy is a fuckin baddy! Semper fi brother
What a great front man for the UFC and fans alike. Respect from northern Ontario Canada
Paddy literally became my favorite mma fighter this year off his personality alone but damn his skills are the real deal too Im gonna use this as motivation to stop being a fat lad
I want to see paddy wrestle khabib, it must be good to watch
Great video, but what language is Paddy speaking ?
3:03 "sorry I'm so fat" that G of a marine "no you're good!"
You could see at the beginning he was blowing but the true class and the pro in him just shone through its like anything soon as you turn it on its there 😉 boss
"im sorry im so fat"
Man is exhausted and tapped out 10 marines gahddamn!
The marines have to take off their socks. They dont get any grip or strength into their movements or grip/holds with socks on. It will just slip lad
Incredible to think now, but when I first saw Paddy I thought he was a dick, but the more I’ve seen of him that opinion has changed completely!  What an absolute belter of a bloke - as genuine as you get with clearly a massive heart.  Much respect! 👊
Am a big fan from now on
Paddy is pure!
Paddy’s good character, funny jokes, and accent draws me in. Big fan of this dude he’s champ material
They should get him to train with the Royal Marines.
Im actually wondering if americans actually can understand 20% of what he is saying  Im actually curious, how much did you guys understand what he say
BEAUTIFUL demonstration with that grappling one after another!
Just what the UFC needed. Nothing against stone cold killers with fur hats who don't speak English but this guy obviously is a media darling.
a Good Day!  lots of Respekt, as it should be 💪
I’ve had times where I’ve just cried and after about 30 minutes i have to tell myself quit being a bitch and quit feeling sorry for myself. I get up and do something productive. Even if it’s just vacuuming a rug in your house or something. You’ll feel better.
Your a top bloke Paddy! Love you your style and attitude!!!
This was the best video that I've watched on YouTube 2022
Man this guy is an absolute star
I like this guy
The fatness apologies got me rolling
Fun to watch. Thx. Watching from Ontario Canada
That female marine.... Girls will be girls. She was getting from that.
Pause the video at 2 seconds
Anyone got the name of the song during the rolling session with the marines?
Get stinky and sweaty then grapple. Dumb
Absolutely amazing
Paddy is such a great dude, I look forward to seeing one of his fights someday. This video really made me think back to when I was in the Marines from 2016-2020 and used to grapple with my buddies for fun on the weekends. Also, I appreciate how much this guy advocates for mental health; I had a tough time transitioning back into civilian life and was in a dark place not happy where I was. When Patty said talking to get it off of your chest is no joke after I opened up about what I was upset with I found myself getting back into a healthier mindset.
Me and my buddies are uh... Close...
Lets go paddy wtf you popping off last two months
Lol dope vid! Loved how he just snatched the coin instead of the handshake take lol
Not one real marine in this whole video, if they would of yelled kill during anytime they would of won easily.
How can you dislike this guy?!
"Sorry I'm so fat, lad" 😂
Hes a real one 4 sure
10:49 shit was suppose to be handed off via Handshake, Paddy didn't realize it and mans was left hanging lmao
What a great young monster!!!
PADDY VS NATE DIAAAZZZ
this video is fuel
I like it when he started kicking some soldier ass.  Paddy reizzz
awesome vid
real marines know this was a joke
My mate katie met Paddy about a month ago, and she was saying what a great guy he is. As a north walian (wooley) I have to say scousers are the best people, great hearts, funny and  enjoy a laugh. Great city too. All the best to Paddy from a LFC fan
"Anyone can win." profound.
Scary how those soldiers soaked up his training
The marines are sliding around the mat in socks 🤦🏼‍♂️
Back when I was a DEVIL DOC,  I saw 2 Marie's plus Gunny........lemme stop.
Chuck Norris beat up the Delta Force
Mans beat everyone in the room like an action hero.
Paddy, let us see you do a Navy Seal workout sometime! Might be brutal but would be for a very very inspiring video. Keep up the good work and always remember to have a crack once in awhile, cheers and good fortune ❤️
Patty is bad fr but but him in army pants make it “fair”
“Sorry lad im so fat” 😂😂
Can't understand a word his saying. Try to learn to speak clearly not everyone understand ur gypsy accent
In my opinion every boy should try something physical, it can get you through so much. I hated being home, so football was it for me among other sports.
Rolling with a bunch of POGs
Lovely stuff!! Well done Paddy!
That was a great watch Paddy. I found it really entertaining. Just need Ben Garrity to bag a goal on Saturday now 😉
Love from Greece man!you re hell of a dude! 💪😎🤙👍
Im patty fr me everyday sorry I’m so fat lad
There’s no fucking way bro that marine he’s talking to in the beginning was one of my drill instructors
Paddy is the man!!
Throwing all those middle fingers Paddy fits right in
Not huge into ufc anymore but paddy definitely my favorite person to come out of ufc. He’s got a very bright future ahead of him without even fighting, he’ll probably make much more money than he ever will fighting just for being him.
10marines 👏🏻
I love this guy also the entire team and the marine core its just pure heart and genuine concern so uplifting ❤️ 💖 💙
Paddy is a fucking hero. He is a beast in the ring and more human than all of us
The baddy will be champion soon enough
New favorite fighter of all time
paddy is lit lol and hes funny how he says sorry lad im a fat bastard lol😂🤣
jiu jitsu has an insane skill gap they might know basics but i knew paddy was going to toy with them
For some reason,this video was much needed,much love from Cali.
fighting for their life will be the difference of a winner....
to be fair all of the Marines were wearing socks, that reduces the tracking on their feet on the mat.
Paddy is so cool looks so geeky but he's a beast
So inspirational!!! I personally have never thought about myself being the best at ANYTHING at all because i felt like can't catch up / keep up with the world around me. I believe i needed this message from you because i feel I've had no motivation to improve and better myself at all... Thank you so much for making this happen!
It's a state of mind
So m16 bullets like he asked! He probably don’t know what a NATO 5.56 round is!
This shit is GREAT. Everything. GREAT.
get him while he's down 😆 🤣 😂
I've got proper chubby cheeks
The stamina is next level 😲
Amazing content. The respect between all these men is so wonderful to see. If only every Human could speak to each other like this. It's apparent that the UFC has done more to bring the UK and America together than any other sport. As well, the last 2 years has strangely been a huge catalyst for content creators in the UK and America to now work together in a way that never happened before.   There are so many huge UK speakers who have a mostly American audience now. And the UFC has put UK people like Bisping, in mostly American roles. Bisping's podcast has a strong UK audience, and they love Anthony Smith.   In the past, not long ago, I recall UK people being extremely bitter in general, and calling American's "Yanks." I think a lot has changed in the last 5 years, and even more so in the last 2 years.   Eventually, the UK and America will heal the past wounds completely. My favorite people are UK people. Paddy is not just a fighter, he is actually working to help men across the world. Great content, and a heartfelt thank you.
I got TIRED just by watching it. Jesus F CHRIST. Paddy rocks.
That was sound that haha
Ground fondle vs marines 😂
Paddy, you’re such a cool, realistic, fun good guy, never stop being true yourself, I admire you
Well Done Paddy. Well Done. Respect and Love to you man. And to these fantastic Marines❤️❤️
Did this MF just tap out 10 marines in a row? Absolute madlad.
awesome paddy 👍
Very of Paddy to spend some quality sweaty hours with the US Marines. He’s a standup guy. I hope he takes every title he challenges.
Crazy the difference is between. Training for fame respect and money. Compared to life vs life combat
This shit had me cracking up!  😂
Paddy is a savage.
What language is he speaking? I could understand some of the things he was saying.
Sorry lad imma fat bastard😂 2:38
God bless our marine corp      I got Sick just watching this
Some boy for 1 boy arnt ye
Patty quoting Bret Hart. AMAZING 👏
My old unit :)
Haha when you calling that lad my man makes me smile you still a realun
Way to go Paddy
Imagine just being able to fill about 10 marines in one after the other
4:09 he just called you “lass”
This mothe"beep"s killing me
he keeps apologizing for being fat while being carried but he only has chubby cheeks. Kinda lovely
Right on
Love the Brett the Hitman Hart reference. The best!
crazy how it shows the gap mma fighters really are to the average
Paddy the Marines' Boa Strangler ;)
I love big Paddy!
I only knew his as a goofy dude who likes to fight.. but damn his advice on mental health was absolute spot on  Love you bud 👍
He stole Bret Harts catchphrase
I can't believe I just saw Paddy make 10 Marines tap out after a grueling work out circuit like that, the man is an absolute machine. I also love how he was able to open up about mental health struggles and how important it is to reach out to a friend or professional. All around great human being truly an inspiration.
I love how every time he got carried he apologized for being fat paddy as a marine when I fireman carried anyone they were always a bigger than me. Never know who's gonna be a casualty could be the biggest guy or the smallest.
He’s a genuine great guy 💫💫💫
paddy the faddy. I love this guy, he’s the best.
Paddy didn't realize the military usually hand coins off with a handshake! Lol
💯😎👍✌️
Paddy beat 10 marines whilst out of shape and in Paddy's words "fat" after having done what looks like almost an hour of heavy cardio .. just worth pointing out.
Best body, slang and haircut.  Baddy you so unique.. bet he can fight Light heavyweights now😆
I would love a Paddy's english class...sounds load of fun
10:46 when Paddy was handed the pedal I'm pretty sure we was supposed to shake his hand before taking it. Sure looked like the Marine wanted a handshake to me.
Alternate title. "Paddy makes 10 marines tapout"
the humble enlightened beast, what a bloke
I love the karakter of this kid. 💪
True champion
Yes paddy
"Soary hiam so phat lad"
paddy flooring 10 of em in a row is super impressive
Thank you patty this amazing man
*AMAZING stuff! Especially the part in the end about mental health!*
Such a genuine guy there needs to be more people like this. I wish him a successful career and good health.
Loved that, nice one Paddy. Takes some doing tapping those boys out like that. Especially after all that graft. And the mental health awareness 💪🏼💪🏼.
Paddy leaving O'Malley in the dust. Mans making waves
When ed sheeran retired from singing
You couldn’t have picked a better group of people to speak of mental health troubles to. It’s pushed aside too much in the corps and there’s a stigma that comes with it.
We are champs. Despite our flaws and failures. We lived and walked this sand we endured. Rest In Peace to my brother Walter. Suicide ain’t no damn joke.
bro he looked so tall so i looked up his height, 5'10? This cant be right, he looks so much taller than every one here
Is it me or that dude look like Owen Hart ? ^^
I get in trouble for having my shoes on those mats lol
Hahah the fella who said "stalemate?" has clearly never grappled
MATE, shake the mans hand when he presents you a challenge coin, don't just pick it out of his hand
Hes such a star
going through a really dark time myself rn, constantly in my own head thinking about why i’m even hear etc. never really cared to hear,talk, open up to people but today i did for the first time and it’s like paddy said, a weights been shifted off my chest maybe not by much but hey it’s better than nothing and it’ll continue to get better it will take time but it’s progress . the stigma around men not being able to open up, cry, show emotion definitely is something that i had in my own head for a long time. i thought i could just deal with it on my own keep it all in but eventually it gets to the point where you really can’t take it, it’s hard but guys please reach out to someone anyone u might not be able to speak abt much at first but youll feel so much better i can’t stress it enough. you are important and you are needed
I love watching these training videos. Hopefully he can pick up some new training methods that will only make him stronger for his fighting career. Keep advocating for mental health Paddy. Much love and support
This proves to me you aren’t a killer
Everyone of those marines would take you down bro
Gunnery sergeant flemming?
Nice.....   tapped out 10 marines in a row....   not easy
Paddy is so cool and wholesome
None of these marines did wrestling?
suprised the Americans got the accent. get on padddy!!! gg
This guy!!!
Propoganda
I can remember being so physically exhausted that I could not mentally think outside of “breathe in” and “breathe out” I did a wrestling circuit against my entire team until I physically could not move. I was being punished by my coaches for not listening to them. Needless to say I listened to every single word from then on out
The fact he kept apologizing for his weight cracks me up 😂 just like a cartoon.
Haha it looks like a man grappling with his little sons 😂
Nah patty ain't fat he is just on the bulk 😂😂
“Sorry I’m so fat” as the poor marine runs with paddy on top lol
Paddy The Baddy is a BEAST. The difference between a Pro and a amateur. They will humble you QUICKLY.
This was so cool!
Anyone know what song it is at 6:20?
being in the military i know for a fact nobody but the NCO’s had fun
Pimblett describes himself as a socialist and an opponent of the Conservative Party. Wonder how soon the American alt-right will come up with some nut-job conspiracy when Pimblett becomes a worldwide household name.
7:10 had Monty python and the holy grail vibes  Black knight.  “Shall we call it a draw?”
In today's episode, Paddy takes on a Signal Battalion. (Commo Guy's)
This guy is a part time mma fighter
Song ?
Truly a stand up guy. I am now an enormous fan!
apparently hes racist too. probably blown wayyy out of proportion too. fuck the haters paddy
Brilliant! 👏🏻 Loved this. Especially watching you hand every single one of them their own ass! Nice one lad! 😉👏🏻
Next week Paddy tells imperial stormtroopers how to deal with their emotions after committing genocide.
Lmao at "As I say, sorry im so fat" then the marines like "nah, its fine 🙂😅"
Shark tank paddy the baddy lmao
boss paddy showing real scousers proud done well paddy lad keep beening you well in god bless
PADDY FOR THE PEOPLE!
Paddy is an inspiration. Man kicks major ass and spreads awareness for the massive amount of men who kick their own ass every day thinking they're not good enough. Most men of his ego would rather die than show their weakness, but he does so because of the mere potential it might help others. Keep doing what you're doing my man.
all basic jiujitsu that, wry the x guards de la rica and berimbolos????
Cool video
Gotta love scousers
Win or lose. It’s the fight within. Paddy’s got that.
Checkout my youtube gaming channel https://www.youtube.com/c/LordJaxx11/videos
this is all bull shit and lame!this isnt for the producer.but yLL DONT DO THAT TRAINING. ill run it with  any of the  boys to prove my own
The guy is so cool
This video taught me that I could kick the shit out of most marines lol
meanwhile, the marines don't know what the fuck he's saying
Respect!
Im suprised how tall he is…I thought he is shorter
Hooorah!
Semper Fi!  Much respect to these men and women putting their lives in the line for their country.  Just to be treated like shit and thrown away like a piece of garbage after the govt is done with them.
Look like a bunch of great people including the Baddy.
The skill in BJJ is insane
Paddy eats marines 😂😂😂
Bloody ace boy!! Awesome!! 😁😎🤩
He defo lost few pounds on this training
'As I say sorry I'm a fat bastard' hahaha 😂
I just ate sorry I’m so fat 🤣
This looks like when parents send they disobedient fat kid into some kind of military tv show to torture them on camera
WTF she say? I thought he was British? Why his accent is like this?
Reminds me of someone I grew up with. Paddy has a good soul and the heart of a warrior. This was an amazing video from top to bottom. Can't wait to see what's in store for Paddy The Baddy in the coming years.
“Sorry lad, im a fat bastard” 😂😂😂
God bless everyone and have a good day.
Hahaha paddy when he keeps saying sorry to that guy for being fat😂😂 legend paddy
The “sorry I’m so fat lad” is so funny every time😂 this is my first paddy video and it’s sick
Paddy is actually a great teacher/ coach
Seeing him workout makes it hard to believe he's a pro athlete 🤣
reset while in a full blown triangle?
Wtf this is the most bad ass shit ive ever seen hahahah Paddy just did some IP Man shit where's his rice!!?
Hope paddy goes to train with the Royal marines if he gets a title fight
sorry im so fat LOL "nah you're good!"
love doin the iron mikes in a circuit
Paddy you got my support brother Semper Fi
Those are some weak workouts and everyone knows mcmap is a joke
What song is playing during the grappling?
me any time i had to train with marines when i was in the navy. like ok, we can't fake PT today hahahah
I can see it now… 10 years from now Paddy will be a pinnacle superstar. Likely much sooner than that, but he’s so entertaining to watch inside and outside the cage.
I bet paddy’s got that sign up in his house, perhaps in the man cave maybe.
"Sorry lad I'm a fat bastard" 🤣🤣 guy lifting him like he 100 lbs anyway
That’s crazy that I got out before he went to Pendleton I miss everybody dammit 😂😂
What!? Paddy did this and they didn't even take him shooting?
I absolutely want to train with this guy one day
Learnt sum real ish today 🐐🙏🏾
The good ole marine raider flag, one skull and some stars, some of the best special forces.
Never followed a fighter as closely as Paddy. Been watching MMA for 20+ years. This lad is special for amny reasons, inside and outside the ring!
Every other sentence was “sorry lad I’m so fat”😂😂 such a funny mf man
That warmup was like a full fight camp.   Masterful jiujitsu, always a pleasure watching you roll, Paddy.
Now do the Royal Marines or 42 Commando and get a real work out. The SAS would be fun to watch but it wouldn't happen
he's a reight lad
Love paddy such a gent and needs to do more shorts for the young ones telling them as it is what ambassador ❤
Paddy. All I have to say lad, is keep moving forward. Keep that positive state of mind homie. Life is beautiful.
Are we sure he isn’t Boris Johnson’s bastard love child lol
How can you not LOVE this guy?! Fun personality, charismatic where it counts, still self aware of everything going on in and out of the ring. Much love Pads 🤙
KEEP THESE COMMIN PADDY!!! u look good on the screen m8!!!!
Goes to show how valuable the art of jiu-jitsu is
Great video!
paddy is so charismatic
If you hate our great boy Paddy well...you know the rest.
Homie is smart. He is going to milk it till he gets expose. By then, he would be close to a billionaire in assets with the right decision made throughout. Cheers Paddy!
Fair play paddy, these lads are elite. Brilliant
all that for them to defend dudes in dresses. Death to America.
Crazy stamina
The amount of times he said “sorry I’m so fat lad” 😂😂
Anybody that fights with a smile is automatically a winner in my eyes
So here is the point, UFC trained guys are better than tax payer soldiers!
“I just have to say im sorry im so fat!” ( a skinny paddy) Marine: Your good!
Anyone who doesn’t like him  should watch this.
this video wants me to signup for my jui-jitsu gym again, it’s been a few months  - Rah marines.
Lol he keeps saying sorry I’m fat crackin me tf up he’s in good enough shape
He is the Gordon of MMA
Thats why I always say thank the military for their service. Cuz I sure couldn't do that SHEIT!!!
Paddy the pudding 😂
The Army is full on Jiu-Jitsu since the early 2000
Hell yeh bro, that was sick. Semper Fi to all my brothers there! Forever Devil Dogs
When In a real combat situation there are no refs there are no announcers no bells and damn sure no rules. It’s hair teeth and eyeballs followed up by nutt kicks and fishhooks!
Love how he apologized 2 everyone who picked him up "sorry I'm fat"
Hurrah!!
Sorry I’m so fat hahaha! This kid is great.
Paddy The MACHINE!!!!!!!!
Paddy makes all the exercises look easy and fun. Damm it’s really tiring. Fan of urs mate. Thanks
I have to say I'm sorry I'm so fat man.  Made me laugh  Great message though man. I'm glad you are where you are and I'm happy you have the fam you have.
Why is training with Shawm William Scott!!! Dude where's my thing partner
7:35 what the fuck is that!
This marines got balls rolling with a professional!
Paddy is a Baddy. Absolutely love watching this kid in and out of the ring. Just like Dana said. “The Real Deal”
great work
„I have the balance of a ballerina and the weight of a sumo ringer“ 😂 I love this guy!
9:54 Bret Hart quote
I like Irish accent, there a the best entertainment accent to hear at.
It is important to note, that this is under rules.  In combat there is only one rule: destroy.  Dying is not an option, it is against the rule.  :-)
When I saw the headline for this I thought it was Royal Marines. I didn't realise it was USMC. You are a legend lad. Paddy knows how to train. His JJ is amazing. Some of the locks he gets on are unreal. Thanks Pad for bringing men's depression to the front. I'm too old to be a fighter but if I was young it's all I would want to be, because of you Paddy 😊
Brilliant brilliant brilliant. What an ambassador for the UK.  Paddy, top man.
The most authentic man in mma. I fuckn love this guy 👍👍👍👍👍
Good content.
My man like an anaconda
one scally from liverpool taps out 10 marines,
Kabib: i wrestle bears Paddy: o yea lad? I wrestle marines
as an american, im watching paddy tap out marine after marine 'whilst' grime music is playing.....aaaaaaaand i love it. cheeky bastard  lmao
You were supposed to hand shake for the coin... Great video mate...
“I have to say, sorry I’m so fat, lad” 🤣🤣🤣 Paddy the absolute legend!
Nice Bret Hart quote
Paddy, we love you! ❤️
Savage workout mate and to roll with 10 marines..... thats the Baddy Lad !!!!!!
is he moving up in weight class?
LMAO the constant apologies for being paddy the faddy is killing me. Love this dude
When I first saw paddy in the ufc, I thought he was arrogant and overrated. This man is fucking amazing, the realist person to have a major voice in the ufc. Love you paddy have an amazing life buddy
Love the accent, love the humbleny: Paddy the daddy
Tell Logan paul he's funny but nothing lol
Absolute king lad 🇳🇴🤜
Such a humble cool dude👌🏼I wish you all the best Paddy🤘🏼
So … this went viral huh
I like ur nature bro 🤜🤛i did subscribe rit now
Bro looks like snipingsoup💀
Man is the true definition of Cocky but not Arrogant  . Humble yet tough . Modest and Confident. Great inspiration.
Respect man!!💪👍🙏
Great video
No personalities, same hairstyles, same outfits, all brainless thinking this is life.
Paddy your a good dude. Supporting moral with the U.S. Marines
dude im sorry but the black guy in the beginning literally looks like the stereotypical Marine you see in like every movie
Semper Fidelis marines bless all
This is the coolest shit I've ever seen lol
9th Comm!! I love it 😂😂😂
Paddy's like and anime protagonist. As a kid he had nothing now grown he can fight like mf and he's all Goofy, plus when he gets serious he becomes skinny Paddy.
People have no idea of the power of scousers. The scousers are who are going to straighten the U.K. back out, why? Because northerners only allow people to kid them for so long before they kick off.
Nice one fellas
That is amazing
Paddy u the man!!! U ever in nyc I’m taking you to come get some chop cheeses!!!! Fat boys 4 life..  thank you for ya services to all the ppl in this video

A bunch of pogs lol
Mr Pimlett When are you coming back to Chicago?
I was in the miltary and we never learned any of this. I was just a radioman (they don't call it that anymore) but I wish I had - maybe I'd won few more bar fights :)
"sorry lad im a fat bastard"
GOATed moment
Props to the editor, great choice of songs and stuff
Thank you for giving us free content ❤️🔥
So dumb, meet me and you'll get a chance... To die. Marines only do one thing.
This was really cool
Paddy turned into a fatty. America will do that to ya. But still fucked up them marines 10-0.
I love Me Lad Paddy the Baddy Me favorite fighter , You are the Best Lad .
He seems like a fuckin rad human man and him apologizing for weighing 200 was hilarious and shows he has a big heart!
Retired Navy Master Chief here....love this! Great job Marines! Paddy is such a great dude.
Lived up to his name. Paddy is a beast!
I would've thought at least 1 marine wouldve atleats almost got him .. but hey props to Paddy .. now i see the difference of proffesional fighter and Arms fighter.
$TavaresWorley help a brotha out😂
i think if you train with the marine and grapple afterwords often, you going to go beast mode
"sorry im so fat lad" lol paddy the best

As a Marine myself I love this video. One that you rolled with the guys and two metal health of veterans and how important it is to get the word out there about it.
Brother has me wanting to reestablish my training.
This video got me addicted to ufc. Went down a rabbit hole and  literally watched all your videos. You gave me lots of inspiration. You gained a fan for life.
Please tell me what is the title of background music during the fight vs marines?
7:20 ?????
That was awesome. Good training!
When anybody cuts a video it puts a question on the integrity of it
watching his hair bounce is so much fun
Love to see it! get after it Marines! Hats off to Paddy! Made me a fan!
Don’t get me wrong paddy one of the best rn when it comes to submissions but bro they should teach marines at least the basics of wrestling I mean you can use that in just about every fighting style
For a minute I thought he was talking about Halo lmao
Pendleton Marines
Fucking paddy is the realist motherfucker out there, baddest motherfucker with the biggest heart
yo looked like he was getting worked on he should do some training with grunts lmfao shit would take me out
Hahaha it is shown that the marines are not used to fight, but to make a fool of themselves losers!!
Fuck yeah dude. I just rolled like that today directly after kickboxing training. If think you know…. But you have no idea how tiring this shit is when you’re doing it 😂 It’s fun though. And valuable.
What an absolute knight.
Damn his Ju-Jitsu is off the chain. Seems like a real person with heart.
Got some random 9 Guys from the pre Marines, Get Chris Fishgold in with you for a roll Paddy, He will get you on a submission like back in the day on King of the mat at Next Gen 😅😅
On a platform full of shit, this was the realest thing I’ve seen on YouTube in ages. What a great role model..You the man Paddy!
Jesus man Paddy is the man, big heart,  great mind , such a loveable guy, big star on the rise
Great video Mr. Pimblett. You're the man.
Yes paddy your the goat 🐐
10 marines in a row f**king impressive !
Paddy the Baddy turned ceritified Fatty! Welcome to America and the all cheap food, fast food and fast women it has to offer. Get in Shape dude your a Pro MMA fighter!!!
What’s the song
What is the song towards the end?
Half the vid is paddy apologizing to people because he's fat. Lol. We love you!
I honestly had no idea Paddy's endurance was that good
Its actually insane how good a ufc fighter is. I guarantee most those marines he rolled with would fuck up the average joe, but Paddy beats all of the in a row😂
Absolute class act. A true champion.
Paddy is He-man ;)
I didn't expect this when I clicked on this video but I think that Paddy was equally able to inspire and teach mentally as well as with the fighting. I really appreciated that.
Paddy constantly apologising for being fat kills me 😂😂😂😂
cool
amazing video and great lads!
7:21 ? ayo
Paddy was supposed to shake the hand as he is accepting the coin.
Ooh rah
He said “comms” 🤣
Top Paddy 👍🏼
Paddy lad keep smashing it yano tha 🔥🔥🔥
Paddy vs 10 Royal Marines next? 😂
I still think they shoulda made him run the 3 miles lol
Just remember it’s the American marines and not the Royal Marines,so not as impressive as you think 😂😂😂😂😂
At least on that last run they let him fireman’s your big ass instead of the vertical carry. Dude would have tabled over 😂😂
You just earned a subscriber🖕🏽🖕🏽!!
This guy might be the most genuine and honest athlete on the planet. Always willing to show both sides of his coin.
0:02 - umm what’s going on right there? Looks like he’s got his hand on his no no square
I wish this would have been a thing when I was in. Would have been a cool experience for sure
As a fellow ‘Scouzeerr’ this man is as real as a sunset and sunrise... get behind him as he is the new Peoples Champion   Much love paddy  Liverpool   xoxo
Keep goin lad. You're an inspiration.
I’ve never felt like crying when someone gives someone a gift, but paddy talking to big burly men and being as real as he could be was amazing. When they have him the token I felt kinda teary eyed   Amazing video <3
Lmao bro u got a fuckn youtube? I am so sorry brotha😅🤣 just subbed. Also. Thats 2018 bit makes me hopeful and nothing has in a while. Thank you for using your platform for good😤 also. That m16 bit was great that's like an average American trying to name the UK countries 🤣🤣🤣
i so wish i would have followed my dad into marines.
that right there is what women who want to transition will never understand. the long term commraderie between warrior type or physical men, like bo or sweatstink and your mates fing with you about it. But everyone laughts and keeps going. men being men. i wish they could.
The Marines are so weak😂😂😂😂
Excellent guy he is. Well done Pudy 👏
Song?
Paddy the beast!
Paddy you are a cool dude my friend awesome!
1.22
Very class video, from start to finish. I didnt expect the post fight conversation, this is my first encounter with Paddy and it made me a fan instantly.
7:31 this katagatame was sick
This was a great!
9:40 Never even cracked a smile. The man really is a baddy
Those Marines showed tremendous tact and disciplined restraint with Paddy.. I'm glad he was able to experience an adjusted workout and pass on a little knowledge.
Paddy so much thicker framed than you think he is
Great Work As Always 💯
Your an inspiration to everyone believe me your the best 👌  You will chance so many ppl lives you already have so keep doing what your doing lad your the next GOAT 👊👊👊👊👊👊
Your not called the baddy for nothing your the next biggest thing in the ufc I would love tickets to come see you lad Your my 2 sons hero  Respect bro love you lad 👊👊👊👊👊👊
Thank God you didn't go to Camp Lejeune! Don't drink the water 💯💯💯
Excellent video. First time I see ya. Brilliant. Y’all marines put up more of a fight than I thought!
“As I say, sorry I’m so fat lad” 🤣
Ayooooooo as a former 0311 seeing this was wild! I'm the same when it comes to the size of somebody, I'll fight anyone.
He like conor mcgregor but actually likeable.
10/10 content!
The most dangerous person you can be is someone with nothing to lose.
When can u jump in the ring an beat up FLOYD Mayweather
the few, the gay, the marines
Paddy 🌲🦅🌲
From violence to silence, paddy is such a good and open guy man..
I thought that was Carson Wentz
*i hate to say I'm a fat bastard* no your good lad had me dead
Sorry lad I'm a fat bastard 😂😂
paddy putting on the padding
Having watched a few of Paddy’s vids now, the lad is growing on me.  Wasn’t sure what to make of him initially, but I must say Im becoming a fan. Seems like a fun, stand up guy. Well done mate, and continued success in and out of the octagon!
PADDY RESPECT SUPERB 👍
O hell yeah
I still hadn’t made up my mind on whether or not I liked this guy… thought he was a bit of a goof. Watched this… he’s not a goof.  He’s goofy, but not a goof.  There’s a difference.  Like him….
I can already tell I'm gonna love this guy
Paddy the baddy is my favorite UFC fighter BY FAR! Mans is just so genuine and takes it seriously but also is able to joke around and have a good time with his training. If you ain’t having fun, you ain’t doing it right. Especially seeing his transformations it really motivates me to keep up with my body and start fighting. When he said “you gotta believe no one can beat you” I felt that. Paddy, keep doin what you doin man; I’m always rooting for you in the octagon 🤙🏼🤙🏼🤙🏼
“Absolutely sweating me lid off”
Cool as fuck.
Paddy is awesome
He a real one
All the women watching are getting soaked in their own monsoons.
this guy looks like the honey monster
Paddy looks like Mr.Perfect. Both legends
Why fat?
Good stuff.
Got so much respect for you Paddy, please don't be so hard on yourself you are amazing!
Respect paddy 💙
More like Paddy The Faddy am I rite?! Love ya bud keep up the great work!
just found his yt channel shit is awesome
Bad ❤️
Good tan Paddy
Wicked 🖤💜😎⚡
Apologizing for his weight, and he's not even fat. He's a pretty healthy 200 pounds. He's just not as fit as he would be while training for a fight when he gets shredded.
Dude is so awesome!! Would love to meet him
How you can tap? Go sleep, go sleep
👍Very good vid!
Respekt für alle!!!!!!
Conner who? The best personality in the UFC.
This fella is growing on me a lot
Why does he always sound like he's asking a question? Weird.
Should do something like this with the Royal Marines.
Patty give me motivation every time he speaks on mental health. He is so inspirational. Thanks patty
Glad to see you muck it out lad.
crazy the baddy is teaching marines edit: youre a fckin machine man
Paddy making that yt money
LOl dude said 5 minute rounds and the guy was like uhhh i got minute rounds what you want me to do?
I want to see him compete on the rifle range against 10 Marines
Anyone know name of the song?from middle of video?thanks
Friggin Awesome Content.
Anyone know what song is playing at around 2:23 ?
What impresses me the most is that any Americans can understand what he's saying.
Respect to these Marines. Clearly losing to Paddy, but they’d probably handle 99.9% of the population just fine.
sick vid
This guy is amazing . I wanna see him make to the top.
Worst video cut ever. ! Congrats on ruining what looked like a fun video to watch !
It's refreshing to see this as our society has been geared towards the independent woman, putting men in a spotlight of shame and disgust in the eyes of society. Men have been making it happen since the beginning of time. The term surviving a species is real for a reason. Today's men don't have outlets to relieve the mental anguish we carry, especially men conducting or coming home from war. You can't possibly know what shooting a child because that child would have killed your friends feels like. That's 1 example of the unfathomable they deal with. Paddy is the light that guides in the shadow of death. To all my dudes going through the shit, talk to someone, it will save your life.
I’m so sorry I’m fat!! 😂
Not knocking his skills, but for Marines who's job it is in part to kill and survive, they sure had a massive failure to see they had a direct shot at his nuts, if your life is worth anything in combat you smash those nuts.
I like how they all treat him as a friend from the start not some big celebrity
It amazing how he knows at any minute he could get put to sleep by anyone. (His example was a 14 year old) But still has the mindset he can beat anyone. That to me should he is humble but confident. 2 very good qualities to have as a human. When talking about mental health this is what the military needs as a spokes person. Most of the chain of command in large settings only see you as a number. They teach you to hide your issues for the mission. What they don't understand is that it hurts the mission in a greater way in the future. Great work my good lad great work.
Love the double middle fingers at 1:20 😂
Thanks for raising awareness Paddy - do your thing mate.
Semper fi Marines!
How can you not love this guy? Paddy is amazing to watch and to hear. Seems to have a great perspective of life and how he can help influence and inspire others who look up to him. Knows that he is a role model and truly giving his time to others is great to see. Just gained a fan for life!
Dude took the chance celebrated while he grabbed Paddys balls 😂 7:19
This is one of the best videos I’ve watched in a long time
Legend
I enjoy the vid. Paddy is a good person treats others well. He has great graphling skills.
...best video this summer!!💥💯..so inspiring!..Thank you🙏
Not only did Paddy roll up 10 marines but 10 marine raiders at that. Some of the corps finest. What a lad
You are a boss lad. Can't wait to see a belt round your waist son. Get up paddy!!!!!!!!!
You're not even fat. You're in great shape but for some reason all the weight goes on your face and you look fat😅. I love how nice he is. Constantly saying sorry for being fat what an OG🤣
Fucking love it 😀  nice one paddy 👏. Big respect to those men and women for protecting their country . That is real  hero stuff right there 👏 ❤️
No one:  Paddy’s middle finger:🖕
“I have the balance of a ballerina, but weigh like a sumowrestler”😂
Paddy the Baddy = legend! Me and my mates do a shot every time you say lad [get proper fooked] :'D
First time watching you, really enjoyed your vlog style videos. especially the food ones. Keep up the grind.
Sorry I'm so fat lad. That's his new catch phrase I guess
I love Paddy man I don't know how many times I heard him say I'm sorry  I'm so fat lad 😂
Wow the US marine truly suck lmao they couldn't beat 1 guy  even when he is tired and does less training than them
once took 10 marines, had to get my stomach pumped the next day
Nice video from starting to ending, nevertheless as the economy crisis keep rising, one needs to have different streams of income, a well detailed diversified investment portfolio in the financial markets is needed to survive, as well as secure a profitable investment future!
Wrestling is great. Maybe we could see you and the Rock in a bout.
Wow, he is such a good performer!
ksi can fuck off about 2 fights in a night paddy just grappled 10 marines back to back
Love paddy
He sounds like a regular Nice guy.
Sound geezer
That was beautiful to see. Just shows you how technique overcomes aggressiveness
Paddy ain't so bad.
When a civilian Can beat every single marine, one by one..
Paddy submitting 10 fit marines in a row just shows that pros are pros for a reason 😳
Imagine getting called a bastard then getting dabbed up at the same time
‘As I say sorry I’m so fat like’   ‘Nah you good’🥵🥵💀
You´re the best, thank you for that amazing video!
Don't think all that grappling would work very well with multiple rounds being dumped into your body at point blank range.  That's dangerously bad. Hand to hand combat vs a lead slinger.
I already agreed with Paddy’s politics  but having watched this, my respect for him has grown. Speaking as a former mental health social worker of 28 years my respect for his honesty and insight has grown exponentially. When he’s hung the gloves up he definitely has a future as a professional enabler. I would love to see him win everything in UFC and beyond.  Respect to him for putting himself through this btw: knackered after a long one and carrying the weight, no fun.
Absolute legend.
I like this guy. seems cool
Paddy man you're just amazing. I be thinking about cutting my wrist sometimes and losing my hope but then i look you lad i get hopes to live me life lad . I start to believe in myself now thankyou man
Paddy vs Nate Diaz would be fire 😮‍💨
Mental health is a real issue I wish it was easier for men to open up about. I was kinda depressed last year then I got into a accident that probably changed my life forever at 21 years old I broke my right hip and femur and had to get everything replaced on my right side and I got even more depressed when it happened and it got to a point where I want to harm myself then one morning I just couldn’t take it anymore and I opened up to my gf at the time and a therapist and I just really told them everything how i felt an ever since then i’ve felt a lot better.
You are a legend Paddy I’m rooting for you
Damn I'm subbing to this baddy!
Ha 10 - 0
I jst heard an american say gnarly
Paddy don't ever let the money and fame go to your head. Absolute top bloke.
think you’re the first ufc fighter who actually makes genuinely good youtube content
I mean this from a pure delusional fan perspective when I say this but when I watch these guys fight in that octagon I think I can hang with them and a twisted fantasy forms in my mind that I should try to get into mma but then you see a pro fighter man handle 10 marines in a row and I’m quickly shot back down to reality 😂 cheers to paddy for being one of the realest in the sport we appreciate you big man!
Paddy, mate I've only recently discovered you but man you are inspiring, you are a living legend!
Paddy is actually the fucking man
National fucking treasure you are lad 👍🏽💙
Christ Jesus is Lord over all. Respect where respect is due Paddy is a great fighter true enough. Those we're Young Marines beginners/ on the contrary 10 experienced veteran full size Marines and Paddy would have tapped don't hate everyone knows it 🤠.
don't usually subscribe, but you earned it. get it
Paddy is the kind of fighter you root for even if it’s against your loved one
That was brilliant. Well done Paddy, and fantastic hospitality from the marines too.
Him apologizing for being fat every time someone picks him up is hilarious
This is my first video watching this Paddy guy and I have to say, I'm subscribed now.
One tough scouser! To go against those Marines wow.  Seals next Paddy. Not sure you'd win there though.
hes a monster
now knife fight
Paddy just watching this from Ireland. I love what you are doing. I’m 51 and think this is very inspirational. Just wanna say thanks and give kudos ,,😂👍👍👍
Fantastic lad
I,ve been suffering in silence for years and it's took you and Tyson Fury to make me have the courage to go and see a professional.Thanks for the kick up the arsenal Paddy.
Uh oh paddy's on the west coast
Love it 👏🏻👌🏼💪🏽
paddy is a f’ing comedian wholesome guy ngl
Great video!
Shitty shaky cam, why shake the camera every second?
Thanks Paddy 😊
Never heard of Paddy till now, and wow he's the man we all wish we could be, very respectable individual, and the things you could learn from him are mind blowing! My one question tho.. I know Paddy is very good at what he does as UFC, but he took down all the Marines? shouldn't they be trained for situations like MMA combat in the field, like I mean surely not every fight involves a gun or knife
Respect, Paddy!
... woulda got me 'ed punched in.  Lol, earned a sub, sir. 😂
Robots. Except for Paddy. He's a professional robot.
even if you hate him you cannot hate paddy. fuck twitter
Miltary combative is trash.
1on1 he schools them easily
That means paddy just killed 10 guys in combat
what is the name of the Song?
Awesome.
Fu@#ing love this kid
Paddy the faddy Grappling machine
How does this have more views than Andrew Tate?
Paddy is a great guy and fighter.. Germany loves you..... Greetings from Germany 💪💪💪 P. S a great video
Awesome video 👍
Catch him week before a fight tho
just watched the video and like and subscribe this guy's is the true meaning of a warrior and such an inspiration keep up all the hard work @paddythebaddy
Good man.
Well deserved challenge coin
I'd mess you up lad . Sub you in the first 2 minutes lad. You'd cry in the corner lad .
Genuine human, amazing fighter, brilliant Brit  Lets goooooooooo
i know the entire world laughs at the current US military but before they lost the GWOT some of the dudes were actually pretty tough
Im exhausted watching this, god damn Love how casual that dude said "stalemate" while he is locked up like a mofo 🤣  These people are something else, absolute weapons
He looks like Owen Hart
Paddy the baddy reminds me of my son. Jolly bastard.
It'd be weird that in a real combat situation, your enemy taps out and pulls out his gun.
Man Paddy's fkn huge
paddy once tapped out 10 marines in 5 minutes.  respect
Awesome
Semper fi. Rah. E5 vet
I started with judo myself then mauythai then wing chung.  But my son i want to start with jiu jitsu then cross to muay thai . And he's hard af at the age of 2 alrdy.. challanging the 4 yr olds @ jiu jitsu already
I truly appreciate you taking a day with these Marines, I can promise you it meant the world to them & they'll be using "that time we trained with a UFC fighter" as a pick-up line on easy women for years to come.  TBH - I have NO idea who you are, just stumbled across this vid - but I'll be finding out.   Since retiring (8071 ret' '02) I've filled my time with kids and family.  You seem like a class act.  Can't wait to catch-up on your career & watch you in the future.
Camp Pendleton is 60+ miles from San Diego. It's in San Clemente where Nixon lived and Ryan sheckler is from
What a classy guy. Paddy, you fucking badass.
Such a quality geezer fairplay to the marines 🔥🔥
2:20 🤣🤣
Simplified respect all day, love to see more. 👊🏼
Paddy “little five minute rounds”
would be fun af to roll around with him.
baddy low key preping for an full blown orgy
Wow man kid is incredible
Sorry im so fat 😂
Paddy, how was it training with the baddest military branch on the planet compared to your typical training day? How would you rate their overall conditioning,  compared to your gym training partners?
There really is a difference between athlete shape and military combat shape. Military combat shape requires you to be the perfect balance of strong enough to carry your battle buddy out of harms way but still have the endurance to hike/run miles and then still have the ability to hit targets and control breath to take accurate shots.
Dude is literally a god
He’s the man
Awesome guy you are Paddy.
To me the biggest problem facing the military is this myth that the best warriors are like robots, emotionless, shut down.  Someone who is humble, grounded and has wrestled with their own demons like Paddy is so much more dangerous and effective, and that's why the 'rines respect him.
Gotta love ya man! Look forward to seeing much more of you're amazingness!! Total beast man
So many middle fingers. I love it 😂
Dang he took out all those Marines
7:21 - 7:25 made me chuckle
"Sorry lad, I'm fat bastard" 😂
Paddy.  I like you.   Keep Winning and making us laugh.
Just think Jake Paul wants to fight Paddy lmao i would pay to watch that fight Paddy would smoke Jake
9th crime 4 life!!!!
Paddy, if this is the real you, you are growing on me. Please continue to be the same way in the ufc?
Excellent!!  Thanks
within the first 3 seconds i seen a marine grab paddys junk and yell “WOoOoO”.. im off 💀
Take on a seal.
Paddy taken over
Top Grappling skills. It's awesome to see a Scouse lad come so far. Max Respect!
If you want be the best train with the best. Take my word Marines. Stay in, it sucks bad out here against our current tyrant govt. You get out and they take very freedom you fought for.
Paddy's packin' the pounds! One hundred too many cheeseburgers methinks.
Those devildogs need to sound the fuck off! Unsat!
You're a legend mate, thanks for being such a great advocate as you are. You rock
God Bless the USMC! Semper Fi MURICA’
Did 7 years in the Marines.  Dont regret one minute
Paddy just grabs the challenge coin from his hands like its pickn'mix is so fucking funny to me, the military has ruined my sense of humour smh
I just want to say sorry I’m so fat😂😂😂
i dont miss this training XD. so happy to see you doing this!
Paddy just earned a follower. Great work 👏 👍
Keep on keeping on 🤴🏼
Bet would love the boots. So comfortable.
I click every video wondering what state of ripped-fatty-ripped transition he is currently in.
Haha alright you’ve won my heart over paddy. Props
Love Paddy. I hope hes on top for 14 years straight...
This is a great video paddy, love you working our soldiers and it’s mutual working out. Great stuff
"Showing them a little bit of jew-jitsu"
Taking on HS company ... real tough.
When paddy wants to cut weight before a fight, he goes the camp pendleton now
Seeing patty go from laughing having fun and going thru a strenuous workout to being a perfect teacher is a trip
Nice 90s cut
The goat
This is like a Kung Fu panda training montage
What's the music when paddy destroys the marines ?
How can you not like Paddy?  Enjoy seeing him have so much success.
Favorite fighter so humble and inspiring 👏
@7:11 “Reset” 😂😂 Yeah right
Awesome Patty earned the respect of Marines! He's an amazing guy! OORAH!
What song is it? I tried to find "don't make me lose my mind" ~ didn't find it.
Cool video. Who is this guy? Never hear of him before now.
What a marine morale boost but having an international badass come and knot'em up and make fun of them. I say that completely unsarcasstically
This was an amazing video.
Paddy is goofy looking and extremely deadly, I love it
I don't know how anyone couldn't like this guy. He's a badass, but has a big heart, great work ethic, and a great sense of humor.
Paddy u messed them
I have always been a fan of and had respect for Paddy as a fighter and as a man. Now i have even more respect for him. Thank you for training some of my brothers and i appreciate you know permanently hurting any of them. Stay safe and keep winning 🙏.
Best sub I’ve gave in ages!!  Paddy is sick beauty status for sure!!!
Best training he could of ever gotten
Lmao mcmap needs to be updated
Super star in the making
Reeeeessppect!!! U did that punishing workout then rolled with them consecutively?!?!? Shiiiiit ur cardio is VICIOUS!!!
Let’s get him with some grunts🥱
7:09 Guys completely mounted in a triangle and goes, "Stalemate? Reset?" Too funny.
What a brilliant idea to have a UFC fighter as skilled as Paddy to help train our Marines. Wish i was still in to learn from him. Our war fighters never stop learning how to kill.  Just goes to show you how skilled Paddy and the USC fighters. I would liked to have seen a Marine get a win but definitely didn't expect it.
Paddy, why gaining more weight? I think there are great fighters in ur category that u have yet to beat or be beaten, who knows. Why u want that meat? Respect for this deed, anyway.
Can’t feel bad about losing to Patty if none of them could
The super earnest "...As I say, sorry I'm so fat, man" fucking SLAYED ME
"I have to say, sorry I'm so fat" lmaoooo
Didn't know i needed this channel. Your boy's were right this makes great content! Awesome talk at the end of training too!
I wonder how hard the drill sergeants messed with em after Paddy bested 10 in a row
Paddy's q&a at the end was very true , you don't have to carry your burdens alone , talk to someone ,
You can tell just by his attitude here is that he real to himself and humble. Before this and even after this I can tell he takes his fights with Honor. And that's what true champions are made of, the only thing gonna separate him from other fighters is there mindset. Wasnt a fan of paddy but think ima have to watch his next fights. You go Paddy.
I wish I was as fat as Paddy
Every person who has to carry paddy "hey sorry I'm such a fat bastard mate"😅😅😆
I’m such a fan!
He conquered all of Europe !👏
Brill
paddy you're a fucking sensation man!!
as soon as it was him vs the usmc you see his head switch and you see how in control he is of his body
The goat
If youve ever seen action bronson’s “**** that’s delicious” id love to see you make a show like that
freaking paddy the baddy even liking and commenting posts. what a fucking champ
Now fight 10 ppl who are your weight! Lmao
🤣 I just have to say...🥹 Sorry I'm so fat🥵
Awe man, I wish Paddy would come teach us how to fight at wainwright.
Paddy isn’t fat at all. Dude’s too hard on himself.
Gotta love the man , Loved you the moment you poped up on my screen , confidence and everything , keep doing you my man and being a real one
Just got out in January, watching this made me miss the community and workouts we had. Good shit Paddy!
2:50 you’re about 50 pounds lighter. America starting to rub off on him
I will say, that I never understood how insanely in shape I was endurance wise when I was in. You get used to it and you’re in a group of peers that are also in shape for the most part.  7 years since I got out and I couldn’t imagine doing the same shit now.
Bro was just lowkey initiated into the marines 😂they finna call him next month like “we need you in North Korea my boy!” 😭lmao
He jacked their wheels faster than he submitted them- go on Scouse!!!
Fucking love paddy his attitude and personality is amazing, so down to earth and don’t give a shit what he says especially when it comes to the dark stuff he’s been threw,   Mental health is hard to deal with especially when you’ve had to be strong all your life as that’s what’s always expected of you by others which makes it harder to talk about things, paddy keep doing what you do best lad you’re a great person
Your words are powerful like your fighting.ty for speaking up for us men with mental health issues. blessings paddy.u will be ufc champ one day.i can't wait to see that fight RESPECT YOUR A FOOKING SAVAGE
Hey Paddy next time you're in San Diego get a Chimichanga, it's a deep fried burrito with sour cream and guacamole.
This was awesome
What they said 🥰😊
Good editing.
Paddy: pick a partner of a similar size, you don't wanna be grappling with someone that's 20 kilos heavier than you. Paddy then proceeds to tap out ten marines one after the other weighing 20 kilos more than every one of them. 😂 All jokes aside, keep up the good content Pad, ya mad lad.
I’m glad Sam Tarley turned it around
Love the video, and a Frank Bentley song getting exposure like this is also awesome! 👌
Pause at 7:21 kinda sus🤣
People severely underestimate how difficult it is to fireman-carry a 200lb man.
Man I wish I had fellowship and resources to spar. Pattyyyyyy help me get some rollin in brother😂😂😂
Paddy apologizing to everyone who carried him for being fat mid run is hilarious 🤣
his cheeks got smaller from the beginning to the end of the video
paddy you aint fat, fuck those memes, you are a legend mate
Paddy, continue to spread your message. You made a big impact on a room full of leaders. Your message will have exponential effects. Much love mate💪🏻
You just earned a new fan, bro. Awesome work
Paddy the baddy is like "I won't apologize for being overweight when I'm not training" Also Paddy the baddy every time a marine picks him up "Sorry im such a fat bastard"   This dude is hilarious, genuine, and entertaining through n through. I hope he continues to rock the fight world
Song ?
These guys are usmc sgts. Baddy is a serious talent. Really impressive.
#9: Stalemate? Reset? Paddy: Nah, I’m about to end this.
Why does this "Workout" look more like getting smoked.
Haha
Dude is underrated I'm telling this guy gonna be a problem 💯
imagine fighting for the USA. lol cringe af
That girl really wanted you to carry her hahaha
What an awesome bloke 👍
With or without guns?
I THOUGHT IN THE THUMB NAIL WAS A CROC ON THE NECK
God I love this guy.  Complete package, warrior, mentor, outstanding human being.  Semper Fi Baddy Paddy.
2:38
Pappy is a baddie by gowd.
Seeing boots on the mat hurts me.
Good video bud... Such a fan dude.. you real are the rising shinning ⭐
Badass😎
I was just putting off my chores, but god damn Paddy, you're an incredible ass dude, and good on you for beating all of them after a badass workout.
Paddy every 10 minutes, “sorry I’m so fat mate” 😂
Paddy is amazing to watch in the octagon and amazing to watch in videos like this. The man is real and has a such a genuine demeanour.   Keep doing what you're doing lad, whether that's in or outside of the ring.
basic error crossing ankles while getting the back...
Wow, what a moral booster - they don't have Milley telling them that they're all racists and should wear lipstick. Instead, they get this very likeable fighter, someone they can relate to.
Monster 😎
Sorry so fatt,😭🤣🤣
They call me "Patty the Fatty"  I live up to it like you do brother big fan, I've made tons of money of betting on ya I've gotta come out to your next fight to show support 💯
Bah bah bah
Im just here for the insecure comments
I have never even come close to the caliber of fighter that paddy is, but as a former marine it kinda brings me a little joy to see him struggling with some of the intense workout routines they had us doin
Some fucking boy you Paddy. Respect from Yorkshire x
If I would be the last marine fighting him and get smeshtt like that,I would start having my own mental issues. 😄 Well done! Good luck in UFC.!
The way he said “sorry lad im a fat bastard” while hanging off his shoulders as he is doing the squats was comical af
Nice one Paddy la
Paddy apologizing for being fat made me feel fat af fr haha mad respect for u m8 keep inspiring!!
What’s the name of the song when paddy takes on the marines yo?!🙏🏼
This guys a beast! Great guy!
This man is disgusting

Semper Fi Devil Dogs!!  Great Video Paddy Team!!!
Legend
Nice guy
"The best there is... the best there was and the best that will ever be !!" - Bret Hart
Next he needs to roll with the Marine wrestling team.   Might be a little different outcome.. 🤔
size of you now hahaha
Every man that opens up as a result of your promotion of men's mental health is your greatest victory. You are a great man and deserve every ounce of success you get for hardwork, and determination.
Go on Paddy!
Soon as this guy face any ranked striker he’s going to sleep
“I just wanna say sorry I’m so fat” “No you’re good” lmfaooo
While your in America go shoot some guns
Paddy, you would be unstoppable if you trained like that all the time. Damn fine job, Paddy! FC2 USN (Ret)
Paddy is not a fatty. Paddy is a fuckin baddy.. let's go boys
2018 was tough as well. Really honest awesome accent
This was awesome! Marines didn’t shit on paddy and listened to all his teachings and paddy didn’t shit on the workout and have the marines props for having insane workouts.
nice wrestling paddy! just be glad you werent fighting for your life because you would have gone 0-10 😂
Paddy, this is the first video of your that I've watched and you are an absolute beauty!  Keep these coming man!
Now go to the 500 yard line
sorry i’m so fat lad 😅
Bestia
Osp choke at the end?
He's the real deal isn't he !! That marines really wanted to beat him , even after nine he still smashed them gooo on lad !!!
Humble isn’t the word, keep doing what you’re doing Paddy.
Unreal vid
Let’s just hope America and England don’t become enemies… otherwise you’ve got Paddy the Baddy to face!!!
That Q&A session was very endearing and touching, thank you for being open about your struggles and keeping it down to earth. Sounds like you have had great mentors and support around you.
Huge fan of Paddy great guy 👍🏽
Ah.. Now I know why Paddy walks round at 200lbs... Just incase he has to battle a squad of Marines.
not fat..........happy
I’m slowly starting to understand his accent😂😂
Probably lost in the sea of 10k comments, but just wanted to write something anyway.   End of your last fight when you were chatting about all the mental health stuff and that, it did a lot. I was watching it with the lads and there was a genuine chat after it about everyone and telling everyone to give us a shout if there's any problems. Actually top class
Cool stuff.
More like Paddy the fatty. lol Great watch, badass!
Was a fan already, but even more so now.  US Army retired and would love someday to roll with you.  All the best in your career.
Why Looks Paddy so faddy? Smash some steroides?🤨
random youtube recommendation, watched the whole vid without a skip, subscribed. good lad.
Paddy is a cool B@D@SS 🙂
Ahhhhh, but "Paddy don't shoot"
Whats the song around 6:50 or so??
🐛 🐛 🐛 🐛 🐛 🐛 🐛 🐛 🐛 🐛 🐛
Weak as marines 😂 should be taxi drivers In stead
“Marines”
The apologies 😂
Lying in bed, off work with a broken finger feeling sorry for myself. Inspired me to get up and try and do some kind of exercise! Paddy,s a great bloke!
ron got hands
I love that the greatest there was and the greatest they every will be thing. Not only is it an amazing mindset but its also very cool to me as a wrestling fan. something Brett Hart used to say during his wrestling career and his little brother Owen hart looks identical to paddy. RIP Owen
Love this guy. He’s such a better, more humble version of Connor and I hope vast success, health, and fortunes for this man and his family. No one deserves it more than this individual in the UFC right now
Paddy deserves a like👍
im from germany and i have hard times understanding what you say but i love that stuff m8, its bloody amazing
I wanna thank YouTube’s algorithm For getting this video to my front page lol
making marines look bad 🤧
This was cool!
The guy in charge reminded me of Jamie Foxx in jarhead lmao. Great vid
The girl was upset for a second when he said no to carrying her
did he really spoken english during the video ??
Real one
This is the proof there's a difference between Paddy and people like Conor McGregor and Colby Covington. They are shitty humans. I'm sick of hearing you have to be an arrogant piece of shit to be successful in MMA. Paddy is being himself and he rocks.
Paddy your a great human
“Sorry I’m so fat lad” 😂
"Sorry I'm so fat man" 💀💀
It’s soo hilarious paddy constantly apologising for his weight
It is impossible not to like this man!! Keep up the good work Paddy and the honesty!!
Well marines practice close fighting techniques but not alot of them. They mostly practice in ranged fighting because they think the enemy won't get that close.....but it dose happen.
What a legend! Class act that Paddy is
we love you here in nijmegen holland paddy i hope your gonne be champ verry soon good luck with that task paddy.😎
that " sihh " killed me 🤣🤣
This dude is just real af. Subbed.
Jon jones without the drugs
Boots 🤣
Hey man it’s refreshing to see such a genuine celebrity man just a good dude love you man excited to see where ya go
Would have loved to see him do this when paddy/he is in shape!
This is the kind of UFC champion we need. Someone who’s a role model of this guys magnitude would be great for every kid and adult who ever seen him.
I know fighters that actually deserve to be where he is. He is a sloppy pos
Paddy is joke
Paddy looks stoned to the gills
Well said Colin. Take care.
Khamzat in the corner with a green shirt.  😈
Ahora que pruebe con Ellos a ver quién maneja mejor las armas de fuego.
Dude! 10/0 well done Paddy! Subscribed
You give me hope bro... Your attitude is amazing, I'm schizophrenic so shit it a little harder on me, but I see you talk bro, and I get pumped up
Paddy, You don't look fat, you look healthy. I was sent here by Coach Greg Doucette. Great video. Thanks.
now lets see him with some royal marines
This looked great! I'd love to get that circuit if someone can write it out if they know it!
I wonder where and for how long Paddy has been training bjj.. he’s really good
Top guy, very likeable! 👍
Amazing video
Humble man. Heart of gold!!!
How to win over everyone: every single video on this channel. This channel is like a course on the right combination of humility, empathy and confidence.  Only the greatest respect, Paddy.
Such a sick video. Keep going Paddy you've got the world behind you.
Paddy is the TOP G
2:59 😂😂😂😂😂😂
How can you not love this lad! <3333333333
My son was in the marines.. He fell from a height and tore a ligament in his hip, nobody believed him and now he is disabled, until he can afford surgery to repair the damage.  To all marines, Thank you for serving the country. To the assholes in the marines that caused my son's injuries, you are fortunate to have the safety of numbers and when you are the victim. You will remember that you deserve to be broken!
I hate lunges too, Paddy. Only came here cause of Greg… I’ll be watching you more now, great content
train like that everyday with his skill and he could become a goat!
Ur so funny dude😂
Damn this vid has blown up, big up Paddy, deserves all the popularity he is getting
I wish I could tell my younger self to stay in shape, not saying I gave up but if I knew then what I know now I would have focused more.
"sorry I’m so fat"🤣
Mate this was fantastic. Not only are you a proper beast but your attitude towards mental health issues is amazing. A problem shared is a problem halved.
Impressive young man.
Holy shit he got a challenge token. Not too familiar with American forces but I know that those tokens are real shit
You can tell Paddy Genuinely cares and i've always loved how real paddy is, he just doesn't care what anyone thinks and just speaks his mind.
Legend!
Its crazy how much better pro fighters are than even very strong men who are also trained to fight. He literally tapped 10 badass marines in a row. Most of those guy would kill any regular dudes and he took them all out even tired as hell.
I feel like paddy just found out about the middle finger. He was over using it a bit. But I respect it. Legend
beautiful
They are all black belts too😳
Those squats and lunges A1. This  was great
Paddy makes mcgreggor look like an asshole! Not hard tho!
PLEASE DO AS PADDY SAYS JUST TALK TO SOMEONE 👍🇬🇧
That was FUCKING impressive
Respect for Paddy sticking it out with the Marines, can't wait to see him back in the ring !
You noticed how much he pulled his punches while hitting the pads people held for him. He realized his own strength.
Much respect! Happy to see good people come together to learn and grow! Earned my sub bubba
This wouldn't have happened if john cena was there
Incredible video, much respect from this Marine! Keep up the awesome work in and out of the ring.
Paddyy said I have the balance of a ballerina dancer and the weight of a sumo wrestler lol
That was filled with so much positive emotions, i really do respect Paddy.
Now you wanna go train with the SAS even the navel seals can't handle that
Paddy you’re not fat lad. Don’t listen to what haters have to say about you. You’re a true warrior
Loved it man
You should do what you done with the British marines,I'm sure they'd like it aswell.
Does anyone know that song when paddy is taking on the 10 guys?
Bad ass!!!  Way to stay positive!!!
Really thoughtful gifts that were heartfelt 👍
Damn paddy looking more jacked than usual
I served there for 5 years good on you paddy I suffer with deep depression and many other ailments. You truly are a genuine person man and you dig DDDEEEEPPPPP!
Paddy #1
How cute...A UFC fighter that all gay men can love
What a real dude.  I don't typically give 2 shots about pro athletes however for him to do this for those marines is huge even if he doesn't know it.  They will remember that forever, to get to roll with a pro champion and a real dude to take the time to talk to them like he did speaks volumes about him as a person.
If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.   (1 John 1:9) - We are all sinners. Believe in Jesus Christ, Repent and be saved.
Has Paddy meant to put on weight? He’s chunkier than I’ve ever seen him.
Love how paddy talks about mental health and his struggles after he taps out 10 trained killers
Such a lovable down to earth genuine person very rare in any sport these days
Paddy teaching the marines techniques that actually work. Mcmap sucks lol
Paddy the fucking baddy!
Guys a legend him on a bad day still Merced them
What a bad ass 👍
We all have mental health issues, some are strong enough to face it and find a way, but some are just finding it very hard to cope.
Impressive seeing you in your wheel house giving instruction with expertise vs when they had you doing cardio drill.
Is there a video of this with 10 jujitsu black belts?
Much respect to Paddy for doing this.
And they never took you to the range for some full auto fun WOW
7:21 ayo 🤨
Getting grappling training from him would be so dope.
Paddy is such a classy guy.. The Future UFC Champ..!!!
You are the baddest mother fuckker you can win every thing
"im sorry lad, im a fat bastard" me too fam, me too
Attitude is everything.   "I cannot be beaten."   I can't tell you how many fights I won by making my opponents afraid to fight me.   It was not a bluff either.  I was fully prepared to destroy them. I made sure they knew what was about to happen to them.  It's only fair.
nothing but love for Paddy
1:22
The Champion we need, he really should rally behind the Armed Forces for mental health awareness!
“As I say,Sorry I’m so fat lad!” 😂
one word: sichhh!
Fair play Paddy. Anyone that hears this knows us blokes try n BS our way out of giving our true feelings. Lost 2 pals in the same week so I know your pain sadly. Thanks keep up the good work 👍
Loved the video, Thank you Paddy!
What hejust did is incredible
paddy is awesome
I don't understand what's he talking
yooo content i love this
He wouldn't have it easy with Army we train in combative especially our infantry
Brilliant video 😂
US Marines are no Joke. just the training alone will f×ck you up if you show up unprepared mentally & physically.
blonde brit takes on 20 marines
🐐
Mental health is a real issue and this man is a great advocate for the males who think it’s not a problem
I think the marines should learn some jiu jitsu
I love how he's amazed by the side of the ammo box and for these boys it's like toilet paper.
Love ya Paddy, what a great advocate for the sport and mental health! 🎉 The sport needs a normal, humble dude like this, especially after GSP retired.
Nice to watch all this training, but The video is shaking too much
Shit, I even got tired watching him doing that work out!
So polite as well absolute legend!
Respect for this guy ,such advocate for men’s mental health problem 👏🏾👏🏾🙌🏾
im a ex solider with p.t.s.d and i was too ashamed to ask for help. as i was more concerned about what other people thought about me...untill i heard this young man from liverpool ( where im also from)  say hay it's ok for men to say " I NEED HELP" i took this advice and im now getting the help i need...THANKS PADDY
Fuck yeah brother those are some bad dudes lol
Lol “Sorry I’m such a fat bastard” if I had a nickel
COME back IN 6 MONTHS AFTER THOSE MARINES HAVE been TRAINING THIS WAY EVERY DAY, and it will be a different story.
Humbled all of them
Well done Lad.. Making us all proud... Keep doing what you do..
Your a top bloke Paddy stay genuine lad
man just did 1vs 10 marines be watch out ufc
francis would eat him
I felt that "Sichgh" in the end
No words xept  Much Respect 🫡 🙏
but remember paddy, IRL we dont go to war with hands, we shoot.
Videos real name is: "Paddy makin pretzels"
get him with the SAS training not this pansy stuff
Paddy in California!
Imagine being able to say "yeah i took down 10 marines in a row" what a baller
USMC are as tough as the British Army Our RMC are the best Our Paratroopers are the best Our SAS are the best
What a gem❤️
C'est un tueur 👊👊👊❤️
Now that he's played around with boys send him to the men haha I'm sure buds guys will be a bit more competitive
Paddy! I love you ❤️
Yo Paddy going 10–0 against a gauntlet of marines then going into a mental health awareness moment. Hard not to root for the man for his ability and then also his humility.
1:45 is one of my drill instructors from when I was in MRP thank you for everything SSgt
imagin training with khabib or oliveira ahhahah
Падди чемпион
Awesome!
such a nice guy..you have to love him..
This guy’s quickly becoming my favorite fighter in the UFC. Great advocate for mental health.  Oh yeah and he’s also an elite fighter. Icing on the cake.
Paddy is such a legend. Fucking love the guy. Great advocate for healthy minds and bodies (even if he keeps calling himself a fat bastard)!  Those Marines are another level of fitness and strength, absolute machines of men and women, and Paddy still rolls them up - technique always wins!
You just can't hate the man. Paddy is a good dude.
Thank you Paddy for showing our collective fighting forces of that group of Marines your excellence and determination. I had a little bit of a hard time understanding every word you said, because I speak American English. I used to joke with my ex GF (Dutch background) that I used to have a hard time understanding English English, so she's have to translate it for me, but then I'd have to translate South Park English for her so I guess we were even! (I have a Mexican background but am 100 percent American)
I respect our military but just because someone joined doesn’t make them instantly Superman just sayin but people of skill may vary 😉
The gal wanted it
Champion amongst champions! THANKYOU!
Awesome all around.  Thanks, Paddy.
Want to watch how I become a real man? The Swiss Joe Rogan!!! The self-critical and female-friendly macho. Check it out!!
Still kinda crazy to see those youngsters being pretty weak when you put them to folks from 20 years ago.
All that funding,  I'd expect the rook to make the baddy tap 11 times..
Paddy apologizing for being fat is making lol. 😂
Bro fucking love paddy sorry I’m so fat mate❤️😂😂
💥Lee Marvin Hitchman @ LADbible/ Real Porridge/ Shaun Attwood etc Lah 💯💫😉
Those marines would protect paddy for life now I bet they consider him a brother
Didn't even know paddy was putting up YouTube videos , this one was fire though🤙🤙
lucky motherfuckers
Oh, is it "Paddy the Baddy" ? I always though it was "Paddy the Paddy" which means nothing but  fitted better with his kid face.
Man can this man cut weight. I know it’s not easy but damn he is a professional.
Respect to you Paddy the Baddy!!  You took out 10 of my brothers!  Love that your advocate for mental health as well.  Well wishes & prayers to you! 👊🏼🇺🇸
I hope those « justice defenders » will use your techniques to defend Palestinians against the israelis under men bastards
UFC is secretly trying to keep his weight down in between fights I see lmaoooo
ohhh ohhhh Paaaadddyyyy theeee Baaaaddyyyyy
You Da man…
10:48 I physically shivered and cringed the way Paddy took that coin.
PADDY had #10 knew some Sambo that leg he had in his hands looked really ample for a pelvick / leg stretch
Paddy should apply these training techniques you'd never get winded for sure
God bless Paddy and God bless the Marine Corps!
Paddy “I’m so sorry I’m so fat… lad..”  during the entire video got me dying… 😂😂😂
Dayuum!
this dude is a hobbit. man came straight out of the shire
"Sorry im so fat lad" 🤣
This was so fucking wholesome
Homeless kid here cheering to meet Mcgregor 😅!
them aryan genetics at work
man said "sorry im so fat" while getting carried hahahaha im dead
Guy rolled with 10 combatives pros. Exhausted and still humble as fuck. And talked mental health...You literally can't hate this guy. Everytime I see him I have to give him more respect
Paddy is awesome
Imagine your boy gets shot and as you fireman carry him out he goes “I have too say, sorry I’m so fat lad”
He is the only reason why I started getting back into martial arts.
This is hilarious
GENERAL PADDY... 🇬🇧
Man I would look like a snail id sweat so much lmao
I cried... Thanks Paddy, Sometimes its too much. Watching this helped.
Does anyone know the song during the grappling
paddy is awsome his message toward mental health is amazing
love thus dude man. ooh rah semper fi.
Still stupid. Camera guy needs training
Tapping out smaller guys not a big deal
“sorry ima fat bastard” LMAOO 😂😭💀
They try to wear him out 😂 to have advantage in 1on 1 but he still smoked them in ju jistu !! 🖕Respect Marines for the Brutal Training WhoRah 💯
amazing respect for Paddy and Marines!! their cardio is just top notch!!
I love this mate !!!
10 rounds of Marines, all wins...wtf...AWESOME.
Being a marine I love this
Need more of these videos
Boss tha paddy la #YNWA
Paddy the Baddy blowing the game up with the Scouse charm lad.
What a video, Absolute stud
Paddy is so cool, I'm a fan for life!!!
Made the entire Marine Corps tapout
Helllo @thevalaverse How about Paddy as a new "Action Force" Character?
7:35, anyone?
NEXT EPISODE :  Paddy vs. LGBTQXYZ  Woke Military
good freeking sport     lad
That was a fun watch.
He is fucking huge mate !
Submitted 10 marines in a row? This video is for any delusional individual who thinks about challenging a professional fighter. Paddy said anyone can win a fight 🤣; please don’t get trolled into a coma .
Lad it’s so funny when paddy’s being carried and he just goes sorry am so fat lad🤣🤣🤣
Go on lad
What a lad 👊
Bro you wanna be on paddy’s team in a zombie apocalypse, bro ain’t gonna leave u behind if you’re fat 😂
This should be the recruiting video.
Did you flip the bird every time you had to puke? Mad respect. USA does not mess around.
@2:23 Lets talk about this dudes legendary flag tattoo...
0800? They let him sleep in.
2:40 lmaooo 😂
Good stuff.
"Anyone who's your real friend will care about you" that's a quote if I've ever heard one
That was fun
That was insane he rolled wit a whole marine core... how mad was that
First 3 minutes “I’m sorry I’m a fast bastard”
His attitude is seriously one of the best!
Paddy burning through ten marines in a row,AWESOME 😮
Paddy is awesome! 💙
This put a smile on my face . Thank you Paddy and the Marines
Now imagine khabib doing this
these men are a fragment of what the marines used to be 😭
i love paddy man😁😁🤣
They are masters at breaking people down.
My brahhh! Paddy such a beats man .
🤣🤣🤣 I am so sorry am fat
You have been a huge role model for me. Ever since you spoke out at your fight
Ssgt Castaneda was a drill instructor for my company. Dope to see him continuing to be a badass. He was a sgt when I was in Bootcamp so congrats to him making ssgt.
Paddy is a special person to my heart. Having went thru tough times I can relate.
Bro looks heaps healthier with more weight on. Should fight heavier.
Brilliant.
Gunney Flemming was one of my drill instructors, great guy!
Paddy respect to you opening up like you did
As you can see here, there is Military fitness then there is actual fighters. I hardly passed the ARMY  PT test but ran circles around soldiers in combatives.
Paddy the badditude is everything :)
Bitchen 👍
This video was funny as lad 🤣🤣 when you kept apologising when they were carrying you was jokes 😂😂 I did request a podcast with a ex army person but ill take this this video was sick paddy well done mate
Soddy awm so fott lad.
Paddy the g   https://youtu.be/20n9mfZmPbQ
Bryce Mitchell VS Paddy the Faddy would be so Dope!! Damn....
Never really had an idol before but paddy is kinda becoming mine. What a person.
props to the marines tho to be able to learn fast and some of them were a pretty challenging to paddy during the spars
Gunny Fleming was my DI 😂
Semper Fi to those Marines and Paddy. Not every day the BMFs in the valley meet the BMF fighter from hell. That's a bit of fun I wished I could've participated in. The mental uplift must've been amazing. Our service men and women don't get shown enough love and support. Paddy coming out is huge and I thank him for his time.
I was army, but hella props to baddy for this workout
I love this man
Can't wait till someone smack tf outta fatty mc patty burger , don't hype this cheese ball ,have you seen any fight lately?
what a lad! fair play Paddy
It can't be expressed how great it is that an Alpha like Paddy takes those Marines to task and then bestows some vulnerable life lessons on them that will definitely stick since he earned their respect.  Cheers lad, well done!  Love what you're doing for Mental Health and the sport!
You are just amazing bro love this fighter he is so real and down to earth just a legend much love and respect Paddy 🤟🤟
This is a sick video Paddy keep up the good work and representing your city and country. What you said is Inspirational. Mental health can be a killer keep doing what your doing lad because your smashing it much respect.
Awesome!  The jiu Jitsu competition was great stuff
dude really in a full mounted triangle and said "stalemate'? LMAOOOOOOOO
Bro ur a legend
Roll with The Special Forces next , Those guys are as close to superhero’s as you can get
Not kept up with combat sports for years now. But Paddy has just shot way up in my books after watching this
I love this man. He's such an inspiration
The meaning of been a badass not shitty attitude to show it off
Scouser's Come From A Mystical Land Far Far Aways⁉️ #TrueStory
this is what youtube needs
"As i say, im sorry im so fat lad" got me pissing myself
3:00 As I say, sorry I'm so fat lad, fucking killed me bro
sick video
2:20 really
So he knows jiujitsu?
Thank you sir and Semper Fi.
I love this dude man....
What’s the song 💀
I hope you have continued success, you are a great lad
Daymn a marine workout and rolled with them after off season. That's cardio I didn't know paddy had 👊
Wow, some serious intent going both ways!
now let's throw in some kill or be killed no holds bared combat fighting.
Hey, sorry I'm german (bad english) and I didn't realy know, if you meant UFC as the "Utimate Fighting Championship or "Urea Formaldehyde Concentrate" (Piss) against USMC (United States Mariene Corp?). So or so: for my thoughts I can't get a sense inbetween - 'cause it doesen't fit together in my head. It's more different than challenge a needle with a M16... ^^
Do more of these
Wrapping those big guys up like pretzels just for fun. Like a boa constrictor. Well done Paddy 👏
Keep getting a msg saying Ave won a prize, it seems a bit sus like lad, anyway you can verify 😉👊🏼
He’s so funny
This dude has a cool personality
the lad has the formula, he's making his own name with or without the UFC.
All athletes should do shit like this with troops and first responders. ALL ATHLETES
Love how you keep apologising for your weight when you're being carried 🤣 your awesome Paddy, keep on working hard and winning, also massive respect to those marines 🍻
Absolute legend.
Amazing dude man, mad love and respect for him. ✊🏾
Wonder if paddy bagged himself a wook??
Love this guy absolute savage with a heart of pure gold 👏🏼👏🏼
PADDY IS A AMAZING GREAT GUY!!
Paddy is a man. A boy can't talk. A man can.
Sikh😂
Dont know who this guy is - kinda stopped watching UFC or MMA in general but the first thing I said to myself is - he looks like a young Owen Hart. 10 minutes in - he says "the best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be" and that just put a smile on my face. He's a HART boy alright.
Man, training has changed since I was in, it’s much better! Nice!
nice  you did it right kid !
dude who called stalemate def wanted to be the one...
As a guy who's suffered with mental health my whole adult life this was so good to hear. Massive respect to you Paddy.
Is paddy bulking up or just a little unfit?
I love how he keeps apologizing for being fat lol. Relatable
I swear all army PT sessions are: Make them so tired their body doesnt work properly, then ask them to do a task that uses all the muscles you just destroyed.
Marines have way too much testosterone to learn a style of fighting where if you are on your back and it looks like you’re being banged like a lady, it means you’re winning
Paddy has that Scouse swagger, his mouth runs away but he's such a likeable character and knows his craft. You have to respect that.
W…O…W! The best episode yet!
This should be way more common our troops would gain so much more experience and confidence in they're ability if the forces would setup events to train with pro athletes of all sports. It would bring a different mindset and view to military training and there's literally no downside to it both parties get practice with elite competition.
Love this kid, he’s as real as they come. Good on you Paddy.
wow, awesome well done!!!!!
Class
You did us proud Paddy, I thoroughly enjoyed that thank you
can not beat paddy's attitude / charisma. love this guy
Excellent
Wow, paddy is now a certified heavyweight now..
That's amazing, just the courage to put it out there. We are all fighters, and for sure, let's stop the silence. Sometime we can get to dark, to deep, absolutely sad. Let it out, search help. Congrats for the words+attitude. Cheers!
To be honest I haven’t been the biggest fan of Paddy since he came into the UFC. As a Former U.S. Marine, it’s really humbling to see Paddy taking time out of his schedule to hang out and share his knowledge with those Marines. I’m a fan for sure now. Would love to see a video of Paddy training with the British Royal Marines. Those guys are top notch for sure. Big fan
0:02 WHY? Why is he grabbing his **** I understand that when doing this sport that kind of unavoidable but he is literally resting his hand with open palm on his crotch
Not proper marines, the American kind 😂 but the geezers a machine even if he’s a scouser
This man has to be the nicest, funniets and ofc most talented guy on this platform. Very nice vid too
and now they all have MRSA
Sorry I'm so fat 🤣🤣🤣
much kudos and respect mate 👍
Really good dude. I have alot more respect for him just from watching this.
What an animal!!! 10-0 against marines 👍👏👏👏👏✊
Fucking legend
Sick laa 🇬🇧
Guess paddy gained weight. He looks more filled out.
Dude your awesome 👌
Bro said stalemate in a mounted triangle 😂😂😂
He needs to leave it alone with the “ Ey whack I’m sorry I’m fat lad “ - tedious
That was more impressive than your fights😲 Beat them all 👏👏👏👏 Well done paddy big respect to you and all the marines🇬🇧🇺🇸
PADDY has great ability BUT this demo has established rules. Many openings Marine to punch/grab crotch, finger to eye, even BITE. In hand to hand fight to DEATH I'd take veteran trained 200lb lb 6ft Marine.  .. no offense to Paddy of course.
Boss in the ring, a boss out!
Damn. Idk why I can’t think of his name but the one MAI was one of my SNCO’s on Cherry Point in Comm Squadron.
Paddy just became alot of Marines favorite or one of their favorite fighters.
Imagine going through half your life as an in shape elite athlete and the other half as a chubby cheeks kid apologizing for being a fat ass.   Haha.  Love it.
1 Brit vs a whole squad of marines, I'm cracking up!
usmc tapping out to single arm chokes........wtf...
Keep rockin paddy!
Paddy is a strong soul
3:00 “As I say sorry I’m so fat”   “Nah, you’re good”
Song?
camera mans making me feel fucking sick
imagine Nick Diaz advice and practice like this ..... OMG
Seeing a professional do what they do best is incredible...grappling 10 marines one after the other and getting the tap out
An absolute genuine fella! So good to see you doing well man.
Ip lad vs 10 black belts 🤣
Please give him a show
I like how he flipping his fingers....good exercises!
At 0:43 does he say "now about to get fucked up by some Marine cunts?" and if so why was fucked bleeped but not cunts? Or was it "Marine cats?" Either way he seems like a good lad.
“Sorry lad I’m a fat bastard.“😂😂
Best one yet
Paddy apologizing to everyone who Carries him lmao
💪😎👍💯👌
Big Ups to you Paddy for sharing your real life with our American warriors! Thank you!
N then he got sent to Russia and never to come back
Im trying to become a camera man for youtubers please give me the job
Brilliant video. You deserve all the success in the world Paddy.
Paddy the goat man🐐🐐
Is paddy gaining weight again?
They photoshop this video to make him look fatter.
Great athletes
Wholesome!
Incredible young man!!! Great content xxx
Episode TOO fire 🔥
Paddy agus an bhean! Buachaill maith lol
uhmm, how to you get to believing in yourself??
Because of the economic crisis that always comes up the best thing to be on every wise individual’s mind or list is to invest in different streams of income that’s not depending on the government to generate funds.
Ngl I need some captions with this lmao
Do this once a month!
An absolute man
The Baddy Rollin with the Marine Raiders. Would be a nice trade if they could teach Paddy how to shoot.   (whispers) or blow stuff up xD
That was great.  Good stuff!
Keep it up... Well done
His skill + character + appearence + accent + name = too much for people NOT to like.
8:48 proper choked me up, never seen this guy before but i rekkon those marines will never forget that advice of talking about their mental health to their pals.
Let’s wrestle with khabib
First time viewer.  Great video.  Great way to get these guys to listen and consider that mental/emotional health is just as important as physical health.  You built a lot of respect by doing the insane training and then beating all of them on the mat... you did that and then told them:  I cried every day.  Nobody with any character can call that weak.  You are a beast and you're helping a lot of people by breaking these mental walls.
He is lucky he didnt try to take on the air force!
One of a kind paddy truly inspirational
Marines shouod have taken the socks off paddy is alot smarter. Alot more leverage when you dont have slippy socks on.
Awesome video ✊🏽
Alternative title paddy completes hardest marine circuit and puts every yank whopper on his arse
Paddy is a real good Guy but with absolutely Dangerous skills , i think He will have some realy good and famous years , big Fighter respect to him
Paddy your a legend in the ring and out well done Lad..
I was a MAI in USMC and loved this. Was some of the fondest times in the Marine Corps was doing belt courses all day. Would've loved this experience happy for the Marines who were able to learn something here.
Paddy youre a great lad.
Patty the fattty
Great job 👏
Paddy the wanker
What’s that songs name?
"Sorry I'm So FAT LAD"
Paddy is a fucking beast
Ooorahhh paddy
So fat hh
Paddy is my new favorite fighter . Really cool hanging out with the Marines . Thanks fellas for your service
Every time paddy’s like “sorry lad I’m so fat” I died 🤣💀
Thise lunges are a little half hearted for the marine corps.
When i hit my elbow. Me feeling that current 4:50
Everyone of those soldiers was ripped, in top shape and already good fighters.  He showed why he's a pro.   Great fun vid.
Love this dude, such a great guy and ambassador for the sport 👊
"one of my hardest workouts this week" probably true 🤣
Mans constantly apologising people who carry him that he is fat🤣😭
fuckin animal, he isn't even Human, this man is a Hybrid
Paddy just IRL Imai Cosmo (if yk, yk)
Paddy is the man. Enough said.
Yo, this guy's so funny
m16 bullets 😂
Never heard of Paddy before, but he is definitely a bad-ass if he can beat that many marines. Wow.
No one : Paddy : Sorry i am fat bastard ×3
Paddy the Fatty  😆 Go-on my son.
Grade A fella nice to see a genuinely nice guy doing he’s thing being an advocate for mental health both in the ring and out, goes out he’s way to meet sick fans and take them to fights and events, and a soon to be champion fighter keep it going bro
love paddy even though he was born on the t'other side of pennines! ..imagine how he'd be if he joined them everyday for this..
Paddy the baddies is in need of a bowl of lucky charms
That girl wanted paddy lowkey 😂😂
paddy mate your core values and mindset are so solid man - compassionate and genuine person through and through. amazing
Fucking ace pad 👍
if we separate marines from team work and weaponry they become semi regular, I'd say like a 15% advantage over a regular person that has experience fighting
As a traditional wrestler I can confidently say that striking isn't as important as ground skills and leverage in any kind if fight. Arm bars to limit enemy movements and leg locks are the function.
Marines are thr most unsociable awkward people when they aren't around their kin.
I'm no fighter. I am impressed the marines lost. This wasn't the sort of battle either side actually fights though. Paddy is one on one. Peak conditioning. The best genetics. Marines are humans vs everything with the best training and mental conditioning uncle Sam can provide. They fight with tools and work as a team. One on one is a last resort. One on more is by and large a death sentence in the real world. Few of us have what it takes to survive anything without training. Keep at it 💪 though. By blood sweat and tears our bodies and minds are hardened. Even when our bodies fail, our minds can remain strong.
The more I see of paddy the more I like him legend good he talks about his mental health I suffer with it a long time ago and excercise help me
Paddy you are supposed to stay on your knees. No standing up. That’s how the marines are trained in MMA
he is a freaking beast !
this is quality content
bro, its nice to see Paddy training with fit but newbies to the sport people, you can really apreciatte how he is master in transitioning  techniques.
Good times.
Love this guy!
"Im sorry Im so fat" 😂 Aww Paddy 🙌
As someone who practices MMA whats your view on japanese ju jitsu? I always see mixed reviews
Just a real genuine guy I think that’s why people can relate and love paddy! Always a winner when you’re a straight up guy with no bullshit persona.
weird how he's actually pretty fit but face is chubby af.
dude is cool af :))
5:12 Posture up, letting go of your figure 4 so they can easily slip their left shoulder out, stand up and step right into half-guard? Paddy anyone with training knows you just pull down on the head and thrust your hips for finishing leverage.. I thought i had never trained a day in my life though, Paddy?
This scouser is awesome. Future champ foreal!
Looks like the Marines need some professional fighting training 9-0 in a row, ya he's a professional but so are they.
Quality that. 👊
This should be a war crime 😅😅😅
Light heavyweight paddy is a threat😱
2 secs in n im seeing full nut grab plus a shout. pause
This video is already blowing up
Much respect paddy
WORLD CLASS! I really think that is the only way to have a bunch of Marines glad they got there ass kicked
Love Paddy
im sorry im fat!.. jajaja
“Sorry mate, Imma fat bastard” 🤣🤣
When he said he’d drop Francis on his head…he meant it meant it.
He's slowly changing
Awesome
Sorry I’m fat 😂☠️
I am a huge fan of this SOB. WATCHING you madafaka frm Kathmandu Nepal. Go Paddy go. Wooo hoooo
Love how he doesn't sugar coat anything he just says how it is and that's that.
Warrior.  💪
Paddy, love watching you fight and love the positive attitude. Keep it up brother. Don’t let all the haters body shame you. To many people just like to throw shade.
I'd fucking run if I see this dude coming at me for a takedown
I love his face always looks fat no matter if hes fit or not
Paddy is G.O.A.T.
as a ex wrestler, thats INSANE. he should be sooooo fatigued
Well. This is my first video but won't be my last. #subbed
“Sorry im so fat man”
Challenge coin and a signed ammo lid is pretty mad respect. Paddy is a legend. I’ve never seen someone more humble and cocky at the same time in my life haha
I know you’re probably sick of hearing it, but thank you so much for being a voice for mental health awareness. It’s crazy how much it helps those who deal with it to just know they’re not alone.
This gotta be the dopest video I have seen in months Bro !!! paddy this is my first video on ur Channel and lemme tell you brother you just gained yourself a die hard subscribe! Semper Fi
Patty vs Khabib would be the best sparring and friendly grappling match ever
Guaranteed before the shooting the brief was DO NOT do anything that will get you NJ'pd on camera ! We will bust you down to e1!
Good on ya lad, couldn’t have been easy rolling with those big lumps lol
That smile while saying „I’m fat fuck” hahaha
LMAO WHY DOES HE CLAP LIKE THAT 😭😭
Mcmap is a joke... I joined the Marine Corps after 911. They introduced me to this stupid fighting system. It was literally a joke... Especially whenever you have a 1st Sgt disappear for a couple months then show back up with a black belt red stripe... Or whenever a drill instructor in boot camp can jump his Marines multiple belt colors during boot camp. I knew an instructor and he said it's mainly who you know if you want to rank up. I practice martial arts and compete and jiu jitsu tournaments... I have seen many Marines come into my gym get rolled up by a white belt and they never return.
now you've got to go to the real best in the world, the SAS
Guess he took the Fauci juice to get into the US
Please do the same with The Royal Marines
Amazing guy
This is 10 marines in wrestling not 10 marines that are trying to kill you lol you should try that next
Great vid, the best part is where he thinks US marines know what a kilo is lol
Love this freeking guy, what a shite!
That happened right outside where I work
He said sorry I'm so fat lad 🤣
11/10 for this video. That was class to watch
Don’t get me wrong I like paddy and he’s incredible but let’s not forget there American marines not British😂
Just wow!
First video I've watch of him since his mental health video after the fight. Such an amazing dude!
Those triangle chokes man, all day all night damn.
This guy is so wholesome.
I see you sticking it in with the Marines them boys don’t play no games by far one of the hardest branches of our military I want to see you do the navy seal training next
have to give Paddy respect for choosing to be vulnerable in a group of warriors - keep it real Paddy
Paddy the Legend!
Patty is funny asf. lol
Love me some Paddy ... hes as real a person as they come !!! Wish you nothing but success lad
2:39 “sorry lad I’m a fat bastard” got me😂😂
He looks like young Boris Johnson
Scouse swearing... best in the world!
Paddy is the standard of what men should be. This guy is awesome.
Imagine if Paddy was in shape. Damnnnn
Quality video. Paddy showing a real humble side to him big ups lad
This guy looks like Owen Hart but acts like Matt Riddle.
Paddy “sorry I’m fat” but he’s competing in the highest level lol
The QnA bot was really good its great seeing ppl talking about mental health
YOUR A FUCKING BEAST 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Nice hope both paddy and the marines took some good lessons from this
I feel bad for Paddy as he still has trauma from his weight, he calls himself a fat bastard even after all of that weight he lost.
As an Englishman, I'm proud of Paddy. He represents us well.
Paddy the “sorry I’m fat” Baddy lol
Sorry I’m a fat bastard lol 😂 gotta love Paddy
shheeesh paddys a badass
Fuckin love paddy what a lad working out with my beloved marines 🇺🇸💪🏻
Fair play to paddy  he looked fucked lol well done ,you good mate !
Paddy the baddy Sic!
I wish I could attend this training, it's something I'd really like to do!
great video
Of course he fought POGs not grunts 😂
the way hes tapping them out out of fight season at 200 lbs is crazy they're in peak shape and you make it look easy.
Wholesome video. This was badass!!
10:48 damn Paddy missed the handshake xD
Love you paddy thank you for humans like you helping me over coming my mental health
Taps the last guy with shoulder pressure 🤣
"as you can see, pretty chubby here"
0:02
The song in the clip that people keep asking about is.... Frank Bentley - Test Me ( feat. Anthony Mareo)
9th Communication Battalion 🌈🌈🌈
Lad lad lad lad lad lad lad lad lad lad
This guy is a legend, so humble! HOOHA!
take your real self out of your chest...that's what i take from it; what i need the most. thanks paddy
Paddy would you ever roll with Jocko? I'd be curious
I love how he is just being himself 💪🏻 and as a manc I can tell he’s being real 👊🏻
That was an awesome thing for both sides to experience
True warrior and heart of a lion
3:00 "I just say I'm sorry I'm so fat lad" - PaddyTheFatty
Aside from the punching, that was pretty much identical to a high school wrestling practice.
this is so fucking gay, love it!
The fans love paddy!!!!!! He’s the fucking man !!!!!
paddy does propaganda for the evil empire
Paddy stole my pick-up line at bars!! I usually open with "sorry I'm so Fat"
as a guy who is just now starting kickboxing and MMA training while being overweight paddy is really helping me with getting in the mindset to be a fighter and is helping me find that motivation to keep on going.. he is a huge inspiration to me! keep it up paddy and keep on being the best!
have to be honest when i first seen him i didnt like him but man over the past year or so this guy has turned me watching his behind the scenes listening to him out side of the UFC and lately even in the ufc he is a real man a real guy to look up to for inspiration fair play what a guy man character an anything else xD
This dude is just effortlessly funny aff hahaha
Awesome video!
Damn Paddy is cool as hell!
I just wish I could understand what he's saying! 😂   He's gained a lot of respect by doing this with the Marines, well done Paddy!
Just take a second to realize how strong our marines are! Best military fighting force in the world!
Most of the weight paddy gains is in his face
I wish I could understand a single word he was saying. Is this really English?
10:08 Paddy vs Alistair Overeem it is then
marine are really lucky to fight against paddy
Those were marines?
"Paddy takes on diabetes"
excellent
Paddy is a freaking menace! He got f'd up during that workout and still tapped out 10 marines in 5 minutes what the hell 😂
He might have a very light accent
Love that Paddy seems to not know how to crawl properly.
this madlad just tapped out 10 marines in a row
If you're reading this and you serve or have served for your country, no matter where you're from and what country you have served for... thank you for your service.
Ye Paddy we need subtitles.
You're the man Paddy
Love to see the actual full footage of each roll Paddy had with the marines
Awesome video. Thanks.
I fucking hate ground fighting
Marines thought they were the business until they got into grappling wi the baddy..
Boris johnson still kicks asses
nice von flue choke
Seen so many fractured tibias form jiu jitsu, seeing a straining choke always has me on edge
Get on the Paddy hype train! . This guy is the real deal! Oh and what a nice gift the marines gave you. You amazing Paddy huge fan! Let's go champ!
What a top lad
it's like the video "a scouser in Vegas"
King!
It is such an upfront guy.  How can you not respect and cheer for Paddy.  His honesty is what sets him above.  Doesn't back down and to talk about mental health is amazing.  Us as men have that macho persona and never want to admit when something is wrong until it is too late.  Respect to you sir.  Wish you the best.  And thank you for taking time to spend with our military.  I can only imagine how much they appreciate the time you spent with them and the training.
Loved how you beat them all
What's the song!!?? Can't find it anywhere. HELP!!
Gg
You will loose the next fight because you gave away your secrets
Paddy, please come in France to challenge with the RAID :)
Lmfao at 9th crime???
@0:30 paddy gets noob-locked :D
I love how Paddy is so real and makes men realize we can speak up on mental health and dont have to keep our thoughts bottled up. Plus he is exciting to watch. One of my fav fighters!
This was just a great watch!  Such a champion 🏆
"I had to say im sorry im fat man" Cracked me up LOL
The, “sorry I’m so fat lad” 😂
Makes you realise that muscle, size and fitness doesn't count for much without technique and training....and against a highly trained professional you are basically clay in their hands.
good u told tham to talk   marines are tuff man    but evry one have there breaking point some how so talk when u not oke  !
What the tittle of that music around 5:55?
Awesome guy you are Paddy. Real guy real fighter. Scary as shit
Paddy made the US Marines look like girls scouts, rag dolled them around like nothing.
Likeable young man..I guess until u have to face him in the octagon-)
Humble dude.
and people still think mark has a chance
What's the title of that bad ass music? 5:55?
Paddy your a top lad m8 !!!!
How he got 3.5M views in 3 days with 500,000 subs. Because he's everything he says he is.👊👊
Paddy says..paddy the fatty!!😜🇨🇦🍀
I usually love to call new hyped fighters hype job, but Paddy has grown on me! He is a great lad.
Great video. This sort of content will make you bigger than the sport Paddy! And, a big shout-out to your editing team aswell. It's easy to watch, not too long. funny and informative.

Paddy the Army
Hope the marines understood at least 20% of what you said 😅.Great video and humble as always,good man!
Man i love his scouser language. Sounds amazing
23 fucking times I heard the word lad
Fuck, I didn't know Paddy was suffering too, the more I know about him than more respect I have for him.
I don't think this guys that great... He's just not been vs great fighters imo.
Still waiting for Paddy to be cast in a Guy Ritchie film... what is the delay?...
what song is playing when he is fighting the marines? its so good and i cant find it :)
Paddy da baddy lad
They should have show you some marine stuff since you showed them some Jiu Jitsu, with like drills in their armors and how to use guns and training combat!
Great fighter and an even better human being. You just got a new fan and subscriber! The Marines looked like they were loving it lad!
I'm about to watch this and I'm gonna count how many times the word lad is used.
What a great down to earth guy.
Paddy kinda reminds me of conner before he became a c*nt
Baddy
Please don't learn how to shoot, or run a clear, or they will kill you.
Sick
People need to stop overglorifying marines. Don't get me wrong they some bad mofos but it's not the same when they come to the fighting world.
Got a lot of respect for the baddy, seems like a super solid dude
Paddy man. I was already a huge fan. But this drives it deeper than being just a huge fan. To train, teach, and hopefully help these Marines bring a different level of respect to the table. What a great dude with a great sense of humor, personality, and grit.
I’ve never watched any of his videos before and I’d say this was a great video to start off with to say the least, was an amazing video with a lot of great lessons to learn from throughout and shows a lot about his character and those who are in the marine corps as well, much respect all the way around without a doubt
Paddy does it different 👌🏻
Beautiful.
hope you got the time to teach us some basics Paddy the Baddy!
Marines are truly a blessing
MSOC?
I just have to say sorry I'm so fat lad *as he's carried by the shoulders of another dude*
Paddy your truly an amazing person, an it has nothing to do w ufc or fists.  God bless you brother, god bless you reading thing, I truly say prayers for you an all our families! God bless us all
This dude might be getting to famous for UFC already. Live a great life Paddy
He Looks like a Younger Version of Owen Hart A Wrestler Who dies in 1999
Paddy so glad to see you with some Marines! MCMAP is very basic, but you see the fighting spirit we have! Glad you had some fun!
Paddy you're the best!
Thank you for speaking about men's mental health!
every lift...  aza say.. sorry im so fat, lad.. lmao 😂😂 paddys one of the boys. Hope he knows he'll never find himself without.   Always welly round my gaff for a cuppa tea n some scran   nice one paddy lad  👏🤝
I like paddy but his facial expressions are like bread
Hey everyone, I am Ukrainian. We have a lot of ex US soldiers right with us , who allso was trained this way for some reason.)))Please anyone tell this guys this shit is not working on real wars. )
Brilliant <3
It is hilarious how he keeps saying I’m sorry I’m such a fat bastard😂😭
Sick
Sick
What?)))
I like this guy more and more and not just for his skill, stand up dude.
Lovely guy Paddy is! Nice video keep the good vibe up!
Suck it up Paddy. Uuurrruuhhh!
Crazy to think he can do that to anybody and not stop when they tap and that's it lol
Wow, I love the real paddy! All heart and support polite.
Good vid!
Paddy the whole time, “I’m so fat man”😂
Paddy, you're an inspiration to many blokes. Stop putting yourself down. You're like a racing snake compared to most lads.
We love paddy!
thurein tun?
Paddy you should get ahold of Don Shipley and try to tour a BUDs class in Coronado, want a workout? that's the best there is.
Dude is just a star
marines are weak 😂 try doing this with navy seal or army ranger
my old place of employment, this is so wild to see!
In war the US soldiers are the weakest and most coward soldiers in the world. They only act tough from far away or from their planes.
Man is an inspiration , keep pushing forward paddy .
Paddy's a good lad.
Really impressive. Some of the boys I used to roll with in the army are savages. I'm sure marines are no different and paddy makes quick work of em.
5:11 amazing tip for us jui jitsu beginners 🤌🏽🤌🏽💯🙏🏽
Oohraah!!!   o7
Great vid lad proper nice, I’m right chuffed with that
Jiu-jitsu wins ...
Only UFC guy I like.
Old Son Paddy Boy is a fockin beast bro 🤌 hardest working man I swear
Loved that Bret Hart reference "the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be"
Wasn't that big of a fan of Paddy's but after watching his post fight  speech about losing his friend to mental health and seeing this side of him with these guys has made me a fan. I'm rooting for ya buddy in everything you do!🤙🏽
The absolute best and worst feeling ever 3:50 anyone whose done this type of work out or just wanted a challenge themselves for health and body reward knows this feeling.
Really enjoyed the video Paddy!💪💪👊👊👍👍
Sorry for being fat  Lmfao
Damn bro.. just gained more respect from me ♥️💪😎
This is honestly, the best most motivating video i have seen for the past 10 years, YOU ARE THE BAD MAN PADDY!!! I just subscribed cannot believe i had no idea you were pushing out youtube videos another happy subsciber here!!
Love this guy his amazing
Gotta love paddy
Poor guy coined him and Paddy didn't take the handshake 😢
so The Marines are only good for carrying bodies and jumping around haha combat is 0 :D
"The balance of a ballerina, but I weigh like a Sumo wreslter" lmao
My favorite Irish lad.
Beautifle😀
cant wait for me to head off to basic in may🫶🏼
Marine: “stalemate? Reset?” Paddy: “I’m just resting while I sit on your head lad”
This is so good.  Paddy is the man!!
Bro this
mad respect to paddy for talking about his struggles with depression. you have a new fan!
I have to say... was a not a fan, after a few videos... I'm hooked! Your better than any streaming service!!! Big fan!!! NOW!!!!
Respect Paddy
Fucking love the content bro I'm a big fan  can't wait to see your next fight and to all my brothers watching this Semper Fi
Err
Such a good dude!
Repair smith
Paddy saying “I’m sorry I’m so fat” is the funniest thing this video haha
Today i learned Paddy the Baddy has a YouTube channel . What’s up ya wanker ? Hello from Philadelphia 👋🏻 Paddy calling himself fat the whole time, should change his name to Paddy the Fatty 🤣 don’t beat me up please
Patty a real one talking about mental health
Squat deeper
Brooo u guys who don't understand look at this dudes mass !!! He is a big strong rounded fighter he looks good with weight also
COOL VIDEO 👍🏻
Man thia dude has a relatable personality. Both real down to earth and absolutely deadly.  Paddy your a legend in your own time!
Well when paddy said he was gonna eat, he wasn't joking 😂
Why have I been seeing this everywhere😂😂
I love everything about this KID.
i was already on the Paddy train, but man what a good dude. I want to see him take over the UFC!
I don’t even care about sports yet this showed up on my feed….. Let me enjoy my terminal leave in peace and away from this organization smh
Eddie Hall versus Patty 😂🤣
Paddy a beast
God this was fantastic to watch. Marines and Paddy and a good positive message. Had me shed a tear tbh
Why would Marines give a shit about MMA?  They are trying to kill people.  Not win a MMA fight.  This is dumb.
“sorry im so fat lad”😂😂
Good times
Most Marines aren't even in a combat MOS. Gotta pick an elite unit, not just a uniform :p Try some greenie beanies or Rangers or even Combat Controllers next time!
Mad skillz🤘😎🤘
That was awesome!!!! What a great guy!
PADDY THE BADDY FTW!!!
Paddy is the best man
He reminds me of Philza
I guess the women don't have to do shit in the Marines Corp. They even get carried around.
SERIOUSLY PENDLETON! Damn wish you’d come down to Miramar!
Proof they don't make Marines like they used to. From the mid 70s back in time, Marines were true blood and guts. Today they are like pampered ladies.
Here endth the lesson  Champ and the Legends....good go! 🇺🇲💪🇬🇧
1 thing marines and most fighters have that no floor wrestler can beat are limbs that will attack before they get put on the floor into a submission. Nothing wrong with submission wrestling skills but you end a real fight before it gets near that point.
Have a lot of respect for him doing this.
Dang Patty sure has gained weight kast I saw em good on him!
man took out 10 marines
maybe we should be teaching marines a little bjj....
Lol. He was supposed to shake his hand and take the medal at the same time not just pick it off his hand 🤦‍♂️ hehe it’s cool. Most people would’ve done the same.
These soldiers were built to last, while paddy was built to fight.
everything here was amazing
I'm so excited to see some real guy on guy action, the armed services aspect only makes the dream that much more dominant. Well done Paddy, WHO RAW!?!?!?!
Still a fawkin animal no matter what
I don't see much gender equality in that room
They put him in 9th Crime 😂😂😂🤘🏼🇺🇸
How can you not like this dude!
7:19 where his right hand going
I knew Paddy was a badass, but I gotta tell ya, when you show respect for our fighting force, you earn respect from me.
Are these normal marines or are they Marsoc?
Wicked content!!
Love this guy. ❤️Nohomo
Hope for you that you don't wear masks and get vaccines. It would be ironic to be win against 10 marines but you would be so weak against a crappy virus.
is you camera, your camera operator or your editor a complete failure at its job? unwatchable...
Dude I can’t understand a word you are saying
"sorry lad Im a fat bastard" got me😂
I come from a fighting family. My middle brother got carpet burns on his nose after coming home from bootcamp. I was 15 but was 6'2" 20lbs and he punched my in my junk as soon as I let him up. We never tested each other again.
Paddy being confused about working out in cadence made me laugh
You’re only making my Marine Corps stronger. Thank you. Semper Fidelis.
Love seeing more of you Paddy thank you for your post fight words too, Nick from Tempe Arizona 🤙
This shows the difference in high level to top top level they’re marines who’s job is to train fight and even kill and he beats all 10 in a row and there all fit strong lads
Crazy
I have nothing with UFC tbh, but i love this guy and admire him
The devil dogs would have done much better against the Baddy if they spent  more time training and less time in their gender inclusivity classes lol.
Paddy "sorry I'm so fat lad."
When it comes to Jiu Jistu, doesn't matter how big you are, if the smaller person has better ground control they will will 100% of the time.
Paddy and Beast are my favorite fighters of all time
Yo
Used to watch MMA like a religion and fell off. Had no clue who Paddy was, but what a great personality and an impressive start in the UFC!
Man I’ve become such a quick fan of this kid. Not only a bad ass but amazing personality. Was really impressed with him showing some vulnerability.
“Sorry lad, I’m a fat basterd”😭😭😭
Paddy is pure comedy!
Why do you have to be so disrespectful with the fingers most of the guys there are doing it for a Dodge Charger and crayons
Khamzat 20 in 10 mins easy.
From an Army SFC, this video gets a LIKE cause not many would take on our Marines in a workout then a roll session. Well done Paddy Well done
Love paddy in numerous ways. With endurance the marines kicked ass. But with ju jitsu paddy kilt them
I served 12 years in the U.S. MARINES.. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE VIDEO AND EXPERIENCE FOR THESE MARINES. PADDY IS SIMPLY AN AMAZING INDIVIDUAL...
Wow paddy lad 10/0 fucking hell lad wow
Jesus H Christmas…. This baby cheeked bastard tapped out 10 marines in a row after a full morning of workouts? Paddy is a Baddy.
How can you not love Paddy The Baddy, the lad is awesome!
Paddy is the best thing ever.
Sorry I’m so fat lad lol 😂
The Marines might be crazy crayon eating psychos. But they're OUR crazy crayon eating psychos. Glad Paddy was able to train and soeak with them
This video suuuuuuuuuucks.  There’s too much fluff and not enough ACTION.
Booyah!
Subscribed
It’s killing him cause he got the Patty on his belly. Get it P looking forward to see you fight and eat pizza again
WOW 🤩
They could have taught him how to accept the coin instead of just letting him grab it at least 😂 great video tho
I fux with paddy
Loved this video, could resonate with many things Paddy said. Legend 🙏🏾
4:49, best part of all the video🤣
alternate title: Paddy Takes 10 men in 1 go!!!!!
ARMY would of choked paddy out.
Cant understand half of the shit he says .but he is a dope dude
Man paddy is just an overall great dude to be around genuinely just likeable
That was cool af. Slightly disappointed w/ the fact that, out of 10 marines, not one got a sub or a draw.    Back to hell week gentleman. Tighten up.
4th did alright
paddys ground work is immaculate
These men aren't trained well enough
Drago Malfoy has changed ! :o
I want to be fat like Paddy
Getting me inspired thanks
the thing is paddy wants to be fat until his next fight
sorry lad, im a fat bastard
Maximum respect to you, Paddy.  The toughest people are not the ones who never get knocked down, but the ones who keep getting up again!  Physically. Mentally.  Spiritually.  Everyone know that a barking dog is scared to death.  Same with trash talk.  The most powerful force that exists who has been given all authority in Heaven and Earth after going to the cross to redeem us told us to not only love our Creator and our brothers, but even to love our enemies.  How else will they stop being your enemy?  You show your total superiority to an enemy when you genuinely care about them…and it will disarm a trash talker on multiple levels.     My fiancé works in the Whole Health System of Care at the Veteran’s Administration, helping vets overcome PTSD and related challenges.  She was a Division-1 All-American running the Mike in 4:37 at Kansas State back in the day.  It is 10-times easier to prevent PTSD and other mental health challenges that recover from it.  Amen?  She had PTSD herself and is working on a program that could be implemented in every branch of the military and law enforcement to build up a strong preventative of PTSD on the front end of their Service...starting in Boot Camp.  She is going to devour everything you said here, brother—you sound like her!  Would you like to contribute any input?   I have a good feeling about putting you two together to synergize.  I can see it blowing up and being bigger than all of us.  The need for this is unlimited.
You should have came up to Stockton to the Diaz Academy, they are the nicest dudes ever and would have enjoyed you coming up and hitting a session with them also!!
What a baddy lad.
:02 I would tap out also and never wrestle again!
Always thought you were a solid dude, but after watching this and my hometown boy retiring (Nate Diaz) im going to have to start following you a bit more. Mad respect for coming over to the West Coast and showing the boys some proper techniques.... And mad respect for always bringing the MH support to the forefront my friend! PEACE!!
Fav fighter on the block right here
Paddy your the fucking man. Welcome to The U of A!
"I have to say, sorry I'm so fat lad." lmao
Sorry im so fat man! 🤣 your not fat Paddy. Just little over your weight class... nothing a few weeks hard training won't take care of.
He gained weight again ?
Wish paddy would launch a healthy keto snack.
he's maybe the most relatable superstar I've ever seen lmao "sorry lad I'm a fat bastard" had me rolling
Amazing
Paddy needs to move up to heavyweight!
That was representing talking 10 marines. Back to back.
Paddy,  As a long time fan of the sport, veteran, and suicide attempt survivor, thank you for taking the time out of your day to speak to these marines. You don’t understand how much that probably meant to them. You’re such a class act brother, quickly becoming my favorite fighter.
Fucking love it  Do well at Millwall
just wanted to say u look like boris johnson
He’d have a lot harder time with lejeune marines lmao
Lol, love how he's so considerate about being "fat"; I would just see that as "more" training.
Paddy is taking the nation by storm
Wow takin on 10 marines in a row
"Sick" that's all I wanna hear sometimes from him is sick 🤣🤣
Great video.... YNWA!   Challenge coin and a hand made plaque ... NICE
7:32 can someone tell what that is he has him in?
I’m sorry I’m so fat lol
Paddy is the man the ultimate mr UK....... Loves ya lad!
Paddy has to be one of the classest acts in the sporting world.
Paddys the man no doubt
Bro just showed them what the next level of Brazilian Jiu Jistu / Grappling is. What an honor to be schooled by such a skilled dude on the mat. I'd be a sponge and listen to everything he says fellas
“Sorry I’m so fat lad”
That was impressive tapping 10 dudes after that workout but …. And a big BUT they weren’t infantry and all I’m saying not that the military gets the best Ground fighting techniques but the infantry has a more physical nature and them BOYZ THICKK   but big props not only to the service members but to paddy as well  that would have smoked my bag and I would’ve ended up in a triangle just as quick
i would definitely also be apologizing because of the weight i'm a fatarse and i can't imagine someone having to carry me you know what i mean?
Oh my god he took them all, wtf I teared up a little with the gifts at the end
Should enlist, Paddy....it's your element.
Fucking love watching Paddy. Great attitude, entertaining, skillful…man’s got the entire package.
PADDY HAS A YOUTUBE AHHH
I died when he said "I don't care if you have 7 arms  I'm gonna beat you"
Now do it with seals and delta 😂
Paddy going with this stupid fatty meme is the best part of my year he's a good guy at heart and fights like a menace
Wonder how many of those marines are gonna train Jiu Jitsu when they get out.
“I’m sorry I’m so fat”
paddy is sincerely a good person. Very hearty to watch truly an entertainer through and through
5:50  8:11
As a Marine, I became I massive Paddy Fan. Wow! I watched his fights but didn’t really care but after this video. Mad respect for paddy.
Much respect my guy!!!
Hope he's not bragging on taking on a bunch of communications marines.. lol
Thank you Paddy, as a retired MARSOC Marine I know how much these Marines appreciate you  taking time out of your busy schedule,   These guys are reviewing every second of this clip, and applying what they learned to their arsenal.. 1st recon BAT ooh rah...
BADDYYYYYY
Imagine being stuck in a fist fight with these Paddy marines..
A marine is not going to win a fist fight against a professional UFC fighter. UFC fighters are the best in the world. A modern marvel of what it means to be a fighter. Equip a squad of marines with all their gear and a squad of ufc fighters would be another story.
The camerawork and editing style almost made me throw up , literally. Other than that,  great video.
This was dope but why didn’t he roll with any of the brown and black belts? He’d probably still win but it looks like it was only tan and gray belts
I never thought I'd say it but this lad is really growing on me.
Britains own ., the P Baddy!
That was awesome.
Jedi Level.
That was Great 👍🏼
PADDY THE DADDY
Let's see him do that with the Royal Marines, different kettle of fish to the USMC ffs
What awesome training center hats off to all participants great way to stay in shape.
Inspiring!
For him to go 10 and 0 is very impressive especially being tired and sore as well...
A very genuine young man. I hope he stays that way and doesn’t turn into a scumbag example like McGregor did.
Down to earth genuine lad inspiring to the kids of today
Thank you Paddy. Would love to see the corp pay him back by not kicking his ass and taking him to the range to shoot all the toys or, put him in the back seat of an F-18 so he can have some fun.
awesome fucking video
Have these Marines had "the jab"? Better not push it too hard. Myocarditis seems to be contagious these days 😂
Im sorry but the marines are taking ut easy. He has long hair, in man to man combat in life or death we aremt looking for a tap. We are looking to kill. They took it easy on him
I've never loved the ufc enough to have a favourite fighter but I sure do now. Not only my favourite fighter but an absolute golden human. There's dudes and then there's Paddy. Respect.
Paddy, as a military veteran I’d like to thank you for advocating Mental Health and your willingness to use your platform to help others out of dark places!!!! A True Champ and an amazing human!!!!!
Paddy at 9th Crime? UFC should have taken him to the Dungeon at SOI.
Yeah they always working out in the Marines Semper Fi
NON-SCIENCE FICTION
This was highly enjoyable to watch
Paddy is the fuckin man! 🔥
Wholesome
This guy should fight RuPaul..... I mean Jake Paul
The Best there is, the best there was, The Best There Ever Will Be! =Brett The Hitman Hart... love u brothers.
Document all injuries you get in the Marines or you’ll have to fight the VA for years like me.
Whatever the UFC is paying you, it is not enough
Yo patty is a pretty good teacher
O good practice
I’m sorry I’m so fat man 😂😂 paddy 200lbs isn’t fat I’m America you’re good
PADDY VS CHIMAEV NOOOOOOOWWW
i didn’t know paddy had a youtube channel until he posted this on his instagram story
Respect
I'd be out of breath by round 3, IDK how he went 10 rounds. what a beast this Paddy is
Army: ahhh combatives, too risky might hurt some soldiers. Marines: Semper Fi, Rah, bring in a UFC pro champ and have him beat the shit out of our Marines. It'll make'em stronger, meaner, and more deadly.  * Marine related grunting and killing noises.*
paddy on top of you, he leans in and whispers into your ear " sorry I'm so big" as he realizes how tight you really are
Stop the genocide in Yemen.
Thank you for this, it made me happy to see real people still exist.
That was awesome good job baddy!!
Nice gifts from the USMC , it’s going to be like a relik
Only just found your channel. No idea who you are... (i do now), just binge watched 5 eps, instant sub. What a top lad and such a brilliant partner in Molly. Looking forward to the ride....
Amazing lad Paddy is
paddy is a badass. his next walkout, he should have all those marines walk with him. would be proper!!
not 1 of those marines took the choke, i would have though at least one of those warriors wouldnt tap
Aint no way he actually thinks he would even last 20 seconds in the ring with ngannou 💀
most people would pass out, or puke, after 4 or 5 straight grapples.  but 10 in a row????  That's crazy, especially against Marines trained in hand-to-hand combat.
I'm motivated as fuck watching this! Saving this greatness!
The workout was brutal. Paddy just tapped 10 studs. What a great opportunity for both.  Funny man.
God bless you brother and the fact that you took your time out to train with United States Marines. That alone says more about you than anything and I will always pledge my love and respect to you. Thank you for your attention and calling upon my brothers. I love you mano
These guys aren’t just Marines, they are Marine Raiders. This is impressive!
Paddy has the BEST rubber guard I have ever seen
I love paddy but please don’t call out Francis lol
Mad Lad
Good lad
Gunnys be slaying
Okay this was wholesome
paddy the machine
he made it look easy hahahaaha
“HOORAH” “what they said😃”😂😂
Ooooooo paddy the baaaddyyyyy oooooooo paddyy the badddyyyy. Let’s go lad
on my wife’s account trying to get the algorithm to make her more like a marine
Paddy is an amazing champion he has fought without hurting physically  ten US marines which show how efficient he is. He is a great figher 👏👏👏
I love this man the best inspiration and role model I've seen come out of the MMA community. Thanks for showing us that real men struggle and it's ok for us to ask for help. A living legend.
Paddy constantly apologizing for being fat is my spirit animal.
lol they are in socks! you need floor grip if you wanna win
A very close friend of mine committed suicide almost 3 years ago. Even though it’s been a while since it happened, I still miss having the ability to speak to him. I still think about him almost everyday. He was a guy who thought men don’t cry, and that he could suck it up. That worked for a long time, but eventually he couldn’t bear the pain anymore. Thank you for being a voice! Men need to know that it’s okay to talk about our problems! If something is really tearing you up inside, call someone! My door was always open to him, he just made a choice not to use it. So, if you’re in a bad space mentally, don’t be afraid to go and tell someone! Suicide effects so many more then the person who commits to it. I wish nothing but the best for everyone who reads this!
Damn… I needed to hear that Paddy.. good on you brother
what a good guy down to earth and real
There was a dude in there that used to be a drill instructor in the company I was in and when people were body sparring and they kept on hitting eachother in the face the way he’d come in and rip the headgear off them and yell at them in this MR. T like manner was absolutely priceless lmao , I accidentally knocked a kid out and best believe he flamed my ass for it 🤣😭
Mint
Paddy is a bad mofo lol
Paddy The Badass. Great dude. True warrior.
Bruh I need subtitles
paddy's a beast. I would be scorched after 2 on the mat, Goat.
mounted traingle and buddy is like "reset??" hahaha
Patty the beast!! Love how you talk about mental health  and break down the stereotypes! Keep doing what you're doing.  You are transcending past MMA !
Now do it with British marines that would be a good vid
Bruh boutta make more on YouTube than ufc lol
Good hearted Paddy
“ saRRRRI im a fat baSstaRRd”
EL TAPO
Paddy is the epitome of being a roll model to not just young men and woman but to everyone suffering in silent with mental health . Speaking his truth will help many speak theirs an open up more about mental health .. well done lad
Owen hart
Not gonna lie. This...this made me cry. I used to wrestle in high school, me and a guy I consider my brother, he left the sport after his grandfather passed, and I stopped because I lost my love for just pure wrestling. I had been in karate, my father taught me boxing, I'd wanted to wrestle since I was like 7. But once I got there I loved it, till I didn't. Listening to him speak, and say the same things that a lot of people I looked up to would say...i need to get back man🥲. I'm just rambling, blessings and love to all.
Best fucking video of the year! Appreciate everyone who is currently serving or has served. God bless yall. PADDYS a legend for this!
Doin liverpool proud m8 well done
Why they don't apply this to the police force astounds me
Patty- "I'm so sorry I'm so fat man" 🤣 I love this dude!
Great to see.
Lol that guy saying stalemate as if Paddy couldn't elbow his face in from that position 😅 Either way props are due, I'd be very happy with myself regardless.
you really understood that sound he was making?
Ireland got some true blood
Go to a infantry battalion where real marines are.
Great video, nice one paddy 👍
When U gon fight Khamzat Paddy?
You are very very cool and Real man...the future is yours bro
I like seeing a fighter that can pull views on you YouTube so they can make some real money
Scousers don’t get tapped out 😂
I bet the seniors were not at all pleased with receiving the middle finger...imagine if a normal marine tried that shit on the seniors haha :D
If most of the marines didn’t have socks on it might’ve been a more even matchup
Tough as old boots as my dear old Grandad would say.
That was awesome.
I just wanted to say sorry I'm so fat xD xD
Paddy is a goon man how can u not like the baddy the real scourser
I never knew how mentally ill white men are until people started being more accepting about mental health.  It makes a lot of sense. The violence, shootings, drugs, etc  I hope y’all get better white folks ♥️
"Sorry lad I'm a fat bastard at the minute" 😂😂 fucking quality mate
If you put closed captions on it auto generates text for the Marines but once Paddy speaks it doesn't even try as if his voice were music or background noise, and personally I find that absolutely hilarious.
paddy is the f"ckn baddy
So my only thing with this is you may be able to beat them in a combat with rules but if they were able to fight you like a real enemy with your life on the line non of what you do would matter after they stuck that kbar in you
Awesome
10-0 Paddy against the MARINES .......... 😳👊.  RESPECT.  Them boys ain't pussies.
0:02 what the f*ck is that guys hand doing there
Paddy is such a nice man he keeps saying sorry he is so fat lol.
That is not marines from the movies .So lame .NAVI this, NAVI that .What a joke!
Ngl, I've never really cared for Paddy. He's always kinda annoyed me, seemed to try too hard to be relevant. However this video definitely makes me rethink my approach. Seems like a down to earth dude. He's got a new fan.
What a fucking savage. Tapping marines like they are little girls. Effortless. And after a workout. Truly a baddy
Sick vid
that kayak though, worse than Afghani doing jumping jacks.
coolest lad.
I think Paddy is a fucking legend 😂
“Sorry lad, I’m a fat bastard” 💀💀
Awesome
Nice bunch of lads
cool
Great video paddy, great title, great thumbnail, great haircut
all the winners feast after a war stop apologizing
I expect all the senior lances to start using these moves on boots😂
7:20 😂😂😂😂
its not about power, its about have the right tricks ;)
Paddy sounds like one of those ancient trainers that traveled and taught philosophy.
He kept apologizing about his weight , I felt lowkey kind of bad lol don’t have to feel bad my boy
Love this video.  Paddy is the man!
Good dude. Light hearted and that’s how you have to carry yourself. You don’t like me? Than fuck off.
i think paddy the baddy needs to try out a flame broiled double whopper with cheese from burger king
He grappled with a bunch of people with zero experience
Wonder how many of them undrestand him
The first time I saw you fight...you instantly became my favorite fighter.  You're fighting from a place of love and humbleness.  Thank you for taking the time to see what our "Devil Dogs" do day in and day out.  Much Love and respect 🙏 ❤️ 🙌
That was only one of his hardest workouts....THAT WEEK!!! man trains like that or harder everyday yall!!! If it was me I'd be like that's one of my hardest workouts EVER this man said that week! 🤯 it's probably a Tuesday too 😉
Not to shit on Paddy but I didn't see him grapple any red tabs. If you know you know.
Watch out brother, don’t get raped. Our military has a huge issue with men and women being sexually abused and then murdered when they try to speak out about it.
I didn’t know about this guy when he first showed up but I like him he’s laughs hahahah he’s a big boy hah
What was he talking about? :D
Good shit Paddy!!
Respect earned there lad, 10-0👊
This was lit
He’s such a lazy fighter. He needs to stay ripped year round like Yoel.
Paddy is great, but half those marines can't understand a word you're sayin' lad.
Who knew that lewis capaldi could grapple🤷
more content like this please
Si a ufc fighter fought non fighters and won?! You don’t say!
I really wish they  would do training in school for every kid and it was something they HAD to do. Kids today lack so much discipline and it’s sad.
I lost it when that one Marine started carrying Paddy and he goes “sorry I’m so fat” 😂
I will never miss a UFC card with Paddy on it.  How can you not be a fan!
Id be pist low key working my butt of for years then you walk in and just drop me and my home team 😂💀💀💀
Pogs don't count
They didn’t understand a word
Bro change the thumbnail
Just curious why is paddy putting on weight?
all right lad
Came here to apologize for not being subbed already smh
What did he say??
Paddy , love you Lad 🔥
Would be unfortunate to have to line up against paddy in a brawl
great motivation beating them the way he did. give these guys an idea of how good one CAN be if they really work at it
He's a bonified badass for real!  007
This video was sih
"I have to say, sorry I'm so fat, lad" 2:58 This dude is hilarious
no crayons were consumed in this video.. i m disappointed
Miami girl princess
I need the auto subtitles! Love that dialect acctually
So sick on so many levels
I have no training in either fields. But i know i can tap paddy out.
I am exactly the same mentality as you I don't do MMA but I am black belt in Sambo for 20 years now I will fucking crunch anybody in the world, I have no fear even if if I  have to die.
was he scared to take on the commandos?
This is great content for so many reasons
Paddy the daddy!
Love seeing Paddy getting down and putting that work in with them -- and of course I got nothing but love for them Devil Dogs too!!!
*DRINKING GAME* Take a shot everytime Paddy shoots the bird... YOU'LL BE PROPER PISSED, LAD!!
He's turning into Paddy the Fatty 😜
Brilliant
This was fucking mint!!!!!!!!
fair fight it would  be, if marines could take their  socks  off
As I say, sorry I'm fat lad
Paddy made our marines look like children. Jesusss
You just can’t hate this guy, fun to watch him fight and hilarious watching him on podcasts. Then seeing him here with our marines and his mentality just leaves you wanting to see what he’s gonna do next!
sorry im so fat lad....lol
"stalemate" hhahahah
Just subbed Paddy so give us a ❤️x
*2:50* When she asks if we can get out of here
Man this was awesome.
Respect given, respect earned. Powerful Paddy the Baddy.
It’s 3:50 in the morning and I’m still laughing at this love his energy
Too bad americans cant retain anything in their brains to remember what you teach
Paddy is a great all around person! Shows respect .
I love paddy man thats is
Absolutely brilliant paddy taking over the world gave me goosebumps watching that when you took questions of them 👌👏👏
I love this! I have a new found respect for Paddy! You don't see to many UFC guys using their skills and emotional pride to make other's lives better!
Very cool.  Well done, Paddy, and God bless the Marine Corp.
He’s great!
These marines just learned how to fuck up a haji jiujitsu style
Him and Meatball are the new UFC main ppl. Take over LFC and EfC!
Paddy the sweetheart “sorry I’m so fat mate”
Stalemate? Must have been a joke or he didn't understand the position he was in. Paddy was just tired and taking a break.
Pretty badass that he got to hang w my beloved Corps and gave them one hell of a lesson.  Semper Fi
I can speak for myself and a few other Marines when I say depression and mental health issues can really affect your life and everyone around you in a bad way. I'm sure some of those guys really benefited from Paddy's visit and his words whether he knows it or not. Respect 🙏
hmm very nice
Paddy vs Khamzat
good to see paddy at anfield last night
Well this one went viral.
That 50+ lb swing for a fight is brutal and I’m guessing not good. .
These Marines are cool! And Paddy is always amazing all we know.
Wow Paddy the Baddy was just up the road?! I knew I heard bombs going off the other night, just didn't know it was Paddy! Why is this dude so likable?! Oh and as always respect to our Marines and everyone at camp Pendleton!
Now do navy seals rangers recon or force
I would like to see the grappling in full lenght
Have him fight some red tabs lmao
tha fk is a "paddy the baddy" anyway ?
That’s just belta, fair play lads 💪
much love paddy! from 🇺🇸
Nobody is gonna talking about how many marines he made tap out 😳 patty is an amazing fighter / person in general
W
Paddy apologising for being a fat bastard made me smile each time
I like the part where Paddy finds out that MCMAP is at least 50% hazing through physical training.
Hahah paddy wasnt ready to hold pads for the first guy😂
1:20  THIS IS WHY I LOVE YOU PADDY 😂😂😂
This is good to see we need to see more stuff like this out makes ppl feel good, this made me feel good watching paddy share a piece of his life with men that protect us and our country with there lives ❤️
What’s the song at the 6 min mark?
Hell yeah man, sounds like you had a great time. Don't know if you're familiar with David Goggins, but if not you need to be lol. See if he'll come give you the Jesse Itzler treatment, I'd love to see that.
If Paddy stays on a nice win streak, he'll be the new super star in the sport. Mark me words laghd.
Please make less cuts it sucks
Sign him up and send him on a one-man mission to wreck havoc in some shitty islamofascist country.
Paddy is a legend mate
The major insight here: 1. Paddy was not in full fight mode 2. Paddy was not even throwing his fists, which wuld have ended the fights faster 3. Paddy is a good guy, no doubt, and enjoys life so kudos to Pattyboy keeping it real 4. MC's gotta a lot of stamina and can go long due to high cardio, and everyone knows     if you lack high cardio, you flame out after 2-3 rounds and if 5 round fight, you're dead     Emulate Nick Diaz, as his cardio and non stop action beats many other top fighters
Now reverse the roles.  See how he does when facing the Marines in REAL war situations. Remove all rules. Survivor wins.  In the real world, the only fight that isn’t fair is the one you lose.
“I have to say sorry I’m so fat mate.” 😂
!!
Loving the banter, but honestly paddy, you need to lay off the larger and burgers..🤣.. your cardio is shocking..
Ain’t no way my drill instructor on here 😂
west coast marines get paddy meanwhile camp lejeune marines can’t have adequate living conditions in the barracks.
people in the military are clueless,you are used to make money for the bankers with wars and they use mostly whitwes in wars to kill the strongest of the whites that are left, STOP FIGHTING WARS FOR ISRAHELL!
Those marines will never for the rest of their lives have a stigma about their or others' mental health. Of course words hit but seeing it in action like that sticks. Watching you pin 10 trained marines IN A ROW after a brutal workout and then telling them you used to cry in bed for a hour every day will reshape their brains.   You saved them and their later units so much mental pain and suffering by training with them that day.   Touching thousands of lives daily Paddy!
"I have to say sorry I'm so fat" God he's so tough on him self 🤣 I love this guy
Lmoa half of the grunts looked like they needed subtitles for Paddy
Paddy the Baddy looks like if Putin and Boris Johnson had a baby😂
“I’m so sorry I’m a fat bastard.” 😂
Came here for a fight, got it. But the life lesson...Chills tears. You're a legend mate!
What song is playing at 5:50?????? Anyone???
Sorry I'm so fat lad 🤣🤣
People making fun of the Marines haven't seen paddy reassemble a rifle lol
he definitely is the biggest baddy
gotta start with them BJJ lessions already xD
Cool. Put him in a boxing ring with a B list fighter and watch him get owned.
Der Dialekt is so heavy!!
It would be great to see Paddy and Sheamus appear in a video together doing an intense training session.
how the fokh did they understand you, padde lad?
Love how he apologized for bein a fat ass 😂😂😂😭😭   They were like your good 😂💀
Paddy just done did 10 USMC Marines... IN A ROW. that is fucking insane stamina and endurance. Look at the size of him. Paddy the Baddy will batter you, Thick or Thin!
I was watching this while eating a big mac
I just fucking like you because you seem one of us
Makes such a huge impact
Hi Paddy. I’ve just subbed to your channel. I would just like to say, Thank You for inspiring this 47 year old disabled woman to keep pushing on with my hopes and dreams. I do hope you get to see my comment.
Anyone else watch the war wax add
10 marines vs Paddy, are no match
i want to see David Goggins in this
What's the soundtrack when your grapling dude?
God the mental health session at the end. Always needed
I keep loving this guy more man 😂😂😂
This is such a good video. Great idea, great vibe and great people
First round KO next fight just because of this training
Anyone know the artist playing over paddies 10v1?
Wholesome that ✨
stand up guy and one of my current fav fighters!! absolute legend and class act! lol loving the whole time ya getting carried "sorry im so fat lad" ahahahahaaha
Porn Hub title "A baddy taps 10 soaking wet marines"
Minor detail but I think it’s funny how he just grabs the challenge coin and the marine sits there for like a second trying to figure out what to do with his life 😂
Action starts at 5:51.
When a Marine gives you a gift, it's no small token. What he got is truly an honor.
Class 👌👌
Great stuff paddy Lad
Ma man trying to give u a handshake with the coin, paddy just left him in the vacuum and snatched the coin 😂
Ugh some of those Marines punches 🤦🏻‍♂️  Don’t gotta b a boxer to b a marine. I get it. But geeze
Yes
Now try a live fire exercise
Love what you're doing Paddy!
Such a beast for doing this. Big fan of Paddy after seeing this.
Amazing vid. Anyone know the song playing while sparring?
Yeah Paddy's BJJ is good
He is absolutely adorable!
Paddy's got to be the nicest and most honest badass out there.  He'll knock you the F out and have you laughing on the way down lol. Top Boy!
For those who want to know what is the song at 5:50 : https://youtu.be/nU8t3L0vFJ0
Paddy the baaaddy. Good on ya mate you almost had me tearing up that whole video. Nice to see a regular guy being a regular guy even when your not just a regular guy. Much love Paddy
natural comedian paddy lad  marines: HUUUWAH!!!! Paddy: what they said 🤣🤣
Wouuuuu Paddy is so Strong  ; )
Not into MMA, but I came across this video and watched it and I really enjoyed both the content and the charisma and attitude. Two thumbs up.
So dope!!
Next time drop the com guys and go w the grunts.
Cool
Real recognize real
We all understand progressively why paddy is a star ! He is very humble and human being ! In paris he Said the truth about what he feel and thats authentik and the problem Of mental sadness etc etc he is Just for real a great fighter, man, human !
Paddy that was fuken awesome man
Our country is doomed
He’s the real deal and he’s a fighter who’s great for the sport and the fans go patty go
People really underestimate the level of skill, pro-athletes are at. All the keyboard warriors out there, (to be clear; I am NOT saying these Marines are in that group) imagine yourself being one of these ten men. Would you have done any better? And this was just a work out. Imagine if he really got angry and wanted to hurt you......bad! This young man is a Beast!
Yo, paddy is puttin work. Semper fi
Paddy is a wrestle savage want To see him against the best
Money can't buy that
Lucky out marines are given guns cause Paddy just running through everyone
i need a paddy shirt sayin * Sorry im so fat right now*
6:18 Paddy submits jon jones
Yo Paddy rolling with 10 marines after a grueling workout is legit. Respect to this man.
Paddy's jiu fatso jitsu is so cool to watch.
Did you watch the game yesterday?
Paddy is a bloody legend
Paddy gained weight😁,chubby and cute.
Hold up, parted haircuts are in regs now😭
Respect. Gods work 🙏
I was born on camp Pendleton
MASCHINE gegen Marines 🥵
Big fan! Keep it up!
Paddy vs Oil democracy
I'm so sorry I'm so fat . Paddy on fight day gaining back 34  pounds  🤫 His opponent 🧐🥺😱🙃
This video popped up on my feed and WoW bro, you're fuckin amazing. Love the accent and you are the definition of "dont judge a book by its cover" You got a new Sub!
Woman shouldn't be allowed to join unless they do the same workout as the man
WHAT AN HONOR PADDY IS MY HERO MAN
@7:09 the dude suggested a stalemate even though he had no kind of leverage or hold on paddy haha. Good on him and his confidence
Paddy joined the Marines and became a Raider in record time. Within the year, all terrorism was wiped from the planet.
sad i been doing what paddy said the last 10 years i dont know if any thing can save me there is no one to talk to literally any more...i was ban from the place to get help for idk why any more the M.D DID IT SO ITS SUPPOSED TO BE A YEAR HE WONT LET ME COME BACK HE IS ADDICTED TO BOY SO I THINK ME KNOWING IT MAKES HIM NERVOUS THEY KNOW BUT HE KNOWS I KNOW ALOT ..IM TAKING THEM TO COURT SOON FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS I BEEN SAYING IT ..from drowning any more but its nice to see such a warrior ve so humble its not easy being eaten from the inside i tried joing the marines to go fight knowing i would die if i did least honorable but did not know they wanted healthy men why not send men that are ready to fight and give it all for there Country some of us would have a purpose then as men again cause were so useless to the world now women dont give af the kids dont family i got but like Chris rock said the only people to get un condition love for ever after child hood no matter what are women and kids you think they realize how much harder we have it theres a story dave c talked about his tran friends who killed her self after doing amazing on stage well bombing first best person he knew he said one of the best she jumped off a building and killed her self cause she stuck up for straight black male and they went at her so bad she died by her own hand really by theres ,,,the only group she had left killed her ,,
Already liked Paddy a lot for his fight game.  Seeing how humble and genuine he is makes me like this dude even more now.
He looks like owen heart
Blk guy let him win.  He could of elbowed his face off.
Patty I hope you succeed on many to come
Paddy is a goat
Wow.
I’m a fan of the UFC and Paddy is the real deal . I thought he was all hyped but he is a problem for anyone. Love you for training with the Marines and showcasing your amazing skills. I wish I could had that opportunity in my days with the Marines . Great video with Worlds Finest Fighters ! Paddy thank you.
woke marines
Hell yea
10 - 0 against Marines after the insane workout is really impressive.  Great video!
How about make 10 paddies getting destroyed by single kungfu master...would be more fair...even if nobody at ufc is good enough to face even amature kungfu master..
Imagine how terrifying Paddy would be if these were just his average workouts lmfao. COULD YOU IMAGINE??
Badass episode.  Such a young legend in the making.
train with Royals , not these goons
Baby 556's gotta be those 775's
This is great!
try the british royal marines instead aha
yo belta this
I love this lad I hope you can sponsor me some boxing gloves😂
Every time I see this guy I get more respect for him.
All I see in this video is boots on the mat……. Naaaaa son, I don’t want your staph infection
these videos give me life man I’m gonna run tonight !
He said "sorry I'm a fat bastard"
Currently deployed over seas (Army) & this was a bad ass video
I’m sorry but that last Marine just tapped to shoulder pressure.. that’s never expectable. How are you going to submit to top pressure not even a submission. SMH
I really want this kid to do well in th ufc, type of champion that's good for the sport, good fckn dude
Man looks like  uncle but have all the skills
The problem with society, there are so many fake people acting real, so it's difficult to spot the person who is being themselves and 100% genuine. People do this with this kid. He's as real as you can be.
Hes never Trying that Von Flu choke in the ufc
If you asked someone who didn't know paddy, who in that room would win in a fight I guarantee they wouldn't pick the fattest lad in the room. Paddy is a beast.
When did paddy get a YouTube channel this is amazing lmao
This video lowkey badass af ngl
Fukin murica man!! Hell yeahh
This is sick
Even crazier when you look at the signatures of those marines, they’re all sergeants and captains, that’s insane.
What songs are playing while he’s rolling with the marines?
Such a cool guy to do this!
Honestly hearing paddy talk about how he was feeling in the past genuinely made me cry due to the fact thats how im feeling currently but after hearing him talk about it has opened my eyes. Honestly my inspiration ❤️👑
it's easy with the US Marines.  You have to try it with the Russian marines😂
Scare Ilia   pigpaddy
LETS GO CHRIS GRIFFIN!!
Good lad
Paddy is the freakin Best 💪🏾
He seems like a class act, and a lot bigger than I thought.
It’s badass to see someone in his position be such genuine dude
Whats the song on 5:52 ?
my guyyy. 3 milly in 3 days. Senor Rocketship
Paddy one of the best!!!!
thats impressive!
Great vids mate, no sarcasm but I never thought a man w a bowl cut would inspire me to do better
Anyone picked that nate diaz move on marine 4
2:59 "as I say, sorry I'm so fat lad" 😂🤣
Man i truly hope paddy's hype train never derails, the guy is incredible
all the paddy haters been real quite after this video lol
He kept apologizing “sorry I’m so fat” had me dying 😆😝
You know exactly what all them 10 marines are going to get into now. MMA
the fact he said sorry to every marine who picked him up because his weight
I was already starting to love you before this but seeing you come out to train with some fellow Marines, fucking killer. And I love that you tapped all of them out, some will be butt hurt for a bit but that's exactly what they need to start pushing even harder.
Man said "I'm sorry I'm so fat" 🤣🤣🤣
sick!
Paddy, I'm the current Deputy I MEF chaplain. Thank you for taking the time to not only physically train with my Marines but elevating the importance of being mentally fit. Talking to someone is a demonstration of real courage. Thank you again!!
I’ve kind of stopped watching and keeping up with UFC, but after this video, I have become a Paddy fan and will make sure to watch every fight of his. As a veteran, I can personally say that every soldier, Marine, and military personnel has considered squaring up in a ring with a UFC fighter… seeing Paddy make this fantasy/dream come true is amazing! You have gained my respect, and gained a new fan! 🙏
Big W paddy!
I wonder how many of this lads haters have changed their minds about since his last fight?  Guessing quite a few.
If these Marines entered any BJJ academy the outcome would be the exact same. I can say this confidently, I was in the Corps and I train BJJ.
"As I say sorry I'm so fat man" 🤣
“Sorry lad, I’m a fat bastard”🤣
Good job 👏
its not good to blow up like this point blank period.
Nice
0:02 in he's got a firm grip on that man
Ngannou would eat you for breakfast
The next Conor for sure
The fact that this is hurting marines egos....bro he's a fucking PROFESSIONAL. Yall marines aren't shit compared to him when it comes to hand to hand.
I don't know if he realizes it. But fighting is his second best strait. The dude is a great voice for mental health... for young men and older...It's real when he actually suffered himself. We love you brother!
Damn a flawless 10? Dude came in with the tan belt and left as a black belt instructor 🤣
Paddy the machine!!!
British people in a nutshell we swear alot apologise alot and tend to take the piss out of ourselves and everyone around us 🤷‍♂️
All the weight must go straight to his face. Dude still looks super strong at 200. I can't imagine doing any workout that hard and then grappling afterwards. it puts into perspective how good of an athlete he is.
If it’s more than 2 weeks from the fight Patty is gonna weigh at least 260lbs hahahahaha HOW DOES HE CUT LIKE THAT?!
teach them, my boy
さすがUFCファイター。
MAD RESPECT!!!
His accent is everything 😂😂
That was some crazy shit
Ufffff amazing ! Marines did it quite well haaa!  Too much workout !..   Fkng Paddy he's the man
Much Love to you Paddy!
Even the youtube translator doesn't understand what he says
Damn. Looks just like Owen Hart.
I feel like even if this man wasn’t a fighter he’d still be famous
A specialist on Jiu Jitsu stomps on jiu jitsu noobs is all what i see. u dedicated ur life to master ground fighting & grapelings; What did u expect ofc 10vs1 is no problem.
So how much did tax payers pay for these guys to get beat up?
Paddy being carried on someone’s shoulders apologising for being fat is the funniest thing I’ve seen this week 😂
America vs uk? We’ll just send the scousers. 🏴‍☠️🤣😭
He apologized for being fat cause he didn't realize he would be carried. True Lad always thinking of someone else but willing to do the work
Why is this dude so overweight all the time.  Grow up  or you will fail
What the hell is going on at 2 seconds in lol? Am I the only one seeing this?
Wow just goes to show, all that daily dozen stuff is fine until you have to go hands on...
Great down to earth guy.
I'm so sorddy I'm so fat
class Paddy...:)
Haha he really said "every time Paddy taps. The next marine goes in"... no words have ever been eaten so fast 🤣🤣 good show though!!!
1:31 wtf that was my knowledge hat lol
Funking impressive Lad.
up until now all i know abo you is a MMA athlete from Ireland with weird hair.. but i love your personality
just show the whole paddy vs marines, no need for this music or editing
Mates, this is what I needed for today!
He takes out marines like they’re children 😵
Next time invite Khamzat and Darren Till 🤣
they understand 40% of what hes sayin
Absolutely amazing lad. Such an inspiration to many fighting mental health issues. Can’t wait to see the magic this guy will bring to the UFC next 💪🏼
Class paddy ! Anybody out there with those  dark thoughts of harming yourself please go speak to people lost two family members brothers , I wish everyday I could of helped x
How many times did Paddy apologize for being fat lmao.
I have a message that I’m sharing where I can, some may  not want to hear this, but I ask that we stay polite and seek truth together. 😊   Love is an action. Feed the hungry, house the homeless, father the orphan, and protect the defenseless and vulnerable.  Read the Word for yourself, not only relying on others for guidance. Pray for guidance.Yahushua/Yeshua - His Hebrew name who is usually called (Jesus) taught to keep the whole Word. Including the Law/Torah. Matthew 5:17 “Do not presume that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill. 18 For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not [g]the smallest letter or stroke of a letter shall pass from the Law, until all is accomplished! 19 Therefore, whoever nullifies one of the least of these commandments, and teaches [h]others to do the same, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever [i]keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." Read 1 John. John tells us that sin is lawlessness, and that we must keep the commandments. Trust in the atonement of Yahushua/Yeshua who is usually called Jesus, and keep God (YHWH)'s whole Word/commandments. Revelation 12:17 So the dragon was enraged with the woman, and went off to make war with the rest of her children, who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus. Revelation 14:12 Here is the perseverance of the saints who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus. Go to parableofthevineyard youtube channel for information about the bible and good bible studies. I'm in no way paid or sent by him for advertising. I just have learned a lot from his content. He's just a man who is trying to learn as well. :) Yeshua died so we may be resurrected to eternal life.....
My man
Great video.  Only thing I did spot which I am fighting clueless so it might not have made any difference but when he is taking on the marines tapping them our Paddy is not wearing socks so prob has better gip on the mat than the marines (all wearing socks so slippy (?)).  I don't know he probably would have beaten them all one at a time regardless (he is pro wrestler / fighter its his bread and butter they are marines) but yeah great video.  Paddy love him and Marines thanks for their hospitality to a Liverpool lad paddy awesome.
What language is this gentleman speaking?
He training with the marine raiders best of the best the corps has.
Just saying but if paddy gets his legs around you your done no doubt about it 😂
He beeps out swear words but flips off everyone 🤣
That ju sitsu is something else  It’s like a python attacking prey
Absolutely brilliant video. Hate to say I used to not like paddy. I couldn't take to him. But I see his real side, and he's refreshing to see. The UFC for me has gone stale. To many wannabes and shit talkers. And tbh the quality of fight nights is going down. But seeing paddy working with the marines was brilliant. Down to earth and an animal getting through that workout. 🤢🤢💦💦💦💦💦💦💦💦
I have been out for a while now and I see that there is still no direction in military physical training. Just a bunch of ultra repetitive exercise that causes more harm than good. Anyway, I would not tap for Paddy, I would let him choke me out lol 🤣
What a cool day out, i loved the mutual respect. I suffer from depression and he's right, those who care will stand by you, it's a great way of finding out who your true friends are. Well done lad, you are a breath of fresh air.
That was amazing man well done
someone stop this guy hes a different breed lad
paddy is such a real man i love him being here in southern california WE LOVE U !!!
Men mental is really matter. It's like a disease that kill you everyday. Hope guys all there are ok don't give up brother 💪 no matter what be happy.
He strangles them like a snake Good work!!
Boss episode! Well in Paddy
Not only is he an absolute madman in the cage, but the lad also produces some great content! He don’t miss! 🔥🎯
Damn, that Q&A though. You a real one
wasnt expecting a scouser omg hi from home
Awesome training
Paddy the Fatty.
Is it really that hard to find a cameraman who isn't epileptic?...
Paddy the warrior!!!!! Love from france!!
Song Name? 😁
That was sick dawg
Just found this channel .guy reminds me of Owen hart in a way .loving this channel
Respect!!!
"I'm sorry I'm so fat" 😆 🤣 😂
Great!
You're not fat mate, just well made. Is this normal training for Marines or are these lot fitness enthusiasts?
Awesome Vid!
I love it! Semper Fi!
I'm interested how many people can understand his accent?
Beautiful gifts at the end there! Keep being an awesome bloke paddy!!!
"I have to say sorry, I'm so fat."
Any active or prior US military person cracked up just like me when the marine handed him the challenge coin in the hand and instead of shaking his hand and taking it, Paddy just picks it up lmao. He obviously would never know the tradition but that shit cracked me up.
this is a fucking premium level youtube video Paddy!!! Absolute legend
Love videos like this👌Up the Paddy lad❤
McGregor and Paddy…the best! Paddy as a complete monster. Why, because he advocates for mental health. He is a monster of a fighter. A preverbal tough who displays “weakness”. He encapsulates what a man is. Protector of both physical, mental and emotional. In my opinion.
Good vídeo
Best jiu jitsu fat man
its sad he he says sorry im so fat when hes healthier than most people on the planet im sure people speakin on it made it that way but keep up the great work
I was bought to give him the biggest props until I whatched the video a second time and found out he just sparred with a comm unit and didnt goto the mace in Quantico Virginia and roll with the real mcmap instructors.
Lost my brother to suicide. And to know that paddy the baddy advocate mental health really hit home.
4:05 a palma
🙏🏽🔥
That's how he is a real warrior, because he find a way to overcome his problems and go forward. I was very impressed when he talked freely about the problems he had ! Respect !
oooh ooooooh ooooooh uuuuuh
Tons of respect from me for everything you do, but especially being a spokesman for mental health. Its not talked about enough, you have an impact Paddy!
7:10  Marine: Stalemate? Reset?  Paddy: No Lad just catching me breath. I'll roll over and tap you in a second lad.
The jump lunges alone would have done me in.
Paddy’s a sick Jiu jitsu trainer
Paddy, You are awesome!
Someone let this man meet joe Rohan this very instant
Its like Gladiators vs Soldiers, one is for the battle. The other is for war
I think it's great that our men and women in the armed forces are learning Jiu-Jitsu. It could be the difference between life and death if a struggle with an enemy combatant comes down to grappling. Good on Paddy for showing them a few things.
I've not heard a "sweating me lid off" for a while.
All Marines have to be ju jitsu black belts
The Irish were so involved in the building of American Culture it’s a real joy seeing the Irish in the State’s today. Real Fluid.
bruh should have made a eating video in the chow hall see how much he would eat
love paddy
This is all good but how many situations go to the ground in hand to hand combat in the military
Amazing hustle with the workout, especially at 200+ pounds!
So you’re telling me McMap is a waste of time and failed the MC?
I was in tears the entire time Paddy was just telling people sorry he was a fat ass but watching him sprawl with like 10 marines was amazing to watch, that was a rush to see that.
Paddy about to make more money from his YouTube account than what Dana is paying him lol .
Bruh.. I love that you have a YouTube channel.
Can't believe ya just dealt with 10 fucking marines one after the other, maximum respect geezer
"as I say , sorry I'm so fat lad" 🤣🤣🤣 all love man 💯🙏🤣🤣🤣
you are a nice open kid. Great fighter but thats almost secondary - you seem a good person to know. Stay hard (as Goggins would say)
This guy is pretty cool
Much respect to the US Marines, from England. And to Paddy, a great fighter.
7:15 stalemate.. reset? Lol ok buddy
Is being a marine supposed to mean something other than you're a bullet sponge for the president?
What the hell is a paddy kinda sounds like a gay thing
Wau Paddy 🔥🔥🔥
"I'm so sorry I'm so fat" 😭😭
Paddy "out of condition" eating 10 marines in a row! Technique and attitude count for so much!  Humble, open and honest. A real fighter!
Great video! Anybody know what song is playing during the grappling??
Top lad!
Komm mal zur Bundeswehr / Deutschland....  Sportplan = Hampelmann 10 min. 1× in 2wochen   Fußball ganz ganz wichtig beim Bund 2 Std.  / Rest der Dienstzeit Stube und G36 zerlegt u zusammensetzen  bis das G36 sich aufgelöst.  Der Ton ist hier  ....KZH und bitte ,danke
Max was here
Best man, top g
Good Shit Paddy Way to support the Marines!
What a good guy
It’s hard not to respect Paddy
Why does he crawl with his feet in the air
Great video , paddy’s tha man
always fun reminding M.A.R.I.N.E.S they ate not a branch of the military they are a department of the NAVY....hahaha HONOR COURAGE COMMITMENT  the NAVY CORE VALUES
WOW. 2.6m views on a vlog. This is twice as much as Nate Diaz pre fight interview.  Paddy called his shot. He's massive.
I love how hes so apologetic for the extra pounds when hes realized someone has to carry him literally 😂 hes got a vibe like “damn man i would have thinned out a few if youd have told me ahead of time you were gonna make some goose carry me”
"Sorry lad, i'm a fat bastard" 🤣 and still he dominates.
Sick !
Absolute legend Paddy! What a man, top bloke!
He's a cool mf'r.
He's either apologizing for being fat or flipping someone off its hilarious 😂
This guys a fucking god!
Dang coming from a military family seeing the coin shake brought back memories.
“I was supposed to do a 3 mile run today, that’s not happening now…” 😆😆
Getting that coin has a lot of meaning, I have two of them from contracting. This was an excellent video, really enjoyed it.
Sorry I’m so fat lmao 😂
I love Paddy so goddamn much man. YNWA!
well done ,you a good man brother.
Paddy such a beast📈
W
He went to go shake patty's hand with the coin but paddy didn't know we do corky stuff like that :D
these are the people training to protect youre contry XD they all got sat down by a little blond guy hahahahh   ..jk i love paddy he a beast fr !
Paddy the Fatty!! 😂  Just kidding just kidding. Nothing but love! Just looks like you’re bulking up to me. 💪
It looks like he lost weight  from the beginning  to the end of the video
I love this guy! He’s got an amazing beautiful spirit and stays grounded. Stay baddy Paddy!!
Paddy apologizing for his weight just before he crush them all in jiujitsu! Love you mate, you did pick up those face cheeks but I know you still in shape and eat all thosse nonsense in the league,  keep on the good work lad! Can't wait to see your next combat against Francis :P
Coolest down to earth fucker thats been around for a while....Paddy you are a Bad Ass Mahfuckah.......
Well done Lad!
me when my homie forces me to workout 1:20
he looks like dean ambrose while bulked up
HOW IS HE SO STRONG WHEN HE IS SO SMOL
Wrestling conditioning different tho
Can someone plz tell me what the song is while sparring
Seriously humbling you going to the Top  In out off the Arena 🥇💪
I know some of the Marines
Absolute class act.
What the hell is the submission at 7:35?
He is such a fcng animal when fighting but he is a super sweet guy
I've been a fan for a couple of years and now I'm even more of one! Very cool guy and uniquely authentic person. Savage fighter as well!
Lol... Sorry for being this FAT....😅😅😅
9:00 such trite shit, no one responds positively unless you're a super star.
What the fuck is a bagggh?
This dude is a transformer
Guy is legit a great person….more I watch of him the more I respect at him.
The talent and skill gap...holy cow! Paddy would have to be near catatonic for one of these marines to beat him
Marines don’t clap.. or smile. Get some
those were consecutive ? fuhhh..
language!!!!
Only problem is a Marine is going to have weapons on them.  Blades are a bitch.  This is not fight this is sport and a Marine will have a broken bone or black out before tapping out.  There is no tap out in war.
fattss kilinng him 🤣🤣🤣
"Sorry I'm so fat lad"🤣🤣🤣
Damn this camera work bout made me fucking nauseous.
Refrain from using ur middle finger
THE BADDY!!
Fat Paddy apologizing LMAO gotta love the skowzer!
Sorry lad I am a fast bastard ™ ahahahahah :)
hardly even sweating. what is this the real world paddy
PADDY IS THE BEST
Marines are slackers nowadays,  1 guy beating 10 Marines, wow.
Never apologize for your weight man 💯🔥 fuck them haters and trolls!
I love paddy , he cananipulate his weight so well ! . Paddy is an artist !
Life isn't a mental condition. Life is being able to over come the obstacles that face you some make through some don't . Mental health is very different from living life that tosses curve balls at you every day of the week. Some can't get away from what the toss brings them thus getting caught up in a world win full of shit some climb over it as it was nothing others get get taken deep into the abyss and never come back and if your taught at a young age things you shouldn't be taught then life is even harder to climb. A solid foundation is built by you you take the parts needed as you grow you decide your destiny if you hold onto crap it will mold you into it if you teach it you mold others hopefully they can decipher through it and build a foundation worth starting a future on.
Fatty the patty
Marines are gay confirmed
Turn to Jesus people he died for your sins, Repent of what the New Testament describes as sin. Believe the gospel obey the teachings of Jesus documented in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Jesus is the only way to be saved, be baptized if you have faith in Jesus then you will live life with him as your example. If you need prayer i'll pray for you. If you want to keep contact with a brother in Christ i’ll keep contact with you. The love of God is beyond our understanding. God bless.;
But he's wearing shorts lol and definitely isn't wearing boots lol
i know im not in camp pendleton, but i feel like you just gave all of us marines one of the biggest boosts in morale giving your time to them
You're a good fuckin lad, Paddy.   You've got a great sense of humor, but more than that - you're showing me it's okay to be okay with getting some help. Depression is no joke. And the more of us guys who can come out and talk to someone about it - the sooner we can end this stigma of "Men don't talk". Cheers, mate!
What a great human being .
You are a brother now Paddy. Welcome!
Damn this hit home for me thank you
Videos in spanishhh!
This guy tank is crazy... All that drill and wrestling 10 marines is crazy.
Those gifts at the end were amazing
True champion not just in MMA but life.
I love the sincerity in the apologies.  Thanks for the content!
Khamzat vs Paddy would destroy the internet. Hope we can see this at one point.
That von flute choke was sick I never seen it done from that angle
This was great to watch
3:05 are these the lunges shit again? 🤣🤣🤣
Idk who this guy is. But you gained my respect
“I’m so sorry I’m so fat” 🤣🤣🤣
Tapping starts at 5:45 min mark. 🍺
Dude said reset in the worst possible position 😂
Eyyyy camp Pendleton I was born there.
Paddy is so far from fat it’s crazy. He is fucking ridiculously in shape.  He needs to stop apologizing
I wish BJJ was big here when I took martial arts. I've been with Judo forever but plan on taking BJJ for fun.
That ammo box piece , with thier signatures on it , would mean the world to me. Because they thought it through , and then put thier personal touch on it, i would treasure that more than Gold Watch , or Gold ring , or what ever.
Whats the name of the song during the rounds? 6:05
Paddy I wish you well in your UFC career. You are a talented and skilled young man.
POGs
Would love to try some of these workouts, anyone know the routine/workouts, reps/sets that they do??
We're those marsoc marines he was training with?
Grappling/Jiu Jitsu is the best martial art to know for sure in a real street fight
I’ll never take him seriously with that hair cut
Great video much respect to Marines & Paddy !
“I don’t know what the fuck made me want to do this!” 🤣🤣🤣🤣 That’s what I was thinking before I got on the plane to San Diego
Having important and notably strong figures like Paddy advocate for mental health is what really moves the public attitude out of prejudice and towards education. I really appreciate you speaking to the world about issues that men face - depression, suicide, loss of self worth, self harm - that oftentimes are seen as signs of weakness and thus suppressed until they become dangerous. I really hope you keep advocating for all of us who have been in a dark place or know someone that has been there, and that one day we can have strong men like you convince the world that everyone is susceptible to darkness - but it's the people around us that let us shine. You're a wonderful role model Paddy and I hope you stick around for a long long time
This should be a drinking game challenge: Everytime he says "Sorry I'm so Fat"                        Take a drink                                                3min in your wobbling , 5 min in your almost unconscious , 7 min in Your clinically Dead
If I had known sooner that Mr. Baddy had a channel, I'd have enjoyed this awesome content sooner. Paddy is such a great guy, no wonder I knew I liked him almost immediately.
That 10th Marine was wild. There were so many moments where the submission moves looked a little...sus.
I bet Paddy gets invited to the marine Corp Ball by a female marine lol.
Now imagine what Khabib will do to those guys..
Paddy Tapping Marines Out Left Right And Center Fuck
Why do these vids featuring Marines always go to some POG bat?  Where are the jack-nasty ptsd machines over on the infantry side?  They’ll give you a run for the money.
Bro is making more money off yt than ufc
OOHRAH
Very competitive Fatman.
Paddy is a true gentleman 😂
The more I see of him the more I like him. At first I couldn’t stand him
Let's Goo!! Fire it uppp!!!!
paddy impresses me
Paddy has to get off the cheese burger diet what weight class will he be in
Paddy, you legend. This is great.
Paddy, we have similar life experiences. don't get peer pressured into too much liquor. peace and love lad.
Paddy honestly seems like a really decent man!
As a Marine, believe me when I say that this is going to be one of the most memorable moments of their lives. Not just because they got to meet a famous person; BUT because they trained as warriors with a warrior.
Awesome stuff, great rolls
So awesome!
Bro I know he's speaking some positive stuff... But I can't understand anything he saying 😂
The way his partner was punching😂😂
love that we have people like Paddy these days, we need em'
Oh wow, how inspiring, I'm an x-Marine and I truly enjoyed this video, Paddy is so cool, a real humble dude and a bad azz son of gun,lol, but I had to try hard to understand him, very strong English assent, now I know what I would sound like to them,lol, :)
Honesty, ability and humbleness makes a person great.
These pro guys have abilities in their own field, but put them out of their elements and they just have a hard time. I have had employees that always went to the gym and had a rock hard body, but put them out there cutting trees and brush and stacking it for 8 hours and rarely do they return for the second day and never has one made it a full week. I will take the skinny kid all day long though.
As a vet that has battled mental health crisis regularly/daily, I really didn't expect the video to take the turn it did and I have so much respect for Paddy after this. This was great.
Yo Paddy wassup. I wasn’t really interested in UFC and when I started watching some some of your videos and fights I got really hooked. Keep up the great work.
Those marines looked strong af in the spars.
Dafuq was he saying....I could understand like 20% of the words.
Love to see it. Branching more and more into the American market. Great guy trying to make a name for himself but still shows respect towards them.
Paddy the fatty?
Went full Nate Diaz on the cameras
Absolutely smashing it with the videos lad, congrats
Bro I love Paddy Semper fi brother RHAA
hes didnt shake his hand
I wish he didn’t fluctuate his weight i not very healthy
Wondering why you picked a soft skill outfit over an actual infantry bat but fun video and you're a stellar dude.
Paddy is one of the realest
I love how my mans just grabbed the challenge coin from the hand… rip the handshake hahahah
This is awesome !!
Scouser ☝️❤️
Absolute legend. The lad was hanging out his arse and still tapped 10 marines in a row.  This is the difference in levels.  People see paddy as a joker, but when he turns it on, that's it. The mark of a warrior.  Well done lad 💪🏻👊🏼
Believing in yourself is HUGE! The old saying is so true…whether you think you can or think you can’t, you’re right.
He's s Scouser. He never gets knocked out! 😄
Great video
Paddy needs to be the grappling trainer for the USMC
“I’m sorry lad, I’m a fat bastard”😂
Ssgt nimphie👀
Fucking love this guy! ❤
Soy BOYS
never seen any of these episodes lol but the parts where he apologizes about being fat is fucking killing me lmao
omg, I'll bet he could hardly move the next morning to get out of bed.  These leathernecks may have tapped out on the mat, but, they put his ass through the wringer in their workout routine. Much respect to all.
Yo paddy is the best person hands down dude beats the hell out of people for a living but spreads peace love and positivity you’re like the kick ass angel of badassitude 🤟🏽🤟🏽
Jesus loves you
Super cool paddy.
Ace!
Bon délire il se prend pas la tête. Très bon combattant MMA Mais punaise j'arrive pas à suivre son accent 😀. Reviens à Saint Denis boire un café, ils sont parti les parasites promis 😀 Merci pour cette video
I appreciate how Paddy was able to talk openly about seeking help for mental health issues. I have recently felt the healing power of letting shit off my chest, It felt great and I wish i had sought help a long time ago. Props for keeping it real Paddy.
I'd like to see Paddy in the middleweight division, to be honest
This guy is amazing…I don’t understand half the shit he says but I can tell he is a 💯 true person from what I do understand he says. He’s an inspirational person.
👍👍👍
Paddy has the face of a 300 lb man LOL
PADDYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!
He destroyed them😭 I can’t believe this, NOT EVEN ONE😂😂😭 we must stick to our weapons
What a great sport 👏
Marines are next to the strongest.. Navy seals are the strongest. Their training is 20 times harder than the Marines
This was a good video!
Ole paddy is just a good ole boy. Hope the best for ya buddy
I didn't understand one word paddy said.
Yeah, I'm subscribing after this. Dude is a fucking legend
2.4 million views in 2 days, those are crazy good numbers. I've seen a couple of Paddy's fights, but never really heard him speak in a regular conversation, just the Octagon interviews. I really like the way he spoke with the Marines, especially being honest about taking care of your mental as well as physical health.
When he didn't shake for the coin LOL
I know its pogs but damn paddy making the devils look soft
Lmaooo they shoulda put paddy in a REAL MCMAP pit with mfn tire chipping and see how he gets down😂 the majority of the marine corps ain’t got no fancy ass mats😂
Paddy you have inspired me to eat 3 extra slices of 🍕 🍕 🍕  this evening!
Amazing
As an American to someone from a totally different continent/country, showing respect for our service members is f*king awesome of you Paddy. I’d love to see more content with you involved in our armed forces and others abroad. Hell your own country would be great if you haven’t already!
Relatively Unknown MMA guys goes into a "ring" with Marines, and it's "kinda hard" and we all cheer.  Now, let's put that dude in a 100x100 pit with an 11B, each having a Pistol, and see how that goes.  I hate this country (Retired MSG)
U know when someones gaslights on when they attacking off there back so much 😆
PADDY!!!!
I don’t watch MMA but there’s something about this dude that just makes me like him.
Doing the right things to become a bigger celebrity here in the US
Google needs to create a "Paddy Translator". I'm not even sure how much of that was in English. ;)
God I miss the Marine Corps 😭😂
Paddy the baddy the fatty. Love this dude ❤️
The fact he called that fat ur moving when your fat your on the 600 pound life don't see that I see a fucking 🥂 champ
Love and respect for Paddy from Tunisia
What a legend
Paddy is a class act
Bad ass ! 💪💪💪💪😎
10 marines lol outstanding
I hope the Corps didnt just throw a bunch of PFCs at the guy...
Bruh why is everyone treating this guy like he’s the world champ at anything😂
Damn Paddy is pooching out a bit idn't he?
What’s the song at 5:50? Anyone know?
Paddy the marauder, there’s no one like him, he makes boys out of men
Dude has been training all week, did all the crazy shit in the beginning, and still tapped out 10 marine sgts.
What a cool guy
them boots n utes make it so much worse too
Paddy is comedy gold!
Real talks man ...my attitude towards you has done a 180 brother.... You are such a great advocate for mental health and positive attitude.... Well done brother
great pleasure having you!  we had a great time!
Almost 2,5 milli in 2 days jesus christ
Ok this is different then say fighting one of these guys at height of a adrenaline rush during say a urban battle where there humanity has been switched off and only the killer instinct remains.. I could be wrong…
Don't ever mess with the blackheart Owen Hart! He was in the Nation of Domination!
apologizing for "being a fat bastard" everytime someone lifts him.  Paddy "the fatty" is quickly becoming one of my favorite fighters.
Not a big UFC fan, but this was a beautiful watch. Kudos to the participants, and the coordinators. Good shit.
The guy who was leading the exercises, GySgt Fleming, was actually my senior DI. Pretty dope
Marines should have submitted Paddy and cut his hair off
Stumbled across this channel just now. Liked the man before for his performances in the ring and his talk outside, now I really like the dude. Heard a lot of talk about him being fat, a little cheeky but far from fat.
If he can make weight everytime, there is no excuse for mma fighters to miss weight
This is great
7:21 mans rested his hand in Paddys full shaft then realized where his hand was
That was dope
Paddy made some really good friends, Marines sacrifice so much, really nice to see someone giving back. The Marines do Toys for Tots, maybe Paddy can be Santa.
Reminds me when a... 14 yr old?? Tested me once.... his mistake... I know his mom and the man babysitting him because he can handle this kid.  He went at me with a dart to stab me. I made him kiss his knees refusing to let up until he admitted it and appologized.  Funny thing. My buddy said "you're lucky...  if he beat your ass for that I wouldn't even care."  Funnier It was retold by my buddy. Mom said 2 things. "Fuck SHAGGY GOT ROUGH?!" (I'm not violent) 2 "Yea dipshit deserved that one."  If you knew me.... you'd know I'm not rough to kids but he came at me. He is lucky I only wrestled him to make him look embarrassed. An adult? You might get stabbed.
Ya ganga big bastards hahahaha
This comment he said on 10:00  is just so good and very humbled of him to say, shows that really anyone can beat you in a fight and that anyone could be the best with the right mindset. I already see paddy to be one of the future greats, keep going paddy your a hell of a fighter and an even better person.
what a great training sesh
"I have to say..Sorry im so fat lad" 😆 🤣
He still would have won but grappling in socks is so incredibly hard. Don’t know why they wouldn’t take them off.
Paddy the goody! Thanks for what you are doing and for taking the time to do it!
Very entertaining. Barely understood a word he said, but very entertaining.
"Sorry, lad, i'm a fat bastard"😂
he is just so nice, so charismatic. just crazy to see a professional fighter, and a great one being this goofy
Damn. Is that bones jones?
Why did they send him to 9th comm. one of the fucking weakest units in the Marine Corps.
Wow a sweaty boris johnson.
To all you fools that think you can beat up pro MMA fighters because your undefeated on the streets. These trained Marines had no chance against paddy, even shark tanking him with continuous fresh opponents. Any UFC fighter will whoop your ass like your in kindergarten.
I wanna see this guy on Joe Rogan.
I didnt care for him, thought he wasnt humble  but i see that you need to sell yourself.  With that said evrything he is doing in advocating for mental health and just how he used his platform to show his vulnerability was awesome to watch.  Hope it helps someone in need of that message he was trying to get across. From readinf some of the comments i can see that it has reached a few people on here.  Forever a fan mate.
Paddy could invade America
That was cool, Paddy seems like a good dude
This guy is so likable
The speed of this man on the mat, Jesus lmfao
“I’m sorry I’m so fat”😂😂
Welp, this video just increased the Marine Corps recruitment numbers.
Great video, but bad camera man. Mf shakes like he cold as hell🥶
Was that a von flue choke??? Fuck me paddy, go easy on the lads!
Im sure it's been said already; Patty the Fatty.      K, sorry.
What a down-to-earth dude. Respect.
Drinking game: Take a shot everytime Paddy shows middle finger
I’m liking being open about shit that’s what people should do ,but in war when there’s people running at you shooting at you or taking a bandit to you or a sword to cut you’re head off and for some reason you  haven’t dealt with your feelings of how come mom never gave you the candy bar going through the register lane or why you wear a dress as a man and now that follows you into war some people are going to die. People are becoming more weak in the head being taught a whole new different reality of what things are truly about. Paddy is a tuff mojo for sure he’s been trained in combat in a ring the two are very different.
The fact paddy could tap out 10 marines back to back after an intense workout is pretty impressive ? No?
Is that SSGT Fleming I see?
Paddy you fought one of my old Marines. Hope he gave you hell. Some days I miss that dojo and the Marines there.
Awesome paddy mad respect
When i hear him talk i think of the movie Snatch
Paddy appligized to everyone who lifted him 🤣🤣
It’s funny and sad he’s probably making more from these YouTube videos than the UFC
But he out grappled 10 Marines....IN A ROW...........in a ROW.
Camp Pendleton representing!
I don't think an athlete has ever made me belly laugh and tear up in the same video.  How can you not love this guy? ❤️
I cannot understand dude
This is an insane workout. Just shows how world class these guys are when someone like Paddy is doing this while “out of shape”
As I say sorry I’m so fat lad 💀
your the best Paddy keep giving us great content.
Paddy the Baddy is my dude
Wonder why people love this guy!  Genuine!
10:48 - I'M GUNNA SHAKE YOUR HAND, I'M GUNNA SHAKE YOUR HAND
That dude that gave him that stuff needs to talk you could hear it in his voice
Paddy living a good life
Dope!
Ufc junkie
The world needs more people like Paddy.
So funny watching him grab the challenge coin it’s normally a hand shake rotate and it’s in the receivers hand but he just grabbed it 😂😂even the marine looked a little shook
This goes to show you how easy they make it look in the octagon. These young jacked marines would take on your average Joe, and paddy submitted 10 back to back like nothing
Wtf is he saying i cant understand what hes saying lol or am i too hi 😂
Love how he goes to shake the coin in the hand (typical military tradition is to shake hands with the coin sandwiched in between as you shake) and Paddy just picks it up out of his hand lol   Awesome video Paddy, love your style, love your commitment to the sport.
Figures he’s from Liverpool 😂
Okay weaver i see you, boot!
I'm high asf this cool
The best thing is that he looks like a fat looser but at the same time can kill people. That contradiction is why people loves him 🤣🤣
Respect! 🫡
"or if you got 7arms" Paddy vs Goro from mortal Kombat confirmed next ufc fight
Damn Owen Wilson can fight this well?
His cheeks were smaller by the end. :) Haha this dudes a gd gift to us. Love his attitude and mentality. I pray for nothing but the best for this human. Also, went ham on em.
Paddy is lucky that these marines are holding back, they could kill him in 3 seconds, Paddys a cool dude but there's levels to this
paddy is just a solid fucking lad
I’ve become a big fan of you, recently. I appreciate you coming and training with our military. Mad respect from a fellow veteran 🇺🇸
Good ole 9th crime
He’s a great ju jitsu trainer
Of course the female wasn't going to carry Paddy. She couldn't, and that's just one, of many reasons, why women should not be in the military.
How can you not love this man
looks like crossfit
Paddy deserves his fame. Hope he will Indeed drop every opponents he mets as long as he remain the good Guy like GSP.
Keep it up man. Such an inspiration!
RESPECT
scotland 🇬🇧
all the marines are wearing socks and have no grip.. doesnt mean they would beat you without them but still
NOTHING WAS BELOW PARALLEL!!! Im so upset.
They probably should have taken their socks off.
Why does Paddy blow up in weight when not fighting, hope all is good with him
3:00 Paddy, lad you don't need to apologize for your weight I feel bad every time you mention it. Just be yourself no need to apologize we know you can cut weight easily
They should’ve just had him do a CFT. I’ve never seen anyone feel good after that 😂
God bless you all and your families 🙏🏽✝️🛐
i struggle with depression and have been in dark places as well, and talking about it to your support system is the only way you'll see change. great vid Paddy :)
Paddy is about as genuine as it gets. I hope he can focus on fitness more for longevity.
Stop you're making me tear up what a wonderful experience for everyone even us viewing I needed that encouragement I've been dealing with depression
Did he call the girl big and she got offended . I honestly want this dude poster and I'm 37 .
I forgot what this used to be like
Paddy is definitely in the group of fighters that you can't hate on.
Marines are always good company.
Country strong
Paddy is by far the most REAL WHOLESOME dude out there in the MMA . Speaking up for men, wanting them to speak up and deal with mental health. EVERYTHING the guys a stand up lad. It would be a honor to live a day in the life with Paddy. Much love from Canada <3 @Paddy The Baddy
6:09 He ate a proper elbow there and then gave it back to the marine in the form of a proper guillotine. Savage.
Fuckin Rah😂
https://youtu.be/8UdKc4D79sI
My fatass would happily work out with Paddy. The pain, grind, and success of hard work knows no size, but does know the mental. Great video.
Nothing to do w the vid but double ads you can’t skip is a pisstake
Paddy you are the fucking goat.
Too bad people don’t fight with hands anymore, this is just for sport. Now it the rifle range...
That was awesome. I'm a 60 year ole has been who wrestled from 8 years old till about 22. Close to multiple State Champ, then multiple NCAA champ but never was. I look at Paddy here, and think I would have destroyed him at the same age... tilllllll the end when he showed his stuff w/ the 10 Marines. Much love and respect too ALL involved w/ this!!! Paddy... paaaaalllleeesseee try to stay a wee bit more in shape between fights.
Until you started bjj versus with them, they were like “ayo what can this little man do to us” as soon as you started submitting them “chill chill daddy Paddy”
Devil dogs , take your socks off.
Is it me or pAddy’s face looking bloated ?
You should keep training those guys till they can beat you.
Paddy is a living legend!
What a guy, I wish I had his confidence and his belief in his self. 🙏
Be indomitable!
Top guy, likeable and down to earth.  I hope he reaches the top 🙏
0:44 “some marine cunts” 😂😂 I love it👌🏻👌🏻 The shitty thing about the first half, is that would just be the PT portion of MCMAP. That’s not the whole course
fuck yeah - this guy needs to get more love
I love how the US loves this guy lol
his skill is top notch awesome
Paddy you got a fan for life brother!
Amazing video man
Funny Marines already know some of these submissions, however, he is a little more indebt with it especially pushing someone away making a better angle for that triangle WOW
I guarantee he was instructed to not embarrass the marines and not to hurt any of them. Im not calling marines sissy’s I’m just saying they are not professional hand to hand fighters. Now put a rifle in their hands and put patty the baddy against them and patty be in some serious trouble
Love this guy!
he gave you a free shirt wth lol
he is awesome I love paddy fun to watch and truly respectful
What a great Q&A.  Paddy is truly a real decent person and I hope he continues to do well in the UFC.
So slippery in socks.
Paddy done well but wouldn't last 30sec with a boxer his chin is exposed.
The Marine's grappling was really good, Paddy was just so much faster in his movement and getting back up from the ground.
Ya can't not love Paddy, what a nice caring fun guy he is. You are the people's champ.☝💪
During basics I was at a recovery platoon called MRP1 where many of us had thoughts of giving up and I remember one of the drill instructors gave us motivational talks. He woke many of us up saying “Quitting is permanent solution to a temporary problem” - Drill Instructor Sstg Nimphie 1:45
Paddy is legendary. What an awesome dude.
What a cool video!
2:58...  You can see this Marine could care less about this guys weight because the Marine knows if his 200+lbs buddy goes down and he's in the best position to save him, he's doing it without hesitation.
it looked like paddy lost weight after the workout
I love how they missed censoring the word "cunt" because of his accent hahaha.
Not to talk sht but I think he gets tapped twice at the All Army Combatives School....  the MACP program is better than the Marine one like Marine Bayonet training is better...just saying
Damn Paddy did not just submitted 10 marines in one go
PATTY GOT BIG
Paddy is a beast for being out of camp and able to go that long grappling 😤😳
They should have taken him to the range and show them what they can do.
everytime paddy was lifted "SORRY IM A FAT BASTARD"😂still a fucking Baddie
You would think that his PT to fighting skill ratio would show how pointless Marine PT is after a certain point.
One scouser to tap a whole room of marines is right paddy la absolute machine of a man.
This SOB knows comedic timing at a decent level
The only thing I would trade my srt8 300 for💯
Does Paddy know the marines are holding back.  Their taught to fight to kill. No submit.
I hated those jumping lunges my entire military career!!!
It's good to see he didn't forget to work the middle finger, never skip middle finger day.
9:18-9:23....uhm......????dafuq.... ????
Good stuff
Bruh I wish I was tall lmfao
Amazing 😻
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the marines for their service to Israel and ZOG.
What an awesome commisssure Paddy helps the marines with Jujitsu and they help him cut some weight
Looking like Owen hart quoting Bret gotta love it
My dad did two tours in Viet Nam as a Marine..this was good to see.
Ppl who like this  should watch bisping talk bout him and Carlos condit over seas
sorry lad im a fat bastard xDDDDDDD
Paddy fan for sure!! I love how he encourages those around him to better themselves.
Title should be: Paddy vs 10 POG Marines
Paddy mate, I've watched the numbers on this video go mad high over the last couple of days.
I have so much respect for you man, you're inspiring to a lot of people, and a great  role model for the younger generations.  Keep being you bud, can't wait to see you at the top.
🙅‍♂️🇧🇷
Good thing there are subtitles. Paddy has a wild accent.
Good man
Well dam im subbed
Good job Paddy !!
king
“What was in it? Grenades or M16 ammo?”  “Oh uh 5.56” *being English “not able to own possess firearms”*  “Nice” 😂
That's a MAN!
80% of video: "sorry I'm fat" 20% of video: "lad"
YUUUUUUTTTTTTTTT!!!!
Next fight we see from paddy we’re gonna hear “MARINE CORPS” after every strike 🤣🤣
Guy is cool AF.
“ sorry lad, I’m a fat bastard “ lmao
I love how he kept apologizing for being fat 🤣🤣🤣🤣
love this positive motivation!~
Love the guy but his weight flux is dangerous..
I love that paddy is popping off here in the US I’m literally seeing him on all these podcasts and now this.
I'm so fat I'm so fat ....and then choked out 10 people AFTER the work out 😂
Anyone know the name of the song during the rolling scene?
Paddy just seems like a really good guy all around. On that note, give your business manager a raise bc the type of content you’ve been putting out is so perfectly apt for the space you occupy. Also smart as shit to create alternate revenue flows while you’re still fighting. 10/10
Literally watching this brilliant man makes my day!! Cannot thank him and everyone in these comments enough... Thanks to everyone who's a top human being with respect it goes a long way!!! Thanks again man I appreciate it!! Sorry I keep saying thanks just the way I am when I see real people!!! ❤️❤️
You are what a real man should be!
Any time you see paddy you can’t help but become even more of a fan!
BEAST
6:35 that ankle lock almost got it... well not really but wicked!
quite impressed some of those marines were able to hold their own for some time, shoot one of them even had full mount which for going up against someone who does this for a living thats quite the feat
This was an absolutely incredible video Paddy! Appreciate the words of wisdom and advice!
The whole video is Paddy apologizing for his fatness to various marines
Just awesome!!
I was a skeptic for the longest, seingbyou workout and not be an ego with a mouth is quite impressive.
You're a legend Paddy.
It's nice to see 9th comm bn finally get some new facilities.
Genuinely decent guy. Wish him every success.
I like Paddy, hes got great personality. Mad respect for him visiting the Marines and working with them. Class act.
Can we get a translator please
All those shoes on the Matt 🥺
This was awesome
"Sorry I'm so fat" 😭😭🤣🤣🤣🤣
I couldn’t understand anything he was saying😂
You are a inspiration for us all.  Keep kicking butt.
From a fitness perspective you should incorporate this training as part of your fight preparation paddy,it looked a decent workout not withstanding that more experienced ju-jitsu sparring partners would push you more however the physical exercise looked very difficult,fair play to you on your openness I don't see no ego with you,belief and ego are two different animals good luck for your future.
Amazing!!!!!!
Brother, I had to subscribe. This was awesome. Maybe one day you will come train with the Army and beat our asses too.
Feel like the socks fucked the marines. He still woulda hosses em all but still
Already proper loved this guy, seeing this makes Paddy a fast favorite.
I too have only recently been following Paddy. Most people don’t even know his last name, and “Baddy” was self proclaimed after his first W! The man’s ambition at life tho… after this one, I’m a believer! He wants to do so much more then just UFC! I mean I heard movies, between him and Steve-O; & I don’t have a doubt after this one! I think home and Owen McGregor should do like a motor bike episode or something!?! Let’s get that shite out there people!?
MCMAP is fake martial arts. Paddy will 100% body any Marine black belt
"if I hurt meself it's on you" "No,it is NOT on me"  💀😂💀😂💀 Fuckin menace
Imagine if paddy stayed at 200 to fight, he’d honestly be a beast in that class
He walks around at 200 pounds and yet fights in the lightweight division, that’s crazy!
Does anyone else think this makes the Marines look bad? Not one Marine could overpower a tired man? I remember being 19 at my first Judo class and held out until I was physically exhausted. This is what Biden has done to the military.
That diet you do might not be helping
To all the fighters that sh!t on Paddy bc he’s increased his stock at record speed, and you don’t know why or how… this is why. The platform (that is the UFC) only throws you an alley-oop. You have to catch that ball and dunk it. Instead of being jealous and talking sh!t, how about taking some pointers from this guy. He’s literally increasing his value with every view. Use his content game as a blueprint, and get to work. You’re doing it right Paddy 👊👊👊 great content!
I fuckin love the baddy, lmao every time they pick him up, he's like "sorry I'm so fat, me lad". "Sorry mate imma fat bastard"
This MF is killing me.....
paddy fs won the jj matches but they would never even have a chance using socks vs paddy using bare feet grip
dude genuine guy here peoples champ !!
Does anybody actually realize the future generations of p*ssies that are being brought up in this world?  Testosterone is down in men by atleast over 20% over the last 20 years. I've never seen so many beta males scurrying about.  About 99% of the commenters in this thread most likely just jumped on their xboxes and playstations or Netflix. The last generation of men is in the past.  I do realize they're real men and to those men I salute you.  The land of the free and home of the brave is in dire straits. The real heros fight for our freedoms. I see alot less heros and alot less freedoms. Dont be triggered...This message was brought to you by patriotism.
Fireman carries always scary me since I completely tore my MCL and ACL doing it 😭
I'm really liking Paddy's energy, he seems like a real genuine dude, and I'm always a fan of my fellow devil dogs.
Hrs good
bro you can just be paddy its ok
I'm surprised the americans didnt need subtitles lol
paddy is a great guy
down at 190 after that.
His accent, love it. Liverpool accent Woww
Bruh… pause the video at 0:02… am I seeing this correctly? If so, that Marine is a proper Devil Dog.
I like him.
Ur a top lad #paddythebaddy
Love it make this shit go Viral, the boys got you!
love the fact they brought you in to show them what you're capable of. but as a Marine vet, it's saddening and shameful that Marines today aren't being taught everything they should be taught. we're supposed to be the baddest fighting force on the planet....but none of them were trained in how to go against a UFC fighter.  they need much better training.
SUCH A GOOD LAD
They thought he was fat till he started rolling around with them lol
Another banger 🔥🔥🔥
When do the Kaybars come out?
Paddy needs to have a few words with Andrew Tate and let him know what a true champion of the people looks like
The right training that 4th guy could be a problem lol
Paddy made the UFC look REALLY good with those ju jitsu spars. Took on 10 marines in A ROW. Awesome stuff ! Godspeed to you all !
Nice
Rah
Rah
This guy is good, I know he has trained martial arts for god knows how long but the fact that he took on 10 Marines says a lot to me.
Sick hahaha legend paddy
Joe Rogan is at home laughing his ass off
Crayon eaters don't realize it's a bad idea to try to grapple on a mat in socks.
this video is awesome, i think the tips you gave those marines could go a long way, insanely respectful too, good stuff looking forward to more videos
Paddy is definitely an example of "don't judge a book by it's cover"
Wow!!! I got goosebumps that dude is the shit I fuck with Paddy homeboy is the truth!!!!
Top lad. Go on Paddy 👊
Lol only one of his hardest workouts this week 😂
Next jaka saragih from Indonesia
Protect this man. At all cost.
:)
Paddy bigging up England to the marines hardcore shit and they know you're funny bastard you Pad  Cheering you on with any fight you get lad.
Paddy just trying to dust em off. So he can get to the chow hall.
PADDY THE BADDEST
So US marines are a bunch of blueberry cupcakes hahahaha and there i was thinking marines are all 6''6 above and pure muscles tough bastards....they got exposed! now we know how to neutralize them.
I think the guys are pregnant now
“I have to say sawddy I’m so fat” 😂 golddd
Top channel top fighter top human 👍🏻🙏💪🏼 Congrat
what was number 10???? no arm arm triangle?
-You hungry Paddy?  -Nah, had a few Marines for breakfast.
he said stalemate? in a triangle lmao
The repetitive " awh man I'm sorry I'm a fat fuck" 😂😭
Patty lost 10 pounds in this video went to dinner and gained 30 back
Paddy is boss! YNWA
Hell yeah that’s badass. Would be sick if the us military hired mma coaches for hand 2 hand combat training
Paddy bounces back so fast! I’m pretty sure he had a six pack at the end of this video. 😏
"now i'm going to get f*cked up by some Marine cunts"       hahah
What was the song at 5:50
"Stalemate?" While on bottom in a mounted triangle lmao
Great f*cking episode!
That’s what happens when you got a Marine Corps that is pushing you to be a transgender
Bro honestly who can say they were cutting weight with paddy? 🤣 Low-key im jealous
Sorry I’m so far lad 💀💀💀
The Content is absolute quality 👌🏻
Sorry I'm so fat  "Nah you're good"
Damn Paddy fucked 10 Marines? That’s savage
Paddy the Goodie... A legacy in the making... A legend already. Love and respect to you mate!
What a nice and tough guy !! Except that I don't understand half of what he says :D Have to do an internship on the Merseyside :D
Paddy is my fitness idol.  I used to be overweight but now I am obese!
Paddy is a prime example of “Be careful who you talk shit to”
Professional MMA fighters train much harder than marines so idk why Paddy is acting tired for. Marines think they’re the toughest in the military and make fun of other branches, should’ve went hard on them
I’m taller than paddy and weight less but look worse ahahah
them wearing shoes on the mat, kills me
Love Paddy the Baddy.He's real and no bull crap.
i love the q&a at the end mate! i love how open you are!
This is badass
Damn the West coast gets to see/do all the cool shit. Would have loved to be there and roll with Paddy. Semper Fidelis 🤙
Hopefully these marines are better marksman than they are grapplers
Paddy take on 10 guys and he's praised for it, but when I do it I'm gay
“I just say sorry I’m so fat lad”as dude Carries him 😂
the marine in the 6:36 time mark was a drill instructor of mine when i first joined the marine corps, that’s wild! happy to see him doing well and get his ass handed to him😂
This was great and really make me think about what a woman I know said about living in a military town. There's a bunch of semi-ugly, not very bright dudes that are freaking ripped in town.
I like Paddy even more after this
I love this guy, very very cool…
respect bro,,,,
Legend! 👊🏼
Impressive really to beat all of them even when tired and rolling with fresh guys
This is good to go! Any military branch is a team fight. The military tells you, you are not an individual. I was also in the Marines, one on one and you and you may lose! This is good shit and I am now subscribed!
Fuck me, Paddy made that look so easy haha.
Paddy is no little skinny  guy now.  Look out mconner
He can be Patty The Fatty cause this man makes no lactid acid or something!!! Even when he is "out of shape" he just goes goes goes. Impressive lad
one of the greatest video ideas ever man youre gonna be big in mma mate!
Hey paddy just a tip man, when presented a challenge coin it's passed with a handshake, they'll put it in their palm and you shake their hand to take it.
Nice
Thankyou for bein who you are Paddy. You’re words help me and many others like me I’m sure. I always dreamed of gettin a shot to become well known with my singing voice to use it to help bring people to the lord and bring awareness to men that can’t open up. Lately I’ve been hearin of guys I went to school with showin up dead from drug over dose and it’s sad. I know You know all about hearing of loss in your hometown. So thankyou for being the role model that you are.
I like to see everybody respects each other and shows good respect to each other I like to see that. Marine seem like good guys
0:38 seconds in and already subscribed you really can’t hate the guy he wears his heart on his sleeve
Lol as I said sorry I'm so fat lad
Ok
Paddy is always apologizing bout his weight…I love him
Our boy tappin all ur marines out hahahah
You were on Base, sheesh!! Visit Oceanside, beautiful city!
U GAINED WEIGHT AGAIIIIIIIIIIN
Paddy looks like that one dude in Movies that beats up all the bullies of his friend and they are all surprised cause he doesn't look the part
Love Paddy. Non threaten accent at all explaining technique that can kill or maim opponents. Btw, anybody notice Paddy is gradually loose weight through the span of the video? Thats some witch craft stuff
He drops to 155?! HOW!?
"Sorry I'm so fat man" For the first 3 minutes lol. Had me rolling.
Why do you clap so weird 😂
What a beast.
Yo what’s the name of the song while he’s grappling with the marines ?
Can hardly wait to see who he fights next.
great episode 👏 seems like military nd police should do more martial arts training, just saying...
I did this once with a group of marines off base by my house after a night of pong, anyone will tell you marines love to spar and wrestle (been practicing grappling for about 8 years at that point)... great memories. hanging out with those guys changed my whole perspective on life and the world for the better. God bless the United States Marine Corps, get home safe.
I’m pretty sure these are marine raiders lol so not your standard marine
Paddy is a good man!
"I have to say sorry I'm so fat lad" 🤣
These aren’t even standard Marines there marine raiders special forces
I just left Camp Pendleton finished my four years. This is so warming to see people with such a big image take their shoes off and come to our level speak to us and help us. I guarantee 85% of those marines will never forget getting to work with you. Thanks for what you do and more importantly strongest attribute is your character and paddy showed it this day. Good man forsure💯 and 2million views! Marines support ya man
Brilliant butt
LOVE THIS LAD
I can see myself give up like 60 times in such a day doin all that shit xD Im doin 40 burpees, im like no, fuck this lad, imma go binch eat all the shit laying around at me house
Paddy you have been eating a bit too much lately u have become paddy the chubby.. lmfao
Great STuff! I did subscribe
Legend... True warrior... Physically and emotionally
Brilliant 👍
Paddy the baddy, my new favourite fighter 💪💯
Semper Fi   Paddy you just saved a Marines life. Thank you for your time. I’d take a bullet for you. ❤️🇺🇸
Yo paddy you where suppose to take that coin during a hand shake. He just plucked it right out like he was offering a starburst. I laughed so hard!
My man apologized to literally everyone for being “fat” haha
And not a single lunge was completed by Paddy😂. Says me to the pro athlete😂
When Patty comes to the UFC cage they're going to start calling him Patty the fatty!
I like Patty but I think he's going to have a short UFC career cuz he seems like a lazy f***! Come on Patty put some f****** effort into your f****** training!
The sneaky finger on the sit up 😂
Nothing but mad respect Paddy.
Man, this took me back lmao The PT really does slay
Gotta love Paddy man 🙌🏼 Superb content.
The craziest thing is I'm able to understand everything he says now. At first i needed an interpreter to figure out wth he was saying.
Top bloke big respect to paddy
Anyone can win👍😎...    Paddy  PS. Thanks brother 🙂 🇳🇪 ❤️ really helped me
Paddy is awesome!
Sheesh 2mil views buddy’s a influencer now getting big bread without even fighting 6 fights inna ufc sheesh big paddy
PADDY is a  LEGEND
Most natural fighter.....👍😎
Don't be fooled either all of those mfers are killers. Paddy taps them all. Levels.
Paddy is a bad man, ive been following him for a few years now and I dont think there's anyone he can't take either.  he kinda reminds me of Nate Diaz, not in fighting style but in attitude.  He's ready to fight no matter where or when or who
I'm sorry I'm so fat😝😇 paddy the man👍
Every time I see Paddy I like him more and more, I really want to go watch him fight now!
Paddy fucking up all the marines hahaha
Paddy is awesome 😎... regards from Mumbai India 🇳🇪👍   Marines are the best 👍
I'm not really into mma but paddy seems like a very nice lad, I've always said it cost nothing to be nice and paddy symbolises that keep it up paddy mate
Yes lad 💪💪
Military training is on another level compared to combat sports.
I have been in 1000's of fights over the decades. I was a Ranger, Combat Engineer, and Dragon. I am also an International High Power Weapons Champion. And more.. I can tell you this. Every Dog has his day. Even when you know someone else is better or even if you fear someone, never let them know it.  Stay out of street fights if you can. Sometimes, trouble will find you no matter what you do. Be prepared. Put god/Christ first in your life. You will get scars, you will survive, you will prosper if you put god first.
Pimp my ride vibes
Imagine if paddy keeps this level of training up he would be like 175 of pure mass dropping everyone while looking like the 5th beatle
Bro just gave them a lesson then proceeded to make them all tap in a single round🤣
Thanks for taking about mental health! God bless!
Awesome Paddy
inspirational
Very impressive
LETS GO PADDY SHOWEM.
Man if Russia had to face off with our boys they’d wipe the floor with them🇺🇸 I’m from San Diego
Damn your killing it Paddy!
Fuckin awesome man!
Fucking mint!
Professional level 10
Paddy is a good teacher
This would of been a different outcome with the Marines in Virginia lol.
@10:59 That poor Marine when you didn't shake his hand to get the coin (as youre supposed to) :D
THE FINGER AT 1:22 LMAOOOOO
If you are ever about to get in a fight in a bar, check out the dudes ears.  If his ears are all effed up, by him a beer and call it a day.
how can you not love paddy. legit he is just such a genuinely great man
This guy is just waaaaaayyy tooooo niceeeeee! even if he cussess he still sounds nice
Cool 😎 video
Paddy the softie. Bro it blows my mind he has any fight in him at all.
Marines can work out, but paddy's battle proven
He could have hurt them don’t get me wrong the Marines are tuff but you are talking about a pro fighter
Sorry I'm so fat!
Experience is all that matters… good shit paddy the baddy.
Nice!
Why he is the Baddy!
Damn we love you even more after this paddy!!!
Cool.
Paddy you are so right in what you say about mental health issues. I've been there in the dark places and only people that have been there no what to say truly. Your an inspiration to everyone with mental health issues and apart from that your a top bloke and a right hard bastard. Good on you mate.
Fucking legend, I love this guy <3
I fucking love this guy
Paddy is officially American as is gets... Keep up the good fight Paddy your a legend across the globe.
Belters the marines there seem like boss lads and hope them all the success in the world 🌎
Cool
This guy looks and behaves like he's not normal, but I'm sure he is very normal, good human being and a real sportsman. Hope I'm not wrong, he might easily become my favorite fighter if he continues like this 👌💪
I hate the Cage fighting but I love this lad
Niiiice 🤙
I'm french and normally I understand quite everything in English but when paddy talk I'm like wtf I didn't get half of what he said 🤣
Patty let me just say bro your an awesome human being.  Good fighter and great human.  Good luck to you and all that you do.  Bless up!
0:02wtf. I'm leaving already
Paddy is everything Conner should have been, down to earth honest human
Amazing videos paddy lad from liverpool 👏 funny kid you laa hahahha
Respect lad takecare two
So basically you could send 1 Paddy for every 10 marines and win, right? I feel less safe now. lol
i fookin love this guy. Been under mental health since 1986. Hes right. The lads need to open up more. . 🙌🙌👌👌🥩🥩
Marine to Paddy: Ever killed a man?
sary im so fat
I am not into UFC, dont know much about Paddy but the little i do and the little ive seen and heard him speak, I think he is an ACTUAL role model for young men across the world, unlike some people in the media and who have a following. The best thing is this young man is just seeming to crack the edges, so who knows what a positive impact he could potentially have made in just ten years. I foresee this man being knighted for his services for mental health and possibly future charity work at the very least. That just seems like that's the most probable trajectory for him.
Paddy: where is the foods?!
Dude needs to stop with this weight bullshit or he's going to have a very short life. Is it really that hard to not be a fat f+++ and not eat garbage when you're not training? Until he changes this habit he'll never be champ.
I support relief from work... with my paddy bra.
Impressive AF! 💯 Got me pumped! 😤
shout out to the marines too! those gift at the end waz mad respect
All the fighting was 3 second clips cut together, terrible
paddy the goat fr
Paddy you will fucked up by Topuria )))
Baddy is a Goody!
Paddy is a real goof.He will be knocked out cold with in 2 years an will be a distant memory of a feeling baby…By paddy…Lol…
Way to embarrass your self USMC, I mean I know he's good and all but to go 0 - 10 😣 But at least he's humble about it and not rubbing it in !!
Paddy is a lot like Keanu Reeves both good honest men who love their fellow humans, and want to  help and give something  back! Many could learn from their selfishness, and commitment to personnel  excellence! MANY!
Fatty the patty is back
I weigh about 176.8  About hey?
Just wanted to say thanks for showing my brothers some love!  USMC is one of the physically hardest branches to excel in, and those who make it through boot camp are the toughest people I've ever had the pleasure of knowing!  So from an old Marine, thank you from the bottom of my heart for showing them the love and respect!
This is an amazing video. Awesome stuff Paddy.
Paddy is a don
Wow that was such an enjoyable episode. The Marines were the coolest.
I don’t think people are giving you enough credit as a businessman. Very smart setting up a YouTube career in the same time as coming up as a fighter. In the age of Social Media, It’s good source of income to stack on top of the breaks between fights. You Izzy, and Omaley ahead of the curve, and soon I feel like fighters will follow your lead. Keep putting out positivity and pain ✊🏾
Kids the real deal, champs champ
Nice to see The baddy without the "Meatball" screaming and hanging on him Sorry kid  but true 🤷‍♂️
Semper Fi Paddy!
They put you thru hell then you put them thru hell. Love this vid haha
youre not bad. youre fighting weak boys and youre weak yourself.
"SORRY I'M SO FAT MAN" LOL
Ive always been a boxing/kickboxing fan never really grappling, but holy shit that must have been the most bad ass montage makes me want to learn.
Lovely 💯💫
Cant wait the baddy vs the lizard
He almost got me with the Q&A I had to walk it off
he had like 15-20 punds on all those guys lol still awesome
I went to high school with David, the marine leading the class. We were in the band together. He was such a goof and class clown back then lol. Glad to see he's doing great and still serving. Fellow Vet, keep it up guy. Not too many of us make it out of Jackson, MS.
paddy is honestly still in great shape
I wasn't a massive fan pad. But I am definitely now mate.  The whole next gen  crew are down to earth normal people.. love it ❤️
Paddy belongs to the mafia !
Even a female marine can't help hogging all the attention 2:44 Females are Relentless
What a fkn G
2:59 me when my boyfriend lifts me up
Love you paddy. Keep the mental health support coming. #GETITOFFYOURCHEST
Rurik Raes is that you?
Sorry I’m such a fat ass😂😂😂😂
Don't think paddy will ever have a head too big for his shoulders to carry, humility and savagness, and a true advocate for mental health, shows you don't need to be a ego driven arse whole to be one of the biggest stars in the game. Yup the boy
Lmao the way he kept apologizing cause he’s fat 😂
Paddy you're the best. Get 'em lad!
Paddy is a true American hero
Ppl can say whatever about paddy, he’s one of a kind outside and in the octagon
He didn't just beat ten Marines, he beat 10 Marine Raiders. Real killers.
those are just our good Ole marines !!! You should train  with some FLORIDA PHASE or buds ! lol, love you paddy...I'm kiddin
This was so interesting to watch.  Well done.
I love Paddy don't compare him to Conor.  That's an insult to Paddy.  MMA guys must be fun in bed
And then, there is Chimaev
Dam lol
When he has to face a top 10 fighter he will be exposed.
Baddy the Boss
this episode went hard
Paddy’s awesome so are the marines 😂 but Wait……Why we’re the marines throwing such girly punches and elbows like they’d never thrown a punch before ? I’m confused 😂
This is amazing, continue doing what you're doing and speaking about mental illness. Continue to talk to people and I hope you get to speak more to young adults and children. The world is missing something and I think you're going to be a part of something even bigger than MMA
Next Royal Marines
Hahahaha made em all tap too… sick 😂
Pappy you are awesome 😊 and thank you for the advice in your it helps and never give up 😊
Paddy is a beast!
Paddy "The Faddy" Baddy
Proper bad man.....but with the twist of having his head connected to his heart.  This type of strength is hard to beat....hence why he keeps smashing it! Good man Paddy B you're le real deal!!
Mad athlete.
The scouse kid laying it down to them wel some lad
I just wanted to thank you Paddy for being one of the few UFC fighters that isn’t afraid to speak up about mental health and true problems that exist in people’s lives. Thanks to you I have had the courage to speak with my Dad about how I am feeling instead of keeping it all trapped away until I explode or worse. Keep on being a great fighter. Much love ❤.
Paddy still in great shape lol
"PADDY' RESPECT ALWAYS BROTHER 🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷👊🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺🍺💥💥💥💥💥💥 GOD BLESS ✝️✝️✝️✝️✝️
Just realized I wasn't subbed and now I am, Your a badass paddy keep it up
He kills me
Paddy is like Superman. But instead of glasses to conceal his identity, he puts on 80 pounds
Go to an infantry unit and do this again, why the hell did they go to a comm unit lmfao
l
u sped thru all the ground fighting :(
“Sorry I’m so fat”
What a wonderful human
Jiu jitsu is  so gay ,i love it
You should do a vid with eddie hall, thatd be sick!!
Thus was awesome. Awesome. Good job Paddy. You are a true warrior. Respect high fi yuh. Yuh mad. Bless Brother. Bless.
Paddy on top... Inn time
Remember when that clown Logan Paul said he’d beat him in a fight 😂😂
I guarantee those Marines couldn't understand a word Paddy was saying
This right here shows u that marines army or navy ain't got shit on niggas like paddy. All that training to kill with weapons and your bare hands and our military is getting tapped out by a ufc fighter.  Guessing all this training our military does doesn't compare to how the ufc fighters train. Maybe our military should be trained by these marvelous ufc fighters because this right here showed how these marines ain't ready for a man like paddy anywhere. Without their guns they're all screwed in war
Next up... 101st airborne or 75th rangers  Pick one Paddy
This is like the training scene in all boxing movies
dude is cool AF, so relatable on so many levels. I hope he takes over the UFC as the next Superstar!!!!
Class video
Lovely to see the contest ☺😄 something I've done  the last 10 min of a martial art session several times  in judo, karate and  ju jutsu. I love martial art techniques and im best in Thaiboxing or kickboxing.. ive done alot of Krav Maga in private and even tried out Systema B ... lived 2 years in Portugal and became best friend with a guy from Rio with black belt in Vale Tudo... he and I trained alot during my time there... he now has his own mma school in the south of Portugal..  I don't follow any mma fighter or similar... but I assume u are one..))  but I gonna start following you now..  U was entertaining and showed respect to the others..  it's rare these days.. ^^
Lol the crayons are getting to these boys
Love the video… Next time when you are being offered a challenge coin like that, shake his hand and take it out of his hand during the handshake… That’s traditionally how you do it
Gives you a scary perspective on high level bjj artists, he’s by no means the best in the world but can still tap 10 fresh marines🤯
It's hilarious watching military guys who genuinely are tough, get destroyed by bjj guys
3:00 - “as a say sorry i’m so fat lad” hahahahahaha
Like your appreciateion to mental health problems coz thay are real. 💯👌
MONSTER!
Paddy every 5 minutes: sorry I'm a fat bastard 🤣🤣 fookin love him
Semper fi mf
What a legend
Sorry m8 wish you all the best in all you do it's easy to say that! But your living the life lad 😉n t b fare ur smashing it so just my apologies lolkeep it real.
Thare is no way the boy's was trying to tap the paddy lol
That was a surprise treat! I wonder if they rely too much on being armed? My Dad, passed at 95 in `19 and he was pretty nifty at JJ, considering he`d boogered his knees playing ruggers for Hudders & had epilepsy(for 50yrs before curing himself), from headbutting the c*ckpit crash-landing his plane during WWII. For a short time he was based where another Paddy had his Spitfire set aside and mollycoddled. He spoke well of Brendan "Paddy" Finucane. Not so well of another ace he said was foul-mouthed, haha. Flag over coffin & Forces send-off for Dad. He was as fit as a butcher`s dog even after a knee was replaced twice. For many decades, daily brisk walks, jogging, yoga and workouts and top nutrition kept his head in a better place..
Paddy, go to an infantry unit-not some POG units who don’t fight! That’s their jobs to fight not these bitches-POGS
Paddy is getting fat
Thank you paddy this stuff matters to your American fans keep it up been following you since your start keep it up
Hell yeah good job paddy  Love the USMC
lmao the guy in a Triangle at 7:10 lmao. Stalemate? no buddy your about to get chocked out.
Damn I have made respect for that guy!!!! He speaks truth and is not scared to do so! Thanks brother.
Another awesome episode, lad.
Passy the prk
Brilliant video, you can see those lads took plenty from fro that session with paddy 👍🏼👍🏼❤️
Poddy the fotty
The dude who started the the spec ops in the marines trained with the SAS who looks like Hannibal from the A team
His commentary is epic lol
Фига себе ряху отрастил.
Belter
HiPaddy! are you from Liverpool?
now you know why paddy keeps getting "fat" would be way worse rolling with these guys if he was in fighting shape because some of them look like middleweight or even light heavyweights.^^
I never knew who you were until I saw your post-fight speech, as someone who has battled with depression I thought it was highly inspiring. But now after this, you have a fan for life. Being a Marine myself many years ago a few of my buddies are no longer here because of suicide and that Q&A you did was spot on.  Thank you so much for being that badass voice that speaks to the warrior "get it off your chest"... Thank you!
Absolute lad went in there fat. Smashed it and nailed them all 😂👏 fuck yeah baddy!! Fuck yeah mate haha
What a freaking hardcore workout!!
"This is one of the hardest workouts this *week*" - Paddy  after tapping out 10 marines
I feel like the marines would've put up a better fight if they weren't wearing socks on the mat 💀
Paddy the Baddyyyyyy
i love seeing ufc and combat professionals doing military training. It's like a match in heaven
I wonder how many times those marines asked, "Wait, what did he say?" 😅 Love Paddy but he's a little hard to understand sometimes!
East coast bases never get anything cool like this that’s some bs😂😂
Paddy run tings
OMG TWINZIESSSSS  I apologize for being Fat all the time to.
“As I say, sorry I’m so fat lad” 😂😂
I just lost a friend 2 weeks ago due to poor mental health. Ever since Patty post fight speech, im no longer afraid to talk to others about mens mental health including my own. Unfortunetly my friend was in too deep when I last spoke with him. Atleast I got to tell him I loved him the last time I saw him.
Is he up to 200lbs already?
I think a big advantage paddy had on the jiu-jitsu was most of the marines had socks on, losing grip on the mat
I'm sowrie I'm so faat maan
Dude is truly a beast! such an inspiration!!! Much love from Colorado brutha!!!
good
Paddy should have gone up against a chief instructor like a 3 red stripe black belt of marine corps martial arts program
Paddy is a professional MMA fighter, but at the same time a better youtuber than a lot of creators with millions of followers imo!
Marines ain't even broke a sweat at the end. Lol
Came across this vid mate, fuckin cracking it is, nice one Paddy. Big up ya pal
Love this kid lol. Exactly what the UFC needs.
Seems like military martial art training is more focused on heavy conditioning but simple and basic technique, since they train a student in a large number so its hard to monitor each student development but they compensate it with phisicality
Hell yeah
Paddy is awesome!! Marines badass!
He no shit looked thinner by the end of this episode 🤣
Great video as always paddy, proper LEGEND.
Hell yeah paddy they gave you the real McMap experience
Well I’m officially never pulling for paddy’s opponent after this vid hopes to this guy being the champ!
7:11 'Stalemate?' errr, no
I absolutely love this lad, a proper down to earth athlete that says it how it is. Stay bad, Paddy lad 👊🏼
guy at 7:09 had no idea Paddy wasn't finishing the triangle so he could rest 😂
Paddy. You are setting an amazing example.  Keep up the great work!
Paddy is a 🦁.
paddy every five minutes " sorry I'm so fat" 😂😂😂
Believe that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, and you will be saved..Be baptized and repent of your sins. Repent simply means to turn away from your sins. God loves you and so do I.
Sorry I'm so fat.
Belter video lad
Marine9: Stalemate??  Paddy: in your dreams
Anyone else notice that dude grabbing a handfull of balls 2 seconds in to the vid?
🔥
Paddy is really growing on me as a fighter and as a person, but bloody hell if that Lad isn't hard to understand sometimes!😂
"Sorry lad I'm a fat bastard" 😆
This was cool paddy! Much respect for going and making some marines day a little less monotonous!
Wow what a work out bro sick that is that the us marines when you taking on the Royal Marines hahaha hope your well ✌️👍
Please challenge Jake Paul in a MMA fight 👍
Tearing when they presented him with the gifts 😢 cracking gesture
I now kinda like Paddy after watching this. I typically find him obnoxious and annoying but nice to see him not trying to play up to a crowd.
That is seriously impressive. Marines are skilled but Paddy is just a master.
what is the song when they start doing Jiujitsu?
Geez... UFC bloody mess and now a YouTuber
You are taking on a COM battalion.  That proves nothing beating a bunch pf POGs LOL!  Fireteam carry the girl?  If there's a girl in your battalion, you are not the real marines.  Several of my grunt marines are also in BJJ.  One just earned his black belt last month, another got his blue too.  WEAK PADDY!
damn what a goat
Real Shit
hes a good fat ass vibe you can get along fast
If you don't know. The black belt on the Marines belt represents our Matriel arts level. Him taping out 10 black belts quickly bloody impressive. Rah Rah Marines
Paddy isn’t flipping off everyone. He just keeps on telling them that they’re #1.
I love this dude no homo
USA and the uk are basically the same country now days lol 😂
ITS 8/0 AND GUESS WHAT IM NOT EVEN IMPRESS LOL , lvl diff. 10/0.
I love how when there's a celebrity, the marine corps pretends that they're not forcing masks, jabs and wokeness.
That is a lot of humility and wisdom for a young lad. I was wrong in assuming the opposite, given how energetic, jovial and outspoken you are, which is idiotic, I know, but we all have our faults. I wish you the absolute best. From a Moroccan fan. 👍👍
"Get in my belly!"
Crazy thing is when I was in boot camp the black guy that's leading the exercises was one of our mcmap instructors I just remember his voice and face dude had some slayer pts tho
I love this guy
This has inspired me to do a few jump n jaks this morning....babysteps
Crazy
The only thing missing from this channel is some damm subtitles
Mad respect Paddy !! Mens mental health should always be recognised not brushed under the rug 💯
The few the proud the tapped
Thank you Paddy. I really enjoyed watching this video. Lots of respect to you and The Marines. Totally awesome!!! 💜🙏🏾💙👊🏾
Fun watching him destroy all those marines in grappling
if paddy teaches me jiu jitsu imma quit on the firt day, i can’t understand shit
Love how they smoked him frist
Romans 3:23 states: "For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;". We are all sinners, that have committed at least one sin in our lives, which earns us an eternal punishment in Hell. Revelation states 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.". God sent his Son, Jesus, to Earth as a perfect sinless sacrifice. To take on all the sins of the world; both past, present, and future sins. Shedding his blood on the cross as a blood atonement for all sins. After dying on the cross, he rose from the dead on the 3rd day and rose to Heaven. To show life after death. To show everlasting life through Jesus's sacrifice. John 14:6 states: "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.". Romans 10:13 states "For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.".      Eternal life in heaven is just one prayer away. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died on the cross for your sins. As an atonement for your sins. And rose from the grave on the 3rd day. Ask Jesus to save you of your sins and give you eternal life in Heaven. Salvation is a free and everlasting gift from God. Please don't let pride drag you into eternal punishment in Hell, but ask Jesus to give you eternal life in Heaven. If you're getting a strong feeling of resistance while reading this, it's because Satan doesn't want you to get saved. He wants you to resist, and think it's not real. He wants you in Hell for all eternity with him. Hell is not a fun place, like worldly people like to imagine. It's everlasting torture with no relief. I'm only taking the time to text this, because I want to get the message out. There are so many distractions in life keeping people from witnessing to other people. Keeping people from thinking about salvation. Keeping you from thinking about life after death. Please, ask Jesus into your hearts to save you of your sins and cleanse you from all unrighteousness. Ask him for a place in Heaven, and he will save you from eternal damnation in Hell.
As a marine I’ll say my ego is hurt. Also the marines have never rolled without boots before.
How can you not like Paddy?  just a totally proper lad XD
These marines need to shape up their grappling. Professional warriors need to do a little better than that.
Paddy went easy on them. It is frightening how quickly BJJ can end a streetfight. He could have killed all of those marines in his sleep while eating a kebab
when the marine was carrying paddy, paddy said sorry lad im a fat bastard. Im crying in laughter rn bro
Paddy destroying them Hollywood Marines! Come on over to the east coast brother! Ooh Rah!
Paddy(owning 10 marines in a row), the new Mortal Kombat character.
mate hell of a episode ...
Thanks for coming to Pendleton bro! Supporting the troops and all! I am a fan and i have a cousin from Liverpool that i visited.
Great work PTB , top lad
No shoes on the mat ,wat is this
Great video brother and brothers
Great role model for the young lads 👏
I say unfair marines has socks on 🤣

Fantastic vlog please more of this type of content
My new favorite channel! Thanks paddy! Hit my line if you’re ever in northern Colorado! Let’s hike and grab a bite! 👻 @ethan22hoe
I love paddy sooo much and not to take away from his amazing skills but imagine how crazy being grappled by khabib is if this man can run through 10 marines straight lol
Paddy you’re the men !! I been going tru the same you described in 8:50 and you just wake yo the beast l always been thank you brotha .. l weight the same as you And I have the same muscular body type as you with the heart of a Lion there’s not many like us anymore out there seeing and listening to you is like seeing myself reflected in a mirror saludos y bendiciones desde Miami305
Well done Paddy.
I’d prefer a grenade over a ammo crate lid 💥
Legend ❤️
I’ve watched ufc for some years now but I’ve never seen a fighter as real as paddy the baddy. Obviously there are some real down to earth fighters but you don’t get better than paddy(even if he is a Liverpool fan). I’ve watched most interviews with him and molly and you always get the same energy, same realness from both of them. If I could’ve taken a leaf out of his book 10 years ago from how he inspires me/people now, I would of bitten his fucking hand off……future champ, reigning Legend!
🤮🤮🤮🤮
Too dope
Good one paddy
Paddy bagging several hundred thousand off YT videos alone
Paddy is dat dude.
Much love bruv but Francis vs you hahah dunno bout that one hahha
Awesome video paddy.
“Im sorry I’m so fat man” 😆😆😆
HOLY SHIT THIS VIDEO BLEW UP
didnt know marines are that weak
Ooorahhh!!
Oh shit my little brother is there right now for boot camp
Please do the next episode vs Russian specnaz from Dagestan.
Top man paddy fantastic effort no joke military training then to roll afterwards with ten different marines showcasing some of that amazing ground game you possess proper class act, definitely future ufc champion you mate keep up the amazing work 👍🏻 💪😉👍
awesome
Soo embarrassing for the marine corps, smh
This was so entertaining to watch😂, paddy the baddy💪
Great guy 🙂
Paddy is a guy you just want to be successful ! God bless him !
This guy is Liverpudlian Owen Hart
SPOKE TO ME MISSUS
I wonder what these matchups would've been like with Marine OKC fighting knives or rifles with those same OKC bayonets affixed?
Lol the coin. My man just grabbed the coin from his hand haha. I like it
Were those Raiders?
💪💪💪💪🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸👍👍👍👍🌶🌶🌶
The Corp is one thing, put him with the US Navy SEALS for 24 hours.  The FIRST, 24 he's., of a new Class.
fatty the body
That's incredible, just shows how high level these pro fighters are. These marines would beat 99.999% of the population to a pulp and Paddy could of just took all of their lives from them 1 by 1. That's fucking nuts
That was so satisfying to watch.
sorry lad , im a fat bastard xDDDDDD
a gladiator with the soldiers... XD
Paddy is a real one!  But they should of sent an American fighter.
him apologizing for being fat😂
“Sorry I’m so fat lad”🤣
Bro, I did that exercise when I was in. Rule was, win or lose, you’d have to grapple with every marine around you. They’d form a circle of marines around you, and you had to fight all of them. By the second marine, I would already feel like I was breathing out blood. It’s by far the most exhausting thing I’ve done. Just absolutely impressed me how he not only fought all of them, but submitted them all AFTER a long ass MCMAP workout.
As I say sorry I'm so fat lad 😂 is right paddy lid
goat
All these guys trying to roll with socks on 🤣🤣🤣
Paddy the baddy vs gay marines
This video is sick
He’s just a fucking lad!! So much respect for paddy!
Clickbait. Paddy's face in the thumbnail is way less puffier than in the video 😂 Anyway great video, awesome personality in and out the octagon
damn im a fan now
i became a fan today.
Great video bro!
Weldone Paddy! You have inspired me to get my Ar@e into gear
They should see how fat he is currently! It's actually shocking and it's REALLY bad for his health.
I swear Paddy is visibly skinnier by the end
I'm a Scotsman. While in Arkansas I got interviewed by a local news crew. I was careful to speak slowly and clearly and they still didn't have a clue what I'd said. Was there a translator present for the Marines?
Vote paddy for middle weight
Bro people talkin about Paddy’s weight like he fell off, but look at this dude… he’s an absolute beast.
HHHHHmjHHHHH.
Why are they all in their socks haha! No grip at all 🤣
Highly enjoyable watch
I can't believe that Paddy has become such a truly unique MMA/UFC fighter. This whole thing was just extraordinary.... especially him giving our Marines these invaluable BJJ lessons. Broadly speaking, due to their harsh training, the USMC folks are a breed above others; but these specific martial arts skills Paddy's showing them will upgrade their one-on-one fighting ability quite a bit.
On mma grapling paddy is not that much look strong .... But infront of marine he is like a Boss taping out every one ease ...
Belter video lads!! Thanks you all for your service 🇬🇧
lol Paddy you legend
Love it  I am so sorry I am so fat lad 🤣🤣
SUBBED
Paddy is quickly becoming one of my fave fighters from this generation.
Whattttt………….. I didn’t even know paddy had a channel, what a fucking legend going a doing a vid with American soldiers.   Wicked idea.
What happened to his face?
God that’s disgusting, crawling around that filthy ass mat and rolling around with sweaty dudes for hours?
Easily one of the best videos I’ve watched all year, love this type of content paddy keep it coming, sick entertainment 🤞🏾
My new favorite fighter.
That was inspiring. I am sure you just shocked many people. 👍👍
They loved you for this Paddy. Awesome.
Omg just when I thought I couldn’t love paddy anymore he does this  TOP TOP RESPECT PADDY x
That’s freaking awesome
I rolled laughing at every apology for being "a fat bastard"!  LMFAO! Amazing video!
Paddy looks like the guy I want to protect in the street, just in case he got bullied by some street girls.
That dude is like an anaconda. Once he gets attached the squeezing begins.
You can see how much the marines admire and respect you, you are truly an inspiration. Much love from California.
Gaunyersel Paddy.
Imagine having a couple pints with this kid 😂🤣😂👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼  Big Respect from Ireland 🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪🇮🇪
Tapping ten marines is madness that's no easy feat. They wouldn't want to tap
King paddy the scouser showing dem hosers how its done ya
Lol first intro, he beeps out the f-bomb and then says the c-bomb. I love him !!
Song name that starts at 2:20 anyone?
Cringe !!!
Funny af
He's such a cool fuckin dude. His weight increase is just nuts
Great video Paddy ...badass! Hoorahh
I wonder if there were times when they couldn't understand his lovely Scouse accent.
Rolled every one of them lad haha
Very impressed  That must been hard to do
Anyone know the song at 6:00 ?
Paddy you are the realest one in the room. Just your attitude alone. You taught me something in this video and I thank you for that. Awesome stuff. Keep pushing brother. As will I
Does Marine training before and still beaten all of them. This man is fire!
I have to say sorry, Im so fat. killed me off 😂😂😂😂😂
“Sorry I’m fat lad” loved that haha
What an absolute wholesome video, I was laughing and smiling all the way through. Paddy seems like a really great lad, thumbs up
7:20 song name ?
True life champion Paddy
Paddy you’re brilliant lad, love ya
Paddy the baddy the drill Sargent 🫡  G.O.A.T  so inspirational with everything you do you have inspired me to start kickboxing
That's a champion right there. Plain as daylight.

Boss. Go ed.
This, guy will be one of the best coaches ever.
Am bigger fan 🤣🤣🤣👏he comedian
Crazyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
2 mill views in a day I bet this channel earns him more than the ufc does
padddy your editors need to add bloopers to the end of your video to get people to watch till the end for algorithm. They're like 4 years behind in editing and my opinion is VALID..
paddy you are such a legend mate
Trained to fight and trained to kill 2 different stories
Solid vid 👍🏼
go paddy!!! power on ppl....talk, walk, share, no shame in depression and anxiety, its a hard world for some. be kind to everyone & have humility and gratitude!
Nice one nothing but mutual respect 👊👍
Wow that's next level training
This fella downs marines faster than his chicken wings! Proper warrior
Thanks for the video! More videos soon, these are super entertaining.
For me he's Paddy the Angel❤️❤️
Paddy seems to be such a nice humble guy. Definitely my fav fighter right now. Greetings from Erfurt/Germany
Your on the end of my leg....... you f'ing legend.......
Marines should have taken off their socks for BJJ.
Those gifts were badass.
There’s absolutely nothing not to love with this guy!
He looks like a different person to who I’ve seen in the UFC. If you told me it was his fat older brother I’d believe it!
Likeability Paddy: 11/10. McGregor? -1/10. Real champions are humble.
What a very nice personality. Good to see someone real.
"Don't youz have a kebab shallenge? am staav'n"
"Sorry lad I'm a fat bastard" 😅  Gotta love paddy..
Paddy has a great attitude.  Winning.
Marine Raiders, some bad ass dudes!
Awesome. An authentic and real speaking person in beeped out America. 😀
Paddy kicked all their asses!
Paddy is the best but if he wants that real work, next time leave the cameras at the gate.
Paddy your the boyo mush
1 Vs 10 "marines" , Now I understand why they never win a war.... 😆   Just kidding, don't cry
Paddy the baddy what a guy
Man, I wasn’t so sure about this goof ball when he first came into the UFC but the more I see from him the more I can tell he is a man of high moral fiber, I’m becoming a big fan more and more.
Damn bro they had him hitting shields and elbowing heavy bags. Then carrying humans. A lot of carrying humans.
Paddy is who Connor should’ve tried harder to be.
Levels
This is so entertaining mate! ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
really great content, paddy has many talents
kids haircut
Hollywood Marines.
I would love to do that, seeing these guys pish each other is amazing. Working out myself is so hard to stick to especially the way my head is. Respect to paddy and the US Marines and all the allied armed forces across the world.
“Sorry im a fat bastard” killed me 😂😂
Thanks for showing the Marines some love. Rahh
Ace episode 👌 👏 🙌
There's no way I work in the shop across the lot and didn't get to meet this man lmfao. This is wild.
Sorry Lad, im a fat Bastard 🤣🤣
U got my full respect and those marines got your back for life brother.
Paddy is so likable person
What is that song name?  Thank's for the help.
I mean ya he's 200lb but he looks in good shape. His face is kinda big but other then that he looks good
Buzz that looked fun
Great jiu-jitsu display - OSS
Quality video
Fatty Riblett
And Jake Paul thinks he can beat the him. Just him being an advocate for mental health for men is enough to beat that joke of a man.
Good video, nice and entertaining but not too much acting where its cliche. Good one paddy.
thank u paddy for letting me know to appreciate life u made me smile again.
I'm sorry I'm fat 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 😂😂😂😂😂😂
LHW Paddy choking middleweight killers :D :D
I'm a big fan of Paddy and new to San Diego! Been here 3 months and getting into a wrestling gym tomorrow....Go Paddy the Baddy!
Believe me...this "Polly Plimblet" will make Khamzat tap for the 1st time in round 1...
Thats so cool
Why on God's green earth do they have there socks on
Sorry lad, I am a fat bastard 😂😂😂😂
i know the higher ups were buggin about him having his shirt off half the time 😂 and there were female Marines around 😂
This was incredible. Well done Paddy and Marines
I can't wait for you to enter the top 5
Why tap , go sleep 😂 great job paddy 🔥🔥🔥🔥
Paddy the mother fuckin baddy. You the man. It's awesome to see such a badass speak out for mens' mental health. We're in this shit together man.
This videos is sick man😂😂🤝🤝
I'm speechless. You are such a force for good Paddy, thank you for the message you put out.
Not impressed
Inspirational again 🙏🏽
What a great dude. As a former Marine, this man is great and he indirectly helped so many Marines and raised their moral so much. What a good person, and inspirational fighter. Fucking love you paddy! Keep inspiring and motivating!
6:51 this guy was pretty good!
Geezer submitted 10 marines one after the other
Big legend, maximum inspiration, a true warrior.
#beautysecretsalishah
Great vid
bro you are fkn awesome lad, much love from nz. I want more content, could watch your videos all day
Paddy the Fatty
What a guy
Still the realest brother.   So much time for this man.   As a fighter my favorite thing is that the uneducated fan thinks he's a striker and that taking him down is the way to go but I guarantee that 99.9% fighters who try and grapple Paddy will get tapped out.   Man's an animal and future champion in my eyes.     Will he make mistakes? Yeah cos he's human, show me someone who has never made a mistake and I'll show you a liar.     But the best thing about him is what you see is what you get.    I've had the pleasure of speaking with him and having him on channel twice.   I cannot speak highly enough of him as a person.   Genuine and real. Doesn't forget where he's from and who he is.   Real talent, the real deal - Real Talk 💯 Big love for my scouse brethern PTBP ☝️
Paddy really the one who gunna take over the ufc now this man really is inspiring
mcmap is a joke
Paddy ain’t even fat..I’m fat☹️
Cut that freaking hair off! 🙄
when you apologise for being fat is the most funny shit ever!
Sorry I’m so fat 🤣man Paddy had me dying
Hey mate stay there they will turn you into a monster 👹
This video just shows you, marines are bad dudes, but paddy could fuck all of them up easily hahaha nothing compares to a professional mma fighter
W Vid
Yeah he’s the fucken man!
Checkout Ismail Perez paddy, my man❇
Paddy thank you for spending time with the Marines they are the worlds greatest fighting force SEMPER FI
I died laughing when the dude was completely wrapped up on bottom and said "stalemate?" nah bud you're getting worked
This has to be an ad. Straight up propaganda.
Stalemate? Reset? No hespect
Paddy go work with Mayweather and get a defensive upgrade against strikers
What’s the second song?
Paddy is Funny AF. Awesome video! Thank you for sharing.
Paddy God damn you're a beast, wish I could of had a chance to be there
Girls: I'm big-boned! Paddy: Sorry, lad. I'm a fat bastard!
Paddy always brings good vibes ,have jolly attitude and badass adorable 💕
I'm sorry I'm so fat lol
if only I could understand Scottish
Keep it playful!
Fun fact a 2 stripe white could also tap out 10 Marines. True story
SemPER CRY
Videos like this make me miss the Corps... So many good memories... And so much growth in maturity in such a short period of time...
Paddy 😍🤩
Had no familiarity with paddy until this video seems like a cool down to earth guy
Respect Paddy, you said it, that its not a true mate if they don't care about you! Real friends, mates tell you the truth and they don't blow smoke up your ass, or arse!
Shoutout to SSGT Cox, the guy who gave you the black shirt. Man was one of my instructors earlier this year for MAI course
I've been struggling with mental issues since I was about 10, I'm 23 now and I'm only just figuring out myself and how to believe in myself. It was a big booster for me coming from Paddy as you're only 3 years older than me, but you've done so much with your life already and even just how this video will reach people like me, aspiring to be the best but are still struggling with themselves, motivates me to be better to motivate others to be better. you're a mad lad Paddy and I hope you don't stop, seeing your journey is motivating me to stop feeling so sorry for myself and nut up, get my shit together, so thank you; I hope to meet you someday
I love how Paddy gives back a friendly tap to almost every opponent after they are submitted. Sign of respect
Putting that work in
“Sorry I’m a fat cunt” words to live by
Bruh, some people don’t realize that SHOULDER PRESSURE will make your jaw go crackle and pop. The last tap was just shoulder pressure on the neck. 😬🫣
Just when you don't think you can't like this anymore than you already do he takes it to the next level. All the best for you paddy
Never seen anyone do something like this
"Like a Marine, When U get ready, They been Ready!!! The GREAT RESET .. ..2022!!!"
Paddy the baddy "the best there is and the best there ever will be" right on
fucking 10 times continue just 10 times smooth! goddamn it paddy is good,i really thinking in starting training thanks to this men
Damn being able to say he fought 10 marines in one session and made them all tap, that’s a story to tell
I feel like yeah u should keep it real, but to your only real homies And more important then that is learn how to control your emotions and use them however u want
Fantastic
That was great to watch.
I came here to hear paddy call one of them govna
Beast!
What a king man you're a legend 💜🔥💪🏻
Paddy's popular now but give it a few more fights and he's going to be a huge star similar to Diaz and McGregor
Class video! So when are you going to do the same with the Bootnecks (Royal Marine Commandos)?
Ok I love Paddy I was on the fence for a little while but after this clip so he’s the man💪🏻👊🏼
Paddy what an amazing message mate it is Greta to see a person in this discipline to be so open about their feelings
Great video. I’m an even bigger fan now
That plaque isn’t worth 2¢ to anyone on earth but Paddy but to Paddy it’s worth twice it’s weight in gold
What a nice guy Paddy is
The mental health spoke volumes. Well done
I don't like English guys. Boring!
7:33 the fact that he can tap 10 fresh opponents is so impressive. Shows you how much training vs strength can do for you. Keep training everyone!
Damn, that's not easy to go undefeated in a grappling session against that many Marines. Looks like you beat an instructor too. Nice work!
I love how well rounded he continues to become and never acts like he is too good for anything. Paddy is awesome!!
Damn Paddy! That was one Hell of a shark tank. Grappling with one after another like that. Huge respect for this guy. HUGE!
I loved this.
The VoN flue was sneaky
Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem
Again sorry for bein so fat lad 😂😂😂 fuckin love it
9:50 the brett hart of mma?
God love you Paddy, you make the world a better place wherever you go.
Nunca  más dudaré que un luchador de ufc podría matarme si quisiera
Never heard someone speak cursive b4
Paddy come do this with the Coast Guard!
Subtítulos en español please!!
Glad that Camp a Pendleton’s finest gave you a proper workout!  Semper Fidelis!
Bas Rutten: I knocked out 3 Marines.  Paddy: Hold my stick of butter, mate.
He's fat!! haha...love the guy
still amazes me how he loses the weight.. wonder why he doesn’t just fight heavyweight? Be a big cat
Absolutely love this guy
Such an awesome dude, keep it up mate!!
You’re just a plain STAR, mate. Good luck!
That's nice just for people to understand what is a highlevel fighter. Those guys scraping with him are marines, they can't finish a tired Paddy, not even in 10 rounds, not even with him already tired of other training days. Yet, the internet is full of fat asses with zero training and a diet of beer and white bread who think they can beat a pro fighter. Insane cool video, leeees gooo lad!
Cool dude.
“Stalemate” I think paddy was just taking a break lol
This just shows you UFC fighters are lethal weapons
Sorry I’m so fat lad… “ no you’re good “
good lad
Epic King Bless you n your #KeepKillinEm
Good job Patty the daddy to those men respect and thank you for teaching them I wish that you could teach me the way that you do exactly what you do the same Gracie's
“Sorry lad, I’m a fat bastard” 😂😂😂 This man really out here making my day one moment at a time
7:20 LOL
2.2 seconds in I was amazed
Your a good man Paddy , thankyou .
Yoooo didn't know you vlog on YT! Mad respect for your mental health advocacy, so hell yeah am now subscribed!
A lot of comments saying they're surprised the marines were tapped so easily considering their wrestling and jiu jitsu training on base. Even if they had trained to blue belt level (possible, not likely), the difference between a blue belt and a black belt is massive. I would have been surprised if a single one of them tapped Paddy.
Imagine if paddy does this with the sas that will be a banger video amazing video keep up the amazing work paddy bro 💪🏻💪🏻
Great vid, but you gotta talk Dana into letting you wear the Sakuraba trunks for a fight. That'd be legendary
PADDYS DROPPING 1.6MILLION VIEWS IN A DAY?! LETS GOOOO LAD
Absolute positive
Noice!!
Patty seems like he would be such a great mentor he seems so patient
Idk why, at first I don't like this guy. As I am watching this, he's quite likeable personality.
Paddy is that guy him being an advocate for mental health, his personality, his motivation 🔥
Amazing 🙏❤️💯👍
Is paddy green, or orange.
Damn man, you're a beast!
This got me to subscribe, honor. Integrity, respect go a long way.
Paddy just tapped out a gang of marines.  As a marine veteran,  I say they got alot of work to do. Still good training though. Oooorah!
Damn marines tapping from a recent that's not even locked in! 🤣😂
Gunnery Sergeant Fleming was my drill hat, man is a menace with his campaign cover on.
Thanks for spending time with the marines semper fi
Paddy doing king of the ring from the old smack down games 😭  He’s was the most fucked after that work out. But he did say he’ll he fine when he’s grappling 😭😭guys a beast
That looked Fucking tough
when Paddy preached after the fight about his mate it hit home for me. he’s made me question everything about myself, my mind set, what i want in life and he inspired me to sober up and join a fighting club. now training upwards of 5 times a week and weight training 6 days. can’t thank you enough man 🙏🙏🙏
you can't be doing bjj in socks man lol
Cringe
They need to train where paddy trains at if he just ran through them like that
xtra thicc
What a good guy
Thanks Paddy, keep trialling different military units showcasing your and their commitment and skills. Keep it off your chest!
watching him as im eating fast food is just hilarious to me 😂😂😂😂😂
what a class video 'sorry lad im a fat bastard"
Paddy if you come to Pittsburgh can we get high together
Paddy is a true man’s man.   Adapts, improvises and overcomes. Honest, heartfelt, genuine and a dedicated warrior. And cries.
Good stuff man I'm glad I ran into this. Thanks for being real about real shit. I'll be watching more. Cheers 🍻
The more I see of you the more I like you. And the way you talk about mental health... HUGE thumbs up Paddy.
This video was beautiful, I just wanted to let anyone confused by the end that they said "oorah" which is the USMC's battle cry
Hey paddy, idk if you’ll see this but you’re AWSOME!!!
The part where paddy is getting lifted by the marine got me “sorry lad I’m a fat bastard” 🤣🤣🤣
Whoever calls paddy fat try roll with 10 marines and make them all tap!
I can’t believe they allow women marines
Por q se puso tan gordo???
My father is a Marine Vet who served in Vietnam. I had him watch the video and he now is a fan of yours.
Congrats for your badge.
so, marines  are fit, but marines cant fight lol
Live it up Paddy! Happy for you brother keep fighting the good fight
2:20 paddy ate that shit haha
A KILLER A BEAST A GIGACHAD
yo cashap
Cool video. Awesome watching him destroy the marines lol.
Champs stay in shape
11:11 Paddy take extra precaution after touching that wood with your bare hands. That's called P Treated Wood. I wouldn't eat with your hands for a day or so after touching that boxend
Paddy, you're the real Baddy. Great guy and very important what you stand for. I read all the comments and I think pretty much everything was said already, but thank you for breaking the stereotypes and standing upright for us! 💪🏼
Man. I needed this. Paddy, you are awesome. Those are some of the baddest cats on the planet and you more than earned their respect. I appreciate the mental health piece as no matter how tough one is, there can and will be things that will humble us. Glad I stumbled on this today.
Looks like Ghaye sehx with clothes
So we gone ignore the fact that paddy got a eating disorder
Never been soo hyped while watching  jujitsu, you're a fucking beast bruv
Paddy you do the scousers proud lad your a machine
Made me a sub!
They should have pranked him UFC signed papers for him to stay and train every day all month
Didnt understand a thing he said but he's cool AF.
Fucking awesome content paddy wow love this guy
Good content
I appreciate this. Thank you
Paddy telling men to "get it off their chest" and essentially be vulnerable is major.
brilliant video great editing and just an overall 10/10
I love you Paddy!! Keep breaking the stereotype of men having to bury our feelings.. it’s tough as a man too
Great montage video of Paddy kicking some ass! The next round I want to see him go after the Navy Seals! If they get beat we need to reevaluate the upper management. We'll start with Biden first and work down.
Don't talk to people that don't care about you.  Amen brother
Am I the only one who finds it a tad bit ironic that he says he wants to be "the best there is, the best there was and the best there ever will be" and he looks like a young Owen Hart????
Paddy you got the M16 right.
People not realizing he tapped out a bunch of Cpls and Cpts. Shows the gap
Sick
Rolled with and tapped out 10 marines and talked about them about waking up crying most days and being depressed. I love Paddy the Baddy.
how do you not love paddy? the kid's a belter!
Awesome. Great video
How do you keep your cardio and strength isn't it harder to train with your body bow does it effect you if I was your oppenent I would just quit after bc you beat them after being fat
Loved that whole episode. Paddy the Baddy is one of my all time favorites.
He looks like he lost weight just from the start to the end of the video
Paddy understands and feels for the common man. Seems like he's able  to see through all the bullshit. 1.4 million views... UFC needs to consider these numbers lads !!
No offense intended,  I struggle to understand the accent,  but I understand the message. You seem like a good dude
Big up from Scotland Paddy
God I love paddy. Mental health and always showing fans the love it’s the best!!
"As I say sorry am so fat la" killed me off 😂
Paeee piblettttt I cre copetishion
GREAT TRAINING FOR OUR TROOPS..  Paddy.. you could get rich helping the elite soldiers.  ps.. the Irish aren't fat.. were just... a bit...higher on gravities pull.
nice guy everything is great but put some subtitles and stuff and make ur vids longer like when ure showing grappling to them make that longer so people can learn maybe or like maybe grappling sessions longer make ur editor put some instructions in so we can all learn at home :) ure a nice genuine guy
Class lad L9
How kind can a person be? Paddy is the literal definition of a great guy
mad respect Paddy - lots of folks struggling - you rock
dying laughing at dude stuck in a mounted triangle saying "stalemate?" LMAO bruh if he grabs your arm and extends hell take it home as a souvenir
Man what a great video, paddy is and always will be a master of his technique. You are a savage bro. Transitioning from that to talking about mental health your a amazing person and I myself wanna thank you for being a good advocate on mental health. 💪Much love bro
No hate but go against a spec ops soldier I would pay for that😀
Amazing video❤️💪🤙
"Hez Hez Hez"
I feel so safe now
I loved this
That Jake Paul guy wouldn't stand a chance against Paddy
"sorry im so fat man" lmao
that was bad ass
I loved the video I think it was awesome 👌
Where's Paddy's combat boots and uniform?
Khamzat vs Paddy 2024 for welterweight title lol
Paddy being so open and honest probably makes him a better fighter, he doesn't go into fights worrying about other shit, lads probably one of the best mens mental health advocates
Paddy front line WW3
Dude I would be dead just after the initial workout!
Awesome video cool to see you chill and train with some marines, as a marine vet that was cool to see. Rooting for you from here on out Your a bad dude Paddy!
Awesome! never knew Lewis Capaldi could roll like that man
i still havent seen paddy fight but his personality is wat got me here. such a cool guy
The Navy boys wouldn’t mind getting a rear naked choke from Paddy
First vlog of yours, seen you in the ring and i get it the adreneline and the act. Serious respect for this! Reading other comments, didn't know about the mental stuff, but damn.. Talking about it in front of marines and being so open about it, just simply respect!
Marines rolling with socks on, big disadvantage.
The irony of Paddy asking someone else what they weigh
Marine: stalemate. . . reset ? Paddy: Naw bruh I’m just catching my breath before I sub you
My toxic trait is thinking I could keep up with these fellas a chubby short fella
Awesome man!  Thanks for going out and training with the boys! I wish we had a UFC fighter come whoop our asses and teach us some shit.  But good talk as well, those boys are still in the mission, and their mind is focused elsewhere. But after they get out they'll remember that talk every time they are feeling like they lost their purpose and don't to continue.  You probably saved one of those marines from themselves in the future. Thank you!
What’s paddy fight at?  He looks like 180
Holy fuck. This guy is a leightweight! Imagine DC coming in there😂😂
Damn bro is big as hell.  Paddy do the crucible
Don’t know who he is but he looks like a cool dude and humble, obviously skilled max
What they said... haha... Paddy you won my heart... haha...
Semper Fi. This was awesome.
what other fighter takes his time out to chill with our troops and paddy ain't even american
You’re the man paddy. Keep being real.
You slowly growing respect from even haters like me. I wasn't a fan of you but definitely respect you and and love what you've been promoting lately im becoming a fan
Sorry lad, i'm a fat bastard
Fav video yet!
sick lad, i love your energy
Any other jiu jitsu guys spotting mr “baddy’s” jiu jitsu mistakes?
Marine number 9 seemed to have a little bit of bjj under his belt.
10/0 after all that training amazing
Probably one of the better videos I’ve watched on YouTube. I respect up for seeing what they go through and see how much it takes to be a marine.
Still though, he refuses to eat onions even in an onion ring, so I'm pretty sure I can take him.
Love to see him vs khabib
What a guy hope he takes over the ufc !
Paddy sorry I’m a fatty
Paddy should open his own gym after he hangs them up. Dude would be such a dope coach. Similar to Kabeeb
No 5 mile Moto Run after training? 🤮
I love listening to Paddy talk
Belter remember paddy in school i was a few years older I didn't no him he didn't no me but I remember him was only a small kid he is proof you can achieve anything believe he's right uno.
Quality video 👌
This is so awesome to watch
Why do they always help the bad guys?
Shoulder pressure is rough
‘As I say sorry am so fat lad’ 🤣🤣
Clearly fake and edited, they dont show him do any complete repŝ
Paddy vs Darren till 🤷‍♂️🤞
This dudes body guna give out bad one day the way he be blowN up between fights
ooooooohhhhhhhhh padddy the badddddy
My dude just killed a whole damn platoon!
When I was younger I used to think a Marine or a person in the armed forces could beat an mma person, but soon after seems thats not the case, and Paddy usign basic skills just confirms the reality between military and professional fighter
Good dude
One Scouser has just done more for that group of marines than the military or government could ever give ! Already a champ before his time !
padddy the fattttty
Top man 👊
Taps ten marines then opens up about struggles and dark times and shares great advice. You have a powerful mindset Paddy.  You have a new fan and sub. Keep doing you mate. Its inspiring to see a warrior openly express himself. Thanks mate
Paddy, great video. God Bless you sir.
gained a fan today
Love the fact paddy apologizing for being fat bastard 😂 what a legend
10:48 😬 lmao.
Not one would nap vs tap. “Tough marines” 🥴
I am from Spain and I am very proud of my English, I am a C1 certificated and I use it regurlarly and fluently.  After listening to Paddy, I think my level is A1.....Do English people understand everything this lad say?
Confession is a real thing. Thank you sir's for your service.
I had a mate that said he took on 10 marines down the pub and won….. maybe he weren’t lying 👀
They all were red tabs 👀
100% Paddy. I feel like a lot of people that are down on themselves are in the dark because they can't see the light..even though the light is just around the corner!
When Paddys puffy he kinda resembles FB in austin powers movies. 🤘🏼💪🏼
I would not want to mess with you at 210. I'm a former marine and I don't want my marines being green when it comes to hand to hand on the battlefield. We need the best training them and you're up there. God bless the USA.
Somehow its cute to see him being chubby... *Paddy the Fatty * 😂
Absolute badass.  That message he gave to those Marines will stick with them for the rest of their lives.  And they'll pass it on to the people they care about.  And lives will be saved.
NEW FAN AND SUBSCRIBER AFTER THIS ONE.....RESPECT PADDY NOT FATTY
Love it
3.3 throwing up 🤮 them horns!  ANOTHER satanist/ Freemason puppet
Paddy the fatty.
love it!
Why do people not love this guy?
You’re a good man paddy ! Keep up the great work !
He’s started some amazing movement! Honestly he’s shear class
So badass!
Your work ethics are outstanding .. good job
We need more people like Paddy, Great Video!
Respect
So awesome! good on you PTB!
Such a massive inspiration, absolutely loved the talk from Paddy at the end huge respect man👊🏼
Lovely that Paddy is speaking out about mental health issues in the way he does. Great bloke.
Big love for Paddy!
Paddy the Fatty lol.  Just kidding, he deserves to relax and be healthy for a minute.  Good on him mate.
How in the hell I was not subscribed lad now I am
Legendary
Awesome video. I must admit I expected him to be 'flash' and show off, but I was wrong. Such respect from all and Paddy is an extraordinary fighter.
This guy is an all round top bloke. 1 scouser vs 10 marines aswell😂😂 legend already
The best dude
paddy i fkn love you bro lmao. shout out to the baddy marines
Loved that lad. No shame in talking about mental health, you're helping so many ppl lad  fuckin love you x
Lol iv not had a proper work out in years I would die lol to much bad food alcohol weed and other bad things 😂 I like boxing tho
Showing them how it’s done🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿👊🏼
Video did numbers aye
I'm not huge into MMA and don't really know the guy...just popped up on my suggested videos for some reason, but was really interesting to see the mutual respect. He fit right in and didn't go easy and neither did they and everyone gave 100% with whatever thrown at them. Ok, I know it's marines and an MMA fighter, but you seriously get egos and this just seemed like respect. Even when he was teaching them about holds and giving tips it was all taken very seriously and each relished the challenge on both sides. Was a good watch :)
Patty the fatty
Official paddy channel, gotta subscribe lad
Lol Paddy has more killer instinct then 10 marines 😂
“I’m sorry I’m fat lad” 😂
Oh shit. . . I thought this was like a meme video with his head on somebody else's body lol.   Wispect G
Great video Paddy seems real down to earth. That was a hell of a workout.
Loving these! Wholesome video
I love how paddy keeps apologizing for being fat. Lololol 😆
Love that Paddy loves SD it really is the best city to hang out in imo
😃😃😃😃😃!         Five Smiles!
Fuckin Love You Man. Im Ex Royal Engineers.
When are the marines ever going to use that tho lmaooo they sit ten football fields away and shoot in the direction of fire…
Definitely the coolest dude from the UK
Love ya Paddy ❤️
Never stop talking about mental health Paddy!  People like you give me hope for the future
Proper humble scouser 💪🏻 "Sorry am fat lad"
What an absolute diamond of a guy 🤜🤛
"Sorry I'm so fat lad.." "Nah ur good"
Mega content. Paddy is the king
Amazing
Legend at such a young age, Remarkable.
I love this Dude
Great advice from this dude! Paddy 👊🏾
Come endless wins and fame we want you to stay the same always. Big respect and love from Nagaland, India.
Name of the song during the jiu jutsu session?
I'd love to see David Goggins train you when you need to make weight
Touching video
Next paddy takes on the all you can eat buffet lol
What was that last choke Paddy pulled off???
1.3 million views in a day, paddy’s officially made it as a personality
Paddy the Baddy is the Laddy! Love watching this guy wether it's in the ring, interviews or on his channel. Real guy with a real message, keep it up!
"Sorry I'm so fat, lad"   Legend.
The minute the heat was cranked.. Little chubby paddy minced the lot of them... There's levels to combat 💪
So basically what I learned from this video is paddy can solo trios our marines
🙏
Bro really said stalemate while locked up in Paddy's triangle lol
Paddy the Nasty
I'd like to see Paddy go there and train with them everyday for his next fight camp 3 months straight... He did really well for doing a bunch of movements he wasn't used to super impressed by how strong he was throughout the day!
Serious raw advice, respect from the marines
This was some GREAT CONTENT!!!! Thanks Paddy.
5:39 😎🤙🏻
If I hurt myself it’s on you mate💀
Go on paddy that was a fin workout lad flying bro
Did paddy got tired fast then marine’s?
Awesome chilling with the Marines, as a vet myself who used to train some in the martial arts gym on my base that would have been so awesome having a mma fighter come chill and talk to us
Evan 10 US marines can’t fuck with 1 scouse warrior
“I’m sorry I’m a fat bastard”. I love this guy!
Good sport... all off you. Fun to watch
Rangers and Marines are the fuckign beasts of the US forces. similar in almost every way except there are chicks in the Marines
I love how the marines are legitimate super humans
Dude you are helping the lizards
Hell ya man badass!! Go Marines !! Go Paddy !!
Love you paddy! Came here watching vlogs because he is hilarious and i love his accent but he has turned into an inspiration for me. He is one of the real ones🤙🏽
Awesome!!!!
STILL UNDEFEATED! NEVER LOST A MATCH NEVER LOST A ROUND! PADDY BLESS! 10-0 VS THE MARINES!!!
dude stop eating at McDonalds bro who the hell is pumping cholesterol into Paddy guy looks like Jon Jones now.
Awesome video!
And thats ...why they call him THE BADDY!
I was supposed to be there last week for work. You're telling me I had a chance to meet the baddy? Fip
JooJitsoo when I am allowed to stick a thumb in your eye?
Great channel paddy
8th of trending keep it up paddy doing us scousers proud, love from aintree brother💙
“Sorry lad I’m a fat bastard” had me dying 😂
Oh man what i would have given to be able to be present for something like this while i was in! Awesome video, keep it up Paddy! Oorah!
Paddy make sure they are all liverpool supporters  when you finish  , fantastic 👏 paddy pimblett
That’s crazy paddy iced all of em. And he’s kinda out of shape compared to what he was.
and these are our marines? oooopah. yo we need to stop recruiting and start training.
Respect.❤️🤔😜🇪🇦
Marine number 10 must have thought he was in with a chance, lol
Absolutely belter video
https://youtu.be/LjtqPFdMVVo. 🤦🏿‍♂️
I know as a Marine Vet ,that this is really special for them   Thx Paddy
I’m watching this video thinking why am I not already subscribed to this channel.
Not only putting the time in, putting the work in.  Getting to know some, really interact and share with a foreign military service.  This guy is outstanding character and has been through some stuff, but stronger for it, the strength isn't being an awesome fighter, it is his meekness in fighting where appropriate and standing up to enemies within and in natural world.
This is the best video u made lad, i enjoyed every minute of it.
Thank you, Paddy! I wasn’t there but thank you for doing this. Respectfully,  Mike
Awesome vid paddy
Awesome. Absolutely awesome.
Only just discovered Paddy, he popped up in my recommended, so glad YouTube got it right. Quality bloke, loved this video for loads of reasons, I've subbed cheers Paddy lad
'This was ONE of my hardest workouts this WEEK' hahahhahaha he submitted 10 of them hahah
Patty is so awesome! Such a stark difference than that other pos new guy that ducked Diaz.
Legend!
Belter of an episode
That seamed a lot of fun, good work
SICK gift honestly!
Sorry.. I'm so fat LAD!!!! lolololol Good stuff Paddy, seem like a very cool dude.
I seen one of the drill instructors from bootcamp in there😂
Me n my buddy went to the beach one day looking for people to box....knocked 2 marines out sparing
S.E.A.L.'S GOT NEXT, BADDY!!!!!
Also for those that don’t know the black shirts are the Instructors and he kinda handle them with some ease.
Nice..!
Watching you’re videos paddy, I don’t think u realise what u do for a lot of us, this video made me chuckle!  Ure inspiring! I’m having a dark time at, but taking steps to be be better x
Awesome.
„stalemate? reset?“ yea u wish bro ☠️😂
As a Veteran Marine and former Martial Arts Instructor it’s so great to see this! I’m sure the Marines there loved this experience and something they’ll never forget and I’m sure the same goes for Paddy. This was just awesome content and I’m glad Paddy got to get a good Marine Corps workout before grappling.
This guy is great for MMA. It's even better that he's genuine and not acting. Same reason the Diaz bros are beloved, should be a lesson to other fighters to just be themselves!
A top top man! Funny as fuck. Shame about the club he supports though. Other then that hes, a legend.
What a great entertainer
England and America. Friends in peace. Allies in war.
What a dude. Confident, badass but not an asshole.
Your not fat, don’t be so hard on yourself dude. Your a beast
So much respect for Paddy in and out the ring, you really have found that perfect balance!
Dude I fucking love paddy
That shit was fire 🔥
Respect
As I said sorry I'm so fat that was the funniest line lol
I took a shot for every middle finguuur....naughe im sssssloeshed
Nice
Yess paddy represents the youts
"I have the balance of a ballerina and the weight of a sumo wrestler." Paddy is winning me over. That was a a crazy performance.Tapping 10 marines is wild. Even if their grappling is basic, their conditioning is top notch.
Top dude! Big fan
10 and 0 against Marines after a workout is amazing
Big up Paddy your the man x
Paddy you are crazy men goo 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
yeah thats a fair fight, take on a MMC champion in your weight class and lest see how you do bro
I like this kid even More now!!!! Paddy!!!
Gotta respect it !
5:05 had me howling
Paddy don't miss. Content 🔥
This was dope as hell. Thanks for your service boys and girls. And thanks for mixing up their workouts paddy
Fuckin awesome video
Be careful you end up being Paddy the Goody
He didn't realize he was supposed to  accept the medallion in a handshake.
respect to the marines, taking 10 of them out is impressive
BEST video i saw so far from PADDY ....makes me think alot about my army days...BUT MUCH respect...Paddy will whip my ass in 2 seconds 🤣
Mad props Paddy ..  way to motivate and lead by example.
Paddy is lucky he's not enlisted.  Can you imagine the penalty for flipping off the marine instructor? 🤔😱😱
Love how he keeps saying sorry I’m so fat 😂
1.2m views ,jheeez geez
This was dope, Paddy you’re a real superstar man, keep doing your thing and kicking ass!
You do all of us Scousers proud! Credit to Liverpool mate ! Boss video too!
Paddy is a class act. I know the Marines loved hosting  him!🙂
Love it. Respect to all. 💪💥
Brilliant work my cross-pond amigo.  your positivity shows.  win or loss you seem like a real champion/winner
paddy apologizing for being fat LOL
Yooo this looks so hard 😂😂🫡
This is dope af
Fighters are death machines who trasform their entire bodies in weapons, wow...
I hope they had a Scouse translation team on standby!
Awesome paddy man when's the next fight bro
Love it 😀
Paddy is such a humble,cool dude.more guys in the ufc need to take lessons from paddy.I’m rooting for you all the way brother…
That ammunition box was cool as fuck!!!
these guys were raiders?
Dame he's going to be a heavy weight soon
Love this guy's authenticity. All the best Baddy
Try doing these same exercises after 24 hours of a clean vegetarian diet. Just for fun. Do it.
As a marine this is great to see, thanks for going out there paddy!
So cool this!! Be interesting to see the marines if they could strike. Doing all that crazy dead killing stuff
I love the Q & A - thank you so much for spending your time with these awesome Marines - thank you for continually promoting people talking about their issues with someone and try working on their mental health!!  <3
What a legend
Wholesome
“Sorry  i’m so fat man” 🤣😂😂 - you won me over dude 😅
I have to say sorry I'm so fat!! hilarious!!
This was awesome,  hope he gets the proper superstar status he deserves
What a cool fucking fighter.. I'm all for the hype but this is a video I genuinely wanted to see
2:38 omg im laughing so hard lad hahahahahahahahhahahaha this made my day 3:00 and he kept saying sorry lad hahha i just can't with it
Time for a Discovery show!
That was soo cool.. you are awesome Paddy much respect for what you did  with our Marine's ..them Marine's are super  badass too, but let's keep in mind Marine's are trained for the kill, but most definitely just added to their arsenal of fighting techniques from Paddy.They took Paddy to the edge working those McDonalds French Fries off his chubby ass.  There is something to say for those who carry extra weight around and the person knows how to wield it.They are getting a workout all day carrying around all that weight which would make them very strong naturally.Semper Fi To all our Marine's for an awesome inside look of getting to witness you guys showcasing your skills, strength and comradery and of course to Paddy the Baddy!
Awesome what a geeeeezer nice to see gim give back and get a good sesh in to lol
What an absolute guy!😂 he’s amazing and so chill and just sound asf haha
Great video Paddy
This guy has really won me over!! Love his attitude and I hope he doesn't turn into what Connor McGregor turned into!!! Keep speaking up for mental health laddie!!
paddy the faty
This why this mf is my favorite fighter. I want him and Mike Tyson to hang out one day, that video would be dope
Aghh
Two paddys in one show, Lost about 10 stone there, smashed it
You saw Paddy not care at the start then he got into it. He remembered these guys don't complain.
Jesus Christ called people everywhere to repent, therefore, if you confess with your lips the Lord Jesus and believe with all your heart that God
I can't believe every one of them tapped out like pussies. not one was willing to go the distance.
We used to call 9th Comm Bn “9th Crime Bn”
Saying you fought or trained with Marines is the equivalent to saying you fought or trained with high schoolers. It hasn’t been impressive since 1999 and several were women soooo
Paddy looks right at home .love this guys  energy,
Respet to you for respecting our Brothers. Semper Fi to all my Devil Dogs and keep getting after it Paddy.
What an absolute treat that would be to have a pro fighter come in and give pointers.
legend
Paddy the LEWIS CAPALDI of fighting
Awsome 👏
Paddy consistently being himself and putting himself out there for the people to see is why he's a star. A great lad who fights hard love ya Paddy!
Dude paddy is the baddy glad to see he's training with our boys in the military your the man paddy America loves u man
Dope💥✊️👏 And btw mental disorder isn't a disease.  It's a misunderstanding of what we become. How to diagnose or treat it is also misunderstood.  "Even a Broken Watch is Right 2 Times a day".
Class. Got quite emotional at the end.
song name at 5:50?
Would love to see Khabib doing this. Fantástico vídeo.
paddy is so funny telling everybody how fat he is like he isnt gonna get it down in a week lol. he makes my day
Most Marines are not trained in this form of combat.  These Marines may have need trained in advanced hand-to-hand combat, but it seems like they aren't trained in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu
Man I'm behind the times! Just caught my first paddycast with Jocko yesterday. So good!! This one has some amazing production that tells a great story. Keep it up m8
Man... those Marines needed to hear that from someone like Paddy. Always told to suck it up and put a can of man in it. I hope any serviceman who watched this will not be ashamed or scared to seek mental health help. And if their SNCO or higher ups punish them for seeking help or going to the BAS to start treatment. Paddy should t-bag those SNCO and officers like he did to Leavitt on his last fight. Thanks for doing this Paddy!
A champ even without a belt. Semper Fi
Can’t even compare him to Conor. They guys to nice to be put in a league near him. I’m a mcgregor fan but he’s not a nice person and only cares for himself. Paddy ur a legend inside and outside the cage bro keep doing ur thing
"Sorry I'm a fat bastard" every time someone lift him up 😂😂😂 what a legend this guy is.
errr wow beast laa
The man is a legend
all that training just to be used to invade other 3rd world countries and get shit on and die lmaoo america is a joke
At 0:02 that hand thou
Is right 👍🏻
All he kept saying is sorry I'm so fat lol.u got to luv paddy......
🎶I read the news today oh boy. The English baddie had just won the war🎶
The branches of Military, should incorporate this style UFC in their training, to adapt to the future of self defence , Cool Ehhh !
Now that’s one badass roll model
Paddy is a real champ in the making! Mark my words he will have a belt!
Dude is too cool.
Paddy’s getting a proper lump he ain’t that fat he’s just a big lad  He’ll be fighting kamzat at some stage
Paddy flipping the marines off and calling them “lads” is gold lol 😁😅
As a Dee Dar I say this through gritted teeth, I fucking love this scouser!!!!!!
Watching Paddy in this video makes me proud to be a Scouser. What a fantastic representative of our city. The marines are all cool lads as well. This one of the best YouTube videos I have seen.
Love it :) I just imagine the "typical youtube title" would be me vs 10 USMC - no loss ezpz.  They're all doing great, it's just that it shows how much you've practiced this sport. Well done mate :)
Awesome! Semper Fi
Thank you marines for all your service.
He’s a good kid.
“What they said” lol
Gnarly
This is kind of funny tho. They literally put a legit black belt against a bunch of most likely white belts lol
what is the hold at 7:33? I don't know much about Jiu-Jitsu but it didn't look like that position would hurt very much. Would anybody be able to explain?
Paddy now a tier two MARSOC operator
proper lad right there
Sick as always, mate you should walk out with the Marines stuff, get the crowd behind you in US the way they are at home
Paddy khamzat chimaev is overweight
You’re going far in life my dude …. true character Paddy
Chris got so tough
Absolut legend 🤝 😊
Keeping it real with some warriors in training. Cool.
@ 7:11 the guys like: “stalemate?” Paddy’s silence was like : ‘nope just give it a sec’ 😂😂😂😂
Paddy the baddy.
If paddy is doing this to them. Just imagine what khabib would do to them🤣
Okay that impressive
Beast
I love how on paddy's own channel he gives so much respect and screen time to the Marines. This lad has his ego in check and everything he does seems to come from a positive place. Top man!
fucking hell pad, drop the ufc career and focus on youtube lad. You'll be a millionaire in no time
Paddy you're the fuckin man
This guy is doing it right. Straight cash
Marines are BADASS'S!!!!!!!
What a wonderful guy and the group of marines are soo chilled Af, nice video!
Each n every time I hear paddy say sorry lad I laugh😂
👏 👍
Paddy "sorry im so fat" the Baddy
LAD DID THE WHOLE MARINE WORKOUT MASSIVE RESPECT ❤️
bro these videos have been fuckin killer. Keep it up bro
GOOD SHIT G!!!
9:38 some of the most honest words I’ve heard. It’s funny how people will call you crazy after saying things like this, but I’d rather be crazy than have belief in my own downfall.
“I have to say sorry, I’m so fat.”   Dude, I’m so happy you’re around. I really dig you and what you’re about. Go Paddy!
Now this was some feelgood content right here !
Paddy is the realest in the UFC. One of the realest alive. My favorite fighter. Speaks the truth. Thinks like a true champion.
I'm a 11b Army, but this was awesome,  im sure this really boosted moral, as we'll cause them to drink that night lol
yes lad, this one goes on my workout watch list
home alone
So basically if the taliban get good at ju jitsu america are fuked
Thank you to our vets!!
Reading the comments Paddy's destroyed a lot of marines' ego and made them act like they were humbled 😂
200+lbs marines find out that an unranked UFC 55'er will dumpster on them back to back.
Paddy constantly apologizing because he's a "fat bastard" is killing me. LMAO
i love paddy and this kinda outside the ring vids are awesome.
You should come back and have them put you through the marksmanship course, that's the thing marines are really the best at.
You just added me as a fan.  Thank you for all that you do.
9th crime IYKYK
I couldnt stop laughing when they were carrying paddy n he was like sorry I'm so fat hahaha..
I feel like I'm tired just from watching the first few minutes of this. I need to call it a day.
Bro gained 20 something pounds in like 1 month. Paddy is Another Type of human
This is brilliant come on paddy lad
Watching Paddy succeed is like watching our kid do well, it just makes me smile 😊😊
This was a Great one!!
2:59 have to say sorry I'm so fat lad xDDDDDDDD
Sick video
I’m convinced there’s a CGI specialist that is making Paddy look fat. Either that, or he has a twin brother who is also an elite fighter but slightly chubbier than him lol
great idea mo
"Sorry lad, I'm a fat bastard." "I have to say sorry I'm so fat man." It's such a contrast to the intense music and workout. Hilarious
For all the people who think ''Uhhh im better than him, he doesn't do anything special''  Pro althets go through hell to make it happen.  Big respect for all of you, awesome content.
I need subtitles
I loved this
This dude is just awesome! Huge respect to you Paddy! I really mean it.
This should be renamed to Paddy the fatty! 🤣
Paddy is my top guy for shit like this. Speaks out and uses the platform he was give for men's mental health. Keep grinding bro
The marines should've used their guns I can't believe they didn't think of that. It's a huge advantage.
Nice
This is such good content. Huge respect Paddy!
#8 ON TRENDING!! Keep going you killer gonna be getting them money fights soon brother ⏰
"Sorry I'm so fat man."
Top content!
Own harts offspring
Mad to see someone from round ours getting world wide famous yeno🤣🤣
If Paddy is fat then I’m a literal planetary body
Dam that accents thick as hell..lol Cool dude tho.
Paddy may just be the realest person in the business. Great watch, rooting for you lad
The production value gets better with each video! This channel will prob be at a million subs way before Paddy Headlines Anfield UFC ! PROPS!
Just shows you how fit and technical he is! Miles off wait and unprepared.... smashed it Lad ❤
What a top lad Paddy is Me being a manc saying that about a Scouser is not easy But the more I see him and listen to him the more I like him The guys so genuine and honest and a great roll model  talks about everything from mental health to eating loads of burgers 😂
Imagine being drunk at a bar and trying to fight paddy
I feel like there are definitely some bad ass marines with skill. But this looks like a bunch of dudes who spent 3 months in an MMA gym. Mind blown here.
Brother across the pond !!thank you paddy for being a great role model    Semper Fi!
Army Vet, mental health is key… we need as many people to advocate as possible. Like Paddy says literally all the time, never be afraid to ask for help.
2:40 Paddy funny asf apologising for being fat 🤦🤣🤣
incredible guy we need more ppl like u paddy keep it up
Love Paddy, quickly becoming one of my favorite fighters. This is a good example of how much better trained fighters are versus your everyday joe. These guys were Marines, so they are probably tougher than the average citizen and Paddy still submitted ten of them. Not that I get in fights anymore, but the first thing I would look at is a dudes ears, I see any cauliflower, I'm running.
Dice up a whole squad of Marines hahaha badass
Next time, see a motorcyclist compete against 10 cyclists. You won't believe the results!
Fucking superb man
Patty has an executive producer for his YouTube channel?
i'm fluent in english but don't understand a thing he says
Paddy just went in and took the whole usmc good job lads 🫡
How can you not love our kid? He’s such a decent human above all else
Shows how shitty mcmap training is lol
Paddy The Buddy has taken over I love this shit!
Talk about your feelings and when you’re down. We will be here for you. Follow his lead and share and care about eachothers mental health
Great, now the marines will jiu jitsu us all when WW3 happens
did you guys swap lewis capaldi with paddy and no one noticed?  🤣😜
If this was just striking, paddy would have got rolled in 1 😂
Jesus Christ man’s was not holding back 🤣
That was tight.
Great video
jake paul: 'best youtube fighter' paddy: 'lol'
I need to say sorry I’m so fat 😂
Good stuff Paddy good stuff U.S.M.C I’m here for it!
“I can beat anyone… put me in there with Francis Ngannou and I’ll pick him up and drop him on his head” hahaha he’s too funny
I am so sorry im fat
That dude carrying paddy on his back and paddy’s just apologizing “I’m sorry I’m so fat” 😂
I like to see how the marines were really Trying against paddy but not in a spiteful way they always smile after
And he did all that with 4 hours of sleep. Basically a mini crucible he pulled off there.
Next take paddy to train with Traine Gae, that would be funny
Patty loved the video
Paddy as in love handles :p
That marine giving paddy the medals ect his voice is so shaky I feel he has some deep shit to get off his chest
The Baddy is a goodie 🖒👊
I just know that they understood about 20 percent of what paddy said 🤣
Great video.  Paddy so down to earth.
Paddy your excellent thankyou
Paddy finally gettin his big time fame good luck paddy💯🏆💪🏾
Paddy acts all tired and like he doesn't know then when he steps up to teach he just takes control like a true coach and leader
He‘s a realy cool guy and a rolemodel. But for me as a not native english speaker it’s realy hard to understand him 😅
This was a great episode tks pal 👍
Paddy's words, and stance, on the mental health of men and suicides made me his fan. I have not been a fan of any professional athlete in years, grown men fan boi over other men playing games or fighting? Nope, I have not been a fan really. But seeing, and hearing, Paddy talk about his loss resonated and I just f'ing love this dude. Substance matters, my dude is full of substance. I can say this proudly, I am a grown ass man that is the fan of another man.... Yep, true story. Wish nothing but the F'ing best for this man of substance.
🐐
that was so fuckin sweet man Great video
Love it lad.
yog´all whyg everyoneg is gettinggh subtitlesg but me ladg Paddie?
Very impressive lad, have Jocko arrange a day of SEAL training since you’re already in San Diego and see how it goes! Lmao
Круто чувак❤
Sorry im so fat lad
Truly a Humble fellow, if only the world had many more.. Awesome Video 🔥🔥🔥 Paddy is Awesome!!!!!
Loved this!
This was great. Love what you’re doing, Paddy. You’re a class example for my two boys. Believe in yourself, express your inner turmoils and just work hard. Best regards from the Netherlands.  You never walk alone.
Spot the baddy @01:22
Great video, thanks for doing it and posting
Respect to Paddy. Unreal.
Damn respect to paddy for this!
Patty is a baddy
would be awesome if they snuck in a pro wrestler under cover lol like a national champion lol
This was a very amazing and inspirational video keep up the hard work paddy you will get that belt
The more 'hard' men we see talking about mental illness the better. Paddy is a great ambassador for MMA. He's real, you feel like he's your mate there's just no bull$hit with him. Bet he loved being 10 and 0 against the marines. living the dream and it's well deserved.
Unreal. He beat them all and laughed afterwards
Those marines represented
Holy shit u need to lose weight
"sorry lad im a fat bastard " 😂🤣🤣🤣
Love when he rolls with the marines, they look really fit but he taps them all. Fun for all.
Soy boys be laughing at his haircut and he out here tapping marines. Love Paddy. Hope he makes it far.
Weird seeing my old Unit's sign and dojo again
Paddy, you've become one of my absolute favorites. Highly skilled, funny as hell, but not afraid to touch on sensitive subjects. True respect for you and what you do
keep shining your light Paddy ,you are a bright light in a dark world
"Sorry I'm so fat" 🤣
Paddy lad,you make people smile big time,wish you all the best for the rest of your life,carry on mate :)
When he said “ This has been one of my hardest workouts THIS week”
Best episode yet.  Im now 100pct team paddy.
Killin' this Youtube shit now mate, subbed!
W
You are such an inspiration, your answer to those questions hit me. Mad respect my man. Thank you!
Nice
Funny as
Enjoyed this
Well in paddy lad
They need a translator for this f*****
Subbed!
A 50 50 day lad.
Fucking love this
Atleast we now know the answer paddy = ATLEAST 10 US marines
Go on paddy.love it.i don’t think they expected paddy the baddy.😂🙏🏽🇬🇧❤️💙
I enjoyed that .
Subbed!
Awesome
Paddy in and outside the ring is night and day. Even if he is a bit more heavy, he still has the heart of the lion. Can't wait to see him back in the cage, it's always great seeing his fights.
Can you Americans understand the accent or do you need to concentrate/ re-listen
If I’m not mistaken the skull in the back is the marine raider skull
Paddy gets a lot of undeserved heat from fans, he's good for mma if you ask me, we have plenty of personality less bores already in the UFC
Paddy thank you. I work in EMS and respond to young marines just like those lads you rolled with and talked to. You could’ve easily saved one of those marines life. You never really know where someone is in life and those guys have some very high stressful jobs!
Mind blowing how much difference there is between a pro ufc fighter and pretty much everyone else. Paddy is the man fcking love this dude
Oh my, this was at my work. Wtf
All I heard “I’m sorrri laddie I’m souuuu fahht”
What guys!
video recap: 🖕🏼 ahahhaah
Unbelievable content baddy wholesome swole and you took Gab gracefully! Thanks from our boys🇺🇸
We dont know what 20 kilos are in America 😉
Paddy bringing the Bret Hart into it... Saying if you  don't want to be the Best There is, best there was, best  there ever will be... haha.
I like to see Khamzat vs Paddy
what was that last move called. 10-0
As a Marine corps vet that was a black belt in McMap and loves MMA it’s dope seeing this. Awesome content paddy.
This was awesome !
Paddy the Fatty
Imagine tapping 10 marine sergeants in a row 🤯
Young Man, those Marines will never forget those lessons! Cheers bro!
At the end when Paddy ask what was in the ammo crate and the Marines says "Just your typical 5.56", Paddy had no idea what the meant LOL
Loved the shit out of it epic video
Apologizes for being heavy. Love it lol
I remember watching this dude in cage warriors. Thought he had no potential, over 1m views in less than a day? Get paid Paddy god bless
Just hearing you say about having mental health problems and speaking about it makes it better we'll I speak about my mental health problems and it's true I haven't had many breakdowns like I use to keep it real fella
Over a Million views in 22 hours is insane FIREE VIDEO
A million views in less than 24 hours. Truly some Conor shit. Well played Paddy.
he literally looked thinner at the end lol
The Marine Corps Martial Arts Program is physically and mentally demanding. Great video
I believe more in this man than anyone I had every met and known over the years in person. He truly is doing the right thing, setting true examples, and breaking the tide against mainstream icons and what they symbolize. I know so much of what Paddy and some of his mates have been through in the past, I was nearly consumed by own and have scars that will never heal, I had tried reaching out for help, but no one seemed to give a damn, and it was actually my training through boxing, even though I was 30 years old, kept me honed, focused, and gave myself something to believe in, and in time I believed in myself, had love for myself that I had never had before. Thus the light shined on the new days ahead to be where I am today. The best thing is after I had cut 110lbs (pushing for the last 30lbs for super middleweight) I had to stop my training after running into medical issues. It hurt, but when the dust settled I had myself and an amazing girlfriend who believed in me as her champion.  My journey was being noticed by others and from social media clips and I had those reach out to me commending me for my dedication in training and my all out war that I had with myself and how I handled it even so I know my suicide awareness segments hit home, even though no more than a few hundred people heard/had seen my story. Thank you so much Paddy The Baddy for everything you are doing , I truly hope to meet you proper one day, I wouldn't have my first attendance to a UFC any other way if I had one wish.
this is super cool!!
How can you hate this guy?
“ as a again sorry I’m so fat” paddy is a legend
The golf clap and the middle fingers from the floor 🤣
3:51 the nose wipe straight to the embrace...mysophobia is real damnit!
He's doing probably more money with youtube videos as beeing in his contract with the world leading mma organisation. lol
This is all fake. No one is even sweating. Anyone in the military will know the amount of drilling and sweating that would be going on there. These guys have nice dry t shirts at the end
“Sorry lad, I’m a fat bastard” 🤣
For fun or not… Paddy made the Marines look stupid. Not only did he keep up with their work out, he tap 10 of them in a row.
waiting for the next video
This is all very basic.
Well done Paddy an inspiration to every one and a credit to Liverpool.My best friends are scousers and they are the salt of the earth.
Really good guy!!!
100% no chance of ever becoming UFC champion. Best of luck journeyman dork.
Paddy is a bad man but you can see he is has respect for these warriors aswell. Great dude
Great vid paddy loved seeing 2 worlds coming together these guys had a great time and you too a good learning experience good guys!
So this is how he loses weight. Interesting
Everything Paddy does is just brilliant and beautiful to watch. Such a good guy, solid dude, and absolute lad!
Its important to note how stupid hot it is in Southern California right now lol
is that mf ssgt nimphie
Jiu Jitsu levels in this vid. Strong work, Semper Fi and Godspeed!
Class video that 👌
Amazing video
Different levels in this game. Quality from paddy
Sorry I'm so fat.   😂😂😂
This video made me want to re enlist.
This dude is such a class act fr. Much respect.
This is such a great video and some great insight to the type of character he is. Comes across as a genuine top bloke.
I love this
that clap at 4:05 needs to Paddys fight celebration from now on hahahah
Didn't really know much about Paddy before this video other than his fights. Has really heighten my opinion of him after watching.
Nice for them to sit and talk after the workout 👍
Submitting 10 marines in a row...some of the toughest people on earth...like nothing. Way impressive. The Gracies were and still are right.
Paddy, you’ll get you ankles shot off low crawling like that 😂
Paddy has been growing on me. After this video im a fan. He seem chill laid back and just a fun dude to be around.
Best vid ever!
Paddy always carries himself like a legend, what a guy
Great episode! Do you think the Marines just aren’t as used to the sensation of being choked or uncomfortable as Paddy is? Some of the situations looked survivable assuming you are used to having things compressed that ordinarily shouldn’t be. Just asking
Paddy the Baddy for sure. That was an intense session!
He keeps saying sorry for being fat lmaoooo
Paddy is such a cool dude.
I lost it at “sorry lad I’m a fat bastard!” Dude was bout dead underneath him lol
Great guy
I'm dealing with some issues myself, and just now (after years) I am being honest with people, I tried for so long to keep it to myself and pretending nothing was wrong. Couldn't keep that up anymore and broke down. I don't care anymore what people think of me. Just be honest with the ones you love. Nothing worse predending  you're alright when you're not. Just talk to someone. Anyone. Don't isolate yourself, it'll fuck you up.
Love this!
Paddy was my dude before this but as military vet I definitely fuck with paddy after this. Awesome dude.
Amazing content man fr this was so sick to watch. love what you're doing for the sport keep it up bro, we believe in you !!!
Good man paddy!!
Paddy the legend, easy the best fighter in the ufc In years 😉👊🏼
7:11 “Stalemate?  Reset?”  From almost knee on neck😂.  Sure.
Paddy is GOATed bro. How can you not love em? He just gained an entire military as fans. Gave these men and women skills that might save their lives one day.
Paddy is and will be an amazing fighter and human being!
Legendary Level Get out of the chest lads Respect
I said I’d never like paddy because of him chewing his food into the mike.  But after hearing his Q&A I immediately liked and subbed
Such a fun guy.
Wtf language is this?  Subtitles please
even paddy makes weight
Another crazy video🔥
I smiled the whole way through this. A fighter vs fighters. There's no profession a I respect more than these 2 different types of fighters.
Luv this guy!
Patty🥰
You will be the best that ever is, was, or will be.
I’m a weirdo lad proper weirdo
Go 'ead Paddy lad. Grounded Scouser 💪
amazing.
My issue with Paddy is he's mostly fluff hype.  Ya the kids and immature adults fall for that shite but until he fights someone legit he's just a circus act. Cheers
Paddy’s responses was like my first month in the fleet lmfaoo
Paddy’s responses was like my first month in the fleet lmfaoo
Brilliant. Well done baddy.
2:40 sorry lad im a fat b*stard 🤣😂got me howling
Love it!! Total mindset. He hates the BS exercises but can roll with fresh guys for a good length of time. His noGi Jiu Jitsu is legit. Love this guy!
wow he is really a great guy! i love it :)
Proper good person right here. Keep advocating for men's mental health. We need it to be reckonized more and more
Easily my favourite fighter. Really loved this vlog
such a fucking "dude". i feel like no matter how thorny he can get or jokes get hard. if you're his friend, YOU ARE HIS FUCKING FRIEND. he gives of the feeling of, the friend that will answer the phone at 2 in the morning when you need something. and already be 5 minutes on the way.  hope his career is long and successful.
The UFC is getting creative at tricking Paddy to losing weight haha
My man sounding like John Lennon while tapping out US Marines.
Brilliant!
That was awesome paddy is a man of the people for real
Paddy u the man mate absolute boss
Liked commented subscribed
Just shows how good UFC fighters are. Awsome video.
I like Paddy. He'll get addicted to this. It's why Marines are killers. They kill themselves first.
Man, these lads just wanna move permanently to Cali while being very nice in their countries..ot doesnt work that way, how about go teaching it all to brits maybe?The heck doing in..san Diego..go back to your pond first..nice Guy
Anyone know the song from the jiu-jitsu vs marines montage?
very cool
Gotta do this again bro, paddy training the soldiers is how u win wars
u better git ur fattass back
Loved this video, all the best Paddy!
0:04 kinda sus
If Khabib would wrestle with them: why u tap go sleep,go sleep
Eres bueno.. pero a topuria ya me gustaría ver si lo sometes.. suerte panceta
Paddy is on his off season let the man indulge and chill lol 🤣. They got him in marine training, man ain't got time for that 😂🤣
Im so sorry im fat 😂😂 Paddy you are funny geeza 💪
Paddy is so funny.  My god im dying  Edit: I love the moment right before these dudes tap.  Every single one of em - you can see the calmness as they are looking for a way out, right up until paddy cranks it down a bit Edit 2: Gettin a coin is big deal.  impressive
This mf is the worst. Oohrah tho
This video made me laugh, made me happy, made me get adrenaline, made me cry. I didn't expect that much emotion in 12 minutes lol. Paddy has all my respect.
Lay off the pies pads
that girl wipes tf out like I can't carry you like the Boyz do hahaha that 200 lbs helped a bit love it he should fight at that weight
I'm about 3mins into the vid, 70% of it is just paddy apologising for being fat 😆😆
When it Come’s To Combat Fighting Paddy is on Another Level ✌️😏
Apparently everyone in the comments section is from the marines
Damn he gains so much weight and spring back to his form when needed to
I was training for my black belt (MACMAP) in 2011 and Cain Velasquez visited us and it was crazy, 20 Marines taking pictures with the champ and he was so humble we just didn't train or grapple, just pictures and brief
Paddy your a real one bro
Paddy - Marines 10-0 _0/
Paddy - Keep kicking ass, changing minds and chewing gum - but always be out of gum. Cariad fawr o Gymru brawd - Much love from Wales brother x
😂”sorry I’m so fat”
Not a single squat or lunge was done this day.
On fucking point. nice mindset 🦸‍♀
“Sorry lad, I’m a fat bastard” that has the be put on a merch shirt
Every person in this thread in or from the military "Thank You for your service" Thanks Paddy I am sure you inspired many and many have inspired you!!
Did the say marine core or marine cult?  https://youtu.be/TDz0GOI1akk
Campenalton here I come
I love this guy no homo he's a legend makes me smile what a guy
Wow- that was amazing- up with the best videos on this channel
7:25 paddy a baddy 🥵🥵
Paddy is just such an amazing human being. Never let fame and fortune change you mate! Would be an honor to visit an all you can eat buffet with you and tear it up after your next victory in the octagon LOL.
Hard not to like the dude especially when he’s someone that is actually speaking up about Mens health Major props
Top geezer
What a monster
Paddy is a great man for speaking as truthfully about mental illness as he does. We love yah brother.
they really gave bro a challenge coin
Best one yet this Patrick! Quality 👊🏻
bro keep it up love what ya doin😘😎
Real shit paddy Kudos lad John from huyton Great to see positive influences out there inspiring the kids and talking about mental health Best of luck going forward mate you deserve it
Paddy will never be Champion he is not skilled and disciplined enough he is a fake hype train
Bro PADDY IS BLOWING UP!!!
Patty has small man complex. He wants people to see him as a tank. Really he's just a scronny little dude.
How can you not like this dude?
Love you lad you deserve everything coming your way bud ! Keep being yourself Paddy you are a legend mate <3
FAT OR NOT PADDY U ARE A FUCKING BEAST. ILOVE YOU FATTY!!!!!!
Paddy vs khamzat ...
Please do the British paras next
MCMAP is absolute garbage. When I served I couldn't believe that this is what they were teaching our Marines. It honestly served no real purpose except it inflated many people's egos whenever they went up in a belt class. I literally got my black belt in less than 6 months. Absolute Joke of a Martial Art.
Good shit Paddy
Paddy, remove the watch next time will ya? Thanks.
He said sorry I’m so fat lad 🤣🤣
Semper Fi, love the respect you have for the core Paddy. Hoping my brothers and sisters made it fun for you, man you did some work!! You're the man, keep it up brotha!
Paddy of season is funny AF haahhaahah
Good stuff! What they said lol
Can't thank you enough for being so open about your struggles with mental health Paddy, it means a lot. You're the man!
Great vid pallll… get in with the royal marines next time🙌
Paddy giving some baddy to the army guys
Paddy top boy. Saludos desde Madrid España. Honor a los que luchan.
Paddy is just so likable, I personally have never enjoyed a fighters journey as I have his ( granted it was only since joining ufc I am a "casual").
go ed la
That boy did not gas out... 10 burgers and 10 marines just like nothing
I love paddy “crawling” by dragging his legs 😂
Don't like paddy in the ring, but this made me like him a bit more. He's on the right track to be a super star with this kind of content. I even subscribed lol
Jesus christ, Paddy is a fking beast. You don't really realise just how good he is until he literally makes 10 marines tap out one after another. Jeeeeees
Paddy is my favourite ufc fighter he is such a down to earth genuine guy and his tough as fuck. Go on my bro
Love you  Dude you're freaking amazing
What a legend
Enjoyed that Paddy,no watched anyone like you since Connor but  your attitude right now is spot on, don’t sell out and stay true big yin.  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿🍀🔴
you can fully tell during the tapout session he did he was going super light so he didn't injure anyone too super impressive
‘Ahz eye say, Am sorree I’m so phat’ 😂😂😂
2:18
What an awesome vid Paddy. Loved the content. Mutual respect and looked like you had a hard work out
When you said that the 1st part of fixing depression is accepting that it's real, it hit me. You try and tell people and they take the piss, you feel like you have to deal with it yourself.
Seems like a great dude!!
Mentality = bulletproof
2:21 he wasn't taking the guy seriously and had to correct lol
What a nice lad 👍
Paddy's good... Nice..
What a guy you are Paddy! Truly taking your platform and the fight game to another level. Makes me proud to be English and a fellow reds supporter! Some boy man!
I was in first radio battalion which is right across the street from “9th crime” Love Paddy.
Paddy is such a boss. I hope I meet him one day 🤞🏻
Another great video, they lads are in some shape going through those sessions then you get them all tapping. Brilliant. Keep being you, keep smashing it you're a true inspiration
would love to see the transformation until next fight day
The man!!
That gift from the Marines was really great! I know both you and all of those Marines will remember this day!
❤️❤️
Brilliant video. Just shows how elite you are Paddy to take out the Marines 10-0.  I hope they took on board the mental health advice about talking to people. I can imagine in the Marines actually admitting you're having a hard time isn't the easiest place to get help & support, but clearly it works!
I’ve got so much time for this dude!
🔥HOWEVER, BEING ABLE TO BEAT 10 BIG AND TRAINED MARINS ARE INCREDIBLE.🔥 PADDY THE MONSTER!👿☠
Paddy taps out 10 Marines😮 yeh the boys got it💪🏼
What a legend
Just Wow. Paddy the Baddy keeps impressing me the more I watch him. Amazing BJJ skills with incredible answers to their questions, especially the ones relating to mental health(The silent killer). Keep it up dude!
Your channel is growing insanely fast! I remember you having just shy of 100k few months ago! KILLING IT IN AND OUT OF THE CAGE
Hey Paddy, I'm a 60yr old grandfather  and I'm Bipolar but also suffer from major depression and social anxiety most of my life,, I'm in tears listening to you talk about mental health as sometimes I feel so alone, all my family support me, I agree I wouldn't be here without them and a couple of times I'm surprised I still am, it's always in my head that if I wasn't here they wouldn't have to worry about me any longer, I've been on many medications for 12yrs and many private clinic stays here in Oz but the struggle will always be with me, thank you for you honest kind words, Regards Mark
Damn paddy
💣💣💣💣💣THIS EPISODE IS A BOOOOOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!💣💣💣💣💣
The People's Champ
Just a really down to earth guy also one of my favorite  fighters
These Marines seem like good sports.  Great idea whoever thought of having Paddy train and grapple with marines.  Great content.
Paddy is just dreaming of burgers
love it
Paddy the baddy love and respect from Manchester
The Rolex was nice but that small medal would mean more to me . . .good vid
Was very nice when they gave him gifts at the end
All this shows is that you NEED to get your children into combat sports, it doesn't matter how big a person is, you're a dangerous weapon if trained correctly, as a person that was bullied all throughout school I wish I was trained in something to be able to defend myself
Just seems like a solid dude.
nice grappling bro !
It’s insane that he did all of this with only half an hours sleep in him from the day before. Absolute machine.
Thank you Paddy for giving of your time to engage with Marines who are away from family. Semper Fi.
Take a shot for every time he says “sorry I’m so fat”
Sorry ima fat bastard..
Thank you for being open about mental health and telling people to talk about things and not think it’s not manly or something like that I love your message
Outstanding
Hahah..i love #paddy
Why all the beeps so so fu@king annoying
Quality. Got beasted in the “warm up” but still led the jj like a boss. Great vid.
Grappling is a safe sport. Try to do the same thing with striking
Just Dope video🔥🔥🔥🔥
You have enemies living in the gym.  You're too bothered about eating and making videos.   Stick to vlogging lad
The fleminator that dude use it it the dog shit out of me at Boot Camp respect for him though was a great di
Top quality that.
Fuck them up, Pad.
Paddy's brashness is an acquired  taste. But...if this is how he's going to use his PLATFORM, speaking up about Mental Health and dealing with it and spending QUIALTY time with REAL HEROES...then GO PADDY!!! Maybe it could rub off on ALL PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES to STEP and be a LEADER and GIVE BACK.
I’m sorry I’m so fat -me every time I eat
Should've faced the proper UK Marines
fresh sub., hope to meet you one day and grab a self e.
I had no clue paddy was so proficient in bjj. It's cool to see how much fun he has no matter where he goes or what he is doing. Keep it up mane💯🔥🤘
DBC.. Daily Blessings Coming! Thank You ALL for Everything, Everyday!! I’ll watch PADDY HE BADDY, over Sean the Clown ANYDAY!
Paddy mate!
He physically looks like he lost about 10 lbs from the start to the end of this video.
lol marines
amazing
If anyone doubts how strong these fighters are after seeing him tap out theses guys in this exercise kinda brings it all home & how important it is to believe in yourself, And to anyone out there who is suffering with mental issues stay strong and believe things change for the better and they will change faster if you seek help all the best to those going through a dodgy journey in life stay strong and keep believing as your life matters 🌍✌🏼
This was dope as fuck to watch
Anyone else notice the marine wanting to pass the challenge coin through a handshake but Paddy just took the coin at 10:50 ?
Love u paddy bro mad luv from brum. Ps I wish u put all them punk marines to sleep 💤 u went very easy on them
Good shit Paddy, Love ya man!
Paddy, please do Nordics and reverse nordics, your glutes and quads and knees WILL EXPONENTIALLY BECOME STRONGER AND YOUR TAKEDOWNS WILL BECOME EVEN FASTER!!! YOUR EXPLOSION WILL INCREASE, FLEXIBILITY WILL INCREASE, GROIN AND HIPS WILL BECOME STRONGER   You’ll become an absolute freak compared to where you already are 🤌🏼
Same old Paddy entertaining inside and outside of the ring and a genuine down to earth guy enjoying life to the full while being not afraid to talk about mental health or dissing anyone ... What a guy 👍
fair play
Let's just put whatever you think of paddy aside and just take in what we just watched.. him take on a marine circuit then tap 10 of them out! And not in his best shape! Big respect paddy!
Shit! That's a session!
“Sorry I’m so fat lad” so brilliantly British and scouse all at once 😂😂
That's my old Bn dojo. That's dope.  9th comm
bro apologised so many times for being fat hahah legend
"Sorry lad, I´m a fat bastard" while on another guy's back got me good 😅👍
https://youtu.be/QTg0nRvhuhw
proud of you lad well done

“I have ta say, I’m sorry I’m pretty fat lad” - Paddy The Baddy
So damn inspiring. 🙌🏼 I don’t read many comment sections from other videos. The amount of love and support in here shows the power of this incredible person. You’re a superhero. 🤘🏼
I gotta admit I thought Paddy  was a bit of a dick,  but watching this video and a couple of others I have a new appreciation of what a genuine person he is. I'm now a fan. Go get em Paddy.

Such a good Baddy! Great dude!
Fantastic Vid 💪🙏
"im so sorry lad, im a fat bastard" 😂
Everyone knows us marines are shite. The training isn’t even hard. Swear it’s like 12 weeks or some bull shit. Fuck all running and tabbing
Good stuff young fella! After this video, I’m a fan! All the very best to you and your family sir! 👍🇦🇺
Paddy is the Real Goat. So much skill. So much selfcare. Just an amazing Dude 💪🏾!
😁😁😁😁😁😁😁
One of the most honest and real guys to be found.
You gotta love that kid patty ❤ the baddy <
When you knocked out Vendramini I knew that you were going to become the people's champ. Can't wait to see you against Bobby Green or even better against some ranked opponent
Pissing my self everytime they pick you up and you appologise for being so fat 🤣
Very cool
Inside octagon youre a beast but outside youre a amazing normaly good guy.  I m fascinated by you. Greetings from germany
Love ya paddy!

Amazing! They will have gained so much confidence and pass that on and on and on! Well done pal!
Padddyyyyyyyy
You seem like such a humble dude. Earned another fan today mate.

YNWA ♥️
The more I see of Paddy the more I like him, kinda fighter you'd like to go for a pint with. Knew he had mad skill back in CW days and now hes becoming quite a force to be reckoned with in the UFC! Keep up the great work Paddy, loving the vlogs!
That was cool and humble 🤟 thanks Paddy for helping these guys out 👍
Well done paddy, the marines can be tuff. How about a day with the royal marines?
did they tell you that these guys are raiders?
Well done Paddy. 10 - 0 against fit strong Marines, in succession.  Great demonstration of how good you actually are. You certainly gained their respect. 👍
Great video Paddy. Almost makes me want to take up ju jitsu, even at my age.
Paddy earned my respect after this but how good were those marines at BJJ?
Paddy will always loose to food tho😒
Why is he grabbing his Dick, screaming Whoooooo?? 😆😆   I never did that in training 😂😂
"Stalemate?" "nah mate, just having a quick breather"
Wow...u give me strength paddy/ honestly-  look at ya now doin this with marines --amazing - stay well over there !!  U n khamzat down the road-  mega fight.👊
Got a new subscriber right here!

Ha! Paddy the Baddy you say? More like Paddy the Fatty!
PADDY THE -BADDY- LADDIE!!✊
This guy is fit as a fiddle man circuit then to tap out 10 marines no way man 👌
Starting to love this guy more and more.  He can be an amazingly positive personality in UFC and an amazing role model not just for men but all people.
strong dude. good fighter.
Hopefully Paddy gets some Men's mental health t-shirts or merch out there...itl be such a great cause and seller...,I've lost 3 good close friends, and enough is enough.

Amazing inspirational individual 👏
Paddy is a beast
sorry im so fat 😂😂 got to love tho 😁
It is fun to watch paddy getting carried by the marines and he kept saying "sorry for being fat-". I know Paddy is Fat, but it really doesn't matter if he is fat or not, you can literally feel that being around with Paddy is fun! I love this man
10 blokes in a row, fuck I'm nackard watching.
A true Legend !
Stuck through it like a champ even with the chubby cheeks! Respect.
What a legend
Why don't Paddy have many followers??
fuck mate paddy is the man
New Sub. Love this shit and the fact, off fight, paddy enjoys life, food, but in fight he’s proper game..   But respect - this video shows a very different side to the guy.. a side i proper code with..
That was awesome! 👍👍
Just gotta love this guy. The madness of McGregor but the heart of an angel.
Brilliant done paddy
A fat guy shows up, barely hangs with everyone doing the cardio; then taps 10 of them. Love it.
Thank you Paddy for helping me through this rough time. Your attitude is inspiring.
"Sorry lad im a fat bastard" 😂
Proper lad.
This was good video enjoyed it with me morning joint lol  Paddy smart guy smashing YT big money on here always said anyone with a large social media following or famous should do YT is easy money for them
Im following you because of your mental health advocacy & respect for human dignity. Good luck in your career mate.
Good watch thanks brother
Anyone know the song playing when they're rolling (5:50 mark)?
This was soo good!
Bloody love Paddy and all he stands for.💯❤️💪🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿🇺🇸🇬🇧✝️
Paddy the baddy really is a inspiration!!
Once again he shows a real man ethos and the meaning of Brit grit. A great ambassador for our nation.Respect is due.👍
From start to finish, everything about this video was awesome. Well fucking done to all involved.
dude, this just shows if the marines go hand-hand combat with the russians, they prolly get shitted on
I love that he kept saying sorry he’s a fat bastard cause honestly same 🤣
Lmao, why he didn't do this in England ? Américain dream boy's... Better than everything, 350 years of story, 350 years of war and invasion, what a dream.
He is starting to get in shape, he us coming back!!!
Difficult to gain respect from a room full of Marines. Paddy did it with ease
Jesus fuck, this guy is a machine. AGAINST MARINES??
Anybody knows what fitness band Paddy is wearing?
The world needs more well grounded athletes like Paddy, top form!
Way to go lad, sure to be the next big thing! Incredible athlete right here
Absolute legend, i love watching people who are an expert at what they do, paddy is one of them!
Probably my favourite video to date
Absolutely cracking video. Hand 2 hand, Paddy looked unstoppable against these lads. Maybe training military folk would be a good a great sideline 👍. Nice one Paddy 👋👍👍👍
Outstanding Vlogs, mate. Super enjoyable.
This is a great video
this is Great WE Now know Paddy is putting in the work Plus at least its Not Fat camp instead its like a mini Fight camp at least we know that detail
“I’ll just say sorry I’m so fat” 😂
Shows the power of technique.
The most sympathic and real fighter!  Love you Paddy!
They went hard. Blown away
I cracked up when paddy called them big bastards😂
Nice One Paddy!!👊
Character ❤💪
Awesome vid mate I love watching your channel. Been watching you fight too and you have got me watching the sport more (especially when you fight). You are also an inspiration to people, keep it up lad - from a fellow Merseysider (St Helens)
Great skills
I lost 1000 calories just by watching this!
Paddy is freaking thick
Paddy come to some Royal Air Force camps sometime
yeeeeaaaa!!! dope content
Honestly hearing a badass dude like paddy talk about his emotions and mental illness is reassuring. It’s hard to put into words that exactly what I mean, but I’ll definitely be taking his advice.
I think all scourers cry hahahaaha
Seems like such a humble nice kid
Do big paddy next 20 marines👏🏼 great fighter funny person great confidence caring about mental health
i aint gonna lie, i need some of this training, cuz im weak as fcuk
Paddy seems like a real good guy , let's hope he becomes real successful and rich
Top job.
New drinking game, take a shot everytime Paddy flips the bird or apologises for being a fat bastard 😂
That was pretty cool Paddy.  Mad props.
Such a class act.
Nice to see paddy do something like this. Where are the American fighters at. I wish they’d do the same. Especially this month.
Im not sure if anyone saw that but at 6:33 that marine wanted to snap his ankle. OUCH!
another epic episode from Paddy the Fatty
7:11 "Stalemate?" 😂
You're such an inspiration Paddy. Also for the people who struggle with mental health everyday <3!
As a former Londoner who has lived in the U.S (Las Vegas.mostly)for 23(somewhat tumultuous) yrs .it's nice to see someone from across the Pond presenting a decent image(And being an Ambassador for his part of the country).And this young man,is pretty much ur typical 'Scouser' 'Blue Collar,down to earth,quick witted&really no BS about him  (And they call Londoners 'Southern Softie's and we refer to them as Northern B##tard's!.But all said in good Jest!) So I wish him all the best in his career&with his Health!!.
Dude I would love to get trained by paddy
Paddy that was cool!  Marines…the program is awesome!  Semper Fi!
Paddy is the man, he was looking pretty gassed after that warm up though.
Belter vid that paddy representin scousers! And with are American bro’s 2! Good on ye! Nothin but Respect for dat lad😉✌🏻
99% of video: PADDY👉🏿🖕👉🏿🤌
Cant wait to see paddy to beat mcgregors pvp $$ and then stay humble during his whole life. (Don’t let the cash get to you and remember always your mates!) got feeling paddy will always be humble towards anyone, he lacks that spoiled brat attitude, hope paddy stays paddy and be paddy forever! Loving this guy, the new kid on the block for sure.
Bruh this shit is lit
Again a legend attitude. Just a legend all round.
You’re gonna get bare subs from this vid. 👍🏻
This shit had me dying the marine saying no your good 😭
I just got out of the Marine Corps in June and I have years of wrestling under my belt so I’m a pretty decent grappler but that ju jitsu shit is crazy
Way to represent us over the pond
I can see Paddy's plan now 👌🏼 he's building his social media presence so he doesn't have to fight 👊🏼
Great video, great person!
9th Crime
Respect to Paddy the Baddy. I was in the Corp during a unique time. The MC was transitioning over from L.I.N.E combat training during my first enlistment to M.C.M.A.P during my second enlistment. Respect to anyone who test themselves in my beloved Corp. Semper Fi do or die.🇺🇸
Paddy is a beast
Paddy has become an idol to me. Tha k you for being such a big inspiration to me paddy
Paddy I get that my mates are dead and so is my mum I can't talk to my kids cos of my ex
Safe to say Americas marines aren't what their propaganda say it is😂😂😂
Paddy mate pls give them 2 fingers per hand 👌 that's British
Seems like they managed your scouse accent ok too 👊🏻😆
I seen twice where the army guys almost broke there elbow with paddy. Geez What would happen if paddy got hurt, here
algo
Thank you for what you did for my brothers and sisters at Camp Pendleton! Your words on mental health hit the nail. You are probably one of my favorite UFC fighters because of your attitude alone. So glad I found your channel. Rah!
Patty needs to discover key glock and put that music over his videos lol
Tapping marines like a badass
Paddy just tapped out 10 marines
Love these vids pad! just a normal lad like us, they way your buzzing over the ammo gift made me laugh lad 👌🏻
"I just have to say, I'm so sorry I'm fat" had me fuckong dying
Smashing it paddy lad!!!!
People never understand how good ufc fighters actually are. Here you see one tap 10 fucking marines in a row.
Banger video!
Shits insane I don't know much about the ufc but I dont believe paddy is even heavily into wrestling and he fucked em up XD
0:02 the marine dude is holding paddy's balls. What the actual fuck
I would love to come down and train with you for a day a learn some jiu jitsu moves from you. Absolute legend mate, I really think your the next big thing, people say you the next McGregor but a say your the FIRST paddy the baddy pimblett and a think your going to be bigger than Conor McGregor, Conor is the reason I started watching UFC but your the reason a continue to watch it. Keep going strong brother 👊
I love how he's apologizing for "bein so fat" every time someone picks him up 😂😂
Maybe if it was uk marines would be a tougher challenge for ya paddy but you smashed it no problem
Wasn’t the biggest paddy fan as I’m a Manc and he’s a Scouser but I do listen to him sometimes and think alright you’re not a poet but you’re a Lad who’s trying to use his platform for a positive and all the best you mate
Love what your doing paddy, I suffer from mental health myself and just like you were saying I wake up every morning just now feeling depressed and sometimes wish I wasn't here but I go on YouTube and watch your video's every morning then I don't feel so bad. Your an inspiration for the kids growing up and for people with mental health. Keep doing what your doing mate 👊 love you brother!
Paddy the piggy
Apologizing to that dude for bein fat while ON HIS SHOULDERS made me laugh so hard
Top bloke
Paddy continuously apologizing for his weight when they had to carry him 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Great episode
Nice one lad!
A lot of people seem to give him shit for his weight gain. But the dude is probably all lean muscle. Not only that, to be shredded is very unrealistic on a regular basis unless you're training for something specific. Or that's just all you do everyday. When it comes to fame. People always want to a fantasy and they make it a reality in the real world. Disney for example did the whole super slim waist on their princesses. And it sold. I'm not saying you can't be shredded. But it's not gonna be easy when your life has a lot of other shit in it.
Fools gonna be in shape of he keeps this up😂😂
Semper Fi !
HE LOOKS JUST LIKE OWEN HART💯RIP OWEN HART❤
Paddy you got some Mad skills!
Killed it, loved this video, sky's the limit for him
Paddy looks like Chris Griffin if he stole your girl.
Man I have the upmost respect for Paddy! I knew I made a good pick for my favorite fighter back before he went UFC.  And as to my Marines, thank you all for sacrificing so much so we can all live so well!
Paddy! you probably touched a lot of these Marines' hearts for the better. It always amazes me seeing grown strong men being able to talk about their mental battles and how to overcome them. Men suffer in silence because of toxic masculinity. Thank you for being different! 👏
Why do pogs always do the fun stuff
Paddy is an absolute legend.
That's why the world loves you Paddy, a genuine mad lad ! That video was heavy !
THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME✌🏿
“Stains make us better”
Logan Paul or Jake Paul whoever it is walking out with a Pokemon card my holy f****** god Paddy the baddy to walk out with an emblem presented to him by the people that protect the country of America
Well done Paddy. Great video
Man Patty and Tyson Fury help me a lot with my mental state sometimes
Paddy out here making America great again. Paddy 2024 🤣
A shame to hear you’re a socialist, seriously. Classic Liverpool moment
Love you Paddy !!!  Best of luck in the future 🙏
paddy isnt just a fighter anymore. he's becoming an icon in the fighting world. his advocation for mental health is going to change the entire fighting industry. thanks dude
Former marine, paddy just want you to know this meant so much to all these guys. I know I would have been beyond happy just  to get to meet you but to train with you as well. Just amazing. Things like this make those bad days seem a lot less bad haha
As  a Marine stationed on Pendleton this is amazing and wish I could have joined. This should have been  have been a bigger event honestly but I think the plaque was fitting and personal just like the training session and post discussion.
My man's a proper star
Gotta admit it was funny when the challenge coin was presented in normal manner (coin in hand for shake pass) and Paddy just picked it up. Reminds you that not everyone knows these little things that you think is so common while in. Anyways Man’s is a great and genuine guy for real! Keep doing amazing things and not being afraid to get things off your chest! Good work!
This should be your new fitness program mate.
how can you hate on Paddy. he just seems like the coolest lad!
Coolest mfer in the UFC right now and maybe ever was.
"I don’t care if you have 7 arms" haha 😂
one of the best videos out here
May I ask what watch is he wearing on his right hand?
That's was awesome, paddy is a machine
You're doing more than just running the world of MMA Paddy you're making a difference!
Ok… wasn’t sure about this guy. I’m a new fan now. Good video
Thank you for doing all of this. Men and women need to hear this and see this.
The last part was toooooo! Hard
Fattest head in the game.
You know he was tired as f.. when he finished the last guy with a simple smash
Portnoy is filling you're head with nonsense. Go 2 build a bear, stuff a jam sandwich in it and try you're best not to eat it, drop it off Pattington way you clown.
I'm a Tropic Lightning veteran. Army Infantry average day was morning PT some was fun, Combat Football was the best. 3 five mile runs per week uphill with combat boots. Most supplemented with swimming, martial arts and I went surfing. The difference was most of us were 18-19 years old. These guys would be old in my Army.
Paddy is jacked
Haven’t seen a good video in a while good job 👏 watched the whole thing 💯
Who else though he looked way skinner after 😭😭😭😂
lmao that was funny
“So you wanna call a stalemate” ahahaha paddy was just sitting on him to catch his breath
Top man
8:32 Commend his honesty with his struggles with depression and mental struggles; It's too bad our US military and society will take away potential Marines and these Marines careers for that kind of honesty and taking his *_GOOD_* advice.... there is no mystery why so many of our bravest die at their own hands; because they are forced to face these battles in secret and often alone(even though so *many* have the same struggles).
Paddy’s one of those guys it’s impossible not to like him.
Paddy just made me 10x more of a fan
man apologizing all the time for being fat is so hilarious
I idolize paddy not in the fighter sense but with his mindset and words of wisdom. The fighter stuff also but I’m just not in the ring like him
You’re the man Paddy thank for spending time with our marines and giving everyone that watches you a better outlook on life. You’re truly an inspiration to all your fans 💯
Paddy is our king bois
Paddy I was on duty when you were on base man!! I wish I would’ve known other wise I would’ve gone to that part of base. You’re the best man don’t ever change, oh and if you like lucha libres in San Diego I recommend you try out sayulitas
What id do to have 30 mins of paddys time just to chat shit. Legend. Next up paddy goes to war with the British Special forces hahahah
Good shit👊
Paddy every time they carried him   “Sorry I’m a fat bastard” 🤣🤣
10-0 Against Marines. Respect these MMA fighters.
I tried JJ once and got put in a triangle choke I just shit my pants
Absolutely your best video mate!
Paddy's self made marketing is fuckin off the chain
This awesome!  Keep it going! Positivity and happiness is key
I remember when he first made a YouTube , this dude is on a hype train and I'm aboard . ChuChu lads
aspiring MMA fighters better study well from Paddy. THIS IS HOW YOU BUILD A CAREER. THIS IS HOW YOU ESTABLISH YOUR FANBASE. Clout and talking shit can only get you so much, you can talk shit about anyone's family and friends all you want, but if you want a solid and proper fanbase, this is the shit.
Men making men better. What a powerful video in so many ways. Love it!
"Sorry I'm so fat lad" - Paddy the Baddy
He's about to be the new Matt Hughs
Damn this was awesome
From being in the marines you can tell Paddy doesn’t know the never lay down rule. We always walk it out
11:22 "typical 5.56"  I don't think he knows what that is... Lol
Skip to 2:30 hahahaha
I new he would be a superstar and he will be the new ufc champion Mark my words world his hearts in the right spot love the paddy the baddy
WOw, Marines normally don't give honors out side their org. You have their respect Paddy. Amazing stuff, proud of you man. Army is strong, 3rd of the 41st Inft. strong, Hell on Wheels mate 78'-81'. Much love from Minnesota Paddy!
Seriously, how can you not like this guy
Paddy's star is goanna rise.
Sick video
7:19 hand full of wang
Paddy is the only one that levels khabib on the ground game ...I will love to see it
Sickh 😂 😂 the way he says it
The marines never even had a chance...
Love paddy 😂
Paddy the gun
I'm so sorry I'm so fat 🤣🤣
Man I know exactly how paddy felt, crying everyday not even knowing why your crying 😢
Love yous Paddy! ❤️
Marines hoooorahhhh Semper fi
The heck of  video champ...
Nice one lad👍
Good
Just carrying one of them soldier is enough exercise fo me for a week.
mad lad
That was really cool bro, keep it up
Nah lad I said put his rist on his bach it's clear English yea
Love this dude… funny, energetic, very hard working and awesome personality. Paddy the Baddy
I’m a Manc, but Paddy is my favourite fighter, seems a top lad. Keep up the good work Paddy 👍
“Ah hafta say Ahm Soddy Ahm soo fat” - Faddy the Batty
awesome stuff, great vid
Paddy apologizing for bein 'fat' is hilarious
The way patty keeps saying sorry he’s a fat bastard has me laughing so fucking much 🤣🤣🤣
This in no way makes any one of those marines look bad. How can rolling with a UFC badass make you look bad? Anyway, great content and thanks to all our US Marine brothers and sisters for their service, from a humble, grateful Brit 🙌🏻 #StrongerTogether
That is fucking awesome
Keeps apologizing for outweighing them by 40-50lb and they keep telling him it's no big deal lmao, what gentlemen
Paddy is already a legend imo. Tough and caring guy, his empathy shines through. Wish him all the best
As a Marine, thank you for giving some of my brothers your time. You’re a down to earth man and your post fight speech will live on forever.💯
Marine corps vet here and I would like to say you're an inspiration to me paddy. I've been through some tough times after my service but we will always continue to fight. Really appreciate everything you do.
This was class Need to do more of these paddy
Paddy is hands down my favorite fighter, he is amazing. He rolled 10 marines, helps people with mental health, has a great podcast, is a great fighter, he’s funny. I hope he gets a title fight soon Edit: thx for the likes, I know that he ain’t getting a title shot right now but he’s a hell of a fighter. The only thing bad about his fighting style is his defense but to be honest that will get better with time. At some point in his career he will become champ mark my words.
His stock just went up in my book!
So cool! Love this dude
Loved this 👍🙌
This was badass tbh
That grappling session was sick
This should be taught starting in elementary school to every American
This was awsome
Sitting here chuckling thinking about how this would go if he came to my air force base 😂
Take him shooting
Man is smart  Gonna be making more from YouTube ads then UFC soon. Lol
Wars are not fought with martial arts like a lot of people think because of the movies 🙄 A marine is a rifleman first. Remember that.
damn he put some weight
not gonna lie paddy,, thats really freaking impressive,
Sorry lad, I’m a fat bastard 🤣🤣
Paulo borrachinha gosta muito de você irmão.
always cracks me up when paddy apologizes and says he's a fat bastard haha.
I see Chris Griffin's about to join the Marines
LMAOO 3:00
What a fucking monster lad. That's how we make em in Liverpool.
Great video! Paddy is a natural at content
2004 OIFII Al Asad USMCR. Been ignored by VA since.
Bro paddy…. Y’all. This cat really built different just man’s is nasty he gonna win no matter what type shit. I haven’t been interested in ufc or anything in a minute bc I haven’t been seeing much. Paddy bringing me back.
He's the one fighter in his weight class that's a breath of fresh air
Paddy is the everyday, average man hero. I truly hope that he accomplishes everything that he sets out to accomplish. If he never wins a ufc title, he will still be a champion in the eyes of athletes around the world.
I LOVE the fact that Paddy is advocating for mental health awareness. It’s IMPORTANT to talk about 💩that weighs heavy.
“Sorry lad I’m a fat bastard”🤣
Super excited I found this. I just became a fan last week I had no idea he existed. And now this?! Hello from Maryland paddy 🤘 🐢 🦀
What’s the song that they were rolling to?
Good show. From the Army side, a retired pipe hitter from The “Red Empire” 7th SFG, thanks for sharing the knowledge and mentality with the boys.
No do it with OC spray
Love it lad
Hope you enjoyed Oceanside Paddy!🤘
Lmao he kept apologizing 😂
Baddy your camera man needs a stabilizer!!!
0:02 👁️👄👁️
Paddy get to workout in shorts and runners the lucky bastard
Ok cool but bullet will travel faster than your single leg takedowns. Hopefully get to see you Fighting for the UFC belt soon
“Sorry I’m so fat” got me😂
This is really great stuff
Paddy is a good kid and I hope he becomes the champ when he decides its time.
i watched a whole video with a language i understand and not get a single sentence he said without backtracking the video
Puts it into perspective how good UFC fighters are.
It’s amazing how people think the military are in any way proficient in any combat sport or good at fighting 💀💀💀 they train with guns not hand to hand combat. A blue belt easily beats them.
Amazing video again lad the contents great and such an inspiration to a lot of people, keep keeping it real lad. ✊🏻🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Did they said " URAAAA " at 11:40
Paddy apologizing every time one of the marines picks him up is so funny😂
The ufc is no joke. Paddy is the real deal
The great Bret Hart ❤️🇨🇦 best there is best there was best there ever will be
“Sorry lad I’m a fat bastard” at 2:41 killed me 🤣
Probably pissed him off with that punishment at the start. Not too smart.
Paddy really holds all of his weight in his face and I love it
Coolest cat in the UFC.
He got visibly skinnier as the video went on
Very nice
Professional fighter a skill sport just more refined with his grappling. Naturally very strong though for his size. Military probably won't spend that much time on this particular skill unless it's a passion outside of the job.   Respect to paddy though he looks like he hasn't been off the couch for 3 months comes in takes care of business with a smile
amazing to see the difference in training
"sorry im a fat bastard" 🤣 had me dying. Love what ya do and who ya are keep it goin mate.
People think military is so tough, then an athlete steps in and beats of 10 of them in a row. Military is military, athletes are athletes!
The World's most unexpected collaboration video ever released...:)
Paddy apologizing for his weight was so funny😆but still good work😤🖐🏽
Good Job Patty... Our boys need that
Paddy's monster I wonder how many Marines khabib would submit .
Well done Paddy that increases your stock with Military global!! GOD BLESS in Jesus Christ name
Realist one out here lad!
"THE BADDY".....! 10 - 0
You're ok for a red nose! Coyb!
Awesome video btw pad
This man is taking off
Baby hair!
“I’m legit sorry. I’m so fat, lad”
Pretty solid for all that talk of being fat. And he kept up just fine.
The amount of times paddy said sorry for being fat 🤣
I love you patty!!! Cant wait for your next fight!!
Your face is so punchable. Your 15 minutes of fame will be over as soon as you fight someon with a pulse and not all these punching bags that make you looke like a superstar
Yooooo my stoned butt didnt even notice this vid got like 650k views first 10 hours.    Cracked the algorithm on this one lad.  Proper heavy that.
Paddy is a TRUE champion
Super wholesome
Killing it fella!
Right on baddie
Probably my favorite video so far.
All weapons can be lethal. Case in point.
Great to see Marines not know how to throw a cross like first thing right off the bat
Props to paddy for this one.  I know that wasnt easy lad
Amazing video. Thank you
...so that was the mechanics in the navy... #BigRedOne #armystrong
If he is such a baddie, why do I like him so much?
4 things at once kinda guy.  Most grapple / scrappy’s end up in the dirt fight to win mentally .   Paddy’s fine example of a positive and possible thinking guy.  Marines , America’s 911 force when you absolutely want to fight !
tbh this was smart most people only know wrestling its the most common then judo or anything else
Amazing content ufc fighters take notes you need a brand if you want to get noticed
They should have taken their socks off...no foot grip
Paddy wins at heavyweight. Am I crazy?
Respect to these guys and their training, but god bless Paddy for letting them really believe that their daily workout is even slightly crazy for a professional athlete lol
Nice, I always liked that guy. Semper fi
10 hours ago 650k views dam
Paddy’s cheeks got smaller the longer the workout went
fk yeah dude. 200lbs looks good on ya. all that mental health talk and you keep apologizing over a bit of weight fam. lose it if you want, but if not, you should be near enough another weight class lol
awesome vid one of the best I've seen so far...
Marines in USA or England?
I fuxkin love this dude… out of all the fighters lol his attitude and humor is hilarious.
Dude his videos are dope
Is he from Liverpool?
Room for one more on the waggon?! 🙌❤️🙌
"Njp every marine without proper socks on clearly we need to get up half an hour earlier now for uniform inspections every day" some fucking gunny right now
Awesome Paddy! Great content dude
San diego we on the map baby
Proud of you paddy, keep it up
If you don’t go in thinking you are the best there is, the best there ever will be do something else.  This is true in so many facets of life.  This was a great one paddy
Sick fam jujitsu on point
Little known thing but most military hand to hand is dogshit
6:18 paddy had enough 😂😂😂
I didn’t really like Paddy at first but he’s cool.
rest in piece to all the soldiers who died in the service. i dived in her cervix
paddy killin the game maybe even more than mcgregor
That was awesome . Semper Fi
Hahahaha “sorry I’m so fat lad” how many times?  Love ya mate
Paddy: “ sorry lad I’m so fat” is so cute to me idk why
🍻🤙🏽
Haha im dying. Sorry lad im a fat bastard 🤣🤣
Paddy the faddy 🤣 "I just ate lad sorry I'm so fat" 🤣🤣🤣
You just know those marines tried with everything they had to not get submitted by a chubby British guy 😂
Do more of these! Such a great video all around.
Affable young man
I remember being here since 10k subs, Your channel is growing way faster then any other ufc fighter on youtube by a long shot.  630k views in 10 hours or so? Keep going paddy = )
"I'm sorry I'm so fat" haha cute
Great video.
This is great content and a great idea
yut
Paddy is a monster and this is not even his peak form
Awesomeness
FANTASTIC WORK PADTHAI
Paddy had to dig deep #8-10
When he’s talking soft and normally, all I can see in my head is Aitch. 😂
As a scouser I'm glad you Americans can understand our accent 🤣👍
Have to say, sorry I'm so fat, lad. 😂
For the algo
Now u all know how badass The UFC's fighters are
dude said rest set when you were locked up on him
Absolutely awesome video. That coin is a true honor. They don't give those out to just anyone.
this is treason........
In highschool we had some marines show up in P.E and started wrestling some guys, it was hilarious watching a full grown roid Marine getting pinned down on his back eating his own knees by a 160 pound 6 foot 17 year old kid. 🤣
This guy is hilarious man, and seems like a genuinely good lad. As a person who has lost a friend to suicide, him using his platform to shine a light on the stigma of men asking for help, is really cool.  Rooting for you from Canada, Paddy.
Paddy ya ain't fat
I just wanna eat pizza and bs with this dude honestly took no time for him to be one of my favorites wish nothing but great things for ya man
imagine you just show up to work and you have to get choked out by patty the baddy, not ideal
They should have said, “now let’s go blow some shit up”. He would have been pumped
PADDY THE LADDY
Get this guy some more followers! Much better content then all that Tiktok Bullshit. I truely hope he is set for life after the UFC.
LOVE YOU PADDYYYYY!!!!!
Is there an unedited video of the 10 marines vs Patty grappling?
💪💪💪🍻🍻🍻
The “sorry I’m so fat lad” be killing me 😂
"And now for the second part of this training, stack up boys, your non lethals are on the table to my right!"  Patty: 0 MC's: 9999999999
Paddy is a good guy. Glad I watched this video. Glad he's speaking out about mental health and is sharing his personal experiences. Atta boy Paddy!
What a dude!
Bro when you see Paddy toward the end after he rolls all those guys. You can see how that workout got him looking right. Man is a beast.
Paddy constantly apologizing for being so fat is hilarious to me 😂
Paddy as new king??
Nothing but respect to Paddy after 4.5 sleep and already having sore legs 😬👊🏼
Paddy needs 8 months BOOT CAMP not just 1 day
Dam that was seriously impressive for him to go through that workout and then tap out 10 marines in a row just goes to show he’s a real baddy!
Taps 10 marines and then goes on to talk about how some days he just had to go back to bed because life was getting to him … doesn’t get any realer than that
Inspiring!
Should have went to a infantry battalion
Like the more I see paddy the more I love his character, crazy you don’t need to be a shit talker to be popular, he’s got skill, heart , a great attitude and personality, he makes it feel like any one of us could be a pro athlete( not knocking his hard work and dedication) just saying he’s human and not playing a act that isn’t relatable to, he’s just himself and that’s all what we have to be is just our selves :) keep going paddy your the man
Legit as they come!
Lets gooooo! Can't wait to see you back in the octogon! 🤜🏽
Lmao I love how he keeps apologizing for being fat . Sorry all the fat shaming has gotten to you lad . It keeps you happy keep it at . A weight cut ain't nothin lol
This is better than any 20 minutes of bullshit on NBC or ABC
Bro he just submitted 10 marines after doing an insane workout. I dont think ppl realize how impressive that was. Those marines train all day everyday so theyre in insane shape.
Man, you are such a good dude. Way to roll with those Marines too!  /salute!
These guys are Marines?....SMH
Love paddy. Guy is real
Talk all ya want but don’t about Paddy, that lad has some serious skill!
That was just grappling and Paddy but away 10 marines. Imagine if they were getting punched in the face too.
Pro mma fighter absolutely wrecked them in BJJ, I'm not surprised mother fuckers
Paddy looks like Owen Hart
Huge dick energy 💥
I live for these videos. Paddy you're monster, bloody love your shit and mentality. Let's go lad!
I could take them and patty
I love the real, personal, professional attitude…
so deluded to think he can beat francis
Rolling with marines is great alot of them may not have the skill but when it comes to being tough they are the toughest
As a veteran and a Paddy fan this got me right in the feels
Paddy would love doing what the marines do behind closed doors too🌈🌈
Keep doing what you doing, good sir. The world needs more people like you.
Your a bloody champion paddy.  Tim from australia
Paddy's constant "sorry I'm so fat lad" has me in stitches 😂😂😂
WTF PADDY I didn’t know you had a Yt channel!!! YESSSIRRRRRRR
Outstanding!🤙💪👊
Paddy should get some time on the range as well to get the full experience.
Tough.  Did the Marines full workout and then rolled....  Awesome!
Let's talk about this Paddy lad. Hard 1 hour work out after do his normal work outs all week the rolling g with 10 young fit and strong marines all of whom would have loved to tap him but couldn't. This lad is on another level.
The way he just took the coin out of his hand LMAO
Was on the fence about Paddy, but he's a propper good lad!
Yo, his pretty good
Monster haha
Paddy apologizing everytime he gets picked up is hilarious, Sucha nice guy
Need more ufc fighters comin out to see how we fight and how we train, and show us the same, we both fight just in different ways
3:00 lmao
Paddy, those marines bestowed a great honor on you, and you were the man! Grueling workout, then still enough in the tank to tapout 10 guys who were giving their all as Marines! Between their workout, and Laird Hamilton's, we expect your cardio to be next level by your next fight! Awesome vid!
I love this kind of content
Makes me love patty even more what a guy
Awesome hanging out with us 🤙
I’m a Paddy fan now!
7:20 dude straight up had his hand resting on Paddy's balls
Semper Fi paddy is playing with the real Marines. The MARSOC Boys
Made respect 🫡. You have each of those marines a story to tell for the rest of their lives.
I bet they all enjothat
God bless the US Marines
This is like an NFL team playing against a high school team lol
Sick!
Paddy anit fat. Just big boned.😅
A true hero. No bullshit hero.
paddy is the coolest dude ever
Paddy - amazing content brother.  Well done wth showing your strengths physically, mentally and spiritually. It’s a great set of values you bring to the sport. You’ve got my support and wish you all the best lad!
Brilliant 10 ~ 0 you had them all off !
My wife of 26yrs just passed away in a car accident.  My mental health is in a bad place. I have to use at least a little of Paddy insensitive to get outta of this hole I'm in .  How can you not little Paddy after watching this!  #RLTW🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲
Good to see Paddy being real with the Marine's. Some day's are tough & to know a top tier mma fighter is just like you, that makes all the difference in the world. Good on ya Paddy. 🍀
Paddy The Fatty🤣🤷
Paddy is a unit mate legend lovely guy ❤️
You just want to be his mate it's unreal.
Paddy isn't lying when he says he puts his fat on in his cheeks. What would happen if he weighed 300 pounds? Would he have cheek rolls?
paddy  you should just fight at the weight in this video
Well deserved
Fucking great episode!!
“Sorry I’m so fat” to the dude carrying him lmao
Paddy continuously apologizing for being a fat bastard is absolutely hilarious lmao
Apologising for being fat was farkn funny
Awesome video, Paddy is the man!  Anyone know the name of the song when they roll?
Get to your tools lol
DAMN!! You a monster!!! That was IMPRESSIVE to say the absolute least!!! 💯💯💯💯💯
Well he is a black belt in BJJ and an athlete / MMA fighter lol 😂
You know, I’m really glad you posted this.  It really added a lot of dimension to my perception of you.  Thank you for helping our soldiers learn some quality jujitsu!
Right on Paddy!! God bless Our USMC!!
Paddy deserve a burger and a shake on the side after all that training lol 😂
hearing paddy constantly apologizing for being fat is hilarious
He's a bloody legend. You can tell just how humble this bloke is by the way he carries himself and interacts with others.  Paddy is one of a fooken kind!
How do you keep changing weight so fast
I gotta say I’m so fat, lad. Ununlikeable.
NOT saying these devils had the ability to tap him BUT he was barefoot vs them in boot socks definitely a disadvantage lol wish I was still in able to be in and train like this.
Paddy should of gotten a military fade
Paddy needs to train with Darren Till and Chimaev! They'd be unstoppable!
Excellent
I remember when he 40k subs smashing it now 👑🇬🇧
Such a proper badass video mate!!  HooooRAHHHHHH
Dudes awesome. I was Navy. I have respect for anyone that puts the uniform on.
I love this a lot!!! I want more! Paddy vs Navy Seals!
Surely im not the only one that felt the biggest take away messages for all those involved were from Paddys statements regarding mental health, especially when so many in the military are effected so horrendously and given such little support. Props to you Paddy, you never know, but that 5min pep talk may have been enough to save a life.
Give him one!
This is so badass!  Love you paddy!
The Marine corps finally allowing mental health to be on the lime light. Thanks Paddy. And about time Marine Corps..
I love this lad. 10/10 top lad. ♥
Need subtitles on Paddy. Sound like he gotta mouth full of peanut butter. Didn't understand a single word. Awesome video!
under exposed footage, slap the videographer!
you're an inspiration and you're absolutely my favorite athlete
Interesting watch I  guess its Game over if the UK had a ground invasion by Russia? They live & breath the ground game!
Ahahahah very cool and awesome episode good on ya paddy.
What did he say?
Congrats on hitting 400k subs👌🏻 You will have 1 million in no time👍🏻
once again lad sorry for being a fat bastard. Couldnt stop laughing. What a character
What an amazing video
Getting slayed
You know they all were drinking Starbucks or monsters beforehand 😂 semper fuc
Hell nah paddy they way the bag slapped you on the face 😂😂 @2:22
idk how paddys gf gunns feel about him carrying the cute female marine on his shoulders while she holds his hand
Nice 🤍
I love this guy…….no homo
Someone that has dealt with mental health issues all his past. I have mad respect for you paddy. Life can be challenging the only way is to push through.
Paddy has absolutely cracked the code how to get into the hearts of the people. He's dealing with everything in such an intelligent way it's like a master-class. I hope Dana doesn't keep his claws in him
Paddy the faddy
beautiful boys. amazing. hoo rah. love and prayers. team America F Yeah! such a wonderful episode.
Thank you Paddy for showing respects to the marines. At least Paddy loves America.   Stop taking freedoms for granted
This dude is a growing force everywhere
Best video on the net this month la
Love the VLogs bro... keep them coming!! 💪🔥
im sorry im so fat LOL
🤎✊🙏💜
As I say sorry I'm so fat, haha
insane video paddy
This was f..king cool as hell ! 😎
I love you Paddy ! But you needed this Brother 🫡
Love this guy
Paddy. You are a beauty.  Thanks for choosing the Marines brother.  We are warriors.  Semper Fi.  Looking forward to your next fight. Send them to the Shadow Realm!!!!!!!
Paddy, you da man
I'm a fan now!!!! lol
Gotta be careful rolling with the military . They’re taught to neck crank, not squeeze. If they go fast enough and you dont have the skills, your dead and they dont even know how they did it. Paddy makes it look easy but at my gym we had a marine come through for a year or so and when he first started we had to break his kill instincts. It was kinda intimidating .
Paddy apologizes for being fat every time a marine carries him. Love it! 😂😂😂
lol Paddy just apologizing for his weight hahaha
loved these grappling sessions, great content
Got to say I was not the biggest fan at first but watching your channel you’re growing on me. Especially when you’re hanging out with the Marines. That’s awesome.I still wish you went to 145 first I just can’t see any way you beat anyone in the top five at 155 pounds. Who knows maybe you will prove me wrong
Sorry I'm so fat
Come to Point Loma next it’s on! I’m your biggest fan!
There is something about those Scooser people, I don't know what it is but I want some. I rang the Samaritans some years ago, they hung up on me.
10 nil.. kkkumon lad.😝
Such a respectable & amazing guy. Mental health advocate for men. My respects to you
First time seeing this guy but I like his mentality.
3:00 "Sorry im so fat right now." XD this is why I love this guy
Me, smoking a cigarette on the toilet: "come on ya pu$$y, it can't be that bad"
Watch the change in Paddy’s demeanour once they hit the mats n start rolling. Serious n all business. Love it!!
Paddy soon becoming best UFC/mma brand ambassador 👌👌💯
I think most of the people saying "why the marines got tapped so easily" is most likely from Europe because most European militaries are trained in Close combat or MMa. The U.S military has Close combat training but focus more on firepower.
kudos Paddy-  rolled wit 10 of them❤️‍🔥🔥🔥
I bet most of these guys were like "Bro what the fuck did he just say for the last 5 minutes?"
Just remember on the battlefield you will never get this close to a marine!!! Good stuff Paddy!!!
Paddy's a machine.. GG
He is lucky that isn’t training for the the Navy
editor did a brillaint job on this
Quality video idea Paddy keep it up! 👌🏽
The apology for being fat…🤣😂
It must be so stink in there lol
Stalemate...Reset while in a mounted triangle and Paddy is simply trying to catch his breath.
Marines are bred to be the most alpha male possible, for a overweight Bloke to come in and 10-0 just shows how capable you are. Granted most probably aren’t trained in jujitsu, but your stamina speaks volumes.
HAHAHA this was great 🧡🧡🧡🧡
His face looks actually smaller at the end lmao Great one though
As a 82nd Airborne Paratrooper Combat Veteran [2009-2010 Iraq]. USMC jarheads are amongst the most highly disciplined cunts around! Solid, Fierce, and pitbulls of the battlefield! FACT! I met many of them in Al Anbar Provence in Iraq and they were/are solid individuals! Highly experienced in combatives!  Paddy, I am glad that you did this and shared it with us! God bless ya M8!
Amazing how an elite athlete like Paddy can dial up the exact amount of force needed based on his opponent's ability.  This ensures inexperienced wrestlers like these don't get hurt.
Great video and thank you USMC for keeping this country safe!!
Uuu raahhh
gives me some respect for the boy
Love Paddy and much love to the US on this day. 💗
Great episode and once again your a class act who use his fame to promote mental health from your heart.  Thank you
Thanks Paddy for going to visit my old stomping ground, Camp Pendleton and training with the marines there.
Paddy is gassed, over weight and sore from training the day before.Proceeds to tap out 10 marines 😂.
I truly believe that UFC fight tactics would benefit all branches of our military even though our men and women are already bad ass
Ok. That was gangster. Tapping out 10 marines in a row after that workout??? The dude’s superhuman.
"The best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be" 9:55 - Bret The Hitman Hart
Paddy's the man
How can you not love him ❤...
Sorry lad  I’m a fat bastard 😂😂😂😂
Paddy currently weighs 250 pounds maybe more! I saw Paddy on a Mike Tyson podcast… Verbatim Mike Tyson called him Paddy the fatty! He likes to eat too much. I think his new best friend is Beard meets food. That’s another person who eats wayy too much food but somehow he’s skinny as fucc
Love you Paddy, thanks for being such an inspiration!
Incredible video 💪
chubby paddy = chaddy...  still dangerous no matter what weight he is at.
People can say anything they want about Paddy and his weight, the dudes a warrior and he doesn't stop.
How many times did he sorry for being fat 🤣
great watch
¿Qué le panzó?
After the Q&A I wanted to be able to press the "thumbs up" button twice
that guy with the baby hair.. Bambi Pamblit :D
Never seen a video like this before. This was a great idea fr. And what better person then paddy😂😂. It could’ve been this big, mean and scary lookin UFC fighter but no, they said paddy could do the job💀. Literally thee nicest looking guy with bright blond hair just slapping around a bunch of marines😂.  lol luv it.
And the sentence of the day is "sorry im so fat" was anyone counting?
The marines had no ego and paddy was great! Really good video, thank you.
So badass ! Go check me out !
Awesome!
Пусть в Россию приезжает, с нашими солдатами поработает.)
God dam it me needs some sub titles lad.
I didn’t know Paddy was into missionary
Outstanding! OohRah!!
I’m sure both the marines and paddy learned something that day. Paddy was a great sport. Mad respect for the Marines and Paddy
It's dope seeing paddy roll with marines. But I got to say 6 degrees of separation is real. Some of these guys had talked to my platoon in bootcamp or instructed me at some point. Just know there where some real warriors in this video.
This man’s content gets better and better
Love this dude and I hope he runs the table on the UFC for many years to come. When I first saw him I thought he reminded me so much of little kid me (hair style and everything!), fearless and goofy and if you saw pics of me back then as a kid, you'd think I was going to look just like this guy when I grew up (not quite, my hair got darker and longer by puberty-lol). Anyway, hope the confidence and attitude stay the same and that he'll always be kind to people outside of the cage.
Awesome, very cool video. Much respect to our Marines. Paddy is a beast! I can't wait to see his next fight.
I really hope they shoved aside the Roseart and broke out the Crayola for that special day.
Good en that cha
That was really good video paddy I'm a fan 👍
The best there is, the best there was, the best there ever will be. Nice seeing Owen Hart using his brothers famous line
Im so proud of paddy.. Thats it, just wanted to write it…
Paddy's Manager/promoter is doing a great job recently
Paddy, you are a great role model for everyone to follow. Keep up the great work
Wow that was some IP man shit right there in real life. 10 man strong got taken out. Then some words of wisdom and inspiration at the end. You can not hate this guy. What a legend.
3:00 😂
Love that all these fellas can roll with him, learn from him and listen to him so respectfully. Unreal lads👏🏻
imagine making 10 marines tap tho
Paddy has fast become my favorite fighter. He gets it done in the cage and his personality outside the cage is top notch. His openness and bringing awareness to mental health is a wonderful thing because it's rare in today's 'macho' culture of men, MMA, and fighting in general. Rarely anyone, man or woman, goes through life without fighting some form of inner demon and it's great to hear from someone in his place talk about it being okay to reach out. I'll support Paddy even if he loses every fight in the cage from here on out because he's winning at this hard thing we all go through called LIFE.
"Sorry for being so fat" hilarious
Paddy you are better than I even thought! HOORAY!
Of course Paddy isn’t going to lose at his own craft to marines. The marines have so many other skills they train for such has weapon handling, land navigation, breaching, recon.
Put Paddy on a rifle range and it wouldn't be close
That’s some serious skill Paddy lad
Respect ✊
When I read "paddy vs 10 marines" I imagined something very different and I'm disappointed. Clickbait! 👎
Paddy lad your a inspiration to loads of people love the videos bro… Be good to come to your gym and meet you some day… take care
That's good work! Alot yall forget he's a black belt smh rookies you think he did them bad he'd absolutely demolish the people talking shit way worse.
BJJ black belts are seriously tough people with an endless box of moves and counters. Nobody without BJJ experience or a ridiculous weight mismatch is beating one in a roll.
Keep doing different things like this
Thank you paddy for showing love to our boys in the service I wish more superstars were like you
People have to remember that UFC fighter's train heavily on this fighting but the military trains on multiple things and obviously most of the training is about guns so obviously yeah a UFC fighter will win
You on fire lad....Good content love them videos 💪
Think I’m subscriber #400k. Cool 😎
Shows you how useless there martial arts program is.
This is the marines, badass yes but not even close to the real badasses
Nah, this is Paddy the Faddy
Great episode Paddy! Cantn’t wait to see you fight in December.
Bravissimo Paddy 👏👏👏♥️
Class video Paddy! Inspirational, and open about your mental health issues. Proper Top Bloke.
Love how Paddy doesnt try to change accent
If paddy keeps winning he eclipses conor easy
As a fellow Brit and ex-Angeleno, I guarantee they only understood 50% of what Paddy was saying, max. 😂
I love that Paddy has run with the ball on his personality. McGregor never did videos like this, give it a year and Paddy will be out earning the best
Loving you as you paddy. Thankyou for being you and showing the world
Love paddy you made me do this mad work out and then roll with you guys but shows his conditioning is very high
It's funny, I had a bad run in with some serious anxiety problems when I was much younger, around 7th grade. I used to cry and fear waking up until it was 4am and I was down the hall waking my mother up. I ended up in therapy and while I didn't consider everything that I was suggested very impactful, I was asked to reach out to some adults or close friends that I was close with and fill them in on how I had been feeling and why I was so worried about this as an issue. I told my parents, I told my brother, I told my closest friends, my closest teachers at school, and at the end of that all, I immediately felt more understood. I felt as though if something did come up I had people that would help me get out of a situation before I panicked, even just knowing that was true put me on the path to getting out of that hole. Get it off your chest.
Don’t know why he left with all his teeth?
insane just how CHUBBY HIS FACE GETS AFTER HIS FIGHT IS OVER.   2 totally different people  I hope he demands $$ from Dana from here on out w rest of his fights!!   I heard last fight was only $16000 that's bs if true
Yoooooooo this is dead class !!  Gotta love our wee mental scouse banger 💪💪💪
Paddy, let's really test yourself with the British Royal Marines ( Bootnecks )  🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Paddy your not fat, you just have more to love :3
Paddy the Fatty
Army veteran here and I really appreciated this video especially how you talked about mental health as it's a big struggle in our community. Thank you for what you do it's inspiring
Boss paddy 400k subs nearly imagine chillin with tyson an stevo
people his name is paddy the baddy, one of the best mma fighters ever…you expect every day GI Joes to tap him out? 😂😂
Cool stuff man! Looks like everyone enjoyed themselves including you.
Beating 10 men in a row is actually insane!! Bro looks chubby but has the stamina of a racehorse
such a humble man,was an easy decision to sub
Quality
🇬🇧🇺🇸👯 for ever
this guy is sooo likeable . ufc has another big star with patty
I love Paddy more with every vlog
I was in the Marines way back. I would like to thank you Paddy! This really meant a lot to each Marine there. More than you would ever know.
Marines being humbled is a great sight to see!
Very impressive Patrick👏👏 well done lad
MAI: “Execute a basic wrist lock” 😂
10:49 He was going for the handshake Lmao
Whoever taught these guys striking and grappling needs to be jailed lol
Can you please make merch. With your face saying "sorry I'm so fat "
The editing made me dizzy ngl
Beating up on the greens coming thru the coarse.  Tap out the instructors paddy!
man he just seems like a good dude
Humble Patty!!! Love this guy
Now put Paddy through SAS or British Commando training to see which he says is harder..
I think Patty is on his way to the welterweight division.
Loved this video. It’s all about improving each other. It’s so heartwarming
We need another video of you in the US Marine Corps
3:00 Me
LOL @ Paddy grabbing the Challenge Coin out of his hand and not shaking it HAHAHA
Scouse power slickkkkkkk kidddddd
Fucking belta
Hoorah!!
Amazing!!!
What a test! Good on you
Paddy is going to be a great coach someday. Watching him shuffle around giving pointers to the marines was a good glimpse into the future lol.
Gotta love Paddy! What a great vid!
This dude looks like he sweats grease
Great video
Taping 10 marines in a row is crazy even if they don’t primarily train like Paddy!!
Proper respect for paddy the buddy, he's a beast in the octagon and an absolute legend of a human being, talks deep and is not shy to talk of mental health issues. Absolute respect
Paddy has exceptional stamina!
3:00
paddy killed 10 marines
2:39
The marines do hand to hand combat every couple of months
Jheeez paddy doing  big bits go on lad 👌🏽💯
cool video paddy , thx a bunch!
Paddy is such a great role model truly can't wait to see what else the world got for him
Love this one paddy lad 👊🏼
Love the content lad, best in the business!
I like paddy but his weight is an absolute embarrassment he should be ashamed showing up like that pro athlete 😂
Man paddy I'm a fatter bitch than you are mate I'm currently 270 lbs 🤣 this would probably kill me
Paddy come let’s put you down, let’s spare? :P
I love how your open about your past depression etc , you really will encourage others to do so too ,  I was in the same boat for 6 months , crying not even taking rubbish to the bin outside , too embarrassed to open my front door .  I'm alot better now in myself and I fucking truly love you for how you are and genuine you are and how you will change / save the many lives to come .  your a blessing to everyone and keep smashing life  it's sick  how your from Liverpool,   love from the wirral
Paddy looking so thick
the more I see Paddy the more of a fan I become.
I like how he apologizes to whoever lifts him 😂
Bro, patty just took out 10 Marines what the fuck LOL this is what our tax dollars pay for.
Sick vid this
Sick content 👌🏼
Pls Stop that with the middle finger you are a Idol now
“Sorry I’m so fat lad” 😂😂😂😂
Oh that paddy! Yous a baddy! GO ON! Show the haters what their in for! 🙏🏼🔴🔴🔴
That looks like Hell 🔥🔥🔥
Love how You challenge yourself, especially with Our Marines 💪🏻💯
Paddy's a bloody legend. Good to see a successful down to earth professional fighter that loves his food 👍🏼
Awesome episode. Inspiring mentality, Paddy
So good
Yes son smashing it against killers
Sorry I’m so fat man 🤣
I love Paddy the nicest guy very sincere and generous heart much love ❤️ xxx
Well fucking done Paddy fully diversified your revenue with YT while sharing the very important message of men's mental health. Pat yourself on the back lad!
Paddies got his hustle down, never thought he'd have vlogs/podcasts like this... not kissing ass but compared to everyone else, its unique next level stuff each time!
Pendleton !!
Luv ya Paddy Lad...
Is there full description of that workout ?
This is gold
Brother I like that you done this! As a war veteran I’ve had tons of experience meeting and become great friends with ufc legends all are retired now but it really is great for the men serving it brings excitement and they learn from the experience.. my hats off too you brother and hope one day too meet you and maybe have you come hangout and go too are range and do some tactical training and send some Lead down range! And meet myself and 14 other sf team members we are all retired now but we do training for law enforcement and civilians.
Thank you for taking the time to spend with people who helped keep my freedom I hold so close to my heart. Love ya paddy
That looks like good training for everyone involved
This is a great watch, wish it was longer
What an animal
Patty I have to say, you have recently won me over as a fan!  You're awesome!!
Those boys are broken and ready to obey !! Not good soldiers
Wow bad ass patty
Paddy apologizing while he’s being carried cracked me up
Paddy. You need to own the phrase "attitude is everything" it fits you down to a tee.
He looked baked AF around 2 mins in
Best channel on YouTube!
Class episode 👏
I mean, the guy is a bjj black belt so no surprise he tapped all the marines. If you took him out on the rifle range vs the marines I'm sure their skill differences with a rifle would be very apparent. Still love to see it though, the fact that this man went out to visit our marines and he's a scouser is just fuckin rad!
*gets carried by marine* “SORRY LAD” 😂
"Sorry lad, i'm a fat bastard" Got me laughing.
Awesome episode and very cool mementos given by the Marines. Great stuff!
As a former Tan belt in MCMAP I would have whooped his ass.
Imagine all of this insane hard work AND top tier martial arts experience. Randy Couture must've felt like the biggest badass (he was)
how do you get your middle finger still that far up mate, despite being so fucked? amazing conditioning!
Great video. God bless you all
How can anyone not like this guy? Booya! Paddy
Mate, if you ever set up a day to meet fans, I'm def coming to Liverpool.  You are such an amazing role model and you do need to be careful what you say online so those lizzards don't ban you :(
Semper FI
Paddy is going to be a worldwide folk hero
WOW
Very impressive taping out 10 us marines
The Name of the song guys ? can't find it on shazam !
Paddy is amazing. What a guy.
Smashing the content, lad. Were there any edited out clips of a marine tapping you? 😋
Great vid Paddy you're an inspiration!
These Marines are weak sauce
What a legend ❤️🤛🏻 real genuine guy the world needs more like paddy lad ❤
and people wonder why im such a paddy fan, incredible fighter, and incredible person
Paddy deserve every penny he earns dude is humble person.
Sheesh replace paddy with khamzat or jon jones and those guys would literally be flying  across the room
Keep evolving  paddy...
Paddy be cheating getting on his feet. Stay on the knees when MCMAP grapplin lol
You can tell the wee token thing and the plaque made from the ammo box was really appreciated from paddy
I enjoyed this allot ngl
Love Paddy bur don't forget.. if you're a marine rolling on the ground.. guess what.. you're already dead.
🫶🏼
Fucking beauty!!!!
Go to the very beginning  at 2sec and pause he has a his hand on dudes balls just taking to him  ayo wtf pause pause pause
How long you in the States bruh🤷🏿‍♂️💪🏿 Thanks for hanging with the guy's I'm sure they deserved this visit 🇺🇸
Paddy your an inspiration lad
That's pretty awesome.
Go on paddy lod ace stuff
Brilliant this loved it 🥰
Love the Bret hitman hart reference
This is better than last nights PPV.
" I have the balance of a ballerina but weigh like a f***ing  sumo wrestler im a weirdo me " ......paddy the baddy 😂😂😂
Massive Respect to you Paddy! I just started this channel & if you ever get about 20-30 minutes or less to be one if not, the first episode to my Podcast on a video call that'd be amazing 👀💭
Not gonna lie bro this made me like and respect you a lot more! Lots of family in the marines and lost many friends and family.. Brutal just like MMA.. You really made these guys day with this Paddy! Kudos to you my friend you have a lifetime fan here!! Cheers!
Badass vid! Those rolls were fire 🔥
paddy will be a belt wearer before it’s all said and done.  you heard it here first.
Royal Marines are better
When you've got that ground work on point it's fire 🔥 Scouse and proud 💪
Nice the bret hart quote.
First time viewer just subbed. You set the bar high lad good on ya!
I love how Paddy keeps apologizing for being fat. 😂
Way to go marine corps still have the same gay ass warmups ten years later. I swear to god the corps pretends CrossFit and jiu jitsu doesn’t exist yet we had CrossFit kandahar.  Why why did we do mcmaps that shot does not nor will it ever work.
Paddy is real as fuck. Love him!
"I would just like to say, I'm sorry I am so fat lad"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣this man Is gold
This is top tier MMA content 🫡
Yes Paddy the 5.56mm rounds from that ammo box woulda been used in an m16. Hope you enjoy your tokens of gratitude. You earned them.
My guy just choked 10 marines after doing there training all day😂 that deserves respect👊🏼
Having the fortitude to do all that then tap 10 in shape dudes shows you the kind of grit and longevity he has. It also shows each of those marines what’s possible if you push yourself. Great Lesson all of them.
Your vids just get better and better!
Great watch as always
Brilliant example
Way to clean house Paddy!  Great bunch of people there who learned some grappling from the future champion.
So happy this man has a YouTube channel wowwww
The culture shock having someone apologies that their to fat (by a few pounds) haha
paddy for the people
Finally, a guy not frightened to speak about mental health 💚
The man's turning out to be a national treasure 🙌
Great content Paddy, can't wait for your next fight 👏
Way #OfTheEpic my friend. What an honor. 🤙🏼
Pretty badass of Paddy to take the time to roll with some E-doggies.
Bad ass. My respect!
Hahahaha paddy just kept apologizing for being fat 😂😂
Paddy a true legend in the sport and he's only been here for such a short time. Love this guy.
Paddy your a true OG
Its awesome Paddy went and trained with the Marines! Wished more UFC fighters would get involved with the military! Mad Respect to you Paddy✌️✌️✌️
Great mash up !  Love ya Paddy
Yut.
Number 1 military in the world and it ain’t even close.
“Sorry I’m so fat lad”
Would love to see him whoop McGregor
As I say sorry I’m so fat man 😂😂
if marine loose vs simple fightee how they can protect all country lol
great vid
Good episode paddy, good bit of PT that.
Seems like it was a fun time, they were all getting along real well!
Hahhaha 🤣🤣 I love paddy this foo said sorry lad I'm sooo fat
Paddy smokes 10 marines and then talks about how he cried every morning until he reached out for help. True alpha male
I wouldn't want to get in the octagon with Paddy as much as I wouldn't want to be facing a US marine on the battlefield. Great vid and props to the USMC!
Wow ... !!! 🤯🤪🤙✌❤😎👍
Paddy is a pro  at what he does. This in know way looks bad on these marines.  They are tough for a living.
What a great film. Love the attitude and how much you had.
Jeez you’re a  flexible mofo! Even 5 years deep in judo I was never that flexi. Crack on lad.
Paddy the Fookin Baddy!!! Thanks for going out there and rollin with my marine brothers and sisters…From a retired Army infantryman, lord knows they need the help 👊🏼🤣
I know exactly where they filmed this haha I see the MTU building on the other side of the fence
I like how he just grabbed the challenge coin instead of receiving it mid handshake 🤝. it's fine, he didn't know, haha.
This is americas finest? Getting tapped back to back by Chris griffin 😂
Hell yeah Paddy !
I’m a ex - state champ wrestler 170 and 189 pds  . Went to Gabriel Gonzaga’s gym in Worcester mass . Personally I did really well . Just don’t give up your neck to guys like patty or you’ll get choked  out each and every time . Gotta learn how to defend those .
As I say I’m sorry I’m so fat lad 😂😂😂
I want a drink with Paddy, I been where he is and overcame it too and when you reach that end, you want nothing more than to help the people still in that hole you climbed out. If you're ever in the UK again and we cross paths Pad, pint of Foster's and a pizza on me.
You can see the experience difference in how Paddy moves while grappling. Mad props to the Marines, but Paddy is called The Baddy for a reason!!! This was a lot of fun to watch!!
imagine being racist AAAAND british... double homicide!
Great video!! Only bad thing I have to say about any military from America that joined with USA corporation is I'm disgusted how they could go to war for a corporation that is know for lying about why we go to war in all wars it's been in. USA military industrial complex has unfortunately been doing the will of evil ones. I pray that any good people within the USA military that are attempting to battle the ones doing bad deeds for the corporation win with no to low casualties
Paddy is rapid at submissions like the man is on a mission world champ very soon ♥️🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Boots on the mats.
Initially i wasn't a fan of Paddy  I have changed that he could possibly be the biggest advocate of mental health issues in men, and that speaking out does not mean you are a lesser man, for that i applaud you  Keep up the good work  Asking for help is ok
Paddy is doing amazing work as a mental health advocate. Thanks Paddy!
They kid just keep getting better! Showing love to our marines and he’s not even from the U.S.  What a fucking guy, truly wish him nothing but the best for being such a stand up guy. Much love brotha!!! 👍🏼💯
Imagine if Khamzat did this  Marines would get ragdolled
This raising Paddy’s stock.. a little bit..!😁
I think Paddy would do well at Light Heavyweight.
we loved this paddy simperfi
That's the us army for ya. 🤣 Brits and Canadians know what's good. 🤷‍♂️ Maybe you should start training them so they're not as weak as they were back when we took over the white house. 🤣
YOURE NOT ALONE IN YOUR STRUGGLES! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Paddy is chubby paddy in this video.
Awesome episode! Thanks Paddy!!
its easy to forget psddy is a badass machine ..
This is awesome. Respect for the Marine brothers.
every episode just keeps getting better and better keep it up paddy👍
Paddys training partner wasn't even sweating!!!
Sorry lad I'm a fat bastard hahaha
Skip to 4:15
Great show Paddy.
Camp Pendleton's cool they have paintballing there and the soldiers have fun with it. Also if you're ever in Carlsbad again try Knockout Pizza, it's a great local pizza place I'm sure you'd love the food there and I'm sure they'd get a treat out of you showing up. Hope you keep enjoying southern california Paddy! Much love from orange county.
This one made me a fan
Gayrines
This was awesome
Paddy is "THE MAN" and funny as f**k.
I love gou Paddy
my dude thanks for showing our troops some love.
"As I say, I'm sorry am so fat lad" 🤣
Marines are machine damn
these vlogs are my favourite thing to watch on YouTube ATM
Best video I've seen this fair play paddy lad 10/0 your sick ha ha
Young Boris Johnson
Civilian training is moving at such a fast pace that the US military can’t keep up. Weapons optics, technology, working out routines and gear. We are obsolete.
I absolutely love paddy. As entertaining as Conor but way more humble and of principal
what a gangster lol
This video is his best so far 👍
How’s that Haaland vs Nunez shout getting on? 🤣
This is pure genius! You're a gem, this makes you look really good and somehow it doesn't even make the Marines look bad. I'm sure it would be a different story of they're lives we're on the line. But it really shows a high level of skill to submit all those guys!
Does this mean we can just send paddy to russia on his own to sort them out ?
Proud that he spent time with my brothers like that
quality...
😂😂😂 “sorry I’m so fat lad “ dudes the best
Fiancé yeaaaaa paddy
the Cameramen is terrible
Paddy saying "sorry I'm so fat lad" whilst being thrown onto some fellas shoulders was class 😂
Paddy's a beast! Grappling is where it's at. If you know the moves you can take anyone out. I don't know the moves 😂
These guys love this shitttt
oi oii
Him saying sorry I’m so fat lad gets me every time😂😂
What’s with the Raider emblem?
Next Paddy heads to roll with some Delta guys or some SEALS....maybe Jocko??? Lol, I love Paddy but I think Jocko turns him into a pretzel..... Paddy has the technique advantage prob, but Jocko has that straight up gorilla strength 🤣
Idk if it’s all just technique or both but paddy seems strongggggg 💪🏼
paddy is such a goat
Proud of you Paddy. Keep pushing forward. Cheering for you always! God Bless
Jajaja wow te Chingaste a toda la clase! Un fuera de serie paddy
Fantastic stuff.
Paddy lost like 10 lbs in this workout
On ya champ , doing heaps for an men's mental health mad respect mate .
Paddy is a lil thick but he looks STRONG, and clearly has a good gas tank. While the Marines may not be as technically trained at BJJ at Paddy u know those guys got tons of heart and determination, and weren't gonna take it easy on him. Loved every minute of this video
Reset? lol, wtf does that mean
He cracked me up apologizing for being a phat phucker lol he cracks me up good luck out there man kick that azz in the octagon.
THEY GOT THIS BOY WORKIN!!!!!
Thanks Paddy for spending time & sharing the importance of men’s mental health with our Marines.  We are huge fans.  Just consider us your Texas family.  We would love to have y’all come to our horse rescue if you are ever in Dallas area.   #PaddyTheBaddy ✌🏼
Paddy’s ji jits Su is legit
say what you like, we have learned today that it takes 1 scouser to take down 10 marines. I think we knew that anyway
good video man
👍
Can't believe how this guy gains and loses weight almost at will. And man, his BJJ skills are awesome 😮
Fuckin heavy that
I love seeing patty in weird physical situations where he’s questioning everything 🤣
Attitude is Everything !!! Paddy The Baddy !!!
Hell yeah Patty!!
Listen.. military is to kill not to submit. Look at the devils brigade... pat o'neill was a real man trained to kill use every tactic to make the other man dead. This is sport.
"I have the balance of a ballerina and the weight of a f*ckin sumo.... I'm a weird lad, a proper weirdo" 🤣🤣🤣🤣 lol Paddys so much fun and this video was great. Shoutout to the Marines too for having Paddy down and doing this
This was a sick vid and really humbling to hear even someone as good as paddy has been threw dark times and came out the other side strong mad respect u u bud
How good is this ... Brilliant Video, what a guy
Great video 💪💪
There'snothing this fella can't do and you can't help but love him for that...go on and rule the world Paddy lad... 🍊
Marines forgot about condit already and went for the grappling ace this time. Much love Paddy, big fan and looking forward to your future fights
Alright now give everybody a gun and see how paddy fairs. Also change it from gym to jungle.
They didn't know ...that wasn't even your final form !!! 😅💪💪💪
Great work Paddy, your story is so inspiring. Keep doing your work.
Loving the content Paddy!
Would love to see you do a collab with an army combatives team as well
Wholesome :)
Sus thumbnail lad
the world loves you paddy
"Sorry mate, I'm a fat bastard!" Then proceeds to tap 10 marines in a row lol. Gotta love Paddy and his sense of humor......this whole video was pure gold!! Shoutout to our US Marines too, they allow people like myself to sleep soundly in my bed!! Respect to all u men and women
Imagine training constantly to be the ultimate soldier & this guy who sleeps like garbage & is eating burgers & pie for every meal just comes in & taps you & your whole crew
What belt is paddy? Looks to be a solid purp
Them military calisthenics workouts are no joke . I ran a fucking 5k with a 20lb vest as a “warmup” then to top it off we had a pull-up/ rope test right after like wtf lol
Great video paddy 👊
i read the title and thought it was some bang bros type of thing 🤣🤣
Class act paddy as a human and a athlete / entertainer I hope he goes to the top and makes as much paper as possible and helps others with the mental Illness etc he’s so down to earth that’s a given coming from Liverpool housing estate’s the people there are some of the most humble and respectful people you would meet  💯 paddy is true to himself and a top lad
Boss episode lad!
He could summit 100 marines and it still won’t be impressive if none of them know jujitsu
Paddy lad they’re American try it with the british ones they’re on another level
Paddy made them look like girl scouts! Well done lad!
1:22 i saw that pad hahahaaaa is rightt
lol -Paddy is literally Dave Portnoy’s food baby
Got my respect
Tapping out 4 MAITs? Paddy got my respect 100%. Badass ✅
Sorry lad im a fat bastard in the air while the guy is struggling was the best part
That was absolute fucking quality… who else is doing this type of content
Fight logan please 🔥
Respekt Paddy
This shows how good paddy actually is 10 men one after the other 😳😳😳😳
Lol the internet made paddy feel so bad about being fat that he’s saying sorry to the marines
Love this you will never see any ufc fighter go here.
This was great 😂😂. Paddy is a legend
Paddy running the fight game yeah ?!
Paddy the Baddy coming
Just absolutely flying through the marines 10-0. Bloke is a machine!!
Attitude is Everything!  You Got Fans Here In Michigan  This was a Great Video Btw Paddy
Paddy is different
Paddy was always like “Sorry I’m so fat.” 😂
Go on paddy. Absolute machine. As well as the marines 👍
You just can't help but like paddy
fake where are the puke buckets :)
Nothing funnier than a US Marine carrying a Brit and Paddy to turn around and say sorry lad I'm fat 😂😂
Goat mentallity! It takes you anywhere you want to.
Now that’s entertainment! Gotta love Paddy!
From one Paddy to another Paddy . Congratulations.  You are an inspiration.  God Bless you always 🙏
Great editing
I like how he apologizes like 5 times about being fat
he’s a pro fighter
Its a joy watching this kid.....how can you not love this guy
Too watch someone open up admit there battles and struggles who’s in the main stream media, Paddy your a legend truly are love to meet you.
Great vid lad …. Them marines worked you hard and you were so giving … tops
Well done paddy showed your class
Paddy, I just want to tell you you're a legend mate. Just started following you, i train muay thai. Got a lot of sh1t going on in my life and you always cheer me up mate so thank you, honestly
Bad ass episode
UK during next war: Send in the Paddy!
Am sweating me lid off lad 🤣
You didn’t just train with some marines! Those are Marsoc Raiders! Definitely equivalent to seals, rangers, and green berets. Dudes are no joke! That’s cool Shit!
Paddy is a beast!!
Make no mistake, those Marines are some bad b@stards that could mess up the majority of people in a combat situation. The fact that Paddy tapped out 10 of them in a row is insane, and just shows the difference between someone very good, and an actual professional. Respect to both Paddy and the Marines.
That start looked heavy
A future champion right here 👊
‘As I said, sorry I so fat lad’ best but
So he knows 3 moves… lol
Definetly need a cheese burger after that lad 👊🤣
Much respect to you Paddy for opening up about mental issues… I was a fan before you came to the UFC and am more of a fan now bc of your humility and stance on mental illness…. Time to get that strap brother!!!!!
Love paddy but unless he learns as a professional athlete you cant keep blowing up in weight, its gonna be a shorter career than it should have.
You are a BEAST
Much respect to Paddy taking in as much of the American culture as he can. Really makes me a bigger fan of the rowdy scouses!
Big respect from a marine here brother, we appreciate you Paddy
“Sorry I’m so fat lad” 😂😭 this guy’s hilarious
Some of these dudes had game...no lie.
Marine: "Just your typical .556" Paddy: "huh?"  I'm dead. Yes, Paddy, .556 is an M-16 round.
Huge Respect to The US Marines and Military 🪖 🎖️ No disrespect I'm losing to a MMA Bad Ass and Grappling Ace like Paddy ,!! Respect Marines n Paddy both BADASSES
Combat soldiers carrying all that gear should not be thinking about rolling around on the ground trying to get submissions, but rather how to stay on their feet, and if they do end up on the ground, how to get back up ASAP.
Super impressed with paddy and how he is getting himself seen on these different levels. He is a real inspirational man and I'm here for all of it!
SOMEONE TAG NIKO ORTIZZ IN THIS!! MAKE HIM REACT TO IT!!!
ooo ooo paddy the fatty..  marra your podcasts are absolute gems. just like you are lad.
Fair play paddy 👏
Finally a proper video to watch without seing him eating
Awesome
Former Arty SSG, and I currently volunteer with veterans dealing with mental health issues. Paddy talking to these guys about mental health is exactly what we need more of. All of us need to be more open in discussing this stuff, and it's so, so powerful coming from a guy like Paddy. God bless Paddy.
That clap 😂
Paddy is a top lad. As a Brit I would like to thank the Americans for all the help offered to Ukraine and the west to preserve democratic values. Thanks America 🇺🇸
“Stalemate” 😆 Sure, Buddy… or perhaps Paddy is just taking a breather.
Got me every time he kept saying sorry I'm a fat bastard 😄 🤣
He fights for entertainment Marines fight to kill & protect the man or woman to the left or right of him or her
Paddy on the guy's back as he does sit stands saying " Sorry mate i am a fat bastard" had me rolling 🤣
Good lad, marines are hard fuckers. Marine Corp martial arts is good too, incorporates alot of stuff.  Raiders are a level above though.
Paddy tapping out marine after marine is one of the most baddest things ive seen in my life damn
"Sorry im so fat" lol
Yut. Too bad he couldn't take a trip to the rifle range
Great video man. Much respect to you and much respect those who protect this country.
nosotros te amamos Paddy.
I burned 500 calories just from watching the video.
As the man said SICK WHOORAAA
Logan and Jake Paul don’t want none of Paddy if they seen this
Outstanding Paddy. Appreciate the time spent with my brothers and sisters. Semper Fi.
Paddy the Baddy!!!
Awesome video bro
This drill speaks volumes about how elite these UFC fighters are. Let's Go Paddy!
Come on, we all want to see Paddy at the Chow Hall doing some REAL damage!
I love how we take the piss out of people we like. A few of my American friends never understood why I would rip them lol
This was so much fun to waych! The content Paddy drops is just golden! Much love from SA 🇿🇦 brother!
I love that you were fat during this. If I didn't know any better I'd think you were retired or done competing
All these Marines heard was:   “Yrghjiigfrfcjiuvft yhggyhvrddioo lad”
Your the first MMA fighter on YouTube I subscribed too
Train with marsoc Patty or go to the marital arts excellency then we got a real fight I’ll yut that ass
to be honest I believe those guys can't hear most of the things he said😂
How can anyone not like this guy??
Paddy finding 20 different ways to call himself fat 🤣. My guy don't worry about it you're barely at average american body fat levels
You can really tell the guy who ask for a reset is a hardass. I love seeing dudes like him get humbled. WOAAAHHH 💯
Dude McMap is the gayest over hyped thing in the military lol. And so are the marines
The marines aren’t tough at all when it comes to fighting. That MCMAP shit is terrible
Awesome!!! More!!!moremore
3:00 😅😅😅😅😅
Killer ep patty !
Paddy apologizing for being a "fat bastard" while I look in the mirror and think, "well what does that make me then." 😆 😆
badass
Keep in mind....this is like a pro boxer doing this. Both pro's in their professional jobs. They all did great. But he's a freak of nature
Paddy ran through those boys like a hot knife through butta'. All the UFC guys do that though when the tough guys want to step up. There are levels to this and you could see how fluid and easy fighters like Paddy make it look. That's how impressive the UFC and its' roster of pure killers is.
Dude, great shit!  Keep it up!  The  QA was the best!
Marines are bad MFers, the fact that paddy was able to go thru the bunch of them, shows how good training and experience is invaluable . 85% of the people in the comments wouldn’t have a chance against one of those marines rolling on the ground. ( not a dog at the ppl in the comments, just saying if you questioned anything about those marines ability, then your trippin ) well done fellas 💪🏻🇺🇸🤜🏻🤛🏻
Not sure how long ago this video was made but paddy looking a little fatty in the vid.
Well in Paddy lad much love ❤ brother. "If your mate doesn't put his arm around you & says what's up lad,but goes am fine look me am good,then there not your mates",well said Paddy!
That was awesome
He doesn't consider himself British but still he is. I do enjoy watching Brits sticking it on the Americans! No disrespect though to our Yankee cousins, they're one and the same like us! 🇬🇧 🤝 🇺🇸
Love ya Paddy!!! Much respect!  And respect to the Marines.      from Alberta, Canada
Awesome video!! Seems like a great training sesh!!!!
People that don't understand why marines are losing against a pro MMA athlete at grappling are idiots and have never grappled. It takes at least 5 years of intense daily grappling training to become proficient in the art...
Fellow scouser yes paddy lad l24
Cracking episode, keep driving that message of positive mental health and people need to talk!
Sorry Lad, I am a fat bastard 😭
Paddy thank you for going and spending time with our Marines. You are the man brother. I can't wait to see you in the octagon again.
They have no idea what he's saying lol
The more I see of Paddy the more I like the guy. So down to earth and likeable. Another great vid!
That was lit 🔥
1:51 let's go Paddy the Fatty!! Lmao much support from the ghettos of the U.S 💪🏼
so when is paddy the baddy getting crowned ? he is next in line for the  throne
the rolling was great, it was like paddy flicked a switch.
this is dope! oorah!!! i’m currently recruiting!
Paddy is a real baddy
Military physical training is so dumb
Paddy is awesome!!
I have balance like a ballerina lad  But I weight like sumo wrestler 😂😂 Top line legend
Great fucking guy!
Go on lad, fucking love how your smashing your career in UFC but at the same time talking about how to help deal with struggling mental health.  You deserve all the success big man 👊
Erreh
Class! 🙌🏻
This video shows how weak the US marines are 😉
Awesome vid
Thoughtful little gift at the end
Sorry lad i'm a fat bastard. You had me fold in half Paddy laughting. Massive support
Paddy is not fat, damn. His face looks a tad chubby, but that man is in good shape. Paddy is a solid lad, this was a great episode.
love this!
Paddy if you keep training like Marines you will be champ in no time!!!!
Great paddy
The level fighters are compare to trained marines... just incredible, those guys are not weakass dudes and they couldnt even do anything to Paddy. Trained fighters are no joke. Might that be a example for every joe blow out there thinking they could take on any of them.
Where was this when I was there lol
You're a really great person, i hope you'll get the belt, always rooting for you!
A man that respects both strength in the physical and mental sense.
Sick vid!
Nice to see my DI getting tapped out by Paddy
Oh dang are these MARSOC guys?
Much respect to paddy keep it real kid
great contrnt
Class this should do this with a rugby team in the UK
Hoorah mad respect to Paddy and our marines, 99.9% of the internet could not have done this. He trained a full weight and cardio session with a platoon of Marines, then sparred AND tapped everyone in the platoon is hard core.!!
One of me favourite episodes yet! Just catching a breather while you had that lad trapped in a triangle had me buckled man 😂 quality mate
These just keep getting better
“Sorry lad I’m a fat bastard” 🤣🤣🤣
Fair play Paddy. What a privilege to visit the marines.
Nice vid Paddy, what a beast.
Great clip Paddy and to all theories that took part...... Wish you all the best in you're career and life....
I’ve been planning to join the marine corp when I get back to states for almost 2 years now and it seems the universe keeps sending me signs with all these marine corp challenge videos that are being uploaded on YouTube
Those marines are tough lads! It looked like a hard day out but well worth it. Good vid.
Marines are sissies these days with the woke culture and these woman in it now..
The whole time he’s apologizing for being fat I’m dead 😂
Top lad!!!
Boss pad ❤
Respect to PADDY,hes becoming the worlds greatest content in person interviewer on all subjects as long as its exhausting,hard,challenging,like ice bath lol.Paddy your UFC will be cut short by the interviews your scoring and its good Paddy.You can swear a little but its bringing to light all kinds of folks from surf to war and food good god lol.Keep it up but dont pack on the lbs,go snowboarding with a champ,scuba,fish for tuna,do it all Paddy and get paid for brains intact not beat about.
Belter lad just sick !
Paddy is Gonna be BUILT like a Gym when his Next Fight comes! Lookin Forward to it no Doubt! 🤙🏼🇺🇸
paddys a good egg thru n thru
the dude carries like 35lb in his face lol
this video makes me dizzy
A Marine at 170lbs is like the average man at 225 lbs except the Marine has stamina and a heart that doesn't break under pressure. You have to kill him before he quits. Good job Paddy! This was very nostalgic for me! Imagine if you incorporated the training of the Marines DAILY!. You could be unstoppable!!!!
Before I even watch this as a Marine we are trained professional gunfighters our MMA training is VERY minimal. It's Guns then bayonets and grenades then knives. If a Marine is in hand to hand combat something went way wrong. Paddy needs to pick up a rifle with simunition rounds and get in a gun fight with an Infantry Marine
That was a killer video man ! 🤘🏽
The marine training was tough for Paddy. He should implement some of that into his routine. It reminds me of folkstyle/collegiate wrestling training. I think this is missing from Paddy's routine and could help him in his climb up the lightweight ranks. This video was awesome.
They gave fatty paddy such a workout that at the end of it he was not fatty but just paddy! 😂🤣😂
respect Paddy getting the respect from the Marines and telling people the most important thing and that is to talk loved this video
Salute big dawg !!! LOVE watching this ...
This video was a fucking banger!! Only thing we needed to see was paddy unload some mags!!
this video shouldve been called '' Sorry im so fat ''
"Sorry lad, I'm a fat bastard" 😂 hella funny.. still a beast tho
Wearing socks on the mat is a big disadvantage. Good on em
Brilliant brilliant brilliant, And what a gift at the end..Well done Paddy..You are an inspiration!!
Paddy is an absolute star
Enjoyed that vid pad la do on with the British marines now haha
Now just imagine if Paddy did this with UK marines. He would have got messed up bad
Paddy us a good guy .
So many apologies for being fat lol 😆
"I dont gife a fuck if you've got seven arms" :D  Paddy the Baddy vs Dr.Octopus at UFC 280 confirmed.
he might get fat but he clearly trains the whole time. no way he could do that if he just sat on the couch eating doughnuts between fights.
they didn't teach him how to tea bag like its modern warfare 2
Paddy constantly apologizing to the people carrying him 😂
had me in stitches this one pad hahah, boss vid
My older Marine brother found out after returning from the Gulf War that even a scrawny high school wrestler and martial artist can really put some hurt in your day. He still talks about getting choked out and tossed across the room 30 years later.😂 Wrestlers and grapplers are monsters to the unknowing. And Paddy is a professional. These guys had no chance without years of training. It was not even fair for them. I'm sure they learned some good moves though. Marines are still above average fighters because they train. Most people have zero skill because they do not train. Respect to all in this video!
sorry im so fat lad lol.
Earning that slice Lad! 💙💙💙
Some people train at high altitude, Paddy trains at high cholesterol
Paddy is an amazing advocate for mental health (especially breaking down stereotypes of men with problems being weak). Dude rolls with 10 marines in a row with 100% success, and within 2 minutes he's talking about times when mental illness made him cry. That type of honesty from such a warrior is how you move society away from prejudice and towards health and growth. I've only recently come across Paddy's content but he just keeps on impressing me.
he's actually a really good teacher, i had no idea
As a purple Belt I cant find words on how Hard it is,to roll with 10 well trained seals in a row and tap them all out. Top Tier pro or not,10 in a row is a freaking demonstration of willpower and skill and all that. Respect.  And obviously respect for the words you speak out. Just golden
I could honestly watch paddy grapple for hours, his back takes are fucking mustard, I got my blue belt under Ivam marciel last year and I wanna keep pushing until I'm anywhere close to the level of fluid like the top guys.
They dont really train them in martial arts like that since they like to get drunk and practice their moves on people at the bar 😆
love seeing what goes on outside of the cage in these videos, absolute legend paddy!
paddy the cant control my weight and cant take fights without 5 months of prep pimblit
Sorry I’m so fat lol
Paddy is on point with the amount of YouTube output he’s doing. He is getting himself so much more exposure. Perfect for creating that bigger name for himself in the UFC
sean o mally wishes he made content like paddy UK's backing your gym my guy (Y)
The more I watch this guy the more I respect him. God bless.
Bro I'm a retired Marine Staff Sergeant, love ya for this one even more! Fucking Paddy THE BADDY!!!
As a Marine I'm stoked for this one. Btw our ground game isnt bad. We have a mixed martial arts program. There was some black belts he tapped 🤪. An instructor Trainor (black belt with 2 red stripes) would have kept up. None there that I saw though.
On your team Brah.
Nice
Hella badass video
He did that while out of shape. Impressive AF!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👍🏼😉 Gd man paddy.
didnt put em in the pit? this was cool to see bull in the ring again
Paddy the Fatty 😆
You got to love this man Paddy is a bad-ass!!!
He looks like this dude I was in with when I was in the corps kaneohe bay oorah 0311 rto  We called him corn bread I am 6 2 and in 1995 at paris island I weighed 154  Got up to 170s low body fat I was good at grappling and close combat skills bit shit was different  Used to give short stocky guys fits for real 77 inch span cardio for days
I love how people don’t notice he’s just has stoned as a Diaz brother that’s how he eats so much look at them 👀
A genuine, proper lad. I'd gladly get pissed with him anytime.
love ur shit lad keep up the great content
Paddy training with rdifferent people is amazing, wheover is making him do this content is a marketing genius.
Literally not one of these guys seemed to be trained in grappling lol and why would they be? They're marines, not BJJ blackbelts - this is like those videos that be like "body builder vs fighter" or s/t where the body builder doesn't train fighting at all so of course he loses
Gotta love the Marines. 🇨🇦
Yes paddy! Doing it for the British lads! Peoples champ 💪🏼🔥
Tapping 20 marines in a row. Technique and skills ftw.
goat
The world needs more paddy and you may not like him but the man's commitment/dedication and vision should motivate anyone to do better ... love from a brummie lad
Somewhere, Molly is laughing her a55 off. Semper Fi Paddy, this is your time lad. Make the most of it.
And Semper Fi
Best video I’ve seen on YouTube for a while.
Yeah p a d d y he is really awesome what a great guy he is very focused and very positive and people don't think he knows what he's doing I got news for them he knows what he's doing
is right paddy lad
Paddy is here to take over
Tapped 10 marines in a row, dude makes grappling look so easy. Can’t even imagine how gassed he was. He’s a monster.💪
I never knew Ed Sheeran did jujitsu
He advocates for mental health and he is a bad man in the ring. My favorite fighter, and the first scouser that I liked ( Man Utd ) fan here. Let’s go Paddy
It's great how much love Paddy gets from the states. McGreggor was enjoyable to watch as it wasn't you he was targeting. And it was funny to see how easily he got under people's skins. But he wasn't really likable.  Paddy has that in spades.
This shit got me so pumped. USMC brother get it Paddy thanks for not forgetting us. We all have families/friends we want to protect so thanks again for your help. This means a lot. I wish I had trained with you. What an honor
if anyone needs someone to talk to just hit me up, i know how tough it is out here and Paddy's videos are a place of solace.
Brilliant video Paddy, really enjoyed that (could have been 20 minutes longer). Love that you are speaking up for men's mental health. You are a superstar!
Don't be sorry for mistakes you did not make.
Let's gooo!!
Nice tap fest, lad! Beautiful work.
all day
Paddy vs Khamzat.
Hhahahah Paddy constantly apologising for being a "fat bastard" is wholesome and hilarious! 😂
locked in a full mounted triangle and has the audacity to call for a stalemate
Keep it up! I just dropped 1 song a week the past 9 months straight. Come along for the ride if you want. Stay blessed !  - Bryan
nice of the marines showing paddy around like that.
Paddy have me in stitches… sorry lad I’m so fat 😂🤣. Paddy you’re a legend man
What an absolute legend.
Stalemate?! 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Errrr....no mate. No.
Paddy is bad ass
My coach is a marine he told me the marines hand to hand combat sucks
Paddy is a fucking diamond
Great Stuff Brother !
The Marines looked 2 stripe white belts at best 👌
When did you go to MCMAP? I wish I was around when you came through.
Outstanding!
We need more of you
Good stuff Paddy, you're becoming a real fan favorite. Keeping it real makes things so much more relatable. Best of luck lad.
"Sorry I'm a fat bastard". Aww, Paddy. What a workout ehh?
Class video by a class lad 👌🏽🙌🏽
I haven’t trained in 9 years. I’ll spar with you looks fun
Paddy, I saw those squats you weren’t hitting parallel mate. I know you did squats yesterday but no excuses! 😜
This foos a legend 😂😂
Shouldn't make cheesy  films every 2 mins making out your tough as fuck then. Us Brits just crack on doing the job without the government/Hollywood having to rim us to the world.
Sorry I'm so fat lmao
1:22 paddy doing the sit up and giving the finger has me pissin rn😂😂😂
The best part is all his apologies for being a fat bastard 🤣
Well in lad honesty you lasted twice as long as I thought you would
Him apologizing for being fat to everybody was making me crack up lol
How in the bloody hell did paddy even take on that many marines after a workout like that. What a beast!
Well done Paddy. Funiest thing was..... sorry i m so fat lad. OmG love it
Gwaaarrn lad
Great video ..subscribed on the strength of that 👍
Great watch. It's a clear standard of how effective and important ju jitsu is
Bro you are one of the few persons i look for in my life... Keep doing good mate and you are like my elder brother..🥊❤️
Paddy a born beast with immense ring intelligence!!! A legjobbak legjobbja!!!
WE LOVE THEM FATTY CHEEKS PADDY THE FADDY GET THAT TITLE MY G
Love seeing your rise Paddy, smash on lad
This was just awesome 🇺🇸
Considering how many times he said he was fat, I'm surprised he didn't refer to himself as "Paddy the fatty" (though tbh, he isn't fat...just oversized for his division. When I trained in MMA, 200lb was the normal weight for the guys who fought at welterweight.
I'm sure Paddy would agree that just cause he tapped out all these marines that they still are heros and supermen. Much respect for Paddy doing this he looks like he ate his former self it had to have been hard to roll in his condition lol
Lol paddie good ep. Subbed
So if a tired chubby paddy can tap 10 marines ...what could a fresh paddy do after a full camp 🤔🤔🤔🤔  Have to say though the marines ran rings around him in the circuit 😂
This was clearly a whole lot of fun for everyone involved,just FUN,it’s a shame that people in the comments have to make a meal out of everything while trying to turn a positive into something negative,it’s a shame the way this shitty world is heading,respect to paddy and every serviceman in the world,,love from the uk 🇬🇧
Weird that people don’t know that the people who fight in the UFC are pretty much the elite fighters of the world
Great video how your not at 1mill yet blows my mind most real str8 up vids on YouTube
A marine is trained to kill not to try and make someone tap and let them go a marine is trained to kill your opponent on the battle field a marine is gonna let his arm get broken so he can wiggle to reach his combat knife and gut his opoonent a marine is like a ninja with there weapons they are unstoppable if paddy wants a good challenge he should grapple with navy seals or army rangers I've seen a navy seal dislocate someone's arm with his chest in the battle field I don't got time to grapple you'll get shot up marines are the first line of infantry so they are trained more tactical then hand to hand combat there hand to hand combat trianing is using a combat knife Paddy profession is working about punches and knockouts Marines job is to worrying about bullets and kill no questions asked
This weight fluctuation and not living a "clean" lifestyle will catch up eventually. It's a shame because this guy could be even better if he were more focused on his condition between fights. Before anyone starts screeching, I'm NOT hating. I'm just acknowledging reality. I feel like his career will not last as long as it could/should because of this. Nothing wrong with living life and enjoying it, I'm just saying in the context of the sport that he participates in this kind of stuff will catch up with you eventually.
Sick video lad, you’re smashing the ufc and youtube. Big up the baddy.
More I watch Paddy the Baddy, the more I like him.
Mana grappling is insane and we literally never see it in the octagon
Just your typical 5.56. Paddy "aww man I was hoping it was something cool... That being said, what the fuck is 5.56?!" Haha. It's the main round used, Paddy. That's what they shoot out of their M4 (AR15 in civilian world, but with some spicier capabilities.) Cool video, Paddy. You're lucky you didn't do a hike with them. That being said, where was the Corpsman at watching you fools?
Your the best bro keep it up brother I needed to hear this!!! Your a fuc***g Warrior!!
Sorry I'm so fat... hahahaha that's gold.
You have the best channel out of all the fighters. It’s genuinely entertaining every time. Go Paddy!
Would have liked to see him grapple with a red tab
I ate two big slices of pizza while watching this, lad!
As a fat American, I loved watching a British MMA fighter apologize to a bunch of Americans for being fat 😂😂😂
Good stuff. Paddy is a good representative of mma. Except the getting fat between fights part lol.
this is sick tbh lad, proper warrior
Paddy is an animal. Nice Vid.🫡🇳🇱
For all those @$$ clowns on the street, go mess with a Marine, see how it works out for you.
Paddy could open his own gym and be a trainer.  Impressed.
Paddy’s a much better grappling coach than I expected. Should definitely own a training gym later in life after UFC.
I had to hit subscribe after seeing this.
Paddy and Bear Grylls together one day will be fire🔥🔥🙌🏽🙏🏽
"Sorry I'm so fat".  Lol
Cool dude👋🏻
Never seen a professional athlete complain about working out more than Paddy does.
Coolest vid to date! 👏👏👏
belter
King Paddy
Great talk padd listen to him it’s the hardest thing you will do talk but there’s so much help out there being a man pride these are all bo..ocks when it comes to mental health find someone you can confide in and talk it doesn’t make you any less off a person than the next
You think Tony Ferguson should retire after last night's fight with Diaz?
Yo I love how paddy keeps apologizing for being fat 😂😂😂 fucking hilarious
There’s no way they understood a word he fkn said man!😂😂😂
Outstanding
Hell ya Paddy
This paddy dude is likeable.
I'm 50 years old a friend's 20 year old son came to me asking for help dealing with depression he came because he heard Paddy the baddy said it's ok to talk. Thank you Paddy I got the lad training with me 3 times a week and we'll on the mend that makes you champion to me already ☮️
Lol he literally apologize to everybody for being fat
I'm surprised they didn't ask to see his trademark flying triangle lol
Respect paddy this video really turned me into a fan. It really shows the difference between a professional and  a novice with both side being very fit and strong. Only difference is skill 💪
I think it shows a great deal of disrespect when he admits to be sleeping very little and then looking tired and not going in 100%.
Lol love how the one guy tries to put him in rubber guard.
Paddy's my fav human right now.
Just look out for the black-belts with red stripes.
Love you paddy. Thanks for opening up to all of us. For me it was very significant that you did that and has helped me tremendously. Best wishes man
Paddy's the baddie. 😂😂👍❤️
Marine : Stalemate , reset ? Paddy : Haha i think not
Absolutely love paddy the baddy massive fan, such a genuine real man, for a man to open up about crying to himself speaks volumes ❤️ all the best brother for the future i am with you 👌
Paddy is an absolute unit. Top class grappling.
Paddy kinda looks like Owen Hart.
“I’m sorry i’m so fat lad” wow! Lol great episode!
Paddy, can't say enough for that video. Your words of wisdom was on point of men talking more. It's really a hard thing to do but it's truth. Pretty cool you spent time with these Marines an showing them what you do. We need more inspirational men like you to be around. Great job man!
Really enjoyed watching that lad! great video.
I love how he is so open about his mental health woes. We need more men in these type of positions to be open about such things. It helps.
Personally I think Paddy the fatty is wayyy better than paddy the baddy. Fat paddy is funnier
Paddy the king
When they were like 5 lads in all tapped, I'm pretty sure most of them knew what was up.
I’m a man dying of Cancer. Damn Son you make me laugh. I enjoy you in all your crazy glory.
If Paddy did that to Airforce, he never would have made it past the 2nd airman.👀https://www.youtube.com/s/gaming/emoji/7ff574f2/emoji_u1f923.png
Vem fazer essa sessão de jiu-jstsu aqui com os fuzileiros brasileiros, garanto que não vai ser tão fácil!
The guy really said "stalemate?" 😂😂
Great grappler, and I love his human side! God bless you mate! God bless the Marine cores!
Just a fat paddy casually tapping out a marine unit after being put through a brutal workout
God damn Patty's a wrecking ball I train jiu jitsu and I am a blue belt we definitely go hard but Patty's on another level
WORLD CLASS BJJ!!!
Sorry lad I’m a fat bastard 😂😂😂😂
He just 11-0'd 11 different grown, in shape men like it was nothing .. back to back to back too. That was dope.
Well done Paddy! Your channel and presentiing just gets better and better, plus your confidence really comes across. If part of this traiining got you knackered then it might be worth considering incorporating part of it into your routiine stuff! Nice one mate!
Brilliant paddy what a man. Also the marines where class
Paddy your channel here is such a fantastic channel to watch all your great interviews ,adventures and training are really entertaining .Best of all you inspire a lot of people in this world.
What wit the marine at beginning rubbing patties dik sayin whooooooo
Angloshpere
Uk showed them marines wag1
Goddamn paddy the baddy back at it again!!✊🏽 this is my motivation to work harder in the gym lol
His face totally got skinnier by the end of the video🤣
I think a lot more men especially military personnel should be talked to like this from someone they respect who tells them as men it's OK to speak, respect to paddy for fighting the good fight
Paddy is the best !!!
Shame you didn't train with Marines who train combatives/martial arts outside of their typical MCMAP. Marine corps martial arts is only good against drunk people. I was a brown belt and it was a joke. Train with some SF guys or head over to 1st MRB and roll with folks who train independently.
Putting this out on 9/11. Much respect
we fuckin love u paddy
You da man Paddy. Great podcast and a great person you are 👊
Paddy's still in great shape at all times, even though his face blows up from pigging out.
Paddy, you are the official ' He-man!!!!
paddy the fatty tapping out fit marines imagine if he was at peak physical conditions
OO RA!!!! Nice one Patrick.  Another belter……..thanks mate 💪🏻👏🏻👏🏻🔥🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
Ground games impressive
I have more and more respect for paddy the more I watch him. Definitely motivates me to train and do better. I genuinely believe he could make a statement in the division in the years to come. Well done, lad. I'm rooting for ya.
This is the most wholesome Video Ive watched In a while. Just what we needed today paddy. Those marines def needed it. Had them crackin up smiling. They will remember you and your words to them. We have a serious mental health issue in america and its even worse in the military. Love that its something you share about! Awesome content big fan.
Legend
If Marines trained MCMAP as much as they get drunk, Paddy would have been in trouble.
Paddy is awesome man. Such a cool dude.
Nickname well earned 👏
It's really crazy how all his weight goes to his face 😂 I'm still amazed. Bc neck done you'd think this was someone that's in shape. But neck up he looks like a Fatboy.
I think Paddy lost 15 pounds by the end of the video.
Just your typical 5.56 😆 only American can say that. In Europe only in our wet dreams.
Feelgod ent. 🇳🇴🇳🇴
Seal Team 6? We shoulda just sent in Paddy
Awesome video mate. Genuine people fit in everywhere. 👍🏻
That was a really cool video mate! 👊👍
Where are all the college wrestlers at? Thought everyone in the US had grappling skills from a young age 😜
🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Not him apologizing everytime someone had to lift him 🤣 haha love you Paddy!
wait, i forgot to 🖕😂😂
They say equality doesn't exist. You're right. These Pogs.... Buddy carry? I didn't see that wook hottie carry paddy's fatass across the asphalt lol.   All jokes aside, nice of you to come out.
Paddy killing it, and the whole time apologizes for being "a fat cunt" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 how can you not like him? 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Can be an annoying twat at times 😂 in all honesty can't do anything but show love and support.
Everything about this is amazing.
Paddy the world wants to see you fight Nate Diaz
Your post fight speech after losing your friend prompted me to ring my son and make it crystal clear to him that for as long as I'm alive, he is never alone and can talk to me about anything that's on his mind. This prompted a long chat where he said that seeing people like Paddy and Tyson Fury talking about mental health and how it is not weak to talk to other people if struggling is allowing other young men to open up to each other and support one another. Vitally important that we all support our friends and family members by simply telling them we want to talk, not attend their funeral.
Paddy apologising for bein fat is hilarious
10-0….LAD💥💥💥
Paddy making Britain great again!
I have the most respect for Paddy the baddy, a true inspiration. love from Portugal.
"Sorry I'm so fat" lmao
BROOO THATS HERE 9TH COMM IS WHERE I WORK AT THATS 5 MINUTE WALK FROM MY BARRACKS I COULDA SEEN HIM 😭
Lmao. Why is he apologizing for being fat?
These are "Marines" there's Different Ranks, Divisions, and Squads of Military.  Now if He was to Make a Certain Percentage of Any "Special Ops" Tap Out. That would raise Concern.
I’m getting a little burnt out on how much Paddy content there seems to be lately.
Nobody should Expect a Marine, or even Special Forces Operator, to Roll, with a Pro fighter, and not get Submitted very very Quickly? Just like Paddy couldn't take Down, a houseful of Armed Terrorists, with Hostages, in seconds? That's What he Does, and That's What They Do, that's why they're called Pro's PS great vid👍🏽
In all fairness Oaddy should have worn the same trousers. #advantage
i love paddy man he really has good energy and has defo saved at least a life
Earned a new fan!!!He legit sold me when he went ham on the marine workout without preparing and also entered sore from putting in work all weekb. THEN TAPping out everyone 🔥
cool
That was fantastic, man. My dad was in the Marines, but I know he never had Basic Training like this.
A 15 minute sparring session with this guy would be a dream come true, gotta love his personality.. didn't know he existed a few months ago... now Paddy the Baddy is my new GSP. Much love brother, keep up your epicness!
Is Paddy a bit fatter..? And despite this ...took everyone out despite the training beforehand?
I love how sad Paddy looked when he was holding that pad. Hilarious.
Paddy lad your the best of the best. Your not afraid to put the hard work and sweat in and come out with the rewards. Hard earned. True peoples champion 🏆 🥇.  Huyton Huyton 2 dogs a fighting.
What a legend!
Dude what did we just see a fat guy take out 10 marines??
yes lad! would you try doing UK marines? the US are beasts and have super different mind set to regular people and so do english marnies, think english marines or any regirment would be class! keep up the vids lad gassed to see em!!!!!!
that's some british Ip Man moments lol
Great content! See if you can get some free drinks with that challenge coin lol
"sorry I'm so fat" is my new catchphrase 🥲
Paddy The Mother Fucking Baddy  Is An Absolute Animal.. Hands Down My Favorite MMA Fighter of All Time..  Dude is A Legend in the Making..  Hopefully I’ll Be Able to Meet you One Day..
Paddy a legend 💯
So jiu Jitsu is all submissions?
bro, this dude is funny 🤣🤣🤣
Never underestimate a fat guy in a fight just look up Butterbean that dude was fat as hell and would knock out people so fast in the boxing ring the fans would sometimes get mad because the match didn't last long enough...
Fucking class
You should come to the East coast as well to camp Lejeune
Better not lose Paddy
He had me at "proper chubby cheeks"
Very Very Very late in the UFC scene, Paddy is truly the first MMA Fighter that I truly like. Great Videos and I love his love for food.
paddy constantly apologizing for being fat was so pure 😂
Is Ricky hatton your daddy paddy
Paddy the baddy… enough said 👌🏻
“Sorry I’m so fat Lad” 😂😂 cracks me up
Good Luck from Italy ❤️ you have a good heart 👍you deserve the best 👊
the fact that paddy loses 50 pounds for a fight is actually scary
Class that Paddy
The thumbnail kinda looks like Rodney from only fools and horses
7 arms hahahaha!
National treasure lad oioi
What a genuine bloke Paddy the baddy is a good human.
Got to love Paddy what a guy. Love what you stand for such a sound soul. Sort of person you want as a very good friend.
3:00
So, Khamzat at 185?
"Believe In Yourself Whole-Heartedly" "Attitude Is Everything." Great Concepts.
good shit my dude!
Sweat-angels:D
I nearly lost a tear, this vid was SICK😜
What a GREAT Vid !  I'm sure every Marine there wanted to roll with Paddy on the jujitsu mat. I wouldn't expect the Marines to tap Paddy out. He is a  top tier MMA Fighter fighting by the   Rules   of the match.  How would Paddy fare in a night combat operation against Marines or a Marine ? It was good to see the Q&A circle with the Marines, Paddy did Good.
That was really great for all of us to witness the level
As a former US Marine I already suspected the Marines would lose easily, the belts we earn through MCMAP is more of a flex than a testament of skill and it's also split between physical combat and weapon training.
Dude your middle finger got the best workout! Flip that bird 25 minutes easy! :)
This is the first time ive ever seen this man other than from pictures and ive got to say i like the guy
That last tap was dope with the twister
Great watch this one . Paddy is a machine
Paddy and not eating in a video? Woooooooow LOL Great stuff this!
Younger than me and already a champion of men's mental health. What's my excuse?
Real MAN!!!
I'm starting to like this guy
Semper Fi marines
what an awesom lad he is
Gordon Ryan enters the chat.
Paddy we love you
Great Video!🤣👌👍
The Marines needed subtitles!!!!🤣🤣 What's this Lad saying??!!  Paddy the Legend as usual!!!
PADDY YPUR THE DOPEST, ABSOLUTELY LOVEEE THE CONTENT, please post more workout videos like this same intensity its real motivational and entertaining, appreciate you giving the USMC YOUR TIMEEE AND HAVE A BLESSED DAYY 💪🏽🙌🏽💙
I’m surprised the marines understood what he was saying.
Paddy I love you brother. Your jujitsu is on another level lad. Been watching you since cage warriors and you’re doing us all proud mate. Keep going
Absolutely luv this lad so humble such an inspiration to everyone to follow you're dream and give it everything at every moment...... some strong words about mental health everyone take them in ......
still tho life or death situation cqc all hands 1 at a time and paddy takes out 10 marines in one sitting that's crazy. I guess the real test would be like some green berets or seals or spetsnaz
3:02..... sorry i'm so fat lad 😂😂
Apologising for being fat haaa funny
This is why he can lose and will still be a super star.
Any one notice that marine raiders banner  Eeee 😬 beasts
paddy when's the ice cream competition with Paulo costa!!
Dang great vid shout out to the camera guy great work and the editing was phenomenal
Love how humble he is!
I Love Paddy because he is a real one.  Not a fake influencer
So awesome!!!
In football practice, I would have been fined for wearing a watch as it can seriously injure someone when you come into contact with them. Paddy wearing a watch in Jiu Jitsu.... SMH. I notice he took it off half way through. Hopefully didnt injure anyone with it. Always do sports with no jewellery to avoid injuring others ppl.
"During its history, the United Kingdom's forces have invaded, had some control over or fought conflicts in 171 of the world's 193 countries". Spread love not war.
That was brilliant.
Paddy swing by LA on your way so I can come see you
Paddy your a ledge balls lar..
i would just like to say, im sorry im so fat man
Dope
Paddy the fatty 🤣🍔
Honestly thought the marines were going to give paddy a hard time but this dude ragdolling them lmao paddy got more of my respect now
Love the apologies for being fat lol paddy u legend 👊🏻
thx for the great content brother . its not usual and easy i guess to do and try to combine this videos with ur daily prep for fight n everything. my english is not that good but good job to u and ur team. very entertaining but respectfull person ..
Khamzat vs Paddy let’s go
Is it just me or at 7:20 was that marine trying to to, "grapple" paddy's junk?...
Love the video And your words so true
hey paddy so awesome training  with some badass marine! Semper Fidelis brothers!!!!
Why would I want Bacon or Sausage? I want Bacon AND Sausage.
Paddy apologizing to that guy for being so fat is hilarious
Whoever edtis these videos needs a raise
Just because I beat up 5 marines at the taco bell  doesn't mean I'm not sensitive...damn man 😤
One of his hardest workouts this week...
No female marines wanted a go?
Him and Sean O'Malley need to fight each other. "Battle of the can-crushers."
Patty the faddy
any body wants to see the power of ju jitsu they should show them this video marines back to back tapped out like nothing 😂
Tapping marines out and that submissions are unreal wanna see a finish in the first minute in your next fight pad
That would be fun to do practice with paddy would be awesome learn a few things and laugh my ass of because your  just pure awesome
The sporting world needs more paddy's, you always see celebrities turning up shaking hands. Not getting at it like this. Great content
True man of the people!
Jui Jitsu is great as long as there are two people alone in the forest. As soon as there is a third person, going to the ground on your back is a horrible strategy.
If Marines were ever to engage with an Army of pure MMA fighters at Paddy's skill level in close quarters, no weapon... absolutely they'd get destroyed but 99.99999999% of any wars or battles are never like that and Marines will almost always win in everything else. Goes without saying. lol. IDK why that has to be said but common sense ain't everyone's forte lol. Paddy is a beast and he shows it here. Marines ain't hard to take down even in close quarters
Paddy is such a beast. Love to see you give the military some screen time to. People should see how they train. Bet he sheds some of that weight to.
YESSS lad 10-0 boom💪🏻🇬🇧🍻😂😂
i work at camp pendleton (navy) sucks i missed you , we train mma at the fight gym on base
Paddy you need to do more of these videos. Like how many royal marines you can tap. How many rugby players you can tap. How many nfl. So on so on. Really enjoyed this
the way paddy kept apologizing to the guy carrying him😂
Always makes me laugh when I see idiots online say navy seals marines sas whoever could beat up mma fighters, this is the reality
sorry lad im a fat basted... LMAO
Great video m8! Cheers from Croatia!
Man like padddddyyyyyy!!!!!!
Craziest part after doing all that circuit. he’s tapping out a guy at #10 who’s fresh. he’s 9 marines in & still top of his game..   A lot of People laugh at his comparison to McGregor not just as a star also fighting wise but paddy at 28 is already better on the ground than Conor was or will ever be. he keeps improving his all around game the sky is the limit.   the fact he went to my school & a fellow scouser makes me want his success to be even greater! 💙
This was outstanding Paddy is the Baddy!!
Sigg
This is bullshit fake news stupid ass media!!!  These are NOT division Marines three are office bitches and chicken heads. Go to roll with 5th Marines or up in Horno. He was probably too scared to go into grunt territory
Animal
It's such a pleasure watching you interact with every community you can. Your words, your outlook on life always leaves me balling and wanting to continue building my support system up. Thank you, you bloddy legend
Sorry im so fat  Nah , you re good  Lmfao😂😂😂
I'm diggin the Sunday video drops!!
Fuck Paddy ..you're gonna be world champion
i was in the british army myself, i never conducted any mixed martial arts training but we did do cardio work on the bags doing kicks punches etc, all i know is military training is tough but imagine doing it with no sleep.
I love you paddy  xxxxx
Paddys a scouser that why hes so tough! YNWA Paddy✌️.
This was awesome.
Absolutely beast ! 🫡
Love this. So wholesome. "Sorry I'm so fat lad"
You get it, great video
Awesome video
I like Patty the body He's a good kid wish him the best
Banging episode
Paddy you inspire so many of us veterans everyday. Just want to say we all love you brother and mental health is real
That was YUGE‼️ I knew they’d love ya ..
Keep up the good work Paddy,  greetz from Holland.
Love your self deprecating humor Paddy😅😂
Damn 10 in a row
absolute  gigachad
Fucking awesome seeing you train like this paddy, insane of a workout, good q&a at the end
I'm a fat bastard lad
Paddy vs Nganou 2025
Love the guy. Great attitude! And he said it like it is.
Should of shot some guns
Sorry I'm so fat haha. Love paddy
Nice one pad. Your a good lad honest n true :) and mate drop Ngannou on his head haha. Paddy the mutha fuckin baddy lol.
Good looking Marines. Tip of the sword.
As a Army Veteran paddy has got my respect and has made me a fan. To roll and tap with 10 guys in shape after a killer workout holy shit stay hard fellas.
Man send him to 0311 or recon,  not a Pogue unit
Lot of respect for each other’s jobs goin on here, great vid 🤘🇬🇧
Paddy can I train with you when I came to Uk😊
Judging by the Skull Flag at 1:43 these are Marine Raiders?
this video needs to be shown to all the people that think they could beat certain UFC fighters with ease😂
Wasn't fair at all. Paddy has at least 100 pounds on all these guy and he's in super saiyan form the whole time with that yellow hair
What a likable guy…  Keep doing what you’re doing Paddy.
He's wasting his time at 155lbs. He would fair much better at 170lbs. The competition isn't as fierce and his fat ass won't have to cut half the weight
Awesome video!!! The man walks the walk.........
Paddy is Genuinely funny
Great video Paddy
Amazing Pad! You're such an inspiration! I'm releasing a new song & music video on Friday & it uses your speech at the beginning! I would love for you to hear it! Thanks for being a real one!
His manager saying “ as long as you don’t hurt yourself right!?” 😂
Wow ,soo good,best thing I've watched for ages wish it was longer ,tho im sure that's easier for me to say,excellent,army and ufc at same time,great episode this,thanks
...Music>https://youtu.be/2338saoThiQ
"sorry lad , I'm fat" 🤣
Great video and what a work out!  Appreciate the Marines and appreciate Paddy investing that time with them
Paddy looks like he can fight at 170
Just goes to show how important ground work is if you want to survive.
"as i say sorry am so fat lad" whilst getting carried hahahaha had me rolling lar proper scouse thing to say ahah seeing you grapple with them marines was amazing lad massive respect
Go on paddy lad, you showed the yanks how it's done  ✔️
Great video! And editing!
👍🏻👏
Paddy is def gonna blow up on youtube with content like this
"sorry I'm so fat" 😂😂😂 "I have to say sorry I'm so fat"  "nah your good" 😂😂 lmaooo  paddy funny AF without even trying he really was sorry 😂😂😂😂
And they all tapped. Not ONE was prepared to nap.💤💤 I use the think paddy was a tit. But now I have so much respect for him, and think he's brand new💯
phone brightness 100% rip battery
No joke.  As he is a pro athlete,  and even more a pro fighter,  he had already put workouts in immediately prior n o doubt.
Sikh
Smashed it !!!
That’s respect
Very impressed with paddy’s ground game, tapped the last dude with straight shoulder pressure, not even a fully locked head in arm. I’d like to see him fight a top 15 guy next.
My brother is a Marine and he was station
Now you've said it paddy, Francis Ngannau next fight :D ! Man that would rock the whole world lol
Belter of a vid that Paddy lad !!!!
You are such a great guy, and even as a big United-supporter I will always support you and Molly (yeah - I know you hate us);))
this s fucking great.. more of this !!!
“Stalemate, reset” while 200 lb paddy is sitting on his neck with his sweaty cheeks ahaha
I love this guy.  Paddy kick ass.  Spineless american marines. Only a coward sheep would fight for any country.  It's evil government use these guys as puppets.  Brainwashed American pride.   Spineless really.
What a great bunch of lads.
Paddy the chowhall champion 🏆
They probably understood about 20 percent of what paddy said, 😆
As a Marine Corps vet I really enjoyed seeing Marines getting served a piece of humble pie 😂 but I laughed hysterically at the challenge coin. The coin is usually given with a hand shake and you just took it 😂😂
Give him a cookie but It wasn't fair. He looks fifty pounds heavier than anybody else.
I'm going through a really rough time mentally right now and hearing him talk about mental health is powerful! I never want to talk to people, guess I don't want to seem weak, I always think with enough time in my own head I can figure it out but I think I'm going to talk to someone. Thank you Paddy you are a legend🙏
Sorry Lad, I’m a fat bastard 😂😂💪🏻
Dope content right here
I love how whenever someone picks him up he apologizes fer being fat lmao
amazing content!
This was completely beast.
One of the dudes he was talking with at the begging used to be my old drill instructor 😂 small world
6:11 I was impressed how this marine protected his back he definitely has potential in Jiu Jiu Jitsu
Would love to see this with the British Marines... the most elite fighting force in the world... the US lot can’t hold a candle to the British Marines. Forget the hype and faux-Patriotism, the US do training exercises over here with the UK guys so they can be toughened up and shown how it’s really done. Get down to Lympstone and have a go Paddy!
nice one  Bro
That looks fun
Great video, they beasted him then tried to take him down. Clever but it didn't work. OOORAH
Sorry lad Im a fat bastard 🤣
The part that sood out to me the most was how genuine he is / during the Q&A .. talking about speaking out and dark time in his life to a group of marine's shows his true Character . although I was a fan before I am a lifelong one now .. I don't want to ever see him compared to Conor ever again .
You’re already a YouTube legend!!
Paddy is a UFC fighter i enjoy in or out the ring a Great person !
2:19 i see he is testing his chin aswell ;D
paddy looks skinnier by the end of the video
Love this b4 I've seen it still a beast paddy 💪 show the word lad  One cool cat
Boss lad
I can’t help but like this guy.
Awesome video
As I say, sorry I'm so fat 🤣🤣
Thats some cool shit paddy 🔥👏✌️♥️
Awesome video man!
what a g
Paddy will be fighting with the big boys soon he can go all the way never see a poor day again till he gets the Lecky bill
Paddy the guy much respect lad keep doing what your doing
😂😂😂😂😂 you can tell he is NOT having fun👍👍😂😂
The thing that really made me a Paddy Pimblett fan was his attitude. The guy is real. Doesn't pretend to be invincible. Doesn't only show footage of himself being an absolute stud. He literally laughs at himself and isn't afraid to show he's human. That's what real confidence is. Go On, Paddy!
Respect this paddy great video  how many marines can u Take down & thus hardcore impressive paddy  Great ur pushing the mental side
That's freakin awesome our British brother is over here working out our Marines.  He looked fat in the beginning of the video then after tapping out 10 Marines he looked yoked ASF....😆😆🤣🤣
GOD BLESS our Marine Corps and Long live PADDY THE BADDY
Great video💪🏻👍🏻 paddy

Sick that
Lol sorry I’m so fat lad ☠️🤣
Love Paddy the Baddy Pimplett
Fun vid.thanks Paddy.
Paddy the Babyy🍼🥰
Great content
Respect paddy
Constantly apologizing about being chunky  😂😂
I know that look on Paddy. His body is just drained & tired before the workout even started and it never goes away
Paddy is the man 💯🔥
Lol his chubby cheeks and grown out blonde hair makes him so cute ☺️ lol
10 nil go on Paddy lad 🤙
Rolled with 10 Marines in a row and won. That's pretty fucking impressive some of those Marines were in pretty solid shape and this wasn't even a fight shape ready Paddy.
The way he keeps apologizing cause he’s fat😂😂😂😂
Very impressive
It’s like when I roll with my coach he pretty much is sleeping and beating my ass 😂
Funniest shit is when they carry him and he apologizes 😂😂😂
Man makes me smile ear to ear great vlog loved every second of it
Do that everyday before breakfast
Haha this guy is awesome
I really hope that this channel helps me to understand Paddy’s accent better and get used to it lol
'Sorry lad I'm a fat bastard😂'
insane. and so nice with the little attitude board with the singing of everyone. paddy for real is becoming a legend.
lol the pad hit him in the chin..
"As I say, sorry I'm so fat, lad" LOL
Paddy the Faddy
Did Paddy just beat up the whole American army? Lol
Loveable Scouse rogue isn’t he. Hard not to like him and I’m a manc👍
Really liked this one! Thanks Paddy!
Paddy we need to get you a functional strength coach and you’ll be unstoppable mate, Brandon Harris who owns Premier Fitness Systems is a good choice he’s in Scottsdale, Arizona, trains O’Malley and a bunch of other professional athletes
Good work Paddy! A real genuine felllow!
From seeing you in Cage Warriors back in 2012, and even randomly seeing you on Bold Street or Berry Street to now watching you experience what most people would never get to do is amazing, a self made. salt of the earth lad, I wish you all the best and hopefully you will never change.  Also the rolling session was amazing, some big lads in there too, I know these guys are not MMA fighters, but an out of shape Paddy taking out 10 Marines is fucking ridiculous.  Finally, the lads in the video were  great, they really seemed to appreciate the experience, and vice versa, great content.
I appreciate paddy wants to eat shite his choice but personally when you allow long enough time to pass not eating shite. You feel like I don’t wanna eat shite because if I do I’ll feel shite. So why would I eat shite? 🤷‍♂️
Paddy is the man 👍
Jeez look like you lost a stone by the end of the video they worked you hard.
carrying that much weight n still bossing it.. whatever happens or how his career playes out, he's gonna do damage.. people are people though at the end of day.. if he likes his scan n he's still cleaning oponets out then it's working.. then who are we to judge.. scary to think,  if he was pure obsessed with weight n nothing out side the sport how good he'd actually be.. but if it ain't Broke don't fix it lad.. stay a scouser n don't get drowned by all the bollocks.. top lad! from a Manc! 🤣 ✌️
Paddy is the man. Thank you from the states English brother.
Great episode man.
Loves this lad, think big, he’s the next worlds best
Manager cares, cutting starts now
That is a sick video
This a true champion. Win or lose. Paddy is a rare fighter
like Khabib said, go sleep. you are Marines. #McTappers
very reassuring to see our military putting in that work too. you hear a lot about the pronoun shit the military is pushing. glad the marines dont play that shit though
That was nice 😆 🤣
Paddy showing you that there's levels to this grappling shit
You gotta love him man 😂👊🏾
Liked before watching..all the best from germany

Thanks. Watching a Liverpool badass talk shit on Marines is funny.
Semper Fi, Lad. Welcome to the Suck.
The fact that he took on 10 marines wrestling and unfit shows how tough ufc fighters really are

You know those Marines would rather die than tap but they wouldn't want Paddy to look like a murderer on camera. Hahaha 😂😂😂 Marine brain: I've had a good life ain't no way I'm tapping. I'll just die. Wait that would be a bad look for Paddy. Yeah I'll tap." 😂😂😂
Oh Paddy the baddy!
Sent this bud to all the homies
👍👍👍
Best video ever
I just got finger burn again.
Soldiers always make me tired watching them grapple

MaN!! i just love this young man ❤️ i think he brings a good spirit to the game of fighting.....good Heart 💜 good fighter with the right mentality....... groundbreaking young man in the hardest and most exciting sport in the world 🌎‼️‼️‼️ wish you the best brother ❤️💪🥊🥊
Paddy apologising for being fat is so freaking funny.
Ofcoatce the gym is full of E5s in the middle of the day 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I'm glad we're treating Paddy well here in the states. Lol
Wish u the best on ur come up.
Paddy looked so much thinner by the end of the video 😂😂

Paddy gotta work off all that Jamba Juice and In and Out. Lol.
Good shite
The way he clapped after he was done with the workout ☠️ gem
i like how you re a fucking athlete but alway complain about practicing 🤣
“Sorry lad I’m a fat bastard”😂
Fighting 10 Marines in a row. That is Gladiator shit.
"Sorry lad, I'm a fat fuck" 🤣🤣🤣
Paddy going through ten try hard marines is one of the sickest things I’ve ever seen
"Sorry I'm so fat lad" lol
That clap was hilarious
Love this kid.
I didn’t know what to think of Paddy before I saw this.  But he is alright in my book.  Better than alright to be honest.  Got a head on your shoulders kid.  I wish you well.
Paddy 10 USMC 0
Marines, their diet is crayons and lots of alcohol,RANGERS LEAD THE WAY
Paddy taking the bisping route. Soon he will live full time in the US, and will be called out by British fighters for not fighting out of England
Wow great video
Well done and well said Paddy! Thank you so much for speaking out about depression!
“Sorry I’m so fat lad” while some dude is carrying you is golden 🤣😭
"sorry i'm so fat" while the marine carries him lmao
SemperFi paddy Til Valhalla 💪💪
This was my favorite video youve put out. Keep it up Paddy. You made me a real fan with this one.
It really puts it into perspective how good these UFC guys are when they can tap 10 marines in a row.
Very good
Your best Video so far .... love it 👍👍👍
Paddy " I have to say I'm sorry I'm so fat " Marine "nah you're good" Like a gentleman 😄😄😄
This has to be one of his best ever videos to yet watching him do the 10 marines in rolling was so fun
That’s a gnarly workout!
Damn....I should have got an MOS of just hanging out in a gym...with females 🤣🤣🤣 101ST 🤙🤙🤙🤙🤙
Jesus Paddy you just found your job after UFC, travelling around the globe training with Mil guys and girls sharing your knowledge and learning from them. thats a great Nat Geo show. National Geographic are you paying attention???
brilliant
Paddy is super inspiring , already a proper legend.
Love this sorta content
💯💯💯
Who all here that are guys have definitely punished yourselves to some dirty online videos at least once this year? Beating it with no socks on and earphones in for that max naughty hearing experience. All guys dnt be afraid and just comment below if you all have indeed punished the family jewels behind closed locked doors for your private session with yourself...💯💯🤣🤣
what a legend 👏 🤣👍
Why the UFC is still feeding bums to this guy? I mean he's already a champion in another promotion so he's no rookie Arman Tsarukian has already officially asked for the fight! Why not?
No words! Blessed to have Paddy!
Forces needed this training paddy!! We appreciate you!🇺🇸
This was brilliant.. truly heartwarming
Loved this.
Your fuckin killin it my guy. Keep it up. Ya fucking animal
Great episode Paddy!! Much support brother 🔥💯
Suck a sick guy you are paddy lad..attitude is everything💪
you made me cry watching this, stay well man and keep kicking arse!
Graham has taken a lot of shit this year… but he had handled Paddy perfect
Next time you're in SD/pendleton/oceanside, hop out for some surf too!
You should see if they'll let you shoot some machine guns
04:04 Love the clap 🤣
amazing vid
WOW Paddy what an experience and you grappled them hard 👊 This is super content but at same time shows the respect you hold; and  given to others 👏
This was cool asf!
Always feels like a blessing watching your videos paddy, so much positive and inspirational content 🙏🏻 speak some real truths that men are afraid to say but need to hear. Keep winning paddy the baddy 💪🏼💪🏼
💚🤣
Best part of the video is him rolling with them, really shows the level these ufc guys are at. The marines were putting the pressure on & paddy is getting them to tap.
great video!
Well done paddy 🤙🏻
This was beautiful to see man
paddy has such a great attitude, seems like an awesome guy to be around. keep up all the good work paddy, you are a legend
Paddy I got nothing but respect for you buddy I'm a retired US Marine as long as you had fun bud that's really all that counts
Fighting out of the red corner "PADDY THE BADDY PIMBLETT"
This kid is the real deal. Such a good person inside and out.
"As I say im sorry im so fat lad" said paddy wat a guy 😂😂😂😂
Best vlogs in the UFC, hands down
love it how he says sorry to the people that has to carry him for him being fat
His face is bloated because of the food he eats he has water retention. But you can still see abs through his shirt! he never stops training so hes actually gaining muscle not fat.
epic xD
Creased. 😂
Go head lad 💓
The way he says sorry I’m fat lad makes me laugh haha
Making the world better one video at a time.  Keep speaking to us patty, your journey is inspiring.
This video was cool as fuck son, need to get some of those guys back in combative though.
this was so sick to watch. been loving the vids! keep killin the game
Very nice, much wow, me like
Love this!
Thank you for this Paddy! 🇺🇸
Great message Paddy. Especially to our service men and women. While our military are the strongest and bravest, super important to also work out the mind/emotions as much as the body. I bet that was a great message for them to hear. I was born n raised in San Diego-as far as I’m concerned Paddy you can call SD home
Can't wait for your next fight paddy!
That was bad to the bone, we need paddy to train the military he just destroyed them all. Paddy the Baddy baby! Woo!
Paddy your content is absolute perfection!! The camera work and editing is top notch and episodes are always entertaining. Looking forward to your next fight!!
paddys's jiu jutsu is world class. He makes it look easy, that's when you can tell, he's worth the hype.
Paddy just casually tapping out 10 US soldiers 😂
Paddy has been killing it in America. Loved all the podcasts he did. Wish Mike Tyson was more present for the podcast. That had to be disappointing for Paddy.
Paddy’s in my home town that’s awesome hope you enjoy north county bro , you gotta check out tys burger house best joint in Oceanside
Paddy you are the guy like
Yass here we go!!
Yuttt!
I’m impressed with your dexterity in your right middle finger!! I saw it quite often this episode!!🤣
im ex military and this is awesome   you see all the wet wipes in the gym paying to be fit when nature provides the best gym for free
Making Liverpool proud lad ;P
Paddy is a freaking Gem 😂
yes paddy ya fuckin leg end
Paddy you're putting out so much great content man, I feel like I should be paying for this stuff tbh.
