14:14 the base looks like a cat
scar pranks:  stealing murder
14:59 I thought he was going to show us the back of the house! 😭
Costco guys: grian, nahhh I’m a pie guyy
Is it me or does dark oak trap doors look like chocolate bars
Grian is giving us build hacks yassssssss
GRIAN ARE YOU OKAY?!
WHO HERE THINKS THAT TIM/solidarity should be in hermit craft
WHO HERE THINKS THAT TIM/solidarity should be in hermit craft
… but the boulder, the entity. It kinda took over.
Ohhh uhhhhh! How did you get there in the middle of the day…. Suss…. Super sus
Scar. Well hello there! Like an npc LOL AHHAHAAHAHAH
15:19 good job on the lack of chest monster❤  (I have one in every world)😅
16:54 Grian would make a good Bob Ross.
apparently the subtitles thing grian is korean
6:18 the most American vs British argument 😂😂
6:10 scar had a flash back to S.8 😂
17:00  BadTimeWithScar left the game Me: WHAT!?!? When???
"There was an old Grian who lived in a shoe.." -14:31
Wither on Java: baby mode Wither on Bedrock: nightmare mode
Mumbos home is suddenly inside a skyscraper 😮
Is it just me or did I only just notices that Scar's tag is GoodTimeWithScar
17:01 BadTimeWithScar left the game
giran 🙃
Love your base
6:04 6:55 7:50 13:20 21:14
Just gonna say, Grian, a place where an alchemist/chemist works in is an atelier. I know that this has been 2-ish years ago, but yes, it is an atelier.
Why does grians goood…BYE! Give me so much nostalgia to stampy back in the day
Bedrock players rip for trying this wither strat haha😂 (Probably)
Nice roof Grain
Shoe
23:51  what do they taste like? 😂
Logs 2 electric boogaloo lol
It's less efficient
8:22 Bcz the wither is easy af
Bro at 17:02, scars name as he leaves is BADtimewithscar, lolol
Believe it or not I’m trying to build this by looking at the time lapse and I’m off to a good start actually
I feel like most people don't do the Iron Golem method, because:  A.) It's a lot harder to gather so much iron in a single player survival. Let alone on harder difficulties. B.) Iron golems, and by extension Withers, are pretty unpredictable. They'll agro and de-agro for seemingly no reason, and can be badly affected by lag or slow devices. C.) On some worlds it's very hard to find pumpkins. Not to mention some of the older, casual players don't even know how to obtain Carved Pumpkins. Since they used to just be the default pumpkin block. D.) The Wither is a scary, and unnecessary boss for most players. The only reason you'd need it is an Ender Chest or Beacon, neither of which are particularly useful if you're not an expert builder. F.) It's definitely a pride thing. It's incredibly impressive to beat something considered world destroying in lore. Not to mention the Wither is very hard to create and has a good arsenal of options to destroy you and the world forever. By extension, the achievement you get for defeating the Wither is a pride thing as well.  Just my opinion and rationale as to why people don't use Iron Golems for the Wither. It's honestly a pretty smart ploy for a large server of expert players. You'll need a lot of Nether Stars for Ender Chests and Beacons. Definitely feel free to include more reasons below.
11:22 HE SAID SUS!!! YES!!!
The entity is definitely one of the bolder attractions on the server.
14:57 Ngl i really thought that he was revealing that he did the back.😅
15:59 i tought he was gonna say he did the back and whene i noticed he did i tought to myself WHY DID YOU NOT TELL US
And iron golems regenerate really fast why does nobody do this????
Why this the channel witv the most banger Musik ,also whose here in 2024 because I am .(: 👇
😂❤
Doggo :3
I'll never get over the fact that that starter base is a shoe 😅
late but IT LOOKS THE HOUSE OF THAT LADY WHO LIVES IN A BOOT!!!!
I'm on your world (a copy(a mod)) and I just found your house!! I love seeing all of these awesome builds!
I’ve been using iron golems to kill the wither since I was four years old
Gem is the true elf
For permits a good question could be have you checked if your refrigerator is running
its looks like b dubs made it
Did anyone else “Logs 2 Electric Boogaloo” for the second log chest lmao
grian then: BOTEM POLE OF DEATH grian now: im a pie guy ((:
Who else saw logs 2 electric bogalo 15:24
It’s gotten so bad that scar has to constantly have totems on him
5 min
Who else is rewatching the entire series after it just ended because you have nothing better to watch?  Edit: "It just spoke to me, it said, 'I really dont want to be a house'" 😂
The BOULDER feels conflicted 13:15
Shut the front 🚪
Y 7days
When he was telling us to look at something just after the building the starter base compilation I thought he was showing us that he finally did the back of something. 😂 (see hermitcraft 7)
I like the shoe starter base😂
It looks like a shoe
15:50 Minecraft feng shui
does anyone have a tutorial on that shoe house looking really good.
10:03
“Scar and withers are fun” Secret Life foreshadowing
Back then, when the economy was partially intact and giving someone a diamond was a special thing.
Conversation
At the start when be jumped my soul left my body.
Joehills reacting to scar getting the wither skull achievement and then the totem achievement is so funny
Java wither is a nerd compared to bedrock 😤😑😒
I actually had a book when I was little that was an OFFICIAL guide to Minecraft, with quotes from Jen and Notch, and it recommended beating the Wither with Iron golems. Even Mojave knows they’re OP.
love the scenes of the crafting table on your starter base roof from 19:04 till 19:47
Grian’s got a PhD in art or smth
.
You cannot stop me
I did it by by accident I went to hide in my bunker and iron golems killed it that was over top of the village
I always just wait for the season to end and then watch the whole thing then 😅
id love to see grian painting irl
Hi
I thought when grian said we were gonna be proud of him he was gonna say he did the back of the base
"There's zombies in my tree"
i love hermit crabs :D
Anyone else gonna realize that Grian made a new Boulder-SCP? It speaks, breathes, and has a heart.
your not living UNDER a rock you'd be living IN a rock XD
This is how i kill withers ive got a pit underground very far from my base full of iron golems and i just go there and summon one then run away until it dies before returning to collect the goods
Where diamond chandlierer
Scars reaction from 6:52 to 7:05 is the best I have seen from him
are you aware you live in a shoe
Scar's "Wait, I heard jubilation!" So cute!
"oh pooter"
"Scar and withers are fun"  Cue that flashbacks
Curious, how do you get your footage? 🤔
Listening to grian talk about building tips like the dividers and stuff is like asmr
Man i love that part where Grian did the right summoning thing with the right blocks but placed a torch under it so it wouldnt spawn lol
scar being happy cause there are gonna be infinite amount of totems of undying
Doubted it'd work since I did it in a creative world but u just realised yours was closed off lol
Grian I know you live in England so I hope it’s not rude for me to ask, but what’s your favorite football team?
theres one thing we can all agree on, grian is the bob ross of minecraft
11:24 Super SuS the ukrainian chernobyl guy?
So proud of you grain 😂😂😂 yes i said that on purpose 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good job you just cheered me up
I’m a pie guy 🙂😊
I always miss the first 30-40 episodes of HC bc I get burnt out by it and stop watching lol
I love that no matter what, Grian is will never stop trying to teach us how to build😂❤
Anyone else watching this while drinking tea?!
The iron golem plan was genius and I will be using it in my game
If grian actually lived under the entity he will be the ultimate Patrick star from SpongeBob
Grian: has full enchanted diamond armour in episode 3 Me: plays a world for months and still doesn’t have a single diamond 🥲🥲🥲
Poor scar when grian places the final wither skull backwards😂
4:50
as a boulder i can confirm, i spoke to grian
Grian we are proud of you not only for the storage system but also finishing the back
ah. the wizard jenkins
At some point in this episode, grian mined dirt with a PICAXE!
honestly, if he put a duck bill on the house, it would easily pass of as a duck. at least in shape, but come to think of it the guy with the eagle might think he stole the idea
Ooh, lore this season! The Entity, the studying of The Entity, I love it
Everyone has kind of creative names for their camera accounts and Impulse's is just "ImpulseCam."
Why does Scar remind me of Taurtis?!
New Idea after watching this: “Wither Mining”
What texture pack are they using for the grass
i can't stop seeing a dog. in the base
I really thought what i was supposed to be proud of was Grian doing the backside of a base.......
Grian and Scar: spawn a wither Joe immediately:Its loose isn't it.
hmm... 19:00 ish  i would have added some bits to the copper wall and said 'thanks for the copper this puts me ahead of schedule leet me know if you want any = insert material no one of them wants but have bitloads of wasting around' ^^ after all.. a copper wall aint to shabby
use a shield when fighting blases
Top most builders:
ur home is a boot
Scar will need those Totems....
So back in the day I remember watching Stampy and squid not wanting to ruin their world mine out a box in the nether to fight the wither and it was so easy in a confined space  That then became my method but I would also always surround it with iron golems before I spawn it
I'm pretty sure that strategy for the Wither wouldn't have worked in bedrock lol
Is it just me or does grians starter base looks like a shoe
what are the riqiermints to join hermitcraft
There once was a man called grian  Who lived in a shoe near a rock
Me when I saw the starter base: The poem with the old woman that lived in a shoe
10:20 I think most people just like the satisfaction of killing the wither themselves
I have never seen someone use iron golums to slay the wither. and I think it's because in a lot of mods, iron golums just won't attack some bosses, so there might be a misconception that they just can't target boss monsters, guess that's wrong and I know what I'll do for my next wither fight
Boot house 16:41
16:38 I thought it was supposed to look like a cat-
Use a shield when farming blaz3 rods
Ahhhhhhhhhh it will not let. Me play video ahhhhhhhbhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Make new season
4 (1/2x+3)= 3x + 12 said  my panties!
Did anyone else see someone called “bad times with scar” at 17:02  I need to know the lore someone tell me!
what is the music called? 13:25
Is it just me or doesn't grains starter house look like a wizards show lol
"What are you doing here? sus" Did ya mean... SSSSSSSus?
Mumbo jumbo season 2...
1 can anyone join the server? and if they cant what can they prove them self to actually join this server? 2 hello i love ur series i started to watch u around 2018 :) maybe season 6 im unsure
"So to make the starter house, we need to enchant my armor and get a beacon" 💀💀
123456789
The house looks like a boot
the house looks like a puppy with a wizard hat on
You know hermitcraft is skilled when he can fight the wither and title the video “starter base”
The reason I don’t fight the wither like that is because I play bedrock in the bed rock wither is insane
Grian: Hehe funny prank on Scar Scar: You fool! I have outsmarted your outsmarting!
Orion golems?
I am sorry for standing on your face 🤣
*☆THE GEOLOGIST☆*
your starter house is so beautiful 😍 ❤
It looks like he’s living under a shoe. He- He got rid of the chest monster!! I’m so proud of you!!
I thought he was going to say that we should be proud that he finished the back
23:53 should actually be "scar and I" 🤓
omg, it had an add right as Scar put the last skull on!! 💀I'm dying!
The house looks like a shoe and can't unsee Grian as the old lady who lived in a shoe
What happened to embracing the chestmonster, Grian?
2:50 He's so Pie-ious
10 months later, and watching again!
If you have the iron to use (which is very easy to get after a while) I'd definitely recommend this!
Bruh grians voice is amazing ❤
I think why people don't use iron golems in the wither fight is because they are so expensive like you need stacks and stacks of iron
You give me a lot of inspiration for my base.
Subscribing for the organized chests
Your starter base looks like a boot
Sus💀
This might be too much to ask, but could we get a tutorial of how to build that starter house of yours? It's gorgeous!
I’m very angry that I didn’t do the wither this way. I lost half of my base because I had the bright idea to put it in my basement and encapsulate it with obsidian.  Lol
I am going to prepare for my wither battle by creating iron golems. Thanks
I think people don’t spawn 20 iron golems to kill the wither because it is a waste of time and resources considering how easy it is to kill the wither by yourself. Although, in bedrock edition, using a bunch of golems might be a little bit more justified considering how mind bogglingly op they are in there.
0:38 not grian with the water bucket mlg... I'm sorry Dream who??
Iron golems u goo boys
full boulder alchemist
Let AnimusJ Join!!!!!
Honestly Grian starter base this season looks like a shoe
the part that holds the warp vine looks a tiny bit like a c...
No one’s talking about how he already has a chest monster
Grian has created the religion of the boulder
Grain:the border spoke to me it doesn’t want to be a house
I’m more impressed that he did the back
The title : My Starter House The REAL title : My 3rd Episode House
How dare thou tarnish thy chest monster
I thought it was a shoe
At 20:46 he missed a chance to say I’m a Pie-oneer lol
next season you should live alone with scar and mumbo, living in a whale that moved accross the sea with mumbos amazing redstone skills lol
That house looks SO good
i love watching the chat panic over them spawning a whither lol
Can I join hermetcraft
Hermit craft should make a main channel
15:48 "It's a functional base" The exterior:
… Alpaca lovers 16:38.
HE FINNALY DID IT HE ORGINIZED
I have seen wadzee do it
seed
Is it just me, or does Mumbo’s vault look like a pig face?
Hmm why am i starting watching right after 7 monthw?
no gooodbye?
15:14 :)
The only legendary quote out there "alright, ready? Lets....GO!
15:18 Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo 😂😂😂
the storage house kinda looks like a dog with a witch hat👍🤔
24:42
11:15
16:55    if your smart you will understand
How come the world borders are so close? Did they lower the map size?
Won't there be a bunch of mobs underneath your base? Cuz you just made a huge space under your starter base
Can't help myself but your house looks like a wizzard snale to me... cute though :D
14:27
you could say he is a pie-us man
Grian,for heck’s sake, it’s the this’d episode! No withers!
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa oooooooooooooooooo
انا
I see this 1 taim
Am I the only one : “you guys are going to be so proud of me” thinking he was going show he actually finished a back 😂😩
Though You Were Going To Tell Us You Actually Finished The Back
Omg grian IS a minecraft genius! He keeps coming up with super simple things that actually work and I can't believe no one else does??? Wow
are we all gonna ignore the fact that scar said “I wonder what they taste like” well talking about how villagers keep dying
The house looks like the shoe from that one story with the old lady who lived in the shoe
Am I the only one that thought when he said your gonna be proud of me I thought he was gonna say he didn’t do the back.
Grian: makes roof out of copper Me: Toothpaste
I’m on a server with by friends and the leader of the server made one of the rules being that you had to be vegan so logically we made an illegal underground pumpkin pie cartel I’m talking full on secret base,farms,getaway tunnels and emergency bunkers I’m the one making the failsafes in case we get caught it’s crazy also in the lore of the server the god of the server is a cat boy in a maid dress it’s nice
Grian see eye streem's new vid about breeding youtubers
just gonna say, the iron golem thing probably wouldn't work on Bedrock Edition, The Wither is WAY more OP on Bedrock
“The pebble”
14:10
Wait… you could use a wither to dig and find diamonds
Grian: I definitely want to branch out with my colour palettes   Also Grian: surrounds Mumbo’s base with a single coloured block
grian made a shoe as a storage room
The conversation with tango sounds like a breaking bad deal
For this episode, Grian's favorite number is 3.14 (pi)
We’re so proud of u grain!😂
Is that entity 69 from the backrooms?
obscurosmith
I think the scar wither from the start of season nine you should build a shrine to remember it
3:11 have you heard of a shield or a trident
bro I'm from india and theres a gamer called beast boy shub and he already used iron golems to defeat wither
I’m just proud that there’s a back
You should get mushroom cows (the brown ones) and get dandelions and make the best food in the game
Not gonna lie I honestly thought he was gonna say he was proud that he finally did a back heheh
is it just me or does the storage/house looks like a shoe
Grian... my guy.... ANOTHER WIZARD TOWER?
The house reminds me of shrek
I love how Grian is so excited when he water bucket clutches meanwhile I have done the Dream boat craft clutch thrice. (Vid proof on my channel)
16:27 UP SIDE DOWN T
Man there's 3d sound with other players voices
Me and my brother spent 10 hours making a trading haul in our survival world and we barely even use it anymore
HOUSE=PEPPER
The Shoe
People don’t get golems to fight the wither because it is so expensive.
The villager at the outro like "who is he talking to?"
😎
what is it with grian and withers?
ITS SO ORGANIZED
What you can do to mine copper is keep it in your left hand and mine with your right while left click spam.
Grian? ORGANIZED!? WHO R U AND WHAT HAVE U DONE 2 GRIAN???
Is The Boulder Going to End up Being A Egg Situation From The Dream SMP
Grain its expensive that's why
16:58 round off the corner's in minecraft 😂
20:55 WHAT ABOUT GOLDEN CARROTS
I did think your roof looked like Scar's Magic Mountain Hat from Last Life. So yeah, looks magician-y.
Ok but the house looks like a sea serpent or smthn
God job grin
Very good house
Creeper vented
7:18 Don’t be disturbed by that number, Grian. The researchers testing the first nuclear bomb were only 98% sure the device wouldn’t literally ignite the atmosphere and end all human life instantly. The actual chance of that happening ended up being closer to 0.0000002%, not 2%, but still. These dudes were 2% sure they’d instantly wipe out all life on the planet and still gave nukes the go-ahead.
To me your starter base looks like a cat with a magician’s hat.
scar has the patience of a god.
It looks like a shoe
24:40 Wait! Did anyone else catch this!? This caught me way off guard. lol
Your house kinda looks like a cat with a wizard hat
Bring back the man chicken costume!!!🐓
Can u make a tutorial of your house plzzzzzz *i want to make it*
i know im late: but honestly, that starter house is making me see stuff. if you flip the lower roof tail part outward, maybe like an s shape and you put a face or something on the white part, to me it looks like a cat with a wizard hat. something is really wrong with me, i know
Ppl don't do the iron golem method because it's not really effective and you could just use dripstone
15:43 how did u get the trap doors? ._.
Grian this season: I’m so broke :’(  Season 7: let’s make a diamond beacon that no one’s gonna use to prove we are rich
Hi
Your house looks like a shoe
I like how at the end of the base building Timelapse he showed the back to show “GUYS IVE DONE IT”
Grians starter house looks like a shoe lol
Left a like just for that bucket clutch.
Hes stuck between a rock and a hard place
First studying the moon now the entity
He should have used soul lanterns
19:46 my timestamp :)
Lol your house reminds me of the nursery rhyme "there was an old lady who lived in a shoe" haha it looks amazing though. Haha
Nice vid
In this video, you can tell by grian accepting tango’s accusation that he understands that there is no i in business.
The golems beating down on the wither was hilarious
imagine orginising
The chest monster is growing
ha ha he said sus
My name is Max Mand
14:27 Done building  b o o t
Grian has given the bases backstories
Yooo, 20:55
Grain is a pi guy. 3.14159-
Don't you love these videos of hermitcraft they always seem to make me smile
9:54 because it is so cost inefficient
I’ve never seen anybody else use iron golem‘s to kill the weather!
I always did that with the wither, i also do that in the deep dark to kill warden
no one on java has any reason to complain about fighting the wither and it being hard especially with golems.
Logs to electric boogaloo!!!!! Did y’all see it
Grian x Mumbo
Grian saying sus is just… wrong
I really like that Starter house, Although It'd be more of a mid game house for me. Could you make a tutorial or something?
Episode three of asking if I can join the server
Does anyone know the song that plays during the speed build at 13:27? It would be nice if Grian put it in the description
Honestly so funny that Joe saw Scar and Grian spawn a wither and was immediately concerned that it was loose
Tbh I'm just proud that u finished the back of the house lol
"Villager farms?" no no no I thinl the correct word is "Breeding farms"
Ngl it kids looks like a dog magician
The house looks like a duck
He mined several tons of copper before deciding g weather or not to sell it
As an architect oddly enough the building tips for interiors he gives are very similar to what we use in real life designs
Does anyone think that looks kind of like a dog?
Scar jokes are really annoying, but anyway, i will watch another serie, do you recommend one ?
6:55 my heart is not strong enough
8:55 nobody does this because withers are normally high up
17:02 why does it say badtimewithscar and not goodtimewithscar😂😂😂
he used the rong pick
I don’t get ow u can play mincraft for hours and hours I’m only playing it for 30 minutes until my back starts aching innit
17:02 BadTimeWithScar left the game
I'm so proud of grian he's organized.
(15:20)  Ah, yes Logs  Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo  Anyone who has watched Season 7 will get the reference and know why this is funny XD
Can we have another war this season?
the house looks like a chiuaua
21:13 perfect timing
I am very proud u labeled the chests
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAY DID YOU DO TO GRIAN!!! HE NEVER SORTS STUFF!!!!!!!!!!
What music are you using?
5:54 General Kenobi
6:54 I wouldnt have been that surprised if he did tbh 15:13 Who are you and what have you done to Grian???
15:10 make me your apprentice please
Ok ok
Ha, how long did it take to get the first clip, you had 27 xp on the last episode
WAIT he said living under a rock right? WHY DOESNT HE MOVE UNDER THE ROCK? Patrick star
Why does grian say iron golems like that
He also finished the back of the base lol
The bases seem to be very close to each other this season
Minecraft doesn't work so I have to just watch
"starter base" made a month after world creation lol
An idea: spawn the wither in the nether and let it mine ancient debris
This looks likes the season 8 house
I watched Mumbo's hermitcraft 9 series first and I gotta say you have a LOT more videos on this than he does
Am I the only one that thinks the house looks like a dog
Grian is actually an incredible architect
Did anyone notice that at 16:29 grian took damage, and that is because he missed the vine and cut  it out of the video (too embarrassed) 😂😂
So much sugar from pies (still don’t know how to handle that much sugar)
im just happy it has a back-
The: Oh loo ah k si jx gv so good, was so good
I am proud there a back to the base
me thinking owl house when i see Grians base
“weird and wonderful rock”  how we love the weird and wonderful rock
The house kinda looks like a dog
I'm so proud of Grian for no longer having a chest monster lol he did us proud
15:14 Grian your on drugs. Organized,no chest monster,and labeled! WTF
Do it in bedrock edition
11:22 Sus, super sus. 🤣 you earnd a new sub
Lore season?!
I don’t need a new phone number to call you back from your office
Grian what was that music you played during the time lapse of you building your base it sound very 80s I want to use it for an edit if that’s okay
Meanwhile bedrock Wither: "I do not have such weaknesses  💀💀💀      🥋
Mobo is going wax them
there are a danish youtuber called zagimc who kill withers in that way
wither pranks hilarious wholesome also great job organizing pog
so what I learned from this is that I should use withers for diamond mining
It’s probably too expensive to spawn enough iron golems and people are probably fighting the wither really early for speed runs
Hi
10:53 you shoud listen to Pickaxe
now beat the wither on bedrock
i thought the new house/storage compartment, was a boot.
When he said that he organized I was like who are you and where is grian
"This build is supposed to look like an alchemists house" me seeing a cat
0:02 que mumbo jumbo's stupid song remix
Now I understand why scar and grain are soulmates in double life
I envy your building skills
Keep standing on my face daddy grian
Good gob with the storage
I use iron golems always
15:17 In reality, we are proud of you for doing the back of the base first time
from what i saw from the thumbnail this gives me a little Port Laguna vibe (port laguna is a place in a dutch themepark called toverland)

people don't do the iron golem idea because they dont want to put in the effort to get the iron.
I’m 15 and I watch mc vids bc I like mc but when I have mentioned it to my friends they laugh bc they think it’s childish and stupid and I’m like??? 🤔 if you like doing ur nails ur gonna watch nail vids, if u like to play football your gonna watch football vids so why do I get laughed at for watching mc vids?? (Plus I’m a girl so they think it’s even weirder) I have been watching grians hermitcraft seasons since season 7 and it’s nice to see the kind community in it and their friendships. they’re pretty funny too
HE FINISHED THE BACK?!
its pretty 14:29
The base reminded me of a giant shoe. I thought he was doing a reference to the fairytale about elves making shoes. 😂
I really like this video and I did not know that iron golams attack the wither
I've been in creative messing around with build idea's I've had and this makes for some amazing background noise in a pretty quiet house
no one kills the wither like that because doing it in the end under the bedrock is much easier edit: and there are better ways to use iron
that house looks sick
I need to know what happened to the golems
"Look at those fancy heads!" -Scar 2022
Copper is a new and not but what is it actually used for? I never got that xD
Wha send is this?
Me on my first week on my SMP: struggling to build a nether portal Grian and Scar on their first week: already killing a wither with multiple iron golems
22:52 I almost died irl. Felt the need to tell all of you that
It has a back it has a freaking back
Grian built a whole build in one episode??? That's forbidden
It looks like a dog tbh, not bad, i like it
People acualy do beat the wither with golems...
Who are you and what have you done to Grian?
16:28 okay…
14:58 am i the only one that didnt notice
This turned into a building tutorial
Maybe they don't do that with the iron golems cause you don't get the achievement?
Grian, we’re less proud of the fact you organized everything than we are of the fact you did the back /pos
should've been a rustic house
Grian: I sorted all my stuff out! Me: Okay, stop lying who took the real grian.
as a bedrock player I am surprised those iron golems worked.
He lives in a boot
The bace looks like a llama
I'm more proud of you for building the BA k of the house, good job grian ^^
*The HermitCraft server should make a main Channel.*   It could just be the occasional mining compilation of all of the cast* / highlight reels, that would be a great way to not miss out on what’s going on whilst maintaining an audience. It could also be small videos of just each creators’ progress every few months or so. At the end of the season they could also show the end vs. the beginning of the whole sever. IThis would be a great way to spotlight some of the other creators on hermit craft that don’t upload as much and are hard to find in other people videos. It would also be a great way to find out new season themes and new people that are coming onto the server. It could also be a castaway for those that are leaving. It would also be awesome to just hear some of the cast* coming together and just talking about their experiences playing (similar to a podcast). I think it would be a high demand channel for those who love Hermit-craft content and expand to even more viewers.   Cast*: a way to refer to everyone that participates in the current Hermit Craft season  and any profits if made could just go to editors/ the server itself so there’s no money dispute between any creators
grian is that diorite youre using *once in a lifetime sighting*
Im proud that Grian made the back of the base.
Got to love grains lore
You organized!!!!
Have you ever tried this in bedrock edition
so proud of you grian
Scar pressed x to doubt
ur montages are so good
Hahaha scar said oh hello there
Next season, is it fine if I join, I’m also a really good bedrock builder
I wonder if they can kill the ender dragon. By they I mean the golem
Late to the party busy finishing season 8 xD  The Boulder? The entity inspired?  Would it happen to be from your eternity manga/anime?  Give the same vibes 😭🤣🤣
You know, I kinda love the pie addiction. In my server, I was dared to only eat one food for he whole thing, the first thing I ate was all I could eat for the rest of the server, and I wasn't allowed to starve myself until I found something I liked. Just my luck, all of my friends followed me around and stole meat and destroyed crops constantly. I got so desperate that I ended up eating melons, and now the running joke is my forced melon addiction...
is grian filming?... nah, bob ross is
"What do they taste like?"   -Scar 2022
The temp base reminded me immediately of "There Was an Old Woman who lived in a shoe. She had so many children, she didnt know what to do......"
Potatoes are really bad for your hunger but baked potatoes I’m pretty sure are better than bread!
Anyone else get the idea to make ice wizards home as a base in the frozen mountain?
Looks like a boot 👍
"Why don't people do this?" when Iron golems kill The Whither. Meanwhile, me playing on Bedrock. "This seems like a great idea, I made this box with Obsidian and it's full of Iron Golems, let me just spawn the- Oh, they're all dead, nevermind, I'm out."
Who is the owner for the hermit craft server
no one: grian creating major trust issues:
How you dare my face hurts 0:01 0:00 didnt work for me
For normal player building this house is very difficult
HOW IS GRIAN ORGANISING STUFF
16:26
I’m using iron golems next time I fight the wither
I got 3 adds right before Scar put the last head. THE SUSPENSE
I appreciate that things are being taken a little slower this season. Last season grain had the ender dragon slayed in 1 ep!
I never new that about the wither! That is amazing!
U should play terraria
14:55 I genuinely thought he was gonna say "I actually built the back of the house"
I love how grain did the wither on episode 3 lol
viniccius 13 has a wither satr farm in this way man
Is it bad that when I see the starter base, I see an ice skate?
Is it just me or does the house / storage house look like a cat …
"I'm a pie guy"
THEY ARE ALL LAAAABLED!!!
Anyone else think that Grian's boulder, "The Entity", could work as an SCP object
Technical question: why do you space out the copper? Does it make it age faster?
under the end portal in the end there is an obsidian platform. If you spaw the wither on it, it gets stuck suffacates in the end portal
23:36 Scar: So infinite totems of undying forever Tango: Yes Scar knowing that he dies too much: *celebratory yes*
Grian made a drug mule
Y’all should sell nfts on the server using maps, but instead of apes you can do creepers and other mobs.
6:46: "You're not gonna do it, I don't believe you would." Mumbo, watching this video: *'Nam-style PTSD flashback to season 8*
Its the rock!... And now there's a sock, disguised as a "house" XD
Your house kinda looks like an elf shoe
He has exactly 666 videos oh no!
can't wait for mumbo to take all the wax off those copper blocks lol
*"I don't want to be a house"*  -Entity 2022
0:39 this is also how i react when i hit an mlg water successfully
"It's all organized"  WHO ARE YOU AMD WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO GRIAN!?
He was riding in to the sky on a magic "copper" ride
Thinknoodles
8:37 uh... um uh uhhh um so uk un gcgthe5yh h64eej6ye5heytheyt 4yhereyhyr ......   What do you mean, scar?
10:30 yes I have actually saw one he was at an Arab server called artminers one of the members was challenged to kill a wither for diamonds so he used Iron golem because the challenge didn't say you can't use them
Good video
Wattles for season 10
You should build a lab and telescope to monitor the entity in the tower
*Me seeing the chest monster gone and all the organized chests.* Me; WHERE’S THE REAL GRIAN?!?!?!?!  Sorry I’m late, btw... 😭
Okay I get what you're going for here but that house is a duck.
Ryan cox  can not post on your post at all But,  I am not a Father. I am a Mother & Grandmother. & My Grand son  & Grand daughter play with me. I am 63 now. I don't remember how  long i have been playing.
WOW I did not know you can use Iron Golums I plan on trying it. Thank you Grian. Did you know your new house looks like a CAT with a Witches Hat on it. I LOVE IT.
I’m 11 and I see 36 years olds watching this. What the heck lmao-
I don’t use golems for the wither because i like the challenge of fighting it, and I don’t use golems for raids because i can kill a raid faster than golems can
You finished the back! You moved the random junk! I'm so proud of you!
It looks like a shoe
people don't use iron golems to kill the wither because it is so ez to kill underground. (or cheese it with bedrock) Its not worth the iron when it requires almost no effort
15:14 im more proud that you finished the back
why do you live in a shoe
Iron golems use too much iron I guess
Gian:- iron golems can kill the wither in a box Bedrock wither:- pathetic
I’m more excited that you did the back
If scar dies 20 times each imagine if he fought the bedrock wither
10:00 try it in bedrock
To anyone! The best place to mine is -58 and when you find diamonds mine on a direct straight line from the diamonds on coordinate. (Ex: positive x) if you don't find any diamonds in the next hundred blocks then you need to go FROM THE DIAMONDS on the (Ex: z coordinate) and you should find some. (it doesn't matter if it's Positive or Negative). I did this and in about 15 - 30 mins I got about 2 stacks. I would recommend a few stacks of torches, eff 3, 4, 5, unbreaking, 1, 2, 3 and a fortune 3 pick. Caves work but in the new update if diamonds spawn next to "Cave Air" they are most likely to be 1-3 veins, while in strip mining it tends to be 4-8 veins.\
So proud Grian u did the back of your starter base
grian thinks y no one using iron golem to kill wither  me: y not use wither for mining
gamer wants a fair match grian: where Iron golem
Animation vs Minecraft: The Hay Of The Farm 🐖 - Episode 3
I also only started watching grian with my bro
I’m buying all the copper
he shouldve build the "waves" on top of the house pointing towards the entity
at 7:51 the particals appered before he even hit the ground play in playback 0.25x you'll see
ITS A SHOEEE
U have a back side 👏👏
Dude your an evil Genius
14:57 I thought he was going to show us that he had did the back😂
The tower should be ur bedroom ngl
I thought the house looked like a cute puppy.
He didnt say ba byee :[
grian pls get an amongus creeper texture pack
it has already been done by zetro with 100 golem
Grian and Tango talking about the raid farm.  Scar: What do villagers taste like?
POV: ur grian’s parents that are proud
Grian: why doesn’t nobody use golems to kill the wither! Everybody: WE DOOOOO!!!!!!!!
Grian "The saturation on pies is very low and it doesn't last long AND YOU KNOW WHY THATS GREAT BECAUSE THAT MEANS I CAN EAT MORE PIES"
In bedrock version this is how we kill the wither outside of the end portal trick. It's how I killed the wither for quite sometime. Our wither never goes in a straight line through tunnels so we spam kill him with the golems
Look at the mlg tho💪🙏
About the iron golem vs wither thing, it’s just easier to spawn it under the nether roof and kill it while it’s head is stuck in bedrock
Iron Golems in an obsidian room in the nether at the upper bedrock so it can't fly away is a Bedrock staple (where the wither is a much more stupidly deadly bother). It works to tear the wither up in short order and leaves you with a host of black roses since a lot of the golems will die.        Most of the online players are Java where the wither is a good deal more survivable.
my dad did that once like... the second time i watched him play.
i wnated to subscribe but then i realized i already did
"why is nobody using iron golems against withers?" Because Grian, you can just dig under the portal in the end, and stuck the wither there and kill it with grace, who would bother using golems-
When he said that your going to be proud of me I thought it was because of the back being done willingly 😂
"Why does no one do this" because the wither is piss easy to beat
Ah i missed alot of stuffs in this hermitcraft series
people dont use iron golems because they just trap it under the end return portal
it looks like a cat
Came back to the game, thought my building was awful, made a castle, thought I was a pro, watched a grian video, realized I'm still bad at building
Boot
Nah I'm just proud you did the back!
Cracking
Love this season. your amazing. Keep up the good work!
grian now lives in a shoe ._.
And here i thought this was the start of chest monster 2.0
6:54 try's it on bedrock and blows up friends base
grian you could’ve used the hollow shell under your not-so starter base as ur megabase as it canbe dug further down lol
18:04
4:46 bruh
My heart skipped a beat when he placed the 3rd scull down in the village lol
I think people don't use golems often to fight the wither because there are cheaper easier ways such as under the end portal and now dripstone. Also, smelting all that copper in a single normal furnace mildly hurt to watch..
Am I the only one that though he was going to say he finished the back when he said we would be proud
I love how they can always be positive but to be honest I couldn't be I genuinely don't know.
I feel like grian is like bad boy halos egg in the dream smp like the boulder talk to him and he also want to study it yeah LONG LIVE THE BOULDER EMPIRE BRING CHAOS TO THE SERVER YEAHHH
Creeper sus
mlg
Says I’m a pie guy. Jumps to next scene. He ate 1 pork
THE RETURN OF POLTRY MAN!!!!!!
It said “BadTimeWithScar” wasn’t it good time?
What if the wither spawned at Scars home…
Can anyone explain to me why they separate the copper like that? Can’t they age with them next to each other?
You should have built the base under the entiti
those guys most love it when your doing something stupid knowing your starting another video watching with popcorn if your gonna die from all that falling in the beginning lol
This seasons war is going to do with walls
A YouTuber named wadzee did 100 iron golems
Grain saying “sus” makes me want to jump off a bridge
Lol wow I’m not alone. Dad of a 12yo daughter who got me into Minecraft and now I love the game and love watching these guys.
So that is what java is like I don't like bedrock anymore the either is too hard on bedrock
I’m so proud of you
A MAGE HOUSE!!!!
When is the next season of last/3rd life?
I'm proud that it has a back 🤣
Why is no one talking about the finished back?
I can't lie i feel everyone once you see it you can't unsee it your house it looks the lady in shoe story tale house
Scar: Happy birthday
Am i the only one who thought the house looked like a multi colored dog?
No one does it with iron goal-ems (idk how to spell) bec they don’t have enough iron
When he said your going to be proud of the chest i thought he was going to say he done the back of it
does anyone else think the house look like a dog
This base is my favorite color scheme and has ne trying to build a tower in similar colors and design
IT LOOKS LIKE A CAT!!!!!
When you said you will all be proud of me I thought it eased that you built the back.
Me sucking at combat, having never fought the wither and always used iron golems…”wait people dont do this?”
i think you litterly found out a new feature
Scar totally gives me Sjin vibes🥲
you are so cool
me: wizard ducky house! grian: alchemists base to study the entity me:... oh, that makes more sence :'D
I liked the vid for the organized CHESTS ( which is so annoying)!
He growing so fast I remember when you had a giant chest monster Mr fancy pants
"What do they taste like?" -Scar.
grians gone from living outside to living in a giant shoe! so proud of him
i see a theme, so far everthig grian’s selling, it has been around mummbo’s base
Grian: what you're gonna be proud of.... me: GASP* HE MADE A BACK!!! Grian: it's all labeled, all organized me: ohh..
Love the design for Grian's starter base. The copper gradient is cool enough, but finishing the boundaries with acacia wood and warped stem just works too perfectly!
1:19 Grian became Joseph Joestar for a moment
3:07 Grian being scared of blazes while in full prot 4 diamond feels so weird after watching so many speedruns lmao. 4:34 I've heard of siphoning oil, but not siphoning copper!
Do you think you should revise your house building tutorial? Or do you think it still holds up fine all these years after?
0:37 what…
hi welc9me to chille's
S6 Grian: Sowing Seeds of War S7 Grian: Spreading Spores of Resistance S8 honestly not a real season S9 Grian: Strewing Stones of ...
Well done Grian! I’m so proud of your organized items! Try to keep them organized all season!
love the gradient
I wouldnt call that a starter base
House like a wizard
It looks like a dog lol
Add in some end crystals and it gets guaranteed
I’m so proud that you defeated your chest monster….definitely not having any doubt it won’t stay like that for long.
15:44 bro
The iron golem meta
We also have a keen eye in that you threw out your iron pick lol
The rock favourite shop is the rock
Grian, you are the only one who can make Acacia look good.
Wither mining!
"I had to stop progression on the starter base a little early, before I had time to finish the back..."  The fans: 🤬😂🤣😂 at least he did it this time
'You guys are gonna be so proud of me!' Me: YOU DID THE BACK???
Happy birthday
The crafting bench left behind on the roof has me very uncomfortable 😂
Funny how Grian didn't actually have the materials to make a iron golems so he cut the video. 5:24 XD
grian: and you guys are gonna be so proud of me!! me: *DID YOU DO THE BACK OF THE BASE???*
IAM so proud that you finished the back
15:10 what I’m proud of is that you made a back to the build! ;)
Live the color!
What's the seed of this sever?
tell me that house doesn't look like a mystical chicken
Well I now know for sure how *I* am gonna be killing the wither from now on
Waterishpuppy used iron golems to kill a wither
as a former dsmp fan thats only just getting into hermitcraft, seeing grian pull out those wither skulls so casually was terrifying lmao
I remember Mumbo tried fighting the wither with golems way back in season 2. Went well... until the nether star fell in to lava :(
the organisation omg i love everything being tidy
Is it just me or does that remind you of scares base in last life
Grian: It's NOT "Poo-ter" it's "Phut-ah". It's ""Phut-ah".
14:25
A year ago I do this @Grian okay?
Ngl, the base kinda looks like some kind of animal
Your house looks like a dog!
I wish there is a big forest arond the bases of scar mumbo and grian
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH THE UN ORGANISED GRIAN?!
Grian - I organized my chests guys Me- who are you and what did you do with grian.
Scar calling putter, pooter 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
Ok, so I'm new on this fandom, but I look at the tumbail and like, how is THAT just an STARTER house
scar really asked what villagers taste like :)
Have u noticed the face
The signs on the chests, they just add something to the build, not because it is sorted
i love yor hom
I always do the wither in a strip mine, and I fill the spawn with chickens so I get stacks of roses as well. Its really easy to kill it down there.
your starter bass in ep 3 looks like a dog with a night cap!! I love dogs!!
I'm very proud of your grian 😎 and the "It's not as fun when your good at Minecraft scar" 🥴
nobody uses iron golems cause if your not looking for a dramatic wither fight you kill it by spawning it in the end portal (but he needs content)
9:35 MY GODS THAT WITHER'S HEALTH JUST GOT ABSOLUTELY SHREDDED!!!
😂😂 all I can see is an elf boot. 👢
They should make a restaurant called “pie guys” as a play on five guys!
That wither kill was genius ngl
one finnish youtuber called Lakko has done the golem thing.
build  the  sun and the moon fighting
I'd love to join one day
Grian- if we go to the village, the villagers they will get eating                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Scar- what do the villagers taste like?
7:18 you have no idea how lucky you are. The torch didn't stop it, placing the head backwards did. If you hadn't turned around that would have been bad.
Scar: No! No! Stop Grain! Think of Pooter! Grian: Pooter!? It's Putter! Scar: Pooter Grian: Peanut Butter - Putter Scar: oooohhhh
the amount of copper there is makes it feel staged
Can we talk about how he has a chest for logs and one for logs 2: electic boogaloo
I feel like the bolder is like the egg situation again
Grian?  With organized chests?  Have I dropped into an alternate universe
You should make your character slowly get corrupted by the entity
He shoudlve used stairs for the shelves
Remember golems vs the wither from the og 2014 minecraft survival handbook
10:00 Well it’s because it’s cheaper to just stab it. xd
The base kinda looks like the shoe inn in that one fairy tale
The creeper spawn because it was In the dark
Your house look like a dog
i am especialy proud that you have actually a "back" at your house
2:45  I was wondering what that status type structure might be 🤔🤔
15:12 how how
Wat happens ro mumbo-jumbo
I think why no one has done the iron golem kills the wither strat is because sometimes the wither destorys the ground and the golems fall but here the wither took some time breaking the deepslate
When he said 'you guys are gonna be so proud of me' I genuinely thought he was about to show is the fact that he built the back of the house xD
Grian: You're going to be so proud of me! Guess what I've done! Me: You built the back?  I'm behind on season 9 episodes and trying to catch up, love what you're doing so far! XD
Me 2 seconds before the starter base: I don't think it will be over the top  Me after the base: Ok I have to try to make this on mine, this is awesome.
That’s looks like something Gem would build.
sUpEr sUs
"*happy grian noises* sO gOOD >:D" 00:39
Charge creeper should make the withere skeletons drop skulls should make getting them easier
You forgot the chess monster you made chest monster idiot now you killed the beast
Thank you for the tips on Minecraft 😊
I can imagine mumbo taking all the copper and using it for some steampunk/Redstone related build.
Shoe house
I'm more proud of the fact that the back is finished
No1 else kills the wither like that cus its unnececarily expensive. If u really dont want to fight it,  use the bedrock in the portal in the end to suffocate it and if u cant do that just spawn it in a 2x1 tunnel and kill it with a sword, you can always just run away in the tunnel and heal up since it has to break the blocks.
How long do you think this session might be?
If you put lanterns and soul lanterns together in a row it can look like fairy lights
Grian, I actually can think of one other instance of using golems to kill the wither. Back in S7, Impulse built a beacon shop (lamps +) and he used them to kill withers due to just how many stars he needed.
yeah in bedrock edition the wither is like 100x more difficult and is actually a boss
just use arrows of weekness from a ccouldren
14:54 no grian were not proud of the organization, were proud that you ACTUALLY BUILT THE BACK!!!
Everyone, subscribe to Grian on all yt accounts you have!  and let's make him the most famous mc youtuber there is
I'm with scar on this 1 it's pronounced pootter not putter 🙃😅
Grian lives in a shoe
I must say your starter base looks a lot like a shoe.
"Awesome"
awesome
20:17 the pig have 3 arm lol
Grain-your gonna be proud of me sorting my stuff out. Me-I'm proud that you finished the back of your base😂😂      If you know you know😂💯👍
Grian saying it’s all organised  Me: YEEEEEEEESSSSSSS I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOMENT MY WHOLE LIFE!
*i don’t want to be a house.*   -The Entity, 2022-2022
I get the feeling that The Entity may be part of the lore for this season
Grian: guess what I did, you'll be proud of me Me: actually built a back to your base? Grain: no chest monster! Me: that works too
i did the iron golems trick
5:55 general kenobi
STOP TORTURING THE DISABLED MINECRAFTER, GRIAN!!! (lol) You are going to give him a heart attack! SHAME UPON YOUR BOULDER (House) SHAME!!!!!!!!!
I thought he would say we would be proud of him for doing the back of a build XD
14:55 I genuinely thought he was going to say we would be proud because he did the back
I used to do that golem thing fighting wither on mobile version coz its hard to fight wither in pocket edition..
I have actually seen a German Gaming YouTuber kill the wither with Iron Golems a year or so ago
The boulder probably didn't want grian's face on it
Og San Andreas players are cursed with the other place which this name was used 20:16
Grains house looks like a dog in a hat
There was a young Grian who lived in a shoe... He had so much copper to age there was only one thing to do...
I, for one, are very proud of your organization. 🥰
Sitting in my bed watching some hermitcraft eating baked lays after a long day of school.
HE DIDN'T SAY LETS GO
THAT WORKED?!?!
The back of a build? Organization???? Who are you and what have you done with our Grain boy?
The pillar method is great but yeah, I feel people lose alot of items from it
the most thing I am proud from grian he did a back to the "storage system"
Can you make the small modern house from one of rizzial's vid?
The “Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo” chest gives me life
I love all of grians timelapses! If there could be like, a "best of grian's timelapses" I'd watch that too💕
20:55 Pie-oneer
The reason at least I don’t kill the either with iron golems is because… all you need is a wooden sword, a bow and some arrows. No armor or food needed really; you can make it without that if you make a tunnel for the wither. (This is not to say I’m good at the game tho ;-; )
Ou! MY FAC… OU STOP!
Hermitcraft has helped me a lot it’s just really nice to be able watch something that gives me building ideas and it makes me happy after a bad day
low key thought that base was a dog....
stew pit
Can we take a moment to congratulate Grian for not forgetting the back of a build for once
For hermit raft 10 do a sky shop
I miss grians looty
Obsidian box (or endstone), tons of iron golems, withers. Free beacons.
The most impressive thing about your house is that it has a back
Alot of hermits are doing villagers
Hey Grian ever heard of Wadzee
Does anyone know what the Timelapse song was? It’s kind of a bop
If scar tried bedrock wither i dont think he"ll survive
6:09 *season 8 flashbacks*
I don’t thinks it’s called alchemist I think it’s called a shoe shop
The only word that can accurately describe Grian is “Gremlin”
Yooo the house loocks like a shoo
Brian you should put string on the warped vines so it doesn’t grow
Are you aware that converting copper to Cut Copper using the stonecutter gives _loads_ more blocks than if you use the crafting bench? This detail makes copper really not as costly as you made it out to be.
what
When he said "you're gonna be so proud of me" while walking past the house, I thought he'd turn around and say "the back is there too!" but hey, storage is good as well :D
Could anyone tell me what an amazing music Grian used in this video during base building? I feel like Grian decided to push soundtrack game way further this season, and man, I AM LOVING IT. Especially as I got a bit disappointed on few Hermits, earlier using a lot of varied soundtracks, on changing that into one "theme" song which is always used. That works for Scar, but I miss varied soundtracks from some other hermits :<
Make are copper farm
A day in my life:  1. Wake up 2. Breakfast 3. Watch hermitcraft 4. Cry because everyone is so much better builders then me lol
The storage house looks like a shoe to me! 😄
The house looks like horse
I’m so used to the hardcore series that my heart dropped when he jumped off the pillar. lol
who are you and what have you done to grian
Maybe for the empty spot by your house put a fountain or wishing well
Your videos are really cool
aqui esperando el proximo cap
Grian is a Pieoneer
8:30
Grian your chest house kinda reminds me of a lama
Appreciate Grian telling WHY he does things with a build, which is very educational.
Your funny
16:28 do the logs look like something else to you guys? 😳
Thank you for sorting your chest monster:)!!
This is bee abuse!
Grain is now organized?! He has clearly gone mad
I just noticed this go back to -8:30 to see it says “Badtimewithscar left the game”
"I apologise for stamping on your face" this should be in an out of context video
Who's house is that in the corner at 7:08 ? Haven't been keeping up on all the Hermits' series but interested to watch the building process behind that.
Why don’t you a coal farm from the wither  and sell coal blocks in the early game.
At 15:00 my first thought was about the torches lighting up the area.. and then I noticed that he moved all the chests
you should put your nether portal at the bottom of the stone cliff you have built on the edge, and have a secret pathway leading down there, kind of like a secret grove. - My Little Cousin Who Is OBSESSED With Your Videos
I am so proud of you getting organised
Feedback from an 8 year old fan:  "Your base looks like a shoe."  I don't know if he meant that as a complement or criticism, but he really wants you to know. So there it is.
I love your vids
Imagine if the Entity became another lore in Hermitcraft Season 9 like Season 8 with the Big Moon Incident
Don't let Iskall come over. He does not like Diorite
Grian get to the hospital, you are seriously sick if you are being organized
I’m super late, but maybe it would look less like a shoe if the swoop on the lower section curved down instead of up?
Your house looks like the boot from the fairytale
When he said "you're gonna be so proud of me" while walking past the house, I thought he'd turn around and say "the back is there too!" but hey, storage is good as well :D
I love Grian. He's given me so much inspiration for years now. But am i the only one who thinks this is the ugliest house he's ever made?
Love the starter house but a bit too much copper
the chest moster is beggining
Omg take the wither to the nether and have him look for NETHERITE for you!!!
I used iron golems above land but they didn’t help in the open 🤣
we missed ur gooood bye :)
"It's all labled!" *Who are you, and what have you done with Grian.*  15:12
Etho has been doing the iron gollum’s for years
"come on, you can do it!" *advert* WOW SCAR YOU REALLY DID IT
“Sus…super Sus.” -grian 2022
Reason nobody does that strat for killing the wither is because people are doing the end portal strat
Nice
If this is the timelaps song for this season im digging it its a banger
grian proud of himself because he removed all the junk, me proud of him because he finished the back
“A mildly inconvenient portal placement” - says the man whose portal was on top of a massive jungle tree for a whole season
15:11 Who are you and what did you do to Grian?!
flashbacks to when grian was invisible and spawned the wither in botem
Nobody gonna notice the two netherite bars on 1:50🤣
Did anyone else notice that on the bottom left side of the screen, at one point said, “BadTimeWithScar left the game”, ?

Somethings off he would never lable
i like the shoe house/ alchemist shack :D lol
20:55 ey you stealin my identity?
Now try it on bedrock
Grian : Why doesn't anyone do this! Me : Sure Grian, iron isn't expensive at all!
Bring back Pesky Bird
the thing im proud of is you did the back
Good organisation
You should have a light up base under the river!! Glass roof
Grian really built a rock and decided oh now im gonna make a boot for the rock
Grian is more productive in one video than I am on my world of 2 years
You arent pie heavy, youre "pie ous"
*when fighting wither with iron golem" Grian: WHY hasn't anyone thought of thiS?? impulsesv has joined the chat
He should call the house: Grian’s Shoe. (because it looks like an elf shoe. the shape and then the kind of curly thing at the end😂)
go to time stamp 0:02 lol
Grian is a Pieoneer
it’s a boot
Good job!!!!!!!!!!! On the sight lol 😁
My face hurts now T-T
Fame changes a person... Grian now has organised storage!
Your house looks like a cat. It has tail and everything.
your starter house looks like a snail in a wizard hat. incredible
Does anyone know if you can join this server?  With permission
You should try wither mining. Long straight tunnel and just let the wither chase you all the way down it
9:34 he sounds like Michael Jackson🤣🤣🤣
Anyone else see that Grian's starter base looks like a dog?
it's smarter to mine ores with fortune 3 and craft them into ore blocks when mining instead of mining with silk touch
I’m not a building expert, but I think the house would look better if you changed the chests into barrels
Just things I want to point out: 15:19 "Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo" 17:01 Scar's camera account is called "BadTimeWithScar"
I miss the clutter of chest monster
how long those chest gonna stay like that
Top room can be ur enchantment room
you should make a diary up in the tower of the study of the entity. e.g  i have found this rock and something feels abnormal about it. i have set up camp and have taken multiple samples and are now studying them .etc. yeah, that would be cool.
please make a weight scale rail to measure the weight of mobs, tell how many blocks are in a minecart with chest. Please do think of the amazing new contraptions that this could bring
Wither in the end can be killed with wasting wayyyyy less iron
Anyone realize in episode one he said he wasn't building a starter base!!??? 😂
Grian:precious pie My brain: pp
The new build looks like an elf shoe. Lol.
oh ask X if you could go and sell bundles
Docm77 : I am the greatest Minecraft I use science to break the game!!!  Grian : Hold my beer, while I watch these Iron Golems kill the Wither in 10 seconds.
It looks like a jesters shoe
I really enjoyed the interior tricks and tips
"Logs 2 Electric Boogaloo" lmao I love that
If it’s organized  WHERES GRIAN WHAT HAVE TOU DONE WITH HIM
"Am I that predictable?" Yes, massive assholes tend to follow their asshole-ish ways very tightly
I feel like there will eventually be a cult around the entity
The old Grian in the shoe
When Grian started teaching about building he sounded like Bob Ross
I love all the little tips!
Looks like the little old woman who lived in a shoe...
Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo.  Lovely homage to tag lol
Mumbo did the iron golem thin in season 2 or 3
Use blast furnaces so the copper goes faster
ooomg tune to that time lapse tho! so good!
It looks like a shoe.
👍
When he said that we would not believe what he did I thought he meant that he did the back of the base
Hmm some of Grian's inventory was just lagging itself into Scar's possession...
Mumbo as potato boi Iskall as carrot man Now grian as pie dude
One of these days you're going to missclick and accidentally spawn a Wither.
U know pirceing on a cross bow combined with a weakness arrow makes cureing a villager much easier
19:25 More inventory space you say :) check out Docm77's video
a livestream of grian just building on the hermitcraft server would be genuinely entertaining
someone once killed the wither with bees, so of course this works
Not only iron golems can fight the wither, bee's, and enderman can too.
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH GRAIN!
you could make a spyglass as a house :D
I thought the fishing rod string stuck to scars head was a peice of hair on my screen! And I tried to blow it off.. LOL!
I kinda don't like he's organised now :I
Grian, doc showed a way to get 4 extra inventory slots.
9:50 Because nobody have thought about it
Grian: "The second you load those villagers in, they get eaten."  Scar: "What do they taste like??"
Oh my friend try that on bedrock
I've seen someone do the golem thing a couple of years ago with an obsidian box FULL TO THE BRIM with golems. Needless to say, the wither died in 2 unison golem hits.
We are so proud Grian!!
15:44 were did those trap doors come from
I would love to use iron golems to fight the wither but it’s too expensive for me
ENTIDY= ROCK POTATO EPISOED 3
Wow... organised grian... haven't seen that in a while. And nice mlg water bucket
I always use iron golems for raids and wither fights tbh, am too lazy haha
Your house looks like a shoe
Grian : i love pie more than pork  Me : is that another hermithcraft war im hearing
Incredible build Grian! Beautiful and inspiring as always ☺️ I think you should be in charge of all Wither related adventures from now on 😂
Don’t get me wrong I love the house it’s so cool now that you said magician I see it now but at first I thought you were doing story telling and it would be the little old lady who lives in a shoe
11:23 superr suss
Dwayne?
Bro make a blast furnace
16:47 grian being the Bob Ross of minecraft building
Grian's base will now and forever be known as "The Alchemist's Shoe"
The"lets GO!" Never gets old
Again, thank you for using tuff, as it is my favorite block!
Da base
Grian: your going to be so proud I did the interior Me: he did back
i am a pie-ous man no temptation can stray me from the path of God
Grian: i want this house to look like an alchemist set up shop to study the Entity  Me: looks like a shoe
Does anyone here remember crafted bonus or crafted movie
The reason people don't do the iron golem strat is that u can just suffocate the wither under the end portal in the end, so it's just more resource efficient not to spend that iron on golems.
Yo I’m always scared to spawn the wither, I’m so gonna do this now!
He doesn’t know about Mumbo yet…😢
Do you listen to music while you build i like to listen to rock
The base looks like a small dog
i do
Anyone else notice scar said “what would they taste like” while grian and tango talked a out villagers getting eaten?
Later in the season: the house spoke to me it doesn’t want to be a house but a storage system
Grain!!!! You finally have got organized storage!! :)))))
Name the boulder dwayn
Grian is my kind of guy, a pie guy
"Its all organized" Yeah, lets see how long that lasts
when grian said that we were all going to be proud of him, I thought he was going to say that he finished the back
“Pie”ous for pies
When he said we were gonna be proud of him I thought he was gonna say he did the back of the house
I'm so proud of the labels!!!!
20:54 did he eat one of the porkchops
What im really proud of is that he built the back for once 🤩👍.
looks like a shoe. a really nice shoe.
you melted my eyes when you started smelting all of that copper with a single normal furnace
Poor Joe panicking in the chat during the wither fight
9:55 the youtuber SB737 actually did the same tactic i'm pretty sure
I’m more proud that you put a backside to the build
I like the mythical/fantasy type of style/theme of almost all the hermits' current bases
entity idea. if you start selling weapons, you can put a sword in the stone type design on the outside
If it hasnt been changed, you can actually make a wither thingie without making an actual wither, by pushing the last soulsand into place with a piston. removing the piston should not update it. Didnt get a chance to troll someone like that yet, but i did discover it, when trying to figure out a dramatic way to spawn a wither in front of friends. Not sure if it still works, it certainly did a few months ago.
I’m more proud that Grian built the back ☺️
One could say he’s a bit of a pieoneer
Nice mlg jumps
π π π π π π π π π π π π π π π π π π
Bro you can kill a wither with like full iron armor xd
Finished back of house? Organized chests? WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO GRIAN
As soon as he hit that mlg I liked and subbed
The reason noone uses golems is cuz brewing just 1 strength 2 pot is much better
Step nr1 of doing something more cozy: install shaders
Not only Pearl was high on stock of mushrooms, she was high on mushrooms herself
i think you can use an axe to mine heads faster
I feel like that in the process of recording this video, Pearl was on the mushrooms herself xd
Could you do a nether only world?
i feel bad for joe :(
around 15mins in starts talking about us being proud of him me: im just glad you actually did back
Grian pls start to upload more the other creators are on ep 5 and 6
Who’s that dog, Mr P(eanutB)utter!!
phoo pcheto my favourite block is a pumpkin and favourite food is pumpkin pie theres some one who sounds famiilar that eats pumpkin pie and its Grein
Impulse: "GRIAN! behind you!" Grian:" yea there is my base." Impulse: "JUST LOOK!" Grian: "i know there is a back of my base"
15:00 I thought he was going to say we need to be proud because he built a back to the house
Good job  Have a chocolate🍫
You should've tried placing lightening rods on your roof and using a channelling trident on them.
@Grian... I've been rolling for days but I can't find the perfect seed could you please tell me the seed you used for 100hrs hardcore
When is episode four coming out
it looks like a shoe
Wadzee out here crying because he spawned 100 iron golems to fight the wither
The Lizzie Memorial Iron Golem tactic! 🤣🤣🤣
Tip:anything will attack the wither because the wither attacks anything on sight.
Grian, my dude,  you are not stupid, you are awesome and goofy. Positive self talk only! You are such an inspiration for me in my Minecraft playing. I use it for a creative outlet and all of us need something like that in our life. Don't sell yourself short your creations are incredible and your pranks are genius. I can't imagine the pressure being a streamer can be. You got this though. Ok I'm only 2 minutes into the video and just needed to bombard you with happiness! Keep building!
im proud that u made the back of the build
What build theme is used around 13:26? It has the same kind of vibe as Scar's build music (Howling) and I would love to hear the full version.
Grian? Buddy? You know there's a better furnace to use for smelting metal right? Please tell me you know it exists...or at least it rings a bell
Fwhip made that house a year or two ago
Gran  mambo jombo afk search  it is your  song
So proud
"my default is stupid" same bro, same
shoulda made that house that shoe on the river in that movie
when is episode 4????
wait grian in creative mode on hermitcraft
great
Le gasp. No grian chest monster. Mumbo rich. What's next, scar becomes a pvp King?   This is a dark omen.
im not proud of the labeling. im proud of the back being done
I am proud of him because he made the back
Call it Merlin’s shoe hut
i use to use golems on withers LUL
Very nice house Grian
Little Old Grian, who lives in a shoe....
BRING BACK POULTRY MAN!!! Please
When he finished the house I was fully expected him to say "look you will be proud of me.... I've been  finished the back of it"
Boot home
Boot
Grians house looks like a dog
why would you spend 5 stacks of iron on iron golems when you could just beat the wither with iron armor
How did I miss this???
Iron Golems also kill the Warden.
Stacks of totems for scar are needed!
IT LOOK LIKE A BOOT

I love how Grian made this a building tutorial…
but us the back done
yoo grian is a 3.1415926535897932 man this is from my memory of pi
There was an old Grian who lived in a shoe.  He had so many kids,  he didn't know what to do.
Only took 3 seasons but the chest monster is gone
Your house looks like a cat with a witch hat
Grian is now Patrick
oh god he's addicted to pie
"sus, super sus"    -Grain 2022
Grian: what you're gonna be proud of is the fact that it's all LABELED~ Me: *sobs*
Hey grian you alright? Like your actualy organized is it actually you grian
Grian: some sorta alchemist or magician  Me: or a puppy
Iron Golems are just really expensive, way to expensive to be used on the wither, which is quite easy in a cave/the end is you want to cheese it.
15:14 Labeled AND organized? Who are you and what did you do with Grian?
i cant believe grian called scars beautiful portal an inconvenience
cant he just kill the wither y does he need golems
like there could be a natural fence
what if there were villagers who wandered around in the village
Grian do you have Facebook?
where is the man in the chicken costume?
And he did the back!
It only took me two days for you to become my comfort Youtuber :3
Scar is such a nice guy :) he tries to be mischievous and steal but he can’t
It's organised!
Grian you should make a lab and sell potions (slow falling for scar)
Hi Grian, after watching Luke TheNotable's 100 day in creative, I thought to myself, I wonder what you'd be able to build. Have you done something like this or would you like to do something like this?
"sus super sus" the way he said it 😂😂
Can we just appreciate the fact that he did the back of the base
The wither can be used to mass mine deepslate
am I the only one who saw the line on scar and thought of demon slayers
Grian! Your base reminds me of "the little old lady who lived in a shoe" I think it fits the alchemist theme but it also looks like a shoe and I love it 😋
its my birht day today
boot
The thing we are most proud of is the existing back 😂
Grian:Ur gonna be surprised about what I did! Also Grian: *builds back, doesn’t mention*
Grain what else can I do ‘bring it in bring it in’
Lol, everyone kills withers with iron golems
Sahara 2.0 plz
Why is this so easy to binge watch this series..?
Is Grian 7 hours ahead of Scar with time zones?
If you want to get rich gather shulkerboxes and sell them along side elytras
Grian there is a reference to you in terraria, in the top left it said terraria 2:electric boogaloo XD
Grians starter base really makes  me of that story with the old lady that lived in a shoe
G: “ as soon as you load them in they get eaten”  T: “ yeah, “  S: “ what do they taste like? “  Honestly scar is the greatest.  Someone asked so the time stamp is 23:43  Ik it’s annoying for some but holy moly how do I have that many likes? Thank y’all so much!
When I woke up I never would’ve thought to hear “im a pie guy” and say it for the rest of the day…
ya know I can see the pie vs pork war starting lol
If you ever do amass melting spree use the blast furnace it  smelts the items faster
We were on s7 last time i saw hc what happened 🫢😂😭💀
I am living for the orange and teal color palette! AHH ♥
who are you where is the real grian
GRIAN, make the attic your enchantment room !!!!👍🏻☝🏻😊
yeah I've been looking to buy some can I get a block's volume of 10mm rod length
The reason why people don’t use golems is simple, they are expensive.
Oh wait y’all didn’t use the Iron Golems? Damn I thought people genuinely used the tactics but fought it out in the open for fun with elytra and stuff
Am I the only one that sees grians house as a cheeky Chihuahua with a wizards hat? Just....it looks like a Chihuahua tail in back lol
not organized for long
To the mini game master of hermitcraft I have a proposal for you have you thought of doing the hermitcraft SQUID games 👀 give you an idea build a huge squid head inside the head build the levels of the games eg. Red light green light an the shoot the hermitcraft with a powerful bow an let the laughter begin 😀
Grian: “This build is intend to look like a magician or alchemist's house” Me: "Oh man, it looks like a Jesters shoe with a roof on it!"
"What do they taste like?" -Scar, 2022, contemplating delicious villagers.
@Grian instead of the lanterns hanging from the ceiling you can put floating candles, which i think would go extremely well with your magician/alchemist theme studying the entity
when he said tht you all are going to be so proud of me i thought he would isay i completed the back
I guess the reason most people kill the wither themselves is because you don't get achievements for golems killing it.
"im a pie guy" Hugh Neutron: You a me both brother
Can you do a mangrove/1.19 build tips and tricks
Off topic... do we know who replaced all the crafting tables with obsidian yet??
Idea: If you do Tag 3 a title could be Tag 3: Electric Jamboree
The creeper is sustainable
Ur not mlg god I mlg from 10k blocks high
I love voicemod so much, just hearing Scar's panicked voice popping in as he gets closer WHILE yelling at Grian is amazing.
I'm anticipating the announcement of tag 3
Grian, why don't you make yourself a sheild
Sell honey? Candles and wax? I want to see a honey grian build.
im kinda sensing a pie vs. porkchop war but who knows
hay Grian you sure Mumbo-jumbo didn't come over and organized your chest for you and why is there a crafting table on your roof of your starter house
What ever floatems your goatem on a boatem
16:28 sus?
im so proud of you grian (14:55)
15:16, I'm more proud that the back is done
impulse put an iron golem under the end portal to kill the wither in season 7
Did the front, back, and inside in one episode? Who are you and what have you done with our grian?
I feel mildly uncomfortable with Grian calling the boulder “the entity” because of a series of horror games I like called “mr hopp’s playhouse”
i LOVE the time lapse music!
Hey grian: if you see this, how do I join hermitcraft?
Please build a huge telescope pointed at the rock. It would be in the cartooney style of hermitcraft.😄
You need pie merch. Change my mind.
Ew grian stop being organised sucks
No more cheats monster!
the crafting table on the starter house's roof tho
Petition for grian to have a skin change for this season to gradually look more over weight as the season goes on due to the amount of pies he's eating.
Keep up the amazing work grian. I love your content so much and I can’t wait for the next episode.
Grian I'd like 5 banana cream pies.
Grian i have an idea for what you can sell for later in the season, a membership for the hermits to not get pranked but only sell 2! no set price so hermits will get into a bidding war, all hermits who make an offer and dont get the membership stillhas to pay half their offer
What about Tag Four: time for more But this time there’s two tags
MAN THANK YOU SO MUCH GRIAN YOU FINALLY BUILT A STORAGE THANIK YOUC SO MUCH NO MORE CHEST MONSTER:DDDD
He mined copper for so long that he went from fall to winter to spring in an hour🤣
Why does the house look like a dog to me?
16:02 - I feel like if Grian wasn't a Minecraft youtuber he would be an interior designer for houses and buildings.
Do you remember the pickle song?
You builted a little old lady shoe?
Grian going against blazes, without a shield 😭😭
NICE JOB, I love the fact that you implemented some organization. Here's hoping you can keep it going!
All I see in your starter base is a pointy elf shoe
Back back mod
God loves all of us so much He came in the flesh to die and rise so that if we choose to accept Jesus as our one true Savior turning from our sins we may be gifted eternal salvation through Christ’s perfect sacrifice on the cross. Have a wonderful day
Bro i swear the last video of this dude I saw was the last hermitcraft season 6 last episode it felt like a few weeks ago but it was a few years ago im so old dude I watched it when I was 14 im 17 now wth.
Poeple who tell their whole story may annoy you in the comments, but here it is. I started watching you in 2018, and now, after 4 years, im moving house, from the house that started the Grian tradition, to a new one. Hopefully there will be a plethora of Grian there too. Thank you for everything. :).
Does anyone else realize that mumbo, scar, grian, pearl, and grian have all gone with a blue theme this season?
If you are willing to add copper to your entity, you can make some sort of statue to like make it look more fancy or ancient
That storage system is sus. Where is Grian and what did you do with him?
USE THE WITHER TO FIND ANCIENT DEBRIS!!
You should make the thing for honey be a beehive on the tree
it is mostly building tips XD at about 75% in the video
If you guys are going to do another hafe life thing, can you use the origins mod, I think it can be interesting and once you Lose a life you get a new one.
there's a brazilian youtuber who made a afk nether star farm using iron golems like... 1 or 2 yers ago
Four hours or for hours?
How long does this stay organized
He forgot to mention that he finished the back lol.
grian u should make ur giga/mega base underwater. like if u agree
Grian is the Bob Ross of building
That how you strip mine. Summon a wither and make it follow you it makes a huge hole lol
“When Minecraft gives you copper, don’t sell it for diamonds. Make Minecraft take the copper back. Get mad. ‘I don’t want your damn copper, what am I supposed to do with these?’ Demand to see Minecraft’s manager, make Minecraft rue the day it thought it could give Grian copper. ‘You know who I am? I’m the man who’s gonna burn your house down with the copper. I’m gonna make Mumbo invent combustible copper and burn your house down’”
Grian: My default is stupid  Me : same
Grians house kinda looks like a boot lol
I have an idea for your starter base, im not sure how good it'd look but I think it'd be cool:  Have white stained glass or something like that under the copper because you want it exposed
I love the mini building tutorial! I’m struggling with it so that’s awesome
grians base looks like a the front of a steam train with a wizards hat on
I can't believe the iron golem wither kill actually worked!!
It’s been odd watching Grian and Mumbo each branch out into different aspects of the game each season but I love watching the talents for building/redstone they’ve gained
Keralis calls you Bryan :DDD
Hey i love your new starter base especially the gradients you used. Remember when on episode 110 hermitcraft season 6 you giys sent a few diamonds to season 7 for a nrw sahara. Well i was wondering what happened to those diamonds and will there ever be a new sahara project.
That build is gross. It's like you're trying to build like Scar, but fall way short.
grian: expects me to be proud abut the sorting me: is proud theres a back
Grian, I know you are a much better builder than me, but in your opinion does spruce, birch, and oak wood look well together? Because me and my friend have a really cool world where he does the redstone and I do the building, sorting, and villager farms. Also my build has a lot of dogs in it. Lol
Did you mean druid.
The reason people don't use golems is because the wither is a pretty easy fight if you have good gear. So it is a waste of iron and time to use iron golems but it is pretty fun.
GRIAN: AHHH AHHHHH IM NOT GONNA MAKE IT!!!! Me: *SPAMS SHIELD
11:21 NOOOOOOOO
It's much easier to just trap the wither under the bedrock portal
I had to catch up I started watching at season 7
every time that i talk be like 23:49..... totally not dying inside
whats your real name?
At 14:53 when he said "you guys are gonna be so proud of me" I thought he was gonna go around and show off the back
The little old Grian who lives in a shoe
grian's base kind of looks like a cartoonish pointy shoe
is it me or is that just a boot?
That first bucket drop was so smooth. Grian wasnt even looking at the floor until he remembered he had to
People don't use iron golems to fight the wither because in a tunnel like that its incredibly easy anyway, Golems just end up a waste of iron for something you can do in under a minute without them
Please
Bring back poultry man
During the forty days between Ash Wednesday and Easter the only time I can watch YouTube is on Sundays. And when I do it’s mostly Hermitcraft. Super awesome series! Keep it up!
Grian you should fill The Entity with amethyst so it’s like a geode considering that it’s hollow.
what is your house
Why it look like a duck 🗿
I've done the iron golem wither kill but don't do it because it's easy enough without them
Is he saying "umar" or "you mar" because I can't tell
Noone uses iron golems because the wither is so easy with normal things so noone wants to waste so much iron on iron golems
XD I thought Grian was gonna say at 15:00 that he did the back, but he did more. Good job Grian!
i have done the wither thing for ages... i thought it was obvious but ig not...
The Reason: People spawn the Golems in the same chamber as the Wither, THEN spawn the Wither.  The explosion kills the Golems, so people assume using Iron Golems doesn't work.
Why did you make a boot house?
Drowned farm? For copper
ur base looks like a shoe
For a second there I thought he gonna show us that he finished the back
I’m honestly surprised your home finally is proportional and has a finished back
I think that nobody else did that because before this update, it would just break through normal stone, and be above the iron golems, and kill them all
No one is doing the golem strat against the wither because killing it by yourself is faster if you have a minimal amount of skill
For one epesode can you be santa and scar can be your elf that would be soooo funny
Sad scar waiting for someone to answer "What do they taste like?"
Is it just me or does anyone else feel weird to look at grie- *clears throat* grian's face and not see a mustache?
Only thing i would do is change the floor to dark oak or deepslate or something
14:13 Why u floating??? LOL.
Your house is so...elven
Grian.can u do a tutorial in building
The house looks like a cat or a Pokémon
@Viniccius13 has a wither farm using iron golems
Anybody else love seeing grian giving scar anxiety? XD
If you  remmber Stampy's lovely world you're an OG
you are the first in hermetcraft to do this, i been literally been screaming at you to fight the wither in a cave! finally...
only minecraft pros fight the wither in a tight tunnel. examples fru xetro prode lukethenotable
Labeled items and the back is done? Who are you and what have you done with Grain?
Actually Grian, a guy called SwitchBackMongo did the iron golem attack
I have honestly been using iron golems to take out withers for years now.
am I the only one who thought the outro was absolutely amazing?
You need to use a blast furnace for your smelting
Grian: You guys are gonna be so proud of me! My immediate thought: You finished the back?!?!?
Still have the idea of grian and scar building bases that are the back of each other so no one has to build the back
I remember the mess that was season 7 Scar's wither, it was hilarious
10:03) Just imagine if there was a splash potion of milk in minecraft.
Yay! Labbeled chests
I am a grandpa and i watch grain's video every week i am 68 years old and i am enjoying every minute of your videos grain 😁😁
The reason people don’t use iron golems against withers is because it’s expensive in iron, and easy enough to do without them.
Did anyone hear scar saying “i wonder what they taste like?” When grain and tango were talking about villagers 😳
I'm using Shaders Minecraft java on my phone🗿
Now watch Mumbo wax the copper as revenge.
A piece of stone spoke to you? The entity can speak!?
Pls more EP I luv them
7:49  Scars voice fading in makes it even better
10th K comment, cheers!🍻
F
Possible shop name  "The copper boot"
i think people dont do it (the iron golem wither strat) because its pretty expensive? but even then its not a solid reason since people can just grind
I'm late
love the house looks like a puppy 😍
Did anyone notice the hole that the warped vines were going was a part of a pe**s 🤣🤣🤣🤣😆😆😆😆
Hey Grian can u do a tutorial for your house
Sword And Shield :No Sword And Pie: Yes
Using iron golem to kill wither  Java players:heck yeah😎 Bedrock players(which double the health of the wither):😐......
anyone other see a duck ? Like the house looks like a duck without a bill lol!!
Grian and Scar: Get the wither spawning achievement The entire server: *panik*
I’ve been waiting for a new episode finally =)
Grian you have a Tictoc acount?
What happened to the time machine? I mean you got it back but where is it? And if it’s destroyed why wouldn’t any one just rebuild it?
I was gonna say make your house on top of the rock you can make it like it hanging off the side of it some of it on top of the rock the part that is hanging off will have sport beams holding it up
Grian please don't use so tough english words man 🥴 I feel sad 😕
Season 7: episode 1 starter house Season 8: episode 2 starter house  Season 9: episode 3 starter house I’m seeing a trend I’m not sure I like
Wi hes hut
Ok im proue ofypi but stoll im syill made at you thow lol
He never fails to entertain us! :)
HE DID THE BACK!?
The Wither would not have died that easily in Bedrock
Talk to impulsesv about the iron golem help for the wither. He's been doing it since early seasons of naked and scared...
mumbo is so happy cause of your storage now
Ok, I can barely begin to comprehend that he actually cleaned up a chest monster, but SORTING IT?! Mind. Blown.
Diamond mining meta now includes wethers
23:51 scar said what do they taste like and I died
16:26 sus amogus
G's base reminds me of nursery rhymes - Old Mother Hubbard meets Jack and the Beanstalk
Grian for your tag game this season you should do something with trying to get something on people's heads
Grian: You guys are gonna be so proud of me! Me: Did you actually finish the back of the base??? :D Grian: There is nooooo random junk! Me: Nice, nice. Was hoping better Grian: It is all labeled! Me: I... I am so proud of you
14:55 I thought he was gonna say that he did the back for once. Lol
16:00 oh no, he’s becoming a life hacks channel
can you build the lungs of the "entity"?
I absolutely love this series!
Don’t yo mean in the rock not under it
That's almost Bdubs house from last season.
15:15 Is this the same person that had a chest monster for every storage room???
He went from rock, to street, to shoe       It looks like a shoe
I give the storage 10-12 episodes to become disorganized and chest monster like.
So I'm confused, does mining something with silk touch and then later with a fortune pickaxe get you more stuff?
There was an old Grian who lived in a shoe. He had so many chests he did not know what to do.
Grian, could you possibly do a video of what buttons you click to get all of one block with 1 click and stuff like that?
Looks like a shoe
the base is a elf shoe
the starter base, it is the shape of a elves shoe. Maybe Scar's ancestors.
16:28 no one else see the pp
Why didn't he use a blast furnace in the beginning
using a stonecutter, you can turn one block of copper into four blocks of cut copper
15:11 in a couple of episodes the labels wont matter.
Can't un-see the Lady who lived in a shoe vibe of your base.
Grian im proud of the fact you completed the back of your base!
Grian: look, look at my beautiful storage system, there’s no mess, it’s organised, it has labels… *keeps ranting* Hermitcraft S6 Chest Monster: haha, let’s see how long that’ll last
Sure hope Mumbo doesn't log on and revenge-wax all that copper
Good day to you Grian, the trickster of Hermitcraft . . . . . . I recall your aptitude for simulating the bodily functions of birds in previous Hermicraft videos . . . . . I also note that there might be a massive bird that could use some realism added to its surrounds . . . . . . just saying ;-)
not many people kill the wither with iron golem because it's expensive and time-consuming to make that many golems
hi grian!!!!
grian’s voice is so cute❤️❤️. i love your vids!!!!!!!!!
on my first 1.18 world, right below my base were not one, not two, but three massive copper veins. I barely dented the copper supply down there and I have a small chest of copper blocks.
Every time I see dark oak trapdoors I think chocolate bars idk why
I always love it when grian uploads been watching since the samg and tortoise days
I don’t think Grian knows about Tang’s copper farm
Sub to grain
Random thout while watching this , yt acuelly removed da thumps down why why would they it’s dum that they did
When I saw that your chests were organized I started clapping so loud my neighbors came knocking at my door thinking something was wrong.
I clicked on to this video to *continue* watching it and YouTube gave me an add, so I skiped it and moved on. Not even a second later it gave me a second add. Brow, what the F***!
Im so sad that mumbo is taking a month off, especially at the start of hermitcraft… but its ok because I still have you! 🙂
Tango made an op copper farm didn't he? I feel like copper is not gonna be worth an aweful amount this season..
Does anyone else miss the boatem pole/hole?!?!
But what ever happened to golden carrots?!?!
Amazing Shoe!
On the base grian could make a telescope focusing in on the rock to make it look like the magician/Scientist is strudyong the entity
I feel like you should have lived 'under a rock' but the starter base build is awesome
“It is all labeled!”  Okay, WHO BROKE OUR GRIAN!?
Wen are you going to post
grian's new house looks like a boot
Actually wadzee did the iron golems before, but he did 100 of them
Grains house looks like a dog with a hat and a blue tail
Am i the only one who didn't like the starter house? (From outside).. the inside looks amazing
You should me Tag for this season tag 4 electric more door
When he said you'll be proud of me I thought he would show us the back
IM BACK!!! (last time i watched grian was hercraft season 7 finale) ITS BEEN SO LONG
does your wife play minecraft with you!
I want more Hermitcraft.
HE NOT ONLY ORGANIZED, BUT ALSO MADE THE BACK OF THE BASE!!!!!!!!!!  IM SO PROUD
The old man in the shoe xD
GIVE BEAST PHILANTHROPY YOUR MERCH!
I don't know why. But the outside of Grian's starter base kinda looks like a shoe. Is that just me?
I’ve been watching you since Hermitcraft 6 I love your videos so much!
just proud he did the back for once!
Underground for a megabase
Your an imposter
Who r u your not grian
Is anyone getting hobbit Grian vibes
BTW I whaching season 7 I finished 6 yesterday
Oh well would you look at that Grian actually remembered to hide the chat
Grian please support mumbo
Grian how do you get all the mob heads that you get in hermitcraft
love the house its so wizard, the tips were really nice
Ben Hickling
Already got the chest monster
You should turn the wither hole into a sectret base for you and Scar. The Iron golems could be security
IT HAS A BACK good job grian
Grian is very pie-ous this season
I’m gonna give it 10 episodes till the storage system becomes a mess of random items
Unexpected Fear of the Dark at 06:40?
The base looks like a shoe
Grian: the creeper is sus   Mumbo: my base outline is very because it's sustainable
I guess you can say that Grian is **pie**ous
I want to see Grian become a elf with Scar
Anybody else during Timelapse’s just stare at the campfires in the chimneys😂
What's the song during the time lapse about half way into the video?
I'm more proud that he did the back of it
When he said we would be proud I thought he ment that he did the back
Halo green. I can't say ur name properly sorry but ima call. Ya green... Sorry...
Grian: THERE ARE TO MANY OF THEM! me: *Facepalm* Why soaent he use a shield...
did grian just finish the back!?!?
The first lesson when going hunting for blaze rods in the nether fortress: Bring a shield, gosh dang it!
There once was a Grian who lived in a shoe.
Levers flicked up under the floating chests would look really nice.
Can i join hermitcraft grian?
No bring the chest monster back
HE SAID SUS!
Honestly I thought Grian was gonna say "you guys will be proud of me because .... because I did the back."
Grian you can just build a drowned farm to get copper ingots with the addition of tridents and nautilus shells. Judging on how many shells you need I think it's a good investment!
Everyone loves Grian but What happened to grain
"Why is noone doing this" -everyone who kills wither like that combined with trapping him in end portal
bill nye the pie guy
Is it just me or does Grian's storage house looks like a duck without a beak? O.o
It looks like the house from that book with the lady that lived in a shoe. I guess its the Grian that lives in a shoe now
Oh wow... I guess I just never knew just how OP golems are. :O Makes me sad my server has mob greifing off
10:00 *me crying in bedrock*
Viniccius13 is a brazilian youtuber who makes a automatic wither farm with iron golens, it's just beautiful
I’m more proud you finished the back
"who doe snobody do this" BRO WE DONT HAVE 79834652798346507 IRON BLOCKS...
and here i'm remembering impulse doing a 3 man work in one episode
15:24 Where is our old Grian, thats has always monster chest in every hermitcraft?
Dose he realize he can just go to the end and spawn it under the portal then it can't attack at all
Grian, maybe the reason you are eating Pie is because on the 14th it was Pi day!
did anyone see the box labled "logs 2:electric boogaloo?"
If you spawn the wither on obsidian under the bedrock portal in the end it takes suffocation damage and if you hit it, the fight will take 1 minute at most
Im just happy that is has a back
iron golems can be used in a nether star farm (wich is probably the most masochistic thing you can do in minecraft, since you'll be needing a wither skeleton farm) and they actually tank a good bunch of withers before getting too low on health
Does anybody what texture pack he is using?
Wouldn't be the first time grian let a wither run rampant on the server
BRING BACK POULTRY MAN
I just realized the withering heights pun
Great job organizing your stuff grian! Love the videos!👍👍👍
Instead of a giant mega base could you do some sort of village or what not
This build kinda reminds me of you and scars starter base in last life season 1
“You’re gonna be proud of this” Because you did the back? “I have a storage system” Guys I think Grian is being infected by the normal virus..
most people dont use iron golems cuz you can trap the wither under the dragon nest which is way cheaper and less risky
Little too close...
send my wishes to mumbo
Tell me wy is there a back????!!!!!
Little did Grian know that there is a whole  wither farm using the iron golem
Grian : let's get us some coving 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Heal the iron golems and charge people to use your wither killing facility.
On top of the ‘entity’ you could add a portal that’s connected to it
Maybe you could make a civilisation of mini rock creatures underground with farms, machines etc
The reasoning behind no one using the iron golem thing is: 1) it's not fun 2) there are easier ways to do it if u want to cheese it 3) requires a lot of resources if u wanna mass produce
People don't use iron golems because it's basically just as fast to use a sword and it costs so much iron
20:50 you're very pious man. I know.... I'll shut up.
This is Grians Loot Boot
Has anyone noticed that scar’s name is GoodTimeWithScar and not GoodTimeSWithScar
Lets just take a moment to be proud of grian- that organisation is class . 👏👌👍
its more efficient to just dig a long tunnel and hit it as it comes to you like you did at first because it is still faster and golems take up unnecessary resources, although, if you do the under the bedrock strategy in the end then you can spawn golems that can stay there for everyone to use and it is very fast
Does anyone notice anything different from the thumbnail? The corners have black shadows
HE DID THE BACK
Grian: “what you’re going to be proud of is that all my stuff is organised.” Me: It’s not like I’m not but I’m more proud of the fact that you’re doing the backs.”
Make the top room of your base into a brewing room it just fits
I love it how during the outro, the villager is walking around eyeing Grain, getting very sus ^^
I really like your build styles but this house? It looks like the Mad Hatter moved into Jesters patched boot.
Use a blast furnace my friend 2 times faster
Live on a boat
Grian now : Look :0 are you proud? I’m organized!  Grian in the future : Chestmonster 4.0
Were is mumbo jumbo
i low-key enjoyed the music you had playing while you were building your adorable little cottage 😁😁😁
The house looks like a shoe
A tip for the blaze is to hit them on at a time with your axe
I wonder what the next thing of the entity will be
planete
Grian do you know that if you put an item frame on a copper block then hit it with a channeling trident the copper will immediately age.
I only do the iron golem trick
Great job organized Amazingly
Howd u have sooooo many copper?
I’ve seen people use iron go so many times it’s old news it is that really seem like thousands of times already unlike you two and hard cur series and stuff like the The boss is easy even on like bedrock I play Minecraft on my phone
the lore tho 😂
I can now say Grian is adicted to Pies... Help Him
He actually built the back of the base, Im so proud
Im gonna be honest when he began to say that we were going to be proud of him i thought he was about to say that he made the back of the builiding
How do I learn to be a master builder like you? Or at least to be decent at building
Make a wither skeleton farm
I believe Etho used iron golems in one of the seasons....I don't remember which or if he did or not.
So there’s a thing called a shield
is everyone going to look over the fact that Scar wondered what the villagers tasted like
impulse is gonna be mad for the villager trading hall and the raid farm.
Just recently started watching your videos again haven’t been watching since hermitcraft 7
❤️
I like that it has a back but it looks like a elf’s shoe
Center click on your mouse and if you have a block in your inventory and you center click it will move it to a free HUD space.
Grian: You'll be proud! Me: He finally built the back of a base :o
Grian's starter base reminds me of one of those fancy Persian shoes with the toe tip curled up.
Looks almost like scars base in last life
why are u not bringing a shield if u go to the nether? >_< those Blazes (aswell as alot other mobs) are realy nasty and losing gear even before its perfectly enchanted that would be quite the shame... hilarious for sure, but a shame ntl * *^^* *
I thought he we gonna say your gonna be so proud I built the back
Me: *Sees a Vault Hunter Episode from Iskall on multiple Hermitcraft episodes*  Also Me: IM SORRY ISKALL YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR NOW I KNOW ITS BEEN A WHILE IM SORRYYYYYYYYYY
Reminds me of scars house in season 8
What's going on with mumbo
isnt Iron golems expensive?
15:55 Mini Interior Design Tutorial with Grian
Grian, you can place an item frame behind the signs to make the chest labels more cool
Starter house looks like a train and a shoe. A choo-choo shoe
Family is the answer to everything
Can’t you lead a boat if you can to help travel villagers try to put one in a boat lead it and see if you can ride your horse with a lead boat
Might I suggest holding a shield in your offhand? It’s probably a more effective blocking method that’s pies. :/
8:14.4
8:14
how Americans say Golem  Grian: GOleeem
Can you do something underneath the bolder/rock
😆  yes it is organized
That waterbucket jump was incredible! you should have joined gem and jevin when they tried to get the achievement for that and none succeeded
noone uses iron golems for the wither cause its too much effort when you have god gear,
16 Copper Blocks for 3 Diamonds That may be a good price
Me and friend have used iron golems to kill the wither for the past year or so since the second time we killed them on our server.
Bro what happened to shopping districtd
Am I the only one that uses a cauldron to make weakness arrows instead of splash potions
could’ve said “i’m a pie-ous man” but no. You said “I’m a pie guy”
Thanks for the building tips!! Great episode!!🖤
Grian we are a like in a bad way we both have chest monsters
Scar said it best your base is a white cat dressed as a wizard lol
There’s a back!!
Who are you and what have you done with Grian 15:21
I just thought of a little story for Grian, if whoever is studying the entity, it should be an egg and as the season goes on the egg will crack and a monster with tentacles will slowly come out and people will think it’s a scary monster but it turns out to be cute
Impulse did it in hardcore
Grian: “This build is intend to look like a magician or alchemist's house” Me: It looks like an Elves shoe
I feel like these resources Towers that the hermits do are just a way of begging to lose a ton of items. Just do that crap on the ground and make sure none of it despawns!!!!
What is the seed of the world generation and coordinates to the area that you guys find that beautiful flat places? Not asking for the server code or IP, just want the seed 🙂
THE CALCITE GRADIENTS NEED TO STOP
How is everyone going past when at 23:51 Grian is talking about  "As soon as you load those chunks the village gets eaten," "What do they taste like" - Scar THAT WAS SO FUNNY WHY IS NO ONE REACTING PLZ
Grians starter build looks like the Shoe from the women with so many kids in a shoe story
Is it just me, or is Grian's starter base kinda looks like a dog?
He built a shoe..
14:24 That's a horse with a hat
British Pie my guy. (American Pie Abreviation)
YOUR starter house and MY starter house look VERY different
I’m more proud of you building the back than the storage
I can already see another chest monster forming
if anyone goes to 16:15 there is something in the middle bottom screen lol (PS look at the dark wood)
well done grian you have made us proud
I think VintageBeef did the iron golem trick in season 7
The flashbacks to build school when you did interior <3
I DO THAT  but under the bedrock in end so they dont die
Impulse did the golem/wither thing
Anyone else's see Grian toss is pickaxe?
ngl, it just looks like a shoe to me
I have been trying to watch this video since u uploaded it and my mum Is torturing me and whenever I wanna watch it she blocks YT from my phone and I can’t watch it I am only 5 mins through it
You’re making copper wrong, you need to make the bean blocks first, and smelt the bean block
Bruh
Grian! Your starter base has a back! Congratulations!
So Grian obviously isn't subscribed to Impulse
At 17.01 it says bad times with scar leg the game
7:53 Joe's little 'good for you? maybe?' He knows lol
Maybe you the pie situation have something to do with pie day?
Finally 😀😀
base look like shoe
A shoe yet he makes it look amazing
You should put a string on the warped vine so it doesn't grow any more.
You could just fight it in a box with a bow and a good axe or sword even with diamond armour just run away and eat and whittle it down no need to waste the iron
Who are you and what did you do with grian
I’m so proud of you ( as long as you actually use it)😁
I have
It looks like a boot :b
I was more proud about you made the back !
I love that the totem particles appear before he actually hits the ground 😂
I  guess you can say he is a pie-adebic
Grian's all grown up. finally sorting
Grian actually may have made something smart, one of the easiest ways to kill the wither. Without any special hacks, and you could do it pretty early game. Mine down to deepslate, slap down 4-10 iron golems and boom, nether star within 1-2 minutes.
Lol, I just watched False's video ending with her opening a c̶o̶p̶p̶e̶r̶ I mean bean shop, then straight onto yours opening with you mining copper to sell in a shop too
you need to make a small little hobit hole like in season 7 but in your shop I think that would look really cool it could double asa supply closet to :)
That’s a shoe
Grian's base is now officially the elven shoemakers hub of scars elven village
I'm proud that the elven shoe has a back to it.
your base/ storage house thingy looks like noah’s arch a bit lol
Well Done Your Video Is Great
I feel like it would be cool if you had made the entity have roots
the house looks like a boot
its not who is portrea man its where
You should have some sort of connection with the boulder if you want to make it seem like the wizard is studying it  Maybe leave some "magical" instruments around the boulder, lecterns around as if you're recording your findings on this entity
At list you complete the back
Wadzee actually did the iron golem thing a while ago
Grian: "We havent been over there- when you load the chunks they just get eaten" Scar: "I wonder what they taste like-?"
The wither spawn was prevented by the last head being placed in a different orientation to the rest, not the torch. Withers will spawn regardless of lighting, blocks, or entities near them, but placing a skull in a different orientation prevents them from spawning in.
SCP-9322: The Entity
To kill withers, spawn them underneath end portals. (In the end, not strongholds)
grain your house looks like a large shoe
0:32 *I literally just subscribed for that mlg* *gg bro*
Bring Back Poulty Man
You should do better minecraft you will love it
could you use a wither to mine?
Also, how can anyone eat an entire pie in just 1 second??
You could set up and live in a mini house or a tent on the boulder and then people can buy kits to make the mini houses or yents
11:17 the creeper was waiting in the trees to attack Grian for the clout of being in the video
Oh boy this should be interesting
Looks like your living in a shoe
12:13 Patrick Star would say otherwise.
It wasn't the torch that stopped it. It was because you put the head backwards
The Bob Ross of Minecraft building
I’m astonished that grian actually made SORTED CHESTS?
me whos still waiting for hermitcraft to use cake as currency
The entity = asteroid? Coincidence?
people, do the benny worm lyrics in this reply section of this comment
At 14:58 I thought grian was going to say he did the back.  Still good job grian
Before you sell copper, Tango made a really good copper farm
0:19 building a pillar like this is very ineffective since you first have to jump in order to place a block. If you gradually build up the layers by going in a grid like 5x5 or whatever, you'll place all your blocks faster.
"The Entity" is a giant Grey frog
Grians base is a roller skate/shoe
Patrick made it work so why cant you
Grian+Elf=Grelf
😃
grians storage room looks like a wizard llama
the house kinda looks like an elf boot
I love how Grian says 'my starter house' in the title but it has been a bit of time.
"Im going to sell Copper". - Grian Earlier... Tango: 1800 ingots per hour insane farm.
If yes tell me how to get on?
man i thought this was supposed to be a starter base he litrly built a-a i dont even know
Grian: You're gonna be happy that it's all labeled Me: nah nah, I'm more impressed that the back is FINISHED?!?!?
Who else is guna use iron golem for withers now? Lol.
Can I join the hermitcraft?
Grian literally just made a lama house :)
I feel a bit bad watching this after seeing Impulse and Keralis' latest episodes. Grian is selling wood but Keralis is selling it cheaper in a wood shop. Grian and Scar want to do a villager trading hall but Impulse just got all the enchantment books that its possible to get. Im still super proud of him for the organised storage and doing the back of a base!!!!!
Grian: Its a stotage room Me: A *glorified* storage room.
your starter house screams "troublesome gnome" to me, and I think it fits you well :p
I love to see green trying new building themes does feel more like a gem build but still love it!
lol
grian u live in a shoe :D
Clap chain for organized Grian 👏👏
Grian is just asking for credit in minecraft history 10:29
Iron golems v Wither is a great idea, but I choose the easy way: spawn the Wither below the end portal in the end and just hit it with a sword while its head is trapped in the bedrock above.
Smite axe is way quicker, I've killed 10 in like 45 seconds (per) and it only travelled/blew up an area twice (in deepslate)
I'm soo proud of you!!!
grian. grian. youve made a shoe. grian. Its a shoe
i love how every time i watch grain it makes me want to build
15:15 look at that BACK Grian!
FOR THE NEXT SEASON OF 3RD LIFE IT SHOULD BE CALLED “No Life”
I'm away from home studying and yout Minecraft video lift up my mood and make me forget mu homesickness.
People usually do this in nether star farms
BUILDING TUTORIAL MID-EPISODE IS BACK BABY
16:16 GrIaN SuS?!.!.,
I've done the Golem tactic before, just didn't have a yt channel then, and then i didn't think of making a video about it
i saw the yumars post on ig and when i saw the thumbnail i was literally thinking like is it posible bro is that the same house and wow yes it was omg i dont know what to say
You should get with a few Hermits and oeganize a parade or the like.
Poor Scar is going to have anxiety after this.
I miss mumbo
the elevated area to the right of the entrance in the entity couldve became a sort of balcony with your stuff, bedroom, etc with the area below still being a shop
@Grian Oh So u like Pi? Name every Digit.
You should make a tutorial on how to make your not so starter base
To Me The Storage Room Kinda Looks Like A Dog
i hope you have a great sassy baka  day
good to see he still has a chest monster
People kill wither that way for more than 4 years now , normally you don’t need golem you don’t even take damage if you good enough
people dont do it because its expensive
PaulGG and PainDomination (not too sure about him) did this before with the iron golems 😅😅 I’m sure others have done this online
Why does Grians base look like a chicken!
Pretty sure tango and others used iron golems in combination with the end portal obsidian trick but I’ve never seen just spamming iron golems in a mine to take on the wither
the smeagol of pies
Could this lead to vanilla minecraft having a wither farm for the first time in youtubes? (I think)
Anyone else just feel like Grian is living in a shoe? Just me? Okay.
HE HAS FINALLY MADE A BACK!!!!

Grian: Makes a starter base  Me: Why is it a shoe?
I think the reason people do not use iron golems against the Wither is because there are much simpler ways to cheese the fight *cough* bedrock *cough*
Sorry but i can’t be the only one that thinks grians starterbase kinda looks like a boot 😂👍 looks nice
❗*Friends, welcome to my channel!*❗  Incoming calls, screen recording of new and old models, reviews, ringtones! Beginner girl blogger, support with likes, I will be very grateful to you! New video every day))
Grian: "it is all labeled" me: "the back is done"
I love your videos they are so interesting and fun to watch
0:33 WHEN HE DID THIS I HAD A HEART ATTACK CAUSE IM SO USED TO THE HARDCORE SERIES HELP
with the entity, you could have a storage room underneath for stock and the conduit in the middle. it could look really cool
Is anybody gonna say Grians functional base looks like a Huge elf shoe?
Grian is gonna get mind controlled by the entity  I'm calling it now Thank me later
9:26 Why don't you use a wither for mining for diamonds, because it can break deepslate much faster.
Rip iron pickaxe
🏠=🥾
They don’t use the iron golems because iron
Grian turns into Bob Ross while building.
Reminds me of bdubs base 2 seasons ago
I'm not proud of the fact that everything is labeled, I'm proud of the fact that he finished the back
How old are you you act like you 23
name a better trio: mumbo, grian, scar. I'll wait
You two scar and you should make a shop for killing withers for 25 or more diamonds
Everytime I hear 'The Entity' from Grian, I think of Dead by Daylight.
15:10 I am proud of the fact that you made a back
Grian : Living under a rock is not a good idea. Zedaph : Let's live under a rock!
an elf shoe
20:30 Grain talking about how much he loves pies, and oly eat them. A cut later seems like theres a pork missing.
14:14 looks like a duck
If grain wanted suggestions for a starter base I would of said a hobbit house  What about you
Would have been great if there was a bug that eliminated anything stopping that Wither spawn...
POV your grain: AM GONNA LIVE IN A ROCK a few days later AM GONNA LIVE IN A HOUSE WHAT LOOKS LIKE A SHOE 👞👢👞👢
19:15 The crafting table on the roof is a nice touch :P
15:10 omg and the base also has a back impossible
Nobody does this cuz a lot off ppl can slay it without golems. It takes time and netherite armor it is so ez
14:55 When he said that we will be so proud of him I thought he was going to say that he made the back of the building
the entity is an scp
Impulse already did wither fight with golems in this season 9, you live under a rock Grain. 😂  I believe that impulse used 24 golems.
Grian is a pierate
Grian the Green Goblin
A multi-item sorter would probably be more zen for you. They take a lot fewer resources than the so-called bulk-item sorters, and you don't have to dedicate a whole chest to each type of item. Any bulk items you would need to store separately, or maybe add bulk storage later on.
Impulse has done the gollem thing with the Wither!
Grian: Happy about the storage Me: Happy he did the back
*everyone else*: yes i made my starter base *grian*: R O C K
Pieism vs Pigism
When you said I'd be proud, I thought for sure you'd done the back of the base. Guess I was wrong!
I love how worried everyone is about grian spawning a loose wither. Everyone's heard about the boatem incident lol
Your house looks like a shoe, I like it.
Every once in a while my brain just says.. "no way they didn't go into creative for all those materials!" And then I realize I can only play for like 2 hours and this is their job haha. Love the content brother.
WHAT IS SONG 13:30
9:56  wadzee: am I a joke to you XD
Im so happy right now because i came from the ski with school and i found out that my favourite youtuber(s) made new videos <3
Grian, for the love of God, please use a blast furnace or two if you really want to smelt and sell copper.
People don't use golem because the wither is easy for anyone who is good at minecraft (other than building cause your good at that)
I love the house but now that I've seen that it resembles a Jester shoe just a little I can't unsee it.
20:50 Grian missed the perfect opportunity to call himself a Pie-oneer
My soul almost left my body when Grian put that 3rd skull on lopsided.
Yay Grian! You made a back to your house!
Thought the title said "My Stalker House." Was super confused for a second
I believe you should make the villager farm a store, But instead of paying to use the villager ( lol that sounds wrong) you pay to enter, I'd say about 5 diamonds per entry? And you'd put the diamonds into a chest and it'll open the door. Now let's say someone had forgotten to get something, they'd have to repay the entry fee. Make one piston door the entry and one door the exit. I hope that all makes sense 😅
17:02 wait what Badtimewithscar???
He says: look, look what I did! Me thinking: Made the back? He says: There's no random junk  He says: What you're gonna be proud of is... Me thinking: There's a back? He says: It's all labeled!
My brain saw the starter base saw a shoe, and now I can't stop thinking Grian lives in a starter shoe.
My guess is nobody does the iron golem because it's too expensive. You need iron for anvils, which break. Maybe they want to spend the iron on other things. Like hoppers, Anvils.
I have a idea for the new tag…  The tag will be decided on by you or maybe a pole???  The whole server will have a meeting and choose a trademark curse of binding item. For an example, let’s say you chose a CoB (Curse of binding) golden chest plate to be your item so people will know that they got tagged by you. No players can have the same EXACT type of armour and resource. Like scar and you can’t have a diamond armour as your trademark thing. You maybe will stick with the diamond chest plate and scar might change to gold.  The way to tag someone is to get your curse of binding on their person in a creative way. If you get tagged, you have to wait a episode to tag someone else. At the end of the season, people will add up and count how many times they got tagged by which item and whichever item has the most ‘tags on them’ wins and gets the spoils. Also at the beginning of the tag when everyone decides they’re item they bid on who’s item will have the most at the end of the season. Kinda like a horse race or sports bid. (People cannot vote for themselves)  Please tag people in a creative way and have fun doing so.  If you think this is a good idea please like so Grian can see and I have more chances to have my idea of The Curse of the Three Musketeers to be decided upon.  If Grian does see this and pick it, thank you and I love your videos!!! (Please let Grian see this this took a whole 4 hours for me to come up with)
Since no one kills the wither with iron qolems why don't you start a business selling wither stars?
When he said you’re going to be proud of me I thought he was saying that he did the back.
I knew I should have checked yesterday!
15:12 Honestly I am more proud that you did the back
Dog(like) house
Damm he finished the back
Try to fight whither in bedrock, you'll be surprised         [Its like 10x harder and can one shot full prot 4 netherite(atleadt on our server)]
You're lieing Grain! 15:19 Why are you telling that, you haven't been disorganised since you made an itemsorter... JK
I get WAY too excited when Grian uploads lmao
wheres the mini game?
GRIAN. A talking boulder entity god is the main character from a book called THE RAVEN TOWER by Ann Leckie. READ IT!
why would you make bdubs themed house
The three musketeers grian Mumbo and scar
You should become a rock Human
It looks like a boot to me Grian's Booty
Yo I am soooo proud of you since I have been watching this series since the beginning and you've never organized or even bothered to but this is amazing and It needs a moment of silence 🤟❤
Grian! You organized it! And all on your own! We are proud!
Hey grain just for a tip tip to make the house a little bit better you can make some vines with spruce leaves on the house, but If you don't like it you can put spruce leaves on the bottom of the house like bush's or you could do both
I must say the color gradient for the starter “storage” is kinda impressive
I thuoght ur not gana build a starter house
Grian should become one with the entity, growing with it and maybe joining it on having different things attached to it, that'll be interesting
probably's been said but ethoslab uses iron golems that way
It’s a shoe
Wait where did Grien go?
So Is the war on the server this time gonna be over pie and pork?
About the wither thing you know there is an even faster way to kill it with dripstone
Love the starter base 👌. But I think the change from copper to warped stem planks is WAY too sudden.
I want send a sincere thank you to you and to the other people on your channel. My 11 year old twins love Minecraft! They've tried watching/following others who do what you do, but I've always had them stop watching because of foul language, or things I've seen or heard during others' videos. I don't worry with you. I constantly hear giggles from the living room and it's adorable. 🥰   I appreciate all of you! The level of respect that you have for your viewers/subscribers is amazing, and you're in the minority by using clean language. We have, already, run out of videos! They also have tshirts from your channel! Fan kids for life!! 😊
No one does it with the wither because the wither isn't hard on java, like at all, so its not worth the resources for the golems, you can literally just kill it with a diamond sword and infinity bow with ease lol
Oh no I can see scar doing some Lord of the Rings stuff.Also if scar does do this I can see Grian as the hobbit.
If you stare at scars minecraft skins face for a while it starts to become creepy I don’t know why but the smile and eyes is just unsettling
Is it just me or does the starter house look like a lama/alpaca
Good job Grain, you labeled, put everything away, and finished the back, you deserve a applause.
The base is a duck
The tower needs a clock. It definitely looks like a clock tower to me
Grian:wither can be taken down in second  Meanwhile in scicraft:killing 45000withers in one hour
17:02 badtimewithcscar left the game
you may want to remove the crafting bench from your roof, it interferes with the styling of the roof..lol
I forgot Grian was good at building
15:17 What did you do with Grian?! Who are you!! Are you GriAn??
Grian no offense because I like the build and would never be able to do that but it looks like a dog. I don’t know how fully but from the side it looks like a dog.
I'm more proud that grian did the back
Goood i have covid again
i always do it that i made a wither boss spawn chamber and connected it to a iron golem spawner and its always been easy in fact its so efficient that i spawn in multiple wither boss cause theres alot of iron golem and it gets alot easier to ill them
Make rock be smash house
22:26 sus hahahhahaha
i Really like how Grian integrated some really good building advice in this video , I hope keep doing this.
16:34 grian elric
i think people dont do the iron golem against wither technique because i dont see people wanting to spend 20 iron blocks just to kill a wither where in the right circumstances you can kill without wearing amrour and using just a fist
I really loved the tips and tricks! more more more!
it looks like a llama with a hat.
I thought when you were gonna say you guys are gonna be so proud of me, that you'd say I DID THE BACK! lol
How tf did scar get elf ears?
grian: youre going to be proud of my chest sorting me: wow u actually finished the back! im impressed
I think quite a few people use iron golems for withers, but its just cheaper and easier to do it under bedrock anyway
'The entity' makes it sound like an SCP or creepypasta. Now I'm thinking of what horrors a sentient  rock can inflict, apart from driving squidward insane.
To be honest, pillaring up ores isn't ideal.. try making a 2 high block platform of ores on the ground
Working on a gradient is a mess on a inventory lol
I thought I'd be proud that the back of the base is done. 14:56
That house looks like an elf boot
Give the entity a rib cage to protect it's heart.
15:23 WHAT DID YOU DO TO THE REAL GRIAN
Grian: there is no random junks  The next ep:
In my hardcore wrlod i live in destroyed black smith house
Grian you should use weakness arrows instead of splash potions of weakness.
Nobody does the Iron Golem thing with the Wither because it requires SO MUCH IRON
I love how everyone's really going in on the food sources. Giga pies, tommy's legendary carrots, now the pig pen and soon scar's cookie empire.
Scar: "Im just following your butt." Grian: "What do you think?"  Scar: "It's adequate."  Grian:"Well im going to do some squats tommorow."
Grian at 3:08 : forgets shields
looks like a cat
the house looks kinda like a shoe. i like it
Episode 3 and you have a chest monster, sadly I’m   not surprised
16:10 they are called partitions
thank you for apreciating the pies
All i will say is - WHAT IN BLAZES!!!
Etho did this ages ago last season under end portal with like a bunch of iron golems
I think I’m more proud of Grian for finishing the back
NO CHEST MONSTER
Grain beacon also sound like heart
You should add chains for the “hanging affect.”
17:00 BadTimesWithScar left the game
The look on my face when I saw grians stuff all organised
Grian: were going to work togethe-uur why did you get here in the middle of the day?
pie
Your house looks like a dog or a llama don’t want to be rude
Scar straight up asked what a villager tasted like.
I’m so proud of you
9:53 The reason is that for most minecraft players iron golems are expensive.
Season 6: Ocean monument Season 7: Hobbit holes Season 8: Mountain cave Season 9: SCP base
You mean you've never been this organised since Zed cleaned up your base
the chest monster was slowly growing
don't read this comment
I thought at 14:55 he was going to show us that he did the back, because we all know that It's pretty exciting when Grain does that! Also double up your methods!
no ones commented on the but joke- the butt joke had me wheezing
15:00 I thought he build the back
Why people dont this is cuz its to expensive and u can kill it under the endportal
That whole time he thought we were proud of him for building organized storage, but we’re just proud of him for building a back
Can't wait for random challenges and games that will come in this season.
Future grian: Copper vs iron war
Is there such thing as wither mining?
Grian talking about details, telling a story with building, and doing the back.  Me: who the hell is this guy
Can we please get the villager "HELLO" resource pack back?
about the wither thing most people ususlly spawn the iron golems in the same box as the wither so the iron golems attack him when the wither is charging and when the wither finally like blasts the iron golems near the wither die by that blast
ngl the base kinda looks like a medieval jesters spike shoe but a hightop boot type shoe with the spike kinda like the old witches shoe house tale thing lol.
Grian's elf slipper with the elf hat is looking great
So grians base is a panda or dog alchemist so is he a panda or dog
Pp
Grian : " but guess what you guys are gonna be so proud of me " for finishing the back right? Grian : " look look look I moved all of my junk! " yeah but that's definitely not gonna last the whole season XD  You did finish the back though and that's why we're proud of you!!!
I anticipate the advent of a Wither Mining being used to really open up Deepslate in a hurry. Not much better then a two-by-one mineshaft but it's a little bit better and you get neatherstars out of it as well.
WOO!! #17 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING IN MY COUNTRY!! KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK GRIAN
I saw a castle with a view, fields of bamboo, guy from kung-fu, a giant screw. A Kangaroo some chicken stew and a Grian that lived in a shoe
Grian: I'm not gonna build a starter base   Also Grian: ...I can explain
Grain does hermit craft have wars?
Grian u do know mumbo can just wax some of ur copper Blocks and then they won't age it'll be the tree farm all over again
Grian so proud of himself. So cute.
we need barge 2.0!!
Bro this is #46 ON GAMING JEEZ
Thx you for posting this on my birth day march 16 :)
you even built the back!
Sorry I am late Grian :< I will Subcribe, Like, And Turn on all the notifications :D Hope you forgive meh ❤️
im so proud of you for sorting your items early this season.. amazing starter house.. 😁
Quick! Place bets on how long this storage system lasts!
it seems like every season the hermits find a  weird way of killing the wither. in a previous season they killed it with STALAGTITES?!
It looks like a boot
grian, 1 copper ore have a chance to drop 2-5
No one does it because iron golems are expensive
Am I still watching grian 😟
Wait, people DON'T use Iron Golems?? I've been using it every time!
It's a teapot
14:11 looks like a cute little wizard dog
Is it me or does girans house looks like a shoe?
kids dont take 16:28 and look closely
I always used iron golem to kill wither but I just created a big room underground and created the iron golem and the wither in the same room, that way there is a chance that  some of them will die and give me wither roses, I had an iron farm so I had no problem of wasting iron, I could just use chicken but they make it hard to spawn iron golams as they tend to stand on the iron block for some reason
Hmm you starter bace looks a lot like last season
I don’t think he fortune all that copper what a waste
you should advertise you shop by putting a sign beside the door saying "studying a rock/the entity. you should check it out"
5:34
grian: this build is intended to look like a magician's or alchemist's house me: I see a shoe
When will poultry man be back 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
It is more reliable to stuck its heads in bedrock, HOWEVER using golems to kicks its behind while doing so might be even more efficient!
Grian, im proud of you, you have done well.
Grian why not create a tower up to build height, with hoppers at the bottom to collect all the items that drop when you build so high with the copper and stuff? It could be a magic wizards tower or something sick like that
You should put a portal in the cliff under your base!
Nice vid keep up the good work Brian but can you do a life steal smp
You should go ask impulse about the golems
Is it me or does grian’s starter house look like the space dog from among us
There starting houses Massive awesome very good   My starter house *WOOD*
i feel sorry for your electricty build damn that must be in the quadrupal didgets
This was the perfect Grian video... -Hermitcraft, start of season -time-lapse WITH back of base complete -interior tricks and tips -Tango shenanigans -Scar shenanigans
The base I would like to call the Midnight (Watch or Tower)
11:30 me with ashulk of gapps in a server where gold farms are forbidden, ah pathetic (Edit:no hate to grian tho amazing vids)
Organized Grian? Who the hell are you! Where is my man Grian! WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM!
14:55 i cant be the only person who thought we was gonna say i finnished the back
Dude! That bucket at the beginning was SICK!!!! We’re gonna gloss over your next attempt!
people don't use iron golems because they're expensive and the wither fight underground is really easy
It looks like the shoe from the lady who lived in a shoe
I am more proud of the fact grian finished the back in one episode
So how long is the labeled chest system gonna last LMAO. I give it till next episode TBH.
Was anyone else more impressed he finished the back rather than labels?
ORGANIZED?! ur not grian, WHO ARE YOU? jk
" A lot of hermits are doing villagers " grian-2022
Your starter base looks sort of like a boot!
It kinda looks like dog with a  mustage
Any school And college students watching here ❤️❤️❤️
Is it just me or dose Grian's starter base look like a jester shoe
24:02 I expect an actual functional emerald shower.
The last 10 seconds was muted.
You should change the lanterns in the base to soul lanterns
Well done on that clutch
Grian this is a shoe
I can’t be the only one who’s waiting for someone to make “the entity” do the rock eyebrow raise
That whole time he thought we were proud of him for building organized storage, but we’re just proud of him for building a back
The entity _spoke_ to you grian?
The entity _spoke_ to you grian?
Its a shoe
9:55 People are idiots. I have two beacons on my survival world earned this way.
grian do you know what you should do to make it look like it's raining you should have water behind honey blocks and make the items fall against the honey blocks it looks cool
Protip for the wither; carve out an underground room at the bottom of the world and spawn all the golems and then the wither in there; 30-40 golems absolutely TRIVIALIZES the fight.
finally grian grew up
i am impressed!
5:33 They do; hermitcraft has idiots on it.
hey if you sell copper you could add on to the shop by making a giant copper golem holding another boulder up like on its back or something and connect it to the other boulder like in you original design
I’ve seen a few use iron golems to kill the wither. But it didn’t work as well until this update & the addition of deepslate bc the wither could break stone far too easily. Before deepslate was added I typically saw people add obsidian to the ceiling of the area they spawned the wither & sometimes the walls of the tunnel as well in order to prevent the wither from quickly making too large of an area where the golems can’t reach it. But now with the high blast resistance of deepslate using golems like you did is a fantastic method.  It’d one Ive been using in Bedrock since the wither is *so much stronger* on Bedrock! It works even better for the 2nd wither after replacing some of the blocks with cobbled deepslate to rebuild some of the spawning chamber, tunnel & golem battle room. Which is needed more on Bedrock edition as more gets destroyed due to it taking longer for the wither to die.
Organised grian what???
Grian with 2 netherite ingots: *so I did some mining off-camera* I swear I saw it at 0:51
I like the Grian's idea about a story revolves around The entity
Hermotcraft season 9 is in elven theme
I've been waiting for this for so long, I honestly didn't have anything to watch over the past few days so I just decided to watch the first two episodes over and over and over again...
Buy golden carrots from Iskall
Alright admit it. All of y’all thought he was going to say “I did the back side” at 14:55. Don’t deny it. There is no point.
The Iron Golem thing is something I've always done to kill the wither...  did 10 golems in a box and spawned the wither
i would love to see grian build in a modded series (like afterlife) that has all the building items to see what he could come up with. i can't even imagine what he could do
Omg it’s a miracle… he is organized!!!!!!
He built a beautiful fancy storage room
U should use powdered snow bucket so that way u wont mess up the torch and u can also use it on the nether. The onky down side is i f u us eit to put urself out on fire its be gone
Wait you weren't supposed to do that..
When grian said “Look, look guys! You guys are gonna be so proud of me” i thought he was gonna show us that he finished the back of the house
I'm honestly kind of annoyed that they build with pre-aged copper instead of building with fresh copper and waxing it as it reaches a stage they want to keep.
who are you and what have you done with grian
The reason more people don't do the Iron golem strat is because it costs a lot of iron, and I guess people don't play modded or have an iron farm
G: "you guys are gong to be proud of me "  Me : what you finished the back?!!!  G: it's organized!  Me: dies of shock.....  Also am I the only one that thought it was a shoe? (Edit for spelling error)
It says groan every time grian 😅
It's groan sorry grian
o- There's a storage system-   WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO GRIAN!?      p.s unrelated. Grian when r u gonna restock ur merch shop i really wanna buy boatem merch :(
(Sus supersze)
ive been using the golem strat for years and been telling you to, finnaly
Why does the starter house remind me of DanTDM's house from Diamond Dimensions?
"why don't people do this" because in bedrock the wither would slap the golems, kill you, glass your minecraft world, and end you bloodline. sometimes in that order
I got ptsd watching that scene where they joke around with summoning the wither that he was going to do what he did last series
“What you are going to be proud of is…”  Me : that it has a back??!?!!?  “It is labelled.”  Okay then…
Minecraft is trash 🗑
wow! u r a genius grian I thought the iron golems wouldn't even attack the wither
Grians not so starter base is a duck and you can not convince me otherwise.
House looks like a boot
amazing video
I love Grians wholesomeness so much even though I'm a new watcher I might just stick round
Loved the little interior design tutorial that you did it was nice to learn how to make my builds better!
This video is #2 for trending. Not trending for gaming, *trending*
You know what I like most about Minecraft it’s that you can do anything so when servers or just someone has rules I start to get bored and just annoyed
I have pet hermit crabs and when I got my second hermit crab I was thinking of naming it grian.
I actually just singed in to sub to this man absolute legend
People don’t use iron golems because if they want to cheese the wither they normally just use the return portal in the end or the bedrock roof of the nether.
thank you grian for this amazing new adventure of hermitcraft 9, i hope that you have a great time making the rest of this season and hope you don't start another war.        but its seems too late already
PLS for another base build a really modern house
Awesome episode! Love the starter house and time lapses! Wow organized too sweet! Can’t wait to see what you guys have planned for the villagers! Keep up the amazing work! Have a fantastic day! See you later!
“I have no idea if golems will work on the wither”  _us knowing they do bc he posted a short about it a couple days ago_
I miss your building tips and tricks! Hope you manage to integrate more of that into Hermitcraft in the future.
Good job for organizing
Heights are one of my biggest fears lol
Gem is literally ruining Hermitcraft with her disgusting giant builds right in everyone's face.  Inviting Gem was the biggest mistake ever.
Gem is the worst hermit. Throw Gem out of Hermitcraft.
You've gone and built a shoe for a storage room!
Ahhhhh yes grain lore
They grow up so fast 🥺👍😁
Scar: what do villagers taste like?
Those large copper veins can have up to 3000 copper ore, so if you gut a few of those you should be good.
On thumbnail I thought it was a centurion.🤣
“WHY DOES NOBODY DO THIS!”  …..Etho does this
At first when he was like your gonna be so proud I thought he was talking about finishing the back
you kill the wither and title the video starter house ,lol
If u want to sell some honey add a bee on it or over it
Wooooo! Grian way to go! Nice organization!
This house reminds me of a fairy tale that I was told often as a young lad. My 24 yr old wife and myself (30) absolutely love you, Grian. Keep up the great work with all your friends, and keep on having fun!!
Resources👌 for golems
When he said “you’re all going to be so proud of me” I thought he was going to say that he did the back
Those labels are not gonna last
grian never read our comments
grian, blink twice if you are being help hostage by mumbo and have to keep the storage system
You have built a giant boot
You should add ur own portal with a scientist theme
Tango has a game breaking copper farm, Grian has a pickaxe and is still planning to outsell him XD
Ok
15:00 i thought he was gonna say that the back was done
Honestly I thought the starter house looks like that house from the fairy tail of an old woman who lives in a shoe
Grian, Scar, and Tango is a business venture I can get behind
DON'T read my name!
getting a bit motion sick
For your mega base you should build a elvish Castle
I would like to say that your videos lack the background music, grian
It's a boot
From living under a rock to living in a shoe. I see a theme starting... and I like it
Were so proud of u grian for organizing ur stuff
Youre on trending no 2!!!!!
lolll scar said a bad word in spanishhh
I've always let iron golems take care of the Wither, thought it was common knowledge
liked this video on multiple accounts for the organization
I was going to say the back of it
I like how the starter base turned out
I absolutely loved this episode! Your new storage building is amazing and I completely love the roof. I could watch you, Scar, and Mumbo have shenanigans for hours and hours. I can’t wait to see the giant villager/raid farm too! Thanks for making my day better. 😊
TAURTIS SUMMONING PLATFORM!!!
Hey Grian, have you tried to mine netherite with a wither?
"My default is stupid" has got to be my new favourite Grian quote
I tried your wither method on my bedrock world and the wither went straight up and literally nuked everything in a 2 mile radius lol
Grian could make a tiny cave under the Entity and make Under A Rock news.
ngl, Grain's starter base looks like  cat with a wizard hat
Golem Army next 3rd/Last Life? If you spawn them yourself, they won't ever attack you... I'm not sure about other players, but at least it helps with the mobs. I LOVE golems <3 I've probably said this before, but I realized their power when I stopped "protecting" a village I tended and let it live naturally, and to my surprise all the golems it spawned kept it completely safe, even in [normal difficulty] raids.
hello, my name is ghostly  I've been watching sense season 7 and a little of 6 btw your base looks like a dog with a wizard hat ngl
impulse used the iron golems to defeat the wither
Is it just me... Or was it EVEN MORE impressive that it had a back? lol
You can just use your stripe mine and hit it yourself and not waste your iron you just need a long strip mine
im more proud that you did the back
Grian please add grains to the entity!
Grain: i want my builds this season to show a little bit of a story Also Grian: guys i built a cool rock
"Inspired"😂
that's how I alway kill the wither, it's so OP
did anyone else notice the log 2 Electric boogaloo 15:21
I need Mumbai to wax half the copper blocks and we’ll see how long it takes grain to find them all and fix them
i always set up an iron golem saferoom just in case the wither gets to unmanageable. Also, putting a switch at the bottom of an entity cramming box that opens the sides and lets the iron golems fall into an arena. It + a chicken reactor = fun wither rose farm. make the main arena with a bit of a higher ceiling if you want the wither to just murder everything, then have steps and a ledge down a tunnel blocked by a wall. wither breaks it, golems go up on the ledge, bye felicia.
16:33 *ryan george voice* thats the name of the me!
20:16 The map art reminds me of Cooking Mama
Give Kolanii some respect he's been doing that forever.
Does no one on Hermitcraft use Blast Furnaces? The first things I make when I start a new world (now) are at least 1 of each furnace, because once you learn just how quickly Blast Furnaces and Smokers cook their respective items, you want them as soon as possible. I know in writing this comment, I'm already late, but for the future, if you do plan to smelt superfluous amounts of copper, I recommend making Blast Furnaces.
I dunno why.. it's been 3 episodes but "the entity" still sounds like an scp.
Grian..organized.....ohhhh   wait ur not Grian..you are Grien...(how ever it wid be apelled from ur hardcore) lol
grian discovers the ancient concept known as "color"
I miss hermitcraft having wars
"You guys are gonna be so proud of me" Did you do the back?! "I moved all my chests" Oh ok, still impressive "What are you gonna be proud of..." DID YOU DO THE BACK?? "Is that I labeled all the chests" Oh..... I'm pretty sure that'll only last two episodes
The house kinda looks like a duck without a bill
Grian your house looks like an elf shoe
24:47 Mature humor
Oh lord, just finished tangos and falses stuff, and my immediate reaction was not another copper shop...
The shape and energy of your starter base gave me one thought You're a wizard Grian and this is your wizard tower
I thought it was the endtiti but it is entiti
Is it just me or does Grians base kinda look like a shoe?
No one spawns Iron golems because its too hard to gather resources compared to making a long tunnel and hitting it like how you and scar were, your just spending iron that you could be using to make the beacon after you kill the wither
Grian: “This build is intend to look like a magician or alchemist's house” Me: "Oh man, it looks like a Jesters shoe with a roof on it!"
Can you do another 3rd life
9000th comment
he finished the back LETS GOOOOOO
Grian's magician house looks like a duck wearing a hat to me.😂😂
anyone else think grians house looks like a curly toed elf boot
It’s a dog with a hat🤪
EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS!!!😩💗
hey grian ngl i love your videos so much they just made my day a whole lot better i had to pause half way through to work a 12 hour shift and i came back and was pleasantly surprised to see i had more video left :))
9:54 Doing it with iron golems costs a lot of iron, and doing it in the end is free.
i like it😆
Grian you should try fighting the bedrock edition wither with this strategy. 😈😈
I think I’ve seen Etho kill the wither with golems before, I might be misremembering though
It kind of looks like a shoe
Look at the chat at 17:02 😂
Grian is giving us a tutorial on how to make this house a home
7:21 yeah it would! if there's anything under the soul sand blocks it wont spawn i contacted a mod on a server once because there was grass (not the block) under my soul sand and i didn't realize wasted a whole 10 minutes of the server admins time- felt really bad
Scar said Grian's base looks like a cat and now I can't unsee it.
Mumbo For Mayor
That alchemist/magician must be smelling pretty terrible considering the base looks like a giant shoe.
the starting house gives me Owl House vibes and it's super cool :D
Please someone in the hermicraft server make a mountain kingdom or base!!!
One is caught up playing the impassioned protagonist in one’s Subjective Narrative of Self 🎈
The starter base looks like a shoe lol
i have forgotten how long you have to wait for a hermitcraft episode (great vid btw)
14:58 i was so hoping for him to say that he did the back.
Why have I not seen anyone talking about 24:46
Grian- "This house is like for a alchemist or a wizard..." Me -  (coughs) it's a shoe GRAINS THE LADY IN THE STINKY SHOE
Fact : If you put copper blocks into a stonecutter and select the cut copper it should quadruple your copper.
Grian: I made a storage system and labeled it! Me: Who are you and what have you done with Grian?!
10:53 He reminded me so much of Mumbo when he shouted like this.
I love Joe's reaction in the chat to Scar touching a wither skull and then nearly dying without context
The house look like a boot
Grian, after watching you for a couple of years, finally having labelled your storage, im proud of you
TIL homely has a different British meaning
season 9, Grian lives in a size 4,864 shoe....
from the thumbnail i thought grian was living in a shoe 💀
day 2 of asking grain for the seed
you should build the rock Patrick lives in, In the show SpongeBob square pants and build your starter base underneath
I have discovered why language arts is taught through higher grades, it's so we can understand Grians build talk
There was an old lady who lived in a shoe....
Cool
I’m not going to lie, Grians house looks like a boot. 😅
Grian, can u give building tips like you did in your starter base throughout all your videos? I found it very entertaining and usefull
when will poultry man return?
Does anyone else think grains house look like a boot
The portal is in the shape of a heart 18:26
I thought you were going to say that we were proud that the back was done
You always make my day when you post
Leviticus 23:4-8 These are the feasts of the Lord, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons. In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the Lord's passover. And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread. In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein. But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
He didn't make a blast furnace the smelting of copper will take several hours now
Looks like a jesters boots just need a bell on the toe tip lmao looks good tho
can you give a link to yumar's post
You should try putting upside down stairs for the shelf instead of trapdoors it will look way nicer. You would not need the chain either as stairs make it look as if it in mounted to the wall.
I just thought it looked like a shoe house :/ still love it
Grian, your house reminds me of the story "The old lady who lived in a shoe".
Scars pronunciation of Putter insinuates that he calls peanut butter “Peanut Booter”.
He never used a blast furnace to smelt the copper
Etho does it, of course.
What's the timelapse music? Love it and the base!
15:43 I'm so confused right now... Where did the trapdoors come from 😂
I think people don't use iron golems because iron blocks are very expensive.
13 on trending 👀
anyone notice bad times with scar leave at 17:01
Not going to lie, I am getting huge Jack and the Beanstalk vibes from Grians base.
I don’t get why the wither didn’t spawn near scars base someone tell me
the main reason people dont go after the wither with iron golems is that it's easy to kill it, stupidly hard to get the 'kill' for yourself (and not hit a golem in the confusion, for example). You'll notice you didn't get any achievements for picking up the nether star.
Anyone want to take bets on haw long the the storage room will last 😉
If mumbo doesn’t wax at least some of the copper I’m be so disappointed
is this character development?
"We've got a lot of golden apples" My friend: *Pathetic*
you three should make the entity together and make a whole company as you will get alot of stock between you tango and scar
Anyone else think the base looks kinda like a shoe?
I’m surprised that Grian didn’t make those furnaces into blast furnaces with the amount of copper he was smelting!
Is it just me or is grian base a huge shoe
Someone who studies things magically is referred to as an "arcaneologist" (16:39) If you see this can you mention it in your next video? Maybe even make a room functional as an enchanting area and aesthetic as a study area, with brewing stands, cartography tables, etc.
dang... when the iron golems got hit by the wither and got withering, it made a cool beat for a song or something.
Grian was also sure the sign would stop it from spawning
It looks like an elf shoe, I like it, but it looks like a shoe
I that server it's kill 1 get 1 head   so kill 3 withers get one free
I literally can't not dance to your timelapse music. I just started dancing when it started.
what do they taste like...
I hope The Entity turns out like The Barge!
If that's supposed to be a functional base then where are the monoids
NOOOO SUSPENSEEEE
Aren't you gust making mumbo more rich
back of the base not missing, noted
Whenever you say "the Entity" I always think of entity 0, 101, 202, 303, 404, 505, 606, 707, and 808
Make a ballon or penguine
Please stop calling villagers overpowered or Mojang will nerf them! Diamonds are hard enough to find in this update. It would suck if villages were nerfed at this point!
Me hoping he would say he was proud of doing the back!!
Grian trying to kill the blaze in full enchanted diamond gear vs dream doing it naked with a wooden shovel lol
A BACK TO A BUILD
Grian: I am strictly a pie guy (has 32 pork)  Next clip: has 31 pork...
grian your house looks bigger on the inside like a TARDIS
Did anyone notice that Grian’s tower has a wizard hat.
The colors just do not work together on your starter base
The song of the timelapse remember me of the Dragon ball
Grian use a blast furnace it's faster to smelt ore
Organisation in storage who are you and what have done with Grian
i think you could also sell aged copper it would take awhile but think of the BREAD you would make
When he said we would be proud of him, I thought it was gonna be about how he did the back!🤣
15:09 I didn't realise you were showing us how you cleaned up at first, I seriously thought you were taking us around to the back of your house to show that you finished the back for once 🤦🏻‍♀️
Proof that neither Scar nor Grian watch their buddy Impulse's vids
Using iron golems is so expensive and using bedrock glitch in the the end is better option
Grian. I adore your starter house. The colors, the gradient, the functionality, the fact that you have a house now. But, and I'm sorry, it will always look a bit like a shoe to me. Keep up the awesome work! Let's go Season 9!
You should be a wizard this season
grian is fr the only person who can make a build out of white wool and diorite while still making it look good
Your starter storage looks a little like an elf's shoe...  and now I kinda want to make a shoe to live in now too. ;^D
Grian is giving us interior tips and tricks? Since when?
Organized grian ! Organized grian ! Organized grian ! Organized grian ! Organized grian !
It looks like a mix of your mega bass in season eight of all the buildings
I feel like the entity will play a big part in the series later on, I have no idea why.
Best. Start. To video. Ever.
THE ROOF ON YOUR STARTER HOUSE IS AMAZING
Don't lie, you saw impulse do the iron golem thing and wanted to see it for yourself lol
lovely house, very disney-ish. also kindof a boot :P
15:13 “For the first time in forever!”
Mumbo, Grian and Scar feel like they should be in a traveling circus together.
Why didn't you live UNDER the rock?
It took 2.5 stacks of iron to cheese the wither that way
I thought of using iron golems in a box of bedrock and they won, it was a challenge to see what mob can kill the wither
the reason people don't do kill the wither like that is cause its just way easier to just trap it in bedrock  and with a good sword, it dies way quicker.
you could live under the cobble bridge
Grian u could have lived under the boulder
MOVED, ORGANIZED, *AND* LABLED?!?!? 🍪🍪🍪🍪 cookies for you Grian, cookies for you :)
Nobody does this trick because people use the end gateway as it is the absolute safest
Happy B-Day Grian!...?
OK listen up you need a lot nortos   shells  so make afk fish farm it  make lot I on
“The entity… it spoke to me…” hey Grian… What?
"patah"
No one uses iron golems against the Wither because it's expensive and if you have a diamond or netherite gear with Smite V and Protection IV then you can kill the Wither faster than with Golems.
Can everyone who sees this watch arsenal fan place because I got an interview on it which is realy cool.
Grian being organized!? no that's the work of Grien!
GOOD JOB
Grian: you're gonna be proud it's all labelled and there's no mess Me: ok but did you do the back?
Grian is the copper king but so was I im taking back my throne
Grian is now Piean that really doesn't work.
Grian you should make like a long trench with small houses and huts inside the trenches . Building base idea
people don't do it cus the java wither is easyway and on bedrock this just doesn'twork because it's so much harder
Why is nobody talking about grian building the back?
Why do people always spread out copper blacks to energize them isn't it better to have it in a clump
My dad always kills the wither that way
At 9:48 the tokens hurting we're doing in the hall of the mountain king lol
15:20 Am I dreaming? It can't be true!
If I recall correctly somebody (I think it was impulse) used iron golems as part of a wither farm back in season 7
10:10 cause it cost to many iron for what it is when you can just stuck the wither in the nether roof or in the end under the portal where the wither can't touch you or run out
It looks like a witches shoe
The junk clear-up and the organised storage system isn’t what impresses us Grian, the fact that the house has a back is the impressive part!
Am i the only person that thinks that Grian's house looks a bit like a colourful dog?
Grian's house went scar style with the copper
I can’t tell if Grian is family friendly or comedy friendly 😂😂😂
Good job on the house!!!
Hey when you guys have another third life series it should be called” Next life” cause you’ve had third, last then you’ll have next ——— Like if you agree
grian, because you are experimenting with colour and copper more this season, you might need a tip. You can cheapen how many blocks you get by crafting regular copper. Let me explain. Normally, you would craft 4 copper blocks into 4 cut copper, but if you use a stonecutter, then one copper block will make 4 cut copper. Just to help cut down on the cost
There is a fun trick involving chests and item frames. You can place item frames on the sides where the chests are almost touching. It will look like they are stuck together by a piece of wood.
New Base: The Old Grian and the Shoe  Love it! 😁
how did you prevent the wither from spawning?
"Magician or alchemist's house ..." No,  you're the little ol' Grian that lives in a boot. That's a nice boot.
14:55 I thought he was going to show us he did the back-
It looks like a elf shoe, the houes
THERE’S A BACK
He needs a monocle
9:55 they shall want to have the achievement of slaying Thy Wither.     That's why
So totems of undying forever. Yes. YESSSSS
I am using a wither the next time I need deepslate, I will strip mine in one direction and lure it until I have enough.
You might want to use jump boost for copper mining next time
It's the end of an era of never finishing the back of builds
Me Who is just proud that he made the back
Using gradiant in color, Thank you Grian very much for such an good idea. You hermits are an absolute good inspiration for building design an farm ideas. :-)
Scar is using water becuse grian is evil
is it just me or does it look like an old boot? still a really cool house
impulse did the iron golem wither strat on is hardcore 100 days challenge right before the start of season 9
WOW!!! The base is organised and it's got a back!!!
“Living under a rock isn’t exactly a good thing” Zedaph-😔
I wanna call the house The Shoe
Is Whitherskall the evil twin of I-skall?
Ok, this functional house looks like a gnome boot and there's nothing you can say that will change my mind.
Great job Grian! You get a gold star for your good work today!
For next season for viliagers you can use slowness and it makes them easir to deal with
is it just me or does Grian's house look like a pointy shoe?
Grian: IT is all organized   Me: for now
Grian's house looks like a strange shoe to me
*looks at the thumbnail* is that a dog with a hat?
I didn't get my goooodbye and I'm sad
15:20 I'm just suprised he did the back ngl
All those chests are garanteed to become a chest montser
"Scar and withers are fun". THIS IS NOT SCAR SAFE i thought and he lived this day shall be forever rememberd
Why does this remind me of sacrs last life base
When Grian said "I'm gonna show you something you're gonna be proud of" i thought he was gonna show the back of the base
They've been using golems for withers on hermitcraft for ages, mostly in the end under the bedrock tho. and impulse used it a lot and has used that in hermitcraft this season
Am I the only one seeing a cat in the base??
Bedrock players watching that wither fight with envy
Grian:Um scar why dose nobody do this  Me: looks at bedrock and cries
SORTED CHESTS!? WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOOU DONE WITH GRIAN!?
Finally your house has a back
grain shop is gonna be named G ROCK im sure
I love how the intended audience is 100% kids but then you look in the comments section to find a bunch of teens and adults watching (including myself) I just think that’s so funny
grian's being organized im scared this is unusual pls send help
Grian: "I'm exclusively a pie guy" Grian, 2 minutes later with 30 Porkchops instead of 32
Not gonna lie, I feel like Grian's functional base looks like a painter's house. The way it's next to the river and focused on the Entity, I love it! It's definitely my favorite thing on Hermitcraft right now. :)
joel used iron goloms to kill the wither on the hardcore series
first grian builds a rock, now he lives in a boot. What an adventure is season nine
add a microscope to your base looking at the entity
2 episodes  im giving it 2 episodes until he starts making a chest monster
People thought the bundle was useless at least a few or most but couldn’t you put in the different gradients of copper and if you put in right take them out in order?
I love your tutorial type stuff, very inspiring and helpful to my own minecraft series! :D
Sad impulse in hardcore noises
I think the starter base was a great decision, just dont go living in it forever... again
Grian can i give u an idea or a suggestion ? Anyway the suggestion or the idea is:   Instead of using another "heart of the sea"  U can use a "note block" or a "juke box" to make a heart beat sound loud in enough to be heard from a distance
"Logs 2 Electric Booglaoo"
There once was a Grian who lived in a shoe.
I thought the starter base was supposed to be a jester's shoe.
the iron golem trick is a standard use for me
15:20 Mumbo is shaking...
Why do I have a feeling mumbojumbo is going to Wax the copper.😂
Its a shoe :)
you could have just used the end portal strat
Welcome, child, to the light. Pie is good. Pie is great.
Make a giant person base, or golem. Keep it mystical and live inside it, with moss and copper. Maybe give it a mine shaft.
Hey grian I have an idea/theme for your base  You can make like lots of builds and all have contakt in one way or in the other way
It’s a boot that’s about to kick the rock
Grian saying sus is legendary
I would love to see a modded hermitcraft series, stuff like villager trading gets removed, mining veins are lowered or outright removed. Instead there is a giant mall at spawn that sells everything you could possibly want but only takes a specific currency. This currency is earned by either trading in bulk mining results (think an inventory full of cobble for a stack of iron ore)  or by rare veins in the world but mostly from mini-dungeons you can find in the world, some designed for 1 hermit, others for multiples (honestly this stuff could be added as needed too). On top of that you can find rare resources needed for setting up farms so hermits can compete to find these and set up stores for better value vs the megamall instead of everyone just setting up their own duplicate farms etc.   Granted I dont think any current mods would cover any of this and it'd be a lot of work to set up but I think it'd be cool to have things feel more meaningful rather than just "yeah I set up this trader hall just like everyone else but now im going to sell it because!" ><
I had an idea after reading a comment by @Tanishi Chaubey, how about setting up an easel(?) with a map art of the entity (done yourself or commissioned) and as you build more onto the rock you can lock the old art and add on to a new map. Showing the progress of the Entity as the season progresses.
Grian: You're gonna be so proud of me. Me: He finished the back? Grian: Theres no Junk! Me: Oh
Since I know the entity is going to have a nether or fire themed shop. You should have lave dripping down and just stop it mid air with glass panes
15:15 Grian, are you ill?
I love your builds and the entire time during the time lapse I was saying go Grian pop off king I can’t wait to see what your mega base turns out to be this season but I know it will be great whatever it is
So, uh… is Tango the sugar daddy?
I feel like The Entity will be the severs "End of season" event
Grian, sorting, and interiors don't feel like they should go together.
Ooohhhh, pooter! *gasping* putter whatever it was..
Love the starter house! But I must admit, I thought it looked like a Christmas elf boot.
I love the way you took on the wither, but it would have been cheaper to end cheese it.
I killed a wither on my SMP with iron golems literally a few weeks ago, but it has gone too far up so we had to bring him to second phase by shooting at him.
Impossible! It has a back
Grian, you could have saved yourself some trouble with the copper and inventory management by working with 100 % full oxidized copper or fresh copper and waiting for it to oxidize in place, then go along with an axe and honeycomb to set your colors. Maybe this isn't right for some people who really need to see the final look of a block the moment it is placed, but something to consider for future builds. It takes more time and patience, so I see why you wouldn't do it that way because, come on, its Grian we're talking about here.
Grian sell cut copper blocks and use stonecutter then you get 4 per copper block out of them way cheaper. (Watch out crafting is only 1:1 while stone cutter is 1:4
I don’t really like this based on ur 6 and 7 and 8 builds
Your house looks like a boot
I really appreciate the dedication you put into these episodes, villager transportation is the WORST. ~respect
Grian's starter base sure looks a lot like some sort of duck. A wizard duck with no bill.
grian is the bob ross of minecraft
I’m having a crisis, I went through denial; why is your storage system organized?!
Oh no he is going to become a pie now
He did the back of it
Impossible grian is organizedddddd
It even has a back!
The starter base is only missing a beak and it would be a magical duck
15:15 I AM.....I AM SOOOO PROUDDD
Is it just me or Grian's thumbnail just used the same font/lettering style as Mumbo's
Where’s the goodbye?
no one uses iron golems because the wither is too easy anyway
who else thinks grian's starter base looks like a shoe?
It's not just a rock, it's a Boulder
When using copper I normally use fully oxidised copper then go in after to add any gradients, it minimises the different types of blocks in the inventory
Grian: sus super sus
not going to lie your starter base kinda looks like a shoe
I’m sure others may have commented this, but WadZee did this a while back before 1.18 and I think is works even better down in deep slate to keep the wither more contained
Grian: "you guys are gonna be proud of me, look, look what i did" Me: "he built the back 😃!"
Pie = 3.141592...
You should've put a wheel swing on scars tree and made that your house
almost dropped my phone at the organization 😂😂
I've not played Minecraft in 3 years, or heard about it... what's copper
What is your 3rd life intro song called, and this season’s intro?
ive been doing the iron golem thing since literally i started playing in 2012. it was very popular back then
Your storage is looking so cool
"chest monster" 😉😉
Who gave the inspiration
Umair is in my clash Royale clan
What was the music tpin the background of the house building Time lapse?
I did the same, used 15 golems. All of them died in bedrock edition.
The house looks a little bit like a unicorn imo xD
Impulse has a raid farm that is overflowing with emeralds and totems
Getting magic vibes
Why don't people do this he asks... Uhmm people, and hermits, do do this... Usually it's under the overworld portal in the end. Just a couple golems in the area and plop down a wither and blam easy kills. Just make sure to hit the wither at least once so it drops loot...
Name a better trio than Grian, Scar, and Mumbo
Furnaces , Grian?
This new season should be about teamwork I feel like nun of the season besides the shopping center had like a lot of teamwork and I think that could be really cool and made big
Please do more building tips and tricks in the series they’re really cool
So ummmm this feels like I’m rewatching a certain impulse fellas video 🤔
Does Grian know that you can just trap the wither under the end portal bedrock? Either way the iron golem strat was super entertaining and it worked great!
tarumlüg rutangisnetauq   Programmierer  der  Master K. I.                       !!!
the house looks like a goat
11:20 I agree, Super Sustainable!
I'm soo proud of you grain
10 dollars says it is unorganized by episode 4
It looks like a shoe
Logs 2 : Electric Boogaloo, the Season 9 evolved version of Tag 2: Electric Boogaloo from Season 7
Mumbo even used the iron golems on the wither in an older video
Whose Putter’s owner?
I tried doing the iron golem versus wither technique in bedrock edition, but it doesn't work because the bedrock wither is waaaay more powerful!
Grian I dream I was playing Minecraft with all the  hermit's in my Xbox one and it was awesome because we all partner up with each other me and my cousin play together with all of y'all and we all got new members of both servers and we like it so much we just all started playing together and youtobing together and it was so awesome
I am so proud
Grian I am disappointed in u, said from the get go, I thought u were British. But I guess the sorted out chests makes up for it lol
YAY GRIAN GOT #10 TRENDING
Use a blast furnace cause it's much faster than regular furnace
I see a weird looking dog
Watching so many perspectives, I'm just reminded that a lot of the banter between the Hermits doesn't get shown in the interest of time! Some content is in others' videos, some isn't. Try giving Scar or Mumbo's videos a watch, for example!
I really thought he was going to say that we would be proud on him because he finished the back of the house lol
Anyone else think it looks like a shoe
14:50 “it:s lacking some details out the front” AKA chest mister galore
this is my favourite Grian video all because he said "OH DUDE" at 10:53
Grain has finally organized!!
Grian said: all of the item are organize and i straight up smile
Challenger Andy used golems to kill a wither in a challenge video
Uuuh 16:28
Grian I will say it again it's a snail lol
This seasons OST is really good wow
I love the idea of the iron golems and the base looks amazing!!!!
I audibly gasped when he showed the organised chests
Is Grian the little old Hermit who lived in a shoe?
E L E P H A N T H   H O U S E
Im more proud grian decorated the back
Build a fish shop
If you do sell copper, you should team up with Tango as he has a really powerful copper farm
äëïöü
Looks like a shoe
16:35 I ak sorry Grian my vibes for the your build is The old lady who lived in a shoe.
I actually gasped when Grian's chests were labelled.  Grian sorts chests + Everything in world right now = End of World?
Anyone else think that Grian could be a special guest on The LifeSteal SMP. Just Imagine a video where Grian, The most Kid friendly Minecraft Youtuber, Getting destroyed by ClownPeirce And Parrot.
so now grians short about the Golems makes sense
Episode 3 of asking Grian to put a mini the rock face on the entity
pir²
That timelapse song was popping off
:))
Oh I thought that was a shoe
Grian struggels with Blazes me Just use a shield
Hello grian I wanted to tell you about a thing that I discovered when you put a copper block into a stonecutter it gives you four cut cover wow
9:50 there is a reason first of all why spend iron on golems if you can just cheese it with just a tunnel like isnt it obvious not everyone is there with a iron farm and stacks of iron blocks
Grian: You are gonna be so proud of me Me: Did you do the back Grian?
Hi people love the vid so cool loving how Grian nearly dies in nether fortress
jour new starter base looks like a shoe
I LOVE YOUR NEW TIMELAPSE MUSIC OMG. Was it a commission, or can we find it somewhere?
Give the entity googly eyes
One way he could fix inventory overload is by pre-waxing the copper in a crafting table
I luv the little building/interior design technique session here and there, thanks Grian!
Congrats on trending
For copper gradients you can build the whole thing to the shape you want with fully oxidized copper and then axe it/wax it in place so you don't have to manage all the variants in your inventory! :)
Bdubs building with diorite and berch,Grian being all tidy...whats happening this season
U guys could do in the next season is add mods like magic or tech mods that would be cool
all I can see is the shoe from "there was an old woman who lived in a shoe" when I look at the base.. 👀👀
That whole time he thought we were proud of him for building organized storage, but we’re just proud of him for building a back
GRIAN SAID SUS 11:25
THANK YOU GRIAN!JEIO"{
You should build donkey from Shrek on the Boulder and live in him
Its much easier to kill the wither under the end portal which is why ppl dont kill the wither with golems, usually ppl kill the wither after the dragon.
Tip: you maybe put in stead of a block a fence in the storage area I mean on the shelf
grian: i really really love this  also my brother listening to me watch this video: then marry it  me: u serious?
Ah, finally a starter base that is actually STARTER! Good btw
Grian got character development!!!
The house looks like a dog. Period
they are legends and my inspiration for my builds wow the hermits are awesome like if u agree
no 'goooood byee😘'🥲
Not gonna lie, I feel like Grian's functional base looks like a painter's house. The way it's next to the river and focused on the Entity, I love it! It's definitely my favorite thing on Hermitcraft right now. :)
I’m just proud the build has a back to it
0:00 when the words sync with the blocks
very nice of you to help scar train for mcc, grian ;p
Gian = Architect                                                                                               17.3.2022.
Scar said "what do they taste like?" lol 23:50
I feel like it would be so cool if grian added a dock to the house so you could enter by sea
15:15 bravo grian bravo oyu have made me proud hahaha
do only i saw the pp at the top
Wait why didn't that spawn!?!?
Scar: 'What do they taste like" Grian and Tango: *We're gonna pretend we didn't hear that*
people dont use the golem strat because its straightup faster to just use a smite 5 sword with strength 2
You've outdone yourself!
fancy shoe👠
Why isn’t there someone selling saturation mysterious stew? One bowl for one diamond. You’d be rich!
Literally everyone: Im gonna sell copper this season!
did he make the back tho🤔🏚
Grian putting the 3rd skull gave me chills
Hermitcraft lore????
badtimewithscar
Tomorrow is hole
Thank Good
Speedrunners taking out blazes with stone axes and no armour. Grian struggling against them with full enchanted diamond gear XD
It's kind of scary how much copper you collected, only to get a small amount of Copper Blocks (9 copper ingots = 1 block of copper)
My first thought watching this was: MINE WITH THE WITHERS!  The Wither skulls seem not to be able to fit in a 1x2 tunnel, so they mined to get to Grian until they reached the Iron Golems.  So simply do that with several withers, a really long tunnel, and several iron golems at the end.  No broken maxed-out pickaxes, massive tunnel you can mine the ore out of, plenty of Deepslate, and you can use that tunnel to build something like the Mumbo message delivery tunnel from S7.
I'm proud he finished the back! Lol.
ur base looks like an elf's shoe, perhaps scar's
The house is like a puppy. Great dough
Chest monster: *cries*
This is a deepslate miner 👷‍♂️
I'm more proud that he did the back... (lol) 😅
Hey Grian I have a suggestion, could you post build tutorials on your Hermitcraft starter bases please they are so cool and I would love to build some
0:00 Someone remix this!
Good job you organized
Who else expected Grian to show off the house had a back instead of the storage being labeled and inside? 😂
Organized chess? I thing this is a Imposter
Grian’s build looks like like a magic shoe lol
Never thought I’d hear Grian say “Sus. Super sus”
Am I the only one that thinks from a certain point of view the house looks like a cat??
Impulse has done this after building a wither sceleton farm. Then he built many withers under the center of the End island. The golems were just killing the wither wich was unable to do anything. That was s. 7
20:51 I think you meant to say you are pieous
24:48 “I’m just following you butt.” My thought process: There’s a donkey joke in there… somewhere. … _Oh,_ there it is!
The old grian who lived in a shoe!
15:34: Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo XD
it's PUTTER, remided me of Draco Malfoy saying POTTA
grian, studier, nomad, and wanderer
GRIAN!!! You forgot to collect the levels that you got from smelting all that copper!
When I'm feeling sad I could always depend on grin
Grian should do live streams, I would  watch that all day.
Your starter base, I call it “the Goose”
Killing the wither with golems is the only way I have ever done it. The suffocation method I always saw as cheaty.
More proud of the back of the house
16:47 You could call it "The Back"...
Didn't Lizzie use golems on the wither she helped kill in the hardcore series?
I agree with Scar your base looks like a cat with a witch hat.
What I'm even more proud of is that the back is done.
grian: ,,turns out living under a rock isnt always a good thing" * sad patrick star noises *
gl bro next time
Keep up the good work!
I thought it was supposed to look like a boot. . .
I think everyone doesn't try this because of the amount of iron you need to make the iron golems
grian: ,,i have never seen people do this" * sad wadzee noises *
14:54 who thought grian was going to say that he build the back
23:45 : scar being psychopath
Grain, can you please make a Vampiric style thin castle🥺🙏
Impulse did it in this hardcore world
They don’t do it bc iron is expensive and the end portal is free
"Why does nobody do this?" Grian that's like half a stack of iron blocks my guy
I love grains work and i am so glad that they have gone back to no lore.
16:28 explain grian
@Grian you should bring the barge back and have it steam in from the ocean
ne
Tbh I’m proud that Grian finished the back lol.
Those chains would fall down and kill you if it was in real life
It looks like a cat 🐈 wearing a wizard hat.
I would have suggested the cave base can be used for storage and mining.
thank you for keep inspiring me sometimes i want to quit minecraft but when i see your every videos i like playing minecraft
Clif hanger
Boot house
Grian we are so proud that you did the back
15:00 i expected him to show the back 🤣😂😆😂
When Grian announced we were going to be proud I really thought he was going to show us he had done the back
Him being so excited at that mlg in the beginning was actually so wholesome
15:03 We are proud of you Grian
So... whither powered auto miner?
NEW IDEA!!: Wither mining
Big brain
god job organiding. proud fo you.
YEAHH HE FINISHED THE BACK OF THE BUILD, IM SO PROUD
Grian the Blocky, mage of Hermitcraft.
Grian: im a pie man Me an intellectual: you're a PIEneer🧐
A alcemist seems like a great idea!
grian  farm idea for a coal farm to sell coal that many people need al lot of making a wither skeleton farm would give coal hmmm
more wholesome pranks pls
With infinite emeralds why are you bothering zombificating the villagers? Cheap trades don't matter with infinite funds
Oh I see a tiny beautiful dog! Not an alchemist tower. It is lovely though. Absolutely lovely
Don’t oganise your stuff, make a chest monster, just like poultryman! Hint hint
good
Grian's organize this season
You dis the back and fixed the chestmonster inpresive!!
WHAT? organised chests??? who are u what have u done to grian
Maybe ThinkNoodles used Iron golems to kill the wither...?
Finally. it's ORE- ganized
Impulse has a huge raid farm and it generates tons of emeralds and totems of undying
i think the reason that people don’t use iron golems is because of how expensive they are, just a thought though
Little grian living in a shoe
I have seen wadzee do it
It have back!
Are you using Windows or Mac?
Brooo Tango just made a copper farm and he is definitely going to sell it how are you going to keep up??🙁
nah mate im not proud of u about the storage its the back im proud of YOU DID IT
Its way cheaper to kill the wither with just a long tunnel, a bow and a sword
i miss the season 7 timelaps music
"I am doing something very stupid"  Hermitcraft in a nutshell:
well, well, well. Mr. HalloMan has two otherside disks. i'm here to give you two tips. 1. he really grinded for a trident and he might one another one, for back-up, for trowing or for lightning. 2.IskalMan likes making good deeds.
Grian, just pillar up your copper in a 2x2 square surrounded by a permanent pool of water, then you can just jump down safely each time :D
yo i love dream smp!!!!!
The build kind of reminds me of a shoe
day 2 of asking a top hat for rock
Grian sounding like a British Bob Ross just instead of paintings its interior in minecraft
u have been organised be4, but that was be4 u started playing mc
nyone else who noticed that logs 2 electric boogaloo label on that wood chest?? Easter egg??
I give it 1 episode tell the organization us gone
It would be funny if you made it fool's gold.
gunna be real when he said you’re going to be proud i thought he was talking about the fact that the base actually had a back
When he said u will be proud of me I thought he was finishing the back lolll
Grian says we will be proud of him. I was expecting him to point out that the base had a back.
14:20 a train
I love how Joehill reacts to everything in the chat 😂
nobody uses iron golems against withers because with a good bow, sword/axe and potions it's a one minute job
5:55 “General Scar, you are a Bold one.”
The reason no one use iron golems for wither fights, is that there are way more efficient ways to kill the wither. The beast way is using contraptions. But for early game the best way is to dig a long corridor 1x2 then after like 30 block make a 3x3x3 (digging up one block) room. Then spawn the wither. Then all you have to do is keep swinging at the wither wile backing up. A Wither is 3 block tall and shoots from its head meaning that it can see you and will chase you but are unable to attack you.  The bonus of this tactic is that when the Wither is dead. It will have cleard out a 3-5 block tunnel revealing ores= u might get diamonds from doing it.
its a shoe
its a shoe
Grian, you can just suffocate it in the end
15:15 Congrats Grian you organized your stuff!
Who else thought he was gonna show us that he did the back when he said we were gonna be proud of him
It will be cool if the hermits shop where bird houses or houses on chains hanging from a big tree please copy and paste this
15:24 More responsible then me
cause most people put wither under the end portal after defeating dragon so wither will die to suffering
23:51 “What do they taste like” 💀💀💀
15:07 ... yes the back of the build is doen lol
I don't do it cause I'm in bedrock edition and iron is expensive plus the wither in bedrock dashes so it doesn't work as well
i wanna see someone use a warden to kill the wither
when he said we'd be proud- why did i even think it was gonna be  the back- i should know by now
when he was like "do you see it can you tell what ive done" i really thought he was gonna say "i actually built the back of a build for once"
Grian, we all know it, your house looks like a shoe
Lets go grian
You are VERY brave to put your copper so close and available to Mumbo! Good luck! 😁
grian, just a tip you can rename an item in an anvil, put the chests sideways, put item frames on the end and put the renamed items in the frames, for example rename rotten flesh to mob drops and put it in the frame of the mob drop chest so when you look at the chest it will say “mob drops”
8:23 Oh i wonder... Maybe because killing wither is easy and im pretty sure that at least 80% of the people doesn't have 5 stacks of iron blocks by the time they kill their first wither.
Grian, I watch u on my TV and laptop etc, I have just realised. I AM NOT SUBSCRIBED TO U ON MY PC. Lol, like 4years of watching u  and i JUST realised my not subscribed.....
This house looks like a pumpkin xd
The tower u made
Has anybody told him that there is a guy named TangoTek and he maybe have had made a copper farm from drowns?
U could have made a small n tall house on top of entity
14:55 You finished the back?!? "No random junk!" oh...
You didn't get the achievement
20:55 Grian: im a pie guy. Five frames after: 31 pork
15 20. I thought you were saying you did the back of it
Finally caught up from season 8 ep 4, I stopped watching for no reason
We doesn't qny body do this Firstly this costs alot of iron for ppl who don't have an iron farm.......
Great episode Grian! I really liked your new starter base! The way you used the gradients from black to white and the copper gradient was so cool! I'm looking forward to seeing you using more colour in your builds this season. Also since you were wondering if anyone else has used iron golems to kill the wither, in Impulse's recent hardcore series he used iron golems to kill the wither too!
IM JUST SUPRISED THERE IS A BACK TO THE BUILDING!! 🤣
When is joel in hermitcraft
I thought he was gunna say that he did the back of the base
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Scar is getting better at minecraft (in the movement/mlg departement) at the same as he is going to be in mcc
Did anyone else notice that Grian's house looks like a elvish boot?
Grian, if you just go for completely oxidized copper and just hit it with an axe until the wanted "color"  and wax it after so they don't change anymore, this way your inventory wont be as cluttered with all different blocks and only a few different ones!  Good luck building!
What have done with grian and why is he organized
#2 on trending for gaming congrats!
looks like a poodle stretching lol
#2 on trending
I have seen people do this for instance paul gg
The house has a back too
You can turn the chunks to 4 and the witherskelettons are gonna spawn faster :) oh also you can put note blocks in the entinty and when you do it right it sounds like a heart beat
musik ist gut für die seele
Sahara 2.0
YAY you did the back
Grian, did you really not know about spawning withers under the End exit portal? =] Why use golems when you can immobilize the wither and punch it to death? :] (Also think it works with the nether roof)  Also 21:14 :D
funnily enough, the entity "speaking" isn't the weirdest thing to happen in a hermitcraft server
14:58 I honestly thought he was gonna show the back of the base and would be like: “I finished the back of the base :0”  Edit: You should make the warped vine go to the top of the base so that it blends in :)
IT HAS A BACK!!?!?!!
Oh you like Pi? name the first 1,00 decimals.
was grian singing dr stone music 6:39
What a crazy good build, i'm so impressed by your progress as a builder.
That build looks so similar to Grian's house from last season, one main frame plus a tower, yet different. I guess it's the colours and the choice of roof, solid work!!
Grian in ep1: i dont want a starter house Grain now: MY STARTER BASE!
WHO are you and what did you do to Grian
“What else can I do?” “Good talk! 9:15 “ “What else can I do?”
Hey there 30 Yr old fathers do u agree that scar sounded like Obi Wan Kenobi when he said Ohhh HELLO THERE
You should sell stone
not sus, sustainable
I love how he was so proud when he sorted everything
Love the Base but in my opinion it's to close to last season's starter base
that creeper sure is sustainable
Grian clearly didnt see Impulse take on the wither in the live stream
The minecraft Gordon Ramsay
In this video we give scar a heart attack several times, the peak of entertainment
"you have become the very thing you swore to destroy" (he built a starter base)
I don't use iron golems or fight it underground because on bedrock its tackle attack creates entire ravines if you try.
People probably don't use iron golems to kill the wither, because they either want to fight it one on one, or they cheese it by spawning it under the end fountain. I could be completely wrong, but that's how I do it
Grian quote of the Year: I'm a pie man!
"Grian organisers" Me: What is this place
Hey Grian. There is this mechanic in minecraft I think where we can oxidize copper by placing an item frame on a bunch of copper blocks and hitting it with a trident with channeling. Maybe try it out sometime?
Grian, the reason nobody farms withers that way is because there's even an easier way using the end portal from the end. You can find tutorials everything on how to properly do it.
I kill withers by using end return portal bedrock suffocating, they can't attack me or leave and they take more damage than they regen
0:00 iambic pentameter :troll:
Why does nobody do this? Uhm... I did this in my very first Wither fight. And I spawned a few hundred chicken in before as well by throwing several stacks of eggs to get some wither roses along the way.
Wowo
GRIAN!!! Iskall has 2 of those music discs that you like. I think you called it Bob.
Does anyone else think the starter base looks oddly like the Owl House?
meanwhile wadzee summing 100 iron golems against a wither in hardcore 2 years ago
double bamboozled by Grian. When he was to show no junk and all labeled chests, I thought he was to show us the build actually had a backside build this time
I really like your new base Grian, but all I can see is a llama wearing a blanket and a wizard hat
What abut wadze
nobody uses iron golems for the wither fight because you can easily do it without
Grian  is my favorite  youtuber
People don't because it's somewhat expensive to get iron golem
this starterbase looks like a puppy with a witch-hat
Hermit craft DnD!!! Grian is a wizard/ alchamest.
The hoses is an elf’s shoe just so you no
Grian show try fighting the wither in bedrock edition with max armor and let the fun begin
100% the kids book..  I think it's called the woman who liked in a shoe.. I think lol..  They were mice.
Wadzee did that
Hey Grian can u do a tutorial for your starter house I realy like it and I want to have it in my word
That storage is not gonna be organized for the whole season
u seriously have log2electricboogaloo
Grian is a contributing factor of Scar’s death which we all love and completes HC. Love the both of you!!!! ❤️❤️❤️
I’m this video grian made a very nice boot
16:30 is Apothecary the word you're looking for?
Iron golem's cost alot of iron so people dont do that thing anymore👍
I can see The Entity destroying Harmitcraft 9, much like the moon did in Hermitcratf 8. Either through combustive properties or through the inability to stop it growing and seeping its way throughout the world.
I was proud that you had a back to your base. Lol
Fountain that has a emerald shower falling in it that has hoopers under the edge of the water to store some of the emeralds?
Let's..... Go❤❤❤❤
you need to give donk an area to 'power up' (steroids) useing splash speed potions, so yyou can make donk super donk
20:44 thats because you eat them when you lack a hunger point (half a bar)when they nourish 8 hunger points(4 bars)
There once was an old Grian that lived in a shoe.
so this is where the short came from...
Is anyone else terrified that the pig pen logo is a pig chef cooking pork?
Evan and Katelyn are the only ones other than you that I've seen use iron golems.
Grian you and Scar should create a beacon business
I thought you were gonna live in the entity
I love your house! Thank you for the tour and the building tips!
Can everybody join the server?
16:27 the wood there is SUS!
I'm just proud he made the back
People don’t do the iron golem strat for many reasons. 1. Rip achievement  2. The iron used to make the golems are very expensive and some people are too lazy to mine that much even with fortune 3. Pumpkins are a hassle to find early on ( imo )
Why does grian's montage song sound like fnaf's security breach song
Can't wait for that project episode.
you should change your waffle head into a pie head
will this be the season that grian builds the back of the mega base
Me who always kill the wither with iron golem: *insert pathetic meme here*
18:52 Them copper blocks be sounding like the breaking bad theme.
Does he know about copper slabs the roof could have looked better with them.
The building that had to took 1-2 hours took hours NICE GRIAN NICEEEE
Thank You for the tips ‘n tricks segment! Short and sweet addition to a fantastic show.
WHAT
Let's just all ignore the netherite ingot he had at the begining
You, scar, and mumbo should make a series where there is a really small world border, so space is very limited. It would be fun to see what shenanigans you get up to
usually people cheese the wither in the bedrock
Hermitcraft did the iron golem thing in like season 3 I believe
you might wanna use a shield to fight blazes
im not proud of grian for being organized , im proud of him for actually finishing the back of the house
Grian IMPULSE did it some days bofore only
2 on trending Lets gooo
17:31 this part really gives me the vibe your old tutorial videos.
They both basically said they don't watch Impulse.
why not use the trading hall, as a shop, where instead of selling stuff from villagers that you had to buy, you just sell the emeralds at the shop and then they can use them to buy stuff from the villagers, maybe 1 diamond for 10 emeralds or something like that.
"Sus, really sus."
11:00 wither mining new meta??????
HE DID THE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!
15:00 im proud that you did the back
1:21 jo…joseph joestar?
Bruh the reason we dont use golems is because its so easy to kill the wither on your own and its not fun waisting iron.
Grain that looks like a boot
I honestly thought he was going to brag about doing the back 15:00
Grains starterbase looks like a elf shoe
Make a messenger system with mumbo
oh i am so excited to see how you make your builds tell stories. rooting for you dude
There was an old woman who lived in a shoe. She had so many children, she didn't know what to do. She gave them some broth without any bread; And whipped them all soundly and put them to bed.
19:16 is it just me who heard "Quax"
puttar?  i heared butter
Grian's house is a shoe 😂  It looks great though
Grian should really put more of these 15:33 tips into Hermitcraft eps I miss the old tips and tricks vids
When you went to show that there were no boxes, I thought you saw that there was a back ☺
13:45 - Song is called "Walkman FM - By Lupus Nocte"
When Build Time - lapse come i am thinking about neo
You should use the wither to strip mine
Grian's base is getting more and more condensed
Can't wait to see mumbo wax your entire aging copper wall
It has a back!!!
log 2 electric boogaloo hahaha thats os funny
I genuinely thought grian was going to say, "look what I did....I finished the back. "
You said that do not use wool for things like towers.
15:00 thaught u were talking bout the back
when he said that we are going to be very proud of him I thought he was talking about that he did the back lol🤣
GriTaGo (Grian, Tango, GoodTimesWithScar)
I’m calling it: they will start a raid at the villager trading centre…
Grian seems to be adding more lore to hermitcraft and i love it.
tag 3: steal grian's looty
Grian, sorted your items and finish the back of your build day one.  You’re all grown-up😌
Is it just me or does anyone else sees a giant snake on top of grians house
Yo
Love the starter base. Looks like an alchemists hut from shovel knight.
What is An Asian Grian Fake it‘s Korian (Korean) 😅🤪😆 sry But another Great Starter Base And That’s a lot of Copper
bro your house looks like a cat
I am more proud there is a back to the house
LETS GO! #2 ON TRENDING!!!
I think the most efficient method to kill the wither ist to place it under the end portal in the end. If you do it right hes stuck and cant attack you. (This is just a tip for people reading this, im not that familiar with the Hermit rules but i guess they cant go to the end yet).
Hi
Love your work keep it up ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is grian the old lady who (built a storage house)/lived in a shoe?
all u did was build a small house campared to other good hermits u barely put any effort in
I apologize for standing on your head     I was crying with laughter
YOUR BOB ROSS      -17:18 to ??:??
The Wither be like:  "Because I hid the diamonds... RIGHT HERE!"
WELCOME TO THE NEW SEASON OF HERMITCRAFT, whats new well GRIAN IS BUILDING THE WHOLE HOUSE EVEN THE BACK.. Enjoy your stay ^^
You need to decorate your bee farm!
Love the idea of a scar, grian, and tango colab. Excited to see it come together
people mostlikely didn't use golem on wither is because before iron wasn't as easily excesssable and  they need iron blox to charge the becon
Please tell me there's a stream somewhere with Joe's live reaction to the wither spawn
Am I the only one who thinks this detailing has gone far overboard? Grians starter house this season is not looking especially good in my opinion... what does everyone else think?
You should turn the side Rick on the river into a evil base with a glass window I think that would be cool
Yea umm.. soo... Why did Grian build a magic dog as a house?
anyone else dying from the crafting table on the shoe
The only thing I’m proud of him for is doing the back of the base
Oh the artist is going to have a field trip with Grian's story
If Grian is gonna be an elf he’s gotta be a mischievous elf
I’m proud of the fact that you built the back lol
This looks so good grian!
14:34  the crafting table is a great touch
I still can't watch someone riding a donkey in Minecraft without hearing the music in my head...thanks, Mumbo...[]
What you seriously should have done was crashing at other hermits places for atleast a couple episodes and when they discover you it would be hilarious
Everyone: Grian's starter house looks like a shoe Me who sees an engine: *looks away nervously*
Impulse cam left the game😂😂😂
tutorial grian all over again  16:46
i now fight withers with iron golem
I love the williager in the end of the video sort of scowling at Grian, while walking around watching Grian closely. You can almost hear him mumbling “ young, hooligans from out of town, coming here making trouble”. 😂
Youtube tutorials be like: A simple minecraft starter house.
Yeah, it is a nice bouler. But not gonna lie, I'm happy that Grian made a proper starter base
I think grians final base should at least reference the S.C.P foundation
Me being proud of him not leaving the back unfinished
There are videos of people using Iron Golems against the Wither, but they're from like 2019 and back.
Grian I know you will never see this, but I want to let u know ur part of the reason im still here. forever love for u and the comfort every single one of ur vids bring me. <3
He did the back! HE DID THE BACK!!
"First it felt like an oasis surrounded by trees" I think you mean it's the Wonder Wall of an Oasis 😂
Pearlecentmoon kills the wither like that + you can use a bucket of powdered snow to extinguish yourself in the nether
I made a new survival world and I'm trading with villagers and I keep taking the pies and composting them 🐙
The thing looks like a seedling, a main base idea would be it evolving throughout the season
4:04
Now I know why he made that short
The real reason no-one uses iron golems to kill the Wither is that the Wither isn't actually that hard to kill. Get a smite 5 sword, some strenght potions and you can kill it in seconds.  Alternatively, you could just trap it in bedrock.
spooning the wither with iron golems isnt a thing, because there are way easier and safer ways to spoon a wither
Omfg he made the same house as last season
As soon as scar was about to put the last head on the wither, an ad popped up for the HSE: Sex? Fact or Fiction?
Why do I get a felling of this being a warped version of your base from season 8
maybe it's just me, but if you have access to shulker boxes, I just color them up, use a barrel of boxes for the main resources, and another 5 barrels filled with shulker boxes for bulk storage. this way, in 6 barrels, I have the equivalent of 67 double chests. with a small GUI mod like ShulkerBoxTooltip that lets you see in the shulkers directly in the inventory, it allows me to have absolutely everything in a very small room. :) hope this helps someone!
Tango or impulse ( I forget )  just built an OP zombie / drown farm. No way you can compete mining copper.
"You're gonna be proud of me!"  Oh my god could it be... "I... did... the..." Omg be did the back be did the back! "Storage system!" :/
Grian, can this season be a redstone Grian one ???
next time built a hopper floor, so the first item stacks get sucked in save.
I saw a youtuber who put the wither against 100 iron golems
That stater base looks like lamma or alpaca tbh.🦙
i think i would die if i play survival with grian i would just be organizing chests and him plomping out more chests ( just like my friend lol)
There is a crafting table in the roof
Can i join hermitcraft server grian plzz
That water bucket clutch made my day.
probably before the update, in just stone, the wither creates a really big hole and the golems don't get a chance to gang up on him.
grian: (organises storage) me and everyone watching: (HAPPY TEARS WITH VIGOROUS APPLAUSE) *HE’S FINALLY DONE IT. OUR GRIAN IS FINALLY GROWING UP.*
He did the back of the starter house!!!
scar- POOTER grian- pu'er my speakers- butter
14:55 Grian: "You guys are gonna be so proud of me" Me: "bro Grian I don't see where the back of your shoe is"
he did the back lets go grian
ㅤ
#2 on gaming pog
Hi, haven't been here lately, how did season 8 end?
The reason why nobody used to do that is because of stone's relatively low blast resistance. Unless you had enough golems to kill the wither almost instantly it would quickly bust out a path to float up out of the golems' reach. Now that deepslate(with it's higher blast resistance) takes up so much room at the bottom of the world, I expect to see the golem strategy much more often.
20:50 I bet you recorded that moment at pi day too
I'm kinda a new viewer and seeing Grian's videos it was very entertaining and fun 😊
He made the back?
Does anyone know where I can find the reference grian used?
I hope this season, all this hermitcraft will do a collab timelapse for building a one huge zetabase...
The raid farm above the villagers USA great idea!
14:55 I thought he was going to show us that he did the back, because we all know that it pretty exciting when Grain does that.
Grian??? Organised???? That doesnt feel right. He must've spent an entire week doing that!
HE DID THE CLUTCH
Your base looks like as Llamas with a wizard hat.
8:21 cause killing the wither is quite ez
11:22 don't
Will poultry man return who knows wait till next episode
The house looks like an jesters shoe
Grian I thought you were better than this mining dirt with a pickaxe rEally!?
I don’t think people have done it because stone is not as blast resistant. So in stone the wither would make a bigger hole, and the Iron golems would not be able to hit and get through the terrain. But with Deepslate, now it is reasonable because it contains the wither more.
The curly roof definitely represents some kind of alchemist
i thought it was only me that thinks its a shoe until I saw the comments
Grian: This is my not so starter base. Me: It's a fancy shoe dude.
I love you're videos
Grian: house of alchemist or magician     Everyone: *S H O E*
Lol joe and Keralis being scared when the wither got spawned.  tbf when it's that close I'd be scared too
I swear, someone is going to put a beak on that house. It is asking to be a duck
season 7 time lapse music is my favorite
Logs 2 : Electric boogaloo
I have seen ytbrs doing the iron golem thing, but the way you did it was so much better
Grian without a shield: man, Blazes are hard to kill
About time!
bruh you put the back on
Grian literally caught scar red handed
I'm a bit shocked when I randomly skip to the dog part cuase my name is putter lol
starter base kinda look like a lama
Who are you and what have you done with grian
Why does de starter base's roof looks like a shoe?
the storage room
can we get a serious round of applause for the thing
Im so proud of grian rn bcuz of him having a proper storage system lol
you also could just create the golems in the same room then build the wither and walk to safety.
"Dont know if iron golem will work" They have killed the wither for many years... Also anyone getting frieza vibes from the "Alien"?
Grian I did this months ago...
GRIAN USE A DAMN SHIELD FOR ONCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bouldha lvl3
Am I the only one who has one working earbud
i am proud because there is a back to your base that is the thing that surprised me the most
Grian: “This build is intend to look like a magician or alchemist's house” Scar:  "Grians built a giant cat wearing a hat"
Dnd
hermitcraft is just learning the fastest and easiest way to kill the wither, and it gets soo easy to the point where these guys just do it fr fun, last time they dropped those dripstones on 'em and this time they made the golems do it fr them... you learn something new everyday no?
Hermitcraft is dying, sad….
Use Blast furnace for smelting the Raw copper , it is way more faster
I am so happy that grian finaly got organised. I am not going to lie I thought Grian's idea of organising would look suspiciously like LDShadowlady's in her newest video. Glad to see I was wrong.
Yes, good good. Now let think of a easyer way to kill weather in bedrock.
Wow homebody has brand loyalty
I tried this but it wasn’t in a box so he was up like 10 blocks in the air
Grain, your house is a shoe
Is that the house of Gandalf the Gradient?
If you had watched impulses survival series you would have seen him do this
15:27 if you look at one of the chests, it says 'Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo' lol
Put s string on the top of the warped stem
Creepers aren’t sustainable so why are they sus
i've never been more proud of you Grian
Hi Grian, huge fan I had an Idea that you could make a small copper viewing platform so that you are able to view the entity and study it.
Scar be like : well I guess mountains were fun but I’m just gonna copy my season 7 base
bruh
I’m going to say something and you will not be able to unsee it carrots
Grian I find it hard to believe that you organized. Is this a dream ?
14:55 I thought he was gonna say 'I did the back!'
The iron golem strat has been discovered a while
I really like that u made a little tutorial for decoration inside the house, I really needed it :D
Its even easier if you spawn it under the end endportal :D it gets stuck and you can easily kill it too
Impulse did it in hardcore!
where is the guuuuud bye at the end of the clip :(
i saw more suprised to see the back finished
It's not pooter or puhter. It's putter.
Anyone else think that the starter base looks like a dog
you might as well sell beacons now with the help of the golems
I was absolutely loving your starter base until I realised that it kind of looks like an elf shoe...
the like button makes fireworks now
I was about to fall asleep then I saw this and had to go play Minecraft
lots of people use iron golems to kill withers just some youtubers want to have better entertainment
I think it would look nice for a section of your floor to be warped nylium. Kind of like a rug, and more interesting than just wood.
Because it's a waste of iron :)
My first thought that Grian made a huge elven shoe. Could be Scar's shoe.
I'm prod of you grian you finally got rid of that chest monster and also made the back of your house very good looking
Does anyone have a Twitter account called Yuma if so : )
Congrats on organising labelling all your stuff Grian!!!
Mubo liked potatos and now grian likes pies
You house looks like an  "elf shoes"
Any other Danes who were confused about "putter"? xD
I’ve used golems to do it awhile ago
this house has too much floor space to stay organized right?
I'm loving the new timelapse music!
Sorry grian...but that's a shoe
I literally hope you make a Moria or Erebor inspired base.
Excited for the three of you collabing!!!!
iron golems are kind of expensive, thats why most people just kill it with sword and bow underground
That house looks like something I'd imagine out of a Terry Pratchett book.
Love the synergy between pearl and Grians builds
Looks like a dog with a wizard's hat
Can we please name the entity Jet??????
Poor wadzee. Just hoping grian would see what he did
You've really stepped u the music game this season! *chef's kiss* Love it!
Hey Grian at 14:30 your house kinda looks like a little dog with a hat .
Not gonna lie the base looks like a boot
U said u wouldn’t make a starter base😡
7:00 made me choke on my boba tea. Thanks for the laugh
just me or hes base looks like a dog???
Next grain should just building a prison and just hire scar as a guard
How do you join hermitcraft?
I’m surprised you did the back
That copper around Mumbo's base will never age, he will axe it and wax it at any opportunity, how could he not
Grian fighting blazes with nearly full hearts: panic. Me fighting wither skeletons on half health: this is fine
Well hello there
Wow! Grian finished the back of a build for once!
Grain.
Omg this wither killing was amazing! I cannot believe this!! Going to try this out on our server asap!!!
As much as I want Grian to get rich off copper, there is no way Grian can compete with Tango's copper farm.
You should make a soup shop. With suspicious soups,  stews and more. Pls 🙏. Thx
when working with semi oxidized copper i like to just oxidize all of my copper first since all copper types can be made from fully green copper, then if i need a certain partially oxidized type i just use my axe to remove a few layers after its placed that way i only need to work with 1 type of copper at a time
its a shoe
the wither could havr broke out from stone so they didnt think about deepslate
Etho does it, grian
"If it's stupid, but it works, it's not stupid." I dunno who said that, but that applies to your copper selling
I garentee grian will give up on netheritr beacon
has anyone grabbed the dragon egg yet?
strange that I didn't see mumbo even once this ep
Why does everytime grain says the entity i think of the backrooms?
I wouldn't recommend selling copper given what Tango's been up to.
Tango has infinte and hes gonna sell it
I love it when Grian says "Let's Go"
15:14 *Sniff*Tear of proudness 🥲
Your starter base looks like a shoe.
11:15 Togethe-eghghghguughgh
Nobody does this because it costs a lot of iron haha
I love making all blocks in nether
Haven’t watched in a while but why was the other season so short
The reason no one does this is because it’s easier and less expensive to kill them with swords 😂😂
someone should tell him about Tango's op copper farm...
If you go to the end you can spawn rhe wither under the portal and you wouldn’t take any damage
Did anyone hear Skar say hm what would the tast like (villagers).
Impulse does it  He traps wither under end portal in the end and then golems kill the wither
Wizard house
did anyone else realise that the chests were labled logs and logs 2 : electric boogaloo
And tango builds another raid farm
I was just surprised ha had 4 walls
14:38 the build/ starter house grain made. I give it 4/10 Honestly not up to the grain standard. Disappointed that grain built a build which dosent look that good.... Also 15:17 Garin didn't you say you won't be organised in chests in season 8?
5:57 General Kenobi
"i'm a pie guy" *cooked prokchop goes from 32 to 31*
Grian i know you dont know me but i would like to see a steampunk style mega base or a city lol
If you do a mega base, could you try doing a vertical hole in the ground and make like a huge nuke bunker or nuke launch or rocket station
Grian actually organizes himself :0
grian the iron golem sommoner
Oh no........the the the... 😱😱😱😱😱             CHEST MONSTER
Love your vids  You make me happy and you inspired me to make youtube vis
Grian If you make hello Caves make the walls of the Caves more thick it would look natural
I'm actually proud when you organized your stuff 😭
tip bring a shild to the nethre
Grian, Scar and Mumbo are the new trio besties in Minecraft.. love seeing the 3 doing things together..
Better if you make 3 halls off of the room you will spawn the wither in and put the golems in the halls then spawn the wither and run to your safe spot… one point… unless you get at least one hit on the wither you don’t get any credit for killing it…
Grian im not sure if you like to take comments' suggestions or if you have tried this already, but can you make that droopy hanging part on the upper tower of your house's roof turned around? i think it would look better if they were facing in towards each other
Grian you should get fake wither heads and prank people by pretending your spawning a wither in their base
Can you tell us what's keeping Mumbo busy in your next video?
You should turn the inside of the boulder into a geode and incorporate a circular nether portal for the door way you can walk through the portal into the purple geode inside
"Once Apon a time there was a boulder, mysterious yet devine , every day the boulder brings stuff nobody knows  how or why, the people living near the boulder call it the entity. Now a person from a faraway place has come to study the entity, he calls himself an alchemist but nobody knows who he is or where he came from.  To Be Continued  In the next Episode in The World of HermitCraft
GRIAN YOU MAD GENIUS (thats an avatar refrance)
pogis
Pretty sure etho or Doc killed the wither with Iron Golems before. Put the end portal/bedrock trick is even easier. So people do that.
Im proud of you grian for sorting your cupboard, here's a cookie 🍪 !!
I hope at 3:00 you meant "netherite, beacons, the works." and not "netherite beacons, the works." because those are 2 very different things...
Y U No Use Blast Furnace to smelt copper.... Sad Pepe Face
The house feel eldritch
15:10 - big proud
Wow that copper is a pain with towers
Bro the time lapse music is great keep it up grian.
Sus = sustainable most Mumbo fans know that (i think)
It’s a magic cat house! 😁
Grian built a witches shoe
Is it just me or does the starterbase look like a shoe
noooo not the storage system. you can not be so sufisticacated
Why did I never come up with the idea to use iron golems as mercenaries? I usually get rid of them because there's just soooo many in my village 🙄 In my next world I'm just gonna breed my villagers in a confined underground space and make a golem farm like I'm supposed to lol. EDIT: love the 80s track at 13:27 🕺✨
The dripstone trick is still the best and easiest wayt to kill the wither by far
“Sus=Sustainable”—-Mumbo Jumbo
He's now just the old woman who lived in a shoe.
“Why don’t people use it more”   Well you see, the Java wither is easily exploitable and the bedrock wither is basically unleashing unstoppable destruction upon the land of Minecraft
grain being oblivious to the fact that what he was doing at 9:22 is simpler and possibly quicker was amazing
NO THE CHEST MONSTER!
People dont use iron golems because they are too expensive and you can just use a bow and tunnel
id say its theme would be viking mixed with magician
people dont use golems because its a waste of iron when you might as well just kill it youreself
There once was an old man who lived in a shoe, but now it's a young lad, storing stuff in a jester themed boot.   About the copper, just carry the wax with you, oxidize the lot, and use an axe to trim it back as needed.
5:40 so this is where the video idea came from?
Maybe it would be cool if u took that blue vine and wrap it around the house like a staircase to get to the roof
Ya I do kill withers with iron golem in my server I have a automatic wither farm 😂
Hey Grian. I think entity should be filled with water so you can have max effect from sea heart
Grain: I also organized it in a way that can be decorated :)))  Me over here in my dirt hut ._.
With the archer in the thumbnail it looks like a shoe has met their maker.
Make it so the boulder have mechanical legs made out of copper and inside the rock is the powersource for it to move , just like howl’s moving castle
15:18 Grian im so proud of you <3 finally!
9:58 nobody does this because we dont get the satisfaction
looks like a shoe lol
You’ve been over doing ur builds lately
grian : Makes a massive preparation to kill one Wither While me : **Fights 3 withers with unenchanted iron armor and an axe**
The fact defeating the wither with golems wouldn't work on bedrock, kinda sucks, but hey least its an actual boss fight ig 💀
Also just make a pork pie
I love how everyone ignored scar saying "what do they taste like" when talking about villagers
Not gonna lie, I didn't get the "Your hands are red" joke until I watched Scar's video. Lol great pun Grian
14:55 I thought Grian was gonna show us that he completed the back of the base. Also, why is there a crafting bench on the roof?
I JUST REALIZED THAT GRIAN MADE THE BACK OF THE BASE :O
Wow
Hermitcraft 9:Episode 3 - GRIAN LORE!
to be honest I thought you where gonna say there is no back of the house instead of random junk after timelapse
why no one uses iron golems are because not everyone has like 30 irons blocks at hand, and that it's much more cost efficient and simpler to just fight it yourself  also use shields against blazes if theyre a problem
Why are non of the hermits using blast furnaces!!!!
Who would have thought he would be organized and that he would finish the back
anyone else notice the "logs 2 electric boogaloo" sign on a chest? is that gonna be the new tag?
wait a minute, when did Grian become an Interior Decorator?
Make a story about the entity  that will be cool
E
The most prideful part of the starter base isn't the existence of a storage system, it's that is has a back.
Call your house ‘The dragon’s tail’
Is it just me or does the house look kinda like a pointy shoe? The lil ol grian who lived in a shoe This reminds me greatly of that nursery rhyme
"the entity spoke to me, it told me it didn't want to be a house." oh god he's gonna start a cult isn't he?
I thought you were going to say that we would be proud of you for doing the back of the starter base :P
*No one uses iron golems to kill the wither because it's expensive and more boring.* 😐 *And it's more UNaffective in bedrock edition* 🙁
I would love to see a alchemist grian skin to match the house and entity, and I’m obsessed with the copper color on the house!!!!
grian, your default is not stupid. your default is insane, strange and annoyingly talented, and we love you for it.
Your not standing on our faces, your jumping on our faces. LoL 😂
Just a heads up Withers and wither skeletons can be damaged by splash potion of healing
place your bets on how long grians storage will stay tidy here
When both Grian and Scar organize their chests   You know the season will be next level
After seeing some of Grian's latest builds i would love to see some more updated building tips and tricks
Tango's copper farm is nothing to sneeze at, i'm sure with this raid farm/villager setup he'd be willing to part with some copper as well.
I think people don’t use the iron golem method because some people like to fight the wither early game and iron golems are too expensive for them but a late game I don’t know why people don’t do it
The base sorta looks like a cat. In a hat
Isn't that based from 7ds
the base looks like a rubber duck at certain angles
you should build ifel tower from paris
Golems have definitely used to kill the wither before. Cough* Wadzee *cough
New montage music is awsome guessing it’s by Jono?
And just like that everyone from here on out will be using iron golems to kill the whither
at 15:00 i thought he was going to the back and say "i did the back"
Yes Grian we are proud of your organization and Minecraft skills 🤩🤩
Grian you put your looty in a booty. It's the looty boot.
What if you turned the entity into the heart of a sleeping giant, or a sleeping golem or something
looks like a shoe lol
5:13 Grian you threw your pickaxe away RIP iron pickaxe you will be Forgotten
When he said “You’re gonna be proud of me.” I honestly thought he built a back, I didn’t realise I was that stupid.
You live in a shoe...
I am sorry, but I keep seeing a witches shoe when I look at your storage home. BTW still looks great😁
Seeing you build and detail with Minecraft's somewhat limited blocks makes me excited to see what you'll pull off in hytale when it releases.
Grian: you guys are going to be so proud of me.....  Me: this wont last long
sell oxidized copper  for more expensive
Just a little bit scared that this organising want survival long
The boulder looks like a huge big toe poking out of the ground you should build the rest of the foot like there is a big giant in the ground
10:00, nice idea if a bit resource intensive. I think i stick with the bedrock suffocation method in vanilla. On Sevtech we build a killing chamber tough and made nether stars orderable trough our RF system. The killing cage was in one of these miniature world cubes so that we have a containment if something goes wrong and that we don't have the boss meter on screen all the time.
Umm, is grian possessed by an organising demon?
Trending
Hey grian, it's not yumar it's oomar take my name for example: Omar.S.Sherif Pls   And I'm not hating, just cos I'm a Muslim,   it doesn't feel good to hear yumar
Uhmmm I’m sorry but did anyone else not notice the LITERAL STACKS OF DEEPSLATE ON THE GROUND AFTER KILLING THE WITHER. Like bruh Imagine a fully automated wither deepslate farm. Everyone complains how painful deepslate is to collect. Grain coulda made a fortune out of this last szn and stock up deepslate 10x more without the hassle and all the $$$$
Oh, so it's not supposed to be a jester's shoe?
Grians base is a dog with a wizard hat!
Does anyone know which Hermit has done the Statues and I always love how Grian has the ability to mix so many different blocks of different colors with different textures and make it look good!
15:00 this is an accomplishment (especially for Grian)
8:21 there’s a guy called wadzee who actually did this with a 100 iron golems and got them to fight the wither.
Nobody does that cause they are better than u at this game and don't need help of iron golems
hi grian  the reason why people dont use iron golems is that its expensive in iron and its extremely easy to kill it in a tunnel with just a sword as you also showed us 😀
and a idea is a rubixcube on a unicycle doing a rubixcube
hi grian. i love your videos, keep up the good work. plus can you do build your comments again pls
FINALLY!! I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS VIDEO!!!!!
THATS a lot of copper
Did scar seriously ask what villager tastes like?
that water clutch was amazing 0:30
Tangos copper farm might put you out of business grain
Do you play after life?
I got the notification of you uploading you how to kill athe wither ass soon as you killed the wither in the ep
Are you playing after life?
14:47 is that a orange and lime flavor sorbet  roof top, really looks like sorbets i want some now, hmmmmm yummy i wanna eat your house now
this episode was made by grien the mustache man not grian who makes a chest monster every season
YESSS Grian finished the back!
*If I was you I would make a secret base in the boulder* -Less griefing -no mobs - no weird mumo vault
If you put the wither under the Enderportal in the End, you can kill it a lot easier without taking any damage. It will just be stuck in the bedrock of the portal.
GRIAN: Living under a rock is not always a good thing Me: (Sarcastic tone) NOOOOO NOOOO I DID NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT Still love ur creativity
Did you do the back grian
15:00 Grian: aren't you so proud? I tidied up all my junk Me: honestly mate, I'm more proud you built a back to your house
You should build a house on the entity and then build more and more on it kinda like when you had that thing with the houses that you made in season 6 build off
Because it's a waste of resources, and way easier just to do what you were doing before the iron golems attacked.
There was a Grian who lived in a Shoe...       Do any of you guys know this poem?
As soon as grian said its all label anf organized I was like 🤨🤨🤯🤯🤯😵😵😵
GRIANS ALL GROWN UP!! HES FINALLY SORTED :O :D
There was an old lady who lived in a shoe
You just found a deepslate mine! Use the wither to get loads of deepslate!
Gues that Iskal needs to accept diorite🕺
Mumbo is definitely going to axe off the oxidation....
Please make a map of everywhere around you like in season seven, but do one now do you can see who it changes from the very beginning
Thanks for the interior tips and tricks ... i suck at making a good interior but im happy to learn some tricks about it !
At 14:56 I thought he was going to say I did the back
Grian n can not get a shulker box or else it would be messy again.
The bad thing about it is that you don’t the achievement
I made some tea and sandwiches and got ready to watch this video :D
With Grian being so seemingly religiously into pies this season, could you say he’s… *PIE*-OUS?
Hey G, there is an amv named 'bang' its based on last life, its pretty cool, i suggest you to check it out cause i thought you would like it
"i'm about to do something very stupid" yeah not listening to you past self
who else thought that when he said we were gonna be proud he was gonna go to the back cause I mean its pretty obvious thats what we wanted
Wadzee did it too
For your mega base you could try something different you could make a mining village on the mountain where you got all of that iron and coal. I was thinking that instead of going big you could focus on the smaller details that really make a base shine.
This isn't grian,it's an imposter. Grian is the face of chaos.
Youtube getting way too comfortable with these 2 unskippable ads
there are so many people did that like 100 golem 1 wither and such things
Cat base
I thought you would want to live under a rock :/
meanwhile  wadz with a hundred golems one weather
Pretty sure mumbo did the iron golem strat against a wither at one point in one of the seasons, I could be completely wrong tho
You actually organized your junk… are you feeling okay?
You should have done the build on the first episode? In my smp I’m on episode 4 with no kind of base…. I just sleep in my friends😅
I am sosososooooo proud of you and this time youse it .
The alchemists shoe
The starter base kinda looks like a dog
Sell pre-oxidized copper
Hey grian. You should be a archetet! lol jk!
I think grian is the only person who can use diorite in builds an making something beautiful
wait, a new timelapse music!!!
15:13 It'll last 2-3 days max lmao
when he said that we'd be proud, i thought he was gonna show us the back
9:22 Grian demonstrating how easy it is to kill the wither with just a tunnel and a sword. 9:54 Grian wondering why people don't spend 5 stacks of iron to kill the wither
You need to watch Impulse. 🤣
Grian-. making my way up to the sky with copper ore, a creeper past I think I'm gonna die
No one does it because normally they defeat the dragon first so the wither can be killed under the end portal in the end so it can't attack you
Grian: ”sus, super sus”
don't you know you can take out a wither with bare hand spawning it below the end return portal?
GRIAN USE BLAST FURNACES
the base looks like a cool unicorn but the unicorn part looks like a witch hat
I'm more surprised that this build has a back more than anything else
Elf village I like that
I love the fact that not only is he dedicated to eating pie, he also have a 'precious pie' chest xD <3
bro, good job on #2 trending also i love your vids but i can join and can you bring back the Q and A from season six plz
Try Using bundles solves a lot of decoration problems.(keep at least 4)
In truth the Entity is just Grian's way of introducting the Hermitcraft - Dead by Daylight crossover
What if someone made a song with the golems withering away
Looks like a shoe :D
pov: every grian video is on gaming trend
My Default is Stupid. - Grian, 2022
I am so so so so so so so so so so so so so SO PROUD OF U GRIAN I CANT BELIEVE UR ACTUALLY BEING ORGANIZED THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT IS ✨✨✨✨✨
Warning:do not try this on Bedrock version It just gonna end really badly
Alchemist, you say? And here I thought Grian was becoming the little old woman who lived in a shoe. What’s up, Grian? Have so many chests and don’t know what to do?
Scar: "Happy birthday grian!" (NOT SUS) scar grian's birthday is in august!
Is it just me or the starter base looks like a boot
11:20
java players 😒
14:55 "You're gonna be so proud" honestly thought he was gonna show us that he completed the backside of the build
poor joe, no-one responded to him
Please make “Grians pie” merch. Like actual pies
I'm actually surprised that I don't really like the cottage. It feels too open. I kinda prefer a slightly more encloused room when it comes to older buildings. I prefer open stuff with modern stuff. Still a brilliant build. Just not my cup of tea.
I LOVE GRAIN VIDS THEY ARE INTERESTING
Day 3 of saying that clicking copper blocks with water bottles oxidizes them.
Because using Iron Golems for killing wither is a total waste you can just hit him when he’s chasing you and breaking blocks in the hole you mined
wa--wai-WAIT HE DID THE BACK OF THE HOUSE?!?! WHAT IS THIS
Grian. Use the wither to farm deepslate then sell the deepslate. Stonks. So much easier than selling copper!
You guys are too busy playing Hermitcraft to notice that; YES, some players DO kill withers with golems!
This season Grian is Scar. Bases tell the story, copper roofs and that music... GoodTimesWithGrian?
Happy birthday
Grain " it's meant to be like an alchemisty house  Me " it's a shoe, it.is.a.shoe"
Hey the wither battle was just like the last video. Also when grian said bring it in doesn’t sound familiar in Encanto
THE VOLCARBO
Anyone else see the starter base as a really fancy boot?
When you said "You are going to be proud of me because...", I thought you were going to say "I actually built the back this time"
❤❤
Episode 1: “I’m not gonna make a starter base this season” -Grain  Episode 3: *grain makes a starter base*  also something seems off… grian? a sorting system?  i think something has happened
I used warped vines for my survival home and world
he finally did the back edit: no one cares he did the back????
For all the things for getting proud of you the best thing is that you finished the back of starter base! Such an amazing build!
Why not make a Flying Base :> Just sayin'😆
heh
Don't like the squiggly bits on the roof
.... It looks like shoe. It looks like a boot with a curly tip. Right next to the wood elf... It's an elf shoe. XD
IDK man this is my regular strat
Did anyone notice that when left the game it said 'Badtimewithscar left the game' ?
It’s easier to just hit the wither underground than than to spend stacks of iron to kill it
17:02 BadTimesWithScar???? I’m missing something here-
15:26 did NOT see that coming, my jaw actually dropped
i love these  episodes
Every time he says the entity I get dead by daylight PTSD
Who thinks grian and trixy blox should do a build battle ?
Build swap
the time lapse at around 13:30 reminded me of security breach music
15:12... Who is this man? They musta got a replacement for Grian!
When grian is proud of himself he talks about somekind of fantasy
"Peanut butter" - grian
Anyone else see a shoe for the "storage house"😂
There was an old Grian who lived in a shoe
Grian thinks we are impressed It's labeled PFF nah were surprised you made the back this time!
I love the hermit craft series so far. Also, please do more of h to par tips and tricks like you did in the house. It really helps out
Hey it would be very helpful if someone told me what the plugin/mod that the hermits use to make it so the grass blocks and gold when there is one under to the side of it thank you!
NICE MLG BRO
Hey grian, I gotta say, the house kinda looks like a dog. There, now you can't unsere it.
many people don't use iron golem on wither because they want to defeat the boss themself and using iron golems is easier than defeating it yourself
Dear Grien, if you want another successful business like the barge, sell oxidized copper, they are so annoying to collect.
Guys hi did it
Hey grian 3 days ago was PI DAY
"Sus, super sus." ~Grian 2022
Rocc
OMG He organize!!! WHAAAAAAT??
When he said we were gonna be proud, I thought he did the back .
It looks like a duck
If you wanna sell copper you might wanna partner up with tango, he did just build a massive copper farm 😂
I can see it.. Food Wars
Your starter base looks like your "starter" base last season
Ethos does this as a Wither farm. He used the end exit portal to trap the wither and uses iron golems to defeat it
Mumbo needs to wax the copper haha
That is a bdubs hous
Kinda looks like a horse XD
Anyone else think grians starter base looks like a snake stuck in a house?
A full chest of copper ore makes 3 stacks of copper blocks if that helps with the math  So selling copper is um… tedious to say the least.
"They're the bet food because they are like one of the worst foods" - Grian 2022 20:39
HE DID THE BACK!
Wow.. youre stronger than me :D i made automatic sorter, even for things i would never have... I dont use it either.
the fact that he was so happy when he made the mlg water bucket was wholesome and the main reason people dont do this is because they save up blocks for the beacon and not waste it on a wither when you can dig a really long hole and at the end you spawn it and constantly hit it while you are backing away at the tunnel and it kills the wither faster than iron golems could of you have a smite sword
I know the pythonator (formerly pythonmc) has used iron golems to kill the wither, he also only summoned one iron golem, and gave it loads of potion buffs, and let it take on the wither one on one!
I am very proud of you grian :D
I think this is my favourite hermitcraft episode since season six, I just absolutely loved this. There was everything I love about grians videos all in one: building tips, messing with friends, interactions both with friends and hermits he doesn’t talk to as much (tango), announcing a long-term project, coming up with new ways to fight mobs, a beautiful starter house. This was amazing!!
Nobody does the iron golem strategy because you can literally just trap it in the bedrock pillar in the end portal if you summon the wither below it. You take 0 damage, all you have to do is dig out a small room and place 5 total obsidian, then you can literally just punch it to death without armor on
I never played the game, so quick question: does copper aging-speed change in the nether or the end?
I'm pretty sure the main reason people don't do that is a combination of people not thinking about it, people not wanting to cheese the wither, and there being an easier method to cheese by spawning it under the bedrock fountain in the end
Is it just me or you made using acacia beautiful
for some reason "the entity spoke to me" feels like it will come up in future animations
Grian, Mumbo, Scar the best trio i think ur the only 3 utubers that i watch in hermit craft
use blast furnace grian its more faster👍👍
You invented a new mining method, the Wither mining. He was like, aha! my diamonds were hidden just right there!
Why was seson 8 over so quik?
by the way a wither can be used to mine for ancient debris and you can just have some iron golems in a room at the end of a tunnel to kill it.
Happy holi Grian and everyone!
Grians house looks like an Elfs shoe
I mean, wadzee. Stupid auto correct
Screw that, I'm impressed he did the back
8:30 I used to use golems all the time for my wither fights. I built a village underground just to get free golems for the withers. The wither never bothered the villagers because it was too busy with the golems. 6 or 7 golems was usually enough. Note, I made the arena out of obsidian to stall the wither's escape. This was pre 1.16 stuff.
Wad really killed the wither with a hundred iron golems
16:19 PLEASE STRIP THAT ACACIA LOG.
Grain you made the back of your base I’m so proud of you 😂
Impulse has done this after building a wither sceleton farm. Then he built many withers under the center of the End island. The golems were just killing the wither wich was unable to do anything. That was s. 7
Peanut butter:D
It reminds me of Jafar's Shoes from Aladdin
O
already a chest monster on ep 3
Hi
There was an old man who lives in a shoe!!!
so this season, Grian lives in a boot, nice.
i am proud grian !
For my first wither fight, I was super nervous and made 20+ iron golems to help. It was over within 5 secs. I got one bow in and it was gone. It was the most boring wither fight ever.
I love Joehills
Omg you filled in the back! Nice! Grian going pro. Lol
im kinda getting the egg (dsmp) vibe from the entitie
Such a fun episode ♥️
Ohhhh, so this is what that short was about
Mumbo’s gonna wax that copper
I love the base and colors! The roof kinda reminds me of chili peppers 🌶  Love it!
it sorta looks like a boot (grians house)
thought the surprise about the house would be that there is a back
Love the use of diorite
14:08 Iskall be like
Imao
soup
that crafting table on the build roof is driving me a little nuts could you remove it please ; thankyou
21:14 Grian has been spending too much time with scar lmao that was exactly Scars little scream XD
Nothings stupid in minecraft anymore 😆
When he said we will be proud of him, I thought he was meaning that the starter base has a back lol 😂
If you're selling copper I hope you know copper is more common in drip stone caves
I want to see how long you can orgnce
im surprised he actually did the bak of the house this time
that house ain’t no base that’s a boot
21:08 - "Lately he (Scar) has been climbing up tall spaces, jumping off, and landing in a bucket of water"  OK here's the prank: Make one of those world-height MLG bucket challenges like Zedaph did - except at the bottom, instead of having him land on bedrock or normal stone, you have him land on stone top-slabs. He'll jump down and try to drop the bucket, but instead of making a puddle for him to land in, it'll water-log the slab and he'll splat.
Your house looks like a dog Idk why I see it like this lol
grian and tango talking then scar just 23:47
Why does no one fight the wither under the end portal thing? Like it’s so easy. Less effort than digging down and spawning iron golems.
Great organization...anyone else think it will last maybe 2 episodes
To me it looks nearly like a goat with a tail and horn. But I LOVE it 😻
What i am proud is that upon making the starter base there is actually no large hole at the back of the starter base after the actual episode XD
16:48 should be a grian teaches how to build video
Grian bedrock withers have doubled the health and they explodes on death
Grain lives in a giant boot now? 👢
I was proud of gruan for cleaning everything up and labeling it. But I'm more proud of him for finishing the back. Finnaly my dude did the back😩😩
I didn't really care that he had become organized I acutely like it when he wasent but when he said we would be proud I thought he was talking about the back of the house
You should replace some of the signs from your chests to item frames, or even glowing item frame because they look a lot better.
I love the building tips you implemented! Keep doing stuff like that if you can it's really helpful
Grian tango has a supper effective copper farm you can try to make one of your own
Man it just looks like the shelves are seperated and supported bu chocolate
Minecraft inventory really needs an improvement, block numbers have more than doubled in recent years and nothing but Shulker boxes has really helped that. The "Bag" half introduced in 1.18 was kind of a lame joke as it only helped stack items that don't match. We could really use something like the Tool bar swap that you can do in creative.
Looks like a good wither mining sesion
It's the observatory
Has anyone notice it kinda looks like the starter base is in season 7??
Scar is going to call that house a shoe.
It looks like a shoe
14:11 there was an old grian who lived in a shoe
Nice shoe, Grian
14:24 - storage house (Not finished watching)😅 (Just finnished the vid.)(amazing vid😊)
I dont know if anybody else noticed but the wither is actually a great way to get lots of deepslate in one go, instead of swinging your sword you could just keep punching it and it would perform its block breaking animation, afterwards you can kill it by whacking its feet
17:01  badtimeswithscar left the game
what about the elytra?
most people dont use iron golems because its already really easy in my opinion to do raids and the wither especially, without them. i mean you saw yourself how you could just slowly back away and hit it with your sword.
I like the gradient with copper
grian pls train scar for mcc so he doesnt get the most deaths record
I had the best times as ever. Right as scar placed the either skull I got an ad for guildwars 2 with fancy epic music
I wish the wither was that easy in bedrock
It’s so sweet how close grian and scar are!! I’m very excited to see what happens in the future of this season! <3
I thought it was a shoe your starter house
15:00 anyone else thought he was gonna say “I did the back”
The organization of chest is nice ,at least he's got the back done
Here's a cool tip, use barrels instead of chests for storage because they cause less lag
Copper was rare last season and when its available easily every hermit is opening shops !! ... False, Grian and Tango with Super OP Farm
Iskall may be furious when he sees that you used Diorite.  It looks amazing tho.
Yes give me that Juicy lore
I don't know what, but there's a feeling why I love Hermitcraft SO MUCH.
Is it me or dose grians starter base look like a shoe from the story “There was an old lady who lived in a shoe
Grian can you show the seed for this ppppppllllllllssssss
Also the back
15:15 WHAT?! IS THIS THE ALTERNATE UNIVERSE?! LMAO
The reason nobody does this is that the wither is so easy that it is not worth to spend the iron. If you have enchanted gear the wither is a walk in the park and if you use smite and strength potions it just takes literal seconds
Double up on the Golem method, hit them with splash potions of Regen, strength, etc
Anyone else thought he was going to say he finished the back when he said you guys are going to be proud of me?
Iron golems really do be making a best at 9:45
lol i thought everyone used iron golems XD
There is one thing I think we all say we are proud of in the starter base: HE FINALLY DID THE BACK!
At the wither bit, the whole time I was thinking "He's done it before, he'll do it again." From the boatem wither.
joe just getting so confused in the chat
wow the chest monstar is gone its ded
I love your starter base!! I made a little wizard tower with the same dark to white gradient (with spruce wood for roof and also amethyst) way back during one of your building tips videos on how to do gradients! :D So happy you've done one as well!
I have seen a lot of smaller youtubers use iron golems for wither fights. PaulGG being the first that comes to mind!
Why does no one do this  Grian has 8 iron golem Me: YEAH I WONDER WHY
What if HermitCraft is just a tabletop game but from the perspective of the character? Almost like d&d  Because I have to say these bases look like little props
What made me prouder was the back there is a back to the storage 😂
Everyone else spawns it trapped in bedrock lol
Grian, another YouTuber/Hermit who uses golems to kill the wither is Etho & Iskall, they trap it under the end portal and use golems to quickly slay it
Well done Grian. I’m proud of you.
Scar is literally the cutest! 😍
Imagine mumbo just waxes all the copper so that the purpose of it there to age is gone lmao
Impusle did it in is hardcore series
16:43 im getting some Dream SMP egg vibes
really curious as to what the seed is
you built scar's (an elfs) shoe
Who are you and what did you do with grian, did npc grian replace you, grian can't be this organized, it's impossible!!!
I love this grian "I am a strictly pie guy" but at 24 mins he has eaten 2 porkchops
grian your the best builder i have ever seen
hhhhhmmmm poul poul poultr poult poultr try ma man
i loved how he started a building tutorial half way through the video! very cool grian! love your tips and tricks :)
this episode was on my 12 yr old birthday
Looks like a cat wearing a witch hat?
p poul
hey grian
hey
Sooooo your gonna live in a giant boot?

when will poultry man be back from season 6 hhhhhmmmmm
There was an old grian who lived in a shoe
Grian: You're going to be so proud of me, I made a storage system! Me: Just being impressed he finished the back of something
What Grian calls a house is a elf's shoe. Just look at it and you will see it
Grian, what is the title of your time lapse music?
Looks like a horse or a dog tho
Is this really Grian? doing an interior; labeling; *IT HAS A BACK* Are we sure we're not still watching Grienne?
I love how Grians new house looks like a baby llama wearing a wizards hat
Who is this man that is very organized?! Where is our messy Grian?! (This is just a joke don't be so serious)
Why are the other hermits doing villagers?
when will poultry man be back
Also, ive only seen 1 youtuber do the golem trick, it being Thinknoodles back in like 2014.
The reason people don't use iron golems more often is probably because iron usually isn't as easy to obtain as it is with the new terrain generation, so it didn't use to be worth summoning all those golems to kill the wither
people don't do this because resources...
When will poultry man be back 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
When will poultry man be back 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
grian at the start of the season: rock is house grian in episode 3: the rock spoke to me
to answer your question, Grian, the reason why no one uses iron golems on the wither is because of 2 main reasons: Too expensive and time consuming to get pumpkins and iron (you need 36 iron for 1 golem) it doesn't come to mind to some people that you can use iron golems
Grian I am so proud of you lol. I swear I don't think I've ever seen you organized. Ever.
make a mega base
Grian fishing scar reminds me of those kids on a leash
Try and get every possible trade possibility for the cheapest price
grian really didnt want to live under a rock

When will poultry man be back 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
hmm anyone else think Grians "starter" house almost looks like some kind of Dog with a wizards hat?
Grain: why does no one do this Wadzee: what about me
When you said we would be proud the 1st thing that came to my mind was a back of the house lol.
When will poultry man be back 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔

House looks like a boot
Grian impulse used the golems
Impulse used a ton of iron golems, and yet only 5 are needed...
It's an elven shoe
more proud it has a back, base looks cool
HE DID THE BACK!!!
I am proud because it has a back
I don't have words for that base. Its the best thing I have ever seen
So basically every time grian grinds for resources peaple dont want to farm and  every season makes a lot of diamonds.
You're magician of colour gradients so you live in a right place
The house looks like an elf’s shoe
"what you're about to witness is a professional minecrafter"  Yes, we know Lord Grian Dreamslayer
anyone else think grians base lookes like a unicorn toy?
Bro nearly 1 and a half mil views is under a day, highly impressive I must say 🤨🤨
so proud of u gman :)
At first i thought that it is a pepper 🌶️🌶️🌶️ house 🤣🤣🤣
nice mlg
Oh
Grian? Organizing? This cant be right, who is this IMPOSTER?!?
There’s actually an easier way to defeat the wither by doing it under the bedrock in the end. The wither would suffocate under the bedrock
I think it would be better if you used soul lanterns on the blue rounding roof bits instead of the normal lanterns
Now you have to do it with the ended dragon
its a Llama...
Grian probably likes pie because it's made using eggs.  I mean, I don't know any man in a chicken costume, what are you talking about?
Etho showed in a couple episodes of season 7 how he would set up withers under the end return portal with a bunch of iron golems around them. I think impulse also it did for lamps plus
no wonder grian made that video, people have never tried to fight a wither with iron golems. so hes spreading the word
Just going to skip over the bit where scar says "I wonder what they taste like" to the villagers Grian?
GRIAN!!! THATS SUCH A PRETTY HOUSE
Grian: “This build is intend to look like a magician or alchemist” Me: “...it’s a fancy shoe”
People did use iron golems before I've seen it a few times
That house looks like a shoe
I love the alchemy boot house. It looks like a boot. And that's great.
Selling copper while tango has a huge copper farm... rip
Bedrock is like this but the iron golems would be dead in the first 30secs
Who are you and what have you done with our beloved youtuber
The Entity: I don't want to be a house Grian: But- The Entity: NO Grian: fine
I’m so proud of you grian I have never been this proud of you I never thought you will have an organised storage system
"Fortunately you can subscribe if you want"   -pickaxe
Dude scar said not to tell u he is going to prank your base so be prepared
No one is gonna mention that impulseSV literally just did this the other day lol.. ok..
I think the entity should be a little more colorful to go with the observatory?
Beanut Putter.
anyone else think he didn't do the back or was that just me?
In my opinion I reckon you should make a town name for the town like you did with boatem
3:05 I feel like snowballs would've been useful in this situation.
I love how your houses have been looking season 8-9!! I can tell your building style when looking at them each, like they could be in the same neighborhood! I wish I could actually build sometimes :p
Commenting for the algorithm
10:52 new strat wither mining lol
11:18 how is it sustainable
When he said "You would be proud of me" I thought he would say "I finished the back!" 🤣🤣🤣
the reason people dont use iron gollems to kill the wither is because getting 4 iron block per golem is relly expensive and you can just dig a 1x2 hole and hit the wither through it untill it dies so there isnt really any need to use golems to kill the wither unless you are in the full endgame and need 10 beacons fast or something
Grian.... you live in a shoe.
When grian turns a starter house build into a building tips and tutorial
the house looks like a shoe
Fantastic episode Grian!
Is grian living in a shoe?
You know if YouTubers like grian are the only thing keeping me from just up and commiting die like it's the ONLY thing keeping me going when my mental health gets too unstable 🙂👉🔪🤕
Congrats you made a shoe house
Hey look they guy who said he wouldn’t build a starter base built a starter base.
I love these funky minecraft people. They're all chaotic and therefore funny. U got into hermitcraft after season 8 ended because everybody on my tumblr was all screaming about the moon. My little brother was like "o yea mumbo started a cult" and honestly. That just dragged me in.
Congrats on #1 in gaming grian :D
Wait until you get a hold of Mangrove Wood.
I tried this on bedrock i died  (full netherite btw)
“It spoke to me” -grian “nooooo not another dream smp egg copy”-me
Your new starter base kinda looks like a wizard duck, all its missing is a beak on the white bit
grian you always make my days so much better
GRIAN! YOU ORGANISED YOUR BASE Ö
Grian, the Thaumaturgist who studies the fabled entity.
oh noo the raid farm rip impulses totem shop for another season haha
Precious pies?! ♥️Thank you Grian!!!
Scar was yelling "This was a bad idea!" before you removed the water, so yes you are that predictable.
Nice shoe starter base grian!
U better start a war
looks like kiara's hair 😂
U could have made a cool small house on top of the boulder
GRIAN why aren't you smelting copper with a blast furnace
Does anyone think Grian will become and elf like Scar???
Woow... Your background music is very catchy.. ❤️love it..
there is a more efficient way to age copper (I think 2 times as good) and it takes less space.
I can't wait to see the end result of the village project and good luck!
Video recap: “the boulder spoke to me and it doesnt want to be a house” (13:00)
I think someone needs to sub to impluseSV and watch their harcore series............. lolz
Okay I get the studying the entity vibe but, it looks like an elf's shoe lol
You've gone from living under a rock, to living in a shoe, congratulations!
17:13
i thought he was going to say i finished the back
Can anyone link a video of that villager breeder Scar was using?
Impulse did it.
Why are you not in mcc
Boot
Was anyone else thinking he was going to say we should be proud of him for doing the back
Tip for grian:- You can use a shear on the top of vines and weeping vines and warped ones too to stop them from growing with out destorying there look
As the entity grows it should slowly absorb the things around it, like the starter base
your starter base looks like an elf's shoe...
i literlly choked on the icecream while was watching when he showed the organized storage. Wtf, is GRAIN ok, do you have a fever my friend.
I’ve seen impulse use golems in the end
My favorite way to sort is to use barrels inside the wall, with an item frame over it
Nooo grian, i want to see the CHEST MONSTER
An organized Grian giving us building tips again? This is beautiful
I was so sad when I found out he wasnt doing a starter base and now he's doing one!
grian, you should make a build and only do the back
Me thinking he was going to say that the back was done lol😂
Do not make raid farm impulse has already made it
What is that a snail in a wizards hat and thats its poop
You’re starter house looks like a dog grian.
Grian: it is all organized Basically everyone else: not for long.
Who are you and what have you done to Grain doing proper storage!
YES
oh, where you off to?
looks like a pony tho
Lol. Clearly wasn’t watching impulse’s hard core series.
I use approx 6 Iron Golems in a room of Obsidian
I thought he was gonna say that he finished the back
Is it just me or does it look like a seahorse
Sahara 2.0???
Wonder how long the chests will stay organized
The reason people don't really use iron golem is that they are too expensiveand just making a a area underneath the world is more than enough.
Grian how many hours of sleep do you get if your waiting for others people’s convenient time. No offence but you should spend some self time aswell
Impulse used golem's to kill withers in season 7. He cheesed it in the end but they would kill him in seconds.
This looks like a witch's cat wearing magical hat...
Anyone else notice the house looks bigger on the inside?
I'm more proud that the starter house has a back
I dont kill wither like that because IGs are expensive. Also you can have it try to chase you while its breaking blocks like at 9:22 which is also a really safe way to kill wither
He needs vein miner.
Last hermitcraft season before I become a legal adult. A bit sad, but I am really excited for the future of the series.
Not a lot of people use iron golems because theres a better and less expensive way which is just shooting it from in the strip mine then in melee stab, walk back, walk forwards and stab and keep doing that
Grian just became a Piescaterian
Wow
I thought the building roof was a shoe, like the grandma that lived in a shoe, but an amazing build nonetheless and love the gradients
I am not gonna lie grain’s base looks little a boot 🥾
Grian: "Alchemist or magician studying the Entity."  Me: "He's living in a shoe..."
Bring back unorganised Grian
That chest storage,put a tear to me
Funniest part is in the old Minecraft combat hand book it did say the best way to fight the wither is in a cave with iron golems.
Grians base looks like a dog wearing a santa hat
The storage room/laboratory/wizards tower looks like scar made
Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo will never be forgotten.
This was done by live insaan
The house looks like a cat
If you think a boulder is dumb he made a shop on a boat and became the richest hermit
anyone saw the started  build and said shoe
Who is this man.Thats not Grian
There once was a Grian, who lived in a shoe; had so many friends (to prank), he didn’t know what to do 🎼
You deserve a like and subscribe for organizing
You should add a raised eyebrow to the entity (y'know the rock eyebrow)
more proud theres a back of the base!!
I love builds that tell stories. Literally my goal in any MC build I do. (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ Really excited to see how this develops going forward.
I know all your take time and a lot of effort but i just want to see more and i can't wait for the next ep
An elf shoe! Scar will be happy.
Surely, Grian watches Impluse's hardcore series right? Cuz he also did the iron golem trick to defeat the wither.
There was an old lady that lived in a shoe, she had so many kids she didn't know what to do
Whenever I see the entity, I always think of that one part in spongebob whe said ward says: that is just a stupid Boulder!  And then spongebob says: it’s not just a Boulder... it’s a rock
"You guys are going to be so proud of me"  Me*hoping he did the back of the base* "I dont have random junk outside!" Me*sadness* "But that's not what you're going to be proud of" Me*THE BACK???* "IT'S ALL ORGANIZED" Me*F****************CK*
Who else was actually surprised that he labeled everything
No one kills withers with iron golems because they’re too expensive
inb4 someone forgets, brings bad omen to the trading hall from the raid farm above and wreaks havoc. Ideally make the trading hall spawnproof, or at least have a cow/bucket system at the exit of the raid farm to remind you :P
Clearly they don’t watch Impulse’s hardcore videos
This new base really looks like a giant shoe house from cartoons
After watching hermitcraft for several years, I'm starting to learn that no one on this server knows what a "starter base" is.
Anyone else think that Grian's started base looks like a shoe?
ther is a thing called elytra u like
Your my favorite Builder Grian
Did no one hear scarr ask how villagers taste like?
Grian: loves pie Math teachers: "he's the chosen one"
I don’t know if it’s the same for Java but on bedrock when an electrified creeper blows up it drops mob heads, and when I tested it. It had a 100% chance of dropping either skulls
OH MY GOD, WHY DON'T YOU USE A SHIELD, UUUUGGHHH.
pleaase make the top part of the tower a enchanting/brewing room with an amethyst or crystals everywhere. Enchanting table with fit in nicely and a brewing setup is great to have
I feel like April 1st came early...
15:15 give it time grian itll go back to how it used to be... the grass isn't always greener on the other side... lol keep up the good work... starter house looks so wicked I love it.
11:31  "a lot of hermits are doing villagers"
HE FINISHED THE BACK??!!
No one uses it because the wither is ez enough to beat
My guys Is the lady who lived in a shoe. An elf shoe.
Grian organizing along the finished back wall is a miracle.     Thanks for all the likes!
Start of the video:  MLG enthusiasts: I liked that
Ok, hear me out.       *Wither mining*
14:55 Youuuu had my hopes up that you actually did the back
joe in chat as scar got the achievements was the FUNNIEST omg
im so proud of u
I’m more impressed you did the back of your house
Bringing back the barge will be cool
We do this on bedrock edition, bcs its terrible to try to fight otherwise
Oke Grain what’s with and not bringing A SHIELD
Grian I have a suggestion what if you make another shoe house and then connect them and make a huge statue and that will be ur mega base!!!
Really, I’m proud Grian. You organized AND did the back. Good job!
If you're going to sell copper, you absolutely NEED to make it into an Ea-nasir reference somehow
Watch Impulse' Hardcore series! You will get to see that someone also uses iron golem for wither fights
liking and commenting because of the organization
Hey grian, ever heard the story of the ol’ women that lived in a shoe? 😉
Backs of builds? A real starter house? Organized storage?? Alert! Clearly this is still Grien, impersonating Grian! lol -- jokes aside, that build is aDORAble and the gradient really is very nice. The bit with Scar and the fishingpole had me rolling. XD LOVING the way this season is going!
It looks like a wizard chicken
20:49 calling it now that the pies have some kind of mind control effect... this is giving gollum vibes
It’s always great when Grian is jumping on your face
Grian: "i have an awesome idea for my starter base"  Also Grian: *makes a giant shoe*
There's only one thing on my mind that needs to be asked... WHY ON EARTH DID YOU NOT USE BLAST FURNACES FOR THE COPPER!?
The Grian in a Shoe. ShoeGrian should be your name for the season.
ITS ORGANIZED!?!? (pats Grian on back)
no one does the iron golem in the box because people do it under the portal thing at the end. its a waste of iron
i can already feel that house getting filled with shulker boxes once grian gets a hold of em :')
Major flash backs from hermit craft 6 ? When grian got wither skull
Backs on builds… organized chests… Who are you and what have you done with Grian?
Ive always used iron golems :3
WHAT DIDYOU DO TO OUR GRIAN YOU IMPOSTOR
I'm curious about what the new villager set up will look like. In my current Minecraft world I made a villager trading hall with 32 villagers in a square. Each villager has a bed, and an opening so they can talk to their neighbors and summon an iron golem. The iron golems spawn on a large square platform with water pushing them to a central kill chamber. Around all this there is a moat with water pushing to a separate kill chamber for other mobs. That one doubles as a raid farm. None of them are particularly efficient, but it is nice having an all in one set up that didn't need any redstone. I haven't used any mined diamonds to get fully equipped with tools and armor.
15:00 I really thought he would show the back. he is like "look look, no junk."
20:36 Does this mean rendog made a narcotic?
a
Hey grian you did a video about gradient so you can also do a video about what colour work with each other and what different combinations of colour you can use for building
You could make a deep slate diamond farm by using the wither blowing up its surroundings to clear out a mining cavern.
I'm more proud of the fact that Grian actually finished the back 😂
There was an old Grian that lived in a shoe!
Wait for bedrock withers ;-;
Grian is a π guy
he's gonna wax your copper grian
scars voice reminds me of taurtis
loved the base lets see how much your use of color envolves through the season
Grian: not showing the back. Me: * WW2 Flashbacks *
For some reason, Grian's new building music reminds me of FNaF security breach
I can smell a Pie v. Pork war on the horizon
Don't sell copper
Tango farmed nether stars in the end with golem in s7
"Why does nobody do this?" Bedrock players: Wish i could
Thx for the saying happy birthday for me scar
"i'm a pie guy" next clip: there was 32 pork and now 31.
GRIAN MUST SEE THIS : grian I want to see the return of poultry man and I have a plan they will be in the comments of the next hermincraft episode >:)
Grian's Starter Base - A cat with a witch's hat on it! ~ A wise man's words Actually it was Scar who said this about your starter base 😂
First of all the video was great and you always make me laugh but where did the enchanted golden apple come from it was there in a frame where you were with Scar finding the wither skulls in the chests. (Congrats on the Sorting)
Grian: your gonna be so proud I organized my storage! Me: I’m more proud that you finished the back of the house
Grian it’s ok I guess that you stepped on our YouTube watching face
grian your house is just an elf shoe
the new starter base is awesome. it reminds me of the old lady who lived in a shoe
Grian, you are such a brat! Lol
Indins do iron golam
Number 2 for trending gg
I remember Etho did a montage of him grinding a bunch of Nether Stars by spawning a bunch of Golems under the End Exit Portal.
I can't believe that grain is not only organized, but also did the BACK!?
15:10 who else thought that when he said were gonna be proud he meant that he did the back?
i love grian's reaction to him doing the mlg.
First time my jaw almost unhinged with laughter grian makes our days better
At 14:56 I definitely expected him to say "There's a back, too!"
Grins, I’m sorry but your starter base looks Ike a goat
no one does it cause it doesn't work normally. you were smart and did it underground, where the wither cant fly out of reach.
When grian said “Your not gonna believe this…” I thought he was gonna say that he did the back
Scar said happy birthday TODAY IS MY BIRTHDAY. THE DAY THIS WAS POSTED. THANK U SCAR LMAO
See Grian beat the wither with golems *laugh cries in bedrock*
Grian who did you let use your mincraft account?
he's ORGANIZED and making GROUND BREAKING DISCOVERIES, doing the BACKS, who is this man????!!!!!!! The iron golems whacked him a little to hard in  the head. He's being all scientific! Next thing we know he's going to start doing redstone.
When grien said sus though
Grian is so Pieus 😁
The base looks like a dog peeing orange stuff
Starter house kind of reminds me of fairytales. The old woman who lived in a shoe somewhat. Of course jack and the beanstalk.
I love the build, to me it seems very inspired by fWhip, I like it!
Good job u finish the back of your base
I thought he was gonna say we would be proud of him for finishing the back 🤣
The alchemist theme is expressed very clearly, right before you mentioned it I was legit thinking this looks like an alchemist hut
whenever he placed that last skull i actually got scared
11:22 *Sustainable*
0:37 that was clean
he's like a lil child that's super happy bout something. Proud of u Grian! Finally organized ur stuff. Let's see if it still turns into a chest monster later on!
Btw grian scar is gonna prank your witch hat
I thought he was gonna say he did the back when he said we'd be proud... and he did do the back
the starter house kinda looks like a cute dog LOL
Grian why do you never use shaders it would look super nice.
Logs Two, Electric Boogaloo
To be fair the reason why no one uses iron golems for the wither is because it's a waste of iron. You could do what you did before with the stripmine and just slowly move back as you hit the wither
You should use wither for deepslate mining it very fast
I wish I could build as good as grian
15:42 the invis trapdoor
"Look how organized I am!" Dude, you built the back, that's the thing that existed me lmao
Two seasons ago, he build a sentient robot, now he's building a sentient rock
8:20 because thats a lot of iron for a lot of people
Every hermit's starter base is better than any endgame base I've ever built
GRIAN!!! You can carry raw iron, gold, or copper as blocks!!!
Can't wait for the next episode 😁
Starter house looks like a shoe maybe a magic cobbler dude lives there
Ive only seen wadzee do that wither technique
hes the old woman who lived in a shoe
Maybe you should make like a hopper platform below and make a ore pillar on it so you wont be worrying about the copper beiing despawned
It looks like a shoe lol 👟👟 But one of those fantasy ones
Proud fan😎
Ayyyyyyyyyyy
You could say hes a PIE-ous man
I think grian had a stroke when making that mlg
i tried to put the entire bee move script here so grian could read the amazing wonders of bees but alas it was to long :(
Many use the end to spawn the wither and defeat it that way
This house needs a yellow beak to finish the duck 🦆
Is it just me or does the house look slightly like a small dog
The funky duck house
I tried to kill the wither with golems but I didn’t know how to do it right and I was on Sony end issue deepslate didn’t exist yet
9 j 1,1M woow
Scar fear was sooo real xD loved it
Bedrock wither: proceeds to kill 50 iron golems
i did the iron golem vs wither, 30 golems vs wither on modded as my star farm XD XD
Base roof only makes me think vanilla ice cream cone
Why does it look like a shoe? Or a boot? Or is that just me-
Grian sounds like a artist not a mincrafter
Make a shop like the barge, but name it TGS Companies (T-Tango G-Grian S-Scar)
Hjs happiness when he mlgd
Tip: you can use withers to mine netherite
I saw “Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo”
The Hedge-Grizard's Hovel?
15:00 i thought he gonna shows us he did back lol
I like the music
this is absolutely my favorite base i've ever seen done in minecraft :) i hope i can build something as cool as the alchemist tower someday!
He shoulda moved under the bridge, coulda been the troll under a bridge lmao
That build looks like a cross between a lama (without the snout) and a shiba, wearing a magic hat.
Im so proud of you grian.
Most people don't use iron golems because of what happened in the first couple minutes of your attempt.  Cheaper to just dig a tunnel and get in hits as the wither tries to break the blocks of the tunnel to get to you.
1st time grian organised stuff
How do the hermits not get bored of playing for a decade
It looks like a duck
"I want to experiment with colors this season" maybe you shouldn't build so many boulders.
The house is a shoe...
0:02 , we forgive you grian, for now...
Who remembers the under water boat build
Am I the only one that thinks Grians house looks like a witches boot.
This video just put me in a good mood, it made me happy. Thank you soooo much grain for everything you do and just being one of my favorite YouTubers!
IT'S ALL LABELED??? i'm crying tears of joy grian this really is a weird weird season after all
I’m sorry but anyone else think the starter base looks like a duck with a wizards hat lol 😂
So I want to see you kill the dragon with golems.
day 3 of asking for donk to get a donk skin
People don't use the iron golems because it's expensive and you can just take all the either under the bedrock in The End and its much easier
Nevermind
Grian bud. Ya house looks like a shoe
well there is a youtuber that did this already they're name is skyes
Using Iron Golems to kill the Wither? That. is. GENIUS!
Put slabs under the floating chests.
I was actually just really proud you did the back Grian! You exceeded my exceptionally low expectations. :D
you can give your stuff to ienchant to enchant
Did ya know there is a sussy structure At 16:28
You should really use a blast furnace for your smelting. It'll save you a ton of time with that much ore. Also make sure you use the stonecutter to make your blocks. Whatever you do, don't use the crafting table!
Sussy
Its funny that grian gave scar ptsd with just a fishing rod
People don't really use the iron golem because: A: It's pretty expensive B: Its too cheesy for some and others would do the bedrock in end trick or stalactite trick C. For people who want to do it legitly, just making a tunnel underground and killing it is super easy, barely an inconvenience D. You don't get the advancement, not the most important and there are ways to get it, but still annoying  In general the java wither is basically a stationary punching bag, cheesing it is easy and doing it legitly is easy.
SpongeBob said he's proud of you
The wither is easier to beat in the end under the bedrock.
Anyone else remember the build swap series he did with Taurtis? I wonder if they still talk
some people don't have the iron
Only legends know triggered insaan did it too
I just loved joes, “Congrats!” “Congrats?” “…” on the trip to the wither fight
Building with grian one on one  15:30
ay
lol
you need to try mining using a wither it would be so cool
grain
Not only is there a labled storage system. But the build has a back!

It looks like a shoe. Lol
grian are you okay? the back is finished, you're organized, storytelling/lore-ish type stuff with your builds????
Grian should do a nether star farm to sell beacons
22:32 “We’ve been trying to reach you regarding your car’s extended warranty.”
Grian needs to sell pies in the entity
Scars right it does look like a cat with a witch hat 😹💖
It’s a puppy in a wizard hat 😍
Creeper sustainable?
I really appreciated the building tips midway through the video! I feel like it’s become more rare to hear about your thought process in designing the little details of your builds that really bring them to life. I hope to see more of that this season!
The scar and grian interactions are the most wholesome 😭✨
You should name like 10 dogs "Pooter" and sit them all around Scar's base.
You should put iron bars in the copper wall. Really sell that prison vibe
Religion dictates that Grian shall only have pies. What a pie-ous man
Oooo new episode! Been enjoying this season so far!
it looks like a jester shoe XD
RE: Golems, not everyone can afford to make a bunch of golems. If you don't have an iron farm or otherwise source of excessive amounts of iron they're very expensive to build and maintain. That said, the new update has made iron way easier to get without a farm and perhaps we'll see them used more. :o
I dont get the house... feels like a small design for a megabase
3:11 USE A SHIELD YOU GET VIRTUALLY NO BENEFIT FROM HAVING FOOD IN YOUR OFFHAND!!!
Actually wadzee did this and an Indian youtuber live insaan did this
bro i leave for what it feels like 2 weeks but apparently ive been gone since the middle of s7 lol
Grian, is x-ray allowed on Hermitcraft?
Hiiii
that organized storage made me feel like a mother that so proud for her 5 y.o. child
Imp did this about 2 months ago on live streem but he used more golums but the gulmoms wer good for multi uses
Me: More proud grian did the back
Really thought you were gonna show us the back
Thx for posting
Cut copper gives you 4x as much
To day is my birthday so thanks scar!?!
You could add L frames under the shelf in your house using upside-down staircases
I’m proud that you built The back
Your base looks like a dog.
I will avenge my big brother withers
I love how grian did the iron golem killing the wither and made this whole rent about not knowing if it was gonna work or not even tho we know he saw a recent video of someone doing it i saw it couple days ago and i think he saw the same
If you watch pearl's videos, she wither mines all the time.
How similar do you want this to look to your S8 starter base? Grian: yes
Grian, you built a shoe. Your base is a shoe.
Manz was about to become Patrick
hey grian you shoud make a blast  furnace for smelting your copper
lol, wither spawning in the nether to mine for netherite
Shoe house, not alchemist house... you made a shoe house
Grian lives in a boot.
Just a suggestion what if you lived near scar and made the goblin cave that is described in the hobbit where Biblo found the ring
it shoe
Grian has become the old women who lives in a shoe
You are my favorite YouTuber
its a dog
17:01 I feel like I'm watching the Bob Ross of building.
Season 8: Hermits kill Wither with pointed dripstone Season 9: Hermits kill Wither with Iron Golems Season 10 prediction: Hermits kill Wither with end crystals
You could probably use mushroom stem to better the gradient between the gray and white
idea for hc9 lore: Grian, you are one of few sole survivors of the hc8 disaster. When the moon collided with hc8 you escaped through a rocket with your fellow Hermits. When you landed you found yourself along a rocky coast with one rock in particular sticking out. you walked over to examine it. Later That day you set up base next to the specimen wich you decided to call The Entity. When you woke up it had grown to a size bigger than you could ever imagine. You noticed it was a living thing that was very sensitive to nature. After building a lab for more thorough research you became more familiar with the things that created this rock. You later deemed yourself an alchemist and continued researching. After finding out it was a piece of the moon you had more incentive to continue the investigation.
I think its really funny that the fact grain expected to live in a rock but turned it into a shop for I really don’t know reason
Wait until he shows us the back…
Is it just me or does the house look like a elf's shoe
It looks like a dog
Grian when you’re doing the fortune towers maybe put a small 5x5 grid of hoppers into a small silo so items that fall get sent into an inventory before they can despawn
So proud of u Brian I can never play if I'm not organize😂😎
Ngl I first thought he was making a shoemaker's house, like the one in the folktale with the elves since elves are kinda a big theme this season.
Can't believe Grian made a build about someone studying an entity right as i'm getting back into SCPs
Don’t forget the stone cutter now gives 4 cut copper 8 slabs and for stairs per single copper block. Do not use the crafting bench to make them
I am a PIEus man
what if you made a color lab
3:16 “Master Skywalker what are we going to do?”
When Grian said you are going to be proud of me for sorting my chests I was thinking I am more proud of you for actually doing the back of your base.
It looks like a shoe
Bedrock wither: laughs in double health
I was more surprised grian finished the back of the house ahaha
Yay he finished the back
EYYYY
In case you don't know, you can make a wither cage in the end. So, the easiest way to kill wither is to cage it in the end and  use a smite v sword. it should 15-30 s or even less to kill a wither.(no armor needed)
Can you please please please make a build tutorial for your starter house!! Btw keep up the amazing content bro!
i want to see how long can Grian be organized for :v
For different coppers, use two different colored shulkers. one for waxed and the other for unwaxed?
20:56 I’M A PIE GUY. Somehow goes from 32 Cooked Pork to 31 in the transition.  Edit: 22:08 Now he’s at 30(lol he’s only eating it off camera)  Edit: 24:15 Goes from 30 to 28…😐
Whenever he says entity I just think of The Magnus Archives, I would say the boulder would either be part of the buried or the spiral
The house looks like a shoe
The Witer Tactic will never work on Bedrock edition LOL
Scar and Grian shenanigans are always fun.
i would have just made it with unwaxed, let it age, then a week later fix it with an axe and honeycoombs
Oh and you could summon a bunch of withers all at once by retracting pistons... Hum.....
So how long until the new tag
WadZee has used iron golems to fight the wither!
pooter
#1 on trending congratulations
Joe: Good for you... Maybe? Lol
Does anyone ever use the wither as a strip mining tool?? It seemed fairly effective to reveal a wide area around your strip mine
The speed build music sounds like something for security breach xD
It looks like Grian is the little old lady who lived in a shoe! Has so many chests he doesn’t know what to do!
So many people cheese the wither but I just use a max level smite sword, potion of strength II, and potion of regeneration II
Id call your outdoor base  *Grian's Mess™*
Grian if you want a 100% wither skull drop rate use charged creeper people like it so he can see this
if someone sees this my hand is broken
The starter base looks like a dog with a hat
You should totally buy into doc's inventory management system to restock your shops
He is Gandalf the green
I'm naming the entity Eddy and you can't stop me
Grian is so proud of hi self and im gonna say is "IM PROUD OF YOU BEING MY SON" 🤣🤣😂🤣😂😆
ONE MIL VIEWS NICE
grian at 14:55 your gonna be so proud of me  me: you did the back?
Grian is now officially the little old lady that lived in a shoe
Grian and Scar’s friendship makes my heart so happy.
This season are you going to make did you die boxes
WHY ARENT YOU PROUD THAT YOU DID THE BACK!?!?!?!?!
Scars 1st episode “We’re building a big tree” Grians 1st episode “Rockssss”
AH yes grian welcoming with the 'step on me'
Do you stone cutters you can get four cut copper blocks for one normal copper block
Will there be another third life?
How long do you guys think Grian will be organized for lol 😂?
15:00 you aren't Grian, give us Grian back
thanks scar for the birthday wishes! but im wondering, how did you know?
With Grian's new diet, could we say he's a pie-oneer?
I think that we should all be proud that he added a back AND a good storage system
Finally!!!! He is organized
Oh the roof is like the hair of a staravia
Personal for the wither i just use a strength 2 potion and a smith 4 sword super easy and fast
Is there any chance the entity was inspired by dead by daylight's the entity
well no one does the with golem thing cuz killing the wither is pretty easy anyway
That starter base...I cant help but see a duck with a wizards hat on XD
You’re a PIEoneer
*Why does this house look so much like a boot*
I thought he said that he wont build any starter house other than the entity?
BURN THE WITCH
Grian people do the iron golem trick all the time. People have even done it on hermitcraft (I am 90% sure)
I'm proud of Grian for putting a back on the base
Looks like Bdubs style
I’m so excited hermit craft is back! I’ve been so bored on YouTube without it!!
15:19 O0o has Grian been replaced by a clone.? That... organizes.! Oh no.
15:17 im proud it has a back
Grian, you know that you basically just invited Mumbo to wax YOUR copper now?
i like how grian trolled scar with the wither LOL  😆
Living under a rock, you should just make a basement under the Entity.
would a beacon going through the conduit look good?
Why when I look at your house I see a Llama with a dog tail and wizard hat?
It looks like a oxidized cowboy boot from the angle at 16:38
Wizards study rocks? I didn't know that.
I already use the golem strat
Ducky
OH MY GOD I'M SO PROUD OF YOU GRIAN!!! YOU DID A BACK AND HAVE AN ORGANIZED CHEST SYSTEM ALL GRIAN FANS WOULD BE SO PROUD OF YOU (only new people to channel don't get it)
Okay but…who is gonna tell him that he’s now the little old lady who lives in a shoe?
does anyone else think that Grian's new house is a giant stylish elf boot?
Wait… there’s backs and he’s organized??? I don’t think this is Grian… I think it might be Grien
I'm just wondering 2hy he wasn't using a blast furnace the whole time
The most British intro Lol
Not me but I’m stuck with a good grandad
does anyone else see a cat wearing a wizard hat when the look atr Grians starter base?
Okay, what about the back of the starter/store house?
I just have suggestion when you are going to build something. Why not make it elvish themed or wizardy  because your starter base looks like it’s themed that way
im proud of you grian finally a storage system
I like how about 15 minutes in it turns into a slight building tutorial
As scar says a cat in a witch hat
please graph your profits this season (from the entity), it would be really interesting.
Grian, i am very proud of you not only you sorted out your items you also did the BACK
"You'll be impressed guys - it's all labeled."  Me: "OH MY GOODNESS IT HAS A BACK!!!!"  (seriously though it looks lovely)
Beanut Putter
"I'm a pie guy." I'd really like to believe that he filmed that particular bit on 3/14.
you should turn the warped vine in the house into a tree and have the plant be in a "watered pot" aka cauldron because if you have in in a filled cauldron it can look like some aquatic tree (since its blue)
I totally thought that grian was going to show us he did the back
14:12 Surely I'm not the only one that sees that Grian's starter house is a duck wearing a witch hat? The yellow blocks in the background at this timestamp even make a perfect duckbill!
I’m more proud, not of the storage, but the back on the starter base lol. Im kidding
Grian: You're gonna be proud of me!  Did he make a back?  Grian: There's no more junk!  Oh.
@Grian u shd have seen " I summoned 100 iron golem for a wither " a video of wadzee , and also many people do it but for the thrill they dont do it
When I saw your base I thought it was a boot.
Grian has a logo in the bottom right corner, that looks like a GameCube. Absolutely genius
The moment Grian mentioned makinf iron golems Me realizing what's gonna happen next bcuz I watch the youtube shorts
You should be an architect lol
If you look at it long enough it starts to look like a cat with a long neck
I think you should know Impulse already has a raid farm for emeralds and Totems just so you know
Literally about cried when grian sorted the chest
I was wondering if Grian would get someone with that same trick 4 seasons in a row. Guess not yet.
Grian, I hate to break it to you, but Impulse already has a raid farm and librarian trading hall.  He is currently selling all books for 2 diamonds each
Grian can you please stripmine with a wither. It would just be funny.
you guys should make a mayor again like in hermitcraft 7
was anyone else waiting for him to mention that he built the back?
I love that they just completely ignored the rest of the hermits panicking over the health bar because Grian and Scar are totally the duo that would spawn a loose Wither
not to rain on grian's parade but you can easily stick the wither under the dragon's nest with much less preparation, but it's much less entertaining.
Grain never sees people use iron golems to kill withers, but I recall multiple Hermitcraft seasons where underneath the bedrock end portal there were iron golems to auto-kill the stuck withers.   SciCraft uses minecarts to kill them even faster.
Man I hope mumbo waxes all that copper.
people don’t do the iron golem thing cause u have to spend iron n it’s pretty easy to kill him in my opinion
has anyone else noticed that each season grian tries to experiment with more building stuff each season Season 6 : Style Season 7 : Diagonal walls Season 8 : Texture Season 9 : Color
Grian: "its lacking some detail out the front which I definitely plan on doing" Me: do you mean to have the place lack of detail or do you mean fixing the lack of detail, because for you I- oh wait your thing is the back of builds nevermind
Rock is the rock :troll:
I see that Grian is celebrating Pi day
Grian you're really pranking people with withers again? Did you learn nothing from last time?
grian spending so much iron to kill a wither is actually driving me crazy... everyone should know killing wither under end portal on under bedrock roof is the best way
0:03 apology accepted
You have to show mumbo your storage system
This reminds me of the swagon
Sooo... you're basically doing what Impulse has already done and is currently selling? Hmm 🤔😐
Labeling?  Grien, is that you?
Your starter house looks a little familiar
This strat will probbably not work on bedrock
Grian I am proud of you... for making the back
“It spoke to me..”  Elmo didn’t hear anything!
Ideas stolen from impulse
"I was pretty sure this torch would stop it from spawning" sir thats what you said about the sign in last season D;
Always kept suggesting the idea of Grian building an amusement park, having no back is part of its charm lol.
I've done this for years. Didn't know it was a novel technique.
Grian we are always proud of you... and doesn't your house kind of look like a shoe?
Grian admits of doing villagers ._.
I am a mug blooded American ya hear
Is it me or did anyone else see a minecraft male private part thingy in grians house near the roof of the warped vines at 16:16 look down
As a bedrock player the iron golem strat doesn't work
Grian! Don't smelt the copper you fool! Tango already made an insane copper farm, but raw copper is something he will never have. That us your niche
He actually finished the back😳😳
Grian: *says stuff about building* Me: i like your funny words magic man
Neat prank, until half of those blocks are randomly waxed.
You guys are going to be proud of what I did: Us: did u do the back?
when he said u guys are gonna be so proud of me i thought it was because he actually finished the back
My piecious
Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo
I wonder how long the organised storage will last
pls dont make a storyline.. im sorry please dont..
Grian why do you give Scar so many heart attacks >:O
There was an old Grian who lived in a shoe.
just sayin i got 10 skulls in 60 wither skeletons. wat the hell?
i  thought it was a boot
I think a cool base would be building a ruined villa (French or Roman kind) and then building an underground castle under it just like how it is in real life.
when you don't give credit to Lizzie with that golem srat that she did infront of you (most people don't use the golem srat cause instead of wasting blocks of iron they just easily kill the wither under ground
15:00 I really thought he was gonna make a comment about the back
Love the content, however your "starter base" looks like a elf shoe.
I guess you can say that grian is living under a rock :P
shoe house?
I find it HILARIOUS that Grian hasn't seen anyone kill a wither with iron golems! Next he's going to say that he's never seen anyone kill the dragon with beds. ^_^
When grian's got a way to kill the wither effectively but doesn't know he needs a shield for fighting blazes lol
If you have leashes and llamas with chests you can have a caravan of Chinese knock-off bootleg shulker boxes
14:58 i thought he would say he actualy built the back of a build
Grian's house is a good boy.   The roof looks like a tail. The house looks like a french poodle... With a wizard hat. A wizard poodle
you like pie ey?
anyone who plays regularly and servers every day can tell you that water bucket mlg is easy, i can do it like 10 times in a row at height   50-100
Grian, I like your season 8 time lapse music better than the season 9 music
Uh oh more diarite scars not gonna like this
no one does that because its a waste of iron, just spawn ther wither in the tunnels the way u did it and hit it then back off when it gets closer to u walk back then hit it again it dosent even take much longer and u save stacks of iron
Good job Grian, you did it buddy!
The floor of my starter room is similar. You’ve gotta mix some full BEAN blocks in there. The warped stem makes a great sound when you walk on it.  Nice build
Technically the wither did not spawn because he placed the last head backwords....  Be more careful buddy
You know I'd be respectful you not to suss out scar just let him do what he's doing
What happened I thought they had a world border?
When he said “YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE SO PROUD OF ME :D” I thought he was gonna say how he did the back
It look like a boot
Finally I see someone use golems to fight the wither, I thought I was the only one.
You can use vanilla tweaks texture pack to point out waxxed and unwaxxed copper
Grian:i made it look like its some sort of like alchemists..... Me:its a shoe with a roof.
Grian: does an INSANE pro Minecraft play Also Grian: Fights Blazes without a shield
Wad Zee used golems to kill the wither
20:06 "it looks like a prison" ppl who live in finland: your house looks like a prison! this os just a wall
17:01 is bab time with scar like scar’s alt or something?
Etho usually use cheaty way in bottom of the bedrock with iron golem to hit wither if memory serve me right.
yooo i saw that roof design a few weeks ago grian's take on it is so coooll
There once was a Grian that lived in a boot
Get a second floor / second boulder grian like a massive skycraper but boulder edition  Made by: the Stoneage gang
Grian: “why does no one do this?” *sad impulse noises*
I enjoyed the building tips.
your base looks like w shoe lol
Why did everyone ignore what Scar said at 23:45
Grian first of all great build but something you could do to spice it up is make a little telescope that points from the top tower towards the entity
That's it. I've discovered your secret. You're not Grian... you're Loki aren't you. 🤔
Next time you are grinding skulls or anything else, turn the chunks down. It increases spawn rates in the area
The biggest achievement of this series is grian's storage system. I don't care what happens later on, this is the biggest achievement ever
Grian sees the house of an Alchemist, I just see an enormous Elf shoe, right next to the Elf Tree House
I thought grian was living on the Boulder
Umm... Tango has built a Drowned copper farm.
To save some time building with copper, wax blocks before you making other stuff out of them, that way slabs and stairs will be already waxed. Just get them to right stage before waxing
Grian: *worrying about the villagers dying* Scar: "What do they taste like?"
if nothing else i can always rust this series to have fantastic music
Video 3 of commenting Donk bring the stonk
I gasped when I saw an organized storage system
Your house looks like a shoe I can appreciate that in a house
The starter house looks a bit like a pointy shoe.
Why did Grain name is dog after a golf club?
The new starter base looked like a combination of pearlescent moons season 9 starter base with goodtimeswithsars last life base
it's a shoe wearing a hat.
I think the entity is just Sahara, the barge and the g train reincarnated
Grian missed out on the golden opportunity to live under the rock
Grian, someone had iron golems setup under the end portal for most of last season for this exact reason 🤣
am i the only one who thinks grian and pearl's bases are kinda similar?
i need a season where grians mega base is just a 1x2 dirt hut that has a ladder that leads down to a ginormous base
I got grian and impulse's hardcore series confused and was like "you already beat the wither with iron golems"
Guys, it's happened, it's finally happened, HE LABLED THE CHESTS!
Elf in a tree.... cookie empire.... You're a Keebler Elf!
I feel like grian is has fallen into the magic rut the past two seasons
"There's nothing wrong with my fishing pole" - Grian, 2022
The build looks great, I’m really excited about this style and branching out! I’ve been watching your channel for a while and it’s great to see how you’ve improved and how you continue to try new things.
"Living under a rock isn't always a good thing"  Patrick: Am I a joke to you?
The way the wither breaks blocks can be used to mine big tunnels
someone needs to tell grian to use arrow of weakness instead of the potions
it's impossible to cry during these EPs unless theres something sad, like, been crying cause insecurities for a while now, this popped up, I'm not longer crying. It's amazing.
WTF! 1mill views in 8hrs, that's a milestone for sure
It’s labeled, Grian? IT’S LABELED? DISGRACE.
What happened to the real grian? The real one would never make a storage system!
What about the dripstone
Good job with your storage system👍
The reason nobody does this is that not everyone has God tier iron farms, those who do usually have better ways of killing the wither
So cool!
Sitting here thinking, "A bow in your off-hand and a looting 3 sword in your main would solve this blaze conudrum," remembering that its not a common thing to know.
Dsmp stans: dsmp revived Minecraft Hermitcraft fans: no hermitcraft is the one it is one legend
15:43 grian just got a darkoak trapdoor out of nowhere
U have to use blast furnace on copper
Hey look. It has a back!
16:30 me: a shoe "some sort of alchemist's/magician's place" oh
We are proud of you ❤
Wow
the house looks like a shoe :D
The house looks like one of those dogs.
should have made a house segment on the entity
16:34 It just looks like a shoe
Oh my gosh Grian has gone to the dark side. He’s organized now.
Um... your starter base, it's a boot. like one of those floppy jester boots with the bell on toe. You said story and all I could think was the old woman you lived in a shoe.
The 3 stages of minecraft bases  1. Come up with a plan 2. Execute the plan 3. Abandon the plan and come up with a new one
14:58 I thought u were gonna say that you've actually Finished the Back of ur starter Base and I didn't realize U organized ur Stuff Oh I'm Proud HAHA The Builder that doesn't rlly Build the back of its House actually Build the back of its House in just one Episode! :D Oh Grian u don't know how Proud I am even tho ur older than me HAHA
I believe no one use it because people don't need golems. Basically we can kill the wither without taking damage by tunneling properly. it takes too many iron and time to gather the resource to get so much iron golem
i’m proud he organized, but im even more proud that the back in finished!!
i love the starter house design! great work grien!
I am laughing so hard right now I just saw the "Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo" chest
Grian should make a large telescope for the "alcamist(idk if i spelled that right)" to look at the Entity with
I will never stop being surprised at how Java players are just fine with fighting the wither without iron golems or only ever getting emeralds from fletchers while only ever getting totems from woodland mansions or manually spawned raids.
Organizing chests!?  Sir, who are you and what did you do with our dear Grian!?  Wait, wait.....unless this is that dastardly moustached Grien....
Scar: oOoO look at those FANCY heads!
everyone in episode 1 : let's build a starter house  grian : let's build a starter house in episode 3
Of course Scar is practicing for MCC lol
I've made a villager breeder in my world, but it's stopped producing villagers. Does anyone know how to fix it? I've tried moving the beds, dropping stacks more food for them, making the drop for the babies longer, and they just won't breed. It's a standard four bed, four trapdoor setup I found in a tutorial.
Lovely episode!! I'm very interested to see what your study of the entity reveals 👀 And excited for this villager thing, it seems really cool! I also love the colors of the starter base, and I think it complements Pearl's build very well too.
interior design tips help so much. i love hearing about your process as you work
Grian your base looks like a shoe
Hi Grain I have something funny to tell you it’s Peanut butter and Jellie time 😂😂😂.
21:29-Are Scar and Grian also watching Dream's manhunts?
your bace looks like a llama dog with a hat
shew house
Labeled who are u and what did u do to Grian  Ps I like the new u
Tango and False both have copper farms, so you'll be competing with them, but the market might be big enough for all three of you.
USE A SHIELD WHEN U FIGHT BLAZE AKSJDJAKL
clearly grian stole from that grien short smh 🙄🙄🙄
Instead of making a mega base you could instead create a bunch of smaller buildings and create a village. Making each house have a different purpose.
If you still want to live in the boulder, you can live under it. For the story you could say you want a better way to research it.
that's a lot of free copper he gave mumbo
Just a thought but I think the gradient is a little too extreme on the starter house from top to bottom. Not sure if that’s what you were going for but it’s a lot of color
I've been trying to make something like that for a while on the side of a mountain and now I don't have to cause he made it better!
so this is what that tiktok was about.
I’ve been with grian since the first episode of hermitcraft he did!
Hey u can use cut copper for saving resources
Haha grian
I’m proud of you grain
14:56 i thought u gonna show that ur house have a back 🤣
Grian, I mean.. I know it's probably too late now for me to say, but... you created an EVER-EVOLVING rock!! ...  ...  Just make the rock GROW your house out of it!
your base is an amazeing masterpeice
14:59 ithought you were gonna show tht you finished the back XD srry but thts wut i thought XXDDD
Ok, but who gets which horse?
I can’t. I just can’t. The excitement and happiness when he lands the bucket clutch.
"I'm going to sell copper" *Me: just thinking about Tango's OP Copper Farm🤭
Surely its not just me. But doesn’t Grains house look like a poodle with a wizards hat?
grian in s8: im gonna prank mumbo with withers, this cant go wrong! *spawns a wither in the middle of boatem* grian in s9: im gonna prank scar with withers, this cant go wrong! joe in the chat: uhhhhhhhhhhh  love the iron golem trick! i have a much, much better chance to get myself a beacon on my hardcore world now
THE SHOE HOUSE
Wadzee did the wither thing with golems
21:14 grain has a great falsetto
New mining technique using the wither to blast through deep slate and exposing a crap load more ores
14:43... looks like a elf shoe/boot? anyone else think that
you got INFINITY emeralds, no need to zombifie and cure the villagers, just pay them the full price, just need to set up a breeder and job stations.
you built an elf boot
co lab with sb737 please hes amazing
But Tango made a copper farms so its a competition
I want you to steal doors again
I though you were building a giant wizard shoe
7hL "You're a wizard, Grian!" (From Hermitcraft SS6, the pickle shop)  Who are you and what have you done with Grian?
"thats a nice BOULDER"
I'm pretty sure the reason people don't do the wither with Iron golems thing is because usually Cheesing the wither under the bedrock portal in the end is simpler and less expensive since you aren't using up the blocks you'd use for a beacon base to make the iron golems (obviously iron farms are handy but not everyone likes them). On servers I've played on where cheesing it is frowned upon the wither is more of a community event where you get a bunch of friends and try to like beat it with a fish or something novel like that.
Do you like SB737?
You should fill the walls of the rock with amethyst to look like a geode, just to cover up the outside texture of the boulder from being visible inside, making it a bit more immersive
15:43 - 15:45 How did Grian get 7 trap doors out of nowhere? The 6th slot of the hot bar was empty but somehow he got 7 trap doors after clicking the placed trap door. Is it just me?
NEXT TIME ON KILLING STUFF WITH OP GOLEMS, grian will kill the ender dragon with iron golems.
Pie guy? What about poultry man?!! It makes sense eggs are used to make pies poultry man’s back everyone!!
imagine if it summoned a wither with a backwards head
Do you wanna know what I'm proud of?  You did back!!, well done grian 👍👍
i swear the entity will be what ends hermitcraft 9
He said no starter base?!?!?!
Every time I see Scar without armor I get a lord of the rings vibe. I so badly want to call him Scauron now.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: FULL GRIAN ALCHEMIST
Wow, I didn't know there were that many ways to use trapdoors in your house
To be honest grian your starter house looks like a shoe
Grian: Goes on a rant about how he *strictly* only eats pies* *cuts to him with 31 porkchops*
I don't do the Iron golem Wither strat, cuz am broke in iron all the time
So... You made a hatshoe... *Gusendheit*
So Grian is living in a wizard shoe?
so not only did you do the back of your build, YOU ORGANIZED?! WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DID YOU DO TO GRIAN?!
the house really reminds me of the crucible knight's second phase lmao
I think its the first time i see hermitcraft filled with all these pretty houses and meanwhile Grian made a rock...
It look like a giant shoe, I can't get the image out of my head now
I swear 15:02 I thought he would say "no back"!
we're proud of you
you dont even need the iron golems. just make a 3x3x3 box at the end of a long 1 wide, 2 tall tunnel in the deepslate and have either a sharpness or smite 5 sword, a sheild, some food and maybe a bow and arrows.
19:49 NICE LOOKING HOUSE so satisfying... ... it's 19:50 not satisfying anymore bc of the crafting table 😪
wow we are proud of you he is so organized he grows up so fast
People don't use golems for the Wither because it's expensive.
Dude if he was on bedrock edition he would have died from that wither instantly
Your house looks like a Yorkshire Terrier.   Cant unsee it.
Imma be real, the reason most people don't use iron golems is because its easier just to use the tunnel and hit it while constantly retreating
Proof that Grian doesn't watch Impulse :P
clearly grian has not watched impy's hardcore series
I suggest that you put item frames with blocks in them to remember what's in the chest without having to read a sign, plus it looks better
why dont you make like a goblin like thing thats standing on the boulder???
Grian is the hermit that lives in a shoe
He can never be organized he used someone else to do it for him
Can I just point out that I’m 13:00 minutes he was placing copper to age and he put them on a different ground level than the others , man that hurt 😂
I think that people dont use iron golems because by the time you have access to the large amount of golems you can beat the wither easily
💜
19:25   Bundles: that is where I Come in
And I think you should make a ware house
If they have killed the dragon, they could have spawned the wither under the portal in the end to instantly kill it.
Grian Speaking with the Entity? atleast i know how this season will end now
Why  not just build it all with fully aged copper and then axe n wax it as you go?
I know your probably already planning you mega build but a really cool mega build would be a giant hole in the ground like hundreds of blocks in sort of a circle shape with waterfalls going off the side and a giant lake at the bottom with and island in the middle and a base on the island and caves scattered across the sides of the walls for farms this is a build I'm working on in my own survival world and it's planned to go to from 100y to -15y
Grian: your going to be so proud of me Me: you finished the back of something? Grian: I cleared out the space Me: oh Grian: look what I’ve also done Me: you finished the back!! Grian: I organized  I’m doing great
Who is this   The real Grian  Wouldn’t finish the back Not sort stuff Started a war already
There was an Grian Who Lived in a Shoe
I love so much
bruh am I wrong or can you put water in cauldrons in 1.18 because that can be used in the fortress can't it?
💜😐
😐💜
Thanks for uploading, I was stressing about some stuff and your videos really help.
that starter base looks like a dog
grian just made a shoe house. thats it, thats what he did. he is the little old lady who lives in a shoe
can golems kill the ender dragon??
i think the reason why people dont do that is because you wont get the achivement
Trust me, grian will make another junk chest stuff. Accidently.
1. its expensive 2. one misclick might kill you
Were proud cuz th back is finished now
Your living in a shoe… ;)
Scar AND Grian are both organized 😵😵😵 never thought I’d see the day
“We’ve scoped out a village” The first victims of Grian’s tyranny
HE’S ORGANIZED!!!
grian: im a pie guy 5 seconds later: 1 cooked porkchop gone
Loved the time-lapse
The starter bace looks like a shoe
GRIAN THE APOTHECARY!
All I gotta say is Impulse...
Grian, not going to lie. Your house looks like an elf boot
Grian: why doesnt anyone do this Wadzee: am I a joke to you
You should flood the inside of the Entity so getting around is easier, then you can make it so the different shops inside can be swimmable. That’d be awesome!
Hey grian were do you git your important from
The reason people don’t use iron golems very often because of how expensive it is
My boy is all grown up (Partly, gotta finish some backs.)
for those of you who are wondering what the name of the time-lapse music is, its Walkman by Lupus Nocte.
i trap the wither in the nether roof and then gather a bunch of chickens next to it and hit them with poison so i get tons of wither roses and then i kill it in 5 hits because it can't move :)
im more proud that you finished the back <3
What have you turned into? You're not the Grian that I know, you're organized you finished backs and you ain't gettin' late on uploading!!
So now the wither on java is even easier then I thought
Your starter house looks like a chicken
5:32 you can tell that he filmed this part before he made the short on how to kill the wither and this video is the inspiration to that short
15:09 what I expect is unfinished back of the house lol.
Amazing keep up the good work
I can’t get over the fact that these dudes build a “starter house” to live in for three days, then build an entire mega build to live in on the last episode, only to restart entirely.
Dude I have wanted to do a world like this with my friends but if I can’t with them at least I can watch u guys
PLEASE StOp SAyInG SUS LOL
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THE REAL GRIAN, THE REAL GRIAN DOES'NT DO THE BACK, THE REAL GRIAN IS ALSO NOT ORGANIZED!!
13:15, profound
i really wish the hermits would build more with regular copper blocks and let them age on the build
I am the only one that thinks the house looks like a shoe...?
Grian lives in an elf shoe. Sock-man
Not gonna lie I thought he was gonna say that he finished the back instead of him moving all the chests. But hey thats the first time I saw grian being organized.
Who is this imposter
14:56 i thought he was gonna say "about the back"
Why doesn't people use iron golems for the wither wadzee be like
HE ORGANIZED!!!! So proud of you Grian 🥲
Just going to ask..: why didn’t you just move in under the rock?
Because the wither has 600 health
Grian, I like the base, but you made a dog 14:26. Seriously, do you intend to make your builds (except the entity) living?
Did anyone else think he was building a train engine at first
you should put like a study room in the tower with pictures of the entity
It's harder on bedrock
When he said “do you know what you guys are gonna be proud of” and started running I thought he was gonna show the back of the building 😂  I’m so sorry but it was too funny not to share
16:10 that wood is a little sus lol
You can lay down the pies in a circle and calculate pi. You'll get Numberphile audience.
"Sus" "Super sus"
Rock you've created a organized MONSTER
I hear grians outdo music and I’m like ooo a time laps 2 seconds later by guys
-does the back -organizes chests  Who is this and what happened to the real grain?
who else thinks there should be a tree 10 times bigger than Scars tree and have 10 hermits live on it
TBH, I feel as if living in your shop would have been better with an actual building as your shop.
No context, saw the thumbnail, and my brain told me it was a shoe lmao
It looks like a mystical chicken! And I love it!
Not sure why but grians house roof looks a lot like geminitays house in the afterlife smp with the gradient being pinkish color on the bottom and getting more green on top
Couldn't Mumbo just wax the copper blocks and make the entire thing backfire on you?
Looks less like a alchemists hut and more like a sauropod lol. Not a bad thing
Dude, what texture pack do you use? it's beautiful!
OW that hurt at the beginning of the vid
Oof what a cliff hanger. Stoked for this project!!
Grian: **nails MLG water bucket trick** Dream: **sweating profusely**
does anyone have the ig account that inspired the base?
Scar and Grian are hilarious together
He did the back
20:56 and just 2 days ago it was pi day :)
“The entity spoke to me” “The person living there- me- is studying the weird and wonderful thing that is the entity” GRIAN LOREEE YEY XD
I think impulse had a wither boss farm in the end that he used the iron golems for in season six
ok nice starter base but it kinda looks like a boot.
"I have never been so organized since I built an item sorter that I never used." - Grian 2022
Grian: you're all gonna be proud of me bc of what I did  Me: finished the back?  Grian: I sorted ALL my stuff
Time to spawn the wither
what song for mongtage?
ITS NOT just a bolder....  Its a rock😢  pt:3
6:39 I think we all know how these kind of jokes end.
I’m waiting for the mesh base to not have a back or the chest monster to come and reappear again
I love the early 80's time lapse music lol
Dude. You should add your nether portal like inside the stone beneath your house
Why did you build a tower if you could have off handed the blocks and hold right click and then left click at the same time
"i apologize for stamping on your face right at the start of the video that was very rude of me" oh don't worry good sir, it was a mistake and nothing more (mustache sounds intensify) hm hm hm Hm hM hm
Scar just got out of surgery Grian, do NOT give him a heart attack.
Didn't Impulse just build a raid farm and villager trading hall? Why not just join him?
Btw: deepslate, orange carpet and acacia planks go really well together, and especially as a trading hall
“I don’t want to be a house”
Yes! Collab with Tango!
Really surprised Grian and the other Hermits never knew about the golems destroying a wither in less than 60 secs.  It's the only way I kill withers these days.
And it looks like a cat
Someone needs to put at least one arrow in pearls Windigo as if it was shot by gym's  archer. I feel that someone is you
There once was a Grian who lived in a shoe.
I'm as surprised as scar is knowing that iron golems will take out the wither for you in this game and I will be using this method to take him on. Thank you 😦😆 also everyone knows you too well so glad scar had a totem of undying.
15:02 was it the back? Oh. It's still an achievement but ok
Still a pretty nice boulder.
Next, Grian will become the Cherry Pie Guy. Just like Jani Lane of Warrant.
Sus…very sus.
IT HAS A BACK, WITCHCRAFT
Mc
Low key looks like a shoe, very curly shoe. Grain you gotta change plans again
Grian: I have no idea if this is going to work Me, who watched the short he uploaded like yesterday: Ha, I know it does you fool
Oh I'm gana do that when I downloub m
To be honest I think Grians copper oxidizing wall will back fire on him because Mumbo will probably wax everything
your starter base kinda reminds me of a tiny dog, idk why I mean this in a good way though
Day 1. I’ve arrived at this settlement after many days of traveling through what almost seems like a void between dimensions. upon arriving here there was an extremely large boulder standing alone next to a river. I noticed a very faint beating which almost sounded like… a heartbeat? I went to investigate and found an opening leading into the rock. It was almost completely hollow except for a strange clump of water on the top of the ceiling. I used my bamboo scaffolding to get to it so I could inspect it. My suspicions were correct. It was magic holding it up. The source seems to be a symmetrical organic relic which gave off the strange beating. It was the heart. I’ve decided to stay here to study the boulder from here. Ah yes it seems ill need a name. how about the entity?  Day 2.  I realize “The Entity” really isn’t an original name at all… but that’s beside the point. I’ve already started calling that now it would just be weird if I stopped. Anyway, today The Entity somehow over night grew a tree on the top of itself!? It used multiple different kinds of trees intertwined into the one ginormous tree. I went into the entity and found an abundance of all types of wood. Prime for the taking. The other people have apparently thought it was a shop. I don’t exactly know if that will upset the entity or not… but hey, it’s giving me money so I don’t have a problem with it.                   My storage has gotten out of hand just like in past settlements. Ill must make some kind of base of operations before I start getting used to living outside.  Day. 3 	Today was an eventful day. I finally built the house that I’ve been putting off. I used a lot of different colors and resources I found from my time here. I’m very proud of myself, mostly because of how I actually organized all my junk. The house looks pretty dang good 	I decided id finally advance enough to get a beacon. Found that the iron golems, that local villagers use as defense against the monsters of the night, are very effective against the Wither. The beacon will help tremendously with my advancements. 	Speaking of the local villagers. They are not as advanced as the other hermits but definitely not uncivilized. They are always very eager to trade. But only with emeralds which are decently rare.  But I gave them a few pieces of wheat and pumpkins and they gave me enough emeralds to start the trading. I plan to hire them and make a permanent trading center to get the multiple goods they offer. As me and a fellow Hermit named Scar were about to start, another hermit by the name of tango offered up an idea. It sees that a band of pillagers are constantly tormenting them but when they are killed, they drop a lot of Emeralds and a strange looking totem that keeps you from dying. (I call it “The Totem Of Undying) a totally original name. tangos plan is to farm them since they always seem to reproduce like rabbits. So, then we are able to freely trade with the villagers. 	There are no updates on the Entity…      This is an idea i had after grian said that he would be "investigating" the entity. its supposed to be a kind of log of the entity and the magicians journey. hope yall like it and maybe even grian will see this and put this in a book in the server * wink wink*
Does this mean you and Scar are going to stay up late, swapping manly stories?
#2 on trending! Good stuff man!
Hey! Your new starter house is very similar to one of the floating island wizard village houses I'm currently planning. And is so much better than mine 😂
So you moved from a rock to a boot? Upgrades
I thought when he said we were proud of him i thought proud of him cuz he built the back😂😂😂💀
You just know mumbo is going to wax all of grains copper lol
It's a duck?.... Im pretty sure its an duck not a house? Can't fool me it's a duck!!
It looks like a shoe
I LOVE the house! The blue squiggly on the roof looks like a snake! You could give it buttons for eyes, call it your snouse. Snake house.
Going into business competing with tangos copper farm? Uh oh
Please bring back Unorganized Grian, Organized Grian just feels weird.
Clutch!!1!11!!!!1
I love cuss it's so funny and it's also just like Grian to tempt fate like how he did with mumbo.
Grian has evolved
I love how Grian has a child-like excitement about the fact that he finally organized something. Good job man, proud of ya!
You're grain is evolving  Grian -----> groin achieved skills Does back of builds
pie
“Your gonna be proud of me look- it is all labeled!”  What about the fact that it has a back? Like that’s a rarity in Grian history
HE..HEY GRIAN....mumbos spreading your moss
did you record this on Pi day too??
You could replace the lantern to a soul sand one I think it would look nice
Why so much torch spam on the surface?
the house you made looks awesome :)
Didnt Mr peace love and plants  mumbo use iron golems to kill the wither last season?
Try this on bedrock I dare you
Now you've got yourself a way to make a wither farm
GRIAN DID THE BACK!!
Grian saying you guys are gonna be so proud of me  Me: thinking OMG he did the back
GRAIN YOUR HOUSE IS A BOOT AND I CANT UNSEE IT
The BOOT starter base, we now have the boulder and the boot
Ok hear me out, the entity is a large chunk of moon rock left over from the last season
why does the house remind me of a shoe, but still very nice👌
Love how you can't spawn the Wither if it has one of its heads twisted back,as if we couldn't deal with a slightly disabled Wither.
the raw copper and salmon have similar colours so for a second I thought he was eating copper at the beginning
What if you used a wither to mine? Like for diamonds or netherite
END TIME ARE NEAR WND TIMES ARE NEAR  GRIAN IS ORGANIZING IT THE END OF THE WORLD
After season 8 any time Grian is seen with wither skulls it brings panic to everyone
Am I the only one who sees the snake on the house
It kinda looks like a legless Wizard Doggo
O R G I N A Z E D !
HERMITCRAFT PLANS: everyone: build grian: uhh wut, u expect me to build?!?!?! I WANT WAR
Anyone know what the timelapse music is?
You made a short about it grian
To be honest, the entity could end up being like the egg from the dream SMP. (Who knows?)
Grian : its supposed to be like an Alchimests house   Me : its a shoe
Grian: wonder why don't people kill wither by golem cuz it is easier People: *kill wither under bedrock and make it suffocate*
Grian u wasted iron . U can go to the end and the bedrock on the middle go under it and spawn it under the bedrock the whiter will get stuck in the bedrock aand u can just kill it ez.
The house looks great!  But it does very much remind me of “The old lady who lived in the shoe” 😂
THE WATER CLUTCH WAS SO NICE, AND HE WAS SO HAPPY LOL😭😂😂😂
Villagers aren’t really a broken mechanic for the majority of the world. Professional players have Soooooo much more time available. For the average player it’s a very different story.
no way. It cant be. he finally did it
Grian is like my favorite minecraft player right now
I have made a redstone machine that makes the ingredients for pies automatically
now grian is boring what a shame
12:12 living under a rock isn’t always a good thing  *sad patrick noises *
This (was)on 1# trending for gaming.Hermitcraft and Grian are so popular,and I couldn't be prouder.
what was the song that you played when you were building the starter base?
had to stop the video, stamping on my face right at the start! hahaha god i just started laughing what a way to start the video thank you!
Your base should be the goblins to Scar's Elves.
Happy Pi day!
Grian: It's meant to look like some sort of alchemist or magician lives here! Me: *shoe*
tou dont need the golems its just very easy to kill the wither in a tunnel like that
Grand that's not going to work cuz impulse has actually a copper Farm you can go into business with him and get the Copper from him impulse SV already built the copper Farm
I just keep seeing the house as a dog with a hat.
O:
dang grian, you don't watch impulse's hardcore series.  He did the golem trick first
put stairs underneath the slabs or put barrels instead of dark oak block that the chains connect to for your shelf
For the building with copper, place the oxidized blocks and then wax and deoxidize afterwards to save inventory space
Seem's like iMpulse figured out to put golem's close to mother spawn in hi HC series
Bet someone adds a beak. Quack Quack 🙂
15:13 Impossible
show of hands if you spawn Iron Golems along with the Wither under the portal in the End ✋
It's almost the exact same house as in season 8.
i always love the time-lapse song is so nice. :)
Glad to see you finally showing your more pious side to your audience.   Ba dum tsss
That base gives me astrologer vibes
If anyone wanted to know, people don’t usually use iron golem to fight the wither (at least I don’t see others doing it),  cuz making iron golem takes time and material to build, also finding a good spot to fight the wither will normally take as long as the iron golem and even taking no damage while fighting
Call the shop the “Grientity”.
THERE ARE ORGANIZED CHESTS ?!?!
Shoe house
hermits working together I love where season 9 is heading!
The villager farm sounds sick! But going up against Tango's copper farm might be a bit of a pitched battle...
oreo
He’s living in a boot! Old fairytale vibes
20:55 "I'm a pie guy" 2 seconds later 1 porkchop is missing
S H O E . ✨
I like the top swirly thing, but I think the bottom swirly thing doesn't work very well.
Grian: makes starter base. Also Grian: abandons it in the same episode to go live in the boonies with Tango and Scar.
grian is so nice but so chaotic and i love it because it just proves how much personality he has so that makes him a really fun to watch youtuber
I thought Grian was so excited to show us he did the back🤣 Not just organized
Hermitcraft 9: Episode 4 - Fighting the Enderdragon wuth iron golems
Grain:I want to experiment with color this season also Grian:builds huge bland rock
I will be the one to ask. What made him think to live in a SHOE?
Thats an undercover bdubs build
OI GRAIN! You can put chests on llamas and have them follow each other, they form a congo line if you lead one!
Am i the only one who thought there was a mermaid behind the build?
you should add some shroom lights into your base! :)
Do healing pots work for killing the wither? If so that would be good because you can heal yourself and kill them.
Does anyone else think the house looks kinda like a wizard duck?
what if he did like a magical forest and made the trees the blue nether trees
am i dreaming, because its episode 3 and grian and most of the hermits don’t have an elytra. I know they are taking things slow this season
If I would chose one person to add to hermitcraft it would be butterjaffa
Impluse does the thing with the iron golems
Setting up copper blocks out in the open It feels like it could be its own cool build on it's own like rows of of copper blocks maybe worshipped by a lost civilization
Even the wither can't fight deepslate lol
Did Grian actually organize? Who is this man?
STEP/STOMP ON ME GRIAN 🥰😍💖❣💗💟💕💗💞
*Let's take the moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into the content for us* 🙂🙂❣
Season 8: Season of Puns Season 9: Season of Buns
People do that on bedrock because a wither killer wasn’t possiable for a long time
I'm more proud that he put a back on the base 😂😂
Am I the only one who thought when we would be proud it meant he did the back
Me: takes out earbuds  Put them back in: netherite beacons
Wadzee has done it but with 100 golems...
Scar is dressed like an elf and the only thing you can't take seriously is your fishing pole picking him LOL
That starter base, I thought he was a elf in a shoe......
grian may have forgoten about a sheild
Double dare you to try and take the wither down like this in bedrock. 🤣
The entity : talks to Grian about it not wanting to be a house.  Grians Mind: lets gooooo I don't have to blow this thing up anymore, because I built the back of it.
0:02 oh no grian keep going😏
I mean your prob won’t see this but people don’t use golems bc they just use a smite 5 sword bc smite 5 go brrrrrrrrrrrrr on skellys that includes withers and iron is hard to get without an iron farm
17:00 is that scar's alt?
Where's good builder grian this season? That boulder is the ugliest thing I've ever seen. The new house has an overdose of colors and blocks that don't match... and the signs just make it look even more amateur.
You are a pie guy too?
Name your trident, try-ant subscribe!
Does bedrock strat not work on the hermitcraft server or does grian just not know about it
this gives me an idea for a wither arena
Good job on the sorting system! :D
cliffhanger :'-D
you should change your head to the wither skeleton head then collect three of that fake skeleton head and prank your friends
You: I'm going to age up some of this copper. What I think will go through Mumbo's head when he finds out: Revenge Time.
Why do I feel like grian's entity is going to be something like oli's orb* 😂    (*afterlife smp)
I love this base best. Might be the best starter base ngl
ooh an elf boot house for elf booty
Hello
Grian, please have a big spaceship as your base, the backstory could be that the aliens have come to stop people from learning about the Entity
LOL! He used the iron golem trick in the previous short he made!
I personally think killing the Wither the way you were hitting it before it reached the iron golems is much easier and much cheaper than using the iron golems
Grain now lives in a duck
I honestly think that beating wither manually is more fun than golems
Place item frames between the chests.
14:56 almost thought he was talking bout the back
house looks kinda like a duck. I like it. quack quack
Scar, Mumbo and Grian are on of the best trios ever.
man the 80s music is a banger love it
Any bets on how many episodes it will take grian To make another chess monster
Scar learning MLG and Grian being organized (and creating backs to builds).  What madness has taken over the server?
15:16 what did u do with Grain! ORGANIZATION i never thought i would see the day
Doing the back!? Being organized!?! Who is this imposter cause grian/grain could never be like this
They don't do the golem trick to defeat the weather easiest way to do it go to the end and put the weather under the bedrock so he get stuck and you can easily kill him
i really love hermit craft cause there is no evil people then you will like hate them like the dream smp this is do chilled
Why doesn't anyone ever make tipped arrows instead of a million potions? Idk about Java but on bedrock you can put 3 potions into a cauldron and make a whole stack of weakness arrows. I use a regular bow and use the lowest power shot to hit em. Beats making tons of splash potions
20:27 Do item frames do that? Anyone else notice that it didn’t break when he broke the wood?
GRIAN?? ORGANIZED AND WITH BACKS OF BASES??? Who is this fresh new man
Please use a blast furnace to bulk smelt copper
btw mumbo is mossing your copper
personally i'd think Soul Lanterns match the more Alchemist/Mage theme for your build but its your call Grian
When I saw the roof I first thought it was a snake stuck in a house.
when Grian said proud.I thought he was gonna say that he finished the back
a very piest person
Grian: is organized  Me: WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH GRIAN?!
11:22 Did someone say sus?!?
water bucket mlg is so ez
good
15:15 last time you made it organized verything not just books you never ended up using your storage system like in season 7
Grian is my favorite youtuber literally ever! i watched him since season 6
Grain you say “wiver” instead of wither XD (pls pin me)
lets play the game of how long will the storage system last!
Why Does The Entity Look Like Patricks House But Tilted Upwards
Scar: what do villagers taste like?    Best line in the episode
Dats alot of beans
I think nobody really uses iron golem to kill the wither because a) it uses a lot of iron and b) you can just cheese it by putting it under the end portal
Logs 2: Electric boogaloo
yo grian, if you want the warped vine to stop growing you can put string at the end :)
Would all those potions of weakness and golden apples be necessary when you got infinite emeralds from the raid farm? It takes a lot of work and a long time to convert all the villagers. The only benefit is reduction in price. The cap on the amount of things you can trade before needing to wait for the villager to refresh is still the same. I don't see the point in spending all that time and effort doing the converting when you have infinite emeralds coming from the raid farm.
Yay, starter house
The thing I love most about how far minecraft has come is the sheer amount of blocks, textures, and colors that exist now to build from
I hate watching videos as they come out because i cant binge like 20 episodes in one day, i have to wait for the next one
Am I the only one that get a shoe house vibe
Anyone else think it looks like a shoe
Mumbo should make a vault door into the copper fence wall thingy😂
I just cried out of happiness after seeing him properly building a proper storage system after 2 freaking seasons
Only real ogs remember when grian went to japan
With the wither, I've seen this done with a box under the home portal in the end filled with iron golems, its how people who sell beacons gather them on mass because the wither can't move at all if done right
Love the starter base but uhh anyone else see an elf shoe?
10:00 It Vorked!
I have done the wither thing with iron golems when I was 4 and it wasn’t under ground so it didn’t work lol gg
#1 on trending👏👏👏  just makes me cry💖💖💖🧡
15:29 grian we’re proud of you
It still looks like the old one it has the same idea of the last season
grian, no need to apologize for standing on our faces in the beginning, i like feet- I MEANN UHH-
I love your starter house and big props for getting your chests organized but I gotta say... It looks like a giant elf shoe and with the neighborhood (and the neighbors), it works well 🤣
I know he wants it to look like an alchemist hut, but with the curly roofs, it looks more like the the shoe from "There's an Old Woman Who Lives In a Shoe"
Ngl i dont like the style and color palette he should have gone for a wood build to match with scar
I never expected to see this in my life
Suggestion i found on reddit for your shop: they said that you should add a crab in front of the boulder and call it hermit-crab.
I usually use iron golems to defeat the wither. I'm equally surprised people dont do this.
grian proved exactly why people dont kill the wither with iron golems, even if they dont want to cheese with bedrock. idk how to do the bedrock trick  so I spawn my wither in my strip mines, and just hit it as it comes down the corridor. before the wither got to the iron golems, Brian demonstrated just that, since the wither couldnt even hit him while it was in the tunnel
I got chills when grian said "labeled"
17:02 bad times with scar???… 💀
7:58 Prank Backfired. Cost to Scar: 1 Totem. Cost to you: Revenge for theft of copper.
START RECORDING IN 4K!!
Grian's gone from living under a rock to living in a shoe.
So that's why Grian posted a short of him killing the wither with golems.  Makes so much more sense
Grian. You should make a segment in every Hermitcraft episode called "Getting Bags With The Boulder" and you simply...get bags with the boulder, you see how many diamonds you've made at the end of the video.
Grian: "I want my builds to tell a story."  Oh okay Little old lady who lived in a boot!
mmm this is a good donut
Who agrees he should post more?
me watching the first part: oHMYGOD HE MINES LIKE ME  !! silk touch then towering up with a fortune pick lol
Wait if you use the wither for mining like those guys from 2b2t (but without hacks) you might actually get diamonds or if your in the nether for ancient debrie
I recommend using a blast furnace for your ores
I joined a building competition in minecraft its being held in our school
Yes more hermitcraft
grian is now the old woman who lives in a boot
As one comment once said   S H O E
THAT MLG AT THE BEGINNING OMG I really didn't expect that out of you but I always forget about the MCC days and the hermitcraft wars, Minecraft legend
People don't do that iron golem strategy because it costs so much iron to kill the wither once. Those 15 iron blocks are much better put to a beacon than the wither especially when you can kill the wither by just digging a long tunnel or suffocating it in bedrock. Your average player will not have an abundance of iron by the time they fight the wither.
17:03 I thought he said beans 😂
Grian makes perol' base last season this season.
simple answer, it's expensive
For some reason I was never subscribed til now... sorry
Grian should put a lighthouse on the entity, If he edited it enough it would work.
Hey Grian, just saying, I’m actually not proud because you sorted. I’M PROUD THAT YOU ACTUALLY BUILT THE BACK!!!!
Grian, your house is a shoe
Grian, a little tip, not sure if you know. In 1.18 you can put copper blocks in a stonecutter and you can get 4 cut copper for every copper block
Busted, Scar has been. Get the Sheriff. Or The Derp of Black Plasma Studios fame. And of course, The Derp's Fish.
THE BAKC
Sus Super sus -Grian 2022
That... is a Shoe.
Ur starter house looks like a dog 😂
Under the rock for your base
19:00 he is going to wax all of that you know
Despite your roof looking like the Nike logo, it’s still pretty good
The first few second, I thought he's hitting the screen for a second.
You should build a telescope facing towards the entity like the telescope from Zelda BOTW (I forgot the name of the specific building but I’m sure someone knows what I’m talking about)
It's a shoe!
Honestly more amazed at the fact that there is a back to the build than the storage system
People don’t use golems very often because the bedrock in the end is much easier.
Remember when starter houses were wooden boxes?
Grian managed to build something out of acacia that looks really good.
We have a new bob ross
congrats on trending!
Grian, use a blast furnace for smelting the copper. It's 2 times faster.
Grian  you are not you without the chest monster
Is the house desighn an animal? or am i the only one who sees it, giid wirk love the content
Who is this the grian I know would never organize
Grian, I know you won't see this but if you do please reply. how did you get friends like the ones you have because I really want friends just like yours who take stuff serious but can have fun aswell I just really wants friend (s) like yours
15:12 Who the **** are you and what did you do to Grian?!?!
oh, I thought it looked like a boot
Grian, I don’t if you know this, but if the iron golems get in the way of you placing a block, just know that is you made the golem, it won’t drop kick you across the room.
Anyone else think that grians new base looks like a dog with a elf hat?
The starter base kinda looks like a goat...very cute
9:01 I enjoy how after the boatem incident, people don't trust Grian releasing a wither
BRING BACK THE TREES
No, Grian, that wasn't pink before. One moment while I check Pearl's video....  Edit: Must have missed the Livestream.
you threw your pickaxe and didnt pick it back up lol
One thing that may help with lag since hermit craft can get very laggy is to have one or two community trading halls instead of making your own, especially in close proximity of eachother. Ik this has almost noting to do with the vid but it might help
Grian is being organized
Grian: It's called the entity  My brain: so it's basically a minecart?
dude grians got a great new pie food source… some one say hes a pie-oneer
I love this grian scar firendship getting more and more screentime
Grian, the British man who lived in a copper shoe.
Grian........your now the Women living in the shoe......you built a shoe house...................... at least it has a back.
muahahahhaa... 4 lvls on you Grian... How many times did you try this intro?
Yay grian is not a homeless hobo anymore
I love your videos
Minimum 10 villages for it to work but its really worth it
Grain calling himself the Pie Man makes me think of that Pimania song
Very sus creeper
I loved the building tips. I definitely wouldn't mind if you sprinkled some tip throughout the season and make a more regular thing!
Trie to Spawn a raid in a Iron farm you Can farm it this way and it extrêmement effective
10:50 people dont do it because those who want to cheese the fight just use the much cheeper bedrock method
seeing ghow overpowered golems are, i shall use these trick soon
just wait till grian creates wither mining technology with mumbo and scar to mine netherite
Knowing hermitcraft, Grian saying he likes eating pie will be VERY important later on in the season
People don't use iron golems for the wither since you can easily just keep hitting it and back up the tunnel without taking any damage. Or you can get it stuck in bedrock
Logs 2 electric boogaloo?
IM SO PROUD OF YOU BROO
I didn't expect there to be a back on your not so starter base
My dad plays Minecraft. He beat the wither in singleplayer in 13 seconds back in 1.7ish.
Wadzee did  the iron golem technique
The "starter base" looks like the house from the lorax lol
Shoe
I am already proud that the house has a back in the same episode it was built in.
scar: fool me once shame on me, fool me twice now your gonna get it, but you aint fooling me 3 times this season grian.
Now i get why grian randomly made a tutorial on how to beat the wither lol
GRIAN I AM PROUD
I love the little building tips you're giving throughout this episode! Can you do that more often?
It looks like a dog in a wizards hat! :)
6:15 it would not be the first time grian spawned a wither in the middle of everyones base
My default is stupid -Grian
I think the reason why most people don't do the iron golem strat is just because all the other wither strategies are much more controlled whereas there's a risk to the iron golems in that the wither could easily be distracted by other mobs in the area and pathfind away from the golems. There's a lot more risk involved when there's an element of randomness thrown in. So the end portal bedrock strat and the tunneling strat seem more ideal because you're in control of the whole situation.
#2 ON TRENDING FOR GAMING
Right click the green vine with shears to stop it growing
So organised wow in jellust
False is selling copper!!!
Pride base
Cultist Astrologist to Arcane Geologist
yo killer base concept, what if you collabed with another hermit and then built one big base but mirrored down the middle and each take one half to build what they want for their base
Grian, why do you spread out you copper?
WoW
Grian is better than dream confirmed Edit: nEvermind Edit 2: Grian is a minecraft genius
💀💀 scar asking what villagers taste like 23:51
Killing withers with golems is the only way i kill the wither
Also who are you and what did you do to my boy grian?
grian, you're right. we are proud of you! good job :)
Saw on reddit someone says that g should make the entity a hermit crab with the shell being the entity as well as call it hermit grab
you should use a wither to mine diamonds
Oh thank god for a sec there I thought the back was missing
Number two on trending
Oh my god he finished the back
Grain has has made a back AND a proper stoarage system, THIS IS REVOLUTIONARY
I guess you could say he has been caught red handed
sell copper? with tango's farm out there?  better make it raw
Can. Build yoda
nice job on #1 for gaming Grian!
your house looks like a wizard duck with no bill
leave it to the hermits to find a new way to kill the wither every season. LOL
Gotta love gradients
Is it just me or is Grian's starter base looking like a boot 🤨
That is literally the only way I fight the wither. lol
14:45 I thought that the reason that we ware to be proud is that you did the back but then I remembered that it's the mega base the one you never do the back
Impulse beat you to the Iron Golem v Wither strat, sorry Grian.
Lol, in the start of the video, my mind was like "Hey, you're stomping on me" then Grian apologized.
tango is the guy who makes deals and takes favors
Is it just me or does Grians house look like a dog
it looks like a shoe ngl
ITS ALL ORGANIZED!!!
This is going to be great!
15:13 more proud of the fact you finished the back of the build lol
Wadzee did the same thing but with 100 golems
Grian base looks like a magical dog
Grian I am more proud of u doing the back of the starter house
Grian, there's an easier method. Spawn the wither underneath the end portal (trapping it) then spawn some iron golems, done. Edit: Impulse used this method hundreds of time during S7, common Grian😂
It looks like a shoe. Grain is the old lady that lives in a shoe.
I love how grian unknowly subconsiously places torches everywhere making torch spam at everyones base
my first thought? “why is grian living in a shoe???”
So, Grian does not watch Impulse vids...
Pie/ pork war lol
Grian beating the youtube trend system
#2 on trending for gaming
Damn you made warped planks/stems look GOOD thats so awesome
grians the little old lady who lived in a shoe
I'm actually proud of him, is that wierd?
IDEA! A copper shop where people put in there own copper, select there oxidation amount, pay some diamonds, and trade there non oxidized copper for oxidized copper.
im sorry grian but you have built a shoe for a house i mean at least it looks good
Grian’s starter base looks like a llama when you look at it from the side 😂
I don't think it's a good idea to sell copper when tango has a copper farm he can get more copper easier
6:09 season 8 flashbacks
The entity has taken over  It is not in control anymore
Oh a new way to farm deepslate, wither bombing
Congrats on organizing Grian!
Grian trying to sell copper while Tango made an industrial copper making monster machine that gives Neverending supply, lol
Well i try the golem strat at the wither,but my phone was fainting as the wither breaks a lot of blocks(and kinda yes, it works on bedrock but you really need a beefy setup if you want to do this.)
Gonna be real here, the roof looks like the top part of an orange bellpepper
I dare you to try and mine with the wither. Imagine how easy. Tho it will be dangeous
This timelaose music has the same vibes as scars timelaose music same artist? :D
Is it just me, or did the time lapse music have parts of the song with serious fnaf security breach vibes?
Grian: was that pink before? Me:was that there before?
episode 1 "I'm not making a starter house im making the mega base right away"   episode 3 "I'm making a starter house"
I LOVE YOUR STARTER HOUSE!!!
14:39 I legit thought ur house was meant to be a duck and now I can’t unsee it, should deffo add a beak!
Ok who kidnaped grian
Oh so at 6 min he hasn't technically made the short
I know that ethoslab fights the wither under the end-portal with iron golems.
He didn't see Tango's copper Farm, did he? XD
Are you gonna have a last life season 3
I love the starter base can’t wait to see what comes next I hope it’s in a similar style!✨
I don't do the golem vs wither now because its such a waste of iron
sorry for so many comments You should put a rail over the stone bridge so it's a people bridge and a minecart bridge I think that would look quite nice
Lol, Scar has all the copper he could want and no diamonds anyways, and Tango has an ridiculoussss copper farm, and Grian sells copper... Hahahaha
When he keeps saying that the rock is a entity i think about the backrooms and i like to imagine the rock traveling around the world and tries to find materials to sell and people to sell to
Hey man, not be a umm bummer, ya know.... a real party pooper, a no fun scaly waggin Bing bing boy, but that's too much copper 😐
😶 do you think they know about Impulse's triple raid farm?  😬
What an absolutely amazing episode. I subbed within the first 5 minutes.
15:08 i serously thought you were going to say you gave the houes a back
It's obviously "Putter", not "Putter", duh. 🙄
The base has a back
I recommend experementing with bamboo shoots in greenery
Wow it’s only been Three episodes and there is a whole entire evolving city
Am I the only one who thought it was a really cool elvish shoe to go along with scars elf build…. Sorry…
guy eating pie build copper to the sky, mlg but he die. bye bye pie guy :(
Will Grian do another tag this season? this is a genuine question.
I am proud of your organization.
Should've said "NO SCAR NOT THAT CLOSE" and hit him don't take that sentence out of minecraft or you WILL go to prison
1.19 sure will help with mining a tall tower of ore. Allays! Also, if you build UNDER the shop, then at the end of the season you can say...          Have I been living under a rock this ENTIRE season!?      Sorry, not sorry? :p Edit: (To be fair, Grian just made the same pun at 12:!5)
You try to sell 1copper ingert for 2 raw copper .
"Loads of splash positions" *has 5...
“ we want to do something cool thogeteEEeEER” 😂😂
"Im a pie guy" *eats pork*
The starter house looks like the shoe house. You know the one from the nursery rhymes.
He acts like we're be proud of the fact that it is all labeled in reality World proud that he finish the back
I'd prefer if the entity was the button
I'm not trying to be mean your starter house looks like a shoe lol 🤣
boot
I was laughing so hard when grian was emphasizing that it was organized! LOL
We only talk about living under a rock, never in a rock.
Love your vids
Did Grian do a whoopsie? The max quality is 480p.
So now you own a boulder and a boot. This season is definitely gonna be something
Very fancy boot
I like the word "Arcanist", student of the Arcane, for your starter base's persona.
is it just me or does it look like a shoe?
I love the starter house!
Name the boulder Dwayne
I thought he was gonna say "You're gonna be so proud because I built the back this time"
For the floating chests you can make a tiny tree to go with scar
torches do nothing to the spawner in the nether where ther is FIRE. if you didnt know fire=light
Did anyone notice how grains house looked like a boot or shoe?
17:01 BadTimeWithScar left the game
Who are you and what have you done with Grian
Comment Grian, I would love to see a revised version of the Build School and Building noob to pro
I felt my heart skip a beat when Grian placed that 3rd wither skeleton head near Scar's build! I totally thought that it was gonna spawn and destroy that tree!
So you live in a dog now?
Yeah, looks like my insane blast furnace system that I built back in 1.15 is getting some use now. Talking 18 at a time
OMG, you should make the highest part of your house an enchanting room!!! Perfect aesthetic
9:55 Impulse
you can suffocate withers under the bedrock portal in the end, and put iron golems there
He stepping on me I THOUGHT YOU WERE PG
Your base looks like a cat
i love the house it really suits the style that you have BUT I DO recommend maybe make a sort of auto super smelter to help with smelting in the future season
Who else though that this took forever to come out?     Now ik hpw ot feels to have to wait for the next episode of Hermitcraft. I have just finished season 8.
that's a shoe or a duck without a nose
Grian: I'm doing something stupid Grian 10 seconds later: I am doing something stupid
Ok grian is doing the Berlin wall, what's next, the leaning tower of peeza?
Just so we make sure Scar and no one else steals Grians copper, there are 10 layers of copper blocks.
Looks kinda like a shoe
There once was a Grian who lived in shoe.
not sure how i feel about this build. i checked out the inspiration before seeing grians and thought it was super cool. i feel like this base almost uses too much gradient on the walls. instead of giving the viewer a focal point its a little all over the place. dark grey to white might be too extreme of a gradient to use on such a small build. i doubt it's worth changing, but i just wanted to through that out there for future builds.
The starter base reminds me of last season’s starter base
Grain: "I'm a pie guy"  Very next frame: clearly has eaten a piece of pork
You did a duck in a hat?
Wizard Cat House!!
Wait, it's not a dog house?
Not even 10 minutes into the video and some great examples of a bad friendship
...He lives in a shoe...
Iron golems are really expensive and there’s much cheaper and consistent ways of doing things like raids and wither farming. But yes, they work. They’re very good but very expensive.
In want to see grian fight a wither on bedrock version
Now we have grians booty
i was actually - for some reason - proud for grian to land that bucket at the start. good job
You should definitely fill the entity with water and have the shop parts be all over the walls and ceiling
Your house is lovely Grian! Experimenting with things is always pretty fun and you seemed to have enjoyed it! Very proud of your organization and you explainer interior tips felt like watching one of your pre-hermitcraft videos. Looking forward to more!
There is a lot going on with the colours, almost too much. Like I'm not sure where something starts and sometimes ends.  But then again he's more experienced with that kinda stuff, eh still cool though
There can’t be a hermitcraft season without Grian finding out a new way to beat the wither -
Grian why not live in to the nether 🤣🤣 Free space hahaha
So much for “no starter base this season”
most use iron golems when you lock a wither as it spawns so it cant whiter effect the golems , normally under the portal out of the end is the best spot for it so most seasons have a wither killing chamber built there by someone
Scar def needed the NLG with how much he dies.
Scar being entirely ignored when he wonders what villagers taste like is so sad
I love your vids but, Why don't you use shaders, It will make your builds look more aesthetic.  Shader Recommendations:         FPS Cost(This depends on your CPU):  MakeUp Shaders                            Low Sildurs - Lite  to Ultra High          Low - High Complementary SHaders             Medium BSL                                                   Medium SEUS Shaders                                  High
HE FINALLY DID THE BACK!!!
Lets be honest the storage area will become a chest monsta again
Why are you not using a Blast furnace?
Use blast furnace, it just few iron It make smelt ore faster
Opinions on the Copper Horns?
Grian: It spoke to me, it said, ‘I really don’t want to be a house.’
A very large elvish boot, love it
The starter base makes me think of the story about the old lady who lived in a shoe.
If Scar is an elf, Grian should be a dwarf and Mumbo should be a hobbit
I just realized when I’m a old man I’m going to rewatch the whole set of seasons of hermit craft and miss the days when they would come out once a week or two
surprising you didnt make a face on the house
Brazil 🇧🇷🇧🇷
"Im,doing,something,stupid" *Grian*
The frame rate is so bad 😞
0:38 did enyone else say OHHHH with grian wen he did the stunt??? * sorry for spoilers lool *
I don't know if it's just me but the base looks like a dog
Grian be like: this is my starter base  ME: THAT IS A MANSION Later in the season: WHY IS THERE A MEGA MANSION LIKE HOW. .
The reason they don’t kill the wither with iron golems is because if you don’t have an iron farm then making iron golems is very expensive, an plus just spawning the with under the bedrock in the end will also kill it and would be way cheaper
Am I seeing things or is the BACK Done?
Your starter house looks familiar 🤔😏
That mlg was sick ngl
I love Grian’s elf shoe.
Grain- I'm really going to use this (copper) Me- Rek w/ all copper house?!?!
11:24 😳😳😳😳😳
Groan you’re base looks like a thing scar would build btw it’s so good
I say that the organization will last for... an episode.... ...if that
I think Grian might be being psychically controlled by an actually good Minecraft player...this is eerie.
Why does it look like tinker bell had a boot?
I always assumed that Hermits didn't use golems to make the wither more entertaining.
there was a old grian who lived in a shoe. . . . . . .
am i the only one that heard scar go what do they taste like???
Using the wither to mine out deepslate looks pretty good
If that was bed rock they would be dead
THE HOUSE IT A CAT WITH ITS PAW FOWARD. THATS WHY THEY HAVE A SORT OF TAIL THINGY
15:20 Logs 2 electric boogaloo 😂
grian i believe tango has a monsterous copper farm
Di- did he just give us a mini building lesson?!?
Was anyone elses first thought to Grians finished starter base "elf shoe"? Like one of Santas elves xD
How is it organized
Hey grian you forgot to not to the back
Grian, its a great idea to have gaps on you since they give regen two and can be a life savor with the absorbtion too. You can tank lava damage with plain diamond armor if u chug it.
18:54 Grian be like: Let's build a wall!
I see mumbo waxing all your copper…
Grian I am very proud of you for being organized
You forgot the fifty chickens for wither roses
I recommend adding a slab or trap door under the chests on the wall then it looks like a shelf
the 4 soul sand gets placed Scar: gotta be a cool monument right? Grian*places 2 skulls* Scar oh no DON'T
remember when Grian doesn't want to do anything with beacons? oh how time flies...
I know that the organization won’t last
Iron golems vs withers are boring. That's why nobody's using them
10:00 why is nobody do this?  that guy who defeated a wither without left click, jumping, sprinting, shifting, no armor and in hard mode:
I love the sign for logs, “logs 2, electric boogaloo”
I'm more proud you finished the back lol
I love how scar can only survive with totems
In minute 15 when he said your are gonna be proud I was sure he is going to talk about that that he made  a back to the base
0:00 MY FACE
why when Grian says sus it sounds wrong
the reason that most people don't use iron golems is their trying to save the iron for a beacon or know how easy the wither is to kill
It looks like a boot
grain your becoming a piedict
Impulse already has a raid farm…
I feel bad for joehills in the chat not being answered 😅
Whats even better is he did the back of the base!!
"Im a pie guy" *has one less porkchop and a full stack of pies a nanosecond layer*
I’m a pie guy -Grian 2022
I saw Impulse use Golems on the Wither too. I'm totally doing it this way myself next time.
5:56 : general kenobi
Ok hear me out: Wither Strip Mining.
Wither is an Undead so smite Will do extra damage, wither also broke obi some PPL doesnt this, also wither Will follow you when you hit it
have you thought of doing a minecraft building class
The house reminds me of the old lady who lives in a shoe nursery rhyme
one day. scar is gonna get good at minecraft. And Reverse the rolls.
We all knew this was coming after the YouTube short
That gradient is amazinggg
Do this for the warden too
Precious Pies= PP name it Grain's PP :D
Grians house is a dog lol.
16:38 I think theres LORE
I THIUGHT IT WAS A DOG
first he was a hobbit, then he was a dwarf, and now he wants to be an elf :D
Copper should be the next currency, just make everything expensive. Also hope the world doesn’t end again!                                                                                      make  everything  end
one word bedrock     me who's a bedrock player whats that week thing
but in a good way
your bace looks like a boot
Why did the make the world have a border?
I think wadzee did that
also you could repair them with iron bars so you dont have to use so much iron and u can keep them
Grian: this build is kind of set up as an alchemists sort of lab  Me: it's a shoe
Be honest, who else here thought Grian was going to say "There is a back!" When he meant that he had moved all the random chests into the house.
He is living in a fancy shoe
Anyone else hear the similarity in the songs of Grian and Scar's timelapse songs? Like maybe Grian's is a remix of Scar's? I could be wrong, it just tickled my brain the same way.
used a blast furnace next time its faster then a regular furance.
Congrats on #2 trending!
Thank you Grian, I appreciate it
That's a nice poulaine for a roof.
Grian figuring out how to get the closest to spawning the wither without spawning the wither to troll Scar. that's growth right there. also I found out that if you place the soul sand last, even if all the heads are in the right position, it won't spawn. so there's that. you can place three soul sand and the three skulls and then place the bottom soul sand block and it won't spawn.  SCAR USING A TOTEM AND NOT DYING TO A GRIAN TROLL NOW THAT'S GROWTH Joe in the chat: "good for you? maybe?" LMFAOOOO  I've seen Wadzee use the iron golems. Also Impulse did it! He let the iron golems do all the work and then realized if you don't hit the wither, you can't get the achievements when you activate a beacon. It's a prerequisite trigger haha  YAY FOR HERMIT COLLABS  I love the timelapse music. Was it by Lupus Nocte? Because it definitely feels similar to Scar's super fast build mode music, Howling by Lupus Nocte.  I love the build! It's got fun colors and shapes like Pearl's does. What a fun shape. I love the interior already. And 😝 congrats on doing the back!  21:22 I'M LAUGHING SO GOOD I LOVE THIS SO MUCH ETHO'S EPIC BOOGEY KILL HECK YEAH
Hey can you turn around the top hook on the house pls I think it would look cool
Next episode there is going to be a chest monster
Nobody: Grains Log Chest: Logs 2 Electric Bugaloo  Actually, shout out to Grain loved the callback.
Poor mumbo is never going to become the richest hermit
The house build is kind of weird but in a really cool way, it's really neat! Also, I don't expect the organization to last long. Grian and Scar love doing chest monsters too much lmao
Grian, what we’re proud of is, you did the back!
Some people don't use golems course the end exists and golems are expensive
grian when you go mining you could use barrels instead of shulkers until you get them
6:20 me getting flashbacks from season 8
Episode 3 and you haven’t beaten the ender dragon, created 52 minigames or got 26 sets of fully enchanted netherite gear? Shame.
these guys are the best
There was an old woman who lived in a shoe. She had so many children, she didn't know what to do. She gave them some broth without any bread; And whipped them all soundly and put them to bed.
i am very proud  your storage is bidoof aprooved
Is it just me or does the 'alchemist house' look like a dog?
16:28 anyone see it?
Nobody tell Grian about Tango’s OP copper farm….
You... did the back?   It's treason then.
it looks like a shoe!
It looks like a boot. "There was an old woman who lived in a shoe."
I feel bad for thinking that grians base kind of looks like a boot
the house looks a bit like a shoe, a fancy fancy shoe
your wizard Grain u just need the hat lmao
itrade v2?? anyone getting nostalgia
He definitely saw the fishing rod thing from dream and hissy
Attempting to find hidden faces in Grian’s new house
Why does it look like a big shoe
Use a blast furnace to smelt copper faster
When he said it was the fact that he was actually organized I was VERY suprised and I had though he was gonna say that we would be proud of him because there’s a back LOL
there was an old grian who lived in a shoe.
20:55 a pie-oneer perhaps ?
The comments when they summoned the wither were great lol
first time in 2 seasons that he did the back on the same episode!!
I have to concur with Scar, it does look oddly similar to a cat in a witch's hat.
The organization scares me
"log 2 electric boogaloo" nice
Am I the only person that doesn't like that everyone is so close together? Like its cool but the skyline is very busy
you are living in a boot
The top of scars head looks like the real slim shady
No I’m not proud of the chests I’m proud of how you did the back
Is it only me, or is Cocaine and Hermitcraft a great combination? Minecraft and Cocaine in general! (to everyone who is not 10-15 yo haha)  Pls tell me if it's just me or do some of u also do coke while playing Minecraft?  btw. Pls dont block my comment, i am curious!
:
Your starters looks amassing! (referencing hermitcraft 8) hope great videos keep showing in my recommended like this one
Am I the only one that thinks Grians base looks like a cat?😂
Grean you’re living in a shoe
anyone else seeing a longneck dino
Anybody else see a puppy when he shows the house?
10:00 Me and a friend did this with about 10 iron golems, the wither lasted 10 seconds
Grian, having a sorted storage area? Organization? Impossible!
11:19 “How’d you get there in the middle of the day?” “S U S”  never thought I’d hear Grian say sus lol
i thought he was gonna say we’re proud of him for making the back 💀
Return of Poultry Man?
how quickly they change
what if the entity was an asteroid from space that started giving the area around it some unnatural abilities that came from outer space?
ngl, that starter house kinda looks like a pokemon
If the entity grew and enveloped the house then you would achieve your goal of living in it lol
There was an old Grian, who lived in a shoe.
Does anyone else miss the vibe of season 6 and 7
Sell weathered coppee
I personally don’t use iron golems when fighting the wither because of two main reasons. 1. The achievement, and 2. The adrenaline.
viniccius13 be like:
GUYS SPAM THIS COMMENT:  SCAR IS GOING TO PRANK YOUR STORAGE ROOM!!
The entity is a genius idea. It has no back to not finish because it is a stone.
"Look, look, look, there is no random junk"... I thought he was going to say "I built the back°"
The starter base looks likes a dog with a hat =)  When i did see it i cant unsee it lol =)
The house looks like a shoe
It looks like a cat wearing a wizard's hat.
Base looks like a shoe
you learnt how to oranise, grian !! pog
HE DID THE BACK
is it then built whole XD and not empty : P
you should make a trail from the entity with rooting dirt etc, giving it the idea that it has been moving has been moving
Why didn’t you make your starter base under the rock   12:12
the woman in the shoe vibes from that house
Yes I do not want to be a house
7:25 i am to scar i am to
:D
Impulse: am I a joke to you?
thats a dog
new advancement: unwithered steel desc:slay the wither with iron golems(the final hit needs to be from an iron golem)
Labelled!!!!!!!!!
#1 on trending for gaming
I cant lie the roof looks like something scar would build season 8
It looks like a shoe like the little old lady
it looks like a boot
The short makes since now... with what's going on and everything.
I use the Iron golems to kill the wither but i play bedrock. Only safe way to kill the thing.
My prayers have been answered, another grian video
starter base kinda look like a god wearing a wizard hat ngl(alchemist and magician?  NAH. a magical dog who want to find out wut the "ENTITY" is? yessir)
is grains house a shoe?
Pie’s sponsorship
Idea for the interior of The Entity: Glazed Red Terracotta with companion red blocks to make flesh, and bone blocks to make ribs and stuff. With the beating heart, it would be an incredible living entity with your skills!
TBH the boulder is more like the pebble...(the shape at least)
The track record with hermits eating one type of food is not,,, great,,, so I'm interested to see where this pie thing goes...
At first I was like: HE DID THE BACK!!! Then I noticed he was forced because you always see it from all sides
the roof & the tower makes your house look like an elf's shoe.
Me expecting he isn't going to use it
Make a water house for a starter base
would love to see more interior tips and tricks, I always truggle with filling my bases/houses beyond the practical blocks like furnaces, crafting tables and chests
I think your starter base looks like a llama
I like the longer episodes
i thought the thumbnail was a picture of pearls starter base
Eyyyy #1 on trending for gaming good job
There's a fricking back of the base
6:50 . . . how.
I think this base looks like a shoe xD
Grian, if you build to sky limit and dig to the bottom of the world, do a MLG from the top to bottom while others are online, it gives you a achievement called Caves & Cliffs
If you sell cut copper instead you can put copper blocks in a stonecutter and you’ll get 4x the cut copper
because you are a pi guy you should cover someones base with 10000 digits of pi lmao
I lover grians idea
I think y’all should literally have a emerald shower. I think that you could do the thing mumbo did last season with the potatoes but make it emeralds and totems of undying
I'm not proud that he made the house organized, rather Im Proud that he actually did the back
"Your gonna be so proud of me" Me: Getting hyped that he did the back. I really thought he was talking about that
Really good to see you spreading your wings into more vibrant colour palettes this season. Also may Mumbo wax all of your copper for what you have done 🤣
15:30 - yk what I’m more proud that he finished the back 😂
the house looks like a boot
Hello lol
Can I be a hermit in SE 10?? My gamer tag is PlebyNova if you need it
OMG a proper storage area and theres a back, are you alright grain?
you will love having villagers with a supply of unending emeralds from a raid farm ... it lets you just shop and buy whatever you want ... turns the villagers into a sort of minecraft superstore!
In this episode, a chest monster died and a house got built with a back. A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.
14:55 not gunna lie I thought he was going to say it has a back..
Nobody:   Scar: what do villagers taste like?
Nobody does the Iron golem wither strat because the wither is pretty easy and it’s expensive as heck
The first thing that came to my mind when loocking at this base was, oh shoe 😂😂 but it’s fan tastic and I am proud that the back is done and it’s organized, you’ve done it G you’ve done it
The torch didn’t stop the spawn. You placed a head backwards. If you hadn’t place the last head backwards there would have been a problem
No we’re proud u mad a back
Grian out here making an SCP
Did you know that you can cure zombie villager using tinted arrow of weakness and using piercing crossbow so you get unlimited weakness arrow 😶 it's work on bedrock edition, idk with java
It might be just me, but the starter house looks like one of those jester shoes that have the little bells on them.
Not funny episode
i mean impulse has a new HUGE copper farm so i don’t know how profitable selling it will be
Looks a bit like a puppy. Cute house.
Hey Grian, me and my friends are trying to find a good server hosting network and I'm wondering what you and the members of hermitcraft use to host servers.
Part of why people don't spend tons of iron to kill the wither is beyond me. ;P
grian: the villagers get eaten scar: what do they taste like?
Impulse used iron golems for the wither!!
if you put copper blocks into the stonecutter, you get 4 cut copper for every single copper block (at least on bedrock, I don't know about Java)
Ngl it looks like a fancy boot
the house is a shoe
why has nobody thought of branch mining with the wither yet? it seems like it would be so much quicker.
Why is grians starter base just a better version of my endgame base
your base looks like the floating mini lammas from the fantastic beast, I love it
Why do you put the copper in that grid pattern wouldn’t it make more sense to put it in one big thing to use less space?
I was thinking more wizard hut-ish
Digging the new montage music grian.
On a server I'm on with friends I made a 5 layer obsidian box and spawned over a hundred golems for the wither fight. Over in a few seconds and I didn't do a thing
Impulse did the golem trick
Intresting Shoe you built as a starter base😉
make ianxofour's wither skeleton farm that requires no spawn proofing
Tip put string on top of warped vines to stop there growing
I think this is the first time I've heard grian say sus 11:19
Is grian now the little old lady that lives in a shoe
69 Likes; Nice
Anyone else think the new build looks a bit like a duck? It just needs a bill...
Grian we’re also proud you did the back ;).
Grian labeling!??!?!?!
Also Grian be getting math with that pi
Who replaced Grian with someone who can sort items?
I've seen one other youtuber using iron golem
In minecraft I am VERY carrot and potato heavy
Griand should start a mimecraft mythbusters, like i have heard that copper oxidize faster when under water
Y'know I just got an idea- next season, you and Mumbo could make giant versions of each other and be each other's houses.
I think I am more amazed that it has a back
Blast smelting ur copper mate
I love how Grian’s base looks like a shoe
Grian… golems are expensive. Making an obsidian platform under the end exit portal isn't.
You said we'd be proud of you for organizing your storage, and I am, but I'm also really proud that you did the backside :)
am i the only one who sees Grian's house as a cat?
Is it just me or are you more proud that the base has a back Lol
You might know him. ImpulseSV killed a Wither with like 30 iron golems in HARDCORE.
Correct me if I"m wrong but doesn't 1.18 have the pouches thing from rabbit hides?
Oh my HES TURNING INTO AN ORGANIZED FREAK  GRAIN IM THERE DOOONNTT
fully oxidized copper is definitely the prettiest block in minecraft
So we've upgraded from living in a rock, to living in a shoe!
16:38 "Grian's Apothecary", what do you think?
bruh, Grian is making Gravity Falls season 3
The prank war s6. The turf war s7. The tree war s8. … the prison wall war s9.
Is the boulder the moon that fell in the end of last season?
I'm secretly hoping mumbo just keeps waxing your copper wall
Scar 2022: there are zombies in my tree!
The starter house looks like a dog with a wizard hat
You should say to goodtimewithscar I caught you red handed
that mlg water at the beginning was so awesome!!!
the starter house looks a LOT like the one from season 8
7:29 Joehills saying "congratz" when scar got [spooky scary skeletons] was the cutest thing
Not going to lie but ur house kinda looks like bdub's starter house from S7
This is one of the most peaceful starts to a hermitcraft series. “Te he bouldor”
with the build limit so high now i bet you could do a cool water bucket parkour challenge
you should sell beacons because you found a way to farm withers
WHO IS badtimwithscar
Let’s see how long grian stays organized
Grian fights the all mighty Boulder with magic
The starter house is a boot
I've never seen this before.
Does anyone know anything about what’s happening with etho?
Well…Grian is now living inside of a big dog house.
I may have too much fantasy, but for some reason the storage house looks like a goose 😅
You can wax all your copper at once in a crafting table with honey
0:03 how dare you thats so rude
Can u bilud a giant statue of u or a a statue in general matey a saute of mumbo
11:24 super sus
Something that i dont think people, including Grian, are using enough is building with fresh copper as part of their build and *just letting it age naturally and slowly like actual copper metal would*. As slow as it may be, and even if the tone isnt exactly what youre looking for colour wise, it adds a sense of time and age to your build and shows change in what are otherwise static unchanging monoliths in a game that doesnt let your creations age or falter
Grain never fails to entertain me
What about the iron that they lost from the iroom golems
I am surprised grian hasn't just built a house out of chests for simplicity sake
The only reason the wither didn't spawn in scars base is because you placed the last head in a different position. The torch had nothing to do it. so that was a CLOSE one
Spawn the wither with a warden or multiple withers lol
Entity 2 boulder boogaloo
Grian calling (putter) Put-uh justifies how British he is (I would call (putter) (Pud-der) In american english tt becomes a d sound
Well done for 1st on trending 😄
Grian is chaos incarnate and I LIVE for it! XD I hope one day my own channel will be big enough to get to play with these guys. <3
Yay! Another video from lord Grian Dreamslayer!
I see potential lore
you’ll have like a week before tango takes over the market entirely lol
Amazing job
sell mending villagers
These mini building tutorials are incredible
the chest monster… its RETURNED  *dun dun DUNNN*
Impulse has already a Raid farm with 5 Raids simultaneously
14:56 not gunna lie, u bamboozled me twice here... I THOUGHT U WERE GUNNA SAY YOU DID THE BACK OF THE BASE XD
Is it just me or does it look like a magic cat
To be honest I'm actually more proud of you cause you did the back 🤣
scar having a heartattack over the wither is hilarious
Grian: “Why has nobody else used Iron Golems to fight the Wither?” Also Grian: *Watches LDShadowLady try to use an Iron Golem to fight a wither in the 100 Hours Hardcore series*
Grian is now an old lady living in a shoe.
15:00 I was 300% sure he would say "I made a back of it!"
I’ve got an idea for a shop        The g airplane ✈️
Me thinking that the thing we'd be most proud of about the starter base is that there's a back
killing wither with 5 golems is very expensive. It is easier to kill wither yourself instead of getting 180 iron bars.
I thought the base was an elf shoe at first lol
Nice History for your build - well done
I’m just proud he did the back
Prediction: By the end of the season, Grian will be *enormous* due to the exclusive consumption of pumpkin pie
Grian: I’m gunna sell copper  Tango:I’m gunna ruin this whole man’s career
Grian shouldn't be a youtuber, he should be an interior designer.
Grian refuses to live in the testacle, smart move.
Did anybody else notice that one of grain’s chest labels said logs 2: electric boogaloo
Grian now lives in an elf boot. It even has the little bell off the toe curl.
when he said we were gonna be proud of him, I thought he was gonna say how he finished the back of it.
i thought the house was like a dog with a hat
Why are you a pie guy now? It's because you're pious! (read pie-ous)
copper....im so sorry grian...have you seen Tangos farm
I like how your teaching us building tips while building your starter base
yay he's finally organizing stuff!
I miss the random junk everywhere
hair
tbh i was more impressed your hoyse had a back
“I’ve spoken to *Scar* for a *Good* amount of *Time* ”
Epic
Actually what I was proud of was that you made a back
i feel like a proud father
Your house looks like a dog
You don't need a starter base to me it already is one a bed in the middle of a chest monster
Damn grian organized
JAHITA did it
The starter base looks kinda reminds me of the home from The Old Women in The Shoe story.
every time i watch grian i feel like i’m watching jamie oliver teaching me minecraft the way he explains things
Few kill the wither on Java with golems because its expensive and its a ton easier to just trap it in bedrock.
Grain did a lmg when he jumped down the copper pillar
Put looting 3 on your sword and the wither process will go by fast
it looks like a boot
Boot
What a revolting house.
Grain, don’t sell copper. Have you seen tango’s copper farm. If you really want to, try to make a deal with tango.
Holy smokes, Grian... there's a BACK on this base! I can bsrely stand it. What do we do? Do we... send you ham? Or money? Or what? What do we do in this situation?
Iron golems were used in a hermit craft season before, forgot which one but they had a whole array of golems set up to fight a few withers
There once was a grian that lived in a shoe lol nice build man looks amazing
I have been watching for 2 years thanks for the great content grian :)
logs 2 electric boogaloo
You're a Pie Guy? Oh, if only you had posted two days earlier...
to get revenge this time, mumbo is just gonna wax all of the copper
If you don’t want to make a starter base, make a small living space or house that can be easily expanded on, but still looks good on its own. Then just keep adding on and on to it until it’s a huge mega base
That Timelapse music sounds like something Scar would use  (If he has used it I’m sorry I haven’t watched him in a while 😭)
the house looks a little like a boot
Ah yes. First we've got a boulder (a really fancy one I must say). Now we've got the shoe. Very nice. Loved the episode G-man! Tysm!
that's the season 8 house dummy
not me thinking Grian's "starter" base looks like an elf shoe  lol
When he says look what I did. Did anyone else expect him to show us the back?
Your starter House is like a shoe.
I wonder if you guys can rope Mumbo into helping build the farm too.
Dispite making a short on how the iron golems wreck the wither he was saying how he didn’t think they attack the wither?!?
A tip with copper: If oxidized copper is connected to less oxidized copper, the less oxidized copper will oxidize MUCH faster. Better to make a giant copper block than to spread out all the copper. (Or a giant square if you want to remove copper at certain states.) One part gets oxidized and the rest matches the oxidation state very quickly.
Really appreciated the interior tips and tricks segment
No one does this because they use iron blocks for the beacon
Grian! Shulker farm buddy. Thats the real money. Gotta make mumbo the poorest hermit... Again.
Grian is living i a boot 👢
Logs 2 electric boogaloo 15:24
It'd be cool if you made like a big cave entrance under your house that you could boat/fly into :o
I thought we were gonna be proud that he did the back..
I thought Grian  had a lot of copper! But he still says it’s not enough! Me HOW IS THAT NOT ENOUGH YOU MUST BE SELLING 1000 BLOCKS  (if you take this as hate it was not intended as hate just a joke)
Its funy to me there starter base is my like full monts worth of work permant base
Green  there is  This is one of the most used things I just don't think you've seen people do it a lot
Pooder 💀
Grian: I’m a pie guy  Me: sees 31 cooked pork chops
What is with you and your starter bases and  always having to be with magic or something like that 🤣🤣🤣
OMG its only episode 3 and you already have SO MUCH
at 14:58 when you were saying to look at this I thought that you were gonna show us that you finally finished the back of a build
Love the colour pallet, however Scar is right "it looks like a Cat in a Hat"
am i the only one who sees grian's hair in copper ore? I'm sorry if you cant
He said he doesn’t know if iron golems kill the wither but the video before this shows iron golems killling the wither
I was so surprised when Grian MLG water at the start
I've seen ImpulseSV use Iron Golums to kill a Wither b4.
Bruh. People use iron golems to defeat the wither all the time tho lol
Ohh you have not seen the bedrock wither nothing can stop that thing
The amount of stuff the Hermits DON'T know about Minecraft baffles me 😂  Like not knowing Golems Attack the Wither
People don’t beat the wither with golems because there is a way to trap it under the bedrock in the end and make it so it can’t move or attack
why dose no one use several iron golems to kill the wither?  really you do realise that 90% of minecraft players dont have mega iron farms or massive quantity's of resources, its too expensive for most players to use several golems just to fight 1 mob
i love how fantasy looking most of the builds are so far
“I’m a pie guy” *pork dissappears*
I would do this but it is actually impossible to do on Bedrock Edition. Also, the Java Edition tunnel cheese strat is cheaper which is why most people just don't.
I am soooo proud, that your base has a back!!!
I like how no one heard what scar said 23:48
Best rock gremlin
Is it just me or does it look like a shoe and I can’t unsee it
One of the chests had electric boogaloo on it...
What is with scar and grian and butts this season
The base looks like a cat dressed up in a costume
I like how he has “Logs 2-Electric Boogaloo” for a hidden Easter egg from the other season.
Make the Barge an International Company
i love joehills comments
That''s a nice cat in a witch's hat you've built.
Is it just me but if you just take a quick look a grian's base it looks like a boot/ shoe. But love the base!
Grains starter house is a elf boot =/
our little boy is now a man
No the thing i was most proud of is the back... It exists
Grian I love your base but it looks like a shoe
I feel batrayd
We need Grian and scar together in mcc!
Copper is easy to find now but coal isn't as easy and it takes alot of time to smelt copper farms like False's and Tango's it comes already smelted saving tons of coal and time probably better off leaving it to them unless you wanna spend that much time to maintain stock.
so wimsickle
Grian's starter base tower looks like a goat face
I thought he was gonna say "you're gonna be proud because I finished the back!"
I wish Grian knew how easy it is to do water bucket clutches
Do all British people pronounce it Shtupid?
Grian: You are going to be very proud of me Me: Did you do the back of the base?
I don't know why, but I think I was more scared than scar was when Grian made the wither right by all the builds x-x
Beautiful house but... The little old wonan who lived in a shoe?
Grian: look look did you notice what I did this time Me: The back back of your build? Grian: I cleaned the chests up Me: Oh, huh
I love how hermits influence each others building styles
20:55 omg Grian was MegapiemanPHD this whole time I would never guess Grian could do a Markiplier impression
Wizard cat
5 golems 1 wither
Next season ALL hermits on the server should set up one single trading hall to share. would be nice to see :)
I thought that the house was inspired by Bdubs's houses from season 7
Kind of looks like season 8
If you want to make a mega base or maybe a coal/iron market I really recommend looking into Welsh slate quarries like Penrhyn quarry. The views are stunning and it would be an awesome minecraft build if it had some cool stuff in it to make it feel alive.
I think Grian is a little behind on things happening on the server? He decides to sell copper after Tango has got a mega copper farm up and running and decides to do villagers after Impulse has finished making iTrade 2.0
0:00, ow ow ow ow ow, it's ok.
Grian: "I'm exclusively a pie guy" Grian, 2 minutes later with 30 Porkchops instead of 32
Dang Grian I’m impressed with the organization! Great job! 👏👏👏
If someone ever starts selling netherite (totally not and idea at all) then they will be very rich with diamonds
I know no one asked, but I have a story for the Entity: It was just a rock, when villagers started reporting strange things popping out of the side of it. The sightings ranged from trees, to copper, to honey, with seemingly no rhyme of reason. That is, until someone found the crack. A small break in the side of the boulder soon grew to a full entrance. Inside were stocks of all the things popping up on the outside, and as the news spread, people started getting curious. And greedy. The supplies in there were worth a fortune! But of course, the Entity knew this as well. As one unfortunate soul learned, the Entity had a defense mechanism. Anyone who tried to take the goods without leaving a diamond or two payment would be swallowed by the Entity, never to be seen again. Some say this is where it gets it’s goods in the first place, but no one truly knows for sure.

Grian has descended into the madness of 3.14

jhsad
me na
It’s so funny to me when Java players just kill the wither like it’s nothing. Being a bedrock player the wither absolutely terrifies me
Who is bad times with scar? Minute 17:01
There is an easier way
He is not Grian he is Pian
Iron golems are how I farm withers too lol. Their are 2 flaws to this method but are easy to overcome. 1) the wither tends to fly above mobs attacking it, including players. Building a tunnel like this and baiting it to the golems will work for a bit, but eventually it will blow out enough ceiling that the golems cant reach. Solve this by spawning the wither in the end, under the end portal. The bedrock trap still works in 1.18 and will keep the wither at the same height. Then the 2nd problem will be easier to manage as well.  2) at a certain point iron golems will stop attacking the wither. I dont know why but they will just stand there and get blown up. They de-aggro then wont aggro again on that particular wither. This is solved by using a minimum of 3 golems. The combined damage will be enough to kill the wither before they de aggro and they will aggro the next wither as usual.
i think the only reason people don't use the Iron golem method is because the player can't get the achievement and that's alot of iron, tho that doesn't make sense because people can both have an iron farm and do the achievement once, and if anything that's genius edit- dog home- or cat home-
It looks like a duck without a bill.
who is bad times with scar
1:21 was that a Jojo's REFERENCE
That organization will not stay for long I bet
If Donk dies, I turn off channel notifications.
how did the wither not spawn when he made it at Scars place???
is the server normal or hard?
I can’t help but giggle at donk’s lil feeties!
Grian has truly gone insane, he is speaking to the rock but more importantly he is being organized.
"...yeah so as soon as you load those villages they just get eaten" Scar: "what do they taste like?"
Where's the "Gooood Byeeee"?
15:02 who are you and what did you do to Grian?
i like this idea to made a starterbase under the rock like Patrick Star :)
Zed's water bucket challenge is spreading. Next people will start using wooden pickaxes.
the tunnel and sword method is much cheaper! plu you can get it to mine deepslate!!! GRIAN MAKE A WITHER DEEPSLAPE FARM BY LURING THE WITHER TO MINE!!!!
I remember season 6 lol
Your starter base looks like a cat and last season it looked like a face lol
It's okay, Grian, people step on my face constantly. I forgive you ♡
I love your series I’ve been watching since season 6
They're your precious pies? So they are your.... PPs? I'll see myself out, I'm sorry
There's a cheaper way of killing the wither if you have already killed the ender dragon, which involves the end portal. If you arrange the soul sand with the wither's tail right below the bedrock pillar, then the wither gets stuck while the bomb skull thingies get teleported away. Just start swiping and you get completely safe wither killing, plus you get the kill stats instead of leaving it to the golem
It't not called an entity or a boulder, It's a ground pimple
OMG
Your house is a shoe
If he was standing on our face…doesn’t that mean we are on Grians face?
You and scar should make a beacon shop
We all know that storage system ain't gonna last long
Why does it look like a shoe 😂
Grian, we are all so proud of you when we saw an organized base!
I saw a video where someone set up 100 iron golems and used them to kill the wither ... the player did nothing after activating all the golems and then spawning the wither
Grian is starting with a shoe with pointy toes...looks amazing though.
Grian going full scizo
They do fight the wither but u won’t get an achievement from them fighting it.
Anyone else want to see grandma just slowly getting fat as the season goes from all the pies?
Why doesn't everyone do this? Short anwser is that its too inefficient compared to portal farming and its also too expensive when taking into considaration that you can hit him to death undergroud (in case for some reason you dont do the end portal trapping method)
14:55I thought we were gonna be proud of you doing the back-
Grian don't do that to Scar he just got OUT of the hospital.
I'm a pie guy. Lol Ren would be proud
I like how Grian won’t live in a rock but will live in a shoe
Simple Simon met a pieman Going to the fair Said Simple Simon to the pieman "Why did you surround my vault with a huge wall of copper?!"
I just swallowed a entire gusher whole:)
he lives in a boot
5:11 when you don't realize you dropped your pickaxe
These seasons are at the same time as world of Warcraft. 9th season, 9th expansion!
Just a thought for a lil trolling you should find the people who live in the snow if there are any and put a bunch of death holes covered by powered snow
Grain just later on pie did I choose to just eat pie?
nobody does it like  that because it takes a lot of iron and there are more efficient ways of doing it
grian theres no chance you see this but!.... I suggest using arrows of weakness over the splash potions. It takes 3 bottles to make 64 arrows and on an unenchanted bow deals next to no damage. 21x the bang for your buck! <3 love the wither strategy btw keep being a genius
Why does the noise at 9:47 sound like drum? I’d honestly like to see someone remix it
Im just waiting for grian big base which has no back
I'm not impressed by the storage system.  I'm impressed that it has 4 walls and a roof!
A person i have seen doing this with the wither is LTN
#1 on trending! Well done
grian is going to slowly turn orange from eating all those pumpkin pies this season
No one do the iron golem wither because there are cheesier ways and it costs a lot of iron ?
Is it just me or is that house a horse?
Im laughing because i saw the iron golem wither kill clip from Grian's shorts video before i saw this video lol
I've been using golems for years for this exact purpose. I thought y'all on hermitcraft were just flexing on the rest of us normies.
Grian, the best builder on the server is homeless
Impulse has
When is after life?
15:00 I genuinely thought he would show us the back of the base
all i can see with the starter base is a shoe lmao. It's a big ol boot.
Lol I was just glad the base had a back
Grian is living in a shoe
TBH, when Grian said ´You guys are gonna be proud of me.´ I thought he was gonna follow it up with ´I also done the back of the starter base!´ XD
Elven shoe
20:50 Grian is a Pie-ous man
The thing that impressed me the most is the ease at which the wither mines deepslate, maybe a new way of mining it
Make your starter base apart of the entity
When Grian sees tangos farm
Make a shop that only sells powders (bone meal, gunpowder, glowdust, redstone, etc) and call it Boulder's Powder's
i mean some people use golems, but honestly, with smite 5 an a strength potion you can kill the wither in 10s so why bother xD
in the best possible way the house looks like a jester boot.
Who wants to see grian have the most deaths but still be the richest hermit this season
Switch to a blast furnace it will be faster
You should check out Impulse’s hardcore series where he sicced 20 iron golems on the Wither and they ripped it apart so quickly he went and got three more skulls and did it again.
DUDE! This roof looks absolutely crazy from my perspective because im colorblind with the colors of the roof gradient so it looks amazing! I'm gonna be using that roof gradient in my builds! keep it up
Did he do the back tho
amazing job on the house I love it it looks a lot like rekrap2s copper house see the video if you wanna but I love the house amazing videos grian keep up the amazing work I love hermit craft
Theory: The entity is a part of the moon in season 8
Grian, I have a suggestion so I think the boulder should have a purple tree in the middle with light shining down the middle and a path way from the from to the back which is a library and the sides should be a small village for elf's
You have to mine with a wither just like how you were leading toward the iron golems then just do that without golems and keep going until it dies (YOU HAVE TO DO THIS PLEASE)
I love how Grian decides to get a beacon instead of ELYTRA.
Well then; this explains the short a day or two ago.
Just grian trying to start a war for the 3rd time this season already
I think there was a wither farm in season 7 that someone built that used iron golems
When he doesn’t use a blast furnace to smelt the copper quicker -justGrianthings
Grian thinking nobody does this is so cute. Every server I've been on, they just spawn the wither in their iron farm after making it's walls out of obsidian instead. But yes, Grian. Iron golemns are indeed effective.
Hey grian… you made a train and a boat as a shop…   What about planes? Mayb?😮
He’s organizing..THE WORLD IS ENDING
the new timelapse music reminds me of the FNaF security breach elevator music
the shoe  i call that house the shoe
Ah, so this is what inspired that short
I’m a person who loves consistency, grian messing with mumbo every single season he has been in is the best kind
and grain may have just saved a bunch of hardcore worlds
Grian is "The old lady who lived in a shoe."
Now that it's organized will Grian keep at it
Maybe just start a beacon farm/shop!
Make a giant telescope coming out the top pointing at the rock
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH GRIAN, GRIAN IS NEVER THIS ORGANIZED.  (But yes i am proud your getting more organized.)
MANNNN I wish the episode was longer!  I really wanted to see the start of the villager project
dude i just got a add saying to buy this feal in vr thing, it's the fucking matrix
Anyone else get some old lady that lived in a shoe vibes? To me the starter base looks like a fancy boot with a sock sticking out
I thought when he told us that he decorated that he was going to tell us that he did the back hahah
grian: getting exited to show us somthing me: hoping thats he has finished the back grian: look a labeled chest
I love minecraft, and usually watch the hermits while I play so I feel like my single player world is multiplayer- otherwise I lose motivation and get intimidated by my vision of what I want to do in game
THINK OF POODER! it's 'Putter' ITS POODER!
Not going to lie thought your house was a shoe for a second
you should've lived in one of the structures that you build on top of the entity  also, did you know snowballs do a lot of damage against blazes?
don't eat too many pies or you will get in-game diabetes
House look like a shoe am I right?
woman in the shoe, meet grain in the elf slipper
I'm so glad people are finding out how OP iron golems are
im getting some sahara vibes here
It took the man 3 episode to build a starter base
ldshadowlady does that thats how she died when she visited you guys on the 100 hours of minecraft series she spawned golems to fight the wither with her.
Y u step on our face :[
Why does Grian's base look like a duck?
I knew the youtube short meant something!!!!
Your videos make everything better!
Once I was so bored i destroyed an entire village neatly and made my first villager trading hall out of their old houses lol
It is .. the ugliest thing I have ever seen on Hermitcraft x)
The house looks like a wizard duck. Nice
Your constant use of walls at mumbo's is hilarious, you silly gremlin. Never change lol
I find it amusing that when the server saw he had spawned a Wither they immediately assumed it was a loose one :D
I have never seen anyone use iron golems to fight a wither before, I’ve never even thought of it myself.
14:57 i thought he was gonna show us the back 😭
Why the world border on season 9?
Grian: This house is meant to look like something for a magician, or alchemist, who's studying the entity over there.  Me: SHOE
Your base looks like a boot
6:40 if you keep on doing this, you might put scar back in the hospital with the amount of panic attacks you’re giving him
Oh my gosh he actually organized and labeled everything. I never thought I'd see the day.
grian to heal zombie villagers use lingering potions because you can heal more than one villager with one potion! This is the most efficient way. The potion will stay there while you get more villagers!
Make a villager trading post for everyone to use, but every trade cost ____ diamonds.
I love It ❤️❤️ You make the best hermit craft episodes!!
Good job Grian on the organization! 😁
use bees for the weather
Scars about to put the last wither skull on the soul sand. Then A DANG LONG AD COMES IN. Me: OH CMON
GRIAN: I want my builds to tell a story MY BRAIN: Empires?????
So proud of you for organizing, Grian 👏🏼
shoe
SIr that building is a cat with a witchs hat
watch yuma or whoever the instagram person is get a ton more followers xD
GRIAN HAS A STORAGE SYSTEM!!! Never new Grian could do such a thing!
Grian's house looks like a shoe
this cannot be the real grian, it has to be grain.
Your starter base looks like a lama
Soooooo are we just gonna ignore that he stole the wither thing from impulse?
Somehow never killed the wither before...I know what I'm doing tonight
I loved how you showed your design process for the interior. I'm trying to become a better builder, and you don't post many building videos anymore. Super helpful!
Put a beak on your starter house and BOOM you got a duck
Imagine this wither strategy but with wardens
when Grain was telling everyone that we would be proud of him around 15:00, I thought he was going to show us the finished back...
The amount of pie… such a pieous man…
“Starter”
Why don't you make a large base that is near your shop? Like it can be a mountain and your shop rolled off?
tag 3: penalty fee? Every time you are tagged you pay a diamond to the tagger?
I am proud because he made the back xD
tango used iron golems to defeat the wither in previous seasons pretty sure
8:49
And make your beer sour
am i the only one that thinks grians new base look like a unicorn
Watch out for scar he’s an elf he’ll kill you
Yeah, you should really check out Impulse's hardcore series. Iron Golems, been there done that. Lol
I think you deserve every single subscriber for the MLG bucket
Grian we want the original time-lapse music from JONO
got to say grain if you keep this storage up ill be right impressed
i think they don't do it much because theirs more cheese ways to do it, like trap it on badrock or drop point stones on it
You should invite fwhip to the next season
I miss the old grian building music bring it back!
I don't think iron golem will work on bedrock wither.......
Organized grian??? WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT DID YOU DO WITH GRIAN!!!
Friend  ... your amalgam can be your home  just add another Piece to it! or go underground.   Maybe a house off the side .. because its your shop charge 1 item = 5 diamon block for everything in your house so if some one wanted to grief they would pay the price.
Well grian bundles would fix your problem with building your roof.
scar did say it wrong, what he said would be spelled puter or pewter. not putter.
Grian: Clearly its a wizard hut. Me: So Grian was the old women who lived in a shoe, got it
backs of buildings and organization?  what did you do with the real Grian?
Impulsesv did this a few weeks ago
Who's gonna tell Grian that Tango made a copper farm
Impulse did
house looks like a duck
I thort people know that iron golems was a easy way to kill the Wither
Anyone think he sounded like bob ross when he was making the interior of the house
Hey Grian, you probably won’t see this but I have a suggestion for this season. I would love to see you interact with some of the other hermits that you don’t usually meet with, not just scar and mumbo. I love your content anyway but just a suggestion, thanks.
I feel like it is illegal to see grian’s storage system sorted.
sure just waste 10 stacks of iron on one wither when you can kill it with like 15 smite 5 hits and one strength potion
20:30  the next war on hermitcraft will be PORK vs PIES
I had an idea for the truth behind the Entity, it's basically a living rock, so biologically, that's pretty odd in Earth standards. So I have brainstormed about the biochemistry of the boulder, and I wanted to share it, c'mon, Grian could even see this somehow, and I wanted to know what y'all think. So the Entity could be a silicon-based lifeform, which means it can't exist like a normal motile animal in oxygen rich environments, so the best there is for Earth like environments would be a lifeform that looks like a boulder, now why is that? When silicon is found with oxygen, it reacts to create various silicon oxides, which are rocky crystals, so the boulder could use the oxygen from the atmosphere to create an outer rocky shell composed of several silicates and quartzes, both are present in most rocks on Earth so a normal looking boulder is just right, it could also use oxygen to protect their internal organs, like it's heart, which is a conduit, that kinda has something of an outer shell. As for ways of obtaining energy, it could use chemotrophy, chemotrophy is the process of oxidizing several metals to obtain energy, this kind of bioenergetic process is most found in deep sea trenches around hydrothermal vents, but the boulder is in the surface, so what could happen is that the entity stretches specialized roots all over the land to sustain it's needs for metals, eventually stretching over to volcanically active places to get more energy, another solution would be to use phototrophy of some sorts, having specialized pigments beneath thin rocky layers from their shell to absorb the sun's energy somehow, and perhaps even having a kind of mutualistic relationships with the plants that grow on it, the plants provide carbon and nitrogen so it can breathe better as plants are more well adapted to it, as well as extra sunlight, and the entity could provide free nutrients from their shell and no competition with other plants. So that's what I have until now, what do y'all think about it, it probably has some things that could be better but rn this is the best I have! So anyway that was a great video and all- and I'm also imagining all the kinds of different themes the village could take! This Gon be awesome, season 9 is certainly starting with the right foot
watching this with a pot noodle, im quite happy here fella's
when you tower up with the ores do two pillars at a time lol, its faster
That storage is not going to stay organized, I say episode 5 he runs it
Grians a pie addict now
Grain: ...Magician...  Me see a boot 👢 🤣
You need a giant telescope pointed at the entity
Taurtis is back!!!
GRIAN DOES NOT ORGANIZE STUFF. I have a feeling that this is not grian. I think this is the guy from "100 hours in hardcore Minecraft".
Looks like you've taken some build inspiration from Fwhip
Grian, for a casual player iron golems are expensive to make...
youre toes arent safe from me
Grian : wonders why nobody uses iron golems to kill the wither.  Also Grian : proceeds to waste 24 iron blocks while asking the question.
And you did i the back of your bace
its true, just 2 golems beats the wither
grian earlier in the series : i wont make a starter base i am going to crack down on the big base  grian now: builds starter house
I thought it was a Shoe
This guy is the Bob Ross of minecraft
its all OREganized
Maybe you could build a fancy tent next to the elven village?
pssst…bring…back……………….poultry…man
What you could do with the bottom part is make it open and decorate the inside to make it look like a lush cave, it would help you explore with more colors
I’m impressed your builds now have back walls
I see that house and it looks great but I can't stop thinking about putting a beak on the tower to make it a duck with a wizard hat
anyone else think Giran's new house looks like a goat wearing a witch costume?
I would love it if Grian would 1 on 1 teach me to build
20:56 ayo hold up
Looks like a small dog
Tag this season could be called like “Ah-Tag” so when ur tagged you have to say AHA the whole time like from Last Life.
Grian : you will be proud that I did storage  No no grian we are proud you did the back
"Sorry for stomping on your face" Actually I li... NO!
bring it in bring it in i thought he was singing Encanto
Impulse did this with like 20 iron golems
hes insane
Are we sure this is the grian we know and love
Kinda
does anyone else think the base looks a bit like a dog with a wizards hat on?
Grian starter 8 build looks like the 9 build so G HOUSE 2.O
Grian : the type of Minecrafter to get enchanted diamond gear, a beacon and netherite before building a started base
I’m just proud he finished the back. Well done Grian 😀
On a friend's server we set up a Wither Killing Machine where we built an iron farm over a big hole in the ground and make them fight the wither at the bottom and then just restock the golems when they die
15:13 mumbo is proud
I'm not proud about the chests, I'm proud about the back
Buy iskall85 golden carrots
Stampy liking cake for whatever reason:  🍰 Grain liking pie for whatever reason:🥧
at 15:00 i thought he was gonna say "there's a back!" lmao
You should use a blast furnace for the copper
Wadzee killed the wither with 100 golums
15:39 no one tell him the definition of homely
*Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo*
Grian, dont enter the copper business tango has made a farm that has ridiculous drowned spawns
Hey Grian, I don't know if you already know this or not, but you can actually apply wax to the copper in your inventory without needing to place it. Also, if you wax the copper blocks before turning them into cut copper blocks or stairs the resulting cut copper will also already be waxed, which should end up saving you wax. Might make building with copper slightly less annoying in the future.
Me when Grian's videos end:  😟
Grian copper oxidises faster next to each other
Magic Shoe Base 🙃🙃🙃
11:42 ඞ
I love your videos!
Living under a rock is just not a good idea. Zedeph: 😑
That house looks great, and it looks like a cat wearing a hat
Lingering splash potions of strength on the golems
the house lokes like a realy big shoe that belonged to an elf
That storage system is gonna look so messy in like 3 episodes max
I feel like maybe the reason more people don't use iron golems against the wither is because for it to work, you need to summon the wither underground to keep it from flying away...  But if you spawn the wither in an enclosed space you can just cheese the wither fight without the golems.
I hope he brings back poultry man
When Grian had everything labeled I was like who are u and what have you done to the best YouTuber ever?
You can increase the amount of copper blocks (4 times) by using the stonecutter.
Grian: "I can't believe no one else has thought to cheese the wither with golems."  ImpulseSV: "For more information, check out my hardcore series right before season 9 started where 'I' fought the wither twice without landing a single hit in an entire episode, but an army of golems might have helped!"
I literally thought grian said he would get a netherite beacon
I feel like you're just asking to hate yourself selling copper, especially when Tango's copper farm is going to make the competition really harsh for manually collecting after a time.
So proud of the sorted item storage
BLAST FURNACE! Why is nobody using blast furnaces to smelt their copper?!!
i like the boot
13:17 Ah.. so the Entity can speak.. We must watch it closely. It may Decide to move next.
I feel like people don't do it because its easier to just make the small tunnel longer and kill it with a sword.
I see a war. Pie eaters vs Pork eaters.
I wanna be part of a server like this but I have no friends >_<
Man is literally the old lady who lived in a shoe
This dude better be getting paid stacks for all the disney plus ads through the video
LETSS GO HZERMITCRAFT
use a blast furnace.
This is the only way I've ever killed withers.
As for why people don’t kill the wither with iron golems, its because if you want to cheese the fight to get the star, theres much cheaper ways to do it, either under the bedrock end portal, or under the roof of the nether. I know its at least Etho’s go to method
Wooo so this is it
❤️
It looks like a cat that what it is.
"Nobody does this" Everybody: 0_0
GRIAN YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOU SKIN TO LOOK LIKE A SKELETON HEAD, THEN GET YOUR HEAD AND PRANK PEOPLE TO THINK THAT YOU ARE GOING TO SPAWN THE WITHER
Am I the only one who think grain's base looks like a cat in a witches hat
make a part of the boulder that sells scar heads
This is the best day of my life Grian is organized.
Did anyone else notice that Grian's new house looks like a shoe?
An idea for the mega base is a giant ship with a bunch of supplies that can also be a bigger shop and it can be called the Barge Revamped and Invented by Grian or the B.R.I.G
I am really enjoying season 9 so far keep it up!😊
this video was posted 2 days late for pi day.
You could say he is a pieoneer
People don't use iron golems because people either suffocate the wither in bedrock, and if they don't they actually want to fight the wither
I knew you would post! I love your building a lot and it inspires me a lot. :D
Grian's timelapse music gives me Fnaf:SB vibes...   Any samers???
Grian: Why doesn’t anyone do this? Everyone: blocks of iron and pumpkins T~T not everyone can be as rich as y’all
The house look like a shoe
11:22 “sus, super sus”
prismarine and copper go great together try adding it to your gradiant
I love hermitcraft!!! :)
I had this idea that in season 10, all you guys colaborate and make one ginormous base/project together. To celebrate the 10th season of Hemitcraft. Love the content. Keep it up!!
When he said we would be proud of him for….. I thought he was about to say the back of my base is made, not him saying that he cleaned up/ doesn’t have a mess
Hi
pretty sure people do use iron golems to fight the wither, its just ineffective unless the wither is trapped, and then you dont even need them because theres easier ways to cheese the fight
Pie Gang!
Your house look like a shoe
Nah, item sorters are unimportant, we're proud that you built the back of your base. lol
… pathetic. I have water clutched from the world height, down to the bottom of the world.
It looks like the old woman who lives in a shoe, shoe.
Grian i have a question. Will season 9 be as short as season 8? because it was quite short compared to other seasons, I hope its not that short again because i love hermitcraft and your videos.
Does anyone else miss the shopping district?
I’m seeing flashbacks to season 7 This organized storage isn’t gonna last long.
You have builded a clownsboot
Watching Grian so happy about the MLG bucket clutch was just really fun.
Ah yes. The old hermit who lived in a shoe.
the reason why no one uses iron golems is probably because end portal trapping is still easier. Some people want to beat it fair and square and not use portal trapping or golems. And when you have good gear the wither fight is actually not that hard (except for the bedrock gang).
Little Elf living in a giant elf shoe. Though Grian is not an elf.
The entity is apart of the moon from last session
Your the only YouTuber ever, who I watched since 2020 every video. Love you ❤️
your house sorta looks like a llama
Maybe you should put a hut in the entity!
15 min in i thought what we would be surprised about was the fact that grian  finished the back
Grian: I don’t want a starter house Also Grian: my starter house
Why are you so good?
y dose grian's house look like a boot
lets make one thing clear, impulse discovered the iron golem trick first
Monday was pi day lol
You could possibly hire tango or Mumbo to build you a copper farm
This copperwall is great :D There have been suspicions about what you're up to. I don't know why, but this episode feels a lot more Grian to me, than the last two. Those where great to, but this has more of the vibe I'm used to. And I love that Scar tried to steal your copper :D He's learning well from all the time with you :D
Onceler vibes
Imagine an entire series of grain's building tips and tricks. I would pay for that
:0
Your base is not facing the entity, the river (and everyone else), or even Scar. You should ask Pearl to help you rotate it.
i dont like the warped stem but other then that I like it
Your base SO looks like a season 8 bdubs shop design
your house kinda looks the house from encanto (the movie) ngl, grian - acidicus
people dont do the golem method becuase you can just spawn him at the nether roof and he cant attack you or move and you can save a bunch of iron
I am proud
People don’t use iron golems against the wither because it’s so easy to beat. And iron is expensive. Just putting it in a stripmine makes it completely unable to attack you. Why would you use stacks of iron if you can just use any sword + at least iron armor and you have it.  If you have the resources to get 3 heads, the wither is easily beatable.
Please give the duck a bill
Im sorry grian, but it looks like last season's house
9:54 you can just make a tunnel and hit it without taking damage
vinnicius13 did the iron golem thingy
it's a cat with a hat, that just puked furball (entity)
Grian is poultry man
Yes destroy the elf home
I've been killing the Wither like that for years, on Bedrock they're lethal.
Great job on the house! Idea: maybe you could have a scientist grian skin on for the season? Love your idea for a background story. Also if your selling copper, maybe sell honey too for oxidation?
I think the reason you don’t see people using golems to kill the wither is because they were expensive until recently now that you are able to easily surface mine iron en masse. Before that, you needed an iron farm to make it viable, and at that point you can probably beat it without needing them.
"it spoke to me" who wants to bet this'll become a running gag?
Tbh I thoughts it looked like something out of a Doctor Seuss book 🤣
Hey Grian your new starter base looks like a elf’s  shoe
The tower shall become your bedroom with a desk in front of a window
Your labels will not work for long
No one does it because it costs a lot of iron
Replace your furnaces with blast furnaces. It’ll save you lots of time and fuel
“Why does nobody do this?” Because you just saw how easy it was to just hit the thing when you’re fighting it underground!
Please make the villager trading hall look like the Emerald City of Oz
He really jumped off that copper pillar before even equipping the water bucket, what a legend
16:56  Grian's Inner Interior Designer awakens!
16:57 bad times with scar huh
The house looks like a shoe
If you lower ur render distance to the lowest it will go thing in the nether will spawn more often including wither skeletons
"the Entity" Rock. and "Boot" laboratory.
Ight so if yall doin elf themed houses who's gonna make the elf castle mega base
I love the starter base, and I love that I cannot unsee the giant ice cream cone dropped on top of it!!
U could switch out The lanterns in your starter base with soul lanterns, it would fit in better. Also well done fore building a back for ur base.
I guess you finished making this and then made that short lol
I vibe with Scar energy… Every bit of it…..
grian please, if you are going to be breaking heads of any kind, use an axe, not a pickaxe.
3899th
Now grain has entity and a boot near it:)
i love watching you during hermitcraft grian. keep up the good work 👍
Grian: "I'm going to sell copper" Me: "...And then there's Tango!"
Don't eat too much pie or you will turn into one 😉
My man living in a shoe, still a great build though
I like Pi too
Grian: why doesn't anyone use golems? Everyone: eh lots of iron for a few minutes of time?
Your house reminded me of 'The shrew in a shoe' and I found that funny
Nice vid
The Joy Of Building With Grian, as relaxing as painting
Is a pie ti the face your new weapon of choice
collect the heads of everybody on the server and use them to decorate your storage room.
Alternate title: Hermitcraft S9 E12: Interior Design
the beginning of this video has me feeling like the i in pixar
9:57 Because thats a waste of iron?  You can cheese him underground for free (like he did to lure him to the golems)
When he said you’re gonna be so proud of me, I was like you built the back of the base?
When you first show the starter base, it looks like an angry duck in a hat without the bill. Just putting it out there.
Grain should Heal the iron golems by right clicking with iron on them so he could reuse these golems for future wither fights instead of making more iron blocks for golems since it costs more resources and time
Poor Joe in the chat trying to figure out if he’s about to be killed by the wither
Kinda wanna see mumbo react to Grian being organised. I suspect it will not compute.
You guys are my favorite minecraft youtubers
Well in mate       Your doing really well
I personally don't use iron golems for the wither since it's way cheaper and still very easy to just beat by making a branch mine and just going up to hit then stepping back and so on Just like Groan did for a bit
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH GRIAN!?!?! HE WOULD NEVER MAKE A STORAGE ROOM! MUCH LESS LABLE THINGS!
I feel like mumbo is just gonna wax the copper
Grian you can shear the top of your warped vine and it won’t grow any higher
Grian is like your all gonna proud of me for organizing. Me over just proud of him for doing the back for once😂
I’m proud of you, Grian. -Inspiration Grandpa
15:42 did you just summon dark oak trapdoors from the either?!?
The entity should be a snail :/
Did you know that you can wax copper through crafting? Might be a helpful fact for you.
Grian: Considers joining Scar's elf community My brain: *Grelf*
Why does your storage base look like a cat with wizard hat on?
6:56 imagine a missclick
"Logs 2: electric boogaloo" Lol
How you showed the interior of the house and how you went about decorating it and giving tips for it is exactly what I’ve been wanting to see in your videos because I always like to hear new tips from someone who is really great at building like yourself. Please put more moments like these in your videos!
I miss the old Hermitcraft where there was a shopping district and basses were spread out and there was no border
Grian and scar spawning the wither   the chat: FUK FUK FUK
Am I the only one who's reminded of the story of the lady who lived in a boot by grians starter base
I'm calling it right now! the entity will be the end of season 9
🥧🥮+Grian= Prian
Finnish YouTuber, Lakko did that thing with the iron golems.
when i heard grian say you will be surprise i thought he was talking about the back
Grian You should just go to the end and spawn the wither under the portal
Griandalf the Grey
That is a boot. You're now the little old lady who lives in a shoe
I thought he was going to say he finished the back of t he base.
your starter base looks like a llama with a witch hat. :3
I was wondering why grian posted that iron golem vs wither short earlier this week also, I am proud that grain did the back
Why not make the tradinghall village themed?
"Living under a rock isnt always a goodthing" Patrick- And I took that personally
IDEA you could advertise other peoples businesses in the entity
you should try mining with a wither…make a long tunnel and get it to follow you for a while
Nobody uses iron golems to kill the Wither because it's too expensive for early game, unless you're a Hermit of course, and you simply don't really need them to kill it in late game.
Oh my goodness, you are so close to 8 million subscribers. An early congratulations 🎉🎉
Grian I loves the part where you kinda went tutorial-y when going through the interior. If you could do that a bit more often i would be so happy
Why do i think of a shoe when I see this building. Like that of a jester from medievil times. Dunno. Now you probably can't unsee it.
I was honestly hoping Grian was gonna live under the rock, but the storage not so starter house is cool!
Hey i just thought. Why dont you vain mine with a wither? It worked, and you barley took damage. I would try at least😁
That starter base might genuinely be my favourite of all your builds, the shape and colours really stand out
Grain: Im going to sell copper  Tango: Am I a joke to you?
seeing grian have an organized storage system for the first time ever... I just want to say I am so proud of you 🥲
0:1 Ouch hey ow hey ow STOP
If you watched the short, then you would know about the wither trick.
there was a small Grian who lived in a boot
The fact that Scar said "I wouldnt put it past you" is hilarious because im pretty sure if the situation was funny enough Grian definitely would 💀
Yay, labels
The days when grian mumbo and iskal created Sahara was my fav hermitcradt memory 😩
You are such a great builder, I have been watching you since you made those pet houses😄
You should add a telescope facing the entity to your base. Just an Idea
Should keep the green curve/spiral things on the roof pointing in different directions
Did anybody else notice that after he said that he was a pie guy the next clip you can see he ate a pork chop, it went from 32 to 31.
Grian:  I'm a pie guy...  Proceeds to eat pork chop
It looks like you ate some of the pork chops
Scar really is good at the mog water bucket.
Your base reminds me of your Hermitcraft 8 base
Great starter base, cannot help but say it looks like a shoe or a boot
The "Log 2 Electric Boogaloo" sign 😂
You should use pistons to make the bolder breath
19:22 i think we all need space 😔
5:55 Obi-Wan Kenobi
5:55 “Well hello there” -GoodTimeWithScar 2022
Is anyone gonna comment on the chest labeled "Logs 2 Electric Boogaloo"
15:20 I was expecting u to say that u finished the back of ur build not the organization 💀😭
The gradient of copper works very well with acacia and warped nyleum!
you could say he's a pieneer           please laugh this took me 10 mins to find how to type pioneer
The curves on your house remind me of the Loch Ness Monster
The reason why people don't usually use golem to kill the wither is because you could just mine a long tunnel and use that to kill the wither
The starter base looks like an elf boot
“I’m a pie guy” - Grian, suspiciously close to pi day
I’m so proud of you you are organized and have a back
Grain, wadzee did the iron golem thing first
He does know Tango has a farm that does thousands of copper per hour, right? LOL
...does Scar know what "pooter" means? XD
Hour 3 3.7k comments
Am I the only one who extremely wants another return of pultry man
he did the impossible, he organized. also ive seen the way you killed the wither on a friends server, but its pretty rare and people dont like wasting iron on golems for that, and the video was awesome!
15:44 how he do that
supa sus
1:100 odds the labeled chests will be all mixed up by ep 10
love the elf shoe its on point
You can also trap the wither under the center of the end and kill it almost immediately without it escaping (if you do it correctly)
Grian 8:00 it's too expensive
i'll give grian a month before he build a new chest monster lol
"I'm a pie guy." Grian 2022
After seeing Tango farm. I’m sure Tango is going to capitalize this market and then comes grian manually mining copper and said I’m gonna sell copper.
Yes grian, we’re very proud of you for organizing
Grian you should add moss to your collection of selling stuff because Mumbo is adding moss to your boulder, would be a nice reverse card
it's a shoe. he's living in a giant shoe!
What im really proud of youre starter base it that you FINALLY MADE THE BACK CONGRATULATIONS
Idea:use soul lanterns as it goes with the colour scheme nice not eating pork ☪️🙏🏼 bihsmila
Pearls base got yassified like crazy
bees, ever killed the wither with bees?
The fact that you can get over 50k likes in just 3 hours is amazing!! Love your videos Grian!!!
You said the entity was going to be made out of what it sells, it’s literally a boulder and you don’t sell Stone 😂😂 Sort it out with a generator, no one has built one yet
im more impressed that the starter base has a back XD
Guessing these two don’t adventure under the end portal and see the wither Vs golem farms often. Season 7 had one with lamps shop.
i thought you said you were gonna live in the entity
I think it’d be really cool if you turned the lantern hook around on the tower segment, because when they’re both pointing the same direction I feel like it gives Viking/animalistic vibes, whereas if they faced inward it’d give more magician/camp vibes
15:16 i wonder how long it will stay like this. I think it will last a maximum of two episodes 😂
I love the way kerallis says your name lol
I would recommend you watching Tangos episode before settling on selling copper 😅
Its a weird Santa Clause Shoe ... and love it :D
Whenever grian places those heads my anxiety goes through the roof
HOLY SH*T GRIAN IS USING A GOSHDARN SORTING SYSTEM!!! 👏👏👏 🤩🤩🤩
I think Mumbo fought the wither w/ iron golems when he fought it for the first time on hermitcraft.
I had a horrible day today, this really cheered me up
Congrats on fianlly labeling items!
use the wither to farm deepslate and sell it, easy diamonds... just employ the wither
I first thought this was the “old lady in the shoe” build.
early! (ish) (earlier than i usually am)
The wither  can be used as an tunneler machine.  You spawn it where you want to begin tunnel, and have iron golems ready where you want it ending. Then you pick up all the ore it has revealed to you! and of course also the nether star! :-)
Thought he was going to say he had done the back but he has done the back and the storage system (of sorts) is this even Grain did someone kidnap the real grain
I’m honestly surprise. A Organized house, damn
The grian in the shoe
I havnt seen the full vid yet. But if you haven’t done anything on the roof area… you could do a big star telescope thingy
Fighting the wither with iron golem is too expensive
The starter house looks like it's from the storybook The Little Old Lady Who Lived in a Shoe and now I can't unsee it
I love the build so unique
I love how Grian says he is a pie guy but right when the video cuts, he went from 32 pork chops to 31 Lmao   20:53
cat with a hat
You said the entity was going to be made out of what it sells, it’s literally a boulder and you don’t sell Stone 😂😂 Sort it out with a generator, no one has built one yet
Episode 1: Big Rock  Episode 2: Tree on Rock  Episode 3: Rock House
I can’t believe you made sorted chests! So proud of you!
Does anyone else see a duck on that start base just need a yellow beak.
I should ask if scar wants to help because scar and withers are fun. Also if you don’t want the warped vine to grow you can just put string above the top
When he said that we would be proud 15:00 I thought that he was going to show the back
It’s the grain who lived in a shoe
Lorax
Moist people suffocate the wither in the end
yay
The trade hall/emerald farm should be called "The Gutenberg press" because you will be bringing cheap books to the masses
Please may you post another one. Me and my boyfriend really got into it
15:10 im more impressed that you finished the back
"Aaaaaand its all labled :)"
He actually finished the back of a base this time! Good job Grian!
"Iron golems are so overpowered" Two blocks of dirt: Oh I don't think so
Grian your gonna sell me 😱 hope I give you a lot of diamonds
I thought Grains new starter house was a shoe at first lol
Ppl dont do that bc it costs a lot of iron and because there are easier ways, like bedrocktrapping and just smacking it in a tunnel, just as easy.
Grian I'm so happy you'll make building with a story behind it, it just adds more depth and makes building way more interesting. Like how scar did it last season!
"Are the golems going to attack the wither?" Me, who saw the wither short: I am four parallel universes ahead of you
Grian, I would LOVE if you did some videos about building tips just like you did with the interior. The way you explain things is so simple yet informational, us builder noobs stuck with box houses would love it
Grian lives in a shoe....
Thank you so much grain love the vids keep it up
i am so proud of scar for not dying fighting the wither and grian for sorting
Grian, if you see this, could you please start linking the music you use in your vids? Lot of really good tunes.
U should use a wither to mine lmao
iron golem are expensive, while under the end portal is consistent
Starter base looks like a DOG!! And I love the colours  u used :)
/kill @e  oops, there goes the entity('s)
if u are going to put 3 hearts into your rock put two brains in it and make it an octopus!!!!!
I’ve never really felt the need to use golems when fighting the Java wither, only when fighting the bedrock wither lol
You do know that copper ages the fastest when it's 4 blocks away from another copper block, yeah?   Your wall is going to take forever to age.
i’m more proud of the fact you finished the back of it
Grian ep 3 "kills the wither Title:  my starter base
GRIAN and Scar: Goes to kill time the wither. Audience: GRIAN and Scar are using the wither to find and mine diamonds.
Im proud of you. You actually did the BACK !!
Grian went full Bob Ross didn't he
Obviously never watched Impulse.
Pretty sure some hermits have used iron golems to kill the wither with the end trick
Your house looks like an elf shoe with a bell on the toe
wadzee killed the wither like that
I love the storage building!! It reminds me of a wizards/witches tower it's so cool!!
hermitcraft is the only thing keeping my mental health together at this point lol
20:55  Grian - "I'm a pie guy."  Your inventory says otherwise.
15:13 uhmmm where did grian go???? This is not grian. OH WAIT IT MUST BE GRIEN since grian died in hardcore
16:32 I thought it looked like a llama lol
GRIAN! Just dig a long tunnel underground. Spawn the wither. Slowly back away from wither while hitting it. Its  wayyyyy easier :D :D :D
Still hitting big with the Tumblr crowd
GRIAN BEING ORGANIZED AND BUILDING THE BACK OF THE BUILD ALL IN ONE VIDEO?!!!!!!??!??!!!! MY MIND IS BLOWN AWAY
Wow lowdown clutch
Anytime Grian says “The Entity”, I feel like he’s talking about an SCP
15:01 When he said this I thought he was going to say he finished the back
Grian, you missed the obvious one, it's the house of a HEDGE WIZARD!
hi grain nice to see you doing well
Why are hermits' starter bases better than everything I've ever built?
20:51 Grian: “I don’t know why I am so pie heavy? But, that’s who I am now. I’m a pie guy!”  Me: “It’s about the principle!!”  Well, probably not. :p
Rens pie marketing has proven to be successful haha
Nobody trusts grian with withers anymore after last season lmao
GRIAN HES GONNA WAX YOUR COPPER WALL!!!
impulse uses golems
5:31  Grian is doing it the short was made for this!!!
looks like a house made out of a giant boot, which is good and fits a fairytale type theme which matches well enough with Scars fantasy Elf tree.
As soon as grian said he was gonna live in the entity, I could just picture mumbo making the pun “grian, have you been living under a rock?”
Bring back poultry man!!!
Me when labeled everything      OoO  —o— OoO
Add a sword going trough it
If you build the wither under the end portal on dragon island you can make him get stuck and then with a full room of iron golems it’s just free beacons.  This has been a thing for a few years…  But I like your way too Grian, you innocent pumpkin you :3
I thought he was proud for making the back... this time.
Are you aloud to put your base in scar’s tree? I think it would be interested
daddy Grian
Your starter house looks like a shoe
Lolz Go away ijevin, nobody wants your porkchops. Rendogs pies and Iskalls mushy bananas 🍌 forvever!
The first season you try and live in your shop you can’t do it XD
Pi day was two days ago… saddd
Grian season 6: WAR! Grian season 7: WAR! Grian season 8: MOON CRASH! Grian season 9: "The boulder spoke to me, it dosen't want to be a house"
Please tell Scar he sounds very similar to an actor named Jeff Goldblum, especially when he said "ah, uh, you're a minecraft genius!" uncanny!
Every time Grian uploads I just feel happy and my day is getting better :) I missed hermitcraft so much <3
I really did not expect this after the short he uploaded little hours before 🙄
Going for the Druid Alchemist theme?
You should put string on vines so it doesn’t grow also love your videos!
We are also proud of you, because the back is finished!
Imagine strip mining in the nether but with the wither instead
Is it just me or does anyone else look at grains starter base and think of the owl house
I think I know why people don’t use golems to kill the wither: it’s extremely expensive
4 :13 scar got caught red handed
Is it just me or does anyone else look at grains starter base and think of the owl house
Who has the dragon egg
Please change the lantern for a soul lantern it will look way better
I love when Grian just starts roleplaying with himself, it's hilarious
Grian: can i get in on this elf village thing, that would be cool  Me: ... ✨GRELF✨
Lol your house looks like a llama with a witches hat
51K Likes in 2 HOURS GRIAN IS THE BEST!!!
the house kinda looks like a duck
The problem I have with watching Grian's videos is that I always have to back a few seconds to hear what they're saying because I'm laughing so hard
Its Not an alchemy lab, its a shoe
now I want to see a 100 withers vs 500 iron golems lol
Grians new starter base be looking like a shoe. Old lady Grian livin in her shoe🤣🤣
any other youtuber: OK GUYS AND EPISODE 100 WE FINALLY GOT NETHERITE! hermitcraft people: episode 3 wither is beaten
Okay, can’t just be me. But when Brian said we are going to be proud. I thought he was going to show us that he actually completed the back of a base
me seeing thumbnail: looks familiar
“Nobody does this” impulse and the rest of the community: “am i a joke to you?”
i think people didn't do that because the wither could bust through the stone quickly enough to not die to it, but the deepslate doesn't?
19:15 that's why we need the bundle
14:48 im gonna be honest with you, i cannot unsee it. be warned   Boot.
Anyone else think the base looks like an elf shoe??
Day 3 of calling Grians boulder an oyster.
Why does he lay out the copper blocks? What’s the point?
Every time I hear entity I think of dead by daylight lore.
pretty sure no one uses golems because its faster to crit out the wither with smite 5
"im a pie guy" cuts to next shot where he has visibly eaten a porkchop.
One finnish youtuber (lakko)  used iron golems against wither
25:30
um grian u forgot to say GOOOOD BYEEE im disapointed
I think the reason why people don’t do the iron gollum method is because there are easier ways to kill the wither quickly.
the  fact that my 3 favorite hermits all post one day off from each other is great lol, thank you!
Wadze has used iron golems to defeat the wither
Grian’s new [inhales deeply] *Magic Maaaan~!* house looks cool. 🧙‍♂️
im more impressed the base has a back tbh
Grian found in 0:00
I think most people can agree that season 6 was the best season by far (with grian in)
3618th!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Fortunatly you can subscribe if you want to
You know you're a builder when you don't have an organized inventory. 😂
Grian is the BEST!!!
When he said he had a surprise I thought he was gonna say I did the back
I feel like next episode he should make a potion on the entity and start selling potions and she should add potion affects around and a bottle of spilled regeneration
People dont use golems because you could save lots of iron by fighting him with a strength pot and good  sword
I am proud that there is a back to the base
That mlg tho
Here we have it ladies,gentlemen ,and others, a beautiful shoe house.  how classic 😌
Grian the best!!
Thier Grian!!!
TKM GRIAN MUAK
grian lives in a shoe, change my mind
NO PUEDE SER SABIA QUE IBAS A SUBIR CAP HOY JHKASBDJAH
grian is cracked at mlgs
from the side, the starter home kinda reminded me of a " jester " type of boot/shoe
I love seeing inspiring post that I've seen be used on s9 Ren also used one that I've been using for inspiration  for a house
Peanut + butter = putter? Wouldn't it be Peter?  😅
People dont do this method sins it Costs a lot of iron
Your iron golems are better and our withers are way harder -bedrock player
Your starter house kinda looks like a dog wagging its tail
Anyone who watched the short knew exactly what he was gonna do from the second he said "Beacon"
I've seen Etho use golems for withers before
I think Grian is living in a giant version of Scar's elf boots. A very nice boot.  I guess he do be really living between a rock and a hard place.
Grian I would love to see ur starter base have some type of underground tunnel/ body to the bolder and no one on the server know until you want him to break outta the ground or somthing along those lines?;) @grian
he lives in an elf boot
The base looks like a boot
I thought he was sticking to the elven theme and built a house out of a shoe
looks like a duck
Shop idea The “WEARhouse” instead of did you die boxes or anything you have a shop with premade armor and tools , you can also offer to store and move stuff for a hefty fee, mabye 80 diamonds for armor and gear and 30 diamonds per chest if stuff moved?
People don't kill wither like that because they don't have iron farmw
- grian made a starter base - the chests are sorted and labeled - there's an interior - the back is done  who is this imposter
Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo, a man of taste
Impulse has done it befor
I'm proud of the fact that it has a back :)
I made a mansion with a copper roof. I kept thinking "I have so much copper, SURELY THIS TIME WILL BE ENOUGH" Spoiler: It wasn't ever enough. So seeing that intro...I felt that pain XD
On bedrock u w ould need 10 iron golems
So glad I got a Grian episode on my birthday. Love the storage base! Maybe adding some research looking stuff outside it would convey the studying The Entity, even better?
"They set up base to study the wonderful ROCK that is the Entity." That's a geologist Grian :D Griologist
when you said we would be proud I thought you would show the back, but organization is cool too i guess
Idea: SOMEONE should set up a copper aging spot with flat land and plots for copper to age٫ have a watcher age the copper to the specified stage٫ wax the copper so it doesnt despawn anymore٫ and deliver the copper to it's rightful owner. Idk who will but someone SHOULD! That is a definite diamond making business right there. 😇
He built a starter base!
Im gonna be honest, your base looks like a jester shoe
I actually did this in a bedrock cage as a test
I love scars confidence that Grian wouldn't spawn a wither on hermit craft WHEN HES DONE IT BEFORE
Good god the wither scar interaction gave me such anxiety
14:57 thought that we would be proud of grian finishing the back of the base
Please I beg you make a blast furnace
OH MY GOD FINALLY organised chests. congratulations grian! :D
i tried the iron golem thing back in 1.12.2, but it doesnt alwasy works because it can escape if it agro's on a random mob
Hopefully bedrock brings that update were the wither is actually Killable, and Maybe as easy to kill as in Java
I give it 3 episodes until the chest monster reappears
Looks like a shoe
Lol grian everyone on hermitcraft uses golems to kill the wither
Well i always use the iron golems to get my beacons xDD
this is not the grian I know he is organized
kinda reminds me of a boot
Mumbo killed the wither with iron golens in season 2 i think
The house looks unironically  like a elf shoe
your wizard cat looks incredible 😀
the house you made looks like a dog with a hat
my god why i never thought of this ._.
Remember when lazarbeam did this. Those were the days lol
They said it wouldn’t be modded while scar has elf ears and the have proximity chat
my anxiety when you were fake placing the withers was crazy because you did it in season 8 (:
15:15 That's a first
11:24
The way Scar asked "what do they taste like?" About the villagers potentially getting eaten. 😂
Top is a bit fat needs longer tower coz, its like a bobblehead
Mumbo: Peace love and plants Grain: Peace love and pies
Grian: I'm not going to make a starter base Also Grian: makes a starter base
Grian “you’ll be proud of me for organization” Me “ I’m just happy he finished the back”
Good job you killed the chest monster 👍
I thought he was trying to congratulate himself for making the back not the chest area 😭
3:24 i wonder why doesnt he just take a shield
I just saw a box called logs 2 electric boogaloo and it just made me smile.
grian has organised storage? what the hell happened 😳
Grian for your Next build time lap music you should rickroll your viewers
Grain starts placing wither skulls me flashes back to season 8 lol and when you'd everyone on the sever started freaking out
15:06 i thought that he was gonna say that the build had a back
When he talked about him having no extra chests, I thought he was gonna talk about how he finished the back of the house
Grian:its sorted Me:That is imposible
With the precious pies chest and the entity being a rock I feel like me might become golem from lord of the rings with the fantasy theme of all the elves and magic.
I love how hie always like mak s a goal for two episodes the. Dumps it like color and that jass
Portion of hearing for your golems and potion of strength splash
Being on pe Minecraft i ALWASE use iron golems to kill the wither :D
Grian: Organised Grian every single time 5 minutes later: Chestmonster 15464654
That gradient is lovely and the design is adorable!
Use the wither to get easy deepslate and sell it
Idk why but the house makes me think of slightly of skars house on magic mountain
The perfect opportunity for Mumbo to wax some of those at random and to clean others. Too bad Mumbo seems to be incapable of being nefarious.
the house is a magical llama
I think more people use the End portal trick because it's cheaper for mass farming withers (if you have a wither skeleton farm).
Because the golems are so insanely expensive
Impulse did it
When he said “you guys are going to be so proud of me” I honestly thought he was going to show us a finished back of the base! 🤣😅
I am impressed with the back
Day 1 of asking grain to make clash Royale mini game in mc
Grian. Last season your base had a telescope, guess what happened? MOON BIG. Now with your starter base looking at the entity, this makes me think that some thing with that unassuming rock shop is going to go down.
*Sees grian smelting copper with a regular furnace*   *VISIBLE CONCERN*
something i do to oxidize a bunch of copper is place it on the roof of the nether
Love it! Before your explanation of your design idea, I got Viking Longship vibes
I wish there would be copper chains
I like the season so much. The tea shader is also very good.
Grian my mouth dropped when you said "I labeled it"
Your house looks like a platform elf shoe. I love it!
The interior tips and tricks were excellent in this video! Thanks for putting them in the video in such a natural way, I learned something without realizing it at first, haha.
I thought you were going to say was that you did the back
Religiously have to watch all gran mum I and iskall series before I check out the other channels
Well, clearly we know Grian doesn't follow Impulse.
am i crazy? didn't Grian say he wasn't gonna bother with a starter base this season?
It looks like a boot to everyone else, right?
Somebody in hermitcraft has definitely killed the wither with golem before... I think it was impulse, or mumbo? I remember those golems being given a nice place to live lol
I’ve been waiting for is forever
15:28 am I the only one that noticed the "Log 2 : electric boogaloo" ? (please call it by its full name)
Ohh I'm so excited for this villager trading project!!
Nooooo really weird cliffhanger!! D:
Grouse
You should spawn the wither in deepslate so you can harvest any that it explodes.
Grain has a living boulder shop and a shoe house. This is fairytale land in the making
i lagged during clutch, i thought he ded
Impulse killed the wither with golems first tsk tsk
Labeled for how long?
Grian, It looks like a cat with wizard hat
Grian thaught  scar had red hands because he chaught him red handed
I’ve been waiting this forever
I saw the yt shorts vid on the iron golem strat before this vid came out lol
u should call ur land the em pie er
There's a brazilian youtuber called Viníccius13 that did a wither boss farm that consists on the iron golem killing the withers
I saw people using iron golems to kill the wither on the parlamentum server a few years ago
GRIAN ORGANIZED? OMG THIS IS A RARE SIGHT
The reason don't use the iron golems bc they cost a ton
Nice waterbucket clutches (first one)
I tested iron golems vs wither
Next video: "why does nobody use the wither for mining?"
Your house is so beautiful
grian lets biuld a starter base scar whait he build a cat whit a wizarts hat
Grian, Live under the house
I’m just proud it had a back.
i always take down the wither like that
🦀
Woohoo!!!!!
I kinda love how fighting blazes sets minecrafters apart so much - some of the other hermits just jump right in with a shield and hardly any other armour and wham bam 25 rods in no time..  Grian runs in with pies and almost dies while getting.. 12 :D  Next time Grian, bring a shield.. makes blazes soooo much easier to manage!
You guys had an auto wither killer under the end portal with some iron golems in season 7
Not only did he do the backs every where, HE’S NOW ORGANIZED
Good job grian
He is finally useing signs
Can someone please make fan-art of Grian holding Scar on a leash
Lets goo
0:35 We're proud of you Grian :)
This season has been AMAZING!! The house is absolutely beautiful!!!
We use iron golems on my server
As soon as I saw the house I shouted: ITS A SHOE :D
Grian, Your house looks like a boot, You live in a shoe!
I'm more proud of the fact that he did the back, more then organization
haha! Logs 2: electric boogaloo
Wow! grian actually sorted something...
10:30 grian people actually have done it but not 1.17 or above which brought deepslate the wither would usually go up then behind before 1.17 and also deepslate is also hard to break by wither aswell so that maybe the Reason.
The Grian x hijinks card combo is going to be an incredibly strong play in Beef's HermitCraft deck-building game should be an incredibly strong play. With an elytra modifier? Shut the front door. And with Mumbo or Scar in play? Ridiculous.
Lol
Use snowballs for the blazes
i love grian's shoe!
If you watch Ethos videos he's actually been using iron golems to fight the wither for quiet some time now lol
5:33 to 5:50 he talks if iron golems, But he made a short about how to kill the wither.
for using copper when building you can simply have stacks of fully oxidised copper, and then use your axe to take them down to the oxidation level you want, and then wax. instead of having all 4 variants of copper you only need an axe, the oxidised variant and honeycomb.
20:32 Grian, I'm ashamed you missed a good joke instead of saying a "I'm a pie man" you should've said "I'm a pie guy"
Grian-dolf the red.
No Grian, what I’m proud of is that it has a back
When he said we were gonna be proud, I genuinely thought he would say: "I didn't forget to do the back!"
Did he not know Tango has a copper farm?
Why does your starter base look like a goat from one side??
To be fair, killing the wither underground is not that difficult either. It will often float at a higher height, so will not be able to shoot projectiles at you.
Grian, the reason people don't use golems to kill the withers is because the um, the End works better lol
I beat the wither in 45 seconds with some enchanted diamond gear. You don’t need iron golems.
Grian people don't use golems on the wither because it's very expensive and actually slower than most easier methods
Grian your starterchouse looks same as last season
Great work keep it up
I like the building tips! It's the way I first found your channel. Keep up the good work
I kinda thought you made a big elf-shoe house. I was gonna say Scar is really gonna love this house XD
Soooo what kind of tag are you gonna do this season
impulse used golems
3:25 if only he knew,,,, That there was a very simple,, Inexpensive recipe for an item,,,,, That could block attacks,,,,, If only
OMG 9:29 THE WITHER EXPLOSED AN EMERALD IN THE -50
I was actually proud it had a back
Splash potion of strength on the golems.
I did know about the golems, but they only work if the wither is contained - otherwise it just hovers over them and picks them off.  I found it mostly because I was just having random mobs fight in creative.  3-4 seem to be required to beat it though.
Have you seen Tangos copper farm though?
GRIAN… YOU DID THE BACK OF THE HOUSE!!!
When he said labels I thought he meant all labeled random
is it just me or does the base look like a duck with a wizard hat... I LOVE IT
I’m at 19:00 rn and I already see Mumbo is just gonna wax the copper
the storage house looks lowkey like a white-headed duck with a wizard hat
I thought you were going to say we will be proud that you did the back of it!
I’m more impressed that he finished the back in 1 episode
I LUV HERMITCRAFT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! as soon as i saw it was out i clicked on it u r so good at Minecraft Grian!
The exagerated gradient on the wall ruins it for me. I'd stick to one color or white to light gray has to not compete with the roof's color.
Such a big brain play with the iron golems, I’m gonna try on bed rock version now
Grians interieur design tutorials are back
Give it 5 episodes it will be messy
you made a video showing this a few years ago lmao
14:55 I literally thought he would show that he did the back.
Hey Grian I was just wondering how many subs you had when you joined the server. Just wondering so I know how many subs I would need to gain to be considered to join
Grian - "I'm going to sell copper!" Tango with an already insane copper farm - "Uh, no"
20:51 “Idk why I’m so…” PIEus!! Opportunity missed!! I’m disappointed Grian..
Honestly, I thought he was gonna say he did the back lol! But the fact that everything is labeled is impressive too! Good job Grian
you java players have it easy with withers we have withers with 600 health you 300 health witchers
I feel like scar's influence has gotten into you when you said that you want your build to tell a story.
I TOLD YOU HE WAS GONNA GET A BEACON
Grain has never been so organized
Why do you sheer the pumpkin and just use the normal pumpkin (is it just a bedrock thing)
A fun way to prank someone who is aging their copper is by placing a copper block under the ones that they placed so it ages slower
You can make a copper farm, shulkercraft have tutorials
My face has been stomped on D:
It would be cool if there would be a waterstream infront of the villagers to keep suppling the players inventory!  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
nice
Actually Grian, what I'm proud of is that you actually made the back of the building!
Can you spawn the wither in the nether because if so you could use it to mine/dig for acient debri?
Elf village, why not make it almost Zelda themed because they are kinda elves
I love how you blended some of your more educational content on building with hermitcraft, this format is wonderful and I hope to see more of it in the future!!!
The way the chat goes crazy when they see the advancement and health bar 😂
Funny story, i play minecraft with my 8 y.o kid and i was struggling with a Wither and he actually told me that i should use Iron Golem as allies lol
Wizard build
You know Grian what I'm even more proud of? You finishing the back!
Has anyone noticed that dark oak trap doors look like chocolate bars
Cool starter base! The gradient in the copper is really imaganative and it looks really good, butt, ik kind of looks like the shoe of a court jester😅
A comment
Evolution of grain shops Sahara: Enormous building with ungodly amount of redstone (A few diamonds profit) Barge: Big wooden raft (Stacks of diamond blocks) Rock: Rock (Rock)
The focus of this season is ROCK
I'm impressed that grian actually did the back
Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo. Hilarious.
9:56 Because Mr Grian it costs alot of iron and is very messy. We usually just dig long tunnel 2x1 with a small room for a Wither and first shoot it than we finish it with a sword.  But your way is more funny.
16:33 It looks like an old fashioned shoe shop. I mean that curve on the roof, yeah you’ll be making quite a bit of profit.
I'm proud he finished the back!
I'm just proud of the fact that the back is done 👍
When Minecraft 1.19 you guys going to try to beat the water in with Iron golems!
Mumbojumbo is growing your moss
Sorry I’m late I had a fitness test
The wither boss isn’t even scary on Java, Bedrock it’s terrifying, on Java it just feels like a chore
love the mini interior decoration tutorials :)
Your starter base looks amazing Grian!
Orgenasaiton who are you and what did you do to grian
Now try the wither fight in bedrock
Can we just appreciate the fact that he got the back done in ONE TIMELAPSE.
Grian is living in a shoe
You should work on the back of something L
Joe and other hermits.... "Should we be concerned???"
20:44 Don't pies fill up like alot of the food bar, or did that change-?
But grian is there a back?
Bro Grians base kinda looks like the shoe house from that one story book
I really thought Grian’s base was supposed to be a giant shoe at first
Is it just me or is the timelaps music remix of Deltarune 2: welcome to the city?
I can’t do it without them 😂
Scars weekends A starter house
Hey Grian please make a comically huge telescope (like you see in cartoons) just pointing straight at the entity from your "𝓢𝓽𝓪𝓻𝓽𝓮𝓻" house to show you are studying it. I think this would be hilarious
Kid you not I was doing squats right before watching this video, still have 500 to go so I'm off!
I've seen it done on hermitcraft 7.   Xb or cub or someone. Can remember who
The bace looks like a dog with a hat
HE BUILT A BOOT!
i thought he was talking about how he made the back when he said said we’ll be proud of him for something big sas
When he said you’ll be proud I thought he did the back
20:50 You misspelled Grianite.
Can I join hermicraft please? I will give you my first diamond
You make it sound like you've broken the game or something, but the Iron Golem method was literally the first way I ever killed the Wither. People doesn't do it because it's expensive and slow compared to a Wither Ender under the End Gateway.
I like how grian used the tip that he gave us by using iron golems to defeat the wwither
We all know this is never going to stay organized
That's it.  You are officially an old woman now.  💜   Living in a shoe, you are going to have to start a Mother Goose storytelling arc at this juncture. 😂  That being said, I adore this build.  It is perfect.
Am I the only one who sees an elf's shoe on the starter base or just me??
A suggestion should be the honey wall thing where it streams down on the sides of honey blocks, it’s affordable as you have a bee farm
i cant get over the fact that the house is shaped like a llama
Nice roof yumar 👍
It looks like a puppy!
14:58 i thot you'd say that we whould be proud that u did the back
i thought he was gonna say look i did the back are you proud 15:04
imagine naming your dog after a golf club
Hello
I love that you´re going to tell more of a story with your builds. I also really liked that you showed your building from various angles at the end of the time lapse! Great work!
Sell cactus in the entity so you can build bumbo cacti 🌵
Your house looks like planktons pet from spongebob
What I am actually proud of is the fact that it has a back
it looks like a dog lol
Omg he did the back!
Lmao Joe saw the wither bar lol. Look at the chat.
23:44 "Once they are loaded in, they will be eaten. Tango: They're dead. Scar: What do they taste like?
Hello, have heard about beneath the endportal in the end?
Nobody: Grian: "I'm a pie guy" - 32 Porkchops in inventory (20:55) Also Grian one sec later: 31 Porkchops left;  Also Grian (22:08): 30 Porkchops left; Also Grian (22:17): 28 Porkchops leftn addition to that
The iron golems are to costy
a wafflehead eating pie. isn't this like canibalisim? Edit: also very nice building you did there. looks a little bit like a curved boot
"What do they taste like?"
scar is really positive
I loved the part where Grian gives building tips for interiors Its a-lot more interesting than just a Timelapse
pie guy is the name of my channel maskot lol
Oh my, i am totally in love with your starter base
Grian, i cant thank you anymore than my life <3
“I’m not going to make a starter base” these were the quotes of grian
Grian I’m so proud of you. You made a storage area that’s organised :) (I give it 2 episodes before is a mess)
anybody else getting 3rd life vibes?
It's all..... LABELED!!! Probably the best part of the whole season right there.
dam what's this fire time-lapse music pls let me know
Does the house look like a shoe or is it just me
It's a shoe!
Its kinda funny how he says he's a pie man and only eats pies but u can see he ate a porkchop
Grian just kills the wither lets build a starter base
so proud
Pie Guy - Grian Free Guy - Ryan Reynolds  What a coincidence
I saw that build on instagram too, and when I saw your thumbnail I lost it.
Grian i think you should make a heart beat with note blocks for the boulder instead of conduits
My heart sank as much as scar’s when he put down the last skull. I used to get messed with like that too💀
“I don’t even know if Iron Golems attack the wither…” Grian I literally just saw the video you made on using Golems to cheese the wither
I've been doing that wither strat since 2014 lol.
@Grian, do you happen to have a discord server, if so, may i join it?
ISKALL is going to have to burn part of that tower XD
Grians house looks like a christmas shoe, but a lovely christmas shoe
Love your base but it does look like a very fancy boot 👢
not a good choice of item to sell. "Have you seen Tango's NEW Cooper Farm!" MENTAL!
Who did you pay to make your storage system?
3:23 POV: You live in USA
Using arrows of weakness and dispensers to give the zombie villagers weakness is way better and more efficient
Why aren't you cleaing youre "entiti", it's geting greener day by day...
grian literally taking 2 hearts of damage: IM GONNA DIEEEEE
You should try to be the first hermit in all of hermitcraft to get a full netherite beacon
I just woke  up  and just posted P.S.its 7:30am
Woo! Grian labeled the chests! Wahoo!
Great prank idea: change your skin to have a withee skeleton skull head, harvest your own head a binch of times. Then create decoy withers in peoples bases, either so they see you place the blocks, or a piston shoves the last one in place
at one point grian is just going to be selling heads and it will look quite morbid once he adds That to the boulder -
We’re not gonna talk about how Scar asked what villagers taste like?
Wadzee actually made 50 iron golems fight the wither in hardcore
The wither can be killed in seconds underground using a potion of strength, a splash potion of weakness, and a smite 5 axe. I've killed like a hundred in my survival world this way.
“I apologize for stomping on your face” grain 2022
15:20 Logs 2 electric boogaloo
I like how close everyone is together this season, Season 7 especially felt very spread out and disjointed but there's an even stronger sense of community this season. Hope I get to see more hermits interact though as I've noticed they've formed sub-groups almost.
lol etho did an iron golem wither farm in the end, he used the end portal's bedrock to secure the wither as well, while the iron golem did the work
I'm just proud that the back is finished
why does the house remind me of a llama
It’s a shoe Grian… a fantastically beautiful shoe 😂
you should use soul lights for the storage (just a suggestion if you dont want to its alright)
Btw just telling you, where the warped vine is, the somewhat of a support beam looks like something not so child friendly
you do know that there is a way to make shelves without visible supports right?
Good 😊
Also grian finished the back
Please do more of these tips and tricks, its really good way to connect non hermitcraft vids with hernticraft vids. Good build btw!
Your house is a boot
It's a jalapeno. You've made a beautiful jalapeno.
its the same house as last time tho  14:14
Aging copper is way more efficient if the copper blocks are touching one another because oxidation on copper spreads to other copper blocks adjacent to the oxidized copper block   that’s what I heard  anyway
put some string on top of the warped vine so it doesnt grow
I should have figured out that you made the video “how to easily kill the wither in minecraft” meant that you were gonna kill the wither!
Wattles did the iron golem thing like a month ago
the first thing i thought of when i saw the house was the story of the little old lady who lived in a shoe
I was expecting you wouldn't do the back again
Grian, you should battle iron golems vs warden!
Donate some of your mercy to mrBeasr
Subscribe to Pie-man 🥧
Grian’s the little old lady that lived in a shoe
Nobody: Scar: "What do villagers even taste like?"
nobody else spawns iron golems to kill the wither becaus eit is so expensive and its already so easy to kill without the golems
the wither thing was done in impulse hardcour series!
Hello
Some of your videos keep popping up on FB on a channel named Dream (doubt its official)
I’m disappointed that there is in window faces :(
Catch up with what impulse is doing dude, raid farm is already done
ImpulseSV did it first. :)
If you put a string on top of the blue vine it will not grow.
"Scared Putter? You wish." Hairy Potter and the boulder
The entity files: Side-Effect 1: Grian built the entity and is doing it's biding, giving it stuff ontop of it so it can grow. Side-Effect 2: Grian is now orginized and is acting a bit more excited/happy, further testing is requried to see the other side effects. Dr, [ Redacted ] note/edit 1: Don't forget that they are also changing how they build.
There’s a back!
0:38 wow that was pretty sick grain. Or should I say. Driam?
Put hovering candles in your starter  base
They don't know about the afk wither farm from the legend Viniccius13
Grian, to be fair, people don't use iron golems because they're too expensive for what they're worth, even if you have a small iron farm. The Wither is an easy boss when done right (aka, long straight tunnel underground, shoot him with bow until 2nd phase, and then stab him) so no real reason to rely on them either.
grian: u will be proud  me: thinking he made a mega structure but he got organized(what i every day)
I'm very proud of you Grian
Yeah wadzee did the iron golem technique
I think with this new strat, Grian might sell nether stars.
Creeper is sus
Good job with the organization
Tango and Grian talking about something serious    Scar: "Do vilagers taste good?"
Grian must’ve loved pi day
The idea for your base reminds me of season 7
was anyone elses first thought when they saw grians house that old nursery thing about the old lady who lives in a shoe with like 100 kids?
Oh… my… god… *GRIAN IS ORGANIZED NOW* !!!!!!
I love your Elf Shoe! Now that I think about it, maybe the REAL "entity" is whatever giant left behind a boot big enough for you to turn into a house! XD
That's not an alchemist base that's the you living in a show house
I love how Tango just made a copper farm
The wither exposes a lot of diamonds down there
I give it two episodes it's not going to be organize for long
Boot base
I first thought it looked like a boot XD love it though!
14:59 i thought he was gonna show us that he completed the back
Grian, the torch didn’t prevent the wither from spawning, you placed the head wrong. Poor thing that could have become a wither!
Looks like a dog with a wizard hat
My mum: "Go to bed, it's late!"  *The Grian video I still need to watch*    Me: *_NAH_*
What do you mean why does nobody do this? Why would anyone waste time, iron and pumpkins into this method when all you need is a sword?
scar was right, that does look like a cat in a wizard hat
With the golems, I actually do it almost 95% of the time, and actually, you can bring him over to you by shooting your bow, and then you only need 3, iron gollems
The main reason why people don't normally don't fight the wither with iron golem like that is because originally a lot of people would have doing that in stone not in deepslate it would have a bigger hole when spawning and breaking blocks. Also since deepslate is stronger than stone it is more controlled to use iron golem.
it looks like an elf shoe
grians starter base looks like fantasy version of the old lady who lived in a shoe
You can right-click vines with shears to stop them from growing. This includes the Warped Vine!
Another tip for killing the wither. You can suffocate it in the bedrock that is generated by the end portal. Just dig under it and spawn it there.
Things are labeled, grain blink twice if you are ok
and since you can repair golems now you can do several withers a minute for like a couple stacks of iron + a handful after each one wither. Witch is nothing with a farm but even without one, it's not too bad.
You really like towers.
Grian, that shoe looks awfully suspicious, just like in that one story
grian has deafeated the chest monster
I think the main reason people don't do the iron golem thing is because it costs a lot of iron, 4 blocks per golem and you used 5 or 6 golems, so thats a total of about 200 iron ingots, or 40 hoppers. That is quite a bit
You know why no one is using Golems to kill Wither?  If you have Diamond Sword with Smite V and dring Strenght II potion... you need to hit Wither 13 times. And it dies. That's it  No need to spend way too much iron
50 shades of grian
I like how grian has become the Bob Ross of interior
Grian you should put water in the entity!!!!
Grian don't forget to map out the world early on!!!
Grain? With no chest monster? He's an imposter!
Nice shoe house
Let's hope this one won't be half explodes by the end of the season lmao.
Grian should make a wither star store because he found such an Op way to kill withers
O=O
imagine struggling in a java edition wither fight
Steveeee is going to copy this in a “How to take a Wither down in 10 seconds”
Would love to see more 'inferior/exterior decoration tips' eg. When you terraform the outside of your storage house, could you show us a few details on what you do any why?
Should've build a tent
Your inventory problem with the copper could have been solved with bundles, but Mojang still hasn't added them
Grian…are-… are you feeling alright?
Grain: we need to transport all this stuff! Me: this is a job for Donk
I like how tango and grain just didn't react when scar said he wondered what villagers taste like. lol 23:50
not only is the entity growing but it's also learning to speak :o lol
first 40 sec on this video, Grian did water bucket mlg
Nice
Me over here waiting for tag 3, or 4 it's hard to keep track of how much tag has happened
this video made my day, my pet hen/chicken is dying, most likely will be gone in the morning, so this made me smile❤
Make a shop or section of the boulder for wither killing services and just use the golems
Who are you give us grian back!
No one uses golems on the wither because it's really expensive and the wither is so easy to kill that it's just not worth it
Pretty sure impulse used this method with igs
Grian…     Your timelapse music sounds like the opening sene from FNaF security breach o-O
No one does that cause it’s way more expensive and less effective than just trapping it or doing what you did but just hitting it with a sword
15:01  I swear you’ll never see anything like it again
You should probably get a blast furnace lol
Grian has a boot for a house
Grian should make the entity a geode
the only thing i see when I see your base is a duck
Love you grian
i  am  so  prod😊
Episode 5: Elytra PLS
Finally someone else who likes pie I'm not weird anymore
What a nice Shoe!
My brain is still on hermit craft 6 anyone else?
Tipp: u can stuck wither under bedrock for example in the nethet so u can kill it without any problem
the chat when they spawned the wither lol
Who are you and what did you do with Grian!?
Honestly impressed on the organization of the chests!
That crafting table on the roof man :P
I really like the starter house, kinda looks like a shoe
I was waiting to say a “have you been living under a rock until now??” joke
"oh look at dose fancy heads"
The reason nobody does this is because u don't get the achievement if the iron golems kills it u have to
16:34   I personally think its a magic giant boot
What if the entity was actually a curse. You make it so people don’t buy things but instead exchange their heads for it but the more they give the more they begin to change(their skin). But you put really good things so people would want to exchange their heads for them. Like build passes or armor or gear. stuff like that
Pls I want a tutorial 😢😢
I gave u a like for being organized bro! Holy heck
15:15 it is all *labelled*
eE
Does naming chests in an anvil work on Java?
It's cool that Grian stuff is currently organised .... but it won't last. I guess by episode 8 the chest monster will return
grians acting a little PIE-ous if you ask me
Grian and tango: INFINITE EMERALDS Scar: infinite totems you say?
You should use item frames for the cheap materials, instead of signs.
5:13 Who are you and what have you done with the real Grian? Sorry 15:13 I can’t type lol
why does the pig picture on the map have 3 arms
I had a strange and terrible dream about you, Mambo and Scar, and I don't want to talk about it😐💔😨🤮🤢🌈
Lol dat bucket clutch at the begianing deserves a like. good work my guy!
Plot twist: the pies are drugged and make the consumer addicted
the chest monster is grwing
Wait until Mumbo pulls an uno reverse and waxes all of Grian's copper
At 15:20 you can see a chest labeled ‘Logs’ and another one labeled ‘Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo’ :D
At some point you gotta try the dripstone trick on the wither, near instant kill, stuff hurts
Proud of the MLG, proud
Your starter house look like a boot-dog with a magician hat, i like it 👍
Thank you for all the build tips when building the house
i like scars edit, seeing the stuff happening in between cuts lol
Organized!? Who is this man an what have you done with Grian!?
hey u make some very good vids
Wow a hermitcraft 9 im so behind still on the one with castle and hobbit ole
does this guy realize that there is a 90% chance that he took to long to get to the bottom of that copper tower, thus rendering >%50 of that copper lost from despawning
Grian, the reason people don’t do this is because it costs 229 iron ingots and you cam take it down easily with your sword
To be honest mate, I was most proud of that there was a back to your base
why does nobody do that? They do, there's tutorials on how to defeat it in 10 seconds using golems.
Day 1: when I first came upon the entity, I thought it nothing but a mossy rock, unusual geology for the surrounding grasslands but not far fetched, then I heard it, a heart beat coming from within the mossy stone, i was enamoured, I have now begun this journal to keep track of the discoveries I find as I continue my study of this entity  Day 3: with 2 days of sample taking I uncovered a hole inside only to discover the entity is hollow, I cannot find the source of the heartbeat but it is forever present  Day 7: as I build my future lab and temporary home I stored some wooden logs near the entity and left to go hunting for food, when I returned the logs were halfway absorbed by the entity, now the logs have been fully absorbed and a medium sized tree sapling has grown into a light wooded willow tree on top of the entity, fascinating as it is, this requires further study, even now the hollow interior has changed, a corner of the cave is made of wood bark and is slowly expanding outwards into a shape I cannot discern just yet  Day 8: the bark has now become a fully functional chest of wood, when I open it I found a spacious box filled with logs. When I close and reopen there are more logs, I believe this entity can absorb and continuously reproduce material by dragging matter from underneath and nearby to fill these chests with material, this requires further study. Next I will leave ingots and blocks of copper to see if the entity will absorb and produce like with the logs to prove my theory correct.
Organized? Colorful? Back is complete?   Okay so who are you and what have you done with the real Grian?
Add a happy little tree over there
Considering how powerful Grian’s Wither strategy is… I guess the hardest part of defeating the wither now is getting the skulls… 👀
I wonder what is the mega base
I think that u should make a mega base with Scar and cover the island with trees and the bolder can be the center of the mega base
Ohhhh so that’s why he made that beacon video
pls scare people with withers every season now
I cant be the only one that sees an elf shoe on grians house right?
um, is it just me, or does Grian's base look like a shoe?
No I was surprised that the back was finished
The reason why nobody kills withers with golems is that the wither is already easy to kill when trapped underground liike in the video.
How many episodes do yall think Grians organized chests will last? i think only 2 or 3
BTW FALSE IS ALSO SELLING COPPER SOOO...... PRICES MAY VERY GOODLUCK xD
I think you should have some cool leaves around the base on the out
I think Tango has bested you in the copper game.
Ohoo *WOW* i really want to learn how to build in minecraft
UNINTENTIONAL GOAT HOUSE I LOVE IT!
Tango is going to beat you in the copper game. He has a mega farm for it
The Bob Ross Of minecraft
In your starter house you should use different coloured candles and normal lanterns along with soul lanterns
There is a problem with your mic
Grian,is season 9 like season 8 with no shopping district?
Grain you should have made lots of rocks connecting to your shop to live in lov ur vids
14:55 when he said "your gonna be soo proud of me" i thought he was gonna say he did the back (yes i know he still did)
Ive killed a wither once and the only time I did it was with iron golems.
No one, grain giving me elfin bard energy.
Seriously never thought Grian didn't know that iron golem kill the wither
I thought he said we were going to be proud of him because he built a back to the build
Your vids are so good
When he said we would be proud of him I thought he was going to say that he did the back. Unfortunately that was not the case.
Moon’s small
I thought he was gonna say that "you are gonna be proud of me cause I did the back" lmao
M
Iron goelms arent used because its so expensive. People would rather use the iron for farms and whatnot.  If its late in the game and people have iron farms, usually they just use the bedrock int he end or fight it normally.  ALSO, Wadzee did this, 100 golems vs 10 withers. The golems lost coz u know many withers at once = pain. Also, fun fact, if you right click any iron golem with an iron ingot, it gets repaired.
As someone getting back into minecraft what does copper do
Does anyone know how to record Minecraft? Because I've tried a few different things and it hasn't worked. Please help.
Yay!
Poultry man.. more like pastry man
No begs the question, do we use the wither to strip mine deepstate??
i leave youtube for a minute and HER s9 has already started like im only at ep23 of s8 :(
THE ULTIMATE VILLAGER FARM!
You can wax copper in your crafting slots
I’ve seen wadzee do this in a one block series Edit: using golems to defeat the wither
No one kills the wither like that because it cost a lottttttt of iron
Grian being organized? What sort of trickery is this!
You sould try 100 hours of minecraft bedrock next please
We should also be proud of you because you finished THE BACK!
Take “oh no there are zombies in My tree” out of context
Im not gonna lie, I thought your starter base was a giant’s shoe 😅
People have used golems for years..................
Does anyone else think the stater base looks a bit like a shoe?
Ya good for you
Finally a starter/ storage room has a back. Well done grian this will go down in history
I’ve done the iron golem wither trick for SO LONG and it works SO GOOD
*runs to my minecraft realm*
nice oginization
GUYS HE DID THE BACK FIRST TIME
i'm building a giant room in MC
Is it just me, or does the house look like a dog from the side?
grian: makes starter base. me: thats a boot
Does anyone agree on the house looking like a llama or dog?
Did you know that if you turn your render distance down in a nether fortress, wither skeletons and blazes have a higher spawn rate. It’s good for grinding skulls and powder if you ever need it
Grian is the Bob Ross of Minecraft
Anyone else thinks the base looks a bit like a pointy shoe?
Btw in season 7 Impulse use to farm Nether Star in the end with iron golem to restock the lamp shop.
Anyone else getting wizard vibes from the roof
omg i build almost the same starter house at my survival world a month ago. i accutaly love your version, mine is a bit taller with pointy tover
who votes grian bring back the custom skins and make himself a grian wizard skin for studying the entity?
an enchanting tower?
The iron golems worked really well, but I do get why they don't get used much, for most people they're pretty expensive and the wither isn't that hard to kill if you know what you're doing. But a Smite V sword + strength 2 makes your slice through him like a sharp knife slices through warm butter(not Putter) if you are struggling.
first time I've seen organization before ep 20 well done (I don't mean this sarcastically)
I am shocked about your organisation🤯😱😳
You can do what mumbo did in season 7 for the entity's heartbeat. Use note blocks.
Living under a rock is always a good thing cos patrick the sea star lived under a rock and he shaped the childhoods of millions on children
2:58 You heard him. "Netherite beacon." That's what he said, now he has to do it.
:)
Grian: living under a rock is not always a good thing Patrick Star: hey! What's wrong with me?
Scar reminded me of Jumba from lilo and stitch when he said "happy birthday"
Enjoy competing with Tango’s copper farm
Im never fighting the wither without golems again
People don't fight the wither that way becouse the best way is still spawning it under the bedrock nest in the End.
The reasons why no one does the iron golem wither strategy is: 1. Too expensive 2. If u want to defeat the wither easily just spawn it under the end exit portal 3.  If you don't want to make it that easy you just fight it regularly
Amazing 👏
No chest monster!!!
im sad grian doesnt have a eltra he has one every third ep:(
Amazing you sorted your chest round off plores
Season 3 of waiting the 5 diamond blocks to come back
The reason people don’t use golems for withers is because you can go to the end or nether roof bedrock to kill it
Etho often uses golems to cheese the wither under the end portal. That way the wither can’t kill the golems either usually.
Grian, heres a tip when fighting blazes. Use snowballs
Tango: designs and builds an incredibly efficient copper farm  Grian: so im going to sell copper
I’ve seen the roof design of your starter base all over Instagram I like it though
i love that grian always has 1 more vid than mumbo
Not gonna lie I teared up a little when you revealed your chests were organized. I mean, uh… allergies! Yeah, that’s what is was.
What if poultry man was studying the entity. Bring him back please.
Grian finally you have done it signed your chest and sorted it out
Everybody selling copper this season.
Bring back hermit news But sell daily news
16:50: when you turn a hermitcraft video into a build tutorial.
I give it 2-3 episode until a new chest monster show up again lol
Use blast furnace to smelt ores faster Grian ;)
i’m so excited for this new season and all the cool builds! with all these new and great updates we’ve had within the past 2ish years it’s gonna be so coool!
What i'm proud of is that grian finished the back AND interior
Fighting withers in Java. Noobs lol 🤣🤣
Someone tell Grian there are blast furnaces if he keeps smelting so much ore lol
I really like this starter base grian! I also love it when you colab with scar. It's cool that you always are getting  a new goal each season!
There was an old hermit that lived in a shoe
Bro when u said sorry at the beginning idk why i said it’s fine
And you built the back
fill the entitiy with water, its such a good use for the conduit and would make it so much cooler
I love your starterbase but it kinda looks like a chicken
Grian: you guys will be so proud of me Me: you did the back of the base Grian: I moved all my chest inside  Me: That works
Love how there's 3 people trying to sell copper: Grian, False and Tango. Except False and Grian stand little chance against Tangos Drowned farm
to answer your question less people use iron golems to kill the wither because it’s a little expensive! furthermore if you’re not in a small hole like you are the wither will fly upwards and the golems won’t be able to hit it. with 1.18 the blast resistant deepslate makes this method as good as its ever been
23:50 "what does it taste like"  scar why do you do this to us
i liked the name logs two electick bugalao.
etho does this
Grian: I am doing something very stupid  Everyone: I see, this episode will be completely normal!
grian lives in a boot
I use bedrock edition and the wither is just so overpowered that the can easily break out of pits I'm sad it only works in java
Every time Grian says the Boulder my mind goes to Avatar
h-h he did a--a house?
Grian u seaky little dude
yo look its the house grian wasnt going to make
Its just too expensive for the iron blocks lol
"Grian built a house." "HE WHAT???" *Sad boulder noise*
You know something's up when grian forgets the "gooooooooood bye!"
Scar:*praises grian for using iron golems* Impulse:*who did it first*😒
11:21 "Sustainable, super sustainable!"
Looks like as shoe with a hat
if you need more beacons you can spawn the wither under the portal in the end and trap it so you can hit its tail safely
For some reason I feel like a dad proud of my son for sorting items G man has finally did it mumbo needs to see this
Impulse did the golem thing on hardcore just recently 😊
I felt so tense and was genuinely shocked when u placed the 3rd head 😂😂
I was actually dumbfounded when I saw the labels
I love Grian’s boot lol
Tango build an insane copper farm u might be run out of business
Grian’s starter base looks like a fantasy take on The Little Old Lady who Lived in a Shoe
hmm, something that may have been able to make that build a bit easier would be using a stone cutter and taking a stack of each type of copper, then place and wax what you need with out having to much of anything
14:55 I though he was about to say he did the back
Shoe house and boulder
6:57 This is such a great prank, though I already knew it wouldnt spawn a wither.
6:58 my soul left my body
You might be proud of your organization I'm just proud you put a back on it lmao
Impulse did it, babe!!! But uhh you used considerably wayyy less golems.
19:04 You could have fully oxidized copper in your inventory and scrape it down to the level you want and apply the wax afterwards.
Do hermitcribs please
Team fortres pie  Scout Piero Soldier Demoman Heavy Engineer Medic Snipier Spie
We're especially happy the starter house has a back 😊, love your vids Grian
This season is gonna be so short cus grian doesnt have to spend half of the season looking for stuff. Lol
Grian: and guys, look.. Me: omg Grian: you're gonna be so proud of me Me: he didn't.. Grian: check it out!! Me: he did the backside?! Grian: there are no chests outside :D
Grian: You guys are going to be super proud Me: You made the back of the build?
When you were ecxited about the chest monster and said "guess what guess what guess what?" I thought it was because you did the back of the base.
Grian put your copper next to each other it ages faster
Love it.
Ummm Grian, there’s a bit of an inappropriate spot holding the warped stem and it might get you demonetised so maybe change that a bit
why not starter mouse
mumbo is so gonna wax your copper
Yes
6:40 what was Grian humming?  It could be a lot of things, but it sounded eerily similar to; Rakuen, the intro to Dr. Stone season 2.
Hi Grian Ethoslab does use iron golems to kill the wither. Just to let you know
Who is gonna tell Grian that you can easily kill withers by shoving them under end gateways
Wow He actually did the back
Let's go MLG water bucket strraaaaaaaaattttttt
17:00 BadTimesWithScar???
The chaos of hermitcraft it iconic
*It spoke to me* COINCIDENCE? I THINK NOT!
My prediction is that grian is gonna start an empire/revolution and name it “The emPIEr”
a super sustainable creeper?
You should make another build that is a more modern and science-based camp to also research *THE ENTITY* Kinda base it off the SCP foundation.
It would be funny and interesting to see a Grian *cough pufferfish cough* bust house for your starter base though I do see alot of pranks happening to it if it was a thing ... 😅
Wadzee had done this a long time ago
when grian said ur gonna be proud of me for this I thought he was gonna have no back of the base lol
the torch didnt stop the wither from spawning it was because he put the wither skull on backwards
You should steal the egg from Pearl it is in her attic
grian use blast furnaces
thats what i needed to get into a better mood!  got myself a drunk to deal with a shitty situation right now and now i feel a LOT better!
The iron golem strat works... But the bedrock in the end strat is better
Scar got that river Cuomo drip
hey someone used iron golems to beat the wither in a challenge that included: no sprinting no jumping no left clicks no sneaking no armour
Zedaph also made a boulder, you need to start boulder wars like you did with the hobbit holes in S7.
Man i am proud of you because you finished the back 😂
the villager system should be changed, could you make a village instead of a trading hall
That image on Instagram is exactly what inspired me to build my Art Chateau on Zedcraft Patreon server!!!
*walks through the village* the blacksmith asking himself who the heck is he
How has Grian not started a war yet?
Check out Impulse’s hardcore wither fight.. he had like 20
I like Grian saying no one does this. Didn’t Impulse do this in episode 1?
6:57 Season 8 flashbacks lol good thing Mumbo wasn't there xD
WHO IS THIS MAN he did the BACK and he made a SORTED STORAGE ahhhHHH!!!!
How many of you noticed "Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo"?
Who is this!? Grien?!?!
Lol he made the planet express bulding
Does it work in Bedrock?
Very cool video Grian!
I hate how my cat sounds like a ghast and every time grian goes into the nether I think my cat is  behind me
Is it just me, or does the song that Grian uses sound like the song that Scat uses when he does super fast build mode
16:28      Grian explain yourself
Sorted Inventory!!
Grian:living under a rock isn't a good thing Patrick:I am very offended right now :<
I can’t stop seeing a shoe like style on top of Grian’s starter base lol.
Use a blast furnace. Mush quicker
I think it would be really neat for a library section of the starter house that documents how the Entity changes over time like when you add a new product
pov: homeless
yay
The house looks like a shoe
"I can't afford to die"  Same
Hey Grian you just made my day a bit better by uploading this video because i am really sick right now so you uploading this makes ne a bit happier
Oi
I think people just have fun fighting withers the old fashion way
wish i could build like that
Grian's house = basically the mystery shack
How to i Take your skin Grian
OMG GRIAN HIIIIIIIIII
Grian: i want to experiment a lot with colour this season Colourblind people: why I don't see why people need colours
Fun Fact: stonecutters give you 4x the amount of cut copper than crafting tables.
at 5:15 you just threw your picaxe away
I'm always amazed when grian starts building. All i manage to make are boxes so just watching these beautiful structures be created out of plain looking terrain is just incredible
Grian. I know you have a thing for chest monsters, and a dislike for sorting systems (to the point the last time you made one, you didn't use it once) so how about a compromise. Make a chest wall and use that as your chest monster storage instead of leaving them laying out all over the place. You can upgrade this to just a wall of shulker boxes for your storage, then just mine the box you want to take with you when you need to.   Chests and shulkers are out of the way, and you get to fulfill your endless random chest searching need.
Grian labeled chests? 😮😮😮
Is it just me of does Grains started base look like a chihuahua with a hat?
fancy shoe house?
GRIAN I AM SOOOO PROUD!!! Abd i am suprised that you for the first time ever while playing minecraft sorted your items
Grian praying to cakes takes the term pi(e)ous to the next level
i love you edit: your videos 💌
he hopper de copper
I will always support doing things with Scar no matter what it is. He is one of the most entertaining hermits there is. Always good natured and laughing. Need more of it.
You should be able to wax copper in your inventory. I know it kinda makes it less satisfying but its just so much more convenient
Add an eye to The Entity pointing to your starter base so The Entity is watching who ever is in there, and maybe make it out of Diamond or Emeralds to show your Valuables off.
Why do I feel like the chests being organized won't last long 😂😅
I can’t believe Scar turned into a knife eared leaf lover 🤢 I think I’m gonna be sick
Hey grian whay are the first 100 digits of pi
I got an even better idea with the wither...ok not in the way of killing it but using it and i have just one word to describe it.  I call my invention: withermine  You just use a wither to dig out areas so you can get diamonds :)
A 5 day gap between episodes is too much pls
20:39 Oh no a food war.
Not only is all the storage labeled but he also did the back side! XD
Grian: “Look you guys are gonna be proud of me” Me: HE FINALLY DID THE BACK YESSS Grian: “I labelled my chests and organised them” Me: Still proud buddy, still proud
I think grian that the reason people don't use golems for the Witter is that they are expensive and those iron blocks could be used for the beacon base
Is it just me or does your base kinda look like a pointy shoe 😅
the reason why most people don't make iron golems is because iron goelms are pricey, and not everyone feels like building iron farms
Yay episode 3 is finally here!
I swear I saw you in real life I know I have its impossible that its not you also starter base in episode 3 so early
So much hermits are saying it's season 9 but it's not, even you! It's season 8.
Why does the house look like a dog with a hat on
I love your starter base! Very whimsical!
Not sure how you make every build better than the last
The house looks like a boot ♥️👢👢
Grian is the Bob Ross of Minecraft building
I kinda feel like the water bucket mlg is overused Change my mind
Holy Moly! This is so Beautiful! I am always Impressed by your builds. Let me just take a Moment to appreciate that
you can use shears on twisting vines to stop it from growing, not many people know about this 1.18 feature
Looks like a shoe
I wish copper blocks were like quartz and only took 4 ingots to craft, seeing as they're a building material rather than an asier way to store it.
Why do they have world border?
You should charge people a diamond for daily news and we're daily news inside some type of big Croatian you make of a new station
15:30 Who tf are you and what have you done with our grian
good job nice house
Ok legit but with all the Entity stuff, I wanna see some SCP foundation to come watch it
Grian: The long eyed homeless tellytubby 😂😂
16:36 Me: Oh cool, he's adding backround to the starter base. Matpat: LOORRREE!!!!!11!!!!1!!
HMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Nice!
Can we just appreciate how awesome Grian’s Timelapses are?
I think adding stuff like veins to the entity could make it feel more alive and mysterious!
You should progressively make the entity larger and larger underground and spread it under people's bases and see how long it takes them to notice
I'm excited for this villager project. You guys need to go all out, get every useful trade in the game. With built in zombie conversion and stuff
3:16 Master Skywalker there are too many of them, what are we going to do?
Yessssssssssssssssss another episode!
Someone changed Grian, he is starting to organize...
Petition to get grian to only eat Pie this season....
He says we’re proud of the organization no I’m proud that there’s a back
He did the back!😲
You can heal the golems with ingots so you don't have to build new ones for each wither
Grian, your starter house is a boot right?
Honestly, I’m more proud of the fact that he did the back 😂😂
16:06 I actually did this in my Skyblock world after I was done with the 'Skyblock' portion of the world. I set up a few hundred blocks away from the void's edge and built a tower. In that tower I have my chests essentially on shelves that have dark oak trapdoors on the sides. It looks pretty good.  I should some day return to my floating mass of cobblestone and try making it look nice but that'll be much later. I have other things I want to do first like building a roof on my watchtower and making a tank for my light blue axolotl that I found in a lush cave.
Your bace looks like a shoe
Grians house looks like an elf shoe
Is it just me or does your starter house look like a cat with a witch hat? :D I like the little tail with the hanging lantern on the tip :D
Organized? Finished the back? Cleaned up your chest monster? amazing
how did you get so poplar with minecraft you are amazing
Knowing you Grian, imma let this "Organization" thing pan out for a while.. 😁
Being the pie guy could add some more personality to the story of the base.
Hii
Who are you and what have you done with grian
Grian: builds the Entity  The SCP Foundation: Throw it at the fucking lizard!!!
my first impression of the starter house was "Loch Ness Monster"  noice <3
I usually just spawn the wither in a long strip mine and pound it with potion of strength II  + Sharpness (or smite)
Bedrock has much harder withers and the iron golems wouldn’t have stood a chance, so that explains some of the reason people don’t kill the wither with iron golems
Grian mlg
I totally thought you were gonna say your gonna be proud of me I finished the back
Good job grian u finally organized something
When is Hermit Cribs coming back? I thought it was a great idea.
A few hrs ago i wached scars video lol he almost died.
Turning a hermitcraft episode into a tutorial on interiors? great! Love it!
omg grian cant get enogh pies XD. Sorry younins who dont get it
Grian’s gone mad! He’s talking to rocks!
Who are you and what did you do to my disorganised son
you see so many weird starter bases in hermitcraft
Happy day!
it a dog
WHY IS NOBODY TALKING ABOUT SCAR ASKING WHAT A VILLAGER TASTES LIKE 23:49
@15:15 I thought you were gonna have us proud that you finished the back of your base 😂 Great work, Grian! The build is stellar!
PearlescentMoon and Grain both making a foreign landscape with their bases themed on observation style buildings. Maybe they can collab? The Entity being some pseudo-telepath bio-form (not quite animal nor plant) that slowly grows, using stray thoughts of yearnings to procure bait-lures. The Observers split to study the Entity and its ecosystem?
I really enjoy how Grian has started giving tiny tutorials after he builds something to explain how he did it.
I love the new time lapse music
Grian you finished the back!
You could say grian is a "pieoneer
Loving the look of those waxed exposed cut copper stairs
I would’ve never thought that you would start sorting. I’m really, truly, proud of you.
What ur making one now!!
“Logs 2: electric boogaloo” in the storage room 😂 idk why that made me so happy
POV you like pies: I am a Pieoniere=
grian try to implement the boulder in scar's vilage
Since your house is a boot, it'll better walk!
You should use honey blocks for the emeralds! The honey blocks will make the items fall slower into the hoppers, it looks awesome
no one is doing it because it is easier to kill him under the end portal
Scar: "What do they taste like..?" Grian: **continues talking**
Snif my nose
15:00 I was so sure he was gonna show us that he built the back
Hi grian thanks for this my day has been horrible. My cat was run over last night and was found this morning. She was only a year old and was so nice and loving and never hurt anyone. This has helped me take my mind off it for a bit.
22:15 yes grian,nothing is wrong with your fishing pole it’s average size and has a great personality.
6:50 My thoughts here were 'Not again Grian'
Anyone else sees Grins starter base as a boot.😂
wall war?
The storage building looks like a wizard turned a scorpion into a house
this episode grian makes a elf shoe x,D
at 16:27 if you look at the stripped logs it looks like a d i c k. weird for our pg family friendly Grian lol.🤣
No porkchop for him, he's a pioneer
Im proud, that you did the full house WITH the back...
That water bucket was sick
3.14
Can’t you use sacks to expand your inventory?
You guys should do something like mumbo’s potato bubble elevator last season with the emeralds from the raid farm it would look so cool
14:27 Dog with wizard hat :D
I thought when grian said your gonna be proud I thought he mentioned the back of the build
I'm more impressed he did the back
Correcting how to pronounce putter was the most british thing I've heard this year. Butter --> Putter makes sense but put + ter makes sense too 😃
Because it takes so much iron to do that when the wither is already super easy to kill
Missed the opportunity to build a home under the massive bridge to Pearls house...Grain could be a troll.
Grian  " you're going to be so proud of me, its all labeled"  Everyone "but is the back done?"
A starter house idea is a floating island next to your bolder
does anyone else think that giran's starter base looks like scar's base in 3rd life S2
that house is so pretty love it <3
Donk has a backpack full of splash potion of weakness because he is weak.
I'm sorry that mlg at the start was so impressive???
15:00
Grian your starter house (storage room) looks a bit like a shoe
lets take a moment to appreciate that grian did the backs of both the boulder and the starter house
Someone really needs to clip “sus, super sus”
That house looks like a dog with a curved tail that is wearing a wizard hat... just saying. LMAO
"it's adequate"  24:46
10:30 well iv seen 2 ppl do it
Such a PIEus man
"am I that predictable?" I meen... that the third time you've done that exact thing sooo..  *YES*
Have you thought about bringing Tortoise to hermit craft you know from evo?
That Is like a scar build
Organized inventory... who are u and what have u done with grian?
WHO THE F*CK MADE A SLAANESH DEAMON STATUE?
first hour gang
Grian: I don't know why people don't use iron golems to beat the wither... Me: Looking up videos of people doing it 6+ years ago :')  Mostly people didn't do it because trapping in bedrock was so easy and content creators do the "killing it the easy way is boring so lets do a fight" just for a video's sake despite it being done 100000s of times by now that way.
Why does ur house look like a dog to me?
Grian: I'm a pie guy Me: ah. So you're Dean Winchester.
‘I’m a pie guy’ I have a feeling it’s a repeat of potato boy 😂
Hi
The best way to destroy a wither! Congrats on being a minecraft genius!
Grian: spends more iron than my inventory has ever seen on a temporary way to beat the wither  Also Grian: why don’t people do this more often?
your base looks like a baby alpaca please put a face on it
And so the season 9 chest monster begins
Grian, I’m in need for a inspirational house so that I can make a beautiful house in Minecraft. Any help?
Omg I was so scared grain would spawn the wither at scars base because he would actually do something like that in accident when trolling
The real good thing about the house is that it has a back
Omg he finally put time in and organised it in stead of a chest monster
When he said "you guys are gonna be so proud" I thought: "Yes finally, he made the back of the base right away" 😂
No mess? Organized storage? Ha! Genjutsu of that level will not work on me!!
Fun fact; if you put copper next to eachother then it oxidises faster.
16:34 Artificer sounds better
Sooo I’mma use a lot of iron golems now lol
Grian: "this build is supposed to look like some kind of alchemist lives here" Me: who only see some old wizard boot... "BOOTy of Grian's LOOTy"
To me it looks like that Magician hut came alive from being too close to The Entity, because that house really looks like a wizard's magic dog. I mean that tower so looks like a head, and that on the other end, I mean how could that not be a tail?
GRIAN!! :D
"Why don't people do this more often?" I think Vinicius13 have an farm using iron golens to kill the wither.
This house would be my mega base
15:12 Grian character arc
Hmmmm, wondering if you can go wither-diamond mining?
Good job Grian! I’ve always waited in anticipation for your next video. And the intro is always on point. Much love!
Clearly, Grian didn't watch Impulse's hardcore wither fight! 😂
grian you make the best videos i have ever seen keep it up! :D season 8 is the best!!!!!!
I’m more proud that the back is finished than you having a storage system
U can make a drowned farm for copper:)
If only he uploaded on the 14th 😔
I have an idea of building an extension that is a broken house from the roof and the entity in the middle you can sell things in the house and the entity can get bigger like a moster asteroid egg
Looks kinda viking ship
Please someone tell me I’m not the only one who sees the base is clearly a shoe
I was more proud of him making a back to the base
16:58 GRIAN HOW COULD YOU…… YOU CAN’T SAY “ROUND” IT’S MINECRAFT
It kinda looked like a dog
Grians storage looks like a moldy old boot. It’s pretty good looking though
I don't know if this is a good idea, but what if you live as a parasite in/on Mumbo's vault?
Why do you think nobody kills withers with iron golems!?
organized chests are temporary, chest monsters are eternal
Wait a second.... Is the boulder the main character from the anime "To Your Eternety",their concepts are really similar.
Omg is this a different reality grain being organized 🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀🙀
The house looks like a very strange cat
Mmm monkey
Anybody notice what grian did at 15:43 ?
guys clearly this organization is a silent plea for help, take this seriously!
Jumping in the comment of make a bread section in your boulder and naming it Grian's Grains Instead you can do a food section that sells bread (ofcourse) but also Golden Carrots + other golden versions of the fruits and veggies and you can name it Grains and Greens  Also, please please fill up the boulder with water. That'll make it awesome and also give the heart and purpose. Plus allow you to sell more stuff cause now you can put chests towards the top and hermits can just swim to it
6:54 Grian...  What happened last time you tried this?
I know why people don't kill the wither with golems is that golems are expensive and just digging a tunnel and left clicking is easier than spawning a bunch of golems
cat the base is a cat
Grian "putter"  Scar "pooder"
hmmmm I see lore potential.  I think mumbo will be like a bussness man who wants to become rich but has no money so he gose to the wizzard living next store to make money for him but it gose terribly wrong.
I'm with Scar it looks like a cat from a distance :)
nice bucket landing
Day 2 of commenting this until grian notices:The amazing Mr. Grain and Mumbly Jumbly.
i had that insta post saved lmao.
Better watch out; Tango has an absolutely INSANE copper farm built!
Have you ever played terraria? I would be interested in how you would build there
Grian Is a pie-man? or paimon? heh
nobody uses golams when fighting the Wither because the end gate portal mathod is just way more broken.
Rock no longer habitable  *lives in shoe*
I gasped so loudly when you jumped off the copper pillar, that my mom heard me from  across the room and asked what's wrong. lol
He has a boot for a house  You know you see it
Why Grian eats so much pie lately? Because it was pi day when it was recorded (03.14)!
returned from
That isnt a starter base that is definetly a giant shoe
I tested something like this before, it actually only takes 2 iron golems to kill a wither, so u wasted a bunch of iron
Grian, it is even easier to just drop the golems from the ceiling on the wither using scaffolding. That's what I did on my channel
That's a boot with a hat. Convince me otherwise.
its a cat
👏Well Done Grian For Organising Your Chests👏
Grian ep 1: “I’m not making a starter house.” Grian ep 3: (Makes a starter base “
Hermitcraft season 9: the season of the golems
you finished the back im proud
Ur base looks like a dog
Grian and organized!?! 2 WORDS NOBODY THOUGHT COULD BE POSSIBLY TOGETHER!!!!
15:09 Im actually proud you made the back of it
Grian: Sus, super sus Me: nice👌
next season you should go futuristic builds
Loony should join hermitcraft
Grian make a shop and sell all the villager trades
i  would love to see grian, do some asian architecture, maybe chinese or Japanese?
Grian the Prank Elf
Living under the rock, you must be "Patrick Star"!!!
I’m proud of you for building the back heheh
Etho does it
If possible Grian, could we get a tutorial for that amazing looking house?
I’m just proud it has a back
Grian in season 8: release a wither in botam! Grian in season 9: how about releasing a wither next to scar base?  Me: ah grian, you never change🤣. Building with Grian is always fun
Isn't a starter house considered as first night house that you live in?
15:15 moment which happens once in a million years 🤣🤣
Creates a ROCK shop... Doesn't sell stone.   Entity is confused on its own existence. :D
I thought he was going to say "You guys are going to be so proud of me.... I finished the back of my base!"
you sould make a emerald waterfall
I've seen it done on hermitcraft, as late as last season even. Thing is, at a certain point a server simply has a killchamber in The End. When there's a skull farm as well on an SMP, mass production of beacons usually is happening in The End... with a bedrock locked wither killer, surrounded by 3-4 iron golems. Purely for their dps. For the first wither? Well... its often as early at a point where people simply didn't have much iron yet (or an iron farm... don't forgot ample natural iron is a recent 1.18 change). You saw they would wither quite hard (and need iron to heal up) after even one wither, so most people just... tunnel-snipe it. Still: it was fun to watch, and it made it even more trivial! Nice video as always, Grian, thank you!
At the end of the season all the hermits should make a movie
I think we know that grian is going to not be sorted for long…
i like the house but it likes like a shoe
I am waiting for the next episode
How did grian get the trap door in 15:43
bild the hous or a hous on to the bolder/entety
all i saw with the base is a big colorful shoe
Organisation!? Who are you and what did you do with Grian?!
this is giving me s3 s6 and s7 vibes lol
I am 99% sure there will be a food war between the pie-eaters and the pork-eaters
You finally did your storage. RIP chest monster...
Grian im so proud 15:10 Not only because you moved all your storage and organized it! but because the back of the base is also done! <3 Edit: I realized this sounded kinda mean, Im sorry I didn't mean it to sound mean! <3
Oh my time, the starter base has a _back_ . What is this sorcery
Cultist studying the entity
Noooooooo the chest monster is no more
Is it just me or does it sound like grain is going to start a religion around the bolder
God…HOW do you DO this????!?!
Grian you should really start farming withers tbh
Does anyone else think that Grian’s new house looks like a shoe?
i love little grian floating in the air when he shows off the base lmao
These tips and tricks are really interesting and inspiring.
Grian, if you keep your stuff organised. I promise to like all of your videos and share it.
Compared to java, the bedrock wither is a straight up GOD
Grian's base is a Sphinx with a wizard hat!
Does anyone else feel like using a wither to mine for diamonds in deepslate might actually be really effective?  Like you could set up a really long 2x1 tunnel, put a bunch of iron golems at the very end, and use the wither to expand the tunnel by luring it along, and as long as you stay above the lava level you'll be fine
No one does it because of the end portal method lmao
Fun fact:  people actually do, do this...   they use it in the end though...
Wow the java wither is easy
but grian where are the wings
At 10:53 he sounds like Mumbo lol
anyone on the hermitcraft server could make a moving company for moving their customers items to a like mega base and make bank
omly mi tat are shokt by the chests
It may seem like a smart choice to do a group villager trading hall, but don't forget that the cured villager discounts are only for those who cured them!
Grian you crazy son of a gun
New time laps music
Everyday I type Grian into my search bar to see if a new episode is out!
Grian: the second we go over there, the villagers are going to be eaten. Scar: I wander what they taste like?
Interesting.
is grians builder a mini version of the world with iskalls season 7 tree or scars "starter" base?
Fill the Entity with water.
I love that starter base and also donk is the best.
I can't believe you made all the sides of the base
LABELS YESSSSSSSSSSS
Mumbo better wax some of the copper, just for the laughs
I can't believe you made all the sides of the base
There are actually already several copper farms built by the hermits. You could live in someone's basement like Cub.
Only Grian fights the wither before making a starter house
Reasons, why we do not use iron golems to defeat withers: - It's better to get wither to kill something for wither roses so I rather make  a big clock with dispensers shooting hundreds of chickens - We want one more wither killed to our stats - Smite V does it much faster - If you hit golem by accident you propably much more about to die than facing a wither on your own. Like c'mon, we're on java, we got weak withers
I like to believe that the alchemist scientist is not only studying The Entity, but also the windigo, which appears to have undergone a metamorphosis, and Pearl's alien house.
Youtube automatically lowered my resolution when you walked into scar's base :D
I'm not proud of you organizing I'm proud you put a back on it.
Damn 0 dislikes, must be a good one
I thought the being proud part would be that he made the back
The starter house looks a little boot-shaped to me and made me think of the old English nursery rhyme of There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe
14:15 Doggie!
Back when I was starting up on YouTube I actually tried this "Minecraft Lore" series with a whole plan of showing people researching in the Minecraft world. One episode was based on Soul Sand, and the "discovery" of the Wither. I had a bunch of Iron Golems ready, and it surprised me how quickly it was taken care of. Of course, life intervened, and I never picked back up the rest of the series, but it was a fun little project.
must admit seeing every hermit making trading halls is a little boring. Cool starter built though
The moment you realise that Grien’s minecraftly a girl
Grian's starter base kinda looks like a chicken
Well you can cut copper blocks to get 4 cut copper blocks, so it can still be a high amount.
Impulse just in the corner fighting the wither with 24 golems in hardcore lol.
In season 7 he said that he'd work on diagonals that season... In season 8 he was working on filling up space... Now he's working on colors... he's becoming the ultimate builder...
I wonder whether it's possible to kill the end dragon too with iron golems..?
@Grean thet base is a shoe
It's a llamansion
why do you always change the ending music?
Thank you grian for uploading this today it’s my birthday and this funny video has made it even better
tango has a copper farm A MASSIVE ONE
2 things to be proude of one he organized 2 HE DID THE BACK OF THE HOUSE!!!
Good luck
.
Hermitcraft  9 already
the wither is already so easy that it doesnt matter if theres iron golems or not, just a waste of resources
Idea: why don’t you use a wither to farm deepslate by luring it just like you did in this video? You can collect the deepslate it destroys and at the same time farm nether stars. Then you can sell both
All those pies remind me of the Television series Pushing Daisies, with the Pie Hole and all. I recently rewatched it and it's just so... good. And as you are the Pie guy, You will need the eyebrows of a pie maker..
It looks like an elf's shoe...  Why is Grian living in Scar's shoe?
"Now the things is a lot of Hermits are doing villagers"
It is my house
I think no one does the iron golem thing because it is so expensive. Plus I once made a huge army of dogs and did it and it was super effective
I love hermincraft
kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk "putter" meio sus
For the Entity you should make big trees around it so it looks like a wooded area
Love the new base! But… it has a tail and I can’t unsee that
Someone needs to put a yellow beak on the starter base because it’d be the perfect wizard duck!
I absolutely adore copper
10:23 *scoffs in Wadzee*
Golden star for organizing⭐️
Hey Grian I know that you never used the storage system you built in season 7, but if you make a smarter storage system like the one Impulse built in season 7, I think you would definitely appreciate the usefulness of a real storage system. It is fairly complicated to set up, but you could always hire someone to build it. Hope this helps!
you could make an iron farm that also produces nether stars!
14:55 I'm so proud that he managed to finish the back ;)
The house looks like a magic shoe, but I like it :]
Use golems to kill withers all the time on tangos patreon server.
I’m only 2 minutes and 30 seconds in, but you should have build a little house area onto the entity! It could have been so cool.
I was just proud he did the back of the build.
5:47 grian had to spoil it in shorts, didnt he
Leave it to grian to make diroite look good
I Drank Tangos blood whilst watching this ⊙_⊙
you should sell weathered copper because a lot of people can't be bothered to wait themselves
The copper will oxidize quicker if you put some fully oxidized blocks in the wall.
People put the wither under the end portal with golems around it for a long time now, it's been used in hermitcraft as well.
Use custom heads to pretend to spawn withers and scare the other hermits?
Mining with withers up next?
Your boulder  is not as big as my Minecraft boulders
He could have made a small cottage on the Boulder, and used all the items and blocks he is selling to make it.
No offense but grians base looks a little bit like a boot
Your house looks like a teapot
"It's not pootah it's puttah" most british thing i have ever heard
So this is where that short came from
Sorted storage and a base that has all it's sides finished from the beginning, this is going to be a wild season
Love the tip and tricks!
GRIAN says he’s a pie guy, then clips to the next screen with pork chops missing
nice boot you build :) where is the 2nd one?
You guys should make an origins server.
I'm pretty sure creepers are the opposite of sustainable, Grian
A little offended that there wasn't the proper "Gooooodbye" farewell at the end.
I was proud it had a back first time building >.>
what if you made a cave under the entity for your base and call it the anti-ty
Grian: You had a proposal that will take this to .... Me: the stratosphere? Grian: the next level. Me: oh... Tango: The stratosphere Me: ! He said the thing! :0
I was in pain when he said nobody on hermitcraft did this but impy did it lol
I haven't beaten the wither yet so ima try that technique
literally applauded when he showed the organized chests
Can you PLEASE make a hidden base in Scar`s base?
Anyone notice that frames are better
I am 56 and am addicted to minecraft. BTW Grian ImpulseSV has done the Golem thing too *giggles*
All I can think about the base: it is a duck!!!  (minus the beak)
you should try terraforming the area around the entity as a way to step out of your comfort zone. Maybe even try to get some tips from the other players.
Grian... My dude. Your house looks like a Duck, a Mallard, ir a Drake. Take your pick.
If stupid is your default then you should call stupid dumb grain
Why people don't use iron golems when fighting withers  people don't make iron golems when fighting withers very offten because potions and golden apples make you basicly unkilable. Also iron blocks can be used to make a beacon and a lot of people would rather have 4 blocks of iron then an easier wither to beat. But it isn't a bad idea, maybe people will find it more useful on bedrock. From what I hear wither on there is much stronger
IS THAT THE DX7 SLAPPER 😱😱 😂😂
Guys, is Grian aware that Mumbo can wax the copper before him?
Should make a starter base in the hole created by the wither.
Etho farms withers by spawning them under the end exit portal and having multiple iron golems attack them. But that's the only time I've ever seen someone use iron golems on withers before.
When is season 13
The withered iron golems were playing a little tune 🎶
Ya know, Grians base is a big L
14:55 omg i could have sworn he was gonna talk about the back
Is there a back? 🤣
I don’t understand why they all put copper apart to age, does it matter if they have spaces between them? Grian!?
17:01 scar caught lacking
Ayyyeee I actually saw that same insta post a few days ago!!!! I was going to build it myself and probably will still but I’m SO excited to know that you also saw the post and liked it enough to do smthn with it too. Also the iron golems are brilliant?? People might not use them because it’s really expensive though. Great video! I can’t wait to see more <3
Grian... I'm sorry, but your start house looks like a dog
If mumbo would wax this whole wall... The best Prank Ever.
is it just me or does that house look like a dog
14:15 trademark grian house face lol
"I'm a pie guy." Grian, 2022
why can't we join the server ??????? we want
looks like a shoe
yo, villagers are NOT THAT BROKEN, someone tell Grian and others, I made a tiny tutorial specially for hermits, it's gonna be EASY to manipulate villagers
9:55 Actually a Finnish YouTuber by The name of: Lakko Did this exact same thing a wile Back
Cool to see someone use the not-fully-oxidized copper blocks.
Im sure you saw this in impulseSV hardcore world 😏
When he said he was going to get e beacon i half expected it to cut to mumbos base
scar is thief
The man who lived in a shoe
He lives in a shoe.. who gets the other
Can I join hermit craft
can’t pull an Iskall on a Scar, Grian.
Ever thought about making an unimpressive and semi-clunky starter base so you feel incentivised to move out eventually?
After watching the wither in the deep slate, I wonder if you can dig a long 1x2 tunnel (as tall as your player) and attract a wither down the entire tunnel. This could farm deep slate as well as open up hidden ores, such as your wither did with the diamonds. This tunnel might need to be 2x2, but I'm not entirely sure. To pick up deep slate, you might need another player to tag along, or run into the wither and occasionally pick up drops. If you do this, bring milk, golden apples, and healing potions in case you get affected by the wither or are low on health.
Everyone knows to use golems for the wither 🙄
15:00 Im so proud of you :D XD
Omg you storage organise are you really Grian
14:51 I straight up thought he was running around to the other side to show us that the back was done
uhh.. grain , beacon shop .....?
Grian your house kind of looks like a dog - the little hook/swirl thing connected to the lower roof looks like a tail and the tower part looks like a head
what im proud of is that there is a back :D
I think the reason no one does that is because It can be Expensive... That would be a lot of Iron so it's kind of later game
11:22 You're right Grian, having means for a mob Farm during the day IS super sustainable
For Grian: If you hold right click with your water bucket you land it 99% of the time :) so instead of clicking or spam clicking hold right click  for anyone else struggling too ^^
SUS
omg your base looks like a cat!
It looks like a llama. I love it
I have killed the wither with iron golems before in bedrock it was nice
You should name the base “the rock”
We're more proud of the fact that your base has a back tbh.
Yes
Dog House
Congrats Grian on making your starter base not look like face this time. Now it's just a cat.
Grian you could do a blaze farm. I think Mumbo Jumbo did a blaze farm tutorial at some pointe? And youer house is looking like a dog or cat you decide!
Grian your house looks like a dog wearing a wizard hat
grian stopping right before showing the village stuff is like the teacher pausing the movie in the worst time
Thanks for making videos more frequently!
No obe does this because no one wants to waste iron to get a nether star when there are simpler and easier ways
He was talking about what we’re gonna be proud of him because I thought it was that he completed the back
I think the base looks like a dog personally
when grian ran to show us what we would be proud of i really thought he was showing us the back of the base xD
15:20 WHO ARE YOU? AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH GRIAN?
Hey Grian! I was just wondering that are you going to start a new Tag this season too? Tegg was amazing so I look forward for the next Tag!!
Love the vids bro😊😊
Omg I love it the organization 😯😯
Bring it in, Bring it in, good talk, Bring it in, Bring it in, What else can I doooo~~~ .....          nice wither fight
The house is gorgeous Grian!! I love the gradients and the details that you've put in, your skills as a builder have clearly improved overtime and I can't wait to see what will come next! Over the seasons, you've become more adventurous as a builder, getting more creative by yourself as well as learning from your friends and I really admire that. You were more of a medieval/rustic builder before Hermitcraft and made a giant spacey futuristic tower in season 6, took on a massively detailed 2-block diagonal mansion in season 7, built an enchanting and colorful alleyway in season 8, and now this eldritch-adjacent tree and this starter house(which can I say, fit with both Scar's and Pearl's bases very well, so that's whom I'm assuming you've taken a lot of inspiration from ;p)! I can see the evolution and I'm just so excited!!  The fact that you'll try to fully live in your mega base (as you said in ep1) is something that I look forward too as well. I could feel your aversion to doing the back of the mansion that was exacerbated by the fact that the mansion was mainly empty and you barely spent time in the upper floors where the back can be seen. And it probably hurt you a bit (well, it hurt me a bit ;p) to leave the Griangotts banks interior unfinished when you already cleared a massive area for it and it was what you were super excited for as a place to live in with a(nother) giant chest area. I'd like to think that I understand why both of these bases turned out how they did, and that just makes me even more excited because I know you'll learn from the past and outdo yourself even more, especially since season 9 will not be a short season. I hope you can tie your mega base plan with the Entity lore (hehe) somehow and fully wow us with the story you come up with and how you'll fill the place up!  Your videos always bring a smile to my face, I hope you gain as much joy from making them as we all do from watching them <3 <3
I like how the golem strat is completely overpowered, but people still don’t do it because of how easy the Java wither is already
You can just spawn the wither under ender thing where ender dragon lands and he will sufficate to death
Grian's Great Studitorium (storagium)
Why oh why did you not use a blast furnace?
It looks like a shoe
Impulse being Grians trend setter this episode, defeating the wither with golems and making a huge villager hall with a raid farm
he did the back!!!!!! it's so rare
Im more proud of the fact that this house had a back on it.
Them: there is no proof the golems are actually going to work.  Me, an intellectual who watches YouTube shorts: ... about that. [British accent] but it's sårt uff expensive
15:15 Who is this Grian? What have you done to the real one???
He did the back this time
Your stuff is organized? WHERE DID YOU PUT GRIAN AND WHO ARE YOU?!?!?!
Bring iron ingots next time!
If they want to kill it like that you can just bug it in to bedrock in end or nether and not waste iron blocks.
If someone doesn't put a bill on the front of this duck house, I have no faith in the Hermits....
grian: *dosnt organize items and has no starter base*  me: calm  also grian: *makes starter base with finished back and organized storage*  me: PANIK
Grian: "Alchemist House" Me: "Jesters Shoe"
go buy impulse's golden carrots
“starter base”  *STARTER BASE*       (crying)
Is it just me or is it when you comment on a video you expect someone to subscribe to you.
Yes finally tutorials
It's been done before 🤡
You should check out Pxlriffs copper aging factor from Empires SMP. It placed the copper out then collected it for you to mine. If you're going to sell copper, probably worth it.
I wonder if he saw the Golem strat from Grian's short, would be cool if they did a collab
Emergency meeting!     He did the back of the base!
Nxt u do this try putting hopper on the ground for the items that fall😉😉😉
"the entity spoke to me" people who play Dead by daylight are sweating right now
New time-lapse music is a bop
Posted. On. My birth minute… thats amazing
“Im going to sell copper” said false, grian, scar, and tango
I love how we get to watch every hermit one by one as they upload
In my opinion copper blocks are way too hard to obtain, especially because copper’s main use is for building.
15:12 I'm not sure that will last the whole season... 👀
Grian and Scar, what a combination of talent, humor, and friendship. They could just fish for a whole episode, chatting the whole time, and I'd still enjoy viewing! When they are building, pulling shenanigans, traveling, mentioning future plans; it just multiplies the enjoyment for everyone. I really appreciate this episode. Thank you Grian!!! <3 ~respect
He is a British pie gut (instead of American pie)
do i foresee a beacon shop!!! (also can someone put a bill on grians duck house)
LOL on my home server I have a HUGE pie farm and that's all we ever eat on it.
22:30 Im just imagining a loud kissing sound effect; Idk why
Make your skin the wither so your head can be a skeleton skull and then put it on soul sand for a prank
But did he do the back?
Why use golems to kill the Wither when you could just use the wither to mine for netherite and then hit it with a smite 5 swords 12 times-  2 in 1 strats
“Pies are horrible nutrition wise and have low saturation, BUT that means you get to eat more pies” 😂
Grian: Everyone would use iron golems if they worked!  Everyone: ???
if you look at grian's starter house from the start of the roof and up... it kind of looks like a shoe, not just any shoe either, a pointy elf shoe.
Who are you and what have you done with Grian!
Grian: Im a pie guy Me: than why did the porkchop go from 32 to 30???
Yes just yes
I hope the entity "speaks" more to grian, and he just becomes a cultist of the entity
from the side the house kinda looks like a dog
Add tons of chickens for wither roses.
Grian make a blast furnace it's faster
When he said you’re going to be proud of me, I really thought he was going to talk about finishing the back
Suggestion for the entity if you somehow could: the warden makes a heartbeat noise as well idk if u could
I jumped too when he placed the third head😰  On my Server i have 20 golems placed (with shears ready to activate them = carve the pumpkin) I call them A.R.G, anti raid golems  :D
I’m sorry but your starter base looks like there’s snakes which reminds me of slitherin XD
the shoe
houseboat in the river
Why not just get the wither under the end portal?
whut did you do to grian
Grian slowly turning into scar, he just needs to die more lol
Elf shoe.
Wait.. The back is finished?
After a long day of school this is the best to watch!
Grians house looks like an elf boot
Shoe base
That iron golem thing costs 180 IRON!! Is that amount of any sense to pay ??!
YAY ITS MY BIRTHDAY AND THIS WAS POSTEDD ON MY BIRTHDAY GRIAN IF YOU SEE THIS YOU ARE MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER!
Question. Why is there a crafting table on the roof?
The entity= the rock
Grian, the reason people don’t use iron golems is probably because it’s easier to suffocate it under bedrock
Tag 3: Electric Jubilee
Logs 2 electric boogaloo
I predict that the boulder is going to expand until it swallows the house before the season ends.
Am I the only one to who both the storage house 16:40 and The Entity 16:45 looks like Different types of shoes?
Make an emerald  waterfall
Finall, Grian did a base and did the back. I am so proud. Mumbo is proud that Grian organized Scar is s proud that Grian didn’t kill him Viewers are proud the he made the back
The new storage house reminds me of “The Little Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe” story.
14:56 I thought he was gonna say the back of the house
You said you were not Making a starter base
ORGANIZED?!?!?!?!??!
Your should do the wither fight on XBox it is harder then PC.
Why not call the shop "Dwayne the shop johnsson"?
I DEMAND YOU to upload more hermitcraft
I’m enjoying the NTT arc so far and the little build demo was good too :)
WHO ARE YOUUUUU, Guys the back is done it is not! Grian!
they dont do it bc they can just glitch it under the end portal part where you go through to go home
Grian's Starter Base Looks like Scar's hat in Season 8 😂
14:55 I'm more proud that the back is complete.
what if you just... expand your starter base, to MAKE your starter base your mega base? It would be cool.
I'm not impressed with your organisation I'm impressed that you did the back
I've seen polarexrextra do the withers but on bedrock
Both grian and scar organised their chests? This really is a weird season
G: I am doing something stupid.  Me: (Grinning evilly while eating blue chips) Continue.
Am i the only person who thinks that the house looks like a Shoe
Why not make a chained platform hanging from the top of the entity as like a mini base
(Everyone does this)
possibly getting lore because of when grian was talking about the house/ entity connection!!! so hyped lmao!!!
The reason why nobody does that is because if you already are killing wither, you're at the point where you have smite sword
Put a house on the top of the entity
Damn we got build school 2022
Tell me you have not watched ImpulseSV hardcore series without telling you have not watched ImpulseSV's hardcore series.
Nice landing
YOU SAID “I think I’ll just crack right on to the mega base” AND THE TITTLE IS MY STARTER BASE
1:20 Joseph Joestar is that you ?!!
13:27 okay but that new timelapse 70’s music is actual fire 🔥
Leave a like whoever supports my idea. Hey Grian, Great video love it, Mainly Scar dieing. I have an idea for your shop,  how about you make the boulder as main planet/sun with various moon/planets(made of stuff you are selling) around it. Can I get a shoutout for my channel  'MSM2005'.
I like how joe’s just panicking about the wither in the chat.
Grian has actually gone insane now. He's talking to rocks eveeryone
“I’m not sure if this will work.” Said Grian, after making a video the previous day showing that it works.
grian beeing minecraft bob ross from 15:47 to 18:10
5 minutes in and I suddenly understand the short he posted a day or two ago PFFT
That house looks like a llama! If even has a tail! Season 7 HEP flashbacks
8:26 maybe because on stone it would be easier to the wither to destroy blocks? Dunno
impullse used irongolems to beat the wither as well
It looks like a shoe
0:39 nah its not that good tbh , u need to pick it up *STRAIGHT AWAY* To be a MASTER PRO , MLG
Am I the only one getting the little old lady that lived in a shoe vibes on grians starter home.
are you insalting patric
3:12 Master Grian. There are too many of them. What are we going to do?
I just keep thinking of the iron golem short at 5:47
Oh so you're a pi(e) guy? name every decimal (⌐▀͡ ̯ʖ▀)=/̵͇̿̿/’̿’̿̿̿ ̿ ̿̿
Didn't the hermits used to do this all the time in one of the previous season? They'd stick the wither below the portal, and kill it with like 2 golems.
The montage music sounds like the security breach song
Also great video
The reason no one uses iron golems on java is because the java wither is too easy to make it worth the iron
You can use snowballs to kill blazes when they overwhelm you
You can probably use the wither for strip mining
Grein u said that there would be no more storage last season
I spent like 10 seconds trying to figure out why the wither didn't explode when it died
You forgot to say “gooooood bye”
GRIAN I HAVE A QUESTION
15:43 where the hell did those trapdoors come from
Uvuvwevwevwe onyetenvewve ugwemubwem ossas
Grian, when in the nether fighting blaze, fire res potions are very handy
10:20 impulse did it (i believe in season 7
you know ,when you said that we're gonna be proud of you i expected you to say that you had a backside to your starter but hey post-poning the inevatable chest monster is good too
Master Skywalker there too many of them (too many blazes)
The base is that boot from that one story. I wonder where the old lady is?

9:54 IT S A WASTE OF IRON, that simple
Why don't you just build with copper before it oxidize and then afterwards let it oxidize was on the build and changes flex it when did that makes more sense or it might be into sensible for for logic like and when that make the village more scared and not trade with you for a little bit because sometimes I'm rage I think villagers don't trade with you when there's a way it happening or do they actually don't know.
that took a while
I absolutely love this season
14:06 Iskall is super mad
the reon why people dont use golems to kill the with is cause it is a waste of resources and it takes to long to set up
the reason everybody doesn't do that is: iron can be costly you need a lot of iron you are likely to have gotten to the end when you have the wither which gives you the ability to spawn it below the bedrock and have less of a chance of dyeing.
golems are quite expensive
7:25  5% chance huh ? D&D players knows this is a lot
10:00 all the golem are broken and withered and one of them is unharmed and fully repaired and he be like: yeah yeah I helped sure of course
All I see is an elf boot
FNAF: Purple Guy Grian: Pie Guy!
Episode 1 Grain: I am going to do something silly Episode 3 Grain: that was a silly idea I changed my mind.    Grian is a good egg but he has silly ideas.
Grian should play Elden ring
Logs 2 Electric boogaloo? HMMMMMMMM???
Impulse did this in season 7
Wait how havent they gone to the village and loaded in the villagers yet if noone is supposed to know the seed?
listen to this. there's alchemist grian, and entity grain. split personalities. entity grian makes a change and alchemist grain studies it, but it's just grian's subconcions trying to make both personalities happy
Etho uses iron golems under the bedrock portal in the end...
How did grian finally learn to be orginized
Oh no  He is getting organized! XD
10:25 that was actually my strategy for when I first fought the wither cuz I was so terrified of it. It was on xbox 360 edition.
Waits already 9 i took one break to internet ands its already 9 ;-;
A grian in a boot
I'm more proud that he finished the back
they should add a pockets enchant on pants to double inventory space :D
Sounds like he’s pulling a Scar
Impulse has done the iron golem slaughter before :)
Aye, Grian! Yesterday I made your skin into a Hungarian hussar in memory of 15 March 1848 over on Skindex. Just reply to this comment if you want me to take it down! I haven't really done things like this, so I don't know what I may or may not do.
It's really cool to see a hermit getting inspired by a post on instagram, there are so many talanted builders there and I feel like a lot of them are really underrated
no goooooooood bye :(
Japanese architecture is just on another level!
Scar got caught... wait for it... RED HANDED!
Does the house look like a shoe? or is that just me. :/
I’m more proud of the fact that he did the back!
the base is a shoe...
**caught stealing items using hopper** oum... i was just expanding your storage system!
Omg he's learning lol
woopity
Pootter is an insult to that dog
Poultry man??.... Where is he??. Is he good?..
Scar: He won't ACTUALLY try to spawn the wither in my base Grian: *literally spawned a wither in the middle of boatem last season*
am i the only one who thinks the house looks like a dog  it’s also alive
They should make rain age copper faster
The reason people dont use iron golems to kill the wither is because if you set it up right, you can suffocate it under the end exit portal
Every time you feel dumb just think of TommyInnit
thanks for the tips and tricks
Good job 👏
Hi Grian I’m a big fan
Guys he did the back
With the new build limit I would love to see the 2nd build off
9:15 Look at the chat, that is kind of funny to me
Grian, Scar and villagers... Brings back season 7 memories
15:44
When he told us we were going to be proud of him, he was walking towards the back of the house so I thought he was going to show us that he did the back (which he still did)
You know how you said "This is so easy" BEFORE it reached the iron golems? That's probably why no one uses them. It's a lot of iron for something that's easy enough without them.
We are proud of you becouse you finished the back
Boot.
Ever considered getting a jump boost 2 beacon for the copper
Grian is just a brand new person..  first he  makes a base for storage, its ORGANIZED AND THERE IS NO UNFINISHED BACK This season is reveloutionary
Five bucks says Grian's organized storage doesn't last 3 episodes, any takers?
"villagers are a broken mechanic" "they take ages to set up" "but pay off in the long run"  How is it a broken mechanic then? Why do people keep saying that?
15:00 I thought he ment we where going to be proud he did the back XD
To make wither skeleton farming easier turn ur render distance down to 2 chunks then all of the mobs will be in a closer proximity to u
He just pulled 7 trap doors from thin air
Grian is becoming more epicer with storag   Also I like smooth basalt as a building bock,don't you agree?
Grian, I'm just proud you did the back :)
the house is a shoe
nobody does that strat because its way too expensive
Nobody does this because it's to expensive
The wither is so weak on Java in comparison to that it's actually kinda terrifying to me
Other Hermits: I'll label this logs 1 and logs 2 Grian: Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo
He is now living in a boot.
“Why does nobody do this” maybe because we don’t have industrial quantities of iron to spend on golems. Grian’s perception is skewed by all the time he spends in Minecraft lol
A little tip for mining, with the blocks of raw iron, gold and copper is better to just use fortune direct in the mine. Imagine you have a stack of iron ore, with fortune you will got 3 stacks at best, less in reality, thats roughly 20 blocks of compresed iron, so you can carry a lot more than using silk tocuh
Hi
I just got an idea. Could you try to mine with a wither?  You were quite safe in that corridor while you lured it towards you. What if you don't try to kill it? You could mine like you do for netherite with beds this way, but muuuch better. Please try.
I love at the beginning how he wasted so much time building 1 pillar at a time, instead of placing them in a area around him and then steadily increasing the hight by 1 which would drastically increase the speed of which these towers could be built. Or Im just a big doodoo head and Im thinking too much of a blockhead doing blockstuff
me who just prefers to do a long tunnel and melee the wither to death and not waste 20 iron blocks
The reason more people don't use golems is because most people don't play long enough to afford it
HAHAHA IM THE 1,930 COMMENTER HERE WAHAHAHA...
Putter ? No.       ✨ Pottah ✨   Am I the only one who heard that ? But GREAT VIDEO like always 🤯✨
Hi
iron golems vs wither how will win! IT IS THE IRON GOLEMS BOYS
in spanish those pies translate to beatuful feet
i saw someone else say this on a different video, so this isnt original, but flooding the entity with water would allow shoppers to move freely throughout, and could make much more room for different items to sell. They wouldn't drown either, because of the conduit :)
A very fun idea for a storage room would to make it into a "magic library" and you keep all the chests hidden behind bookshelves with a couple hoppers flowing into single chests or barrels, and the story could be that every book is a spell on creating blocks using magic.
I guess you could say Grian is a PIEoneer
if its studying the entity thrn why is'nt it facing the entity.
yes
Scar's right it does look like a cat with a witch hat
Did anyone else notice the Logs 2: Electric Bogaloo?
Grian has finally become organized
hi grian
"For the first time eeeeevvver"  Grian is organised.
lets make a copper house but not wetheatred and see how it progressed throughout episodes
Grian in episode 1: I'm not making a starter base this season because I never fully move out of it!  Grian episode 3: I'm making a starter base!
That mlg at the start of the video was perfect!!! You are going to be in the next speedrunner vs hunters video lol! 😂   Love your content man!
It looks like a shoe
I’m guessing he doesn’t know that Tango made a mega copper farm lol
Grian's starter house looks like the midpoint between a house and a cat. And this is a concept I have never considered until now.
Most people just fight withers using bedrock, either nether ceiling or under the middle end portal, much safer, easier and cheap, basically can do it armorless with a wooden sword
i love that grians idea for a base was a rock, he finally realized he needs an actual base on hermit craft.
I'm now gonna try the wither thing once I light me a portal and get the stuff for it!! Thank you I will be getting the achievement  on bedrock now!!!! Thank you so much for the idea its gonna help me a ton! Also I'm a new-ish viewer started watching at ending of season 8 and everything around that time!
Sooo the clip was from this video... Cool
GIVE THE HOUSE A BEAK ITS A DUCK
14:57  I thought he was gonna say you are going to be a proud of me because I did the back of the house😂😂
Creeper: Hello guys welcome to my minecraft lets play  Grian: HAHA FUNNY JOKE BE LIKE- ussussssyyy bakka ahooo
Was anyone else thinking "man, Grian should probably use a blast furnace"
I like how everybody is doing all natural and organic stuff... well except for Keralis of course :D
ImpulseSV AHHHH
If grian really would live under a rock i would call him Patrick (sorry)
"It's all labeled" that makes my o.c.d. brain happy
Oh My goodness he's becoming organized I'm so proud 🥲
I've learned so much from you about building.
organization... you've really outdone yourself, this time, grian
xd Log 2 electric boogaloo
I love your starter base, it looks a little like a shoe and I can't unsee it
The house looks like a boot...I love it
People don’t use iron golems to beat the wither because of how expensive they are lol  You can use the iron for so many other things
atelier grian : the alchemist and the entity
*hmhmh* definetly first raid farm definetly
I've been wanting to play more with colour in my builds too, and I get a lot of inspiration from your builds so this is going to be great! Can't wait to build alongside you in the many episodes to come!
I don't think most people can bother getting enough iron that they can just spend it all on fighting a wither
yumar___ is the name of the insperation
The cat in the hat meow purrrrr
Grian we arent proud of the lack of chest monster we are proud of you because you did the back
No one does it because the wither is so easy to cheese without, so why use a bunch of iron  You got it down to almost half just walking backwards and hitting
17:02 badtime with scar spotted
I AM PROUD OF YOU GRIAN!   lts your ✨Storter Base ✨🤍🤎💙💛❤💚💜🖤
Not gonna lie, when he said we'd be proud, I thought he was going to show us the back of the build
Grian: You're all going to be so proud Me: I know! You finished the back of the house! Grian: My storage is labeled!!! :D Me: Oh, that too
Next battle Iron Golem VS Warden
dang it an hour late
You should bring fire resistants pots when blaze hunting or the material for some.
I thought he said he won't be doing starter bases?
i feel uncomfortable when grian says “sus”
Impressed of the organisation on the chest part - yes, but even more impressed that the build actually has a back on the first go.
Im so happy how often he is uploading
Working on a Scarter base...
I want poultry man back this season 🙏
your starter-base looks like a kettle
First
Who else thinks Grian's new storage shed looks a bit like a big boot?
who else expected grian to do a scar when MLGing
very nice "starter" base
Nobody uses Iron Golems because they are too expensive.
great vid i just want to know if your in mcc
I'm sorry but it's nothing short than a shoe with a hat.
Grian is a mlg waterbucket pro know!!
people don't do the iron golem trick often because it's just easier kill it in bedrock or just fight it like normal. Usually if you can afford that iron, you're probably late game enough to get to the End
i thought he was gonna say we were gonna be proud of him for building the back. which i certainly am.
Grian, I think your starter base looks like a magical boot.
What the    No no no groan made the back off the build it can’t be true
Grain rember what u said in epsiode 1
1:10 I thought u was a professional minecrafters
When Grian said “you are going to be so proud of me,” I thought he had done the back 😂
cat
because its expensive [8:20]
This is my favorite starter base so far
For the next time just put copper in your offhand and pick in main hand and keep breaking and placing your blocks. Not as fun but waaay more efficient!
Looking at tangos farm and the tought of him not thinking that he will make money with selling copper, the though is indeed stupid.
14:32 that crafting table is a great add-on to the build, really sparks it up!
0:05 I think that was not rude, but anyways great video!
I thinner the starter base looks like a cat with a wizard hat
happy patties day
Lil hint: scar tought you were selling moss so to not add any confusion pls sell stone and moss
I swear I can see at the end of the series the entity becomes a rock monster and Grian said it’s living so if it grew and like every one had to fight it and it ends the server then we get a little joke at the end like last season that would be sick
"I dont even know if iron golems attack withers"  7 year old me who experimented with what iron golem could do: hehe boi
grian made a shoe to live in
Make a hopper system to catch the copper
He made Grian's booty into a house
Almost first
tip: removing heads is easyer with an axe
grian: lets give are self's some c     me: COVID!
15:00 we all are just happy with the fact that you made a back of the base
Finally
I have a question what would happen if SSundee joined hermitcraft
yo grian said my name
Was having a pretty bad day, this definitely cheered me up 💛
im proud you did the back
Grian : *Makes YouTube shorts* 5 iron Golem are all you need to kill the Wither  Also Grian : I don't even know if golems would help in fighting the Wither
Oh my god another season?
Make a wither farm
Took so long but great vid🔪🙃
It looks like a duck
Why does your build look like a baby laama with a wizards hat?
Very very depressed at the moment and this is a needed uplift.
The vid was released literally 50 mins ago and already 1.8k comments
Grian you have learned well. You know how to sort. Now learn more.
Love the interior decorating lesson! Gave great insight on how make the interior pop up more!
Were you mining dirt with a pickaxe
"what you're about to witness is a professional minecrafter" i really thought he was about to die at that moment then it would end with hysterical laughing *as usual* scar is a professional at dying though
OH.MY.GOD! What has happened to grian? He actually made a efficiant storage room, that must be a first. As a long time watcher of Grian, I am proud of you!
'Checks storage labels' 'Log 2: Electric Boogaloo' 'Nice'
@ 15:10  Grian: “something’s not right” Audience: “what is it” Grian: “you see that?” Audience: “No” Grian: “Exactly”
3:24 you could have brought a sheild yknow
doubt you'll see this comment with the amount that there are, but I really enjoyed you giving the building tips and kind of building along with us. I'd love to see more of that sprinkled into your vids.
М М
Grian to Scar, “Look at me….I am the wizard now”
Grian: "You are going to be proud of me" Me: "Oh my god he did the back"
Your starter base kind of reminds me of a puppy, with the tower as the head and the roof flourish at the end as a tail. You should name it something accordingly!
15:13 thought grian was about to show that he build the back xD
The reason nobody uses iron goloms is because they are ridiculously expensive
I love how you used the particularly oxidized copper to have such a cool gradient on the roof!!
3:19 master grian, there’s to many of them, what are we going to do?
Fun fact: the brazilian youtuber Viniccius13 made an AFK Wither Boss farm using Iron Golems. He has one full chest of Nether Stars at the moment
There was an old woman who lived in a shoe. You are the old woman…
Can someone explain why the wither didnt spawn? Is it a java thing because I play on bedrock Never mind I just watched the rest
You can place string on top of the warped stem to stop it growing if you want
I love hermitcraft! Grian, you should do a modded survival series
I wonder if impulse made a side bet how long it would take for scar to eat those totems.
12:40 could have just lived under the Boulder
I have used iron golems for every time I have killed the wither. Also it's listed on one of the Minecraft wikis. The deep slate also has a benefit to fighting the wither on. Typically I put the golems right above the wither spawn. Since the wither explodes it breaks the floor and the golems drop on the wither
Make a basement in the entity and just make it all organic and fleshy like
End crystals are amazing against the wither to. 5 drops him more  than half
Welcome to the duck house!
I love hermitcraft!!!!!!!!!
The killing the wither with iron golems iw as old as the wither itself, seems weird you have never seen it
20:34 guess you could say your on a PIEt
You know as people try ro put me in hail cause im me and they love prfoming hate crimes too me and interupting me and not seeing the bigger picer ect ect more nomal high achool things. This is nice whaching this. Helps me from having an hart attack
Use copper blocks in a stonecutter to get 4cut copper blocks
Grian, I am making a build similar to your season 8 base it would be a big help if you could do a tutorial on wonk.  And thank you for your videos they really bring a smile to my face
You should add some slightly smaller rocks around the entity to make it look a bit more natural and not just,   “Hey guys look at that out of place rock!”
How come you dont use a bow? Sniping is fun.
He missed the fact that we are all more amazed that our bio finished the back for once! LOL
I want to see mumbo wax all tha copper in its initial stages
Grian! To make connected chests put item frames in between them! It really adds a certain element of detail.
Your starter house looks like an old shoe... It looks good though...
Good luck making that work I am sure it will
grian you do know that impulse already made a raid farm right?
the way scar says "Hello ther!" makes him sound like an elven NPC from Oblivion or so, gotta love him! ! !
What I'm proud of is the fact that you actually did the back! Improvement!
Grian i believe wadzee killed the wither with golems
I don't think people use iron golems cause they normally fight the wither to go speed mining and don't have a lot of iron to use iron golems instead of weapons
16:44 The entitie looks like a duck 🦆🦆🦆
Is the starter base supposed to look a shoe
Idea for "The Entity": two horizontal lung shaped light blue glass fish tanks with a conduit in each on the ceiling, lower down in between the "lungs" a purple glass orb with an end crystal floating inside 🔮  (kinda like this emoji)as a heart, as a bonus you could have vein-like structures of each organ glass color holding them in place (so they are not just floating lol)
Grian’s starter base looks like a cat in a wizard hat.
May we have a victorian house tutorial please
Earliest I've been since season 7 episode 6
Giran: :you guys are going to be so proud of me. Me: You finished the back!?!?!? Grian: Their is no random junk and its all organized. me: -_-   the back... is it finished?
That house looks like a Wizard Cat :D
It’s a Skyrim home.
I really enjoyed the tricks and tips part! Hope to see more of that :D
the build looks like a dog i feel like
I thought he was gonna say we should be proud he did the back of it
0:00 looking a little sus there but I wont judge👀
“Living under a rock isn’t always a good thing…” Patrick star: 👁👄👁
10:25 I am pretty sure I've seen at least 3 hermits use iron golems for the wither
Mlg water bucket WHO NEEDS WINGS
Hi
If I had a nickel for every time I've seen someone stack up on dirt and fishing rod Scar, I'd only have 2 nickels, but it's still strange that it happened twice...
First we had Covid Then Volcanos Then WW III Now Grian with labled chests...  Guys, the end of the world is coming
i want the next episode more then ever now! i want to see the super teamwork they are going to build
Omg this was made 46 minutes ago!
Grian has a chest labelled "Precious Pies." You could almost say he's... pie-ous?
16:36 You see alchemist/magician house, I see a boot.
Scar looks like Alex Kid from the old sega games :-)
This is shaping up to be one of my favorite seasons of HC already! Thank you guys!
Me mememememememememememmememememememememememememememememememememeemmemememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememememmeemememememememememememememememememmememememememememememememememememememmemememememememememmemememememememememememememememmmememememememememememmememememememememememememememmemememememememememememmemememeemememmememememememememememememememememememememememem lol long stupid comment.
Grian, it look like a boot.
Your house looks like a shoe. Is the entity going to grow legs?
He's the little old lady who lived in a shoe
I know he has done stuff like this in the past, but I would love to see Grian do a more updated building tips and tricks series since Minecraft has gotten so many more blocks since those videos were made
Grian lives in a boot.
*pat* *pat* good boy grien not only you got organized but also did the back I'm proud :3
the fact the its taking 3 hermits to do what impulse is doing just show how insane this is gonna be
Joe is probably like: Please someone respond
I guess you could say he is quite Pi(e)ous...
who are you and what have you done with Grian?
The new house is a dog
Grian… organised?
selling bread would be a genius idea but what would he build onto the Entity for it? a bunch of hay blocks?
Who are you give us our grian back
Pretty sure impulse used golems
Hi
I bet you by either next episode or episode 10 the chest monster returns
Grian has now built a chicken and an egg
No grian... I'm proud of you doing the back of it.
Grian should make some ender chests
umm i hate to say it but thats not a base......thats an elf shoe dude.. your basically the old lady that lived in a shoe
Make a bread section of your bolder and call it grians grains idea for milkshake draws
Its almost like building school🤧
It’s Wednesday my dudes! 22:06
I really like that house! Also, this probably wasn't intentional, but it kind of looks like an animal of some kind.
You should put a giant, telescope aiming at the boulder from your house :)
I just finished the 2nd episode then you posted
Your not so starter base looks like a Llama without a snout
Letts hope this season dos not finesh like last season
you should make a Japanese village for a mega base
"The fact that you are all gonna be proud of is that it is all labeled" Actually, no. The fact we are all proud of is that you made the back.
I'm not proud of the labels or the chests being moved indoors. I'm proud there are 4 complete walls.
I hate how calm they all stay killing in the nether. No amount of blocks placed for my safety can just make me just chat and chill in the nether.
just wait grian is organized now but give it 1-3 episodes and the chest monster is back xd
Am I the only person who would be interested in seeing Grian play terraria
Btw it only takes 2 iron golems to get it, 3 to guarantee it
I don't know about you but the house looks like a snake or a Chinese dragon to me(might as well put some eyes on it)
grian sorts stuff? I M P O S S I B L E
It is just like chores 2:42
Am I the only one that sees the rock looks like lapize
I hope the next episode is going to drop like 3 days later because the ending got me wery excited
GRIAN TAURTIS IS BACK!!!!
Grain every time  you do something to Mumbos  base he is gonna  bone meal your shop lol so u might want to keep an eye out
This starter base is beter than my extual base
Dear Grian, I challenge you to make a stunning interior in your main base this season
Alright but is deepslate mining the fastest when you use a Wither? That could be the new strat
I noticed your chest monster had disappeared from outside, but when you said you sorted it all, my jaw dropped. 4 seasons of HC and you finally are trying to sort your items? (S7 doesn't count cause he didn't use it much)
I'm, proud of you Grian, you finally have organization, lol
e
grian the conduit provides water breathing so I think you should consider making your shop underwater
Someone needs to start a stock market in hermitcraft
At 15:10 I thought Grian was about to show that there is no holes in the backside of the house =D
Me: watching the time-lapse: oh ,grian is building scars shoe. After watching the time-lapse: oh , nevermind idk what this beautiful boot has become.
not quite early gang
Grian, your smelting technique is great and all with the hoppers but please just make a blast furnace 😭
11:22 sus
He just copied gem on the base theme
Don’t forget for the trading hall if you use the infect/cure method that BOTH of you need to cure them individually for you both to get the trade discounts
Elves Shoes Storage house?
The new base looks a lot like a dog!
Grian that's not allowed you cant be organized
14:55 Thought you were gonna go around and show us a finished back side
Love your videos
Dude how did you learn to build like that! My house is like nothing now! LOL! StateLeader would love the MLG stunt in the beginning!
LoL... Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo
Grian built.... A shoe.
Grian... you defenetly lost a substancial ammount of the copper
Grian, I loved your time laps music last season, do you think you could bring it back, Thank you :)
If you want you can make a small dock on the back of your starter base
Grain lives in a boot lol :)
grain: uses ore to get copper tango: " casual"
I'm super interested in how this villager thing is going to turn out. I love seeing hermits take in projects together for mutual benefit like this
Everyone: Grian is one of the best minecraft builders in the world!!  Grian: Wow.. I really love this *shoe* that is going to be my starter base
Can't wait to see the entity at the end of the season, that will be an amazing world download for everyone to enjoy!
I miss Grian's high pitched "Go!"
Pretty sure we are just proud that u did the back lol.
Also you should add in more boulders around the shop because it looks Kinda Lonely on its own
Omg guys the starter base… ITS ACTUALLY GOT A BACK
Call Grian
March 14th was International Pi Day
LUV YOU GRIANNNNNNNNN!!!
Did anyone else saw Grian throw away an iron Pickaxe at 5:12? I mean, he has Diamond tools so he doesn't need it anymore, but I was wondering if that was an accident or not
You guys should make your villager farm look like a giant or a bunch of mushrooms
the New base looks like a wizard boot!
Viniccius13 is a brazilina minecraft youtuber, and he made a wither boss farm using iron golens
Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Grian: I am STRICTLY a pie guy, I can’t eat pork  10 seconds later: 31 out of 32 pork remaining
14:50 it's a duck without its beak. Make a beak, Grian!
Proud to be in the first 200k people to watch this
I'm more impressed that Grian did the back😹
Grian should make the top of the house an enchanting room or a place for brewing potions
grian: you guys are going to be so proud of me me: you did the back? grian: there's no random junk! me: oh..
there are so much easier, cheaper, simpler ways to kill the wither that is why no one uses iron golems for killing withers
so now we know why grian made that wither killing short
In season 7, you made your base on ep. 1  In season 8, you made your base on ep. 2  In this season, you made your base on ep. 3  Hopefully, in season 10, you made your base on ep. 4!
Impuls has used golems before to defeat the wither
I Said gran on Purpose
We are gonna sell copper.  Next episode : we are gonna need to get a lot of copper for this project You're a legend mate. From Australia
Insperation Love ya vid😘
Good thing now we know we don't need 20+ golems like Impulse XD
Why do no hermits use the blast furnace or smoker? They cut the time down to smelt/cook substantially
11:18 something uhh ohh uuu lol
Sometimes in the end under the portal where you can cheese the wither people put golems theretoo
Why does the base look like a lama with a hat
meant as a compliment but uhhhh,,, the house kinda looks like a boot, but honestly i love because it goes with the fairy like/whimsical theme of scar's tree and the builds surrounding it :)
Your house looks like the old lady's shoe house
Really excited to see you try new things in terms of colour and story with your builds this season! I feel like the recent updates, and the upcoming ones, really add a lot more options for that sort of stuff, so it'll be great to see what you do with it! The starter house looks great btw, definitely pinching the gradient colour scheme
You spoiled pearlescentmoons build xd
Hey the code for mumbos  vault is: top left, middle, bottom left. Take a sneek peek grian... sorry mumbo
Impulse used the iron golems in he’s hardcore world i was thinking it wouldn’t work
its a pie-oneer!
Viniccius13 making a farm of withers using golens
we used that on x's server. Trapping them under the end portal golem to end them auto
When Grian said we would be proud of him, I was sure it was going to be because he built the back!
Grian you should sell houses in the entity like deeds to land for like 32 diamonds.
Grian yet again proves that he can, in fact, build       (love how you did it in scar's over-exaggarated kind of style)
It looks like a wizards head stuck on a building with a cats tail. Maybe a spell that went wrong haha
A house of a magician should be mysterious; you should put some red stone tricks that have like potion effects where random stuff happens like a secret staircase appears and there’s a special effect from a potion. I just think that’d be really cool to have stuff like that
grian :0
hes not a grian anymore, he is a  3,14rian :)
I was proud you finished the back
I prefer calling the boulder "Dwayne"
grian it is 6 in the morning for me, i havent slept yet, but at least im kinda early :)
Hi
The house looks like a jester boot lol
Oh no, he has not chance to be competitive against tango
New vidoe
will the barge come back? at least the water in front of the bolder would most surtenly be a great place for a barge light or something... maybe for aquatic based items? it was planed to come back in season 8, wasn't it?
You can live under the entity! and be a person who lives under the rock🤣🤣
Why did u left impulse out of the plan :( he has the super natural raid farm made bringing him in ur plan will be sooo great ;)
Amazing video!
🌈   get your color on
Grian is a pi-onier
I think a little something was added to those pies….
Those trapdoors look like chocolate bars.
HOW DARE YOU LABL GRAN
Did Grian just become the little old lady that lives in a shoe?
Hey Grian, you could sorta attach your house to the boulder shop, making it as if you are taking part of the terrain and the newly built house as a way to grow your business.  Edit: So here are some ideas, to the boulder side of your house you do a more medieval fantasy styled market area, to the back and underground it'd be your farms and themed builds to enhance the whole build.
It took 3 episodes to make a stater house
P0G
you live in a shoe grian! congrats
Any other 30yr old fathers who started playing minecraft with their kids now finding their selves addicted to this series. Grian, mumbo, scar, pearl. Look forward to every single episode lol
My heart stopped when grian placed that 3rd skull
your house looks like a boot
hey grian i really love the roof design of your "starter base", i have a suggestion tho you could maybe swap the lanterns for the soul lanterns like the blue ones
looks like the one from last season
Am I the only one who was yelling at the fact he wasn't using a shield to fight the blazes???
Anyone know the post Grian got ispired by? Would love to see it
HeLLO
Why is it 1 ep per 5 days
the starter house looks so good!
To Me it honestly looked like a boot or a shoe
you know something is wrong when grian is being silly
Grian killing the wither is very easy it doesn’t matter
There was an old Grian who lived in a shoe....
Claim your~~> before 1 hour  ticket 🎫
Anyone else seeing that house as a shoe?
ngl fWhip would make for a good hermit
19:06 you dont need to wax a copper block every time you place one, you can put the copper in the crafting table along with some honeycomb and it will all be waxed
Hey if you create pop up shops then you should design them like the entity dug it’s roots into the ground and sprung up as flowers or trees depending on what you are selling
There is even a better way to take down the wither  It includes going to another roof and like suffocating it into the bedrock and you can even do it when you have no armor you take no damage
Very proud of the organization 👏
Can we make Grian the pieonier man?
How about you spawn the wither in the nether and blow it up with beds like the ender dragon
Someone warn Mumbo.. Grian is talking to rocks and he needs to be supervised
Been watching since season 6 Ep 1. Season 6 and 7 were the best but unfortunately I lost interest in season 8 so lets see with season 9
Your Storage House Looks Like A Dog
I've been using iron golems to kill the wither for years and always wondered why people struggled with it 😅 TIL this wasn't a well known strat
The base looks like a cat with a wizard hat And it looks really good
Grian is a witch confirmed
You may say that living under the rock is a bad idea, but if it was a bad idea then why would Patrick live under a rock
I love the storage that Grian created but is it just me or does it look a bit like a magical boot
Not far from 8mil
"An alchemist lives in this house" ~ Grian, talking about the boot.
ahoy grian
Your base reminds me of a wizards base so your a wizard grian
i love how grian tries out new things every season
is that house a goat
Impulsesv has done the wither with golems....
and also if you built your house on the entity you would have to start selling houses and those would be a pain to collect
It’s okay Grian, I’m stupid too.
Did anybody else get a 'little old woman who lives in a shoe' vibe for the starter home?
You can stand on my face if you want grian, dont worry
Ngl its kinda annoying that they build insane builds 3 episodes in
I think Grian should take a break, he is talking with rocks now...
It looks like a beakless gosse in a wizard hat and cape
The reason we don't do this with the wither because it's expensive
The entity thing still seems kinda wierd to me because i did entity lore with my friend about 3 years ago
your new house looks like a boot
big fan of you walking us through your building and the tips and tricks you use.
I imagine most people don't fight the wither with golems because that's 30 blocks of Iron that you're loosing to get just one wither star. Unless you have a strong iron farm in your world, this method is incredibly unpractical.
14:55 I really thought he was going to show us the back to say he finished it lol
We dont use iron golems bc its not worth the cost of the iron golems because its way easier to just use it
11:50 Most organized I've seen grian  Edit: wait nevermind I didn't watch enough. The ENTIRE HOUSE is the most organized I've seen grian
The starter base looks good.
15:12 Where's Grian and what have you done with him?!?!?!
Love the house. Totally get the “old lady who lives in a shoe” vibe.
I guess you didn't watch Impulse hardcore series... he did loads of golems and didn't even get a hit in before it was dead
You could have made your starter "house" a series of tents as if you were an archeologist on site of The Entity studying it. And you could infect the ground with podsol or glow lichen or later skulk.
1 hour club!!! Grian ,will there be a shopping district this season? that is definitely something I’d want to see happen again.
Does anyone else see the little old lady who lived in a shoes 👞 house?
14:56 I thought you were gonna show us that the back was finished 😭😭
hi Grian loved the episode as usual but just a suggestion y dont u try to do anothe 3rd life series it was rly fun whatching those
I am so going to use this golem method to fight the wither. Thanks for the advice.
Your saying iron golems wrong. It's pronounced iron gohlem.
anyone else thinks it looks like hes living in a boot?
Who stole grians YouTube channel,account and voice from 15:00 to 17:30
Hey honey what are you doing? Oh just setting up a VILLAGER FARM. Cool!
Giannn hi...... XD
No offense, but why do you guys even build starter bases and houses?  You're never there.  LOL
16:10 return off grians building school
I have an idea for the villager trading centre, basically, a minecart takes a zombie villager into a little box and then exits out of the box unseen. Then the exact time the zombie goes in a villager comes out. And the tracks just go round in circles so the whole thing just starts again.
is it just me or does the starter base looks like a mutated duck (tower being the head and neck).
There is bird poop on your house
He actually did the back, and nobody is saying anything? Whats wrong with you people
Since the world is a lot smaller, I think that you and the other hermits should try make a massive underground cave that is all connected. You can each work on a chunk or something like that and then entent it every couple of episodes.
please live in the bridge between island
honestly the iron golem thing is kinda smart. Although I just cheese it by spawning the wither under the portal in the end and trapping it
Grian: Why does no body do this? Me: Been doing it for a long time. Safest and fastest way. However it is not as Bravado, so it's not as popular to show and tell.
Hear me out lol... the back of scars house has a pair of windows that looks like a pair of eyes... is this not a great location for a certain moostache? 👨
Please sell spyglasses and put googly eyes on the entity. Pleeeeeeeeeeeas.
I expected a lot of things, but GRIAN MAKING A PROPER STORAGE SYSTEM is the most unbelievable thing in my entire life!
Grian we are praud of you
grian, giving out building advice while making hermitcraft videos is really helpful, tnx
Ooo
I'm more impressed he finished the back of a build for a base in one episode.
I’m waiting for the meme of the similarity between min 9 to 10 and one of encanto song’s from Disney 🤣
I was just starting to feel bored..
I need one of the villagers to be named Agatha.    Don’t ask questions.
Please keep giving tips on building. (I suck)
The outside of your base looks like a dog
11:30 is nobody gonna talk about this?
Grian I have just came a with a proffesion name for the the person who lives in your starter base. "mapothylyzer" Magician + apothecary + anlyzer  The reason is that the base and the entity is very related to magic so magician. And for some reason it feels by the theme of your base the person living in it is in someway related to medicines which goes to  apothecary (synonym for chemist) and cause its analysing the entity so analyser.
Why is the house a slug? Although I’m not complaning
You should try roblox Grian. It would be hilarious 😆
Grian: "this build is supposed to look like some kind of alchemist lives here" My immediate though: "there was an old Grian who lived in a boot"
15:00 Grian: Do you notice anything?            Me: Ah, I see you have finally made the back of the starte....            Grian: There is no chest monster.            Me(in frustration):My man doesnt even recognise that he finally did the back of a building after entire seasons of leaving the back for the end.
PRAISE THE ENTITY!
Anyone else get excited that grian "did the back" and then he goes guess what I did??? like look guysI don't have any random junk.
14:55 I thought you were gonna show how you did the back of the base
umm scar, "what do they taste like?"
Grian: "It is all labeled!" Me: Who are you and what have you done with Grian?
Living under a rock is not a good idea? I think Patrick the starfish would disagree with ya.
Gave a like specifically for the organization, great job!!
The new house needs a duck bill 🦆
Starter base looks like a Shoe xD
I am pretty sure grian's favorite hobbie in hermitcraft is trying to give scar a heart attack
11:18 eughAUGHEAAoah how-
Whats Yumar@?
As soon as Grian and Scar spawn the wither everyone in chat is panicking xDD
this came out at a perfect time mental breakdown check
The house looks so like an Elf's boot. Unintentionally it fits the elf's theme.
My reason as to why I don't use iron golems to fight the wither:                                                                                                                  Huge lack of iron(as big as the gap)
When he said look what I did, I thought he was gonna say he built the back of it.
Finally your orgnized I wounder how long will it last
Starter house looks like some wizard boot.
15:16 I'm sick of you. Give us our Grian back! He is the creator of the Chest Monster and you are a FAKE. Oh wait. Grian died. You are GriEn. Sorry, I was used to Grian being disorganized
Lol, I hope another hermit puts a nose and eyes on your house. It looks like it has a hat and a tail already.
just sell cut copper you get 4x the amount when you put it in a stone cutter
When grain and scar And tango where talking it was like a real business meeting
U should use blast furnaces
U should switch out the furnace for blast furnaces
at 14:52 i thought you were going to tell us that you did the back of the build.
someone brainwasher grain evidence at 15:00
The starter house looks sort of like a puppy with a hat.
Builds a starter base, abandons it for big project... Seems like a Grian thing to do honestly
I do remember seeing someone use a ton of golems to kill a wither recently, can't remember who tho 🤔
kinda looks like a dog
grian your copper wall can be countered so easily just by waxing the copper......BE SMAAART GRIAN!!!
Grian needs to have a little segment in the middle of each video with building tips "The art of Blocks with Grian"
I love all your videos, they are all very joyful and filled with fun, keep up the good work grian
Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo!
This season is so fun already :D the cool builds with stories, the interactions, the jokes, the chaos, it's great!
Finally
does the house remind anyone of the s8 starter house?
oh grian im so proud of you making a storage system *sniff sniff*  baby grian is all grown up now *sniff sniff*    we love you grian
you actually finished the back of your starter base. NICE🙃
14:12 ITS FROM JAPAN
i think you should have built a base under the entity but thats just me making bad puns maybe
I saw people do this in hungarian videos but not in english videos
Wither farms use iron golems to kill the wither
Hermitcraft is one big blue Peter moment  "Here's one I made earlier"
Looks like a doge with a hat lol. I like it
nice
I'm so excited for this season. The starts already so cool😁
The only thing grian didn't realise is that when he built a wall of copper, mumbo is the king of oxidising copper...
Really don't like the gradients people have been using. IMO it makes a clean build look like a mess, like you just used whatever random blocks in your inventory to throw together a base lol
usually when people fight the wither they either fight it normally for the challenge or trap it under the bedrock fountain in the end.
Grian the Golem Lord
when you upload it makes my day
viniccius13 do this wither killing with iron golens all the time, he did a wither farm based on this
Grian living in a boot lmao
Youe say that youe whant that youer builds tell a stori everey sezan
Hello grian, i would be a bit earlier but i am just REALLY tired because now i have to wake up to 6:30 AM and i slept a bit, btw you are basically my motivation to keep going on because every time i just don't wanna do anything i remember "oh in a few days there will be a new hermitcraft episode" and keep doing my work. Thank you
Fight the bedrock wither on hard and see how easy it is
I Like the time slots
Lmao I did that wither prank  on a server once
Ok this is the second season in a row that Grian has made a starter base that just looks like The Owl House
The chest monster is gone!! :0 and it’s organised?!
Y'know, blast furnaces smelt ores twice as fast and are not expensive to make. They would make a great investment.
I do not understand why people mine with silk touch?! Its just three times extra job! First you mine the block, then you place the block then you mine it? Now that you can craft rawblocks it's even better for the inventory space to just use fortune the first time.
It’s more fun fighting the Wither ourselves lol most of the time the weather ends up flying away to the surface before the iron golems I place get to it 😂
Grian: "You're gonna be proud of me" Me: "Did he make the back?"
I think people don’t do the iron golem strat because it’s sooo expensive. That many golems costs more iron that you could put towards the beacon. Plus just digging a tunnel with some buffs is a pretty cheap way of beating him and getting a star. But late game, the  Iron golem strat is a great option for farming.
that's always how i've killed the wither, thought that was a common thing
Did you know that smallishbeans used the same thing for killing the wether
Kinda feeling like a proud mother seeing Grian's stuff being organized
23:50 grian and tango talking about important villager stuff.   Meanwhile scar: WhAt Do ThEy TaStE lIkE?...
Nobody does it because of exactly what you're doing at 9:23. It's easy, simple, and doesn't require a 20 iron blocks and 5 carved pumpkins, it really just requires a 1x2 tunnel and a sword.
Grian, thats the best shoe iv ever seen in minecraft
Make a huge block not a Pilar of ores. You won’t lose as much and it’s way easier !
EAT PIE FOR THE REST OF THE SEASOOOOOON!!?!!
20.10 technoblade on a poster!!
It looks just like the one from season 8 am I wrong?
Impulse did it
Grian is the bob Ross of minecraft
was i the only one seeing a shoe for the starter base? like the old lady who live in a shoe and had so many kids😂
Nice wall of copper. I'm kind of hoping Mumbo waxes it all...
My face hurts ;-;
Oof, choosing to compete manually with TangoTek’s copper farm. A bold move.
a "pie"oneer
WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH GRIAN!!!!!!  jkjk congrats on being organized for the next 2 episodes. I had actually noticed how you were organizing you iron and coal in the beginning and was shocked at the tiniest bit of effort you put in. lol  WAIT I TAKE IT ALL BACK HE JUST DID THE BACK AANNDD THE INTERIOR!!!!!!! WHO IS THIS MAN!!!!!!!
That is the new meta for killing withers (if you don't want to go to the End to trap it in bedrock).
THE CHEST MONSTER IS BACK!!!!!!!
Why don't people do this? Someone has to be the first to figure out a new strategy. And from what I've seen of other Hermits, other strategies work well enough I guess people just didn't see the need to improve it.
ur startey base looks like a boot
why is smallish beans not on hermitcraft
15:00 im more proud that u did the back
So Grian lives in a shoe now?
To be honest, I'm proud that you have finished the back actually when you did the rest of the sides
I too struggle with the chest monster
I swear to god that stills will  find ways to use copper in 20 years from now
There was an old grian that lived in a shoe
In theory u could use the wither to mine  for netherite in a tunnel. would this work?
14:56 I thought he was gonna show that he did the back
It has that kind of whimsical jank that reminds me of stardew valley's pixel art!
Luv u grian
DOES NO ONE REMEMBER THE LAST TIME SOMEONE CALLED GRIANS BLUFF WITH A WITHER WHY IS THIS IN CAPITALS?
3:24 me too grian
I’m pretty sure we are more impressed that you did the back
Grian's starter base kinda looks like a cat with a wizard hat of some sort.
"logs 2 electric boogaloo" 15:20
Because you can do it easier
You can say you’re a PIEonier
I was just wondering who biult that awesome looking abode, after watching Scar
GG Grian’s Grooty
I love how you can see gems archer in loads of thumbnails 😂... It's free real estate
You can build an automatic wither skeleton farm later to sell skulls. You  can make it automatic with dogs
Should definitely check out the episode of Impulse’s hardcore series where the golems absolutely demolished the wither
Grians new base, the Wizard cat 🐈 🪄
I do the iron golem thing but I've done it more on modded than vanilla xD
Are smelters no longer a thug for ores? Why using a regular furnace.
15:18 Logs 2: Electric Boogaloo
Plot idea: youre a wizzard that can make things big (  :)   ) with a spell, like you did with a tiny rock that is now your shop
Great series
I’ve been waiting for another Hermitcraft vid. Yay :))))
Ask scar to landscape the whole area
15:12  no.. it couldn't be...     who are you and what have you done to the real grian!?!  grian would never do that!
I am so super soprised that you actually organized your chest in an actual building that was actually built with the porpose of storing things. I'm proud of you Grian.
If you put a string on top of the vine it won’t grow anymore
omg the new time lapse music
Impulse has killed the wither with iron golems before, I believe a couple of weeks or so ago. To answer your question
"We're about to bring this down to the ground." You sound like what the angry german mustache man. But better.
you need only two iron golems too kill a wither
32 Minutes
Nooo no more chest monster
Lizzie would have done the Iron Golem thing if she did it properly lol
If you didn't know, if you put one copper block into a stonecutter, you'll get four cut copper blocks so you can basically quadruple your copper!
Bedrock players seeing that golems attack the wither: 😏
Mumbos base is grians personal farming base
Name all the villagers Scoob
Bad guy remixed to grian saying "I'm a pie guyyyy"
how I missed grian's building tutorial videos
4:25 missed opurtunity... Grian could have Said that he caught scar red handed 😂
Can I just say, Grian’s starter house looks quite lovely
Grian's videos are so great...Only when Scar dies. (This Is All a Joke, Love The Videos Man).
The Starterbase looks like a Magicians Shoue with a witch hat on xD
Grian: guts ur gonna be proud of me: ive cleaned up the junk Everyone: WHO CARES! OMG U DID THE BACK!!!
I have to say that Grian’s house looks like a cat
Looks like the monster of Loch Ness lmao
grian did the back of the base in the same episode that he did the front. WHAT??????
Grian: I’m not going to build a starter house bc I’ll just end up never moving house  Also Grian: Episode 3: MY STARTER HOUSE
14:54 I really thought he was going to show us that there is a back side 💀
Is it just me or does Grian's new house look like a big shoe
This being organised makes me disapointed...
The reason people don't use Iron Golems to fight the wither more often is because it's easier and cheaper to use the End Portal trick.
👍
Yay, episode 3!!! ♡
Cool
Its a boot!
Fun fact: You can actually just spawn the golems right next to the wither while it's spawning.  They have plenty enough health to survive the explosion. And the they just kinda gang up on it and it can't do too much...
Grian- the starter house kinda looks like a dog
With the lantern in the starter base hanging from a chain, would it make more sense to have the blue version?  Just a thought
*me who always use iron golems to kill withers*
When you said that we were going to be proud of you, I was waiting for you to say that you finished the back of the house! 😂 But yes, the organization is good too! Always enjoy watching!
I would like to see Scar and Grian go to Disney World together. would be an amazing series Scars knowledge with Grians goofy can do comedy...Pls sir
grian want to do a storyline it sound like lore and it mean it a game theory
I never thought I'd see the day where someone gets a beacon before building a house
E
Scar is going to prank your base!!!!!
Grian the reason nobody does this is because using the end portal is easier and because iron golems are expensive
Grian u are the best yt u are so cool
Hear me out, deepslate wither miner.
love your videos. hello from canada
Didn't you make a short about how to kill the whither and you said "you just need 5 iron golems"
Your new house looks like a boot
Hiiiiiiiii
I like how scar just said “what do villagers taste like little after 23:43
Did you take the idea of the entity from pittacus lore's Lorien Legacies series
Iron golem to kill the wither, sounds like another video of yours, recently released. Also why does your starter base look like you season 8 starter
Instantly recognised when Grian said he was using golems! LOL
Imagine killing the wither with wardens. You would just keep jumping near a shrieker and they would keep spawning and doing gigantic damage
The old grain that lived in a shoe
Grian theres a pretty good layout (that i also use) shovel in 1st slot, pickaxe in the 2nd slot, food in the 3rd slot,and rockets in the 4th slot (if you like having a weapon then you should have a axe in the 3rd slot and move the food and rockets right by one) the reason why im saying this is because you said that you dont have much space, lucky for people like hermits who do building (mainly) dont require lots of tools
There have been hermits that used Iron Golem on Wither, but it was under the Exit Portal in the End.
Dream better watch out for this mad man GRIAN
Copper ages faster if you put them side by side. It spreads like taint
your amazing grian i love your vids keep them up:)
All I can see about Grian's base is that it has a couple of elf shoes with curly toes on top of it.
You can make a copper farm, that way you can get copper easily and sell it
I mean scars just rebuilt iskalls mega base in like 2 episodes
Grian has a labeled storage area AND is working on interior? Character development this season has gone through the roof
17:10 the way the oak wood of the back wall looks familiar
:D
Looks like a cat wearing a hat
15:04 grain: theres no random junk! ten seconds later* 15:08 random chest*
Organisation? Nah that's not Grian. That's Grien
OMG grian organized ... 1 in a life time!!!!!!!!!!
well wadzee did it with 100 iron golem
Grian let me introduce you to the Blast Furnace 😂
Grian's starter home actually has a back! That aside, I think that the Wither Iron Golem trick might be a great why to find diamonds lol. Also, I'm excited for more of Season 9 and everytime you bully Scar, I'm glad that you did that AFK episode back in Season 8.
Your base is a jesters shoe...
Your house is cool but also kinda looks like a shoe. Love the videos :)
When Grian said ‘you’re going to be proud of me’ I thought he was going to show us the back.
Grian should make a wither killing service
Wow he made the back lol
Yooooo!!! The clutch!!!!
it would be awesome if you made some kind of fleshy meaty intertior for the entity, as if it was some kind of alien creature
The base kinda looks like an elf shoe
finally
current me: wondering what the next barge will be?  future me: oh its the Grian's Big Boulder
So much COPPER
Because people trap the wither under the exit ender portal (bedrock)
Just me or did it sound weird when he said sus
I thought Grian was gonna say he did the back😂
1:00 I mean he’s not wrong, he did lose some items….
Pooooooooo is so yummy and good luvly
0:10 I am a philosopher Grian and this is one of the most interesting questions I've heard in long time
i think the reason no one uses iron golems is because they are really expensive, it takes longer to make the gollems and the room than it takes to just dig a small tunnel, and it's quicker and easy to just fight it in a tunnel xD i think it's just not dificult enough to warrent it for most people xD
I just fineshed waching part 2
WHY ARE YOU SKIPPING MCC 20?????????
Grian did sorted storage. Run!
Mumbo for sure gonna be waxing that copper wall you made
Last time Grain was so organised is the begining of S7
Seeing Grian with organized chests just feels w r o n g
Grain its my birthday! :D
GRAIN OMG THAT WATER BUCKET MLG WAS INTENSE
I tested the method with one Golem and a stack of iron to heal it, and it worked surprisingly well with minimal personal damage
noice
Once u see the Boot in Grians Starter House, you cant unsee it xD
Grian we’ve been proud ever since the start
Regular elf shoe or Christmas elf shoe or a magical elf shoe?
Where is grandma and what have you done with that unsorted man
I really thought you would say that we would be proud of you because you finished the back 😹
Pie man
Is it just me or does it look like a shoe
welcome to another episode of grians grianish grianing grips and tips  with a tad bit of punning session and studies with good old punning and gunning grian
Y’all need the Bedrock wither, it’s so much harder
Grian let's just say playing with Jimmy,  Scar, Jimmy and Joel won't expose you to people who know the mechanics very well
0:39 i had my volume at max
He did the back! He did The BACK!!
15:00 For a second there I thought you were gonna show us that you ACTUALLY made a back for your base.
I love this season
Before I though, if Grian ever joined the Dream SMP he would probably be apart of the syndicate. Now though after the stuff with the Entity, I can safely say he’s 100% join the Eggpire
My first thought about the house was "oh he built a house for Jellie". It has a certain feline feel for sure. 😃
Honestly i was instead proud of him doing the back
ah yes a "starter base" build as always
The house looks like a Duck without its bill.
I’m surprised he finished the back
.
What did you do to our unorganized grian?!?! WHO ARE YOU?
Pin
Amazing just like every video you make
no tag no chicken man who is this
I love the theme of color this season. I think it will also help with the atmosphere of a build too.
Good job organizing your stuff. Try and keep it tidy. Please.
If this season has a storyline, my predictions is that the Entity will be a fragment of the moon after it crashed in HCS8. Anyone else thinking this?
Im just proud it had a back. Good job Grain
Iron golom vs ended dragon
So people actually do use iron golems but they do it in the end they trap the Wither underneath the end portal in the bedrock and let the iron golems do the work I saw quite a few Hermits do it in season 7
Raid farm coming soon. . .
Grian, i am so proud of you that you organized your chest! Good job!
1178th comment!!! Les than half an hour
Man just changed how we fight the wither
Grian please I beg you, make a build for your pies based on Mrs. Lovett’s pie shop from Sweeney Todd after all you need “more hot pies” :)
Love it
grain: 1v3 clutch in mcc grain when 1v4blazes: there is too many
There once was an old grian who lived in a shoe
It's a boot house
When creepers are sus...
starte r hoes
5:56 GOODTIMES WITH SCAR! You are a bold one!
Is it only me that understood "puta" as the spanish word as the dog name?
Why does it look like a giant elf shoe 🤣
Looks like a cat, but one with a magical hat,
Grian is like the Bob Ross of minecraft
Grain should start a pie cult
One day, this mischief of yours is going to bite you in the butt, and you'll have a hard time recovering.
grian can u make blast furnace u know blast furnace is more good then normal furnace and 1 coal get 10 item smelt
I was proud of the fact that the house had a back XD
I literally checked if this video existed just a couple of minutes ago, and then came out afterwards.
People don't use golems to kill the wither because killing the wither underground is very easy, and it is faster to just do it by hand than to spawn golems
i dislike this starter base respectfully
First: Grian…Next: Grien…and now: The pie guy…
I heard someone say that if you hit the whither skeleton's head it will drop it's head a lot more often  And he tested it and it seemed to work cause he got three really fast
15:12 He's growing up😊
I'm more proud of the fact that it has a back
Grian: Jumps off of a one block high tower with a bucket without being scared Also Grian: AHHHHHH NOOOOOOO IM DYING THE BLAZE MADE ME LOSE 1 HEART OH NOOOO
your house is a llama i love it
You should follow ianxofoar farms for eazzy money
Your base looks like a metallic cat stuck its head into a tower wearing a witched hat Once you see it you can’t unsee it
12:12 Grian: it turns out living under a rock isn't really a good thing  Patrick: *Sad starfish noise*
I don’t do the iron golem thing because I can’t afford the iron until after I make the beacon pyramid
8:24 bedrock edition be like
You didn't stand on my face, you stood on my soul. Also your starter house looks like an elf shoe
Omggg i cant believe he actually organized im going to mark the day and celebrate
the copper prank gonna backfire mumbo is going to wax it all i can see it coming, no aging copper for you
Great video can't wait for the villager farm
What a waste of iron
that MLG tho
15:12
Speaking of sus why are you not playing among us !!!!!!!! I Miss The Crazy !!!!!! 😭
Ahh so that's why you made the YT short on iron golems killing the wither
Hands down when he kept kiting us saying what we'd be proud of him for... I thought he meant he finished the back of the build in one go.
ngl, when he said we were going to be proud he was kinda walking towards the... back of the house... i think you know where this is going
With grians clutching he is way better than techno or dream
Grian is a minecraft genius
Grian and Tango: Let's build a raid farm for emeralds Scar: *what do villagers taste like?*
Hehe, It looks like a shoe... Even if it does look like one, it's still an amazing build :>>
What if THE ENTITY IS A PEACE OF THE MOON FROM HERMITCRAFT SEASON 8
That house looks *VERRY* similar to the season 8 start house
Looks like a shoe...Are you planning on stepping on your boulder as a perch? 😁
Organized chests? WHO ARE YOU AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH GRIAN?!
Thing is, I always just built the Wither underneath the end portal and killed it there                                      it is in fact cheesy
I got 6 wither Skelton skuls in a row and I would like to call that good luck
15:16 nah what I am most proud of from you Grian is the fact you finally done the back and it didn't take you an entire season to do it
Finnish youtuber Lakko did that
Grian, Grian. You're telling me you made a boot next to a rock?
People dont do this because the golems are expensive and the bedrock trick is easier
Duck base, it needs a beak!! :)
hi
Hey Grian, your base is wagging it's tail
The base looks like a shoe that has been over grown and tiny people has turned it to a home.
When you build your mega base and finish it destroy your starter base so you have to move into your mega bass
*sees labelled storage base* who are you and what did you do with grian.
…Alright I stop watching Grian for a bit and it’s already Season 9? Season 8 was really short
Anybody know the instagram account for yumar? I want to know the insperation
You should add a sword sticking out of ur boulder like king author.
cool
I recommend you to use blast furnaces to smelt copper, iron, ect to smelt them faster. They save alot of time! It only works for ores tho.
Lol grians storage house looks like a shoe.....       Or is it just me?
Is It your bday today if its happy birthday grian
14:55 I thought he was gonna say "I did the back"
15:09 *expecting to be shown the back of the base*
Im here and I apologize for misclicking the dislike button o_o"
Grian not trying to be rude but your starter base reminded me of a nursery rhyme of an old lady that lived in a shoe
I would think raw copper blocks are more valuable since those are not farmed.
stop bullying scar
We are proud that for once you did the back of the build
P Op
Looks like 3 cooked pork disappeared from your inventory, “pie guy”?🧐
Grian: Hey guys this is how you make a starter house Proceeds to break every law of physics Grian: see easy
Not gonna lie grian is kinda pulling a mumbo and making a living base.
Hafe an hour Feet
I dont care about you organizing, is the back done?? xD
Am so proud of you grian your acshely organised
Why don't you make a blast furnace? Why?
my face is in pain
is it just me or does the house look like a odd boot? just me? ok...
I saw your short video about this.. i did it in my world last night.... used 4 golems and they killed him quick.... going to try again when i get 3 more skulls with 3 golems..... Before you spawn it next time, throw in a bunch of eggs so you get wither roses as well :)
Thanks Grian I really needed an episode today. Been a rough one. :)
the iron golem wither thing is not being use alot because instead of using the iron to kill the wither they use it to activate the beacon or what I do make the wither do the dirty work for me and dig down to the lowest Y level and make a long tonel and let the wither mine all the blocks for me and if I want to stop I just kill the wither and collect the items
Looks like a dog
There is a back unlike the mansion and magic cave
am i the only one who looked at gians starter base and taught: thats a shoe
anyone else realise after he had a rant about being a pie guy rather than eating other food it jump cut and there was one less porkchop... pie betrayal
I bet the Entity will become the moon of season 9 lmao
I love your vids!
Also something we’re proud of other than ur storage is that u finished the back of ur base.
I think many players that arent on youtube creating content are using the iron golem trick. When you are a creator you need to reinvent stuff and take it over the top, make something entertaining that 5 golems will not give you. Like the last season you killed the wither by basically smashing rocks on it, it took time to work, but you got great content. Ive been using it since i started playing and have had many others on different servers do the same thing.
grians gonna have a chest house for a starter base xD!      maybe??      actualy???
I'm so proud
Grian: it's all labeled Also Grian: that sign cant stop me cause I cant read
Mumbo might come and unwax your copper
You could make grians camp house
Not gonna lie.That's a heck lot of copper.
This person made an organized chest room AND finished the back of it. Who are you and where's Grian?
wither deepslate mining
Jod
You should connect you're Base to Scar's Forest and build more of these builds! Maybe all around The Entity, like it being the center! It would look super good!
Beans
“Look what I did you’re gonna be so proud!” Me: “did you build a back to the base?” “I labeled the storage!”
Brian please make the starter house into a duck as it has a kind of resemblance
2 episodes now that he's finished the back. Who are you, and are you feeding Maui?
Scar is hooked on the totems now
idea for the honey build why not build like the actual bee farm as a beehive on the tree
The house looks like a dog with a hat and I can't unsee it.
how are you doing i love your seasons they are so fun to watch
you g what up my g fam wanna hang with me an dill?
For copper builds only thing I can think of to slim down the inventory, is keep it all fully oxidized place it then go through and de-oxidize it and wax what you want the gradient to be. Cause it is A LOT of blocks
You can use arrows of weakness with a piercing crossbow for a reusable villager curing system I believe - might only be for bedrock
Did anyone alse see the house as a big shoes?
8:53 I like how everyone in chat assumes that they let it loose
GRAIN 😂  your storage space looks like a dog. I love it
Not a fan of the house. You're an amazing builder so I appreciate taking risks, but I don't like it lol. Sorry Grian 😕
Mumbo will probably be shock and be proud when he sees this hahaha
I'm just happy there's a back
Just move in with scar unannounced
Love the tutorial style of the house!
Is it just me or does Grian's new building look like a boot?
I’m proud of your labeling grian
Grian's house looks like a really funny animal if you look at the orange bit on the left as a foreleg and the blue curl on the top right as the tail.
Grain: Why does nobody do this?  ITS EXPENSIVE!! And the thing you were doing while luring it in is what regular peeps do .
Why do I now want you to put a wither in Mumbo's vault?
I’m gonna employ golems for my own wither when the time comes, I still need to find a fortress, get netherite armor, more copper for my base, more stone bricks for my base, I need a lot before I’m goleming withers
Funny thing about copper blocks, I decided to make a giant wall where theyre the majority... It's taking a while to finish..
Actually I tested golems, but never tried em in smp :(  Btw, nice cat-base :D
Why isn’t the entity called THE BOULDER
So this is where the short came from
Great idea for a prank: change your skin so you have a wither skull for a head and then collect three of your 'wither' skulls.  Not sure if it'll work, but if it does I bet you could get some good scares
Hello
The starter base’s roof looks similar to Scar’s base’s roof from last life…
People don't use golems to kill the wither because it's so easy to kill the wither in the first place.
‘I am doing something very stupid I apologize for stomping on your face’ -Grian 2022
Just wait. Season 10 grians chest monster will be so big he can live inside it.
Grian: Opens chest full of diorite Iskall:
How long will the sorted chest last
one of the signs says logs 2 electric boogaloo
How dare you stomp on me
i give it about five episodes before a new chest monster spawns
The Entity  is so obviously going to be a  plot point
"I'm going to sell copper" sorry grian but tango has that market cornered already with a farm and the farm produces far more than you've got
Best clutch EVER, awesome house and episode Grian.
GOOD JOB  ON THE MLG !!!!   (well at least u did it once😅)
'Scar with totem of undying isn't real, he can't hurt you'
Grian kills Scar EVERYTIME Still Grian: am i that predictable?
16:20 Hey Grian! don't forget that you can now stop the growth of vines of the various types like Weeping vines, kelp, glow berry vines, and Twisted Vines with right clicking with a pair of shears in hand.
Someone did that already... check out wadZee's channel
I use the spawn fountain in the end and surround the wither in with golems and he just gets stuck and dies.
maybe i can take the wither myself omg
I would keep a dairy entry on the bolder to keep the vibe of studying the living bolder.
I liked the post you are talking about and I have been working on designs inspired by it as well. I saw the thumbnail and immediately recognized it. Great build G❤
Imagine Grian becoming an interior designer! He would be awesome at it
hes goning to a more magical aproach
The hermitchat when Grian and Scar start spawn in the wither! 😂
these videos make my day so much better
Grian: Guess what, you guys are going to be so proud of me Me: You built the back?
I am proud of you!
You should give us more tips and tricks why'll your building it's nice for someone like me who sucks at building.
nobody is using iron golems because they are expensive and a 1x2 hole and a diamond sword with some iron armor is more then enough and way cheeper
It's not just a boulder, it's a rock!
I was more proud of the fact it had a back wall
Dude you labeled your chest monster!!❤❤❤ that's a huge deal!
we are proud!!
Is it only me but does the starter base look like a dog
I literally did this 2 weeks before they did this so I pretty much has made up this idea
Actually a finnish youtuber called Lakko used the iron golem tactic
i think people dont do the golem thing  because of all the iron blocks needed to make iron golems !
Of course when Grian says to scar “set of the wither” an ad comes on!
Your starter base looks like sock
An idea for a mega base is all your other bases smudged together
Grian: there is noooo random junk Me sees two chests still: 🤔
Beautifully organized grian 👏👏 and as always amazing build
72805th
1000 comment
Grian: to make this look a bit more “homely”  Me: “homely” are you sure that’s the word??😂
When i first saw the house i actually thought it was pearls house because grian said hes going to live in the entity and the color was kind of the same so i thought
Grian: your going to be so proud of me Me: the back is done?! Grian: the junk is gone
15:05 “and there’s no random junk” sees multiple chest on the ground
Who are you and what have you done with Grian?
Go cartoon style and make a giant telescope going towards the entity to show that the wizard is studying it .
If u go wither skull hunting again then turn your chunks down so mobs can only spawn in that area giving u a larger amount of with skeletons
Would like to see a slime thing on the boulder! You could sell slime balls and slime blocks for that one! :D
Grian wont live under a rock so he moved into a giant shoe/boot
Grian didn’t want to live under a rock so he built a shoe.
Add a cone on the entity and ironically sell nautilus shells
WHAT?! Grian has built two builds AND THEY BOTH HAVE BACKS??? What is this sorcery..
Loving hermitcraft being back it is sooo great!!!
I have a fun idea for a prank! You could make a ton of slime blocks and place them on every surface of a building. :)
i would love to see more don't starve together videos they where rly good
The server is called hermitcraft so has anyone done a hermit house?
When’s the unbelievable shop like the barge
I actually did that iron golem trick a couple days ago, just with 20 iron golems and strength II
11:22 Grian saying sus
Dude me and my friends should use iron golems lol we died 80 times and my friends were so desperate they used wood swords
I thought he was gonna show he had conpleted the back of the house
It looks like you're living in a shoe!
I’m not a lover of the colors but the build is so pretty wow
you said you weren't going to make one!!!
5:26 people who watched the short: its all coming back together
It looks like a shoe Grian, a shoe
It would be funny if over time the entity took over the alchemist house and engulfs it
Why does Grian’s time lapse music always slap so hard
Nobody uses iron golems for a wither, cause by fighting it underground, it's not that hard in the first place.
False, tango tek , and grian all of them are selling copper🤔
you should have an area set up for resource towering with hoppers to collect the resources down below
(The wither thing) no1 did it b4 bcuz its kinda expensive without good iron supply and its easy the normal way anyway But still a nice idea :)
"You guys are gonna be so proud of me" is just 😂 also there's so much lore people could make about the entity
A very clean, sharp, petite, handsome starter base might I say
14:44 the pointy  boot!
When i have to fortune my ores i like to put the ore in off hand and pick in main hand, hold both mouse buttons, and have a dispenser drop more ores on me with full inventory slots so i can just afk fortune them, with this many ores it might take ages though lol
When you said we are going to be proud i though you did the back
:D keep going Grian your videos are so amazing and it brings a smile to me face when you post!
.
Grian, I just watched the 3rd life again and it made me so happy! And now I'm back to watch Hermitcraft!
You could make your bed in the spire
Who are you and what have you done with Grian
BRING BACK THE TEGG!
Why don't you go mining with a wither like what you were doing to draw the wither to the golems and just keep the wither going so that it would mine a big area.
Da Boot
Is it just me or does it look like a elf shoe
This is epic!!
G R A I N S
Grain: no one does this! Impluse: I have in my hardcore series. Thanks for the watching my content 🤣
It's funny that impulse and grian did this at basically the same time XD hermits share brainwaves apparently
Look i love this series but i have 1 question? Takes that really 5 days to make this episode
you should start a boulder cult where everyone that joins has to contribute to the entity
Scar was right grian starter storage base thing abob  looks like a Cat Lol
The starter base looks like a potion shop..... 👀👀👀 maybe u could make it to a potion shop later when u have a mega base
The base looks like a cat 🐈
Grian is the Copper Lord
I'm gonna be honest - around 15:00 when he said we're gonna be proud of him I thought he was going round to show us a completed back
Is it just me or does it look like a boot
People dont use golems for wither because they just slap it with a sword in a tunnel like you were doing before
Tbh the starter base looks a lot more like a shop than the Entity
Boot
15:18 THAT IS NOT GRIAN WE HAVE AN ORGANISED GRIAN I REPEAT AN *ORGANISED* GRIAN
3:17 Master Skywalker there are too many of them what are we going to do?
"The entity spoke to me and said it didn't want to be a house"  That's concerning... the last time a rock spoke to the hermits it resulted in a cult and demanded the heads of multiple hermits... welp
Grain is finally organized
Im really looking forward for this season. Everything looks tidy. And really excited for your mega base!!
hi Grian I just want to say I'm a big fan of your vids and also, keep up the good work!
I was waiting for this episode :)
Grian I'm glad that you actually did the back-
The house looks doop
WHAT did you do to our grian.
“Logs 2 electric boogaloo”
Why do you post at 2 am grian
That starter house is insane
You should make a steampunk airship!
I saw the starter house from Scar's perspective first and he called it a cat in a witch's hat and I cannot unsee it.
I was literally watching HeCr-S2 Ep-40 Mumbo Pov Before this.
7:51 this got me dying
This video was fantastic and very funny Grian. Keep up the great work :)
my face hurts now. thanks a lot grian.
3:11 You know there are shields in minecraft. And bows
You should call the boulder a geode and sell ores and stuff
Grian:  * thinks he's done a unique thing *  Impulse, who killed the wither with iron golems a few weeks ago:  * sad Impulse noises *
I’ve been stalking you and Gem just waiting for an upload
The reason people don’t use iron golems is because they use the bedrock fountain in the end grian
Grian's Looty would be a good name for a shop
I wouldn't kill the wither this way because it's faster to set up a long hallway than to make space for iron golems
Nice house
Groovy timelapse music. Thanks, Grian. Can you use that more often?
It took me 6 hours to get 3 skulls with looting 3
Cool
Grian, Just wanted to say that your hermitcraft series is amazing and that you inspire me to be a YouTuber too, Keep up the good work!😀😀  From, Ben aged 10
Wow 15 mins and 7k like already  We really love grain lol
tango has a copper farm  already
I have seen a finnish youtuber used the golems like 2 years ago.
Grian said at 9:15 he said bring it in bring it in who ever knows encanto will understand
I love your videos!
I think there should be some kind of magical amethyst circle around the entity.
So far I LOVE this season :))))))))))))
Grain what is your build music?
I mean a full enchanted netherite sword kills the wither faster then the iron golems but you are way safer that way so its a little bit of a trade off
Never seen this 😳. This is my new and only way dealing with it
Hellooooooooo
is it me or ur base looks like a DOG ?
Hiiiiiiiii
Grian selling copper is good because goodtimeswithscar exists
Ive got a bad feeling about the entity 😅
No chest monster?
i cant not see "cat in a wizard's hat" now when i look at that starter base.
no one does the iron golems with wither because you can just easily kill it with ur sword
Did you know that if you spawn a wither and if it explodes and hurts dolphins as it spawns the dolphins will attack the  either
What if you could use the wither to find netherite?
gamer
yay another episode
I’m like soooo excited for this hermitcraft  I can’t wait!!!
The crafting table in the thumbnail kills me.
You really DID stomp on my head Ouch
Oh so that’s what that short was about
Dream and techno blade are soooo jealous of groans Skills.
your mom
This season looks so exciting!!!
5:27 people who saw the short before clicking on this video be like:
865th comment
I think before deepslate, the wither would get away easily from golems, or make a huge cave in stone so it was harder for the iron golems to kill the wither from below them, and easier for withers to kill all the golems.
Acacia looks so good with viper and deep slate doesn’t it I’ve been using a lot.
New season new grain Items sorted and Back of a base complete
The YouTube shorts was forshadowing!
Alright how do you say Putter Putter (prounced poo-ter) Putter (rhymes with butter) Putter (as in putting something down) The first one is like scar, the second is grian and the third is how I say it
Grian: why is no one doing this? Wadzee:*causally has 100 golems defeat the wither*
A big fan of u form India ❤️🥰
The Bob ross of Minecraft
3:15, did anyone else tought of this starwars scene? (master skywalker, there too many of them, what are we going to do?)
Lol when I was a kid I would battle withers and iron golems on a creative world cuz I liked popularmmos
Scars gonna prank ur base plus he thinks ur base is like a cat with a witch hat 😂
Can wait to see what going to happen
Grian: I Don't Know if Iron Golems Attack the Wither   Also Grian: Made a Yt Shorts about Using Iron Golems In Withers
Beautiful, can you just please put a lightning rod on top of the house so it doesn't burn.
Yay I'm here in 13 min
The reason A lot of
I have cracked the puzzle every five days we get a new hermitcraft episode
is this how you got the short?
3:55 5:02 6:02 6:18 6:34 7:49
I saw on Hermitcraft season 7 Etho or Impulse showed an Iron Golem killing the Wither but the Wither was also stuck under the End Portal.
hey, grian, chest monsters cause lag, use barrels instead
Survival is easy just don't die
😃
Congratulations on organization
I libe hermitcraft
Leave a “E” in the comments
*Grian start a mini series in hermitcraft where you do experiments with redstone and try to improve it and make wonderful and beautiful redstone devices. We would love to see you redstone struggle and improvement over time and it will be really fun. And you building skills with redstone will be amazing and it will give us most amazing devices.*  It would be a miniseries running besides the main theme and content.
8:43 i thought he had bedrock for a minute
A masterpeice  Edit : Btw grian i am wathcing this at 1 : 15 Btw im in indonisian so my thime is differnt Urs is probaly morning  Another edit : Grian i think you should sell ender pearl's Make and enderman farm and kill with a swepping eged and mending it doulbes as an exp farm and ender pearl farm
o/
Grians chest monster for this season has officially begun. Honestly it's more of an entity than grians, 'entity'.
BLAST. FURNACE. please. My ocd can’t take it.
When I saw the notifications I thought: cool...  VS  When I saw Grian or Grain: YES YES YES!
I think you guys should add the timer into this server so we can see the iMessage spent on here. It would be cool
:D YEAS EP>3
Yes!!! Elven grian house!!!!
Yey
yaaaaayyy im haaaapy
Grians favorite hobby: Killing scar
u can use ur shield when fighting blazes it helps A LOT
Scar says i think you are a minecaft Genius i say your a minecaft GRIANius
I love that to further prove the best method to kill the wither. He makes a short about it and also does it in hermitcraft
yay another episode of the Hermit craft
kill a wither with bees
nice
when did grian get a trident.
ok
True fans know about the iron golem trick by watching girans shorts
50k views in 13 mins 💀
Grian at the beginning," im not making a starter base!" Grian now,"..."
I think LDShadowLady did the iron golem trick on your 100 hours server, but she did die in the process haha.
You should try yo completely flood the Boulder and with the help of the heart you would see and breathe in the water
Grian your a scudding genius
Luv u
Putther is a gta 5 YouTuber
0:38 water at night:
Dont sell copper tango has made an amazing copper drown farm.
As far as I know, the torch didn't stop the wither spawn, it was that the wither skull was placed at an angle.
Hmmmmmmm
you can also just go in a straight line and use the wither to mine for you easy blackstone or cobble helps break more ores and stuff
E
Woah
9:53 I'm going to answer your question: withers are pathetically weak and very easily cheesed making it not worthwhile to spawn all of those golems
Hi
happy birthday to me 🙂🙂
Funny thing, right when you made your base i finished my cabin base on my world
My my, it seems like we have some bad pvpers
I honestly don’t know what would happen if he used more golems but when he goes and fights the wardens
hi you make me smile thank you
I now see where that short came from
Good luck if you want to compete with Tango's copper farm
me: being a little sad and bored Grian: Upluads a videap me: being the happiest guy in the world
Hi Grian it was my bday yesterday it was on 15 of march, u made my day!!
I just realized that Grian didn’t kill Isakall with a trap last season. He needs to do it this season to continue the streak.
1:21 OOOOHHHH NOOOO!
good job
i think the reason people dont do it is because of it's cost
no one has watched this video to the end exept grian lol
If you are going to sell copper consider a partnership with Tango. Just Saying.
grian and scar:*about to spawn the wither* the ad: hold it there,i aint letting you watch this peacefully
Is it just me or does the house look like a shoe?
The house looks like a shoe or boot 😂 🥾
i just got done watching hermitcraft and now he uploads a vid WHILE im watching the episode *what luck*

Ever since the accident in boatem no one  trust Grian and withers
i have been waiting for years for this vid So thanks! and not thanks keep it up! Btw upload more my freind.
The house looks like the old starter base from season 8
10 MINUTES AGO?!? IM SO HAPPY MAN IVE NEVER BEEN THIS EARLY TO ONE OF YOUR VIDEOS AND YOU'RE MY FAVORITE YOUTUBER
Baba black sheep
as soon as he said he was taking the wither I thought oh that's why he did the short
Fun fact: no one has finished watching yet
You could make an ore platform for ore towers where there's automatic collection at the bottom to streamline the fortune process.
YEAHHHHH NEW GRIAN HERMIT CRAFT EPISODE LETS GOOOOOO!!!!!!!
lol i just finished watching episode two and then this just dropped
I always look forwards to your uploads Grian! Can’t wait to see how this season plays out!
Base kinda looks like a shoe
I should be in school rn but I got threatened and kicked out. Im enjoying doing at home tho
YOU WANNA BE A [[BIG SHOT]] DON'T YOU?  WELL THEN, [[Like and Subscribe]] TO THIS [[Producer]] TO RECEIVE [Hyperlink Blocked] AT NO COST!
ow! ow! ow! ow! oh high Grian!
this new season is already starting to turn chaotic and amazing
bro that wither bait was cold
Impulse actually used Iron Golem trick in the last episode I think. It's so broken!
I love the base, reminds me of the story of the lady who lived in a shoe
Impulse did
Been loving season 9 so much
This is the best season yet!
Grian Last Season: im not making a mega base Grian: *Makes a giga-base* Grian this season: im not making a starter base. Grian:
First time early since u only make videos on night over here.
Everything<Hermitcraft
Grian last episode: this rock would be very cool  Grian now: anyways im bored of this boulder
nice video
I have covid 😢😢😢
make a floor of hoppers to collect the ore that drops
I mean, copper is a valuable resource, but Tango built a copper farm he's literally called "gamebreaking" :D good luck competing with that
Impulse did the wither with the golems on hardcore. Hands down best way to do it! Lol
Ohhhh he’s basically dream now with that mlg😌
'That is a cat with a hat'(base) A quote by gtws
What happened to “just doing the Mega base - no started base”?
10:00 where grian got idea for shorts
Scar's video spoiled me
Ah yes        „sus, super sus“
First
Early :)
Grian in episodes 1 and 2: “I don’t think I’m going to start with a starter base and just go straight into my megabase” Episode 3: “Here’s my starter base!”
Any day with a hermitcraft upload is a good day.
Bro someone predicted this on reddit
Anyone else get genuinely terrified when Grian put the third either skull down?
Pro Minecrafter move is to build your starter base after killing the ender dragon and wither
This MGL was the reason Grian is killing in MCC
Can’t wait for a pointless war
Love your content Grian I've been watching since build school

Dont bother selling copper because you wont be able to produce more copper than Tango
I say selling copper without having an automatic copper farm and with having Tango as a competitor is just a really stupid idea.
lets goo grian
Its funny that after 7 minutes (when im posting this) the video has 17k views, and 700 coments XD
It's so weird to see Grian using a normal furnace for smelting tons of copper and not a blast furnace
It's OK grian, you can stamp on my face all yo- wait...
Third
Grian is now the Dream slayer, Mcc winner, and pro mlger
pogchamp
This is the first time I am seeing this series lol I am loveing it
Cant wait for this episode someday i hope i can join hermitcraft and make friends with all the hermits it sounds like a lot of fun
it is a good day when Grian uploads
Grian’s grains chain. Btw milkshake draws came up with the idea
6:07 *Flashbacks to season 8*
Grian the copper king
7 mins early
i am very excite!
e E  E E E E
If there’s copper then you know who’s going to buy them… 😂
So excited to see what happens in this season and your house looks really nice 👍
I love this! :D
That’s a nice starter base
I KNEW he was gonna fight the wither with golems!!!!
COPPERCOPPERCOPPERCOPPERCOPPERCOPPER SELLSELL COPPERCOPPER
Ooo early 1k comments. Cool!
Scar being a loving friend and stealing
Wow I’m actually early
new VID!!!
woo one of the first people finally
Am I the only one who still laughs at scar because of all the times he died in episode 1
So much for sleeping on time lol; was looking for this before it was uploaded earlier and glad it's here before I sleep haha
Ahh, now grians latest short makes sense..
When I was watching this I was playing minecraft and first wither skeleton I kill drops a skull lol
Lets go im so happy this video is out
is it just me or when grian uploads do you feel very happy
taco
nice
oww my face
If you think realy hard about it, seeds are just sp*rm cells
So cool!
I feel like from the hardcore series/Last life Grian has improved at the game considerably compared to S8. Might just be me though
Scar wasn't stealing copper, he was just helping out with the chest monster!
grian, for aging the copper faster I would recommend put a 5 block gap between every copper block, so it will age faster (founded this tip from reddit :)
#1
imagine if grian replied
“Congrats to everyone who is early and who found this comment”🏆
Im so intrested how this season will go, i hope it will be something like season 8 or something bigger
Love the videos. Keep up the great work
Honestly, I thought he was going to make The Entity physically expand into more chambers to sell more stuff, and that he would live in one.
Hello I hope your day is great
GRIANNNNN THE MAN! THE MYTH! THE LEGEND!!! :D
I finally made it within the hour :D
When Grian Posts: My day just got much better:)
Im loving the series! You are really my favourite youtuber! Keep up the good work G!
I'm just saying, the starter house looks like a witch or wizard took over a giant's shoe.
Hi grain!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So many bots
when more hermitcraft content arrived so you can finally stop binging videos from 2017
WHAT HAPPENED TO NOT HAVING A STARTER BASE???
For your main base ehy dont you do a base in another dimension like you did in season 7
I have found the addiction of stacking ores in a pile and it won’t stop
Yes.
Lets go! Another one, thanks!
I am ready to binge watch this for the rest of my life
Im so excited for this season!!
grain moment, wheres the poultry man?

Amazing Grian, keep going with the vids
Grian. You never fail us with your awesome content. Keep up the great work man!
thank you for the new video grian
Hey grian, you can put copper blocks into a stone cutter to get 4x stacks of cut copper for 1x stack of copper blocks
Hello Grain. I really enjoy watching your videos in my free time and they make my day better whenever I watch them. Your content always makes me smile and entertained when I see you upload them.  I been watching your Hermit craft videos scence the beginning of season 7. It's always cool to watch how far you guys come and see the amazing build you do. It's always crazy to see what you Hermits do when a season starts
Hi
noice
Yo grian I love your vids ❤️

Chest monster
Making the starter house in episode 3. It’s a world record

How many comments are about Grian doing the Impulse Iron Golem thing?
Am I the only one that wishes you kind of finished season eight
Grian in episode 1 “I’m not going to make a starter base!”  But as we all know, Grian is the master sensei of loopholes, trained in the arts for many years…  Title of Video: Starter HOUSE 👏 love you Grian been watching since Episode 1 season 6 🥳
HEY GRIAN! Im a new animator that has not currently made any videos 😅. It would be neat if we could do a collab once im more popular. Also keep up the great work on your videos! (Reply to this with a 🐖 if you read the entire thing)

I feel like if you sell copper it should be in the raw form bc Tango already has a massive copper farm, but it doesn’t produce raw copper.
