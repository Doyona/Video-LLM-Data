You shut up YouTube
People who say to put the cereal before the milk: why would you put milk first? Me who puts  the bowl  first :😂
I wish I could have half-asleep in my name😅😅
I actually have Clocky, the alarm clock with wheels. Hearing the sound it made when it turned on reminded me of all the angry 6 and 7ams that I woke up to a very annoying, screaming clock.
Tell me how to make this, it’s so cool!
Morning person. stupid words.
This give off opening scene of "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure" vibes. 😆
It triggered my iphone 😂
Good job
WHY ARE YOU USING MOONG DAAL FOR THE SUBHEADING

Wait, how did the train start ?

Beautiful
Cue in the breakfast machine song from peewee’s adventure!!!
Also alarm clock from the blaoon
Nice to do that❤❤❤❤
Honestly, Mr half asleep, I’m the exact kind of time waster that would love hearing you just rambling on and on about how you did these things, and I know I’m probably not the only one, so maybe second channel material?
He should make one that makes toast
Me too
oren
The dispenser gone of before
Ah jeez that’s more of a ripoff than that breakfast machine I bought
This is so British 😭😭😭😭
I have a very strong suspicion this guy takes Soy milk with his breakfast lol

The reason why you’re not a morning person is because you’re always half asleep
Could this work with other breakfasts like waffles or toast?
Very good 👍!

AIs talking to each other is the best contraption
Omg o cool
Love it! But wait… how is he filming it while it’s running? He was supposed to be asleep 💤
Subscriber Maksud subscribers
Idea for a more room efficient version you could have the train going behind all the kitchen appliances and have sensors that send a signal to a orange juice dispenser then to a ceral dispenser with another sensor that activates it have it trwvel along the wall to the table
You are YouTube????
What in the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is this??
I’m not a breakfast guy but this would make me eat it ;D

Spend 5-10 mins making breakfast : ❎  Spend days making a Lego train : ✅
4:49  HI BELLA
Like how everything is orange😃
The dislikes are probably from the people who pour milk before cereal and are wrong
Dude, this guy eats cat food or is that cereal? I don’t know.
Make it a real machine that leads to your bed
Is it just me or is he kinda of Wallace?
When you said Siri my Siri went off😂

"what if I automate the process" "what if I build a Lego Train" the way he says that makes it sound an entirely logical consequence
This is my favorite video from your channel
Ok, who is inspiring whom? You or Wallace & Grommet. OOOORRRRR...are you the secret identity of Wallace. Like Bruce Wayne and Batman.
The music when the train is running sounds like slime rancher
God bless!
i love your video's
EAT!
Computers are Rube Goldberg machines themselves.

When I have a house I will design a similar system but with one wide central compartment to carry breakfest deliveries to my bed

Awesome!
can you make this set available? and add a tender? I’ll only buy the engine and the tender only. and without stickers.
How much money did you pay couple hundred❤100£££

Goofy ahh Karen’s💀💀💀
YOUR COOL SO MUCH !
It would be impossible if you did this 500,000 times
How have you only got 14million views. Surely everyone on the planet needs to watch this twice in their lives!
What really doesnt make you a morning person: resetting that thing!
Wow! Just... wow...! 🙂So delightful
Wow Or Amazing  Hard
You definitely knew what you were doing saying alexa, siri and ok google
You turned my Alexa on
I love the editing in this video and when you had a lion head on your head it was super-duper funny 🤣  *plz pin this*
this guy is living every kid’s dream
A very cool video
The breakfast express😂😂😂😂
YouTube!
I totally agree youtube it is very cool
😅
😎✌👍🤘👌🫠
6:39 did anyone else phone go off lol.

U have the same table like me 😀

Awesome
"it only took 34 tries." ☠️
HAHAHAHAH
Disturbed Disturbs me to have dun vxnxbcsbxgcv ydh dffggd surgery

You are my favorite person on YouTube I'm even subscribed
omg your real face!
I'm a fan of your music
Hold on YouTube
YouTube i love you❤❤❤❤❤
It’s gonna be hard to reset
I love how he doesn’t think Id watch a 2 hour documentary on this one contraption, when I totally would
I have the same type of clock he used in this just it is the color whight instead of blue
How did YouTube comment you?
Camera man its so early🥱😴
How do you speak that fast?😂
Bro is the next mark rober
What has it he made
Wont the milk and orange juice be warm? *ew*
Yay

AWSOME!!!!
Let's go I love cocopops
This is amazing!😀 thanks I'm gonna have to try this
Violet from a series of unfortunate events be like:
Chris I’m a big fan and I love your vids
You build all the dreams I wish I could’ve built wow🥹 :edit this is every kids dream🤣
I’m not a morning person either
Mmmmmmmmm I forgot to say, I was hungry
YOOTOOZ COMMENTED THIS VID
I love it and you art the best
Wait youtube😮😮😮😮😮😮 this video must be a great video
This. Is. Insane! How did you do this?!
Really cool! It would be kinda easier to make it with a lego mindstorms car and then a Pi
2:06 sir you aproximatly talked at the speed of light - dmranius4
Great 😃👍🏾❤😊
good work! wow. 😻😻
Couldnt this just be all attached to the ceiling and with a massive drop near a table to keep it out of the way (or even a lift to avoid any spilling)
Cool 🆒😎
🐈🐈
Wow
👏🏻👏🏼👏🏽👏🏾👏🏿
Hi 4:31
Hi 4:06
This is 2024
6:30
6:54 WHATS FEED ME CEREAL
6:38 DID YOU REALLY NEED TO MAKE THAT NOISE
0:00 YOU ARE A PERSON
3:32 THERE IS CAT FOOD IN IT
THERE IS 2 CLONES OF CRIS
How did you make Machine 2? HOWWW?! HOW DID YOU SET IT UP?!?!
Machine 1 SO ORANGE AND FAST
This video is great, but the cereal does not look like cereal!
you kind of remind me of Paul McCartney (complement)
Why would orange juice be yellow when it looks like orange
This is just great! Good bob Man.😊
smart
All aboard the lego briefest train
Think peewee Herman had the same Idea for his morning as well
Idk how is he recording the time when’s he’s alsleep and it’s makes for him
I guess you could say this build is a TRAIN-reaction😏
I feel so hungry 😋🤤
❤
I live in the uk Watford Hertfordshire England and I'm from Ghana 🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭🇬🇭
A Rube Goldberg machine video is the next best thing to a cat video!  Well done.
Nice!
reminds me of the opening scene in peewee herman
why do i feel like this is lazy?
Me still trying to find the song transition name 💀
8:08
Do you know what was funny ? That he had to build this even during the morning so imagine how grumpy he was to build 😂🤣
But is it hard to put it back together for tomorrow
*huff* Those Americans, getting their culture into everything. Whatever happened to good old Heath Robinson, is what I want to know! I'm only joking; both artists were about as good as each other, and their contraptions equally bonkers!  Ah, you have a shoe for no reason. Good, that's essential for the proper effect. 🧐  I love machine 1, it really fits the genre. :)  Machine 2!!! It's... it's... it's made of devices those guys never imagined, but it fits! :D  Wow! This was _the_ video I never knew I needed to see! I love it so much! 😄
Brilliant
I watch his videos to go to sleep.
the train knocks this orange out of the way and it comes to a stop at this wooden crate blocking the rack, as it falls it hits 6 fidgets device toppling these dominos rolling this ball down the track to make this weight fall making this pull down the trigger above this remote  control hitting this basketball down the train pipes sinking this cup and raising this cup knocking this marble down a downward spiral of doom and despair hitting this ping pong into this hotwheels car including these scissors on the roof releasing this shoe kicking this container  catching on these magnet sending this orange shoe down the tube and then into the glass *gasp* meanwhile this tiny hand it’s another hotwheels car with a sharpened pencil glued on top popping this ballon with marbles inside sending them through this turned cone spinning this wibbly wobbly down this track into this cone weighing down this pully pulling this down with this binary (i think) into these tool switch up this crate connected to this
Why are your inventions so amazing? 😭😭😭
Do you still use this?
Hi
Jessica DiBennedetti
i love ralph and bella
This is so silly, but awesome and inspiring at the same time. I mean, I can't imagine how many points of failures there would be in the first machine, like why not use an Arduino at this point.
Make smart city 🏙️
No
No
good job
bro sleepwalked out of his bed (chair) to show the machine on the camera
Hi Chris, this video is excellent !  My family loves it ! Is the song used around 5 mins in an original composition?? It’s very catchy and stuck in my head 😂
You are from UK huh?
Hi like sai ram 🙏🙏🚩🥭🍋🍓🍍🙏🙏
Dr Chris mean break fast machine
Some will call him lazy, fans will call him an amazing and incredibly talented person ❤
when the CD player said 'hey Siri', MY SIRI ACTUALLY TURNED ON AS WELL lololol
Didn’t the train leave to get the milk? 😂
Funk  😂😂😂
Turned on my Google
It’s cool but it will probably block the way to walk through your house, but at least it’s cool to see how this would work
Chris how do you make these your  amazing!
34 try mean 34 days?
I know how he did the scenes with the different things for each machine. He took the different things, layer them out just right, and then recorded himself destroying them in different ways, and then simply played the footage backwards to make the logos look like they were being formed.
REALLY COOOL 👏👏👏👏👏🦾🦾🦾
69
Does anyone know the name of the song from that bit where Chris was showin off the finished product
I need that! I love lego and breakfast
You are not a lion!!!
now imagine your this bro's neighbor and peeking through the window and seeing this🤯
Hi
Listen to stay
Video but like you
What do you pour first, cereal or milk?  I pour milk
4:50 Bella
But Chris don't you think this would take longer than just to get the cereal yourself?  But good video though
When You wake up your a cat
best vid ever ima make it
You seem to me able to make anything😅
Half asleep chris is soo bright
Bro drinking orange juice with milk
Ok now out of all the Rude Goldberg machines, This by far is the best and efficient one yet Nice job, Chris
when I say that I want my house to be whimsical and quirky, this is exactly the kind of interior decor I mean
What is the tune playing over the final demo? Basketcase by Green Day?
4:11 how did you get the milk to go in the words “machine 3”?😮
Agreed🎉🎉
I love your videos Chris especially your cat videos ❤
HI WHO IS PLAYING THE GUITAR IN THE BACKGROUND.
I’ve wanted this to be a thing for so long
Smart but hard
What if you want to pour the milk first
What if you want more??
Why are there so many verified YouTubers commenting?
Can neVEr believe it
Cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooolll
woah this is so cool 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Maybe you could hjust get a Maid yo make breakfast And it would be less expensive than you spend in your videos
You should have named it the brick-fast express.  Get it?
I already subscribed
Do you still or actually use this?
What song is playing in the bakcground of this?  Can anyone help me figure it out?
When the cd player said hey siri, the Siri on my device activated 😂😂😂😂
4 verified youtube accs quite a breaking record
Why does he use scrabble tiles for text sometimes?
I hope TD Bricks sees this
I made a machine like this for a school project
Book me a ticket 🎟 for this train 🚆
Maybe an idea for if you were to make another one in the future maybe do add some towels around the tracks as a safety feature so if the train were to have an accident the mess would be contained on the towels
yummy!
0:00
Lego pls if you watch this, I say hire him cause he’s a genius
If Chris was sleeping, who was filming?
Breakfast express: hello Alexa and Siri, there is a new competition in town
I still don’t understand how YouTubers like you are able to afford all this👍👏👏👏
if this is what chris can do half-asleep, we are going to be absolutely astonished by what he can do fully awake
I spotted 3 LEGO frogs on the back of the train. AKA The juice car.😅
i love the vids when chris makes train tracks
But the other side is that 😢
Don’t worry, you only need to reset it every time you finish breakfast
omg😮😮😮
Bloody brilliant

When you said 'Alexa' it triggered my Alexa

Be careful,milk and orange juice cannot be together it’s better to wait for the milk or juice to digest then drink
bros electricity bill is probably through the roof.
Cool❤

How are you and the cats? I hope good your the best YouTuber ever I love cats and you make it better

😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎
I would be interested in having you contact me to help me with world building. It might be fun.
So impressive!
The bad thing is you have to set it up all over again 😐😑
"Curly wurly" 💀💀💀💀💀💀💀

Chris at target in the morning: *yawnnn* I hate mornin- | He saw a t shirt that said ”Not A Morning Person” | Chris Again:wait is that THE SAME CLOTHING FOR CATS??!! | The cats come being happy and dances | Ｅｎｄ！ 👇 Pleaseeeeee
Bruh that is so meany tries
I always thought the channels name was “half asleep crisis”
The channel lives up to its name for Shure
I know the instrumental song playing but I just can’t recall what song it actually is. Oasis? No. Ugh. I just can’t figure it out. Someone please help!!!!!
My favorite part is Siri is talking
So happy to see the Jellyfish cd! Are you a fan? Brilliant band ❤
man is gonna turn into mark rober in a couple of years
1:51 hmm yes very interesting      I don’t understand what a word he’s saying can anyone else
That must be a lot of work must be a really hard to do that too it’s really hard looking😮😅😅
i just see bella cross the underneath the train tracks    and he has a donut in his neck cool
yo no way i had to make a rube goldberg machine in science this is way better than my cardboard crap
Getting Wallace and Gromit vibes here - sorry if anyone posted this already months ago, but just found this wholesome channel and loving every minute of it :D
Hi
This was amazing.  Love the digital chain, that's a brilliant idea.
That must have taken such a long amount of time, and LEGO’s. Great job!
U need to wake up to film if it actually works
Do you a video where you do a dinner one
:)
4:56 is when the train starts
For some reason to me he looks like edd Gould from eddsworld
This looks like something from a cartoon😂😂😂
AaaaaaaAaaaaaaaaa
Bru Don’t drink your juice with your milk or else you're gonna get diarrhea.
If you have a Apple Watch and you have a iPhone that you’re are watching this on and it is about 89 percent volume it will activate the Siri
1:06 My head : trying to read the sign as it moved🫠
0:06 wtf is this
This channel is a VERY good one 👍
The Breakfast Express more like the  Success Express
I would try make something like that, but it never worked.
Choo choo!!!
wow i want that in my house to wake up me 6:30 and fast eater 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
4:56 rube goldberg starts here
Or a lego cat fort
What if you made a MEGA LEGO AIRPLANE
I LOVECATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
sorry I really wanted to sub but my computer doesn't let me
hi
It’s like something out of Wallace and Gromit
Your amazing you should make tutorials for building Lego trains
Mate you are so amazing, your videos just bring me personally, but I'm sure a lot of others, so much joy. I wish you all the happiness in the world! Your 21 as t century Rube Goldberg machine was probably my favorite part. Hope you're having a good week
it toke him 56 seconds to explain the first contraption
the music sucks!!!! you gotta stop putting royalty free music in the video!
Don't you have a girlfriend
Just go to kitchen and make the breakfast ❌ Long time build the extreme construction & train which arrive with your breakfast ✅
0:02 same XDD !!
THIS IS WHAT EVERYTHING IS HELPFUL MEANS
Llleeegggooo
❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bro talks faster than my wifi speed
🦛🦏🦍🦍🦏🐪🦧🦏🐟🦍🐫🐟🦏🦬🐬🦈🐂🐃🦘🦒🦬🍶🫖🫘🫘🥛

why lion mask
125
🥳🥳🥳🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
half 12 at night, thanks for activating my google mini that then activated my tv in the Livingroom, making me go downstairs xD awesome stuff
And it is on the floor
Three hours later where's my food.
Incredible work!   What was the relaxing song playing throughout the process? (5:01)
This was 7 months ago.  How is this project holding up?
Yes DDB
i have the same clear cup
If I built this then I would be more interested in the making of breakfast instead of breakfast.
10/10👍
This is so cool nice job👍👍👍
This is so smart why didn't I think of this
SO AMAZIMG!!!!👌👌👌
Eat your heart out, PeeWee Herman.
I need one of them 😃🤩😀

This guy is amazing at making projects, but I always wonder where all the afterparts of the Legos go like this one or the roller-coaster one
dang he passte science i did not
Why don’t you just make it at night for future you
Song bame that plays for the full end run?
This is proof robots are becoming more intelligent as the years past
That is the unhealthiest breakfast ever
I know why he used a cow shake salt and pepper shaker for milk cuz cows make milk
This guys should have a least 50 million subs
So your just a furry until you eat breakfast
Bro was rapping when explaining his mechanisms.
Crazy. Not to mention the training running across the couch.  Bet it was fun taking all that apart.
You should make legoland
Wow I wish I had that 👏👏👏👏👏👏
Disney movie did that
🎉🎉🎉
Or you can just order pizza
That’s a really cool way to getting breakfast
omg youtube
Keep up the good work🎉
Honestly this is the best thing you’ve ever made your my fave ytber
The fun part is restarting it
When you said hey Siri it actually turned on Siri lol
Easier just make cereal in the morning then make this whole contraption so when you wake up you have cereal😂
Do you actually use those?
Bravo 👏🏻
This is awesome!!!
Lets appreciate how much work you put into this video The breakfast express is a really clever idea! A+
Sooooooo cool how long did it take to build
This is awesome!      *but imagine setting this up every night…*
Chris, what is the music in the background as the train is going along. I keep hearing 'Peaches come from a can they were put there by a man' but my partner says I am mad> I mean they has a point but really...
YOUTUBE?!?
I've ofishally been to legoland
british 😈
1:26 ahem...
1:21 Tell Me That Didn't Look Like Chili For A Second.
hmmmmm yes
The cow blinked
Wow this is soooo cool i like this so much
Ok but make one for toast
this is my fav chanel/video even if sometimes u are a savage
Man i love this channel so much! The cats, stop motion, funny jokes, engineering and legos! This was one of your most creative and cool videos yet! My cats approve too.
Chris you have to wake up anyway
For machine 3, you could have timed it a minute later so that if something slows down, it might still have time
6:25
I love this channel because I love cats 🐱🐈🐈‍⬛
Is it really easier refilling everything putting back instead of pouring a simple cup of orange juice and make cereal?
I forgot to subscribe sine the first time I saw a vid a year ago
First of all, WHY THE HECK DOES HE SLEEP IN A CHAIR!?
Why don’t you watch blue lobster
Oh just don't be lazy
You are a GENIUS!!!🤩😊♥️
Please make train station with a cool train
You need to show us how to do that stuff 😅
$939300 bucks for that plss
who was recording when you were asleep???
This video is awesome 👍 I love it
Or... Ask Danielle to make you breakfast
YOUR THE BEST YOUTUBER EVER😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
You are so cool
You really need the golden YouTube Button
This is awesome!!!
woah this is so cool 👏🏼👏🏿👏🏻👏🏽👏🏾
This is the coolest thing On earth☺️
This video is amazing!😊
It’s YouTube!!!!! 😊
This what happens when Mr. Bean has a child. LMAO
This reminds me of Wallace and Grommet.
EEEEEEEEEE
Yes this a cool video
Uk teapot (reminder of uk anthem: god Save the queen x2 (or king sence queen died
so every morning you have to reset the whole entire machine for cereal
He Already Made A Cat Feeder Now He Has A Human Feeder
Massive respect for Chris to say a freaking paragraph in like just two breaths
Awsome you inspire me❤
Why do you have a tiger mask
haters will say the segments in between the machines are in reverse
This is one of my favorite things you ever did
you could've just slept in the kitchen right
Is to fast
I love legos to
Did you live in UK
Coraline!!!
Editing is amazing 👏  <3 you❤🧡💛💚💙💜
I could put a replica to become a morning person on a weekday.
Go To Sleep Now
I’m starting to think that you have a degree in engineering
When he was explaining I couldn’t understand anything 😂
Nice
For anyone who just wants to see the entire thing in action, 4:55
Wow
6:42 this part is gold
Liam Thompson but (smarter, Lego and cats!)
Why don’t you get a buttler
Incredible machine fans unite
The most impressive part is that his cat hasn't destroyed everything immediately XD
I could just imagine Chris getting up to eat breakfast and then taking one spoonful, waiting a second, and the. Taking another one just to show the visual of eating
Absolutely useless...yet so meaningful
Ok, my kids and I watch this video at least once a day. This is the coolest thing ever!!! Now I’m obsessed with the background music you played in this video!!! Can you PLEASE tell me the name of this song? Shazam didn’t work!!! 🙁 Thank you!!! 😀
Can we just appreciate how much effort he puts in his videos.
I love your vidios you put so much efert in your vidios
So one in 34 days you will get breakfast delivered and 33 in 34 days you will be cleaning up messes. That is one way to become a morning person XD
❤
I wish!
My favorite part is the bloopers 🤣
Can u speak русский
Like it
Look the cow is alive 4:38
Do you like Alexa I need to feed it and just put on the telly put them on little so cool and I got that Alexa but not all you need got that circle Alexa bye-bye
I hope you’re happy because I am happy to okay😊
I love all this and I love all your videos
it's Dwight Jr (Clark)
Really cool video, but this is very impractical because you have to set it up every morning
I hate mornings and love your vids!
4:38 the ow blinks
i will never be a morning person. i hate waking up early. especially if i just did something that tired me out.
personally, I would've just made a train that stops my the kitchen so I can prepare breakfast myself, and then once its done and placed on the train it will go to my dining room and stop there. Then we'd eat it, less cool, but it would be easier than this.
😊🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
6:26 the fact that he could have just made that say ‘Alexa, turn on feed me cereal’ but he didnt is interestimg
What make the train move??
Everyones dream lego set
her face was funny
This isn’t really practical
All looks a bit Heath Robinson to me
2222
At 1:26 the dvd/cd says spilt milk
That is cool and I am from the USA and I love the UK
WHAT YOUTUBE PUT A COMMENT!!!
CUCUMBER
You have a very cute face when you smile😊😊
You are very very lazy not trying to be mean but you are I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings most of the time you’re not lazy though😊
Whats with the lion mask?
That part where smart machine get told to activate, it's the smartest practical idea on youtube I have ever watched.
As a American, why do you eat beans in the morning sir (or is that cereal)   Edit:oh it ceral
You explaining everything ,.,.,.,.,.,.,..,.,.,.,.,.,..,.,.😮😶😮😶😮😶every things orange
Wow !
In the cereal part the cd player activated my HomePod in my room😂
Wow thank you for the thank you! Wasn't expecting that. Great machine! Using the voicemail message to trigger alexa was brilliant.
THAT WAS AMAZING!🤩🤩🤩🤩🤣🤣🤣
This is why his channel name is half asleep Chris (⁠ ͡⁠°⁠ᴥ⁠ ͡⁠°⁠ ⁠ʋ⁠)
When you explai the first contraption: Physic teacher be like
I love LEGO trains this is so cool💗✔️😃
Wait YOUTOUB
I wish i could have this in my house
How I pronounce process PR-OS-ES
Thats amazing I need one
This was so funny and so much work was put in to it if I could rate this out of 100 it should be 98/100😊
Wow
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍

I dare you to sell the plushes
Well done on getting the Jellyfish reference in there! Awesome job on the train as well
Congrats on 2 million subs, Chris. You deserve it !!
25 secs to eksplain
lukcy! its so cool of what you think of!
I did chain reaction with Domino’s
i am not a morning person Lion Chris🦁-
You should make a video Whale you made a roller coaster and it was inside
He's British
The final contraption song made me contemplate life.
1:05 Why is the rod not moving
This reminds me of Wallace’s wake up machine in Wallace and gromit
I guess you only have 1 good breakfast but the next day you need to rebuild it 😅😅
correct me if i am wrong, but i think chris is the only lego based youtuber who has more than 1 milion subscribers
i am also not a morning person
Tbh, that looks like a really cozy house to stay up late in
Chris: were good to go Bella: *walks around the house*
These videos r amazing thank u so much!!!
Nice
I love that this is so much MORE work than making breakfast
2:40 Bottom left corner I HAVE THAT LEGO SET
hes orange juice gang
I have the same hotweels car the humvee
Hahaha you have a baby face!!!!!
L O L me like OMG Is that a real lion run!
I'm shocked there are no comments mad that. Chris put cereal before the milk
No
this man is half asleep so it makes sense.
When it said *hey Siri* at 6:26 I have an iPad and my siri responded
My cat watched this video with me.
HOW DID YOU SAY IT SOO FAST
Hi
I have to be honest. It’s reallly wholesome how a grown man can act as a child
At least it’s converse
I saw Bella
How
Nice
Team seas
There's one  who is the man holding the camera while you are still asleep with a lion mask
5:11
The elevated tracks of the finished product gives me Chicago L vibes
Nice editing
The fun part is cleaning it up
6:48 its says that it was for 6pm ?????
That is so  cool 🧡❤✌
the fact he has orange juice after brushing is surprising
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee (edit: a green BSoD occured. CODE: DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION)
Or… hear me out… you make it the day before and eat it in the morning without needing to spend 69000000 years making this… thing? (Joke)
I absolutely love your content yet I only just found out about your YouTube videos and Chanel and how much effort goes into those massive Lego train creations
Oh yeah I forgot about your other cat food project were you made a big marble run I have one that just uses the marbles
All that’s left is to get a good afternoon’s sleep
Addu
New sub!
You must have had. Great fun doing all this gadgetry stuff and getting everything working....you are brilliantly clever Chris and well done it all came good in the end !! 👍
Why do you have a lion head
Juroy oœgjhp yugrot (Bella and ralph in Birdlandic
So this is now officially Wallace & Gromit… perfection!
THIS IS REALLY CREATIVE! You inspire me to do things just like you! ESPECIALLY with my cat! :D
*smacks credit card* *smacks credit card* *smacks credit card*  I WANT THAT!  *smacks credit card*  HOW MUCH!
I subscribed to you for this hardwork
my man is going through more pain to make the train than making his breakfast
This reminds me of chitty chitty bang bang love it chris
why do you have a lion mask
Welldone
Hi, I want to make Rube Goldberg machine can you introduce some videos and books for learning to me?
What about Bella and Ralph?
I love these videos
4:28 you might find something at the left of  machine 1.  *Pin pls*
Dosent whort i can just took the cereal and milk and it well be faster
Wait every morning don’t you have to reset it up every single time
same with me well not technachly when i fall asleep than i just never wake up 1 time i went to sleep and when it was morning i diddent wake up intill nine hours later....
I don’t know how to wake up by myself
That's An Awesome Idea!
This video good
I love the channel
cool i subscribed and i love it
I feel like you're a developer 🤣 spend hours automating a 5 minute repetitive task 😂
well, I think the Wild West is now the break west
Chris said “hey Siri” and my Siri literally answered.
Cool! chris is a furry
I watch these videos every time I come downstairs in the morning
Resetting everything in the evening for proper operation the next morning is more cumbersome and burdensome than just getting TF out of bed and being an adult.
this is a lot of work. I wish i could have that.
Umm you are gonna need to rest it every day
A little stupid but things that work are not stupid
I'm a dog person but I still like cats a little bit
This is some real Wallace and Gromet level stuff here.
You are the best Chris with out you youtube don't exist
Your Channel is so wholesome and creative great job Chris
This guy is basically an inventor but with lego
This video was absolutely amazing in every way, and I in no way regret accidentally clicking on this      also just a question, what cereal is that? It looks really good!
Go to 1:48 to see him explain Really quickly
MY Favorite part was the devices talking to eachother
Don’t you know the peel of lemon makes a juice that pops balloons Oh so you can use The juice instead of a pencil✏️
Orange juice is yellow probably In the inside or yellow
POV: you get and actual engineer to make you a machine that does this without a million steps
when lego can make your breakfast for you
No one gonna talk about how he has orange juice with cereal,no........ok
Hey Chris what do u do first with the cerael do u put the cereal or the milk
Working hard to be lazy in a nutshell
I like and love cats
Uhhhhh how will the train start at the right time again?????? You will be sleeping when the breakfast express will have delivered all the three things right?
👏🏻👌🏻👏🏻👌🏻👏🏻👌🏿👏🏿👌🏿👏🏿👌🏿👏🏿👈👏🏿👌🏽👏🏽👌🏽😾👌🏽👏🏽
When Chitty, Chitty, Bang Bang did it, they also sang.
Chris don't you have to reset the thing every time you use it
dude   youtube itself called you cool
At 3:00 under neith the contraption
Hi 3mon IM 3.6K COMMENTS AND LOLL
Your so underrated! You should have tons of views and subs!
Oh I have an idea have a timer to set off food then activate the track 1 minute later
This is way more work then making breakfast this probably took days
I feel like I recognize the song playing at 5:11 but I can't quite put my finger on it, anyone kind enough to give me a hint lol
Cool
where to buy the walking clock? it looks funny
I love the stop motion tricks it’s Beautiful
this was a cool video . everyone sub and like if this was cool😀
Why are you wearing a lion mask
I think you've finally gone mad
Dude the google part turned on my google
the cow blinked !
5:06
pretty cool
I agree Uetobe!
But then you’ll have to set it all back up again
8:23
There was definetly a sneaky little jumpcut in that juice-pouring section...
I saw bella
But, hear me out, what it you fancy toast ??
You are the best😁😁😉
that very catfood like cereal chris
Please someone stop me from eating coco pops am eating too much
Don’t take this down
Zone love
good bye
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😢😢😢😥😥😥
but sadly i'm not allowed to sub or like the vid
so keep up the good work
and i love lego
and i love your creativity🥸(person being creative)
awesome my favorite video in all your channle... at least until a new one comes out if its cool enough
Waiting for “I built a chair that moves me so I don’t need to walk” episode
I wouldn’t of cared if it didn’t work, I WOULD’VE CARED IF YOU MADE IT POUR THE MILK BEFORE THE CEREAL! Which you didn’t luckily 🙂
I love the stop motion stuff
Did you get inspiration from that scene from Paddington because this is insanely awesome
What I’ve learnt from this vid is that brains = breakfast in bed. I think that next you should put a motor inside of the giant Lego version of the cats u made and make them walk and talk with a Siri or Alexa and bring them to life!
Can anyone tell me the name of this song please?
this wasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssick
In the backrond
I saw rolf on machine 1!
I like the train wuts the original set called
I wonder how many times the train or the Lamborghini fell off 🤔
Cool
Now make a machine that digests the food for you.
RGM Time 1: 01:20 RGM Time 2: forgor 💀 RGM Time 3: 03:17
Alternate name of the video: "A tour of my house"
I'm sorry but I just totally zoned out for a little while......... Danielle must have the patience of a saint.
Any 1 else notice it says pls consider sub
how much work does it take to set it up every night? XD
I know he doesn’t want it to be boring but it doesn’t have to be THAT long like someone’s gonna trip
thats one expensive breakfast
Now this...this is what they mean by Achieve the American Dream
From you when I am a adult I am getting cats
Make your face out of Legos on a picture frame
So that’s why you’re called Half-Asleep Chris because you’re not a morning person.
You know the track is gonna be a cool one when you see a red shoe in it
that channel name should be cat-lego-building-cats-entertainment-reggie-tom-bella-ralph-bella’s donut
Your cat
What if someone tried to call chris while this happened and got “you’ve reached the voicemail of half-asleep Chris. Ok google do i have any events today?”
I can't really understand you right now and I like you and you guys are really really slow so can you move back to that please thank you if you   Can
Sorry got to this late, Chris. Did you know that Rube Goldberg himself graduated with a mechanical engineering degree from the University of California (Berkeley) and that the Engineering Department has a contest with a public event showing these devices in action?
34
That should be a Lego Ideas set
I love this
Looks like a lot more work to make breakfast lol. But I love the Lego train
9:99
Did the Devil in front of that alarm clock
Hey when you use the go pro on the train can you make it so the hole thing is in the train’s vision
This guy is sooooooooo under-rated.
Imagine this video's budget. So much stuff
Getting mad Wallace and Gromit Vibes
Do you pour your milk first or cireal
Good job!👍
I’ve always wanted to do this, keep up the good work
I get it that’s a Rube Goldberg machine but that seems a bit complex
This man deserves more subscribers
Do you eat cat food???????????????????
I love you so much please make more of these❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎❤️‍🔥❤️‍🩹❣️💕💞💓💗💖💘💝
I love it
Ok but the phone thing with Alexa and google is ♾ IQ
Can we all just appreciate him making this and coulring it
YRWAH BYCWETTI
FEED ME CEREAL
My Siri actually thought it was talking to it!
2:19 I have that car in my hot wheels collection and I counted every single car I had and it was 68 one more and I'll have 69 cars
This man is trying to live life as a cartoon and i freaking love it
How do you stay half a sleep when you are doing this stuff every day almost you've been building so many things and I barely get up to go for it 2 hour school wow you spent two days building a Lego set
mom: here comes the choo choo train! me, who is a Lego enthusiast:
do u know about Mark Rober? I think that u shoud serch him watch his vids! They are prety cool too!  (But not as cool as yours)LOL :)
No wonder he's half asleep
That was so great. You one of my favorite YouTubers now!
Oh no! No!
You are the bright side of youtube
But you need to put first the milk, then the cereal.
I love your videos they are so well put together
R u from England?
This is so walis and gromit
DUDE hes brain is so creative at this point os situations your the most greatest youtuber bro hope you reach 2m subs
So little orange juice lol
I saw Bella the cat in this video
Make the longest Lego train
Did u not see the fake cow blink or is it just me?
My god this much big brain required Just to eat breakfast 😂 ik this is only for entertainment but in reality we wouldn’t need so much of effort.. but for one second we should appreciate your hard work bro(BIG FAN KEEP IT UP❤)
The audio when “hey Siri call half-asleep Chris” it actually made my phone turn on Siri lol
Day in the life of using all ur contraptions ever video idea
he kinda looks like the odd1sout
cool
This is the pee wees big adventure movie scene done YouTube style. Saw you on London Bridge Bricks show, I’m a friend of Greg. Happy building! 👍
I have the same remote controlled car lol
The orange juice is yellow because of the type of orange
Who was controlling the train also
Why did u build so much when u can just wake up and make breakfast urself its rlly ez
If you explain it faster I actually understand it better
w
omg this was so cool but you can do it ur self in a min but you put good efort in ur vidoes
You are amazing!
Amazing!!
Also I eat my cereal dry.
Or the tbe
Your videos go super well with a bowl of Mac and cheese
Riddle
Next time can you make something thats not temporary  😌 👌
This is so cool !!!  😍😍😍
My Favorite pet is a little cat 🐱😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
To be honest you and Ralph and bella is the real show
*legends still say that even though the train has left, the orange juice is still pouring...*
I’m glad that the milk didn’t go in before the cereal
down a downward spiral of doom and dispare
Just asking why do you have a big forehead
Then of course Bella was wearing her doughnut
If it had a small bump or two it'd be €€€€
This might help me
Why don’t you just make ur breakfast the day before put some plastic wrap over it and then put it next to u for the morning
1:52 I don’t get it
The creativity of this channel is just… I can’t even explain it it’s so good
4:23. and also why wont you make the clock quicker so you have to run to turn it off as a wakey wakey run?
4:23. why wont you use that as the wakey wakey that you have to run to get?
2:42 and the color orange is the color thats on the fruit tangerine and the color tangerine is on the fruit orange
what do you go with the bowl cereal, i go: planet, house, table and chairs, bowl, spoon, cereal, milk.
1:13 this man lives in hell
Chris: I’ll try to explain it as fast as possible  Me: oh ok sure Also cris at 1:51 LIGHT SPEED BOIIIIIIIIIIII.
2:45 TESTED IT 500,000 TIMES???
I love it and I’m glad you didn’t make it so it pours  the milk first.
MAKE   MOR    pls🥺🥺      ps    im    a  femal
5:04 it says please consider subscribing because you should
I Love u videos
you need to do something what isn't blocking your home
F
"Sorry, I forgot to hit record"
What was the music that was playing starting 5:00? I love it!
Ye
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😯😯😯😯😯🎤🎤🎤🤞🌍
The first machine was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun
i.     love    cat s.
Hahah when the Siri part went on my iPad and phone both turned on Siri.
I saw bella
The sign was made out of Lego
I saw like a sign when the train was going
You activated my Siri 😂
for the 3rd part you should of made it so after the train gets for after a few seconds then the milk dispenses instead of timing it
Doing it by your self is way easier and faster
Jebus mate? You a love child of Wallace & Gromit or something? Only thing missing here is a big cheese.
ur the best TODAY WAS MY WORST DAY EVER BUT UR ALWAYS THE CURE
Insert "Breakfast Machine" from Peewee's Big Adventure
1:50 i did not just understand a word u just said
Meet the Engineer
I was in the UK for a while
Gordon ramsay's brother
This takes so long to get food you can just make food
how did you get the "The Breakfast Express" stickers?
This is my fav vid for the cahanel.
Anyone know the song?
0:00🦁 I am not a morning person. Roar!
Good video man
i love this dudes channel
Amazing video I loved it I just have one question. What happened to the theme song
Lol i would do the same too cuz my very lazy infact so lazy that my motivation always dies halfway through while im making my own videos
Why he be talking in riddles
This is sooooo epic, imagine Chris did it again, except with a FULL ENGLISH BREAKFAST!
I can’t do this fully awake
how about playing
Wow! Amazing vid 👍 I just realised that for the word thing you just reversed a video of you messing up the words, I won’t tell anyone 🤫
How does the cow-shaped jug contains a lot of milk?
It’s official cereal before milk
I wonder if Ralph and Bella are annoyed Chris is using their cat feeder for cereal?
love you 😍
Chris is good at speaking fast
Truly amazing
Dose his girlfriend get mad at him for him taking up the house all the time?
I recently found this channel, I LOVE it.
Dude it’s not that hard pour the orange juice Then in the bowl first the flakes then the milk
Idea: make the timer 3:30 so it will have some extra time
Did anyone else notice the cow blinking
WHERE CAN I BUY THIS?!?!
So amazing
Wait who’s recording when he’s sleeping?
Why do you have OCD
Who was filmen
oOOOOOOOOOoooooOooooOooOoo
When The Robots Work Together It Was Amazing
THIS WAS COOL
Hey chris I love your videos could you make a video about your cats lives with the instant 360
my guy is addicted to legos
Why does the cereal look so weird..
You should've Made this go to your bed
I don’t care about the contraption I just care that you put the cereal before the milk
it worked!
I love your vids
half asleep chris is the  wholesome version of michael reeves
the voice-activated thing chain activated my Google and it was like "I can't verify your voice so no calendar for you"
what if you all ready subscribe
how about... make your breakfast, put it in the fridge, and then eat it the next morning? but this looks like.. really fun too.
:)
This is so cool

Those voice devices are genius
Funny thing is i understood everything
I love your channel out of ever Chanel on YouTube
I Like train
lllllooooVVVVEEE
This man was tired of making breakfast, so he spent the work of 1,000 breakfasts just to have a more annoying breakfast. It looks cool tho
Good you put the circle first and the milk in after
this is so awesome!! amazing work as always Chris ^_^ i hope you have a nice day/night, you always make me smile with your videos :D  Oh dear i completely forgot about this comment
He should have named the train: *”The Brick-fast Express”*
Your videos are so relaxing from this typically mean world God bless you In Jesus name amen 🙂🙏🏼
I wanna ask, how did you pour the milk in shape of the text ‘Machine 3’?
Ok now do it again
I would love to see you have videos showing us how you do these type of things. My brother and I would have such an amazing time following these and making them. They. Make us laugh and Ralph and Bella are adorable spunky and fluffy
It poured a quarter cup of juice
Who puts orange juice and milk on the same meal? Wouldn't that make you sick?
Especially the orange juice pouring machine
Feels like some serious freaking home alone type of traps like come on it’s crazy like most of the stuff looks like that
Hey, Chris, there's one issue with the locomotive, the side rods only drive half the driving wheels, it needs to be connected to all the driving wheels for maximum power
you know you're a lego addict when whenever you think about engineering something, you figure out how to legoify it
I cant imagine reversing the machine to make it ready for the next morning
Very cool but that milk is sitting there all night and would be horrible after not being in the fridge.
AaAa 🥴 so coo
wait, if you are sleeping, then who is recording?
iove your channel half asslep chris
Would it be harder to have to set it up everyday?
WOW CHRIS! im amazed i love legos and i love contraptions and this is just perfect , keep up the good work!
👌👌
🐱✈🐠
Ingenious!
I love everything you do for your videos keep up the amazing work
I have exact basketball u used
inspired by paddington im thinking
Well Chris had turned into not a morning lion now -_-
What is that song? It sounds so familiar, but can't put a name to it.
That’s exactly what I need
Your hard work really pays!!
You make a train that gives you breakfast but then you dive deeper so you make 2 other trains, one that gives you lunch and dinner
i love how it had nothing to do with the kitchen
Haw is this guitar Song called? Btw. Your voice is sooo calming
🌏🌍🌎
THE COW BLINK💀
4:48 Bella Bella Bella Bella Bella lol
I also have a Rube Goldberg machine
The dedication thoooo
so who Is recording
THIS IS SOME CAT IN THE HAT MAGIC!
Umm question don't you have to reset that every time
6:24 : Artificial Intelligence? more like Artificial stupidity
You can be botherd to make this complicated thing but not pour your breakfast...
Can you do a cat update on Bella and Ralph
Well done Chris!😊
I like how this guy started his video wearing a lion mask    7:40  *L I O N M A S K*
Wow, that is so cool!😃  I wonder how people make such awesome machines!
Fact you cab see the lego globe
i could not keep puting this back up befor youngo to sleep
Whits music do you yous  the moment the train did his run for the first time complete
Haha lego train go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
Just like jellybean fans once said but it's proper, "It's not a Mistake, Its a Masterpiece"
I love this
At the very least you don’t pour the milk first
i keep forgetting this man has such a smooth baby face ☺️
Your cereal looks very tasty🥣
i love machine 2, how they communicate to each other to tell them to put the cereal in the bowl. That was genius, you should do that on more of your videos
Imagine not being able to pour cereal and a glass of orange juice
Your channel is so awesome :D
hmm im confused why there is a cat but the smart cat feeder is brand new? ( i sub )
6:47 my favorite part😍
I love your vids
i perfectly love it! You could have a lunch train a dinenr train and a breakfast train and suffer some cleaning procees
This channel is not just absolutely amazing but super wholesome! Splendid content sir! :)
I saw Rolf!
At least put the train in your bedroom on the counter so that you wake up turn it on and bamb
@machine1 chris: spiral of doom and dispare  me: why dispare?
I bet he won’t use it again lol.
I mean Siri
I have alxer
Nice breakfast and train
at the eletrick part it turned my google on
At 1:50 i laughed for like a day my mom was like what are you laughing
I need this because most people here can agree we are not morning people
Well, there is a downside, he WILL have to set up everything again
Ok how much for the whole system?
how do you sit on the couch? 7:32
this reminds me of wallace and gromit
JUST STOP IT HOW DARE YOU POUR THE CEREAL BEFORE THE MILK HOW DARE YOU
i like trains
NICE
Do you actually use this every day?
This was astonishingly incredible. Amazing!
I have a challenge. Please find LEGO Ralph on this video.
Woah so much for all off those i guess your going to have to pay extra for foods
Nice breakfast express
Yum 😋
The camera man while he is sleeping be like:  I n v i s i b l e   p o t i o n
This is SOOOO creative, I LOVE IT!!!!😍😍
Things science can never answer:  Where we go when we die   And Where on earth the things go after half asleep Chris finishes a video
4:56 no wonder why they call you half asleep Chris
wait the camera is off...
Saturn V lego set in the back ground
wow yet again an impeccable build -- also may i ask the song you used for this video? :)
*epik video half asleep chris*
Good idea nice why smart genius🧔🏻
how many subscribers can i get with this comment
u r amazing👀
HOW DO YOU GET A CAT TO TRUST YOU IF IT WONT LET YOU GET CLOSE TO IT                  help me my cat hates me       (i think
How is he filming?
(starts humming Elfman's "The Breakfast Machine") I've been binge-watching your lego awesomeness all morning!
everyone don’t worry half asleep chris pores the milk last
. u good?
You've never seen PeeWee's Big Adventure, have you? I STRONGLY suggest you watch the scene at the beginning where he uses his own automated breakfast making machine. Really, the whole movie is a gem. And I encourage anyone who agrees to say so in a reply because we need to convince Chris to watch it. I hate to be THAT guy to tell you to watch a movie you'll probably never watch. But just watch how many people will agree with in replies what an amazing movie PeeWee's Big Adventure is. And in reality I know there will probably not be a single reply to this because that's just the luck I have lol.
Machine 2 is so cool
I mean with chris a video like this is normal
Alright boys I know what I want for my birthday
my siri opened while watching this vid😂
Add a comment...
I have the exact same remote control car and it's a Lamborghini
Ostty and sherlock their my favrit little dodz to.
First the milk than the cereal
Why does this remind me of Wallace and Gromit haha.
ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ
This has some serious Wallace & Grommit energy.
The Bella wallpaper made me smile
amazing!
You know why I love this channel? It doesn’t change. Unlike many channels which start nice, but become too different, this channel is always the cute, cat-loving Lego set stuff I saw years ago.
I’m eating breakfast rn-
When it said ‘hey Siri’ it did it on mine screen
Too good. I should have a timer to watch this channel at 8 PM everyday
What happened to Reggie?
Which cat do you like more Ralph or Bella?
I had the pee wees playhouse theme in my head watching that lol
Where do I buy this I will pay 100000000000000000000000000000000 dollars or pounds
I love your videos, keep it up!
500000 TIIMES
53K LIKES!!!! : !€’zm
This is everyone's childhood dream
I’m trying not to be mean but your voice does not match your face
I wish I had that one too
This is so smart and the editing is so *chefs kiss* muah!
0:02
Lol I got an Uber eats as before this
👏👏👏👏wow congrats  cool

this dude is just a proffesional person
I’m actually a Lego fan like you I have a Lego Marc it’s shaped like the mugs that are in Lego basically in the same Lego but overall size
Do you eat cocoapufs thats my favorate cereal

Your cat is so cute

What if you make a supper train? Yep u hate making supper? Well, you dont have to! Say hello to the Dinner express!
All you need to do is just what was i going to do??!?,!
imagine doing all that to just have to get up and get a spoon to eat the cereal
Or just put your Cereal and Milk and O-Juice to the table before going to sleep
This is so cool
click the blue text!↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
And I thought robots were taking over…
The amount of pain it will take to re build all that after breakfast you gave yourself more work
Lol, when it said “hey Siri, call Half-Asleep Chris, it actually activated Siri on the same device! I had absolutely no idea that was possible!
i miss the cats no hate honestly but i just miss when he would make awesome contraptions for his cats
The English mark rober
why not call it the Express-Fast
This reminds me of a scene from padington
Nice
The digital one is so cool
Who is filming the train?
Pewee Herman would be proud so would doc brow or back to the future .
When the music player said ‘hey Siri’ it actually turned on my Siri ! 😂
Knocking this marble down a downwars spiral of doom and despair
4:20 The hell kind of torture device is this??      Yet effective
How are you recording it
Actually a face reveal
All this for a bowl of cereal
Hi
Sdmijvkuhn
siri alexa and google are talking to each other
Imagine putting this back together just for another breakfast
This dude recreated the 11:25 from Wallace and Gromit
Hee hee
Chris’s Siri turned on my iPad’s Siri LMAO
Thats just breakfast with extra steps
this reminds me of the lemonade machine (if you dont know what that is then you are probably a baby)
yOU KINDA LOOK LIKE  ED SHERAN
How did you get the milk in that position in the first place?
Omg I wish I could be as awesome as you;)
Heres somthing i noticed being a railfan and train nerd or geek the locomotive used is a american type 4-4-0
THIS guy does impossible things just think about it
Ngl
U just wasted lots of materials cuz ur prob not going to keep doing this and setting it up every single day
Hey

Tis dude deserves at least a trillion subscribers for how much time he takes including the transitions and I literally mean it
you are VERY smart
"I am not a morning person" Same, I usually wake up in the afternoon.
Watch the cat vid with the tiny camera Chris and my name is Chris too
Your cat is watching u on a camera in your room and has a big crazy room with his own monitor
Milk lore: cow vomits milk
You made one for me remove the milk machine
all this to not get out of bed in the morning
I love how he wants an automatic breakfast machine to do all the work for him, yet it takes more work to build the automatic machine than to make his own breakfast manually. Love this video :)
How much did all this cost?
Which Lego set is that
Cool video but.. its gonna be hard getting round your table now
The
one problem is setting up the things again for the next day
You are one of the most amazing people on YouTube I've known
When you where explaining stuff I thought It was a song. Idk honestly
WOW
You must become a after-work person...because setting this machines every day after work is going to be really exhausting! Haha Amazing system by the way! Subscribed!
when he said alexa my alexa tured o
chris when he gets his breakfast: Ah, this is the most perfect morning ever! realising he has to reset the intire thing 1:50
4:49 oh look bella

Ratio
Anyone know the song at 5:00? It sounds so incredibly familiar, but my brain is struggling in recall.
Mark rober with Lego be like :
10/100000000000000000000000
9+1=21
10/10
The mumbo jumbo irl
this guy needs to make a rap song
Thank you for the relaxing and wholesome content
Why don’t you make the cats one they would love it plus you wouldn’t have to refill it because the robot could refill it whenever it’s empty
You are Mr Gruber from Paddington movie irl.
I wanted to know how much tea was spilled when he "Yes! It finally worked!"
Walter jr : give it to me
There are other more extensive Rube Goldberg service machine creators out there, but this is definitely up and coming in the genre, especially for a person who is not a specialist in it, and not afraid to show the development stages either.  There's more personality to it that way, when it's obviously not an immaculate conception (or should I say immaculate contraption?)
You… are… amazing
Your Channel Is the Most Unique YouTube Channel I Have Ever Seen. You Are a Great Youtuber!
Bot
more train plese
Awesome! Just AWESOME!!
he could of just gotten up and eaten breakfast in 10 minutes, instead he took (probably) a week long project to do it for him. what a lad
How long did this take?
walter white jr will love this
The train technicly brought the breakfast the machine did it all thought the train hit something so it worked but over alll …………. It’s super cool
U need more subs so underrated
YOU HAVE TO RESET IT EVERY DAY
Chris: *wakes up* Also Chris: ***TF2 SPY SCREAM***
These builds look really cool, I will definitely have to try this challenge with my friends , thanks 🙏
I had a Rube Goldberg Machine book as a kid and spent hours imaging them work...now we have YouTube
Bella 😺🍩 4:47
now you have to put everything back for next breakfest
I bet it was a lot of work when you had to make the extra kart
living with this man must be both a blessing and a curse
Machines! He is one of my favorite YouTuber
Wait, did you say Joseph
But one problem very very little orange juice
Wow
Imagine having to redo all yhe contraptions every day🤣
You should do one Around your house but with  the flexible tracks  btw it is cars tho like the lego train you did
8:22 i don’t understand a thig
Amazing idea!
Half asleep chris? More like full asleep Chris! Am I right folks?
Nice vid
omg
That’s half a glass of orange juice 😂
I love your videos
Ok Wallace from Wallace and Gromit
My favourite breakfast  is  coco pops
If I finished building this, it would stay with me till I die
You and Colin furze should share notes
Minecraft auto farms irl
Now the real question is: *Do you have the motivation to reset it all for the next day?*
wallace and grommit irl lmao
You the best. Youtuber
WERE THOSE CHOCO KRISPIS?!
1:06 i thought this was the end of the video for a sec 🫥
I think he is so creative because none of us could think of these weird and wonderful creations. But, even if I did, I wouldn’t think to make it out of lego.
1:50 My teacher explaining something hard in a super hard way :
this guy is mark rober but in lego form.
May you get Ralph a catmint pillow
have use it???????????????????????????????????????????????
Fffff& ;  guess
I LVE YOU😀
The riddler
And who is calling Siri
When u sleep
So who   is video as the train go
At least it pores the cereal before the milk
You're like a real life Wallace :)
How do you afford all this?
How scientists in cartoons get their breakfast
Huge missed opportunity to call it the Breakspress
Daniella sitting in the house like:  🚆😐🚂
imagine someone calls him and hears that voicemail
when he said Alexa I was like oh no my Alexa it has turned on so turned it off haha😂😂😅😅
When it hit the “hey siri call half-asleep chris” my siri turned on
Mmmmmmmmmm
What was that music at 5:01?
I thought stress eating would cheer me up but this hits different keep it up😉🌴🫒🫑🌽🥕🥦🥬🥒🍓
Mark rover  but Lego
When the CD player said hey Siri my Siri went off like it said yes what do you need
This thing turned on my siri, XD
This made me hungry.
This guy is definitely my favourite YouTuber
This is so cool. You have inspired me to make my own Goldberg machine.
it wasn't fully made out of Lego although if your going to make a machine that makes breakfast I guess we cant all be heroes
The 3 minutes 17 secs that my birthday March 17th…
Omg he made the pee wee herman machine
Ralph tbh looks just like owlkitty ngl
Few years ago when Reggie died I was extremely sad, I hoped nothing liked that happened again, and then Tom died and I started to cry at that point.
Why do I love this video so much
this was great. I'm thinking you should make a simpler one that you don't have to reset
Man just added 60 more steps to making breakfast.
I tested it 500,000 times is the part that made me burst into laughter more than getting a reading across Broward Singh and some certificates a medal and a trophy
0:48 This is the most British thing I've seen in a while
i watched your cat castle video, now I want you to make a train and call it ralphs railway
U 100% turned on my Google
My cat passed a few weeks ago he looked just like Reggie
Aight, $20 good?
I've likes your videos on the cats and ur lego train sets. Mabye do a video where u make the cat's their own little train that drives around with a remote control?
You and your cats a so cool and the best
Half-Asleep Chis is the best!😆😆 i have been waching you senes i was 5
Man was spitting bars faster than Eminem
i wish your uploads were more frequent but they are good and we all enjoy your videos
i was watching this video and suddenly my alexa said "Sure, what do you want to turn on?"
At lest you put the milk in the train
Cool 😎 then make it yellow
when will your website be sented
Hello British mark rober
This sounds like something Wallace and Grommit would make. In fact, I'm not entirely sure they haven't already built something like this
This feels like something out of the grinch. I love these wholesome types of videos
That would be a pain to reset
The worst thing about this is setting the machine back up.
The Breakfast express is right on track also explanation speedrun 1:46
How did you make this. REPLY OR I POUR MY TEE IN THE TRASHCAN!
Can you get Ralph reggie's old golden gate bridge
I love how he very casually said "and it only took 34 tries"
Hello!! I love all the t things you built, I also love legos but we can’t afford them. But I just wanted to say that, most of the stuff you build is like Futuristic! I love all of the stuff you build.   I wish Reggie still lived.. but he and Tom are both happy up in heaven. They deserve it. Though I’ve never really seen Reggie, I still know how much I love him and Tom, even Ralph and Bella are so cute! You should make like a train thing going around a fort for the cats to maybe ride in, or play with. :D   Also, very awesome job on getting 1Million subs, I could never get it but I’m proud on how many I have right now, even if I don’t have many subs, I still wish that you will get at least 10Million subs and over!    **You’re House is also really nice! :D**
A clockwork orange.
My grandmother was watching this while drinking coke and it came out her nose 👃 when she saw the lion! Ha ha ha!
I started watching today and OMG I LOVE THIS CHANNEL

Can you build a video game based train from the PlayStation action games?

Paddington vibes.
You should make another one of these with the new Lego trains coming out August 1st
Can you make an animal theme train ride like the Christmas one?

He's clearly seen the movie Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
I LAVE IT
...coraline.
Wow this is truly amazing, but won’t you have to replace the materials every day?
1:49 so fast ⚡⚡⚡
You need to make an ending theme song. Sometimes the cut off seams too  sudden.
Very epic coraline moment
For someone who lives in the United Kingdom I would expect a British locomotive but beggars can’t be choosy I’m pretty sure that locomotive is called the fire fly which is an American steam locomotive 🚂
Make a cat Disney land pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease🥺🐈
At 4:38 I swear I saw the cow blink
Hey Chris! Your videos are amazing! Someone I know is struggling with many stray cats on her property (at least over 45, one pregnant) and we’re going to set up a website. I know that if you saw this comment, you’d be one of the best people to help with this! The website will advertise pictures of each cat, and has a price for it (most likely low so we’ll have more purchases).  If you see this comment, and if you can, help us spread the word! The city is getting quite impatient with the cats on their property. We need your help! Thank you so much!
he's dead
Did no get even one get one word on machine 1
Why is he take forever to upload a new video everytime
Your voice makes me happy
Can you make a Lego train that can fit Ralph? And ride it around?

Epic!

Keep the content up       best video I watched today😊
I like your videos
Last time I subscribed and I came back to the channel and wasn't subscribed but I subscribed again
I have only one word...             Amazing
The train is great and helped me a TON in my school project, which happened to be a chain-reaction inspired by Rude Goldberg. I have 1 question though, do you take it down after? Because if not that would be a little annoying to get around.
hey chris can you show daneil in one of your vids!!
I love your channel and I feel sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo so bad for you because you lost 2 cats and you do so munch hard work but still keep up the hard work my friend
Me never eing able to do this:heh heh, t-this is e-easy

We’re living in 2022 and this feels like 2034

Imagine setting it back up every day…
The editing it should be very hard
I hope Ralph doesn’t plot to rob a bank because of one of the videos you have he is a to some suspicious things in night
The cow blinking at 4:38 is SO UNSETTLING
How is your loved one fine with large lego express machines sooner or later the house is gonna turn into a lego train station
Hey Chris! Me and my brother thought of a funny song for u using Ralph and Tom’s theme!  “Half-Asleep Chris He’s my favorite tall human, Half-Asleep Chris He’s my favorite tall dude, Him and his girlfriend Danielle feed us food, Subscribe to make him happy and love us too!”
Hey Are you grain from hermit craft

4:49 did anyone see bella in this frame or is it just me?
Imagine someone calling his phone and getting sent to voicemail hearing the ‘Ok Google what are my events today’
This is more work than making 1 years worth of breakfast
Bella is soo cute
Im scerd you hove not made a vit in a long time
It’s like the contraptions in the movies!!
I love this video because of machine #2
3 weeks in to 2022 lego train sets !!!!!!!

You know what’s automated? Getting Someone to do it for you,but where’s the fun in that?
This greatly reminds me of Wallace and Gromit for weird reasons. Tops to ya! :D
We all need to wonder what if Tom and Reggie were still alive?
Normally a cup of coffee is my breakfast 😋 ☕
Hi Chris I love the videos and I do miss Tom and Reggie can you do one video on them like old videos from them

Hi Chris I'm a big fan I love cats too. But I was wondering if you could possibly make a Lego version of bella? If not that's no problem anyways I hope you have a good day!

Why does Ralph don’t get a doughnut but Bella does and I put a I put a camera on my cat for 24 hours in the area where Ralph spies on half asleep Chris he answered his question why do I don’t get a doughnut I think he wants a doughnut
This is kind of dumb. Because you'll (maybe) have to set it back up each time you use it. And what if you run out of one of the things?
Make a lego Bella please
You are so fast
i like how this made after 1 day on titanic sink 110 yars
You must be very smart

I think we have the world record for longest chain reaction
I wonder when your going to make a video on the New Zealand currency. I live in New Zealand and I think that we have very cool banknotes
This is just working hard so you don’t have to work
The hey Siri worked on my iPad

This feels a lot like Wallace and Grommet for some reason.
when the radio turned on and asked siri to call u it turned on siri on my phone
Make these 360 videos please!
But, what you could also do is pour the milk, make the train put it in the microwave, pour the milk out so you can put the cereal in first, and then pour the milk back in.
This is the next future Elon musk

When the alarm clock ring that type of alarm clock you get-up looked like a penny and playing rage over a lost penny by Ludwig van Beethoven
The breakfast 🧇 Express is okie

Great video! Your cats are so cute! A tip for making lego contraptions: There is a robot machine thing called a Lego EV3. You can code it using simple blocks and it can automate tasks using things like motors and sensors! You put so much effort into your videos, and as always, keep it up!
imagine trying to call him but instead of a message telling that he isnt available it says: ok google, do i have any events today?
Can I give this 500 thumbs up? I can't remember the last time I laughed so much watching a YouTube video. You're brilliant!
112244
i like how it took more effort to make the train than to just make the food
I think just making breakfast normally is better
You are amazing
Chris: I tried it 500 thousand times  Chris Later: And it only took 34 tries!  Chris at the end: The several million times it went wrong
i mean preparing a breakfast is faster then re build this hole stuff ngl
Hi Chris! I have been watching all of your videos in order for the past 2 days(including today) and I just wanted to say you are definitely one of the best content creators ever! Also I love Tapirs!
Why didn't you got a bo ah oh wa wah
Build a Lego Reggie please to remember that cat that awesome cat
Half asleep Chris is always making my life good :)
Btw, you have roller coaster track, train track, and a haunted house, as well as a Lego Ralph; ever thought about building a cat-themed Lego theme park?
Lego
Hi ,  do you have a PO Box Address?  My son who loves your channel, would like to send you some drawings. Thanks 😊
Like its Joseph's Machines.

How’s your cats
these videos are halarious i love them
People thinking he is lazy for not making breakfast  Me: bro he made this hole contraption o he doesn’t have to make breakfast
Can u slow down talking?
I dont understand that
Best vlogger on youtube by far!!! Great content & put together beautifully!!! Wallace & Gromit have nothing on Chris 😉
You know what’s the bad thing is that then you do it you will have replaced sometimes to redo it
I like your videos I have a cat looks exactly like Bella but she’s name is Emma 🐈
It’s amazing how much effort he out into this
Hi Chris I love your videos ❤️ please please make a lego Clock tower featured in one of your videos
what about a train going through all the environments like rainforest, desert, ocean.etc
Are u the bad guy in the Batman
Cool
Who needs this machine if you have a mom that loves you?
Its called a random person and a gun  (Joke lol)
How are the cats
I Love your channel and I love this Rube Goldberg Machine because it sounds so good
Mark Robert but blonde,glasses,cats,british and lego
Lego
It gives me "padington" vibes
Teach your cats how to play games like minecraft
Cats  are cute.
You have cutekittycats.  Can you read the text.

CAN WE SEE TOM THE THE OR DID E DIE???
Plz add the Bella and Ralph plushes back pls🙏
I like how he casually says “it only took 34 tries”
I've never seen a guy eat cereal and drink orange juice at the same time before. I've only seen that in commercials
Who eats cereal with orange juice (sorry for people who actually do)
I miss those currencies related videos
so cool Les gooooo
but I wanted toast... :(
Very useful 👍👍👏🏻
Oh what Danielle has to put up with.
Chris p.s upload I miss it.
Now I know why he is called HALF ASLEEP Chris
I like trains and your videos!
I am genuinely curious on how man attempts this took you on everything or if possible an average for each contraption
🥣🛤🚞🚊🚉🚂
Having all the technology devices talk to each other is kind of funny and also fun to watch
I have alwayssss wanted to do this
Are you grain?
Chris you look way too much like the riddler it’s almost scary
Now this is cool and all but don't you need to reset it every day after you use it? And its alot more work if something goes wrong, just saying
cool! But do you put all of ur stuff u make in ur garage or basement???
you should make a part to that resets the whole thing by the push of a button or chat with alexa
I love the amour of work you do in your videos
I love your videos so much❤❤😊
moreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  mazzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss with Ralph PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSEE

Alternate title: tour round my home
I love how this is harder to set up then doing this manually 😂😂😂🤣😂
Omg I waited so many days I thought u died☹️
Chris I love your videos and your cats and it’s heartwarming
Chris can we expect *lunch machine* please 😅😅
Why do these when u just can do it normally in 10 secs
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
Chris' fully wake now i guess
1:25 why are there dominoes and a cd there?🤨
One word: AMAZING 🤩
I put the milk in first
Easily one of the best most creative channels out there
If you can make that whole contraption why can’t you just make your own breakfast
I think you should  do a breakfast train again it so good
Chaotic Good
Yes
Were is my cat I got it but it isn’t here😡 I got it when it was on the shop
Breakfast in 2030
Shaw of the sheep vibe!
i agree with the maybe two other people i saw who said this, but i'd love to hear the song at 5:00 on its own!
how can you build that and you have a cat
Do you keep all your Lego stuff
MAKE MORE VIDEOS PLEASE and also I am using my mum's laptop
Want some tea mate?
Make another machine that makes a pizza hmmmmmm yummy 😋
Making breakfast is way more faster and simple then this but I have no idea how u did this epic idea
Can you please Make More shorts because your videos takes a lot of Time and would like to see More content of this amzing channel More often
Half-Asleep Chris is the onky youtuber that can get away with not posting much.
Hey, can you make your cats (Bella and Ralph) a fort? Or city?
Man, this guy is good at redstone
Can you adopt a puppy  This doesn’t mean that I don’t like cats I love cats and dogs
Chris I have missed you videos so much!
Chris: "I am not a morning person "  Me: "who is?"
I just like that he poured the cereal before the milk.
I really love these guys vids hope you get more subs
You should make another train video for Halloween!
One small step for mankind, one long breakfast for mankind
Amazing
I think that the Lego train is Worse than making your breakfast
What if you get burnt out on that breakfast?
Shoes???
the mom 2.0
I found a golden bear
I noticed Rolph from your lego ralph video
Wow amazing lego 😲😎✌️ my dreams yeahhh fans huhu 😁😎😊✌️ hopefully my opensea pictures can be sold yeahhh😉😲😊✌️
ACHOOOO 🤧
Hey where’s Coco?
Wall-E in 2022:
Train that serves breakfast... I've seen that in chitty chitty bang bang
Bro this is sick
shouldnt you make the travel signpost updated?
Great video, I wish I had one of those. Also for extra fun watch the video again at 2x speed starting at 4:53 but at the same time play the song "The Breakfast Machine" (From "Pee Wee's Big Adventure") by Danny Elfman. It's hilarious!
we had alot of cats outside out door playing with our plants it wasn't ours but one day I saw one of the cats having a wound. and it looks like it's gonna die. we can't do anything about it because the mother cat is very protective. I hope it doesn't die I'll keep you updated!
4:38 the cows eye lmao
Morning yes
OMG this is revolution of making meal. I have to have this!    Nice video
You live in my favourite country uk 🇬🇧
RIP TOM
THER more to Lego big heads
People who builds buildings:finally a worthy enemy
2:16 eminem been real quite
This sounds like something Wallace would make
I love this channel every time it uploads! I love your cats vids! (You can call me blue if you want to!)
Mark Rober would be proud :)
I guess it's canon, I'm too tired and lazy to get my own breakfast.
1:22
Does anybody remember the Ralph and tom theme song
Here is Timestaps if you want to see it again so here 5:00
This is probably my favorite channel
Chris is on another level this is so cool and the best VIDEO 😎🇬🇧
i dont care how long a video takes to come i love them all i check evryday and if theres nothing new i wach the  other ones cause i love em all
He is actually half-asleep
Who was holding the 📷 ?
4:49 Bella!
In the amount of time the train took to prepare everything, he could’ve had eaten breakfast like twice already.
CHRISSSSAAJ THIS IS THE BEST VEIDOEE IVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIIRERE LIFE btw can anyone explain how in the world did YouTube join 52 years ago?
Half asleep Chris  I love you videos and also an big shout out for you girlfriend  for make videos much better  and Bella is a loth of bread lol
how does your girlfriend let you do this stuff lol? I am sure if I tried to do this with my girlfriend she would shut it down immediately
everthings orange because orange juice  -halfasleepchris
Channel your inner Mumbo!
A truly imaginative invention, great work Chris :)
should have called it brexpresst
Dude i have a alexa in my room it triggered
im one of those who like hearing you explain everything in full detail. i have a question tho, how do you turn it on?
I wish u included Cortana to do the”Siri, do I have any events today?

The Spiderman lego you built 5 months ago is quite rare to find at a low price its said for that one each piece is 10 cents in us cash
If you call this guy lazyy look what he built tea
Why are you wearing a lion mask
Full Joseph machine time
This video is amazing hope you have a good day
This confused me 1:50
So…you eat cerea with oj?
Open a new youtube tab.... Search for "Breakfast Machine Elfman" Play first video Return to this video at around 05:20 or so....  Perfect
yo you have blown up so much i remember the first video i saw by you which was the lego train video
SO MANY THINGS!
Wot hapin to tom
This dude is basically mark rober with a lower budget
I had to make a rube goldburg machine for school, best thing Ive ever done in my life
You need to play peewees breakfast machine theme whenever this being used
and reggy
My birthday is on the 28th of April, could you make something for me?… 🥺🥺🙃🙃
I want one
rip your old cat's :(
I only found this channel 10 days ago and I can’t stop watching this channel amazing
I still miss tom rip
The part where you say everything about his breakfast machine though
Y yr Website Down
We all need someone like Danielle, who had to crawl under a Lego train, pass a funnel of lentils, and make it out the front door, without knocking over dominoes, or tripping over string, on her way to work in the morning. I truly envy her.
Chris you never fail to make my day your wholesome are always amazing. I really appreciate the amount of effort you put into your videos. you really deserve more subscribers as your creative videos always put a smile on my face
cool build but one thing, next time please don't place two water buckets near a lot of smart devices! cheers
Cris i have a cat shes ♀️ her name is lili shes like an 😇 she even helps at aur rutine and shows as wat to do next
No wonder his name is "Half-Asleep Chris"
My way is make a button at the side of my bed and when i prees it the train go and il put a senser at the cereal place when it hits the border the sensor triggers and il put a clock so when the time is almost up the cereal is supose to in the bowl and next the milk uhh it the same and the orange juice is also the same uhhhhhh YEAH I THINK ITS A VERY GOOD IDEA Im kinda lazy its all the same
What happen to tapir & thunderstorms?
Hey Chris!  I wanted to ask you, in what program do you edit the video, if not a secret?
more cat videos pls
Great
is it worth it because you can just make it for your self but i like the effort and the video . keep it up :D
Co-Co-pops?
Can you make more Leto buildings stuff you inspired me and it’s so fun to watch your videos and see your channel grown I hop you get 2million subscribers
Can we please have a few seconds of quietness because he made those milk blowing and others like the machine 2 screen and he just laying it all out and also the machine layouts too
Stressing the motor when waiting you will spoil the motor
I would really appreciate if you saw this comment   So I just got new kittens and… I realize that they’re the same color as your cats and the same gender their names are Mawu and Soboo. Soboo is the black one and Mawu is The tiger striped one they look exactly like your cats.
Person:how many tries did it took to achieve this? Half asleep chris:too many
I have one question why are you smart
Is it just me or are british people super entertaining to listen to?
this is so cool
If you ever do a QnA, I have a question; How do you make the white outlines so perfectly?
u😐🤣😂😺😯
This was very smart and it’s cool and sorted out
🐈😢🏃🤔🤕
🐈🐈
Hehehe that’s funny I wish I had breakfast like that
I wish I could buy this …….
The explaining is like when google finally has a chance to talk about (whatever) !
Actually amazing
So... basically you eliminated the process of pouring milk and orange juice, but to set up the reaction you have to spend 20 minutes? I want such a machine too xD
El ladrillo de Chris
I have 4 cats 2 boys 2 girls max is flufy gijit is a torda shell and lunu is kind and ash is gray and shy
My favorite country in The United Kingdom is Wales 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿
2:04 sorry what?
I like the part where all the devices talk to eachother
You're rapping 1:47
You’re almost at 2M subscribers, keep up the work!
This is the best video ever wached. Chris.
Chris!!!!!! Why didn't u post a new vid in 2 months what where u doing!!!!!
When you can just tell someone to make it for you........
Yay lego i love your vedeo
wow
Make a lego rollercoaster that could fit both ralph and bella
This dude looks like the riddler
This guy needs to get to 10m subs
Amazing Alex
Him: **explaining really fast**    My brain: 😀 what **trying process what happened**
Rube Goldberg machines usually only work once, and that's when they actually work.
You are the most wholesome channel I’ve ever seen
I literally thought you were dead... your still back after all these years
I feel like waiting for this machine takes longer that making breakfast but love this so much
you and danielle should 1000000000% get married, youve been together for 3 or more years now and your so cute together  like if you agree!!!!
I love Cocoa Pebbles!
Nice video. What happened to the theme song and the plan for the cats to play the song on instruments?
Love ur vids keep up the great work
I've been follwing since the pre 100K days - Chris I'm so happy you can make a living doing this now, you;ve done the hard yards you deserve every success
When you realize that Chris built this whole thing and that his breakfast it’s going to get them under the time that he built this it’s just sad
awesome editing and you have a lot of time making things and vacuuming up the cocoa puffs and then reversing the footage egg-selent job!
This is so great!
What type of cereal is it  looks like coffee beans?
Dude this dude does all these videos for less than 1.5m subscribers?!?!? At least give him 7 million subscribers (if outdated I don’t care)
This reminds me of that Paddington scene
humans.. have evolved to be lazy as flipping hell, they make automated stuff so they can just sit on their arse all day.
This is AWESOME
Can't wait until I've got my own apartment so I can do stuff like this
Colin Furze + Joseph machines + cats= Half Asleep Chris.
OH MY GOSH I MISSED IT
Once I put on my glasses in the morning I’m like good morning during a stretch and I’m up and At them. Also I stretch a lot.
Chris is making Wallace and Gromit a reality
i like how you can barely get any orange juice
Yeah u have pretty much became a lego-tuber
plese
plese sub to Greytron
hey haLF ASLEEP CHRIS HOW R YOUR CATS DOING
Remember cereal first then the milk it's the law
Orange juice and cereal…. You evil man
Reminds me of Coraline
oh btw i am a kid
bro your a million away from 2.00 subcribers! i will subcribe!
I swear Bella looks like my old cat called sam
WE HAVE TWO ALARM CLOCK ON WHEELS (a roll alarm clock) A black one and a white one, other than that yours and ours look exactly the same!
Chris officially supports milk after cereal!
what's the music a t 5:01 pls tell if you know
That is a great idea ! In the morning I feel cranky before I have breakfast
1:09, 3:02, 4:08  haters would say he played it backwards.
I would rather make my own breakfast thank you very much
THIS THING IS SO COMPLICATED AND ALSO COOL AND ALSO FUNNY XD :D
Remember toms time mechine why don't you make a train that goes thought time of earth
Insanity. But in a good way. I think.
Waking up in general is a miserable task
Ita just so amazing. How innovative
It's really amazing how much work goes into great videos like this
Did u just prove ur lazy
Bloody brilliant Mate! However, the uncharitable might venture an opinion about how much time you have on your hands!
Ingenious creation
Yeye your back
6:54  L google
Oh cocopops are making me hungry
Thank you so much for the shout-out! This is such a well designed machine, I especially love the smart device section!   And I also love the way you explained, organized, and edited this video! Well done!
now his name makes sense
This was the only/first video of yours I've seen and I'm already subscribing
YOU PUT THE CEREAL IN BEFORE THE MILK
5:19 is funny
I love your lego train video  this video was a real delight and upgraded version of the train and my favourite video was the rc car obstacle course
I was wondering why you have not upload any video recently, and here we are watching you make this amazingly cumbersome video. But, it is GREAT though!
Is just me or I can’t tell what cereal is that
This is awesome man
i dont care if he made a whole lego train breakfast i only care that he ate coco pops this man is my hero
bruh when you the voice mail played it activated my google😂🤣👌👌
So fast
Wow
"it only took 34 tries"😂
Chris are u An Engineer if not u should be
Ha!🤣 He has to reset everything every single day!
i NEVER miss a video
you are cute :O
All this for breakfast 😍
I am also cranky in the morning, so I like that idea and am going to use it, thank you and new subscriber
All these videos just make me want more legos
Its Walace and gromit!
When the milk was poured, I celebrated like England had just won the World Cup.
So did you just eat cat food?🤔
THE COW blinked
Video suggestion: Make a small house with a proper foundation from lego. Make it permanent. Lego only for materials, feel free to use blocks with the flat top, but you don't need to do lego for the foundation
When the radio said hey Siri, my siri actually activated!
This guy helped me through 2020. I still love these videos
This video is so cool
I love the effort and editing,the building,and using scrabble pieces and the train to use words,I even feel like I’m more educated than my PHYSICS TEACHER
He's spitting bars
Why make it like normally so that way you wont building it again
A train that is a breakfast train + a toy train that is a breakfast train I don’t understand 😐😐😐
Idea: because Chris is insane at making small moving vehicles maybe he could make a mini car for his cats.
and not leve
update the song and i want it to say we miss tom and regge and we wish they cold come back and stay
Hi
Nice
I cannot wait to see what he comes up with next 🤩
4:41 wrong & direction
1:49 2sec timer multiplied by 2
Why do coco pops get soggy so quickly? :(
Lego is a science
pov: minecraft skyfactory
Post a new video please with cats
This reminds me of the breakfast train from paddington bear 🐻💗
This must-have took ages
1:08 thought it was the end
The face is revealed!
this is one of the most videos on your channel
It’s like a real life Wallace and Gromit!
The voice to alexa is so bad it’s like 👾
This is so convoluted, yet so ingenious
This is the most Wallace & Gromit thing you've done yet, Chris! XD
Bruh u sound like Tommyinit XD
Wasn't there a Michael J Fox that started just like this? Without Alexa, Siri or Google back then... Just great! Seems like an awful lot of work though! I'd need something even more elaborate to spread jam on toast.
this is what we all dreamed about
I'm very surprised u acually did this sry if I'm late But my main question is how did you get all those Legos and machine legos
This channel was dead
Make  aA train what can deliver you your Lego and build your crazy things that I watch and make a run what
WHER CATS AT SRE DEY OKAY
Man I love him
He issss "Half-Asleep Chris"
Who are you? Wallace and Gromit.
You can FINALLY be Fully-Awake Chris
I would want this in my house

This is FANTASTIC!!!
5:34 Hi rohlf
4:49 HI bella!
welp.. more chores for resetting the breakfast lego
l wish l could do this but like drill holes in the walls and stuff
He's literally HALF ASLEEP chris     Except the machine is not half asleep, It's given 5000000000000000000000000000000000000 coffees a mili-second
I like the lion mask
Telephone? That's an iPhone, dude! Anyway great video btw.
Make more video
.
.
.
Do you eat cat food 🤔
This is amazing
I like hearing you explain everything in excruciating detail :3
Affective
I NEED THIS
Everyone's Dreaaaaaaaaaaaam
I did not know what you said but okay
GIVE IT TO ME GIVE IT TO ME GIVE IT TO ME
Anyway, very cool way to get your breakfast done :)
at 4:47 Bella appears under the train line.
imagine he built all this just to screw with us and he put the milk first
This was amazing!!! Excellent
Reminds me of Coraline a bit 😅
Where is your cat?🤨
So cool.
I kind of want to see Danielle planning a big video sometime, to get back at Chris for all the giant train systems he's run through the house and that one time that he built a giant cardboard castle. (Some of my favorite videos, BTW; this channel is my happy place❤️)
As, I’m late by 5 days :( But I love these lego videos, you are really good at this stuff and me… I kinda suck, i really want to see more lego vids in the future
that was genius!
WOW
... wow
BRING BACK THE PLUSHIES!!!!!
I thought he had a girlfriend to make his breakfast
Awesome Lego train!
I just got the ralph and bella plushie. I am in Austria so it took long to come but it came
Chris, you made something that every child wants. and me for that matter
You are so sweet and wholesome!
Chris, you handsome legend.
mumbo jumbo in real life
I love the second machine
That was amazing!!! So much work, but the result was purrfection!
i feel as if doing it manually is faster than this machine 😭
1:44 and i just realized i cant hear a word your saying
🌟
Love the fact that the machine has a orange color scheme and that the count down matched the beat of the music. You really pay attention to details
I'm from England 😜
this is when you have to much time on your hands
Your editing is so good 😭✨
WAIT, HE DIDN'T DISPENSE A SPOON!!!
I watch all your vids keep it up👍
did anyone else hear him say down to down when he was speaking fast
The only problem is he has to setup everything
This man is a masterpiece.
Your command for google activated my google home!
What happened to coco
You look so joyful when you got your cereal
A creative genius xx
This is unnecessary but genius
This is so cool!! Love your videos chris! Keep up the great work! We love you!!!
Half-Asleep EPIKNESS
By the way, it kinda looks like the Disneyland Railroad train.  The #1 engine, C.K. Holiday.
Oh my gosh!  This is new!  A breakfast train?  I ought try something like this.
Chris is getting closer to being Wallace and Grommet but with cats
😀😀😀😀🥰🥰👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
This guy is slowly turning into Wallace and his cat is turning into gromit
Machine makes me go YES
Train go brr
who is recording at the end?
Omg, you mastered chain reaction?
You deserve all the subs in the world you’ve made my life inspired and so much better I’m speaking from my heart.
the engine is my favorite kind of american engine
You look like the Riddler from the new Batman
You are like a children, but you are in a next level!
My dad got us a Disney train Lego set. It’s amazing!
Yay you finally uploaded
it bin 1mouth i woch yr vid
Same
setting it up again...
Did you get this from Coraline?
This reminds me of Wallace and gromit
I love that you always put lots of effort into these things even though it would have just been easier to get the cereal normally than make this contraption. I thought it was very smart
Reminds me of something from Pee Wee Herman, or Wallace and Gromit.
Chris please make this for me I NEED it I love ur vids great job! :D
I love you making lego stuff. Can you make like a motorized lego star wars vehicle toy for your cats? Thanks!
I’m getting Coraline vibes
Will you keep this up
I like it :)
Cool
Mental break down avoider, your videos are awesome
Let’s all say that Chris is the smartest and has coolest stopmotion
This also will help you wake up cuz of the ballons
This is so cool
love the rube goldberg machine.
I think this is called being lazy
Dear Lord…that girlfriend of yours must be a saint 😂
Chris I’m sorry for calling your cat ugly on the year 2017, may 26th 3:30 pm UST    Please forgive me
Road to 2 mil
“I am not a morning person.” Is that where your YT name comes from? And wait, why does the train start there? Shouldn’t it start where your bed is?
Sure you can be lazy but it’s going to take time to set it up for tomorrow
This is awesome!
shout out to my chitty chitty bang bang kids out there.
I wanna see more of Ralph and Bella
Smart
I found a maga genius
Actually Nature Invented the perfect machine to make a breacfast: YOUR HAND!..
So Chris, how does Danielle, Bella and Mr. Ralph feel about this 😂 I just have a feeling Ralph would mess with it lol
enihcam grebdlog ebur a essentially involves a snoitcaer niahc fo seires
Bloody brilliant!!
Cool but it is 1 use only so u always need to calibrate it
total waste of time, including click into this video
Now that's what I call taking laziness to a whole new level.
It’s like mrbean’s wake up machine
you should make a dishwasher too
At this rate the next video will be: Making A Car For My Cats!
Where did you get instructions and parts for the train?
Why.
The days I search his name he made a video a few days ago. The videos are amazing!
Saw something like this in an ad about instant ramen
Ophhh
Hey if this man is half asleep I can’t imagine him fully awake.
Looks like the contraption from the movie chitti chitti bang bang
Good im gonna make this it looks like i have everything i need!
hahaha why is alexa talking to alexa talking to alexa
Pls make a video about your silly cats’ breakfast train
irl Wallace and gromit
wow the music sounds good
I like how all the ai talks to each other
The only bad thing about this would be having to reset it every night
Chris must've worked really hard on this, and I love that he works hard for us to be entertained.
Chris is the cat version of Wallace from Wallace and Gromit.
most complicated script lol Kinda nice for a cat and you? 🐱 🐈 4:48 "Floyd what u doing here? "Good night sleep even though chris is half asleep"
So proud of how far hes gone scince Regie Now he can do magic
Stupendium level flow on the rap
You have to reset the contraption every time you use it
Its works but are you gonna have to refill and fix all that
i got a lego ad on this video,cool
Hi

2:18 are you really sure, you don’t want to make your breakfast yourself 😅 this seems like a lot more work and a lot of space…
nice video
what I love about this awesome dude is that he shows us his ridiculous cats and diy stuff
🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🐈🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Yeah, cool but who is controlling the train
Imagine walking around the house, it'll be so awkward with the lego train tracks everywhere.
This guy is absolutely AMAZING!
1:50         Me still dont understand anything    Yes im dumb
U
You
6:45 I saw the homepage was only bella. Where’s Ralph
Wow this was so cool!
Genius is back!
Someday I'm gonna make a life-sized Breakfast Express and fill it with panccakes and orange juice aswell as a few passenger carrages so people can come and eat. It will be awesome and I'll put ur name under the branding. :D
Wow!
I want to know and how he is so talented like it’s unbelievable🤪🤪🤪
Expectation : wow im gonna have way less work! Reality : build stuff , put oranges  , getting new batteries , cleaning the tube , putting the balls back , putting domino's back
pls make more videos with ralph and bella
The train is a Harry Potter reference
Wouldn’t you be annoyed to have to set all that up every day
When the device’s were talking my Alexa did too😂
FINALLY Half Asleep Chris is back after his hiatus.
Nghe Phúc hát mà nước mắt rơi mãi ....quá nhiều cảm xúc ùa về, quá nhiều kỉ niệm. Cảm ơn Đức Phúc thật nhiều, giọng hát anh ấm tựa nắng mùa Thu vậy.
Irl wallace and gromit
Here before this blows up.
Great contraption! What is the music in the background please? Our whole family says it’s familiar but we can’t even get Shazam to figure it out 😂
He just puts so much effort into these videos, it is a crime he doesn’t get more support!
You are the most talented guy I have ever discovered! ✨
Your my fav youtuber
This guy is like a mark rober but simple
This video was like Joseph's machines and spice machines
You sound like a british
I can imagine a movie about this guy, where he is the evil villain with a bunch of Lego robots who are like his evil minions who capture people so he can force people to play Lego with him, oh y’a he also looks menacing while eating breakfast
Don’t you have to reset every day
Was watching and you actually set off my google home  Like well earned sir
thinking like a true factory man
2:20 BRO BREAAAATH BREATH OR YOU DIE
This is awesome!
The thing to think About is, did he actually use this or was it just for the video?
My favorite is the devices talking to eachother
Hey! I have news about your store… There’s something wrong with your merch store! Please have fixed if can. If not remind us until it gets fixed. Also how’s Ralph doing? Hopefully he has a good bowl of cat food! Hopefully he’s well! Tell Ralph Tom Reggie Bella I said hi! See you in your next video! 🇬🇧🐠🐱❤️💜❤️🖤💛🤍💚🤎💙❤️💜 For Half-Asleep-Chris Ralph Tom Reggie Bella.
My dad trying to make breakfast:
All of this hard work for cereal and orange milk kinda sad
Chris turned into a Khajiit 😂
Yaaaay
Make a Tom and Reggie plush PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
Welcome to the metaverse

You really love those Lego trains
I need instructions for this!!
As a gamer, this machine will be very useful for me lol
Damn you lucky… you got milk 😭
This guy has so many creation’s that he’s going to need a mansion.🐯
I never thought something could be so unpractical but so cool at the same time. The train and roller coaster videos are so cool 😎
Jellyfish - split milk! yeah!

6:24
Finally he posted and it was amazing
I got an LEGO ad lmao
I love lego but your taking this to far!
are u keeping this though?
You are very Creative
You've done it! You became Wallace and Gromit!
Holy crap Chris, I literally remember something like this discreetly from a video I watched at childhood. Did you go into my brain and make this video just to give me the nostalgia?
Your cats are so cute and sorry for your cats Losses
nice video keep up with the good work!
Sometime...you need to be menace to society just for easy life...
Are you going to keep the set up for as long as you live in this house? Or are you going to take it down.
I am not sure but is it not the easyer way too put my tee by my selfe intoo a cup? I ask for a friend😳
Ok rube goldberg machine
your voice on the fast talking sounded like you were having trouble talking fast
I WISH I HAD LEGO TRAIN
wow.
I think you might wanna change your wallpaper to both bella and Ralph!
brilliant!!
That is cool and stupid
I love all ur videos I started watching when u made ur first Lego video!
I've got an idea that's way quicker Look down in replies  (  ) \/
I will buy this from you for 10k
I wish I could do that :c
What about for your cats :)
Can you do a video on the Pakistan rupee thanks 😀
Is it me or the cow its eye are blink
That’s really cool
Smartest invention ever
my face lit up with joy when I saw this video on my recommended
plz make more video there are just fernomanal
Fun fact: Rube Goldberg name is in the dictionary and he was also a famous cartoonist!
wow your AMZING😯😯😯
This train reminds me of the food train in Caroline when she’s eating with her other mother and other father
I love you have asleep Chris and your videos and  Ralphie and Bella
I also love your cats 🐈 🐈‍⬛🐱
Half asleep Chris,  in your video I built a Lego train breakfast machine, how can  or did you have cold orange juice.  😳💀😳
4:07 i thought that was something else lol
Do you just have this sitting around your house?
Yum.
I wish I could do the stuff he did
Imagine if someone called Chris and they heard that voicemail
I like how it looks straight out of a cartoon
him: tired of making breakfast  also him: makes a disposable machine that you have to reload everytime you want breakfast
But I say it’s a very cool design machine
Um may I ask why would you need this only to need to rest it every time you use it
This dude struggles so hard just to entertain us I consider subscribing
.
it was so cringy
It’s all fun in games til the train derails..
The most wholesome channel on youtube
Bruh
This was so cool and so imaginative God bless you Chris
it hurts to think about setting it up over agin
cool that you’re uploaded train video i like trains
Don’t you brush your teeth before you eat
the hair really screams "Half asleep chris"
4:48 Bella: yeah yeah yeah whatever.
“The lion sleeps tonight”
Chris, just wanted to let you know that I have been watching since you built the Golden Gate Bridge for your cat. I also sent you a letter which I still have. You are truly amazing.
I remember watching chitty chitty bang bang (they had a breakfast machine like this) and I always wanted one irl
I always cant keep of with the creative fun and hard work put into these videos 😭         1:50 when the teacher explains a simple explanation 💀✨
Lego god
Why does Bella wear a donut?
Bella is so cute!!! I enjoy watching all your vids! 😁
Can we just respect the fact that he spent hours/days of work just to make an 8 minute video of a breakfast train.
its like paddington
awesome
Imagine how hard that  will be to clean up lol 🤨
New sub :)
Heessss back!
I have wanted to build a Rube Goldberg since 6th Great engineering class, never got to make a fully operational one until the eighth grade, and even then it wasn’t great. So cool to see a very well thought out and executed Rube Goldberg machine!
You know it's really smart but it's really really inefficient..
Make it automatically reset
feels like mouse trap
Are the Ralph and Bella plushies go reship at June?
love you half-asleep chris
Fully Awake Chris
I forgot about this guy but I remember him
I've always known these kind of machines as Heath Robinson machines.  But no matter what they're called they're brilliant!
The Half-Asleep Mastermind Chris has returned
Would like to introduce Chris to the wonderful art of Heath Robinson.
admit it, you’re a railfan in your spare time
Dude that like one of those electronic said Google it did my Google 2

Legend! Never gives up.
Thats so cool
What tea do you drink?
0:50 RULE BRITTANIA BRITTANIA RULES THE WAVES🇬🇧☕👑🌊
milk before cereal changed my mind
This is just AMAZING 🤩
this should be in Wallace and Gromit but it explodes
“not a morning person” builds a contraption that he must reset every day but good job still
2:18 well i think its easyer to make serial than remake this
HAC you have the same Lego alarm clock i have!
Love the background Music tbh
I am a royal marine cadet
They’re really good your videos🐈🐈‍⬛🐈‍⬛🐈😊
Can you make a new video I like them!
This guy is a genius with engineering and legos. :)
Your videos make me so happy when I’m sad and your so good at doing the things you do
woah this is so cool 👏🏼👏🏿👏🏻👏🏽👏🏾
this is amazing the invention actually works im impresss
You're you're that lazy huh And productive at the same time?
I can't believe how much dedication and effort he puts in his videos. I truly respect his work
Love that tea sequence at the start
Cool
Omg I'm so glad your back online!!!!!
waste of time and also why you name is half as sleep
Who else's Google home also went off? 😆😆  Great video Chris, love your work! 🌟
I have watched every single video of yours and I still think you're the best youtuber ever!!!
Gentle Giant

How's Ralph and bella
You should make a museum for these inventions they are totally amazing 🤩
I love your videos hehehehe
Man it a long time i look your vid also im a big fan bcaz cats and more keep it up!
Really made my day
I got Lego ad on this video
I love that I’m subscribed to you because every once in a while I get to see a fun and creative video. Keep up the good work man.
Now you really are half-asleep Chris
My favorite line here is "but ket of wo ur"   Edit:im bad at jokes
The smart devices talking to each other was genius. Your videos are always so wholesome and calming
Just glad he did the cereal first not the milk 😂
This is pure Wallace and gromit stuff right here
wow i would like you to do a shout in your next video for my child her name is kitty
Wow, these inventions are very creative
its so cool to see you have the saturn v to
this video is very good
A -Kid Friendly- Violence Free version of colinfurze
Cheese, Gromit
now that is a real cretive
This channel is now about LEGO
I'm mostly a morning person I prefer waking at 6am cst
I’ve been enjoying all the creative and different ways off using Lego keep up the great work 👍 😌
I almost thought that this was Joseph’s machines😂
I feel like the train would "break fast"
He has more smartness then Albert Einstein
The fact that ur name is HALF-ASLEEP chris tho 😂
The Cat Maze Video: My sincere apoligies to Danielle who really wanted the living room back Danielle after that video: Phew Half Asleep Chris: Actually, I change my mind, Im going to make a breakfeast train express with 3 machines going around the entire house, which then after failing 573 times, and Danielle having to clean it up, it finally worked in 2 weeks for a video of 8 minutes and 20 seconds. Wait a second... How am i gonna remove this monstrousity from the house???! Danielle: 😅  PS Thx for the great content  PS 2 I dunno
How on Machine 3 it got made out milk?
I don't even care if you haven't uploaded for a long time This.Is.EPIC! Just watching the video, I think of how painstakingly long it would have taken to make this one eight minute video. I love how you spend your time making quality videos every once in a while, not just low quality ones a few days apart. You are always posting the best videos, and you make my day better every time I watch a video.        (Also, it's nice to have a fellow brit running a large high quality YouTube channel with cats included)
your not yourself when your hungry i guess...
I'm watching at 3am. I can't sleep
I always wanted that train set since it released of course I'd have to modify it but it wold be cool
Maybe next time it would be easier making breakfast
You are a genius. How are you not a mega billionaire like Elon Musk?
I’ve done a rube gold machine as my science project
What isoniazid your face? No effence.
What’s the lion  mask on  you head
i love this channel
lol love it the amount of effort put into this
The way I do it is I put the milk THEN the cereal cause imma menace. Then I put orange juice in the milk to use less dishes. Then I eat my Cheerios with a fork to save milk, drink the milk through a straw and feed the straw to the turtles.
SCIENCE!
Need another parallel machine to help brush your teeth before cereal arrives
2022
Hey Chris how do you do the text scenes with the scrabble tiles and paper letters? Is it stop motion or done digitally?
Chris your videos are always amazing to watch. except I don't know if Danelle is okay having that around forever since it's time consuming to reset it every morning. great job.
bump
Why you have a lion head
This is lazy in it finest I guess (love your video if you see this )
You imagine someone calls him in the middle of him doing this so they accidentally activate the thing too early Because he doesn't answer
I love trains
i mean you deffinetly coulda made a zipline of sorts or something but you did train and i like trains. also im  part scottish
Finally! No 🐈
not half asleep,but half lion.
I got no idea what your saying right now
THIS IS AWSOME DUDE!!! I could never make something THAT good. :)
This is so unnecessary I need it😂😂😂  Also can we appreciate the effort he puts in his videos
i would buy that if was a thing-
There was Bella walking too!
i also like ur ideas
AND you posted a video on EASTER?!?! WOW
I like it though i have not watched it YET but i am watching it NOW!:D
Problem, Fridge
This reminds me a lot of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
You know you’re fast at commenting if the legendary Half Chris comments
No cheese?
I would love to have a train to give me my food
this reminds me of that scene from Paddington 2 when Mr Gruber's antique train makes tea for them. Awesome job!
He should have google and amazon sponsor him
Amazing video! Bravo!
Ha Ha! The trilogy continues.... THE LEGO TRAIN TRILOGY
afk breakfast machine
Chris's life has to be sponsored by lego at this point
I miss the cats also are they OK?
Can you imagine this guy being your grandpa? I'd want to live here for sure
YAY A New video 😃😁😊🤩
6:25 thats a good device talk
HOW DO I DOUBLE SUBSCRIBE
1:51 EPIK RAP
I love love LOVE how much work Chris puts into his videos. Poor Danielle must only be able to use the sitting room for like 2 week intervals at a time 😂😂
I think you should get the Doctor Who LEGO Idea's Set. EDIT: also maybe do a video talking about Doctor Who I'm not stereotyping you by the way Just suggesting it because you do seem like you'd watch it.
What breed is Bella?
This was fantastic!!!! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, great work :)
You’re insane.
Watch the chitty chitty bang bang film it has a breakfast train
I love this channel
So that’s what you’ve been working on for the past four months
i have 3d classes irl
The breakfast express, the brexpress! 😂
Is there anyway (if it isn't going to be a hassle) to post shorts of kitty updates for ralph and bella? I miss seeing them sometimes while you're working hard for the videos.
This is amazing! 34 tries is really good, I would've expected way more
I swear he is Mark Rober but with legos
And it only took 34 tries for me that would be alot quicker at making bekfast cuz i wake up think about making bekfast sumtimes go downstairs and see if we got cereal anthen just lie in my bed for ages before then waching my phone anthen i might make some bekfast
I dint care how old i am, i will never be too old to watch his videos
I was starting to think you were actually Wallace (From Wallace and Gromit).... suspicions now confirmed
What’s next, a Lego time machine?
I like trains.
WoW
It was a really good idea to build a breakfast train. But how are you going to refill the cereal and the milk and the orange juice and stuff also enjoy your tea
This is marvelous beyond words!!!
But what happens when you want to do it daily
Btw u should have named it the Brexpress (breakfast express) lol
The train knocks this orange out the way and then comes to a stop at this wooden crate blocking the track. As the orange falls it hits this fidget spinner device, toppling these dominoes, rolling this ball down the track to make this weight fall, pulling down the trigger of…This remote control car, hitting this basketball down this drainpipe, sinking this cup, raising this cup, knocking this marble down a downward spiral of doom and despair, sending this ping-pong ball into this Hotwheels car with scissor glued on the roof, cutting this string, releasing this shoe, kicking this container, catching on these magnets, and sending orange juice down the tube and into the glass. Meanwhile this tiny hand hits another Hotwheels car with a sharpened pencil glued on top, popping this balloon with marbles inside, sending them through this upturned cone, spinning in this dish, wibbly-wobbling down this track and into this cup, weighing down this pulley and pulling forward this bin lorry, to unblock these lentils, which slowly fill up this crate, connected on yet another pulley system with the crate that's blocking the train, and connected on yet another pulley system with the crate that's blocking the train, and as it fills up, voilà, the train continues its journey.
Chris can u create a cat mansion for Ralph and Bella
Danny elfman has a song called "Breakfast Machine" featured in (I think) Pee-wee's big adventure
Watch the beginning of Pee Weeks big Adventure.
Wallace and Gromit would be proud! ♡
you were that lazy to build a machine that makes your breakfast for you
This guy makes my day every time he uploads, he is so inspirational.
and then set it all up again for the next day :p
What about the work of resetting it?
Somebody’s been watching too much Wallace and gromit
Okay but imagine having to set this whole thing up every single evening
1:05 the rod is not miving
fun video i whoud like something at home like that
who see the cow blike
Happy Easter Half Asleep Chris!
him: *makes a super complex machine that is hard to reload* me if i was making this: the train knocks over a ball that knocks over the milk and wheights a pulley to  put the milk bottle back up.
But now you have to reset the whole machine every single day. Including keeping it fed with a constant supply of balloons.
I remember the time you only had 2k
What person are you morning evening or night
That’s kind lazy when you do that😐😐
Are you really willing to set that contraption up before bed every night?
You deserve more subscribers than you have
5he part with Alexander is sick
This was so cool. The blooper was a nice addition
He used it from the polar express
Great video! I love your inventions!
I wonder what your girlfriend thinks everytime you set up ambitious projects like this!
I'm surprised how he does all this
you are basically real life wallace from wallace and gromit just with a cat
WOW YOUR SMART
where do you get your music?
wow. the hard work and dedication that went into this. well done!
Yooooo
Siri came on when you said hey siri
Absolutely superb
Also I love the way you made those words
He makes the best videos i’m a rail fan and I love trains so for me this is great
this is sooooooooooooo cool😊
this is so funny and amazing! love the lion hat XD
yay❤ new vid
Cool
Oh .. MY .. GOD, Chris!! ❤✨✨
You should collaborate with Liam Thompson!
what about brushing you're teeth?
8:06 bro lookin like Riddler from The Batman
Fantastic!
Funny 😄
how does the train start, at the beginning?
great for a lazy person like me
That is so cool, creating a train machine. I like trains.
Chris I have an idea for what to do with Lego Ralph you should try getting him entered as an attraction for Legoland so you don't keep getting confused
i just cant imagine how painful it is to remove all of this
This is awesome but I want more Bella and rapph
I love it
Someone needs to send him a copy of Back To The Future 1. He needs to learn how to automate breakfast from THE DOC himself! master of time travel, clocks and breakfast! :)
it is my dream at some point to have mr grubers tea train :)
I want to try it out too
I think this is the most Half Asleep Chris video I've seen.
This is the best wholesome youtube channel ever!
The start made me laugh like literally i just laughed while my mother is near me lol
the music gets me ptsd from places i’ve gone to
I guess I found the Wallace of lego.
Mmmmmmm
He’s not half asleep he’s full asleep LOL
ME starts watching his vids again realising how much i have missed out
Holy money this has been amazing to watch - until you said  ‘hey Siri’ and  my Siri reacted and my video stopped! Great entertainment as always
SOOOOOO CLEVER!!😎😍😍😍
YOUR AMAZING!!
3 LEGO TRAIN NOW THATS AWSOME
Chris is really smart and creative. I find it really cool that he made 3 machines do crazy stuff actually work. I also like that be used Legos.
Wow! This is some dedication
do you use this every day
the quality of this vid is through the roof!
To solve this problem you can get married 😂 (Don't take the joke serious)
So breakfast but make it Chitty Chitty Bang Bang style :D
I love your Videos and your calm Personality so much!
6:53 turn on FEED ME CEREAL
So, cool man! And well crafted!
This is Wallace and Gromit level stuff this is.
the funny part was the part when you woke up as an agressive lion
thanks, I have been professionally diagnosed with ADHD 1:50
Finaly  *new video*
ITS AMASING and so cool i love your videos
I’m learning Rube Goldberg machine’s in school and building it to (it was so hard)
Really enjoying the Ralph & Bella plushies! There very cute, thanks Chris!
watching this vid i think chris is spencer shay
I wish I could build this to because it looks amazing
LOL i love this :)
Where’s Ralf your cat is he dead or. Not and where is Bella your cat is she dead or. Not
I love how it, works and i love lego so much,
I love it when he says "and it only took 34 tries."
This man is obsessed with lego trains
It's like a real life Wallace and Gromit thing!!!!
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooòoooooooooooooooooo ooooooohooooooooooo
The real pain, spending each day just resetting the machine.
This is lit.
There’s something about these videos compared to other videos so just give me a calming feeling I love these videos and relaxing and the fact that you worked so hard to entertain us thank you for being one of the best Youtubers in the world better than MrBeast
Finally😰🥴, he made another video!
500,000 times? 😬
I actually use that alarm, and when it started playing I got PTSD
This reminds me of Wallace’s inventions. (Wallace and Gromit)
You probably have the most wholesome channel on the internet. Keep up the good work!
Very nice video! Keep up the great work.
WOW! You have a LOT of free time!
wouldnt it be easier to just pour the milk into bowl then orange juice into the glass then add cereal? well hes half asleep chris
Chris this would be funny if it were Thomas the tank pulling the train lol
Probably took 5 days to make. At that point just get up and do it yourself in 2 minutes. The bad thing about this is that you will have to reset it everyday. But you did a really good job on it. You have very good patuwi
Chris your videos are awesome! :)
Can you show all of your failed tries so we can laugh because it would be fun
but wait. it is 5 times as painful to setup the machine every morning than to just make breakfast yourself. no duh.
4:47 i like how bella just casually walks ignoring the chaos you built, heh, funny bella! <:
This reminds me of peewee Herman’s house
Did anyone see the cow blink
So creative
4:39 the cow blinked
Finally you pause post a video is been so long never pause a video i'm concern you never pass a video
Your team cereal first?
The amount of time it's been since the last time I've watch this channel is a very long amount
How lazy are you? This guy:
One question if he’s asleep then who’s filming?
I like the second machine because it’s looks like the Among Us meeting each other phone and each other mechanics talking Each other
Steve Price Machine's
what the Ludovic Hell
Everybody gangsta until the train pours the milk before the cereal
Do you like legos?
Is it for sale?
thats insane!
You really like trains huh
whoa
absolutely worth subscribing!
Guys I think Chris is slowly turning to a main character like in those cartoon shows
To Half Asleep Chris can you make more videos with Dinosaurs or other Extinct Animals.
I thought on the thumbnail  the food and Orange juice came from the same thing but the food would get wet then.
Who recorded if Chris was sleep?
Did you really use spilt milk to clean up spilt milk? Lol
22 on trending
makes a lot of sense of why you haven't uploaded yet
Reminds me of that one movie called sing
New Subscriber 🍿
My man has made big bucks off of Lego and I respect this man’s hustle.
This is what I watch while I am supposed to make breakfast
I wish I had it :(
Aaaaaaah finally I can see the cats :) (Edit) oh wait no cats :(
Well done damn good effort both of you, and well done for keeping inquisitive moggies out of it.
Soncool
Soo can do this or just get up and make a cereal and pour some orange juice
alexa turn on FEED ME CEREAL
I want this
Wait will u still use it or what
This is one of the best things Chris made with his Lego train and the tracks
You make the BEST VIDEOS👍🏾👍🏾😁😍
just get a wife or a girlfriend it is hard to get but its easy
That whole phone and Alexa machine was amazingly built
this looks like a wallace and gromit wake up machine Congrats
I’m finding it funny that my Siri responded to the speaker.
Bro one of the first things I thought of when I saw this was Wallace and Gromit
He puts the cereal first. What a legend
anyone know what the name of the song playing during the machine is? thanks
next up, use Lego Mindstorms to make it much more useful
I guess he won’t be half asleep anymore
he needs some breakfast
Im Curious what is the song during the train part?
All fun and games till u have to clean it up
While we Americans appreciate your call-out of Rube Goldberg, but what about Britain's own Heath Robinson?
My god Chris... You're becoming Doc Brown!! You've even got the crazy hair to prove it
You. can see Rolph 1:34
He has a lego globe and i took a break from building it to watch this video 😂
This video is amazing Half-asleep Chris I am watching at my house
How much money for it
It would be even more amazing if you used the actual lego robotics sets to make the train (Lego mindstorms, spike prime, boost, and others)
Half asleep cat
it takes a ton of imagination to build some rube-goldberg machines.
I'm not the only person with Google Siri and Alexa 😅
WALLACE AND GROMIT AAAAAAAAH
Ironically I found machine 2 the most entertaining and genius to watch as complex as the first one was.
I LOVE RUBE GOLDBERG MACHINES  their just so cool and funny amazing video Chris!!!
Breakfast in 5am
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN??????
This was amazing, this man is an engineering genius
Who else had to turn down the playback speed during Rube Goldberg machine part 😂
Mama
I can’t believe I understood his entire contraption and explanation :D
I feel like every video you make manages to best the last video, even though I feel like the videos cant possibly get any better
Chris you make the future and my day
I think you should do a Halloween train out of Lego like the Christmas one
Props to Chris to making his breakfast automatic.
I think it would be easier just to have a box of cereal, orange juice and milk by your bed...
okay but like no offense but i can just make cereal in like 30 seconds, and also a drink in like 15-30 and do it in 1 try. its a really good contraption but its not really needed unless its efficient. once again, no offense.
Have a nice breakfast Chris! Best video ever 🤩
It's always a good day when you upload a video! (and it's even better when you start it with an automatic breakfast machine 😸)
u need to start uploading more
After 2 months... oof
how many iphons do you have. becauether was at lest 2!.
am i the only one who just zoned out with his explanation
I think you should make something out of gravitrax. It's very fun and simple.
This is utterly spectacular!!! Amazing, such work and a feat of endurance! We loved it! Xxx
It's alright  for you  good job
What about the express-o
You are the best 🙂😁😀😃🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
if you go to illinois, there is a place called junction diner, and they have mini trains that serve food. it's awesome!
Bro the speaker went off and it trend on my Siri lol
Truly Amazing🎉
Hi Chris I sincerely need advise like how do you know when a cat likes you?
Imagaine having to reset all.of this
Wow I really liked what you made
Hi
happy ester
The cow blinks!!
you triggered my Google nest! 😆😆
Fu e hundred thousand wth that’s crzy
This is going to be lost in the comments and someone must have already said this, but.  Spilt Milk was one of my favourite albums that I haven't listened to in twenty years.  Thanks for the reminder Chris.
I love this video! 😍
Can I buy this
The Amount Of Time You Put Into These Videos, You Are So Good And Really  Care About Your Viewers, Keep Up The Good Work
I really like Joseph's machines an Sprice Machines too
LOVE IT! Hate mornings but love the video
The breakfast express, like it! (Jots down notes)
Did you get any inspiration from Peewee's Breakfast Machine?
Awesome i subscribed!
I love  your videos
Ive wanted to do this my entire life and now I want to do it more except when I realized the percentage of this working to failing is 2.9412 chance of working
I’m in my school STEM competition and we’re supposed to make a Rube Goldberg Machine that tells a story that has a flag rise at the end, and this video is giving me ideas :) Thanks Chris!
Chris should make a Lego train jump on a loop non stop and it only moves itself not batteries or any source of power but if he manages that would be cool
happy easter
This is genius but how did the train start moving don’t you have to manually start the train
i love it.. bring it to me and I will give you a cat! lol
I like how british people say brekfust and american people say break fast like a break at work and fast like wow that kid is fast
1:44: WTF? Oh yeah, it's Chris.  Reminds me of the dinner scene in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, except Chris puts Caractacus Potts to shame.
There just something so great about this channel that makes it my favourite, anyone else?
That’s pretty good
Could have been much simpler and easier, but that’s no fun.
Man , you had put work on that video . Love you bro
Right now when I’m watching this. It says 10 hours ago and it’s 10 AM lol. (not perrrrr-fectly 10 though) 😂🤣
I love your content!
How are you used to use it again
How are you going to se it again
First
At first I thought this was from Spice Machines... But now Chris is doing these machines too!? Wow!!!
4:49 B.E.L.L.A
Don’t you mean brickfast
“I am not a morning person” so relatable 😌
This is a Wallace and Gronmit type of thing 😂
Chris is not Chris without: 1. Legos 2.  His cats (Rest In Piece Reggie & Tom...) 3. His  brain of doing stuff like this
The amount of work you did 🤯😱🤯😱🤯😱    Amazing 😻 here is the like and it’s going on Twitter
That is an amazing idea!!!
This is reminding me of Wallace and Grommit! 😆👏
Chris although you upload rarely , you literally make one of the best videos
Siri this is what the world needs it needs invention that brings you breakfast and also makes you breakfast
See that’s what the future needs it needs invention that brings breakfast to the table and make it
Bravo Chris! Stay up late engineering something to get you out of bed in the morning?  Breakfast automatically served! I never thought about OJ being more yellow than orange. At least the fruit itself, is orange. But why are red cabbage and red onions dark purple?   Cool footage w/the little camera mounted on the train as went down the tracks.🚊 I think I saw Bella making a cameo appearance 😺😺
hours spent to automate a task that takes minutes. dedication
amazing🤩
Trains
Basically mr bean episode
0:10 - that combover is legendary..
Didn't the thumbnail say "Breakfast Express" yesterday?
You might be Nikola tesla's mum because she always made labor saving devices all the time
why is chris a furry hahaahahahahhaha
The Danish way to get breakfast
It’s amazing, love it but you’re gonna be way less of a night person now
It be easier to just make it yourself
The part with the devices actually got me! 😂 Truly amazing!
This man made the IRL chitty chitty bang bang breakfast machine
This is the first non cat video I’ve watched from you
I can't speak for everyone but nothing about your videos or the way you present the amazing things that go on in your mind could be remotely considered "boring" Love the new video, I need my own version of this!
Im totally a morning person, my daily routine for the mornings is: game at 6:30 and stop at 8:05 when i go to school, my mom handles the rest. And its not like im in a bad mood in the morning either, im usually the most full of energy in mornings
Im always in pain when someone says “ping pong” instead of what it is, “tabletennis” it just sounds so weird to me after all this time of tabletennis lessons
Ok so im hyped for something totally else then this cus its an event upd from my fav game so anyways its gonna be in around 30 min so ima watch this to spend more time, and im also always hyped for ur vids so, DOUBLE HYPED
hehe imagen this being like a real toy or something
Imagine being reluctant to create breakfast but not making this      Btw good video
Next video : my electric bills are not payed so I'm gonna build a nuclear reactor out of Lego and fix it
I saw Bella
@Colin Furze eat your heart out
Please upload more i love your videos
your videos dont come out often, but when they do come out, i enjoy each one.
Good work Chris and hello to Bella and Ralph (Reggie and Tom too ♥️)
Oh god,  this was so much fun🤩. And it only took 34 tries, yay!
Please do more of these lego videos cause I love them.
Joseph is the best his really smart
this time you were really half asleep, Chriss
yes
Woah he is a rapper
This is the best thing ever I ever seen!!!!!
This is a good idea but dont you have to set it back up
Can we all just appreciate that he put milk after cereal
I woke at 5am
What happens when you run out of string 😮
My favorite part is Machine 2.
This reminds me of the beginning of back to the future.
This is giving me major Wallace and Gromit vibes.
Good
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, breakfast scene.
This is one of the most Wallace and Gromit things i have ever seen. In a very good way
Chris has a girlfriend with the patience of a saint.
All are Not a Morning Person, so how expensive? I Need it
Excellent job, Chris and Danielle. That was very impressively done and entertaining to watch.
I am utterly awed by the skills and ingenuity on display here! Wow! Teasmade's got nothing on this! XD
How about  dinner  connecr
Been waiting for this for so long love these videos
How are you going to 🧽
this reminds of "lockdown for introverts"
I love the cameo from Bella and her donut. She like were my breakfast machine.
I have limited  lego trains  now lol
I think ima just stay to pouring the cereal the normal way but AMAZING VIDEO!
This is like Colin Furz’s creation
Joseph's Machines will be proud at you
If you can do this with Lego system, what happens when Technic and Mindstorms join the party?
cool
Coco Pops are the best!
I wish I had one of these contraptions!
Get in a new video
That's amazing!!!!as always
I feel I must mention W. Heath Robinson...
FINLY A NOTHER LEGO THEM I water way to long buutt... Do I fear nop now what's was I wating for meh ok now bye?
Google: Alexa, *FEED ME CEREAL* Alexa: ok
Wallace from Wallace and Gromit would be proud.
idk why this stuff reminds me of poly bridge so much. very cool rube goldburg machine my dude. love how you managed to make this not gross (the william osman 'gravy train' video is extremely gross.)
E
It looks more tedious setting up the dominoes than just making breakfast
Your the best YouTuber I know, thanks for being awesome!!
Chris your amazing
Or... you can have someone to make breakfast for you :p Anyway, I LOVE IT !
THIS IS INSANE!
Love these vids :) im a big fan
I have the same alarm clock with wheels!
This was so awesome! Love the innovation through the modern section especially! Super cute stuff 👏😊
How many takes did this take?
this deserves more views!
Why wan you go to sleep you where a loin mask
Keep up the great work Chris!! 👍
Finally another video
I love this vid I wish I had this in my house 🤣
I have the same rocket Lego
This video was truly spectacular!!!
Pls reply Cris ur awesome
this is just like joseph machines but with lego
IS THAT COCO POPS 0:07
Your getting good mileage out of the lego tracks!
i saw bella before you went to sleep lol
This reminds me of wallace and grommit! Lol
Wow, amazing! This thing is something I’d definitely buy if it was on a store shelf
As a not-morning person, I can confirm this machine would make getting up much better! Every upload of Chris always gets better and better, I can’t wait to see what he has next! :D
if I had a nickel for every time an English man with an animal friend who makes a machine that makes breakfast with little to no effort, id have two nickels which isn't a lot, but its weird that it happened twice
Who's recording
This is literally Wallace from Wallace and gromit  "I give you, the auto-breakfast-o-matic!
dude frikin is the best lego engineer ever i mean if yall not subbed to him what are you doin
Man you've been busy
MAKING A GLOBE OF LEGO IS GREAT
I love ur videos but can u post more often?
WOW! Just big, big WOW!🤩
i LOVE rube goldberg machines this was so fun!!!!!
Chris, your addiction to Lego is getting out of hand.
Awesome - your most clever video ever! Great job!
This is so cool new subscriber
i was like oh its just a train    me at 1:49 Never mind…..
I better use an ev3
Another great video from Half-Asleep Chris:)
Hi, Chris. 'm always amazed by your creativity and ability to build cool things. That's why I like your videos so much! But to be honest, the best part was at 4:49 when I spotted Bella walking graceful into the kitchen. And at the end, my boyfried an I had a good laugh. Maybe you can guess why. ;) Keep up the good work!
Fully appreciating the stop motion, as always! Amazing efforts!!
What is taking so long
My guy speaks faster than Eminem at explaining the machine. 👏👏👏👏👏
I don’t even know how you would build that massive contraption
Cool
I live on the Scottish border
I love his videos
My only question is simple:  Why is it so uneedlessly over engineered, not saying its bad but it's a bit too much for the job.
Pee-Wee would be proud. 🥞🥓
He is orange juice gang and also milk gang XD (It's a youtuber named "Dani" that has a reddit that has milk gang and orange juice gang memes)
Video for Ukrainian war!
Wonderful ✨🌈 absolutely wonderful. This kinda reminds me of  the same concept when Mr Bean made an alarm clock⏰to get out of bed.
Chris get a haircut
This is probably rip of vid from josephs machine
wow cool 🎉
Chris this is amazing man
Haha
I don’t know if you’re an engineer because you’re so good I promise you I’m not being sarcastic
Plz make some more coin videos. You got me into collecting and they were some of my favourite videos you you've made
I think you also magician
Half asleep Chris I don’t know if you’re an engineer because you’re so good
Did anyone see bella?
Nice job Chris enjoy your new breakfast train
As amazing as this is you would have to put all the stuff back where it was or else it won't work it's only one time use unless you reset the machine
The effort Chis puts into his videos are amazing
Not watched it all yet, but it definitely has a Wallace and Gromit vibe to it! YOU could be the new Wallace and Bella or Ralph, the new Gromit lol! Watched it now and all I can say is "absolutely brilliant!" Even my hubby was fascinated and came to watch the proceedings! I shared it to my Facebook page and hopefully you will get some more subscribers!
Congrats on your first ever Rube-Goldberg machine and it worked!
New half asleep Chris vid let’s gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
This is cool on a Wallice and Grommit level
Youtube is made for contents like this. Not some kiddos gaming n screaming at your face. By the way you shouldn't consume both milk and orange juice at the same time, it's harmful man! And excellent vid
'I'm not a morning person's related to
4:55 full asleep chris
YAY! a video! ☻
This was impressive. Both the work setting it all up, and the many tries to get to work as it should.
I love u chris
Really, really, really reminds of some wallace and gromit wizardry!
I know that one video he will build an entire robot to pet his cats
his voice is amazing
How do you pay for all this?! It’s so cool!
I love your videos they are so Cool and clever and I love Lego as Much as you hope you have a good easter
The locomotive is a 3-foot narrow gauge 4-4-0 locomotive
ooooo cool the lego globe! I kind want that one!  also amazing video again❤️ Just the thing I need to cheer me up in the morning
I have google
Incredible! 👍
Wow! Its good to see a YouTuber value Quality over Quantity. It really shows in your videos you put a lot of effort in this and other videos. Genius. I'll that trial and error really paid of in this presentation.
When do you sleep?…..
I love the part when Bella was walking around and machine 1
8:19
I like how he’s basically turning into a Lego channel
Ooh
I love the aesthetics of your channel. This was so cool.
You’re becoming more and more like Wallace every day you just need to start calling ralph Chuck and lad
This man has too be a custom Lego builder YouTuber now. I love these projects and I love how educational and creative Chris is.
Finally a video
When half asleep Chris uploads you know you have reached peak yay
How come you/half-asleep Chris stopped uploading for a while
This video is just Wallace and Gromit
Cool! This is awesome! I finally got both my Bella and Ralph plushes in a few weeks ago
I just love your channels
He is the Collin Furze of household items
So amazing
Whoooo,I've been waiting for 2 month's for another video I'm so happy
Can I get first class ticket 🧾
Absolutely insane, loved it
Cool
Wow that was good
YESSSSS
I’m in grade 3 and I’m learning about this
This comment will probably be lost, but I hope you know that I LOVE your videos. They're so entertaining and fascinating and I actually get a little sad when I see the video is almost over. Keep up the good, no, purr-fect work!
The new eminem
woah
cool
Cool!!!
Wallace would be proud of you, Chris.
THAT WAS THE MOST COOLEST THINGS I SEEN IN A Minute.
can you make a personal video about Bella please?
Imagine resetting this
Make more of these lego train things
NERD
Wake up, Half-Asleep Chris posted a new video
I WAS THAT
Hi
This dude knows all laws of physics lmao
Do i see bella
I se bella
Still not as enough orange juice...
This took very long to make, more than an hour which is....         'Very tiring' And also this could be your breakfast server everyday.
Chris at 1:50 be like: Rap God
Love how much efert you put into your vids
🙂
Hi
Hey chris Try to make a house of the vardbord bricks
Hi
at 3:17 You triggered every smart device in my home 😂
Because of COURSE Chris has an animated alarm clock.  Love the video! A wonderful machine to help make mornings a little more bearable!
Hi, it's been a while Chris!. I'm rehashing all ur videos and love ur content, keep it up!
Wow👁👄👁
Hi
I really appreciate the amount of detail in your videos, in one clip, I saw the cow milk-dispenser-thing blink it's eye!
This has to be your best video yet!
Ok
TRAIN WOOOO
You  deserve way more subscribers than you have.
im not a morning  person two i want to sleep
These Ralph and Bella plushies are epic
Let’s do a Collab “ I am not a morning person!”
Very good
Wow! That's really cool, but kinda useless. Btw, i just got the Ralph plushie, and he's really cute! Very good quality too, just like you said
You haven't been making a lot of vids lately
God mode lazy
I feel bad for all the bloopers he had
Y,know I would've been like oh I'll just use dispensers to do those things with a train but this is more cooler man
Now the more important question is who was filming everything that was happening while Chris was asleep?
TIME OUT YOU'RE A JELLYFISH FAN TOO
I thought is could take in words pretty fast… yeah he proved me wrong.
Chris, you made my Google home go off. LMAO
Chris always is a entertaining and has always been entertaining
Genius.
You should do one fir your cats
this is very much like the setup colin furz made
When he said “Alexa” my Alexa went on
Whats next? A made a train that can build my house for me
After a long break Great stuff
I love your videos!! They always put me in a good mood :D
Heath Robinson would be proud :D
Yes, another video! I love your channel
1:50, I wonder how many takes that took also imagine having to reset all of that it kinda defeats the purpose of making it automated
The fact that your name is half-asleep Chris makes this so much better
Yum
Mark rober has some competition
Very relaxing for some reason❤❤❤
Finally a new vid from my fav tuber
OMG....Chris, this was one of your most amazing videos ever! 😃
but you have cat, cat might push
500,000?
Hey Half-Asleep Chris! Here's a request for you to build an agility course for your cats. You could even train them to go through it if you wanted
946TH
Out of interest do you have any ideas like this that fail, if so you many videos have you had to scrap
me to
cool man chris
New Zealand! More New Zealand.
You should buy a 3d printer, it can print train tracks and other useful stuff. I used one to print train tracks. Love your videos!
next make a train  that can do dishes, sweep floors, shop, assassinate Putin, and tuck you in to bed
Can you make a lego train lunch machine?
This is what deserves all the fame and fortune. People like these who are genuine and nice with great ideas and are funny with great features
Every video is so mid and the posting is longggggg
this video took forever
I love all of these lego videos
how long dose it take to reset
This is so wholesome
This made me crave cereal
Milk after the cereal, I applaud you.
nice vid chris!! you must've kept a loft of effort and dedication building thia vid keep it up....been waiting for your video
Would it be annoying to keep resetting it each time before the next breakfast on the next day?
I haven’t even started watching video yet, but I think this will be a good video.
For whoever watched padington might know of the food train in the movie. Because this is very similar to the train in the movie.
WoW 0-0
Brilliant content yet again!
I'm so happy to see you posting again!
Ah yes "being-too-lazy-to-do-something-so-do-something-50x-harder-to-automate-that-as-an-excuse-to-make-Youtube-videos" lol
The breakfast machine from “Peewee’s big adventure”: pathetic
POV: Your day was just blessed because he posted!
THE LEGEND IS BACK
This morning I was like 'I havent watched a half asleep chris vid for a while'
4:48 Bella stalking into the dining room like "At least I don't have to be involved in this one." :)
I don't want to know what full asleep cris thinks of
Yolo
This is AMAZING I just wish he had space so he didn't need to take it down later (It was blocking the couch 🛋️)
this machine is really hard to retract
Please more cats i waited 2 months for this Also like h o w And also this is a m a z e
this is funny it did it to my phone 6:21
Probably kinda irrelevent BUT. My Ralph plushie has finally showed up and its the fluffiest thing I own. Great purchase no regrets
woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Loaf of bread 👍 (chain in comment's)
SO GOOD! 😄
I am so happy this made my day that you posted tysm
Me: Mum can we have Collin Furze at home Mum:We have Collin Furze at home Collin Furze at home: Me: I see this as a absolute win.
Chris where did your cats go?
How did you make this!?!?!??!!?
This is so charming, thank you Chris <3
Your videos are always fantastic, but... one tiny comment. One of the things you're doing perfectly is carrying on the great tradition of British eccentrics and inventors. We even get to see a Union flag teapot. So... Rube Goldberg? Rather than the original (and English) Heath Robinson? Back in the pre-internet age, Heath Robinson was the go-to name for this stuff in the UK, inspiring shows like The Great Egg Race etc (which I'm sure you'd have been perfect for). We need to keep the names of the British eccentric alive. And you're doing a great job.
This is a genius
Yay another video
You are a genius
this is cool :) keep up the good work!
2030: *”I built a REAL train to give me tea while I’m on holiday across Britain!”*
So instead of making himself breakfast he just spends 300 times of breakfast building it
I love this,  I miss Ralph and Bella, but I am sure they will be back soon.
I'm not a morning person too, but I watched this while actually eating breakfast - a singular piece of hot dog bun.
Happy Easter
I love how much lego related stuff you do on your channel, I may be slightly biased but its really cool to see!
Chris and Ralph are literally the irl version of Wallace and Gromit at this point
These videos are calm chaos lol
EPICCCXX
You're video is so epic 🔥🔥🔥
yes
You’re so good at explaining things in a way for everyone to understand, but I know you’re very talented in stem for you to take on these crazy projects. I appreciate you sir
for me it has been DAY'S since one of these video's have come out and you don't know how happy I am that this is back!
I got Lego ads on this video and nowhere else on youtube
The cow blinked!!!
Just like CORALINE
Yes i need it
Wouldn't it take longer to load the machine than to actually make yourself a bowl of cereal XD
Yea only 34 times bruh
Let's go new video!!!
Next is I built a Lego train to invade my cat
Finally, i have been dreading for this. FINALLY IT HAS CAME!!! After 7 weeks right finally it is done. So proud and I hope you are back on track to how you were. Love you as this really has been tough and I know but you did it!
I totally think that this guy took hundreds of hours to build this for his subs Wow
Imagine if everyone did thiss  :o
Chris is not the father/inventor form Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
2023: I cured cancer with a Lego™ Train.
I really want to see all the failed attempts
This is his best video yet!😃
858
I've never seen a lego contraption more unique as this! Amazing Job Chris! Much love from NZ
Thanks Danielle for your patience !
At 4:49 the cat is there
The chainreaction community approves 😜
Happy Easter, Chris! I don't know if it's Easter for you, but it is for us!
Warning: NEVER drink APPLE Juice in the mornings.
Epic!
I LOVE YOUR VIDEOS
Where is Ralph?🐱
I'm old enough to remember the Rube Goldberg diagrams in comic books, and I say he would be very proud of you!
Well it’s so cool it reminds me of in a Coraline when they have the big supper and the little gravy train 🚂
Ohh I built a Rube Goldberg Machine in school once
Yay another video!
Thank you Christopher, you make this day of mine always a happy day, it makes me feel better when you post and you always remain my favorite YouTuber. Thank you. =D ❤️
All the little details... like the cow jug blinking at 4:38...
Bruh this is what you do FOR 60 DAYS
I'm a morning person now. It only took 34 tries!
I’ve watched all your vids I am a mega fan
Keep on going
I love your channel
I love how this is turning into a Lego Chanel
BRILLIANT! 🤣👍👍 perfect entertainment!
Holey COW!!!!! Pun not intended , WOW. this was completely worth waiting for. I can see why it took you so long to make. THANK YOU for making my day so much better. You and Danielle are SUCH an adorable couple. You are a creative joy and as usual your editing, pacing and story telling are top notch. (Nice Cameo by Bella BTW. ) . I also wanted to say that I have received my plushies and am enjoying them very much. Danielle I am sorry if I spell your name wrong and thank you to you too for being such a marvelous sport about all this. thanks again
Is there a video where we can see the bloopers chirs?
Wallace and Gromit are becoming non fictional characters
could you do a video of your cats, but you feed them a variety of meat, because like there wild cousins, they are predators.
Only 34 tries, lol  it would of been time for lunch!
I immediately thought of Doc Brown's machine from the beginning of "Back To The Future", this was really creative
Let's just respect he will have to reset it every day
Best channle
Genius, now add a toaster a la Wallace
Love the use of lego trains, can't find anywhere else where they are used for important tasks
Pee Wee would be very proud
Love it so much
imagine someone misses a call with chris and his voicemail is still "ok google, do I have any events for today"
is nobody else asking how he managed to write 'MACHINE 3' in milk? Milk, for god's sake. I mean, how?
Are you a mechanical engineer?
this guy said, you know what,ill make a whole machine that makes me breakfast instead of making it myself
Thank you, finally a new video and a sign you're still alive. Love it!
great train
interviewing Chris in the morning be like, the reporter how was your sleep, Chris: RAOR
Hi
This is like Wallace and Gromit meets Paddington, an incredibly British combo. Love it!
I mean, he is half asleep, of course he’s not gonna be a morning person. He is an absolute genius tho
I got the Ralph and Bella plushies and they are so cute!
Is the engine itself custom? If not where can I buy it
Ahhhhh
This was the Lego version of Wallace and Gromit’s morning routine.
This feels like a silly idea but the execution is spectacular such a unique project to work on
man this is crazy!
Cool!
Today on Chris' gradual transformation into Wallace from Wallace and Gromit:
OH MY GOD, HE'S BACK, HE'S FINALLY BACK!!
We had to make a small change Rube Goldberg machine for school once- it took weeks of pain with only about 5 or 6 steps. MAD RESPECT CHRIS.
this man will make the future how we imagined it in 2016: electronics and invention. im betting on it.
i love it!!!!
This YouTube channel is a hidden jem in a bundle of 3 am and tick tock videos. You are my favourite YouTuber.
Amazing
I really hope the LEGO company are looking after you with free supplies at the very least.
Wallace and gromit: 100
This is my 7 year olds self dream
I thought these were called "Heath Robinson machines" in Britain. Though, yes, this does look more Goldbergesque. It doesn't fly. At least this explains the two-month wait...  BTW, at Buffalo Phil's in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin the food is delivered to your table by toy train, on a track. Lots of YouTube videos by delighted customers. Check it out.
Very looking forward to your next video, Chris! This was brilliant 😻
The engineering behind this is insane
MORE LEGOOOSS
Finally
that is soo cool
I just finished Learning about Rube Goldberg in science
If Doc Brown built with LEGO, he would have a a setup like this.  I suppose with him, it’s not “if” but “when”.
4 hours ago 6,6k likes
Finally you uploaded
So so much work
from 1:50 to 2:36 is basically just a dude perfect intro explained
Thank you for posting it is always joyful!
Chris definitely knows his audience.
I would have that in my house ngl.
This has very strong Wallace and Gromit vibes. 😊
I NEED THISS!!! All your videos take so long amd so much dedication! Keep it up 😆
The personal assistants talking to each other is genius
Anyone else get major Wallace and Gromit vibes from this, this is so brilliant Chris well done!
I liked it when he said several million times!
Oh man I love it! The time and effort you invest into these videos is just amazing. Keep Going!
you finally remembered your Youtube password
OMG how much work went into this video. Thank you for making it so cool! Your video's are always a delicious treat when they pop up!
Hi been subbed for ages wanted to say hi!
Love this video! (like all others)
HE BACK YAYYYY
More train
Can we have the whole vid with u fully explaining it
One day he's gonna make a lego train that literally does every basic human function lol
..now I want coco pops
I think you did a lot more work making the machine then actually making breakfast.
bro i been SHAKING waiting for this vid and i was not dissapointed
I wonder if he uses these contraptions in his day to day life
oh my cod this is so cool
What kind of magic is in your house, I saw a walking loaf of bread?
well done it didnt explode
Absolutely fantastic Chris! What dedication to this project! ❤️❤️❤️
hi
Actually we have a Danish name for those types of machines as well, a "Storm P. Maskine" after an old comic strip cartoonist who was known for silly machines like tho.  But these machines mostly wouldn't be able to work if you actually build them since they were rather silly. A joke he consistently used was a mechanism with a cheese under a glass cover - which was based on a kind of old saying that really really old and smelly cheese is able to walk by itself, thus this would be one of the moving parts of this whole thing that probably couldn't work in real life XD
*resetting everything in grumpy mood as you want to use it for tomorrow*
Hello. I am Sergiusz. I am from Poland. I 7 yesrs old. I am your fan. I like your cat's and movies in yt.
AMOGUS

little easter egg! at 5:04 you can see the please consider subscribing sigh in the backround also amazing chris hope you like your breakfast ^u^
What about reassembling the dominos
This is such a cool channel!

End result feels like a combination of Wallace and gromit and the opening scene of back to the future.
Wallus and gromit wish edition.
This is so useless yet i love it
I love how the Hey Siri in the video, triggered my siri.
THIS IS AMAZING! You always make me happy! I love your videos so much!
Steamed Breakfast. i love the little locomotive, it is beautiful.
Where are Ralph and Bella in this video. I need ralph and Bella
This man deserves way more subscribers than he has right now

Goldberg would be so proud!
Imagine if khaby lame whatched this. We all now what would happen....
The return of half asleep chris!!!
db
You're a real life Wallace & Gromit. If only Gromit was a cat...
Mark rober had been very quiet since this came out
Down below
Thats Doc Brown knocked out of his place.
This feels like a wallice and gromit invention!

Simply Wow! 👏👏👏
First 3 hours can I get a shoutout I love the stuff u do

Me 2.30 what the f*** is going on
5:07 love the LEGO bonsai tree, its a great set!
Come on Chris rlly breakfast express... BREAKSPRESS! It was right there man! Luv the vids been a fan since 2017 💕🚂🚂
I see Bella is still rocking the 🍩. 😁
You are AMAZING!   And where have you been?   I’ve missed your videos.
some people see this as a breakfast machine train thing      i see it as a really creative way to do a house tour
Plz make more videos i love ur cats from texas best wishes
Amazing video as always, well worth the wait ☺  But, it's really bugging me what the song is from 05:01, is it an acoustic cover of a famous song? It's driving me crazy 😂
I love this channel so so much thank you Chris for these amazing videos
I love it!!!
So, how many had their iPhone or iPad stop when he said “Hey Siri?” Me too. Great video Chris and I can’t begin to imagine all the work (or satisfaction) involved in putting this together.
He’s back!
Make a trian in your freezer
talk about half-asleep
Hi
Hey Chris great job on your breakfast train it was pretty good 😁👍❤️❤️👍😎😁
Youre vids are amazing
The hello google activated on my device when the voice mail activated
The amount of time and effort it took to make this contraption is seriously impressive and very creative! I respect the dedication into making this into reality.
This was incredibly fun to watch and it must have been very complex to design and assemble and frustrating to test out.  I am reminided of those music videos from OK Go !  I always love your videos, Chris, but I wish there had been kitties in this video somewhere.
hey you uploaded on my birthday
Genius!! And what an awesome girlfriend Danielle is!!!
Happy easter!
I love the transitions
I enjoy your videos will you do abother QA
Lazy productiveness at its finest
Hey chris can you build me one of these
I feel like this is more of an inconvenience than just making breakfast.
Until the end of the video I thought he was eating coffee beans
Tony hotline maimi
:3
i love trains and i would also love to make that 2 but i did had a lego train (2 of them)(60051 and 60052) but they got disdroy but i only had them for 5 days but when i get a new one with a power in it ill deffly do what you did  but also i did do a plate,bol and cup holder but i didnt get to use it cus my perent think it wont work so i had to put it apert
Reminds me of the good ol' dos game The Incredible Machine
Uncle sams cereal?
This looks awesome!!!
Great video as always Chris!
this is absolutely ridicoulus and i love it
this is amazing:D
genius flipping genius
Nice
I am a big fan
Breakfast lore
This reminds of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang! 🤣
Worth the wait, nice video!
This reminds me of the breakfast machine from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
This is amazing, there are a lot of these but one of my favorites are in paddington
Mad coralline vibes lol
Hello mate, I just moved to England.
Why are you so cute? 😝
<3
Wow I love it
The music sounds familiar, did you have inspiration?
I wish I had this before school
Let’s give a massive shout out to Danielle for dealing with this so we can get these nice videos
The king is back
I relate to the noise you make in the morning on a spiritual level.
Just cleaning my mess with my old CDs
FINALLY A VIDEOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Look at it this way, you did all of this just so you didn't have to get out of bed and make yourself breakfast 😅😭. But the general concept is very nice and I love the video, keep up the good work.
I love your lego videos.
I had the same idea and you made it possible
Love this
Hi Chris how are you ?
This reminds me of chitty chitty bang bang. The breakfast scene.
my only concern's are ralph and bella since ya know *cats*
Fun fact: i poure in the milk before the cerial,so i can put the milk in the microwave, so as to eat hot cearial
I want that concraption !
See also Heath Robinson, who was a fellow Brit and predates Rube Goldberg!
How come I've never realized orange juice is YELLOW
the quality of These videos get better and better but never change how the videos feel  its always great to See when you upload
It’s real life Wallace and Gromit moment
This is amazing I love this I want one
how does this only have 25k views its a master piece
pov: what quarantine does to you
Can you do more banknote videos plz 💶
Yes another video
I don’t remember Wallace & Gromit having a YouTube channel?
i wish i could have that
sir, you are a amazing!!
"please concider subscribing" he says.. I was subbed, but with one video every 1-2 months, your channel got removed when i cleaned up my subscriptions.. And since YT told me about the new video i don't see the point to sub. :)
I love this channel
The true master engineer of youtube
At the start of the vid I thought it sounded cool and it was
"All that's left to happen is to get a good night's sleep." *ad appears*
I want one now. Mmm food. Gimme.
This is completely amazing chris!!! (Also you made my day with the steam engine!!)
does I'm the only one who saw what that cow has blinking
you are amazing at creating things!
wow
This channel is my 1. Favourite channel on YouTube. Like literally! 🏆
I mean I'm not trying to sound like a bot about but can we a appreciate how much effort he puts in his videos  like a cereal train what a unique topic
As a train enthusiast I found this a very creative breakfast 😁
Great to have you back Chris!
dang he really became wallace from Wallace and Gromit
Coo, video
Yes 2 months of waiting
i love your videos! do you like lord of the rings? who is your favorite character?
I love these videos keep making awesome Lego trains and, just a video idea, could you make a Lego city? That would be sick
So cool!
This.. was... AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THE LEGEND HAS RETURNED!!!..
I've missed your channel but this video is so cool the amount of effort you put in is astounding 👍👍
Will you make more videos
NICE CHRIS!
It's been so long I thought you died
I actually enjoyed the video and subscribed
Alright, I'm convinced that Chris is actually made out of lego.
Hi :D
Damn you should’ve deyd the water for the pond pump
this reminds me of Joeph's Machines
its times like these I wish I could double like and subscribe!
Genius use of the cat feeder
I love this ! Keep up the good work :)
why is it lego tho
I have done this too
I’m intrigued
Doc Brown but British
We've all dreamed of this as kids. Great Video!
Can we just appreciate how much effort he puts in each and every one of his video
I’m so impressed by his work
i have a feeling that if you guys ever met, you and Mark Rober would get along really well
This new episode of wallace and gromit is looking pretty dope. But in all seriousiness this is pretty awsome
Joseph Machines gotta see this.
There a really famous Japanese channel called ピタゴラ　スウィッチ (Pitakora swiltuchi) if you wanna google it, that is just a broadcast dedicated to machine like contraptions shown here that gets broadcasted on tv all of the country, it’s really satisfying to watch.
*he puts cereal first then milk* *Absolute ledgend*
When the passengers get on, they have to eat breakfast or they get pulled apart. Their hair piece gets removed first. THIS IS LEGO LOL
This is honestly just incredible lol. Even if it took a million tries, still so cool. I love the cheesy bit in the middle with all the devices, so ridiculous
Wallace and Gromit flashbacks
The vid is so worth the longgggg wait
I love the new amount of effort you put it into this!!! I've been watching for a loooooong time
Your the type of guy who's childhood wonder never left him and its AMAZING!
BOTH MY CAT PLUSHIES GOT HERE. DEY CUTE
YOUVE BECOME CARACTICUS POTTS!!
Hi im a big fan
People oughta refer to you as Wallace at this point.
1:10 haters will say that this is in reverse
I'm mad you're my favourite channel I hate waiting 2 months and 3 days just for an 8 minute video 😡PS. i'm kidding all wait 2 years to see those crazy cats
I love your videos so much me and my mom watch them all the time! My cat jueses looks and has the same personality as Ralf!
No wonder Chris is half asleep
This is like that contraption Wallace and Grommit use!
He’s back
That must've taken days and days! How do you get the time to make such amazing things? :D
This is Avery good example of half asleep Chris. Also this takes a lot of work thanks :D
The legend is back
Posts in the morning
Chris is at again with his awesome LEGO ideas!
This man is way too smart for lego
The thing with google and Alexa is awesome lol.
❤
Gimme
Couldn’t ask for anything better on my birthday!
you solved breakfast the programmer's way - spending hours to create an automatic way to deal with something that takes 5 minutes manually
Very _Wallace and Gromit_ !
You have made almost every childhood dream I’ve had.
I just say it’s funnier when you try to say how it works really fast
2:26 I actually have those marble tracks. Seeing this here, I wonder if my marble tracks set came from the UK
you are like the smartest person ever   you deserve more subscribers
BELLA!
I need this, literally
Ads are the best
😏
I need this, literally
This is a masterpiece!
youre a genius chris
Hi
I NEED!!!!
Nice job mate now go enjoy a good game of football
Yes the cd player, Siri, the phone, voicemail, Google home, Alexa and the cat feeder using teamwork for half asleep Chris to get his breakfast
I love the idea! It's so cool. But two design flaws. 1. It takes up so much space even blocking your sofa out of commission. 2. Do you preset it with the milk and juice sitting out all night so it's luke-warm by morning?
lol
We love you, Chris!
legos are cool
I LOVE THIS!!!!!!
This remind me of the Chitty Chitty Bang Bang where there food is made by machine
This is just amazing! Keep up the good work!
This is like the breakfast machine from chitty chitty bang bang
But I love it tho
The funny thing is,you have to reset it everything before you go to bed which is pretty ironic
Did your cat die?
How long did it take to make
That was amazing when are you going to do a cat video
This is so awesome!  I love Rube Goldburg machines!
I love this!
how many times did you say "this" in this video!?!
Congrats on 1.5 million subscribers
Why are you so amazing?
Noice
The dislikes are from people who eat  toast
Finally new video
Whoa, Pee Wee Kinda build right here, Love it!
I’ve already watched this 3 times because im bored
45 mins ago!
I love how this became a lego channel
loved the video as usual Chris p.s. i like the ralph plush
I think this dude is Kevin from home alone when he got older
I did kinda something like this once! Very epic:3
Good job
you are if grain was not a minecraft youtuber
I love it and vary satisfying
This is genius
Bella giving a guest appearance made my day :D
Okay Wallace. Guess you will have to rename one of your cats to Gromit.
e
Rube Goldberg would be thrilled!
But man-made
_thats how everybody find their breakfast the morning_
breakfast machine be like
Finally here
This was AMAZING!! Thank you so much to you and Danielle for doing this, it was SO much fun to watch. Well done Chris, you should be very proud of yourself and we love your videos!
this is some wallace and gromit stuff right here
Woah cool, if only it is possible to prepare indian breakfasts this way.
This is the best and most wholesome channel out there! Subscribe to get him to 2 mill
AWESOME
Your cinematography just gets better every video. The first minute or so of this video was absolutely mental, well done!
I'm not even going to begin to imagine how you conceptualized this. Wow, just wow. This is so freaking awesome.
Wow love your videos keep up the good work!!!🙂
Under 1‘000 coments!
OMG FINALLY, A ANOTHER MASTERPIECE BY HALF ASLEEP! great vid btw
He uploads!
Rule 1 of any filmmaking (this in response to your comment on explanations):  Show, don't tell.
I like the way the train looks so hopefully with it's liytle glass and bowl.
Ooo amazing
Woah
This is awesome content. Thank you. ;-;
WOW SOO COOL.
Half asleep Chris, am I able to use your theme in my own videos? Thx
You are a genius. I love it! I love your "Did it work?" and VICTORY!
Very creative, your videos always make me happy
Anyone else thinking of kronk
Guys remember, the longer it takes for chris to be gone, the better the next video will be
HE IS FINALLY BACK and pretty good idea also
Hello
Chris is really making good use of the Lego tracks he's got.
Lets ignore that he eats cereal and drinks orange juice for breakfast
I am wondering if the cats won't break it
EZZZZ!1!1!
EEEEE!1!1!!1
GG!1!1!!11
Gg
I can't believe how much dedication and effort he puts in his videos. I truly respect his work
Its been soooo long (also the vid is amazing :) )
Ok
WOW!  I thought the X-mas snow globe was awesome but this tops it.  I cannot guess what might be next.  Thank you!
I missed your videos
Chris always making the best inventions.
Early. Anyways great invention!
Absolutely amazing! Stupidly Stupendous! Crazily Cool!     I ran out of rhymes....
But won't the milk and orange juice spoil from sitting out unrefrigerated?
Cool
Early gang 😎
you gotta give whoever built your toilet a medal, after drinking milk with orange juice...
Okay, this is great.
Why you were not for 2 months
These lego videos are AWESOME! Good work!
I look forward to every time I se a video was made by you
What do you do with the stuff you makes in your videos after you make them? Do you store them in your garage are demolih them?
You come up with the best ideas
All of these creations are amazing by the way what do you do with all the wood once the video is made
I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo excited to watch this
mmm breackfist
Very cool i love how you do this kind of stuff
Danielle has to be the best partner ever! As much as I love seeing the results I don't think I would want to live through  the process of this project.
Judging by the way all the tracks are laid, I'm guessing you're living alone these days. 😁
I am loving these lego builds.
You are obsessed with lego train but it's cool
Chris is channelling his inner Wallace and Gromit and I love it.👍
This is incredible! I forgive you for not uploading in a while because this is awesome.
Bekfast
Your videos are always so enjoyable and funny!
That’s just Genius!
Cool, but how are you going to reset the machines?
I quite enjoy your creativity!
You have to give credit to the people who makes these kinds of videos  Very amazing :D
Where is the Toothpaste express? A balanced thing to the orange juice ;)
Amazing! Now include Ralph and Bella, what could possibly go wrong?
New vid 😁
You have out  done your self.
YES FINALLYYYYYY A NEW VIDEO AFTER 2 MONTHS AND WOW THIS IS COOLLLL
Its so funny when he said «and it only thook 34 tries
This just feels like movie prop
This reminds me of a scene from my favorite movie as a kid (Chitty Chitty Bang Bang) and I love it
I really like your explanations regardless of how long they may take. Love your content!!!
What a great machine!
I appreciate that you cleaned and tidied your home for this video.
He’s obsessed with Lego
early
Mark Rober eat your heart out! This is amazing! I imagine the cats made it a bit difficult to make, but it turned out perfectly! Even if you had to try 34 times xD can we get a blooper reel?
Danielle must have phenomenal patience 😂
Lol nice
Happy to see the new video after a while! Great job! ❤️
Til that orange juice was yellow

I love your videos chris
All of your videos are incredible and are very creative. Well worth the wait for all of them. 😊
Nice idea I would love to have a train like this so cool
I don’t know why but I LOVED the way you did the stop motion for “machine 1”  and “machine 2” I thought it was so cool!!!

Videos that actually makes you learn. Probably might answer a trivia question.
Hahaha! This was both nuts AND awesome! :D
Love the lego train 😍

Hi
Other people when lazy for breakfast: I'll just skip breakfast Chris: *casually builds a chain-reaction contraption *  Seriously though I dunno how you come up with such brilliant and creative ideas such as this!
Chris puts so much time and thought into his videos
Yay new upload
You never disappoint me chris

Fantastic video, it must have taken ages to sort all that out  :)
About 10 minutes ago I was eating breakfast and thinking about Half-Asleep Chris and wondering about his next video- then I got online and saw he posted a new video :O
Awesome! Keep it up!
A Childhood dream... A toy machine that makes you food
Wowed

This has to be the coolest thing ever
I've always had a thought of using a tomy plarail Thomas to activate some sort of alarm clock.. This video is probably the closest thing to it
Wow! That took a lot of work! Love it! Good job!
I am so happy when you post a Lego video!
Can we just appreciate how much effort he puts into each and every video 🙏
Can you make a southern pacific train do you know how to do the kazotsky kick can you show Bella and Ralph
