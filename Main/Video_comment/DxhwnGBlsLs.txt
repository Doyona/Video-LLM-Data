Magnus not getting his northern English humour 😂😂
That was freaking amazing! Good job, big man!!!
Can magnus get the rock climb the rock ?
I love this dude
W Eddie recommending Turkish get ups!
Funny-strongman Eddie
“I’ll be lucky if I last 30 seconds.” Never heard anything more relatable in my life
Eddie has never been this tired before in his life... I promise😂
Hahahahahahaha hilarioussss vedioo... Respect to both ❤
Eddie: “ last time I climbed a tree I fell over and broke my arm.”   Old mate at 8:30 this whole climb had me laughing pretty agile for 170kg 😂
The bigger your muscles become, the more lactic acid buildup you have (THE BRUN) - as a grade school kid I could climb those ropes in a flash... and even do an Iron Cross on the rings. So proud of myself. Yet, when in my 30's, after years of intense training, when my arms got to 22" from body building, I became a laughing stock and my kids even laughed at me, trying to do simple strongman hanging feats on the boardwalk.  I am a victim of show-muscles- by my own doing and I wouldn't change a thing.
Rock Climber vs Rock Lifter
It's like watching a boulder boulder.
Would have been interesting if Magnus tried to do some of these while wearing weighted gear to match Eddie's weight. But I think 100kg is too much to wear on.
I love this content, thank you
Btw the heaviest Turkish get up was 115 kg
fun fact they put a man on the moon
Loge it both dune well and eddy did well cond sider how much heavier  he is would be good for him to do  to improve grip wosh all well  last time I'd wall  my only real problem  was fear of falling g
Waiting on the @shaq collab
"Can I clean here?"
I reckon all Eddie would have to do is ask the King nicely
4:05 reminds me of "A Difficult Game About Climbing"
3:20 he actually looks like king kong climbing the empire state building
Why climb the wall when you can just bash through it 😂
steroids kill
The Turkish get-up world record had the kettlebell snatched on the back of his forearm, not upright.
I'll climb the ladder...
I think this is the closest I have ever seen KingKong in live...
Pregnant Edweena is allmost felling the whole wall🤣🤣🤦🏿‍♂🤦🏿‍♂
Eddie likes to pick things up and put them down !!😮
4:07 gorilla tag

crazy, just crazy, mad respekt to Eddi for this :D thanks @Magnus to show us that even a 170kg man can outclimb you :P
Kudos to Eddie for always humbly trying new things, ignoring how silly he’ll look
it would be cool to see Magnus try with a 50kg vest then 75kg then 100kg.
1:51 The shape of that lol
8:33 holy shit 😮 Eddie got up far
1:46 was magnus clowning on eddie? 😂 The rock looked like 🍆 and magnus said “that’s what you like right”
8:41 “I’m pissing in the wind here mate” 😂😂
i was getting upset that i'm 80kg and won't be able to progress in climbing hahahahha
370? thats the average American here
Imagine if Eddie switched to only training rock climbing for like a year... I think he would have one of the most impressive physiques ever.
I can see where some ballet turnout would be helpful.
"you're stronger than you think'" LOL
Eddie is built different.
So impressive. Seriously.
I like how this gym color codes everything. My home gym and nearby gyms just puts tags
While Hanging, he just looks like a chubby pendu guy
14:00 Great job, Eddie! Truly impressed as a fellow climber! Do some climbing for a year, and watch your physique transform even more.
14:35 “we put a man on the moon” neither of them are American or from America 😭
Jack and the Beanstalk came to mind
9:03 Magnus casually going down the wall looks so effortlessly graceful it caught my breath.  great effort from Eddie <3
God damn Eddie is strong
1:47 "that's what you like, yeah?" as he holds on to the 🍆💀
Insane a dude that big can pull some of those off.
2:02 that holder just above magnus’s head - looks like the designer was having fun😂
Great stuff lads
6:22 telling the former world's strongest man that he's stronger than he thinks is hilarious
the maintenance team watching this is abject horror:
“You’re defo the strongest person to climb this wall” bro he’s the strongest person to step foot in that country 😭
i go to the same gym!! realised halfway through the video
Just fuck the wall Eddie :)
That must crush his fingers with 170 kilo hanging off them
5:05 the spider pig reference had me rolling 😂
1:22 camera man had one job
13:10 RIP King Charles
devil is a puss
What I love about Eddie is that even tho he had every right to be obnoxious and ego filled he is humble and respects other people’s professions
Francis Bourgeois mentioned!!!! <3
I love the Francis Bourgouis reference
What sort of team did they need to inspect the structural integrity of that wall both before and after the beast was unleashed upon it?
Eddie doesn't act like like world's strongest man. I haven't seen much of him, but he seems humble and not all in your face about it.
Tried all the hacks. ice baths, preworkouts, even dopamine detoxes. none of it clicked. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a comment and I checked it out. been locked in ever since. no hype, just clarity. wild how long I was running on fumes.🔥

.... " Why can't I just go for that one?..." 8:58 COME ON EDDIE!!!!
.... " Sir. Eddie Hall " Should be On His Letterhead.... Eddie has Done Much Around the World for British Sport... And He's No  Arrogance whatsoever.... Greetings from Bradford West Yorkshire 6:13
..... WHO IS THIS SKINNY BLOKE THEN 0:03 😂😂😂😂 GREETINGS FROM BRADFORD YORKSHIRE ENGLAND
Those shoes were handicapping him.
His fake "carbon steel" pan bend tho lol. Its either aluminium or some soft steel coz carbon steel just breaks.
magnus, im your biggest fan from malaysia..show your strength routine on a week 😊
I haven’t bouldered in years, but my palms were sweating like I was there
impressive a huge  man can even do level orange
W
Overweight human equals useless human being. Sorry Eddie!
This dude is like a grizzly bear. You can’t go hide from him up a tree !
*man falls off the wall*  "in an hour that's gonna be me"
Man weighing so much that him climbing is additional strength training 🫡
Greg
Lifting 170 kg from the ground like that on the blue rocks is actually crazy
wow, magnus @ 20:25 'ish, next episode, Eddie does a free solo with magnus and Alex !
Turkish Getups? That looks like such an old time strongman move, somewhat due to the danger of smashing your head in with the weight. Like old circus strongmen doing giant hammer levers to their face. If they can't they will smash themselves.
love knowing that eddie hallwatches family guy
New here so binge watching all his videos but it’s so funny seeing eddys big ass trying to climb 😂😂 especially after watching him lift for so long
Similar to watching Magnus match Eddie is the right room watching Eddie climb as good as he did was super impressive. I don't think Eddie knows how good he did! That was mad impressive for a guy his size
6:27 Telling Eddie Hall "you're stronger than you think" is really something else :D
4:29 You are one of them Eddie! 😄
What the hell is Eddie filming with his go pro lmao
Spider pig spider pig
Notice how the people featured on this channel are so gentle and humble?  Some of the strongest and most talented people and so gentle… until they have no choice.  Definitely don’t want to be on the receiving end when they hulk out.
Watching this just so I know what I could do when I try it for the first time tomorrow.  280 lbs, getting into climbing because of a webtoon.
5:28 Eddie : I am waiting for one to rip off... I was wondering the same.
Woooow, this guy is athletic as hell. Amazing.
I always defined a good rock climber by - the weight to strength ratio, short people had a better chance than guys like me (6' 8" / 220).  I still did some climbing - but not overhead.
The leg things make no sense to me. I would think leg strength is vital for pushing off and assisting with pulling
Good job eddie
19:50  I love rock climbing and I feel like dabbing because your foot slipped is different than dabbing so you can push off the ground
Turkish get ups aren't for the faint hearted... But excellent for coodernated strength as balance uses a lot of core muscles....the concentration on the kettle bell brings another element into it which is interesting... I've managed 20kg but it's so hard to do more than a few as you have to go slowly to control your balance... Disciplined exercise
Here after I just saw a video of Eddie yelling that he’d muder someone’s family and kids on twitter lol
This channel just appeared and I am watching everything and for once happy for the suggestion! Meanwhile I think Eddie is a big softy, he always has a cheeky twinkle in his eye.
For someone Eddies weight he did good. Brian Shaw next.
Conserving energy while climbing takes a lot of practice and technique.  This guy did really well, that's not your average big boy.. he is solid muscle.  Power lifting is mad strength in short bursts and his legs weren't even twitching when facing sustained fatigue.  Well done, a true athlete outside his comfort zone.
brian shaw is stronger lol
I wanna see Mahnus with a 100kg backpack
"Just remember, they put a man on the moon" is going to be my new favorite quote.
Eddie!
you would never know eddie is 6’3”
The sudden position change at 8:28 is hilarious 😂 seeing such a huge being in that position away from a floor
That man looks so kind this is so cool
Like seing a bear climb up a tree
It's funny to imagine a 12 year old would probably be able to do the same climbs. It's so much about strength/weight and flexibility that the strongest man struggles too.
eddie's body has to constantly use more muscle strength, on top his circulatory system is going faster since he has a such a massive body which is packed with dense muscles. So yea it may seem like he's "out of breath" but that probably his body doing any type of exercise just because of his huge body. Which is a HUGE reason for everyone to do cardio. you can only benefit from cardio even as a bodybuilder. of course they will be doing less, but its crucial to actually function with so much muscle.
yo
Nice! It was way morr challenging than I first thought. Especially for the lungs. Kepp up the good work guys 💪
I've only climbed in a gym like twice. Climbed plenty as an absolute noob on the rocks of WV moutnains. But Magnus, your videos are so goddamn fun...I want to go back to the gym ASAP!
Dude in the background at 15:18. Your moves make me hurt.
He dabbed a few times but I didn't have balls to tell him. This is wholesome. What a pair :) Smiling all the way through this. Power to you eddie, that's a lot of mass to move up these walls.
He got no chance of doing it. To do this sport and be successful, you need to be light and strong in hands and legs...
I think it's the skandi in Magnus... But everytime he said something uplifting it seems that he doesn't mean it... 😂 no expression, i know he doesn't mean it that way... But its kinda look unusual😂😂😂
You can literally see the panel move at times. LOL He did really good though.
100% need to get Brian Shaw to do this
Hey Magnus, Let us know next time your're in the UK would be great to meet a Climbing inspiration! (Was this the climbing gym in shieffield btw?!)
anyone else hoping Magnus would put on a 100kg weight vest and try a climb?
Eddie doesn't climb he forces the wall into the earth
"I'm a fit guy" Dudes 350 pounds. Your heart doesn't care if your weight is fat or muscle. It still puts a strain on it. Fit is not the word I'd  use. Strong yes fit no.
ok... let's all sit here and pretend he hasn't practiced that climb 100 times. Anyone here that has bouldered knows that your first few times is ROUGH and clearing a 4-5 like that on his "first time" is pure bs
Impressive.  These two have good chemistry.  But then again Eddie's got to be one of the coolest guys to hang out with.  Same with Magnus.
Wtf he was really good
Eddie twinkle toes😂
Damn eddy has some serious calves in terms of visibility even when they are so massive
watching eddie climb is so relatable
Eddie really trying he's really good
I can't even climb over a wall
shout out to the train spotter
love it!!! but gota ask ! did u ever use roids?
They should recreate the Mountain vs Oberyn
Omg I love Eddie! That was so awesome 👏🏻 I’m inspired!
I’m a little bit taller than Eddie but weigh about the same without his massive muscles. I’m amazed about how he can hold himself up
Mad props to Eddie!! Impressive!
8:27 the comedic timing of that cut
0:23 That’s the craziest fucking clip I’ve ever seen haha
british lad
I have never heard the don’t use your legs/you don’t need legs theory in rock climbing ever
If you’ve never tried climbing it’s so much harder than it looks. He did way better than I thought he would.
I'm not a rock climber by any means, hell... getting up stairs is a chore, but what is logical to me is that to be successful, it would require hitting that balance between strength and weight just right. Please correct me if i am wrong. I am genuinely curious.
Wow, Eddie,  impressive.
That was impressive
Eddie being able to do that is actually pretty impressive wow
8:25 I accidently went 15 seconds forward and found Mag on the wall alongside Eddie lol. EVERYONE TRY IT NOW
Magnus do you believe any man went to the moon in 1969?
there's a vid out there of Eddie swimming miles around a huge feezing cold lake, mans a proper athlete, he aint just strong
"Allegedly" when its eddies turn 😂
0:16 me when she says my dish is more like a ham carbonara
Is nice to see two respectful , humble people helping each other by sharing knowledge
Eddie is such a real one
8:18 look at that calfes😮😮😮😂😂😂 Freaking beast
that was sick, makes me want to climb and throw my kettlebells around
Eddie I have to say. Hate (Mr beast) stealing off your handle, Mr beast is a while privilege USA kid. Blah!
Eddie halls calves are awsome
Time to do another video with Eddie!
Where is Mariusz Pudzianowski?
18:25, try refusing eddie lol
He seems like such a nice chill guy yo
Eddie has such a great personality.
I just started climbing a few weeks ago and I'm hooked. And I absolutely felt it when Eddie said his fingers were losing strength so fast. That's the biggest obstacle for me right now is my lack of finger strength. Just gotta keep working at it!
are u from germany cuz your sayng that yeaa like a german
Best bouldering video on youtube
You know what... I think I'll take up climbing as my next sport
i wanna be just like magnus
What a good teacher
I mean he very strong, but also hualing 370 lbs
Climbing at 360 (American) is fucking wild. The sheer volume he needs to lift.
Weird how Eddy is 6’2 but doesn’t really seem that much taller than Magnus who is 5’9.
That "ALLEGEDLY!!" by Eddie is THE TRUTH! 🔥
What you need to realize is how hard it is to climb when you're bigger, just because you have that much more weight you need to be able to lift against gravity. Balance isn't as simple either, because you can't pull in as close to the wall. Props to him for challenging himself! My climbing partner is twice my size, but probably has four times my strength, but there are routes he struggles with a lot that I can breeze through, just because I'm smaller.
Imagine going to this place and seeing eddie hall climbing😂
Jesus, starts him right on bouldering and he still does great.
drink every time you hear COME ON or NEXT HOLE IS GOOD   if THE NEXT HOLE IS REALLY GOOD you have to empty the glas/bottle   you better only do that with water
you should do an aphrodisiac playbook or so "the next hole is good. come on, the next hole is REALLY good"
Eddie climing look like Po in Kungfu Panda 😂
Climber Hugh Herr lost his lower legs trapped climbing in a storm. Not only lighter but he created custom prosthetics like incremental extensions to reach in difficult spots
this is awesome
'Bloody ell'....'thats keen!' From a fellow Stokie...👍
lmao Magnus one and only encouragement phrase is 'come on'; it cracks me up how he's constantly telling them 'come on' like a stern father haha
I know it's probably some free generic music but the music at @6:40 is the same as The Why Files introduction music.
8:10 the calf
Just remember, they put a man on the moon
1:30 “That is gonna be me, in an hour that’s gonna be me.” The same time the guy falls to his butt
1:09 massive?
Can't believe it's Eddie's first indoor rock climbing. He did really well.
Me Lats!
Thanks, appreciate the fact of being slim rather than overweight 😂😂😂
Lots of respect to Eddie Hall to put himself out there doing something not in his wheel house.   He is a big man in several ways.
Very good for the first time! Great 😊
a rock climbing a rock
His calves are insane
15:19 so good
And these are modern humans! Ancient humans would have been stronger than even the strongest modern human!
Hey Mr.Hall you have my full Respect,and you show that your not an easy givin up guy with some sence of  Fun and you love the competition against your self very good
Eddi for President. Such a funny and good guy
16:32. WTF!  Your wrist isn't even turned out. Thats fkn crazy!!!
I think it’s time to slim down big lad ! I’ve dropped 83kg and feel amazing
I would not have guessed that Eddie would be the one showing Magnus a Turkish getup lol. Eddie is one hell of an athlete.
please do the same with the mountain
i've never heard of this "turkish get up" excercise, but it really highlights what is so great about strong man excercises! it's functional, it's whole body, it's about stabilisation and control above all else. this is the type of stuff that improves function! and to top it off, it doesn't require any particularly sophisticated equipment.
An Anglo-Saxon and a Viking make the best of friends lol. What a great video 👍
Surprised Eddie didn’t tear the wall down
170kg im suprised he didnt rip the wall off, eddie was national champ swimmer aswell im sure some boy
Strongest man to walk this earth was Samson
Jesus loves you all
I thought Eddie was a cool guest on your show. His pick of the Turkish getups I thought was pretty insightful. Just a chill. Funny dude that tries his best every single time
the whole wall bend when he climb XD
am i the only one that thinks eddy looks like Soap but more swole?
This is what I tell people about when I say I prefer functional muscle over gains at the gym.  Eddie is impressive in the sense that he can crush my head between his hands but I feel like stamina is a more useful trait in an overall build.
A 400 pound man legitimately better by a mile than most people less than half his weight
Same guy hypnotizes himself for a metal
If Eddie fasted two days a week and climbed those two days he would be a lean beast.
dengan infrastructur di negara anda tu. mmg sesuai saiz tu.
Du e en skikkelig god veileder/coach,Magnus🏆👌
Mad respect to the rocks
Great work keep it up!!!!
This is like watching a locomotive doing autocross. Kind of impressive for this size of a man
So you guys are bffs now right?
Damn was not expecting to be that good on the first go being he’s so heavy props dude
No leg day for me - I identify as a climber
Yo you are the guy that you were in Brandon’s video
As a semi-beginner climber it makes me happy to see that the strongest man in the world also has trouble with these climbs and gets out of breath. Sometimes I fail a climb and think “I’m just not strong enough” but the technique is really half the battle
something about the strongest man in the world also being extremely nice and charming is great
13:23 that is the most impressive thing I have ever seen.
You can see the wall heave out every time Hall moves to a new grip.
Very impressive
😂😂 they are trying to make it look so high up. It’s not!! Germany indoor rock climbing and USA is not for beginners like UK 😂
good to see the gym climbing eddie
13:45 170KG with finger grip alone that is true mental strength eddie surprises me every single day thats a record on its own just with the fingers. The most impressive part of the video by far MENTAL
19:50 Honestly im not sure any amount of technique would enable at 170 kg person to not slide on those footholds. Friction can only do so much
DISCLAIMER: No boulders were harmed in the making of this video
really good job to Eddie,  for such a massive guy he did well, only contractions can eliminate you out for hours ;)
Eddie "twinkle toes" The Beast.
Only eddie could cheers mate a dude off so casually. After being the biggest man in the gym whos also the nicest
1:30 *dude falls* "Thats gonna be me"
I love the Eddie is out here just trying all the sports
Put x2 and eddie will look like a strong baby
he's an unassuming man, great swimmer too, much more athletic than he looks!
Hearing Eddie go "ooh you slag!" Reminds me why I used to watch him 😂. Lost interest after all the Thor beef though :(
Imagine going clibing and you just see Eddie there😅
Look at eddies calf at 8:12 it’s crazzyyy
that look eddie gave after saying blue done 19:50 is hilarious
8:26 the cut from him at the start to dangling diagonally has me dying
18:42 did magnus just slip
Casually shows Magnus in a normal person collage
he actually seems like such a sweet and nice person 😭 you would think he is intimidating but he's so down-to-earth and funny
Magnus is alot stronger then eddie for size weight difference or ratio, eddie is also full of steroids and pretty useless at everything other then lifting heavyweights
Imagine some poor kid runs around as Eddie slips.
Just remember, they have 100kg difference between them!
Eddie truly is a beast!. It's actually inspiring. Great collaboration Magnus!!!
I used to smoke rocks for a living so I'm really good at climbing fences. I wonder if my old skills from my past profession would help me with rock climbing 🤔
That's highly dissapointing that he's going for bodybuilding now. There is no reason to do that other than fueling your ego. Its unhealthy and you are going to be bested by real athletes anyways. Sad.
The reoccurring man on the moon joke was so underrated 😂 every time it was perfect
As a Brit I read the conversation as you asking “does it make a difference” for the impact on grip wearing climbing shoes when pulling cars during the worlds strongest man competition. Hence the exaggerated response of “oh huge”. Then it took a swerve and you were joking about custom made. Eddie managed to keep up though🤣 0:58
Eddy did super well, even if he weighed 100kg less I’d be impressed with that
spider pig? that guy was watching technoblade!
Incredible effort from Eddie here. He’s so aware that this isn’t his forte and yet he unapologetically gives it a go and listens to Magnus’ advice. Excellent sportsmanship.
Markus is not a small and thin man but man how he looks standing next to the Beast :-D
Magnus usually looks big and masculine, but next to Eddie, he looks like a normal guy.
hulk meets spiderman
Given how heavy Eddie is… respect 🤛
8:37 beautiful scene even a year later
He’s ace. 🤯fancy footwork at 170kg.
To be the best climber in the world, ya gotta chop ya legs off
Eddie singing Spider Pig from the Simpsons Movie is somehow not at all what I expected and entirely expected from Eddie climbing!
We need Khan Baba to show his climbing skillz !
The stronger the man, the better the climber. Rock climbing is all about strength
Very entertaining. Enjoy the show of endurance. Glad the guest enjoyed the exercise.  Nice thanks.
bro said in the begining of the video, you stronger than you think, to was, the strongest man in the world.
Now try what eddie does
the fat guy is meant to be 6' 3" the short one 5' 7", i think the fat guy is lieing.
Climbing this easily for his size just shows how strong Eddie is
So many great climbing tips!
Eddie "man on the moon" hall
real men don't climb mountains they demolish them
I just took the world's strongest bodyguard climbing 😅. I think I have found Eddie's competition 😂
Legend says that there was earthquakes in China each time Eddie jumped back to the ground...
eddie hitting that hang at 13:30 was just crazy this man is just a level above
we say this guy is primal peak but imgaine if he had to climb wall while running away or something xd
Seeing Eddie on the wall @ 8:32 is both impressive and hilarious
Eddie on the blue look like the bug in the corner of ny room😂😂😂
Hall vs wall
19:51 "Green, done. Orange, done. Blue, done." then the little extra head nod. Like "We're counting the blue yea?... Good man!"
Hearing him receive beta and go "Left hand!?" with complete incredulity I couldn't help but think "He's a natural" that was the most climber thing ever.
When Eddie hall says “we’re using this blue one” you just walk away from the wall 😂
I can’t imagine climbing without a belay at that size. When I was that size that was the main fear I had, it’s definitely an ankle breaker
My toxic trait is thinking i can do all this when i have zero climbing experience💀
"Spider-pig, Spider-pig"  🎶
This guy needs to feature in a Guy Ritchie movie.
8:25 The cut here is absolute comedy! 😭
Now all the fear of having the holds come off is gone. Thanks, Eddie!
Magnus saying its the "beta" instead of its the "Meta" was cringe 😭
Would love to see Magnus try climb with 100kg strapped to him!
I absolutely love that Eddie knows who Francis the Train guy is.🥰❤
You don't realize how crazy it is for his size to be moving like that. Eddie is so athletic.
what a beast man. you can tell how hard it would be for someone his size and still he makes it look easy. damn
“Thatll be me in an hour”  *points at dude biffin it*
Neanderthal vs Homo Sapien
The video of his world record dead lift and getting a nose bleed was such a supersayan moment. Like holy hell what a superhuman!
15:18 hahaha
Magnus at 12:50 If you climb with a rope you climb up to 20m. Magnus just had him climb 30m outdoors.
25:19 You know, when you're laying in bed on your back with your phone in the air and then drop it on your face? This gave me so much anxiety lol
1:52 look closely and you will see a penis on the wall 😂😂
370lbs... That's REALLY impressive on Eddie's part! It's pretty awesome to see him do stuff like this. He looks extraordinary out of place. But surprisingly graceful at climbing, for a fridge sized man.
6:27 telling Eddie Hall that he's "stronger than you think" is something else xdd
"Oh you Slag!" 😀Eddie's comical British Swearing is top tier.
He's cheating, he's not climbing himself up he's  pulling the earth around him
Get yerself over to Scotland and try doing the "Dinnie Stones" 👍😘🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿
It's funny how watching these vids makes my hands start sweating 🤣
I see no EGO here
His calf muscles are absurd at 8:09
Eddie has the friendliest smile I’ve ever seen on a bloke so big - it was genuinely endearing to watch him have so much fun 😊
He can lift rocks but can rocks lift him, that is the question.
😂 allegedly ‼️‼️‼️‼️
4:10 That's Eddie xD
Eddie always lies about his weight
Ive seen him around other channels but Eddie brought me here, but Magnus pulling 500+ lbs on that Row machine made me stay and subscribe, now I’m watching everything one by one to help views. I’ve worked with my hands my entire life, and completely agree with Magnus about grippers. You need large hands to get enough leverage on them to squeeze best. I have a lot stronger hands vs people I work with but they can put better numbers up because of sheer size alone.
awesome both, juhaptergee
Spider pig, spider pig, does whatever a spider pig does
EH  failing on blue is still amazing.
EH on orange!
"you're stronger than you think" he said the the worlds strongest man
respect to eddie hall the determination he displays in everything that he does is simply amazing
0:44 does anyone know the TV Show? I'm from germany and I would really like to know
Imagine you pull up to the climbing gym and see Eddie
When it cuts that’s just funny how eddie is on the wall 8:27
yall are good together honestly love both your channels but your collabs are always awesome
wow eddies real good at this
Fun fact on the no leg thing: one of the best pilots the UK ever had was a double amputee who lost both legs. Originally they wouldn’t let him fly, but after 10 years of fighting and WW2 kicking off they let him in. Once there, he was able to pull off maneuvers no other pilot could because when the Gforce kicks in all the blood leaves your head and rushes to your legs causing blackouts. For someone with no legs, the blood had no where to go therefore he was able to stay conscious longer during the maneuvers and pilot his plane in a way no other pilot could match.
Eddie isn't actually climbing. He's pulling the wall down.
when he said im pissing in the wind magnus actually checked
He is probably lifting 50kg with every pull!
Ok this is absolutely inspiring. I'm a much bigger guy and I've been having fun with bouldering but seeing one of the biggest, fittest guys on the planet not instantly getting this perfect is actually encouraging to see. Goddam love Eddie Hall what a guy!
Respect to both, but wow that shot at the beginning you stood next to each other. You're both clearly very strong dudes, but he makes you look like a tiny noodle! Crazy.
8:10 look at his quads and calf’s
This was so fun to watch! 😂😂 he  doesn’t back up, I like the spirit
can u do a world's strongest rock vs man climbing?
170kg, worlds strongest man, casually climbing up walls, I'd be shitting myself 😂
I think Eddie would have done lot better with one size smaller shoes
For a second I thought “shit man I could do that route Easily even though I’ve only been close climbing a handful of times. Then I saw how insane that reverse incline was. Eddie is a beast. Weighs 100kg more than me but 1000x as strong.
Magnus vs Eddie: My Dreams vs My reality
Iv started climbing week 2 , and iv learnt so much from just listening and watching . Great video
just two genuine humans having a great time hanging out and working on their skills
NDL
well didnt expected that :))
Eddie is so coachable. You can see him implementing so much of what Magnus says. It’s impressive
I love eddies personality for someone being so famous he has no ego and is a genuine lad i would love to learn socialising from
13:40 so the strongest man in the world defies physics
I have really enjoyed these videos with Eddie, especially the most recent one outside. Always a good laugh
You know they put a man on the moon right🤣🤣🤣
Is this in London?
Respect to the old guy at 6:44.
Well done Eddie, nice try and an fantastic sporting attitude. You are the sportsman that everyone should aspire to be like.
Eddie's fear is very valid tho.. at that weight doubting they can actually hold you is very fair
man so much happend in the jumpcut 8:27 to 8:28
Eddie is so cute
It's about the legs and about the brain, too: the better you can visualize your way, the less energy you need.
the word you are looking for is not "beta", "beta" outside of the "alpha/beta/sigma" meaning is basically like a prototype/test version of a product usually software. the word you want to represent a common method used is "meta"
Dang, watching a 375lb man climb is insane. 99% of people that heavy wouldn’t be able to do this at all. His muscle mass is crazy.
I love how natural Magnus is with all the different guests he has on. This was a great collaboration. Magnus is a real one.
I wish I was so jacked I could say: "Yea man I can only climb V3 max because I'm so massive and strong"
Umm is it just me or watching a huge and strong guy like Eddie ALSO being athletic as fuck and doing better than most of the new climbers scary as fuck?! Like I don't think the world is ready for athletic, bodybuilder eddie
I’m really impressed by Eddies flexibility
Seeing Mr. Hall doing this really helps to motivate me to do as much as I can despite my weight and health problems.
For a very big man, he looks genuinely quite graceful.
Fair play to the big guy. Brilliant.
17:29 Most relatable part of the video. When you’re fully pumped for the day haha
here after the new video where Eddie climbed outdoors.
Its so interesting to see the difference in climbing technique, magnus is really effortless campusing. Eddie has to use momentum - which is great to see because as a 5ft 4 pear shaped, bottom heavy, woman, using momentum is my entire identiy in climbing
magnus has no chill. like okay we get it we put a man on the moon XD he's so god damn awkward i cant tell if its who he is as a person or if its just a language barrier. Smile. its the one thing that stops me from loving this channel. its always so awkward
What rope and harness would you put Eddie on?
Insane that a man this heavy is this good on his first try. Good on him.
"That's gonna be me in about an hrs time"  dude falls
second strongest....second. thor beat eddie we all know that
8:20 is that a rock in his leg?
hard climb? easy! but having to use the starting hold….
Never would have guessed these two even knew each other. They probably both know Vladimir Shmondenko too.
great collab, they even have Linus from LTT filming 16:20
I love seeing athletes try other sports and supporting each other❤
I can’t believe Eddie is that totally fit. Magnus seemed blown away how he could do it. But the lack of ego and mutual respect between athletes is amazing
Great video! - Your sound is peaking so much though, ask your editor to give it quick mix in future?
That was a fun watch
I See Eddie, i like the Video.   Its that Easy :D
Eddie halls a gobshite !!!!!
Awesome
Semi vs dragster
I lost it when he started singing  spiderpig. 5:04
Dude was the best in the world at something and super humble when learning a new skill.  He's got so many things he's got to worry about due to his size and still is willing to try new stuff.  Super cool
i find it so incredibly impressive when big guys like that climb a wall.... im barely 80kg and im so much worse than him at climbing xD
*Eddie does not climb the wall.*  *He lifts it.*
Imagine if bro goes full bodybuilder and starts rock climbing as a hobby, if he did ufc then bro would be the ultimate bro
Bro im seeing eddie hall everywhere now, bro is on the sidequest grind
Why is Magnus telling the beginner 300lb guy not to use the downclimb hold 8:53 ??
"You're stronger than you think" to the world's strongest man
wearing shoes 2 sizes smaller is wild.  that's gonna mess up your feet long term lol
Eddie is the most British man ever
Grip test?
Imagine a dude like eddie in the gym being like “aye mate im bout to do that blue” 🗿  Me: 👀 🎥 ight bro
Imfbeeepingpressive!
Great video. love to see top athletes out of their comfort zone trying new sports together. Eddie killed it! And Magnus was a great guide.
It is all in good fun and laughs. What the beast did was pure willpower. I have climbed indoors. I know how hard it is. I remember Steinar Hoen.. High jumper. He was asked if he could get stronger. He's reply was. "yes, but it is muscle mass vs weight ratio.. " so I can get stronger.. but not without gaining weight.
😂😂😂 he actually told Eddie the fucking beast hall that he's actually stronger than he thinks 😂😂😂 ok that made me giggle
I love watching Eddie Hall do anything, he's just a funny, entertaining guy all around. And he gives everything his all.
Nah. Have you every seen Mariusz Pudzianowski forme poland?
There's something seriously wrong with Eddie Hall. Sniffing items after females is bizarre! It's not even funny, and he's a danger to all females.
The bigger they are the harder they Hall.
Somehow have seen loads of videos with Eddie in them. Not into body building, strong man or anything like that but I love the respect and reverence he gives other disciplines. Proper sportsman
I like how well behaved Eddie can be when he is not a dickhead
This is the most fun I’ve had watching a YT video in a long time. Well done.
its really cute how Eddie got his wedding ring tatted on since he doesn't lift with rings
Eddie pissed on anyone else his size lets have ut right. little german is a good teacher.
"You´re stronger than you think" really?
I smiled all the way through this
Hey, next door to my local screwfix
That guy magnus mentions who sat in a wheel chair for two weeks to lose mass in their legs must have been mentally decrepit. Intentionally allowing muscle wastage in your legs so they weigh less is proper retarded. In those two weeks they could have just trained harder to strengthened their arms/upper body.   Reminds me of peoplw eating tape worm larvae to lose weight, albeit nowhere near as stupid.
Spiderman teaching the hulk to climb better:
imagine if Eddie would be hydrated
19:12 bro look at his calf here
I properly like this dude
Dude has humility. Charismatic. He's the highest performer in another domain, comes over here and goes straight to the humble new guy. More than that; poking fun of himself and all. Really like it.
but you neeed to explain him how to use the legs and the weight to his advantage
He is Very funny haha
This was sick
For anyone curious, the world record weight for the Turkish Get Up at the end is 76.56 kg or 168lbs + 8 oz.
Eddie pointed at a guy an said "thats gonna be me" and the guy imediately fell.
"next one is a good hold dw,next one is good"
What a character!
Много добре, момчета, честно сте подходили. Само това турското упражнение накрая - някой лесно може да умре на него, ако си изпусне пудовката на главата или сърцето.
3:12 those calves are crazy!
WSM aside this the most impressed I have been by Eddie since I saw him swimming.
19:54 "blue done"... *right buddy?*
bodybuilders dont think about when they have to lift their own selves
Hey Magnus, you would probably be the one to ask. My friend says he saw a video of someone climbing a wall without any holds. They were just grabbing the wall. When I asked him to show me the video, he wasn't able to find it. Do you think it's possible?
should do this again a year on
I love watching Eddie pick up the weight like it’s nothing then having Magnus come in and go “that’s heavier than he makes it look”
when i forget this man has like 200 kilos of strength in each arm: "must be hard when you're that big..."
You know what, guys? I bought this ~12th century house with romanesque vaults. Thanks for an inspiration.
How to be the best climber EDDIE: Just cut your legs off. Love this guy said it as soon as it hit his brain ❤
Hog Rider
😂”we’ll just edit that out” 🤣🤣💀 “he definitely dabbed a few times, but I didn’t have the balls to tell him. He’s intimidating “ this whole episode is so cute. Eddie seems so playful and full of joy.
bro looks like a legit gorilla climbing
I have to admit I cracked up when Eddie points at the guy and says I want to be like him and then goes that will be me in literally an hours time as he falls off the wall
This youtuber is mad awkward
Ed is a literal beast!
er du dansker Magnus?
I was not expecting him to be able to overcome the sheer mechanics of his body mass. That was incredible!
Man is over 300 lbs that is crazy.
Didn't see this collab coming 😂
I love how he said he's "retired" into body building. As if every body builder considered their discipline "retiring". lmfao
Eddie doesn't climb the mountain, the mountain climbs Eddie ! Ba dum tsh
Watch out King Charles! 😂
what a stud.  The dexterity of the big man is legit.
First time I went to a climbing gym i spent 2 hours there, it opened my mind to climbing and wrecked my body.  Really would've liked wider shoes for my bottom grabbers tho..
Shocking how nimble Eddie is for his size.
Eddie singing "spider pig" is amazing and I loved it. These are two great dudes and insanely capable men.
That t shirt beast cant suit anyone better 😅
I know he's a fierce competitor in his sport but he didn't show a lot of determination in this video. Kinda crazy. Also shows how difficult climbing is, endurance-wise
Well Magnus, you always say you are not a good coach because you can’t explain what you do but this is really good coaching! And fun too!  Also fun that you call the way to do it “beta” and not “meta” like in a video game 😅❤
You should try inviting some professional fighters and see how their sport and body conditioning can translate to climbing
I've been watching over Magnus's videos for a few days now, and seen him introduce a lot of people who are known for strength into climbing, but Eddie is the first one who came in, said "There's no way I can do that one" and then just one-shot the Green. You can see the pure determination he has when he starts, it's like all of those complicated and self-defeating thoughts just fly away and he's in that same zone that lets him be such an absolute monster in other regards.
8:30 I love the shot of Eddie struggling and Magnus just hopping up to point out the hold XD (yes obviously skill/strength *type* difference and he's using mixed holds, but I still find it funny)
Climbing has always been an interest of mine, and I know I have a good body for it as well. 6ft 3in (1.9m), 150 lbs (68kg) and an 11in (28cm) handspan. I really just need to get out and do it now.
It’s honestly a beautiful thing to see he is truly a beast
Eddie has the physical proportions of a fantasy dwarf, but two feet taller, lol.
That shows how strong a gorilla is a gorilla can bench 4000 itpounds and dead lift 5000
I swore magnus said 'come on daddy'
Eddie hall is the best, super funny and still super humble. What a gent
Really impressive, when you consider that he's got twice the mass pulling on his grip, which is about the same size as Magnus'. Coming off the wall would be intense! When you're that big, hitting the mats is hard on the feet and legs. Well done Eddie!
where is this. it looks like so much fun. i love rock climbing
Get Sam Sullek next!
Absolute respect bud, that's alot of load to get up any climb!!! 👍
The irony of telling the worlds strongest man ever, "You're stronger than you think you are!" XD
Eddie just really shows us that if you are one of the strongest human beings in the world, you have no use for an ego anymore.
Imagine trying to hold Eddie on a big whipper. You'd be in danger of getting pulled through the first clip 😂
Magnus visit eddie at the gym would be interesting video.
Pretty good stuff, I just realized that Mario updated his favorite way to tackle ED and it's crazy! Although what he previously talked about was pretty decent, it was difficult to follow, I just go'ogled the latest in Mario's Thunderous Erections, it's so much simpler and potent now!
Thank you a ton for having captions on this video! It shows when a creator cares about accessibility.
Honey badger doesn’t care!😊🦡
I never Sean a Bulldog clime like that.
4:30 “the things people do to win a gold medal” as if he wasnt so dedicated to his lifts that he worked with a psychiatrist to put himself in a mental state where he was lifting a car of his kids😂
Eddie is the embodiment of a gentle giant. Love the guy.
Magnus, you should do a video where you wear an extra 100kg to see what it would be like to climb with Eddie's weight
i love how Eddie used the padded machine next to him to help him get up on the last dumbbell on the Turkish getups 😂😂
v1...
Them side by side on the wall at 8:42 is crazy. Eddie makes Magnus look tiny.
you got the view because of Eddie and the subscribe because the way you presented yourself thank you.
He done pretty well
So interesting to see the upper echelons of these two sports that are both "all-around functional" in their own way, and how specialized they are at their extremes.
“You’re stronger than you think”  Magnus to the strongest man in the world.
He needs better shoes. Man, he's crazy powerful.
whenever eddie feels hard it's always "fucking hell"🤣
I love that he wanted to do weights at the end to give Eddie a chance to shine!
"No smelling salts?" 😂😂😂
Surely they could have started with a vertical wall instead of an inverted 😆
I can’t stop looking at Edie’s calf’s. There huge!
World strongest Man ar Pudzianowski stronger then Tiny uk
"...biggest man..." now talk to his buddy Brian Shaw :-)
The bigger you are, the harder it is to pull your own weight
Is it mean of Eddie to tell that climber "we are just on here mate" instead of waiting for him to climb first? I know they are filming a video but it felt a little bullying to me. I don't mean to feel this way as I have respect for Magnus and Eddie but I couldn't shake the feeing of Eddie dominating the guy simply because he knows he easily can. I would have just loved it if the climber Eddie was talking to replied with "well you're not on here though are you? I am atm, so I'm gonna climb it and then I'll move"
Climber graffiti removal project, full steam ahead❤️
Would be interesting to see how well magnus could climb with 100kg weights attached. Remember, they put a man on the moon! :D
Those fucking calves on him omg!!
Shout out to Francis the train guy
Just spreading the news here! Jesus is the only way! Jesus is coming / rapture soon!!!  jacobs troubles is coming ( Israel formally declares war against Hamas ) If we Christians disappear soon, Your know the Lord has taken us Home!  Now we need prayed for the Jews and to get many people saved as possible    Romans 10:9-13 KJV  that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
8:20 look at his fucking legs
only uses salts if he's going to knock the wall over
He is very teachable! I like that!!! ❤
If king kong was a man
Totally different type of strength. Interesting to see the application
Eddie's back is like a wall, a V17 wall.
it's heavy to be heavy
I'm now convinced that I'm stronger than the strongest man in the world
The “ya know they put a man on the moon” callback got me every time
Watching Eddie 10ft up the wall was amazing.
18:23 unnecessary Eddie, you left the wall to record something else
There are two types of strength. Ones who can lift incredible amounts of weight but can't lift themselves, and ones who can't lift incredible amounts of weight, but can lift themselves and have incredible grip. Strongman vs a bar man.
Eddie, nobody is fit at 170 kg 😂
That’s impressive considering he’s 170 kg
When you are that heavy, you need to strengthen the fingers to match!
A diet swap for a day or two would be fun to watch! :)
so hillarious to see magnus just casually stand on the wall and eddie fighting for his life at 8:40
This is cool, reminds me of the tree climbing episode where Magnus kept surprising himself with the next feat he could do
170 kg 😲
His hands are bigger than my feet
Hey that wright lifter dude was real cool 💪
Hey that wright lifter dude was real cool 💪
Whoa, this guy is cool. Seems like guys/gals who are accomplished in life are usually easy-going.
Eddie seems like a decent bloke
Honestly his forearm wasn't that much bigger 🤣
Seeing a man that big climb as well as he did just felt extremely unnatural.  Good job Eddie 🎉
Magnus it looks like you like playing mind games lmao
Guy is a beast.. lol " get the fuck out the way " lmao I wish Dave was a bigger guy and could body these haters.
Who tf brought rhino from Spiderman here
Magnus should put on 100kg vest and see how hard it is on the fingers lol
Irl king kong
Puzzle
For someone Eddies size it was super amazing to see how he performed. Mad respect to Eddie 🫡
I met Eddie at Target last Winter!!! Such a nice, humble guy.
Eddie seems like such a huggable nice person
If only eddlie had been hydrated
Edie is a fit guy😅
"You are stronger than you think" - Magnus to the world strongest man
Great video. Totally relate to the pumped feeling after doing climbing for the first time. Struggled to open my car door when I was done 😂
Jesus Loves you all very much!!!! God Bless everyone!!!!
8:22 bros calf is literally a brick
make the climber wear a backpack rgat would make weigh as much as the beast lol
"spider pig, spider pig..." hahaha, but seriously is anyone else a little concern if the mat can absorb the fall of a 170kg spider pig?
I like how literally the last video I watched he was talking about how much leg strength is way more important, and then in this one he climbs without even using his legs
Magnus is evil for making Eddie do an overhang 😂
the spider pig got me cracking!!!!
"im a fit guy" - mmmm kinda.
that hand shake at the end, what a size difference hahahaha
Wow seeing a 170kg guy doing this is almost even more impressive than seeing him lift 500kg 😮 if he magically lost 100kg he'd be able to climb using only his index fingers 😅
Bro's climbing while being 170kg 👁️👄👁️
8:35 Magnus Mountaingoat
To give Magnus an idea of how different it is for Eddie to climb. Magnus should do another video for Eddie carrying 20 bags of 7.5kg potatoes while climbing. 😂
Eddie “ better off chopping your legs off “ 😂😂😂😂😂😂
funny - spider pig lol
In Europe it was 9 one finger pull-ups but in the US it was only like 7.
I just love the BEAST !,,,
I don't see Mitchell Hooper.
I’m really impressed that’s super cool Eddie is awesome
hei
Eddie Hall is the man; dude is solid joy.
Eddie puts such a great face on the lifting scene. Hands down my favouite athlete of all time. Loads of empathy, modest, no shame and my sense of humor. Gets a good laugh at getting made fun of and can shoot em back too. Thanks for having him!
Never seen anyone hold the kettlebell like that doing a Turkish get up. Fine if you're the strongest man in the world but for the rest of us scrawny peasants we hold it normally. FYI
"What do you think?" "I mean they put a man on the moon!"  Holy shit this cracked me up.
How does magnus have followers while having no charisma or personality at all. So bad. You can tell eddie is trying to have fun and magnus just ruins everything
Imagine having to climb away from Eddie hall …
The drop down at 5:07 made my knees hurt lol
6:27 Telling the world's strongest man "you're stronger than you think."
6:22 telling eddie hall "You are stronger than you think!" cracked me up 🤣🤣
Wow.. I think I'm in love with rock climbing.. I love climbing, but never tried truly climbing in a professional way.   If you have lessons, I'll see if I can find them.. I wanna join you and see how my level is like.. wow.  Lovin it!😂❤
"You're stronger than you think" to the strongest man in the world 😂
I have got to try those Turkish get ups, that's awesome
magnus is brave standing underneath him haha youd get flattened if he came off on top of ya  also i wanna see magnus climb with an extra 100 kilo vest on haha
6:26 you are stronger then you think.....😅😆
I enjoyed watching this so much! At first i thought Magnus was being somewhat cold, but then i realized he was just intimidated by such a huge guy Eddie is, haha, even though Eddie was such a great sport! Great dynamic, especially towards the end!  Great video Magnus, and great fun Eddie.
Ich mochte es wirklich
in 1969 thy put a man on the moon, then 30 sc later; allegedly.
Imagine just going climbing and u look around and u just see magnus midtbo and eddie hall
Bro eddie is actually surprising for his size
great guy, amazing that he agreed to this.
Hey magnus you probably have a lot of training equipment but I made rings and switch it grips out of wood for you I'm working on a hang board but how can I send it to you?
🤣you're stronger than you think 6:27
in what universe is Eddie Hall still considered "the strongest man in the world"??
Eddie climbing reminds me of when big characters climb in Dragon's Dogma (that's a compliment. He could totally climb a Cyclops.)
"Last time i climbed a tree i broke my arm, so lets just touch wood." - Eddie Hall 2023
5:41 Magnus actually thinking whats about to happen if our Beast will fall.
it's okay even if he can't climb it he can just carry the wall
"Biggest man I've ever climbed with, and I don't mean only in size"  okay but what did he mean by this?
i hope in my life im able to see you two. you guys are amazing humans
I imagine the employees who set the routes just cringing every time Eddie hangs his weight on a hold. Lol
Worlds “Heaviest” Man Edward Hallsworth
8:40 " I'm pissin' in the wind here, mate! " legend hahah
The world's strongest man is mitchell hooper
Awsome :D n
I really like his explosive technique when changing grip.
He's climbing very well... look at those perfect deadpoints.
I always thought it was meta instead of beta! Funny!
its wierd im not interested in rock climbing at all but everytime I get drawn into one of these videos and just like hey i'll check it out for a minute I end up dropping everything I was doing in my video game and just watching the whole video,  You are very interesting to watch.
that turkish get-up thing seems super dangerous, one slip and you bash your face in
It cant be good for the knees jumping down when you are as heavy as eddie, or?
For a total beginner who’s that heavy he did super well
Considering it’s totally different disciplines for such a heavy man he is still really good
This is so badass! Eddie really was a great guest for the channel
Eddie Hall doesn't need to climb the rock.   He'll just pick it up, flip it 180, and touch the summit.
its actually insane how magnus makes these climbs look effortless
1:46 lol
I reckon Eddie would give anything a go. If you asked him to try juggling on a unicycle I think he’d be up for it.
12:00 Not them knowing the Omegaverse 😂😂😂
The Turkish getup challenge at the end is funny. Going for it after seeing you guys
What a great crossover. Eddie is so fun in any video he’s in and Magnus is such a kind soul
eddie hall is actually so funny
1:45 why do those holds look like... well you know
4:04 1:49 11:58
ITS MR BEAST
The specialization of muscle groups. Same reason body builders cannot fight fighters half their size.
I love the climbing community man. Just great people every time
I absolutely love the banter between these two
He belongs on stage with Sabaton. No clue of his role,  but he belongs there. 😂
Eddie is so cool man
I'd love to see them bring in someone from the regions where they live in the rainforest and spend a lot of time climbing so their feet look more like hands. Would be interesting to see how their skills would translate to the wall
i was waiting for the building to fall in eddies direction
man these pro climbers' forearm and shoulder strength are insane...
Eddie is completely arrogant without even trying
A+ for family guy reference
Magnus looks like the king of the Netherlands
Why does magnus feel like the embodiment of the climbing community he is so nice and supportive to anyone and wants people to try climbing not to prove to them that he is better.
thats a big boy holding and shifting a lot of wieght above the ground, props to him for trying his best and actually committing to it.
I thought this would be easy, this looks so hard but super fun!
I did not expect this to be so wholesome!
I love the way he coached Eddie through the climbs he’s extremely good at expressing the importance without putting pressure on
both climbers are insanely impressive
Look at Eddie's SOLID left calf at 8:11 😮
Not the worlds strongest man
His leg muscles are CRAZY!!!! 😳
8:10 Look at the definition in his calf muscle. WHAT ON EARTH. I didn't realize calves could even look like that.
“I’m doin forearms and calf’s today bro “
He’s more than double the weight of most climbers lol. Crazy
Eddie. how awesome.💪💪
@6:27 saying "you're stronger than you think" to Eddie, you absolute shit stirrer
Two of my favorite youtubers, I absolutely love this
How’s he done that then 😂 . What a guy
i got a magnus advert while watching this
the rocks just hit a new pr
Why is Magnus going to different games other than chess bruh
I wonder what would happen if he invited a professional stage rigger to try rock climbing for the first time; I think it would be interesting!
So, if you ever get on the bad side of the strongest man in the world. Just climb a tree
Eddie Hall makes me love Brits
22:02 his face XD this video was awesome, the dynamic between both was just👌mwa
So impressed how good he did being that big and first time! He's used to pushing himself. Realized I need a climbing coach at the gym!
Imagine telling the worlds strongest man: "you're stronger than you think"
Prime example of two people choosing very different tech trees.
HOLY SHIT! That blue from the ground, he pulled himself up no problem. What a legend
Dang dood, I was mad impressed with Eddie nailing that second green one. That was a tough climb for a big guy
magnus you are so fucking akward
Climbing is extremely difficult. As a small guy, i was able to climb naturally with more ease than bigger guys but i have only climbed a handful of times. To see eddie do ANY of these routes is amazing. That guy is huge.
Crazy how different the muscles are
The heaviest single repetition Turkish get-up is 76.56 kg (168 lb 8 oz)
he is so big, there is genuine concern that he can rip the hold out of the wall
eddie is so handsome :D
15:15 that is a high fall. Fuck me. 20:30 "that's what a 180 kg weight does" I like his fair responses. As much as they can be, when nature's unfair. 22:00 wow, the progression for the core is crazy, holy fuck. 24:23 "just remember they put a man on the moon" 🤣🤣.
You lot are superhuman!!!
Eddie Hall seems so friendly. Also he did way better on the blue than I expected, carrying 170kg up those climbs is wild. Its like a Meteor whenever he comes off the wall XD
The back slant walls and hard, need a lot of grip strength
No legs,.just hands..so crazy..and Eddie is such good sport too
This is honestly such a great display of just how differently built two top athletes can be, simply because of their respective focus.
Nice one Eddie! Love both your channels. Fun to see  a top athlete in a different sport.
I couldn't even get on the wall if I was that weight. Probably couldn't even walk properly. Mad props to Eddie for giving this his all and also props to magnus for teaching and encouraging him
Ediie tacking other sports is great. Its awesome to see how pure strength does or does not translate into other sports
Magnus literally looks like a child in comparison
Okay, I climbed a tall rock when I was a teenager.
Those limbs are carrying 170kg
Lesson of today : vikings weren't made for climbing
Made me chuckle when Eddie was climbing up the orange holds and it cuts to you just chilling there, hanging off the wall telling him where to go next 😂
@Magnus Midtbø Get some iq man. He is not the world's strongest man anymore. He is the world's strongest man of 2017.
eddieeeeeeee! :D  i just recently found and was watching *his* channel actually. so personable! good advice, too. yesterday i saw the one where he talked about how he started in weightlifting, as an aside. so good. so interesting!
Everybody missed the joke at 4:12. "if you want to be the best climber in the world, you're probably best chopping your legs off" ahahaha, guys, Eddie is a stand up comedian.
This sport seems best for thin lean people
Just checked for fun, the world record for turkish getup is 76kg, but it was done with a dumbbell with plates on it seems, not a kettlebell or anything else with a round grip that needs to be balanced as you move. I still think its really impressive, but I dont think it should count as the same exercise when the entire load goes straight down into your bone structure instead of having to constantly be balanced by your wrist and forearm.
Those calves are absolutely massive. They have their own biceps.
Eddie is pretty much climbing with a 250lb vest on, mad fuckin props he did amazing
Mr Hall is such a geniune and funny lad, I always laugh when he makes an appearance 😂
A kilogram is about 2.2 pounds, so 170 kilos is almost 375 pounds.
d
There is a pattern to the Turkish get up that makes it safer and easier. and he let you do it in a way that is harder and more dangerous that he himself would not do..
Props to Eddie for his humility, fortitude and being so nice about the trainspotting guy, who as Eddie says is a sweet guy. 👍
What was the bottle of liquid Eddie was using?
14:31
@2:53 that calf has more muscle than my entire body fml
I love Eddie; humble as fuck and still very wholesome.
Eddie is such a great guest! A real entertainer at heart.
i love these intersections of different fitness focuses
how are his calves sharp
I just clapped Eddie getting up the orange...great trainer
That climb Eddie did on the blue holds, highly impressive for a man of his size. What a guy he is.
I could relate when at the end of the first climb as he's hanging there he said "what now????".  😱
Eddie Hall what a Badass and all round to northerner. I’ve never seen a bloke built like that crush so so hard. Your strength is impressive, I applaud you sir 👏👏
God damn Eddie was awesome here, this is the show of true strenght right there
Eddies calf at 8:10 is absolutely mental
Spider Pig 😂, Simpsons Movie
Weight is everything when you climb. I really thought he would struggle more.
whys he putting on that English accent
no matter how often i hear it, eddie singing spider pig always makes me laugh.
After my life started to go downhill I moved in with my dad and he showed me “The Wondrous World of Rock Climbing” it was a real escape and taught me that failure is ok as long as you keep getting up. I found out after a while that he also watched Magnus and it was a real way for he and I to bond since he hadn’t been in my life until then. I ended up leaving because he fell back into his egotistical ways. But I miss climbing with him and climbing in general. I can’t do it anymore because I don’t have the money or shoes or chalk. And memberships ain’t cheap. I just thought I’d let ya know how much you impacted my life, Magnus. I wish I could keep climbing but watching these helps.
I have to say I didn't really like Eddie Hall prior to watching this video, but after 1 minute and 19 seconds my dislike turned into hatred.
Cant climb rock? Cary it
Very heartwarming, just two legends sharing a good time, no ego involved
Watching a man that big climb a wall like that is absolutely hilarious 😂
eddie with all his weight....really impressive how he does those climbs
what a chunky man. this sport really aint for that body type
I'd struggle to do turkish getups with 0KG
I would love to see you do this with other strongmen like Brian Shaw, Martins Licins, and Hafthor. Would also REALLY love to see you become a grip competitor on the side! You have a truly absurd level of strength, Magnus, so you could do extraordinary things in that field, too!
I used to enjoy "worlds strongest man" competition shows.  I think it would be cool if they added in some light climbing (like the occasional cardio-heavy event) to give some advantage to the generalists over the specialists.
Eddie Hall is becoming my favorite strength athlete, this channel is great!
Dude is so massive he’s got his own gravitational pull
You can see how hard it is for Eddie to hold his arms straight up because of his muscles. He is impressive.
Its not the world strongest man anymore....
Eddie is a funny guy..
This big lard thinks the video is all about him when Magnus is a world class climber.  Magnus definitvely has a lot of tact and humility to handle such an obnoxious joe.  I bet that if he stops training for one month he'd looks undistinguishable from a regular fat lard. There's no definition in his body it looks all built around main muscles.
haha Eddie is such a charming guy
Okay but Eddie climbing at almost 400 pounds is bonkers. Like imagine being a normal sized human, and climbing up a wall with lebron james on your back, that’s what it’s like for Eddie weight wise…
my guy said you're stronger than you think v:  bruhh
The heaviest single repetition Turkish get-up is 76.56 kg (168 lb 8 oz), and was achieved by Chris Cox. That is insane!
Look like kratos climbing mount olympus
magnus is a terrible teacher omg i was getting so aggravated at him not reminded him of techniques or telling him how to rest properly when he's clearly over extering himself on the wall and relying too much on power and t-rexing instead of extending, its such as easy fix and he didnt tell him to adjust?? why did it take 3/4th into the video to hear 'hips to the wall'?
This made me feel so much better abouty frame. Unreal
The man on the moon bit is fucking good
weird energy from magnus in this one
Oh man, I love eddy hes such a good guy
19:50 yeah no doubt, the little nod eddie does when he said "blue.. *done* " i wouldn't correct him either 😅🤣
Haha I love his enthusiasm  But when a guy says I'll use one hand u use two  That's when u know ur done  Hehe
Come on Eddie  He is literally half the size of u  I know u r very strong but this is more about the technique u have  Rather then brutal strength  Eddie lol
"The things people do to win" Eddie that is gonna be your famous last words  U did things to win ?? They is a reason u only won 1 competition:)  :)
Eddie's face at 22:50 XD
Will you be climbing more often from when this video was recorded onwards?
I live really close to eddie cause one of my mates is mates with him
fair play eddie you tried hard and that guy is a good coach/teacher just blame the man on the moon
Well done Eddie makes me want to try it myself
Dude I loved this vid
LOL Magnus really said "youre stronger than you think" to Eddie.
I see that you are both having to abide by the "shirts on" policy of climbing hanger 😞 Lucky it doesn't seem to be a very hot day, I don't get this policy though, it's very annoying on a hot day!
Truly a beast.
nooks and crannies= little fiddly bits
There is nothing on the moon They put nothing !and they cant !
If Behemoths get the ability to climb then RPGs gonna be insane lol
Is it just my filthy brain or do several of the grey holds look like ccok and blals? And Eddie is gripping the shaft hahahahahahaha
Well done Eddie!
When the fighter tank and the rogue hang out in D&D.
eddi likes to get his way and often in videos you can see him try force his way occasionally. kind of unfortunate that's his character but with all that testosterone its not so bad
If Eddie lost 200 lbs (~90kg), I would not be surprised if he could do V12/V13. The guy weighs 350 lbs+ (158 kg+)  so this is insanely impressive.
I'm so glad l subscribed!
Turkish getup looks like a bad head injury for my clumsy arse
He will be able to do it, it's a matter of practice and consistency. It might take a lot longer for a person his weight, but he'll be able to do it
My 100kg 190ishcm self  struggles with climbing after not doing it for years😂  Eddie is a beast.   But Magnus my gawd. 😂   Most climbers I know are about 40-50kgs so at 70 he is so much heavier than most but still freaking awesome.
Eddie is awesome person! <3
Can tell Magnus is a little bit scared of Eddie.
for a guy of eddies size this must be incredibly exhausting, eddie the goat
No, he's going to do sumo wrestling.
So you have never climbed and you weigh about 200kg? ok lets start with an overhang XD
NEW     TRAINING  IN  STRONGEST  MAN ?????
NO  NO   NO  ....LOL    Before im watching..
I love how magnus was impressed by Eddie saying his arms were pumped like it’s not a bodybuilding/weightlifting term
Huge video!! Loved every moment.
Good job Eddie!
dude the wedding ring tattoo so you can be smart about lifting is actually pretty damn smart
ay man apparently i missed out on alot of big magnus collabs
i love that he knows the train dude
I think he’s ready toFree Solo El Capitan.
So interesting to see a whole different skill set to do something else than what your used yo
eddie got kinda scammed by his shoes
I think Eddie are doing greate.
Basically ludirous ambition fo ra huge man. Better for the medium to small.
Zangief
Eddie scares me. I know he's athletic but the bigger they are, the harder they fall. I don't wana see his 350lbs blow through his knee on the way down.
7:30 wtf are smelling salts?
Walk into your climbing gym, Eddie Hall is doing turkish getups
06:26 I can't believe Magnus told the strongest man in the world that he is stronger than he thinks😂
When I climbed I had sandals clipped to my harness with a screw gate carabiner. If your climbing anything worthwhile your climbing shoes will be tight. Once your done though your feet want out!
Eddie is such a funny guy. He keeps things really light hearted and really tries. It's really interesting seeing how happy he is at trying something new.
I was like ''No way those tiny plastic rocks can hold his weight'' those little rocks things are stronger than the strongest man alive.
Some people are disappointed in Eddie when he is holding more than 150 kilograms with no issues
That's pulling 170kg up those walls ... the strength of this man is something out of this world. If I were that heavy, i would't be able to get on the simplest starting piece.
What a beast! haha.  Great job hitting it up like he did. Can't be easy at all at that size.
What an awesome guy Eddie is. Such a good sport.
How is it that a man who can deadlift over 500 kilos, and win so many amazing feats of strength, can't even lift his own body weight?
"That's literally going to be me, in about an hours time"... as the climber falls off the wall. 😅
If i were a actual mountain and Eddie would try to climb me, I'd move.
thats so incredibly impressive seeing such a big man on the wall like that, honestly didnt think you would do this good
He is best because Pudzianowski dont start :))
I bet Eddie could play striker in d premier League if he gave it s go
hearing him say yellow was difficult was kind of shooking as that is the easiest at my place (or so they say I am still a super newbie)
Damn Eddie I was pleasantly surprised!
Crazy, I'm shouting come on Eddie while watching a 4 month old yt video.
Magnus saying: "You're stronger than you think!" Poor Eddie, has the strongest lack of self-awereness in the world...  PS: It's just a joke, guys.
"Ive literally got more chance of shagging King Charles... in the ass" lmao never heard that one before
Magnus is such an impressive climber! Eddie being willing to attempt this sport is awesome too!
Imagine being there and just seeing Eddie 😂
Eddy actually has a very great sense of humor!
We need magnus in a armwrestling match
damn i live how goofy eddie is sometimes
Quality watch was this
Sick collab. Eddie killed it on the wall
I love you Eddie.
👏👏👏👏👏💪
Eddies calves at 8:18 are insane
Jehovah God the Father bless you through Lord Jesus the Anointed!
This was a lot of fun to watch, Magnus. You definitely need to get Brian Shaw to climb some too! haha Maybe you can meet up to lift with Eddie next time
Imagine you're running from a giant human and you climb a tree thinking you're safe but then he starts climbing too.
his calves are scary big
This was the wholesome 28mins I needed this evening, thanks.
When Eddie is hanging from a wall, he's carrying more than most peoples deadlift max.
0:40 I love the humbleness
It’s weird how a guy that could once upon a time deadlift half a tonne but struggles to pull himself up a wall 😂 this isn’t slander I’m a boulderer myself and it’s just interesting how the body works
He 100% the biggest man I have ever seen climbing like that  👏👏👏
I tried a kids climbing wall at the park and didn't do a fraction as well as this. Respect to Eddie.
This guy used to carry rocks for a living😭
er det sant at du er Norsk?
6:26 yep
So romantic 26:08 😍😍
It’s amazing to see the different strengths these two have!
That a abit duuude climbing! Amazing work! Bravo🎉
i love seeing these videos. It makes me more interested in learning to climb myself.
Crazy to think he's essentially carry an extra 100kg more than magnus - he is a lot stronger but gosh it must be harder to move that kind of mass on a climb
Eddie  is such an adventurous guy and has such a great personality that it's fun to watch him try new things! A must watch is his one pretending to be pregnant!😆
Damn Eddie is looking good now that he has “slimmed” down.
I’m here just shocked he wears his shoes 2 sizes to small LOL I got my size and I’m about to chop my foot off 🤣I’m only on day 3 of climbing though
It's so cool seeing Eddie do this lol.
This guy’s going to kill eddy with this😂
There is No one i know WHO IS more Info competition than Eddie, you Always Catch him with one
You know, im going for my second time rock climbing tomorrow and im glad I watched this. Gave me a tip at 7:20 which im gonna try and use. I want to get good, especially since I'm uploading the journey of it.
7:25
there is a reason why uncle eddi is a champion, and this is it
You don’t have to go to hell God made a way so you don’t have to. His will is that not any perish but that all come to repentance and everlasting life. He sent his son Jesus Christ he paid the price with his own life’s blood because he lived a sinless life died on the cross and rose from the dead three days later. He was the perfect sacrifice. He paid the price so we can have eternal life. He made it so simple to have everlasting life that people stumble over how easy it is all you have to do is. Repent and put your trust in him. Jesus Christ. So you can have eternal life. God Bless
It's really fun to watch you elite guys doing this, and so funny guys, great video!
Seeing a strength-build do dex-build activities is fun :D
Hats off to Eddie for being willing to have a go at this.
Eddy has used more energy in that moment than I have in my entire life.
Dude he's good like he doesn't look like he just started
I'm impressed with Eddie's climbing
17:55 I read "place your balls here"
Impressive for somebody of that weight.
Like watching king Kong climb the empire state building lol 💪🏻
He said I have a better chance Effing King Charles in the A. Hahahha
Something just doesn't work with having a British accent and being THE absolute unit
16:19 is that the filmer for TGF jamie?
Eddie is so likable it's mental. Smiled ear to ear through this this entire video :)
1:28 "that's gonna be me.. in an hour's time" **guy falls** 😂😂
All that muscle and can't climb a beginners wall, how pathetic. We are endurance creatures so anyone who thinks getting bulky is cool youre a f..kin idiot and was almost guaranteed to have been bullied as a kid
for a 370 lb dude he can climb damn good
Eddie is a hefty lad with limited flexibility. Im no climber, but looks like he did really well!
You could tell Magnus seemed nervous around big Eddie.
Imagine hiding up a tree and seeing an Eddie Hall climbing up after you
It’s impossible not to love Eddie! This guys is legendary!!!
That is a BIG man on a wall.
Steroids do wonders.
it was 2017 he  hasnt got that title now, for over 5 years, he is so out of condition  he cant even jump down 1.5 metres without falling over...this is embarrasing he clearly is carrying over 150 pounds..its killing him
eddie hall calling himself "fit"... strong? sure, jog to the mailbox? nope.
"This is going to be funny" That was bold of him to say! 😂😂
Amazing for such a huge man
Worlds strongest man goes rock climbing and become a moon landing conspiracy believer lol  Seriously, very fun video ))
Okay but they put a man on the moon
why climb the mountain when you can *BE* the mountain
His one hand is 50% of my chest...hmmm.
Spiderman vs The Hulk
Strength can mean so many different things. Like Running, swimming . . . for instance. The world's strongest man is like saying the best pizza in town.
"thats keen" ....giggles...
Love how Magnus told a World's Strongest Man "You're stronger than you think" 6:26
a couple of my favorite people! i wish i could see a climbing competition of magnus and alex honnold not exactly a competition on a route or anything but uhm... how do i say, more like a statics analysis like free hang, different grips, certain techniques and endurance. you've done what i'm talking about (magnus) with ole big boy  what's his name.  he's crazy curly long hair and he's a massive body builder...... damnit what's his name.. GOOGLE HELP ME!  JUUUUUUUJIIIIIII and someone else - it was you and two other guys (one being juji)  you should do something like that video but far more extreme and more catered to ELITE climbers, technique, strength, endurance, etc.  i'd LOVE to see that video broski
Something I really appreciate is the way that Eddie is impressed with Magnus. I like it because I’m a climber myself and my friends always like banter with me about it being easy. So then I took on of them and he’s a very built person who’s in the gym almost 24/7 and he got humbled real quick. It’s just nice to see climbers getting recognition!!!!
Climbing is one of those things that looks easier than it is. It is difficult and will get your entire body pumped within a few minutes. It is a great workout though and fun and satisfying when you get good at it.
Crazy impressive, but I am equally impressed with you guys putting chalk on your hands. If I have even the smallest amount of powder on my hands, or even just thinking about it or watching you both, makes my skin crawl. Biggest goosebumps.
Great video again, Magnus. Thanks for posting. Did I hear Eddie say 'I'm sweating my dick off' ? 🤣
08:20 Look at those marble legs!
He has a higher voice than you would imagine but to make up for it he is aggressively more English lol. Even called you a slag, what a compliment
so when eddie is on orange... and his trainer is up there with him... dude looks EFFORTLESSLY standing there while eddie is red in the face... i knew rockclimbers had insane grip... just nuts seeing him one arm hold that with just zero effort
Look at his fuckin calves 😧
It's like watching a gorilla climb a wall haha
it so funny to see someone half as big just scurry up a wall next to someone to point them to where to go
I love. U Eddie hall but u can't climb my. Daily my, 400 steps
6:27 s e n s a t i o n a l
You always drop the best videos without fail
I thought British people use lbs not kilos
Soooooo... People are supposed to grow out of climbing trees? I climbed a tree last week and I'm 39 haha
Eddie is a big boy, I don't blame him for being nervous about the holds :P
thats fkin impressive.
what a video :D Eddie did hella good, impressed!!
I’d love to see how many chin-ups he can do haha
crazy how eddies biggest enemy for climbing is his weight, the more inclined the wall was the more he was fighting his weight
probably cant even dip his own weight.
Eddie is like that panda on king fu panda put a cookie at the top he’d be up there in no time.
How many pull ups can you do?
What an unexpected but wonderful collab
Lessons learnt: professional climbers are Ghaishas when it comes down to the feet. PS: Pourple route looks like Boob-climbing. Should come naturarly. PPS: Climbing seems to be the really top-notch allrounder activity there is. Seeing strongest man have kind of beer belly like myself he's strong but only in special applications.
8:14 Jesus Christ look at that calf muscle
I saw worlds strongest man, then realized you were talking about Fat Eddie. No one likes that dude, he has a shit attitude.
Want my girl to be as happy to see me as Eddie was to see the chart
That's really impressive
Yeah Imagine if he had to escape from a natural disaster or just needing to climb to save your life. He’d be dead so quickly. What’s the point of being so big if it isn’t practical at all.
The calf muscle at 8:21
Am I the only one hearing Joe Rogan at 11:24?
I think Eddies shoes were a bit too loose (even for a beginner). Otherwise, great video!
such  fun episode!
Eddie did good
I like how Eddie is there not using flexiblity, not using swinging or great technic just pure raw strength
I can last 8 seconds
Such a huge frame climbing a wall doesn't look human like. Looks more bear like
I'm actually amazed the strongmen do as well as they do on this channel. Really cool dudes and wish they mentioned how heavy they are. That's gotta be rough!
You know what would be fun to watch? Magnus putting on a weight belt with as much extra weight as Eddie and then tired to climb 😁wonder if he would have managed that challenge
I absolutely love the archetype of the "gentle giant", and to see the sweetest person ever also being the strongest man on earth is just so wholesome  Great content! Thank you very much
11:52 the term you're looking for is META, not BETA. You show him the META way, or basically the best/textbook possible way to do it.
Magnus to Eddie: You are stronger than you think. Eddie:: I know I should have gone for 505kg
I'm sorry but the nurse at the ice rink was just a karen, IT'S A DAMN SURFBOARD NOT A BOMB!
Something about the awkwardness of Eddie learning how to climb makes this hilarious 😂
damn big guy would be an elite climber if he didnt decide to get big for lifting the big stuff lol
damn you could see the wall flexing as eddie climbed lol
Eddie trying the Magnus warmup: No warmup.
Man Eddie is just way to funny.. love his sense of humour 🤣🤣
Magnus i respect you more, from every video i see. You using all my idols xD
Subió más que Larry wheels
He's like a rhino storming the wall. Amazing!
dont blaspheme
Imagine how scary a big dude like that would be if he did it more often, a actual gorilla
Eddie Hall singing Spider Pig is like speaking to my soul. Saw that episode as a kid and have sung that song since.
This is Gimli 😂❤
*I could feel that in me lats*
very impressive by the beast
He's good !
whats the man on the moon joke about am I missing some context?
Bro Eddie hall falling is so funny 😂its like a dumpling hitting the ground lmao
Even being one of the strongest men to ever live he's still making a lot of effort to climb the wall, that just goes to show how much different and how much strength rock climbing requires.
Love it!
I've done the last exercise with dumbbells before, it really is harder than it sounds, but pretty fun
Eddie is a lot of fun to watch! It's clear he's excited to try and to learn and takes it all with humour. After the first attempt at the orange climb (about 9 minutes in) you can see when he looks at the wall his eyes are just glowing 🤘
Surprised he didn't rip any holds off the wall :D
I love how some explicitives are beeped out but some are left in all their glory.
1:46 Magnus: grabs penis shaped hold "that's what you like right?" Eddie: "yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah"
13:01 Eddie : No f'ing way. No chance.. also Eddie : look at that. Easy, Easy
Man this is COMEDY! HAAAAAAAAHAHAHA!!!!
I'm impressed with how nimble this big guy is
Spiderman, Spiderman etc..
Lifting 170 kg so gracefully... he is fking strong! and flexible, trully a beast!. His forearm is like mi whole body XD
Man that made me laugh ahah never saw this guy but I like that he doesnt care when he fails and makes fun of it.. Good spirit
Every time Eddie advances, he's pulling 170kg, its so impressive to see him attempt this, and he does so well!
Im thoroughly impressed by Eddie for such a big man, He progressed with the climbing levels really well, Good Job 👍
That is a big dude to be climbing. That is impressive. Almost 400 lb he's got to pull up that wall with no grip.
“Looks like I’m growing a baby embryo in there” hahaha Eddie!
Eddie is so likeable. That was a very fun one, Magnus. You're pulling off all the great collabs!
seeing that guy able to handle his own 300 plus lbs weight, would be awesome.  He's actually impressive for a huge guy.
16:37 Magnus should definitely do one collab with @francis.bourgeois 😆
"your stronger than you think" lmao
Just have to comment and say how much I've enjoyed this channel, and especially this video. Two really cool guys with no ego shown making a fun video. Thanks Mag!
It was fun to watch. Thank you.
Not worlds strongest man for a few years actually, it’s Tom Stoltman.
man imagine climbing with all that mass on you.. especially your first session! well done
Always cool seeing someone who knows muscles learn more about them and blow their mind on something as simple as scaling a wall being a great pumpi for something they'd use 100s of lbs to train
i also saw him playing golf with Rick Shiels
As an American 170kg didn’t make me flinch, once he said 370lbs I said “F**K!!” 😂
15:50 i fucking died laughing, his reaction and comment "like a cat scratching the door" oh my, i love Eddie Hall man, funny as hell :D
I have to say, didn't think Eddie would be this good. Not bad at all. Good stuff.
I really got into this video when that massive man Eddie did a sit start at 13:16 to kind of slopey jugs. For a newbie, he's super talented. But for a large man and newbie, Eddie's nothing short of incredible!
Hey man I've just seen the video with Norwegian hulk. If you got time, check out my comment on that because I think you are going to be surprised if you take a man like that on some real rocks. Sounds like an impossible challenge but I've seen some weird shit in my time as a climber. 😅
2:53 Eddie’s calves started flexing. He has more muscle in one leg than I have in my whole body 😅
1:49 the one he is grabbing looks like a willy
Can I recommend two wheels for both of you. Hire two road racing bikes do some Yorkshire dales.
Eddie is a great sport.
Why the fuck is beast so good at rock climbing?
Now we need Shaw and Hall together
This is great. Army tank of a man winning
8:20 to 8:30😂😂that transition......now how did we end up in this spot
What gentle beast❤️
I haven't been this surprised for a long time. Congrats to Eddie!
Ya
Is it just me or does Magnus remind you of Sharlto Copley from Distric 9?
Using his own words, Fucking Hell. I feel so big on the wall at 240lbs. Thats incredible and inspirational.
if eddie kept on climbing as a hobby would be so dope tbh
This was a very fun and entertaining video.!I got to learn so much about climbing. Cheers!
4:10 Haha classic eddie, directly going there
8:32 never in my entire life did I think I would see Eddie hall in this position on a climbing wall…
100kg difference...how about adding 100kg weights to Magnus and try again :D
Liked and subscribed. Great content!
I can't wait for that monster if he continue climbing
no only when the mountain never was borne this one of the biggest people. the mountain is bigger and stronger in all competitions
your handshake at the end :D so funny :D
Growing up I was fat and weak.  Then in my 20's I got more fit.  I found myself in Las Vegas in a place that had a rock climbing thing that started below ground and went above the strip.  Having never climbed and still having the mindset of the weak fat guy I started on the short easy wall, then moved straight to the high wall and made it to the top.  It was an amazing feeling.
Eddie is the Man! What a role model. There's no reason nobody can do something like that.
Big fella absolutely sent it
Why my dumbass thinks that I can do that😅😅😅
We need a video of Eddie's wife reacting to this :)
messi? 😎😀😀
Great video Eddie is a legend ...I bet your editor had the worst time ever editing the ...erm FRENCH words Eddie said a fair few times.. I also reckon Chries Heirs came second in the swearing olympics after Eddie.. :)  Both great vdeo colabs. Keep them coming Magnus.. :)
13:30 uff this man my goodness
I skip the video 4 times and still found no actual footage of him climbing. Any idea what time to seek?
Respect well done
wow I was shocked to see him swing like that! He beat my expectations!
Dude such a huge respect, most people would be like "Ah I'm too big I will half-ass this" but he doesn't take shortcuts
Eddie did well😊
I liked the part at the end where Eddie revealed that he was Magnus in disguise the whole time. I wonder when Magnus figured it out?
edie its all ways funny to watch but damn he realy did impresive for his size
"I'm a fit guy..."  Nope, just fat and roided out.
Respect, didn't think he could do it :)
Ah. He's 170kg and can climb. I gotta try this.
Strong there but week there . Stretch . Always stretch
Strength is amazing it can be measured in any type of physical attributes
Eddie has great body awareness. You can see it on the green route. That really serves him. And he's bloody hilarious! Love this guy.
amazing video
Bro this guy really exceeded everyone's expectations!!! No wonder he is world's strongest man!
That's a lot of man to be hauling up the wall!
16:48 haha never knew hed be mentioned
this eddie always surprise me , being his size , climbing is possible , lol
“The last time I climbed a tree, I fell off and broke my arm, so let’s touch wood” 😂
‘I don’t wear a ring because I lift’ might be the hardest sentence ever spoken by a human.
I love this guy Eddie . Good stuff
Gotta love Eddy : 'if you wanna be da best climber in the world, it's prolly best to just cut your legs off'   xD xD LMAO
Vi er begge tromsø veringer😂
Well, he’s not lying when he says he’s fit. That’s one hell of an athlete right there
The fact that he almost got his feet back on the wall at 14 minutes is incredible. Suprisingly good at climbing even though he is such a large man
eddie literally looks like kingkong climbing up that building
Seeing that amount of man trying to scale walls with tiny footholds was something.
I love Eddy.... Give your body a break and live for another f****** 35- 40 years.... You have nothing to prove, enjoy your life
"I didn't have the balls to tell him, he's intimidating" LMAO
What happened to Eddie becoming a bodybuilder? He looks exactly like he did 1 January?
"You know they put a man on the moon, right?" "Allegedly" lost it lmao
The reuse of moon joke was perfect comedy. what a great chemistry they have.
just remeber they put a man on the moon
He is good
JAJAJAJAJAAAA...Como se dice cada loco con su tema...se nota que cada cual esta preparado para tales cosas y asuntos...Bien animo con todas las cosas y vayamos todos con alegrias...
Honestly he’s very impressive, climbing like this with this weight and morphology is crazy good  !
It’s interesting because he obviously have out of this world grip strength and like all types of strength imaginable.  But also has the body weight that is close to 3 times a climbers weight  I wonder how that changes how the parts of the body that isn’t muscle, and the technique you would need to use.  Because I figure it probably is quite different.
looks so weird to  see a 170 beast climbing
There's something oddly surreal about watching the world's strongest man open his mouth and hearing a British accent come out.
oh were just been nagged ere. were just on ere mate. just on this blue one. cheers man. he was so nice about that. loved it. but to be fair, would you say no to a dude who is 170kg monster lol
That is a big man 😮
Give this man a harness😂
Ive never realised the fucks were bipped on this channel :D
invite RAMON DINO, would be sick, guy has a insane grip
Im not critiquing in anyway I think he did an amazing job but seriously can you imagine that build doing something like soloing el cap.
I wondered why I recognised this place so well, Its my local climbing centre
so very stupid to do that with big build cause there build not for that thing perhaps do the thing wat Eddie do about lifting 😂😂😂😂 many things to know how you climb but its not the way its used to be 😂😂so many griffins
Climbing is one of the best things for tight big guys, this was cool to see.
Im so im impressed with Eddie! Especially on the bouldering one wth!
Trust Eddie to have the best video yet. Christ this man makes me laugh.
Never really watched anything from Eddie but he is such a cool guy! I loved the train - guy reference with the GoPro on his forehead
when Eddies ego is in check hes so likeable :D <3
"im a fit guy" no.. Eddie  no... being strong does not mean you are fit
I don't know why, but something seems weird about the dynamic between you and Eddie. Like, I wouldn't say it feels as if you dislike each other, but I do have the impression that you were having less fun together than you had with some of your other guests. Can't really point my finger on it though. Just something seems weird, not really sure why or what exactly. It was probably just me seeing something the wrong way.
wow blew my expectations
I have to sympathise with eddy when he was climing orange. I have actually only climbed once before, and it was in boyscouts (trying to say im not sure how valid this is) but my legs were so long that at one point i practically kneed myself in the ribs trying to get up a hold. I think i legitamitly bruised myself, although it was so long ago i cant say for sure. And if your wondering how long your legs need to be in porportion to your hips/body to cause this i'll just say this. I am considering custom pants.
"I think you are stronger than you think"  Magnus to the strongest man in the world.
this shows a really neat phenomenon thats pretty common in physics known as the inverse square law. Basically, the stronger you are, the more muscle you need to move the mass of yourself. Even the strongest man in the world starts on the same equal footing in rock climbing as everyone else because of this. Its pretty amazing
Wow! Excellent job for his first time climbing
Eddie is one hell of an athlete, holy hell. Awkward holds and he hanged with this body weight, getting through weird starts. People a quarter of his weight would still have trouble.
Bro, this guy is no joke, for a first timer being that heavy, he's doing amazing
The most funny climber :)))! Eddie did it great with his weight and not being used to stretch the body
So now we need HowNot2 to use Eddie as a test load.    I guess they stuck to bouldering because they didn't want to see an autobelay catch fire.  Anybody else half expect Eddie to take a big gulp of the chalk at 4:36 ?  He's so used to shotgunning water bottles, I could imagine there have been accidents with non-water bottles.
Super impressive. Wow! Eddie is truly a beast.
eddies personality really shines here. as a climber im impressed by the amount he climbed.
That's not Pudzian. Polska gurom
4:00 and 5:00 Magnus climbing without his feet is amazing, and eddie halls reaction is hilarious
he chunky
The man deadlifts half a ton but can't pull his own body weight around....I've said it before weightlifter don't make good climbers.....
Never knew a big man that could climb good...honestly too much baggage
They put a man on the moon. That backfired on him 😂
Some people just have a natural feel for climbing. Just something about your body being able to feel itself in space, and it has nothing to do with strength. Eddie seems to have that. It looks different than you usually see, because he's gigantic, but I think he's got it.
Pretty sure I recognised one of those camera guys from tgf videos..?
8:48 For the FIRST time ever, I felt genuine ADMIRATION for Eddie Hall.
haha this a awesome video
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Muscles the Strong? ... Ironic. He could lift others from floor, but not himself.
His calves are monstrous
Eddie is such a class act. He always goes for it regardless of how unnatural it is for him. This is an awesome colab for sure.
Wow for 170 kg it is very impressive, i'm like 1/3 of his weight bruh, his hands are really strong, well his record is 465kg almost three times his body weight.
The height difference looks smaller than youd expect but its just Eddie sinking 5 inches into the soft floor
how many ads do you want mate
Magnus : Rock climbing Eddiehall : Weighted Rock Climbing
Yeah me too I stopped climbing trees when I was 10... 12.... okay 22.
Wow. M.B. is fantastic. I'm amazed at how well he did.
All this with a man who weighs at least 200 lbs more than anyone else in the place.  There's no give up in the man.
World stronger man is a MARIUSZ PUDZIANOWSKI!!!
14:40 "well some people doubt it” 😂
The only reason eddie hall isnt the best rock climber alive is because he focused on something else. Guy is a freak
You know they put a man on the moon
I didn't expect Eddie to be so... Australian😂
I hope eddie climbs again.
holy shitt for a big man he did so good
Just two guys being dudes
bro eddie is a monster, he actually climbed really well here. he out climbed larry ffs
This is a collab I never expected and I LOVE it!! I know Eddie is extremely strong, but this insane! Never expected him to be this good at climbing. He really deserves the "worlds strongest man" title. Mad respect for both of you!
Get Bryan Shaw next!
i think this shows how much of an athlete these strong men are. to be 170kg and swinging yourself around on a wall is actually pretty impressive
Magnus: "You're stronger than you think!" LOL
You know, they put a man on the moon and you can't even like the video
Eddie is like twice the weight with different weight-dispersion and not used to using his body in that fashion, not to mention the flexibility (or lack thereof ;P ). Good for him!
Both legends 😆👍
Wow Eddie is a lot more agile than I would guess.
magnus good feel good content, inspirational
Rock climbing is a great sport to me .
you should invite me, i am soo good i can climb all diffrent colors at the same time
I think it would be interesting so see Eddie attempt the same climbs once he's leaner, after his bodybuilding journey.
how such a big size guy do it
hi, i just  wanna say, they not edit it up XD Eddie cheating haha
Smoked Larry wheels. For real though. (Future video)
not much of a climber myself, but what happened at 15:11?
I don't think people realise how fit this man is as well as strong, to shift that weight takes some stamina!! Well done Eddie mate didn't expect you to do half as good as you did 😂😂
hearing magnus say "you are stronger than you think" to the strongest man on this planet is kinda funny
As a passionate yet poor climber id love to spend a week with Magnus and see how much better I could become. Loved this video dude!!
I'm impressed! He did far better than he did boxing
“You’re stronger than you think” lol I think he knows
China’s The Great Wall is very lucky. Magnus have not train this dude to climb yet. Not because he can climb it but it collapse while he climb it.
3:16 I have never seen a calf on a calf on a calf
He's got to be my favourite personality that you've had on your channel. What a fun dude to be around! Loved the vid
this proves that eddie is a legit athlete
30 seconds of pure tension with 170kg bodyweight will definitely get you pumped
SPIDER PIG SPIDER PIG Does whatever a SPIDER PIG does Can he swing From a web No he cant He's a pig LOOK OOOUUUTTT!!!! He is a SPIDER PIG!!
Bro I love Eddie 😂 he’s hilarious
This was hilarious! Love Eddie, he's great on the camera
Really good.... Especially for a huge guy👍🏾
Magnus has the best personality out of anyone on youtube.
“Green, done. Orange, done. Blue, done 👀” was so funny. Eddie is crazy good though.
It almost like the gyms are not enough for magnus. He can climb the highest grade stuff
I read comments about people being amazed with Eddie and how he managed to be better than expected so I went in with high expectations for him. He still exceeded them by far! What his shirt says is 100% true :D
actually wasnt bad at all! Good mobility.
I was surprised on the blue one man
With the necessary training he would have been a hell of a prop forward in rugby
Really impressive! I actually think that his too large shoes might have been holding him back a bit.
This is bouldering, BTW!!!!!
I was worried for magnus doing the turkish getups. that thing falling on your head is bad news.
The spit.
🤔😱💪🏼👍🏽👍🏽
Thats a freaky tall guy at 6:46 , Eddies like 190+ cm
damn he is good for his size !! impressive seriously
A small suggestion when you keep saying "come on" over and over again I feel it more as your rushing in a, I want it done your taking to long you slowpoke why arent you doing better, I know you dont mean it like that your saying it as encouragement and also as a way to push to go faster because you said climbing faster is better for stamina and saving strength. Maybe just more terminology other then just those 2 word over and over again idk how Eddie felt or even thought about it but I thought I would mention it because it first video I noticed you doing it ever and I cannot be alone in the thinking also!
Eddie did really well
Great episode. Really nice vibe. Eddie impressed me.
Eddie did a lot better than I thought he would .
its in sheffield!! i climb there!!!
4:24 Eddie know all about doing what it takes to win....
1:23 Eddie: "That's literally gonna be me in about an hour's time"  ...Dude climbing proceeds to fall off the wall onto his butt 🤣
Look at his fucking calves
The glass of milk at 00:49
1:46 you can’t convince me that the hold he’s holding isn’t a phalic object
«One of the strongest men to walk on this planet» aint no way boi
I wonder Eddie is so smart and polite man, despite of his monstrous appearance
Eddie is undoubtedly one of the most impressive people ever born.
Woooww, how nice!! I follow both of you, never thought there would be a crossover :D
this is amazingly entertaining haha
I love "Turkish get-ups'. Such a great full body workout
Get a steelworker or scaffold erector on your show, some big dudes out there who can climb anything
ive been climbing for 4 years and im still having a little bit of a problem with crimps  I've been practicing on my slopers and seeing you do it motivates me to go to the rock climbing gym
Great video! You should probably tell him to roll onto his back when he jumps down (at least what I was taught to spare my body) - it was a bit scary for the back and knees to see him break his fall by "falling" forwards that way :-)
I loved this. I'm also on the heavier side and it was interesting to see how would a fit but heavy dude mesh with the walls.
I'd love to seethis kinf of video with K boges, theBioneer or Ido Portal
I can see the wall bending when he changes grips
0:47 imagine being so good at being strong that you consider being a professional bodybiulder "being retired"
I found the sport where I finally get to skip leg day! XD
I’m impressed he was able to do what he did
“Your stronger than you think”
15:51 loooooooooolll
Would like to understand the whole leg philosophy with weight?
what da hellllllllllllll wym not only in size
can someone plz explain Magnus's remark on not using his feet😅 At (3:50) he says something like while it's a good tip for beginners, it's not the case for more advanced climbers. "I don't my legs at all. I want my legs to be as light as possible" I would really appreciate some more insight on that. As a climber who just started breaking into V6 and V7s, focusing on using my feet more has been a huge part of my training.
Eddie really supprised me on this one
Hilarious line of "I literally got more chance shagg%!# King Charles in the ass." at 13:10  . . . 21:28 Air boob grasp gesture also had me rolling.
Should’ve titled this, “The mountain climbs mountains”
"Allegedly" I love it. Eddie is a legend.
U should climb with storror the parkour youtube people from UK
now it's up to you to try strongman disciplines 🙂
8:20 WTF ARE THOSE LEGS HOLY SMOKES
Would you try get Jason Momoa on the channel? That would be sick, dude loves bouldering.
Cool to see you guys in sheff
Did y’all know they put a man on the moon
maad respect to eddie... thats a massive man to be climbing!
Dude he did pretty damn good bouldering for the first time, especially with that swing hold
Love U Eddie, U inspire me!!! THX
Eddies Calf are something else.
Eddie Hall and Brian Shaw climbing together would be amazing.
brilliant. wonderful video.  Absolute stars :)
His lack of faith in the holds is brilliant. 😂  I always felt like that so I can only imagine how he feels!  Took me a long time to realise those things are practically indestructible when bolted to the wall. Then I found spinners. 😂
if you think you cant climb, just remember they put a man on the moon,
Eddie killed it. I remember the first time I went climbing, I was struggling worse than him and I was easily 100kg less. I'm very happy your channel is becoming more popular, can't wait to see what new guests you bring on!
i'm really impressed, didn't expect him to perform as well as he did.
Wow didn't expect Eddie to be such a good climber!!! Incredible episode
How are people in that gym not freaking out? There's literally 2 legends chilling there, I would be freaking out ngl haha
The Connections (2021) [short documentary] 💖
Magnus, loved this episode!  Never thought I'd see a crossover with Strongman, but since we're here, you should message Brian Shaw. He's really into grip strength stuff right now.
What are your thoughts on Marc-Andre Leclerc? is he the greatest ever
I came here to see Eddie climb and maybe fall, im now off to Google climbing centres near me 🤣
very cool vid! Eddi Hall seems very fun, would love to train with someone like that lmao. Didnt know he had a YT either!
Look no offence but Eddie the Ego IS NOT The Worlds Strongest Man. He won 1 time in 2017 & Has Not Won Since.. Used to bitch about Thor every year coz'  Thor would make the podium but Ego wouldn't. He juuuust beat Thor in '17 but then Thor blew him outta the water & smashed his 2mnth deadlift record & then dominated the WSM next.  Then beat him in the ring lolz. Get Hafþór on your channel!  He's an absolute gentleman too.
We don't want Eddie climbing actual mountains, friggin hell if he fell it would be an extinction level event similar to the dinosaur's demise
Eddie doesn't climb the wall but the wall leans towards him.:D
Eddie doesn't climb the wall but the wall leans towards him.:D
Just so everyone knows, Eddie is almost 400 lbs. Imagine a normal 400lbs doing this. No, just imagine a 300 lbs person doing this. No, imagine a 275 lbs person doing this. Yea.. I didn't think so
That’s gonna be my new saying… “just remember, they put a man on the moon”
A big thing for the beast that he could get from rock climbing is to get a deeper understanding of his strength. It's all about pushing through the fear of falling. That being said he might be better suited to top rope climbing for starters to get the stamina up and technique.
Nice, I'm liking Bronze era. I grew up swimming, so my chest is big compared to the rest of my body.
im surprised at how well he did
I've never seen a wall try to climb another wall :o
This is great :D
I heard they put a man on the moon.
I lift weights, year round, so I stay in very good shape.  But, in the summer, I play tennis a LOT, so I'm always like 20-25LB's lighter (at 6'4.)  I cannot begin to express how much EASIER calisthenics are at 190LB's compared to when I'm 215LB's.   I can't even IMAGINE what it would be like at 270LB's, let alone 370LB's.
Next time I can't complete a route I'll remind myself, hey remember Eddie struggled on the orange too (I'll ignore the small details of him weighing 70kg more than me and deadlifting more than 5 times haha) Can't believe how strong that big bastard is, I feel how much hard climbing is after II took a break and put on just 20kg, man was over twice my lightest weight and still climbing hard.  Nice to see the differences in peak human physique and Eddie as the strength worlds power pulling  tractor to respect the power to weight of the F1 car XD
Do you think I'm an octopus?! I have heard many funny lines, but that takes the cake.
"Just remember they put a man on the moon" lol after Eddie started it, Magnus wouldn't let it go.
My man Eddie doesnt disappoint. Can't wait to see him cut. Magnus is a total badass hunk of man and this channel rules. More
Cool to see! I weigh about 120 kg myself and its pretty tough. I used to weigh 100 and the difference weight makes in climbing is just crazy.
Most of the strongmen competitors I know are pretty athletic overall. Good on Eddie for giving this a go, it’s tough even for people half his weight
I think he's talking about Tony yaniro with the wheelchair story? I'd heard something similar about him back in the day.  And Eddie's hands are so big, he could jam rattly fist / offwidth
Yo this is in climbing hangar?? I'd love for you to come the Liverpool 1 bro
You should consider YouTube boxing magnus, the skills are very transferable plus it would be an interesting adventure with quite the incentive🤷‍♂️
Its beyond me how Eddie can do this with that weight, he is SOOO strong!
When a guy weighs more then you in KG’s then you do in LB’s 😂
"I've got a little baby growing on my forearm." 😆
Worlds strongest man 😂 hasn’t been the strongest for quite some time now
Eddie switched to bodybuilding? Why and how? lol
I’m surprised for his weight I thought he would fall on his ass from just the grey 😂 respect to eddie that’s some raw strength
Eddie's such a lovely guy.  Great Vid.  : )
He looks like a little boy next to him
Half way up he says "I'm pissing in the wind here mate"🤣
1:46 those grey holds look familiar.
climbing is not simply a situation of sheer strength but rather grip and good cardio.  weight is also a major factor.  obviously the less weight you have the least you have to lift and manage along the way.  Balance is the key.  the ratio between weight size and muscle mass.  think about it,  kids can climb things very easy, but kids are not super strong. but they are lightweight (on average) and they do have excellent cardio and blood flow.   again cardio and blood flow,  sending oxygen to ones organs and muscles.   Eddie is totally wrong built for this task, which is why despite being able to lift tons of weight is having the hardest time coping with his own weight and climbing.  ironic isn't it!   He's fantastic for bursts of strength, but quickly runs out of gas because his body is not tuned for cardio and blood flow.  He's a perfect example of how a persons power and strength is not based on a persons physical appearance, contrary to popular conception.
Wanna see Eddy do Brian's blob challenge after a few months of climbing....   Magnus!! Get Eddy and Brian shaw on the wall at the same time!!! Content will ensue!!!
I love how there is NO ego by both, but especially by someone (Eddie) who is considered to be the strongest man in the world ( or one of them, not to insult others) and being comfortable enough to show on camera his limitations and weaknesses. This is actually inspiring.
Great job on blue for a heavy boy.
Do you think the designers of that first set of jugs know they look like dicks? lol
I am abit confused because I have seen people saying it took them a few weeks to break into v3's but I went bouldering for the first time 4 days ago and I already managed to complete a couple v3's and was even trying v4's (which was unsuccessful) is this normal to be able to do or do I need to find a better place to go to?
Eddie always give the impression of being a cool and calm guy. It's almost ironic he could probably rip most of us apart bare handed.
I don’t climb, I’ve never climbed, I likely never will climb, I have no clue why I like this content so much
Kristin Holte beat you with one obstacle on "Kronidioten" in MESTERNES MESTER😂
Eddie could stay in his comfort zone and just lift heavy things all day but he is open to be humble and trying things outside his muscle memory. Shows good character
Because society is a joke I bet there's a few clowns who would think this strong king is fat lmao because he doesn't dehydrate himself to show off
This is great content
my god that weight exercise looked like murder accident waiting to happen.
"No way this is gonna happen, it'll be like watching king kong at el capitan" Well Eddie did it.
"It's harder than it looks" And it looks quite hard to begin with.
I really enjoyed the banter in this one, Eddie seems like a super swell dude. He did amazing for a first time too, but then again he had a hell of a coach.
I'm a heavy set guy and this was never my sport but I did climb up a 20 foot quarry wall once wearing cuban heels to escape an angry rottweiler
Finally a guest with personality!!
very nice man....
what climbing boots do you use ?
holy crap eddie hall knows who Francis the train guy is
bruh his calf 8:21
Part 2 with eddi hall please😂😂😂
Just behind Honnold this was my 2nd favorite collaboration so far ❤️❤️❤️
Should have taught him how to fall, especially because his story about falling out of a tree and breaking his arm!
You can let the kettlebell rest on the wrist with a Turkish get-up.  Looks a bit dangerous to hold it that way!
Please make a video with Alex megos!
damn you already know that big man has been drinking way too much gfuel hahah
If a gym like this existed anywhere in my country, it'd be so crowded you wouldn't be able to move...
What was the point of this challange? It's like a fish competing in a hurdle race.
I would love to see Kyle HIll on this channel! He has talked about his enjoyment of climbing since his days on "Because Science". Would be fun to see him doing something different too!
Awesome video. I get a kick out of watching Eddie he's a character bet y'all had a blast doing this video.
11:24 Is that the lad from the tgf bro vids?
Eddie: *beeeeeep* Magnus: yeah
4:28 says the man who almost died lifting weights xd
Two legend In a video always with the peak content 🤙🏼🔥
5:04 "spida pig ,spida pig,,does whaever a spida pig does" legend
Magnus, I am new to climbing. Would be really interested in a video setting rough strength standards needed for climbing at different levels (specifically bouldering levels, I.e V1, V2, V3…).  Things like: Max deadhang time Max pullup strength Max pullup reps Calisthenics skills (muscle up, front lever, etc)  If I want to climb V7, for example, what strength goals should I aim for to make sure I’m not limited by fitness (vs technique).  Would make a cool video. Could even do it with a bunch of people who climb at different levels and test their weighted pull-ups, max pull-ups reps, deadhang, etc.
Eddie Hall is a BEEEAAAAAST
Love this channel and have watched Beast TV show a few times. Both fricking brilliant. Love from a boulderer Yorkshire boy ❤
Mm as emazoooskdkj as jskdd se o o u
Eddie looks like a bear climbing the tree, the sheer mass of this man.
It’s like you look at him and you’re like he can’t climb but then you r ever he has one of the strongest grip in the world😭😂
god damn theres a vid of a guy literally doing a turkish getup with a person on his arm
Can you climb with arm wrestler Ermes Gasparini?  He has some really strong hands it would be interesting to see
"Eddie has recently slimmed down to concentrate on bodybuilding"  Eddie: " so anyway I'm going to bulk to 300lbs before the cut"
Magnus collab with SOFYA YOKOYAMA - World cup champ!  Ya'll would have the best energy together.
But seriously,  dude is one of the best climbers alive chilling with one of the strongest dudes
One of the best pullers in the world ......... Hanging out with some strong dude 😜
As a Lifter for 7 years straight and a Climber ik eddies pain lmaoo no matter how much you can Lift or how much time you lift with that rough of a barbell nothing compares to em rocks lol. YOU SHOUKDA HAD EDDIE DO A DYNO LOLOL
Next collab some Storror members?
Also Eddie should change his priorities - no more body building, instead, climb for a year or two. Docuent his change in flexibility and strength. woudl LOVE to see that.
Dude Eddie is hilariou. Spider pig lol =D
I just started watching and i seen that my weight is 60+ kilo and your just 70+ kilo and twice my size is actually suprising too  Im also 14 years old
This guy is literally 3x my bodyweight. Must be really tough on the hands
Skip leg day...nah, sit in a wheelchair for 2 week...Makes you climb faster.
i love eddie always, dude is always so positive
oh my god i love eddie it's so good to see him on your channel 😁
This guy literally needs an award for most positive YouTube channel and comments section in the history of YouTube.    Been following since jujimufu
That’s so cool I just stared bouldering too it’s such a good workout
I love how passionate Eddie is about learning new movements and you can see that he is an professional athlete with great body control. Crazy to see such a heavy guy climb so good on the first day!
Feel like I just watched an artillery tank scale a cliff
It's impressive he's even able to stay on the wall with the weight he's carrying. God damn.
Eddie is just an all around nice guy
Magnus brother, if u don't mind you should put 100kg add on and then 😅play 1on1 with eddie..... Idk, is it fair?.... Because eddie fingers are holding 170kg monster in air.....😂😂.... ❤️Eddie bruh, u r really strong guy....
plsssss DO some videos w alex megos and chris hanke in their homegym like who can set the hardest routes... that would be so cool
Great job Eddie!!!
I thought Hafthorr was the world's strongest
My new phrase, just remember, they put a man on the moon (allegedly)
really humble man, Eddie.. respect
That was really impressive stuff Eddie.  I was on the edge of my seat for that first blue attempt, starting low at the floor.
Does anyone know the name of the climbing pants Magnus is wearing?
is not Thor the worlds strongest?
I'm not keen on Eddie Hall after his criminal episode. I always viewed Eddie as this kind of Gentleman strong man until I saw that.  I think when he destroyed that guys car he set a bad example, glorifying criminality with his platform
I did not expect him to be able to climb so well! Very impressive.
Didn’t Eddie get arrested for crushing a car with a tank? 😂😂
At first I wasn't to impressed, then I remembered that I don't weigh more than twice my own bodyweight... Mad props to Eddie!
There might be a handful of people Eddies weight that could perform the easiest of those.
Are you vaxxinated?
Wild to see Eddie name drop Francis (the train guy)
seriously guys Eddie is a real proper guy, 100% determination good spirits and incredibly charismatic. What a great guest Magnus
Eddie is 6'2 170kg?!!! He's the same height as me but almost double the weight and even I've got a few extra pounds on me. That's a thiiiiccc man
Eddie definitely did an amazing job for his first time! As a plus size climber myself I felt for him and how much harder it is when you weigh more and you having to haul that weight with you up these walls. I’m no strong woman status but even with my pretty good muscle mass I naturally just encounter more difficulties on top of the already difficult problems set by the route setters lol But I don’t let it hold me back and with time/practice my strength & skills have improved more and more. So I wanted to say to anyone who may see this and are interested in climbing but doesn’t fit the mold of the ideal climbers body type that you can do it! Your time, hard work, and determination that you put into the sport will pay off in the end ❤
You should get a nice spiderman costume and go climbing random things in public!
Amazing to see two channel people I been watching for a while come together like this. MAJOR PROPS to Eddie Hall for doing all this. Not easy for anyone, especially a man of his size and weight. Hard on them knees and legs, but he did it ^<^
Even though eddie dabbed on that blue one, it was clearly within his ability.
You I need get a job
this was wholesome.
Do a video with Chris Bumstead 🤔🤩
I was shocked when I saw how Eddie swung to the blue on the left..for a beginner, that was very good, and for hiz size I think it was remarkable.
I already watched this video like 3-4 times. It is so great and relaxing. I wish there would be a series of videos like this. Same idea, but gather as many great athlete as you can, from all kinds of sport. Like the video with Devon Larratt and now with Eddie. So great, and the best ad for this sport.
lmao imagine going for a climb and theres eddi hall and magnus meatball hanging around xD
Pissing in the wind here mate! Hilarious😂
good to know... if a strong man is ever chasing you.. climb a tree he wont be able to catch you haha
I've been  watching your videos for a year and only today decided to subscribe  I'm not a climber but your videos are awesome please keep it up awesome stuff
Pudzian lepszy
Ads are ridiculous I can not enjoy the actual video
6:28 There’s something quite funny about Magnus reassuring the worlds strongest man that ‘You’re stronger than you think.”
Wait, are you danish, or something like that. 🤔
its amazing how a man who is supposed to be known as the strongest man in the world is out of breath by climbing 2 easy routes. im not saying this out of disrespect but its fascinating how a different sport makes such a huge impact on the body even when you are a powerhouse like eddie
He's  not world's strongest man
Love this Videos' Vibe <3
Kan i have a shoutout🙏
23:33 "I could hang with one hand and you could hang with two" lol the face Eddie gives here is just priceless
Hey Magnus, just wanted to thank you for doing content like this showing people outside the normal climbing body type having fun climbing.  I started watching you 8 months back and because of you started climbing 7 months ago. Your videos around that time with Isaac really got me hooked as I've always been very underweight. Climbing is the first time in my life I feel like I am working hard at getting good at a sport and improve my body for me, and not just doing typical gym to bulk up for everyone else. It's also the first time in my life I've been able to bulk real mass over a consistent time and am now about 20 lbs heavier than I've ever been before.  Any day I am not too sore to train you can find me sitting in front of the Kilter board at my local gym, and I'm loving every second of it. So thanks again, and I hope one day I can run into you at a climbing gym and shake your hand in person.
Eddie do special forces tests , ie para reg ,royal marines ,sas , pathfinders ,sbs.
Is it really so shocking that he's carrying two of Magnus' ....?
Hey Magnus, maybe you should put yourself in the strongest man in the world shoes... and strap the amount of weight that it takes onto your body for you to be as heavy as him
Sometimes Magnus oh, you really don't put yourself in the strongest man in the world's shoes now he's literally 2/3 of your body weight. So I think you should do a video of you putting on weights attached to you and see how long you can hang next to somebody that is that weight. cheers
Eddie is the most Derbyshire guy I've ever heard - and I live in Derbyshire 😂😂
Anybody noticed This guy is giving free genuine coaching without even mentioning giving it. Wow 😅👍😁🥂🙃
Very impressed by your commitment. Not easier for heavy guys.
13:29 you can see how competitive he is,that was amazing.I dont do any climbing,but man,that looked hard af.
How many pull ups can he do lol he can't even wipe his ass
Bro be looking like Atreus if he grew up
Mad respect to the rocks to be able to hold eddie
im incredibly impressed that he could do the L sit so well i thought it would be impossible
That was so much fun to watch! If I ever ran in to that man in a dark ally I would run...or at least try to run as I have trouble walking. He was so humble for what you do Magnus I will bet that he adds climbing to his work out because he found muscles that he doesn't use. Eddie seems like such a gentle giant, you both would be a pleasure to know!
What this makes me think is how in older warfare times, how different body shapes would have been so differently suited to different strengths and weaknesses. I just picture Eddie being in full plate with a hammer and shield, and Magnus being a quick agile fencer type, and you're going to want them by your side in totally different environments. And those two fighting each other would be so interesting. If the big man ever gets close it's just over, but maybe the quick guy can poke the weak points and stay on the edge.
8:30 so if he falls from here.... what happens?! 😲
Ay up duck. Potteries lad hauling basically two people up a wall. I used to climb 30+ yrs ago. Tried having a go 20 yrs ago and the lungs burning comment rang true. Magnus is not normal!
Its like kratos climbing up
Amazing
You always bring super nice content Magnus. And this is no different. Always liked Eddie. But there's some really wholesome about seeing this huge man climbing. Loving it
Eddie could probably do a turkish getup with me as the weight.  yikes.
eu acho que ele esta gostando da experiência. muito divertido
Impressive!
"You're stonger than you think!"   Eddie Hall:   🤔
Eddie did so much better, as usual, then I thought!
100 agility vs 100 strength
Love the guy at 13:58 just genuinly enjoying the show.
For 170 kg, he is pretty fast & flexible
Love this 😂 Quite surprised Magnus hasn’t done the Turkish Getup! Such a good one for shoulder stability!
Now lets switch it up.
You two together is gold! I’d love to see you two doing some bits! Like take Magnus for a ride in eddies tank!! 😂 thanks to you both ✌🏼
This was thoroughly enjoyable, gentle competition, not patronising. Genuinely funny. I haven’t climbed for over 4 years. So also highly motivating. Ed’s got to watch out for tendinitis!
Topp klasse😂❤
wow. Eddie and Magnus have really good chemestry in front of the camera! Meat up again, try other things and put it on YouTube. That would be great!
Eddie Hall is the most genuine guy ever.....except for the poundland special frying pan bending on this Morning show clip..lol . But great guy
I love watching you do your thing my brother
Dudes calves 🤯
Que buenos retos
Wow big thumbs up to Eddie Hall for trying this, don't know why but seeing him climb was quite a nerve for me
Magnus never fails to make us laugh 🤍
eddies calf's tho at 10:16
Late night climbing ASMR
spider pig.  great simpson's reference
Oh now you need to do the strong man lifts. Otherwise this is a useless video
eddie is a straight up legend but respect to Magnus for calling out the dabs! should've got him on the woodies!!
1:46 ... that's a shaft!
i lovce the way eddie just f and blinds
The internet says that Magnus is 1.74m (5"7) tall, and Eddie Hall is 1.91m (6"2), but here they look nearly the same height? Hmmm
Eddie Hall is such a gentleman and character - love his attitude.
Go to ROKTFACE in brighouse the biggest in the uk
I wanna see shaw vs Thor vs beast rock climbing
Wait worlds strongest man? I don’t see thors here
Elsker dette!!
Next time, Magnus should wear weights, so you weigh the same
Eddie is so naturally athletic. It’s crazy
These two guys do all exercises with a lot of sympathy and complement each other very well although they come from very different disciplines. nice to watch
Colab with Hannah Meul
@27:45 "Be sure that you check out Eddie on YouTube and Instagram and everything; I mean you're huge there..."  Dude... he's huge everywhere...
13:08 - Did he say "I've literally got more chance of 'effing' King Charles in the 'A'" there? Hahahahhaha I love it.
I like how Magnus's able to put himself into the shoes of these first time climbers and really takes their perspectives seriously, although the grades they find hard are like... nothing to him. (9:14)
@2:32 why do they sell shoe chalk?
spider pig spider pig does what ever a spider pig does Eddie 5:03
I have no interest in climbing. I have no idea how i found this channel. But i do really enjoy your content. Relaxing
“I’m waiting for one to rip off” 🤣
Eddie mentioning Francis is the purest thing. What a fun video! Hope to see you two together again for something, great dynamic.
13:55
Went climbing for the first time yesterday, just managed a v4 before rolling my ankle and needed an x-ray, 10/10 will climb again.
I hope Eddie wasn’t pointing at the guy climbing who felt on his butt
I don't that dude should be doing drops to get down. He will ruin his knees due to the size and weight. He should be using auto belay.
Seeing a guy that big climbing is insane. Mad props to Eddie
Mike Boyd has started climbing now, you need to collab with him!
A guest I would love to see on your channel is The Karate Nerd. Love your content. Cheers.
Why do I think of Eddie as a very very cute and nice man🥹😅
Eddie looks like such a cool guy. Nice video, thanks for sharing
Didn’t expect Eddie to achieve lift off, but he managed it. Good work.
Eddie reminds me of my dad way too much lol
Impressive for such a big guy!
He's not  the World's Strongest Man.
There’s something weird about this guy’s vibe and I can’t quite place it. I felt like magnus was just being used somehow, maybe so this guy could get more followers? Idk but something felt off
Yeah, Imma need this to become a recurring thing; Eddy Climbing.
World's strongest man is a Scot
Hey Magnus! What about arm wrestling? Did you ever try it?
Really appreciate the spidey-pig reference from Eddie.  Real life Homer!
Imagine being told to get off a route, and look round to see Eddie Hall with a BEAST shirt and Mohawk. Bricking it lol
Both Magnus and Eddie seem like such nice guys, good chemistry in this one. Cool video! 👍
Don't do it with the strongest men, do it with Norway's best esportsman, The Viper
For a true beginner that's a great use of feet IMO. You can see how a real understanding of the body as a strongman and bodybuilder can help translate naturally into climbing. Pretty cool.
Good video
I love the mood that Eddie can create
Funny man eddy i love you man 💪🤣❤️
Eddie, Haftor and Brayan Shaw does not neet to climb mountains they are mountains it self
so I guess no one is heavy enough to belay Eddie?
Seriously unexpected collab
Holding his bodyweight on some of those holds is VERY impressive. Well done.
Eddy doing very well. Bravo man. Great watch!!!
I love when he touches his tummy after being called the biggest star he’s had. Lol
Magnus! How about LYNN HILL Greatest of All Time as guest of honor!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When he jumped down I could almost hear his knees screaming "noooooooooo"
The holds during this video:  😣😰😵💀🪦
“You’re stronger than you think”  - Magnus to Eddie Hall, 2023
How much does he weigh?
Yoo this was filmed in Sheffield
6:44 that man dwarfed eddie hall lol
spider pig, spider pig
wow, this guy is really aware of his body, his muscles. His first climb and he can hang well from his arms, swing really well, use his legs.. that's amazing for a beginner! I am impressed. I wish I was this good at my first climb!
When was this taken? This is my local Gym. I missed a chance to see Eddie AND Magnus ?
Hello Magnus, do you only climb or do you also work out like in a gym or calisthenics?
You can see so well that this man is a serious athlete.
I’ve been watching you for years. To see you at the place I go regularly makes me feel very happy. Climbing hanger is awesome
Damn, despite Eddie's big ego and stubborn attitude with a lot of matters, props to him for this performance. I've taken a couple bigger friends climbing and they could barely do V1s, Eddie looks like he managed a couple physical V3s there, and at his weight and body composition that is extremely impressive. Dude is a real athlete, with a very strong grip and pretty good body awareness and confidence to swing for those holds far away and actually latch on. Even him cutting feet a few times and not immediately falling, is already a fest, especially since he could put them back on the wall afterwards. Really great stuff. I have seen plenty of newbies try climbing and not manage to recover once their feet come off, so damn.
They were in a german TV-show together (mentioned 0:43)? I have to see that, what's the name of the show? Maybe "Wetten Dass"?
Glad he’s going into bodybuilding. It’d be awesome if he got ripped
videos like these are always so much fun cus i love to see that such strong (and intimidating) man are just so kind hahaha i love that
This video was amazing 😂
I'm a little disappointed he didn't grab the first two holds and just launch himself to the top with his upper body strength.
Great video, Eddie is such a cool guy! Would be a lot of fun if you linked up with Jesse James West. Lets put him to the test!!
Hello Magnus! Do you support Russia in conflict with ukraine?
Cheers to Edie, worlds strongest rock climber.
you should try with a few kilos attached to your body, to stay at the same weight as him. it must be funny.
Omg, he also goes "no chance"!
I'd like to see the reverse, go into the strong man universe.
@8:49 that's what she said
Spider Man and the Hulk :p
Impressive how different power can looks like. Good colaboration!
Eddie is just amazing
👍
at 6:07 you can see the wall moving :D
Good one Eddy with that weight!
Nice duo really!!
No surprise eddie was a good climber, literally a world class athlete, always hilarious too lol.
Magnus, dere la ut den samme videoen jo
dudes the sean evans of climbing
9:28 I felt Eddie's laugh there 😂
I love watching Eddie do anything. His world strongman achievement against the giants shaw and thor in their prime was ridiculous and should be recognised in this country far more than it is… 💪
15:15 _”Allegedly”_ 😂😂😂
We miss Marte! I hope the best for you and her 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
better than i could ever do......Props. Its harder for bigger guys to do rock climbing
Imagine having Eddie as your brusher during a championship, that smile will steal the show
Proof! World's strongest climber is not worlds best climber, but very entertaining nonetheless
Eddie!  "Move my foot up to there? Do you think I'm a F$%^king octopus!?"  hahaha best climbing line ever. 🤣
Love how Eddie mentioned Francis
I like how yiu shook hands at the end and Eddie's hand made yours like like a child's hand lol.
I’m not a climber but it seems incredible that such a strong individual would struggle so bad at any sport
Imagine what he could do while being thinner. 170kg is no joke.
This was great!
Magnus, I know this is completely unrelated to climbing, but your American accent is getting extremely convincing. Occasionally a few syllables where the Norwegian accent comes out, but some of the harder vowel and consonant sounds you're nailin'.
I rl enjoy watching Eddie he gives such a gentle giant vibe :)
This is my favourite video on youtube
Oi eddie is too funny “can I just grab that one “ no bro you can’t 😂
Wider than tall, it's Eddie Hall!
when he said 370# American -- I stopped and googled 170 kg in lbs
We need a Juji and Eddie speed climb!
James from TGF is recording for Eddie Hall now? lmao wtf
joo, this man really deserves to be called the strongest man on earth
What a couple! ;-)
One of the best videos I've seen
Imagine Eddie Hall wall climbing but he is hydrated
Magnus, obviously you are an incredible and inspirational climber, but I have to give you props for your video productions.  Perfect length, great sound mix, and interesting and fun content.  I'm always happy to watch the latest Magnus Midtbo video.
Damn, his calves are insane
“I’m a fit guy” yeah.. I’d like to see Eddie try rowing with the national team 😅
This just shows how athletic Eddie hall is.
Imagine having to drag 170kg up a wall.
Legend says a properly hydrated Eddie Hall can roll even a cast iron pan like a burrito.
Eddie rocks!!!!
if he started rock climbing on top of what he already does i can’t even imagine the type of beast this man would be
Moves well for a big guy ngl
Awesome video this just proves that strength can be subjective you can be a small stature but really dense mussels over all or big buff and have almost super human strength but most jym or buff bros have neglected mussel groups.
Very cool
Magnus Midtbø looks like a norwish name
Its amazing to think these two are the same species of human...so different.
lol as a british guy i can just tell hes a nice guy in general, just in the way he speaks
Probably still juicing. Once you start is hard to stop.
I don't see Brian shaw, where is he?
Loved Eddie committing light treason part way through the vid 🤣. What a greet guy though. I can't quite fathom how much harder it must be climbing at 170kg!
No professional, but i have tried bouldering and am able to pull myself up with just my hands. Helps to be light!  The impressive thing about these climbers isn't their power, it's their grip strength!  Saw some small asian woman do a route with grips about the size of a pound coin.  I can't recommend bouldering enough. More fun than it looks, requires more thought than you would expect and seeing what these people are capable of in person is far more impressive than from a video.  Only been a couple of times with my daughter - wish i found it when i was young. Chill environment and (unlike the gym) you don't find people going there to just look pretty and try to show off.
What a wholesome and funny video! I really enjoyed it.
Wondering seeing the introduction bit... if Magnus could bend and roll up a frying pan.
nearly pissed myself laughing when eddie started singing spider pig hahahaha
Magnuses forearm is bigger than his bicep holy fuck.
next hold is good
Hahaha great video! Eddies such a character 😀
So how many of us searched “Turkish getup world record” straight after this 😅
I've been waiting for this👌
I have no seen a bloody Rhino climb, lifegoals
Yummy.  With salt and butter.  A slice of this Beast...  Let's call the, Windigo psychosis upon You.
Eddie's calves are insane
Magnus would be awesome if you make a climbing video with Levan Saginashvili !!!
“Fookin’ hell” 😂😂
everyone knows earth is not flat but its def not a bal
Eddie is a fitness guy and is shook that climbing gets his lungs working (breathing heavy) who would have thought that would happen?!
Those initial gray holds looks like… well you know
I remember doing rock climbing with rope in highschool. Watching Magnus do this makes me want to do it again, I really did enjoy doing it back then.
I wonder if Magnus could climb as much as Eddie with a weight vest that makes him the same weight… 😅
he`s actually a natural, just wrong weight..
As a first time viewer, what happens if Magnus matches weight with a backpack or belt weights - I'm just super interested in the weight handicap
This was equally awesome and terrifying because I kept expecting his knees to snap when he lands on the mat. :(
Watching Eddie climb like a spider on the orange had me rolling 🤣😂
Video idea: a common test of strength (at least where I’m from) is whether or not you can open a given jar or lid someone else cannot .. work with that. I bet you could open some serious jars. Maybe some famously hard to open jars 🤷🏼‍♂️
Magnus: "See, you just lean in really close to the wall" Eddie's abs: "bet"
Edie Hall is such a likable person
I'm also 100kg lighter than Eddie... yet he's probably better than me at climbing.
I guess my question of how well a grizzly bear can rock climb has been answered
I have a feeling Eddie is one of those people that is good at everything physical.
You should try to "FC" (full combo) a climbing gym. In that you would do every single climb in the gym and try to do all of them first try. You could start a higher difficulty than like v1 though, since all of those would be timewasters.
Just love seeing these big guys, the strongest ones on the absolute rate, getting surprised by climbers effective strength :) Eddie is funny and good guy!
Instalike
Eddie , the beast , the force emaning from this giant piece of man would be enough to make Darth vader shiver in his boots , what an impressive guy he is , excellent job . and also awesome video magnus , top climbing content creator of our era no doubt
you forgot to mention that he got fucked by Thor in boxing...
At 3:52 could someone explain to me as to why he doesn’t use his legs as much as his hands? 🤔It would seem counterproductive since I’ve been told using legs enables us to anchor our weight and therefore not use as much energy if you had just used your hands.
Eddie switching to bodybuilding is really not a smart move. He could choose to cut, focus on a healthy lifestyle, maybe get some Wim Hof inspiration idk — instead he chooses the _naturel_ trenbaloney ham sandwiches, heavily associated with bodybuilding, increasing his disposition to cardiac dysrythmia and/or infarctions. smh
Imagine projecting one of the black climbs at this gym for weeks and then you watch Magnus roll up and flash it like it was a 5a
For his size. He is doing good
Nice too see Eddie collab with you Magnus
I'm noticing your snap chat covers have pictures of people that aren't in your video like Kali Muscle. If I see another click bait like that again I'm unsubscribing to all your channels are report you.
I havent seen his this happy hahaha
That looks so fun wish I had a place like that near me
6:26 "You're stronger than you think" saying this to the strongest man
приємні хлопці
lol i tried to do a turkish get up with 16 kilos yesterday and couldn't get off the floor
Thanks for the great content brother.
oh look, the man that train hard for something challange the other man that train hard for something.  this is entertaining indeed.
I love the fact how mainsteam different types of training has become, i remember clearly about only 10 years ago people who where climbing as adults where thought of as they had "not let go their past self" and because of that where looked down upon. Similarly with arm wrestling, all people thought you where odd and weird if you did it or said "oh i didn't know that, must be niche sport" but today you still get the "oh cool didnt know" but more people are say "oh yes! I've seen Devon Larratt!". And if I'm being honest i think this is in most part due to the efforts of you, jujimufu, Devon Larratt and the many others who show that doing different stuff can be cool and fun. So you have my heartfelt thanks to your contribution to that effort and as a Norwegian i am immensely proud that you are one of our role models.
You are SO GOOD at climbing just using arms no legs that it literally looked like you had a cable attached to your your traps!
The military shit got a little propaganday.
High body weight is definitely not in your benefit when you want to climb anything.
Eddie didn't misremember the Turkish Getup world record. According to the Guinness World Record website, on 9 January 2022 the Canadian Chris Cox lifted 76.56 kg that way. The web entry has a photo and the adjustable dumbbell he's using just looks ridiculous.
nice, Eddie! this is my favourite video i think, where you bring someone from a different athletic discipline
What a great pair of personalities. Very fun to watch you two together, and see two different examples of maximum human capability.
The way eddie just bulldozers someone off the blue. "We're on here mate" No chance he was arguing back 😂😂
I cannot describe how relieved I feel that even this unbelievably strong person at some point looses his grip-strength. It makes me feel SO MUCH BETTER about myself lol
@18:22 😂😂😂 Magnus awkwardly laughs
Need to get Robert oberst in there to
Awesome
170kg. Fuck off that's 100kg more than me
I started bouldering about 4 months ago and it's genuinely encouraging to see someone as fit and strong as Eddie experiencing the same sort of issues as me. I mean I weigh about a quarter of what he does, but still.
Lol Magnus is just like me. We both just answer "yup" when people thank us.
what's this sound on 6:04 ?
That's ridiculously impressive. Imagine someone with that mass pulling some of those moves off. I think it's the brute strength and strongman grip element.
It's like watching an elephant climb up those weak attic stairs.
Magnus - it would be really interesting to see you trying to climb with a weight jacket on, how many kilo's could you add before it became a real struggle to climb. You weigh 70kg, could you still climb if you weighed 170kg like Eddie?
This guy is great, love his personality! And I also love that, as great as Magnus is, he doesn’t look down on anyone’s climbing level at all
respect for Eddie to do this. Real sports man
Lmao Eddie Hall is a damn BEAST he did an amazing job for his body weight and size, because he definitely has the absolute WORSE body structure possible for rock climbing 😂  I’m so surprised how well he did I salute 🫡 you sir!! Absolutely amazing job!
Eddie: "fuvkingBEEEEEEP"  MAGNUS: "yeah..."
BIGBOYS IMPACKT SOUND AT 6:13 dam he felt that landing .
Eddie seems like a really nice guy.  It blows me away that he is such a strong swimmer.
Very impressive actually
Dude is an absolute UNIT! Shoutout to Eddie for being such a good sport and getting out of his comfort zone. Cheers
Magnus is the guy you call when you can't open a jar
Props to Eddie for how well he did
ROIDS... ROIDS... ROIDS...
hellllllllllllll yes
Francis burgeous
Great visualization of pure strength compared to strength/weight ratio.
Magnus: You are stronger than you think 🤣🤣 Then u look to the guy 6:27
Tried claiming for the 3 time in my life and realized why your so fit. Keep it up Magnus your one of my favourite channels out here!
I never was an Eddie fan until I watched the Strongest Men, or Man, on History channel. I loved that series and even watched it twice. Those guys are so endearing and real. Now I'm a huge fan of all four.
1:45 “if you look at these holds”, pausing, looking into his eyes while holding the 🍆 shaped hold. “That’s… that’s what you like, right?”
Eddie's such a cool genuine fella.  Thanks for getting him On.
His calves are crazy
honestly it would be pretty cool if we see eddie really take climbing as a hobby, looks like hes having alot of fun
Hay it's Eddie 'wild overhand right' Hall!
I think this just shows how insanely strong strongmen are, it's difficult to gauge if you're not into lifting and have a load of numbers thrown at you.  Have to say, Magnus should be wearing a shirt with "Beast" on it too!
This was seriously amazing to watch! Eddie is a true beast
can we get an eddie vs halfthor climbing challenge?
Can you get both Martin Odegaard and Erling Haaland to your climbing gym during their off season? Make them challenge each other would be entertaining
Do you even know how dead you'd be if Eddie fell and landed on you? lmao imagine the thud...
How can a forearm be bigger than the bizeps,trizeps ?
You mentioned "locking the grip". I was a stone mason for 6 years or so, and I experienced the same thing through that work. I don't have high squeezing strength, but I can keep my hands locked with a high amount of resistance behind them. I've never been rock climbing; maybe it translates?
this is my climbing gym, as if !!!
The man on the moon got me laughing everytime, such a simple but effective gimmick
As I guy who mainly does weights but took up climbing recently, I can confirm this is a spot on example of what it's like and I'm no Eddie!
Crazy Performance 👍 I really hope Eddie dont get injured by falling down or jump to hard in his knees 🙏❤️🥳
This was awesome to watch. Loved the humor and Eddie did go hard, mad respect!
Its crazy seeing such a massive man climbing a wall like that, insanely impressive
And almost lost his life after 500kg !
Isn't @brianshaw stronger than Eddie hall? So how's Eddie the world's strongest?🤣🤣🤣
I'm super impressed with Eddie! He's got a better chance of being a climber then a bodybuilder haha
Two of my favourite athletes collabing, LOVE THIS VID!
What a great guy <3
Damn dudes an animal. To do what he just did at his weight /muscle mass is crazy. This video was awesome.
I think that it would make a really interesting challenge video for Magnus to add weight to himself with weighted vests and things, to then try climbing at the weight of Eddie
Amazing!
Got to try the grip strength with Eddie some time
“I wanna be like that guy over there”  That guy proceeds to fall seconds later
saw Eddie thumbs up without any doubts
Imagine having to spot Eddie on a fall lol
Magnus you should definately contact Jesse James West and collab with him that would be so awesome
damn he did pretty well
Impressive seeing that much climbing.
Magnus it would be great if you could go to Poland and do some videos with Mariusz Pudzianowski 5 time World's strongest man and currently the MMA figther. He's more athletic guy than Eddie (respect for him). It would be great to see him on the wall. There's also strong climbing community in Poland e.g. Aleksandra Mirowska - world record holder for fast climbing and other persons.
I went to a deadlift workshop today, watched Eddies record lift. Then go home and see this. Pure gold!
Hanging L-sit to a front leaver is kind of a big jump there
I'm used to seeing him next to Brian where he looks small. Now he looks big haha.
eddie is such a good guy. he is also good in swimming apart from the powerlifting and now also climbing
As a fan of both of you guys this absolutely made my day! Now for a climbing comp between Eddie Hall, Brian Shaw, Robert Oberst, and Nick Best feat. Magnus!!!!!! That would be awesome! 🤘🏽
Be fun to see Magnus try and climb with weights strapped to him to bring him to 170kg :)
It's weird seeing so many people say "impressive for a first climb". Man he literally weighs 170 kilos! That is crazy no matter how many times he's climbed.
1 thing about eddie is he puts 110% into everything. Magnus is such a good teacher really enjoyed this video thanks guys
Where is this gym?
I was just thinking about how the 2 of you should do a colab like a week ago, and here it is! Better than I'd imagined. Thank you
Least powerful Northerner
Magnus seems like he is genuinely in fear of giving any criticism about climbing to Eddie… I can’t blame him
if anyone has a right to wear a *BEAST* shirt, it's this dude
The content I didn't know I needed until it popped up, this is awesome!
I believe Magnus created a new climber that day. :)
There's something really funny about Magnus telling Eddy "You're stronger than you think" at 6:26 🤣
For a future video try asking The Rock to climb a rock with you
When Eddie jumps down the floor shakes
Eddie Hall has such massive mental strength. He asks many questions and thinks through all sorts of aspects to whatever he tries to accomplish. I really admire his stick-to-itiveness and willingness to try new past-times, it's very inspiring. Initially one would imagine that a man his size would have a hard time at a sport like Rock Climbing, but he proved to be very capable. Awesome vid!
Couple of very likeable dudes and good content (as they call it!) again.
Strongest man in the world ???  😄😃 when did he done that ?? 🤔🤔🤔 top 10, surely not the strongest
Great video!!
Yeah no shit it gets your lungs - you're lugging 170kg up the wall!
Lol…dude has a great sense of humor too!
2 of my favorite youtuber athletes, best COLLAB ever! What a treat!
8:42 I'm pissin' in the wind e' mate  -Eddie Hall 2023
To be fair, Magnus should have been wearing a 100 kilo vest to even out the force being lifted, at the very least.
Eddies Calves are insane !
I think Eddie teaches us alot about strong men. To lift yourself (170kg) up a wall without much or any experience is really inspiring.
i cant wait to learn how to rock climb and strengthen my grip and increase my flexibility
That was really impressive. I mean the guy is 170kg.. Imagine trying to do a pull up with 170kg strapped to you let alone climing a wall.
As someone who climbed a bit from the 1980s to late 1990s (when my son was born), I’ve long known they climbers and gymnasts have the best power to weight of any athletes.   Far superior to the strength guys, even though the raw power may not be there. It’s much more functional than the strength athletes but not as impressive to the general viewer.
You don’t have to put the kettlebell upside down like that in a Turkish get up. You won’t get the same wrist stabilisation but you can still get the same benefits for the rest of the body and you’ll generally be able to do it with heavier kettlebells
Eddie being 170 kg's wearing a shirt saying "BEAST" is zero indication of what kind of personality he's got; such a cool guy and entertaining as hell! Well done on breaking out your comfort zone
8:10 those calves! Are you kidding me? Jeeeez....
"BLOOOODY HEILL" 😂
Would love to see a collab with Wim Hof, The Ice Man!
His focus and familiarity with his own body really shows by advancing so quickly on his first day.
I love Eddie’s personality 😁😄
My man says he's a rather fit guy. Respect.
"I'm pissing in the wind here mate!" haha clasic
Eddie is just great. This was so fun to see.
Omg been following eddie for a while now specially his bodybuilding since he started! Would love for him to react to your free climbing video!! 💥💥🔥🔥
he is from my city Stoke-On-Trent bro he is soo big irl its mad great guy :)
370 pounds climbing like that??? Crazy 😂
Grizzly bears dont climb
Great collab!
Good show!
Simple strength to weight ratio the little guy will always win these type competitions. No surprise
hey Magnus i wanna see you do a video with Chris Sharma climb together that would be an awesome video
Eddie Hall is just a very strong soccer hooligan
Eddie fr crushed it for never climbing!!
Magnus you should be in a Hollywood movie- something about you has that quality. Also, you a re good at the editing of the video, maybe you could do "human interest" style pieces to mix up the content a little. B roll and interviews . stories
Have to do something similar with Brian Shaw if you ever get back to the states
That’s impressive for a man that’s 400 lbs.
Eddy Hall did amazing. The best video I saw of Eddy was when he picked his son up from school in an armoured personal carrier.  Eddy made his day and had a great afternoon out with his boy.
no way... black looks way easier than the other ones. maybe i just like climbing shit but that one looks so fun.
Love that it costs $22 near LA
FUCK YEAH! GO EDDIE!!!
What are the V grade equivalents of these colours??
man his shoes sound so slippery
He is amazing! I stopped activly climbing when i was 95-96kg. Now, when i'm 104-105kg i'm struggling more than Eddie when i go now and then to the gym.
If you close your eyes it's like Eddy's giving birth.
Eddie is such a great sport when he tries something new athletic-wise.  And he usually excels!
finaly some real strongman o/ well done for both o/
Honestly, big props to Eddie for doing so well. That's a whole lot of human going against gravity 😅
Bro said fuck king Charles, w statement
This was so much fun to watch! Eddie is a natural climber. I hope he keeps climbing because I would love to see a part 2 with his insane progression! I wonder if he could have even climbed a little harder with smaller shoes.
Great vid
The guy is 100kg heavier than me. I don't think I could even get up off the floor with that much extra weight, let alone climb. Great effort!
eddie hall is a beast, the vídeo was great but i think we need more content of you climbing outside. For real man
That’s an idea Magnus, try climbing in a weighted vest, weighted ankle straps and weighted wrist straps. As much as reasonably safe since it can be dangerous.
LOL!!!   Awesome collab!!!
Eddie is so lucky to get to stand next to Magnus!!!
Love that line “gets to the lungs”
Awsome video!  Two of my favourite content creators in the same video. Keep it up Magnus!
Eddie's Calves look massive as he climbs!
As a recreational lifter and climber, I can confirm, it's not easy being good at both. In constant turmoil as to how big my legs should be 😄🦵 Followed both you guys for years now, love the content of both ❤️💪
I was half expecting Eddie to pull the wall down instead of pulling himself up when he climbed
ngl the sheer mass of the guy had me worried. The larger you get the more careful you have to be with falls. Even with the pads, It would be pretty easy for him to break something. High impact and high mass is a scary combo.  I'm sure yal had plenty of precautions though.
imagine walking in miding your own business and eddie falls on you
What a wholesome video.
Wait, when is the Eddie Hall x Francis Bourgeois Trainspotting crossover happening?
well, Magnus your forearm was not significantly smaller than Eddie's actually
Pretty amazing. I knew his grip strength was obviously through the roof but I expected the holds to be a little less forgiving. Holding his body weight on those blue holds on the first try was pretty damn impressive 😂
What an entertaining guy to have in a video! Made me laugh!
How VR players think rock climbing works: 4:05
Actually rly impressed
and if Eddie got Magnus on his video liftin he would be shocked how strong Magnus is.
He actually did pretty good for being such a big guy who has never climbed
I love eddi watch him all the time
I haven’t even seen the video yet but I have a feeling it’s not going to go well for the big guy. Not the body type for climbing it doesn’t matter how strong you are.
Ok, now put that vest on you used with Juji to balance your weight difference 😁 170kg Magnus vs 170kg Eddie.
I love the vids. But seriously guys every f*** 2 mins is advertisement for 2 mins. That’s not enjoyable. I know I know you need to do to earn some cash but that’s too much.
What a nice guy.  Nice pair of guys!
Always had a lot of respect for Eddie, but I didn't think he'd be able to climb. Surprised how well he did! And he did it all in front of a camera with no practice 😅 top guy
that shows the difference between practical and gymboy strength, and also why i have never trained for mass gain
Eddie did surprisingly well!  He should come back and try this again after he has cut down to his competition weight so we can see how much he improves by being lighter.
This was a good one. You guys work well together.
Impressed Eddie was able to free hang at 370lbs as well as he did.  Incredible strength.
alternative title: (Spiderman teaches the Hulk how to climb) ps: I could only describe your insane strengths by likening you to super heroes, sorry if it seemed a bit crass....
Fun video 😄👍
so... Magnus does Strongmen with Eddy when?
I got so scared when he was on top, you guys didn't use any ropes
You can immediately tell that Eddie is just a born natural and professional athlete. He manages to do well even in a sport that should be anathesis to him.
Eddies calves man!
This was honestly so wholesome
you´re stronger than you think :)
What a great video. These two would make a great cop duo film.
Just remember guys, they put a man in the moon
10:59 "We set your expectations too low"            "Yeah everyone does that"  Felt that... Sadge
Love that all my favorite athletes are getting together in these crossovers.
This was amazing. My first touch to bouldering was really similiar. My friend tutored me and my physique being like small version of Eddie I could immediately say hes grip will fail first. Exactly the same for me with similiar bodytype. I couldnt squeeze empty plastic bottle afterwards. It feels like the forearm muscles cant fit into your skin, the pump is unreal.
That suttle joke @1:47, Im sure he appreciated that lol
18:25 just imagine, you go to your climbing gym, completly in your own world, and you just hear behind you a voice telling you: we were here first, you turn around and see one of the biggest human beings on earth...
both funny guys :)
Eddie hall is really sweet when you see him in these sorts of videos, what a British icon.
Damn look at Edie’s calves 😱
Kyriakos Grizzly can climb it without hands!
Absolutely stunned Eddie was able to get off the floor on the blue run!
this is such BS - obviously he's climbed before
13:55  Magnus's life flashed before his eyes
Eddie hall is great man i love this dude
Hahah this guy is hilarious, one of my fave episodes so far
Eddie’s calves are the size of my quadriceps
is it just me or you can just hear "fucking hell" in the bleeps
I think that Eddie is going to be at a natural disadvantage because of how big he is, it's going to make it a lot harder to get close to the wall but he's doing really well for someone who has never climbed and certainly did better than I could do xD
14:38 and 15:26 he got it right back. i love it
Should try to collab with storror if possible
Next video magnus has a 100kg vest?
All you needed to do to push eddie a bit more was say Thor would’ve done it 😂
First timer with all that heavily developed muscle and weight he really surprised me on that blue he's not world strongest man for nothing!
Spiderman verse the Bulk,, fair play looks like big fella has lost weight
It's mad impressive watching someone 170kg climbing this well! Also when they compared forearms the difference isn't actually that much at all considering the size difference of the rest of their bodies, showing what absolute units magnus' forearms are
King Kong lmao
Shaw is like 4 of magnus...
You know, I think the difficulty-scaling is a bit off when you weigh upwards of 100kg more than those they had in mind when they made it. Incline difficulty is definitely notably harder than the label suggests.. It's easy to get a big head when you see a man like Eddie Hall 'struggle' on these relatively easy levels(not saying I'd be able to do it), but if you just look at every move as "he's now lifting 170kgs in that position" it gets *pretty insane*, like with the start of the first blue route. It's genuinely amazing to see how well he can move despite very much having a build not known for movement range and flexibility. The fact that he lasted as long as he did on the purple despite not being able to get his centre of gravity *nearly* as close to the wall as almost all other climbers was just astounding.
können wir jurz appreciaten, dass die beiden in der Deutschen TV Show einfach ein Mühlenkölsch Bierdeckel auf dem Tisch liegen haben? hahaha Grüße an alle Kölner ;)
370 pounds and I watch MMA and thought Francis was huge Eddy 370 that's scary
Why do you still use WSM in your titles when you’re no longer that?
Next time Magnus needs to wear a 100kg weight vest to even it up
"This guy used to carry rocks for a living but will he be able to climb them?" That last introduction punchline was top-notch! Very good job!
"Don't put a limit on what I can do, because I'll prove you wrong every single time." - Eddie Hall
The collab I wanted for years!!!!
What a nice guy
Just awesome !!!
Eddie is such a cool dude
Gorilla
up next: shaquille o'neil does an 8a with his feet still on the ground
"You are stronger than you think" Yeah of course, Eddie Hall is stronger than he thinks   (I know it was referred to climbing but that was still funny)
people underestimate the importance of technique and comprehention... in allot of the climbs eddy would not have made it... but he told eddy how to do it... figgering it out yourself is the hard part, because thinking takes time... and time is fatigue and endurance is climbing. think of it this way... i c'ant pozition a cue ball in snooker.... but if i haid a pro player standing next to me, telling me were to hit the cue ball, how hard and how to hit the shot i could do it...u need to understand it to be able to do it.
Magnus is a goat. Not as in greates of all time (that too)  But like, a literal goat 🐐
Eddie Hall did a good job, I think he could try free solo in a couple weeks.
I am fully convinced that Eddie is just doing side quests at this point, he is everywhere
"If you want to be the best climber in the world, you're probably best chopping your legs off."  I laughed so hard.
Pudzian is worlds strongest man, this is but impostor
Gotta give a hand to Eddie, him and Devon Larratt last year fundamentally put an abrupt end to me ever spending any money on "sports" ever again  What a meme
Im so impressed with Eddie. Can we get Brian to do it?
this proofs my point when I say climbing is not all about strength when EVERYONE tells me: "I'm not strong, I couldn't climb" (when they are fit)... otherwise Eddie would be the best climber in the world
love it how wholesome Eddie is!
One thing here Magnus, i admit you are a way better climber than I'll ever be but the comment about having your legs as light as possible is a little bit misguiding. Legs are used a lot in climbing, and still have our strongest muscles. Also, in order to stick to the wall or do crazy drop knees you need quite some power. So I think the comment about a guy sitting in a wheelchair to loosen weight in his legs is just absurd.
anyone know what german tv show they were on in 2012??
This video is so wholesome. You’re a great teacher! And those turkish getups at the end are insaneeee
I'm absolutely floored by how well Eddie climbed these walls. Such incredible displays of strength.
Watching Eddie boulder is like watching a bear climb up a tree. You'd think it's impossible, and yet...
It is so sick seeing you include Eddie in your videos Magnus! You are both so strong, it is fun watching the two of you climb. Thank you for showing us how things are done.
Back in the steel city I see!! You should go to the Works or Depot if you haven't already 😄
Love juji but I think eddy beat juji
11:50 Funny he uses "beta", but coming from oldschool competitive games we always called it "meta". Beta kind of makes sense, but betas are usually not as good as the finished/updated product. I don't intuitively know why we used the word meta, and why it's not more common to just say "standard" or "optimal".
Amazing content, both of you are big names in your sports, and it's awesome to see you work together like that.
Alternate video title- Torque vs Horsepower
Get with juju and Eddie to get Brian Shaw on
When a strongman tries climbing the wall of your house to get to your protein shake.  170kg and doing so well. Can see that insane strength.  Awesome video btw!
I’ve never climbed in my life and don’t really aspire too but these video’s always catch my attention and will forever keep watching them 😆
Man Eddie has wicked calves!
After watching your videos for a few years, I am now a member with my family at my local climbing gym. Thanks Magnus!
You need to be the Joe Rogan of mixed athletics. Just keep inviting different top tier athletes to climb with you. Super fun to watch. Try a dancer next, like ballet. Or maybe a fencer. This should be a whole thing. I'd watch all day XD
Big props to Eddie. Really gave it his all and was honestly so impressive for a first climb
Eddie's such a nice guy, it's cool. Great colab.
I say you have eddie come back in a year about 2 weeks after his contest prep!! He will be at his slimmest! He is still in his bulking faze now, for bodybuilding. Great fun to watch!
2:10
Not bad at all. Looks like he can do about v3. I'm a 220lb climber and I'm already 50lbs heavier than the average male climber and I spin out holds sometimes. Eddie has to be like 300lbs. (I googled it, 170 kilos is 374 pounds) Dude those holds are NOT meant for that. I spin them sometimes at 220 lbs when I get all my weight on just one lmao. He probably cracked a few of the holds. Hilarious to watch this as a bodybuilding enthusiast who can deadlift 500 pounds and after a year of climbing I can only occasionally get v5's. Weight is such a huge factor when your hanging by your finger tips. Tog et a v3 at almost 400 pounds, monster strength.
Very cool. Funny watching such a big guy do this. Pretty good for a guy with his bulk who hasn't conditioned his muscles to do this kind of stuff but he did pretty well imo. I definitely couldn't do this!
I love that as Eddie points to the guy climbing and says "in about an hour that's going to be me" the guy falls off the wall. Talk about timing!!!!😂😂😂
I was super impressed with Eddie here. That must be hard with both mass to carry and bulk preventing the close possitions required to climb these things.
God Almighty is stronger then you Man😊

It feel like it affects your longs because of EPOC effect. When you do anaerobic effort, it’s like you need to pay a debt of O2 after that effort 🙂
Really cool to see this two awesome athletes and just easy going lads working together... this is better than a Marvel-DC crossover 😁👏👏👏👌
Awesome video 👍
Bro I'm Turkish and how have I never heard of this?!?!
I honestly feel like Magnus doesn't know hwo to climb in theory, he's just been so good for so long. Ed just struggled with the last one because he didn't lean into the advantage of the sloper and Magnus, didn't say anything about it.
What a freaking great collab! 🙂
Good work magnus, always a great show!!!
I found myself smiling throughout this entire video
Eddy is super impressive for his first time at his size! He's obviously strong, but he picks up technique fast and his perseverance is off the charts!
Mad respect to Eddie for being a real athlete and doing this kind of stuff. That is A BIG GUY to be climbing. He did way better than I thought he would and he wasn't wimping out
Big guys shouldn’t climb. You will get injured. It’s a game for small and light people
I asked for this video on your last vid, but I'm sure you had this planned before that though!
Honestly Eddie's ability at rock climbing is incredible even without the size he's carrying.
8:18 the dude's calfs are INSANE
OMG, this was great!  Seeing Eddie doing the moves and getting farther than expected.   Brought a smile to my face :)
Rockstarr
I love this channel.
Eddie, nice
It's like a warrior trying to be a rogue.
does eddie get halfway up the wall and the entire thing just slowly falls forward?
Is Magnus wearing the pants from his clothing store or are they something else? They look super nice to climb in
Thor would beat those walls in 1 sec earlier
You should find a 100 kg vest or something to climb with and see how you do
he's so jolly, it's like a strongman santa energy
Me too: "I'm gonna be like that guy" *guy falls*
"The things people do to win a gold medal" says the man who lifted weights so heavy he had memory loss for days afterwards because of the strain on his body and brain
8:17 it was fun, great colab Magnus 8:52
It would be so cool if you brought Magnus chase ( the chess guy)  on the channel!
What a lovely chap.
😂😂 @ 8:20 I was thinking the same thing as he said it. Htf
My eyes couldn't believe that thumbnail  Literally, I had to process you two in the same pic for a sec
I wonder how much tendon strength plays in rock climbing? I heard that in arm wrestling bigger muscles do not necessarily determine a win.
Props to eddie here, having that much weight on the wall makes it so much more difficult regardless of the strength alongside the lack of flexibility when you build so much mass.  Can't wait to send this to my friend who is 25st as motivation to continue climbing.
I love him hes nice honest and genuinly funny .. i would turn gay for him
I just got a ad of David laid being used for a electric Ab pad scam. And I spent 5 mins laughing my ass off 💀💀💀like they genuinely believe this would work in tricking consumers. David laid gotta sue whoever is using his likeness lmao.
I've been climbing for about 7/8 months and he really hit that sit start much better than me. SIT STARTS ARE EVIL
Obese climbers generally don't have the upper body strength for climbing, but *if they did* they would encounter extreme strain on knees in the jump-down.  This guy is in the novel position to experience that health problem  - that muscles scale under training to higher forces than tendons/ligaments/joints do - which also extends to shoulders and hands.  Get your muscles strong enough and you can really hurt yourself.
*allegedly
But Eddie was going to tear down the whole wall.
This is probably the funniest co-climbing video you've made. Impossible that 170kg can do that but Eddie never gives up. The way he climbs with his body is the same I am climbing with your bodyweight. So amazing to see what he can do and it is always amazing to see how you fly up the walls without almost any effort.
I enjoyed this, the strongest man wasnt cocky, he was eager to learn and was impressed with Magnus.  Just goes to show how different sports bodies are!
really enjoyed this one :)
When Eddie was at the top of the orange the first time and when he moved to the blue, I laughed out loud because it’s so relatable being a big guy in such an unfamiliar spot 😂 magnus, your collabs are just an awesome way to see Herculean type people become so real. Nothing fake is happening, it’s like I’m there with you guys
1:46  that's what you like right? * winks *
Fun video, not your normal guest! Very impressive from Eddie. I wish you'd done the strength challenges you did against the Norwegian strongman recently though.
Imagine what Eddie could have done if he was hydrated ?
I'd love to know if Eddies forearms/fingers were sore the next day
Eddie hall used to be cool
damm i wanna rock climb but the place they got here is so expensive to use  might try doing the old tree climbing
Magnus is like your friend or brother teaching you something new.
What was the highest grade that he managed? The blue one
Dude, I was a 1 year old when you met that… “famous star” that your talking ‘bout
Eddie was very impressive. It is no joke hauling 170kg up a wall. Great episode as always.
It's insane to see someone this big climbing. I'm impressed by him
Cool
Can’t wait for the end of the video… I am cracking up so much and it’s only 12 minutes in 😂
Tried climbing today first time it was nice all thanks to your videos keep up the great work
0:43 they look 10 years younger than how they looked 10 years ago 💀
Waiting for a collaboration with Ross Edgley now!
This is a great ad for climbing holds, they survived not being ripped in half by eddy hall 😂
500kg deadlifter climbs ? Awsome awsome. I HOPE magnus will deadlift with mr. Hall ;-)
Gonna need 3 baleys if he get too high.
E
lol going from l-sit to front lever is QUITE a jump
Always nice to see cross-discipline vidéos ! We could even imagine an "equal load" chalenge with  an addition of one hundred kg on Magnus ? Oo'
Eddie is a monster! He climbed so well for his size.
If Eddie Hall and Magnus Midtbø had a traveling series I’d totally binge it. They would make an awesome duo as soon as Magnus loses his fear of Eddie😂
That's actually crazy to think about. Eddie Hall is probably the strongest human to have ever existed in the entirety of human civilization since the dawn of time.
His weight is against him now 🤦🏼‍♂️
For as huge of a guy Eddie is, it really looks like he has good instincts. I'm curious how far he can take himself climbing.
Try not to explode his heart
is it only me or does magnus have a similar voice to casey neistat?
Åæø
Very impressed with Eddie's use of his legs when climbing. Usually I have to coach that pretty heavy.
Eddie Hall is so strong! Imagine if he wasn’t dehydrated as well
I am from the same nation as Magnus
"I didn't have the balls to tell him" but... you did tell him
Been waiting for this! Love them both...❤
Absolutely perfect form on the Turkish get up boys!
Lets go
Magnus did that kettlebell thing with 16 kilos. That's incredible.
Get that big man som water. He looks so dehydrated!
I think Brain Shaw would be as much fun as Eddie to watch climb with you. He is bigger than Eddie and just as humble.
yee
it actually is funny to see someone who is able to lift 500 kilo having trouble lifting his own body.
ARGHH YOU SLAG  🤣😆💀😄
its good to see ed reaching new activities it really says that anything is possible
Turkish get ups seem like a good way to get your head dented in.
i'm impressed at Eddie going into the unknown like that, i fully expected him to not even get off the ground at his weight, he's strong i know but look at a pro climbers weight 100kg or more lighter than him, but...Eddie is a world champion after all and that is why i shouldn't have doubted him. awesome video and Magnus is also a champ.
Eddie's leg weighs the same as Magnus.. impressive seeing him do this 💪
13:27 fricking impressive sit start
Move over, Mr Beast.  There's a new Beast in town...
MedMen Stock Moving up Fast! Set your Family up for Life. Buy MMNFF stock today.....
Genuinely impressed Eddie managed to do some of these moves (I even doubted he'd get that sit-start) but he actually showed quite a good natural, intuitive climbing ability. Good stuff.
8:14 hoooly look at those calves hahahh
I didn't think I would watch all 28 mins but I did, great vid
Legit stellar video, funny, og fint å se to av mine forskjellige verdener blanding
Magnus has never looked so skinny! His strong arms looking like toothpicks next to Eddie's!  You bleeped out most of the F**ks, but you missed a few. 😆
It's either incredibly wise or incredibly dumb to say to that man "You're stronger than you think" hahaha
Who thinks Magnus should climb with different guests all the time? I want to see a Magnus X Will Tennyson or a Magnus X Ross Edgley collab 😂
Great
Eddie seems like a very nice person. Great video as allways.
Eddie hall’a calves ……. 😯
Nice. Eddie’s deadlift how to was such a game changer for me.
holy f*ck. look at that man's calves.
Like watching a water buffalo climbing a wall. Amazing
Would be cool if u had weight vest to match his weight and then climb with him 😮
Hello, Magnus. You are a Norwegian. I believe you are familiar with cross-country skiing. How do you strong in such endurance sports? Or maybe you invite some skiers to check their ability to climb?
Magnus says to the world's strongest man "You're stronger than you think"
It is correct that you take down him for deep investigation...TRUDEAU Is HIM...
It is correct that you take down him for deep investigation...
It is correct that you take down him for deep investigation...
It is correct that you take down him for deep investigation...
Special Eddy has to pass out after ever event.
that jaja was so norwegian
What I learned from this video is if Eddie Hall is chasing me, climb something medium hard.
I want to see more of this.  Good watching.
Damn just wanted to say that eddie is no longer recognizable. Great on you, nice progress
I would love to see a series of videos with Brian Shaw.
Eddie climbs like Magnus does when he tries to look like a beginner.
Much love from the USA, Magnus. I've been following you since you had about 100K subs and I LOVE to see you well over 1.5M. Amazing to see you've received the flood of fans that you deserve!
13:09 Spat my coffee out laughing what a legend!🤣😂
Used to wonder why he took his shoes off between boulders... I guess now I know.
It would be really interesting to see who has the strongest hand grip. I reckon it'd be the rock climber, even though he is 100kg lighter
Fucking hell when he put the camera on his head that was dangerous, there was a standing bar below with the chains, if he falls down he couldve hurt
Pewdiepie had expressed interest in bouldering, but doesn't know what to expect. Maybe you can meet up with him if you'd like to go to Japan.
World's worst boxer vs Rock Climbing
When the zombie apocalypse comes, this is the guy that will rip you in half
Can't wait to see Magnus sending Ross Edgley on top of the wall one day. That would be wholesome.
that chop your legs off got me
As a long time climber, and fan of Magnus and this channel I just wanted to say that I miss the climber's climbing videos. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy all the newer content - especially as it has certainly given public reach to the accessibility and awesomeness of climbing. Its just that as a climber, I would love to see a return of some strict hard bouldering videos. Personally I'd love to see a collaboration with Eric Karlsson bouldering for a crazy difficult set by Nikken - but I would also just love to watch a solid 30 minutes of strenuous bouldering, outdoor, in a gym, or even on a kilter board. Well here's my hope for that to come true! Thanks for all the good climbing content over the years!
They should team up and Fight Crime
Man, I was hoping for all the grip strength testers.
You guys are such a lovely duo! Hoping for more of this collab some time soon <3
this is why i keep saying; deadlifting and strongman power, is dead power. Half a life of powerlifting and he wouldn't be able to hold a ridge for 10 seconds. he can carry 400kg from his glutes and thighs, yet he can't support 170kg from just upperbody strenght... kinda niche power IMO.
That's the combination we didn't expect but definitely enjoyed. Eddie is such an easy-going guy and the whole video was super nice!
my favorite norwegian athlete meets my favorit british athlete :)))))))
Cant blame him, grip strength is on another category of skill.
Going to try the "we're just on here mate..." next time I'm at the climbing hangar and hope that I have the same level of intimidation as Eddie Hall
<3
Eddie and you need to do the grip Strength
He literally said “you’re stronger than you think” to Eddie hall. 😅 classic
Wow, he did so well on that first attempt for blue! Imagine how strong he would have to be to do that at 170 KGs!
Magnus what about coming to visit some polish climbing stars? In warsaw we have got really nice indoor climbing spots!
No no no get Hafþór/the Mountain
My favorite channel on youtube❤so real!!
I've been wanting for so long for yall to get together for a video
Great video 👍. Love Eddie he’s sick a cool genuine nice guy
I do hope for a follow up video of Eddie putting Magnus through a strong man training session!
I went indoor bouldering for the first time this weekend thanks to the inspiration from this channel. For the last climb I attempted, I flashed a V2 which I felt pretty good about!
This was awesome! Thanks guys!
with his weight he is still showing how great athlete he is and everyone who tried climbing knows he did awsome. Thank you for that video guys!
That was so impressive for a heavy first timer.  I was amazed. Love how he kicked the guy out of the wall like it was a gym equipment he was using lol. He was respectful about it but he prolly didnt know theres a different etiquette from a climbing gym to a workout gym. Understandable though
Magnus can now lay claim to the world's strongest man 2017 title
I thin Eddie has a fear of heights
haha this vid has so much positive vibe , gj magnus and beast
13:03 he looks so funny xd
Interesting contrast with the "Turkish get-up"; Eddie just powering up, Magnus using momentum and balance.
There one thing that Eddie and I have in common, tight neck and hamstrings. When they are tight, those big muscles are bigger than the stomach muscles and it stops you loving your legged high
Yeh so Eddie is definitely not 6'3 if Magnus is 5'8
Shoutout to Magnus and Eddie for both being hilarious guys and good sports. Both athletes!
Awesome to see Eddie and Magnus collaborating here.
The shyt Eddie says LMAO
Sorry Eddy but Brian Shaw would reach up to the top block.
Spider pig, spider pig, does whatever a spider pig does. Bloody legend Eddy. Great collaboration gents.
I'm pleasantly surprised by the professionalism of Eddie! Very good and entertaining video.
"I am a fit guy" Made me cry xD i know its true in "i am fit for my size" xD
World's colliding, that I never knew I needed.
I thought the strongest man in the world is  Khan Baba
It is way more impressive to see a 170 kg guy climb than a skinny guy with no legs. Haha.
Rumor has it, Magnus and Eddie is going to be the first to climb to the moon
Good old Eddie, always up for anything! Great vid ta.
I wouldn't be suprised, if it turns out Eddie is a disguised pro climber😂
1 millionth view
Eddie is a horrible human being. A man of mouth and very little deeds
I'm 100 Kg and i went rock climbing the other week and holy moly did my forearms hurt the next day, i was walking around like a grandpa, i'll defs be taking it alot easier next time.
I literally suggested this exact possible colab in the comments a while back lol, super glad to see it happen even probably nobody ever saw that comment :) , was definitely made to be 👍🏻
It looks awkward, but the amount of commitment required to put 170kg on a toe smear with clown shoes is impressive. Mad props to Eddie.
Eddie is a legend, great guy
you could see the toe wiggle making a difference as in probably more difficult, anyhow he did great! awesome to see
You've done a great job finding likeable people to join you in these videos.  Eddie has a great personality, I'd watch more of his climbing adventures.
Magnus carlsen
Something about you is so wholesome man. I really enjoy watching this kinda content. I’ve never climbed a single gym in my life and half the time have no idea what you are talking about but you make very interesting videos and I love watching them. Don’t quit anytime soon man I appreciate what you do for the community
A body builder who can climb is a 🦍
YOOOO never expected the beast and magnus to collab! What a gift!
I'd like to see Eddie train Arm Wrestling.  Bet he'd crush it.
Magnus comparing hand size with other athletes is somehow so wholesome and cute to me. Makes me smile every time. :)
It would have been fun to see Magnus climb with a weight vest to equalize the weight
Eddie get your ass to Awesome Walls Stoke! Awesome facility and good crew!
Juji needs to train Eddie!!!!
Thank you Eddie for converting your weight from kilos to pounds. All I know about kilos is that it's a measurement of cocaine.
Oh wow what a collab! I watch both of you and it’s fun to see how well Eddie actually did.   I also love whenever magnus does these collabs, they think he is lying and bullshitting about not need his legs for a lot the easier stuff lol. 🎉
Wow! Eddie smashed it! Surprising climbing from such a beast of a man!
This vid establishes a “Body Builder” as someone who trains and diets down to compete in a show”. Most “Body Builders” won’t ever make a dime in the sport. Some will find success, make enough to get by. A rare few will find fame, build a “name”, and make 7 figs. 1, only 1, was able to use body building to become an A List celebrity, become Governor of CA, and probably would have been President had he been born here.   I looked into the IFBB’s annual revenue just last week. Didn’t find anything solid, but estimates ranged from $8.5mil-$16mil. Hate to say it, but that ain’t shit. Someone correct me if those numbers are in acueste.  Anyhow…  So, for the most part, body builders do not earn enough from the sport to support themselves and a fam.
Idk if it’s because Eddie is very outgoing and friendly, but this magnus fella just seems like he has no personality whatsoever
I've sooo been waiting for this video!
5:00 was he singing Spider Pig? From family guy?😮
i realize he's quite literally the worlds strongest man, so it's not as though it's dead weight, but the guy weighs just shy of three times by body weight, i can hardly imagine climbing a wall with two more of me clinging to my back.
"You're stronger than you think" Magnus says to the Strongest man in the world
It's all about technique not strength. Fail
Remember when Thor made a joke of him in the ring?
18:24 the communication 😂😂😂
"I'm a fit guy, and that got my lungs" I'm glad he emphasized that he's fit, I might not have noticed otherwise lmao
Nice intro talk ("...he used to carry rocks for a living, but can he also climb them?..") Nice, Magnus, and awesome episode. Thank you, Eddie!!
The next time the worlds strongest men get together they need to have you tag along and instruct them on climbing. Seeing how well Eddie did really makes me wonder how well the other big guys would do.  I also believe he will be practicing this at home now.
This guy seems a bit strong, huh?
Nice to see thors son bounce back and have fun
Easier to get away from him, just come up the mountain a couple 100' he would never make it
That man's calves ARE HUGE
YOu spelled "gravity" wrong.. 😋
“Just remember they put a man on the moon”
Spider pig spider pig, does whatever a spider pig does
He should of just broken the small guy in half! Not because he's small, but because he's probably one of those parkour douche's! 🤷🏿‍♂️😇💪🏿✊🏿👍🏿👌🏿😁🫨🫡
I would assume he isn't good at rock climbing.
Hes so buff he has the dexterity of a fat guy...
Do you ever train at Skullerud climbing club?
Great video, Magnus! So well done and fun to watch Eddie do what he did and see him experience it with your coaching.
Well done Eddie, true athlete. I wouldn’t be able to do it and I’m half your size.
This guy doesn’t climb the rocks, he pushes the whole mountain down
I don't even do climbing nor I am really interested in it, in fact I don't know why youtube suggested this originally, but the no non-sense and good material makes this very watchable and interesting, might as well give it a try.
two of my favourite people to watch at the moment, suddenly doing a video together, how did they know 🤔
He really just told the world’s strongest man “your stronger than you think” with a straight face 😂
What an unexpected crossover, great video as always!
I’m pissin into the wind here mate! Hahaha
Eddie Hall is fucking insane.
Thats keen!  Im pissin in the wind.  Innit! Love the british vernacular
Chimpanzee vs Gorilla at Rock Climbing. the Greatest Duo
Every video you make is a level better! Love it! Not sure about Eddies custom made shoe fitment though 1:07😅
11:48 I was actually at the gym and a buddy of mine asked me what "beta" stood for. A little perplexed, I simply told him I was not sure. At that very moment I looked up and one the more experienced climbers who was smiling overhearing us. He told us they used to record each other solving problems with Betamax recorders. (dude musta been 60 something)
Rock Climbing would probably be really good for Eddie.  Being that bulky I'm sure he could use the stretch from it.  He probably felt sore in a good way after this day.
Eddie Hall doesn’t go to the wall, the wall goes to him.
Please more videos with Eddie. The energy in this video was so addicting to watch. Two awesome top notch people. Both have reached the peaks of their disciplines. Both wonderful entertainers in the retirement. Both insane athletes. It only made sense for this to happen eventually
Climbing using your LEGS is more important..... Its not all about brute strength lol
I thought Thor held that title?
Eddie is so good at almost everything physical.  Such a great competitive spirit.
Great video! Did Eddie show up in his street legal tank? Another idea is to do a grip strength video with strong man Brian Shaw.
Watching Eddie do large spans and then even starting on slopers is nuts
Eddie is agile for such a big man 👍 Props.
Not everyday you say to the world strongest man “you are stronger than you think you are”
I'd really like to see you climb toge with STORROR!
You should get Jason Mamowa on here
Rock climbing and dead lifts, pulling planes takes different skill sets.
You should do more videos together!
Imagine Magnus strapping 200lbs to his body and trying to climb a wall. lol. I've watched Eddie do so many things that he complely built wrong for, with zero flexibiality, and actually be able to hold his own. The guy is an animal. Fun video.
Love seeing both Magnus and Eddie together.  Just missing Brian Shaw, Juji, Antone, etc.  Also the time under tension that Eddie is going for with his body building is really good here.
He did brilliant to be fair that orange looked really tough
I enjoy watching these types of comparisons :) you do it very well.
Who the f cares....
He couldn't climb the mountain
This is just a lovely to see video. Thank you both
Last time I went rock climbing my hands got torn apart and ripped and I couldn’t go the gym for a week out of pain in my forearms 😂it’s fun though!
Guts in the way...lul
Eddie. Such a nice guy. 😊
He's probably accustomed to the name magnus
He's fantastic. Great job
Tell you what mind, Eddie is a massive individual, he did an awesome job pulling his weight up those early climbs. Really surprised and impressed - great effort!
Two of my favorite folks
Impressive how strong he is being able to lift all his muscle weight the moment he gets a hold of something
It would have been cool to see Magnus do a grip strength video with Stanless Steel.
I'm truly impressed.  I did not expect Eddie to be able to climb that well at his weight.
I couldn't imagine walking into a climbing centre and seeing these two legends. I would just follow them around watching like a stray dog or something.
13:50 Magnus's life flashed before his eyes. 🤣🤣
Eddie is such mood! All respect to him
I hate when people call Bouldering "Rock Climbing"
I guess Thor wasnt available
Is the grading different across different hangar venues? At my local hangar yellow is the hardest and black is the competition circuit so it does have hard routes but also some very doable ones and nothing compared to the yellows
08:00 This part is actually  really educational, as this is exactly how how would have done. Thanks for the show!
5:20 I love you Eddie, but you're too fat, man!
“Do you think I’m an f***ing octopus?” Awesome video
Do it against earling haaland
I want to meet Mr.Hall.  Very few people I care to meet, he is one.
you guys need to record together more this was great
Wheres Tom Stoltman or Novichok? Wrong headline lol
This dude is fantastic
Eddie is such a character
Will you be going to lift with Eddie.
The crossover I hoped for! You two are brilliant
This guy was wildly good for his size and experience! The blue was crazy first try
“Next hole is really good”…. gross
loved the video, love magnus and eddie hall. however, i have done a lot of turkish get ups... eddies form, highly suspect especially considering the not so heavy weight he is using....
Been waiting for this forever!
😂
Eddie just randomly picking turkish getups haha
My knees hurt for him every time Eddie had to jump down. That’s a lot of force coming down!
you got some scammers in your reactions Magnus
I raced woods motocross and to train I would climb, it's the only sport that gives you harder arm pump than a dirt bike or atv
Armwrestlers, heavy lifters, body builders, typically are always pulling on an object. The moment you want them to support and hold there own body weight,....they fall to pieces. Look at arm wrestler Devon Larrett for instance. His arm stay bent. He CAN NOT fully extend his arms. It causes him great pain to simply hang from something while supporting his own body weight. Your range of motion goes out the window when gaining huge muscles. It's like atrophy.
Even though Eddie dabbed the floor on the second blue one I think he would have finished the first blue one if he had been fresh and not tired out.
8:43 ‘I’m pissing in the wind here mate’ got me laughing soo bad 😂
This is so brilliant and wholesome. Magnus’s content is fantastic, down to earth (get it?), educational and inspiring. This guy should get a government grant to train kids
Eddie is such a good sport, can't hate the guy
This honestly was such a pleasure to watch. Would honestly be fun to see you 2 showing each other different interesting workouts. Some of the strength building stuff Eddie knows might actually help your climbing even more..and vice versa
i've been waiting for this
Can’t eat  Can’t climb
Eddie and Magnus make such a fun duo, they were both so chill and light hearted, and it was cool seeing Eddie attempt stuff he thought might be outside his abilities and didn’t worry about looking good. It was really impressive how much we WAS able to do and watching Magnus coach him through it was really cool.
I hope King Charles isn;t watching LMAO (no pun intended)
Ayo that's my gym
These guys are so chill id be friends with them
Mad respect for the both of you. Just watching you climb and chat with each other puts me in a good mood. Thanks! watching
I like how Magnus immediately knew what Eddie meant when he said, "the beta?" Haha
so cool to see you trying climbs I did a few weeks ago - I'm just starting purples now but that orange on the corner was super difficult for me 😅 also loved Eddie's attitude! He did amazing
When I’m training for ultras, I’ll always remember that they put a man on the moon 😂
Magnus, noe av det som gjør deg så populær, er at du er ydmyk og din personlighet, du er så god på hva du gjør. Men du må ikke undervurdere deg selv! Så du har stor respekt for Eddie, noe man bør, men du glemmer litt at du er nesten like stor kjendis som han på YT, litt artig å se deg star struck😅 Og jeg er overbevist om at du vil bli MYE større enn du er nå, for det du gjør er så imponerende - redigering, måten du filmer, og ditt talent atletisk vil få deg lenger enn du tror. Gjør hva du gjør, elsker det, og det gjør vi alle, blir så inspirert og underholdt. Hilsen en som ikke har klartet siden barndommen i trærne som Eddie
Awsome video. Loved every minute. So Eddy was it a boy or a girl? The embryo in your underarms :))
Moral of the story: if you want to be the best climber, skip leg day.
Awesome! :D
Seeing magnus up on the wall trying to guide eddie as he is climbing is like watching a flying squirrel trying to coach a giant sloth 😂😂😂
I would have loved to see the grib strength challenge that you do with Eddie.   Next Thor should come climbing with you 😂
When he did the first part of that blue I was so impressed
Brilliant,so funny.
I'm only 6 minutes in so far, and I know Eddie is top tier athlete...but watching a man that big move like that is insanely impressive
Magnus to the world's strongest man: "you're stronger than you think!"  Lmao.
Not only strongest man, but he has a talent for making videos also.
That's a lot of mass fighting against gravity. I'm impressed.
Eddie would climb crazy if he was hydrated
Worlds strongest rocks*
What an awesome guy Eddie is! Humble, friendly and open to learn. He did WAY better than I was expecting! Great video Magnus.
😎
Watched Eddie’s video yesterday. Watching this one today in the hopes it also includes the go pro footage
for en duo!
Both these guys seem so chill
Its really impresive to see Eddie Hall climb beside Magnus. i cant say anything else than... This was amazing video!!!
Monkeys can climb better than elephants.
8:21 holy shit that calf definition is insane
one punch from martyn ford  and hes laying on the ground...
This is my all time favourite YouTube collab, I really hope we get to see more of you together
Eddie used to carry rocks for a living ..?  I think his employers health insurance provider would not be keen on that activity
You are the best  :) Hei å hå
Eddie is a beast, he is unbelievably strong
He's not the worlds strongest man
Would love to see Magnus link up with Aidan over the lakes whilst he's in the UK. Or go up Northumberland and try the county classics at Kyloe in the Woods like Monks life - 8b+, Catapult 8a+, The Yorkshireman - hardest 7b in world etc.
Absolutely terrific 👏
15:44  I can now say that I sound like the world's strongest man when I climb :)
He is such a good sport abt climbing.  Great attitude!   Nice job Magnus
It is funny how the worlds strongest man is barely able to pull himself up. Not that I am any better but it is just interesting to see what humanity sees worth achieving...Great video as always tho! :)
Lifting weights for 20 odd years?! How old is he?! He looks great for his age!!
That was awesome! I'd like to here the update on how Eddie's forearms are doing the next day.
Now I want Eddie to do badass strongman training with Magnus.
My respects to Eddie, didn't expect him to do so well. Not because of the strength but of his big body.
"you are stronger than you think" 🤣
"Sweating me dick off..." 😂
boah sieht der hässlich aus
I think the term "gentle giant" was invented to describe Eddie!
This was pretty cool to watch. It'd be awesome to see professionals from different sports try climbing for the first time.
jesus christ, the 12 kilo kettle looked so small compared to eddie, but when magnus picked it up, it look massive. that is crazy.
I somewhat expect Magnus to randomly appear in every climbing hall of the world every now and then...
eddy is a beast thats 4 shaw. and as a climber is must be fucking hard to pull up so much weight. but in his defence hes picking up technique pretty quick. far play to that guy
favourite sport and favourite person in one video
8:30 was my "wow" moment...
Eddie Hall is the best
I was hoping this would happen at some point. 🎉
The climb center just wanted to test how strong their hand holds are bolted to the wall.
Go to Ukraine
magnus almost died at 13:50
that was amazing. he did so damn well !!! didn't expect that
they really put a man on the moon...
How do you spot a guy like that?
Yo. this was awesome. Part 2 when???
Eddie Hall is the goat! This guy has a personally that makes the room glow
You must invite Bear Grylls😅
eddie is very athletic as far as strongman competitors go, he's always impressive for his size and he's extremely competitive
I dont think your alowed to help yourself whit the other hand on that Turkish execise but yea.. Edit: nevermind you can... This is less exciting
Daaammn his try at that blue wall at minute 13 was impressive. 170kg is not easy to lift....
Leaving a comment for the algorithm
14:47 🤣
I saw Eddie pull 500 kg, win WSM, but he's not the World's Strongest Man anymore. People gotta stop milking that tag. There can be only one - and it's Tom Stoltman!
The raw strength exhibited on that blue route is insane. Eddie has 0 climbing technique and just powered his way through this video
His intro face is stupidly funny 😂
"You are stronger than you think" made me almost die 🤣🤣🤣
Eddie at 13:45 casually doing solid technique when swinging the hip to do a little more dynamic move. Also, loughing because something seems so hard is really cool. I do that usually after I fail not before and then suceed but I like to think that I can relate.
Crazy how you can be the worlds strongest man and can't lift yourself up a wall. Love the variety of strength training.
now i want to see him climb with the dutch giant
FINALLY!!! Great guest!
bro gotta get some caffeine in him for this have him drink a couple of gfuels before hitting the wall
the carves on that man
Eddie is just too funny
Is that Jamie from TGF ?
You should do a part 2, but this time Magnus has to add some extra weight so they will weigh the same.
When he mentioned the dude who does the train footage with the gopro I was sold, following eddie from now on cause hes clearly got good taste
I hope people realize Eddie hall is 370 pounds. He is able to move his weight around like that is super insane. Magnus is a great teacher as well. Awesome video
Pissing in the wind, sweating his dick off, oh you slag  hahahaha
Such a stupid thing to compare with such a heavy man !
Eddie seems like such a legend. Humble, actually hilarious and seemingly genuine guy for being the best of the best of his field. Great guest, Great episode.  Edit: and he referenced Francis, confirmed legend
This was a great one. I really like it when Magnus provides coaching tips as well. I'm a bad climber and I find all his tips so helpful. Magnus, please do a tips and tricks video.
Me : why is the video laggy?  Youtube, that's 4k mate.  Oops my phone cant handle it, nice camera tho, sharp.
I watched Eddie's video but I'll watch the same thing again because I like both of you!
Eddie have 80kg too much for rock climbing
For someone that's never climbed before, that's pretty darn good.
This is AMAZING!!! Great work as always Magnus. You're in my top 3 favorite Youtubers easily. I look forward to watching your videos all the time
now do VS the jew
What a good sport giving it a go :)
I swear this is the funniest video ever! If eddie starts to love climbing, please start doing more videos with him!
Eddi: Why climb a rock,  if you can carry it? XD
He is not 170 kg, 155 at most.
Eddie you beast lol Magnus your a great teacher! i love watching your videos :^)
This was an amazing video, huge respect for Eddie Hall and how well he did. Looks like he had fun too
Can't believe magnus kept his tee on
That is seriously good fun, brilliant colab!  😊
One word. SPLOOOOSHH
When the kettlebell was in Eddie’s hand, it looked tiny. When Magnus grabbed it, it magically tripled in size. 😂
I know how Eddie feels, I tried some bouldering on holiday the other year with my son.  He was fine, I slept like a baby, in car, on the way home with the wife driving luckily!  😅. Hardest and toughest thing I have ever tried, would love to have another go.  😊
eddie.... please do a warmup... wtf...
Loved the video. I haven't watched bouldering content in quite a while, but this brought me back. If you have any opportunity to make more videos with Eddie in the future I would love that!
God, I would freak out if Magnus and Eddie suddenly appeared in my gym, what a moment.
23:50 Eddi nah you cant have chalk ... Magnus worst nightmare
As someone who started rock climbing like 3 weeks back, I was absolutely blown away by Eddie. Mad lad. This is so much harder than it looks especially the 30 seconds hold at the end. Also their sense of humour is on point!
Finally, I have waited for that colab for so long!
NEVER been into climbing, cant wait to find a gym here in San Antonio. Little nervous to go lol
Eddie! That’s a damn good first effort.
How come eddie used liquid chalk and magnus use normal?
Great collab!
8:12 THOSE CALVES WHAT THE HEEEL
All I can say is, EXCELLENT vid!
lmao looks like a bear climbing
Magnus, you have to try climbe with nile wilson, that would be fun to watch
We need a part two where you go lifting with Eddie :D
You do know we landed on the moon… right, Magnus?
I'd be lying if I said I expected Eddie to get even halfway up orange -- hell, I didn't expect him to get to the top of grey! Magnus is a great teacher!
Eddie is chill af
Your campus is just Amazing bro it’s impressive
Eddie Hall, major props to u for trying this. So many people in ur field would never even give climbing a chance. Not only did u give it a chance but you did REALLY good for a guy your size. 👏🏼👏🏼
Awesome collab and video!
Good collab! Awesome video :)
Thought thorr world strongest man again ? Fatty hall just passed out and gets knocked out Thor and pudIanoswki and big Z goats
what grade is the blue climb? something like 6a?
This man is so strong
I love how chill you are man... came here for Eddie but I will subscribe to see more
I’m impressed that the wall could take his weight !!!
eddie is such a cute personality! loved the humour and how open he was to trying things. great chemistry, enjoyed this a lot!
The man on the moon banter had me rolling
Anyone that believes they put a man on the moon has never given the subject even the slightest bit of enquiry and attention, outside of what they were 'taught' in school and in the movies.   Riddle me this...in the hyper-consumer age where EVERYTHING is commodified, how come there are not spaceships to the moon departing regularly, i mean they flew there all those years ago, surly the technology would have advanced to the point where shuttle trips are simple and straightforward, no?   If it was possible the crypto-bros and andrew tate types would be flexing their nonsense on the fucking moon but they cant because we cannot go there.
Him being a professional athlete you know when he can't to do it, it winds him up so much
This was cool.  Thank you
Please get Eddie, Brian, Nick and Robert together climbing. It would be the funniest session
Don't know why, but it's so satisfying to watch a big guy and a bodybuilder climbing.  Awesome, mate!
Magnus, thanks for your videos man. I am looking to be a police officer and your videos motivate me to become stronger and more physically fit all around. Keep up the great work😎
Idk why but I love this man 😂
Beat collab!!!!
Magnus, it would be so cool to see you set your guests a problem specific to their strengths. Imagine setting eddie a big compression problem with easy feet. That way, they learn to respect the strength elements of climbing, without spending the session worrying about footwork. Just an idea!
Watching this video makes my shoulders hurt
Magnus could crimp Eddie's calf jeez
Great collab
I was expecting Eddie to just keep climbing higher grades and then take of his beard and reveal that he's actually a pro climber. Almost looked like he was faking his skills like Magnus has been doing last couple of videos 😂 Would have been fun if Magnus was revenge pranked 😄
This is the colab I never knew I needed! Subscribed to both of you guys for years! Brilliant!
You need a video with Nile Wilson! :D
The collab I didn't know I needed two of my favourite youtubers in one place ooof
not bad Eddie. You could be a decent climber one day if wanted.
I love Eddie videos, and Magnus videos. This is like an early Valentine's gift.
I wanna see magnus bring eddie and juji together for a competition
Shout out to Eddie. He is a showman but it’s obvious he puts is all in everything he does. Nice video.  Nice colab.
Eddy works so hard & did so much better than I expected. What a nice guy too!
I was hesitant to click on this video but was happy i did, great content!
Super impressed with Eddie. Imagine if he was hydrated
This might be my favorite climbing related video love these two together
JackPGM is gonna have a great one with this, thanks for the content Magnus
Tell him to drop and roll haha. His poor knees.
Talking about the most powerful man in mankind, 14 centuries ago, Imam Ali bin Abi Talib carried a door weighing 2 and a half tons easily with one arm, like carrying a shield, and threw it a distance of 18 meters, a door that 50 adult men could not carry.
Holy shit!! I am excited to watch this 🔥😂😂
8:28 Seeing 370lbs hanging on the wall like is better than watching Spiderman
First time in a climbing gym, blue color... What else?
This was hilarious 😂😂
It's funny how people who have zero experience just want to go through the grades one after the other, even those colours are grade brackets.
The boys magnus trains with are getting stronger and stronger
interesting to watch
You should climb with somebody crazy like Jason mamoa
Some of those starts are pure evil for a person of his size, it ain't easy to make oneself smaller!
Lot’s of love from TJ, a german youtuber who just reacted to your video and now I am watching you too :)
Beta comes from betamax, an ancient video format some guy used to record himself climbing.
love ur content
18:20 I'd really appreciate more tips on how to relax between attempts...
Eddie killed it
Discovered the channel a few weeks ago. Don't climb myself (yet) but what great content!
Awesome episode! What a great guy!
thats a huge man wow i want that bicepss of that eddie guy he looks so muscularrr woww my dream biceps
Most profound convo....when pros meet lol
this magnum opus is good climbingg white ppl
Really enjoyed this video!
ok, i play Mini Golf with may 155kg ;)
I love how at the end (27:59) Eddie did the trick Devon taught Magnus about moving arm closer to camera to make it look bigger.
This was sick, eddie crushed it
So cool to have climbed in this gym on these routes knowing you both were there
Very instructional, think I learned more from this one than any other climbing video I've seen
Fair play Eddie , lots of climbing will help hand strength
06:27 lol
Magnus's accent becoming more and more British throughout  the video.
Same video 😊
CRINGE!!! THE STRONGEST MAN IS MARIUSZ PUDZIANOWSKI!!!!
The grip strength to just lift big stuff would help a lot! This was super interesting
Magnuuss, the color correction of the video looks GRATE, nice new look
Pro climber pretends to be world's strongest man and tries climbing
He is actually way better than i expected.   Thats nuts!
Not even watched this and disappointed. Eddie Is a tit
Eddie's commentary is GOLD
Really cool to see a big guy like him climbing, really nice guy, too!
My favorite part was when the camera quickly cuts to Eddie being at the top of the wall completely spread eagle and basically doing the splits🤣🤣  Idk why but that made me crack tf up😅  Im super impressed by how good he did for his first time considering his giant size😳
When you mentioned the story about the wheelchair guy I thought you were going to tell my friends story. He was supposed to sit in a wheelchair for 2 years after a hip/back surgery but instead he said he would use crutches.. And so he did. His arms was/are crazy strong. He also climbs up the wall with just his arms.
It always shocks me how athletic Eddie is
I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS COLAB FOR AGES
Eddie pointing at a man falling on his ass and saying that's going to be me is hilarious.
What's also super impressive about Eddies World Record deadlift, is that he beat the former record by 20-25kg!!! He absolutely blew past the former world record at the time when he pulled the 500kg.  That's absolutely insane.   These days, people are only able to break the record by just 1 to 5kg.
Never thought I'd see Eddie The Beast climbing a rock wall. He did a bang up job too!
"stay hydrated" and now "remember they put a man on the moon" so amazing colab! i am curious if eddie has some viking genes himself :D
So strange to look at you Magnus and think you look really small :)
God, as a big guy I feel like he did really good. I think people dont realize how strong he is !
Not expecting this collab in the slightest but I watched every second! Loved it!
Is Eddie's middle name "Bjorn"?
Tfw I find out Magnus is basically exactly the same height and weight as me... Gives me a drive to improve my own climbing 😅
When the barbarian rolls an 18 in agility
Being a skinny guy, I can't imagine what it'd feel like to climb with this weight on, while also being very strong. I won't ever be able to experience what it feels like. Very interestinfg to watch tho.
13:10 King Charles been real silent since.
Eddie’s not only the strongest but funniest cool guy☺️. Had fun watching u guys. Great collab.
Nice video!  It would be interesting to see you wear a weight west adding 70kg+ when you have colabs with these BIG athletes like Eddie. You are extremely strong and would probably still do very well. It would put your strength in perspective
I have been secretly hoping for this collab! This was a fun one
Telling the strongest man in the world "you are stronger than you think"... epic! :D 6:25
now you have to re-unite with Juji.  Get these 2  to have a climbing comp against each other.
76.56 pretty close Eddie. Jesus Christ that’s me
are u gonna be climbing with tom and pete while you're in the UK?
HE’S actually really good for a first timer - the guy just excels at anything he does. Respect.
Holding kettlebell that way is not correct. Round portion should be leaning against forearm. What they show here is simply unsafe. You'll maybe get away with 12kg but aim of exercise is not to injure yourself. Way they do it has lots of potential for that to slip. Not great.
How that guy told the dude to go away cause they will try the blue one now was kinda rude. He payed to climb in the gym just as they did. Being filmed shouldn't give you extra "rights" imo.
I feel bad for the wall having to hold up all that mass
25:15 te Mustafa Yıldızdan mı bahsediyor
Love you both, crazy to see you two climbing together😂
Lost weight...goooood
I never thought he would be this good for his body weight, but he did great, amazing what routes he accomplished!
Eddie actually is a very, very strong man. Nice episode.
The date GOAT Magnus with the hand size comparison. 🌚
Magnus I hope you're doing well and your career provides comfortably for you. I am so grateful for your content, I hope the good it does in your life is even half the good you're doing in ours. Thank you.
When I say I fucking wheezed @ 14:48 Eddie: "I'm sweating me 🍆 off" 😂
1:23  Awesome timing -   "That guy on the yellow that's gonna be me"......... a second letter that guy falls down
I've watched many of Magnus' and Eddie's videos and this is definitely the greatest and funniest collabs I didn't know needed to happen.
Kept that top on for this one
6:25 You are stronger than you think. 😂
Great to see this guy climbing, great Video!
He's not climbing the wall the wall is climbing him
Eddie got natural talent on top of practice... for a man his size, he got movement like few other humans in history
Go Eddie!
very impressive, great collab!
there's something to be said of Eddie's tenacity when he powers through, whether he does the technique perfectly or not you can tell he's pushing himself, what a mental game he must have    a great example of this was at 10:10 when he knows to put his left hand on the opposing wall, but hasn't yet mastered a mantle, so he just PUSHES HIS FIST into the hold to keep himself up, and Magnus has to gently correct him, he's a calm and quick coach
This guy has wades like water wings….
Magnus you should totally try to get back for a video with Eddie together with the other legendary strongman Brian Shaw... Eddie and Brian have an amazing energy when making videos together, it would be a blast!
Never thought I'd see Magnus climbing in Sheffield
I only recently learned of Eddie and knowing this channel I was hoping to see him here one day.
Magnus, man...I started watching your videos early in the pandemic and I've been hooked ever since. I started climbing because you inspired me to do so - and I actually climb at The Hangar (featured in this video)  It's amazing to see another legendary athlete climb with you. Eddie is a great bloke and watching him give climbing his all but with his typical funny man attitude is just great to watch.  Amazing content. Keep it up dude
Legends
3:32 when you make a joke but you are the only one laughing 😢
Eddie struggling at the top of the orange, meanwhile a certain coach magically appears in frame, casually hangs out at the top of the wall wondering what the issue is.
Is he bulking?
this just made my monday so muhc better
This was a really funny video! "I feel like I could rip it off the wall!" Haha! I hope you two do more collabs, would love to watch you two do more climbing and other strength things!
what a clickbait lmoa
I know this video is monetised, but I’d still donate extra because the content is so great. Thanks @magnus!
Lol Magnus just casually standing mid wall like a mountain goat
8:20 look how big Eddie’s calf’s are 😂
Eddie has good British energy 😂
8:17 LOOK AT THAT CALF it's like almost popping out of his body :D
I climed up the wall on the side of kenilworth castle once🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ got stuck and my mate had to flag a scaffholding lorry down for a ladder to get me down
I'm all there for that comeback "you know they put a man on the moon, right?"
First I thought some weird camera angles were going on for them to be the same height, but then I realised Eddie was sinking all the way into the floor, while Magnus was floating on top like Legolas on snow 😂
I remember walking into The Climbing Barn for my first climbed, clocking in at 142kg... Quite a few people were surprised to say the least... Lol, later tehy told me I wasn't the heaviest guy to ever climb there, but the the heavest to come back... repeatedly.
Subscribed. Great video
1:47 does he mean the meta? Not the beta? Not to step out of my lane but like...
World strongest man? why Eddie always put that in their title? he hasnt been the strongest since 2017.... Won once and will prob still put it in the title when hes 80 years old. Geez man
Feel sorry for those holds
18:25 If Eddie tells you they are on the blue, you choose another wall, simple as that.
Have you have already done something with a proper Hollywood celebrity, like Tom Cruise, he likes climbing. That would skyrocket you at 2M views. Never missed one so far
magnus tries strongman when?
8:42 it's so jarring to just see a man standing on a wall as if he were a mountain goat
Very entertaining :D
Next should be Afthor Bjornsson
Loved this video. One of the best "specials" I've seen from you!
Great video!
Eddies cool, I hope to meet him one day.....Magnus too XD
5:26 lmao, you can see the wall flexing as he pulls
Great video, thanks for giving us a chance to see this. Magnus you seem to have become much more comfortable in front of the camera over the years.
Now Magnus should also do the climbs with a 100kg backpack to have comparable conditions.
This was really entertaining to watch seeing Eddie out of his depth yet really trying with the best teacher in the world
Wow, this is 100% the collaboration we didn't know we wanted! ☺️ I love seeing Eddie being Eddie and not the beast.
what would happen if you attach 100kg plates to your back and try to climb?
i reckon trhis could be like a new series, bringing someone whos never climbed and seeing how far you can get them in however long.  id love tyo see you get brian shaw in if you think eddies big haha
That "Spider Pig" singing at 5:00 put a huge smile on my face xD
legit episode
seeing one of if not the strongest man ever alive do this is freaking amazing
I've seen him do gymnastics and ballet, but I never thought I'd see the day he tried rock climbing. He's such a funny guy :D Great video as usual Magnus
Said the same on Eddie's video. This is the collab we didn't know we needed. Magnus is making some real traction, getting some big mainstream names on the channel recently.
Did they put a man on the moon but 🤔. Maybe we should say ‘they say they put a man on the moon…’
I’d like to see a grip one with Eddie
The strongest man in the world is not so strong.....
i'm a big bastard like eddie and i recently did my first climbing . it was so much fun. im taller than eddy but only 120kg and i had an extremely hard time keeping my weight near the wall. extremely impressive climbing from eddie
Awsome coop Magnus, thanx.
8:28 Oh my god.
More with Eddie please?!
This should be edited to: " World's 2nd Strongest Man vs Rock Climbing" Or "One of The Worlds Strongest Men vs Rock Climbing" since you dont have halfthor here 🤷‍♂️
I get mentally tired of watching big people struggle with climbing because I am heavy myself. Thankfully my fear of hights would force be to stay low, but even falling a few inches hurts ;)
The Turkish get-up record is 76.5kg by Chris cox and he’s built like my dad, im blown away
Well done Eddie. Great effort.
i would watch every video that includes you two
16:33 The size difference of your forearm to Eddie's is NOT what you would expect from the size difference of the overall body and comparing yourself to "THE STRONGEST OVERALL MALE IN THE WORLD". It's actually quite close because you use your forearm muscles SOOOO much. When you get to the girth and mass of the bicep, triceps, and should muscles, that's where you can see the difference. Its clear you've got incredible strength and endurance for your size Magus.
How hard was that 6a+?
Did you guys know they put a man on the moon??
I loved at 8:35, Magnus like a fairy by his shoulder "here, put your hand here".
It's funny how much Eddie sinks into the padded floor. Magnus doesn't seem that much shorter, but Eddie is just sinking 4 inches into the mats 😂
Eddie calves are the most impressive muscle I’ve seen on anyone. Holy balls
probably the only sport in the world I'm better than the world's strongest man at
Eddie is such a great guy!
You know that youre pumped when the forarms look pregnant 😂
you guys are awesome
Wow Eddie is really really good in bouldering! His movement and strength is much better than I expected. I mean he has a lot of weight, just imaging the work his fingers do. Impressive!
those are some really strong handles
Subtitle: Black is the hardest grade Magnus: Flashes it ez pz Me: *Perplexed Hotel: Trivago
I'm so glad all the holds held! A brave guy Eddie is!
The Beast made a solid effort! Awesome video
6:28 made me laugh
Great job Eddie! Surprised you can get all that weight up the wall. Took a lot of 'beeping' though !
hyyylerius !! :D
@6:46 I'm sure that was Uber climbing legend Martin boysen walking past and Magnus didn't notice him.
Worlds collide!! So cool to have Eddie on the channel.
I think Eddies shoes are a problem, way to big for climbing, so he doesn't put the toes as close to the wall as he could have and foot slips more easily, a proper shoe size would be a huge improvement.
i love when eddy tells that guy to move ahahah
In the back of my mind I always had a feeling that this collaboration would happen, even so I'm blown away this was amazing!
It would have helped eddie massively if his shoes were tighter. His feet were sliding off everything
Eddie's such a BEAST...of a nice guy! Really nice episode, Magnus! Nice chemistry!
Yooooooooo I watch 2 “fitness” YouTubers and they collaborated so hype
"I'm pissing in the wind here mate" - gotta love Eddie Hall haha. It's so interesting to see someone that incredibly strong trying climbing. Honestly he did so well for a first timer and I was surprised how good he can pull all that weight.
Now i know why i got no response to the big man body suit as an alternative pretend from last video, haha. Wow.
The climbers arms are extremely developed
This is SUCH a good video! As a long time follower of both yours & Eddie's channel (of course I've been following Magnus longer 😉) I couldn't wait to watch the video and was so happy to see you collab together.
Been following both of you for years! ;-)
Excellent colab...more of this please
Is Magnus wearing his Rungne pants in this video? I want pants that stretch like that. haha.
Ive just started bouldering in Bergen, and Im a light guy, kind of a weaker version of Magnus and I cant even imagine climbing these walls weighing as much as that man! Holy, impressive
Eddie is quite good , and I incredibly humble for doing something that no one would imagine a Strongman attempting. I would like to see Magnus with a 100kg backpack doing the same walls. Great channel 😀
This is such wholesome content. Eddie has a hilarious and magnetic personality, and he tries really hard at something unfamiliar.
I am so glad you had him on! I saw his climbing tiktok that didnt show you and was like i need magnus to collab with him!
Does anyone knows in which german tv show, they were together?
I want to say something that is on his shirt the whole time.. but this guy sure is a beast and he seems to shine compared with the last grib video!
What if Magnus wore 100kg weights to even the body mass and have them battle
I love it! Wanna see more! ;-)
That was really great. A fellow Brit with colourful language and humour really up for the challenge! Great coaching. This is so far away from “let’s see  what a big bloke can’t climb” I previously imagined. All this videos have been so incredibly positive and inclusive. You inspire us to be better people not just better climbers Magnus
Something about the grey handholds. "That's what you like, yeah?" and all I can think is they look like... Male genitals
Eddie is such a cool guy. He's good friends with Ross Edgley though! You should try to ask him if he's willing to get in on this show.
Hafthor woulda climbed that blue first try
Couldn't watch this video to the end. Just waaaaayyyy to many advertising. After watching 5 of them I'm done 🤣
Shout out to me for suggesting this video ❤
Omg!! You actually did what I suggested! This is amazing!! ❤
Dude i thought Sonny from best ever food review show was gonna pop up from a corner with a special dish at 02:30
This fucking rules
When I was part way through lockdown in 2020 I got REALLY into watching  1. Climbing videos (both YouTube and like every episode ever of real Rock etc) 2. Strongman videos  2020 me's mind is blown with this combination ❤️😅
Its kind of funny that Eddie was impressed by the guy that potentially sat in a wheelchair for two weeks to lose some weight.  Meanwhile Eddie was on enough steroids to turn a ethiopian village into bodybuilders while prepping for that 500kg deadlift and literally went blind for a while lol.
Oh look that's cheating narcissist cry Eddy, 💩
You need to do some grip strength stuff with eddy, like you did with the other strong man. Im very curious how eddie would do
The heaviest single repetition Turkish get-up is 76.56 kg (168 lb 8 oz), and was achieved by Chris Cox (Canada) in Elora, Ontario, Canada,
Two of my favourite YouTubers, what a treat!
Super happy to see this collab, I went to this climbing gym yesterday and did mostly the blues. I'm a 150kg guy, Obviously no where near as strong as Eddie but it was really nice to see someone of a similar stature doing my new favourite hobby ^_^
You and your boyfriend can go and climb a beanstalk ...
Those cross sport/channel colabs are so cool!
I think my favorite thing about your Colab vids like this is how exited you get when  ppl do well.
magnus has gron sooooo much from the early days, he is comfortable with anuona now,. I sebsed this since he did that video with alex.
very very wholesome much love
Magnus is the most genuine guy. I truly appreciate how effortlessly he climbs
Wow Eddie moves like a God...... God Damn Gorilla.
Tripping out that Magnus did a video at my regular gym, hope the city has been treating you well!
Eddie is of course strong and has a great grip... But my guess prior to watching is FUCK NO this guy will struggle with the most basic feats.
Very fun. Glad you got Eddie to join in!
Eddie surpassed my expectations. Wow he is really strong like beyond physical strength.
Imagine he falls into you😬
If you come back to Las Vegas sometime soon I would love to see you at red rock climbing center. Or if you want to be outdoors I would enjoy seeing you at calico basin by red rock canyon.
This was an amazing video. So nice to see such a big guy giving it all and just enjoying it. One of the best videos, thank you for this, awesome job.
1:44 what is Magnus insinuating here?
Eddie is a really good climber!
OMG, He didnt drop here! 13:44 amazing ! and continue climbing, wow
That kettleball exercise is SO good for shoulder strength. Love it
eddie could've climbed 10a if he wasn't so goddamn DEHYDRATED!
This is a really great video
Eddie had me rolling😂😂😂
Can we see a series were you train to climb V15? I hear they put a man on the moon so it should be pretty straight forward! 😂  Great video Magnus
Lol I love when magnus climbs up next to eddy and is just hanging there easily on what looks like nothing like spider man when he shows eddy which one to grab next
God I really despise Eddy's gimmick. He had his sponsor rig the world's strongest man competition because after several years it was blatantly obvious he would never win it fair and square and then after getting the title, quitting the scene and then monetizing the shit out every waking moment on that fake title.
"You are stronger then you think" 🤣🤣🤣
I wrote a comment that I wanted a video a few years ago. I am so happy right now
Now just imagine how impossible assassins creed truly is:(
This one was fun 😂🙌
That was a really cool video. Eddie was surprisingly chill here. He was energetic but not as over the top as he usually is.
eddy says hes a "fit guy" i would comment on that, then i realised im a couchpotato so im not allowed to judge
@6:27 "You're stronger than you think" LOOOOOOOOOL
That handshake at the end was so funny! You guys are awesome!
Ok so Eddie weighs 170 kilos (375 pounds) and has the stamina to hang out on the wall for minutes while cursing about how hard it is. That's impressive
The hard part of this is Eddie needs to not risk an uncontrolled fall. Seriously falling wrong for him could be game over for his health. and goals as he lives off of his body.
Better than I could do! I have no finger strength at all 🙁
This was wildly entertaining, very impressive stuff from Eddie
Eddie I know the deck was stacked in your favor,  but still this is incredible. Imagine Nick Best trying this.
Oh man I've been waiting for the day my two favorite fitness men collab!! Finally!!! This will be one epic duo.
"If you want to be the best climber in the world, You're probably better chopping your legs off" ONLY EDDIE WOULD SAY THAT!!! hahaha~!
I think you should have tried him in a gym with a top rope.  less worry about breaking something if he goes for it and falls.
Eddie ALWAYS cheats in literally every competition with every challenge with every collaborater he films with.
Most famous person on this channel he has had on would be Alex Honnold.
Great episode. Would be cool to have him back, would love to see how far he could get with just a little more experience and training.
What in the fuck was Eddie talking about with that 1969 man on the moon reference
Hey man why does your pinkie look messed up
You gotta bring on Brian Shaw so they can compete
Well this is one thing he can do better than Brian
Amazing
Yooo my boi eddie!
Beast, I'm impressed!
Yoo this big dude is funny lol
Magnus vs brian shaw in grip strength would be amazing to see!
I'd like to see brian shaw attempt this. At well over 200kg and half a foot taller than eddie, I think he'd simply be too big to start at the bottom of that blue.
Nice!  First climb???
This is very inspiring. As a heavier climber, it is encouraging to see someone that’s not tall and/or skinny topping these climbs
Yoooo when he went to blue man surprised tf outta me
Haha, not Eddie singing Spiderpig 😂❤ legend
The collaboration I never thought I'd see, but very glad it's happened. Now, do I watch BOTH videos? 🤔😆
Eddie never fails to impress. He's a legit athlete
Can't wait to see clips of this in meme montages
Allegedly is correct
Eddie has much better endurance than I expected.
That's so cool he got Eddie to come on.
This is incredibly impressive.
I didn't know more advanced climbers don't focus on putting their body weight on their legs - why not?
Never in a 100 years would I have expected to witness Eddie "The Beast" Hall do a TKU! Bell up no less! Absolute gem of a video! The way Eddie seems to have relaxed a bit is palpable. He listens, he learns, he focuses. It's really cool to see 2 icons of their respective fields come together, learn from each other and grace us with such brilliant entertainment. Thank you, gentlemen!
I never thought these two would have colabed together .
This dudes super chill and funny, gotta have him on again at some point!
Seeing such a huge man climbing walls is terrifying. In a good way of course
Lmao best episode 😂
Eddie has a winning personality!
I feel like I gotta comment (though same thing as others). Great video. Great athletes showing their skills all the while not shying away to show the hard things it takes to get to next level. Also there is some real body positivity here. You can be lean like Magnus and be really strong. You can be heavy like Eddie and be able to climb walls on first try. Also I like how you both encourage people try themselves things without making it seem like people would be able to do same after first week.
5:25 the wall is shaking
I really did not expect the chemistry that they had. But this was awesome to watch.
For 400lbs not bad.
Eddie could be cast as a young Gimli
When he said he was "370 American" I stopped the video and looked it up, 375 actually.  I am really impressed by his performance and completely believe that he heard that hold making noise..
Good stuff & great energy =)
Magnus grabs a suspicious shaped stone. "Thats what you like, yea?"
Disappointed in this gift on your channel.  Such a horrible guy. 🤔
I mean, bears can climb trees, right?
The climber Hugh Herr got better at climbing after he lost his legs, also just a super interesting guy
i want to see magnus do climbing in a weight suit at 100kg and see if he is as good as eddie
Wow, Spiderman meets the Hulk in real life.  Both are powerful in different ways.  Awesome video worthy of a thumbs up.
Instead of gracie jujitsu. We need magnus bouldering international. Love it. Coaching skills are great and patient yet confident boosting. Please keep these up. Find joe shmoe and give him some lessons.   I got it. Go to your gym or someone elses. Offer a free hour of lessons to Randoms. If they know who you are, they have to pay. If they don't you pay them.
Eddie “Fuckin Hell”  Magnus “Yeah” 😂 what a great teacher and patient but that was amusing.
Eddie was a really good sport about that dead hang comp at the end.
Now I'm kind of curious how much Magnus could deadlift if Eddie coached him for a video, it's always cool to see top level athletes interact like this
I think Magnus is one of the strongest people on the planet, pound for pound. His functional strength is absolutely ridiculous. It's cool to see him up against someone like Eddie.
The train spotter reference is proper wholesome. Love that kid.
14:03 eddie did so well !
Eddie your awesome. Love your work!
23:58 Relatable 😭
This guy could climb with Marte on his shoulders 🤷‍♂
23:31 I could hang with my neck 💀
Better chance that Eddie can do the black, than we put a man on the moon.
Get your endurance up mate. Coach greg will help you big time. Drop some pounds and boost the high reps
@eddiehallwsm is the true Spiderpig.
Turkish get-ups are amazing! I used to do those with a barbell (grab the center of the bar).
awesome!!  I love it when 2 youtubers I like do a collab!! you gotta do grip strength challenges!
I always forget how athletic Eddie is!  but then he shows up and crushes it in climbing as a large strong man. I swear he was an olympic level swimmer or something. Its always fun to see you bring in different people to climb and then seeing Eddie who already is a great character. You need to get him through the grip genie gauntlet too!
Magnus is definitely one of my favourite YouTubers, he’s just built different
11:00 he grabbed the top of the wall 😂😂😂
20:20 "You make it look so fluid and effortless." "That's what difference a 100 kilo weight difference makes." No, Magnus, I weigh like the same as you and I don't make climbing look as fluid and effortless as you. ':D
Awesome collaboration, two of my favourite YouTubers... Neither of which I'm anywhere near in ability but I can only hope.  If either of you ever fancy a 200+ year history lesson on a canal boat tour in Brumagen give me a shout. (Sorry Eddie but I don't think you'll physically fit in the loo.)
That was very fun to watch! Proof that climbing is hard and that muscles & strength ain't everything.
I love Eddie. I’m glad you two got to climb together
I want to see a bit of him going around the gym asking randoms to belay for him.
FORMER worlds strongest man
Not quite the collab I expected, but I'm here for it
Hey Magnus I know this is your personal channel that you can do anything you like with but considering you’re the biggest YouTuber representing the climbing community could you maybe have some strong female climbers in some of your videos? It’s all very male centric.
Well now here's a YouTube combo I would have never imagined.
What a collab!! I love this and haven’t even watched the video yet😂💪❤️
4:30 its funny eddie says that considering the things you need to do to win strongman
Magnus telling Eddie that he's stronger than he thinks is hilarious to me lmao
Two of my favorite channels. Fun stuff.
Good video, except for the spitting part.
Eddie is a totally different person when Brian Shaw, Robert, and Nick aren't around. 😂
more like the funniest strongest man
"Don't complain about what's sore, complain about what's not sore."
Eddie was really good damn. He should consider doing more climbing in the future.
I went to a gym for a while and little did I know it was a favorite of some world class competitive power lifters (you'd never have known, it was an unassuming place with lots of machines, but had a good free weight room, they actually went there because it was low key and they could avoid the "body builders" who were apparently really annoying in the area) I got to know them, and went to a few competitions to cheer them on. They were the gentlest, friendliest, compassionate, most supportive and helpful group I'd ever met. I was not there to power lift by any means, I was horribly out of shape and trying to lose 80 ponds. I owe a lot of achieving that to that group. Unfortunately I lost touch with them when I moved away from California. Anyway, I'm writing this as even though I don't know him more than from this video, Eddie's demeanor and good humor reminded me so much of that group, and it brought back a lot of good memories. I have to admit, my assumption was that these giants with legs like tree trunks would be a bunch of macho jerks, and man was I proven wrong.
Holy crap. I was into power lifting before I was into climbing, and Eddie Hall is a legend. I never expected to see him climbing!
That ring tattoo is such a great idea for his lifestyle haha 💍💍
Eddie seems like such a fun guy to be around
The way Magnus just casually climbs beside him and stands there pointing like he's on solid ground is hilarious
One of your best videos yet!. Eddie is SO charismatic and your verbal  exchanges were brilliant.
holy fuck I didn't realize 170kg was 370lbs until he said it... I usually have good estimates when it comes to imperial to metric but damn my brain fluked there bad. That's fucking impressive what he's doing.
Enjoy both your channels, so this was a lovely video indeed :)
WOO EDDIE!  This is the dream collab I didn't know I needed
Dude watching Eddie cut feet several times and still hang there is just insane Idk what I was expecting but fuck he's so fucking strong! Lol
I want to see a colab with Chris heria calesthenics master
my man can climb, amazing
Love this crossover. That's fking awesome. Eddie's way more nimble than I thought he'd be on that wall. Great vid
Ex worlds strongest man. Forever a tit!
those holds are so good. they didn't break with all of that weight
Eddie is a surprisingly good climber
Greatest crossover!! Never thought this would be a collab. I'm a fan of Eddie and Magnus!! Honestly Eddie was so good for first time climbing, hope he keeps it up.
scary seeing such a large man climb like that
Eddie "in an hours time thats literally gunna be me" ...guys sitting on the floor after slipping off the wall haha gotta love eddie he makes me laugh no matter what he's doing
Watching magnus just stroll up that first route with no leg usage at all was WILD edit: and then the second one. Good god man
Magnus you said you don't really use your legs? I'm not a pro but been climbing for a while and up to 8a and still believe my legs are more important than my arms...is that why im not climbing harder? do you think the key to climbing beyond 8a is basically having more upper body strenght and finger strength? Would love to hear your thoughs! Thanks for your videos! :)
Eddie. A World record climber at the 170 kg weight class
Get after it Eddie. I love this from Okotoks Alberta Canada.
absolutely wild video. great production as always Magnus! Your youtube journey has been super inspiring
Eddie you'd be welcome at  Awesome Walls or Kilnworx in Stoke.
Absolutely love Eddie Hall ~ super-sized real-life real-person. Magnus is alright too.
Magnus you really blew it with this one, Eddie’s an amazing sportsman and seeing you guys together it’s amazing!!!
Eddie's calves look like upside-down climbing holds
Like teaching a BULL ... Ballet
Holy hell never thought id see a collab with you two but im all for it
CAARY ROCK for a living HHAHAHAHHA
I think hes 170kg not sure tho
Gotta love when worlds collide and ya see this stuff
Two worlds collide
THANKS FOR HAVING ME MAGNUS
Need to get juji and Brian shaw on the wall
I probably wouldn’t call dabs on The Beast either 😂. Also got me wondering, could Magnus climb with a 100kg weight vest on? Basically equalize their weight and see what he could climb (although that’d be a bit sketchy/injury risky).
Eddie crushing that blue one was seriously impressive. What a champ for giving it ago.
Eddie is a phenomenal athlete. A man his weight and size making some of these climbs is just amazing. Much respect.
The climbing giant
we need to see more magnus and eddie
Love how Eddie says sorry mate we are projecting this one and the guy says nothing haha
Magnus thinking abt the extra editing time every time he swears 😭
Imagine walking in to a gym and seeing Eddie Hall and Magnus Midtbø hanging out 🤯
Great!
>Eddie keeps doing better and better climbs.  >Magnus gets suspicious.  >Magnus: hmmm I think you've climbed before >Eddie rips off mask and reveals he is actually Magnus
After the first time I went climbing I wanted to eat some Pringle's and couldn't open the can because of the tin foil on top. I couldn't grip the foil with my fingers and pull it off because my arms and grip were so shot! Brings me back.
Tbh Eddie fucking CRUSHES this challenge. For any Americans out there 170 Kilos is 375 FUCKING POUNDS. Hooooooooooooooooooly moly that's NUTS bro. And this man has never done this before and just powers through so many of these problems. What an actual beast. And Magnus just there making everything look like a playground as always. What an amazing episode
Eddie… “Thats literally going to be me in a hours time”… looks away… guy falls off the wall 😂😂😂 I was in stitches 😂 x
Jesus christ. That man is strong. Imagine pulling yourself up with 2 bags of cement ties to your back.
turkish get ups. I realy squished my eyes -.- Please, let the weight rest outside / on your forehand. This looks so dangerous - Face surgery? xD
I love how he points at the guy and says it’s going to me and the guy immediately falls down!😂
I subscribe to Magnus, but it was an absolute delight seeing Eddie on here! He looks fit, strong, and happier, or more peaceful somehow. Maybe it's just those Magnus vibes rubbing off ;)
Beta is American climbing lingo. Came from betamax (Sony video tape, pre VHS cassettes) Mean to watch a video of someone doing the climb before you try it.
I was literally just thinking after Eddie's last video, "I think it would be cool if he collaborated with Magnus" lol. Thank you guys for reading my mind!
I am an actual wheelchair user and I surprise my fellow climbers by going V4-5
I thought Eddie was impressive. I'm remembering the episode with Juji while watching this, and Eddie is much better at climbing than Juji was even though he weighs 370 pounds. Very entertaining to watch.
The fact that doubting the moon landing has become a joke is very funny
The host is a really great and patient teacher with great patient communication and attentiveness
Please try to do this with Brian Shaw….. that would be amazing 😂
Great channel great people
13:31 actually very impressive for a big guy
Eddie was so entertaining and it's easy to warm to him. his strength when he lost his feet and was hanging was exceptional, unsurprisingly.
Turkish Get Ups World Record: 76.56 kg.  That is insane...
Bruh why is he more than double my weight and actually as good as he is for a beginner what is this shenanigan
We've seen Eddie in Magnus'es world, lets see Magnus in Eddies world
That someone as big as Eddie was able to climb half as well as he did is amazing to me. He really deserves his World's Strongest Man title, I think. And as others have said, Eddie's tenacity and attitude are commendable, as well. Thank you for doing this, both of you.
beast would die after 1 week in the woods.
Congrats Magnus! This should help get you some more more subs, that you deserve!!!! Love how your channel has grown. (I miss the Oslo drone shots tbh)
The photo at 0:47 is amazing. What's with the tall glass of milk?? Both of you look like you're on a sick one!
look at that CALF! 8:21
great moment...love it
love this so much
I'm a former lightweight strongman and a climber. I'm surprised but also not surprised that one of the  strongest humans to walk the earth did that well. But 170kg!!
That was really good. This is the kind of thing I would expect Juji to want to try, but I didnt think I would see Eddie Hall doing it.  Much respect to Eddie though, he really gave it a good run.
I watched many of Eddie's videos and many of Magnus' videos, it is so good to see them together. I am huge and big, it is nice to see that I kind of have a chance to do a few things in a climbing gym. This is very encouraging! Thanks to you both.
Eddie is athletic man!!!
Eddie Hall surprised the hell outta me
Magnus what grade can you do at 170 kilos? I don't remember how much weight you had on in your old weight vest videos😅👴🏼
It's clear how much fun he's having, I wonder if he'll continue to pick it up as a hobby in the future. Quite curious how many of the guests end up continuing climbing a little while after these shoots.
“Biggest star on magnus’ channel so far?” 😂 @adamondra
My man be making superman jealous
Great collab… love you both! Eddie really is a beast… so athletic, crazy.
What an awesome guest! Hes an awesome human
I think Eddie is so good at climbing, because strong man requires a lot of coordination and athleticism.  I'm loving this collaboration.  You guys have great energy together! 👍🏾☺️
I like how halfway through the vid they just gave up bleeping eddie’s swearing. 😂
Funny how Eddie's arms physically can't go down any further because of all the muscle, mad repsect 😅
Next time wear a 100kg vest to make it even
It would be so awesome climbing with Magnus 💯
Eddie is a god for the spider pig reference
Really impressed with Eddie.Wonder if he did more climbing if it would help his alround  fitness.
I like how you missed the "fuck all" bleep at 14:30
Are we gonna talk about eddie's calves?
There's some pleasant about this channel, no gimmicks, no forced wacky outtakes, no jarring editing, just an extremely talented individual teaching others about his passion. Its great.
Eddie is such a nice guy in everything I see him in and giving Magnus pro tips like chopping his legs off? That’s how you really make progress in sport people 😂
he has problems with his foot (he just dont have enough muscle strengs in the foot) he compensates a lot with his big finger strengh. impressive that he can hold himself completely allthough he is so heavy
Eddie surprised himself and he did really well.  Great mentoring Magnus.
you and eddie have such great chemistry, so so entertaining
häh? how do you want to loose weight in your legs by sitting in a weelchair xd The only think you loose is muscle mass. You cant want that as a climber can you
watching eddie try climb that wall is funny asf lmao
Also, you know Eddie is bashful when he doesnt fart for the whole duration of the video! 😆
Amazing video
I havnt seen eddie really bad at anything I thought this would be it but guess not I’m impressed
Best collab ever
100 kilos on Magnus and see who will climb better? :D
"thats gonna be me!"  *falls off*
Quote of the year;  Magnus: "You're stronger than you think".  To the strongest man in the world 😂😂  Love it!
man he is such an nice dude. didnt expect that to be honest. surley a fun boulder partner
I’m always so excited when your videos come out I loved your Fredrick video was so good made me go back and watch the Bjorne videos again cause there so good.
You should get Jason Mamoa on your channel. I was convinced you already had him. I'm sure he'd be happy to do it!
we need chris heria with magnus let’s see how strong he is
Interesting all strenghts have their places, but to be lean and strong in feet and hands plus flexibility seems that it does make a difference?
Beta as in Betamax.
Magnus is such a calm teacher
Eddiiiiiie!
28 minutes felt like 7
You can take the man out of Stoke but you can't take the stoke out the man 😂
My two favourite content creators! Incredible what luck! 😄😁😄
Dude is a freak athlete to be t h at heavy and climb that decently with no exp
Been hoping for this
The fact that Eddie got as far as he did climbing is a testament to his strength. A normal 375lb man wouldn't get past the 2nd easiest level.
He's right, no one wents to the moon.
wow props to Eddie
170kgs is pushing the limits of walls, holds and gear. One dyno and the breakages start. Hehe
Eddie literally weighs more than 90% of the world population can liftz
16:39 Eddie is so based holy shit
Eddie friggin Hall on the channel!  I thought he was very impressive on the wall.  Makes me think the Norwegian Hulk could give it a go.   Eddie is obviously uncommonly strong, but he was also very agile.  I don't know how he was during the whole time, but he really seemed to be enjoying himself.  It was a really enjoyable video.   I noticed you kept the ole' shirt on this time Magnus.
I just want to know how bad Eddie's DOMS was the next day.
Man I can‘t remember a video where I smiled so much with an open mouth, all impressed, happy, surprised, everything
Love how Eddie just powered through almost every wall, weighting 170kg, using only raw strength and pure athleticism like a true strongman!
Me having good upper body strength and small leg:This is where i belong👀
Hes so athletic. I would never have guessed that he’s 170kg. So impressive.
I hope to see more collabs between the two of you soon :)
eddie can dead hang for a 1:50 at 170kg is shocking
Ludwig and now Eddie!? Omg man who is going to be next, Henry Cavill!? 😆
Eddie is good at this! I reckon all his swimming helps with climbing
I find the toe curl a really awesome idea I’ve never really thought of that when climbing because my toes are double jointed so I can make them curl like a hand naturally but that’s still really cool
170kilos! He is a total unit!
Eddie is a beast! My mind is blown right now by how good he got so quickly.
I like magnus. I like Eddie. I don’t like this video :/
170 kg... it's absolutely nuts to be hoisting himself up beyond ground level but here he is doing better than most beginner climbers! Really awesome
This was great, thanks.
What’s scarier than a 170kg bear? A 170kg bear that can climb vertical walls. Man’s a beast, even says so on his shirt
You know they put a man on the moon? Bazinga! 😆
I keep my statement from the last video, you are yet again closer to where i climb, closer every video!
yeahhhh, i was waiting to see him on this channel ! °(Oo)°
Lancashire lads
Magnus is like a mountain goat just no effort jumping up walls
Eddie getting humbled a bit there lol
only 9 minutes in and love it. eddie if funny lol. "easy as that, just match it ok"
Just started climbing a few weeks ago, I'm almost as heavy as eddie but nowhere near being the world's strongest so for now I'm stuck at V0, still, after strength training for a year it's great to be able to climb a wall (despite not being able to even hold myself up for more than 3 seconds!). Thanks for inspiring me, and I hope other folks in my condition give bouldering a try as it really is rewarding!
certainly the heaviest person to test the integrity of those holds 😆
hey magnus, what about a new video with Devon larratt??? nice video by the way ;)
These kind of collabs are fire.  Bravo.
Hard not to be impressed with the skills Eddie displayed AND his willingness to go out of his area of competence.
eddie impressed me. strength is so fascinating to me
Magnus to the worlds strongest man: You are stronger than you think.
hes obviously practiced for this, bser
LOVE THE BEAST...
LMFAO just casually Spider-Man-ing next to him at 8:32
Magnus is listed as 5'9" Eddie is 6'3"   Pretty sure someone is lying
He seems really fun to climb/hang out with.
“ Smart people doubt it “
Two extremely impressive individuals, they both absolutely rock bruv 😳
Magnus is a proper nice bloke
Amazing video. But I especially love at the end when Magnus wants Eddie to show off, instead of Eddie picking something like deadlifting which everyone knows he would obliterate Magnus at, he picked an exercise that's fun, good for the camera, and still somewhat in magnus's wheelhouse. Glad to see the respect between these two!
You need to try the physical 100 challenge
This channel brings collaborations like no other, I love it.
Words can not describe how happy this collaboration makes me, iv been watching u 4 yrs and only just become abscessed with Eddie and his videos with Brian, wood absolutely love to see the three of you altogether Eddie and Brian challenging each other on the wall and maybe some grip strength challenges between the three of you.
So cool seeing both of you in an episode! Props to Eddie for being a good sport about something so hard for someone with his build.
You could have explained to Eddie that dabbing is like Hafthor double-dipping at the Viking press.  He probably would have chuckled, but if it he took it the wrong way may have keg tossed you over the bouldering wall. ;) ;) ;)
Damn he's that heavy and he's able to do some god damn.
Just the combination I never asked for, but loved anyway.
More Eddie, pls
Ngl I've been waiting for this one.
This collab I didn't know I wanted
That's literally gonna be me and then the guy falls 😂
Nice video but these beeps are quite annoying, wish you wouldnt censor so much
Did not expect this duo! Im only subsribed to magus for climbing and  Eddie for strongman so this was fun to watch.
The one thing that always blows me away with Eddie is how much of an athlete he is. Like he’s such a huge man yet so nimble and quick. He’d be faster than a lot of regular people yet he’s double the size or more.  You know the old saying of when there’s a real big guy that oh he wouldn’t be real quick but you wouldn’t want him to catch you cause you’d be stuffed, well with him most people will get caught lol.
Watching the worlds strongest man struggle in the same way I struggle as a beginner is so motivating
That would propably be very stupid and dangerous, but I'm interested hypotheticaly how good would be Magnus in climbing with 100kg weights. I think on some routes he could be quite good, as long as he doesn't injure himself.
Respect is respect all around
Nice! Next one with Hafthor Bjornson please.🙃
Im 270, this man is 100 pounds heavier and just going ham. I sometimes get creaky holds and cause spinners when i climb, I'm surprised he's not just ripping the holds straight off the wall
12:05 That was a rly smart ide
"The heaviest single repetition Turkish get-up is 76.56 kg (168 lb 8 oz), and was achieved by Chris Cox (Canada) in Elora, Ontario, Canada, on 9 January 2022." Just incase you were as curious as I was
wow....honestly? Mad respect to that man. He climbed VERY well. And for a man of his size he climbed excellent! I've been at it a decade and we've all seen the newbies... this man moves incredibly well. Loved this!
Where is this😊
Im IMPRESSED :O Eddie would make an amazing climber ifhe lost 30kg
A climber intending to have weak legs seems counter-intuitive. Could you expand on the reasoning and who would do such a thing? I'd have thought more muscles are always better.
My god, I’ve just had the worst drive on the M62 (any northerners in the UK will understand the pain of these roadworks). And this is literally the collab I’ve been waiting for. And the fact that it came as a reward for getting through the drive. THANK YOU MAGNUS AND EDDIE♥️
Ever since I've watched one of your vids I wanted to see Eddie Hall climbing with you. This is a little dream come true, THANK YOU! :)
Eddie is so good for a guy that heavy, amazing athlete!
I like how the world's strongest man is also nice and humble. It makes him even stronger :)
Magnus pumps out such great content. Great collab. I really liked seeing eddy hall.
You and Eddie are the only reasons I watch YouTube and I never imagined you collaborating together. My dreams came true! 😄
next thing is eddie on storror
Yeah buddy. Very impressive. 👏👏👏
Magnus and Eddie, not the combo I expected but delightful nonetheless.
What a good duo, great video.
Wanted to see this for a while, gland it happened! Magnus what an absolute pump guy you were you love building people up it's amazing! Never change!
That is a LOT of muscle holding Eddy back. Most of that's not going to help with climbing in general, so to see him do this well in a sport that's effectively the antithesis of his profession is impressive! Dude's definitely playing the game on Legendary difficulty.
I love this collab! Magnus it would be fun to see you try Strongman with Eddie next time
Magnus, after the wheel chair comment, I wonder if there are some leg amputees who climb, single or double like from some accident or for that matter, some people who were born without legs due to some condition, genetic or neonatal development. I bet that it would make for a really interesting, good and heart felt episode.
Really fun to watch. Thanks for the great collab. Eddie looking nice and hydrated as usual.
Great stuff
This is amazing, just a great teacher, and part mountain goat. He sticks to that wall. That's was so cool
Honestly I thought he was about to say that eddie is huge below the belt
Awesome video! I really love Magnus throwing the "we put a man on the moon" line back at Eddie whenever he was doubtful about his performance 🤣
Classic!
8:13 was a funny moment 😆"How the fk am I gonna do that?"
Eddie is such a nice guy great video
Those "foocking hell" had me laughing hard
Love the video. Around the end I found myself shouting “bench him! Overhead press him!”
Magnus you should strap 100 kilos to yourself and try and climb
Would be really funny seeing Magnus climbing with like 100 extra kilo and see how he performs compared to the beast
Eddie looks really healthy good for him👍
The collab I didn't know I wanted! This is great!
This is like bringing an elephant to a horse jumping match. But Eddie did pretty well haha
This makes me miss your colabs with Juji.  What's impressive is watching cheerleaders do the Turkish getup with a girl balanced on their hand
Eddie is a lot less obnoxious when he's in other creators videos
Eddie's calf's bigger than your future 😂
Would be pretty interesting to see Magnus Climb in a weighted vest, see how fat he could be and still capable
All I remember from this video, is that they put a man on the moon…
Eddie Hall is awesome. Great collab.
Wearing the climb all things shirt rn lol
I had a really shitty,  very sad week, and this channel  helped  me turn off, relax for a while.  Thank you guys.
I sense a grip strength video coming soon
I can't believe it! Wonderful! Hard to choose which one I should watch!
Would be interesting to have Eddie back when he transforms himself to prime condition as a bodybuilder. It will require a significant reduction in weight to get the required muscle definition, which will help his climbing. It would probably add good variety for him to do climbing as part of his body building training in the latter stages, it's all time under tension.
Eddie is not 6'3 and this video proves it
Get Thor in next time lol
Time do one with an actual astronaut. I heard in 1969 they actually put someone on the moon.
It was nice to see Eddie not being a complete and total tool turns out he can be a respectful human being when the time is right
"That's gonna be me ..." as the guy in the background ends up on his arse. 🤣
If Eddie invests in climbing, I'd love to see a series with you two! Like a semi-instructional/educational series.
You should see if you could get Jeff Cavaliere to climb with you. That would be an interesting video.
Dude with wheelchair skipping leg months!!
World record for that Turkis get up is 76.56 kg... Absolutely mental.
Holyfuckinshitballs.👏
Eddy Hall Climbing!!!  Best thing ever!
Eddie was also a competitive swimmer, into his teens. There’s a great video with Eddie and some ultra-dude Ross?
"we set your expectations way too low" "yeah, everyone does that" Dude... That hit hard
This was awesome! More Eddie!
Saying Eddie is the biggest star while having Ludwig on smh. Love the collab though!
Magnus doesn't even look that small compared to Eddie. Usually strongmen make other people look like children.
He's so funny!!!
11:46 Instead of beta I’ve always heard it referred to as the meta. Stands for “most effective technique available”. Might be a geographical thing, referred to differently in different communities/areas.
I love it Magnus!! Would have been so fun beeing there 😂
Eddie seems like such a kind soul :)
6:26 "you're stronger than you think"
When I first saw Norwegian Hulk I thought "it would be nice to see Eddie" but I was counting on measuring grip strength like earlier, nothing like that :) love this  episode
You know they put a man on the moon....allegedly
Magnus, you're the biggest star!
The Beast is the best possible guest you could have on your channel
Maaaaan what a legendary video Magnus! Love Eddie, always been inspired by him for strength training and also love what you're doing. Amazingly high quality content
Stunning to see a man his weight move so well
If he falls from the top does he die?
Now we need a video of magnus and Eddie doing Eddies strongman routine together
Eddie is such a nice guy😊
How long do you get out of one pair of shoes?
when they did the Turkish get up it was so nice to see magus being surprised that it wasn't so easy for him and i think it made him the most excited in the whole video
He did unbelievable on that blue one
1:45 *grips that kinda sus hold* "that's what you like huh"
interesting beta rhythms with meta
magnus: "see, you're stronger than you think!" 😂😂😂
Realy cool video 😂
Test
Magnus could coach anyone into climbing better then they ever thought, massive props to eddie for doing this
Amazing!
Definitely looking better Eddie not being so big 👍
I was literally just thinking today how cool it would be to see Eddie try climbing! Love this!
Yessssss🎉
magnus the climbing sport ambassador
For how heavy he is thats extremely impressive
Brilliant 🤙🏼
I love how dedicated Eddie is with everything he tries. There’s many times where I thought he’d just drop but he kept going.
Big up climbing hanger, love that place
Damn i did not expect him to get that high on the first blue first try. Eddie really is a beast. First time i bouldered i probably had 1,5 weeks sore fingers
The blue Eddie was stuck on is literally my current project - with Magnus saying just try skip the crimp and reach straight past it is probably the advice I needed 🤣
You should've had Eddie teach you how to deadlift!
Imagine if Eddy takes the strength lessons learned from climbing into his training career. What a different sense of being in good shape versus lifting strength.
The grades may not be that hard technically but he is huge and it takes a ton of strength and coordination to move that much mass up a wall. Very impressed for his first time climbing.
This was great! Eddie seems like a really charming guy. The chemistry and banter between you two is awesome.
He looks incredibly dense to be 170kg. That’s insane
this british animal spat into his hands before doing a hang challenge, stupidity + disgustingness, this is what you get by being a individual who associates himself with US + Britain, barbarianism
Eddie is a great sport, and did a great job.
Needed brian shaw and Robert oberst on this vid too! Content would've created itself! Great vid still
I have been looking forward to this video since the last with Eddie and I am not disappointed one bit. Firstly, I am flabbergasted how strong Eddie is being able to Hall all that mass up a wall. Secondly, the connection between you two is so natural, it's so fun to watch.
This would tone Eddie’s arms, back and stomach up which would be great for body building. I bet he climbs more often from now.
Wish I was at foundry when this was kicking off ;-(
get toby segar and the other storror lads on!
I have secretly been waiting for this colab.
Have to say I am really IMPRESSED with Eddie.
It's crazy what a difference 100 Kgs and 20 years of experience can make
I thought Magnus would smell the salts and climb a 9a. This is the colab that I didn't know i needed.
Maybe they should put bouldering as a strong man event for grip strength, it would be cool to watch them try and beat each other
Awesome channel only found it 2 days ago 👏 👏 👏
Eddie is the last person I expected you would climb with. He was amazing. Now I have no excuse with my 120kg.
What I love the most about this collab is how easy Magnus makes everything seem and how Eddie looks like he's constantly about to make the whole wall fall with him
I had this idea years ago when I got into watching you magnus, im so glad my unspoken idea came to fruition
Amazing video - Eddie is such a character! Next video needs to be Magnus with a 100kg weight vest…
So funny, if you ever piss off eddie, just climb…
I bet the staff would we watching the 175kg Eddie nervously thinking god I hope the holds take his weight 😂😂
Awesome video
Beauty
my new favorite channel - I wanna go climb!
Can't say I saw this collab coming, but god damn am i here for it
As someone who’s never done indoor or outdoor climbing, I can’t believe how much value I get out of this channel. It’s hard not to appreciate the elite. Doesn’t matter what field you’re in, if you’ve ground your way to the top, you’re bound to intriguing and inspirational.
Honestly, I didn't think Eddie would be able to climb anything. He is definitely smaller than he was, but he still weighs 370 lbs. Is more flexible than I thought he would be. Also I agree with you that he is intimidating.
Magnus, the 2020 Europe's stongest man is a guy called Luke Richardson. It would be fascinating to see you climb with him because he was actually a decent climber before he got into strength.
This video was so much fun to watch! Props to Eddie for climbing as well as he did, a true Beast indeed :D  You should 100% invite Chris Herria to try climb with you!
Those walls and grips are getting weight tested!
Magnus x Eddie x Juji ???
Half the video I was expecting Eddie to take off his mask and it be Magnus in disguise part 4!
A proper strongman
they put a strong man on the moon..!
Dude EDDIE is such a savage. That is so insane he can do that.
Gold content! Both sides of the spectrum i love it
I wanted to see you belay him
Didn't expect this!!
I never thought I´d see a 170kg. human climb a wall! But I gotta say, I´m really impressed!
If you know anything about Eddie you will know that he would never been known as being really bad at anything physical, he will give his all just so he is better than a few people
That first climb Eddie does, he looks like King Kong climbing the Empire State building! 😄  I'd back Eddie against King Kong in an arm wrestle! 💪
the moon banter had me laughing a couple times, good video. Eddie is always a blast
im very impressed by eddies climbing skills he has way more flexibility and strength for his body weight and height then i first thought, i wanna see my all time favourite strongman brian shaw try climbing hes a giant
Dude is a beast, looks like a bear climbing. (I don't mean that in a mean/making fun of him way) also when he was saying something like "I don't think I can do that" more than half of the time I'm pretty sure he meant like he was scared the holds would fall off the wall if he hung on it.
i could feel this video coming, and i was so excited, i knew eddie has been on the collaboration game lately, and it was only a matter of time before you two crossed paths.
Magnus, this is as amazing as it is unexpected! Eddie comes from a place not far from me here in Yoekshire  UK. He is an absolute legend. So, two legends in one film. Amazing to see how he adapted and did so well on the bouldering walls. Kudos to both of you :-)
Didn’t see this collaboration coming but I’m liking it.
Now get Ross Edgley
such a great climbing and strongman collaboration video,love both of your content.I do bouldering at 110kg and its not easy never mind 170kg, impressive.
How amazing you got the best powerlifter in the world, now I want to see Simone Biles (best gymnast) climb, Michael Kingsbury (best bump skier), who else? I love seeing the best in their discipline just try climbing with Magnus!
Eddie missed his calling I think. He could prune his weight and be amazing,.
it's all interesting to see how he was able to follow instructions even under great mental load. top athlete
WHAT is this feat? I didn't start the video yet. I'm already amazed. Awesome!!!  Eddie!!!
hope we can see more eddie in the future
Super cool Eddie went for it :) What a great guy! Fun video thanks!
cut out a bit around 8 minutes
I love the chart at @6:36. I like how the levels are depicted s overlapping, so a hard green is an easy orange, a hard orange is an easy blue, etc. It's helpful to remember the difficulty is a smooth gradient.
You should invite an armwrestler to see how their grip and arm strenght turn into climbing
Magnus I bet you could climb his rock 😂
His calves are unreal
These are literally my 2 favourite athletes together what the hell man? 😂
I think that was actually Adam Ondra disguised as a heavy man. Reverse prank.
Just wait until Eddie tries shampooing his hair the next day, lol.
Would love to see a "rematch" between Eddie and Thor but this time the competition is rock climbing lmao
bro I dream of having Eddies calves
You know what they say about men with big hands....     Big gloves.
For him, crimps a lot more grips are crimps.
For some reason it is funny to hear Magnus say, “you are stronger than you think” to one of the strongest people on the planet 😄
Eddie's calves are crazy
Shirt never came off.. impressive 😂
Awesome video Magnus!
I wanted this to happend!!!!!
Yes! Been waiting for a video like this from these two!
Great job Eddie, great to see you enjoyed it also. Climbing is a great sport and keeps you ripped.
Wich athlese has the best pysic for climbing if you start from 0? Handball? Gymnast? MA?
When I was watching eddie and magnus content at the same time I’ve day dreamt about this. Now it’s happening
This was such a good video, and a great collab!! Please tell me Magnus you will also be trying a bit of strongman training!?
For his size he is amazing at climbing way above expectations
Magnus u should try collabing with Jason Mamoa  he is I recently saw that he is climbing enthusiast.
Awesome video, what a cool guy
Man, this has to be my favourite episode ever. They have such good chemistry. You can sense that Magnus is a bit on his guard around a big star like Eddie, but they seem to have hit it right off. And Eddie is such a good sport to Magnus' encouragement and very subtle teasing. Despite being simply intimidating physically, he's likeable to the degree of being cute. In a bigmouthed, bighearted, french bulldog kind of way. Remember, a bulldog that still could involuntarily crush you without noticing it. I was actually scared Magnus might get pancaked by Eddie simply rolling over at 17:35, forgetting he has invited a giant to the gym. Also I'm surprised that Eddie knows virtually nothing about climbing and has never tried it before. And even more surprised how well he does given that and his weight. You can tell he is absolutely up for any challenge. What a great match. So, now for the rest of the video.
First video I’ve seen were Magnus dint take his top off lol
Wow this is prolly my favorite one of your videos, Eddie was so good at rock climbing and he had pretty good technique.
"you've literally got a better chance at fucking king Charles in the ass" is my new favorite saying
He's good
*former
Unfortunately Eddie demonstrated himself to be a rather poor role model in a recent video of his arrest.
I'm not surprised Eddie can climb, but when Magnus was  talking about roping I thought, Who the hell is going to hold the rope? Imagine catching a 400 lb pendulum!
Woa, interesting Collab
Magnus hassss to do strongman again!!! I wanna see how much he can bench!!
Eddie is such a positive person, my face always smiles when he’s around 😂 keep up with a good work both of you!!!
I never saw this collab coming.. and I love it.
I only hope this guy was not a bully when he was a kid
Magnus should wear weights to match Eddies weight and make it a fair fight.
Met him at my work a couple months ago, sound guy tbh
Have Jason Momoa next time, it could be also fun! :)
Had to watch this on both channels. Eddie's Turkish Get-Up could use a little work, but to be fair he's doing a bottom's up version which is much harder than the normal imo.
What a colab! Two hard working successful professionals, and entertaining content creators. You both are an inspiration to so many! Keep doing what you love!
1:44 I know that I am not the only person laughed hard at this point :D
"Now that is a guy who has been eating a lot of beef!"      Uncle Jimbo
Eddie seems extremely likeable and friendly. Didn't he have that one blunder, smack talking in that boxing match haha? Oh well.
I would love to see you put some kind of weight vest on, to match his weight, then climb :)  maybe even wear super fluffy clothing to match his volume too
NGL I thought Eddie was gonna fall off the wall and crush Magnus a few time
dude this video was so hype, i couldn't help but get super psyched every time he did something i didn't think he could possibly do
Where's this climbing gym?
YES IVE WAITED FOR THIS FOR SO LONG FINALLY 😁😁
I love that you open their minds to the seriousness of bouldering. Strongmen definitely should do it once in a while 💟
I'm a complete beginner. Feels good to hear Eddie say all the same comments I have, we've got the same level.... But I'm 90kg 😭 he's a legend
Eddies is a great guy. good to see him on the channel.
woah Eddie is a phenomenal guest!!!
Norwegian Beast is also really strong, obviously, but he is sweating and out of breath quite quickly.  Eddie is the same weight but can move like a much lighter person.
wow! Hands up[ for Eddie Hall :O
I see Eddie I click like, simple
What a genuinely nice guy. I think what impressed me more than Eddie's sheer strength was his willingness to attempt something he knew would be a real challenge for him, and to keep going and learning and always trying to improve.  No wonder he was the World's Strongest Man with such a great mindset.  Whilst I will never be a strongman or a rock climber, seeing things like this does inspire me to work to be a better version of myself and be happy with my personal growth, however small it might be, rather than comparing myself against others.
You should have tried climbing with him with an extra 100 kilos on you!
6:26 'You're stronger than you think!' of all people to say it too😅😅
what a fun duo to watch
I'm a simple man. I see a video with Eddie Hall, I click and like. I see Magnus with him, I smash like again and start my like-bot... ;)
Magnus did a really good job teaching in this video.
I felt bad for the holds 😂
Min-maxed athleticism in two totally different ways. Awesome vid!
Magnus make that look to easy 😂
My two most watched YouTubers COMBINE THEIR POWERS!? Just need Anton fimenko in there too haha
I was predicting this collab would happen. I’m impressed w/ his climbing, & Magnus is probably the best guy to introduce you into the sport. solid content cheers
At 2:15 when Eddie asks “why do you do that” to jamming your foot into climbing shoes 😂
Whenever Eddie was climbing and his breath was like a tornado through the mic I was dying hahahaha, awesome vid
Lets not underestimate how much weight the dude has to pull up every time, massive bloke
Magnus, you should make an entire video just climbing hard boulders with your arms only. It’s pretty aesthetic and cool looking!
I love how delicate the last handshake were! :D
Nice work Eddie. Climbing as a big guy is not even slightly easy.
My favorite video ever is Eddie going to the Karen restaurant
Absolute the best collab ever!
i love to watch eddies vids and now with the collab its hillarious how often you have to bleep him out, its so unusual for your videos
Great job Magnus and Eddie!! Maybe next weight lifting?
Lol magnus' forearm wasn't that much smaller then eddies
Bad etiquette from Eddie to kick a guy off the climb/area he wanted to do when he wasn't ready to go..😔
Love these kinds of collaborations!
Wow this guy was way stronger than I thought he did very well
Eddie seems so muscly and menacing, but in reality he is such a nice guy
Ludwig then this? we are being TREATED by mr midtbo
Eddie has a great sense of humor; great video.
all my favorite creators are collabing recently its wild lol
Impressive thing is, is that he is still technically power lifting just pulling himself up the wall
Good luck bodybuilding eddy!
Eddie is such a wholesome person. Great colab
"I can hang for 1 min 50 sec" *Falls after 0:25*, yeah i'd pay money to see that prove to be a lie XD
This collab is gold
I liked the Francis Bourgeois reference that he made.
I sit in a chair behind a desk 24/7 but unfortunately it hasn't made me a better climber yet 😂😂
Wow.
Eddie Hall 400KG Deadlift and V6 same day in the future?!
Really impressive on that blue
two lengends. pleasure to watch
Love the British dialect :))
it's crazy how far you get with just pure strength and a bit of know how. i'm pretty average fitness and my first time on the bouldering wall i could barely do anything.
So strong to be able to climb at all at that weight. Impressive.
What a nice jab to all the haters: - “we set your expectations way too low” - “well, everyone does that.”  Either Magnus missed it, or it was his polite nonchalance that did. ;)
Imagine thor or Shaw. They would just tip toe to reach the top 😂
bro looks like king kong climbing the empire state building
W video
I think someone like Martins Licis would be really good at climbing as he's very athletic and flexible for someone his size
Imagine if Eddie was hydrated
Love your channel Magnus, next time try like professional fighter vs rock climbing, that'd be interesting. Or gymnast or smth.
Did not expect this collab. Quality
The beast who beat the mountain ^^
Magnus 1:45 : grabs phallic hold "this is what you like right?"
not a fan of eddie hall, this however was impressive. it was a pleasure to actually see eddie humble
@22:20 interesting that they mentioned using climbing to train for grip strength. One of the main goals of climbing is learning how to move your body efficiently. I think the potential for cross training with climbing for an athlete goes well beyond just grip and pull strength, you learn how to use your muscles much more efficiently with climbing and that's going to transition to your main sport.
Awesome colab! You've gotta get Brian Shaw on, you two are the grip kings in my opinion. It would be awesome to see you do his grip gauntlet.
I don't think I've seen you this shy before haha. Don't blame you though, Eddie hall is an intimidating dude
It cannot be just me seeing what Magnus is grabbing at 1:45...
Can’t believe he’s hauling nearly 200kg up that wall 😂 Eddie’s a legend
this was incredible to watch. so much humor and also so much insperation. i loved every minute of watching it. you guys have great chemistry!
If ever in doubt, just remember that in 69, they put a man on the moon😂
Super cool dude. I love the variety of people you have on. It's cool to see an athlete try a different sport.
Amazing getting Eddie on, and he's intelligent, pivoting into body-building for health, after such a massive powerlifting career. He definitely has an acting career in mind....
Great video. Good chemistry between you two.
Nie żeby coś, ale pudzian silniejszy
Absolutely amazing to see a guy this size being able to do as good as this.
Doing a sitstart while being 170kg just shows how insanely strong he is
Very good !
6:26 lol, Magnus telling the strongest man in the world - you are stronger than you think :) basically entering Thor levels of strength lol
Eddie is surprisingly good
Jesus Christ died for all of our sins. He died the death we all deserved. He was the perfect one who never sinned once, but he loved us so much he decided to die for us so our sins would be paid for and we can enter the Kingdom of Heaven before God the Father blamelessly. He is the living son of God who wants to know us and have a personal relationship with us. No matter  what you have done no matter how far gone you think you are Jesus can and will save you. All you have to do is confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Savior. Believe that he died on the cross for your sins and had a bodily resurrection 3 days later. We cannot be saved by our works but by faith in Christ alone. Repent and turn to Christ. You will have joy, happiness, love, and peace beyond understanding.
FINALLY THE ULTIMATE ATYPICAL SPORT YOUTUBE COLAB!!!! LOVE YOU BOTH!!!
Thank you Magnus. I have always wondered how good of a climber a strongman would be. Especially Eddie hall who has a height advantage
The best collab ever!!!!
I always forget Eddie Hall is british, and I get surprised when he talks
No one never went to the moon
Never seen Eddie Hall smile so much! great video!
Magnus, do a session with "The mountain", from GoT :)
Funniest person in your vs rock climbing series by far! "Can't I use that hold instead?" lmaoooo
Eddie vapes ?
awesome content Magnus you’ve earned yourself a subscriber my friend 💪
Just wow!
Two legends meet up and do Videos - amazing
Sick video Magnus
damn, I wanna try climbing, too - but Im too scared to go alone 😀
Hey Magnus, you choosed very well your Guest again…he is a very sympathic Guy!! Great Video!
Magnus might be a moon denier, possibly even a flat earther. 💩
I think... That Eddie and Magnus is now one of my favorite duos
Was very shocked how well Eddie did on the lay down blue run around the 13:30 mark. Very impressive
Good sport impressive explosiveness
He slothed the ending on that last blue, as a bigger guy (obviously not that big) explosive tends to be easier because the balance of larger chest and glutes pulls you off the wall 😬 truly impressive stuff
All of this guys videos just keep getting better
"You're stronger than you think" <--- said to the world's strongest man human
his technique is actually really good for a first timer. you should host a competition between eddie and juji!
Magnus finally meets his match... With chalk usage.
Eddie impulsively grabbing the bench with his calves cracked me up
This two men make me believe they send a man on the moon very cool video and a lot of streght in it 👍🏻👍🏻 keep up the amazong work
This guy is so chill. I could see myself drinking beer with him.
I love how Eddie just been doing all these side things from strongman
Love seeing this collab come to be!
Wow, two of my favourite youtubers!
For that big of a guy its very impressive he can climb to that level.
19:50 green done, orange done, blue done... (dramatic pause, nods with the head "got something to say about it, mate?! good!") purple now!
Seeing Eddie so humble...I almost didn't recognize him. Loads of fun. Magnus, you are the GOAT.
Eddie is truly impressive
this is the strongman/weightlifting and climbing combo that I've been wanting this whole time
That's pretty crazy that he did so well this guy is 3.4 times my weight
i swear the other day i was watching your video and thinking id love to see Eddie Hall The Beast rock climbing with Magnus hahaha awesome!
I couldn’t stop smiling this whole video. Eddie is such a wholesome, kind dude.
Literally a legendary video, loved it
You inspired me to do climbing.
Look at @6:45 how the floor dips under Eddie and compare it to how Magnus barely makes a dent. Crazy!!
interesting to see these two at my local climbing gym.
MAGNUS!!! YOUR ADVICE TO KEEP YOUR HIPS CLOSER TO THE WALLS HELPED ME FIGURE OUT THE V4 I’VE BEEN TRYING SO HARD TO DO
8:10 what are those claves???
Should have had Magnus do the deadhang with 100kg added weight! That would have been interesting!
Don’t give him too much grief at the gym or he will drive over your car with a tank 😉🤣
What a cross-over! really like Eddie Hall!
I was scared as hell he would rip the holds out of the wall 😂
The little look at the camera at 19:45 😂
Incredible! Top work gentleman!🤙💪🔥
props to you magnus this is one of your best vids yet man
This proves that muscle size doesn’t matter
18:40 Hey man, this is actually a mistake. Friction doesn't depend on a surface area of the contact. Only on normal force applied which is perpendicular to the surface and materials. Just a correction no hate intended. Great content!
I want to se u climb more without legs.
Magnus a little star struck 😁
Haha Eddie is just a big Teddy. Sure a Teddy that can rip your fucking head off but he's such a sweetheart
Not even a week ago I posted om Thor's page about contacting you for climbing. So glad you posted a video of a strongman, esp someone like Eddie Hall to go and try climbing.
Love Eddie
Watching Eddie climb I appreciate much more what an absolute fucking unit the man is.  What's funny is I think of him as one of the smaller strong men. Wtf.
Lol that climbing centre is just the road from me. x,D I was planning to go this week, perhaps I would have caught you.
Wow the colab i didn't know i wanted damnn. ALSO 170KG doing that is insane fk me. We need part to and do some metrics with eddie.
13:54 Eddie almost rammed 2 guys
Been waiting a long time for this colab
I follow both of you guys that was awesome :D and I was really surprised with Eddies climbing, no excuse with being heavier climber for me lol xD
It's crazy how the strongest guy in the world can struggle with this. Climbing requires a whole different type of strength! Though, because he's the strongest man, he is VERY good for a first time climber.
I see 2 dick rocks. 😅
Does anyone know the name of the facility they used to film this?
FINALLY, let's go
Ok genuine question - what's the weight limit for a hold? Like, if he's 170kg, will he just rip the holds off the wall at like 200kg?
*eddie* "that's literally gonna be me in a hour's time"   *guy falls down*
Loved eddie, such good energy and fun
Great video! Keep up the great work!!
These collabs are amazing. Haven't even watched yet but I'm excited
Next time strongman training with Eddie pls haha
Been Waiting for this since Juji and Devon!! We need a Strongman Reunion CLimb!!!!
Hey Magnus! I’d love to have you on my podcast to talk about your climbing career! Let me know if you’d be interested!
This was so much more fun to watch than I thought coming in. These two get along so well and Magnus being as stubborn and knowledgeable as he is might be the best person to push Eddie past what we all thought he could do
Yes! The collaboration I thought would never happen now you just have to get Brian Shaw out with you guys!
Eddie is so fuckin athletic for his size! Increddible!
nice
My two favourite youtubers collabing
*That guy, that is gonna be me in an hour*  Literally after he says it, the guy falls down.  bahaha :D
Bro what is this collab 💀 I LOVE IT
Magnus you had to wear a 100kg weight vest for this would have been so interesting 😂😭
Please tell me Eddie has told you to collab with Brian Shaw and Robert Oberst? I think it would be amazing seeing them try this
Awesome collab!!
“Just remember they put a man on the moon” as he casually dangles with one arm 😂😂
ive seen a bunch of eddie hall videos but i dont think ive ever heard his accent
Caught this by mistake but what a fantastic show of sheer power !
Let's gooooo! Magnus collecting every cool collab he can
He is doing great!
God eddie looks so much more terrifying with facial hair.
Probably one of the only 170kg guys that could do that
23:30 The beast got humbled real quick😂
This is the unexpected collab I really wanted to happen ... without knowing it myself! And I'm impressed with the climbing abilities of Eddy!
I am a little surprised Magnus didn't ask for pull-ups. I wonder if that is possible with 170 kg.
I would love to see Brian on that wall😂
Being big is not your friend. I did a lot of climbing in my 30s, but I weighed 220lbs., and it makes it harder. I can’t imagine climbing at his size.
Magnus, you'd better chalk up the monetization on this one :D
My two favourite sport guys in one video. Couldn't be more happy.
Funny how the 2 channels I subscribe to are merged in this show.  So proud of Eddie for taking this on and doing so well!!!  Great episode. Thanks Magnus.
You're videos are too long
Straight up another killer video!! Eddie is such a cool and genuine person!
I see custom made shoes for you, in the very near future!  Mahalo for the knowledge!
Big HALL on a small Wall😮
Loved this.
for 170kg he did freaking amazingly well. Eddie climbed much much better than most of the average sized beginners.
The way he's able to brute force those walls and almost skip the tecnique is really impressive
Edd should try children boulders those can be real difficult for adults
No wayyyyyy  This is more wild than when Martins and Action Bronson did a collab
Spectacular collab 🔥🔥
Man seeing Eddie climb maybe I could be doing it instead of just watching magnus
I can't wait for a collab with Eddie and Brian doing some climbing and destroying the gym by tearing out all of the holds!  (with the gyms permission of course)
Almost lost his face at 9:20
Hey it would be great to see how well you do with a 100kg weighted backpack! Maybe on your front to simulate the belly (sorry Eddie 😉). Would be very interesting to see that video. It's must be a MASSIVE difference. It's over double your weight righ? About 70kg?
Eddie, this is your most impressive feat!
Cool!
Eddie "I'm a fit guy" Hall
Dude man is a living Giant!!!!
Loved this one! Next Brain Shaw hahaha
Har sett videoer av dere begge, og gøy å se dere sammen!
Omg when Eddie tells the person that ‘he is on here’ 😳 that person prob shit themselves hahahah shout out from Belfast Eddie you done the uk proud for the size of ye ya absolute rocket ❤️
Who uses more Chalk, Magnus or Brian Shaw?
15:14
You should meet up with Chris Heria for climbing and calisthenics session
10:12 Magnus invites beginners to learn new tricks like this for his next video disguised as a beginner. 🤣😂🤣
Eddy is such a legend, its fun to see him climbing and struggle a bit.
awesome video :) I really like these videos. I like to climb to, and I'm also heavy, so this was nice to see :)
like a mountain goat teaching a rhino to climb mountains
Old Scandinavian chess sets had so-called 'berserkers' for rooks (a lot stonger than knights): these were ivory figurines of soldiers biting their shields. You will find them in the Lewis chessmen. I'd imagine such a 'beast' fulfilling that role.
Can we stop calling Eddie the worlds strongest man’s when that’s not what he is :)
I don't think that wall will ever be cursed at the way The Beast has. Jolly good show, ol' chap
As if this Colab happened!!! This is amazing
Love the video Magnus, and I gotta say, I watched both videos (no offense to Eddie, love the guy, love the channel <3) Magnus your's is really well done (all of your content is always top notch) but the audio, the editing and the shots are just a step above and I gotta commend you on that! Well done!! Keep up the great work! Much love to the guys shooting and editing!
Eddie's a big baby with too much ego though... Still remember what he said to Larry back then...
Now there's a gritty duo!!! The lean & the mean!
Awesome video, seeing Eddie climb is so cool! Lifting huge makes you a strongman, but a strongman being mobile and climbing is a superman :D
eddie hall, the teddy on wall
You are a gentleman and a scholar.
👍😎👍
Seems hard when this big, even if he was in shape. Wonder how Thor would do
Great content!
This is what i've been waiting for
He is better than most skinny beginners!
When Eddie said "easy" with first blue hold I laughed with him then did it and my jaw drop just wow. Great video definitely have Eddie on more.
@13:35 This is actually very impressive, damn Eddie
what a sight
GOATED DUO
This may be my favorite of your collabs, and that's a tough competition
I like how the editing missed several F bombs 🤣🤣🤣
Now I want to see Magnus put on a weighted vest up to Eddies weight and try climbing something.
Eddie "lost weight", which in his case means 30kg off from his competition form of just 200Kg.
Great Video! I would love to see some of your guests get the perspective of the fingerstrength on the Campus Board:) Just so they see how ridiculous climbing gets :D
I dont want to see him climb. I just want to see if he can rip the holds off the wall.
Impressed with the climb Eddie, also cool to see Magnus did this colab
This is so much fun to watch, love the vibe! And I really thought the 80kg world record Eddie mentions at the end was a calculation error, but if google is correct it actually is fucking 76.56 kg. Which is proper insanity.
that was soo good
This video is an amazing example of how humans can train their bodies to be so incredibly strong in such different ways 💪🦾
That flash attempt on the blue was awesome. Sit start as a big guy is no joke.
As someone coming from a football power lifting world and being 275-250 and now climbing and slimming down this is a masterpiece
title says world's strongest man, but that's not Hafthor?
I got nervous every time he jumped down. I would have told him to land and quickly land on his butt
the first inverted rope underwater rock climb!!!!
Men have walked on the moon but have they ever climbed it?
This was actually a really entertaining video 👌
King Charles has to watch his ass now...
There's something pleasant about this channel, no gimmicks, no forced wacky outtakes, no jarring editing, just an extremely talented individual teaching others about his passion. Its great.
Just remember, they put a man on the moon in 1969.
Magnus you should carry a backpack with a 100kg to match Eddies weight and see if you can climb the same boulders. It would be interesting
this has to be one of the funniest collab ever!!
Good entertainment
25:22 😆 That moment when Magnus picks up the weight :)
I didn't know you could move mountains for living
Honestly impressed!
Absolutely LOVE this
im a member at this gym and weigh almost half the amount of eddie hall, his first time climbing is really cool and quite impressive
great gon bigman
beta originates from "betamax" - where climbers would share their betamax recordings of their climbs aka their beta :)
6:26 Magnus: "You're stronger than you think"   It's literally the strongest person alive standing right in front of you😂
16:18 its the cameraman that was with TGF bro at some point
Ah, eddie hall the man known for how nimble and agile he is.
Can I get the names of the background songs please!
I would have given him the blue too!!!
HELLYA!! I hope this turns into a repeated collab, even mix it up and have a eating competition vs eachother lol
Good video, but not the chemistry that Magnus has with Juji, Devon or some of the other guys. But I think they should do a few more videos together.  Both are swell guys who are willing to try anything. It can only become more epic.
Strong man... here I thought Magnus was going to climb with the REAL strong man, a *MOUNTAIN* of a man...  Instead we get this Hall guy which can't even throw a decent punch and goes into a boxing match with only haymakers and hail mary's.    Pass on this one, better luck next time.
Eddie proving why they call him The Beast. He really gives everything 110% effort.
Really great video! Invite more sportsmen please! And what about collab with Storror guys?
Simply incredible
Eddie wasnt climbing, he was powerlifting his body up the wall.
Yeeeees!! Dream video!🎉
Love this, when Eddie comes of the first attempt at the orange and starts trying to figure out the beta, that's another one hooked.  I love this sport!
Eddie makes so many excuses.
Did he really say "You're stronger than you think" to Eddie Hall?
Man on the moon saying got me motivated
Wow
Eddie is so charismatic! Surreal skill for his size.
Norwegian and a brit.. trying to stuff... go..:D epic
The heaviest single repetition Turkish get-up is 76.56 kg (168 lb 8 oz), and was achieved by Chris Cox (Canada) in Elora, Ontario, Canada, on 9 January 2022.
very french starts from eddie
Come to Canada 🇨🇦 and climb our mountains ⛰️ i
The weights in Magnus’ hand seem so much smaller in the other dude’s… 😅
Who else started singing along with Spider pig?
you can see the wall move when eddy climbs 😬
Eddie is so damn humble. Love to watch him trying a different sport
I have been silently wanting this co-lab for forever!
I mentioned about a colab with Eddie and you after you'd been to Wideboyz crack cellar and suggested Eddie for the cellar as a joke, now the colab's happened 🤯 Eddie's vids showed me how to lift with proper technique and about diet warm up etc. Yours are just damned good fun with a great guy.
Eddie’s a bit of a tosser tho
What I prefer about Eddie is that he tries EVERYTHING. He's just passionate, he loves sport, and he just want to discover as much things as he can.  That's how I am, and therefore I just love seeing it in some other people. We don't see a lot of world class athlete try different things, getting out of their comfort zone.
Absolutely loving this video. Eddie always makes me laugh and magnus videos are always consistently entertaining. One of the best videos on the channel for me.
I love this! Next you need to get a flexible artist like Sofie Dossi on. I bet they'd make great climbers.
Eddie is climbing this wall like a bear climbs a tree - slow and steady. Even his appearance is similar (incl. shirt color)
I'm also a bulky heavy weightlifter who just started climbing recently. I'm glad to see that Eddie struggles just as much as I am, it's big self esteem boost!
He beat The Mountain, but I'm not so sure he could climb one, lol
Such an interesting video
Eddie is a genuinely top all round athlete and guy! great Collab Magnus, Would love to see him the day after this, bet he hasnt been sore like it in years
Hahahahah
Thanks for a fun video!  Glad he didn’t injure his tendons!
“We’re on here mate” would have me running for the hills. Clearly Eddie is a decent guy but intimidating all the same. Great fun video
Holy shit this is good content!
I am currently working with the Princess Beast who is 6'3" and about 315. I love to find footage of large ppl learning to climb. As a 6' 250lbs guy I'm not that small either. I'm impressed with how well Eddie did and I appreciate the training at the end. Great video overall.
I was so worried for his knees every time he jumped down. As a heavier guy myself, the impact at even relatively low heights can be concerning lol
this wall is really hold 170 kg. this is hardly strong equipment.
Keep in mind Eddie weights around 375! The fact that he can climb these is amazing strength.
Amazing video. It's entertaining to see a huge guy like him, to climb.
No way…
Magnus, you've turned your channel into some really fun stuff. Always enjoyed watching you climb.
im just imagining him being like hmmm,,, nah i'll just *picks up the mountain he was gonna climb* there we go
Loved this
Bro imagine being that heavy and climbing a wall. Eddie is strong af
Anyone else thinking that they should do a fresh grip strength challenge?
The amount of force on his finger tendons is terrifying to think about
Great video
His threshold for pain is higher because of all the lifting he has done. I noticed initially he wouldn't give up on certain grips even if it hurt where a beginner would normally give up the moment it burned or became uncomfortable.
Oh yeah, the title should be "climbing with the guy that got knocked out by the worlds strongest man"
This is like watching a chimpanzee teach a gorilla how to do chimpanzee activities
I like how those strong guys are pretty chill usually :)
awesome collaboration!! love the video 😋
Poor king Charles
One of those collabs you never expect but makes sense when you know they probably have a lot of the same followers
I'm a 45 year old female with a normal hand size and I've managed to do reps with a 60kgs gripper with two fingers. Actually i've also managed a single rep with one finger 😊
And he committed  to the crazyiest drop in on a vert ramp!
Next video, Magnus wears a 100kg weight vest
BEST VID EVER LOVE U EDDIE
"you stronger than you think"
Eddie, is so positive Man:):)
Eddie Wall x Magnus the motivator
He's more flexible than I expected
Honestly Eddie really reminds me of a swole Tom Holland hahaha.
there's no way that turkish get up thing is harder than it looks. its fucking terrifying. im anxious watching magnus do it cuz i feel like that thing gon fall right on his face. just like cave him in. i would never. like never.
Respect!
I wonder how much grip strength improvement that rock climbing will do for weight lifting or body building.  Certainly some, but enough that body builders should think of incorporating rock climbing into their routine?
Magnus, I have thought of something: a (kind, of course) competition between two very different sport people. For example this guy vs a girl enrolled in gymnastics, or for example a 5,000 m runner vs a 100 m sprinter. It sounds great fun... in my mind at least.
When two legends meet my two heros
Do it for Ed!
Not the collab I knew I needed, but sure enough I needed it
Biggest star? You had Adam Ondra and Alex Honnold?
9 minutes in and I'm really impressed, entertained and am really enjoying Magnus teaching Eddie Hall.
"you know they put a man on the moon right?" ahhaha
It’s very interesting watching both of your videos and seeing the different editing styles
Awesome to see you guys enjoying my local gym
Magnus were you not tempted...just a little bit to reach out and start tickling Eddie during the hang 🤣. Another great colab. 👍
lol i just realize that magnus has 1,6mio subscribers. The last number i had in my head was around 400k :O
Weirdest combination of my subscriptions in a long time.  Worlds are colliding, Jerry!
That was just awesome. I’ve been watch both you and Eddie for years so to have you together is just so much fun!
Great episode! Though I must say, whoever was behind the camera, really didn't do a good job :(
Hans Niemann worked out
been subscribed to you for a few weeks now but been subscribed to eddie for years your both pretty awesome in different ways. Super glad to see the colab
the man on the moon bit sent me
Eddie seems one of the nicest guys for his size.
It would be great to see his progress if he went twice a week for a month.
I didn't realize Eddie was that short
You should've gotten Brian Shaw here with Eddie, it would be perfect hahaha
I thought Eddie was much leaner these days. Glad to see his iconic belly is not gone.
NOMI NO SUKUNE II...
170kg climb like nothing only ed can do it =] =]
19:42 "we'll say... yep..." lmfaooo Magnus is too kind to the Iron Giant!
They are both so humble ❤
That was incredible to Watch how Eddie climbed!
This was incredible 😂 for a guy his size and climbing first time… I reckon he nailed it. Don’t think anyone would have gotten this far.
dude is literally Kratos with hair
Eddie is definetely good first timer
Even tho Eddie and hafthor are "gruel" looking guys. They still are so wholesome, lovely looking proper chaps they are
damn he is f good
ure stronger then u think :D
6:24 Magnus casually complimenting strongest man: "you're stronger than you think"
What a good sport; and well done. Props!
No way! You got Eddie to climb. So cool
Impressive for such a big dude.
Eddie is invading every youtuber in my algorithm
I would love to see you have a climbing competition you and Eddie Hall While matching his weight with a weighted vest
In cinncinati there is a man that holds 2 world records for turkish getups, he is also a very strong climber who turned a church into his own climbing gym.
WOW! Two of my favorite guys together in one video. This was an absolute treat. Eddie is always down to earth super funny and wholesome. He took direction really well. + Magnus is continuing the best possible YT video streak I have seen. Not ONE bad video and they just keep getting better and better. Nice one!
Wait That's not Mariusz Pudzianowski
Dudes got the most fire colabs ngl
I been watching Eddie all along. As well as his son's channel. I didn't expect a collab.
Im surprised the world's strongest man didn't tear a rock out of the wall
it's crazy how good he is at talking, and he's so good on camera. A very likeable person. All while being one of the strongest men on earth. Cool dude.
Now you should get The Mountain to do rock climbing
Yo editor, what's up with all these cuts while Eddie's on the wall?? That's the shit I came here to see.
Celebert møte det her :O Rått med collab med Eddie!
Smiles all the way through. You guys are sound
holy shit, the two you tubers i have been watching the most recently, and they suddenly do a collab, this is so cool
Magnus getting the British banter when he gave back the man on the moon comment xD
This is so amazing to watch, and you can see just how STRONG Eddie is!  He's a HUGE guy, and the fact that he's been able to make such progress on the walls shows not only how strong he is, but also that he's a profressional athlete with an attitude that doesn't let him give up!
waiting for magnus to climb with alan walker
Magnus climbing up to show eddie the hold had me dead 😂 8:37
he has insanly good technique like using the toes instead of his whole foot
We need another video ASAP. This was one of my favourites. Hoping Eddie will incorporate climbing into his training. I'm sure it will help.
Ayo it's Eddie! Been wanting to see this man climb for a while!
Aren't Turkish get ups supposed to be no hands?
Two of my fav athletes in one video? Amazing 🎉
NICE! Didn't expect you guys to make a video!!
Eddie: “F****** h***”  Magnus: “yep”
Elsker deg, Magnus! Is it too late to start climbing at 28 for a non athlete?
I'm surprised this climbing wall was able to hold Eddy's weight :D
Eddie's hardest lift is lifting his body onto the wall
"I want you to shine." 💖🥹 I love Magnus.
Finger tendon soreness from climbing is the most strange feeling my hands felt numb/sore and weak
I wanna see what eddie would look like after 6 months of extreme rock climbing training and a reduction in his normal (massive) diet.
Finally, two of my favorite youtubers!
Noo way haha
Yeah ;-)
I love that you’re here in the UK Magnus! Welcome!
Are you wearing a medium size rungne shirt?
Magnus put a go pro on his head for half the video and didn’t use any of the footage 😂😂😂
You’ve never looked so lanky Magnus
Wow you net a *long* time ago! Good bloke, Eddie. Lovely collaboration.
What grade are that blues?
Eddie did wayyy better than I expected
Such a great personality =) Eddie is such a treat to watch =)
Magnus looks like a mountain goat giving Eddie tips and cheering him on when he's trying the orange climb @ 8:37.
2 of my fav utubers together, this is a treat
i cant believe you came to my local gym
Would love to see random strenght test inbetween you.
what a great episode! Eddie's such a down to earth person, I love it.
Fucking yess
Eddie did amazing 🤯
Its crazy how well he moves on the wall given his size. He was doing some proper dynamic moves. Strong as hell.
one step closer to Juji/beast crossover
I am Impressed. I did not think Eddie would do so good. Eddie really is  good athlete. With some training, I am sure he could become a decent amateur climber. Something that should be impossible with his weight. Well done Eddie!
The entire panel flexed out when he topped the green climb!
Dang, so brave doing this fpr the first time on camera
Magnus how do u feel about the climbs not having a grade. Also there is an 8b+ at the climbing works that you should try
Eddie is actually a really good climber considering it was his first time, jeez!!! Intuitive movement and kept his arms straight 👌🏼
Greg doucette gunna be all over this
Dang yo. That's an unexpected but very welcome collab!
Reit enjoyed this!!! Top lads!
I absolutely love this collab! 😍
I love how sweet Eddie was when talking about that train guy.
Best quote:" You are stronger than you think."
The collab I’ve been waiting for!
I'm loving this collab
Very entertaining video! Now Eddie will drag Brian Shaw to wall climbing...
forgot to censor 14:27
Realy cool i am subscribed to eddie and i only lately been watching bouldering content, so this came as a suprise
Have you considered trying to do something with Nile Wilson and his crew? Buncha former gymnasts, could be interesting to see how their gymnastics skills and fitness would translate to climbing.
yoooo this is such a sick collab
What would the black be on a v scale
Eddie is such a wholesome guy, I am glad to see you together. Awesome video 😊
i hoped till the end that Magnus puts on a 100kg vest and tried to climb the routes too so that we could better understand how much grip strength eddie really has 😊
I never thought I'll see two of my favorites Collab together. This was a great video. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this!!
10:48 😂😂
MAD PROPS so glad this could happen!  Two great content creators.
Eddie is a near 400 pound man and he climbed those better then some of the fitness influencers 😂
Eddie Haul CRUSHED IT, what a KING!
Lol he hasn't been the World's Strongest man for 7 years, he's strong but definitely not the strongest anymore. He should stop claiming he is.
You can see the plywood flex as he climbs, especially on the green problem around 6:00.  Crazy power.
Such a niche collab. Eddie seems like a chill dude, super humble and looking to learn. Great vid
It's so funny how he does ALL the things Magnus did when he pretended to be a beginner climber.
Watching a man that size climbing like that was quite a sight. Eddie is one of the few men on earth that size who can do this.
You two should do a TV show together. Would be great fun
No way bro!! Been watching both you gents for years!! Awesome sauce
The way Eddie bends a frying pan reminds me of Bill Kazmaier. Awesome.
Holy Cow!!!  Kudos to you Eddie!  👏👏👏. I never would have dreamt you would have faired that well!
Beautiful intro script 💪
Seeing the wall flex outward when he pulls on those holds is SO sketchy, haha.
You should have busted Eddie's balls for dabbing, he's competitive and will push to do it correctly.
Holy shit Eddie is way taller than I thought he was.
ive been seeing a lot of Eddie Hall recently. He's hilarious, and he seems like a cool dude. Love the vids
checky eddie doing a bottoms up tgu making it much harder
That's a big boi!
His grip strength and overall strength is insane
Really cool to see Eddie get out of his comfort zone... Shows a very different side to him.
Why didn't you take your T-shirt off today, lol?
i was dying at 8:40 when it just cuts to the clip of magnus on the wall pointing out where to hold
Bet his back is small tho😤
Magnus looks a little stressed :p
That was a sick turkish getup. Holding the kettlebell straight up seems like a cool addition (I've only tried it with the bell laying down against the wrist)
What a video. Fair play to Eddie he better than I thought he would be. But does have one of the best climbers teaching him.
Magnus, can you get Benjamin McIntyre on your channel? He's a 17 year old powerlifting prodigy from Denmark, and he's pretty much a genetic wonder: @benjaminmacintyre349. He has a DL world record as well 🙂
I have literally never clicked a thumbnail as fast as I hit this. I put my 3k hours in counterstrike to use for the first time. And its 28 minutes, I cannot wait!!!
YES!!!  Sick colab!!
When in DOUBT REMEMBER THEY PUT A MAN ON THE MOON!
i like his personality, but his shoes are way too oversized for climbing. I would rather climb with bare feet than wearing those...
Haha Turkish Get Up .. never heard of it then does a TGU with really nice form haha. Pull the other one Magnus ;-) PS when my girlfriend was 124lb she coulld do a TGU with a 32kg kettlebell. Always used to impress me lol
This is an awesome collaboration I definitely wasn’t expecting, love both these guys!
If you're the best at one sport, you're going to be really good at other sports.
This is a must see collab and I haven't even watched much
When used to see Eddie next to giants like Brian Shaw, Robert Oberts etc. and now next to a "average sized" person, you realize how massive Eddie still is.
YAYYYYY! Two awesome people. Thanks for another great video!
Looks like a mountain climbing a mountain.
Thats was a good and funny one!!
Lmao that orange is horrible. A friend of mine who climbs often struggled to do it
im so surprised how well he did considering all the other strong men you had before! What a fucking champ dude!
What a phenomenally nice guy!
awesome video!
of course he is not "world's strongest", not even official (olympic) sportsman.
Bro your videos always motivate me to go climbing, and seeing how good eddie already is motivates me even more 😆keep the lovely content up!
This is collaboration that we’ve been waiting foooooor :)
Would be cool if you guys compared grip with the strongman grip tools 😁
9:10 „You’re way better than I thought you’d be“ „*beep*“ „Yeah“
"Literally got more chance of ****ing King Charles in the ass"  How can you not love this guy.
That is a LOT of body weight to move around! 374lbs!
If you guys didn't do a grip challenge I'll be very disappointed!
man, i was rooting for eddie so hard to do those climbes ^^
I can't believe that Magnus just unironically told Eddie, "You're stronger than you thought." without it being condescending, rude, or untrue is mindboggling to me.
Weird to watch the world's strongest man doubt he's strong enough. I like to watch Eddie's adventures. He's always into trying out new stuff.
He's so far off the wall even when he touches it. The center of gravity is so bad for climbing.
I love this, I bet this breaks the stigma for many big men viewing that climbing isn't impossible even if you're heavier than usual.
Magnus literally makes the best videos ever
This is a showcase in how strong someone can be, to be doing some of these climbs with those huge muscles is incredible!
9:15 thats hard, Magnus: 'yeahhhh??'
I love how patient and calm Magnus is with explaining everything to Eddie, an amazing coach to a beginner like Ed.
YESSSS!!! SO GLAD TO SEE EDDIE IN SPECIFIC!! This man deserves so much great collabs and fun and I'm super happy you 2 got together, sat down and prepped out a fun day :D
TGUs are one of my favorite exercises!
So happy to FINALLY see Magnus climbing in my gym!! Amazing video, Eddie seems like such a sound fella.
The dab police were coming for Eddie when he was on the blue at 19 minutes.
This is so good lmao eddies so stiff
He is a cute dangerous giant......
insane
Hot water reheat, a long time is only a cup of cold water.
Great video must be tuff for a beast or huge man 👍🏻💪🏻🧗‍♀️✌🏻🙏🏻🤸
17:00
Brilliant 😃 Eddie is so game to try things - this was so much fun
9:12 whilst looking at an orange Eddie: that's hard Magnus: *pause*...yea...err Great acting from Magnus. All that Bjorn and Frederic training is paying off 😂
The cross over I didn't realise we needed.
1:45 Eddy:'OK I have to grip these Penises' Ah Yeah( really?)
If he climbs 3 x per week he'll neednew shoes after a month hahaha
"So you're stronger than you think"  - Magnus to the world stronges man. Well... yeah...
I love Eddie, this was a great video! So fun haha
I am STUNNED Eddie is as good a climber as he is. So encouraging to watch a crowned world strongest man have doubt, then prove himself wrong repeatedly.
This is the collab I was waiting for!!
Seeing someone like Eddie climbing is a dream I never thought would come true. Thanks Magnus!
CANT BELIEVE THIS COLLAB IS REAL
This is like the best crossover since milk and cereal
Magnus: couldn't get Norway's strongest man on the climbing wall Also Magnus: Gets the WORLD'S strongest man on the climbing wall 😂
Eddie seems like a cool dude
Magnus your and Levan Saginashvili  collaboration would be great!
Let's go!!!
I can't stop staring at Eddie's calves, jesus christ those are a couple blocks of granite lol
Oooh what a... awesome collab!
I came back into climbing August last year weighing 117kg (I was quite sedentary in the years off). That's pretty close to 35kg over my weight at peak fitness, but still well shy of Eddie's 164kg. Granted, in my case the weight was a lot of extra fat and in Eddie's it's a heck ton of muscle, but trying to imagine climbing with an additional 45kg+ over my heaviest... that's beyond me. I know he's strong, but still, impressive.
Omg this is the best video ever
Tom Stoltman > Eddie
Eddie does way better off the rip than I expected actually. Quite impressive, also it’s interesting watching a guy 1/3rd of his size push him
Weiß jemand in welcher show die waren?
Eddie: "Thats gonna be me" *Points at guy falling off a wall*
What an awesome video! Loved the banter and I was impressed with how great he did!
great to see a cross over with Eddie  the man is a mad lad he will give anything a try and will give it everything surprised he didn't try pranking you with something though he def a joker
Eddie is such a nice dude! And it's really cool to see you two collab!
Hey Magnus, what shirt is that?
I see Eddie upvote!
8:34 holy shit dude is a beast
Seeing Eddie climb is like seeing an average dude climb with a backpack filled with 50kg of rocks Holy crackers. To jump down from the top hold must be terrifying because of the impact due to the weight
so cool collab, thougt he would do worse but he is actually pretty strong on the climbing wall, creds to eddie
Eddie remains the man as always
Absolute awesome video, what a great collaboration, definitely both need to do more together 🤙🤙
Really fun to see these collabs, Magnus, keep it up! :D
Eddie is just a funny guy. Respekt! Didn´t expect him to do the sit start!!!
I love the humor ! . . . .you should get together again,
Magnus seemed a bit sleep deprived in this one lol
Did you make sure Eddie Hall was fully hydrated before climbing? A fully hydrated Eddie Hall can cruise up  V17s and free solo 5.15d
That's a lot of dude climbing
god i hate eddie
awesome episode!!! awesome collab!!!
seems like eddie has some serious vertigo issues to conquer too :D  keep at it Eddie
Eddie’s proper good on the wall
I loved watching the holds flex and warp when eddy would grab on lol
what a collab:)
Look up how to do a proper Turkish get-up. Much harder to when done correctly. Just sayin
Magnus is so good at bringing on non-climbers from different disciplines and introducing them to the sport. It's honestly impressive and seems like a good way to grow the sport.
Eddie loves contests, get a weighted fat suite on, no prep!!! challange him to a face to face climb race on a custom route he can manage
Please, bring Hafthor next 😄
"Just remember they put a man on the moon"   Always remember Magnus got Eddie Hall bouldering.
Do not try the turkish getup without learning technique first!! It can be incredibly dangerous. Never do it the way they are doing it unless you want to smash your skull/teeth against a canon ball!
Haven't even finished watching yet, but I'm having so much fun watching Eddie doubt, swear, try anyway, and succeed.  Life lessons from elite athletes of all shapes and sizes.  Good one, Magnus!
I love Eddie's sense of humour. Just in the background while Magnus is climbing the black, "Ohh I'm sweatin me dick off" 🤣🤣
Never clicked on a video so fast
This man is nearly bigger than the wall. He makes the entire boulder look weak.
Are they the same height??
magnus keep up the good content. OK USA
You should’ve done the grip tests with weight like you did the last video. Would’ve been cool to see
I love how you want people to succeed, giving your very best advice. Also, Eddie Hall is awesome. Great episode 😀
maybe eddie hall can teach you in powerlifting ? :D
This was hilarious to watch! 🤣 I loved Magnus looked so scared and worded every sentences so carefully
They did in fact put a man on the moon, so I’m not surprised this collab happened
More climbs on Eddie Hall’s frame than Font
Starting to think Magnus just wants to touch as many hands as possible
most unexpected Collab 2023
Magnus Spiderman 2024! Come onnn, he's like an older (more attractive) Tom Holland.
Eddie in a Magnus video? that wasn't on my bingo card...
please get BABA KAHN next!!  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Eddie's just an amazing all around athlete
Another absolutely TOP CLASS video!! and'm back again for another comment lol. Met Eddie a few times and he's a funny guy! would be great to see you Eddie and Brian Shaw climbing together ... outdoors haha. I sent you a message on insta btw but you haven't seen it. Then again I'm sure you get hundreds. It is under the same name All Torque . I'm 6'3 and 24 stone and haven't been on a climbing wall in probably 15 years so good to get a gauge of what bigger guys can do haha ... though Eddie is considerably stronger than me as you might expect haha.
Wow! That blue route second move from Eddie was beautiful. Some better foot placement and that would've been flashed. I can't believe it!
Mühlenkölsch on that throwback pic?? Come back to cologne someday Magnus! :)
"You're stronger than you think", ngl had to catch myself a bit after that one 😂
Big fan of both of you gentlemen, this was a great collab! It was really interesting to see how Eddie climbs with his size compared to how you climb, Magnus. You’re a dang spider monkey!
That’s amazing how strong he is
Am i the only one who is so astonished by Eddie's calves
Magnus and Eddie! Awesome Combo! Two of the strongest guys on youtube!
eddie is impressively good at climbing for his size and his experience, maybe after bodybuilding he could move his focus towards climbing
OMG can't believe I saw Eddie Hall on this channel. I've always been a huge fan of both of you two. So glad you collab with him.
Magnus telling Eddie "you're stronger than you think" 🤣🤣😆
two amazing guys and ive never clicked faster
6:25 "You are stronger than you think" LMAO, sick burn Magnus xD
Eddie always has a smile on his face, lol. great film Magnus! Lets take our hats off to Eddie, the worlds biggest climber, amazing!
I have been wondering for the last year if you guys would collab....I'm just going to watch the video
Eddies calves are the size of my head. Jesus.
Hahah this is such an unexpected crossover and I am SO here for it! Been following both of you guys for years!
Ahaha ! Magnus looks hilariously small compared to this *beast*  I really like his humor though. Very nice guy
Wow, I didn't expect to see a clip with Eddie!
The Uno Reverse with "The man on the moon" was so good😂
Just wanted to say! No matter how strong you are in campusing, your legs will ALWAYS be stronger than your arms! Good footwork and leg explosiveness is fundamental to climb better and harder, not to say that lack of muscles in the legs is the main cause of knee injuries! Please, do not push people into trying to get lighter than necessary and to avoid leg training! 🥰
crossover
The leg weight discussion inspired me to suggest you to make a collab with Zion Clark. He's a dude with no lower body but is massively strong. He did some wrestling and MMA so far. I really wonder how he would do in rock climbing.
Great stuff Magnus. I love Eddy Hall!
jaw dropped when I saw Eddie Hall doing a dyno move :O amazing collab!
The collab we all needed 😄
holy molly that was a moment i was waiting so much, amazing video magnus <3
always fun to see Eddie suffer ;)
you HAVE to get Brian Shaw now and then hopefully Hafthor Bjornsson :D
What an unexpected crossover!!!
eddie is actually so good at this omg 🥹
I like this content. Please make more for both of you guys.
Magnus keep it up!!!💪💪💪 I am restoring from injury of finger and still inspiring for climbing(doctor said that i can climb in future) via your videos!!!!
Hi algorithm please promote Magnus content byeee.
wow. men... for a guy his size he did awesome. Well done.
That's awesome!
wow
Hey Magnus!
the colab i never knew i needed. keep it up!!!
really sick collab
-you are stronger than you think 😅
This is the type of content I've been waiting for in a long time. My man Eddie Hall going climbing with no other than Magnus. Legendary!!
I'm surprised Eddie didn't bring his "tank."
really sweet episode! Thanks a lot for meeting :)
Wow Eddie did amazing
Omg this video will break internet
Wanna see you guys play football
I AM shocked by how good he is for his size and muscle mass. This is incredible and an amazing video
jesus christ is like climbing with a 100 kilo bag isnt it?
9:11  Eddie : BIIIIIP  Magnus : Yeah  😅
Imagine how strong Eddie is to be able to do the beginning of that blue, we've seen heavy guys here with 70kg's less than him, that could never do that.
The company that manufactures the screws for those grips will use this video as their advertisment.
oh man im so excited. i need these guys to do strength challenges
This is so exiting
Seriously awesome.   Eddie 💪
Ah yes, someone with the optimal body for climbing.     And also Magnus.
Thanks for showing how a heavy person can climb. It helps motivate me to keep going!
Hi Magnus and maybe Eddie, so excited to see you climbing at the climbing hanger, I was just there today. Still can't believe two people who have inspired me so much have been climbing at my gym! magnus thank you so much for your amazing collaboration and for being such an idol to so many of us. Btw no way you really told Eddie that he's stronger than he thinks: 6:30.  Edit: thank you so much magnus for liking this, did not think you would see this! Second edit: Noooo i just realised changing the message takes away the like of Magnus! at least I know he liked it I guess...
Really interesting watching Eddie climb - he seems to instinctually keep his arms pretty straight, which is maybe not surprising. Given that he was a high-level swimmer before becoming a strongman, he has a very well-rounded athletic background and good body-sense.
I wanna see him do all of those grip strength excercises
Omfg
Dude…. Stop. 😂
oh my god the second he put his foot on the wall and his calf bulged out
I feel as heavy as Eddie when I boulder steep stuff
Magnus!!! I dont know if your subs are ready for Eddies Language 😂
Eddie was excellent at following instructions. Honestly, he did much better than I thought he would.
Can you get the Grizzly onto the show next?
I've been hoping for this collab for a while. Now I hope for Martyn Ford
Doing that at his weight and flexibility is commendable.  Magnus is a great teacher.
how come half of the swearing is muted and half isnt :D
My guess 1st couple of seconds into video eddie has no hope. i will be back in 28 minutes .
This is HUGE Magnus! (and so is Eddie💥
Ohh wow I did not expect this.
It feels illegal to be this early
Eddie did so much better than i was expecting!!
Eddie was awesome! Great stuff :D
Hah!  Been watching both of your guys’ content for years!  This is a great collab, Magnus!
I wanted this colab for a while but was never expecting it, now that we have it well, it doesnt disappoint.
no way magnus actually got Eddie hall to climb?!! you're a legend magnus
I know how long I've waited for this collab! Two absolute legends.
Its crazy how his shoes are not downturned but more like... upturned.
0:47 just a couple guys sharing a glass of milk?
Forsett med det brae arbeide Magnus!😄
bro those calves
One step closer to doing grip strength with Brian Shaw
Letting go is still the scariest thing about climbing for me.
Yeeeeeeeesssss!!!
Great video thanks
now time for you to train powerlifting with him!
There is no way both of my favorite creators and idols have a video together. Wow
awesome :D
Holy shit i never thought i would see Eddie Hall here
"I don't have custom shoes"  yeah sure but you also aren't walking around on 2 full sized hams xD
Let’s go
I see an upload from Magnus and now am happy
Best  channel on youtube. Love the content Magnus!
CONTENT CONTENT
Holy shit, didn't see this collab coming! Hell yeah
Eddie Hall is such a joy!
great stufd
I could see this being a series! The Stoltmans and Big Loz come to mind, would love to see them on the wall!
5:04
if your going for strongmen have a look at the Stoltman Brothers, Tom Stoltman 2x worlds strangest man and Luke stoltman Europe's strangest man.
Hey Magnus. I have been dealing with some stuff lately. But your videos always motivate me to go out and try to have a normal day. Thank you
Amazing feature 😮
If Magnus got tattoos and a mohawk haircut, he could be twice as strong! Eddie is a great guy. Bit crazy, haha, but you guys make a good collaboration.
W
He calls himself a beast and he's not exaggerating. His 500kg deadlift is something out of the chart, maybe out of this world 💪🏆💪
Still smaller than Juji
Jesus, his calves are like tree trunks!
Love that he knocks on his head as he says "tap wood"
This is the last collab I expected but I’m here for it
This is an awesome collaboration I definitely wasn’t expecting, love both these guys!
1:44 - There's something about the shape of those holds...
Magus just told Eddie Hall "Your stronger than you think" lol
Was waiting for this and I’m not disappointed
Strong, but also a heavy weight. Caused by muscles but that is not your friend when you need to do a pullup or hold with your arms.
This is the video I’ve been waiting for. Love your work Magnus
Never in my life did I think I'd see Eddie Hall bouldering.
A lot of uk athletes have being trying there spot at climbing and it’s amazing to see Toby segar is doing a lot for the uk climbing scene from parkour and it’s great to see
Great colab.
love it
Wait, I proposed this in a previous video, and it happened. Awesome!
This is my ideal collab thanks magnus
Lieben Wir!
Thats a collab I was waiting for
I can't beleave this crossover but im delighted its happened. I watch both your videos but never would have guessed id see you guys collab! The running joke and callback at 24:12 was hilarious.
Awesome seeing you with people from other disciplines like this Magnus. He did great! It was cool to see such a strong man get pumped. Keep up the great climbing vids! 🙌
Immaculate timing Magnus ❤️
I was waiting for this video for a long time, so glad you made it! thk you magnus and eddie and everybody involved.
Thats Crazy
Keep these collabs coming
already stoked and only seen 2 min of the video :D
Yes!!! I always to see him on your channel, I'm so happy it finally happened!!!
I can't believe you got Eddie on! You are the GOAT of rock climbing Magnus. Two of the best together 🔥  Eddie was too dehydrated for that last one 😞
if eddie was hydrated he could’ve  on-sighted silence
You are betraying the guy from the previous video that you called the strongest man.
Love the glass of milk at the pub.
what a colab
damn
This is the collab I’ve been waiting for my whole life
FINALLY.. this had to happen and I'm glad it did.
What!?!? Don't watch a lot of YouTube, but love both of these guys! Can't wait to watch! So cool!!!!
Was not expecting this colab but I love it.
Hello!!
You should make more videos with just you in your gym
The guy who got me into powerlifting and the guy who got me into climbing and my two favourite things no way 😭
Great team up!!
Love your vids helps to inspire me to climb hard
hello
nice
Eddie is great
First pog
Eddieeeee
omg Edward
Nice
wow 1 view, i miss bouldering
I’ve been waiting for the video for so long I can’t wait!
Was waiting for this and wasn't disappointed
Been waithing for this
Hihihiha
Not first
First
First!
First lol
Eddie getting pump after hanging for 25 seconds instead of 1m50s like he said he can. Losing grip and struggling at times. Shows how hard a bouldering session really is.
