🚨 POST MATCH HERE: https://youtu.be/yanPRkt0XMY
Honestly lots of non league clubs need to make highlights like this. What a fantastic media from this club
First goal did look as though the ball went out of play before it was sent into the box.
John ruddy you mean?
Jack ruddy class at saving but distribution wasn’t to good
Those centre backs are dreadful 😢
wasnt a red, that was a bad decision, yellow at most, striker ran across and there was no intent from cb to put st on the floor. cb was just running and st ran across. tbf st was thru on goal but it was a 50/50 and no one had control of the ball. now if st did have control of the ball it would be a different story
Where’s Jermaine Francis?
Get that ruddy signed up right now what a keeper but on another note halford looked like he didn’t even wanna be there what so ever but Cornish looked really promising but some defo gotta change at the back UPTHETAGS
sak is a BALLER
How many steps away from league 2
Hash Tag United Keeper needs more training... he's like a 14 year old child learning. don't get me wrong to get the ball to him, you got to  get past 10 other players but the goals against HTU are weak at best.
Hashtag’s first goal was out of play was it not? Before the cut back?
I feel there are some clumsy defending errors that keep happening since the preseason. And for preseason that's ok. But you can't allow it to come over to the games that matter. But to be fair. They got 2 chances and they scored twice so they were also very clinical.
That keeper. What a performance. Reminds me a bit of Tim Howard's performance for USA against Belgium in the brazilian WC. Ridiculous.
Hashtag needs a new goalkeeper cuz what was that brudda doing
Their keeper was nothing short of incredible. We are back!!! Games coming thick and fast. Let’s have it!.
Pk Humbility
Well earned point lads considering Dulwich had the best 2 performers on the pitch. Gotta be more aware with the ball in the air. Apart from that I think the Tags played well. Excited for another season.
Hashtag need a new gk
Never seen a football team where the dangerous free kicks are taken by both centre halves
Their keeper was amazing. Hashtag keeper looks like he never practiced. Club deserves better performances
Dulwich Hamlet are my local team literally 10 minutes away. Love to see the Tags competing with them now. WHAT A JOURNEY
Heads up Tags despite a draw be proud of that Performance against an ex NLS side their Keeper kept them in it Up The Tags
UP THE TAGS
Ruddy was at my hometown love, Plymouth Argyle 5 years ago when we were in League Two, mad to see how far the boys have come since then in only 5 short years after 13 years away from the championship and now fourth in it just a league away from the holy land, puts in to perspective just how magical the last 5 years since the mighty Simon Hallett took ownership of the club has really been
18:03 loool pause
Could of had 5 in the second if it wasn’t for there keeper..play like this every game your have a good year up the tags
The real Jack Ruddy? Poor ball knowledge Spence, think you’re getting confused with John Ruddy
Where’s higgsy?
I love the insight of what Devs says on the touch line
This is why I love watching hashtag a real mix of emotions😂⚽️
Happy with a point but if they had a standard keeper for this level we could have won by 3+ goals easy.
When will Hashtag reach League 2?
we should of won, lucky to get the point
Hashtag UTD, sign that Keeper Up
I saw the score line on my phone this past Sunday and couldn't wait for this vid to see how it went down.
How have we not won this game! Great goalkeeping from Ruddy! We need to be more clinical! #upthetags
AT should’ve been on at half time
Same kit
Manny parry taking his old feeney tactics from welling last season to dulwich
Defence is poor, two chances from poor defending and two conceded. Slow and turn like bricks
Even fifa couldn’t script a game this much
I really like the addition of the commentary of the gaffer mid-game. Gives us another insight of the game. Keep them coming Hashtag. 👌
new season come on! up the tags 🔥
Their keeper was sensational. This season or next holding talks would be productive. Striker was electric also.
Enfield town will bring the smoke
this is a tough league my god
Luke for Dulwich played for Crystal Palace
that keeper was nothing but exceptional
Tobi has to start. He’s to good to be on the Bench
Where is jermaine francis and pedro cavalho
That a great result a promoted team drawing with a top team is amazing great start.
I could listen to devs talk all day
Obviously there keeper saved them from it being a 4-2 win or perhaps more. This team wasn’t much chop in all honesty but perhaps Hashtag are just that much better. Making me confident for the season ahead. #UPTHETAGS
Tyrique from love island at 19:54
We're missing a massive opportunity to call the Cornish+Cornhill duo "CORNHUB"
Great point tbh they had amazing goalkeeper and harry was unfortunate so all things considered against a brilliant team like that a point is really good and looks good for rest of the season
1st goal ball was completely out.... Embarrassing
What a performance by Jack Ruddy. Fantastic.  14:40 15:10 15:30 15:50 16:25
Not gonna lie after that red card, I was almost sure that Tags would get the win but jeez it was too close even for the draw
to be honest everyone saying Ruddy stopped Hashtag from winning and dont get me wrong he saved pretty much everything that came his way but the 2 goals we conceded were faults of our own the 1st goal 3 players stood off him which gave him time to shoot and score and then the 2nd goal Haysom misjudged the flight of the ball or the sun got in his eyes and from that they scored their 2nd so to be honest we should have won the clearly but at the end of the day a point is a point and against a team like Dulwich is a very very good point so well done boys we go again Tuesday which is tonight so i look forward to the video Cmon You HASHTAG
Their keeper looked like a seasoned pro, while hashtag's keeper looked worse than a last minute sunday league replacement
is there anywhere that i can watch the game    Up the tags
1:00 Oh wow loool
Up the tags!! I love this videos and love that i can know the score through Flashscore now. Goodluck❤
"Matty Wooldrige..with enough space to build a small primary school". Spens commentary never disappoints!
Their keeper was sensational. This season or next holding talks would be productive. Striker was electric also.
philp so useless
No offense to James Philp but we clearly need a new goalkeeper, obviously I'm not basing myself just on this match but even last season he showed lots of times to be a below average keeper for that level! I think this year it will just become more apparent, his distribution is decent but his positioning and reflexes are really lacking. Not every keeper in this league is gonna be as good as Ruddy but there sure will be a big contrast.
The difference an elite goalkeeper can make if you switched goalies hashtag win 3-0 atleast
######
Love the little developments to the video this year hearing Devs etc
Wanadio played for us (Dover) last season, absolute baller, 10 goals in the National League South and 10.56 expected assists throughout. Expected him to get a move to the National League, not the Isthmian
you sure its not just neuer in disguise?  😱
I hate to say negative stuff, but I just can't believe they've stuck with Philip is goal. I've never seen him have a good game and both goals today you have to question him, really hope we bring in someone to challenge him.
Is their a live for members for the concord game
I’m a hashtag utd supporter. Ruddy was great. But to be fair we made him look good.
Ruddy was phenominal but it showed great spirit from the Tags to come back twice.   That tense music in the build up/team talk really didnt seem to fit the mood at all btw! But great video regardless.
The tags need a new keeper for sure
Swear the pro goalie is John Ruddy not Jack. What a keeper
Love the bench mic
I remember Jack Ruddy from his spell at wolves. Good keeper
Let's gooo! Ready for another season! Supporting from Portugal!
Wyan reid has been a very good addition. Always making runs,incolved in the game.
Can we buy their keeper
Talk about getting stuffy. That's never a red card because the attacker never had possession of the ball (can't be a goal-scoring opportunity if he doesn't have the ball) and the ball went out of play
Where is Jermaine?😊
More of Devs audio from the bench please! #upthetags
Very good opposition! Gj lads :)
John ruddys son was in goal if I’m not mistaken
Anderson should be playing over halford
I dont like to slate people but you got one keeper pulling off save after save - then one keeper has 2 shots concedes both and the views dont look great on his keeping.  I good point against a strong side.
What a goalie
Can you sign some lad from poland i would appreciate that and btw love your videos you have potential to go to premier league in the future
I can help you with this season I am a good football
Toby has to start he changes games constantly with goal involvements. Would be interesting to see his stats for goal involvements when starting and when coming on. Up the tags!
I've litteraly played against this team in fm23, and sold a player to them, happy to see Hashtag face against teams I know
Love the new Devs voice feature, can we have a Devs cam now?????
there keeper looks better than our keeper 💀
Let’s go
Up the TAGS Cammmmmmm on ❤🎉
Clutch late equalizer UP DA TAGS
What an opener!! loved the devs audio and the attendance at the end!
days like saturday, playing a team of dulwich hamlet's status and long history as equals, are for reflecting on the amount of work that's been put into this club by spen, seb, alex, neil, and so many more whose names don't get mentioned enough. from the one men's side that started the eastern counties league to now is an awesome achievement. so excited to see the men and women make waves and continue their incredible ascent #UTT
UP THE BLOODY TAGS FROM THE US OF A. Cheeky little premier league keeper loan for the opposition. He had hands like a young Jamie Jackson before the mohawk.
Philp questionable on both goals😬😬
Actually a good performance to start the season! Carrying over the performances from preseason in such a tough match is a good sign! Hopefully 3 pts against concord even though it will be difficult .
Philp looks stiff as a log
Got to hand it to the keeper he was inspired but positive result from the lads. Opening games can be nervy but the lads showed why they should be in the higher divisions. Onwards and Upwards #️⃣#️⃣
Gonna struggle without Francis and Carvalho
I thought u guys where using adidas kits not Hummel?
where is pedro?
Pretty sure Ben Foster said in spencers interview on his podcast that he would sign in two years for Hashtag... since then he has retired, and then came back and signed for Wrexham... you shook hands with Spen Dog Fozzy... time to honour the handshake!!!! #UpTheTags
Really impressed by Cornish debut. Love the addition of Dev's Mic'd up. Also was good to hear more of Keithy in the team talks. Great work everyone!
Superb resilience from the Tags - love the addition of soundbites from Devs during the match. Even more immersive than ever!
Jermaine Francis leave?
UP THE TAGS
PK look a lot fitter and leaner. Gonna have a great season! #
That keeper earned that point for them. Absolutely unbelievable some of the saves he made, and a couple defensive breakdowns that Dulwich Hamlet took advantage of. Gonna have to be more focused at this level, mistakes are gonna be punished more severely. The Devs commentary mid game was a nice touch though.
Would there be untagged this season
FotMob spoiled the result for me (amazing that we've come so far that our scores are on there now) but still a great video guys!
UP THE TAGS, TAGS FOREVER
That keeper was definitely on his a game there
Don’t get me wrong the keeper was very good but Jesus Christ our shooting was abysmal. So many shots right at the keeper.
Love the idea of having a mic on Devs! The content just keeps getting better and better. Up the TAGS!!!
Their keeper turned into that legendary De Gea vs Arsenal performance.
Need to learn from this one, but much better second half
Had you lot on my Acca to draw(sorry haha) and thought you let me down, clutched up and won me 1500 quid
#’s Keeper shouldve done better for the 2 goals I’ve seen so far (no hate)
Next GK signing 👀
Slow start admittedly but unleashed some real venom by the final whistle, really impressive performance when questions were being asked of the mythical Ruddy. what an spectacle for the tags’ opening fixture!
This attack looked very good.  I remain cautiously optimistic this season.  ###
You ever just hear the FIFA playa on coms? "He has to be on performance enhancers" genuinely made me laugh 😂
Anyone seen sky sports have got them down as spencer FC still 🤣
Tags need a new gk his poor cost them the win he should of saved both them shots he will cost them a lot of points this season
I know Jermaine moved on and I am happy for him and the opportunities he is going to have… but could you guys imagine a Jermaine and Sak partnership 😮 Would’ve been lethal!
Hashtag playing dulwich in a league game is just absolutely mental
Ngl first goal was out
Big up their keeps. So unlucky not to get 3 points but great start for the tags 🎉
Should have a Google of the keeper 👀
When is the new kit coming in?
Glad to see the boys back and ballin🔥
Up the tags ❤
Where’s Pedro gone?
The quality of their GK to ours was the difference today. Can we sign someone to compete with Phil please. No disrespect but it’s football we need to be competitive
Sak hassan is a quality player, he needs to take more shots on goal after cutting in on his right.
hashtag vs inter miami 😆🤣🤣
james philp was very poor today
Im sorry lads but im surprised Philp is still there. Showed to be way too inconsistent last season. Hope'd we'd have upgraded
I’m sorry but the contrast in the keepers are insane!!!🤯 Everyone’s praising Ruddy but can we talk about how Philp is so unorthodox and looks like he doesn’t belong in net🤷‍♂️
This disrespect of not starting A.T or Toby after what they done last season. Completely changed the game when they came on especially A.T
Ruddy kept them in the game by a mile! 5-2 without him
New edits etc were top notch, great new features to the match highlights 👌
Pk looks so sharp since, going to be some season from him
Need a new keeper in, or at least competition. Philip can't get down and dive quick enough
loved the new mic on Devs and Joe!
With ball in possession the game looked extremely promissing, especially in the first 20 minutes. We could actually be a contender for playoffs, if the offense gets more used to each other
Ruddy has had a class game. Another day hashtag win comfortably
Cracking performance from Ruddy.   Also, good that we got to hear the Fifa Playa on commentary duties, hopefully he makes a few more appearances this year,
thanks for the video team good work!!! HOPE we can get to 800k this year
Big season, up the tags
A point against potentially the highest calibre team in the league is a good point. Lots to learn from it and good to see the quality from the new signings.
Thought there was a new kit
why are hashtag wearing last seasons kit?  love the addition of dev`s audio on the bench up the tags
Both goals pretty lucky but they were lucky not to concede 7
pk and cornish looking on it think tomo anderson has got to start for halford
Honestly our keeper is such a poor shoot stopper he always gets scored on when the ball is not going directly at him.But the lads were rly dominant and deserved a win bt oh well we move on😁
Don’t know if he’s been carrying a knock and maybe that’s the reason why he hasn’t played much but Toby Aromolaran has to be starting every game in my opinion
This goalkeeper cmon Phillip swear every shot goes past u
The disrespect from SkySports to have you listed as "Spencer FC" on their results page.  Any chance of sending Jacko round to the Sky HQ?
Poor defense, Zack He Created many chances WoW
Great game, All over them in majority of the match however to finishing is what was lacking wether that was due to confidence or nerves from a new league and even a fantastic goalkeeper performance. It will start working couple games in. Up the Tags!
That goal was so bad man it was clearly out haha. Feel bad for the GK getting booked because he deserved the clean sheet and he knew it
Good luck this season to the Tags, from us guys in Northern Ireland 👏
New season, same ambition😜🤘... Not a bad result to start the season, UP THE TAGS! ❤
come on tags
Sak Hassan. What a player 🇸🇴
DRUG TEST THAT GOALKEEPER. NOW.
Up the tags ###
Still proud of the hamlets they are my hometown club
Every season our defense starts poorly, good game though!
Buzzing these videos are back! Massive West Ham fan but this is my guilty pleasure! Struggle not to check the results before the videos out but it’s always worth it. Need to get to my first game this season
Nicest way possible James Philp is dogshit He’s a liability At this level you need far better Was protected too much last season, will be exposed this year
dulwich hamlet is one the big name at this level, good result and #tag could hav won this match without prime Buffon in goal for Hamlet
Fantastic entertainment, great coverage, commentary and camera work. Thank you for this video….I’m hooked!
Love the in-match commentary from Devs! A great addition
Zuhdu did a whole lot of nothing. Reid is much better as a defender than a winger. Team was so much better when AT and Toby were up top, keep it that way
James Philp took a day off. Couldn’t save a pdf file
Nah that run of 5 consecutive saves around the 65th minute was superb
absolutely take the point from this game, taking points from a newly relegated team shows how strong the tags are going to be this season.
Loving the Dev's voice recordings haha. So much passion!
Get rudy on the tags he’s one hell of a beast
What a ruddy good keeper he is! (Is my family the only one that uses that word in place of expletives?) Also, since when has Devs been mic'ed up in the dugout?
Lots of chances for the boy. Happy with the performance. Future is looking bright
The background music at the start was so tense
Sign that keeper up
Man don't know if the Highlights do them dirty, but they have barely a sniff and somehow came out with a draw with 10 men. We really needed to show them what for in this match, still feel proud of the boys though, not easy to come back from a goal down twice. Hassan and Zuhdu looking good. Up the Tags! #💛💙
The GK makes 2 good saves, the rest arent as hyped up as you guys think 😂
Ruddy’s got Conor McGregor piss. It would melt the testing cup. I want that man PED checked.
Minimum the tags deserve there. If not for the best goalkeeping display the tags have ever faced, that game was done and dusted
I’m sorry but I’m just not a big of philp, I feel like the last goal he should’ve saved, especially at the level they playing at. Maybe it was the angle we saw but I just feel like questions should be asked of the goalie.
Hearing devs on the sideline and seeing attendance at the end is a big improvement from last year
I'm so happy for a team I've supported for years to get themselves into a position where I have the opportunity to see them battle it out with a local team I've supported for years. What an incredible game and I'll look forward to attending the reverse fixture later in the season!
Been watching since the adams brown partnership always keep and eye on the tags
Talk about saving the match! Well done,Toby!
Great game and a lot of positives but it is worrying that Hashtag were a man up almost the entire game yet were always behind and barley got a draw.
Class today boys amazing performance against a solid team and someone in the football league needs to take a look at Jack Ruddy😅
Damn Dulwich Hamlet is a team I actually know off, sure I know them from FM.. But I know them, and seeing Hashtag play in the same league as them really makes me realise how far up you all have gone is such a short period of time.. Keep going up lads, you're doing great
Liked all the commentary from Devs thrown in 🔥
🚨 POST MATCH HERE: https://youtu.be/yanPRkt0XMY
Decent result, all in all. On another day, we'd have got the W, but never looked liked losing.  Wyan and Matty on the flank worked really well and they both had plenty of chances to get forward. Sam probably stood out for me though. He was everywhere and really gave DH problems (way more than you see in the highlights). Was great to see Toby score. I'm hoping he can get a few more than last season.
I think the ball was out on the OG but we’ll take it!
Anyone else feel maybe hashtag might need a new keeper
Might take a couple seasons to reach 2nd National League but we will get there. Toby scoring always make me happy. Club legend at this point. Good luck in this new season. Up the tags.
I've been thinking about it, we need a better keeper for sure! I don't trust the goalkeeper that we have had for the last season ever since we stopped using Pagey! He doesn't really save much and he's always making mistakes that lead to goals! I know we can't get Ruddy since Dulwich is so much more well-known and financed but I don't believe that we can't find a better keeper than James Philp! Besides that, what an amazing game to start the season! So much energy, so much tension, and most importantly, so many goals! Can't wait to see the result of this team's performance! If this is a taste of what's coming I think we're in for an amazing season! Who knows, we might even make it to the national league south? Everything is possible :)
we need this keeper in EAFC 24 free agents now
Ty from love island supporting the boys 👏
Will we see the return of hashtag podcast??
Hashtag United vs Wanadio and Ruddy
Ruddy is much better than this level, came from the Rangers academy, went to Wolves and had stints with Bury and Ross County, what a keeper!
Very good result
Coyt 💙💛
that goalkeeping performance was unreal
Loved the addition of Dev’s audio on the bench! Solid point to start the campaign and we move onwards and upwards!!!!
Not sure about our keeper for their second! Weird dive that!
Love the little clips from the gaffer, theyre great. Their GK absoloutley unreal by the way
Why are you guys still using hummel? I thought you lot sign a deal with adidas. I'm confused rn
No hate but we need a goalkeeper like Ruddy. If we don’t sign a new goalkeeper i see us letting in the most goals this season out off all the teams in the league.
Keeper was incredible
excited for the season the boys looked like they deseerve to be at this level ! up the tags
What a result lads, little unlucky to not get the win but showed so much dominance, excited for the season UP THE TAGS!!!!!
people say step 4 to step 3 is the biggest jump... looks true
Lets go boys!!! UP THE TAGS
Greetings from Russia. I played for your team in football manager 2023 =)
that goalkeeper is ridicilous judging by only this game this bloke is at least league two standard
SUPPORTING HASHTAG UNITED ALL THE WAY FROM PAKISTAN
Philp should’ve saved the second one, the centre backs didn’t help , but we know how good the centre backs are normally, give it 2 more games and if they are still losing like this then we talk about new centre backs and gk
Looking forward to a new season😊
Haven’t watched for a long time and don’t know any of the players anymore.. could rhyme the whole squad off a few years ago 😂 A young dan brown would fire this team into the premier league btw.. good luck for the season lads, all the best.
Why are you guys still wearing Hummel if your had your contract cancelled
And also where pedro
Really shocked to see the Singapore flag in the video. Up the tags from 7000miles away ❤
Philps had a howler today need more competition at gk
Good job Tobi!
Where Jamain Francis HAVENT watched in a while
Phillip is not good enough I have been saying this since he sighted and it show that we still need more players in the door
Ruddy is muad
Great result that can see them being up there end of the season and important not too get beat first game of the season. Upthetags
Kappa gear gap filling?
Thought we played quite well but I didn’t see enough from our starting forwards, I said the same about AT and pedro, but they just didn’t do enough. I hope they prove me wrong! Up the tags
sign jack ruddy ASAP HE IS HIM
Jack Ruddy isn't human
This game is actually mental
So good to be back! If this start to the season is anything to go by, we better buckle up!   Up the tags
Up the TAGS lads!! Great start to the season ,unlucky not to take the 3 points tho
Why still wearing the Hummel kit
cautious on the trigger at the beginning, but showing great aggressiveness in the second half! Up the tags!
this was the club i used in football manager this year, insane im now watching hashtag play them
It seemed as though they had prime John Ruddy in goal 😂
That first goal definitely went out 😂😂
What. An. Opener.  COME ON YOU TAGS!! 💙💛💙💛
There keeper incredible, phelps had a stinker
Can we get Ruddy in a Hashtag Shirt Plz
