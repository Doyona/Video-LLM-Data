cringst champ in the game
Damn I only started playing valorent and was having a choice of choosing an agent and I picked him and it good
who here just found that his shield used to be 2
ok
Greenholt Union
Martine Ways
kill contract is just guns battle, where iso get free shield, enemy can't use abilities
This is a clown game where aim is not rewarded this character has a shield that protects him from dying and a ultimate that wins the duel most of the times
Iso: Domain expansion KILL CONTRACT
i would like to see what the enemy's perpective in every ability
Dying in your own ult is gonna be wild 💀
Make his ult draging 2 people and he will get more pick  Draging 2 people but let another one waiting for untill they finished 1v1
"Raze! he's 1 tap. Just rush him!"  Iso : *Domain Expansion : Kill Contract*
i played like maybe 3 hours worth of valorant back before it fully came out yknow when everyone was freaking out  calling it spyware? and ive never been interested in it since then and im also not one for playing "duelist" type characters i always tank in games BUT this dude looks so cool that im tempted to try the game and him out
"His ult is a domain expansion"🤓 WRONG, IT'S MORDEKAISER ULT.
Domain expansion
Bro is using Doman Expansion in valorant
Domain expansion.  1 v 1
The ult looks like a 1v1 to the death tbh
bro has a domain expansion
DOMAIN EXPASION: RUN THEM 1S
Balanced
A controller style duelist holy cow
Iso ults:  You are going to Beijing
HIs ult is garbage. Compare with deadlock, where it has more chances to kill enemy,
I suggest next agent Ghost, Ultimate should be Invincibility for 10 seconds
Iso activating his ult be like - Ryouiki Tenkai: Keiyaku o korosu ( kill contract in Japanese lang)
How would this work with multiple enemies? Who would it prioritize?
they really made the gulag an ultimate
Not me gonna lose every 1v1 lol
Yeah man just cosplay Mordekaiser.
what happened if enemy won at ISO ult?
Domain expansion ass ult
WHY DOESNT ANYONE MENTION THAT HIS FLOW STATE LETS HIM RELOAD FASTER???  THATS SO GOOD
domain expansion : counter strike
atleast show isos ultimate in enemys pov
There should be an unwritten rule to use melee only in his ult.
Yin in valorant 😂
“With disability”
tbh its a shit
thank you for explain😍
Yoru cna dodge the ultimate HAHAHHA! Clone then 🔪 at the back
so what happens when the enemy is defusing bomb and u just throw your ulti at last second of the bomb going off. so the enemy stops defusing and fighting u. and u just hide behind the wall and KA BOOOOM ???
They just added Domain expansion to valorant
that ulti is a little insane
To be honest, Valorant keeps getting better and better
brother sends people to the Gulag
Mordeksaier joined the game
Actually, I might actually like this agent. Most of his abilities is more of an initiator but thats good since I main initiator mostly. As a duelist though, iso has 0 movement to take space which makes him almost mid or trash in that role. I actually might play him tbh (as an aggro initiator not a duelist).
Iso's Ultimate is Valorant's equivalent of sending you to Brazil.
Op
Him having 2 uses of his E is about to break the game lmao. All the godlike players are basically gonna be unkillable upon entry and can clear out an entire team. It's like Reyna ult or heal but even better which makes it worse for everyone.
Ryoiki Tenkai
ah yes i want to get sent to brazil. i love it
yo what happens if Iso goes 1v1 in ult with someone and the ISO wins and spawn again on the same spot. What if enemy is waiting for him at his spawn point, like at phoenix's ult?
ryoiki tenkai
The ult is useless for a silver player, like me.
I guess Iso studied from jujutsu high
So Iso literally calls iso and goes one on one with his ult sick
Thumbs down! There's much better explanation on ign with clear speaking and explanation. Instead of incoherent mumbling in this vid
Ryōiki Tenkai 🤞
So harbour is dead?
Will be nerfed at the very first patch, that shield and barrier is plain op
He is so broken😂😂😂😂
Domain Expansion? 💀
domain expansion
What if you both die at the same time in the ultimate after 50 seconds?
Why tf did they name his ult the like why not Isolation
Bruh this is broken af
Dude Literally has domain expansion ☠️☠️☠️
What do people see when iso is in his ult?
ok but for the ult does this person have to be near you?
this man is BROKEN, that wall is INSANE if it goes through enemies you can push with it and basically kill any attackers behind it cause they'll be blind for a second before they see you on the other side, if the ULT affects the timer as well its going to be interesting
They added domain expansion as his ult
his ult is sooo good
Domain Expansion 🤞🏻 Shattered Barrier Garden
DOMAIN EXPANSION
meanwhile the ult: DOMAIN EXPA-
If you play mobile legends you will know his ult is just a copy of YIN 😂😂😂
RYOIKI TENKAI
mf has a whole ass domain expansion
bros ult is domain expantion
this ult is literally domain expansion...
Iso's Ault is like domain expansion
What does fragile status do?
Ryoiki tenkai 🤌🏼
Wait and watch valorant will nerf the sh&t out of it.. probably take down every ability to one 😂😭😭 just wait and watch
DOMAIN EXPANSION
Iso and mordekaiser               🤝
bro added domain expansion
Ryōiki Tenkai
Idiot❤
At this point, I don't think it's even right to compere Valo with CS. Tooooootally different dimensions
I came, Iso, I conquered
Bro is Gojo
Phoenix becomes more and more irrelevant with every new patch XD
That free ability sounds kinda Broken but otherwise he seems one of most balanced agents in while
His ultimate is similiar to the super power of Cordelius from Brawl Stars........
"The Counter Strike killer" 😂😂😂 smh
Domain expansion purple ult
KAY/O mains be laughing in the corner with their knives out.
Imagine dying in your own dimension
Mordekaiser.
ulti like moderkaiser
Question is, where do you respawn if you or the opponent wins the ULT duel? Will you be vulnerable to a spawn kill, coming back to the map?
THEY PUT MORDEKAISRR IN VALORANTE
Next insta lock who agrees likes🥲😅
I didn't like this agent at all. He isn't a flash duelist(Phoenix, Reyna, and Yoru), and isn't a movement duelist(Jett, Neon and Raze) either, breaking the current duelist sub-classes standard. Also, his contingency ability doesn't look like a duelist ability, but a mix between Harbor's cascade and Harbor's cove(quick reminder that Harbor is a controller). Not to mention that we don't need a seventh duelist right now, considering that we only have five sentinels and five controllers, for example.
Ultimate is like a domain expansion
Basically domain expansion
Bro has a literal domain expainsion
Bro had Domain Expansion for his ult
What if he had more than 1 opponent?
Iso ults yoru:❌ Yoru ults back in iso ult✅
I can finally play aimlabs in my Ranked games
Iso: Domain expansion Kill Contract
Braum+mordekaiser 😂
riot running outa ideas
Ultimate is ultimate 🔥🔥
domain expension
It looks like after you kill someone in his ult you can get a free shield if you shoot the orb fast enough
Dota is way better than valorant enjoy your game soyboys
Bro using mordekaiser ult lika a chad !
I just cant help shouting bankai when i see his ult😂😂😂 i love it😂
that new domain expansion is insane
cr1nge 1nd1ans
Are you British ?
Mf brings out his domain expansion
kinda weird ult, cause you lock yourself at one position...and you have to fight again in your own zone...
His ult is a massive counter for shotgun
Ult welcome to brazil lmao
this ult is garbage
Iso goes YOICH TENKAI
Can iso's e can tank a spike?
domain expansion from jjk be like
the thimbnail pisses me off
I am seeing a 'You're going to Brazil meme on .exe videos
can his shield block spike dmg?
What if you have the shield on from double tap and you go into deadlocks ult?
kinda like gojo
Will his shield block a deadlock ulti?
His first ability seems very weak in a game like valorant where sources of single instance high damage is somewhat uncommon (more so somewhat unpredictable), especially with needing to tee up the ability by both killing a separate enemy as well as popping the orb in advance of said incoming or potential damage.  It's an ability targeting single hit high damage abilities and weapons but it feels like Riot's just further trolling Chamber mains lmao.  Excuse me if I be wrong, cuh
This ult won''t work for beginners hahahaha
Bro really has a domain expansion as his ult
Taking your opponent to the Gulag is wild
If the ult is inspired by morde, then I hope they port over how buggy it is too 😂😂😂😂😂
this is going to be the first champ that you get flamed for being bad at the ult
They gonna nerf him real bad
Mordekaiser
Domain expansion😭
Could your just ult in his ult to avoid a fight entirely or does his ult not have a time limit(or too long)
"Domain expansion- shielded techno field"
Ehh not impressed.
a newer version of indian aquaman
Question : If iso ults on Brim can brim take him down with his ult which is on map
So the ult is "all: knife" arena
Imagine tryna diffuse the bomb and suddenly you're in different world
lol iso ult looks fun but mordekaiser ult is better
Wtf his ULT is stupid
this guy is fr playing league of legends and is not tryna touch grass get out of ur house blud
Gojo Satoru died, Iso took his place.
this agent ill get nerf soon..........
If we fake in A and want to check is anybody at B  can we use ult in site if there is anybody in site?
Thats a new jett basically - where only you skill can tell how good you will be - and for some its kinda unlimited
The Extra shield is op
Domain expansion, Bankai.
ult takes the opponent player any where from the map? example :- 1 v 1 situation, you don't know where the enemy is and you r running low on time
Cordelius Brawl Stars
I wonder with his ult if you could wait where he was to knife him when he comes back like you can with phoenix
Kanga! in the ult, it automatically activates the shield ability, so if you kill the enemy, an orb will spawn above their head.
'' 1v1 me bro ''
i just realized, his ult is a counter to dasnerth or any judge user. especially on places like hookah, it's literally a free man advantage. 😂😂
HE IS SO FUCKING USELESS
My 40 fps laptop is gonna enjoy his ult so much
bro got domain expansion
Bullshit ult
if you get a kill first to get the shield, then use your ult, you can't lose the duel
Who tf gave this character a Domain Expension?
My guy can take people to the Gulag
Ryoichi Tenkai
at this point yall just really love whatever tf riot drops
Imagine Iso sets up his ult only to capture Yoru and then Yoru use his ult.... no duels will be happening XD
Domain expansion
Mobile legend player reaction to Iso ult : 😮
Y'know what's really sad tho? The people who play this bland ass game. There is literally no content outside of ranked.   When I reached Radiant after 1 year of grinding, I thought to myself 'now what'. I knew at that moment I had to get my life straight, the amount of money I spent on this trash, I could be saving and build a successful business and so after quitting val, I did exactly that and I'm proud that I left this shit.   Now that I look at other people playing this shit, I can feel nothing but pity for them as they're feeding the very government slaves who don't want good for them.
Gojou Ult
DOMAIN EXPANSION
what does he look like in his ult to other players? will he pop out in the same place? will the enemy team be able to see where he finishes?
Undercut doesn't affect teammates right?
This valo basically Obito Uchiha
Flow state is rip off dismiss imo, the ult is too situational (cant use it against lineups post plant), his undercut seems alright, his wall has much less utility than harbours dome but is invicible so i guess its alright. Can't see how this is as "OP" as everyone is claiming it to be. It's just gonna be another yoru situation
The “Just win your ones” agent .
This is a good agent, I feel his kill shield shouldn’t be 1 hit break but should have some health, takes away game winning weapons like raze ult and op which might upset the community especially in ranked.
that ult is a "no more ideas" scream
Domain Expansion: Kill Contact
He got a whole domain expansion
I bet you he's going to be a worse agent than Reyna. At least Reyna has a flash
The ult is basically domain expansion
So he got a shield cool, can't wait to see smurf got those shield in my match
The ult is pretty cool. I don’t think this agent is particularly game breaking aside from how long that e ability lasts
cooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool agent, but for me yoru is still better
New Valorant agents are gonna be wildin
the solution to homelessness is to help them not harass them - double the disability
Domain Expansion : Infinite Void
iso is saaaaw getting nerfed
bro has a domain expansion as an ult lol
If it only tanks one hit at a time I can’t see it being too meta because it forces your crosshair out of head level to get the effect + you need a kill in the first place. Just my prediction though
AKU ADALAH YIN
NEW MAIN PERMA ULTING THAT BOT FRAGGER ENEMY THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THEIR WINS
He seems realy good and realy balanced
It ultimate is like Yin in mobile legends
Goju found dead in a ditch
My pc's not gonna like that ultimate
bro has the perfect amount of subscribers
already seeing a nerf coming for the signature ability of this agent [nerf will be for jett and chamber]
Few questions regarding his ult What about planting / defusing. What would it look like from the outside? What if im phoenix or kayo ulted and die? Do i get stuck in Australia or smth?
ù có bom keo luôn ngầu quá
Bro really said “domain expansion”
So his ult basically takes them to a virtual gulag...neat
Ryoiki Tenkai
pls val don't add this agent
Imagine dying in ur  own domain expansion💀
Domain expansion goes hard
Domain Expansion
The moment trash talkers that say " 1v1 me bitc*" realize that it's now actually possible to play a 1v1 midgame with ult. I can really see toxic aim players sharting on others.
His ult is like domain expansion (jjk fans will get it)
This is DOMAIN EXPANSION
Brasil gaming (shoutout to my boy mordekaiser 🇧🇷)
That ult should be improved..the opponent will get 50% chance
Ult references: Gulag - COD Brazil - LoL Domain Expansion - Jujutsu Kaisen
Bro can just pull them in Gulag
bro has a domain expansion
There no point of the ultimate, beause without ultimate you kill the enemy or the enemy kills your and in the ultimate you kill the enemy or the enemy kills you
His E is definitely going to get reduced to 1 thats going to be way too strong if he gets 2 charges.
Riot be like- Let's bring domain expansion to valorant 💀
Plane of Euthymia
I bet his ult voice line gonna be "IT'S TIME TO DUEL"
not the domain expansion💀
boring
cant wait to pull out the viper from her ult with his ult
Domain Expansion! 👺
Ain’t no way they add reality marbles
Domain Expansion: kill contract
bro’s ult is literally domain expansion
Domain Expansion
Ryōiki Tenkai
Domain expension
to me, Iso another definition of agents in a wrong role, all of his kits screams controller just like chamber was and still is a duelist.
I wonder if there’s any restriction going in his ult. Or if the opponent can just hide behind the wall with a shorty and store for his team…
radiant servers gonna be filled with 5 stages of grief
Mordekaiser but in human form
That ult is very interesting damn
Why does his abilities seem not so Duelist type, except for the ult and maybe the E.. but the Q seems so broken, it's literally too fast to dodge i guess, and applying vulnerable is OP.. W on the other hand is fine, but not very duelist kinda ability, they are supposed to be offensive rather than defensive?
Imagine ulting and getting 1 tapped
Mordekaiser in valorant 🤣🤣🤣
so if you use your ulti to the enemies smurf then you're f up
can you use ability in the arena?
Iso is the jujutsu kaisen
His ultimate is the fucking gulag
The ult is insane bro💀 riot bringing their game up now. Do something about jett thi
happy mordekaiser noises
so basically his ult is  Shunsui's Bankai  "Katen Kyokatsu Karamata Sinju"
bro got a domain expansion for an ult 💀🤌
Only two words : DOMAIN EXPANSION
Mordekaiser: "welcome to Brazil" Iso: "welcome to the Great Wall of China"
At this point, this would be League of Valorant 😂😂😂 Neon's ult simillar to Zeri, chamber's kinda reminds me of Jhin, now Iso is simillar to Mordekaiser
Iso : "I challenge you to d-d-d-DUEL!"
ryoiki tenkai
Im tunnel visioning Reyna mains with this new agent.
Totally not just a Jujutsu sorcerer
Moddss ult
You sound kinda similar ko aceu
His ult from 3rd person view
bro said mordekaiser.💀
Ult is insane when you're defusing and  enemy just keep jiggling and buying time.
You are going to brazil
Domain Expansion!!!!!!
what was the teaser refrencing?
Busted? Only one way to find out
Bro is gonna get nerf in the very next update 😂😂😂
damn man riot can't have shit lol   Leakers ruin every surprise riot tries to come up with xD
Domain expansion
He literally pulled the domain expansion on his opp
His ultimate ability is just his domain expansion 😂😂😂
When see this and check for the date and it's not the first of April 🤨🤨🤨
When does this agent drop? They should drop all of the last 5 agents concurrently 1 each month at this stage. The game's dead as it is, maybe this will help against cheaters and bots too with this agents abilities or maybe most probably not lol. OCE servers are a literal cheating/hacking and botting show case for hackers to sell their hack now, it's a joke!
Iso's ult = Domain expansion
why do I feel like one of his ult lines is gonna be "WE FIGHT ON MY TERMS!" or something
That ult is so op, nerf Chamber
Tf is this agent 😶😶😶
bro using DOMAIN EXPANSION
The ult is pretty much a mordekaiser ult lmao
Morderkaiser's ult and Yasuo's windwall. ok xD
I wonder if his ult will stop the Spike countdown. If so, that's gonna be an amazing clutch ability.
HE HAS DOMAIN EXPANSION
The ultimate 1v2 counter
So his ult is basically Domain Expansion 😂🔥
domain expansion lmao
"Welcome to gulag"
Better phoenix maybe
They brought jujutsu kaisen to Valorant 😂😂❤️
domain expansion
my guy used Domain Expansion WTF
Domain expansion: Kill Contract
don't think I'll be using his ult anytime soon (I suck at duels [when not using abilities/util])
Does no one see thw problem with his ult, even if you win you just spawn directly where you left off. You gonna be any easy target
His ult sends you into The Gulag
that invulnerability is bullshit
I really hope Riot starts leaning into more unique abilities like Iso's ult. I know some people hate abilities, but I just think they're fun. Let them be stupid and weird, idk.
The most toxic 1v1 "you die you suck" imagine everyone watching.
Phoenix in theory can counter Iso Ulti with his own ult and basically rig the 1v1 with the revive and Iso gains full hp in the ult but reverts back to his original hp amount before ulting.
Watch it get nerfed in next update
Viper ult vs iso ult.. clash of domain expansions damn...
they're making a new OP agent but keeps nerfing those agents that dont need many nerf like Viper
Agents can use Domain Expansion now like in Jujutsu Kaisen 💀
what in the domain expansion is that ulti?
yoo domain expansion
DOMAIN EXPANSION!
Domain expansion in valo b4 gta6
his ult is a nightmare for snipers
bro iso got domain expansion
his ulti like ulti in juijutsu kaisen :v
mf hits you with the domain expansion 😂
Bro why aint no ine talking abt his ult litrelly bieng a domain expansion
Bro has a domain expansion ult💀
a duelist that can counter odin gay yes riot this is what i want
they gave a val agent domain expansion from jjk hehe
Wonder how long the ult lasts and it's viability in stalling 1v1 plant/diff scenarios
DOMAIN EXPANSION
Bro got the GULAG EXPANSION
Bro got domain expansion
valorant is gona be no more fun
BRO USED A DOMAIN EXPANSION ASDFGHJKL
What would happen if two Isos used their ults on each other at the same time? Whose dimension would they get taken to?
Bro got domain expansion
Yasuo W (Windwall) + Mordekaiser Ult, huh imagine getting teleported to Brazil and he use the wall + fragile skill, you will have a bad time xD
Riot's answer to lineup larrys
Iso ultimate belike: domain expansion =)))
Dude has Domain expansion as an ult 😂😂😂
Bro got domain expansion
Femcels, ASSEMBLE
Mordekaiser's ult in Valorant from League of Legends. Slightly modified Zeri from League of Legends in Valorant as a Neon. That's just boring.
imagine he's the one who died when he use his ult..that will be so embarassing..haha
A literal domain expansion
Imagine those who always typed "wanna 1v1?" in the chat to find out who is the better player? Now they will stop ig
Most game are make skill on new hero with domain expansion 💀💀💀
Yoru vibes are real🗣️
Cant wait for the new Release of Agent cuz I already saved up my 8K Kingdom Credits for him
Will u br able to still use abilities within the domain or is it purely just a gunfight   When the timer expires, people could just camp where the ult was activates and shorty you to death like a phoenix ult
They literally made the "1 v 1 me bro" to reality lmaoooo
This is cordilios from brawl stars
His ultimate is a domain expansion😂
Yasuo in a gun fight multiverse
So he kidnaps people....
Nice tank duelist ability
CMIIW E is worse version of  Rayna's dismiss  Q is worse version of Viper's molly  C is worse version of Jett's smoke dash  Ult is worse version of Yoru's ult + Shorty (I am pretty sure i win like 90% duel with that)
now i under stand why he's called iso, because his ult allows you to iso someone
bro we finally weebs can finally use domain expansion
So his ult is literally "WELCOME TO BRAZIL "
can u die in ult, if not its kinda trash, no?
Games with characters that can do some sort of "domain expansion" to bring one enemy with them : - League of Legends (Mordekaiser) - Mobile Legends Bang Bang (Yin) - Brawl Stars (Cordelius) - Now, Valorant (ISO) Do you like these "Isolate one opponent for 1v1" abilities?
Wow is that ultimate gonna be broken in 1v2 situations when they try planting the bomb.
Domain expansion
They just gave bro a Domain Expansion💀
ult looks like domain expansion of jujutsu kaisen
now can you use abilities in that little domain, how would brims map look on there, how would smokes work?
ult is fire af!
Nah bro just bring domain expansion in gun fight
domain expansion
not that good of a kit, don"t even think he's a duelist. E should at least give effect immunity and the ball should be hit through object. C's delay time before activation is too long for a duelist, and should act like Harbor's wall but with bullet and ability block. His Q better gives more than just " enemy takes more dmg".
That shield ability will be ridiculous at high MMR and in the pros
Bro he is insane😮
I just dont like how Valorant is releasing Agents... next act isnt for 2 more weeks and yet everyone knows the abilities already. Takes away that feeling of hopping into a match against a new agent not knowing what to expect.
Riot really said Ryoiki Tenkai
Domain Expansion
He's like Law from op but with guns🔥🔥
Domain expansion
What if 1v2 situation and U kill one and U use the shield thing then then ult that would be dope
i wouldnt say its op i would say its alright
Mf has jujutsu kaisen domain expansion as his ult
That's actually awesome
We need to see what it looks like to be in the ultimate as the enemy
Guy really pulled out his domain expansion...
wow
I hope when he uses his ult, he'll say "Ryoiki Tenkai"
bro really went "domain expansion" 💀
this is litrally gladiator from mincraft hg
cringe.
no, that raze ult just missed and did 10 dmg
soooo he is not an entry duelist ?
His ult is pretty much similar to Mordekaisers'
Iso is trash
Now I can isolate 1v1s that I don't win
1:10 that was the  most horrible confusing explanation which doesn't explain anything  i dont even know what he means when he says viper molly kj alarmbot and double damage  Just say the effect is similar to kj alarmbot and it's mechanic is like an omen flash, viper molly is almost a  completely different mechanic
HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM?
They really brought domain expansion from jujutsu kaisen to valorant😂
bro just domain expansion that nigga
just nerf chamber
“in my box, full piece, 200”
Can’t wait to be walking to site with my team and then suddenly I get kidnapped and domed
I can’t wait to scream in team chat “domain expansion” and proceed to get one tapped by the Smurfing jett on the enemy team
jjk domain expansion
his ult is fucking domain expansion
Bro really said domain expansion
his ult is a domain expansion
Iso: You are going to Brazil  Mordekaiser: I like the way you think
Domain expansion
His ult voice line better be “DOMAIN EXPANSION”
DOMAIN EXPANSION GO CRAZY
Can Omen ult into/out of the Iso ult?
Not gonna lie, for me at first glance this agent seems underwhelming compared to the more recent ones. His signature is just a Jett dash and Reyna dismiss hybrid only that it blocks 1 bullet and that's it. The vulnerability thing is nice but it lasts briefly.
Remaining enemy player: i should be able to win this 1v1-  Iso: *Domain Expansion*
Ain’t no way bro has a Domain Expansion
Domain expansion???!!
It would be interesting to see if this Double Tap ability could stop a deadlock ult
Motherpaker just do a sukuna on agents
I can already see people using his ult on bot fraggers
He might be broken in a sense just think he is a duelist without a flash but he might have the best entry. Especially haven think about it first throw the wall and push with the wall like Harbour throw your weakening ability and use double tap if u good in this u can always enter for sure but speed is taken in this equation while other duelists with speed don’t have sure shot entry
Unique but not that good
Excited to see how his abilities interact with other agents' abilities
I'm shit at 1v1's but cool ig 🥲
I cant lie I dont think this champ is going to be very good. Seems E and X seem to gimmicky while C and Q seem straight up bad abilities
what if i yoru tp out of his ult? he just stays there by himself?
Im going to make so many friends in that ult
yo, does anyone know if u have to maintain LOS for that ult to work? or if u get hit by that floor u get teleported in
From all of the agents that has been released this episode, i think ISO is the most 'game changing' agent i've ever seen. But what i do want to point out is his "Energy Wall" is a bit too similar to harbor's cascade, "why would you pick a water wall that's spamable when you can use an energy wall that can completly block an odin?" And that is my first concern.  Now, the Ultimate. It is VERY bizzare for Riot to make this in Valorant, and im still wondering how will the agent look like when ulting? Will he be killable or not when casting? Will the agent's get repositioned randomly? There are so many questions about this.  Nonetheless, Im really Hyped up for this agent and will see how this will play out.
Bro has a domain expansion for his ult
how will viper ult and his ability interact
Man as a sentinel main, this would be very hard for us to deal with cause most of the time we handle a site alone.
No wonder his name is iso
he literally takes you into the gulag
Bro they really gave him a domain expansion 😮
Dr Strange joined the lobby
reminds me of cornelius from brawl stars for some reason
ult looks like phoenix, but worst. You actually can die and like phoenix ult, when its done you just come back to where u used it so yea ..
Bro took the name "duelist" a lil bit too srsly 💀
Suprising balance , i love it
tenz' gonna be unkillable with this agent
ISO Ult voice line : RYOIKI TENKAI ! (DOMAIN EXPANSION !)   😂😂
Imagine trying to stop spike defuse, then a freaking shield suddenly coming towards u and then you got transported to a freaking other dimension. I already love this agent.
Nahhh hes clearly gonna get nerfed so hard
Iso's concept takes DUEList to a whole new level. I love all the abilities a lot, though his ult is def my favorite
Domain expansion ult
Welcome to Brazil
I love the agent but honestly he’s not going to be very good. I feel like this is another release yoru situation but a little better
DOMAIN EXPANSION 😭😭😭
Domain expansion lol
agent seems soooo cool
this mfer has a god damn domain expansion
They fr gave him a domain expansion
The devs are running out of ideas lol That Ult is just silly tbh
So wait this guy's ult is the mfing Gulag?
domain expansion
not gonna lie. looks like it's gonna be another shitty duelist.
With all this agents, Jett is still unbeatable
this nigga is gojo
THE NERFS ARE COMING!!
so his ult is domain expansion jujutsu kaisen??
iso's ult is just a domain expansion
i cant believe he has a domain expansion
What if he kills you in the ult
His ult is mordekaiser ult
Mordekaiser ult in valorant lol
does the double tap affect not end after a kill? does this mean you can chain kills like reyna ult?
ISO : Domain Expansion !
Literally no one: ISO: *Domain Expansion: Malevolent Shrine*
So a mordekaiser ult in valorant. But overall the agent looks realy realy weak for a duellist. Nothing realy to make space. Debuff ability? You should entry and not support other duellists as duellist. Only the wall but ok on wich map is that realy usefull dunno
bro has a domain expansion
Only thing I’m worried about how fast you come back from your ult. Do you load in invincible and get to instantly move, or is that “loading screen” taking time allowing the game time to catch up and your already back in the game without being able to see. Basically this can be really good. Or it’s like phoenixs ult and your dead once you come back.
lets see how many people will insta lock this agent and have no idea how to play it until 3 months at least
The ability to stop1 taps is op
This agent going for nerf for sure
These are so bad I hate it
Bro really gets a domain expansion for an ult???
Ryoikki Tenkai
Already loving this agent but I really hope he dosen't get nerfed like chamber when he releases, even chamber dominated for a year atleast
He literally puts you into a domain expansion 💀
So they added domain expansion to val
They never said fragile is vulnerable
The thing is, can the enemy move behind the wall like us or is he frozen until the duel starts ? If he's frozen then its a pretty much headshot for iso as pre aim will be at middle
Domain Expansion
HE HAS A DOMAIN EXPANSION NO WAY 😭
What's Valorant gonna look like in a year?? Next an agrnt will be doing jumpscares as an ability
Bro got his own domain Expansion
I wonder if you could use abilities inside his ult or if it's only gunplay
They rly made his ult a domain expansion😂
domain expansion in valorant is crazy
welp all the instalock reynas and now gonna be instalock isos perfect 💀
You are going to Brazil!
his ult is essentially a domain expansion
I think he would have been better as an iniciator
imagine that shield wall pushing down haven c long its almsot a gurantee get on site
cant wait for my domain exapansion moments
Imagine you are defusing and the next thing you see is ISO’s bdsm room
This man is broken I’m sorry but this cannot be fair lol
can enemies still ult in his domain? imagine if iso brings yoru in his dimension and yoru just ults lmao
Riot really said “domain expansion!” With this ult
The domain expansion update is insane!
Bro really do domain expansion
His ult is like domain expansion from jjk
NGL fell like domain expansion from jujutsu kaisen :))
Riot outdid themselves
if u are 2v1 even if u die inside the ult (if u died it's actually pretty bad for u bc you had 1 spot to aim for x) but ye ) your teammate will trade u easily after
We got domain expansion in valorant now
bro riot added the gulag to valorant
can you use ability inside the ult tho
bro has domain expansion 💀
Domain Expansion: Duel to the Death
How long is his ult duration?  There has to be a specific time coz u can trap an enemy in a 1v1 situation so they cant defuse
we have gojo but in valo
Lol i am getting mordekaiser flashbacks
I like how his name is ISO it reminds me of like a basketball 1v1
HAHAHA NO WAY THEY HAVE MORDE ULT LOL
how his ult gonna work on whole team?
The ult be like: 1v1 me bro
Domain expansion ❤
If you kill the enemy, does the ult recharge? (It should...)
I can definitely see him being used in pro play, his gameplay isnt as selfish as reyna. He can really get u and your team on sight fr with the right comms and that ult is deadly, u cant deny crucial plants or save em especially in a 2v1 and 1v2 situation. How many times have we died and lost around simply cuz u couldnt isolate a fight or u were simply too low cuz when u get in his ult u basically have a slight advantage and automatically have 150 health or even if u dont win it can act as a time stall for a couple of seconds so ngl i can honestly see him being in tournaments ngl. His ult is just so viable for a lot of situations people just not thinking outside the box with it
How does blocking 1 instance of damage work against shotguns?
His ult is a domain expansion
BRO THE ULT IS A FUCKING DOMAIN EXPANSION!!!!!!
so his ult is gulag form COD.
I can't wait to get caught in his ult and kill him just for him to rage in chat this his ult is useless and everyone to reply "skill issue"
before the release i take a guess of what the next agent should be before KAYO i thought the game is heavily depended on utility usage so i said the next agent will be a agent that will cancel utility and there it goes now before they released this agent i thought of one tapping is a little powerful also the guns can deal more damage than 150 so it means they have to add a new agent which will have health beyond 150 maybe as shields and ISO came out well im now guessing that an agent will be released with a utility that depends on the enemy count like skyes ult.....
bro got that "Domain Expansion" Ult.
Naah and I thought Viper ult is the only domain expansion we get in Valorant. This shit is crazy.
mordekaiser brazil
They should make the ult a knife fight ngl.
does he get an advantage when his in ult? like does double damage activate for the enemy or does he get the double tap buff or is it just a 1v1?
Welcome to Brazil...
yeah domain expansion is here in val bois.
domain expansion
So the ult is usless?
so we get gojo satoru in valorant
The agent looks horrible. Everything he does another agent does better.
The ult is good for also phasing out the enemy. Example a 2v1 defuse situation where your teammate can defuse while you phase out the enemy. Or maybe a situation where even if you  lose the duel, by the time the enemy comes back, the other teammates can just dunk on him.
Is that the gulag?
So your telling me he has a worse Reyna “heal”, worse omen blind, and a worse harbor wall. As well as an ult that doesn’t gain info and doesn’t really give you an edge over you opponent. This agent looks ass,
He’ll probably be nerfed at least three times before official release😂
Oh man, another ego duellist so that smurfs can rank up faster! Thanks riot.  But jokes apart, he looks really good
Add more cover in the ult
operator player💀💀💀
This agent looks cool but as a dues list I can’t see him being better than any of the others. In fact I think all his abilities are kinda ass
he has a jjk domain expansion as his ult omg
Domain Expansion basically
domain expansion???
Long story short this guy can send the enemy to Brazil?
proplayer, please don't add SHIELD ABILITY to valorant game... riot : here we go !!!!!!!
GULAG!!!
Have a question about his ult, does it clear all debuffs/buffs before the enemy goes in and I can it be used to dodge a KJ ult?
hmmm. seems pretty busted
When Enemy Go to Plant And you have Ult 😏😏
I wanna know if the enemy instantly leaves the arena in his Ult, if not it could be pretty good in a small time situation
Jokes on you ISO I play deadlock I DARE YOU to use your ult on me 😎😎😎
I think Iso will be one of the hardest agents in the game to learn honestly, his kit is a little straightforward but my god the coordination it'll require
Incoming before the "Welcome to Brazil/China" memes come out when using his ult
bro got domain expansion
broken agent
oh nahh man, they done gave bro a domain expansion💀💀💀
my fps is gonna tank even more now
Holyy
if you in 1v1 clutch and the enemy killed you this gonna be so embarrassing
I’m surprised I haven’t seen anyone mention it yet, but his ult could be massive against an enemy viper’s pit. It probably could pull the viper out of the pit long enough to force the pit down even if you lose, and while you are dueling the viper, your team can more safely push into the pit if need be.
bro really said “run my 1s son” with his ult
ult in a nutshel - Domain expansion CS warmup
How long does the double tap shield last
Iso ults: Domain Expansion.
the ult is like a fricking domain expansion 🤣
bro really said domain expansion on these hoes wtf
Broken agent until the next updates where  will be eventually fixed...
domain expansion
this guy is so weird what. his character design is cool though 🦔❄
Just as I thought they couldn't copy CS more than they have, they add the 1v1 warmup before comp games
and Harbor cove costs $300 and you can destroy it in a second
Basically his ult is the gulag in cod warzone
i hate the people that are gonna instalock him because hes new like bro i get it you want to play him but customs and the range exist for a reason like please learn him before insta locking like i main yoru and thats only because i learned him in customs and practiced in the range you instalockers hop on the game get the agent immediately test him out in comp then complain to your teammates for dying
they gave blud Yuji's domain expansion
domain expansion
Расширение территории
This guy is like , Omen's past self. Lol
domain expansion!
Bro really said "Domain Expansion" for his ult💀
Bro really got a domain expansion
the ult is Mordekaiser from LOL ult really cool agent tho
Domain expansion ult
Actually a unique and great idea for ult
dude got a domain expansion fr
Riot gonna definately reduce the time of each  ability for damn sure 😂
BROOOOOO ISO just mean ISOLATE WHATTTT
tbh, my guy gives me Gojo Satoru vibes with his abilitys
I can see some setious nerfs incoming 💀
Someone was inspired by JJK
i am so down to get ulted and then win yes pls
BRO GOT A DOMAIN EXPANSION
his ult is literally DOMAIN EXPANSION 😂😂😂
What sucks about the ult I still can't win gun fights 😂
League of legend vibes
Meanwhile Riot : okay guys it's time to NURF
He took Viper's "Welcome to my world!" a bit too seriously...
Domain expansion !!!
His ult is like domain expansion from jujutsu kaisen😂
Me who climbed to Diamond through ratting and taking unfair fights: I will not be using the ult.
His ultimate is literally a domain expansion lol
Idk the alt is so stupid
Hello new main
Unfortunately he kinda seems weak negl
Ult gives u chance he couldn't defused the spike 😂😂😂 if its 1v1
domain expansion ass ult
Imagine those potato wannabes using this agent's ult lmao
if you ult and whiff and die best believe am flaming you bad
anyone that already struggles with fps will hate the ult
Bruhh his ult is the GULAG!🤣
His ult is literally a domain expansion
bro got his own domain expansion
Now compare this to deadlock,    R.I.P. deadlock
I look forward to this update. This is heat
imo they should change a bit to this since this looks not that good: c - stay the same its good q - stay the same its good e - the shield after shot makes you invincible for like 1 second not just 1 shot since for spraying weapon it is useless and so he can dismiss from a fight, he is a duelist ult - Make the enemy stunned/paranoya/ make them 50 hp and yourself 150 so there is an advantage to iso side, its a ult overall
Mf has a gulag fight as an ulti
Iso’s Ult sends you to Brazil
So basically his ultimate is a domain expansion
My bronze instalock iso def gonna make are team loose
no movement ability what a shame.. instead of the Q if he had like a tp or something like that it  would be the best agent, i can see the patches coming already
Bro has a Rust 1v1 as and ult
Oh god the Sova/iso on accent is gonna be a nightmare.
bro took his role as duelist into the next level
Iso really just went "Domain Expansion"
what does the ult look like from third person view? for how long is iso vulnerable after entering the realm? when does he appear back in the main map and when does he become vulnerable after coming back? when exactly do you take control of your normal body (how many frames before the overlay is fully gone)? what happens to your health or shields after you win the ultimate fight?
Ultimate Feels like Jujutsu domain expansion
Bro has a Domain Expansion for his Ult Xd
Coolest new agent since idk when
Now that is a domain expansion
I wonder how his ult look to other agents in the game
THAT ULTI IS STUPID! only good if u have good aim unlike raze. only useful when enemy planted spike and keep dodging/hiding from u
They brought a gulag in valorant😂😂😂
The E effect is actually op af if you think about it.. Imagine a how hard u could abuse it with an Odin 💀
This guy takes "1v1 me then pussy" to the most literal level
Can’t wait for ult interactions with other agents.
Domain expansion be like
This ult looks ridiculous, but it’ll be fun, fresh, and exciting for both you using it, and the enemy it catches. They at least get a chance, as opposed to many other ultimates abilities that can often feel quite oppressive.
I wonder if his shield will block an entire shot from a judge or just a single pellet
I feel like people are missing the best part of the ULT, wouldn't the best part of it be dragging the opponent out of hiding in a 1v1? for example on retake they could come from anywhere
deadlock was so ass
Bro needs aperture and shutter immediately
Wait, you know knife duels? What if we knife duel with his ult? Like you know, true honor?
change his ult.
Can't believe I can throw my silver opponents into the gulag now
gun fights in brazil seems legit to me
He looks very balanced actually... the Double Tap ability doesn't seen that good, considering you'll have to take your aim off a potential threat to gain a single bullet shield (imagine teamfights).   That said, his other skills are pretty good. The shield looks excellent for a push into plant site and a debuff that helps kill people 2x faster is always welcome. If the projectile goes through walls and etc. then, even better (i haven't seen if it does).  The ultimate may pass as a mvp only thing but, if you consider you're going to remove someone (possibly the most annoying opponent) from the map for sometime, preventing a contest or disarm, then even a average player with Iso can cause a lot of trouble.  Feels like a high-risk / reward agent, and that's fine.
So Kaname Tosen's Bankai
Can the enemy kill iso in his ult?
Yowai mo
damn
Looking at how they put in the Mordekaiser ult, maybe we get more abilities based off LoL characters.  Although looking at Harbor's wall and how Jett's dash had multiple stacks, those are probably inspired by Nami and Ahri.
This character doesent seem good at all.. especially his q. It doesent last for long and the omen flash is just way better..
Bro this man’s ult is a domain expansion 😂
Domain expansion finna go hard
nahh they ripped the domain expansion from jjk 😭😭
So it is no idea to use his ult if more agent are alive on the enemy team since it only works on 1 person? this means that the other person can defuse the spike while you are int here batteling him. Do both player "disapear" from the map so other ppl on your team see raze here and can shoot her too? I am very unfused how this works
hes gonna get nerfed so hard
Cant wait to lose every ult duel because im trash at the game xD
But I can’t have my instant dash
I am so happy! I play tested him a while ago. So cool seeing the effects and final product
Bro got a domain expansion😭
His ultimate ability is the Gulag 💀
Ulti morderkaiser cuy
bros ult is doman expansion
Mordekaiser
Most skill required agent yet. Can't wait to see all those instalockers with no idea what they're doing
Bro casually did domain expansion
everytime i ulti with him i die i guess
Domain Expansion ULT HHAHAHAAH
Feels Like Mordekaiser Son Wants to Play Another Game Totally :D
its literally domain expansion lol
But ngl its breaking the game alr
Let's D-D-D-DUEL!!
Nahhhhhh nerf chamber
Bro got a moderkaizer ult
domain expansion Jujutsu Kaisen ( Iso Ult)
bro got that domain expansion no way 💀
Kinda seems like another Reyna-type of Agent that Smurfs will use to drive lower elo lobbies mad. Everything looks cool though, to say something positive.
Nerfed in less than a week, nark my words. His signature ability is *insane* to add to a tactical fps, even with all the bullshit in the game already. This will easily be the most broken ability.   Ult is pretty cool tho.
They adding domain expansions now??
Ulti is like a domain  expansion from jjk
Bro has a domain expansion
Wow
Tbh, somehow it looks very mid for me. Only the E skill that very useful, it works like Reyna dismiss. You can just walking around from the wall then kill him. For the ult, if you have kinda bad aim, it's the weakest ult but the most unique.
Iso be like: 'Ryoiki Tenkai, Muryo Kusho'  (Domain Expansion, Infinite Void)
Never heard about ISO dying in his ult. Does he get killed or just released?
His ult if u are not tenz it's 50/50
dude they copied this ultimate from Mobile legend Bang Bang , "yin" character lol they lack content   😂😂😂😂😂😂
Devs watched too much Jujutsu kaisen
They really gave him a domain expansion 😭😭💀💀💀
His ult is basically a domain expansion from jjk , cool
I wonder what the interactions with the ult is going to be... could u fall off? Would it somehow be bugged with Omen tp? Will a Brim ult just toast you inside there? How about Viper ult? An Arena inside an Arena 😂😂 wait yeah if ISO vs ISO and he ult while inside the ult... 😅
His ult is sure hit domain expansions except ur aim
Imagine he using his ult and scream out DOMAIN EXPANSION in chinese it would be great
My man, you always come on top with Valorant updates. Keep it up!
The ult is the gulag
Love how ISO's ULT literally sends you both to GULAG!
Talk about a Domain expansion ult
Ahhh so you can die from your own ult 😂😂😂
DOMAIN EXPANSION
Domain expansion is it ahh, inspired by jjk it seems.
You didn't cover the fact that if you get a kill with double tap and destroy the orb, you regenerate your health if you're low
Bro pulled out a domain expansion dawg wtf😭
Damn is ult like domain expansion 😂 but I like him so amazing 😮❤
He does not look like a duelist…
Imagine amount of time the ult will waste if it is done while in attackers side defenders will lose the chance of defending
Bankaii... senbonzakura
That would make him an actual good team player
Ain't this broken af?
Domain expansion
Abilities seem okay, i do not like the ult tho it just doesn't feel right for a game like valorant. It just seems lik such a change in pace that I dont like.
The ult is straight up the domain expansion from jujutsu kaisen
For me it would be a better ult if for instance you die and you respawned in the same location you died at
wait, this is just Deadlock ult but u can actually fight back
THEY TOOK EVERYTHING FROM DEADLOCK AND GAVE IT TO HIM TO MAKE HIM OP
Newcastle shield fr
I wonder if the signature effect carries over into the shadow realm when you ult
The ult..im gonna hold my breath before i use it..and i ll scream: RYOIKI TENKAIII!!!!!
bro is jujutsu witch. the ult is domain expansion
Bro has a domain expansion
E is ok w one charger, wall reasonable ult, ok weakness effect thingy
Bro said " Domain Expansion : 1v1 "
Dude has a fucking Domain Expansion
ISO be like  : "Ryōiki Tenkai : now you dead mf"
His ult looks like the gulag from war zone 😂
What's the interaction between Deadlock ult and Iso ult?  Can you Sage ult someone if they die in Iso ult?  Can Iso ult grab Omen mid tp or Omen ult the same way Deadlock's can? Can Iso ult grab Yoru clone or Yoru in ult?  Can agents use abilities in Iso ult? Can Iso ult grab a dismissed Reyna? Can Iso ult save you from spike explosion?  Can Iso ult be Brim ulted? How long does Iso ult last? Can Skye ult in Iso ult, and how man dogs will be summoned? Can enemies shoot Iso's Q orb first? What is the interaction between a ticking damage like a molly and Iso Q? Does each explosion of Raze nade count as a separate damage instance to Iso Q? What about Breach's wall explosion? Where does Viper wall land if used in Iso ult? Where do the remnants/orbs of Gekko util go after Iso ult? What about Brimstone's stim beacon, Deadlock's Barrier Mesh, Cypher util, Killjoy util, all smokes, Astra orbs? What if Phoenix ult's in Iso ult? Where does he go if he wins or dies? What if Phoenix ults before and then gets ulted by Iso? Does Astra's ult cut through Iso ult? And also the map at the same time?  Can Chamber TP out of the Iso Ult? What about Yoru? What happens if Kay/O ults in Iso Ult? What happens if Kay/O is downed after ulting in the Iso ult, does he need to fully die before the Iso ult end? Does Neon's relay bolt and Sova arrow and other util bounce of Iso ult's walls? Does it have walls? Harbor's wall, what happens if he uses it before Iso ult or during Iso ult? What happens if  Can Omen ult out of Iso ult?  Can Sova ult spike while in Iso ult? Can Brim as well? Or Breach? Killjoy?  Can Jett and Raze and Omen get on top of the Iso walls in Iso Ult? Are they walls or false walls like his ability?  Can Skye dog and Fade cat go through Iso's ult walls and what about the regular walls?  Wow this is gonna be a lot of testing...
ISO stands for isolated shitty omelette
riot games be cooking diff
Sick I can't wait for my 0-8 ISO to ult a cypher and lose, then somehow still blame the team.
Rule: iso ult knife fight only 💀💀💀
Domain expansion in Valorant is crazy
The vulnerability is going to be a huge ass problem, imagine that with ANY FUCKING DAMAGE ABILITY THIS GAME HAVE
Still waiting for Aphelios's kit in Valorant That would be cool, imagine a duelist that could make a random weapon from his skills
What a Meh Agent
So does the ult cover the entire map or do you have to aim?
we need more movement based agents
RIOT RELEASE HIM ALREADY I CANT WAIT HE IS SO COOL
Its like a domain expansion ngl
Just so y’all know: His double tap also works on assists, and the timer refreshes every time u get a kill/assist & shoot the orb  Also: No, you can’t stop the wall
Domain expansion: Kill Contract
The throwable vulnerable thingy is i guess the worst ability😢
What the fuck is this? I'm genuinely confused
His ult is literally domain expansion
His ult is kind of like cornelius ult from brawl stars🤔
Bro got a domain expansion 💀💀
bro using domain expiation
I love playing Morde in League. Now I get to play him in valorant too.
1v1 me scrub
no more agents pls atleast for a year
the ult is basically domain expansion
They made mordekaiser
with his signature ability, what happens if he get's brim ult['ed?
What Happens when Two or More Opponent comes in his Ult trap? 😅
bro told about morde ult while i was testing full ap morde XD
Ngl but yoru >>>>>
Double tap is crazy lol. You could have that + Undercut to gain the nuttiest upperhand during ult.  But the craziest part is you know you'll tank 1 extra bullet. No more Jonas sova 1 shot line ups. 😂 jk u have to be very lucky to even have it up when suddenly 2 random arrows drop at you xD.  But like really, you could just quick peek someone, shoot a random bullet, no need to be headshot, and hide, only for you to do the same thing but u shoot the buff instead. In most scenarios even, enemies mostly take cover after taking damage, so that is your ez opportunity to get the shield.
He got that domain expansion
Bro casually have domain expansion as an ulti💀💀
DID HE JUST USE A DOMAIN EXPANSION??
Bro's ult is a domain expansion
the ult is a domain expansion straight outta jjk ong
Bro really got the domain expansion
So, basically, he represents an improved concept compared to Reyna. He's designed as an agent who excels in 1v1 situations, rather than being suited for entry. His abilities are specifically geared towards providing him with a significant advantage in 1v1 encounters. The one exception might be his wall, which could be considered somewhat op. His double tap ability is decent; it's not exceptional but far from lackluster. His Vulnerable ability is quite effective, granting him an advantage in 1v1 scenarios.Then his ultimate skill rounds out his kit, focusing on 1v1 encounters while still granting him an edge by allowing him to peek from behind either wall. This character is well designed for 1v1 scenarios in Valorant imo. If you're solely looking for frags and aim, Reyna might still be the better choice, but if you prefer a strategic, ability-focused gameplay experience, this agent is more for you.
so bad
rip my fps
You are going TO BRAZIL!
I thought his signature would be teleport just like yoru 😂
Domain expansion…
Imagine getting hit by "Domain Expansion" .
DESTINY. DOMINATION. DECEIT.
There is no chance this mf sees pro play unless it's just someone picking them to flex
iso domain expantion
"We will never put shields that block bullets in the game"  Someone named Riot
ISO players ulting: "RYOIKI TENKAI"
Ima just make friends with the enemy I’m going against so that we can chill in the ult
it cant be ...
How are you supposed to enter site with this duelist 😬😬😬
Domain expansion duel sheshhh
his ult is basically a domain from jjk
wait now we have domain expansion on valorant!?
His wall is insane thou, I totally see pheonix or breach (if breach can flash through iso's wall) rush with him.
Pretty good, Pretty good... but Brimstone has a Stimpack.
Chamber 2
Does that raze just push through the wall in the ult?
Guess they'll nerf his "E" window like they did with Jett's dash in the future since it stacked up if you get a kill before the time window runs out.
His ult is literally gojo's domain expansion
his ult is like domain expension from jujutsu kaisen
His ult just gives my opponent a free kill.
If he doesn't scream "Domain expansion" while actiating his utl i'm not buying
Bro's ult is really him just calling iso, run the 1's 😂.
ult is domain expansion
I don't like his entry potential as a duelist agent, He is better on the backline trading and enabling his team but he is good in clutch situations.
Bro really have a domain expansion as an ult
He looks really clunky
If already see the nerfs coming in
His ultimate is like morde Kaiser for league that's cool
So if enemy s defusing, u can pull him out of the game n play 1 v 1 n play time?
He basically feels like a nerfed out gojo TBH, he even has a nerfed domain expansion without the sure hit effect
Idk but an E ability that you can buy totally canceling an ult that takes 8 points to get seems a little bit unbalanced to me.
the ult is pretty useless if you are ass :3
nerf this agent the instant it gets released and also change the fucking ult with something else
Ngl, for me, iso seems a little bit like a support duelist. For example, you can use his walls to shield teammates.
So it also brings you to Brazil like Morde 🤣
His ult is basically a domain expansion, i love it
i think that isn't duelist, it is like  sentinal and controler
Valorant on the road to kill itself
let s goo the brazil (VALO EDITION)
Good video but audio kinda too bassy
Domain expansion?
They actually just added Mordekaiser to an FPS game lmao
What happens when the spike is just about to explode but he ults just before it explodes so he is in the other dimension?
Look at all the weebs in the comments💀
bruh I don't even play this shit game and I can tell he's OP as fuck xD My man has a domain expansion that rivals the one of Gojo.
i like his e ability when u kill a person and when u asorb the orb after killing it makes a shield which can protect from raze ult
Great. So his ultimate is a sort of gulag but instead of dying and going into it, he can just do it at will :)
MOBA FPS
domain expansion
Brazil is comming to valorant finally
Bro has a domain expansion 😂
Time to uninstall the game.
What is his Q?
I wonder if that ult in a 2v1 can be used to take the enemy player out of commission for long enough for a spike defuse. Like, you ult with the intent to stall, not to fight
Does his E ability break after a set amount of damage or can it just rank one hit. Basically does it block a shotgun or a spraydown
The wall is so good for defusing long plants bro
My frames gonna be fuked
his ult is a domain expansion fr 😂
1 v1 with deadlock hahaha
A duelist that brings you to a duel. So excited to solo 1vs1 in my domain expansion 🗿
if his ult doesn’t go through walls then he’s not gonna be that great, over all i dont thinks he’s gonna be too good especially in competitive, seems fun tho
I think double tap is a little op ngl
U are going to Brazil
So basically the ult is a replica of JJK's domain expansion?
Wait, can the enemy agent inside his ultimate use util?
So he has super harbor wall, omen blind but that causes vulnerable, Reina heal 2.0 minus the heal part, and a freaking guessing game?  This looks busted.
Iso is so good
Jett still better
mordekaiser ult
I don't think his abilities are that good. i could see his ult being used in a 1v1 retake scenario, but his vulnerability thing is just not that useful, especially in higher ranks, you just get one tapped anyway. his wall is kinda just a worse harbor wall but his e is really good i think, in pistol rounds maybe even op. as long as you get a kill tho
so basically domain expansion
That is dope
its giving the domain expansion vibe from jjk
can you use abilities in ults? becuase if so then doing it with a omen would be gg ez
His ult was derived from Apex's idea for revenant's rework where we was originally supposed be summoned into the shadow realm for a 1 v 1
DOMAIN EXPANSION TYPE SHI
ok so hes ass lol
His ult is litteraly domain expansion
When will it release again??
Domain expansion: Arena
DOMAIN EXPANSION
riot made GOJO in valorant Ryōiki Tenkai
Bro straight up has a domain expansion
BRO LITERALLY HAS A DOMAIN EXPANSION
BRO JUST RYOIKI TENKAID WITH HIS ULT
Bro literally whips out a domain expansion for he's ult..
His ult gives you the opportunity to stop the defusing of spike by the enemy in 1v1 case
Does this new agent live up to the bugs that Mordekaiser has brought to League
His broken
So his ult is basically Domain expansion
This is the Gulag!! if you survive you earn your freedom!!
lame lol
Another aim based ultimate. HAHAHAHA i can imagine bot fragging Iso ulting enemy smurf top frag.
such a pity that no one will pick him in pro scene
bro really just said "Domain expansion!"
Imagine using your Ult and dying lmao.💀
ISO HAS HIS OWN DOMAIN EXPANSION.......LOL
Well this character 100% is gonna have a hard time finding value he kind of feels like a solo queue agent and nothing more.
Its ult is litreally a domain expansion
THEY ADD DOMAIN EXPENSION IS VALORANT WTF
Ayt time to switch to csgo. Fuck all of these shitty skills.
ult is a domain expansion
No need to worry about raze ult yay and now it is kinda is ez for 2v1
Bro Is the definition of being broken💀💀
He has domain expansion sounds fun
The ult is basically the Domain Expansion of a character of Jujustu Kaisen. Just imagine it. DOMAIN EXPANSION: Kill Contract.
He seems very similar to Reyna. An agent that can gain off of the kills he gets, but doesn't have a lot of tools to help him get them. I think his wall will definitely be a good ability for making space though.
looks weak as f
Wait why did the timer stay on for double tap even after his shield went down when the raze ulted him? Can you get multiple shields in the time frame by getting more kills?
This guy looks broken as hell, and I'm salty that he gets a moving wall when Harbor's Cove is still broken and doesn't work as advertised.
very op ;(
Is ult is like literally a domain expansion
What if Iso ults on Yoru and Yoru ults inside his dimension??
that ult got a f ing finisher💀
my guy has domain expansion
Reyna 2.0
these abilities are so stupid the double tap makes no sense let´s say you peek two players and get a headshot on the first one then instead of aiming for the second guy you´d aim for a sphere in the air so you can get a shield? and the ultimate makes no sense why would someone want to go for a 1v1 in a weird other location. other agents ults can get you free kills and you don´t have to 1v1 anyone lmao.
His ult is even more strong, given he’s able to have his E up before ulting someone else, giving him a bigger advantage in a 1v1
Bro imagine comboing his vulnerable with a raze nade on map chokepoints during a hard rush, haven C or A, Ascent B, Split A, so op
Chamber main be wilding right now
THATS SO FUCKING COOl
wtf did I just watch. Bro this agent looks fire
👍
Bro has a fucking domain expansion I am maining that char
I could see his wall and wingman go for an easy plant in ranked
RYOIKI TENKAI
the noob player gonna dont like this agent but the pro player gonna play this every time that gonna be interesting (i am french soo my english are bad)
They've given up on releasing good agents, tf is their dev team doing.. there's barely any lore that they've released and they just keep on adding these over the top agents.. good thing I didn't spend too much on thia game
takes shotgun and ults lol, 1000 percent this will destroy the game
how does the ult looks like for other players?? u just dissapear for them?
Technically his abilities give him a bit of every role. The shield is kind of Sentinel + Controller. The vulnerable thingy is kind of Initiator. The ult and unique are definitely Duelist playstyle. This is top tier design to be honest.
Bro got domain expansion
DOMAIN EXPANSION
Holy
wtf
Can't wait to suck someone in just for them to one tap me fr fr.
really wish he had a flash to blind ngl. I think that would be much more useful than one of his abilities. Maybe that fragile ability could blind just like omen. He still seems fun to play though
iso domain expansion
Okay then guess operater will die then.
ult = Domain expansion
wtf  thats  insane
The 1v1 ability is hard 😭
Very Strong agent, but you will need a crazy good aim to master him
Mordekaiser type beat
portal fruit from bloxfruit
Man's doing a domain expansion
Got my new main thx
I'm curious as to whether the ult keeps traveling till it hits someone or does it have an area and if no one is in that area then its just wasted?
it also looked like you can't use other abilities inside the ult as it has kayo knife like marking over enemy body
Dota templar assasin said hi
this ult is crazy
Dude literally has a domain expansion
Purple
Having a domain expansion is crazy
Bro literally has a domain expansion
You may add that if none of the players in ult somehow wont kill each other in 15 seconds they both die
gojo's    Domain expansion ♟️
Ult: Domain expansion 😍
Looks like the odin meta will start.
Ok Op
Imagine this thing: ISO takes deadlock to his dimension, and then deadlock traps him. Or omen tps out. Would be fun, but i guess abilites are off in that duel
bro he is crazy
I'm so excited for Iso, the new mechanics are really interesting and will definitely affect the meta. i wonder how the ult will look from the teammates' perspectives.
Plus its ult gives you a premium finisher unlike default one
Damn its just domain expansion
so this is mordekaiser son in another timeline
Ah, all the duels I''ll lose when I pop that ult
Projectile block, Vulnerability(paranoia) also goes through walls, Double tap to get shield that blocks 1 instance of ANY damage that can be refreshed on kill and an ultimate that forces a 1v1 50/50 duel which you could cast after using Double tap(having shield) or Undercut(vulnerability) to increase those odds even further.  Great anchor for spike holds, pairs well with omen/viper/fade. Would like to know his interaction using Killing Contract(x) with the likes of an enemy hit by Fade ultimate. Do they get reduced health going into that ultimate ISO casts?
bro rlly said bulletproof
Ult brings you to a gulag.
his ult became mordekaiser
so his ulti is literally a domain expansion. bruh
Ok that agent will be my new main
his ult is basically a domain expansion 🤣🤣
havent seen anyone mention it, when you win in his ult, iso gets an energy orb (e) to shoot to be safe coming out of the ult, you can see it above the raze dying.
THEY ADDED A DOMAIN EXPANSION?
winning the ult 1v1 gives you the first ult point to your next ult (from the pros testing vids)
morde ult in valorant lmao
Damn, you have to have a lot of confidence to use his ult. I wonder if it silences the enemies, otherwise if you pull in like a Yoru or Phoenix they'll just flash you and possibly have an advantage.  Edit: Oh they have KAY/O silence on them for sure.
All the utils great except for the ULT. they just added some animations 1v1 and still not helping the user get a proper advantage
Definitely the most unique agent next to Astra and yoru. I like it but I'm sure his bullet deflect thing will get nerfed
This is just skill diff! The agent force you to get on a duel
he is trash💀💀💀
bro just used domain expansion lite
"Modekaiser has join the match"
This seems absurdly strong
jujutsu kaisen X Valorant💀💀💀
what in the fuck
Me using his ult knowing my aim sucks
Shit ult
reality:- idc about this agent i care about the upcoming battlepass guns are insane and knife also looks good
This man has a domain expansion 💀💀💀💀💀💀
That why he called "Wizard Bulletproof"
Ult is just an instakill with a little bit of crossair placement
Bros ult is basically domain expansion
Brawl stats Cordelius :v
le me doing a knife fight in the ult
How does the out effect time, can you use it to stall?
My guy has a mordekaiser ultimate (idk why he is chinese, he should be brazilian bc of that ult)
UNIQUE FROM ANY OTHER AGENT
he is too broken, he is gonna get nerfed soo much...... in pro play games are totally gonna be based on him just like when chamber was not nerfed.... that infinite damage taker one was totally broken... you can literally take your time to aim at head if you get into 1v2....
Main issue with ult is, when its 1v2, 1v3, or more you. Lose, like mordekaiser in LOL, where enemy can just wait for you to return on the same spot you use your ult
try for how long you can stay in the ult
Aimlab Training bouta go crazy
Ok now i belive riot can make a broken game seem like it was not
Bro has a. Domain expansion 😮
ISO : Ryoiki tenkai 🤞
so he is basically  reyna 2.0. nice!!!!!!!
this agent basically doesn’t let any sniper do their jobs
Better than deadlock and more awesome and very unique abilities
So if your aim is cracked you can use this agent otherwise you are not gonna get optimal valu out of it noted
Imagine always losing the 1v1 in his ult lol. I can see this as a more powerful way to remove a person off a site to allow the team to push and if the enemy spawns back theyll be in enemy territory.
This agent could be broken on release.
i expected more of a aggressive duelist like neon and raze, i also considered an op agent since they did just nerf jett,, i though he could use his bulletproof like a dash and use that effect to op and when he misses he doesnt die cuz of his "bulletproof".
[ Level Up ] Ultimate Unlocked : Domain Expansion
This ultimate is like the teritorial expension in jujutsu kaisen, that is sick 🔥
Iso out here using Domain Expansion
Domain Expansion 😎
His ultimate is just to isolate specific targets like a Killjoy or Viper and Isolate them WITH a chance to kill them BUT I will see a lot of ISO dying in their ultimates unfortunately a lot of players(ME) have skill issue.
bro has domain expansion
Literally Mordekaiser ult on valorant lmao but it looks really dope, never expected that
wtf the ult is busted, nerf chamber
Nerfed by 2 weeks for sure
yo with this ult in a 1v1 , u can stop a diffuse by using the ult
jjk reference HSAHAHA
What does fragile do?
Bro thinks he's mordekaiser
He’s gonna be fun with infinite abilitys
This agent  🤣🤣🤣🤣
okay so this dude is literally gojo bruh
im not tryna complain but i feel like riot got really lazy with their visuals this release, the wall and ult feel really rushed graphics wise which kind of ruins the vibe imo
I'm scared of his ult  I'm going no where close to him
but when the ult ends, u can easily kill him afterwards right? like the phoenix ult
It is like gojo infinite void 😅😅
is it just me or does the ult feel like a domain expansion
This is going to be my new main
Hystori repeates emo asian boy is the most WTF character in game. Riot you never disapoint.😊
L agent... they picked up all the  weak abilities of Harbor, Reyna and KJ... Not a meta shifting agent at all... will be fun to play like Reyna in low lobbies... Unique ULT though...
He seems very strong
FPS drops after this broski gonna release 📈📈📈
wtf, this guy ult is ryouiki tenkai 😳
no freaking way anyone would any possible way would expect his ult, i say its one of the best duelists after raze for now, he has hella potential to be used as team player and solo clutch agent
Imagine Playing 1v1 post plant with ult and you lose 1v1 and win round😂
Bro can literally do 1v1
i can already hear the brazil jokes
Imagine Playing 1v1 post plant with ult and you lose 1v1 and win round😂
What happens with the ult in a 1vX situation? Imagine 1v2 when you have planted, he takes you to his dimension, his mate just defuses meanwhile lol
Imagine losing the 1v1 in your ult, you're gonna get trash talked so bad xDD
BRO  HAS DOMAIN EXPANSION AS A ULTIMATE
Ah shit, they put Mordekaiser in Val
A duelist that really bring duel into it
Damn his ult is a domain expansion
The ult is domain expansion 😮
Domain Expansion
What if its the final 1v1 and no spike is planted, when the iso ults, and you both wait out the timer (i.e you both die) then who will win the round?
RYOURIKI TENKAI
Are we sure that the fragile affect the same as vunrable? Why did they not use the same word? Could this fragile effect be something new to the game?
They literally added domain expansion
that ult seems kinda stupid. All those ult orbs just to get 1 tapped in your domain expansion
i dont think u can make a agent better than jet. her dash is just to good of a ability no matter how much they nerf it. i think this agent will be played for a week than everyone will go back to reyna and jet
ISO players on their way to ult and suck at aiming so they lose that duel every time:
This guy looks wild tf
This is crazy!
His wall is literally newcastle from apex
Look like the agent is from anime😈
MORDEKAISER 😭😭😭😭
Wow. Upgraded harbour wall Upgraded reyna dismiss  Supression almost equal to kayo knife and most importantly..... 1v1 texas downtown diner ultimate
Does his ult have a timer? or are both there until someone dies
Bro's got his own Domain Expansion
3rd person perspective of ult , iso remains in the map , vulnerable or invulnerable ? , teammate can whether help or not to escape his ult like that when in deadlock ult, double tap shield will tank only first damage by brim ult and mollys which give damage time based
Domain expansion...
Domain expansion :kill contract
domain expantion
If I have to say one thing about this agent it will be his ult which is weird and uselss. Riot is totally making it like overwatch , I mean why would they put a ability (ultimate) which only helps himself not the team . Its like reyna ult but with reyna ult we can get rounds easily but this ult its something else ?
basically    DOMAIN EXPANSION
I like how with his ulti in a 2v1 or 2v2 you can give your partner a bit of breathing space to either plant or defuse ( temporarily at least)
This is just a shit agent, I am only looking for if we can create a real life ball like his ult where we can play the outdoor games with same time and measurement will be amazing.
when Iso hits his ULT, what weapon he & his opponent have? will it be from the same ones they have in that round(this will has disatvange to the opponent) or they both have the same wep?
Val really just added Demain Expension
its a guy?    bruh
Iso's ult is literally domain expansion bruh
They added Domain Expansion???
Toxic insta lock Jett in chat: haha look at iso diff bottom frag all he do is die to my op. Iso when he gets his ult: Welcome to the shadow realm Jimbo. Jett: chuckles, i am in danger
I think the devs loved jjk and said lets make the ult a domain expansion and for legal purposes make it not guaranteed
That ult is so dope. Send a dude to the shadow realm and 1 v1.
Bruh, its the mord ult except its in the Gulag
They gave MF A DOMAIN EXPANSION
This agent looks interesting and pretty original props to mone- i mean riot Edit: see if you can use bullet proof in the ult cuz this would be insane!
I didn't understand Q ability please someone explain
That ult is absolutely crazy. But i feel like his other abilities are very situational and might be pretty weak.
crazyy'
Bro can do domain expansions with his ult
Wtf is this agent
now the bottom fragger toxic reyna can have 1v1 in a compy match
As an Asc3 player I can safely say that this champ is gonna be in the trash before they rework him tbh. First let's talk about his signature, invulnerable and can shoot at the same time sounds op but in reality you need to be extremely good to flick that high, then lower it down to keep shooting. His vulnerable-omen-like-ability and bulletproof wall is just... meh, they are just way too underwhelm compared to other initiator/controller for sure. And his Ult, basically you force them to duel with you, which create 2 disadvantage, the first is your team lost a player to entry, the second is IT'S LITERALLY JUST AN AIM DUEL, which means you can't use it on eco round , I mean ANY other duelist ult is more beneficial than this
It's like mordkeisers ult
Can't wait to see more instalocking
iso seems broken af wth
Yo the 1 one is op it mean tgat you bassically make vandal useless and phantom will just be suppior bc is 1v1 it depend on the fire rate thus making odin or phantom the best counter
I somewhat called it from Kanga's recent videos about the "bulletproof" ability that itll be in way a deployable shield much like in Overwatch shields by Sigma/Rein or Dva. Though i thought itd be transparent but close enough.
Is Iso's developer a Jujutsu Kaisen's fan? That's a "Domain Expansion" 🤣
His ult is literally a Domain Expansion I’m crying 😭😭
Les go we agent 47 in valorant yay
New main????
hes not going to be very good imo. all his abilities lack to provide value in most cases.
Blud got a domain expansion
0:06 Double Tap (E) 0:47 Contingency (C) 1:08 Undercut (Q) 1:32 Kill Contract (X)
that's gotta be one of the most useless ults I've ever seen
'I'm SENDING YOU TO CHINA!!"
crazy
so cool
his ult is just like domain expansion 💀
domain expansion: QUICK DRAW
How does it decide who it takes when 2 people are in the zone for the ult?
bro really got a whole domain expansion as an ult
wtf, domain expansion in valorant???
Actually getting a free finisher with this agent's ult😂
wow another agent that will be played for a month and then never touched again
his ult feels like im watching him using his domain expansion🤣🤣🤣jjk is hype man lol
E and ultimate are broken combo if you manage to kill 1 its a garantee 2 kill when you ult you have the e activated and then another e when out the of the ult if you win, in theory you can fight 1vs 3 much "easier". I wonder if the ult needs to be in sight otherwise you can isolate one while being safe (no E ) after you kill.
Let the cycle of "he needs to be nerved" before release and "he is actually shit" after release begin.
welcome to the gulag
Not that fun man i'll just instalock reyna.
his ult is just the gulag lmao
bro has a domain expansion
hehe i am gonna stick the spike  Iso : let me show you smth new
needing to shoot the orb makes him so bad
his ult is domain expansion ?
The ultimate is really cool.
Ult is a domain expansion
Bro his ult is a domain expansion lmaooo
Bro be taking his enemies to his Domain Expansion lol
ISO GANGGG ISO GANG ISO GANG
This ult is gulag of valorant!!! Ppl knows knows!!!
cant wait to pop a domain expansion
DOMAIN EXPANSION💀
mordekister light
domain expansion
finally, i can play mordekaiser on league as well
i can't wait for my teammates to pull an enemy into an alternative dimension/world just so i can witness them miss every shot with an odin
not hes ultimate just being a domain expanstion.
Ulti broken!
Bro pulls up a domain expansion
He is the most skilled agent  other then yoru bruh
DOMAIN EXPANSION FOR HIS ULT?????
ultimates literally Gulag
Gulag ult
TF this is so f*ing cool, I can't wait to use him
so his ult is domain expansion, i kinda love this new agent and will try to main him
He really hit the Domain Expansion 1:38 , Crazy. Jujustu Kaisen fr global 😭😭😭
ISO ult be like: welcome to the gulag
damn they added domain expansion
The ult lools like a domain expansion from jjk.
E skill ability boutta be nerfed no cap
That to op
Shit gon be embarrassing when you confidently use your ult on someone only to lose the the 1v1
Dumb ult.   Seems like more an initiator than a Deulist.
Ngl the ult can be used to isolate the smurf from the whole team and just survive until the ult dissipates lmao
first
Bro fucking domain expansioned on raze
That ult is gonna destory my laptop and fps 👍🏽🫠
In the ult, do u have both the same weapon ?
Bro literally said domain expansion
Ult like domain expansion xDDD
BRO HE CASTS DOMAIN EXPANSION
I can already imagine The instalock smurfing iso dumping all his util on the iron sage just to get 1 kill
sounds like fun
Broken AGENT
domain expansion
Brazil isn't real, it can't hurt you. Brazil:
op
the ultimate is just too funny xd i hope if u ult one more than one ennmy you will be in an arena with all of them
Bro literally has Domain Expansion
bro using domain expansion
I have a question. If you die inside Iso's ultimate, do you die or not?
The ult it's like a goddamn domain expansion 😮
thye basically gave this mf a domain expansion from jjk
kanga can you pls ask dead lock to be my girlfriend thanks
shield ability feels a bit underpowered since you have to shoot before getting the shield, meaning you have to re-adjust your aim. Although it depends on how long the shield lasts though.  Aimlabs in Valo tho
That ult is fuckin cool as hell man
FIRST!
bro legit has a domain expansion 💀
what if u gets killed in ult? will u respawn like phoenix or just dead completely?
ult is literally a JJK domain expansion
Ok now nref new agent
not sure if I like the ultimate, it's kinda to much
This character is kinda lame tbh his abilities are unoriginal and since hes a duelist i cant see how he can take space. I feel like hes gonna be another deadlock
Ryōiki Tenkai
what in the mordekaiser ult
They said the new agent have an ability that people don't expect to be on the game. They said a year ago that they wont make shield as an ability
Domain Expansion in Valorant???
They took "1v1 me n00b" and made it an ult
I don't know how I feel about his signature having two charges, and each having such a longer timer (I think they should not be as long as they are) but he seems strong but not busted but he can def give Reyna a run for her money I feel.
Nice
Domain expansion
His E reminds me of Draven.
He'll be a really cool agent to farm kills on Sheriff.
valorant agent with overwatch abilities. They promised no overwatch tank like gameplay when it release, now they are one step closer to breaking that
Is it just me or whenever you r in the ult, you should just have a knife fight only?
This agent is introduction of  power creep in valorant
E ability will be OP af ability, trust me 💯💯💯
goated agent
VALORANT just straight up copied Domain Expansion and added it in the game.
hmm sounds broken to me...
everyone always says that new agents abilities are op but  these actually are wtf
Domain expansion 😂
My fps during his ult💀
Domain Expansion 💀💀
why no comments? this character is crazy good
wow they did it, they found a way to make this game suck even more!!!!!!!!!
His ult is like Domain Expansion.
Ult: Domain Expansion
his ult is truly my favorite isis ability
Actually I never expected riot to bring this game changing agent man, honestly he feels more of controller cum initiator but dude he is broken.
Bros ult is a Domain Expansion 💀
the ult is just domain expansion from jjk anime pretty cool
I like they add more agents like Reyna but more useful, specially you don't actually has to kill enemy to use half of your util
What if enemy has to defuse spike and iso ult and take them to (GULAK) and just waste time there😮
sukuna is that you?
DOMAIN EXPANSION 😾
if i remember right he meant to be a dualist but 2/4 of his ability is basically support moves. So, i think he will probably play the role of a second dualist or work as a psuedo ini
That ultimate is crazy
Bros ult is a whole domain expansion 💀
so basically deadlock but slightly better nice....
Uhm how can I NOT main this character???
this is literally domain expansion
Yoru's ULT goes to another dimension. But this guy's ULT takes you to HIS dimension. This is so op
Now when you get shit on, you don't need to invite the opponents for an 1v1 to show your supremacy. Now you can do it in the same game 🤣🤣.
After he ults i think he gets a stack of double tap which lets him survive a hit after he exits it into open combat
With the ult i remember a childhood Series of babyblade that fights in other dimension loved it ❤, but ya if ur aim is not good his ult wasted 😅
That ult worries me cuz either team could flood the location and kill the winner especially if your spot stays the same beginning of the ult. They’ll have info on them and they can’t rlly fight back.  Also could the single shields stack?? Since it seems it’s like a mini Reyna ult meaning maybe they could get multiple shields. And how long to the sheild orbs last? What if the person is killed in a small corridor?
The Abilities of ISO is too awesome and especially his Ult that makes a 1on1 battle with the enemy and i love it
Tbh iso seem to be quite op overall
I wanted to know something..... Does his "double tap" Make him. Survive deadlock ult?
Lmfao so that's what that is in his trailer, I thought it was just for show but its literally his ult domain expansion
i wonder if you can pop flash through the contingency wall? or is it a solid wall where flashes have to go around
damn, imagine trying to hold down the site as kj then u hear “welcome to the gulag”
true duelist lol
Definitely meta changing agent unlike deadlock Imagine the 1v1 moment with his ult in any T1 event
Mordekaiser ult
Iso's E ability would be op in high elo if ypur a good shot
well time to pratice aim labs to shoot in the ability
Arena is like domain expansion
seems like he's gonna be nerfed hard
ult is Gojo's domain expansion lol
Wtf the ult is so useless and usefull
op as hell
Ult is just straight up domain expansion
The fact that you get to tank a hit from a bullet or projectile is pretty broken in the cost of getting kills
His ult sends you to brazil, crazy
DOMAIN EXPANSION DUEL
that ult is crazy
BRO THAT ULT IS INSANE
His C ability was supposed to be harbors ability!!!! BRUH!!!!! I don't know why my man Harbor don't have bulletproof walls despite shown in the trailer man!!!!!!!
I can already see the signature ability nerfed shorter and maybe even just 1 instead of 2 should it prove to be too powerful. I wonder what the range of the ULT is though. Like imagine readying ur lineup waiting for that tap and instead get pulled into a 1v1.
omgggg this looks soooo oppppp
DOMAIN EXPANSION
His ult would be very useful for a 1v1 post plant. Time ticks down and suddenly they cant tap the spike because they're in a different dimension with you. Good time killer at the very least
They actually added domain expansion
hes broken imo
He's ult kinda reminds me of gulag from cod
how does it look lite when he uses his ult?
HIS ULT IS LITERALLY THE GULAG
the ult is unique but i has to be buffed if its all that is cause all the other alts give overwhelming advantage while iso just forces enemies into 1v1
That ults a whole domain expansion
im quiting valorant
also the moving wall will be really helpful for places like haven,
Bro has domain expansion
MORDEKAISER ULT HAHA
Bro literally has Domain Expansion for his ult like the jjk sorcerers
that ultimate will be funny to use against lineup players, ur teammates can defuse while you put pressure on the
the great-aim-people are gonna have a blast with this one 🙏
HUH
An Ult ability which is worth getting and just makes the game really adventurous
Okay my question is since iso can tank damage does it tank the “effects” as long as the effect deals damage like, a cypher trip deals 5 damage so can he just ignore the concuss or the trip as long as its active?
1:38 Bro has a whole domain expansion
Ngl, I almost feel like the teasers were misleading about his abilities. Kit looks alright.
this is huge. His E ability can basically give u a free site entry if u are against an op or any 1 hit kill scenario. His C ability is basically Harbor's wall, smaller but impenetrable. His Q ability is very good to help jett enter the site or basically gives u double chance of successful site entry. No need to mention his X which can literally make u feel like u're playing RDR2. Love him!
wtf is that ult lmfao
Is it me or did they reskin the sheriff?
Bro using Domain expansion
Bro it's ult looks like domain expansion from jjk
iso really said Domain expansion!
The flow state is pretty op from lurk kills since you basically tap the heads most of the time
i don't see his kit in pro scene.
that was fast
So his ult is like chambers if u have skill u kill if you dont u get killed
Basically this character is unusable if ur aim sucks
i wonder what others will see when we are in the 1v1 state, his E is kinda intresting, like if we are in the damage proof state, will we neglect brims whole ult or just 1 tick, same with grenades which damages per tick, like brims molly
Looks pretty weak the only good Ability is E
So this agent really relies on aim and good flicking
To be honest, we should've predicted his Vulnerable ability. It's the only effect in the game that hasn't had it's own stand alond ability. Omen's paranoia nearsights, Gecko's trash detains, Harbor's cascade slows and ect
the new reyna
This is insane, It does have some good counterplay of teamplay though.
epic, cant wait!
Imagine having a bad day with a potato aim and you accidentally ulted the enemy topfrag
Another 0%pickrate agent. Raw aim and that's it. No flash, no dive. Wtf.
The new agent now can use domain expansion ⛩⛩😳
i am an iso main
is ult should be called domain expansion
They just copied concept from Jujutsu Kaisen
domain expension
The ult is literally Domain Expansion
Not even 10 seconds in and I'm already confused
deadlocks ult is a guaranteed kill as long as you hit them correctly while iso's is a 50/50 or who ever has the best aim. ULT looks sick but it really doesnt give you any advantage over your opposition.
I can already smell the nerf
his ult is amazing, however you need to have GOOD AIM to win on that ULT
DOMAIN EXPANSION
the 1v1 ult is just insane, it will help smurfs easy clutch 1v1
Hi is overpowered
damn that ult
Time to ditch valorant
Literal Domain Expansion
I can already feel huge amounts of nerfs coming lol
i fr think that iso is gonna be nerfed in the second week of public release ngl
his ult takes them to the Gulag LMAO
So he can nullify damage, block damage, and double damage. On top of a duel minigame to isolate fights. It seems a little powerful.
now this is fuckign insane
I love him
when in iso arena....will they both (iso and the enemy) will be dissapeared for everyone else in the map?
Very cool
bro he is super hot , his abilties is insane ! what else is left bruhhhhhh
this guy seems so good with the judge
Man's got a Domain Expansion
nice vid, idk what to think of this agent im pretty skeptical bout his abilities
so basically you play aimlabs mid game and his ult is playing in gulag
One thing i want to ask is will the ult only hit its opponent when they are in the ult's line of site or no matter where they are hiding if they are in range of it the ult will get them.
edgy mordekaiser
Chamber hates him 😂
Why you need aimlab when you have this guy
Domain expansion
similar to reyna for example his ult its like reynas u need to get a kill to actually make some use of ur ult nothing broken tho i wonder if the utility can go through that shield
a whole new meaning to "1v1 me"
my fav habilitie of his it´s the way he looks 🫠🫠🫠
Seems pretty bad tbh
Domain expansion
The ult is so sick def new main
His ult gives your opponent a 50 50 chance to guess behind which shield are you, hence increasing your chance of winning the duel.
My 1st theory for him was that he will have wall just like his C ability, but I knew he'll be duelist, so I scraped that idea. But i'm still happy for it, because it's so much better than having abother flash.
NEW MAIN
They put the best part of call of duty which is gunfight into valo and that's fabulous
Jesus  This is awesome!
i think the only nerf he gets is w his double tap and the length unless theres a but i dont see anything too crazy w iso
U cant cobtrol his wall, and keeoh posted a video showing his gameplay
I Wonder if iso dies in his ult if he dies in the game or not
He has a domain expansion 🤣
This guy is the gojo satoru of valorant because he can cast a domain expansion
Plat chat was right
Im maining him
Looking balanced tbh
wait why he kinda-
Ult is underwhelming ngl hope it is better in game
Bro said enter the gulag 💀
first
New main ngl
THANKS KANGA
First view💪
