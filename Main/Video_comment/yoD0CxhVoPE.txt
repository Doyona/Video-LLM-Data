Man it was great when this song came out, still great today
0:50 That dog looks like it's part of the carpet
I love the ttte version
Lyrics:  (Drums) (Music)  Oh, in my head!   You said with certainty,  I may be the dumbest person that you've ever seen.  You think you're hurting me?  Betcha won't believe, but you kinda set me free.   (Trumpet)  You've mentioned Adderall,  Slip this guy a sedative, he's bouncing off the wall.  Honey, it's no big deal,  We'll get you back to college, you can study something real.   So if that's how you feel...  When we go down!  When kingdom come!  Don't look at me, don't look at me, I'm just too dumb!  I'd love to stay! (Love to stay!) But like you said! (Like you said!) Don't look at me, 'cause I got nothing in my head!   Oh, in my head!   Too dumb for breaking up.  I'd do it in person, but I'd probably mess it up.  I'll text you "that's enough,"  That's how empty-head people get through sitty stuff.   (Trumpet)  Your world is ending soon,  Mine's a little better 'cause I never watch the news.  You'll make my lunch today.  I would do it, but I couldn't work my microwave.   So if that's what you're saying...  When we go down!  When kingdom come!  Don't look at me, don't look at me, I'm just too dumb!  I'd love to stay! (Love to stay!) But like you said! (Like you said!) Don't look at me, 'cause I got nothing in my head!   Oh, in my head!   (Piano)  *You should not have done that!*  (Drums) (Da-da-da-da-da-da! Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da! Da-da-da-da!)(2x)  When we go down! (We go down!) When kingdom come! (Kingdom come!) Don't look at me, don't look at me, I'm much too dumb!  I'd love to stay! (Love to stay!) But like you said! (Like you said!) Don't look at me 'cause I got nothing in my head!   Oh, in my head!  Oh, IN MY HEAD!   When we go down...  When kingdom come...  Don't look at me, don't look at me, I'm much too dumb.
for a dumb song, they sure took their time thinking about it XD   I love this song
still good
I'm just smiling right now. For all your incredibly relatable songs which by the way I even used for an english oral that's graded. Thank you. You're the best
Can't stop listening to it......
The fact this was put on my for you page 2 years (almost 3 now probably) shows how peak and good this song is (as well as all of their other music)
i luv the way AJR put this together with bts included, makes it more fun and realistic
I love it
I love all your songs and the big goodbye
Who doesn’t love AJR but seriously I’m like their biggest fan🎉
This song is a banger ‼️ I am a big fan, I’ve been with u for years Thank you🎉
October 2025 🙋🏻
you cant tell me this wasnt inspired by the adults are talking..
The best feel good song out right now.
Can you guys use an acoustic bass
Thanks recroom for me to find this
Best part right here 3:02 ✋🏻😐🤚🏻

Hi, guys.  Thank you so much for always being here. I did it... I stayed alive
😍🥰🤩
Its like better than any song cuz it shows the way they made the song and not just a guy singing
It is such a good song! I absolutely love it, and so does my best friend. Definitely worth the year and a half!
3:08 😂😂😂
Ok, good for u
2:35 he does the middle finger…
Jack looks actually so stupid
This is low-key fire
AJR always drops a song that allows me to make it through a difficult grieving period. This time it was my soul mate my little sister. She is everything in this universe and song makes me feel like she is okay. I’ll see her again ❤❤❤❤
As an adhder, I love this song
Men only want one thing and it's disgusting(?):
Teamwork turns obstacles into stepping stones. 🌟🙌 LOVE THE SONG.
1:50 it’s the bummer land suit!!!

Brother1: I am thinking something dumb. Brother2: Is it about a song❓ Brother3: Don't Look at me, I got nothing.  Lets guess the Brother😁😜
Worth waiting 2 years
@2:32
I wish they would make more videos of making the song
I. Love this song for so. Long
dro cool
Ive seen this alot and i still dont understand the cut right before lizzies part
3:00 you should not have done that😂
I'd make a comment on how good it sounds and how cool getting to see the entire process was, but I'm much to dumb to write a clever one.
🎉
Good song bless you your amazing
Everyone's dumb sometimes it's ok to be dumb and your not dumb your smart keep up the good work
3:38 you guys play wii sports?
Can someone please make an edit that doesn’t have any of the back noises, but has the acapella part at the end. PLEASE, and thank you.
Did you guys know you are my favorite band ? Bet you don’t know, until now !!
I find it interesting that these guys can write the most emotional, sad songs under the sun, and yet somehow seem this happy... I cant make up my mind (love this song though!!)
Jack looks so strange without his hat.
i love this song idk why they hating on your music❤
AJR is so fcking underrated! FR
We love ajr
Ajr, wow, not so!
I don't know what I love more. The song or the video 😊❤
AJR is oneof those channels that combine everyday youtubers with youtube song makers
happy pride month!!!!!
3:10 XD
0:17
1:07 why does jack look concerned lol
🙃🙂🙃🙂🙃🙂
I love ajr❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I love how AJR's music can both be seen as such a happy and glad tone, but can also be taken in a beautifully emotional way too .
Sometimes I wish I was that happy even when I feel so down.
Exactly the song to blast when your mom is getting on to you about your grades.
probably the greatest song ever
İt is so good
Era un niño de un país con una guerra vi morir a mi abuelo vi como se destruía mi país por una guerra me destacaba en los deportes pero en el deporte más destacado era el fútbol me metí a un equipo que vieron mi potencial quise irme a otro equipo pero me rechazaron por mi físico después participe en el equipo de mi país el equipo que me había rechazado vio el grande problema que hizo al rechazar me después de un tiempo jugué en el Tottenham jugué hasta contra el Manchester United que estaba cristiano Ronaldo después de unos años al año 2012 llegue al Real Madrid Llegué Tapando Vergüenzas pero termine metiendo gol y gol y gol consecutivos vi como todos mis compañeros se retiraban o se iban del club me quedé solo con 3 de mis ex compañeros hasta el 24 de Mayo de 2025 días ya no pude renombrar mi contrato con Real Madrid Y Días después di mi último baile y también fui el tapa vergüenzas del equipo pero me fui como leyenda y tape bocas mi nombre es ¡¡¡LUKA MODRIĆ!!!!!
This song has an early 2000s vibe
May 2025 anyone ❤
I love how authentic they boys are with everything they do! ❤
Sound is poor
The time it took to make this was not for nothing this is a masterpiece
Win
its amazing but can you tour in vic Australia
Greatest revelation in this song is seeing AJR playing Wii Sports Resort. Who won that Table Tennis match, I have to know.
I remember waiting for this song to come out, cannot believe it's been 2 years.. Your music really helped me through hard times. Thank you.
This song and video genuinely brings me so much joy whenever I watch/listen to it 😄
By far my favorite artists
😂😂😂😂❤❤❤❤❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love AJR and this song and yes I am a mess
AJR, you may not know me by name, but I want you to know that you're one of my biggest inspirations for making my own music, and one day I dream to be on a stage having fun like you did. Thank you.
This is the perfect music video
their best music video
この曲が1番好き！
I remember listening to this during summer school, as I was forced to go after failing math
It’s my birthday, again, and here I am, listening to this, 2 years after making that other comment on my birthday. Time flies like crazy. This song and TMM helped me through the toughest time of my life. I love this song and I love AJR! ❤😊
I love AJR so much, seeing these videos makes me appreciate what they do so much more. I love how AJR seems like REAL people, and they just seem so positive and that’s why I love their music 🫶🫶
Would it sound better if he said   Don’t look at me don’t look at me don’t look at me
I love AJR and that was the happiest story I've ever heard
this is my favorite ajr song, its weirdly relatable and also gives lightbulb vibes kinda
Happy 2 years to the dumb song 🎊❤ This song means so much to me and helped me through very very tough times with kidney stones and 2 surgeries at a young age, if it wasn't for this song and for AJR I generally don't know what would of happened to me so thank you so much for everything you do for us, more songs to come and TMM Deluxe! <33
da da da da da da
2 days until it’s 2 year anniversary. This song is one of my favorites, if not my favorite song of theirs and I just absolutely love the work that’s put into these songs. I love you guys. ❤😊
1:56 is good
HEAAAAd
MY
OH
looking at Ryan from the scooter..
bap bede bap bede bap bede bap bap.
I love this song! It gives some great summer vibes and has great lyrics!
This song describes me
❤
Ajr what are your real names
Cg5😭😭😭😭😭😭😭🥳🥳😭
Gotta love the quick snap shot of Nintendo table tennis towards the end. All this work, even conscripting the child for the voice line and now its time for table tennis sitting on the couch xD wish i had friends anywhere near as chill as you guys.
I love the style of how the music was made and I much preferer it to still pictures or other music vids
Listening to AJR is the only thing that makes me forget about Monday mornings
Best song I have heard ❤❤❤
I’ve never done much in terms of music. But when I decide to try anyway, knowing it’s bad? It’s because I heard a song by AJR.
I'm just sorting by new and seeing how fucked up the comments are.
Could I interest anyone with a cheese sandwich in these trying times?
AJR I am your biggest fan
I went to the concert it was sick as hell and very awesome
ajr i love it the music
anyone in 2025？
So relatable 😭😭😭😭😭
AJR is my main inspiration for doing art. Thinking of doing one for Touchy Feely Fool!
This is not just a song but a way of life
this song goes unbelievably hard 🔥
Its been a while since I've listened to AJR. I'm glad I'm back to listen to your dumb songs again.
Am I the only one that’s getting a stores near you thing and it’s a little Cesar’s
I love your song's ajr! your the best
❤❤❤❤
Good ole martin
Why adam is only in %25 of the video
March 2025? Anyone?
Nice
Anyone 2025?
i love that this have notes of their previous song like in 0:55 it has the melody of Christmas in June!
The fact that they let a tone deaf person sing in this is incredible, love you guys
This completely changed my perspective on being called dumb or stupid.
この曲が大好きです！
I love this song, bc for me it means i can do stupid shit and do dumb stuff, and if i fail than i fail, the world won't end just because im not perfect, and this song can be seen as self depreacting but for me its reassuring. "Bet you wont believe it, but you kinda set me free"
Love this song! :3❤
people keep saying that AJR fell off- i call bullshit
hey ajr i am am a big fam and in 2023 in april or july i loved it
This song describes my exact thinking mentality
This is pretty dumb in a good way
big fan
Martin looks like and older cavetown
Amazing song I listen to it while I study, workout,paint and when I wanna cheer up!
The Dumb Song, my beloved
How this is under 10m views
Good song

Perfect soundtrack for [INSERT]
Have to say Chloe really helps me find my smile when im feeling down. Love AJR to death but that little girl has a lot more pull on my heart...might be bc im a girl mom 🤷‍♀️
Just got my cast off today and on the way there and back from the hospital I listened to them and now there songs are suck in my head and I'm so glad
That one time when the Beetles made four songs in 2 weeks
2025 anyone?
Any one here 2025 January
Who is listening in 3076
listening to this before 2025
I like ajr. A group of guys just making mine and probably others days. I hope someday I could go to an ajr concert or something. ...
for the first time in 17 years? so they could afford a studio outside of their bedroom when they were 14, 9, & 5 lmao
You are the best of my life
1:40 Isn’t that the suit from Bummerland?
I love how AJR stays true to themselves.
Probably will tell my grandkids about this
the song tells the story
I'm left on one brain cell RN
🦵.
AJR is actually underrated. Artists with soul, a vision, a story and wisdom to share.
Raise your hand if your watching this before 2025

1:02 Ryan: hellllllooooooooooo 😂
CHLOE IS MY BESTIE BRO
I can't believe Jack doesn't wear his hat at home, I thought those two were inseparable.
If you want to know what singers do in their free time, this video explains it all🤣😆.
Please PLEASE make more of these behind the scene It gives such a bigger appreciation for the song! Good Job guys
I am so dumb that if I’m trapped in this melody of music I think it will give me  freedom
For some reason,this song made me found my happiness thank you guy!!!
Four words   This song is cool
Alternative tittle: Some days in our life.
It's impressive, so much love and effort to produce a song ❤
Well done boys
I don’t know how people could hate AJR❤ he’s my big inspiration 😌
It actually makes me sad that this was a year ago.. Its felt like weeks..
If you perform in Albuquerque New Mexico you may perform in popjoy hall in UNM
Please please please!!! Perform in Albuquerque New Mexico😢
love the music that they make
Nice
imagine spending a year and a half to make a song and calling it dumb lolol
gl they should've done an actual music video, what a dumb song
1:14 the best part 🤌🤌🤌🤌
Can’t come up with a smart thing to say cus u got nothing in my head
The dumb song is the best song after World's Smallest Violin ❤
I love how these guys know how to have a fun time and show it in their music :3
“Listen to this song, its a no brainer”
Jacks ski suit looks like the jumpsuit he wears in bummer land
I remember when this came out this was a VERY GOOD SONG and still is this also was released on my birthday
I went to your foncert
Please do a concert in Green Bay at the Packer stadium❤
3:36 Casually plays Wii sports
Making songs while being part and several other things happening and still producing an amazing song is truly a talent
Me: *writes a song and wonders why it sounds like trash  *listens to AJR  Me: THATS WHY  Edit: this is because my music wasn’t unique enough. Not saying AJR is trash, they are freaking amazing. I am trash 🗑️
What’s the dogs name
Bro all the Random people that just spawns mid song lol
Dude this fills me with so much inspiration <3
This is far too much time for just a freaking song that it is not that good anyway... but for the sake of the history and video, good job
3:06 put subtitles lol
The intro at the beginning of this video is pure bliss
Such a fun song to spend a year on ❤
dude said "$50 is too expensive to make a music video"
Who is the best at wii sports?
this is such an endearing video to go with this song i love it~<3
the dogging on martin sent me lol, i love this song so much it was certainly a labor of love <3
445677th time I’m listening to this
why am I back to a shoe💀💀
I Feel So Dumb
I watched this with no expectations and was blown away
my sis loves yall
My friend is Chloe she goes to my school she is from New York and actually is the same person
Chloe's my cousin!!! On my life.
Remember me I was that shoe
remember be I was  that shoe
remember be I was  that shoe
remember be I was  that shoe
This is my favorite AJR song ever, it makes me feel so much better about not being at the top for everything I do and just appreciating my own abilities the way they are ♥️♥️
Awesome song I loved that so much
Don't like this comment I'm just too dumb
Only people that went to his concert in chigaco last week can like
Found you guys like a week ago. You have seriously skyrocketed to one of my all time favorite bands. I´ve never encoutered my feelings being put into words so beautifully, feeling perfectly understood and at least during "two or three minutes then I´m gone" being a little less scared of the future, a bit more conscious about myself, and an ounce more brave to fight inertia but not away from it.
AJR if you see this please come to Australia and New Zealand again
The treasure is the friends we made along the way.
DADADA!! Ryan:ok that’s good-
2:50 . Thank me later
I'm dumber
New york is gonna be fire
AJR in real life, thanks for the vlog
AJR: let’s make a casual song with a bunch of people we know, it’d be fun Also AJR: *writes an angelic masterfully crafted piece of music*
i feel like adam is really left out
3:33  YELLOW TEETH
terrible ngl
Ajr
i to am too dumb so i feel you
Cuándo van a venir a Peru
Beatles vibes anyone?
this kinda sounds like a boywithuke song... kinda?
My favorite part  Chloe: "You should nooooot have done that!! 🤣
Im addicted now
it's amazing, like it's the best I've heard
This is my favorite song to listen to while I play Helldivers 2
good listening
Cookies!!! Yassssss
I cried after watching this video, this was frickin’ beautiful. 😭 I love AJR.
I wanna go to one of their concerts so baaaaaaaaaad 😭😭😭
It was the absolute BEST having you at Tampa Bay rays stadium! I lost my voice the next day! Haha
DA DA DDAA
THE GIRL IS SOO CUTEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!
Tone deaf means you don't like the song
wow, just wow
Ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof
I’m just going oover for my own money 💴 I guess I’m going with the one 1️⃣ to the right I have no choice to be there but I’m gonna have my mom 👩 and I will get you the other ones that are on your way back
Made in 2023 now it’s 2024
Bro this is so good but it’s so dumb, wait… ITS CALLED THE DUMB SONG BECAUSE ITS DUMB. 😂😂😂 ❤❤❤ ❤❤❤ ❤❤❤ Love you AJR (Adam, Jack, and Ryan).
The goat at music can’t wait to see you at omaha
It's not a dumb song it's a chaotic one
Is Martin actually tone deaf😅🤔
I wasn't expecting, Martin is tone-deaf.
I’m planning for my first concert to go to one of yours
Anyone else get Bluey vibes from this song lol
That one way to start off a video
...Wait... You mean to tell me that Jack's hat isn't growing out of his skull?
AJR is it's own genre of music
Comment you country name here 👇
Im listening this on my birthday, i lea e this coment wo when someome like it i get reminded. Great son AJR
This song made me go through an eighth-life crisis but it's a fucking banger 10/10
I love whow when Jack went skiing he was warring the suit from bummer land
This song specifically has been so special to me, like the songs actually so relatable with everything about it and it came out on my birthday which instantly makes this really special to me because of how much absolutely love these songs and the whole album
I thought the voice of the part "you should noooot have done that" was a clip from Sandy Cheecks from SpongeBob.
🥹🥹🥹 KEEP WORKING ON MUSIC 🎶
The i wont pool
The bumberland ski suit!!!
Bro flipped us of 2:36
Best trainsation ever
My face hurts from smiling non stop every time I listen to and watch this. This has gotta be my new number one feel good song.
The absence of this song from The Maybe Man Tour setlist will never be forgiven
I LOVE YOU AJR!!!!
I missed you guys when you came to my state! can you pls come back to minnesota?
1. Jacks ski outfit was from bummerland. 2. June 2022 was the Christmas in June official video concert.
I remember when i was practicing for my SATs, this song came out and I was a nervous wreck... This song came out and now that im in my first college year I hear this song, it relaxes me to a certain level that i dont worry anymore. I still use it when I have tests at my college, and still works! Thanks a lot for this song
Can someone tell me why see Adam 13 times??😂😂😂😂
I love to come back and listen to this song all the time!! It's just that good!
Half way back to land, Jack "oh crap we forgot tne cameraman"

This is my favourite AJR song, I like it so much to see the music video and found this masterpiece instead. I knew this song was something special. All the best
Happy one year anniversary! Such a great video and I'm so excited to see you guys in two weeks
Happy anniversary "The Dumb Song"! 🎉💗
Martin is tone deaf😂😂😂
AJR 🎉🎉
Happy anniversary to this song
Happy one year "The Dumb Song"🥳🥳🥳
This is a couple hours away from being a year old

I’m chloe
I like the amount of dogs in the video
This is honestly one of the best songs I have ever heard.
I Feel dumb watching this video
Did anybody notice that in Bummerland he wears the same ski outfit
Love this song
Poor Martin
anybody who glazes these mfs is stupid as hell fr shitty ass disney music
I loved  the song but I fell asleep since I have only gotton9 hrs of sleep this week
This is one of the greatest music videos ever, just behind TDJICFH.
Could you reach out it would be amazing or not it would help or meet in person
REALLY GOOD I’m happy to see them at the concert and thank you guys for amazing music this helps me a lot it also helped me go over some of my depression
Such a good song❤
your not the only one dude :))
AJR🏆
I like how they take their time making their music
Definitely going on my playlist
i know like 28 ajr songs
These guys are living my dream
This album is probably the best besides the click
사랑해요 ajr!!!!
This is so wholesome 😊
So worth the time!
This is Henley and I LOVE Ajr great song❤️
ssoo dumb
I am dumb so this fits me
The fucking goosebumps I got from that
Two years later Today
My b is October also love your music looking forward to more
I've just came across your music... love it have been listening to it all, will yous ever come to scotland?
Finally without the dumb hat.
This song is dumb 😅😂😊
i stay quirky chaotic adhd for this band
Amazing band! I just found y’all a week ago. Also, love the Wii gaming!😂
Am I the only one that pretends to play the drums at the beginning?
yep it's good to go!
Damn how old is AJR 17 years before their first studio that is a long time.
I just noticed Jack’s skiing outfit is the parachuting outfit he wears at the very beginning of the Bummerland music video
MORE ATTENCION FOR THIS SONG!!!!!
2:28 I love that! How there's friends and family included in small parts. It makes songs feel weirdly "home made" and i mean it technically kind of is but makes it feel more human and down to earth. I alsow like the energy in the girls voice ^^
Fire
ALL of AJR’s song’s are fire 🔥 It’s hard to choose but I think this is the one I resonate with most right now. Before I was diagnosed/treated for my brain tumor a month ago I had suffered for several years and when I heard the lyrics for the first time I felt like they were speaking for me. The type of tumor I had effected my expression/communication HUGE. I literally felt mute this past year as my symptoms progressed and I felt “dumb”. Constant criticism from “friends” and being dismissed by every doctor I seeked for help. I literally had nothing to say in my head and it was the scariest feeling, I remember sitting watching people converse and wondering what the hell was wrong with me that I couldn’t. I would put this song on at the bar and my friend and I would dance silly and ignore the eye rolls from people in the room that didn’t understand. Thank you AJR for being awesome and creating beautiful music. I have seen you guys play once so far and it was the absolute best show I’ve been to. The energy and talent you guys have is immense. I look forward to your Maybe Man tour and pray i’m feeling better after radiation so that I can attend. Anywho, thanks again if you ever see this, your songs have comforted me and inspired me in some of the loneliest times of my life ❤ I’ve started writing again since having this literal weight lifted out of my head and I sing too, maybe a collaboration someday? Lol would be DOPE
Well, you guys fkn nailed it!
every AJR song is my favorite song now It's top of my playlist and current obsession. then, finding out that I've actually been a fan of you guys for a while, but I just didn't know who was making my favorite sounds.
Who is here in 2030 😭
This is just dumb
the best song and brother band dosent exist
Chloe ate ngl
I agree
your songs give me a different vibe.
Listening to AJR from Colombia, recently discovered them and... damn, this song is pure art. All of their songs are pure art.
You just got to love how HAPPY they are when doing music.  They seem like a bunch of people EVERYONE would love to hang out with.

That was one of the coolest music videos I’ve ever seen. Great job guys ❤
Wow ajr is so good cg5 is inspired by them it’s insane
best ajr song
AWESOME !!!
Terrible music made for kids
i am a middle schooler with kabouke syndrome who is also blond. i have always known i am not the brightest person ever when it comes to math/school. i have benn called stupid/dumb by many people in my life. and it sucks to hear. i also love music! my mom did chorus as a kid, my  little sister is named after david bowie,my dad used to play in a rock band in high school and me and my little brother do chorus at school.safe to say,music runs in my family.i heard worlds smallest violen when it blew up on the radio.i am a pretty sensitive kid,so people insulting me hurts me in the heart.i have benn working on not caring what some rude 6th grader  that stays up till 2 am on the weekends to crank 90s on fortnite has to think. and my first step is just walking away. every time someone calls me dumb or stupid,i will think of this song,use a witty comeback( to the best of my ability)  and walk away. i also just love this song!
Hello? Hello, Hello? Uh, I wanted to record a message to help you get settled in on your first night. Um, I actually worked in that office before you. I'm finishing up my last week now, as a matter of fact. So, I know it can be a bit overwhelming, But I'm here to tell you there's nothing to worry about. Uh, you'll do fine. So, let's just focus on getting you through your first week, okay? (FINISH THE NEXT PART OF SCRIPT IN REPLIES! I WILL REPLY)
Anyone notice how fun this band is? And how Charlie Green commented?
ajr feels like home, thank you guys, thank yall for making my life better <3
Even though it took a year and a half, it was WAY worth it! This is honestly one of the best songs I have ever heard!!
i’m not a fan of ajr but this shit kinda bumps in the whip
I love how your neighbor said the “You should not of done that!” just so awesome.
😍😍😍❤❤❤
I love these videos so much! Seeing the creation and work behind the music is so incredible and awe-inspiring. I especially love how AJR chooses and mixes certain sounds and lines, like the "Na-na-na" part and the "You should noooot have done that!" It's similar to the part in "Bang!" with the "Here we go!" Something about those parts are so fun.
Indonesia sendiri?
"If I'm going down, I'm taking you with me!"
Ajr is the definition of "I've heard that song before but who's it from?" And then finding out it's the same band
Cg5 wow awesome  And great work AJR
I love this song 🥰
Just a banger theme song imo
It's called the dumb song but it's one of their best imo
If I were to describe this music then I would say this: “it sounds like if I were to actually be a little bit happy and I were to recap the year of 2023 in 4:03 minutes
Oh my gosh CG5!😮 You're inAJR😮
1st dumb anniversary soon edit: thx for the likes my comments dont get liked
Im so hook to your songs!!
I love AJR he’s my favorite singer. I listen to him every single time I get in the car to go to tennis practice. It’s just wherever I go like to listen.
The Song best me
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Jack Andy and Martin mix them together that's JAM
Listening to this song to start the year out strong. Cheers to 2024!! 🎉🎉🎉
Love the journey and being able to be a part of it, especially with Chloe's part! Lol ❤
A song for me
This is beautiful.
Seeing these artist doing what they love despite getting hate people by people who doesn't share the taste of music. They make music that they themselves enjoy including their fans. From what I discovered these fans have problems of their own, their music is what lift them, and the fans still welcome others with open arms. Its hard to see these fans being kind while people that slandered them.  The artist are loveable people including its adoring fans. Yet they're unbothered by the slander.
Just found this masterpiece in the middle of night. 😊
i always thought it was 'i mean, its no big deal'
I used alot of the tactics you guys use to write music for my own music thanks for all the great Songs as well
Ok
I hate new music but I love you guys and music like this is absolutely amazing and I love you you bring other people in to it 😃
One of my favorites from "The Maybe Man!"
I love CG5
I feel silly for not realising  Adam Jack Ryan  brothers  AJR Brothers, Adam, Ryan and Jack
This is the least dumb song I have ever heard.
The instrumentals kinda sound like Christmas in June
I wish they included all the tidbits of conversation and that same opening in the actual release of the song 😭
first of all poor martin
I love how they included their nieghbor ❤ it shows how much is put into their music and makes me appreciate it so much more
I can't see how people can hate on AJR,  they're just fun, hardworking guys who can make awesome music while barley affording a studio. Absolutely love them ❤ seeing their writing process is a treat
Truly a dumb song     Not in a mean whay though
caramba como eu queria ter amigos
I think this vid puts in perspective how long it takes for a good song
This song is really good, it's a nice feeling and definitely has a very specific vibe, though I don't think the music video complements it.  It's very unique, and that's good, but it's a completely different energy from the song itself. If it was just a nothing music video, that'd be ok, but I think the separate story and subtitles harms the songs experience a little. I feel that type of vlog music video can work with a song where you're less focused and more loose or if the song is about your career / friends specifically.
Banger
Dios, qué buena canción!
I actually love AJR SO MUCH!!!!! I’ve been a fan of them since I was 8, and they’re still just as amazing!!! Keep up the great work!!!!❤
❤
police be like: Elmo...? JAIL TIME

This song is a bop! Makes me wanna bop my head more than a pigeon walking.
I love you AJR 😭😭  You guys are amazing
One of my favorites songs! Literally played this every car ride I've been in since it dropped. 10/10, will definitely overplay again!
some words:   Never stop, keep going no matter how hard it is. And follow your dreams. And jump for the stars.
YOU SHOULD HAVE NOT DONE THAT

I can't help but to like this band more and more. You're just the best! Thanks for your music!
A vlog turned into a music video, noice!!
Best music video I’ve seen in awhile
The ironic thing is Aderall 98% the same molecular structure as meth (NOT crystal meth, methamphetamines)
I appreciate dog in video
god this music video is perfect imo. I would love if they made a documentary or something about the process of either this whole album or their next one.
"You should not have done that"  ❤️❤️❤️

Ajr is soooo underrated bruh, I've been listening to them for like over 2 years now and I'm genuinely down to sell my kidney to go to their concert
One of my favourite songs you’ve ever written

You guys are amazing to do all of these songe and albums I've been here since day one 1 thousands look how far you guys have came I listen to you guys every day I go to concerts to see you guys I love you guys
1 and a half years is just too dumb. Wonder how the song got it’s name😂
I love you so very much AJR... ❤😭
I just realized the bridge sounds like a “Jack in the box”.
I absolutely love the carefree and fun vibe this video has (low-key was expecting a tone deaf Martin to yell something at the end)
I really love this band!
I love AJR so much that I literally chose one of their songs for my cousins engagement party. They are truly such a great band!
this is the happiest, most energetic song they have, and it's amazing <3
My heart is melting...
My mom listened to the album for the first time today in the car, and she legit choked when Chloe said "you should not have done that" 🤣the hour drive was 100% worth it to see that reaction
Actual conversation I've had with my mother:
When you are constantly smiling for 4 minutes ❤
😮😮😮 a++++
A҈w҈e҈s҈o҈m҈e҈ 👍
NOT THEM PLAYING WII SPORTS RESORT 🤣
3:08  I straight up funny
So worth the wait
This is probably the best and longest wait for any song ever
Please ajr tell le you're not zionists please I love you and your music and you got le through so much please don't break my heart literally you're the only ones left
힘들때마다 듣고있어요 AJR 사랑해❤
Tbis was my third favorite song from the album. Reminds me of the break my face song. People knocking you down but who cares there are other people care about and look up to you. If there are people that think poorly of you then just leave them and not care what they think.
This song came out in the middle of the school day, so i listened to it in all of my classes and had no regrets 🥲👍
bro I've been smilin all throughout the video. I just kept on clicking random stuff on YT and it brought me here hahhahaha.
Honestly, I love the effort you put into this song! I'm happy you didn't give up on it! I went to the ok orchestra concert in June 2022. I'm obsessed with this song! It's now my favorite song of all time! I love you guys! Yall are my favorite band! ❤😭
Omg the range in different types of music videos is just so amazing and real ❤
Thank you for music videos like this ❤ love seeing the process
this is gold no joke
I LOVE YOU GUYS
i Feel like its just me but.  was the word "year" always bolded?
Having other people sing in the song is just awesome.
this and inertia are my absolute favourites
This is such a good song. It's my 3rd favorite song on the album, the lyrics are all amazing, relatable and even somewhat humorous. The catchy, nonstop, upbeat vibe makes this a complete bop. This one's amazing.
Creative chaos and I love it XD Means there is real creativity!!!
Okay I loooooove this video and it’s entire concept🥹💜
🤍❤️‍🩹🙏🏼
Imagine getting gender envy from Jack ( btw this is my favorite song on the album, with maybe man as my second)
HEY GUYS I ASKED OUT MY NOW GIRLFRIEND ON THIS DAY IT CAME OUT❤❤❤ YAYAYAYAYAA
everyone wants to be this close with their siblings
*Lyrics for anyone who wants to sing along :)*  Oh, in my head  You said with certainty I may be the dumbest person that you've ever seen You think you're hurtin' me Bet you won't believe it, but you kinda set me free  You've mentioned Adderall Slip this guy a sedative, he's bouncin' off the wall Honey, it's no big deal We'll get you back to college, you could study somethin' real  So if that's how you feel  When we go down When kingdom come Don't look at me, don't look at me I'm just too dumb I'd love to stay (Love to stay) But like you said (Like you said) Don't look at me (Nothin' in my head ) 'Cause I got nothin' in my head  Oh, in my head  Too dumb for breakin' up I'd do it in person, but I'd probably mess it up I'll text you, "That's enough" That's how empty-headed people get through shitty stuff  Your world is endin' soon Mine's a little better 'cause I never watch the news You make my lunch today I would do it, but I couldn't work my microwave  So if that's what you're sayin'  When we go down When kingdom come Don't look at me, don't look at me I'm just too dumb I'd love to stay (Love to stay) But like you said (Like you said) Don't look at me (Nothin' in my head ) 'Cause I got nothin' in my head  Oh, in my head  You should not have done that Da-da-da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da Da-da da-da-da da-da-da-da Da-da-da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da Da-da da-da-da da-da-da-da  When we go down (We go down) When kingdom come (Kingdom come) Don't look at me, don't look at me I'm much too dumb I'd love to stay (Love to stay) But like you said (Like you said) Don't look at me (Nothin' in my head ) 'Cause I got nothin' in my head  Oh, in my head Oh, in my head  When we go down When kingdom come Don't look at me, don't look at me I'm just too dumb
This song is pretty simple, but it doesn't feel lazy. Effort is definitely shown to be put into this one, and the song itself is pretty nice, but nothing new. 7/10, good overall.
you looked like you all enjoyed that so much XD
U guyz are so cute aww
woah
Someone should look into this relationship with the 7-year-old neighbor.  Seems kinda fishy
0:38
This is the songiest song ever songed
ajr the only band that you see don't wear shoes
One day we will make songs like them
This is a really nice song
This is my new favorite
This reminds me of that one Brendon urie vine that’s like “I’m totally freakin out because I gotta hundred thousand followers now” I love it
Such a fun song
I love this band so much, it's the first one to make every song enjoyable YOU GUYS ARE AMAZINGNG!!
oh my god is this HITBOMB?
This song needs a vdeo
I love this so much. I must admit I'm not a fan of a lot of AJR songs, but something about seeing a year-and-a-half process of trying to make a song and enjoying the process makes me really like this song.
I love that AJR writes their own songs. Their music feels real and honest in a way that a lot of other artists don’t seem to quite grasp.
🔥🔥🔥
I'm just too dumb That is right
This honestly feels like the opening to a slice-of-life show
These guys always manage to bring a smile on my face...
Realy good the song increible
Came for the Smallest Violin stayed for The AJR
Amazing. Love it.
This slaps hard
I’m working on a Lego version of this
I love this music video. To me, it portrays the little beautiful moments in life that just add up and all make it worth it-- like all of the effort and alterations that the song took to be finalized. another ajr slay
0:43 it really sounded like he said "bitch" LMAO
Tremendo, jajaja lo escuchare hasta cansarme jejejje porque esta brutal  Lo dejate por un tiempo y en un año bolvere a hacer lo mismo😅
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 if I could give this video more than one likes I would just spend all of the days in my existence just pressing the like button
受験を控えてる自分にはとてもいい曲ですAJRのおかげで頑張れそうです😎
のりがあっていい曲ですね😁
The date makes me want to cry, i realized its been 10 months since its 2023, good time  This is the most underrated song EVER
WOOOHOOO AJR!!!!!!!!!  🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Proof that ya keep at it y'all eventually see the results and sometimes more than ya expected ~
❌🧠
The fact AJR shares the way they write songs makes them the coolest band in the world.
I didn't love this song the first time I heard, probably because many of the lyrics seem to hit a little too close to home.\
you guys are so cool :D
This song just filld me with joy continue your work forever and ever if you ever die I hope you go to heaven to share your joy with everyone their
❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤🤍
BOM PRA CARALHO!!
Good job you did it so good.
For heard you folks when watching a Mark Rober video! I absolutely LOVE your work and the thought and fun that seems to make it all happen!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!
In a world filled with countless songs, there is one that stands above all others, a song that has single-handedly changed the course of my life. This extraordinary piece of music, whose name I shall not disclose, has motivated me to achieve feats that were once unimaginable. Its enchanting melody and captivating lyrics have propelled me to become the President of the United States, lose a staggering 100 pounds, and provided solace during my time fighting in the war-torn lands of South Sudan. But beyond my personal journey, this song has also sparked a cultural awakening, inspiring African tribes to overcome cultural shifts, standards, and differences, and embrace their heritage. Allow me to share with you the incredible impact this song has had on my life and the communities it has touched.  Firstly, let me take you back to a time when I was just an ordinary citizen, dreaming of making a difference in the world. It was during this period that I stumbled upon this life-altering song. Its powerful message of hope and resilience resonated deeply within me, igniting a fire of determination that would eventually lead me to the highest office in the land. The song's lyrics spoke directly to my soul, urging me to pursue my dreams relentlessly, regardless of the obstacles that lay ahead.  As I embarked on my journey to the presidency, this song became my anthem, my source of inspiration during the darkest of times. Its infectious rhythm and uplifting melody propelled me forward, reminding me that anything was possible. It was as if the song itself was whispering in my ear, encouraging me to push beyond my limits and strive for greatness. Without a doubt, this song played a pivotal role in my political ascent, providing me with the strength and motivation to overcome every hurdle that came my way.  But the transformative power of this song did not stop there. In my quest for self-improvement, I found myself battling with weight issues, struggling to shed the excess pounds that had plagued me for years. It was during this arduous journey that this song became my unwavering companion. Its lyrics, filled with messages of self-acceptance and inner strength, became my mantra. With each note, I felt a surge of determination, pushing me to adopt a healthier lifestyle and ultimately lose an astounding 100 pounds.  The impact of this song extended far beyond my personal struggles. It became a beacon of hope during my time serving in the war-torn lands of South Sudan. As I fought alongside brave soldiers, facing the horrors of conflict, this song provided a much-needed respite from the chaos. Its soothing melody and heartfelt lyrics served as a reminder of the beauty that still existed in the world, even amidst the darkness. It lifted our spirits, fostering a sense of unity and camaraderie among us, soldiers from different backgrounds, fighting for a common cause.  In the midst of the chaos, this song became our anthem of resilience, reminding us of the power of music to heal and unite. It gave us the strength to carry on, to fight for a better tomorrow, and to believe that peace was possible. The song's impact on our morale was immeasurable, providing a glimmer of hope in the face of adversity.  But the transformative power of this song did not end with my personal journey or the war in South Sudan. It reached far beyond borders, transcending cultural barriers and inspiring African tribes to overcome cultural shifts, standards, and differences, and embrace their heritage. The song's infectious rhythm and universal message of unity resonated deeply with these communities, motivating them to celebrate their unique identities and preserve their rich cultural traditions.  In remote villages across Africa, this song became a catalyst for change. It motivated tribes to come together, to revive ancient rituals and customs that were on the verge of extinction. The song's lyrics, though not in their native tongues, spoke to their souls, reminding them of the importance of preserving their cultural heritage for future generations. It ignited a sense of pride and belonging, empowering African tribes to reclaim their narratives and share their stories with the world.  Through the power of this song, African tribes found their voices, their rhythms, and their dances. It became a symbol of cultural resilience, a testament to the enduring spirit of these communities. The song's influence spread like wildfire, inspiring tribes across the continent to organize festivals, showcasing their vibrant traditions and fostering cross-cultural exchanges. It became a unifying force, bridging gaps between tribes and fostering a sense of collective identity.  As the song's impact continued to ripple through African communities, it caught the attention of the international music scene. Renowned artists and producers recognized its potential to bridge cultures and create a global movement of unity and understanding. Collaborations between African tribes and international musicians flourished, resulting in groundbreaking albums that celebrated the diversity and richness of African music.  The cultural shifts and standards that African tribes had to overcome were immense. For centuries, colonization and globalization had eroded traditional practices and threatened the very fabric of African cultures. Western influences had permeated every aspect of life, from language to fashion, and many tribes found themselves at a crossroads, torn between preserving their heritage and embracing the modern world.  However, this transformative song served as a catalyst for change, inspiring African tribes to reclaim their cultural identities and resist the homogenizing forces of globalization. It became a rallying cry, urging communities to rediscover their roots and celebrate the richness of their traditions.  In the face of cultural shifts, African tribes began to organize cultural festivals and events that showcased their unique heritage. These gatherings became platforms for tribes to come together, exchange knowledge, and revive ancient customs. The song that had initially sparked this movement became the anthem of these festivals, its infectious rhythm and empowering lyrics resonating with attendees from various tribes.  Through these festivals, African tribes not only celebrated their own cultures but also fostered cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. They recognized that diversity was a strength and that by embracing their differences, they could create a harmonious and united Africa. The transformative power of music was evident as tribes from different regions and backgrounds came together, sharing their music, dances, and stories, and forging connections that transcended language and borders.  As the movement gained momentum, African tribes began to reclaim their cultural practices in everyday life. Traditional clothing, once relegated to special occasions, became a source of pride and identity. Indigenous languages, once marginalized, experienced a resurgence as communities recognized the importance of preserving their linguistic heritage. Art forms such as storytelling, drumming, and traditional crafts were revitalized, passed down from one generation to the next.  The impact of this cultural awakening extended beyond the borders of Africa. The world began to take notice of the vibrant and diverse cultures that had long been overshadowed. International audiences were captivated by the mesmerizing rhythms, intricate dances, and soul-stirring melodies that emanated from African tribes. The song that had sparked this movement became a global sensation, transcending language barriers and captivating listeners from all corners of the globe.  As the song's popularity soared, collaborations between African tribes and international musicians flourished. These collaborations were not just about merging different musical styles, but also about fostering cultural exchange and understanding. African tribes brought their unique rhythms and melodies, while international artists contributed their own musical influences, resulting in a fusion of sounds that celebrated the diversity of African music.  The transformative power of this song was not limited to the realm of music. It sparked a broader cultural renaissance, inspiring African tribes to reclaim their narratives and challenge the dominant narratives that had shaped their histories. Through art, literature, and film, African tribes began to tell their own stories, shedding light on their struggles, triumphs, and aspirations. They reclaimed their agency, challenging stereotypes and misconceptions, and showcasing the depth and complexity of their cultures.  This cultural awakening also had a profound impact on the younger generation. African youth, who had grown up in a world dominated by Western influences, found solace and inspiration in the resurgence of their cultural heritage. They embraced their roots with pride, recognizing that their traditions were not relics of the past, but living, breathing entities that could shape their present and future.  The transformative power of this song and the cultural awakening it sparked cannot be overstated. It served as a catalyst for change, inspiring African tribes to overcome cultural shifts, standards, and differences, and embrace their heritage. It ignited a sense of pride and belonging, fostering unity and cross-cultural understanding. It empowered communities to reclaim their narratives and challenge dominant narratives. And most importantly, it reminded the world of the richness and diversity of African cultures, breaking down stereotypes and fostering appreciation and respect.
Nobody understands their greatness
This music video hits differently bc AJR shows that they also struggle at some points - but they never stop. You're a big inspiration and always be - thank you!!
THIS IS FREAKING INSANELY GOOD HOW COME I JUST RAN INTO THIS AJR SONG 0-0
I wish more artists made videos like this
I am a huge fan. I went to your Cleveland OK Orchestra concert and was in the pit. I love your music and also picked up the violin and got into it because of you guys. I hope all of your wishes come true. reading all of these comments is making me cry. I relate to almost all of them. This band has changed many peoples lives; it's changed mine at least.  I have depression and was on the edge of ending it all, but this band.... It saved me and I will always love them. Thank you Adam, Jack, and Ryan.
i didn't know it was 9 years since I've became an AJR fan, i came way back from I'm ready back when they used to record in their living room
If it take an artist or artists a yr and a half to make a song it must be wonderful like this song is and it is so meaningful because sometimes I feel just so dumb realizing the mistakes I made my math test lol but really sometimes I feel really dumb
OKO deluxe edition
This is like Taylor Swift's Shake It Off, and I'm here for it.
I know the melody at 0:46 is one of their other songs but i can't figure it out
AJR is so unique... They dont just put out a story they put their story and not just their story but the story of those around them... If I were to describe their music in a quote... I'd say "AJR's songs are like a pop compilation of life"
I'm in love with your songs excellent job <3
💕💕 I appreciate all you guys have put out, keep going!!
Has such a mighty mighty bostones feel ❤
“It takes absolutely forever to get her to record this right” man, she’s seven. Give her a break 😂😂

I don’t listen to much of this generation’s music but I do listen to your guys’ music everyday because it is different, unique, and just awesome. Seriously It never gets old you have awesome, funny relatable lyrics and sounds in music I would have never guessed to put together. I love it. Each day I listen to at least 20 of your songs. You guys are awesome thank you for giving us such relatable music. I love that you are willing to talk about topics other singers wont talk about because they are afraid of what people would think. Personally I’m inside my head a lot and your music has made me feel ok about that, along with being different. Again you guys are awesome, thanks.
this is art!!!! so goood !!!!
Clhoe is so cute
I love how every part of the video their faces and beard grows and then disappearing after XD

This isn’t just a dumb song, it’s THE dumb song.
0:43 (Me after looking at the official lyrics) “Oh, the actual word he used was “bet.’”
this hits harder then a rock
0:41 bro goes to the backrooms run for your life level
that transition🥁💥fire!
I wish I was Khloe
I was born in February 2
Is it actually a dumb song?
This song made me lose melanin.😰😰😰🤯🤯🤯🤯
A year and a half well spent. Amazing song.
My new fave!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
It took so long for that song to release. BUT they need their time.
You guys are awesome and me and my friend favorite band
I would kill to go on a ski trip and see Jack 😭
This band is FANTASTIC!
They should make a song with their fans! Lots of people send them verse ideas, then get people when they are on tour to sing them!  If u like my idea, 👇
2023 MASTERPIECE FO SURE.
Awesome song!!..🔥whats the name of that microphone with the sphere shaped popper?
Genuinely think i quality this is their best song. Not my favorite but their best
I will be totally honest this song gives me big anime op vibe
The most underrated song seriously this song just got 2m views after 4 months of its release and other songs which usually gets 100m or more than that don't contain any meaning in it. I don't know why but people of 21 st century could not able to identify the real diamond among all the other gems. Modern days people are really dumb
AJR definitivamente es mi banda favorita, no se pierde la esperanza de que vengan a México 🇲🇽 los amo mucho 😍😍😍
I have listened to you guys all my life even when I was younger and I always love your music and it makes me cry somehow
I think it's good to go too!
Already 2M
i made tjis song for ajr respond to it please ill love it(Verse 1) In the city's neon glow, where dreams are spun, We're just three brothers, living life as one, With a keyboard, some beats, and a mic in hand, We're writing our story, and it's just begun.  (Chorus) We're the architects of our own fate, Building melodies, it's never too late, The world's a canvas, let's paint it bold, In this AJR song, our story's told.  (Verse 2) With indie hearts, we craft our sound, In every lyric, a piece of us is found, Through the highs and lows, we find our way, In this crazy world, we're here to stay.  (Chorus) We're the architects of our own fate, Building melodies, it's never too late, The world's a canvas, let's paint it bold, In this AJR song, our story's told.  (Bridge) We'll dance with the devil, but we'll keep our soul, In this AJR song, we're taking control, Through the trials and triumphs, we'll stand tall, With music as our guide, we'll conquer all.  (Verse 3) In the chaos of life, we find our peace, Through heartache and joy, our songs release, With honesty and humor, we'll make our mark, In this AJR journey, we leave a spark.  (Chorus) We're the architects of our own fate, Building melodies, it's never too late, The world's a canvas, let's paint it bold, In this AJR song, our story's told.  (Outro) So let the rhythm of life lead the way, In this AJR song, we're here to stay, With every note we play, every word we say, In this musical adventure, we'll find our way.
I was a fan when their song I'm Ready came out for free on iTunes way back when that was a thing and seeing them now become this wet known is os nice they deserve it! I met them too and they are the KINDEST humans you will ever find in the world
omg I love the dumb song I'm really like to see how it was made
I can’t believe it cg5 commented
This is a great song, but what I really like about the video more than the cool, behind-the-scenes history it shows, is that it really helps highlight Ryan's skills as a producer and composer. Jack gets the majority of the attention (rightfully as main vocal), and Adam brings a solid foundation to the group, but Ryan's technical skills really shine in this video and do a lot of the heavy lifting to keep bringing their music to new levels. It's nice to see his work given more visibility here.
Can you please make a song on everybody working on it😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
IM YOUR NUMBER ONE FAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I found one of my new work songs to listen to while I’m opening the store
It's my favorite song, well, all your songs
What a sweet and wholesome video 🥺 Love the behind the scenes!
u are big black man
Thats awesome man 3 brothers enjoying what they can make of themselves. That's awesome.
Worked in music 25 years, the last 4 an indie label owner, so many drives in a car listening to a final mix.
Taking this to the top of my playlist
"Betcha won't believe it, but you kinda set me free." First Generation prodigy child, pushed to the precipice of success, is a passenger in a life altering accident at 21. Now dying from seizures at age 28 with years of "What will you be?" behind me; all while being begged to live and become yet another achievement or testament to themselves.  Dumb... let me be dumb. I don't wanna impress anybody today... ❤
It’s the song I listen to when I’m waiting for my adhd medication to kick in
Ajr always brings me to tears. Even just watching this video, I'm choking up. It's just so beautiful and I love all your songs. I relate with all your songs. Thank you for that.
That is one of the many reasons why AJR is my favorite band ever!!!
Sooo heep!
Ajr is amazing
So good. Gives a very happy feeling. Same with worlds smallest violin
yooo
Haha why all the hate on Martin’s singing 2:39 😂😂😂 let my boy on a song pls
anyone else notice how CG5 down here always coomments on a AJR video?v v v v
and i can't wait for the maybe man to come out and for you to tour it!
i love your songs and it's really cool to see hoe there made
Why is this nostalgic already lol
this reminds me of myself
been several months and i still think this is their best song. you guys are really one of a kind!
GO AJR!
Just the most creative!
I love AJR
Queria saber inglês
Amo esta banda ermosa
Oh man. What a video.
The best way to make a song is to live through while making it.
I would just like to appreciate the editing. Syncing all those clips together to match the various lyrics in the video must have taken forever...
Boy with uke is better
この曲を聞くと、何故かふしぎな安心感に包まれるのは俺だけかな？
is it just me who thinks they should start vloging making songs?
I love this. - how do I become best friends with Ryan  I even forcefully 😂 made my dad watch it
I like that this song took a year to make & they filmed the entire process. The work is really evident & the song is relatable in that cheerful, uncomfortably nostalgic & uncanny way.
Whenever my day just seems to suck , this is my go- to band . I always smile and feel better. I love that about music ❤
Bland vanilla wafer commerical music. The teeth of rock music of successfully been pulled and its now fun for the whole family
It does sound really good
Cchloe is so cute ❤🥺
I just love you guys so much. Thank you for helping me through some of the hardest years of my life ❤
Ajr은 사라지지말자
boa 👍
I never heard of AJR before, but this month I went to Imagine Dragons concert, and AJR were opening for them. As soon as I heard their songs, I immediately fell in love with them. Now I can't stop listening to their songs.
❤
Listen to this when reading mushoku tensei manga chapter 85 86. The vibes are right.
This is my life in a nutshell
I wish I could like this a million times over. ❤
Y’all are great!!!
Amazing 🎉😊
“Martin is tone deaf.” made me lose my mind 😭😭😭😭
I've listened to this song about a million times since it was released, "you should not have done that" is still my favorite part.
to be honnest the music video more than the song itself it's just a whole recap of the great success of AJR.
0:41 Why does this hallway look like the backrooms-?
Loved you guys in PULA as the preshow for imagine dragons. you have a new fan!(more trumpets please)
Jack: don't look at me cuz i got nothing in my head Ezra: *puts a baby on top of his head*
Your songs always good i swear <3
I think this is beautiful. I love this song.I hear this song all the time . And it clears my mood away
what a dumb song
One and a half years wow thats a lot
항상 잘듣고있습니다^^
이건 라이브가 진짜 좋아요🩷
Please come to the Philippines!
Guessing this wont be seen because im late too discovering this amazing song but.. this song is amazing!! I love it, that year and half paid off and it really shows. Well done guys.
This song saved my life.
Awesome!!!
Literally listening to this on replay right now 😂 💃
Moral of the video:Make the best friends
Came here after watching you perform with one of Koreas best vocalist Seo Eunkwang of BTOB! 💙🙌  Fire song! 🔥Makes me wanna dance, jump and sing at the same time! 😆✨
My birthday is one day before this song released
What does the final mix mean?
AJR's music is really inspirational! I love it!
rainbolttwo will dox these guys
I make my music in my room too
very nice song!
COOL
This song is the best!!!
How lucky I am to be one of the lucky people who have discovered this band and had the privilege to listen to their songs 🥹❤
More than good to go. Its a damn HIT.
This song is the best song I’ve ever heard.
I enjoyed this song so much! you have no idea

I Love It

I wanna know if any inspiration was taken from Wii Sports 3:36

Rest in Peace to their #1 fan. Hang in there AJR ❤️
it cracks me up that they make an amazing song and at the end there all like "yeah i think thats pretty decent"
Hey are I’m a huge huge huge fan of you band I live in Arizona and it would be a dream come true if you came and had a concert
This was really cool
The brothers being goofy was just the perfect thing for this song.
Im going for a really difficult goal which is the platinum on super meat boy and super meat boy forever which are some of the hardest trophies to get and I’m using your music and mt dew to help me do it
I love it when bands and artists shows the production of their song as the official video. It shows what happens with them during the making
This song hits hard I lost my first step dad to cancer then my second drank himself to death less then a year ago I completely understand what these boys are going through Adam jack and and Ryan stay strong spend as much time as possible with him it’ll put one giant smile on his face before his last breath heck it’ll make him fight to survive if he has the option too and stay strong to anyone who recently lost a father or is about too things will be tough but will get better
Is the reason why the band is called AJR cus the 3 of youse’s named start with those letters
Thank you
BTOB Eunkwang brought me here 💙
Hi , i am a litle kid who, in his school sing this  I just REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY want to show you my sing caus it was cool        Oo        W
I love how your neighbour said "You should not have done that" so cool!
One inspiring song can affect millions
LOVE the song!!!!
Can I animate over this song?
you guys aside from lovejoy and a few other creators are some of my top reasons to try out music ^_^
AJR is the kind of band whos music is known by everybody but only 1% of those people actually know the band. They are underated af
A btob fan here after their collab with Eunkwang, i just fell in love with them instantly ❤.
Thank you for your collaboration with eunkwang❤
Wii Sports Resort
totally a classical masterpiece
I get called dumb a lot this is the song for me Lol biggest inspiration to me though keep the amazing music up
Hi ajr
Omg cg5
2:23 mystery man from undertale??????????????🤨 in the background music??
The longer it takes the better it is.👍😀😃😄😁
🥰
How is it a world tour if you never visited (south) Africa? 😢😢😭😭
My kids(6 & 2) love this song. They go crazy during Chloe's verse. Of course I'm a big fan of you guys as well. 😎
I love how much the act of creating music ends up in the final art itself, which is seen so much in your videos!
I love ajr! This song even helped me cope through a breakup, thanks AJR.
Just realized he's wearing the bummerland outfit 1:46
ROUND OF APPLAUSE PLEASE FOR THIS WONDERFUL SONG MADD BY WONDERFUL PEOPLE
Wow, a year and a half. This song is so fucking real  I never watched music videos until about 1 am this morning when I binged AJR's.  P.s. My Play left me speechless
forever my fav band
Lets appreciate how much work and effort they put into this song
A studio after 17 years😂
“Says first words” Her: world don’t revolve around u 🌎
We need a whole behind the scene video for this!!
wait why did i see nogla for some reason idk 1:04 he lookes like nogla
I'm sorry, but as good of music creators you are, The Dumb Song by Murph & Gawkman is just better.
Just fuor words     Dont stop make music
They really spent 1 year and a half making a single really good song, now that's dedication.
The ajr concert was great
you guys should have made a ski video!
Never knew about ajr before. Found your smallest violin song through hugo the malamute channel short. Then watched this video. I had tears. I dont know why. I like this kind of mv. I may not be able to achiege my dream as a musician and a composer but watching this feels something
No idea how long it took to make songs but it shows great job guys!
this feels like an early 2010s song i love it
One of there greatest song in a while so thank y'all for being such great people and making good music for the world
I’m facing court because of February 2023. I’m glad y’all have fun. Thank you for the amazing music. Keep up the good work. Ps child abse 😢
Songs, just like stories, take time to percolate until it comes into being. It's not something that's born from nothing but from a lot of time, effort, and work to make it come into being as you guys have. For the listeners, it takes us a few minutes to listen. A year and a half for one song to be made, let alone how long it takes to make a full album, as good as the ones you guys make.   Thank you for every song and every album, every concert and live performance, every thing you put your heart into, it shows and shines bright. You are all wonderful for the music you've brought to the people who listen to you.   And you're all just so cool. Keep being yourselves and keep doing what you like doing however long this ride lasts.  Sincerely, Someone who likes you guys a lot :)
"You should not have done that!"  Best part lol
This AJR song is extramental.
Good job!
Brothers for life
You should DM dodger films and do a in game concert
It's really difficult for me to know what I like, but the first time I heard you on 2017 I knew I loved this band! Never stop doing music, this is amaizing!
How much do you think it would cost to hire ajr for a birthday party
I’m going to an AJR concert tomorrow
come to romania ajr
this song is so dumb i love it
Que pro
this song is alr 2 months old ???????? it feels like it released last week
Wait are they quiting making music?
I'd say 99% of new songs that get radio play are trash and 1% gems, this song is definitely a gem.
The love and soul in this clip and song are just what this world needs right now x
Gonna do a ska cover maybee
2:11 you make my lunch today
I'm so glad I finally found this!
Loving It
Just amazing ❤❤❤❤
이 남자들 옆집에 살고 싶다..

This is probably the best song I’ve ever heard in my life
The ski part, jack is wearing the same clothes as in bummerland!
I feel like this song is happy
I've known them for a while, but with the first song I heard from them I fell in love... one of my inspirations for personal compositions.
Ajr cool
AJR has come so far, I can’t wait to see more of your amazing songs in the future! NEVER STOP MAKING MUSIC!
Just four words:    Never stop making music.
Ajr my fan
I'm leaving a comment so whenever someone replies I'll be reminded of this great song!
My favorite😍 song🎵 is this song
AJR love from India 🇮🇳 I am just your biggest fan from the bottom of my heart ❤
Wow Korean sub script! Thank u so much❤❤
Seeing them in concert in Connecticut was absolutely shell shocking!!!! AJR is the best to come out since Jonas brothers! What a amazing group of men! Can’t wait to see their next tour! 🎉🎉🎉
i love this song so much i just put it on a loop
Another phenomenal piece from you guys. I don’t think you three will ever fully understand how much you’ve meant to me and other fans, the worst situations we’ve overcome because of you, the breakdowns and panic attacks you’ve soothed. I wouldn’t be as ‘okay’ as I am today without your music and passion there to help me through absolutely everything. There are no words I could ever say to show my appreciation truly, but thank you boys for doing that for us all. <3
I am the dumbest person everybody would have met in my life  {probably}
the fact they aren't doing it for the money rather just doing what they love, you can tell by their excited smiles
👋👏😎
You guys have progressed so much in so little time i remember atarting to listen to you guys when you started playing on my Pandora playlist then ive kept listening to you since the good part came out
You can feel the effort you guys put into this just listening to the song, first time i heard it I knew it was gonna be a classic and a banger
Me scrolling comments for the lyrics with joy in my heart 🙆‍♀️😍
'when kingdom come'
I love how you guys share your process and are just so genuine. It's also very sweet that you involved your neighbor's kid in the song. I bet she was super excited to help out! Hope yall are doing great, and keep being awesome! <3
Thanks for adding Korean subtitles
Thank you ajr so much you are 1 of the 2 reasons i havent committed it yet thank from the bottom of my heart
this is a banger in the summer time
i love them i wish i could be friends with them i also wish my friends can get as far as they did, but i rrally really wish i could be friends with them
Is that lil dicky?
Best band ever
Hehe very funny😂
I love this song so much
On Apple Music it says it was posted on my bday
Am I high or is this chorus  about when a comet hits and blows the spot up
I loved the visualisation of the making of this song. So lovely.
It's impossible to not dance or smile when I hear an AJR song! They are truly a talented group ❤❤❤
I know I am late but I stilled listen to the song when it came out
Holy shit this gives mad tøp vibes but in their own way, I love this
I am new to AJR (started listening to Burn The Whole House Down since 2022) and because of this epic song made me inspired :D you all deserve a new sub!
The Song Is My New FAVORITE SONG
Yooooooo…..I am mesmerized…..this song is the goat
lo mejor de lo mejor
AJR deserverse more
I love how wholesome this song and video is. Another amazing work from my favorite band AJR. ^^
I love how I have less singing talents than a 7 year old.
following the theme of the song, i just found out that these three are brothers
This song describes the troubles I have making friends. I have a lot of energy like a child and people treat me like I'm dumb. Thank you for giving me this song to cheer me up🥹
0:13 let me just say, thank you for all the hard work that you put into making this song. You really are the greatest and most dedicated musicians i have ever seen. And let me speak for the fandom, that we appreciate your hard work every day
Adam has a big head
Ryan has a big head ryan
Jack has a big fart jack
compare AJR 7 years ago. different
Bummerland,The dumb song are the best in my eyes.
Can't get this song outta my head
This song has only been out for a little while but AJR has gotten me through a lot and I’m so grateful WSV ,TGP, and 100 bad days have been my anthem
Official KOR translation subtitles for an official MV. Thank AJR, so much for how amazing this is. 😂
Idk if yall agree but this song kinda feels like something cage the elephant would make, also it fucking slaps
Didn't expect to see USANA Amphitheater in Salt Lake right at the beginning. Nice.
miss you my heart
Here before tiktok ruins this song
very rare ajr w
Now Korean lyrics!
Instantly like the video and song. May be the best video ive watched in a while. Adding the friends and fam was EPIC and HEARTWARMING! XD
Legändary song 😂😂
I love their current songs! :)
This song has become my national anthem
3:09 wait. IS THAT CHRIS TYSON FROM MR.BEAST????
You should not have done that😅
3000th comment EXACT!
im not even paying attention to the song im just reading the sub and looking at the vid xd but has a great bop
lets go, im in an AJR music video! It's comforting to know of these pixels will forever contain my face
How fun!! Loved that this is the video you made with the song! Also LOVE the song!
Great patience! Also great song!
i rarely comment on music videos... but this, this right here is 🤌
This song is awesome, can't wait to see you here in Athens!
HOWD THE F*** DID CG5 REPLY
AJR IS THE BEST!
Insane 😮
Thank you guys so much for inspiring me to write my own songs! I love you guys so much ❤
the ski jacket he is wearing is the same one from bummerland.
Can I have a vid call with you guys I’m your biggest fan   Sorry I should not have said that because that will never happen
Loved it ❤  Love form Indian ❤
I am one of your fans who really likes your songs in Korea. Until recently, I was suffering from panic disorder and anxiety disorder. But listening to your song and reading the lyrics, I was very comforted and touched. Whenever I was afraid and in pain to see people, I endured it with your songs, and this time I courageously went to the Seoul Jazz Festival to listen to your song. It was so hard for me and I was always afraid But your song made me hold out. Thank you so much and I'll enjoy this concert. I always feel grateful. the fact that I can hear your song
amazing journey to make the dumb song.
Am I the only one that sees Christmas in June in this?
Every time I hear this song I feel very happy, but also want to cry. I once did start crying while listening to this in the car.  You see, I like this guy, we’re friends but we haven’t been for too long. He likes AJR just like me, and he has a YouTube channel. He made a video and put this song in it, so since everything related to him overwhelms me, when I hear this song I think of him and that’s why I started crying before. It’s really hurtful to like someone, but it’s also very fun and happy. I’ll deal with the pain because the good in it is worth it. Also the potential.  can’t remember how many times I cried about him, but he’s also made me generally happier day to day.  Now you’re probably wondering, no he didn’t hurt me, and no I wasn’t rejected.  It’s just.. hurtful to care so much and like a person so much and have so much uncertainty about the future of it. I don’t really know if I should say I *love* him, but it’s definitely not just a crush. A crush is simply attraction, most likely physical. It’s definitely not just that, because I knew him for eight years but only started talking to him now. I only talked to him now because I misunderstood him and didn’t want to before, but now I like him. I really could give you a list on why I like him, but I won’t. My point is I really care a lot and that’s hurtful when you don’t know if you’ll ever be able to bring the care in a relationship way. I just want to care for him..
When u guys go to indonesia?
not worth the year and a half
I feel like I've already heard this song, but I still love it :3
Love it!
Did you realize that Ryan kinda looks like CG5?
Hi AJR
As someone who grew up during the Beatles years, I have enjoyed many musical styles.  I really began paying attention to AJR when I heard World's Smallest Violin, which quickly became one of my favorite songs.  The Dumb Song simply blew me away.  I love everything about it!  The uptempo beat, fabulous drums, melody, vocals, arrangement - all superbly done.  I can't get this song out of my head.  One of my all-time favorites, for sure!
Amazing music video and song. Love how it shows the whole process of building a song. Also love the ska vibes!!
This band is absolutly insnane, so good!! Im sas that not a not of people at my axhool like this band, so sometimes i get made fun of, oh eell at least im listening to my favorite band!❤
Wow
come here coz I heard that AJR will have a collaboration with BTOB Eunkwang in a show .  Waoh ! I am glad that I knew this song now. it is a happy vibe song
I coulda sworn i commented here before oh well Great song

The song is so good. I look forward to the next song too~~ (I am Korean)
AJR has always made me happy and made me feel like music is nice, but AJRs’s music is the only artist that can make me this happy. :)
Congrats on 1M views🥳
hey!! i just wanted to say that i really admire your groups energy, it really gives that vibe that everything will be okay in the end :)
This song is not dumb 👏
Chloe carried imo
As a aspiring musician the clip and music is so inspirational. Keep up the future of music!
This feels like I'm getting dumber and it's amazing ❤❤❤
Again a great and happy song! In combo with this music video, really awesome! Love it🥰
Why does this band have such an awful reputation? This sounds fine.
曲構成がとても昔のいい邦楽に似てて好き
It may have been a year and a half for this song but it was worth it, keep up the good work ,adam,jack,and ryan
I love the lyrics to this song
Aight time to see how tiktok ruins this one...

I ❤ Your New Song "The Dumb Song"
They literally played this song at a marching band exercise today, I had listened to ajr before but never this song before. I had seen the dumb song but never listened to it. Immediately when they played it, I knew it was the Dumb Song. I don't know how or why, but ajr is just different.
i love you ajr
Thank You so much for this song! much love from Poland! All best <3 Loop and loop again... And this video and moment with Chloe ;D
this was so exciting to watch, i’ve been taking a songwriting class this past semester and it’s so nice to see this process after learning that you never really know when your song is really finished
I LOVE THIS SONG THIS CAME OUT 3 WEEKS AGO AND IT FEELS LIKE YESTERDAY THEY MADE THIS ITS THAT GOOD!
Whoever came here with YouTube or other social media.(except tiktok) is a legend

I have a theory, and if correct lol, next song should be the TWW Overture (if they stick to the 4 singles before an album Overture)
I just got tickets to see you guys perform at Tropicana field!, can’t wait to see you guys there!
Nice Job On 1M Views AJR!

Woo this the best song ever made!!! Sorry I wrote this on a bus and I was tried it was really late in the day
Sons would’ve been so much better without the cringe trumpet/orchestra bit, but idk maybe that’s just me
listen to the song when u put 0,75 speed and very great song AJR :)
This song is one of the best songs in AJR's history, with a freshness that reminds one of early summer!
I love it ❤
Really best sona i heard <3
Ajr songs makes my mood better every time I'm feeling lost

I absolutely love this song and Ajr! I can’t believe how much work you put into this song so glad you didn’t give up on it!
This song is amazing!
Hey @cg5  you should make a song with AJR i know that with a recipe like that only a masterpiece can be made

The good part.
Ajr is the god of music
I like your songs
Wow,  great song, great music,  great fun,  for me I loved it and you can hear each and every word perfectly, brilliant, im 70 BTw
I fucking love this guys with all my heart. The passion, love, dedication, creativity, and meaning they give to their songs is utterly amazing and inspiring.  The entirety of México will welcome you with open arms if you ever do a concert here
I love how good all of your song is! but this one especially.. give me a feeling that i can't even describe myself <3 keep up the good work!!
Underrated AF
Ja era pra esses cara terem no minimo uns 10 grammys , so lançam hino
AJR has been my favorite band since I was little, you guys still absolutely amaze me with your music. Like ik this sounds dumb (lol get it, Dumb Song), but I nearly cried while listening to this.
0:00 welcome to time beta have fun
does anyone have an idea what's that spherical mic the guys are using at 3:48 ??
This was so freaking good. To be honest it's reached my top 5 ajr songs already. I don't know how to explain it but I really loved the structure of it. I don't think AJR will ever stop being my favorite band. Keep up the good work guys!!
Great song, love the behind-the-scenes bit, makes this song unique from many others
this is my fav ajr song😁
This is my favorite song and i love the process of how its made.
A year and a half well spent! I love this song!
I think it's good to go too. :)
this song must reach 1 billion❤
Bruh I love this
Can we get to the good part
Its a cool song but i live in the Netherlands and i really want to see you you guys are my Idols so can you come to the Netherlands just one time in Amsterdam or i dont know but plss😊❤
You guys need to collab with boy with ukulele
wii sports
Wow is beatifull
Genuine, Inspiring and Bright, your music is outstanding. No accolade is enough to award this satisfying move. AJR, I just left to say: Thanks for giving us such a precious piece of art. You've got my heart.
SO… FUCKING… GOOD!
I’ve been waiting 6 months and this song. . . ILOVE IT!
This song is a fuckin bop
ily
Been loving this song since it dropped and I just stumbled on the video, so amazing to see the how much goes into these songs and how many people are involved! Amazing group wholesome time and people, just beautiful
Chloe is so cute
The dum-best song
Ajr please come to the Netherlands 😢😢 ppppllllleeeeeaaaaaassssssseeee
I love how this song is weaponizing the stupidity others put on you. It's kinda hilarious
Fucking love this song ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I am here before this becomes a titock sound
@AJR  you need WATCH THIS new cg5 song is like inspiratioanal thing you pleeeease watch it
This MV totally need more appreciation ! Why is it only 826k???
Sounds like a strokes/voidz with a Pharrell twist song
the dum-best song
The line about being unable to work a microwave bit me right in my executive dysfunction. I relate to so many of AJR's songs on a level that just thrills me. They're on pretty much any playlist I make and I really hope to see them live one day.
Glad to see them and their songs grow bigger and bigger
HOW DO YOU KNOW IM DUMB
This is the meaning of music right here. Not necessarily the notes and word but bringing people together and just feeling good.
Oh youth!
I LOVE AJNR!!!!!!!!!!!!
Os amó chicos, Mí sueño siempre será conocerlos Pero lamentablemente soy venezolano 😿✨
Love the O's shirt. Go Baltimore
ajr I have some peoplethat kind is like your music and I would love if you were to collaborate with them/ jawny,spiral drive,and rare Americans
This song is absolutely incredible. Every new AJR song is better than the last.
Based
Thank you for making very relatable music
Ironic - footage of ajr being creative geniuses to a song about being too dumb 😂👏🏼👏🏼
i have a massive addiction to this song😳
There’s something so beautiful and special about watching an artist you love, grow and flourish. It’s so lovely and it feels like we’re all right here with you guys. The first time I went to see you guys preform you were on this tiny itty bitty theatre stage in New York, I think it was 2014 or 2015. I never got to see that performance, my dad and I got stuck in bad traffic, but we stayed there and sat in the theatre for a bit and we were like “they’re so much bigger than this, they’re gonna be huge one day” and here we are, nearly 10 years later and seeing all of this is just so beyond amazing. And as one of the best musicians in the world once said, we can’t wait to see what you do next🫶🏻
I want to start making song when i grow up😢
00:27 so cool that Nepo released a song WHILE challenging for the chess world chempionship!
Can every music video be like this? I've watched this 20 times
1:59 this crowd is vaguely familiar…
ajr thank you song good song
I've been listening to them since 2018 and I still like their themes :)
😭❤️❤️❤️❤️
a year and a half of work goes to show how gifted and committed they are to there music and fans
You guys are just AWESOME! 🔥 It was totally worth it to wait 1,5 years for this song.
It’s interesting to see the process and time it takes to make a song. Great song, AJR!😀
Love this song!
MARTIN IS TONE DEAF
Al fin más fan de ajr♥️
Nice, keep it up!
What an absolute joy to see how much fun they had making this song. What a bop
I  am absolutely obsessed with this song!
A radical new approach to their style. I love it
I'm totally a fan of your group(๑•̀ㅁ•́ฅ✨
i really appreciate this song and how uplifting it sounds. i have been seeing this guy who's doing a phd in mathematics and i admitted that want to date him but he doesn't want that, and i know one of the reasons behind it is that he finds me too dumb... which feels really shitty, like he's probably smarter than 99% of people so i'll never get close to being smart enough for him, but eh, it's okay
So i'm not the only one taking years to make individual songs
I want everyone to support this band they are so hardworking
AAAAAJJJJJRRRRR
2:42 Can relate. This was a banger! Let it be known that I was here.
To the future person reading this. If you have found this song and love it, I’ll let you know something. AJR has gotten me thru hard times, and I hope that they have helped you, and I hope you can make this song uplift you and make you happy. Just like how every song of theirs has done for me. Be safe out there, and let music guide you on your journey.
I love you guys
❤
poser😮😮😮😅😊    😂
poset
eewwwww suck
I just have to say that this band is literally the reason I’m finally happy in my life. Whenever something bad happened or I was feeling depressed I would listen to Ajr, it was like someone was there telling me “hey it’s ok”. I’m literally crying while listening to this song it’s so fucking good!!!!❤❤😂😂
Your music, videos and everything are not just inspiring for everyone but captivating!  Not just that but your music feels close to home, happy yet raw and emotional when needed. It captures the ups and downs of life, fame and so much more without any filter on it.  It makes me happy to be here and as much as it helps me and others feel less alone when down your music also makes many and i feel happy to he here experiencing life and what it has to offer.  It feels like music for the people from people.. unlike some in which its music for money and from corporations.  Thank you AJR
3:26 arnetta, the trumpet girl.
To those who are at haters of this song you really have to appreciate how long they spent making this song and AJR is my personal favorite band of all time I’ve heard the DJ is crying for help, karma, the worlds smallest violin, Im ready, record player, and many more if you dislike this music that’s fine but don’t go hating their music writing mean comments and just making them feel bad because if someone was mean to you, you might make them quit whatever you’re being mean to them at like, for example, I am in drama class and someone once told me that” you’re a horrible actor” and” you should be out of that class you’re just gonna fail” and I once wanted to stop and it made me feel really bad so don’t go hating out on their music because you don’t know how hard it is to make a song. And AJR just want to let you know don’t listen to the haters thank you.AND THATS FOR YOU HATERS.
I love the trumpet so much
truly masterpiece
More artists should take inspiration from this style of music video.   It was interesting, entertaining  and felt way more personal than the average  Really good idea
Chloe being adorable like
I love you guys! This is so good!!!❤
Thank you this make my day good work
This song is the biggest W keep it up and good luck finding inspiration
Just smile song😊
Very good job AJR
i just love their song
Wish this song blows up in the Internet just like  World's smallest violin. Great job Guys🎉❤
this song sounds kinda dumb
Is anyone else wondering why Chloe said "You should not have done that" The song is a banger but I am so confused on that one line
You guys are REALLY INSPIRING!
i saw this on youtube ads a few seconds ago. this is so good!
These guys make me so freaking happy!
Make more songs like ordinaryish people and bang
If you like this listen to Georgie Fame Yeah yeah
emotional he couldn’t work his microwave
This is fire 🔥🔥
Bro all of a sudden I was so sick and since I heard this I felt so good ❤❤❤😅😅
this is how making music is supposed to be. no suits anywhere, just creative talent doing their thing. amazing.
兄弟が仲良しっていいね！🥳👍 🐻🐻‍❄️🐼
I also love how there's a random clip of them playin wii😂
Love it just love it ❤😂
This is one of the most beautiful music videos I’ve seen just from the emotions I got from it, let alone the actual music, that was… something beyond words
i cried
Fantastic catchy, upbeat song.  It put a smile on all my families faces!  Great job boys!!!
This song is amazing, it's crazy how detailed the song is.
ajr 폼 미쳤다
This video is inspiring❤
next tour bring me along I'm trying to learn about live audio and hopefully one day do what noah does.

So worth it, the song turned out so good- I’ve been forcing everyone I know to listen to it lol
大好き♪
Okays okays...we all here are dumbest than we know 🙌🙌🙌✨✨✨✨🙈
When i listen to ajr i feel connected
This has to be one of the best AJR songs ever at this point, it is literally a masterpiece! 🔥
idk what to say besides your awesome
THEY PLAYED WII!!!
Best song of 2023 ❤
Knowing how much time and work was put into this song makes me not feel bad about listening to it on repeat ever since it came out
THE WII SPORTS TABLE TENNIS
Where are Chris Kattan and Will Ferrell?
This isn't the dumb song it's the good song
Wow, I never really realized what goes into making a song. Good job guys! P.S. I saw Olly 👁👄👁
Amazing grate work
Cuando empezó la melodía del principio me entraron muchas ganas de llorar, sentí un nudo y un sentimiento único mientras más avanzaba la canción, AJR TE AMO, GRACIAS POR LA CREACIÓN DE TREMENDAS JOYITAS MUSICALES <3
The best song ever made. Just beautiful. You can't find anything to hate it for
This song is worth that much years of effort. Best song I have ever heard.
Inspired me to be a music artist
It’s interesting to see the behind the scenes making of the song
Love everything about this💙
I love this <3<3
reminds me in some way of christmas in june
Altérnate title how to make a hit song
Is that  a wii in chole
Like for martin
Hope you one day come to beijing China❤
❤
You’re all adorable I love the dumb song video.  May all your dreams come true! 💓  🌊🌊😇🌊🌊
Ajr, you are probably some of the best people I’ve ever listened to. You guys teach better lessons than some therapists. Would love to meet you guys someday❤
I love that in some clips you see them singing the lyrics or making hand gestures to the notes
i love it
AHHHHHH I LOVE THIS SO MUCH🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Pin me if you got tricked  Read more...
Ya
The year in a half really shows! I love this song!
my love story ♥
suena en radio doble nueve 99.1fm
Was just in that airport terminal. lol.
1:14 My favorite party
no words just amazing
worth years of making this song
No amigooo,está canción se escucha re hermoso 🛐♥️
All hail Chloe!
This is literally one of my fav AJR songs XD
Man this is just wholesome as heck, not only you guys presented the musical process of making a song, but also enjoying life’s best moments 😎
This song was kinda dumb
I'm so proud of you guys, this music is the most amazing thing I've ever heard in my life.
This song makes me happy. Good work guys ❤
Have been a fan of AJR for a long time. This song is as amazing as always.
Why you call out Martin like that
POL
Happy to say I saw them 3 times on that world tour.  Did you see me in the audience shots?
I just love how AJR put so much effort into making songs it really blows me away
Just great to see all the process
What a blast. And, the IMPORTANCE and foresight to document everything. I love it.  Oh, and, poor Martin. I feel you.
I really like this song
it's been said so many times, but AJR has such a fresh, inspirational and fun take on music. they look around, they find and create new sounds that fill their songs with a acoustical depth that is hard to find somewhere else. their music has been my favourite for years now and i adore every single new song. i love getting into the lift-up mood, searching for the tiny layered song and audio elements and just bop my head. they also make my little adhd brain happy, because it's not too little and not too much stimulation, i always find a new sound i haven't noticed yet and i will never get enough. i can't wait for the next album!!
It's fascinating to see the difference between so many different artists' styles of writing and producing, from 200 takes in a professional recording studio to a hand mic and a phone, from "we spent years making this" to recording over months to "oh yeah I wrote this in like 45 minutes at a dinner one night", there's so much variety in seemingly every way.  Also props to Arnetta, I still love that you guys have an actual trumpet player rather than all samples, adds a lot of emotion to many of the songs.
Como me encanta esta cancion, saludos desde Argentina ❤
You won’t heart me
Goat
This is so good
Abosultuely stunning work
How could I not have seen this sooner!
Wow, this song is amazing. It makes me smile and I think this would be an amazing song to put in a movie
This gives of sitcom intro vibes and I love it lol
This reminds me of the strokes and I love it
I love thisss
finnnaaaallllllyyyyyy lets gooooo i waited sooooo long fr this good job it's really good
2:09 in the music video is at 3:07 in the OKO tour doc episode 6! I just realized that
i think this song tells to much to me.
Absolutely obsessed
I love this song. I like how you also think of kids to be this song. Thanks.
You and me both
Love the song I listen to your songs every night
acha lkin poucha nhi tha
Ese intro se copiaron de la musica tradicional Perú es hermosa
Always makes me smile
I'm confused. I'm pretty sure I've heard this like a year ago. But it's showing just released? Don't tell me this is another Mandela Effect or something?
I LOVE IT
CAUTION: MEN AT WORK !!!❤❤
Just finished the song and couldn't tell you what it sounded like cause the video was too awesome
Another really super catchy upbeat song from these very talented brothers. This has a great summery vibe going i hope that this will be a big hit. AJR need more success.
Why do I hear Christmas in June sounds here
This hits sm 🤭❤️❤️
I was there in May it’s was my birthday
my loves❤
Time well spent
this a very catchy toon and an amazing Music Video, I love the idea.
this is so great MV, funny, giggling and genius.
don't look at me I'm just too dumb ;)
Most music videos don't mean all that much, or contribute much to the song itself. I like this one. It feels like it improves the song in a way other music videos don't. Great work, AJR.
What is the "kingdom come" you sing about in the chorus?
PLZ COLLAB WITH AJR :D
I LOVE YOU CG5!!!! AND GREAT JOB AJR!
PLEASE COME TO BRAZIL
Love it, 😌👍
Gooood
OMG A NEW FIRE AJR SONG ONE AGAIN 😃😃😃
Great music! i love everything thats coming out :)
thank you for not swearing in this song!
0:30 big microphone time
i love this the put so much time in this
Love it keep up the amazing work
Absolutely love the SKA sound and horns in the bridges!  Can we expect some more of this goodness in future songs?
I've been with a ARJ since late 2021 this is so cool
SO GOOD
From I'm Ready To The Dumb Song Every Song Are Still In My Mind
Worth the wait!
Sounds good
hello AJR are you interested in a collaboration? By the way I love your songs :)
More Chloe!
MARTIN IM ALSO TONE DEAF AND STILL HAVE A LOVE FOR MUSIC DONT WORRY!!!!!!!!
I’m so proud of you guys!
The world smallest violin used to be my favorite now it's this
Question: does anyone else feel this song is supposed to be longer than it is? Just feels shot to me but that could be just me.
OMG that's amazing! such a fantastic video. so amazing. so, so, so fascinating and excellent and wonderful! ah!! i just cant say it enough. - and then also, I dont even know why i'm surprised, because everything you guys do is outstanding. I love it so much! thank you for another amazing music video! it was a joy to follow you through the story journey of this song
i heard this song every day :>
This song is soo good. A year of hard work, passion and love really shows in the song. Keep making great songs. I hope one day I can see you live.
This is quite an improvement, I do like these guys, even though it might not be my fav music.  I hope their next album is better. I'm rooting for these guys
Anyone please make a 1 hour loop or something for this
Me: A musician? Jack: *Puts on the hat* Me: Jack the musician?!?
Can you make a song about moving away and what it feels like as a kid
IM IN THIS VIDEO HOLY COW
This was incredibly heartwarming to watch, and the song is a banger!! It’s so cool to actually see the process and all of the awesome people who worked on this🥰 AJR, you’re my favorite!!!
I've been supporting you guys since 2020. The first song I listened to from you guys was "100 bad day" and ever since I just became a fan of all your songs and I love to see you guys grow even better so keep up the good work!
Is that a Wii in 2022??
god i loved thsi song so much and seeing the entire process through this video was amazing :")
It reminds me so much of Christmas In June, it's so amazing ngl, one of the best, hopefully it wins a reward it's so deserved lmao
BRO THAT IS SO FIRE
The trumpet wizard is still here!!!!
imagine degons x ajr?
AJR is and will forever be my favorite band out there, even if stops being my favorite, I will always remember this wonderful band!
Rip martin
0:43 B A C K R O O M S
IDK why people hate there music
when their 7 year old neighbor just started yelling I  was dying of laughter lol
From wii sports tennis to wii sports resort ping pong, I love these guys
This is honestly great. AJR is doing a great job with their music
Wow way to demystify the whole process to the point that I feel like I personally know what it felt like to have worked really hard on this track in the studio for hours and now I don't want to hear it anymore.
inb4 "You should not have done that" becomes a famous tiktok sound
NF put me on to this group
Kids on TikTok don’t know what a good song is I can’t believe the children said on their TikTok this is radio music and it’s should be unreleased I bet these kids who said that listen to rubbish music
Don't know who is A, J or R but doesn't singer guy look like Daniel Riccardo?
AJR being awesome...as usual
W O W
Watching this in steam vr.
🤟🏻
This song gives me a sense of final scene of a long story somehow? In a positive sort of way, like a sweet ending after a whole series worth of adventures :D The music is some of my favorite stuff and I reeeeally wanna make a cover of this song and/or animate it to something :D
I’ve learnt the song already great song keep up the good work❤
03:46 am I the only one who noticed Olly? He's so cute ❤
Wait a minute...do you think Chloe is the same neighbor who cried as a baby and inspired "Weak"?
It's refreshing to see a video without ASS in your face everywhere! Thanks guys!
Martin is an entire mood bro
this is so dumb
I love you guys so much
AJR is the only band that I can genuinely enjoy apart from music before the 2000s. In short this song is a banger
I'm glad I become a fan of this band since 2021   I love hearing their songs its like a motivation for me to keep working
Honestly love this MV so much instead of another visual MV I love how you somehow made this song more special by showing us the making of if
I think if ajr has a song idea, they could make a post asking us for potential lyrics, which they can change up to there liking if it’s really difficult to find inspiration. But very good song
I know this comment will get swallowed by the sea of other fans, but I just want to thank you AJR for your incredible music helping me over losing my father in the last week, and for staying true to yourselves and pushing incredible songs one after another. Ever since I heard you guys years ago I cant go a day without listening to at least one of your songs and there isn't a single one I dislike. I'm only 22 and losing my dad to health complications has been soul shredding, your music is on my mind even more helping me every step of the way. Don't ever change🎵
Hey AJR, your love to create music is showing! -And it's ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!
💞
this is one of my fav songs now 🔥
Kinda worried this song wouldnt live up to the huge wait. But it did with flying colors.
Great
They saying goes “all good things take time” and these guys prove it’s true. Wonderful song, amazing video. Makes me appreciate the song and the process they go through to get it out to us. ❤
You guys are the best there is not a single song that I don't like all of your songs are refreshing and not boring
My new favourite song❤
Utterly brilliant!!!....cannot wait for the new album!!!...
This is just adorable ❤
Wow.. 1 and a half YEARS to create this masterpiece.
Tired of The Lazy Song? Introducing: The Dumb Song!
A beautiful song coinciding with an excellent story! Amazing job!
So proud of them :’) it’s been one heck of a journey for them. ❤
Espetacg
One of the absolute best. I love ya'll so much. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.
Jack: Sings main song, helps with chorus and music Ryan: Works on instrumentals and melody Adam: Exists
The amount of work you guys put in songs is worth it.
Great, amazing, Wonderful and Very dumb 🎉
This is amazing, such hard workers, AJR! The song is fire, but the effort put into the video too is just fascinating. 🔥🔥🔥
So... Y'all just didn't notice he's not wearing his signature hat in this video... Like, at all?!
This song seems to take a long time, people caring and helping these people, supporting and caring is amazing. The songs name is misleading, everyone here supports you three, remember. Never give up, just remember the Karma. ;)
YOO IM IN THAT JUNE CROWD
y yo creí que no sonreiría de nuevo...
I was checking ur playlist after not listening to you awhile AND I SAW A NEW PALYLIST ON SPOITFY SOOOO HREE I AM
Just wanna say love ajr, they act like reggae pop is hard 😂 they didn't invent it. If it took them 1 year and a half call them the island pop boys.
this song is awsome
Ajr and cg5 collab??????
There’s literally nothing to hate about this music video. It’s so inspiring and beautiful and I LOVE IT! Super amazing job AJR!
Excellent song!
crazy to think I got married around the same time they started working on this song
I hate concerts but I loved this band so much that I went and was blown away. Seriously, fantastic.
It's so incredible to watch y'all work. My dad came with me to Neotheater and he said you guys were one of the best stage presences he's ever seen. You're so goddamn cool, thanks for the new music ✌💗
Hey. Just put my dog down. this songs reminds me of him already. I love u guys and all u do.
So awesome
For anyone wondering about Adam's sparse presence, I believe this was when he was wrapping up his master's degree.
cool clip
First, worth the time spent on it. You are one of the very tiny few modern musicians I like. Second, the horns remind me of “Christmas in June”
Such a weird yet cool song! This video is a huge inspiration on how good work takes time and I enjoyed seeing how this song came to life.
This had me tearing up thinking about last year's concert
why does the guy with specs looks like milad mirg
It's been less than 2 weeks since I discovered AJR and I just can't get enough of them...
This- this is truly a work of art.
Let's go I've been waiting almost 6 months for a new ajr song
The song felt so ... clean
This comment is a time capsule for the future, anyone who replies can say whatever and look back to see it (one reply per person)
AJR never dissappoint when releasing a new song. With every song you know that it is them yet every song always feel different from one another. Keep up the good work.
#1 #1 burlas
2:40 poor Martin 😂
This song is awesome!
This song is so good  I'm korea fan❤
Song!!!
I'm a cup
Come to Turkey
my favorite song!🎉🎉
Dudes, this is bloody amazing, a whole year and a half of work! Major respect!
Jaisiriram
Is it AJR sounding like A J R or AJR sounding like ajar?
Song came out 2 days ago, found out today, and became obsessed within a day
This song feels like one of the most unique from ajr. This is why its in my top 3 bands ( i only listen to 3 bands so it wasnt hard choosing my top 3)
It seems you guys had fun making this song 😄  That's great 👍😊
I love how much it feels like Christmas in June yet doesnt
Dog approved
This song slaps as hard as a midwesterner slapping their leg before saying, "welp" before getting ready to leave a social gathering. Fr tho, AJR has such a unique sound in all of their music. Love this song and all their music
I love the sing, I even made a meme from it- My brother wasn’t happy ‘til he saw how funny it was-
This was a cool concept executed with precision. Bravo 👏
Without fail AJR puts out a new song, it gets stuck in my head for the next 3 weeks.
This was the most interesting representation of how long it takes to create a song from start to finish :)
This song feels like an amalgamation of every AJR song before it and it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Jack and Ryan just playing Wii Sports Resord ping pong really hits home
It is definitely good to go. We all approve
Devoraron 💋
Pinche canción toda preciosa me subes los ánimos después de una bajoneada de ebriedad y llanto ❤
Every song sounds both similar and completely different, it's awesome!!
THIS IS MY FAVOITE SONG NOW!
Awesome
Esta parte asombrosa 2:50
NF and an AJR collaboration is something I desire in life and would appreciate. That’s my Ted talk thank you
So heartwarming. You have a great life and a bigger future
Can you try making a song called "Why are you like that?"
Ajr brings me joy
I live for videos like this, of the AJR guys just living life and going through the motions but having fun doing it. And this song is hugely relatable to me as well! AJR, you inspire me to live my life the way I want to, regardless of what others say is the "correct" way, and you constantly remind me that there's nothing wrong with keeping that spontaneous, excited, carefree childlike side of me around, even as an adult. You guys are legends. <3
Epic music! 🎵
I love it when my favorite bands turn out to be actually genuinely cool people. Thanks for the new music, well done as always! Looking forward to more from you guys.
Here before this becomes a Tiktok Trend
0:01 HELLO TIMED BETA
my roommate and best friend is graduating soon. one of our best memories together is driving 4 hours to see you guys in Charlotte for the OKO tour. can't wait to see this live when I see her again <3
The amount of hard work and dedication is amazing
This song makes me feel so good, absolutely amazing. I've listened to this more times than I can count now. Keep up the amazing work, you guys have been at the top of my everything for the past few years now. Thank you for everything!
Yeaaaaaa nice song now smallies vilion has a friend xd😂
Muy Bien
Thank you AJR. This song has helped me SO much. A friend from school is changing schools, and I've fallen in love with her, but I've never done anything like that, so I felt like I'd just screw it all up. This song has given me the courage to write a version of this song to give to her next Thursday. I'm just too dumb, but I'm gonna do it  anyway. Wish me luck. #JustTooDumb
Watch the “You should not have done that” become a TikTok trend
That transition in the beggining to the song 🤌
Been listening to AJR for the past 2 years and omg feels good to finally have a band that feels... personal to me : )
good song
Your journey is so inspirational ❤
Bro just threw a dog out the window
This shits acc a banger
i did not think you would make it a "the making of" aswell as the actual song
I ALMOST CRIED OMG THAT WAS SO CUTE ❤
i like a lots
awesome
I thought of the fact thats its very unlikely that ajr will disband bc they are all the same blood Hits hard doesn't it?
i cried of happiness
To think they started with a SpongeBob song
Every song should have a mini documentary version of the official music video! This was excellent, I love learning more about the artists and creators I follow! 💛
I think Chloe, like the guy from the NY subway who did the "Metronome" part in Bang!, is going to end up being the low key real star of the song.
Great to see the process, but reading/watching the screen detracted from the great song
This is A master pièce 🌟🌟🌟🌟
I just wanted to say thank you for all the effort you put into all your songs!
it’s okay martin we still love you
i bet a few weeks or a month this is gonna become a  titok trend
I love AJR🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I hope the new studio adds to their creativity and the new album is going to be an absolute banger! Can't wait for TMM!!
Thank you. Thank you for making such amazing, inspiring music. Your music has gotten me through some tough times, but has also been the music I play for celebrations. You guys are truly an inspiration and I hope you continue to make music for a long time ❤
WOAH THIS IS SUCH A GOOD SONG AND I LOVE THE MUSIC VIDEO.
:)
Wow always putting out good music into the world. Even after all these years
Thanks for sharing your amazing content and talents with us keep it up
one of my favorite music videos i've seen recently :)
First
The band is my all time favorite
Can't believe AJR made a song specifically for orange cats
They aren’t just making music they are telling a story
I've listened to this like 100 times
geil
I've been listening to you guys since "Its On Us" came out! Every song you've made since then tops the one before it! Everything you guys make is just so relatable and amazing! Never stop creating! ❤
I like how in the end jack says "I think it's good to go" bro didn't think they were done
If this was the song for the actual album like the music video I wouldn’t mind I think the music video is actually better then the song that came out but I like both songs either way👍
If EA put this in in FIFA 24 that would be the biggest shithoisery in the world
Good stuff
Did jack go to winter park colorado if so I FUKIN SAW HIM
This is so charming and wonderful. Love it so much!!
I love this song😍
now.. tour in latin america (specially brazil)
Absolutely Great, i love your work and i feel really connected to the beautiful things you create! <3
song is 👍good
If the band ever breaks up, this is gonna be the saddest music video to rewatch in history.
So proud of you boys and so happy you finally get a studio all your hard work is paying  off love you boys so much . 🔥❤️❤️
It doesn't seem like Adam is doing much....
i enjoy this song alot awsome work the ajr brothers 👍
dec 3 is my sons b day🎉
I just kept having morbid thoughts😅... that this song could play very well as a funeral song maybe slowed down and acoustic tho....😂  The the video didn't help me by making me think that this was a happy song. It was more like a celebration of someone that passed recently 😅
You guys are absolutely incredible and me and my family LOVE you!! The way you create music is so unique and beautiful ❤
Hi
i love this
Must be nice to be rich
AJR finally made a decent song?
Just pulled an all nighter and this song was stuck in my head the whole way through! 🤣
I was at your tour stop in Salt Lake City. Amazing show. You were my kids favorite artists and I left that show and started to listen to your songs and figured out I love the band.
I can feel how much fun they had doing this song
Saw you guys in New Zealand, absolutely amazing, love the new song
This is truly beautiful ajr is just so awesome
Keep doing what you've been doing. I love watching you expand.❤🎉🎉
Is this in that new album
Knowing AJR was a great help to me Their song helped me look at myself as I was They cheered me on and gave me joy And now I'm really into this song thank you so much ❤
did ajr actually make a good song?
I love the athmoshpere behind this song! It's done with passion and love and that's what I like about AJR. They are not superstars that would do anything to get people's attention they're just 3 guys with a great team of friends and family who do what they like to do and share it with us. That's how you do great music and get the success you deserve.  THANK YOU !!
Thanks for just being yourself y'all are a rare breed that keeps on making awesome music you deserve all the fame and love
This was released on my brother's birthday!😊
This is definitely one of their more “head-bang” worthy songs. Such hype.
Cmon guys let's blow this up
Idk how ajr does it but every time I'm feeling a certain way a certain one of their songs will come on and I'll connect with it I stg this song came at the perfect time Your my inspiration to continue music and theater after high-school, which is getting to be a ever closer time 💀
My overall favorite music video they have released. I love to see the full story behind everything. This video makes me really happy every time I watch it seeing their faces light up when they know they have something good. I also love the fact it shows that they are just normal people when they aren't working. Enjoying time with people they love, swimming, playing wii. I just love it all. Thank you for the amazing song AJR!
Этой песней можно вспомнить друга по которому скучаешь???
this song for some reason gives me nostalgia, and i love that, like i love ajr
This is sonething else iv been working on, called : crazy kid   why am i the crazy kid always phaseing  always chasing  all those dreams  why am i the crazy kid  that hardly throws a fit just tryin to add an up beat to it cause we cant have any sad music and i wont loose it but fuse it  to use it and make it lit  so why am i the crazy kid not no lazy kid not no dazy kid but a chasing kid go crazy and chasing for my dreams  why am i the crazy kid always phaseing  always chasing  all those dreams  why am i the crazy kid  that hardly throws a fit just tryin to add an up beat to it cause we cant have any sad music and i wont loose it but fuse it  to use it and make it lit  its not just me  cause evryone called me ted bunty  yea thats still a thing evry one called me jefery cant you see im un happy?  but believe me im very much sonething  out of the ordinary even if every one is glaring at me saying im crazy so let me be  (so le le let me be)  its not just me  so why are we crazy  always makeing  are selfs vary  in every little thing were creating  cause being crazy is kinda are thing yea thats still a thing evry one called me jefery cant you see im un happy?  its not just me  so why are we crazy  always makeing  are selfs vary  in every little thing were creating  cause being crazy is kinda are thing
im getting a ajr tattoo mid may!
La música me encantó, es increíble el proceso que tuvieron que hacer para está canción, AJR debe ser eterno, sus canciones son las mejores 💗
El proceso creativo de AJR es tan fascinante, cada canción trae consigo algo que contar. Muchas gracias AJR por todo <3
l Iove ajr❤
This is pretty dumb
🎉
Im a 13 year old, and i wrote s song called insperation. Should i finish and complete it?
Let’s go I have been wating for this !
O M G GUYS. It is simply amazing, and shocking that it took a year and a half to make this, I really enjoyed watching your process because it reminds me that you're humans as me and sometimes, it's not that easy to make something cool, but you never gave up and here we are today. You're my inspiration for never giving up on my dreams if I'm gonna do what I love, thanks!
Love how natural these men are
There was definitely some procrastination
So is Jack skiing in his parachute suit from the Bummerland video, or is he wearing his ski suit while parachuting?  #twosportsonesuit
Immediately went to #1 on my favorite songs list! This had me dancing around my room!
Geniall
THIS IS SUCH A BANGER YOOOO
That so funny😂😂😂😂
I have no words for what this group of 3 young brothers mean to me. I'm stuck in a bad place in life right now and they are my ONLY saving grace. LITERALLY, all I have in my life. I will pull out of this and it will be because of these 3 amazing artists that I do. I can only hope to be able to one day meet them to thank them for saving me. Until then .. I will continue to be their greatest fan and cheerleader. (AKA, stalker... Lol)   Thank you guys for being so real and showing me that life is ok. I love you each immensely.
I wonder if this will go viral...
Honestly saying recent ajr songs don't really stick with me, but hey perhaps it will grow on me when I'm in the condition to be able to relate to it, like way less sad did. Props for you guys 🎉
Watching this right now and thinking about the first time I've heard you all (a good ten years ago)... So much have changed and not much at all, it's difficult to explain. I've always thought "Those guys are funny, hope the get the success they deserve". And here you are, congrats guys!!!  (The ending kinda sound like the end of "I'm ready")
ok, so i was thinking... could chloe possibly be the baby that was crying the day ajr was producing 'weak'??
This video makes me want to live a better life...I wonder if that's what they were going for?
i love the art AJR makes
I love everything about this
You guys knocked it out of the park with this one. Can't wait for TMM.
I too make art in my living room. I’ve been listening to you three since your first album and have been to three concerts. You are my biggest inspiration and give me hope that one day, I too will say I started in my living room and worked my way up through my art. Thank you for all the work you put in to inspire others ❤️
I love that they used their neighbor for the kids voice. That is so sweet.
🫦 HOT LIKE HADES ❤️‍🔥
!Was that TRUE 🤓²?
!IF I had to choose Burn the 🏚️ Down by AJR 😴!
I love it.
!👁️‍🗨️ REALLY like them ALL don't have a favorite! The songs 😂!
!This is ME 🤓👿😎😈!
!ACKNOWLEDGED 💥! !🥶 Ha-lle-lujah!
Nice!
LORD Jesus that is GOOD music! WT🔥!
What are the chances of getting a hug
New AJR is almost the same as new Jon Bellion!
Honest to god you are the reason why I am encourage to make a song myself
Poor Martin
You put this song on my birthday, thank you for filling me up.
this is amazing!
a year and a half??? goddamn
AJR was big inspiration for me to make music. Props to Adam Jack and Ryan
Am I hearing Christmas In June?
OMG YOU GUYS HAVE TO DO ALL YOUR MUSIC VIDEOS LIKE THIS!!   THAT WAS AWESOME Seeing the creativity just rolling all over the place!!  Just SPECTACULAR!!!  INCREDIBLE!!  DYNAMIC!  Showing in a music video HOW the video was thought up, made, reworked for perfection... Just MIND BLOWING AND AWESOME!!  Thank You AJR for this one!!  BRAVO!  Just wish you guys would come to Minnesota, ST. PAUL, not Minneapolis!!  Too much crime! LOLOL (that and st. paul is closer! lol)
I. AM. SO. FRICKING. PROUD.
is that adam’s voice in the back?
LEEEETTTSSS GOOOO
W MUSIC
oh this is making me tear up ;u;
I need to animate this song ASAP bro
The WiiSports Resort 🤌🤌🤌
Realmente no hay algo tan creativo, original y tan valioso como ver el proceso de una sola canción, para el mismo video de la canción. Te hace apreciarla muchisimo más, viendo todo el proceso, el tiempo y todas las personas que estuvieron en este mismo. Siempre admiraré el gran esfuerzo y amor que le ponen a cada una de sus canciones <3 AJR la mejor banda
This was the most amazing experience I've ever had the absolute pleasure to have.. I loved everything about this LITERALLY EVERYTHING you guys are amazing and never cease to completely uplift my entire spirit FREAKING LOVED IT
I was _gonna_ say something basic and lame like "this is positively the dumbest song" and then I saw Jack and Ryan playing WII Ping-Pong together and was flooded with memories this is positively the best song
Heck yeah it was good to go!! I love this new song! You guys are awesome!!! 🎉🎉🎉
This is amazing
I really like how AJR made the transition from course to chorus and how they make each song something special, like in this one. Thank you for putting out such an overwhelming song again, you deserve a lot more attention than you get now. AJR4ever▶✔🖤
YESSSSSS OMG I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH!!!!!!!!! GOOD JOB AJR!!!!!
His forearms look pretty muscular at 2:13, gave me a little inspiration to work out again today
One day I hope to see you guys perform
Love love love love and more love. What can I say, AJR doesn't dissapoint.
Love the video and the song!!
You can feel the brotherhood
so ggod
Voice is sooo crisp!
listening to the mix over and over in the car is so real
I´m obsesse dwith this song , It's a masterpiece for sure. I like everything and every detail about it , it's just so unique and powerful. You're great guys ;)
Hmm
LETS GOOOOOO
Coems🤑
WE NEED A NEW ALBUM PLEEEEASE.
I am soo happy that this is on trending!! Out of everyone you guys deserve it! ❤
I've said it before and I'll say it again. I don't think there's a single song a dislike by you guys.
I like the beat of the song!
I absolutely love this. All of this but s/o to Chloe what a cutie she did amazing
This feels like some end of a wholesome movie type shit.
as i grew, i grew distant from this band, but you know, maybe i've been missing out and i'm now looking forward to their new album if THIS is what they're producing
I LOVE the real look into how your music is made! You guys just accept that you're human and show it to us. That's a really scary thing to do but it absolutely contributes to a unique and, in my personal opinion, a more solid connection to your fan base. The tour was amazing. I loved seeing you guys live. I've now seen 2 concerts and look forward to more in the future. Your energy is contagious and your vibes are immaculate!✨
guao  la verdad me encanto bastante la canción y  todo el proceso e ideas que tuvieron simplemente representa su estilo que me a enganchado  ya durante 6 años  , 😁🎉
I been a long fan and this is a bang
Man why do I always get so emotional watching any video that these guys put out 😭 AMAZING as always!!! Can’t wait for the tour ❤️
Dog :D
I can happily say I was in this music video lol There aren't enough positive adjectives to describe AJR.
Verrry Niiice 👍😁👍
Imagine being friend with such creative people😱
BEGONE ADS I JUST WANN WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE
W
Bro that is so fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I really like this song
Such a cute video :))
❤❤❤
Thank you Mr. AJR :)
So what your saying is that your already writing the next 2 or 3 songs! Cant wait! (No presure by the way Quality over quantity)
CHLOE IS GOATED
I love you guys so much, thank you for this.
When on radio?
YESS this song is so good!!! It’s clear there was so much work and effort and love put into it. It’s definitely one of my favorite from AJR now. So excited to hear more music from them in the future, this album is gonna be great!!
that was amazing!! keep it up!
This is great guys!!! Thanks for this song 👏👏👏
Can somebody tell that waht is this kind of music/beat is called or genre.i wanna discover more of this thing :: Loved the song as always, AJR ❤
🔥
Why is this song so good but it’s called “The Dumb Song” 🥲
I'm here before the 1 million views
It’s amazing
poor Martin, catching strays in the vid...
This sounds like a perfect road trip song to me
Amazing!!!! 💛💛💛 Their friendships are so precious. I'm sooooo grateful they included them in the video. Life is all about living it with the people we love!
Hard to believe half of these songs start from a video game console from 2008
Love the effort you all put into your work and how happy it all makes you, please don’t stop
Suprised the lyrics is what took the song a year and half to do. Not surprised the production didn’t because of AJR musical capability. But the video must of took some time to edit over the coarse of time. The sci-fi sound is unreal what a single been worth the wait ❤🔥
Wait is this melody is just a sped up version of Christmas in June?  Still a banger either way.
EEEE IM OBSESSED
This is one of those out of the box kind of AJR, gotta love it man
I absolutely love both the song and the music video!❤ you guys did such a good job as always!
AJR has been my favorite band since I had a favorite band. Can't image music without them.
2023 you will always be my favorites:3 AJR FOREVER
ALSO I LOVE THE PUPPER!!!!
2:03-2:04 was me when I got to go see AJR lol (not actually that wasn’t me in the clip but same spirit)
I have a whole playlist dedicated to you guys
I’ve been  a singer, songwriter, and audio engineer for a couple years now, and by far, AJR has been the biggest inspiration for my music, the creativity, the joy, the message they put through, and overall it’s so well orchestrated and mixed that they are a genre themselves, they’re AJR. Every song I release I send to them personally in hopes that maybe one day they’ll hear my song and get a big idea as well. Thank you for making the music that you do. I hope to one day see you perform live, if not maybe meet you in person.
Wow I'm so proud of you!! Congrats on the new studio <3
thank you for your hard work, I would truly love to see you on a concert, and this video is also great, showing the process and your autenticity like band and friends <3 I did the right choice making you my fav band  <3 time to hear this in loop, and I'm proud how big you are now <3
Imagine having siblings that are this close in friendship, have same hobby of creating song, and  and like each other enough to have a music band together for so many years, their parents probably didn't expect them to blended together this well
this song is great.
This video just shows how music is fun it's a celebration and collective effort and a way of life for AJR, it's just soo wonderful 🥺🥺🥺❤
Why does this song sound SOOO FAMILIAR
Ofc this has like a million views already
Can’t wait to hear this on the radio!
This. I love this. 😊
AAAA Hahahaha! Yes! It’s here! I love this song so much! Thank you Ajr!
How do you guys always make songs that always feel in line with life events I'm going through like right when i need them it's uncanny
给人感觉笨笨的，但是还在努力做自己热爱的感觉！超爱AJR❤ 无论多失落有AJR都能快乐起来😊
The only band that I love all their songs…the ones already released and those yet to come ❤️
I love it
this is extremely creative! LOVE YOU AJR!!!!
Mr. Netanyahu should know that taking a picture with Reza Pahlavi, whose grandfather was in close political and military cooperation with Hitler and the Nazi army, is a betrayal of the blood of the Holocaust victims.
proud, amazed, impressed, in awe all understatements I LOVE AJR
my daughter is 9 and AJR has been her FAVORITE band for 3 years now.  We went to see them in Austin last spring and it was the best.  Her face was PRICELESS.  she squealed when i was like "they posted a new song 12hrs ago"
Here before this song goes on tiktok
something about this song paired with this music video makes me incredibly happy
YIPPEE ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE WITH YOUR MUSIC‼️‼️‼️‼️
Now I'd like to know who came up with the idea for "You should not have done that!" I love little lines like that, it reminds me of when he would say GO! Or Hows it go again in sober up.
FIREEEEEEE SONGGGGGG!! THE DUMB SONG IS HEEEREE
This song is excellent just like how AJR put their effort into it!
Love this song so much.
AJR must be really tired after making this for so long. Anyway, I'm grateful for you guys, congratulations!! 🎉 Hope to hear more from you guys soon...i can't wait
Never thought this would make me cry😂😂
I love you AJR
ice? or SPICE?
Ahhh I'm obsessed! Knowing how much thought, time and effort that has gone into this song makes it even better to listen to and appreciate. I love all of the extra people that have helped to contribute to the outcome, the style of this video and the overall vibe this song gives you. I literally listened to this on repeat, and my mood was lifted. You've got to make a documentary or something more extensive about how you made the upcoming songs, I would be so interested to see the highs and lows of it. Love, love, love ❤
WOAHHHH! THIS SOUNDS AMAZING! You have exceeded my expectations!
Oh yeah, I'm smart enough to figure out that I'm dumb!
Absolutely amazing that AJR didn’t give up on this song even though it took a year and a half. That is dedication! Wild to think I saw them on tour in Southampton whilst they were doing this too! AJR really are the best ❤
I’d say something but I can’t think of any words…  Well, except for: THIS IS 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
3:52 idk why but the fade to the car audio is just so cool
For a song called dumb, it was pretty smart of them to kill 2 birds with one stone. They made a documentary and a song at the same time
This is such a great song. So so worth the wait and the excitement you guys built up. And the video is such a cool insight into the process.
i'd love to see more music videos of this format because it shows that making music isn't always rainbows and unicorns and leprechauns and gold pots and four-leaf clovers. they also included the parts in making music where that may not be the case and that they're struggling to come up with things which is very refreshing to see
What an amazing video! Just discovered you guys a few months ago! One of my favourite bands/artists. Please come to Toronto in your tour
another banger with an amazing and original music clip
I would really like to see AJR abandon their weird critically panned theatre kid schtick to swivel into being a Ska band, this song is ace
I don't care if it took a year and a half. If an AJR song is going to come out, one or another I will wait however long it takes to make said song. It doesn't matter if it takes two years or maybe five just to get a new AJR song, I would wait as long as I need to.
Es hermoso como disfrutan de hacer música! Hasta compart3n con sus seres queridos. Es un gran mensaje el que dejan con este video. Además, BUENÍSIMA CANCIÓN como siempre haciendo arte Ajr❤
World tour without Brazil is not world tour 😢
This is really good. Well done AJR!
WOW, I've got THE DUMB SONG on replay, the video is soo creative and fun!
I finally found my favorite jam😂❤
i leg how they have so many people working with them this is a great song!
This whole video made me so indescribably happy ❤
Incredible work as usual guys
This is crazy good! You guys inspire me to be so much!
Wii sports ping pong! 3:37
absolutely amazing. u guys are geniuses
It's a good thing you guys approved this one, because this one is amazing
Can’t believe they would just put Marty like this
I love it ❤🎉😂
People loved seeing Ryan making the songs live and he got tired of it, and just show it in the music video lmao
Waiting for your concert in India ❤
Thank you. Just, thank you.
Just imagine. Without the technology we have been provided today, this masterpiece might not have been around. Their use of just FaceTime to get what they needed for this song is incredible.
I love the lyrics
Chloe signing is the cherry on top 🍒❤
Love
I am just tooo dumb...😢❤
Si ser un tonto se siente así, quiero ser tonto durante toda mi vida
This was amazing!!! ❤❤❤
This video adds so much more meaning to the song. Absolutely love it. ❤
man, i really love the harmony on this one.. love y'all AJR! ❤
NF said in an interview if he collabed with anybody, it would be AJR.  I need this in my life!  Also, great video!
WHO care about the critics. I think these guys are great.
👍
they're literally musical geniuses. and that is exactly why i stan.
Love the song
Whole song with making history is just like a suupppeeeerrrrr well made movie
Feels super genuine. Really cool video.
i official take this song to be my theme song thank you very much
Ilikeme
I love when artists show just how much TIME goes into making music. Showing how much love and effort and energy goes into making a single song sound just right means that new artists who dont understand why they're not able to do something INSTANTLY get a chance to understand why. They get to see "oh professionals take a long time too" and then start to actually work on their skills. I LOVED this music video. Best one of theirs by far.
My favourite part is Chloe, you should not have done that! ❤ Go Chloe!
.
I’m writing a story and most of it is inspired by your songs😊
i fucking love you guys perfection
getting called out in the best sounding way possible
Wow, just wow. A year and a half, around Christmas in June production. AJR, I’ve always admired you, but this is true dedication, such an underrated band.
THE BEST SONG EVER YOUR GONNA WIN A OUSAR
Liked this kind of cool music idea, interesting to me..
we need jutice for our boy martin
I wasn't into the song initially but having this video with it really gave it much more depth and character. Quite enjoyable now.
good job
As a Nintendo fanboy, I really enjoyed the scene where they play wii sports resort :)
everything about this was brilliant this took a YEAR AND A HALF!? well good on you for not giving up and leaving this on a shelf! 💕🫀💕🫀💕🫀💕
This is now my favourite AJR music video 🫶🏼
Ngl, this song gets Better and Better if you keep re-listening it !!
AJR deserves all the fame in the world and more. One of the best songs this year! Keep going at it!
Yoo
You guys should have a studio tour
i like how uncomfortable martin is
This video was awesome! A yea and a half was worth the wait for this masterpiece❤🔥.
Nailed it again.
This has been my favourite music video so far, its always so cool to see the brothers behind the faces they put on for the public. This song is so unique and one thing ive noticed with these songs for the new album is that none of them have that huge bass drop or booming drop that most pop songs have these days. Love how you boys always manage to stay unique in a world of remixes and reboots!!!
My husband and I just listened to this song and I absolutely love it, especially the video. Good Job!
My wife approves of this
Beautiful
😄😄😄
great :>>>
I SHOULD HAVE COMMENTED THIS VIDEO WHEN I SAW IT 25 MINS
Finally.
You guys got there really close to the Beatles. It's like they wrote a new song. Big applause!
Jesus Christ Loves YOU all❤❤❤
The titles they come up with tho
Respect😮
This Actually shows the production of the song Wow
okay why am I crying
So amazing! Easily one of then best music videos ever! I love ajr so much and me and my family are really hoping they come to our city on the next world tour!
ugh i love you guys
The dairy of a dum song
This music vid is so wholesome especially because we’re seeing them having fun during this process, making friends, bringing joy to others and living life in general. Thank you so much AJR for this masterpiece❤
Just the greatest introduction ever TvT
Hi
💝
OMG IT'S SO DUMB!🎉🎉🎉🎉
This is anything but a dumb song
Lol cool loved it
the only thing i want from this song is for it to be longer
besides taylor swift these guys are GOAt
and just like that this song became one of my favorite music video of all time
By far my favorite song from AJR so far. However World's Smallest Violin comes at a very close 2nd for me. Idk, it's just something about The Dumb Song, It's just so inspirational and I've listened to it for hours now, makes me feel some sort of happy, like it peaks my dopamine levels, especially when watching the music video. It feels like I'm part of something, I don't really know how to explain it. It just makes me feel warm and cozy. World's Smallest Violin makes me pumped and energetic, something that I can listen to at a late night and get my mood up. Finally, I hold this song dear as it is a very good song and the thing that made me get into AJR in the first place, which is Bang!. It's honestly such a good song and once again, comes very close to World's Smallest Violin.
hope yall know youre global inspiration😂😅
The thought and detail that goes into every second of their songs is truly amazing! AJR is exceeding the limits of music!
This is actually decent. Do more of this and less of the Disney animation inspired stuff.
it's so beautiful
This might have been foreshadowed in Turning Out pt ii in the line "Now I'm here writing this dumb song"
I wish I could be friends with these guys they seem so nice
Make a documentary, pls
Looove it
Im so inlove with these three
Hola me mostraron esta canción
You did it,150k views in under 1 day!
I love the small motifs from Christmas in June, except a bit less ad and more party like
I love this type of music video! More so than recording a performances witn different green screen backdrops. This type of video makes you feel invited to watch your process when making a song. I honestly felt emotional watching this ❤ Loved this!!
Reminds of the times I used to make music videos with my friends, all the stupid fun stuff comprised into a single video like montage
You guys should honestly be so proud of this one, it paid off so well, the music video is really creative and cute too. This is why we love AJR. Well done guys, can't wait for TMM!
NOGLA
Nice
Your songs always touch me in some way that makes my day better, knowing I'll wake up everyday and being able listen to your songs give me motivation to get out of bed and be happy, you guys are amazing 💖🎶💖
The instrumental definitely takes inspiration from Christmas in June right? Like no way I’m imagining it??
I enjoyed this storytelling format thoroughly ❤
I am literally in tears right now. Great work AJR, please keep doing this stuff!❤
My love for this band grows deeper every day. Thank you so much for sharing your music with the world, it truly makes everything better!
Love the song❤
i had to use a VPN to listen this song
Me seeing USANA amphitheater: "omg I'm in an AJR video?????"
You sticky pickle
Nice hope ajr stay forever
I love the video, and I do really like the song, but the abrupt transition from Jack's regular voice in the first two verses to the chorus sounds jarring to me. Other than that, fantastic work as always.
Well I hit repeat!
Your music helps me get up from bed every day. Thank you for making this beautiful music
I love this music video! Watching AJR make their song in this music video is incredible!!! This song is amazing I love it!!! And the part when they were on tour I remember seeing them in person in Hawaii with my Mom it was amazing!!!  This is my favorite music video!!! AJR thank you for making these incredible music for everyone to hear your music is inspiring, beautiful, and creative I love all your songs you guys are amazing!!!😄❤️ 4:03
a fucking mazing
Why does this song sound like a slowed down version of the 90's group Dance Hall Crashers song Lost Again.
YESSS
What an adventure.  Thanks for sharing it with us!
I don't know how guys, but when my life gets bored or bad, you launch a new song a make my days more funny
cant wait to listen i bet it will be as good as i think it will be!!!!!!  I lied, it was better!!! (Also congrats on getting a studio!)
Instantly a favourite.  Well done once again!
I love them so much!!!!!!
Fucking grand! Love it so much! Never fail to keep putting out really fantastic music!
THIS IS SO GOOD! I love AJR! I saw them at the AT&T center before they blew up. It was the first time I heard them sing "Weak" and I was like this is my new favorite song! AJR is an awesome band and they have so many unique songs that have super catchy melodies. Keep going guys, love hearing new music
Love itttttt
The dumb song is awesome
this makes me so happy!! T-T
it ain't no AJR sound without the background trumpets! 🔥🔥🔥
Amo a AJR se nota que ponen cada parte de si, en todas sus canciones, por eso me encanta esta banda (⁠◍⁠•⁠ᴗ⁠•⁠◍⁠)⁠❤
This is a 10/10 song  Keep up the great work
I’m in love
Remembers
CANT WAIT FO THE ALBUM AND TOUR  GOING ON MY BIRTHDAY
It's kinda awesome that jack still has the bummerland suit.
luv it❤❤
love u AJR
so good
Thx for the best 2 years for me. I LOVE YOU AJR!
This song is just so pretty
THEYRE SO GENUINE AND FUN AND LOVING AND HUMAN I LOVE THEM
I loved watching the whole process!
This feels like how I feel around people but fun? I feel called out but also I wanna sing
진짜 행복하다...
Excellent work! I am your big fan. Good luck!
I love this song❤ this song bit is very good I love Ajr
My favorite thing about this song is that it shows how we aren’t machines. We make art because of the pleasure of expressing ourselves, and that can take time. We weren’t meant to be corporate machines. We were made for art.
Love this sound. Excited for the album.
AJR back with another banger as usual!  Very different seeing Jack without his hat!😮  But it is cool seeing how the three brothers have been doing lately, so yeah.  I LOVE YOU ADAM, JACK, AND RYAN!❤️🤩
Very nice to hear! The melody is very comfortable and finally can add a nice new song to my music list😍😉
🥹💜🙌🏼
I stayed up till midnight last night to listen to it, and I had exams today, so I don’t think a performed well, but it’s worth it for AJR!
Esta canción me encanto apenas la escuche, espero que AJR siga y siga creciendo enserio hacen musica fantástica y sobre todo con una letra que transmite emociones.
watching this just makes me happy.
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Is amazing
As expected from AJR !!! Such a bang!!!
this  is  so good, i love  it
this song is so good holy shit!! im absolutely loving this new era of ajr, im so excited for this next album to come out!
I love to see the creative process and behind-the-scenes of the making of such a tremendous song!
12 hours late sorry
Super cool to see all the different cultures and languages in the comments.
Can we talk about Chloe?❤
THE GUITAR IN THE BEGINNING IS SO FIRE
THIS WAS FREACKING AWESOME HOLY CRAP
Arnetta did a really good job with the trumpet.
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a *BANGER ALERT!!!* 🚨🚨
nice work ajr
Worth the wait 100 percent
Spoiler: Chloe is also the baby who cried in the neighboring apartment creating the chorus for Weak
Legendary.
nice job guys
Thank you AJR I will continue to blast this everywhere I go
I can't wait to see you live again! Your gig in Melbourne, Australia was EPIC! You guys are legends 🥰❤
This is so great!
i love the song and this video so so much. thank you for sharing the process with us and i can't wait for TMM!!! (the music man/men??)
I caught on to the beat right away. Already love this song
The way AJR put recordings of the behind the scenes rather than a typical choreography of a music video made this song even more special. Thank you AJR for this banger, for sure this will be on loop for hours!
me encanta que sea un video de como crearon la cancion, no solo se nota el tiempo y esfuerzo que invirtieron, si no que se nota MUCHO el amor que tienen por lo que hacen.
watching the process and timeline  of the making of this song made me smile throughout the entire thing ❤
My neurodivergent ass can 100% relate to this song (as with most all AJR songs) love it. Absolutely looking forward to the release of TMM.
First viewed with 11k views yesterday. And now already 100k? No doubt for a banger song!
Songs just keep getting better
Dammmmmn que gran canción!
You should of ended the vide with “you think it will go viral?” “Yep!”
La música me encantó, es increíble el proceso que tuvieron que hacer para está canción, AJR debe ser eterno, sus canciones son las mejores 💗
lets be honest AJR is really really unique in the way they handle their music, absolute legends. this was a banger song. those one and a half years were spent well
Oh my boys
DoveyTHEDUM SONGAJR
YAY!
Look,                👌
personaly great video, but i cant feel the song like for example karma or the whole click album
I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH!!!
Apart from the song being absolutely insane, the video is so engaging and by far one of my favorite music videos. 👏
Nice work for the music and hope you make another one called the asylum song.your bud Emmy owen
My favorite videoclip so far 💖
one of the best ajr songs
I appriciate the confidence and effort they put in their songs
ska isnt dead.
It's amazing to see how much work goes into making this sort of song.  It's to be expected that it takes a lot to make something to great, but even still.
Eu n tenho palavras pra descrever o quanto eu AMO essa banda, eles são meus preferidos dos preferidos, eu estava ansiosa pela música nova, e tá incrível, obrigada, AJR
Yet another banger! Thanks for all the great head bops you give me everyday! Also thanks for this type of official video it's awesome seeing you guys this way. Much more human and it's great!
Omg!!!! This is beautiful 💛 this is a story in a video I love! AJR forever awesome ✨ it's just too dumb to not listen to the masterpiece
Obsessed with this song <3
Thiis song is "The" Dumb Song
We still love you, Martin, tone deaf or not🫡
I think you should make Chloe a full-time, honorary part-time member
He escuchado sus canciones desde ya un tiempo, más o menos cuando aún no eran tan conocidos por Small Violin, y no puedo expresar como me siento en este momento. Siento una mezcla de orgullo con nostalgia y felicidad. Los amo mucho AJR, espero que en un futuro próximo pueda escucharlos cantar en un concierto❤
I feel like the trumpet player and the drummer could create their own band their both so good.
At 1:48 is that the bummerland suit? XD
This is actually probably one of my favorite music videos now. It’s so creative and interesting to see how long the song-making process can be (and how many people get involved in it!!)
one of the best music videos ive seen, thanks for all you’re hard work!! can’t wait to see what happens in the future:)
This sounds like one of the most AJR songs AJR have ever made.
God song
I love this we need a behind the scenes on every video or documentary
I LOVE how wholesome it is just a bunch of friends having fun making music in there rooms being some of our favorate music of all time it is just amazing
ESTOY LLORANDO LAGRIMAS, MUCHAS LAGRIMAS
Ok so a year and half for one song... How long for the next album???
i'm in love
ajr back with another banger
this is such an awesome song.
That was easily the coolest music video I've ever seen and I wish every music video were like this. SO cool to see the behind the scenes in real time with the song!!
you guys have come so far, I'm glade to see you guys are still doing well
I think it is safe to say that they need a documentary about their lives and what it was like rising to the top at such a fast rate
Perfect 👍
Just another reason why I love AJR.
Great song, I've been listening to this over and over again
Magnific 🎉
S tier song and you're still my favorite music artist
I think is one of my favourite songs that u guys made yet♥️:D
You guys are incredible, please never stop
I love that the video gives us all a look into the whole creative process of creating the song 😊
This song is concrete proof that the best things take the longest time
Unfitting name, the song is absolutely without a doubt positively most definately one of my favorite singles by them
it would be sad if ajr peaked and we didnt even know
making the bts the actual music video is super creative! love the song
There are so many things that separate you guys from mainstream artists in such an amazing way literally my favorite song never thought anything could beat out don’t throw out my legos🎉
I actually love this song this is now my 5th favorite song, I really really know they put good effort in this, and I really love when they show how long they have been making the song, Keep it going AJR! An
A year and a half of dedication to one song. Thats crazy. I wish yall the best!
there should be a love button on YouTube
Martin is tone deaf 😭🤣
Wow, that was a journey in around 4 minutes. crazy.
Who is here from Dans discord
It's such a breath of fresh air to see new and original music from genuine people who just love to create stuff. AJR is simply amazing!
Love the vibe this song has :)
Oml this is just so amazing, I love the part where the little girl has a line
congratulations.
Woooooooo
Masterpiece!
Yo this is good, I get good kid vibes and that’s a good thing
I’ve been waiting for so long and is finally out :D
All the hard work has well and truly paid off!  Love it!  Well done lads!
Thank you so much for making this AJR, I can’t believe you guys spent a year and a half working on this❤
every footage/scene on this music video have a meaning and it's so wonderful❤
I love this This is amazing
AJR. is... genuinely special. there aren't many groups that come out with music as passionate as this.
Cara vim para nesse canal maravilhoso em 2022 no começo e toda música que escuto e boa isso porque não gosto muita músicas ajr e cg5.cade os brasileiros?
The work has paid off😊
the way i have an exam in 4 hours i think im going to fail, this made my day <3
One of my biggest inspirations in music today. Excellent work!
The amount of love, care and effort these guys put into their songs is amazing! I love this band so much 😭
DS in 2023? It's rare
AJR as a team should be very happy
Yayayayaya
I been waiting for this all day,thanks Jack.
I watched this in class lol
you guys inspired me to play drums
This song ends in such a great way, i cant describe it but there’s a feeling in that ending that I’ve only ever heard in Beatles songs.
love this song :)
Loved this!! ❤
Hey just like me!
I absolutely love this song!!! You guys have inspired me to start making music. It's kinda hard, but I'm trying to figure it out lol... thank you for being so inspiring and making amazing music!!!
This was worth the wait. Great song!
I think it’s good to go, *proceeds to tweak the vocals for the next two weeks*
This might be the first time I have ever seen a Music Video where it is the creation of the song, rather some storytelling related to the song, or just some way to flex VFX, etc.
esto es un picaso
great song
this song is the best
stream the dumb song 🤍
I love this song I love this video I love this band
This song looks like it was a blast to make! Great job!
One of my favorite music videos and I don't even know why. Maybe it's the story behind it. Maybe it's that bit where "Oh my god that sounds so-"
Ik I’m not the only one that knows every song of there’s is just *chef’s kiss* It’s crazy how things like songs can be a whole journey in itself, along with the journey or story that it’s meant to tell Also “Martin is tone-deaf” lmfao
Cant stop listening to his song 👍👍👍 🔥🔥.
This song is awesome!
i love this i clicked as soon i as it came out!!!!
Welldone guys love all ur songs this the best one yet 😄
Love it but please add a stroke to subtitles so they can be read easier plz T_T
wwwwwwwoooooooo love the song and you guys
Oh my god they finally got a studio! I'm so proud of how far they've come. And the song is amazing!! Thank you guys for everything!
I have no idea the emotion that I just felt, something like nostalgia and contentment, but it’s a nice feeling
this is my favorite song and video. this is absolutely amazing.
Year and a half well spent! What an amazing song!!!
❤❤❤
Such a great song!!!!
como que hace 8 horas XD
It’s so cool to see the production of this song. The first time I heard it I wasn’t too hooked, but now for some reason, this song sounds amazing. Good job guys! Looking forward to TMM. Is this gonna be on the album or is it a single?
Bro I vibe with this song too much! Another banger as using AJR!!
Such a cool video and song! You guys have come so far!❤
Your songs will never cease to brighten up my day bcuz there relatable😀
This song is perfect for when I’m doing my homework
A year and a half well spent I think. I listen to A LOT of music, and I mean A LOT. Music has always been my way to escape my stress, and since I discovered AJR, I have enjoyed every moment of their music. And when I listen to their music, I find that I can decode so many different messages from each song, and relate to each one in multiple different ways. I have never been able to call a piece of music a masterpiece before, but this right here is it, this is genuinely the most perfect song I have ever heard, good job AJR. :)
I LOVE THIS
New song its so legend already support this channel i really love your songs
God!!! I fucking love them!!!!
My fiance and I just watched it and we both cried just because we love you so much and that was so good. Ajr has seriously helped us through so much shit and been the only thing keeping us going some days. Today has been one of those days so it was perfect timing for the release for us. Thank you.
new song lets go
Year and a half? Damn. That's so much effort into one thing and gives me a bit of motivation to complete my one thing I've been working on since Jan 2022.
Very Cool!
This my personal theme song
Here since let the games begin song!! Keep it up guys and u r welcomed to cone to Spain 🤍
Wholesome video!❤
I aparecciate all your effort to this song, video, and all your work, love you AJR!!!
Omg I can’t believe you guys got a studio after 17 years!!<3 Also I was so surprised when I found out the “you should not have done that voice” was your neighbor! I thought it was Ryan!
I love this so fucking much, they fail to disappoint
Awee my heart. I’m literally crying. One of my new favorite songs and the video is so sweet😭
HEY GIRL GET ONLINE NEW AJR SONG
Not only is it another a great song, but I love the video! And so many of the lines are just so me!
I was at the Oklahoma tour on June 7 2022!
AND ITS A STRAIGHT BANGER!!!!!!!!
Love it another banger
Here before this blows up on TikTok
Wow, I love watching you guys create music, and to think that it took some years to make the song, wow it definitely was worth it, cause this song is great
Absolutely amazing idea to do a behind the scenes as a music video. Whoever's idea that was, they are genius.
The absolute time, effort and passion put into this song is something we can truly appreciate.
Me encanta como en este video podemos apreciar la canción y el gran esfuerzo que hubo detrás de ella  AJR simplemente hace arte :3 🌟
This is amazing and I love everything you guys do. Can't wait for TMM, I'll be thinking about the creation process for all of the songs haha! This montage made me feel like I've been a part of the band this whole time and I'm just looking through the old albums. Love you guys!
They make the creative process look so much fun! They’re so inspiring!
Gracias por semejante joyita, los amo fuerte
AMO lo originales que son, se merecen todo lo bueno ❤
I can say that I hyped this song up sense I saw the first teaser on ajr early releases
Seeing a music video like this fills me with energy and joy unlike anything else I've seen. So creative and the song was treated with such love by the AJR team! We love your hard work guys. 🤩
Finally I love the melody that ahhhhhhhh in the start and I like when we go down king up come don’t look at me a just to dumb and like the dadadadadadadadada
A YEAR AND A HALF???
Just amazing, thank you
ajr i love you sob
横浜に来るのを楽しみにしてるー！
Heck yes 🔥 🔥
The story is as good as the song. Fantastic.
The music and storytelling 10/10
This is my favorite music video ever
👍
I feel dumb for some reason
This song is the definition of AJR. A good standard for them. It's a bit weird, a bit catchy, and has these odd moments which just fit somehow.
I’m considering this song a late birthday gift from ajr
진짜 노래 하나하나가 다 좋다..
I am so happy they come to my country that was amazing, you can really see their dedication and love for their music
Listened to it once before watching the video and I wasn’t too crazy about it. I think the video converted me
3:08 is my favourite part
MASTERPEICE!!! WHEN IS THE ALBUM COMING OUT?
This album is going to be amazing, it's crazy to see how much their musicianship has evolved already scince ok orchestra
Wow this is really good!
NOOOOOOOOO Harambe!!!!!!!!! why WHYYY!!!!!!!!
btw i cant stop listening to this
I need to see one of those concerts
I think it’s worth a year and a half
We love you!
So wholesome
That was AWESOME!!!! You guys are doing this so different and it’s perfect❤
I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH THIS IS LITERALLY HIW MY CHILDHOOD WAS LIKE IN A SONG
This is AJR
You never disappoint
Ajr is still one of the best bands ever and so underrated
Absolutely w song
I love everything you guys release. I was in the top .5 percent of listeners on Spotify this year. Your music has been there with me for everything important in my life, and I know it’ll continue to be. I get this song. I struggle with self esteem, and though I’m pretty book smart and creative, I often miss the obvious and am criticized for it. I had been dealing with this recently, and this song had not have been timed more perfectly. You’re probably not gonna see this, but on the off chance someone is, I just want to thank you for your music.
I love seeing what went into making this!! Such a good song, the year and a half efforts really paid off!!!
Yes!! I’ve been waiting for this!! :DDD and, I’m so happy you gotten this song done!! Congrats!!
W, that’s all I have to say, W
This is how life of AJR song
This song will def be on my most listened list! And I loved Chloe’s line!!! Thank you for all of the music, you guys are the best!
I think this might be one of their best songs
For a while, I've been calling myself dumb. So when I heard this song it sounded relatable because I don't understand what people are trying to tell me so this song is perfect!
Love it. Love all the guests you have collaborating on this too!
Another amazing song, thank you ❤
✝️🙏🏻❤️🎧🔥
Another masterpiece!!
It's lived up to the teasers 😍
Otra rolasa por parte de AJR
I love it ❤❤❤❤ ajr supremasi
OBRA DE ARTEEE ❤❤❤
Wooooow men this is so ❤❤❤❤❤
everyone WAS laughing at you... but no longer like they used to
Oh my gosh I love this video! I love how rather than an average music video you guys showed the process and everyone who contributed to make the song what it is, I find it so interesting! Well done everyone and I wish y’all the best!! :D
AJR - The Dumb Song  Oh, in my head  You said with certainty I may be the dumbest person That you've ever seen You think you're hurting Bet you won't believe it But you kinda set me free  You've mentioned Adderall Slip this guy a sedative He's bouncing off the walls  Honey, it's no big deal We'll get you back to college You could study something real  So if that's how you feel  When we go down When kingdom come Don't look at me, don't look at me I'm just too dumb I'd love to stay, but like you said Don't look at me  Cause I got nothing in my head  Oh, in my head  Too dumb for breaking up I'd do it in person, but I'd probably mess it up I'll text you, that's enough That's how empty headed people Get through shitty stuff  Your world is ending soon Mine's a little bit better Cause I never watch the news You make my lunch today I would do it But I couldn't work my microwave  So if that's what you're saying  When we go down When kingdom come Don't look at me, don't look at me I'm just too dumb I'd love to stay, but like you said Don't look at me Cause I got nothing in my head  Oh, in my head  You should not have done that!  When we go down When kingdom come Don't look at me, don't look at me I'm much too dumb I'd love to stay, but like you said Don't look at me Cause I got nothing in my head  Oh, in my head Oh, in my head  When we go down When kingdom come Don't look at me, don't look at me I'm just too dumb
This is so great! Love all that goes into your music and the fun times y'all have together! Makes me want to start a band haha!
Your love of music is infectious.
No way new song
What an amazing story! People don’t realize how long it takes to make music!
What an amazing story! People don’t realize how long it takes to make music!
I love these guys so much 😂
This is my new favorite song
🔥🔥🔥
Love this song, y'all keep getting better and better.
I love this video but I really wanna see another music video for this that isn’t a montage
El proceso creativo de AJR es tan fascinante, cada canción trae consigo algo que contar. Muchas gracias AJR por todo <3
I LOVE IT AND I LOVE YOU
It was a very nice video and I love seeing where you guys make the videos
OMG🇦🇷🐐😱
THIS SONG IS AMAZING!!❤
All their songs just feel so alive, I love them. Can't wait for the next song already
Oh didn't see this lol I just saw the visualizer
Finally it came out
PLEASE im begging for a concert of you guys in Monterrey, México pleasee
i was here
It's crazy that they've been working on this for a year and a half
I found myself smiling throughout the whole video
This shows how truly talented you guys are! You don't need some unknown person writing your songs or creating the music. You do it yourself! Have loved your music for years now!
that year and a half definitely payed off
Love the new song!  As a voiceover guy I have to ask: What kind of mic are you guys recording on? :)
You’d think that after all these years AJR’s music would get repetitive or lose its charm but it never does, every song yall drop feels like it speaks straight to me. You have to stop making such good songs I can’t pick a fav!! I love it when I can hear pasts melodies in new music! Never stop following your dreams guys you won’t ever be forgotten your music will last forever
Love the dedication ❤️
This was posted 5 hours ago but I already have so much love for this song! And the fact you included your 7-year-old neighbour and college friends is really wholesome.   This is EXACTLY why I fell in love with your music. ❤
This is such a cool music video!
OH MY GOSH. This song. I'm no5 even halfway through listening to it for the first time and I already love it. Another crazy good song, as always, AJR ❤
✨️BEAUTIFUL✨️
Worth the wait
i wish i could hear this song for the first time again
absolutely incredible work as always AJR, might just be my new favorite!! can’t wait for the new album-really hoping for an overture!
Dog
you're amaaaaaaaaaaaziiiiing🥳
3:34 this is WINTER?????!!!??!
This song is so whimiscal and childish, but in the best way possible.
Oh guys this is so cute, I love the story you're telling and it's so incredible to see a little bit of your lives and friends. It's so wholesome!
So far my favorite song of 2023!
Very tolerable song congrats AJR
The Dumb Song - That dumb song that loomed over AJR for 1 and a half years
Such an amazing song I really love the work you guys put in to these song I went to your concert during last September that was very fun keep up the good work ❤
:.)
Amazing video!
Just so casual at the end🤣
i love you guys so much! your music is so awesome!
LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH Can't wait to see you guys live.
Crying rn, I’m so proud of AJR and how far they’ve come. Once again, another amazing hit and a hard hitting song at that. Keep being amazing 💖
Happy Friday! Now this song is stuck in my head for the weekend. 🙂
🔥🔥🔥
heres da lyrics :D   Oh in my head You said with certainty I may be the dumbest person That you’ve ever seen You think you’re hurting me Betcha won’t believe it  But you kinda set me free  You’ve mentioned Adderall Slip this guy a sedative He’s bouncing off the wall Honey it’s no big deal We’ll getcha back to college You could study something real So if that’s how you feel  When we go down When kingdom come Don’t look at me Don’t look at me I’m just too dumb I’d love to stay But like you said Don’t look at me Cause I got nothing in my head Oh in my head  Too dumb for breaking up I’d do it in person But I’d probably mess it up I’ll text you, that’s enough That’s how empty-headed people Get through shitty stuff  Your world is ending soon Mine’s a little better cause I never watch the news You make my lunch today I would do it But I couldn’t work my microwave So if that’s what you’re saying  When we go down When kingdom come Don’t look at me Don’t look at me I’m just too dumb I’d love to stay But like you said Don’t look at me Cause I got nothing in my head Oh in my head  (You should not have done that)  When we go down When kingdom come Don’t look at me Don’t look at me I’m much too dumb I’d love to stay But like you said Don’t look at me Cause I got nothing in my head Oh in my head Oh in my head  When we go down When kingdom come Don’t look at me Don’t look at me I’m just too dumb
"You should noooot have done that" is my favorite part
LOVE IT!!!!
I LOVE this music video so much. You guys have so much pride for the songs you create and its felt immensely everytime you break down its production. For me, every time you guys explain how you made your music it elevates that song so much. This is probably my favorite music video ever, made the song much more hype and i just love seeing behind the scenes so much
This movie has great music.  I cried and laughed. Thanks.
"Martin is tone-deaf" xD

Yall have helped me so much these past few years! Thank you Adam Jack and Ryan! Especially with the release of The DJ is Crying for Help. That song got released the day of my discharge from the US Army. I was in BCT and tore my meniscus. I was going back home and didn't know how to feel. I was in the St. Louis Airport, and heard the song. Something about it was just soothing. Whenever I don't feel like I'm enough I listen to that song specifically. It just helps me so much. Thank you.
I'm sure this song is going to be just as awesome as all his other songs.
I love songs like this! It gives a sight into the daily highlights or lives of bands and artists.
Sounds really good, I think you did great.
YOU GUYS ALWAYS COME UP WITH SUCH GREAT SONGS!!❤️‍🩹
This is such a great song. You're one of the rare bands I love almost every song of. Every time it's fun, it's uplifting, it's great and passionate, whether the lyrics are joyful, sad, rebellious or nostalgic  Keep making us dance, keep making us dreams. And above all, keep having fun doing just that. Love from France guys!
THIS SONG GIVES ME A FEELING OF FREEDOM!! LIKE I CAN JUST BE DUMB AND FREE!! JUST LET LOOSE❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹
Bro I can’t wait for the next uk tour I went to the ok orchestra tour in Birmingham last year can’t wait for the next one and can’t wait to hear this live it’s going to be so lit 🔥🔥
i love how this makes me feel like i’m part of that, it’s really sad that I couldn't see you guys here in brazil because of covid-19 😭 hope i can one day
Again you might be dumb but your musical genius
Está hermosa la canción, es sorprendente toda la creativa que tienen AJR nunca dejen de hacer música, son fantásticos!!!❤
Glad I got here early for this masterpiece
Day 17:AJR can you please comment on this I am trying to get my favorite musicians to comment on my comments 🎵 ❤️ 🙏
The commitment is amazing. Guys really put effort in every word and note I love you

Tbh I’m not a AJR fan but this song is good and it’s there best too date, props to ajr!
This is an incredible song and video
10/10

yo
Love to see your still playing Wii sports!!!!’
DAAAMN I LOVE THIS! Im so proud of y'all. i didnt know the amount of time and effort to takes to make one song, i really love this one btw, good life guys :D
Very good!
I love how we can see the progress of making this! This is such an amazing song, and the 1.5 was worth it. It is amazing how much effort goes into a 3-4 minute song. Thank you so much for all of the amazing songs and videos!!!!❤❤❤
qué hermoso proceso hicieron
Best band! Like seriously no one produces such consistently quality music!
such a great mv idea please do all of them like this hahahah
This is too damn beautiful for a music video
Wow
the little girl❤❤
What a banger
amazing. just amazing. they know amazing people. they are amazing people.
I had no idea they made a song about me!
That makes me like the song 100x more
Los conocí en 2019 y jamás los voy a soltar ahora. Los quiero mucho 💜🫶
YOU GUYS WENT SKIING IN MY HOMETOWN HOLY SHIT
That was worth the year and  a half. Love the Chloe’s part so cute
This is amazing love this band
Can't wait to see you guys at Weidner Field in June
Bang! Er
I LOVE IT
thank you all for always putting so much effort to bring us joy and entertainment 🎉❤️ cheers to the dumb song!! 🌟
This video put a huge smile on my face. Thanks guys!
Favorite music video, explaining the history of the song and how far it has come is so engaging and  learning these small little details adds so much more to the song! Keep up the phenomenal work
love it! it’s such a vibe
oh Martin..
The happiest song I have ever heard, cant get enough of it
this was raw, i love it
YOU ARE AWESOME, I'M PROUD OF YOU AJR BROTHERS, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!💓
This music video never could be better. Beautiful
I've been waiting so long for this song and its amazing
Just got rejected. Oh well, at least there's a new AJR song
I love you ajr there's not a single song i don't like that guys have made❤❤❤
Ooooof
Love seeing the process. You guys are always showing us little bits and this is a nice big compilation.
This was very amazing to watch. Glad I got to see you guys live in minnesota 2022. I was just almost in the front to see you guys too!!!
Mis respetos :')
Epic
this makes me cry. ajr has been with me through hard times as I moved from high school to adulthood. it's hard to wrap my head around how much time has passed, in a lot of ways I grew up with their music, but I also coped with growing up *through* their music
📉😎👍⬇️
Loved this video and it’s so nice to continue to see the stuff that goes on behind the scene on their songs. Just another reason why they are my favorite band ❤
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da
This is crazy. When it goes viral, I CALLED IT
Love the song!
another banger (my question now is) when the new album (: ?
Congrats men
:)
AJR songs and music videos are amazing, now it feels like a cinematic song and I love that
Claim ur commenting on a new song that got released today and is gonna blow up in the future ticket
I love this style of a music video never seen it done before definitely a banger song congratulations
I love seeing Adam apart of the process, but OMG THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE YOU GUYS INVOLVED!!🫶🫶
Almost died on Sunday     Very glad I was around for this
leaving my comment here to remind myself I'm part of history :)
This video makes me so happy, to see how it’s made, the behind the scenes, and some fun videos of your own lives besides the music. Well done! ✨
I love this song already! You guys are so amazing!
Me too, Martin, me too.
To my kids watching this I miss you I love you have a great day
Bro the time has arrived AJR is back
Ajr gets too overhated, they are definitely one of the best modern artists
This song feels so undeniably human, and I love it for that. Thank you AJR
you guys are oh so amazine, "when we go down, when kingdom come "
I'm a big fan, but I feel like I left them abandoned and with this song they made me fall in love again ❤
this was so fun to watch! have a huge smile on my face, that made me so happy to see :D
Muito legal❤😂 So cool❤😂
I love the “you should not have done that” my favourite part
Nice job!
It was all well worth the effort and time, thank you so much AJR for being the best! ❤
Muy hermoso amo cada canción nueva que hacen son increíbles sigan así ❤❤😊  También me gustó que mostrarán el proceso para crear una canción❤
Excited for the upcoming album 🎉
ABSOLUTE FIRE 🔥🔥
What a godsend it would be to be able to do things like this..
It somehow has the feel of several previous albums and songs all in one song
:)
i missed u guys, thank you for another masterpiece! ❤
LOVE IT HUGE FAN CANT WAIT TO SEE U IN JULY!!!!!!!!
nice video style, also they can do lots of tax write-offs lol
Man, AJR has been making such good songs and videos to tie in with them, the last few they've released has made me genuinely cry
unique ass video! its dope tho
Love the new song dudes keep it up for you fans
This is so cool!! Love the song 🔥 🔥
Yeassssss
absolutely LOVED the video for this i love hearing behind the scenes/how it was written for songs. love the song the year and a half was worth it haha
Another banger 🎉I got to show this to my gf
I love seeing the whole writing process. As someone who studied music in college, their talent is incomparable, and I love it so much! Thanks for another amazing song!!!
W bro
It's amazing, You guys are incredibles
Each single keeps getting even better! I'm so hyped for TMM and I love this song :D
And when Chloe is old enough to understand ajr's music, she'll understand how much of a legend she is
this is beautiful probably the best ajr song it made me tear up absolute masterpiece
I love this band so much ❤😂
THERE'S ALSO A VIDEO OF THIS MASTERPIECE? DAMN THIS DAY IS GETTING BETTER AND BETTER
CONTEXTO. La canción comienza diciendo que "tu piensas que me lastimas diciendo que soy la persona más tonta que haz visto" pero no me creerías si te dijese que me haz liberado. Dumb song es una canción acerca de lo positivo que se esconde en ser infravalorado, sobre como a veces eso te libera de responsabilidad o de las expectativas inllenables de ciertas personas. PD: Me dedico a analizar canciones, ojalá pueda hacer contenido de AJR pronto.
Me encanta T^T
Its good that they didnt give up.
I saw the notification.  I clicked.  I listened.  I loved it.  I saved it to my playlist.   A real good history.
So good!!!!! Like omg
It's morning, just got 4 bad news one after another, and they posted this....  Watching these guys, living their life and doing dumb things... Just made my day.
Honestly I was sort of disappointed with the last 2 songs, but this is incredible! It's not too overcomplicated, or too simple, and perfectly blends the weird sounds and instruments that I love about AJR with a more (what feels like) conventional drum beat and sound. Keep doing stuff like this! Also, the MV being structured as a story was also very cool!
seems like a great opener for an ajr sitcom (or pilot)
Fkn love it 😂❤
The Wii is back
It’s just amazing, incredible and just waw i am so glad i can listen to this on repeat now
cool
I like how they used different people than themselves
Yeaaa
Truly one of the songs of our time
I'm in tears 😢 they put so much work in this video and song
Really good shit, this album is gonna kill
I freakin' love this band so much! As someone who produces too, it's so encouraging to see their process in their craft and that YOU CAN record your own music!  I love that they have a video diary too.  It's so cool and personal to see a tiny peek into their world!  Not to mention every song they release is a banger!
I'm much too dumb to understand song writing or how long it takes but both the song and the video sound amazing
Good job
QUE PERFEIÇÃO, ESPEREI TANTO E VALEU A PENA , MUITO OBRIGADO AJR , FICOU INCRÍVEL 😭💛🇧🇷
amazing.
Love it ❤
love you ajr
I always have say this, the music is the kind of music that i admire the most, because it's just so complicated to do, you have to think about a lot of things while making it to get the final results, it's amazing and I love this group and this song so much
It’s really amazing how much you can change in just a year and a half
YESSS
O orgulho que eu senti quando vocês mostraram o primeiro estúdio de gravação de vocês que não fosse vosso quarto🥺🤍🤍 Quanto amor<3
A trajetória pra chegar até uma concordância de mix🥺 Sempre se preocupando com os melhores resultados 🤍🤍
Greatest boy band of our age. 👌
Meus meninos❤️‍🩹 vocês arrasaram, de novo!!<33
🎉 what a song!
I think I just made more serotonin watching this video than I have so far this year
Did you guys really work that long on this song? Because it doesn't feel like it
favorite ajr music video tbh, so cool to see the song come together
Wow!!💯💐❤️
Obviously the best part of including your college buddies in a new song is slamming on them for being tone-deaf
I love this song
This is EPIC, like all of their songs
and thats why i love AJR
okok
Here before some of the song gets overused in a trend like last time
It would be cool to hang out with them, idk they seem great and through their songs it feels like they get what it is like to be an introvert.
It’s dope how you put the homies in on the backing vocals
Do this for more songs in the future! It gives the song depth, personality and meaning. It shows the people behind the track and it really is genuine. Love what you guys do keep it up!
Why this song make me so happy lol. I love it so much! My day was horrible but now it’s much better ❤
It is perfect 🎉
This is incredible. What a video🙌
See all the work being put into this song is quite interesting! The end result is also REALLY nice!
3:34 they really just played Wii Sports Resort
This is a cool ass video guys, love ya AJR, keep rocking and stay goofy, my friends!! 🤪😆
What a masterpiece!
YEAHHHHH
The perfect music video does not exi-
Honestly this is one of my favorite music videos from them. Instead of recording a music video like they usually did, they showed the process and all the countless time they spent making sure this song was perfect, and indeed it is. AJR makes such amazing music and it’s things like this that make me aspire to be like them. Thank you AJR for giving me the inspiration to start creating myself, maybe I’ll become great one day too.
Trumpet girl! 🎺❤
Contest Concept Idea: Give your fans the chorus and the chorus/preferred melody, and let them write the verses. Winner(s) get backstage passes (for them +1/2, for the next AJR concert they attend as long as they buy tickets), are involved in the recording process, and recieve royalties proportionate with their participation (but only on the song they worked on). I thought of this while watching the video since they tend to get stuck on the verses (they take forever to write). Amazing song, amazing video that shows the creative struggle. Amazing.
This song was full worth the wait, it sounds amazing, and the lyrics are fun, clever and relatable at the same time. This is going straight onto my summer playlist!
Amazing music video...
I love this concept for the music video 🔥🔥🔥 its so different but you want to listen more to see the journey on how the song was made
This song is such a vibe, and the video is so genuine showing the journey of the song. Thanks AJR for another great song to listen to on repeat!
Good soup!
Amazing song 🔥
YESSS GO CHLOE
I've never seen a music video with an authentic timeline on how the progress flows of the making and seeing the time passes by, the months came on and the people that helps, it made the song much more memorable and the lyrics also have the relatable quotations that always calls me out 😂 which is what I love from you guys, it's nice to see and hear another masterpiece from you all 🫶✨
This song is incredible and watching you guys grow and your journey is amazing! Keep up the great work i cant wait to see what you do next
Ahora que sé cuanto tardaron, se siente mucho más todo el esfuerzo y empeño que pusieron en este tema. Quedó increíble!!!
“Sounds really good” “I think it’s ready to go, you think it’ll go viral?” “No.”
This is better than world's smallest violin, hands down. I cannot stop listening. Great job guys, keep up the good work!
I have a feeling it’s called the dumb song because it was hard to put it together through that year and half and they still didn’t have a name, so it was out of spite
This is the definition of “the journey to the end is just as important as the end” and I’m all for it🥺❤️
Why is this lowky inspiring me to make music again lmaooo
Amazing I love every song they make
I’m also very dumb!
WE APROOVE TOOO!!
😊😊
Love deez guys!!!!
Chloe was so cute!  Way to go kid!!!
AJR was the first band I ever truly obsessed over, loved their music for years. Although now I’ve moved on to other genres and other artists, AJR and their music will always hold a special place in my heart :]
I love your music and I can tell with certainty that this is the right way! You all are amazing.
I feel for Martin. I'm the same way
The song and music video are both soooooo goooooood.
Como siempre nos han entregado arte y esta no es la excepción, ❤
Such a creative music video! I love to think of them coming back to this video in like 40 years and getting all nostalgic.
AJR restores my faith in moving on
DONT LOOK AT ME CAUSE I GOT NOTHING IN MY HEADDDDDD  OHHHHH IN MYYYY HEAAAAAAAADDDDD
I would really like to thank you for not only your authenticity and talent but your work ethic and strive to make something great because this song was worth everything that y’all went through. This song will be on in my car so much this summer.
I wanted a show of you guys in Brazil 😔, I'm such a fan, and as much as I don't like shows, I'd make a point of going on a show of yours. (I used a translator to make this comment, sorry for any typos or continuity)
AJR, thank you honestly, I start a new school next week and I’m always gonna be listening to this. This is the first song you guys released since I moved the beginning this month. Thank you for being there when I needed it most. I love you AJR so much and I can’t wait to see what you have for years to come. I’ve been listening for 2 and a half years and loved ever second. To sum it all up I love you guys so much and thank you. ❤
I love this! Love the documentary style cause we see all the effort love & hard work put into this. Keep doing what you guys do we love you!!
"Ensuring the presence of a Brazilian comment 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷"
ive been a fan of you guys since sixth grade, and its been five years since then. still love yall!! keep up the good work :)
What an amazing song
This song actually gave me goosebumps, Well worth a wait for a song nobody really knew about. 10/10 Definitely.
Não me canso de achar incrível o jeito que esses caras fazem música. E transmitem isso. Obrigado, do Brasil. 🥰
Guys, I don’t know if you’ll read this but if you ever doubt yourselves or wonder if you made a difference. I am so unbelievably happy to have you as a moment in my life. Your music, your friendships with each other, and your struggles have pulled me through to continue life more than once. I may be screaming inside like humpdy dumpdy but you bring me joy like sunshine through a thunderstorm. Thank you for living on this earth while I’m around. I’m not alone because of you.
You know what? This is a bit of a vibe. I like this. It’s fun. I wasn’t a fan before but love this, this is fun.
i loved that so much! also what an amazing song. Thanks for showing us the behind the scenes of it all but also letting us enjoy the music as well 💜
What a beautiful song and music video, so different
Every song and video, I love you guys even more! ❤
Worth the wait
just as good as The Dj is Crying For Help,and I Wont
I absolutely love this! The song is great, the video is fantastic. One thing I love about AJR is their explaining how they wrote it, when they do it live too.
🥺🥺🥺
That is awesome
WE MAKIN IT OUT THE BRAIN WITH THIS 🗣️💯💯🗣️💯🗣️💯💯💯🔥💯🔥🗣️🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶🗣️🗣️
I LOVE THIS SONG. You guys always are so relatable and make the best music. I've seen you three times in concert! And I hope a fourth and fifth time come here pretty soon.
I love how open and accessible AJR seem to be. Very relatable AND extremely talented!
I love how they included friends and chloe is absolutely adorable
Love this song already and this video is pure genius <3
OOOOW I REALLY LOVE THIS  YOU MADE AN AMAZING JOB MY GOSH I LOVE YOU GUYS!!
The hard work is worth it  This song makes a place in my favourite playlist ❤❤
This song is so good it is worth the time it took to make
Love seeing this, and knowing how hard you all work to bring us your amazing work. It literally means the world to us🥲
Will this be performed after the Phillies game on June 10th???
spoiler alert: it was good to go!
This makes me want to dance  and don’t care about the rest
Man AJR, you guys hit another Home Run. Thank you for creating & writing great songs & putting in the effort required to do so, wow!
Niceeeeee!!!!!
Sí.
Why am I crying watching this video
You have a tone deaf person on your team lol wow that is so cool. Why you do idk but i guess it is a fresh person who probably doesn’t think much music is good but if it is good enough for him it is good enough for anyone
Why I feel emotional watching this?? 😭😭😭😭 It is amazing the amount of passion you put in your work. Thank you for giving us always the finest.
Nice❤
Listened to this last night at 1:00am had me wanting to get up and dance lol
Awesome!!!
This song came out 2 hours ago and I know all the lyrics. Respect 🔥🔥🔥
Next Up Forever, while I’m still Turning Out
I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE STILL PLAYING WII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
this is just so pure. i love how this video showed us the making of this masterpiece. i love you guys so much! 💜
어떻게 노래가 다좋나요
Great stuff!
Soo cool
めっちゃええな
The song is cool and everything, but I really would like to see full gameplay of Jack and Ryan playing Wii Sports Resort
Brilliant. Videography and editing as well. Such a elegantly homemade/professional blend. Well done.
I love this song
A year and a half and it’s the perfect song and it’s just a sneak peek of what other amazing things are to come
What a fun edit!
It's always fascinating to see the process. It makes me appreciate the song more
Well this was unexpected for me, awesome song tho!
I think that was a perfect official video for that song. Showcasing how it was made and how much work went into it. Thank you AJR for doing all of it, worth it.
The more time you put into something, the better it becomes, they say.
You guys are amazing the first song I played  in the trumpet was let the games begin and it was my favorite song  for 2 years 😍
Amazing song. Amazing journey show in the video absolutely immaculate.
kinda mid
Very cool
taking the creative process unto itself
I love the new song guys! As a 15 year old learning ableton and recording simple things Is awesome. You guys are a huge inspiration and your concert was the best I’ve ever been to (the Kansas City starlight theater was an amazing choice btw)
This.... IS... *AMAZING* !!!!!!
Love it!! They're amazing.
I like it a lot, thank you
Oh Martin lol
Come to Michigan!!!!!!
Idc if I gonna use all my mobile data up Im watching this on the bus I AM TOO HYPED TO WAIT

Very dumb :D
CARA EU AMO ESSES DUDES
I'M BECOMING A FAN OF THIS BAND💜I LOVE THIS SONG🎶
💗💗
worth the wait love these guys!!!
This sounds so great, been looking forward for ages!
My birthday is in 3 days. I'll consider this song an early present
The microwave lyric speaks to me bc my gf can cook & I can’t
love ya
Too good, as usual, AJR never disappoints.
love it!
Definitely worth the wait
My ten year old introduced us to you. AJR is now played daily in our house by your biggest fan, our 4 year old. He has watched your concerts on YouTube countless times and knows all your songs and dance moves. Cannot wait for you guys to go on tour again so we can bring the whole fam to a show!
Song grows on you
Where is the trumpet melody from?
When we go down...
It’s actually crazy to see how long this took and the amount of work you put into it, congrats ajr!
A beautiful song with an even more beautiful story behind it. I hope you all continue to have success, you definitely deserve it.
I absolutely love you guys. Thank you for showing us a look into your lives. It's so amazing to see how much you guys love the music you're producing. ❤️
Love this behind the scene clip!
They never disappoint us! Thank you!
Absolutely awesome, really grateful for some new music. Hope I can catch you guys live one day!
i cannot express how much AJR has helped me get through really difficult times- i can’t help but tear up watching this. somehow the lyrics of all of their songs hit too close to home. i am so proud and cant express enough how honored i feel to watch this happen live.
This is so dumb 😂
This one's a hood classic for sure
YES
When they zoom in on Martin bc he’s tone deaf
sick!
You guys are geniuses ❤
Absolutely loved seeing you guys at The Verizon Amphitheater in St Louis ❤ I've been waiting for so long for your new music and it was well worth the wait 💙 keep being great guys!
We've been waiting for this for so long and it does not disappoint. Will be on repeat until further notice!!!! We love you guys!!!! Thank you for making the music that you do. It really helps keep people like me a little more sane.
Love that you can always hear how much fun they’re having when recording a song. Greatest band of all time
AMAZING-  honestly i had doubts but once again they have absolutely smashed it from 1-110%
Yet another BOP from AJR!
I wonder if this song took the longest to make out of all their other ones
wow
Omg I love the some even more after watching this 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
That drum recording to song intro transition is so smooooth 👌👌👌
I love this so much.
We won't ever forget you. It wasn't your final album. You said you wanted to make us smile.   Mission accomplished.  Congratulations on your bit of success! We can't wait to see what you do next.
Is a 1,5 years worth the wait
10/10 love the Christmas in June type beat and the lyrics
This isn't a music video... it's so much better than that!
Me gustó el proseso
Based as usual
It's been on repeat every possible moment since it came out this morning and now to see this brilliant video is just 🥺🥺 *chefs kiss* YOU GUYS ARE INCREDIBLE. It's my dream to see you live in South Africa 😭
Ajr is in a class all their own
Congrats on new song! This song tools up my years of memories and I am really glad that you guys release this fantasy song! I been thinking about past years what I had do, I had done, sounds really good!
Ameiiii
Love this song :D
I love this video! Congrats you guys. Very fun.
The music video tells the story of making the song It's sooo cool
im serious, these guys make the best band and im not gonna lie, they are people who saved me when they released burn the whole house down❤
a music video documenting the development of a song? i don't think anyone's done that before, but it's an INCREDIBLE idea! ajr continues to push boundaries with both their music AND their videos, absolutely insane.
시험기간에 노래를 발표하면 어떻게 하란거야! 노래가 너무 좋아서 공부해 집중할 수 없잖아! ㅋㅋㅋ What if I release a song during the exam period! The song is so good that I can't concentrate on studying! LOL
Omg so cool
When i first heard the drop at 3:00 i wonder who's behind itt😭. I APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK AND PASSION THAT GOES IN THIS SONG! 🙌🏽😍
Amazing!!! Come to Israel 🇮🇱  for a full concert ❤🎉
The amount of work that goes into a single Song is insane, and it's a whole banger when it's finished.
Amazing job guys. It’s so cool to see a music video telling the story of the song
I had goosebumps listening to this song for the first time. It's just amazing!
so cool
I love it can't wait for more ❤❤
It's not an hymn but it is a good and honest song. <3 More about the ride than the destination.
It's so fun seeing the process and all the ins and outs of making this amazing song! It was super cool watching it come to life and sound amazing!
Why was I surprised, it's ajr we already know when they release a new song it's gonna be a banger
I was surprised with the time this to be made and to think an Official Video Appeared for its origins I'm blessed, thanks for the tunes AJR Brothers and Team
Es una canción tontamente  buena 👍
Beautiful just beautiful
So far, rewatched this 17 times 😂😂 I'm such an ajr nerd 😂😂😂 Pls laugh
A Masterpiece ❤
I love how they're able to build suspense with their fanbase waiting for an awesome song. Also congrats on the new studio!
AJR is officially never dying
I love this music video omg 🥲
It was worth it
This is really cool to see how it was made
노래 너무 좋아요 AJR의 노래들이 저를 행복하게 해주네요 🥹❤️❤️
Real e Oficial, essa é minga nova banda favorita ksks MDS COMO AMO AS MÚSICAS DELES E ESSA NÃO FOI EXCEÇÃO ❤❤ e pensar que conheci a banda por causa de uma música que vi num vídeo de gacha life/club story ksks
I've already watched this 12 times😂
They had too much fun on this song. I love it!
es hermoso, de los mejores videos musicales que veré en mi vida
#justiceforMartin
It's nice to see artists make documentary types of videos like this for their creation. The song itself is meaningful, with the clip, its cherry on top. Go AJR love you always 💙💜❤️
I always thought the "you should not have done that" was just some random sound effect I didn't know they made it
Спасибо за то что могу слушать и смотреть это видео с ВПНом
Every time AJR releases new music, I cry because I just love them so much and am so inspired by their talent. This song is no different. They continue to be tremendous and genuinely in love with their craft and it shows. I love you AJR! I can't wait to see this song live on the next tour!
Meh
You guys never miss, it’s deep and sounds fucking amazing, keep it up guys we all love you
"Martin is tone deaf" same Martin, same 😭
21-04-2023     bheemaram
I've been subbed for 4 years now and still haven't been to a concert yet what am I doing with my life (I'm 9 btw)
This is so frickin adorable 😭😭😭😭
AJR’s song concepts are mind blowing. Clever, fun, beautiful, and unique. Thank you guys for raising my spirits with your talent and music.
this song is so amazing!!!!  I really love it❤❤
I disagree. Dumb people couldn't make something this cool
That was so wholesome
This is like the ode to sleep music video and I love that. This is for sure my favorite music video of all time. What a way to tell a story and use the song as a backdrop!
Love the song and the story, congrats on the drop!
LETS GOOO
Martin is the goat
It's gorgeous, one of my favourites already, and this video just adds to the love. Great work guys, It's been fantastic watching you grow and each new banger makes me proud to be a fan of yours. Hope I can catch one of your shows in person one day!
FINALLY A NEW SONG
I love how they make you feel like you were apart of making it. It really  makesthesong more perspnal and heart touching
Nice
i guess there not going to be a how we made dumb song video then?
This is absolutely amazing, you took so long to make it, but, the final product is worth the wait.

This is amazing, the video is so heartfelt I love it
this is so fun to listen. Our boys did it again<3
I hope I am not going crazy but the sound of the trumpets to me syncs up with the beat in "Christmas in June" except with a faster tempo and I find this unique style, incredibly well done as always.
This is so precious, I swear you guys are the absolute best. Big hug from Brazil you bunch of dummies! Keep up the good songs
When are you guys coming to Brazil? 😂🇧🇷
como siempre traen arte, los amamos mucho 💖💖
Wow. Just wow. What an absolute banger of a song. I love how it's just a sarcastic, snarky way of the way that people think people are dumb so they play dumb. I do that too when people think I'm stupid because of my Autism and ADHD so this is just incredible! Love you AJR!💙💙💙
Idk why something about AJR just gives me very comfy vibes and I love it
La canción es increíble, muchísimas gracias. Y gracias al video pude ver el proceso, cosa que me encanto, GRACIAS😭😭💖💖💖💖💖
Los conozco apenas hace un año, y la neta es lo mejor que me pudo haber pasado en la vida
Really worth the wait! I keep listens to the song on repeat!! So proud of you guys☺️
SHAY AND OLLY GOT TO BE IN IT YAY
I am so excited!! This looks amazing!
i grew out of AJR a while ago but this is great
You guys are my favourite content creators and singers i love you guys
Hey I know those guys
I absolutely love this song, this video, and this band❤️
I like that they're showing where some of the ideas are coming from, like the drumming pattern. This song is actually really good too, compared to the alternative feel of their other songs.
Absolutely love it!!! Love to see the progress of songs. And this is probably one of my new favorite music videos to watch. ❤🎶
Fantastic behind the scenes look at everything :) Well done as always, gentleman!

가슴이 다 벅차오른다.. 숨이 막히네
Congratulations AJR! We are all proud of you for doing this! Very different from your normal work but I LOVE IT! It’s happy and I’m already dancing to it!
This band is so underrated their music is really amazing
How does nobody notice how bad the cut from verse to chorus is. I keep seeing ppl say it's the best song.
You guys missed my standing ovation and clapping at my computer.  Also was that a Wheaton Terrier?  GREAT SONG
Omg so much effort on this, you guys are incredible! Hope u come to Brazil some day because I really want to watch you show ❤❤
Only one word *Amazing*♥️
Thank you I love you guys ❤
This video has my heart oh my god Saw you guys in May, unforgettable <3
As a person that's working with a low budget to try and be a voice actor, I really am inspired by the journey you guys have taken to get this far. Keep being an inspiration to millions and keep up the good work.
Absolutely beautiful!!!!
I love how you guys have been experimenting with your music, I can’t wait for this new album and so can’t my 7 year old self!!!
Amo la nueva canción ❤🦔✨😼
I can even find the right words for this comment. You keep my jaw open every time you guys drop something new!!! And Austin? king what? Are you ok?? Beautiful editing sir!
I love how you show the story behind the song, also love the scooters 😂 This is now my favourite song too, cheers!
I love watching them work on things that take this long and are a great song
🔥🔥🔥🔥
Im early
I freaking loveeeeeeeeeeee thisssssszzzz
awesome
Ajr is not an emotion, it's a youtube channel
ESTOYYYY TAN ENAMORADA DE ESTO DIOSMIOOOOOOooooOoo
God this song already means the word to me, thank you, AJR 🤍
What a cool concept for a music video! It was really cool to see the whole process of making a song like this! Love the new song, keep up the great work!! ❤❤
It is truly incredible how far they have come. Keep the great work up!
Aguante AJR CARAJOO!!!!!!!! 🎉🎉🎉
I like how in each album there is the "banger", like for Neotheater there is Karma and Oko there is bummerlund
Estos muchachos si que se esfuerzan por convertir sus canciones en arte

Another year and a half Another 4 Months Another Day Another Dumb Hit from AJR😄
Beautiful work❤❤❤
this is freaking awesome. I LOVE seeing the creative process.this is very inspiring. thank you
hi
i have a feeling that next release will be the album, considering to my knowledge all the albums (except living room) have released after 3 songs from the album. and so far, we have i won’t, the dj is crying for help, and now, the dumb song. so now, we just wait. on another note, this is a fucking banger  edit: this aged well i mean god is really real shouldn't have needed to exist (rest in peace) and i don't think yes im a mess was supposed to be a single but ehe
JASDJASJDAJD SOY MUY FELIZ CON USTEDES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Martin is tone-deaf
Another certified BANGER from the guys. Never stop never missing
perfect
Omg I’m so early this song is amazing!
Eu quero morar nesse vídeo ❤
This song is gonna go epic this 2023
This actually still fits as a music video than their traditional ones, just a bunch of dumb people grooving to the song over the course of a year
I think it's the best music video whatsoever.....  You guys nailed it🔥
Yay!
Hahaha I wish more people showed the whole process of making a song. This is awesome!!
Nice
O esforço e a dedicação, todo sucesso ao AJR 🥺
This is the ultimate music video clip. No fake things but the story, im inlove with it ❤❤❤❤❤
Chloe's part is just different  <3
Literally me tho, I’m just too dumb
I love how they used the story instead of just the full song, they put so mich work into this its so amazing
I love how this song has a story to how it was made
Thank you for sharing your intimacy and another banger of a song! Looking forward to see you live someday ❤️
omg oMG OMG
最高か 私に英語はわかんないけど、AJRの音楽はめっちゃ好き メイキングも嬉しい！ 楽しいよね
Awesome 🎉
The most impressive part of this video is their ability to play Wii table tennis sitting down 😂/hj Another amazing song from AJR! I love seeing the timeline of how it came together.
Great video! I wish I had friends.
Imagine the fact that my friend sent this to me...
Acabé 🥵 kajskajska me re encanta la canción y el vídeo y Adam también 🛐🛐🛐
Something about this song reminds me of old flash games I would play, of old music I used to hear, and of events in my life I thought I'd forgotten.  This is amazing.
Wow
Los amo tanto❤❤
Opening is funny 10/10
最高
Here to claim my within 1 hour ticket
The reason they’re breaking out of the house in the cover art is because they finally moved out of their bedrooms and into an actual recording space!!!!!!
AJR is a huge inspiration to me and I WILL produce a song for them one day.
Before the song gets big, I was here. And its awesome AJR as per usual
Loving the song, it sounds amazing! And I loved seeing the process of creating it as well ♥
Definitely worth the wait 🙏🏻
This is so great, I’m glad you guys happy with the end product.
The trumpets after the verses remind me so much of Christmas in June ngl Oh hey it's that pool from "I won't"
Definitely worth the time and effort to make
Here before this song gets used for TikTok
한국인분들 손!!
Amazing song, especially since it came out within a week of my birthday.
彼の曲はとてもおもしろい曲！
WOW! ANOTHER BANGER IN THE BOOKS
I WON’T hate this song.
Beautiful boys amazing ❤
Hey AJR! I’ve been a fan since you guys only had one album! I’m so happy that you guys put so much time and thought into your songs and this one exceeded my expectations! I went to one of your concerts in 2022, it was amazing! Keep up the amazing work!
La letra está brutal y el video está muy hermoso, que genialidad, chicos <3
This is fucking awesome.
Truly a dumb and catchy song 💛😊💛 I love all of this behind the scenes footage!
I am going to make this  a metal song
This is so wonderful, this brings me joy and I'm finally confident that you can still enjoy life despite being a music producer... 😅
i like it !
Ok now we need a full length documentary! Really good song and unique video to suit! The motivation AJR give me is here once again :D
NOT EVEN A HOUR AND I AM HERE  once again AJRs made another great song to listen to on repeat Edit: I also love the story of the music video as well shows the effort the boys put in to make music
At first, I thought this was just another ajr song until I saw this, and it's amazing
I just wanted to say thanks for showing us the process, this seemed like so much fun guys.  Love yall!!!!
I have been waiting so long!!!! YAY
❤❤🤩
Glad to be here early :)  I love your guys' music AND music video, you guys are awesome.
I really love this song and the video is really nice    I love you guys from Nigeria 🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬
I love AJR from Japan!!!
I just wanted to say thanks for showing us the process, this seemed like so much fun guys.  Love yall!!!!
I'm starting to wonder if THIS is the original "Christmas in June" having the same beat but faster  While the Christmas in June we have is just a second version in the brother's verse list dump Knowing that The Dumb Song was made during OKO era of 2021
Commenting for the algorithm. This song deserves to reach all the top charts
we want more adam content!!
Me emocioné 😢❤
Just when I thought that OKO was the brothers highest point, they pull this shit out. I have not stopped listening since 6 am and no I don't have a problem, this is AJR.
I love it
This song is very good!😊
FINALLY!! AJR REALEASED ANOTHER BANGER!!
What an amazing music video idea, to show the behind the scenes for the journey this song has taken in order to get to us! Absolutely love y'all!
MV!
My daughter is 8 and has autism. She loves AJR and the music speaks to her unlike any other artist. It's truly fascinating and beautiful. She dances and sings along!
You guys can do nothing wrong!! Lovit
Maaaaaan, I love this. I don't know what I liked better, either seeing the creative process and the little comments, or simple looking are their cute, fluffy dog
Oh in my head I said with certainty "The track's real catchy, i wonder how the video's gonna be?" Then Youtube notifications showed this to me And best you believe it it kinda set me free
Can we get a song "I'm famous"😂😂❤❤
Aye Martin did his best though 🙌🏻
FICOU INCRIVEL!!!!!!!
Phenomenal song, maybe my favourite. You guys just keep getting better and better keep it up
love it!!
Easily my favorite AJR Music Video. There's so much raw passion and fun the way you guys showcase working on your art. Keep it up!
Love it all guys!!!
I love this video
I am so unbelievably grateful for all of you lovely humans!!! much love
Que Musica maravilhosa, tá louco. Fique até sem palavras :D
Gonna be honest, this is really inspiring, I’ve wanted to make a song for so long because of listening to their music and seeing this process and seeing how long it took them is encouraging to see and it shows that even amazing artists like them take time to write something amazing.  Amazing song AJR, you are not like any other band out there and you never disappoint
Happy to see this video go AJR
I just really appreciate how much work goes into each song, this made me tear up. You guys are the best!!! Love the new song
Unmatched! The energy and heart the boys put into their music is unlike anything I've seen before. Truly inspiring ❤
Love this song to much that I listen to it in a loop on Spotify
What a journey. Congratulations ajr
Perfect, down every little last detail. This may not be what a normal music video for ajr is but it’s amazing showing the true experience of making a song. Even one so dumb
Estaba super emocionado por esta canción y me encantó!, sin duda otra música más para mi playlist, Viva AJR
This is beautiful representation of friendship
I forever in love with this song!! You guys are astronomical!! I love you!💕
You guys are amazing ❤  It's amazing how long and impressive your journey was
At this point it’s is 12:37 am I’m 37 mins late but it’s worth it
lalalala〜lala...♪
They literally made a song about the Behind the Scenes.
Wow!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Whys jack so narcissistic
This song insane!Keep going AJR
This guys are amazing 🥹🥹🥹 Every song is a work of art!!!
Anyone noticed that this is Jack's coat from Bummerland's clip? 1:40
MASTERPEICE
La vecina es la MVP me encanto su cara cuando grabo el audio! Me encanta esta canción
What        (edit: why did I type this half a year ago XD)  (edit 2: why did I type this an over a year ago??? And edit it????)
I love you guys
damn i didnt expect that that it took a year and half for this new  masterpiece guess "im just too dumb"
One of my new favorite ajr songs             Amongst every other one of their songs
Being an AJR fan, they never fail to show their dedication, creativeness, and liveliness in the songs they produce. I wish them the bestt!
I love songs that holds meaning, especially ones that doesn't, it shows a person's growth and im all for it :)
Da dada dadada da dada dada
This is the best music video yet! I hope Andy and Martin appear in more songs too lol.
Let’s go
NONE OF THE COMMENTS ARE In ENGLISH
¡Maravilloso!. Nos dan más que una canción, es todo un proceso creativo, lleno de vivencias, retos, lugares, personas y momentos que nunca se olvidarán porque quedarán enmarcados en este mágico video. Muchas gracias AJR, muchas gracias chicos. #TheDumbSong 🥺💫
So proud of you guys! It’s such a good song!
Fire song. Fire Video. Great guys.
This song was amazing! I loved how they told the story on making it, and I love the beat and lyrics. It’s **perfect**
i love this son
Ohhhh, so that's why the videos you posted on your socials were so good quality, makes in hinsight now
My new favorite music video
When we go concert, when you come. Don't look at me. Don't look at me just too dumb.
you guys are brilliant! ryan especially just has the most beautiful mind
Solwndjxkdkd ❤❤❤❤❤❤
That is probably the most I've smiled listening to a new AJR song, fucking brilliant work everyone
The vibe is immaculate, keep up the good work guys!
Every song that you make feels like a completely different trip, and is so beautiful that you also show us the trip that you do during the creative and production process, and somehow project it on the song. You guys are completely amazing, I love your songs, they mean a lot to me ❤
I’m here first
I like this❤❤❤❤
Love the Rock/Indie feel of this ❤️
now we wait for the sequel, The Dumber Song
That christmas in June part 🔥
Wow, I love the new acoustic indie pop style in this song! This song will definitely stand compared to the other more electric songs on the album.
This is really really wholesome, especially the part where martin gets called out on being tone deaf bahahaha
Anybody know what concerts the clips are from? This is so awesome!!!!
I wonder what this song is actually about to them.
The love and passion you guys always put into everything is always so great to see. Keep up the great work guys ❤
That production making 👌👌👌
Finally a song for me 😂
Love it. Excellent Friday vibes :)
the editing, the content, the voiceacting - I can't help but feel this video was made for me
It took AJR exactly a month and a half to make me become an addicted fan of them, and I'm proud to be one.
Evolution the ajr bummerland,my play,way less sad, record player,i wont, the djthe sad
So good
Aah it's so cool seeing it come together!!!
I love this clip so much! Thank you for sharing this aspect of the creation of The Dumb Song :)
Absolutely loving this song! I was waiting so excitedly last night to listen and now I can't stop! ❤
To this day, AJR still plays wii sports table tennis.
dumb
Didnt think it could happen, but this just joined into my AJR Top 3. Thanks boys
THIS SONG IS AMAZING
You guys!!!! Am so proud of you guys! 😭😭😭😭🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Its so good! ❤
Another SURE FIRE HIT ❤ I'VE GOT THE DUMB SONG IS ON REPLAY!!! I'm almost crying at how sweet this video is. You all put so much effort into everything you do, and this song/video is proof of that. You can truly see how much you all care for not only the people in your life but also for your fans. AJR will always be my go to and favorite band around! Thank you for all you do Adam, Jack, and Ryan 🙌🏼 Cheers to your new drop 🎙🔥
The way they just incorporate their friends and neighbors is so awesome and funny. This song shouldn’t work but it just does.
This is really cute, love it
I love ajr the are the best
I'm surprised it only took a year and a half to make pure perfection
Already addicted to this song. And it's been that long since i started listening?
Me encanta que estos genios musicales se esfuercen tanto y tengan tanto amor para sacar una cancion, esa es la fórmula del éxito, seguid así!!!
Haven't listened to the song yet but I have a question, is Jack nonbinary? I noticed that in the text Jack was refered to as they, their, them, sorry if I'm wrong
This was sooo cool! Thank you for sharing and obvi the song is amazing!!!
Very nice
👍
You guys are incredible. Every second of the songs is so enjoyable, funny and also dumb. Thanks AJR for all of your music. We love you
The video for this song just seem so genuine.. it gave me chills:) I'm so happy AJR is always staying true to themselves through their music, keep doing it!🧡
I love this
Crazy how it took them 2 years to finish 1 song, but it was all worth it in the end!! Time to play it on repeat for the whole weekend 👍
Nice!
AJR has always liked to show us their songwriting process, and that makes each song feel even more special! I love that their friends were included in the song ❤ I will definitely be playing this song all summer!
The amount of times I replayed this song since it came out is crazy! I absolutely love it! I also really love the video. I like when you guys show behind the scenes, it really shows how much effort you put into your music.
I love those idea for a music video. No erotic dancing, no product placement, just three guys and their friends workshopping together to make something.
this is one of my new favorites
as a individual AJR always posts only Ws
Me genera una extraña sensación de nostalgia, es muy wow ver todo el proceso y la canción es simplemente genial, gracias por existir AJR
I always think, “ajr could not get any better, could they?” Then they keep dropping absolute bangers!! Congrats on the new song guys!!
They're back 🖤
Beat song ever
another great song by ajr that anthony fantano will blindly roast because he can't have an open mind
AAAAA COMO AMO SU MUSICA
Love how this is feeling like such a community to write songs and include people they know and care about
I have been totally addictod to the dj is crying for help and now i have my dosis for the summer.
it was worth the wait
U know they are good artist when they still play wii sports resort.
2:59 💜🤌
Super groovy!!  I'm sitting here at work, can't sit still!!  😊😊🎵👍💕💕
cute doggy
i love it when you get showed how the song was made while the song play's. great work
❤️❤️❤️
It was good to go
You wouldn’t know it by just hear the music without listening to the words but this is break up song. It took pain to make this masterpiece. And they make it such a happy-go-lucky song. Truly not enough people enjoy AJR the way they should with all their nuances and the stuff they don’t say that make their songs so much better. We love you AJR!
I love ajr so much, they put so much time and dedication into their music and care alot about their fans! That makes every second of waiting worth it for the amazing music they produce for us! ❤ Thank you so much ajr
I've been waiting so long for a new song you guys inspired me to go after my dreams onestly the only reason i listen to music is you guys your music makes me so incredibly happy all the time helped me trew some crazy stuff so thank you guys so much 😊
Martin's trying his best
i’m OBSESSED. y’all have hit it out of the park, AGAIN <3
Set my alarm for 10 to see this video  Great song! Can’t wait to see what you do next!
킹JR 폼 미쳤다ㅏㅏㅏ
Its crazy how every song they make is a masterpiece. Just heard this song once and its already stuck in my head. Absolutely love it.
Always bringing a smile to my face. Thank you, guys
This is by far my favorite AJR song so far. I love it!
noice
This really gives me inspiration for the song writing process of really how long it takes for creativity to take its hold. This is fantastic and thank you so much for showing this process. It gives me hope. ❤
It's a bit concerning how it took them over a year to get a song ready, just to name it "The Dumb Song"
Best vid they have ever made, will never top it
This is one of your best, and the music video just shows how much effort y’all put in to make such incredible music. Thanks for another banger
I love this so much!!
Listening to this in the early morning and I can’t express just how much joy this brought me, there’s no explanation it just made me so unbelievably happy!
Thanks for all the hard work
Definitely worth the wait and hard work   BEST SONG EVER
I was expecting a music video but got a full on documentary   Amazing work AJR!! The Dumb Song came out great!  👏
Was 100% sold on the song from the first teaser, felt a little let down at release, but this is probably the best music video you guys have done. Instead of showing epic visuals, you show us the Journey and storyline of the song which gives it so much more character. Love this
Glad to see the process and effort that went into this wonderful song! It truly shows how dedicated you guys are to your craft and how much you care for your music. This is a true piece of art.
Hay algo que estos chicos no puedan hacer
1 hour gang
This is crazy. I absolutely love it.
Love the dedication and effort put into this song!
It's really incredible, seeing everything that goes into making a song of this caliber!
Can someone make a beat saber song out of this
That was such a journey put into one song ❤
Amazing song
THIS IS SUCHHH A COOL VIDEO, funny how you mentioned all the different people and I bet y'all are so glad the song is done now!!
My new favorite song
This song brings so much happiness, you guys did amazing!
Let's Goo!
Part of me really wants to hear the Demo you guys made prior to the final version, would be awesome to see what changed!
This is fucking amazing
Already in love with this song!
Great song
This is amazing amazing and inspiring that you guys spent a year and a half on this!! It truly paid off it sounds incredible
It's crazy to think it took over a year to make the song. Thank you for putting in so much effort to make the song a reality!!
Just amazing.
I hope my tour crosses their path cuz I really want to go through another one of their concert. If someone turns on AJR while I'm working I'm taking a break and jamming out
🔥🔥🔥
Don’t think I’ve seen a music video based around making the actual song, this is so sick
Let's go awesome song awesome video and awesome people all around, wish nothing but the best for all of you ❤.
❤️❤️❤️
I just really love the vibe of AJR
Loving the ska influence
さいこう
AJR songs gives a sick vibes🔥
We love you sm AJR, you change my life and your songs makes me feel alive!  Hope you can come to Mexico, here's a lot of people and fans that wish to meet you all!  Thanks for save my life <3
so good!!
😢
Wow 👏
They aren’t dumb,  They are fucking geniuses!!!
What a long and magical process
Truly a new age.
You should do a collab with BoyWithUke
Yes
I haven't seen the artist who better than ajr. You guys are genius of music!
I'm here early!!
I absolutely love the creativity of this video where it shows all the behind the scenes and the build up of the song. ALSO ITS A BANGER
I love it!❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥
Hello!
my cheeks hurt from smiling so much... i love this
EARYLY!!!!
Yay its out
I only have one thing to say, it was worth the wait, what a work of art
Why does it take so long too make a song?
AJR I love yall's songs and I hope you guys are taking it easy!
This song has definitely grown on me
Another banger from AJR, I had high expectations ever since I heard the sample from Instagram, and it did not disappoint, I kind of wished the gang vocals were slightly more exaggerated, but that could just be me
YESS
Great song!! ❤❤
amazibf
This song feels so warm
Love this behind the scenes stuff, can’t wait for full documentary!
I am honored that AJR made a song about me!
Absolutely beautiful
Love this song !!!
LETS GOOO
How does AJR seem to always make a song that describes my exact situation/point of view in life at the exact moment they release it?
MAMITAA QUE BUENA, hora de escucharla
El esfuerzo se nota, les quedó demasiado buenaaaaa🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I look forward to looping this more tomorrow! Been a second since I listened to a bunch of AJR songs, burned myself out a few months ago but I think I'm ready to do it again now!!
Kenzie approves this song lol, honestly it’s amazing
Wanted to be the first comment ❤
My marching band did an entire show based on this band, right after their tour. It was amazing
Ajr always delivering the best
This is soooo good >.<
I love how ajr always makes songs that is heartwarming but still gives of positive vibes
10/10
Cómo los amo
You guys are AMAZING, I'm so happy for you
This song is great! One of my favorite parts is the instrumental at the verse “When we go down… When kingdom come”
Nossa eu estou simplesmente fascinado com o esforço e dedicação que tiveram até chegar nesse som + que perfeito 🎉❤
THERES A PUPPY NOW
It's amazing!❤ I'm so immersed in the documentary style video that i forgot this is a music video xD
poor Martin i hope they get well soon
Personally I connect with this song on a personal level, as I am dumb.
Yet another absolute banger. AJR just don’t miss!!!
The process and the whole journey to get to this final product has been incredible, Well done Boys!! Another Banger once again
This is sick
Just what I wanted
This fits the song so well🥲 this was so awesome to see
Absolutely love this song already
I'M SO PROUD OF THIS SONG SM
TMM TMM TMM

Que bonito que nos compartieran el proceso de la canción ❤❤, gracias AJR ☆ﾟ⁠.⁠*⁠･⁠｡♡
So great! You are true artists ⭐️
Thiw should be the song for 2022 rewind
YESSSSSSS❤❤❤❤❤
I like how this song is very fast pace because AJR does really make a lot of fast paced songs so something new
Nice AJR! I love it
Keep being awesome AJR also S tier song
I actually really like how they put the story of the song instead of a regular music video, it really gives the song more depth and shows just how much effort is put into the songs
Yay new song
MI FELICIDAD
한국인 모여라~🇰🇷🇰🇷🇰🇷
Wow! So much effort and time went into this song. It's perfect! You guys keep out doing yourselves with each song!
T amo ajr
Well, now we know that a tone-deaf singed in this music.
WHO HERE LOVED AJR FROM THE SONG "I'M READY"??????🎉
This is what is so different about AJR, they such genuine authenticity. I am in such admiration for their willingness to be open with their fan base and tell them exactly what goes into such deep hitting songs.
literally amazing, as usual!! you guys work your asses off and it always pays off!! ❤❤
Solo puedo decir algo, ARTE
This is amazing! So much time and effort put into one song, and I love it!
This is amazing🎉🎉🎉🎉 I love the music video. Keep on the great work on the music. From Thai fan  🇹🇭here.
My mom and dad had a passion for music. Them both gone I get to share that with my son who LOVES you guys. I can't wait to show him this. This brought tears to eyes seeing how much work you guys do and make it feel and look like this is what you guys where made to do ❤
😂😂😂😂😂🎉
This song is beautifully made and every part of it is amazing ^^
Yes yes yesssssss
I love Ajr and all the music you make. I’ve been listening since I was six. You are and always will be a big part of my life. I’m now eleven and went to your concert in Vegas and loved it so much. It was such an amazing time meeting you! Your my favorite band. I love all of your songs :) ❤
I would write a good comment but I’m just too dumb
So proud of you guys ❤
Let’s gooooo🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😂😂😂😂🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I love it so on point thank you❤😊
This is truly a masterpiece of a song. Great work guys!!❤❤❤❤
I love this song
I saw jack and ryan play wii tennis for 2 seconds and now I NEED them to do a wii sports stream
Here before it goes viral  👇
Se mueren lo que significan para nosotros❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ SON LOS MEJORES DEL MUNDOOO
i've been waiting so long for this
Love it <3
You guys never cease to amaze me! Amazing as always.
god I love these type of music video, just a bunch of fun clips crammed into one video and it’s such a vibe
Omg so good
I'm leaving this here so everytime someone likes it I get reminded of this banger
I finally found someone else who plays WII in 2023!
I really relate to Martin who is tone deaf but wants to be in the room with AJR.
This song isn't dumb, it's amazing! Nice one AJR you've done it again
First AJR song I've gotten to see released!!
ㅇㅁㅇ
These guys are art 💙💞
Can't wait to blast this with the windows down on I 25
I loved it so much ❤️❤️❤️
babadabadada!
sheesh best song from AJR ive ever seen
A little bit of “Christmas in June” melody going on as well.  I admire their ability to do this type of stuff.  Cant wait to see them in concert again
So incredibly proud of y’all. Your songs have gotten me through moments I never thought I’d get through. Thank you.
最高！
not only is your music creative, but the music videos are also always so spot on amazing
Woooo! This song is amazing, and it's so cool and interesting to see how you guys made it! Can't wait for TMM now! :D (I'm so fucking grateful I found this quirky brother trio :,])
LESSGGOOOO
Immediately in love with the song ! Amazing job you guys!
:0
This is absolutely brilliant
This isn't just any music, it seriously has taken so long to hear and it's totally worth the wait. New favorite music :)
omg this is amazing  if ajr replys i will cry   you guys worked hard congrats
Por ustedes le hecho ganas a la vida ✨🌿  Me inspiran 🫶🏻😭
I have been waiting for this song to drop for months ever since they released the first teaser for it. ajr, your music means so much to me!!
I HAVE A THEROY OF WHAT TMM STANDS FOR.  The Met Musical.  They are working on Harold and the purple crayon music.  The album could contain music from the musical.  And assuming they follow the Trend of orchestra, theater album names musical makes sense
Good as always
Me encanta que nos hayan mostrado todo el proceso creativo que llevó a formar esta canción 🤧🤧. Ustedes son grandes 💓
i absolutely love how they incorporrated their friends and neighbour into this song. I thought the background vocals were just one of the AJR team singing and the child voice was some verse from a show or a movie but after seeing how they made this song it truly makes it better!
wow fire
That was awesome! I can’t wait for the next tour and to hear it live!
I like official video
🎉🎉😮
I love you AJR. 🩷
i'm not crying you are. i love you guys so much, you always make me smile ;) ❤
Only 2,000 views
AMAZING WORK ON THIS SONG ITS SO AMAZING ❤❤
Dabi dab didab dab
Love your music!
Early❤
This is pure serotonin.
I KNEW IT AJR SAID THAT THEY COME UP WITH LYRICS WHILE THEY PLAY WII SPORTS AND THEY PLAY TENNIS I KNEW THEY LOOKED LIKE TENNIS GUYS
Ahhh los amo mucho, es increíble como a través de su música pueden compartir sentimientos tan profundos, si lloré viendo este utopico video ❤
Dude that was so good😭😭
A year and a half the grind is real
AJR just doesn't miss 😤✊️
first romanian!
This cured all my sadness.
Only ajr can get these numbers in 10 minutes
❤️❤️❤️❤️
This song is fire
OMGGGGG good song, AJR my life xd
The history with this song is amazing. Its a really good example of what this band is capable of.
This is amazing and thanks for being the band that has helped over all of my hard times
This song made my week
Love it! Can't wait for the full album!
i love this song
I LOVE HOW REAL THIS IS
“I’ll text you that’s enough, that’s how empty headed people get through shitty stuff.”
最高の曲と最高のMVです！
🎉
IM IN THE VIDEO 😭😭😭🫶🏻✨ my lil dot in the ocean and it means the world to me holy shit you guys are the greatest band in the world
Ok this is probably the best music video by AJR. It just felt AJR, same goes with the song. Love it
THIS IS AMAZING AND I  LOVE IT, love seeing how far AJR have come!

Wow! Such a good video, love that we can kinda see inside their world for a little!
I loved seeing the making of this! What a year and a half!!
love ajr, new song is a fire experience
Absolutely incredible journey <3
Clicked faster than my dad
Love ajr❤❤❤❤❤
IT’S FINALLY HERE!! WOOOOOOOO 🎉🎉🎉
The ending with the switch from the normal to it being played in the car was perfect, had to be my favorite part
R.I.P Martin 😂
This album is gonna be the greatest collection of music the world has ever seen
Espere demasiado los amo <33 no sabes que éxisto pero pa mi son un pilar de mi vida c:
No matter what their songs are always a vibe
If this song had NO LYRICS it would still be a 10/10 because of those instrumentals!!!!!!
AAAAAAI LOVE THEM WITH ALL MY HEART 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
That is such a cool idea for a music video!! Love the song, and seeing it’s creation story told on top of it is so clever!😮
좋다 활기찬 봄같다 넘모 좋다
It’s really amazing how their process of making their song is MV-worthy. Kudos, AJR. 💜
This song is a masterpiece
Fireeeeeee
this is amazing! time to put this on repeat for 3 hours now lol 🎉
Here before Saturday April 22 (Earth Day)
So much hard work for this amazing masterpiece!
epic, as always
Absolute masterpiece worth the time it took to make it
Another legend song
This is such an excellent way to make a music video for a song that is such a process. It’s a really cool in depth look
I love this song🎉

This song and everything about it is so amazing. You guys always have a goal and always achieve it and it’s what makes you guys so INCREDIBLE. Not matter what’s get in your way you always manage to finish it, all of your songs have amazing value and you always put it together to make us all happy with your music.

Minha irmã de 4 anos ama vocês e acabou que eu comecei a amar também :D
This is such a good song. Me and my friends were laughing at the name, but it was such a good song. I think it proves that it doesn’t take a good title to make a song good
I LOVE THIS SONG!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
