Watch Richard Hammond's new discovery+ show here: http://bit.ly/4q0eVu7
How does anyone make money on cars that take years to finish and are worth 30k at auction after three redoos
1:10 love the hint of the brummie accent! Pretty much natural Hammond!
lol who edited this? ferrari 760RR maybe Pagani Zonda 760BR
I love the mk2 RS2000 it was my favourite car when I was a kid lol
What color was that slr next to the zonda? Gorgeous!
Love the fun of the Zonda
Jensen caravan towing car
Who else is deeply offended that he didn’t show the F1 in detail
Easy come, easy go!
The chapters say "Ferrari 760BR", but should say "Pagani Zonda 760 VR"
I think I might be tired of seeing Richard Hammond show off his money
Yeah I’d have the RS2000.
Does anyone know the name of the silver car on the right at 0:16?
i like how he and may and the rest of the team of course are putting time and effort into this channel it has some kind of wholesome feeling to it now
Richard Hammond is so on point right now, very watchable and entertaining.
Who else thought they were going to see Hammond sell a Pagani
So you gonna walk past that MCL F1 and not even pause for it....
I absolutely agree that seeing a well used Pagani is the best of all worlds.
At least you have had these cars Richard mare x
You don’t need that pagani little man you’ll only crash it like that other thing you wrote off
I was at Le Mans a few years back for the 24hr having an ale or 3 at the restaurant on the Mulsanne straight, the car park was full with a few Porsches, a Ferrari or two and Astons, but surrounded by people looking over it was a natty old JPS Capri. The faces on the other cars owners when everyone was looking at the Ford and not their exotica was hilarious.. dream car aren’t always the most expensive.
Of cause he saving his money 💰 to by an overpriced eletric car or maybe a e cycle 🚲 🤔, I suppose he'll be contacting  triang for his cycle.
Does anyone know what the red car BEHIND the 911, from 1:30 - 2:10 is? I first thought it was a Fiat V8 Supersonic, but that is not the case. It has a bit of Alfa Romeo Giulietta SS Prototipo Bertone in the nose, but I don't think that's it either. Any help?
outro music please
Really genuinely surprised Hammond has some nice cars left that he didn't crash.
fund for the payment of NASA space
Hammond down bad....you need to tell the rest of your family (witch are all women btw)to tone it down with the shopping sprees
They know that REAL STATE and CAR market is going to crash.
Glass fiber.      NO ITS FIBERGLASS!!!  YOU LOT ALWAYS GOTTA BE DIFFERENT AND WEIRD FOR NO REASON. LOL
I wish Jeremy was in this videos giving his opinion like the old days
I wish he spoke about that glorious SLR MSO!
zzz.. give me a few k car which still gets me from A to B
So much cars...money and still empty life
0:18 that’s a mclaren f1 gtr or f1 with the downforce kit or whatever they call them 😩😩🤤🤤🤤🤤🤤
my dad had a black rs2000 custom. 79 as well I think. he loved it, and sold it for 2 grand in the 90's, which is still his biggest regret. still his absolute dream car to this day.
I have to agree with Hammond, that Zonda really is beautiful
Best car to buy is a proper used car/ daily driven cars .
Wonder what the rs2000 will go for?
Strapped for cash?
What about the mclaren f1 i saw
"I believe you can link to it below, in a clever digital fashion."
Nothing on this video states or says from Mr Richard Hammond that he is selling a car?  😂
You can tell it was not Italian designed :)
3:10 🌠חוצפה🌠
this is type of place Hammond would run into Alan Partridge - and then Alan would tell the tale on his podcast about that time he ran into Richard Hammond on that 'pleasingly conservative car show'.
4:45 At least that man was appreciating it.
Just walks past a mclaren f1 gtr like it’s nothing 😂😂😂
Just waiting for the moment he has to sell his house lol
He can make his own TV series for Netflix touring the world in interviewing people with rare exotic vehicles because of his status in the industries and his TV fame. But he also has that personality where he can make things funny and come up with jokes on the spot but still have class to have that professional look which I think would help make it more entertaining to watch..than some of these other car shows
He's A used car salesman now.
RS2000 is such a classic, its beautiful...
Selling another car hahahaha and the thumbnail is a pagani lol
LOVE YOU HAMMOND! <3 <3
Richard Hammond's a clown, I refer you all to Stewart lee
Man I hope this new adventure works out for you.
I have heard he needs a phone book because he can't reach the pedal.....
Beautiful 901
4:37  "Sport scar"?  Perhaps someone should take a moment to explain what a, "sports car" is to Hamster.
Richard Hammond selling a car ermmm were u drips
When grand tour back on boys jesus
I think Richard needs a new job
No way that shop or show will survive.... Unless Discovery Channel saves it. How do you try to set up a brand new hi tech show before you build your first car..?
I love Hammond, but why does he say certain words differently? GlassFiber? when everyone knows it's FiberGlass. The origin and conception of FiberGlass comes from the year 1933 in Illinois USA. The old name used to be Glass Wool, perhaps that is why Hammond says Glass Fiber? Love the content.
This guy is very popular, why? Am I the only one that finds him annoying?
That rs 2000 is the 2nd best car in history after the mk1 Mexico in Liverpool back in the 80s 90s them cars were the bollocks
The Baron drove that Jenson in the TV series of the same name
All I see is a used car salesman.
Hamster is broke selling too many cars it says u broke
Feel like I’m watching a classic episode of top gear. Top quality content 👌🏼
can i pay in nft i valeu them at 12 millions pounds ill send the .png
Got a nice 78 Silver Shadow for sale
Love the Zonda
.
Selling another liability, but he needs to put the time in his shop
Hammond court. An exclusive car showroom in bromley.
it  look  like  he  is   selling   his   cars  because  there  is  no  moor  top  gear  and  he  is  not  getting    the   wage   he  was  getting   with  the  bbc  top  gear
When will it be possible to watch Hammond's workshop in Germany? It has not been released here yet :(
Jesus this guy must be going through a divorce
He is 100% broke
Richard, you could introduce any car and I would watch, just to see you and hear you talk! The Queen should Knight you already for being a great Englishman / ambassador for England to the rest of the world (according to this American).
Richard, please stand on the side of the frame.  Its the car we want to see - cheers!
I miss them....their talent and passion belong on a important network with a show airing at a specific time that YOU the viewer must honor and make time for...because it is quality programming....having content at your fingertips is nice, but it’s not special, it’s not a event ....a shared moment across a country and continents in these guys’ case.......
Can we stop saying fiberglass is lightweight? It just isn't true.
The Zonda having 55k Km in the odometer is truly the most remarkable thing about it, considering the shape it's in. Really well-maintained! Props to the original owner!
Gotta love how they just walked by the mclaren F1….
A Jensen was driven by the Baron ( Steve Forrest)  in the TV series.
So when are you going to check out Jay Leno's garage
Wasn't the Evija at this event, too?
The Untalented Hammond once again...would this absolute bore just go away.
Why do British pronounce it ZondaR?
He not a real hamster,
I though the title said "crashed another one", my bad.
I have $10 with your name on it!
Cash is better.
This dude hasnt owned a comb in more than a decade.
He’s so knowledgeable I’m a Porsche man love them and never knew that fact
My old boss owns the VR. Named after his wife Vicky Robinson. His name is Anthony Robinson. Seen this car many times in the flesh. Beautiful car!
never liked this one
Poor poor poor Richard.... Not.
I live in a city and dont' drive a ton. 55,000 KM over 7 years is what I drive my little avante every year.
Who cares
Is Richard Hammond Jewish?
Jenson was based in west Bromwich, which is in the Black Country NOT Birmingham. He of all people should know this.
Thats intersting about the 901 - 911 story.  Im into vintage RX mazdas and the Europeans had a 818 where the rest of the world got a 808.  Peugeot did the same thing to Mazda.
We had 21hr days lol   They !
He have so many cars
when I saw that ford I thought it was a lifted ford pinto for like a half a second
McLaren F1 LM. My absolute favorite car ever ever!!
*You'll be crazy not to sell in this current environment of made up car prices* 👏
For crying out loud change this music
I don’t know if I am crazy or I just don’t know enough about cars but I feel before they made more beautiful looking cars now with all the computers and electronics look way more uglier to me
Commander Philip Heseltine is mentioned in  Peter Swinger's book 'Motor Racing Circuits in England'  On Snetterton circuit it mentions that Commander Heseltine was a stalwart of the club, and one evening in the early 1960's he arrived with his wife Biddy at the clubhouse to find that Jim Russell had just completed a 24-hour reliability trial in a Vauxhall. During the evening Commander Heseltine asked Jim Russell if he would like a cup to commemorate the feat. The offer was accepted and a tradition developed whereby the record established by Jim Russell's Vauxhall was challenged in later years. There was only one basic rule to challenge for the Commander's Cup which was that the vehicle used had to be an unmodified production saloon; the rule was later changed to allow any production car to make the challenge.
Highlight? Eeeeeh what about the F1?
There is a car at 17 seconds in we see from an aerial shot, the silver one with the boot open... Does anyone know what the car is please?
Some absolutely fantastic cars there …but I have to say the ford RS 2000 is just a fantastic car had one many moons ago and yes wish I still had it today so to see that car there was just perfect well done mr Hammond 👍
Wait, why can't I watch this? Is it just in the UK?
After you sell your first car.  Every car after is another car.
The Jensen is absolutely gorgeous 😍
15 years later from today, the Zonda would still look fresh. This is a design from 20 years ago. Amazing.
So what in this video was showing Hammond sell another car?
Countach is the number one car over there - then F1, F50, F40 :D
Always makes me happy to see supercars ACTUALLY being driven and not just sitting stationary in some banker’s garage with 15km on the odo.
Did anyone spot a db5? I need his opinion on DBs
Please don't clickbait... you made it look like Richard owned and was selling the zonda....
😊
Sell it and buy a few superbikes instead
Anymore Hammond workshop???
Stirling piece of click-bait there, Sirs!👏🙃
32 red beatles. :)
The reason behind the change from 901 to 911 is more complex. Peugeot did not object to BMW using 501, 502 or Ferrari using 308... But the Peugeot family held a grudge against the Piech family since WWII, when Anton Piech was put in charge of their factories by the Nazis...
"If you can afford it then why not drive it every day?" Because rich people buy investments and supercars go  up  in value so that years  later a mint zonda with almost no miles can be sold for a lot more than it was bought for. However, if I could afford a Zonda I would daily drive it but then I'm poor so I'm not smart and I'm doing it wrong
I might be a dork, but I really like that  little ford... Fug the rest.
With all these "rare" car shows all around the world I still have yet to see a toyota 2000gt on display that isn't behind museum glass.
they cleverly avoid showing the interior of the zonda because its automatic and not desirable. SAD!!!
still shocked you didn't show us the Le Mans porche.
I saw that zonda at goodwood fos last year
Perfect pronunciation of Chutzpah... ;)
Was that not a McLaren F1 LM?? Wouldn’t that be something to talk about?
Richard Hammond?  The guy that has crashed the highest number of cars.  Has low driving skills but still being given some cars to review!  Unbelievable...
I know how it feels to work hard and buy what you want (in my case motorcycles) then when you have them and never use them it seems pointless buying them in the 1st place so you end up selling them. Yes you may make money but there are better ways of doing that. I know your into bikes Richard are you in the market for any?
It's a shame we cant watch the Workshop show. I thoroughly enjoyed the few episodes that used to be on youtube
Oh, beetle again...
That McLaren F1 GTR though.
I feel like that yellow F1 has been mentioned on VinWiki a few times...
I Thought Hammond was loaded.
Who films the video like this? Barely can see the car
Not exactly Pebble Beach. lol
👍👍👍
wasnt that cv8 from the tv program The Baron in the 60's?
Every time Hammond sells a car, I message his Instagram this message: “HAMMOND YOU BLITHERING IDIOT!!” Edit: restraining order acquired and I have been ordered a cease and desist.
Hairstyle by boris?
Did he just walk right past a McLaren F1 LM?
Richard talking about Porce?? didn't know he liked those...
Oh so he’s selling another matchbox.
It just goes to show just how much silly money these tv " Presenters " 😀.....  get paid enabling them to buy a fleet of classic cars and then whinging because they have to sell them because they are skint..... 💩💩💩
Thank youuuuuuu for valuable car content <3
Better you keep your cars if you have no debts buddy…the economy is breaking down. The € will not longer exist in a couple of years ✌️
My dad has a beige rs2000 from 1980
what a disappointment
You know your rich when you have driven 55k km in a super rare car
Smug as....
He's just clearing garage space really. We can see through it.
So which car is he selling?
He doesn't need to sell his cars. He has plenty of money. His yearly salary from Amazon is 7 million dollars. This is all staged.
: )
The first super car I ever seen used that much... 55000 is more than my father's Megan in 6 to 7 years
Why does this channel always use click bait. People don’t like feeling tricked into watching videos
Richard! Why don’t you ask people to send you money like every normal celebrity does.
Whats the red beauty behind the jensen
Richard's comments on the Pagani Zonda are spot on. Brilliant insight about the essentially ridiculous nature of supercars (although we all still want one), and Zonda's joyful embrace of it in their styling.
Would love to watch the show if it was available in the US.
Is it just me or would hammond love a schirmer V8 gt with a 4,4 liter stroker
Get the jensons into forza
Sell a Lamborghini or Aston martin
No Richard buy back a zonda
Not a zonda Richard
Guy with lots of money sells something. Expensive. This feels more like the fall of Rome, every day...
Just shows just how much money he 'earned' at the BBC
Brilliant to see a Jensen cv8 mentioned. My dad's favourite car, and my son is named after it for dad... Minus the cv8 bit 😅 beautiful car
Next up Richard sells a kidney!
I would have that Rs over any super car.  At least I could afford the fuel, road tax and insurance 😂
manual Zonda or auto?
Mr Richard you and Mr James you are  A Brave men .. A full Respect  from me .. hope for you all a great  happiness life ..Enjoy .
No one gonna talk about the McLaren F1 at 2:19?
Racist
Grishney Hommond.
Waste of time
Looks like Hammond's fallen for the old 'boot polish on the didgeridoo' trick.
This is old tho isn’t it. He’s sold it now on his discovery plus program
My mother's always told me if a business you are opening can't pay for itself its not a business.....hammond. Your going backwards people go into business to afford those cars. Not sell them to get into business .
Jensen cv8..THE BARON..TV SERIES.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA6nSkCTeNE
Yawn  Yes I could unsub, but it's the hamster selling a car, I yawn at
When i was a teenager in the 80s all i wanted was a RS2000 and i never got to own one. Sad life
great production value guys!  you simply keep improving.  i could listen to hammond excitedly tell me about cars all day!
0:17s - On center screen. the car on right... straight lines...grey, what his brand name/model?
Take that Jerry Seinfeld! Naw I bet Seinfeld's got a 901.
I thought he was the one selling the zonda I was gonna freak if he gave that car away for the show 😂
Can't wait for Hammond to drive the new z06 corvette!
Clickbait at it's worst. UNSUBSCRIBED!!!!
You'll own nothing and be happy Richard. 😳🤔👍 NWO and agenda 2030 is coming.
My dream car it looks stunning I want it so much
With the rapid onset of electric cars... all celebrity stock will be up for grabs. Formally a great investment is becoming a nightmare for these guys
time trimming beard: 180 minutes. time combing hair: 0 minutes
NSX.  You know you wanna.
2:50  Richard spending the last 20 years hanging around James May is starting to show through! Sounded just like him!
CV8 first 150mph car you could buy. My Uncle had a few, great cars.
I know this is off topic and a little inappropriate but .... why do i derive so much pleasure from stealing from a large corporation ? ...I dont know . But NOT YOU SMALLEST COG ! I wish you all the success.
Nice Jensen
When he said the best car here i was hoping to see oliver
It's not going to win anything with that anachronistic and black number plate.
From what I’ve seen of Richard’s recent YouTube videos, he’s unbelievably dedicated to his new show of rescuing classic cars. Which reminds me of Wheeler Dealers, which has lovers and haters. I’m guessing Richard has seen Wheeler Dealers, wonder if he’s a lover or hater of it.
"The Intercepters", wasn't that your "Code Names"? Frank Williams gone, how sad is that? RIP Frank, I'm sure you will be catching up with Colin.
What is the silver car at 17 seconds 🤔
Love the music to this
A car that takes 2 years to restore just means lazy work force and over paid.
0:21 There used to be TWO of these stuck outside a petrol station in Lowton, Lancashire in the 1980s. Never failed to grab my attention.
Does anybody know what car is behind the Porsche at 1:59?
A Jensen like that was in the London Spy TV series. Beautiful looking car and sounds fabulous.
That Porsche 901 is as common as much compared to the Aston Martin Bulldog that you didn't highlight !
Woe was me!  I’m wealthy and had to sell a car that useless besides on a track.  Give me pity everyone who can barely afford to lease a car!
That Zonda will never be topped. Painfully beautiful and mechanically perfect.
Why does it have an Irish reg?
Horrible little man i think you would all agree......
I see the zonda getting all the love (understandably) but the racing green slr on its right in the racing green is just gorgeous
You should show Prince Andrew your car, he likes 20 year old escorts
Poor hammond, having to watch people go through long days in a rush to get his car ready for a show that HE put it in for... awwwww, my heart bleeds.
He doesn’t say it’s for sale?
Those teeth whitening kits must be more expensive than I thought.
awesome video
As you said the car was never gonna win anything especially with rotten rubbers round the rear light lens's and that paint finish, never worth rushing anything
Thats a clear piece of memory i dont hear often, peugot not allowing porsche to use an 01 reference. Thats insane to think thats the real reason its the 911
👍❤️
can we have a new word, supercars, hypercars, cars that you cant afford even if you win the lotto
Has it been crashed rolled or on fire within your ownership 😂
is it us legal
Wow…. This is life of the rich and the spoiled right here.
had a fake rs2000 never raced or rallid and only one crash and that's what killed it
So the thumbnail of Hammond standing next to a Zonda was clickbait really as the rs2000 was a car he bought to do up & sell.Cheap move
I find the lack of the word "pantomime" in this video... disturbing...
Eat the rich
Don’t do it son - fortunes can be lost on dreams of businesses that drain money - know one made money rebuilding old cars .. the money is buying and selling them !!
HEY RICHARD! You know your link opens up to Discovery US when we folks over in America click on your link. Your Show ISN'T on Discovery in the USA! WHEN are YOU going to FIX THAT!:
Shatap you small man
Whoever resorts your cars is overpriced and waiting way to long two years for a Jensen hahaha try 6 months in the states
You cant sell that. You're never going to be able to replace that Zonda
Mr H.  First thing in a new business is to make sure you pay yourself.  Selling off anymore cars is just draining.  Tell the garage time to bring in the money if not the garage may be required to close for a while. Turn off the tap.
Nice guy - but the weird 'tash & beard!!!!!
Most annoying hamster you've ever come across
love the rs
1500 guid buy it
I cannot believe that Zonda has actually been driven that far, owner probably knows their cars very well
Owners who actually drive their million dollar Zondas deserve every ounce of respect. Cars are meant to be driven!
Absolutely in love with that Zonda.  Horacio makes a truly fantastic job.
There is a mini interview with Mr.Pagani on how it all started really interesting to listen about his ambition to be up there with the likes of Ferrari and Lamborghini. Also do check out on Davide Cironi who is the guy who interviews Mr.Pagani. https://youtu.be/39th-z966Zw
The ham, is just being a ham , famous for it,  he's only selling, cause he doesn't dig it and doesn't want it.
SOoooooo I literally JUST signed up and paid for discovery+ via the link in this video. I signed up SOLELY for this latest Hammond adventure, The Smallest Cog. According to the discovery+ customer service, this show isn’t aired yet and they don’t even have a release date.   I’m a little less than impressed and not sure who with, discovery+ or the fact this video gives the impression this show is being currently aired, and through a paid subscription is available to view when it is in fact NOT :0/
I am the owner of the Zonda... No, actually. No, I am not...
so nice when that random presenter is not in the episode. I only want to see the trio
Ummm, is Hammond broke?
Oh poor Richard Hammond is having to sell another car..ohh Woh is me
I thought Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen stepped in for Richard for a second 😃
Cool Guy!
cool
Watch him lose all his money
Why ??
Tell him to check his dm’s I want to sponsor his garage
How do you contact ‘The Smallest Cog’ in regards to getting work carried out? Thanks!
When's your show coming to discovery+ in Canada?
A little remembered attempt at setting a record whilst towing a caravan was made by Stewart Plimpton in 1978. He used a Z28 to pull an Airstream Bambi on a deserted stretch of Roanoke beach. Unfortunately, it was after consuming too many adult beverages, and he unwisely attempted to set a record for the fastest 0 to 100 mph to 0 time.
He will go bankrupt before his business lol
Eat the rich
I knew that was Hampton Court Palace from the thumbnail
Fair Play for a 7 week turn around but the black and silver plates are all wrong
Let's go Brandon!
Mr. Hammond, if you have to keep selling cars to fund your shop, than perhaps your over extending yourself a bit. Having your own business is fantastic, but if that business venture goes under are you prepared for that financial possibility?. Employees still need to be payed, severance pay etc.  Be careful mate !!.
Anyone in the comments know about the Commander's Cup?
I was at a car show at this venue a little while ago, had a beautiful blue 250gto as the centrepiece, i think it's joe macari's not sure tho
Pip squeak!
awesome video
nine eleven does have a better ring to it than a nine o one, pugs can keep it
The panel gaps on that Jensen are terrible!
Doesn't Hammond love cars anymore?
Never display something that’s not completed ……
Richard  loose 10 sell  1 ... No dont want to pay to you show like
It’s strange with all the millions he has, he still needs to sell cars to raise thousands, not millions to finance his new shop.
I could’ve watched this for another hour !
55,000 miles, is that taking it from one show to the next.
the Zonda is one of the most phenomenal cars ever imo - so much emotion and beauty, people who say it’s over-designed need more joy in their lives
Did you guys knew that Zonda have made also a Superbike?! Yeah and is fast af but also SOOOO beautiful!
That Jensen makes me all sorts of funny in my tummy.
So he is selling his fixed cars, just to be able, to let fix cars for other people....???
At 00:17 do I see an overhead shot of an Aston Martin 'Bulldog' ??
Wait. Solid axle with leaf springs !?  I've been spoiled by Citroen and their suspensions.
I suspect mr. Hammond has started to dye his hair... And goatee
he knows soon this cars will be soon just showcase material, sadly, so prices will fall down dramatically..
Kinda annoying that you can only get discovery+ in UK or Ireland, means I can't watch Hammond's show here in South Africa
Still cant watch the show in the US....
Clever move , cars will be worthless junk in 18 months .
Richard Hammond car sale channel!
Hammond sells car May sells gin Clarkson sells vegetable
Never been interested in supercars, but that RS2000 is simply fantastic.
1:45 And it comes from the days you had a hole in place of the 0, where you can use a crank to start your Peugeot.
Zonda looks better with age looks somewhat normal now.
These days, I can’t see a video of Hammond without being reminded of Mr Toad from The Wind in the Willows
i was heartbroken when i saw the picture well i mean firstly i was happy to find out he owns one and then sad that he was selling it but now im just happy to know that if he owned one he wouldnt sell it, but also sad that he doesnt own one. basically a rollercoaster
Show us the mclaren right next to the zonda.
Love the 901!!!!
Amazon dont do retirement funds hence why he selling 👍
I really like Hammond but I just can not feel sorry for a multi multi multi millionaire when he says he has to sell one of his massive fleet of vehicles
Zonda is nice! But still not faster!
I can't believe they just skipped over that McLaren F1 LM.
Love, Love, Love !!
ZV plates on RS 2000  ... Irish reg.
This is quite clearly clickbait 👎🏼
a toy store for grown up petrol heads
The level of detail in that RS2000 restoration is absolutely incredible - down to the recreation of the orange peel!
1:24 that was mr bean!
That Zonda is automotive art!
The Zonda is my ultimate dream car. Unique
Pity it is not a MK 1 RS 2000 much better looking car
I'm confused... what's the car he's selling? the car he bought to sell?
And he forgot to mention over half the mileage on his RS2000 will have been added by epople who didn't own the car or even bother getting permission from the owner before taking it for a drive.
7 weeks lol car s.o.s would of done it in 2 haha
He sounds just like Adrian Chiles when he does the Brummie accent 😂😂😂
LOVE IT 😍 My dad had one with a factory motor kit. He honed around with it. T
That rs 2000 is amazing  I was lucky enough a few years back to actually see a pagani zonda in Singapore and actually touch it  It was special model as well and I got some fantastic photos  👍👍👍
Does the RS2000 have Irish plates on it?
Sell to me cheap cheap
It was my great uncle who drove the Jensen in the caravan towing record. He wasn't a Brum though, he was from Norfolk. I think the record was set in Cambridgeshire (though could be wrong on that bit).
If i could afford 1 car in my life it would be the Zonda i think its a living breathing thing of beauty. But i'm not i'm a pauper so i will continue to ride my Z900 and love every freezing wet winter day the uk can throw at me. i'M NOT BITTER AT THE HAND FATE AS DEALT ME... Honest :-)
Pagani name their one-off builds after the owners….was the Zonda VR commissioned by one Valentino Rossi?
What? No three wheel reliant robins? Call that a car show?
Sean Connery famously had a CV8. He preferred it to the DB5.
Richard looks like he's been on the sauce 😳
That smallest cog place sound like a terrible place to work
Some nice cars in this video.  James May attempted the caravan towing speed record using a Mitsubishi Evo VII in series 2 episode 6 of TG.
click baity, much?
I feel for you man
Hammond needs to sent his lazy privileged wife and kids out to work rather than scrounging off the back of his money and fame
Would love to be able to watch the show in New Zealand
Now the question is...............can you find a Marina or Hillman Hunter* pick up as a company " car "...
Clickbait this time !
McLaren GTR: Hey guys I'm over here. Hey where you going?
oh come on drivetribe .. utter clickbait so Hammond can plug his new series & business .. that's really sinking to new depths
Come on! Enough with the clickbait. You were implying Richard was selling that Pagani Zonda, a car that if I owned would rather sell my wife, kids, house, kidneys and almost anything to own and NEVER ever sell. I absolutely love the berserkness of them, and that is a gorgeous looking example.
At this rate, the house will be next, poor guy. Hang in there and best of luck.
Misleading titles
It's a Ford  It belongs there
I'd watch your show if I could.
Hope you aren’t going broke!please Richard stop using km it’s miles, for smiles not kilos for lilos (d)…
Pretty soon he's going to be selling his kidney too
I really wish I could watch your show. I have discovery plus but it just doesn't show up.
Seeing some orange peel in the Escort's paint job. Something to correct with the gun/paint blend/booth temperature and dryness.
А где капитан улитка? 🐌
The Zonda has been driven more in 5 years than my shitbox has been for over 11 years.
The Jensen is a nice looker
Click here to watch my new show. I love this. I’ll click that. Sure I’ll set up a subscription to this if I can watch Richard Hammond’s new show. Then after all of that, I can’t watch it after all. Very unprofessional and dishonest. Richard, you should know I’ve paid to see this just to see you. I think you rock, but I’m very disappointed that after paying for a subscription I can’t watch you.
That whole show and hamster couldnt find a single rustang to go with those womens high heel cowboy boots he wears?
Hammond is one step from taking a bus to work.
I'd take the RS 2000 over every other car there.
o dear there is some funny paint on that rear hope it was camera angle r h love u
Ham-mond!!!
i actually love old ford models..that thing there is a beauty!
There it is the only Aston Martin Bulldog ever built.
That yellow Mclaren F1 GTR😍
man richard hammond needs to start his own version of that show "Chasing Classic Cars", would be dope
I can't not hit the dislike for the clickbait. Sorry, not sorry.
I love the rs2000 what a machine....down under they where much loved !
And what about the McLaren f1 Probably the most interesting car about the show and no mention about it
Rarest production car XA falcon GTHO only 3 made.
Anyone notice Hammond's finger nails are disgusting?
Will you take a cheque?
0:17 anyone know what the boxy silver sports car in the centre is? Looks like a cross between a DeLorean and a Countach
I believe Sean Connery was quite a fan of the Jensen CV8, apparently he drove one in period despite his association with that *other* company....
Hammonds worship is only for UK 😭
I'll buy the RS2000, just give me a few years of saving up 😂
Not often background music bothers me. But this was so annoying
hahaha love the 'Hutspa' ! much love from israel !
I wish you would stop promoting a show that I CAN'T WATCH BECAUSE I AM NOT IN THE UK!
And what car exactly was for sale?  I've never before watched this channel or the show? but the title of this video and simply from a credibility point of view. I'm OUT.
I like seeing these behind the scenes portions from the show
Christ, that paint has more orange peel than Jaffa's
I will always remember watching richard hammond drive the pagani zonda one of the episodes that has stuck with me for my whole life.
4:40 Hammond playing with his junk. A sight I'll never be able to unsee...
At this point, maybe just tell is what he has left...
🚙 🥰
The Ford got parked out by the back shed and the Port-a-Potties. Appropriate. 👍 😃
If only Hammond's workshop was available in the United States legally I wouldn't have to stream it in a pirated fashion like everyone else in the United States has to. In the interest of full disclosure, I am paying for a discovery plus subscription right now because I feel guilty stealing. I watch nothing else on discovery plus, I've looked for some redeeming series to no avail. I've even deleted the app off of my phone and TVs because of the lack of quality programming outside of Hammond's workshop.
Just watched the Episode 6. 🙂👍👍👍. Love this show much much more than the great escapists.
That McLaren F1 Le Mans ♥️♥️♥️♥️
It s not the car you own but who you get int the passenger seat that counts. The secret to a car is the doors it opens, the onlookers who have to chat, and the invites
Can you watch Hammond's show in the US?
Love how as soon as he said its not going to win or turn any heads,  that dad in the background was eyeing it up and down
Looks like it was filmed 6 months ago not last week
What car is that yellow car at 2:17?
Click bait
Just think of Richard had a Pagani Zonda 760. Would it be called 760 RH, Rich, Hamster, Ham?🤔
The Jenson Interceptor looks so effin cool there
Pagani is just the business regardless which one it is!!!!   :::=^)
Hammond is worth £34 million so don’t k no ow why he’s selling all his cars for?must be board of them
I absolutely agree that seeing a well used Pagani is the best of all worlds.
Was that a 250 gto next to the 9o1 ?
still watch the episode when Richard reviewed Sesto Elemento at Emola 😆
Come on now Richard, you'll have to give up the Just For Men soon.
About Peugeot object to middle zero 901, how did 70's Mazda 808 survive
Clarkson got 1 million pounds Per top gear episode. Wonder with hammond and may got?
No comments on the F1 come on
Just shove a mill in a off shore account and pay ya bills of the interest mate 👍   Sure you got that ..?
I'm disappointed that it only sold for £33,000
The car looks great 👍....
It's amazing how you can get all that done and be on Red Pike chating  with my next door nabour just a few days ago. Top stuff
These 3 guys have given me so many memories and entertainment. A big reason why i became a car enthusiast. Really hope they gain success in all their businesses
who fking cares
Rs2000 for me all the way
that 901 is so incredible!!! i love it!
Love when the lads host a video, of course I love Mike and all the drive tribe team too but it feels like a mini TG or GT episode whenever one of the trio take the lead
i think hammond favorite supercar is the zonda  when i watch top gear
Great Brummie Accent
McLaren F1 LM? 🤦‍♂️
I agree - the RS is the best car on show :-)
Peugeot? I thought it was Saab that objected to Porsche using 901, because Saab was already using that number. I could be wrong though.
The RS2000 is still in Irish plates?? Is it coming back to Ireland??
The Jenson would be great if it didn't have those weird and unnecessary headlights.
I like my MkII RS2000s, excellent car, but yours looks like its sitting too high at the back? What suspension have you put on it?
When he said best there...seriously thought he would walk over to the McLaren F1...
boohoo a multi millionaire selling  cars
Who knew that (Richard Hammond - Sleep + LowFi) = magical relaxation
Richard hammond really does try this best to seem a blue collar working man even though he's worth many many millions of pounds.
I'll have the CV8 all day long please...absolute class. And not one mention of The Baron tv series 😉
It’s not click bait it’s a beautiful video
You're famous about the love of caravans.... Hoo00
Love Pagani. Loved their factory tour and museum. Best part of my Italy vacation and not really that close.
Hey , just go to the cash point.
Obligatory hairnet in the Zonda! ;)
Give ya a quid for her
I could listen to Richard talk about cars all day
Hey Lucy Brown, did some intern post this?  Selling another car?
Richard should be in Peaky Blinders just so we can hear more of his Birmingham accent
I found the following o a chat site. The Commander's Cup 24-hour was a distance record trial for a single car. As a said a Sabre Six won it in 1964, previous winners I think include a Jensen 541. Later the Willhire included the Commander's Cup as the first single car entry past the post and that of course included Martin Brundle and others - so clubbie yes but nevertheless a tad higher up the food chain than a 750 MC meeting at Lydden!
What a click bait, i knew it, as I've already seen the show and the guys are behind hahaha
I would pay $50 just to sit in that orangey yellow McLaren F1 GT.
Oh wow look at the amount of cars there I'd love to have been there to look at the cars and take pictures  📸
Richard Hammond looks more like Rod Stewart every day.
Karmann Ghia wanna be.
The RS looks awesome and done really quickly, if I could afford it I'd get you to put my bmw back together.  👍
4:45 look at the guy behind Hammond , he week was just made seeing that car
Hi. Discovery plus says that I should be in the UK or Ireland to subscribe and view your content. Why?  Thabang Sithole  South Africa
I see a lot of clickbait comments, but he never said which car he was selling.  Personally i thought it had prime Top Gear vibes and twist lolz.
CV8 was the most relaxing car I've ever borrowed, well upgraded, brakes that work, should've bought it ...but 8-11mpg
55 thousand on the super car is wild.
Someone tell RH that if you're an American, in America, with an American Discovery+ account, you cannot watch the show. Fix that post-haste!
Richard looks like he stayed up all night in a brothel
Really!!  Some of us less fortunate peasants have only the one shagged out car and have to live with it. Maybe you feel charitable and can tidy up my Cooper (nope, it’s not even an S!) Richard. 🥺
Woh.. f1lm
does it smell like him? if yeah im willing to pay 2 million
The show isn’t in the United States 😭
Let’s hold a concert for Richard .
Is the show comming to europe soon or is it going to stay available only for UK and Ireland
👌
Richard Hammon, 51 years without haircut. Is that illeagal in UK to control your hair?) lol.
Master baiter.
Love the vibes with the lofi and Hammond calming talking about cars. Thank you drivetribe
Zonda is a car that has ray guns on it and that wow factor that a lot of modern hypercars lack.
Hamster should apply for a used car dealer license!
Err and what.......
Cmon drivetribe!  Don’t start with the bs!  You’ll lose subs.
when a channel like DT goes to clickbaiting. I give it full heartedly a thumbs down. We all should do that.
Definitely some beard dye going on Richard 🤣
Shame on you @drivetribe.
The RS was the best car there…..
Nice to see one of the trio reminding us why they are still the best in the business. (Lots of great YouTubers.. but)
Great video but thumbs down for bs clickbait
CLICKBAIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
you doing ok richard? :(
Next video: "Richard Hammond is selling his wife, daughter and two dogs".
I know hammond didn't own a zonda but no the less that thumbnail is pure clickbait 😅 I'm guessing drivetribe struggling for views 👀
after all of that great cars Hammond present the best thing on the ford is tires
The zonda is a timeless classic
The thumbnail, selling an old pagani is like dumping all your bitcoin in 2017
Funny thing is for pure driving bliss and usable power on the road the rs2000 would be the most fun out of any car there
Paid for by the British public subjugated into paying for a TV license, by a very dodgy law that is just a tax payable to the BBC.
Your amazing 👏.
4:28 please tell me you’re going to replace those dry rotted tail lights
Ok, so he’s not selling the Pagani in the thumbnail? Cool…
Are we supposed to comment, like, subscribe? I am not sure, as long as there is no James May involved telling me. 😁
Well done to the owner of that beautiful Zonda for using it
I wonder if BMW's 507 pre-dated Peugeot's rights to the zero.
Please leave out the music Richard, thanks
Click Baiting liars = DRIVETRIBE = unsubscribed
We would've clicked on this video even without the bait.
irish reg on the RS2000 ..... what on earth is that doing in your hands ?
Man 55k km Zonda. Ut warms my heart when I hear it. Hats of to the owner for treating a car like it should be treated. He's a legend
retropowercars are tooling new moulds for the Jensen C-V8 if they ever finish that Morris.
Knowing that was Hammonds car, if i was at that show, i woulda been all over it. Looks stunning.
Another one bites the dust.
Most of us are lucky to own one car and then lucky if it's under 10yrs old..
Rs2000 not Mexico better in white black is nice but black trim on white body 20 ltr it was more like 1986 cc
Probably a kit mclaren F1, cause they skipped it...
1:25 Sounding like Mr Bean
that ford might not sell in the auction but it will make ford fans talk about it or some ford fan might buy it.
Of all the cars…he picks out that Jensen..But then he has a goatee…still..
Hamster move out of the way I need to look more closely at that wonderful machine - that John Deere ATV - spectacular!
If he did advertised the auction on this channel before actually selling it maybe it would have done better. Just saying 😅
How much £ do you want for the RS2000?
okay so who else would love to watch the show but don't want to/objectively object to the premise of signing up for yet ANOTHER service
Why is hammy selling all his cars surely he dosent need to this guy must be a multi zillionair...
Want to support but can't have a account there not in UK or in Ireland
I think the CV8 looks better than the Interceptor.  Yeah.  I said it.
what did hee do to his camera man? the filter they use makes him appear orangy, or maybe i just tweaked my pc for too long
It’s reeeeeeally hard to watch Hammond talk about a 911 without Jeremy stepping in and saying something about the beetle
That place really has some rich and lucky dudes and dudettes huh
Isn’t that the Baron’s car
Hamster - well done with the RS!
You guys ready for the new trailer tomorrow? The Grand Tour
The Ferrari F 40!    Wow!
jezza would love the red beetle
Richard Hammond = GOAT presenter.
The two letters on the end of the Zonda indicate the original customer. I wonder who could be VR 😁
so this show is a show where Hammond sounds like James May ???
Richie, wanna me to buy you some bread? Im worried about you man.
Is the RS2000 for sale?
Boooooo!! Don't click bait us with old news released after the fact, 👎 from me
Nice and calm event. Makes one almost forget that the End Times have begun  ..........
Same engine as my 1991 for transit BT box van :o) I bet the RS2000 is quicker :P
Richard Hammon is everything okay? do you need coffee money?
Why has Richard Hammond turned into James May?
I'd still have the rs over most of the cars there,the zonda might be a possible maybe aswell
First thought he sells a Pagani HUUARRAIYYAA
My Old Boss, Robert Dixon had one of those Jensen CV8's.
Came for pagani roadster, stayed and literally gasped for the 901 Porsche.
simply brilliant
So sorry your show is on Discovery+… I can only imagine the razzing you get from Jeremy and James with their Amazon shows.
I love that Zonda but I love it even more knowing the owner really uses it. When you think they probably have a fleet of cars available at any time and still choose to drive that mad thing about it shows they really got it for what it is rather than to tell their mates what they have. Brilliant.
Nothing like a bit of click bait
I just got bamboozled so hardd
Well done Hammond well done yawm
Obviously the money's drying up
This absolutely cracks me ⬆️   If Richard Hammond actually needed to sell anything serious and I mean serious questions should he asked!  He’s absolutely minted!  Stop talking bollocks
On tonight's Show... Hammond makes some noises
I was like Hammond? Selling A pagani? 😲  +clickbait point 👍🏽
You should ask hammond if he  Found his wedding ring when he was shoveling gravel in the combine harvester in norway
but where is the Excellent?
👍 Из России с любовью к этому каналу! Translate it yourself 😉
Fast and loud?
My my, what a misleading thumbnail.
It would be funny to import a Ford to America...
Clickbait
How to become a millionaire in car restoration / kit car factories  Start with 10 million and in a year you will be a millionaire
He needs to make the show available for international audiences
So this was recorded in the first week of September.... Are you guys living in a time warp...  Or does it take you nearly 3 months to edit 5 minute video?
When he’s talking about the zonda I’m in the background and I didn’t even realise until I got home lol
He's having a midlife Isis.
Class act. The man is a national treasure (and I ain't british).
O ANOTHER ONE RIGHT THERE
That thumbnail really baited me. I was surprised Hammond actually owned a Zonda and even more that he was selling it.
Really handsome old truck ? Couldn’t quite make it out
That Brummie accent was amazing haha
There is one car there that did actually totally eclipse the Zonda, you saw it twice in this video, the McLaren F1 LM, possibly the greatest car the world has ever known. It's a shame Hammond didn't spotlight it for this.
0:17s - On center screen. the car on right... straight lines...grey, what his brand name/model?
You should have made a series out of the The Interceptors!
If I was hamster, I'd rather sell my wife and daughters😏
3:54 what is going on in the background ?
The 901 looks a lot like a Volkswagen.
Can't wait the next gt trailer
Can we please have the show here in the United States? :(
Jensen was built in West Bromwich and not Birmingham!!!
55,000 km?! The owner deserves a medal for actually driving such a rare and beautiful car
Waw, the orange peel on the rear quarter of the RS
"We're proud to have got it here" .......  You could hear the brummy bubbly up in Hammond there
Thanks, Richard!
Hammond casually skipped the Mclaren F1.
Richard is sounding more like that bloke who does grand designs when he describes cars 🚗
The Pagani Zonda still wows me today when I see it on screen despite it coming out in about 1999. I'd much rather have that over modern supercars like a LaFerrari or McLaren 720. Crazy to think that the original had less than 400 bhp.
Its actually hard to find a Zonda now that hasnt been taken back to the factory to be upgraded to a 760
From the thumbnail, I thought Hammond was selling a Zonda.
Plug Me Baby One More Time !
Clickbait 🙄👎🏼
This goes beyond clickbait to just flat out lying.
That mclaren f1 lm's papaya color really springs out when you get a vertical pan out of the show huh
Can we just take a moment to appreciate that Mclaren F1 GTR 😍
I do wish he'd shave that goaty,  🤢he's a young looking man,  it's does him no favors
That Zondas air intake slightly reminds me of the Martian heat ray weapon in the 1950s War of the Worlds film
noooooooooooooooooooo, not the ZONDA !     #crysinbeer
My Heart bleeds for the multi millionaire . . .
Wow that Zonda has been driven as much as my M4. Insane. Whoever owned that had FUN!
Now THAT’S what I call clickbait
AAAAND they lost money on it, only selling for 33k pounds instead of the expected 40k.
The title is a bit misleading... company stock and personal cars are two very different things.
So Brits had a prize for fastest caravan towing? You just surrendered your rights to make fun of NASCAR and every other American motorsport.
Another reason why the elites should be no more
SLR next to it, what color is it? I
What is he selling? Never mind, don’t care anymore.
The c-v8 is great but i love the interceptor.
If I had a zonda rs I want to be buried with it
Anyone wonder why Richard has never bought a Pagani?
Did i miss what car he is selling....? I think the title of this video is wrong..
Ouch, the orange peel paint and shot taillight seal at 4:28 are painful to see.
The RS2000 even has the original Ford Orange Peel effect paint work  ... Well done 👏
Shifting with your left hand ?  That’s no fun
Zonda is nice but still not as fast as a rental !!
Wowwww 2:18 u just casually walk past a F1 LM without even saying anything about it🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️
Wow quality car wish I could buy it any1 for a ford focus 57 plate? 🤣👍🏻 thanks for sharing this
What's wrong with him? Money > Pagani ? Have u gone fookin biscuits?
all going belly up?
These videos never fail to make me feel poor
What happened to the 98 Silverado from season 3 of the grand tour
I want all of them!
Really
Poor Hammond, he’s only going to have Oliver left
Richard give us more episodes of your show pleeeeeease ❤️
that pagani is nice and all but a vauxhall corsa diesel, now thats true power
Oh man you know it's serious when he sells the Huayra
Fake, this car wasn't crashed.
Hello Hammond love when you do these
What a car
Nooo, not the Zonda
I’m currently watching old top gear specials
This new venture is going to ruin him
1st.
First
First
For me
Not another one🥲
