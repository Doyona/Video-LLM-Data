OTF IN THE PRIME
how is this song with aphantasia- trouble (conjouring) and/or (running mental images) or total aphantasia when you see images through a sheet since the amagylda is connected to color researching about it when the projection neurons are disconnected it on google ai when i google searched it on google ai and poe app on iphone, mac, or chromebook and windows doesnt have poe i used google ai. looked it up and heared about it but never seen or heard about it since i dont have hyperphantasia or hsam either and some also have it... disconnected or problems with it and are some people curious about why people have it anymore do people really eat from the wild anymore why does everybody eat chips and packaged foods i even heard some people  dont have picture stabilitry when playing music in their head or when hearing it and  i am really scared about it. ghosts are scary why is there a black square on the chips too very very scary that are we goiung to die from it. scary to exert scary labels on bags even saw it on facebook those toothpaste color tags. in what is jesus is the other markings asnd on the side of the square why cant i hold on how unhealthy these chips are. cheez its are scary too. very demon to see these things rather than gang violence lol. its in every store and the black square agonizes me. so does the devil crossing color dots and target signs. immediately scared me when i noticed it not later on like always of that stuff. i dont perceive them like this. is this why my apple is half lol. very targeting to see. i see newer and upgraded packaging showing newer ingredients on the bags written. wow.. tasty though but looks like its there becsuse of taste right been here a while i wonder if that was here as a kid or sitting om the curb eating it. anyway this plagues me straight and at least when its there bags show scary as using drugs is bad and also some people also have trouble forming them too like in the creating area since spacial is memory and the brain automatically switches when eyes closed. also looked up people with hyperphantasia have a lower iq but havent looked about hsam though. and there is a v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v6 v7 v8 and projection neurons all sections are detachable and it runs trough a ventral stream and there is red aphantssia too. scizopphrenia might be perceptional problems with perception of colors like of one either way. does it sound as good. if you have sound aphantsia is it a hole in one no hole ded no music no loving it or it plays blank different from dementia from aging rather than damage to them or change of perception to it or aged cortex or all or an old man i used to know that was aged rather than an aphant or something. very lonely.

Without even watching the music video and just hearings Von's voice just hits different! It's heartbreaking.
Y’all heard them Savannah niggas song called “lul Tim & Ricky Jivens” wtf they got goin on??? https://youtu.be/dIxzDlIZpQc
Prince dre should of been on this
Von had a unique flow🤫
Since shorty fw this
Memo went crazy no cap
Someone get rid of memo and booka they ruined the fucking song🗑
In my opinion von had the best verse 🖐💯
Memo🔥🔥

David Lee Roth needs a verse
Joint make the weather change up

🔥🔥🔥🔥
Juss imagine you walk outside one morning & see these faces at your🚪 Rapping this onna beat playing on a speaking😂
Him and Durk was going back and forth
Von was the truth!! 🕊
🔥🔥
Von verse the HARDEST it's like Von speaking from the Beyond!!🕊🕊
Von talking to Durk on his verse.
The one new artist I liked c'mon man. But atleast I can still listen to his art, I'm a bone thugs n harmony fan.
OTF Featuring memo 😂

Only here for Lil durk 💯💯💯💯💯💯
So ain’t no one gone acknowledge that it sound like durk and von sound like they talking to each other  like von verse he talking about durk then durk responds it’s crazy they hide this stuff right under everyone nose and people still don’t realize it and it’s right there in front of them smh wake up folks

Von's verse didn't age well his team didn't even have his back. And Durk added his own verse to justify why he didn't do anything. Fake ass dudes
Man, Chicago have so much dead potential it's crazy and they still have so much potential left alive. On all sides.

Lord Philip Hunt Wants to Prevent Forced Organ Harvesting https://www.truthccn.org/2021/03/05/lord-philip-hunt-wants-to-prevent-forced-organ-harvesting/  From New Tang Dynasty in the United Kingdom (NTD UK News), they report that Lord Philip Hunt proposed an earlier amendment called “medicine and medical devices bill,“ which passed to gaining proof by consensual means of tissues obtained out of the country. Hunt acknowledges about knowing China’s illegal live organ harvesting and affirms he wants it stopped and the amendment is a small step, but a step to stop it. And last year, the London based tribunal conducted previous investigation, and found that, without a doubt, China has been doing forced organ harvesting in their own country for years from ‘prisoners of conscience’.   He wants to do more, which is to ban organ tourism in China. There have been cases where people from the UK have gone to China to purchase them. In addition to that, he wants displays of cadavers to be illegal since some are suspect to be also prisoners of conscience and to stop UK companies from being complicit with China’s organ harvesting, such as not providing medical equipment for it.  He also states that by making a stand in the UK, other countries take notice and do what they’re doing, which is doing the right thing.  To look at this video, click on this link — https://youtu.be/21KxRAd9yLc ———————— The Chinese Communistic Party’s crimes includes forced and live organ harvesting of ‘prisoners of conscience’. They have persecuted, tortured, falsely imprisoned, and murdered Falun Dafa practitioners, Tibetans, Muslim Uighur, Hong Kong people, other dissidents, Christians, and anybody who speaks out against their corrupt, communistic regime as well.

For YHWH so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16 	Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:  I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. 	For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one  jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. 	Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,  and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of  heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be  called great in the kingdom of heaven. Matthew Chap 5  Jesus loves you very much, sometimes it may not seem like it, but He never left you aside, He knows absolutely everything that happens in your life, your moments of sadness and joy. He is the water of life, if you drink this water you will never be thirsty and nothing else will plague you, even if you go through difficult situations. If you still don't believe in Him, say a simple prayer asking Him to confirm that He exists and He will show you. He has a great desire to have a closer relationship with you.

“For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever. Therefore encourage one another with these words. Now, brothers and sisters, about times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, “Peace and safety,” destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape. But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief. You are all children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to the darkness. So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet. For God did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. He died for us so that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.” #LordJesusiscoming

if you are reading this right now, i’m speaking from the spiritual world, i’ve come to warn you all from this system that is pushing these type of artists to lower you’re vibration, therefore leaving ascension non existent.  escape this system, they are killing you’re mind.  evolve.. listen to the deep deep heaven within yourself.
I actually think memo had the best part😂🤦🏽‍♂️
Lil durk people saying you set up king con to get killed

I’m sure you’ve heard of the name Jesus and I’m sure you’ve heard of the cross.  But do you know what jesus went through? he didn’t just jump infront of a bullet or get injected with poison and instantly died... He died a brutally, horrific, and extremely painful death. To Start he had thorns about 3 inches long shoved into his skull. He was tied to a wooden beam where he couldn’t fall to the ground and these leather belts with broken glass and bone along with sticky blood were whipped across his back until he was near death. Then he was made to carry a 300 pound cross up a hill just to be nailed on it. He had nail driven into each of his hands and nail driven into his feet. He hung naked on the cross until his final breath. But the story doesn’t end there. 3 days later he moved the stone and defeated death. You see Jesus is alive today and everything he went through was so we could be in a relationship with him... He died the death that we deserved. “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” ‭‭John‬ ‭3:16‬
Isn’t von dead I miss him 🥺
Rip Von🕊

Behold, My Word is truth! And that which requires understanding shall be given to those of a contrite heart and a humble spirit. For those who love Me obey My Commandments, and those who remember My Sabbaths honor Me and shall know Wisdom. Therefore, consider these things carefully. For I have indeed prepared a place for those who seek Me, for those who long to know Me as I truly am, a place for all those accepted in The Beloved, in whom My spirit dwells, The Kingdom without end.  Therefore hear the Word of The Lord, O peoples of the earth, for the Day of The Lord is at hand: Behold, I shall stir up the multitudes, and show wonders in the heavens above and in the earth beneath! There shall be blood and fire and pillars of smoke, and the foundations of the world shall be shaken! For I shall reveal My Glory; behold, every eye shall see! Then all the inhabitants of the earth will know, I AM THE LORD! For as it was in the days of My servant, Moses, when I stretched out My hand against Egypt, with many mighty signs and wonders, so shall it be in the Great and Terrible Day of The Lord! Yet understand this, O most arrogant generation, My judgment on Egypt was but a mere drop of rain, a single crack of thunder, compared with that which I have prepared for this sleeping generation!  Therefore awake, all you sleepers, For the time of your slumber has ended; Awake, and prepare to meet your God!...  Repent, and turn aside from All this wickedness you have chosen! Turn your back on all these abominations You uphold, and embrace The Salvation of God!...  For I AM, and you are in life because of Me; In Me alone is everlasting life; Beloved, I AM HE!...  There is no other, a just God and a Savior; There is none besides Me...  God Eternal.  * Excerpt from  https://www.thevolumesoftruth.com/God_Eternal  God Eternal - The Volumes of Truth www.TheVolumesofTruth.com
Just remember this is the dumb shit that got him killed. Rest in peace tooka. We smokin on von.

Meditation led me to look up who the CEO of Pfizer is.. I don't pick sides and feel people should do what they are inspired to do as far as vaccines and Covid 19. But for some reason my meditation led me to "who is the CEO of Pfizer.. As you know I'll be deleting this post. Lol but..Any thoughts on the CEO of Pfizer public claims of "being the Messiah"..? Guess we do need one...🙏😌..sure seems like a great idea for the world to have a Messiah injecting vaccines and saving the entire world.🤫🙃 What do you think about this?  "In 2020, Bourla pushed for aggressive timelines in Pfizer's development of a possible vaccine against COVID-19.He determined production of a potential vaccine would begin, at risk, while awaiting approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), although expected as soon as October 2020. In late July 2020, the company was among top developers of a potential vaccine, in partnership with German company BioNTech (Angel sidenote: this is a company to invest in) as they entered late-stage trials with mRNA, BNT162b2. Under his leadership, Pfizer asked Latin American countries for embassies and military bases as collateral before delivering vaccine. While in front of press Bourla claims to be a messiah, but during negotitations with developing countries he hardballs to get 100-1000x markup on the vaccine".. May you all feel confident in whatever choices you make.  ✨😌💕

This is HARD!
U a bitch u coulda said what u said about while he was alive but don’t say it in a song u bitch
Whoever that is committing sin is of the devil, I John 3:8 (I John 3:8). If you are into lying, cheating, bitterness, keeping malice, pride, manifesting anger, quarrelling, unforgiving, hatred, envy, contention, strife, bitterness, cursing, speaking evil of others, taking or giving bribe, selfishness, deception, kidnapping, smuggling, falsification of documents, swearing, extortion and other sinful character dispositions, you must repent (Colossians 3:5-9; Romans 1:29-32; Proverbs 6:16-19).  Such evil and wicked character will hinder the manifestation of God’s abundant blessings upon your life. If you are into lust, masturbation, fornication, adultery, prostitution (private or public), patronizing prostitutes, abortion, lesbianism, homosexuality, bestiality, watching pornography (I Corinthians 6:9-10), immoral thoughts or any act of immorality, you need to repent (Galatians 5:19-21; Mathew 5:28; Mark 7:21-23). Jesus loves you and wants to save you.  Visit this church, 'THE LORD'S CHOSEN CHARISMATIC REVIVAL MOVEMENT'.  www.tlccrm.org OR www.tlccrm.org/chosentvOR https://www.youtube.com/user/IamaChosen1  Are you into idolatry? Are you into cultism, whether open or secret cult? Do you practice witchcraft or Yoga? Do you smoke cigarette or cannabis? Do you sell them or offer them to people? Do you smoke or sniff hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin, captain black, hashish or other banned drugs or snuff? Are you lusting - lusting after men or women, covetous, alcohol drinking (proverbs 31:4-6)? You must repent, stop them and give your life to Jesus Christ. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.  Are you into marry and divorce? Then you are a sinner. Are you married to more than one person? Repent!! Marriage is between a man and a woman. Marriage is for better and for worse until death separates (Matthew 19:3-6). ‘Wherefore they are no more two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together let no man put asunder (separate)’. Cheating on your wife or husband is sin. Proverbs 28: 13 says, ‘‘He that covers his sins shall not prosper...You must repent of them, confess and forsake them (1 John 1:9).  Are you into worldliness? Don’t you know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? (James 4:4; II John2:15-17). So, you must stop bleaching your body or painting your mouth, eyes, hands and legs or fixing attachments, weave-on, earrings (Genesis 35:2-4), bangles, chains and frying or perming your hair. Tattooing your body is satanic. Are you one of those that put on nude dresses, short skirts, transparent dresses to seduce men or women (a Seducer or a Promoter of lust is a Sinner – Mathew 5:28)   Perhaps you wear trousers as a woman? (Read Deuteronomy 22:5), that is an abomination (Revelation 21:8, 27). Therefore, make up your mind, repent and give your life to Jesus Christ. Are you spoilt? Jeremiah 4:30 says, ‘‘And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee. They will seek thy life’’. (2 Kings 9:30; Hosea 2:13; Exodus 33:1-6)  A Christian is not a Sinner and a Sinner is not a Christian (I John 3:9). If you must be a blessed child of God, then you must repent of your sins and give your life to Jesus Christ. If you believe Jesus Christ today, righteousness of God will come into your life and abundant life will be your portion (1 John 11-12). If you neglect this call to repentance and salvation and die, you will not escape fire of Hell (Hebrews 2:3). It is foolishness and sin to say or think that there is no God (Psalm 14:1; 9:17). Luke 13:3, Jesus said, ‘I tell you, Nay: but except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish’. Cut off every besetting sin (Hebrew 12:1-2; Mark 9:43-48).   If you have decided now (2 Corinthians 6:2) to give your life to Jesus Christ and to forsake your sinful lifestyle, please say this prayer:  Almighty God, I come unto you in the name of Jesus. Father I confess that I am a sinner. All my sins I confess to you.  I am very sorry for all my sins (mention those you can remember). Lord I promise you that from today I will never continue in them anymore. I believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again on the third day for my justification.  Almighty God, use the blood of Jesus to wash my sins away. Lord Jesus, come into my heart, be my Lord and personal Saviour. I surrender my life to you. Cancel my name from the books of death and write it in the book of life. Give me power to sin no more. In Jesus name I pray. Amen!!

For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,  1 Corinthians 15:3-4  Titus 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people,   Romans 1:16  For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.  Acts 2:38 ESV And Peter said to them, “Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit  Revelation 2:10   Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.  John 1:12  But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God,
I want war between west and  east coast.
Should have been king von and lil durk only

This song is just perfect🔥
Yes sir  okay
V Roy 🔥🔥🔥
This is the most important post you will ever read.  Every one of us has sinned against God. We’ve lied, we’ve stolen, we’ve sinned sexually, and we’ve taken His name in vain; which makes us liars, thieves, fornicators and blasphemers.. Yet this is only four of our many transgressions.  The problem is, we can never ‘outweigh’ our sin with good works because God is perfect in Holiness, meaning his standard is beyond our reach. He is also perfect in Justice, meaning, he will bring EVERY sin to light. The punishment for our sin is death, and Hell; a place of Eternal Fire, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Fortunately God is also perfect in Love, so 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ left his throne in heaven and came to this earth. While here, he lived a perfectly righteous life, only to take the punishment that We deserved; Our sinless creator became Our sin, and endured a gruesome death on a cross for our sake.  Right before he died, he said ‘it is finished’.. meaning, the debt for our sins has been paid in full. And on the third day, he defeated death and rose from the grave. So now, we can go free from the wrath of God’s judgement not by earning it, but rather, as a free gift of grace..  Except gifts can be either accepted or rejected. So this is what you must do in response;   Humbly admit to God that you have sinned against him, and through gratitude in the sacrifice of his son, repent (turn away) from your old way of life. Then, confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, your savior, and the ruler of your life from this moment forward (Romans 10:9).   Do these things, and you will be saved.  If you do so sincerely, God will grant you a new heart which no longer finds comfort in sin, but instead desires to read and obey his word. He will also grant you Eternal life in his presence; The greatest pleasure on earth doesn’t even come close to what God is preparing for believers in the afterlife.   You’ve been informed; Now the choice is yours. What you do with this information will determine where you spend ETERNITY, meaning, this is the single most critical decision you will EVER make; And all of us here, whether believer or atheist, know deep down that every last word here is true.  Jesus Christ awaits YOU this very moment. Don’t even think about sleeping tonight until you surrender your life to him, because your tomorrow isn’t guaranteed.. And as it is written (Hebrews 9 : 27);  ‘It is appointed unto man ONCE to die, but after this, THE JUDGMENT’.  All glory, honor and praise to Lord Jesus Christ.
Ion like it long live the 6 kb6ixx

Vine autopsy says he had percoets in his blood stream.   His manager gave him or drugged him that night, he was also shot in the liver and in the kidney. His blood was thinner and it also made it worst because his organs couldn’t function right. The manager let the fight happen then tapped the car to signal Tim it was time.  Von dissed lil mista who is durks dead cousin and durk has also been distant from oblick but has been with his day one hittas from LAMRON (NORMAL). He know wassup and he also spoke on the situation in multiple songs. His songs may correlate to duck and krump, but it was also meant for von. “He was taking them percosets, I hate that he died alone”
I forgot how bad memo is
Grandson. ❤️
Damn how you gonna Put Von on a track  when you backdoor'd him. Durk a Rat ask Moorman.

*your reading this, ok look im not gonna lie, you hate that one self promoter guy, but I honestly believe I’m the notorious BIG reincarnated, if not then biggie and pac are my spirit guides on my left and right, and. I think I’m going to become the greatest rapper of THIS ERA, Sure I might kinda suck at the moment but that won’t stop me, roast my music or praise it, for my confidence knows no bounds, enough of these trash rappers thinking they’re music is anything but regurgitated garbage that all sounds the same, how bout a mediocre rapper that’s self aware and doesn’t take anything seriously and mocks the industry and has fun amongs the chaos ? i would appreciate the feedback and harsh criticism along the way though* 🙏✌️🔥  *im an australian rapper that was rejected by my nation and will get back at them through these malicious rhymes* 🤙👹  *make sure to roast my OTHER songs too,* 🙏🔥    👇👇👇  https://youtu.be/kPhL0Lq4I6M   *BTW I MADE A STAR WARS DISS TRACK* 🤙🔥

still hurt LLKV👑
I feel like you ass set up von 🤷🏻‍♂️
Can we all talk about how Fire booka is🔥damn💯
Man remembered when I first heard about king von I was blasting music doing the garden and had youtube playing music on random . King von crazy story came on and I literally fell in love with the sound and the flow .had to turn down the music so the neighbors didn't look at me weird due to all the vulgar words lol. But man I enjoy him taking me on a journey haven't heared music like how he did it . You can really tell he came from where he did and just really showed me the mentality of someone from the streets affiliated with gangs and what they potentially have to do. I don't support it but he kinda made you understand why he  had to do what he does . I don't think any rapper really showed or portrayed the street mentality like he did. He showed you what life in Chicago is man. It's sad sometimes the choices people make because possibly they feel like they never had a choice or their environment puts them in situations where choosing the right path is harder then doing what's bad God bless all the people lost to gang violence or just violence in general peace and love to all of you.

KING VON DEAD THOUGH  🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
im not saying theres merit to it but heres why they say that durk sacrificed von. him and keef started beefing in like 2013 or 2014 sum like that. some say them snatching sosa chain and embarassing him what made mfs who listened to drill at the time pay more attention to signed to the streets 1. they try saying he sacrificed nuski to make signed to the streets 2 what it was..if yall remember STTS2 made durk massive to street niggas. then they try saying he sacrificed his manager for that def jam album remember my name. they say he sacrificed fredo to get out his deal and used it to drop STTS3. Now they say he gave them von for love songs to the streets 2 which is one of his best tapes imo. and sacrificed him when just cause yall waited 2 aint do what he thought and thats why his new album so big. i think its sad that ppl make up these stupid narratives but its just what i heard. i dont believe nor endorse it
P3mD$ P3mD$ 🔥🔥
Rip von
durk got von killed trust mee von dissed his cousin and he said that one that dissed my cousin now he in wood

I only f**k with Chicago drill coz of the raw pain music.This other demon time black on black murder pron shit is just wrong and sadly it's us fans who encourage it. Skip the songs till they get the message based on numbers.Chicago doesn't have to be the devil's playground and sadly kids are inheriting beefs that they weren't apart of at all. Pappy,dooskie,LA,Von,Duck..Bruh this was supposed to be the new Compton for music and all these niggas on all sides know it.It's just sad man.

Jesus love you, he died on the cross for you, accept him as your lord and savior he can change everything. For God so loved the world that he gave his only son, so that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life" (Jn 3:16"  But you must repent too. From that time Jesus went about preaching and saying, Let your hearts be turned from sin, for the kingdom of heaven is near. (Matthew 4:17)^

John 3:16-17 16. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. 17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. Romans 6:23 23 For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 10:9-10 9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.10 For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Amen.
Memo pose to come harder!
The  ABCs of Salvation, or how to be right with God, and know you're going to Heaven:  A-dmit that you're a sinner, and need a Savior.  As it is written: There is none righteous, no, not one. Romans 3:10  For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Romans 3:23  B-elieve that Jesus Christ died paying the penalty for your sins, and rose from the grave.  He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross. 1 Peter 2:24  For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures... 1 Corinthians 15:3-4  C-all on the Lord Jesus Christ to save you, and trust only in Him for your salvation.  If you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. Romans 10:9  For whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Romans 10:13  The moment you "believe," or, put your trust in what Jesus has done for you, God saves you and your eternal destiny in Heaven is assured. You go from spiritual death to eternal life the moment you believe.  Jesus said it this way: Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life. John 5:24😀

VERY IMPORTANT READ THIS🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 Is track fault , von manager, that king von died , he was giving wrong advices and he setup king to meet quando rondo to fight cause he want to chase clout , remeber more clout more money he makes, is his fault. From interwiew he was in front of the car and he was the one who bring von to that club, von wasnt sposed to be there, f.ck track, von's manager, is his fault He said to king von to beef with nba youngboy and all the stuff cause he wanted money!!!!
